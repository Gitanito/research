F. Barrett,\nProfessor of Experimental Physics in the Royal College of Science for Ireland.\n\"There are two ways of investigating the facts or fancies about the\ndivinmg rod. One is to examine it in its actual operation\u2014a task of consider\nable labour, which will doubtless be undertaken by the Society for Psychical\nResearch ; the other, and easier way, is to study the appearances of the\ndivining wand in history.\"\u2014 A. Lang, Custom and Myth, p. 181.\nPart I.\nINTRODUCTORY.\nAt first sight few subjects appear to be so unworthy of serious\nnotice and so utterly beneath scientific investigation as that of the\ndivining rod. To most men of science the reported achievements\nof the \" diviner \" are on a par with the rogueries of Sir Walter\nScott's Dousterswivel. That any one with the smallest scientific\ntraining should think it worth his while to devote a considerable\namount of time and labour to an enquiry into the alleged evidence on\nbehalf of the rod, will appear to my scientific friends about as sensible\nas if he spent his time investigating fortune-telling or any other relic\nof superstitious folly. Nor was my own prejudice against this subject\na-iy less than that of others. For I confess that it was with great\nreluctance, and even repugnance, that, some six years ago, yielding\nto the earnest request of the Council of the S.P.R., I began an\ninvestigation of the matter ; hoping, however, in my ignorance, that\na fesv weeks' work would enable me to relegate it\n\"Into a limbo large and broad, since called\nThe Paradise of fools.\"\nMoreover, geologists might well make an objection in limine to\n\fXXXII.] 3\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nany such investigation.i For it is a matter of common geological\nknowledge that the mode of distribution of underground water is\nvery different from that imagined by the professional \"diviner\" or\n\" dowser \".- The latter with the utmost assurance locates a spring\non a particular spot, and gives its exact depth from a foot to 100 feet,\nand its yield of water, and then probably will tell you there is another\nspring a few feet further off, perhaps at a very different depth, but\nthat between no water will be found. Or, putting his interpreta\ntion on other indications of the rod, he will confidently assert that\nunder his feet an underground river exists, yielding so many gallons\nper hour. By the same means he will profess to ascertain the\ndirection in which the imaginary river is running, and give you its\ndepth below the surface. Hard by he will trace other invisible\nstreams, and follow them to their source, maintaining that a perfectly\ndry rock or sub-soil separates underground waters. Most of this is\nridiculous to the practical geologist.3 Here, for example, is an extract\nfrom a letter I lately received from the Rev. Osmond Fisher, M.A.,\n(author of Physics of the Earth's Crust), which gives the geological\nstatement of the case with admirable clearness and brevity :\u2014\nHarlton Rectory, Cambridge, February 4th, 1896.\nIt appears to me that the assumption which underlies the belief in the\ndivining rod is erroneous. It is only under exceptional circumstances,\nas among crystalline rocks, or where the strata are much disturbed,\nthat underground water runs in channels like water in a pipe, so that a\nperson can say, \" I am now standing over a spring,\" whereas a few paces off\nhe was not over one. What is called a spring, such as is reached in a well,\nis usually a widely extended water-saturated stratum. Ordinarily where\nwater can be reached by a well, there are few spots [in the neighbourhood]\nwhere a well would not find it.\ni Here is an extract from a recent letter from a well-known geologist :\u2014\n\" It is sad to find you troubling about that wretched divining rod ! . . . Why\nis it that of late years tins ' pestilent heresy ' has cropped up so ? And why are\neducated people bitten by it? Squires, M.P.'s, doctors, and alas, parsons ! \" As an\ninstance of the general treatment of the subject by scientific men, I may refer to a\nrecent letter from Mr. C. Tomlinson, F.R.S., in Notes and Queries for April 2oth,\ni8:Xi, p. 336. The writer quotes as fact a series of statements about the \" rod,\" which\na very btief investigation of the subject would have shown him to be entirely un\nfounded. Nevertheless, he says to those who give credit to the water-finders, and\nwho point out that facts are stubborn things ; \" My answer is, verification of facts\nis still more stubborn,'' a sentiment which we all agree with, and wish all who write\non this subject would attend to.\n- The derivation of this word is obscure ; the subject is discussed in Appendix A.\n3 1 have ventured to give in Appcndiz B a brief outline\u2014based on the authority of\neminent geologists\u2014of the chief points at present known concerning the production\nand circulation of underground waters. The unscientific reader may thus be better\nable to appreciate, or to question, the orthodox geological view regarding the\ndivining rod. References are there given to some standard works on underground\nwater.\nb 2\n\f4 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nThe question which is really worthy of investigation in this and\nsimilar cases seems to be how such an idea ever originated, and to what\nit owes its vitality.\nFurthermore, if instances of the successful use of the divining rod\nbe quoted, the geologist would doubtless reply that these are either\nshrewd guesses of the \" diviner,\" or else purely cases of chance\ncoincidence ; the few successes being recorded, whilst the numerous\nfailures are overlooked. This, indeed, is a common fallacy, for\n\" the mind is arrested by the affirmative instances, whereas the\nnumberless instances in which there is no correspondence between the\none set of facts and the other, altogether escaped our notice.\" i\nHence, from the geologist's point of view, the rod of the diviner\nis no more a mystery than the wand of a conjurer. So far as its use\nin finding water or mineral veins is concerned, the geologist argues\nthat precisely the same degree of success would be obtained by tossing\na coin, or throwing dice, and then sinking wells on the spots indicated\nby one's greatest luck in guessing.\nNevertheless it is impossible to read the voluminous evidence,\ncollected with such painstaking care by Mr. Vaughan Jenkins of\nOxford, which is given in Mr. Pease's S.P.R. report of thirteen years\nago, without coming to the same conclusion as that arrived at by Mr.\nPease, namely that :\u2014\" The evidence for the success of 1 dowsing ' as\na practical art is very strong\u2014and there seems to be an unexplained\nresiduum when all possible deductions have been made.\" 2 Forty years\nago, Dr. Mayo, F.R.S., arrived at a similar conclusion after experi\nmental trials made with the rod both in England and abroad, and he\npublished a paper on this subject in his entertaining little book On the\nTruths contained in Popular Superstitions. Prior to this, in 1814,\nDr. C. Hutton, F.R.S., after examining the then accessible evidence on\nbehalf of the divining rod and witnessing Lady Milbanke's success\nwith the rod, published a statement of his own belief in the practical\nvalue of the divining rod, though unable to explain its behaviour.3\ni Fowler's Inductive Logic, p. 239.\n3 Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II , p. 89. An abstract of the evidence collected by\nMr. Vaughan Jenkins up to the date of Mr. Pease's report (January, 1884), is given in\nthe Proceedings 3.P.R., Vol. II., pp. 90-107.\n3 See Montucla's edition of Ozanam's Mathematical Recreations, translated and\nenlarged by C. Hutton, LL.D. , F.R.S., Vol. 4, 2nd edition, Longmans, 1814. In\nthe first edition of this translation, belief in the use of the \" rod \" is treated as\nabsurd. When this view was challenged, Hutton made enquiries for himself, with\nthe result stated above. He had the courage to publish his conviction in later\neditions of the book, pp. 216\u2014231. See also on this Dr. Ashburner's edition of\nReichenbach's researches, p. 91, and the Quarterly Review for 1822, p. 37o, et tcq.\nThe writer in the Quarterly says, \"The fact of the discovery of water being effected\n\fXXXII.] 5\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nAnd recently, in 1883, Dr. R. Raymond read a paper before the\nAmerican Institute of Mining Engineers in which, after considerable\ninvestigation, the conclusion is arrived at :\u2014\"That there is a residuum\nof scientific value, after making all necessary deductions for exaggera\ntion, self-deception, and fraud,\" in the use of the divining rod for\nfinding springs and deposits of ore.i This testimony gains additional\nweight from the fact that Dr. Raymond is the distinguished secretary\nof that important Institute.\nIn like manner, it is impossible to study this subject historically\nwithout being impressed by the number of those who have accepted as\nindisputable the practical value of the rod, during the four centuries it\nhas been in use. And these believers in its efficacy were not a set of\nsilly, superstitious men, easily duped by cunning rogues,\u2014credulous\nfools, capable of believing any nonsense ;\u2014on the contrary, among\nthem were some of the most learned writers and the most painstaking\ninvestigators of their day, together with an array of practical miners\nand well-sinkers ; men who ought to have known what they were\ntalking about. The popular off-hand view about the rod\u2014that it is\nmerely another instance of the perennial superstition, or roguery, of\nmankind\u2014seems therefore somewhat inadequate. For the curious\nproblem that meets one in the examination of the subject is, not only\nthe long survival and wide extent of the belief in the rod, but the\nsingular and unselfish enthusiasm of its advocates, together with the\ngeneral probity and intelligence of the \"dowsers\" themselves. Quakers,\nfarmers, ladies* children, poor-law guardians, clergymen, magistrates,\netc., are among the English dowsers of to-day, and these are not the\nclass of people one would expect to find hoodwinking a gullible public.\nThey may, of course, be the victims of self-deception ; if so, does this\nalso apply to the professional dowsers (in England alone I know of\nnearly twenty who make a living by their practice), whom numerous\nagents of estates and owners of land find it to their interest repeatedly\nto employ 1 2\nby the divining rod, when held in the hands of certain persons, seems indubitable.\n. . . The faculty, so inherent in certain persons, is evidently the same with that\nof the Spanish Zahories, though the latter do not employ the hazel twig.\" This is\nmuch the same view as that taken by the editor of the Spectator in an article in that\njournal for October 14th, 1882. The Zahories, as will be seen in the sequel, I have\ntraced back to a writer in the 16th century.\ni Mr. Pease in his S.P.R. report refers to Raymond's paper, which I find was\nread a second time at the U.S. International Electrical Exhibition in 1884, and\nis again published in the Journal of the Franklin Institute for 1885 I shall return\nto this paper later on.\n2 I am glad to be able to bear testimony to the fact that several of these\nprofessional dowsers, notably those who have been most successful, are simple\nunassuming men, who do not disguise their ignorance, nor occasional failures, and\nare ready to impart all they know. On the other hand, as might naturally be\n\f6 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nFurthermore, it is to be noted that at the present day, as in\nthe past, those who have had the opportunity of examining most\nclosely the practical use of the \" dowser's art \" are not to be found\namong the scoffers. The opinion expressed to me by many well-\ninformed and critical observers who live in that region of the South\nWest of England where the \" rod \" has been longest in use, and is still\nextensively employed, is by no means contemptuous or even unfavour\nable. Here, for example, is an extract from the West Somerset Word\nBook, by Mr. F. T. Elworthy (author of The Evil Eye and Kindred\nSuperstitions), an able and impartial authority.\nDOWSE [aaew'ss], t>. To use the divining-rod for the purpose of finding\nsprings of water.\nThe faculty possessed by some individuals is truly marvellous, and is not\nto be explained by the ordinary method, of ascribing the action to chicanery,\nas the evidence to unbiassed minds is beyond cavil. Moreover, the power is\nnot hereditary nor communicable. Nascitnr non fit. The power of the\nDowser to discover water is not merely a surviving superstition, but is\nbelieved in by hard-headed, practical men of the world, who still habitually\npay their money for the advice of these men, and who have proved by\nrepeated trials that it is always correct, and worth paying for.\nQuite recently a Sanatorium was to be built upon a high and apparently\nvery dry spot, where of course the first necessity was water. Three pro\nfessional Dowsers were sent for separately, and unknown to each other.\nEach came on a different day from the others, and under the impression that\nhe alone was being employed, with the result that all three pointed to the\nsame spot, where a well was dug and abundant water found..\nInasmuch as one of my own daughters has the power to some extent, I\nam able to testify that trickery plays no part in the performance, and she\nherself is quite unconscious of anything by which the rod is acted on.\nThe rod or twig I have seen used is a fork of about a foot long, cut oft\"\njust below the bifurcation, and in size each limb is about as large as a thick\nstraw. The wood, it is said, must be either \" halse \" or white thorn, and\nmay be used either green or dry. The operator holds an end of the twig\nfirmly between the fingers and thumb of each hand, and with the elbows\npressed rigidly against the sides ; consequently the two ends of the twig are\nexpected, the possession of any peculiar \"faculty\" tends to inordinate self-conceit\nand vanity, especially among the illiterate class from whom the professional dowser\nis usually drawn. This is traceable from the 17th century dowser down to the\npresent day. Among such men a great mystery is made of their \"art\"; an\napprenticeship must be served, and initiation to its mysteries could, in former times,\nonly be gained by a knowledge of the magic rites and ceremonies with which the\npractice was surrounded. At the present day these magic rites are swallowed up by\nthe more magic dollar. For example, the son of an English rector having accidentally\nfound he had the faculty of dowsing, the father tells me he applied for information to\na young professional dowser\u2014who certainly understands the art of self-advertise\nment,\u2014and received tho reply that \"Mr. declines to take less than one\nhundred guineas for giving the youth three months' training \" ! I hope the present\npaper may make such premiums a little more difficult to catch.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 7\npulled asunder, with the centre, or juncture of the fork pointing downwards.\nHe then moves very slowly forward, and when ovor a spring the twig turns\noutwards, and twists upon itself into an upright position. This movement\nmay be repeated any number of times\u2014the rod twisting over and ovor again\nupon reaching the same spot, and with equal freedom when both rod and\nfingers are held by sceptical witnesses. The position in which the twig is\nheld seems to make it impossible that it can be turned by any conscious\nmuscular action. Indeed both my daughter and the professional Dowser I\nhave seen, assert that they cannot twist the rod by any conscious effort.\nIn some parts of the county the operation is called Jowsing and the\noperator a jowser.\nEven the President of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall,\nMr. J. D. Euys, F.G.S., is not a scoffer ; on the contrary he himself is\nan amateur dowser, and in a recent letter, writing from Penryn,\nCornwall, Mr. Enys states, \"I have tried it [dowsing for water] often.\nOn one occasion I cut a small slight rod and held it till I\ncame to the place [where underground water existed], when it always\nacted by turning. On this occasion I was able to hold the rod, but\nit broke short off in front of my hands, and did so a second time in\nthe same place. ... I always feel the effects afterwards if I go\non too long using the rod.\" This is another instance of the testimony\nafforded by a scientific man living in a locality where the rod has been\nin use for centuries. It is always ignorance, and not knowledge, that\nblindly denies what is unfamiliar.\nHere then we find a widespread belief existing at the present day,\nand extending backwards for centuries ; though it seem contemptible,\nhow are we to account for. the origin and survival of this belief, and for\nits appearance and persistence in regions remote from each other? As\nDr. Lauder Brunton, E.R.S., has remarked a propos of this very subject\n\u2014\" when we find certain things implicitly believed in by some people,\nwhilst they are laughed at as ridiculous and absurd by others, it is\nworth while to enquire whether there may not be an element of truth\nas well as of falsehood in both belief and ridicule. Ignorance is the\nparent both of blind belief and of scoffing scepticism, and leads not\nonly to implicit belief in untruth, but also to a rash denial of what is\ntrue.\" One main object of our Society is to endeavour to dispel such\nignorance by carefully examining, in the clearer light of the present\nday, the evidence that exists on behalf of phenomena rejected as\ntrivial or valueless by orthodox science.\nThe Rod Merely an Indicator of Subconscious Impressions.\nIt may, however, be asked in what way does the subject of the\ndivining rod come within the scope of a Society for Psychical\n\fs [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nResearch? This I think will be evident in the sequel of this paper ;\nhere it is only necessary to point out that the rod, or forked twig, is\nnot a chemical or physical re-agent indicating the object sought by\nsome specific action of that object on the material of the rod. The\nrod must be regarded simply as the indicator of some action taking\nplace upon or within the living mechanism of the individual who holds\nthe rod ; just as \" planchette \" or a tilting table is used to indicate\nmuscular impressions made by, or through, the so-called \"medium.\" In\nfact, the rod is not always used by the \"dowser\" ; a piece of wire or\nwatch-spring, or merely the out-stretched hands, are used by some of\nthe most successful \"diviners.\" Hence there can, I think, be little\ndoubt that the subject we are discussing is a special case of that large\ngroup of phenomena belonging to our subliminal consciousness which\nAir. F. W. H. Myers has done so much to elucidate : the movement of\nthe rod being due to involuntary reflex action.\nSome such view, I find, has been held by nearly all who have in\nrecent years carefully considered the subject. Thus Dr. Lauder\nBrunton, F.R.S., says :\u2014\n\"I am inclined to think that the success of the divining rod, in some\nhands, for finding water or even for tracing criminals, is due to its causing\ninvoluntary muscular action, and thus enabling the person using it to\nconsciously recognise that impressions have been made upon him which\nwould otherwise never have arisen above the state of sub-consciousness.\"\nDr. Brunton goes on to say : \" When we hear that a man is able to\ndiscover water at a considerable distance below the ground on which he\nstands, we are at first apt to scout the idea as ridiculous, while if we were\ntold that a caravan was crossing a desert, and that all at once the thirsty\ncamels started off quickly, and at a distance Of a mile or more water was\nfound, we look upon the occurrence as natural. In the same way we regard\nas very remarkable the story of a man tracing criminals with a divining rod,\nbut it becomes quite ordinary if we put a bloodhound in the man's place.\"\nIn conclusion, Dr. Brunton remarks concerning the divining rod and the\nallied popular beliefs: \"The whole subject is a deeply interesting one, and\nits thorough investigation is much to be desired.\" i\nThe discovery of water or a mineral lode by a hazel twig, there\nfore, no longer becomes so absurdly improbable if it is the individual\nwho is in some way the discoverer, and the rod merely the indicator\nof some impression made upon him, an impression too slight and too\nsubtle to rise to the level of consciousness. After all, it is not the\nimprobability of the quest that should deter us, it is simply a question\ni Dr. Lauder Brunton on \"Truth and Delusion.\" in the Universal Review,\nJanuary, l&S0. The Quarterly Review for July, 1895, p. 206, says \" Dowsing . . .\nis either conscious imposture, or it is an act prompted by the sub-conscious element in\nthe personality of the ' dowser.' . . . It is only a question of steady scientific\nexamination, as in the study of any other condition of human faculty.\"\n\fXXXII.] 9\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nof what amount of trustworthy evidence exists upon the subject to\nmake the quest worth pursuing.\nNomenclature.\nThe term divining rod is unfortunate, and has probably led to a\ngood deal of the opprobrium under which the subject rests, as it is\nfrequently confounded with the ancient superstitious practice of\ndivination by a rod, or Rhabdomancy, one of the oldest methods of\naugury (Hosea iv., 12, or by arrows as in Ezekiel xxi., 21). The\nconsiderable literature of Rhabdomancy is a distinct question, and it\nneed hardly be said, of no value to physical science.i\nA rod or wand was not only used for divination, it was and is, the\nsymbol of power; as in Exodus iv., 17, 20; Psalm xxiii, 4, etc., as in\nthe lituus of the Roman augur, in the pastoral staff of a bishop, in\na monarch's sceptre or in the special constable's staff of to-day.2 The\nArch-Druid's wand is another instance of this, and the conjurer's\nwand is a survival of the same thing ; even the native Irish name\nfor the latter is Slaitin Draoidheachla, Druid's wand, or virgula\ndivinationis. On this subject Mr. Lang has given us the benefit of\nhis scholarship in a passage I have quoted in the foot-note below. 3\ni The most learned and exhaustive work on ancient divination is that by\nM. Bouche-Leclercq, entitled HMoirc de la Divination dans FAntiquite, 4 vols.,\nParis, 1880. Lenormant in his Chaldean Magic refers to the use of rhabdomancy\namong the Chaldeans. (Eng. trans., p. 237). See also article Divination in Smith's\nDictionary of the. Bible, and Mr. Myers' brilliant essay on Greek Oracles. Brand's\nI'opular Antiquities contains a lengthy and erudite article on rhabdomancy, in\nwhich reference is made to the divining rod (Vol. II., p. 622.) The most concise\nand excellent article on Divination which I have met with is that in Chambers'\nEncnclopadia. *\nEven among the Mongol tribes, inhabiting the eastern portion of the plateau of\ncentral Asia, divination is rife, as that able and devoted missionary, the Rev.\nJ. Gilmour, M.A., shows in his remarkable work Among the Mongols. Mr. Gilmour\nsays (p. 188 ) that the Mongols expected him to divine for them where to sink\ntheir wells so as to get a good water supply, or where to find any lost cattle, etc., and\nwhen he confessed his inability to do so, their amazement and incredulity were\nprofound.\n- There are, I find, some 130 references to a \" rod \" or \" staff \" as a symbol of\nauthority or power in the Old Testament alono. There has recently been added to the\nSouth Kensington Museum \"a sceptre of blue glazed ware made for Amenhotop II..\nof the 18th Dynasty, from the temple of Nubt.\" This sceptre is some 7 feet high,\nthicker than the girth of one's arm and shaped like a huge shepherd's crook or\npastoral staff. The symbolical, sacred, or magical power of a rod or crook is therefore\nas ancient as it is widely diffused. What gave rise to this is an interesting question.\ns \" In all countries rods or wands, the Latin virga, have a magical power.\nVirgil obtained his mediteval repute as a wizard beeause his name was erroneously\nconnected with virynla, the magic wand. But we do not actually know that the\nancient wand of the enchantress Circe, in Homer, or the wand of Hermes, was\nused, like the divining rod, to indicate the whereabouts of hidden wealth or water.\nIn the Homeric hymn to Hermes (line 520), Apollo thus describes the caduceus,\n\f10 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nInstead, therefore, of the word \" divining rod,\" I would suggest the\nuse of the provincial word dowsing-rod, or of the term winchel-rod : the\nformer is common enough and the latter has been, and still is, used in\ncertain parts ; it was, I believe, first employed by a writer in a book\ntranslated from the German, called the Laboratory, published in 1740.\nThe word probably arose from the German name for divining rod,\nWiiiuchel-ruthe, the pronunciation being similar. One writer, however,\nattributes the word, less probably, to the English winch, as the rod\nturns over hidden springs.i\nAutoscopes.\nAs the divining rod is only one of many instrumental means,\nwhereby imperceptible, involuntary, and unconscious muscular move\nments are revealed by the visible motion of an external object, it is\ndesirable to group these various appliances under a generic name. I\nwould suggest for this purpose the term Autoscope.2 Other autoscopes\nbesides (1) the divining or dowsing rod, are, (2) a little ring or ball sus\npended by a thread, the pendide explorateur of French writers, the use\nor wand of Hermes : ' Thereafter will I give thee a lovely wand of wealth and\nriches, a golden wand with three leaves, which shall keep thee ever unharmed.'\nIn later art, this wand or caditccns, is usually entwined with serpents; but on one\nvase, at least, the wand of Hermes is simply the forked twig of our rustic miners\nand water-finders. The same form is found on an engraved Etruscan mirror.\n\"Now,was a wand of this form used in classical times to discover hidden objects\nof value !J That wands were used by Scythians and Germans in various methods\nof casting lots is certain; but that is not the same thing as the working of the\ntwig. Cicero speaks of a fabled wand by which wealth can be procured ; but ho\nsays nothing of the method of its use, and possibly was only thinking of the rod\nof Hermes, as described in the Homeric hymn already quoted. There was a sattira,\nwritten by Varro, called Viryula Vivina; fragments remain, but throw no light on\nthe subject. A passage usually quoted from Seneca has no more to do with the\ndivining rod than with the telephone. Pliny is a writer extremely fond of\nmarvels; yet when he describes the various modes of fmding wells of water, he\nsays nothing about the divining wand. The isolated texts from Scripture which\nare usually referred to clearly indicate wands of a different sort.\"\u2014Custom and\nMyth, p. 182.\ni Other terms used in old time for the divining rod were Aaron's rod, Moses'\nrod, and Jacob's rod. A work on the divining rod was published m Lyons in 1693,\nand an English translation called Jacob's Rod has been made by a Mr. Welton.\nThe fact that the divining rod was in old times often called \" Moses' rod \"\ndoubtless arose from the description given in the book of Exodus of Moses obtaining\nwater in the wilderness by means of his rod, irreverent persons concluding he had\nlearnt the use of the divining rod whilst in Egypt.\n'-' In physical science the termination \" scope \" (fir. o-itojrftv to view) is restricted\nto instruments which reveal or detect a hidden object or force, and do not measure the\namount of the force, e.g., magnetoscope, electroscope, etc. The word GryptoMopc\u2014\ninstrument for showing hidden things,\u2014is for some reasons preferable to autoscope,\nbut it has already been adopted by some French writers for the fluorescent screen\nused with the X-rays.\n\fXXXII.] 11\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nof which goes back at least to the fourth century;i similar to this is\n(3) a poised index, or a simple pointer, traversing the letters of the\nalphabet, (4) a pencil lightly and passively held so that it can write\non note-paper, (5) planchette, (6) a small table, or other object such\nas a chair,2 easily tilted or rotated (table-turning, etc.), (7) a passive\nliving person lightly touched by another, as in the \" willing game,\"\nwhere a hidden object is found, or a secret command obeyed by the\nquasi thought-reader, or living autoscope.\nDoubtless other autoscopes exist, or will be invented, but, however\ndifferent in detail, there are, broadly speaking, only two distinct kinds,\n(a) those wherein the indicator is in stable or neutral equilibrium, as\nthe pendule or planchette, and where a succession of ideas may be\nconveyed by a series of uninterrupted movements, (\/3) those wherein\nthe indicator, or the muscular system of the person using the indicator,\nis in a \" sensitive \" state, i.e., one of balanced strain or unstable\nequilibrium.3 Here a slight impulse, or nervous stimulus, may pro\nduce a profound effect, the displacement not being in the least\nproportional to the force that initiated it. Autoscopes of this\nclass, which convey only a single idea, require to be restored to\ntheir initial condition by an independent operation, before a second\ndisplacement can occur or a second idea be conveyed. I shall show\nlater on that, if rightly held, the forked dowsing or divining rod\nbelongs to this class. It is in this class we should expect to find\nthat any sense perceptions, which are too faint to excite con\nsciousness, would probably reveal themselves.\nHere permit a brief digression. Our conscious personality speaks\nthrough various voluntary muscular movements, ideas chiefly express\ning themselves in articulate language. The large unconscious back\nground of our personality always speaks through involuntary muscular\nmovements, to which ordinarily we give no heed, though these\nmovements are ever going on within us, and if external are generally\nimperceptible. Now if reasoning, as we know it, cannot exist without\nlanguage, which need not be speech but some form of expression, then\nautoscopes furnish a means whereby the hidden part of our personality,\nthe dumb partner of our life, can reason and outwardly express itself ;\nFor a modern illustration of the use of the pcndulc, see the Reminiscence} of the\nlate Mrs. De Morgan, p. 214.\n- Juanita was the name given to a chair in Guadaloupe in 1853, which composed\nprose and poetry after the manner of planchette. \" Les oauvres litteraires de la\nchaise,\" are set forth in a brochure published at the Government printing office in\nGtiadaloupe, in 1853.\n' In the region of physics, an inverted cone, a Rupert's drop or a sensitive\nflame are familiar examples of bodies either in unstable or pe,ised equilibrium.\n\f12 [PART\nProfessor W.

Interpreted on the one hand as the play\nof a wonderful occult force, science has refused to have anything to do\nwith phenomena which seem to obey no physical laws, but are capricious\nand self-determined. Interpreted on the other, truly enough, as the\nexhibition of a free and intelligent agent, some infernal or discarnate\nspirit has been fixed upon as the cause, and a fictitious authority\nfor which there is no warrant has been given to their indications.\nWhether in any case these intelligent automatic movements exhibit\ninformation outside the memory, either active or latent, of the\nindividual who uses the autoscope ; or a knowledge beyond that\nwhich may have been unconsciously derived from those present by\nsign-reading or thought-transference, is a problem which can only be\nsolved so as to gain general acceptance by long and patient enquiry, of\nwhich our Proceedings are an earnest, and to which this monograph may\nafford a small contribution.\nPart II.\nThe literature of the divining rod is extensive, and several modern\nwriters have given historical outlines of this subject. But upon\ncomparing these accounts it soon became evident that they were all,\nmore or less, drawn from some earlier historian. I therefore devoted\npart of two summer vacations to a thorough historical examination of\nthis subject, and thanks to the valuable libraries to which I have had\naccess in London, Liverpool, and Dublin, I venture to hope that the\nhistorical survey appended to this paper is somewhat more complete\nand exact than its predecessors. In connection with this part of my\ntask, most grateful acknowledgements are due to my friends, the Rev.\nMaxwell Close, M.A., and Mr. E.

On the So-called Divining Rod. 13\nhitherto escaped observation\u2014renders the following facts, in my\nopinion, practically certain : (1) The birthplace of the modern divining\nor dowsing rod is the mining districts of Germany, probably the Harz\nmountains. Germany is the home of mining, and the most approved\nprocesses were in use there prior to elsewhere. (2) The first record of\nthe use of the dowsing rod was for mining purposes and dates from\nlate in the loth or early in the 16th century, though it must have been\nin use for at least a generation before this. Its introduction was\ncoincident with, and perhaps a symptom of, that great movement\nof thought in Germany when tradition began to give way to reason,\nand superstition to the observation of nature. (3) The use of the\ndowsing rod for finding mineral veins was introduced into England,\nby German miners, at the latter part of the 16th century, and early\nin the 17th century its use in Cornwall for mining is noticed by\nsome English writers. (4) The employment of a rod for finding\nunderground water possibly began in Germany, but at least a century\nlater than its use in mining. At the present time the dowsing rod\nis far more in use for the former purpose (water-finding) than for the\nlatter. (5) The use of the rod in the \" moral world,\" for detecting\ncriminals, etc., was a phase which arose towards the end of the\n17th century and quickly passed away ; its use for this purpose (but\nthis only) being condemned by a decree of the Inquisition in 1701.\n(6) To A. Kircher and G. Schott, about 1660, we owe the theory of\nunconscious muscular action as the explanation of the pendule,\ne.cploratenr, which they connect (but obscurely) with the motion of the\ndivining rod. By Malebranche and Lebrun in 1692 the importance of\nthe prior intention of the diviner as to the object of search was first\npointed out.\nPostponing to the conclusion a detailed account of the early history of\nthis subject, it will be convenient, before entering upon an examina\ntion of the evidence on behalf of a dowsing faculty and how far it is of\npractical value, to give an outline of what has been written on the\nsubject in comparatively modern times, that is, since the first scientific\ninvestigation of the question by Dr. Thouvenel a century ago.\nModern Literature on this Subject.\nThe standard treatise on the subject is usually considered to be a\nwork by M. Chevreul, entitled La Baguette Divinatoire, Paris, 1854.i\nThe immediate cause of Chevreul's treatise was a paper presented to\nthe French Academy of Sciences, in March, 1853, by a M. Riondet,\n> Chevreul, as is well known, was a distinguished French chemist, the author\nof numerous scientific papers on colour and the artistic and industrial applications\nof chemistry. He died in 1889 at the age of 103 years, retaining his faculties and\nindustry almost to the last.\n\f14 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nentitled Sur la baguette divinatoire employee a la recherche des eaux\nsouterraines. As usual in such cases, the Academy ordered a report\non this paper to be made, and nominated for this purpose three\neminent scientific members of its body, MM. Chevreul, Boussingault,\nand Babinet. M. Chevreul was requested by his colleagues to draw up\nthe report, which led to the publication of his book on the subject.\nThe author states he found it impossible to dissociate the movement of\nthe baguette from that of the pendule explorateur and table-turning;\nthese subjects therefore occupy a considerable part of his work.\n(Meanwhile M. Riondet's paper seems to have been forgotten, for it is\nnot discussed by Chevreul and no publication nor summary of it, \u2014nor\nof a subsequent paper which M. Riondet sent in,\u2014was made in the\nComptes Rendus of the Academy). Chevreul's book was certainly\nuseful in drawing attention to, and examining, a wide-spread belief\nwhich hitherto had not been seriously discussed by any writer of\nrecognised scientific position. But its importance has, I think, been\nlargely over-rated ; it was believed to be the first attempt to give\na rational explanation of the movement of the rod ; but this is an\nerroneous belief ; as Kircher, I find, anticipated Chevreul by two\ncenturies. Chevreul is content with the popular view that the indica\ntions afforded by the rod are always fallacious ; h;;nce he gives no\nmodern evidence of its success or failure, and makes no experimental\nexamination for himself. The historical portion of his book up to the\nyear 1700 is also largely derived from a remarkably learned but little\nknown work by Father Pierre Lebrun, S.J., entitled Histoire Critique\ndes Pratiques Snperstitieuses, etc., Paris, 1702, a work I shall have\noccasion to refer to later on. Lebrun was evidently a man of great\nintellectual power and wide reading, and I do not wonder at Chevreul\ndedicating his treatise to the memory of this erudite Jesuit.i\nSubsequent writers (with one or two rare exceptions, such as\nMr. A. Lang), have been content with copying Chevreul, often at\nsecond or third hand. The Rev. S. Baring-Gould, for example\u2014\nwhose interesting and lengthy article on the divining rod in\nCurious Myths of the Middle Ages, London, 1868, is probably the\nbest known essay on the subject to English readers,\u2014appears\nentirely iudebted to a recent popular and excellent French author,\nM. Louis Figuier,2 though he does not acknowledge the source of\ni Some ten years prior to the publication of Lebrun's Hiltoire, etc , the Abbe de\nVallemont published a work called La Physique Occultt, on traiU dc la Baguette\nDitinatoirc ; the latter part of this work contains an even fuller historical review of\nthe subject than that given by Lebrun, who, in his turn, had doubtless borrowed\nlargely from De Vallemont. I shall return to De Vallemont'a work in the historical\nreview at the end of this paper.\n- Not primarily to Chevreul, as Mr. Lang suggests in his Custom and Myth,\npage 188. Why does Mr. Lang always write \"Chevreuil \" ?\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Hod. 15\nhis information. M. Figuier's work is called Histoire du Merveilleux\ndam lea temps modemes, Paris, 1860, and half of the second volume\nis devoted to the divining rod. Though Figuier relies on De\nVallemont for most of his historical data and on Chevreul for his\ntheory of the rod, yet his work is by far the best memoir on our\nsubject that has yet appeared ; he makes, however, no attempt to\ncollect or discuss evidence of the practical value, or otherwise, of\nthe rod.\nPerhaps the most extraordinary medley ever put together on the\ndivining rod is an article by Professor Fiske, of Harvard, called the\n\" Descent of Fire,\" in his interesting volume, Myths and Myth-makers,\nthe 18th edition of which is dated 1893. Having once met a \"water\nfinder\" whom he promptly proved to be a rogue by showing that the\nrod would not move when he (Professor Fiske) used it, and having\nread that \" learned author,\" Mr. Baring-Gould, Professor Fiske feels\nhimself qualified to clear up the subject. Accordingly he tells us\nthat as the divining rod \" has been used in Europe from time\nimmemorial,\" and as \" the one thing essential about it is that it shall\nbe forked,\" it is obvious that its origin, \" hopeless as the problem\nmay at first sight seem,\" is \" nevertheless solved : \"\u2014it is, he says,\nunquestionably the wooden incarnation of forked lightning ! There\nwas, however, he finds subsequently, \"one exception to this rule of a\nforked rod, and if any further evidence be needed to convince the\nmost sceptical that the divining rod is nothing but a symbol of the\nlightning, that exception will furnish such evidence.\" i ! So much for\n\" myths and myth-makers.\"\nMr. A. Lang has a capital though brief essay on the rod in his\nCustom and Myth, London, 2nd edition, 1885 (a reprint of an article\nwhich appeared in the Cornhill Magazine for January, 1883). I am\nglad to find that the view already expressed as to the irrelevancy of\ndiscussing rhabdomancy in connection with our present subject has the\nsupport of Mr. Lang ; every other writer follows the lead given by\nFather Lebruu, and mixes up these two entirely distinct questions. I\nhave already quoted from Dr. Mayo's excellent essay on the rod\ncontained in his book on Popular Superstitions; this essay originally\nappeared in Blackwood's Magazine for February, 1847, under the nam\nde plume of \" Mac Davies,\" and was copied into Littell's Living Aye\nof April the same year.\nOne of the latest scientific essays on our subject is the paper by\nDr. Rossiter Raymond of New York, read before the American\nInstitute of Mining Engineers, and already mentioned on p. 5. This\nl It need hardly be said that Professor Fiske's alleged facts are as mythical as\nthe origin he claims for the rod, which is based on Dr. Kuhn'3 work, Die Herab-\nk,tnst des Feuers.\n\f1G Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nis a serious and thoughtful attempt to investigate the subject ; con\ntemporary evidence, though not adduced, has been considered by the\nauthor, and his conclusion has already been stated. The bulk of his\npaper is historical, and this part, as Dr. Raymond frankly says, is\nderived from Chevreul and Figuier. The same parentage is traceable\nin other writers, to whom I need not refer. An exception to this rule\nis the excellent, though brief, article on the divining rod in the\nPenny, now the English, Cyclopedia ; the only English encyclopaedia\nI can find that contains anything of value on this subject. One or\ntwo historical references to the rod occur at the end of the article\nHazel in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\nDe Quincey has several references to dowsers and dowsing, or\njowsing, as he terms it, in his writings. Thus, in Modern Superstitions,\nhe writes :\u2014\nThere are in England (especially in Somersetshire) a class of men who\npractise the Pagan rhabdomancy in a limited souse. They carry a rod or\nrhabdos (pafibos) of willow : this they hold horizontally ; and by the\nbending of the rod towards the ground, they discover the favourable places\nfor sinking wells ; a matter of considerable importance in a province so ill-\nwatered as the northern district of Somersetshire. These people are called\njowsers [doiosers\"]. The experimental evidences of a real practical skill in\nthese men, and the enlarged compass of speculation in these days, have led\nmany enlightened people to a stoic fVoyij, or suspension of judgment, on\nthe reality of this somewhat mysterious art.\nIn a foot-note to this passage De Quincey says :\u2014\nFor twenty miles round Wrington, in Somersetshire, the birth-place of\nLocke, nobody sinks for wells without their [the dowsers'] advice. I myself\nknew an amiable Scottish family, who, at an estate called Belmaduthie, in\nmemory of a similar property in Ross-shire, built a house in Somersetshire,\nand resolved to find water without the help of the \"jowser. \" But after\nsinking to a greater depth than ever had been known before, and spending a\nlarge sum of money, they were finally obliged to consult the jowser, who\nfound water at once.\nAgain, in his Confessions of an Opium Eater, page 84, De Quincey\nspeaks of the value of \"jowsing \" to the inhabitants of Somersetshire,\nand remarks :\u2014\nI have myself not only seen the process tried with success, but have\nwitnessed the enormous trouble, delay, and expense accruing to those of the\nopposite faction who refused to benefit by this art. To pursue the tentative\nplan (i.e., the plan of boring for water at haphazard) ended, so far as I was\naware, in multiplied vexation. In reality, these poor men are, after all,\nmore philosophic than those wdio scornfully reject their services. For the\nartists obey unconsciously the logic of Lord Bacon : they build upon a long\nchain of induction, upon the uniform results of their life-long experience.\nBut the counter-faction do not deny this experience ; all they have to allege\nis that, agreeably to any laws known to themselves, d priori, there ought not\n\fxxxn.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 17\nto be any such experience. Now, a sufficient course of facts overthrows all\nantecedent plausibilities. Whatever science or scepticism may say, most of\nthe tea-kettles in the Vale of Wrington are filled by rhabdomancy.\nAmong English scientific works the only one I can find that gives\nan account of the dowsing rod is the great treatise on British Mining,\npublished in 1884, by the late Robert Hunt, F.R.S., keeper of the\nMining Records. The author treats the indications of the rod as\nillusory, but devotes considerable space to quotations showing the\nuse of the rod, taken from Agricola's work on mining of the 16th\ncentury, and Pryce's well-known folio on Cornish mining of the 18th\ncentury ; these works are fully noticed in the Historical Survey\nappended to this research.\nThe English scientific societies have as a rule given the subject a\nwide berth.i Nevertheless, a few stray papers on the divining rod are\nto be found in their Proceedings. Thus, to go back to 1814, the\nTransactions of the Geological Society, Vol. II., contain illustrations\nof the practical use of the rod in a paper by Mr. W. Phillips, who had\nalso previously contributed an interesting article on the subject to\nTUloch's Philosophical Magazine for 1801, Vol. XIII. The Quarterly\nMining Review for 1830 has also a lengthy article on the dowsing rod,\nseveral instances being given of its successful use in the discovery of\nmineral lodes, the same spot being indicated even when the dowser was\nblindfolded. In the Proceedings of the British Association for 1875,\nMiss A. W. Buckland alludes to the divining rod in a paper on\nRhabdomancy, but is evidently mistaken in the origin to which she\ntraces the rod ; in a letter Miss Buckland contributes to the\nStandard newspaper for January 3rd, 1889, she gives a striking\ninstance of the practical value of the rod in finding water, the spot\nindicated by the dowsing rod yielding a good water supply on a well\nbeing sunk, whereas close by a well sunk to a greater depth was quite\ndry. The numerous other similar cases I shall be able to cite render\nit less probable that this is a case of mere chance coincidence. In the\nProceedings of the Bristol Naturalist's Society for 1874, Messrs. Tawney\nand Pass relate experiments with a dowser finding hidden coins, and\nthey attempt to explain away the considerable degree of success\nattained, but the result was probably due to unconscious indications\ngiven by the spectators, or to true thought-transference ; when both\nof these are excluded the failure of such experiments is invariable\nand complete, as will be shown in the course of this paper. Experi\nments of this kind are misleading, as they have really nothing to do\ni In the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for 1606 (Vol. I., p. 333)\nwill be found a question by the Hon. Robert Boyle as to whether the virtjula divina\nis of use in finding mineral veins. This famous philosopher devotes some space to the\ndivining rod in his Philosophical Essays, as will be seen in the concluding part.\nC\n\f18 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nwith whatever peculiar faculty the dowser may possess for detecting\nunderground springs or veins of ore. In the Proceedings of the same\nSociety for 1884 is a paper by a distinguished geologist, Prof.\nSollas, F.R.S., on the result of the experiments he made at the\nrequest of the S.P.R. to test a dowser at Locking, Somerset. The\nsubstance of this paper appeared in Vol. II. of our own Proceedings.\nProf. Sollas arrives at a conclusion adverse to the dowser, but, with\nall deference, I venture to submit that a more inconclusive paper has\nrarely been published by a scientific authority. In the Proceedings\nof the Bath Natural History Society and Field Club for 1889, Vol. VI.,\nis a lengthy paper on the dowsing rod by Mr. Forder Plowman ;\nseveral cases of more or less evidential value are quoted by the\nauthor, who is a warm believer in the indications afforded by the rod.\nAt the Folk Lore Congress in 1891, Miss M. R. Cox read a paper on\ndowsing, which is published in their Proceedings, and in the Wiltshire\nNotes and Queries for 1893. The paper deals with a dowser, W. Stokes,\nand relates some remarkable successes which had attended his practice.\nA good picture is given showing the method of holding the rod\nemployed by Stokes in dowsing.\nIn 1853 a Mr. F. Phippen published a brochure entitled, Narrative\nof practical experiments proving to demonstration the discovery of water,\ncoal, and minerals in the earth by means of the dowsingfork or divining\nro,l. Mr. Phippen being on a visit to Somersetshire heard and saw so\nmuch of the practical use of dowsing that he wrote a full report of\nhis enquiries in the Morning Chronicle and Morning Advertiser of\nNovember loth, 1844. He gives many facts that came under his\nown observation, and quotes some cases of evidential value that I\nhave included in the subsequent record of experiments. An excellent\nfrontispiece, by A. Crowquill, shows a \" dowser \" at work, the flexed\narms being held tightly to the sides of the body, and the prongs of the\nfork (which is of larger size than those now generally used) passing\nbetween the index and the next finger of each hand. This is not the\nmethod of holding used by Stokes, pictured by Miss Cox ; in fact at\nthe present day the method of holding the rod varies with the\nindividual dowser.\nA nother method of holding the forked twig is described in a little\nbook on the divining rod, written by two amateur dowsers, Messrs.\nYoung and Robertson, of Llanelly, South Wales, and recently published.\nThis brochure is not in any sense a critical or scientific production,\nbut it is of interest as presenting the experience of two men who are\nenthusiastic believers in the practical value of the rod, and have at\nconsiderable self-sacrifice freely given their neighbours the benefit of\nthe peculiar faculty which they, in common with other successful\ndowsers, appear to possess. A straight rod, as well as a forked twig,\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divinivg Rod. 19\nand even a tiny (waistcoat pocket) fork of aluminium, are used\nindifferently by Messrs. Young and Robertson.i\nNotes and Queries contain frequent references to the divining\nrod. By far the most useful are two papers by Mr W. Bates of\nBirmingham (Notes and Queries, Vol. X., 1854, pp. 449 and 467).\nMr. Bates gives some valuable bibliographical memoranda which I\nhave not found in any other writer and to which I refer those who\nare interested.2\nThe subject of the divining rod was discussed and several\nwell-authenticated cases quoted in the Standard newspaper during\nthe last week of 1838, and the first of 1889. A still longer dis\ncussion took place in the Mining Journal for 1875, to which reference\nwill again be made. From time to time ephemeral articles on the\ndivining rod are to be found in magazines, etc., to which it is needless\nto refer ; a list of these will be found in Poole's Index to Periodical\nLiterature.\nIn the United States the American Journal of Science (Silliman's\nJournal), the leading and authoritative American scientific journal,\ncontains a capital paper on the rod by (the Rev.) Ralph Emerson,\nin 1821,3 and a long and able discussion of the subject in 1826.\nI shall return to these. There are also papers on the rod and\nits use in finding oil springs, as well as water and mineral veins, in\nother American magazines of more recent date ; notably a lengthy\narticle in the Democratic Review for 1850, which refers to the\nuse of a new type of divining rod, or ball, similar to the pendule\nexplorateur.\nIn 1876, Mr. Chas. Latimer, an American Civil Engineer, published\nan essay on the divining rod which contains an interesting record of\nhis own experience. Having accidentally discovered that the rod\nmoved in his own hands, he was led to try whether its indications\nwere of any practical use, and the experiments which he narrates\ni 1 have had a long correspondence with Mr. Young, who has given me many\ninstances of his success in dowsing for water. I may add that, though self-taught,\nand with few opportunities, Mr. Young has devised and carried out some extremely\ninteresting and novel experiments in electricity.\n2 Every series of Hotel and Queries, except the third, contains much useful\ninformation on the divining rod.

The involuntary movement of the forked\ntwig enabled him to discover underground springs in places where his\nconscious experience and judgment would not have led him to locate\nthem. He also arrived at a method of estimating theii depth below\nthe surface. I will quote the evidence of an eye-witness to Mr.\nLatimer's powers later on. I have before me numerous cuttings from\nAmerican newspapers which illustrate the fact that \" water-witching,\"\nas they call it, is in considerable vogue in certain parts of the United\nStates.\nOn the Continent the old province of Dauphiny corresponds to our\nSomersetshire as regards the esteem in which the divining rod is held\nand the number of \"diviners \" for which it has been remarkable ; they\nwere known by the name of tourneurs, or more frequently sourciers.\nIt was in Dauphiny that the charity boy Bleton was born, and at the\nage of seven years found he could successfully discover underground\nsprings and streams by means of the divining rod. In the year 1780\na distinguished physician, Dr. Thouvenel, having heard of Bleton,\nsent for him, and was so struck with the simplicity of the lad and his\nfrank demeanour, that he determined to see what truth there was in\nhis alleged powers. The result was a prolonged investigation, which\nsatisfied Thouvenel that the lad had the power imputed to him, and he\npublished a short treatise on the subject, entitled Ifimoire Physique et\nMedicinal, montrant ties rapports evidens enlre les pheiwmhtes de la\nBaguette divinatoire, du MaynMsme el del' Electricite\", etc., Paris, 1781.\nThree years later, M. Thouvenel, whose adherence to Bletonxsme,, as it\nwas called, had drawn on him a host of antagonists, published a\nSecond Memoire Physique, etc., Paris, 1784, giving affidavits regarding\nHilton's discoveries, and a narrative of his experiments with Bleton\n>md another Dauphiny youth, named Pennet, whom he found similarly\nendowed.i Thouvenel was the first to submit the alleged claims of\nthe divining rod to systematic scientific investigation, and though his\nwork is to some extent vitiated by the erroneous theory which\npervades it, still it is fair and scientific in tone, and animated by the\nspirit of the true philosopher, who, as Laplace has well said, \" should\nnot deny any phenomena merely because in the actual state of our\nknowledge they are inexplicable.\" The best summary of Thouvenel's\ntreatise will be found in the Monthly Review for 1781 et seq., appendix\nto Vols. 65, 67, and 71 ; a briefer account is given by Dr. Ashburner\nin his English edition of Reichenbach's Researches, p. 96 et seq., and\ni The author of these works was well known to be Dr. Thouvenel, although on the\ntitle page of both is only put \" par M.

In addition to some 600 experiments with Bleton, Thouvenel\nsent circulars to all he could find who had employed the lad to\ndiscover water, etc , and obtained a multitude of testimonies of his\nsuccess\u2014often when all other means had failed\u2014from learned and\ncritical persons as well as others. Two savants, M. Jadelot, Professor\nof Medicine at Nancy, and M. Sigaud de Lafond, then took up the\nmatter, and after numerous experiments joined Thouvenel in ardent\nsupport of Bleton's mysterious powers.\nThouvenel, having moved his residence to Italy, invited several\ndistinguished savants of that country to test his new sourcier Pennet,\nwhom he brought with him. Amongst those that responded was\nSpallanzani, who, whilst astonished at what he saw, did not consider\nthe experiments conclusive, and finally decided against the reality of\nthe indications of the rod, as a new form of \" hydroscope.\" In the\nMemoires by Fortis, 1802, quoted by Chevreul, the discussion is\ncontinued, and several other \" sensitives \" are named by the author\nwho could find underground water by the peculiar sensations they\nexperienced.\nFew more instructive instances of the effect of prejudice on scientific\njudgment could be found than in this famous discussion a century ago.\nThus the astronomer Lalande, in a letter to the Juurnal des Savants,\nfor August, 1782, denies Baton's power, and asserts that the baguette\nturns merely by the adroitness with which Bleton handles it. He then\nproceeds to demonstrate the roguery of Bl\u00e9ton by showing that an\nalmost imperceptible muscular effort can cause a curved twig (such as\nBleton generally used) to rotate when resting on the fingers. Othei-\nscientific men took the same line, and when a mannikin was made\nwhich, by mechanism, could turn the baguette like Bleton did, the\nproof appeared complete ; after this believers like Thouvenel could only\nbe fools or knaves ! Others again demonstrated Thouvenel's electrical\ntheory of the rotation of the baguette to be baseless, and hence con\ncluded that the facts themselves had no foundation. All these savants,\nstarting with the a priori conclusion that the alleged facts were im\npossible, did not consider it necessary to examine the evidence as to the\nfacts, and, moreover, they appeared to forget that Bleton often used\nno baguette at all, and always regarded it merely as a visible index to\n\f22 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nsome internal spasm that seized him in the vicinity of underground\nsprings.i This strange physiological effect, of the genuineness of\nwhich Dr. Thouvenel satisfied himself, was still more marked ten\nyears earlier in the case of Parangue, a little girl who from infancy\nwas thrown into convulsions when brought over running water\nor underground springs ; hence she was constantly used as a\n\" hydroscope,\" the Abbes Sauri- and de la Roquette testifying to\nthe facts and giving minute descriptions of the effects produced on\nthe child.\nIn Fortis' Me'moires pour servir a Phistoire naturelle, (fcc., several\nItalian hydroscopes or dowsers are referred to, one a child, 10 years\nold, named Anfossi ; another more notable was Campetti, who was\ntaken to Munich, in 1806, to have his water-finding powers tested.\nAmoretti, who relates the facts in an essay on Rhabdomancy, states\nthat several of his own relatives had the gift of using the rod and\nfinding water by its means.\nThe next conspicuous French work on this subject is by the Count de\nTristan, entitled Bee\/torches sur quefques efflsuves terrestres, Paris, 1826.\nCount Tristan states that he was led to undertake the investigation of\nthe divining rod by witnessing the remarkable performance of the rod\nin the hands of a personal friend. Upon experimenting with different\npeople he found, in spite of his incredulity, five others had the same\nfaculty, and to his astonishment discovered that he himself possessed\nit. For some years he had no leisure to investigate the matter, but\nultimately in 1822 he commenced a long series of experiments, from\n1,500 to 1,800 in number, and which occupied him nearly 15 months ;\n\"The results,\" M. Tristan states, \"of 1,200 experiments were written\ndown at the time of their performance.\" Dr. Mayo, F.R.tS., in his\nTruths Contained in Popular Superstitions, p. 7 el seq, gives a sum\nmary of Tristan's work, and so does Chevreul. I have not myself seen\nTristan's book, but there is no doubt he was an enthusiastic believer in\nthe rod. Unfortunately his experiments are of little value, except as\nillustrations of the effect of sub-conscious suggestion on the rod, an effect\ndue to the dominance of a theory which he endeavoured to establish.\nThis theory was that electric effluvia were given off by various sub\nstances ; the bodies of certain persons conducted this effluvia, which\nthereby passing down their arms caused a turning of the forked divin\ning rod\u2014this he names the furcelle (from furcilla),\u2014or a rotation of\nthe straight rod, which he calls the bacillogive (from baciUum and\niIn spite of the weight of scientific authority arrayed against Bleton, a few\nsavants carefully tested the youth, and had the courage to publish a statement of the\nsuccessful results they obtained. I will refer to this when dealing with the evidence\non behalf of Bleton later on ; there can be no doubt that he was one of the most\nremarkable \" dowsers\" of whom we have any record.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 23\ngyrus). It is a pity so much industry was wasted from the want of\nan elementary knowledge of physics.\nIn 1849 a M. Mortillet published a little book called llisloire de\nI hydroscopic et de la baguette divinatoire, in which he reviews the\nexperiments of Thouvenel and others, and claims that he himself was\nan expert with the baguette. He became, in fact, a professional\n\" dowser,\" but owns that he was not always successful, and ultimately\nabandoned this calling, studied art, and was appointed sub-director of\nthe museum at St. Germain\nIn 1863 was published a quarto volume written by the\nAbb\u00e9 Carrie, called Hydroscopographie et Melalloscopographie, ow\nI'arl de dicouvrir les eaux soulerraines et les gisements metalli\/eres.\nThis is an ambitious attempt to convert the divining rod into a\nscientific instrument and to explain its motion by an application of\nAmpere's well-known laws of electro-dynamics. The Abbe was him\nself an expert water-finder or hydroscopist, and the introduction to\nhis book contains abundant testimonies to his success in finding\nwater springs ; but his explanation of the motion of the rod is hope\nlessly wrong, as was the very similar attempt to explain it given by\nDr. Thouvenel a century ago ; electricity is still believed to be the\ncause of the motion of the rod by the majority of dowsers and others\nignorant of physics at the present day. The Abbe Paramelle was\nanother famous Hydroscopist in 1830, and so was the Abbe Jacquet\na little later (see Carriers book, and the Journal d Agriculture Pratique\nfor April, 1845); but both Paramelle and Jacquet claimed to be and\nwere hydro-geologists and rejected the use of the rod ; a 4th and revised\nedition of Paramelle's L' Art de dicouvrir les Sources was issued in\n1S96 (see Appendix B).\nSeveral French encyclopaedias refer fully to this subject. Under\nthe heading Baguette, is a lengthy article in Larousse's Dictionnaire\nUniversel du XIXe siecle. Under the same heading in the Dictionnaire\n,les Merveilles de la Nature the writer gives some illustrations of the\nsuccessful use of the rod he himself had observed, and states that two\npersons who tried could not stop the rod when it turned. Under the\nword Abaris there is an article, chiefly on J. Aymar and the rod, in\nBayle's Dictionnaire ; but this is not modern, for the first edition of\nthis dictionary goes back to 1710. All these are useful historical essays,\nbut throw no fresh light on the subject. There are also various essays\non the divining rod in French periodical literature. I have read many\nof these going back to 1740, when an excellent, though brief, discussion\nof the subject, with some striking evidence, appeared in a little work\ncalled Caprices de I'Imagination.\nModern German, Spanish and Italian literature I have not yet\nbeen able to examine.\n\f24 [paut\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nPart III.\nTHE DIVINING ROD AS USED IN THE SEARCH FOR\nUNDERGROUND WATER.\nLet us now examine what evidence exists on behalf of dowsing ;\ni.e., of a special faculty, peculiar to certain individuals, by which they\nbelieve they are enabled to locate the position of mineral lodes or\nunderground springs. Though the search for metallic veins by dowsing\nis the older, yet the dowser is now mainly in request as a \" water-\nfinder,\" and as the evidence now obtainable is much more abundant for\nthis latter use of the rod, I will take this part of my subject first, and,\nso far as possible, subsequently deal with the use of the rod in finding\nmetallic ores.\nAn attempt to arrive at some general laws which will furnish an\nadequate explanation of the varied phenomena presented by the\ndivining rod both in ancient and modern times, will be made after the\nfirst and larger portion of the evidence has been presented. Mean\nwhile it will be obvious from the evidence cited in Group I. that\u2014\nThe movement of the rod is not due to trickery, nor any conscious\nvoluntary effort, but is a more or less violent automatic action that\noccurs tinder certain conditions in certain individuals.\nThose who have ever seen a successful dowser at work will not\nneed to be convinced of this statement. So vigorous is the motion\nof the twig that one of its limbs is frequently twisted off in the effort\nto restrain it, and yet there is often little or no sign of muscular\nexertion on the dowser's part. Sometimes a violent tremor convulses\nthe arms and even the whole body of the dowser when he comes over\nan underground spring, or what he believes to be such. A striking\ninstance of this is to be seen in the case of Mr. Lawrence, cited in\nGroup III., and also in the case of Mr. Young, senr., mentioned later.\nThe cause of this muscular storm, and the physiological aspect of\ndowsing in general, are worthy of attention, but are matters with\nwhich the trained physiologist must deal. In no case is the dowser\nconscious of having exerted any muscular action in turning the\nrod, and thereupon naturally ascribes its motion to some influence\nexternal to himself. It is, in fact, almost impossible to imitate its\ncharacteristic movement by any voluntary effort. Hence nothing but\nsheer ignorance leads any one to assert, as does an English geologist in\na letter now before me, that \" the whole thing is a fraud, and the\nmotion of the forked twig a bit of clever legerdemain.\" i Nor is\nany evidence, however conclusive it may appear to others, likely to\ni There are, no doubt, counterfeit dowsers, as there are counterfeit sovereigns,\nbut it is needless to waste any time over them.\n\fXXXII.] 25\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\naffect those who approach the study of a novel subject with such a\ndetermined parti-pris.\nGroup I.\u2014Amateur Dowsers.\nThe first group of evidence I will cite is obtained from those who\ncannot be suspected of making use of the \" rod \" for the purpose of\ngain or trickery. This evidence also shows that success has attended\nthe practical use of the rod in finding water springs, but in several of\nthe cases given below, data are wanting to show how far the success in\nthese cases exceeds that due to chance.\nTo arrive at some estimate whether underground water might or\nmight not be found by chance sinking at any spot in the places named,\nI consulted a high geological authority,\u2014my colleague, Professor Cole,\nF.G.S., etc.\u2014who kindly went into this question for several of these\nlocalities, chosen at random ; as far as his personal knowledge and the\ngeological maps would allow. Professor Cole sent me his report before\nseeing any of the letters here given, so that it was an entirely indepen\ndent opinion, based on geological grounds. In some of the cases,\nProfessor Cole reports that spring water might be found anywhere\nand near the surface;i in some, only by sinking to a considerable\ndepth ; but in others, Professor Cole reports the chances of finding a\nspring (not surface water) were extremely small unless a very deep well\nwas sunk. As I do not rely on this group of cases for any conclusive\nevidence as to the existence, or not, of a dowsing faculty, it is hardly\nnecessary to discuss the question of chance success farther at this point.\nIt is worthy of note that, in many of these cases, wells had been sunk\nfruitlessly before the advent of the \" dowser,\" who was in every case\nan amateur, that is one who had no professional object to serve in\nmaking the experiment. It will also be noticed that a \"dowsing\nfaculty,\" if such there be, is not confined to any particular age, sex or\nclass in life. Thus in case No. 1, the dowser was a clergyman; in\nNo. 2, a judge ; in No. 3, a local manufacturer; in Nos. 4, 13, 14, 18,\nand 19, a lady ; in Nos. 5 and 9, a gardener ; in No. 6, a deputy-\nlieutenant ; in No. 8, a respected member of the Society of Friends;\nin No. 12, a miller; in No. 10, a little girl; in Nos. 11 and 15,\na boy ; in No. 20, a French Count, etc.\nNo. 1.\u2014The following case was sent by Miss Grantham :\u2014\n100, Eaton-square, London, S.W., February 1st, 1893.\nMy father (Judge Grantham) was going to dig a well on one of his\nfarms. The Rev. J. Blunt was then residing in our parish, and as he had\ni Such, for example, as No. 10, though even here it will be seen that the Vicar of\nLugwardine states that two wells were sunk before the dowser's visit, and no water\nfound.\n\f26 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\npreviously told us he was able to discover the presence of water underground\nby means of a twig, we asked him to go with us one day to see if he could\nfind water. Mr. B. began by cutting a twig out of the hedge, of hazel or\nblackthorn, V shaped, each side about 8 inches long, then taking hold of one\nend in each hand between the thumb and first finger, and pointing the angle\nto the ground, he walked about the field in which my father proposed digging a\nwell, and at two spots the point of the twig turned right up exactly reversing\nits previous position ; in fact so strong was its impulse to point upwards, that\nwe found that unless Mr. B. relaxed his hold the twig broke off near his fingers.\nWe put small sticks in these spots, and then took a boy about 12 years\nold who was in Mr. B.'s employment, and who had since quite a child shown\nthat he possessed this power, over the same ground ; he had not seen the\nspots at which Mr. B. 's twig found water, neither did we point them out to\nhim, but at these places his twig behaved in the same way as Mr. B.'s. My\nfather, mother, and four or five others then cut similar twigs out of the\nhedge, but with none of us would they divine water. My father then took\nMr. B. over some ground where he knew of the existence of an underground\nstream ; he did not tell Mr. B. this, but directly Mr. B. passed over the\nplaces the twig again turned upwards as it had done before. A well has\nsince been dug at one of the spots in the first field where the twig indicated\nwater, and it was found at the depth of 15 feet. Mr. B. and the boy both\nsaid that they did not feel any abnormal influence whatever when the twig\ndivined water. T n\ntMMA L. Grantham.\nThe following I subsequently received from the Rev. Jno. R.\nBlunt, of Bugbrooke, Weedon, Northamptonshire :\u2014\nJuly 8th, 1893.\nIn answer to your inquiries, I fear I cannot add to what has already been\ntold you. I have often tried the divining rod, to interest or amuse my\nfriends, here the matter has ended ; no trial for water has ever been made,\nexcept in the case at Barcombe (Sussex), when Sir W. Grantham sunk a\nwell at the spot indicated by the rod, and found a good supply of water near\nthe surface ; this was of interest to me, as wells there are often sunk at great\ndepth. I have found the rod move in scores of places, but have not seen it\ntested before. I moan, so far as my own experiments go. I know of several\nplaces where water has been found in this county after the rod has been\nused by Mr. Mullins.\nAs to whether it moves, as you consider, owing to \"some unconscious\nmuscular action, \" I know not. Why it should move in my hands and not\nin the hands of every one who tries it, I know not.\nI have never tried it near to any pool or river, nor by the sea. I have\nonly tried it for underground water.\nI was using the rod one evening for the amusement ot some young men\nin a garden last summer, but could not got it to move (to their great\nglee !), until at last close to the boundary wall it was agitated ; of course they\ndeclared \/ moved it, etc., etc., but a few days after I was at a friend's house\nwhose garden was on the other side of the wall, and there, to my delight, was\na well I I stopped short and said, \" Is this well of any use ? \" My friend at\n\fXXXII.] 27\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nonce said, \"It is a splendid well of water and never fails.\" ... I\nhave found the rod work equally well when wearing thick overshoes of\nrubber.\nNo. 2.\u2014His Honour Judge Spink, of British Columbia, writes as\nfollows to Mr. F. W. H. Myers :\u2014\nVernon, Okanagan, B.C., Februarg 27th, 1893.\nI see that your Society take some interest in the divining rod. We made\nsome careful tests on this matter last year. The rod works in my hands. I\nwas rather sceptical, and thought that my own mind might work in some\nunknown manner on the rod and cause it to turn down where I fancied there\nought to be water. I was blindfolded and led about with the wand, for about\nan hour at least, until I could not hold the wand upright without great pain.\nEach time the wand dipped, a peg was driven into the ground to mark the\nspot. I was walked in all directions, and passed over the same ground\nagain and again, but in no instance did the rod fail to dip when it came\nto a peg. I have sunk two wells on the credit of the wand, and in both\ninstances have found water, in both these instances contrary to the advice\nof the well-sinking experts. The power appears to increase rapidly with\nuse. When experimenting with the rod over a water hose, I had the water\nturned on and off several times, and could distinctly feel the jar that one\nhears in such cases. ,,, \u201e\nWm. Warp Spink.\nIn a subsequent letter Judge Spink writes :\u2014\nVernon, Okanagan, B.C., November 4th, 1893.\nThe divining rod has succeeded in finding me water for the third time.\nFirst well, at the foot of a rock bluff, 20 feet. Second well, half way down a\nsteep slope, about 8 feet fall in 40 feet, at 25 feet from surface. Third well,\nat the summit of slope, 100 feet at least above second well, at 85 feet from\nsurface. These experiments are not very convincing, as water seems to bo\neasily found round here. One peculiar fact, however, may interest you. I\nselected the three spots for the wells before the foundations were dug for my\nhouse. Around the foundations the wand would not act. After the wells\nwere begun, and the foundations dry, Mr. Attwoor, who has had a great\nmining experience, went over the ground with me. He told me that the\nformation of the ground would lead him to expect water where the wells\nwere being dug, but that it would be useless to dig for water where the\nfoundations were, as the ground there was drift. The foundations are 100\nfeet from well No. 2, and immediately, or only a few feet from being imme\ndiately between wells 2 and 3.\nNo. 3.\u2014The following is from the Westminster Gazette, of May 5th,\n1894:\u2014\nA remarkable instance of the successful use of the hazel twig,\ngenerally termed the \"divining rod,\" has just occurred at Cressing, near\nBraintree, Essex. Many fruitless attempts have been made in the parish\nto find water, the boring in several instances extending to great depths.\nMr. E. Sach, of Jeffrey's farm, wanted a well provided for some\n\f28 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ncottages, they being without a water supply, and he invited Mr. H. W.\nGolding, of the firm of Messrs. Ashley, Adkins and Co., mat manufac\nturers, Booking, who has acquired some skill with the \" rod,\" to look\nover the place. He did so, and near the cottages the twig turned up, and\nalthough every effort was made to keep it down it could not be done.\nMr. Golding felt certain that water could be found there, and men were\nat once set to work boring, with the result that an abundant supply of\nwater was found 22 feet below the surface.\nIn replies to my enquiries, Mr. Golding writes : \u2014\nBooking, Essex, September 16th, 1896.\nI can fully confirm the Westmhxster Gazette report you sent me, in\nreference to finding water at Cressing by the divining rod. I may add that\nuntil this experiment was made, and the well sunk, it was the general\nopinion of those who knew the locality, that no water was obtainable.\nH. W. Golding.\nIn a later letter Mr. Golding says :\u2014\nSeptember 21st.\nIn answer to your questions, I had tested the rod with my eyes blind\nfolded, and also with my arms held by four men, two holding each hand\nand arms, leaving only freedom for the rod to move. Being thus held as\ntightly as possible, the rod would still go round, and if prevented it would\nbreak with the force. n W GoLdInG.\nMr Golding has also sent me particulars of several other cases,where\nhe has been enabled to give his neighbours an abundant supply of water\nfor which they had previously searched in vain. I will only cite one\ncase of special interest.\nNo. 3a.\u2014The following is from the Daily News of May 22nd,\n1894 :\u2014\nThe divining rod has again been used in Essex with success, this\ntime on the estate of General Thompson of Wethersfield-place.near Braintree.\nSome years ago General Thompson had a field surveyed by an eminent\nengineer who, after testing the ground with boring apparatus, expressed an\nopinion that no water was obtainable there. Hearing, however, of the suc\ncess of the divining rod in the immediate neighbourhood, the General in\nvited Mr. H. W. Golding, of Booking, to walk over the field, with the result\nthat at two places which Mr. Golding marked water was found at less than 10\nfeet from the surface.\nThe Daily Telegraph of the same date, the Essex Herald, and other\nnewspapers also report this case. I wrote to General Thompson for\nparticulars, but learnt with regret that he had died since the above\nexperiments were made. His widow informs me that the newspaper\nreport is correct and that \"Mr. Golding, who was quite an amateur,\nindicated by the rod two places where springs of water would be found\non the estate, and on digging at these places water was found.\" I have\n\fXXXII.] 29\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nhad an interview with Mr. J. Wycliffe Thompson (son of General\nThompson,) who was present during the search for water at Wethers-\nfield-place, and who gives me the interesting information that his\nfather made the experiment on purpose to lest in a systematic manner\nthe value or otherwise of the indications afforded by the divining rod.\nAccordingly, in the first instance a boring was made to find water by\nadvice without the use of the rod. Mr. Thompson tells me the boring\nwas made to a considerable depth, but he does not know the exact\ndepth. No signs of water were found. Then Mr. Golding was in\nvited over, and, cutting a forked twig, traversed the ground.\nPresently the twig turned vigorously and, following its indications, he\nprofessed to trace an underground spring running not far from the\nexperimental boring to a point some 50 yards away. The course\nindicated was staked out, and, after Mr. Golding left, a well was sunk\nin two places, chosen at random on the course so marked. The result\nwas that water was found in both places at a depth of some 10 feet.\nMr. Thompson is certain the first boring was \" far deeper than this,\"\nand he tells me no doubt whatever was left in the mind of General\nThompson and others present of the reality and practical value of some\npeculiar faculty for discovering underground water afforded by the\nmovement of the rod.\nNo. 4.\u2014In the next case, which reaches me through Mr. Myers, a\nlady, Miss Douglas P., found to her surprise the rod moved in as\nmarked a manner in her hands as when it was used by a professional\ndiviner. A series of experiments were made at a country house, both\nout of doors and indoors. Amongst those who witnessed the experi\nments indoors were Mr. Scott Gatty and Miss Egerton. The former\nwrites :\u2014\n71, Warwick road, Earl's Court, S.W., March 7th, 1893.\nThe great difficulty we found was to find a place whore the rod\nwould not work ; it was forever turning round. At last two places were\nfound, one in front of the fireplace in the entrance hall, and another about\nhalfway up the stairs. While Miss D. P. went off with the rest of the party\ndown some of the passages leading out of the hall, I secreted some sovereigns\nunder the rug in front of the fireplace, and then joined the rest of the party.\nBy degrees we worked our way back into the hall, and I asked Miss P. to\ntest the hearth again, so as to make sure that the rod would not work there,\nwhen\u2014lo and behold\u2014it went round vigorously, and I then disclosed my\nhidden treasure. When that was removed, the rod refused to work again.\nI think there was nothing else very remarkable or worthy of note. The\ncause of the rod working so much in the house is that almost a river runs\nunder it. . . . In the drawing-room we hid money in the seats of\nchairs, and made Miss P. sit upon them, but if I remember rightly, she\nwas not always successful.\nScott Gatty.\n\f30 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nThe foregoing letter was sent to Miss Egerton, who replies :\u2014\nWhitwell Park, York, March 12th, 1893.\nUnfortunately the descriptions of the experiments made in the evening\ndo not coincide with my impression of the same, which is that they were\nuniformly successful. 1 being one of the sceptical ones in the party (or shall\nwe rather use the word agnostic ?) held one side of the forked stick, whilst\nMiss D. P. held the other, and as wo moved over the chairs where the\nsovereigns were hidden, the effect was most marked, the motion coming\nevidently from the stick and not from Miss D. P.'s pressure. I tried to stop\nit, and it at once broke off at the fork. As Mr. Scott Gatty says, we were\nnot thinking at the time of making any scientific investigations ; we only\nwished to prove the fact that the action of the stick was not a fraud on the\npart of Miss D.

Cork, June 19th, 1896.\nIt is quite true that I have the power of using the divining rod. I have\ndone so for some years, but have not as yet opened any well ; but as I want\nto conduct water into my garden, I hope to be able to do so in a few months'\ntime from a source a couple of fields beyond it. I can hardly quote any facts\nto you at present that would be interesting, more than to say I found a\nsource of water in a friend's grounds not many miles from this. He after\nwards employed a man who is a professional water finder, and he found the\nwater in the same place, and gave the depth below the surface as 26 feet,\nwhich I was not able to do, not having practised gauging the depth below\nthe surface, but I understand this is merely a matter of practice, and\ndepends on the force with which the rod rises in the hands.\nR. W. Aldworth.\nIn reply to my enquiries, Colonel Aldworth writes :\u2014\nNewmarket, Co. Cork, July 20th, 1896.\nIn reply to your letter of June 21st, I beg to say I have tried the\ndivining rod both with my eyes shut and open and it acts just the same in\nboth cases. I know of a young fellow who possesses the power and who had\na farm but a few miles from this. He was anxious to find water.on his ground\nand he, by means of the rod, came upon water, digged for it and found it\nabout 7 feet down, a fine spring. I have often tried the rod with my eyes\nshut, and the young man got his sister to bind his eyes in the case I mention\nand the rod indicated it in the same spot where he dug for it. I cannot in\nany way account for action of the rod ; it certainly acts with some people\nand not with others. R W, Aldworth.\nNumerous cases from Somersetshire are given in the course of this\npaper ; here are two or three. The following is an instructive case.\nNo. 7.\u2014My friend Mr. F. J. Clark, F.L.S., writes to me as follows:\u2014\nNetherleigh, Street, Somerset, September, 1896.\nSome twenty years ago an opportunity presented itself to me of testing\nthe value of the indications given by the divining rod. The then manager of\nour local gas works, Mr. Stears, found he had the power of using the rod2;\nothers in our neighbourhood also tried, and an old workman I knew well,\ni I shall return to this idea later. See also foot-note to No. 21.\n! Mr. Stears is now living in Yorkshire, and has recently devoted himself\nentirely to \"- dowsing\" (see Group VII.).\u2014W.F.B.\n\f32 [part\nProfessor W. F.

Seymour found the rod indicated water at B.\nCuriously enough a neighbour and member of our body (Society of Friends),\nWalter Wyburn, a poor-law guardian, found he also could use the rod. I\ninvited Wyburn to my place, and asked him to try where he could find.\nwater. He did so, and the rod indicated water at C ; he had no knowledge\nof what the others had done. Now it happens that a well had been sunk for\nour factory at Wl, and a good supply of water obtained at about 40 feet depth.\nAnother well, in the cellar of my house, at W2, gave us a supply of water\nat about 35 feet, and a third well at W3, on higher ground, and about 280\nfeet distance, supplied the stable yard ; this well was only about 27 feet\ndeep. We had also since sunk a well at W4, some 60 feet North of Wa, but\nhad got little or no water from it even at a depth of 50 feet. We tunnelled\nabout 20 feet in the direction of W2, and found rather.more water coming\nin. It seems, therefore, that a fault or fissure running East and West\nexisted in the strata of the Blue Lias, and along this fissure water could\nbe obtained. This conclusion is rendered very probable from the fact that,\nif we pump a large supply of water from the factory well, Wi, it completely\ndrains W-, and perceptibly affects W3. Now it was just when the three\ndowsers crossed this line the rods indicated water beneath. Their trials, as\nI have said, were made independently, and they had no knowledge of the\nposition, or (so far as I know) the existence of the wells on my place. I\nmay also mention that the late rector of the parish found he too was an\nexpert with the \" rod,\" and on trying my grounds with it he also hit upon the\nsame line of underground water, but I am not sure whether he knew of the\nother trials I have related. \u201e T\nr. J. Clark.\nNo. 8.\u2014Mr. F. J. Clark also writes to me as follows:\u2014\nNetherleigh, Street, Somerset, September, 1896.\nA few years ago I was appointed along with Walter Wyburn and the late\nA. R. Grace, of Bristol, a sub-committee of a Charitable Trust Committee\n\fxxxu.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 83\nbelonging to our religious body [the Society of Friends]. One object of this\ncommittee was to get water for a farmhouse belonging to the Trust at\nChelbro', in Dorset, about 25 miles south-west of Yeovil. We spent several\ndays in a fruitless search for water, or for any likely place to sink a well.\nHowever, we made an attempt in the mo3t probable spot, according to our\nlocal geological knowledge, and sunk a well 20 feet. Alas ! no water was\nreached. At length Walter Wyburn suggested trying the divining rod, as he\nfound to his surprise he could use it with some success. We agreed ; he had\ncut a forked twig and tried over all the ground. After a good deal of perambu\nlation the rod indicated a strong spring in a neighbouring wood. Accordingly\nwe had a well dug at this spot, and to our delight found a capital spring ;\npipes were put down, and a constant supply for the house has been given\neversince- Francis J. Clakk.\nNo. 9.\u2014Another case [from Somersetshire] is given in the Western\nGazette of February 10th, 1893. Evercreech is at the foot of the\nMendips.\nA well has recently been sunk on the premises of Messrs. W. Roles and\nSon, of Evercreech Junction, on the site of the proposed milk factory. Mr.\nHenry Smart, head gardener at Pennard House, was successful with the\ndivining twig (or rod), and a well was sunk to a depth of 60 feet, when a\nspring was found which yielded no less than 15,000 gallons of water in ten\nhours. Water came at such a rate that a powerful pump had to be erected\ntemporarily by Messrs. Hill and Son, of Bruton, and was kept working day\nand night in order to keep the water down for the purpose of walling [the\nwell]. At the present time there is 50 feet of w.tter in the well, the supply\nincreasing daily.\nI wrote to Messrs. Roles to know if a well had been sunk previ\nously, and if the above statement was correct. They reply that the\naccount is quite correct, and add, \" We had previously sunk a well\nwithout the use of the rod, to nearly the same depth, but it was\nunsuccessful. Six yards from this useless well the diviner found\nthe spring which now yields enough to supply a small village if\nrequired.\"\nNo. 10.\u2014The next case, that of Miss Wood, is quoted from a letter\naddressed to the Abingdon Herald by our fellow-worker, Mr. Vaughan\nJenkins :\u2014\nSome time ago there appeared in a contemporary a short paragraph,\nwhich only recently came under my notice, giving the information that\n\" Miss Wood, a daughter of Mr. George Wood, of the Vallets, and agent for\nthe Whitfield estates, near Hereford, had again been successful in finding\nwater at Lugwardine by means of the (so-called) divining rod.\" Being\ndesirous of obtaining full and authentic particulars of this young lady's\nexperimental operations, I addressed several specific enquiries, with special\nreference as to how and when Miss Wood discovered that she possessed the\nD\n\fSi [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ndowsing, or \"so-called divining\" faculty, to her father, who very kindly sent\nme the following interesting details :\u2014\n\" Whitfield Estate Office, February 4th, 1890.\n\" In reply to your letter of the 15th ult., I beg to say that in January\nlast (1889) Mrs. Greathed of Whitfield, who is sister of the late owner of\nthe estate\u2014C. M. B. Clive, Esq.,\u2014wrote to Mullins, the well-known water-\nfinder by the use of the divining rod, asking him to come to Whitfield for\nthe purpose of making some trials there. Mrs. Greathed requested me to\nconduct Mullins to various elevated places on the estate, which I did in\ncompany with several persons, including Mrs. Greathed herself, Mr. Percy\nClive, the future owner of the estate, etc. I took Mullins to several places\nwhere I knew there was water running through the earth, but not the\nslightest trace of it on tiie surface. I did not tell him that I knew there was\nwater anywhere. I merely took him to the gates of the different fields and\nasked him to try in each case. He quickly spotted each place to a great\nnicety, without the slightest hesitation.\n\" The next thing was for each of the company to try with the rod, but not\none of us had the ' faculty ' excepting my little daughter May. Subsequently\nthe rod indicated water in several places, both in the hands of May and\nMullins\u2014May finding it first sometimes and at other times Mullins.\n\"I suggested that we should not make a trial by sinking wells until the\nautumn, when springs here are generally very low. Well, we made a trial\nin November last at a spot where Mullins said the water would possibly\nbe found at a depth of 40 or 50 feet. We came on water at 40 feet.\nI may mention that previous to sinking this well the rod in my\ndaughter's hand indicated the presence of an underground spring there.\nMay is now . thirteen years of age. She has proved successful in\nnumerous cases ; four wells have been sunk where she said there was\nwater, and each one was a success, viz., one at Ledbury, one at Lugwardine,\nand two at Whitfield. Hitherto, all her predictions have proved invariably\ntrue. Two wells had been unsuccessfully sunk at Lugwardine previous to\nmy daughter's visit there, the deepest of which was 16 feet. The place where\nMay indicated water is distant 42 feet from this abandoned well, and at\nII feet deep a superabundance of water was found, and pipes are now laid to\nconvey the water to the Vicarage, which is, I believe, several hundred yards\naway. As regards her modus operandi, she holds the forked hazel twig down\nwards when in search of water, and when she comes on a spring the twig\nquivers and rises upwards, sometimes from her body and sometimes towards\nit, until it comes to a perpendicular position. She practises the rod as you\nsuppose, viz., as an amateur only, being only too happy to use her powers\nfor the benefit of friends and neighbours.\" q \\\\r00i>\nIn confirmation of the foregoing statements, the following letters may be\nquoted : The Rev. Francis Curtis, rector of Coddington, near Ledbury,\nwrites:\u2014\" The spring has been found at the Stone-house 57ft. below the\nsurface, exactly at the spot indicated by Miss Wood. She said she thought\nthe depth would be as much as 50ft. So the event proves her judgment to\nhave been very correct. We are very glad that we availed ourselves of her\ngifts.\" The Rev. A. C. Lee, of Lugwardine Vicarage, Hereford, writes :\n\fXXXII.] 35\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\n\"The well sinker came to me an hour ago with the welcome intelligence that\nhe had come upon a strong spring of water, at the depth of 1ift., on the spot\nMiss Wood ' found ' on Monday, and which, you will remember, I marked\nwith two sticks, and which was thought to have the strongest indications.\nPrevious to Miss Wood's visit two wells had been sunk, but no water found.\"\nIn my letter of thanks to Mr. Wood I expressed a wish to be informed of\nthe results of any future experiments that his daughter may make, and on\nthe 23rd February, 1890, I received from him the following communication :\n\u2014\"I have had occasion to sink a well for the use of four cottages and a\npublic-house. I took my daughter, May, to the place, and she spotted a\nplace where she said there was water. I had it tried, and we found water at 6ft.\ndeep. I instructed the men to sink 6ft. further down, for the purpose of\nholding a supply, and the water rose 6ft. deep in the well in one night.\"\nI wrote to Mr. Wood, sending him the above report and asking him\nto correct any inaccuracies, and also enquiring whether his daughter\nhad had any further experiences with the \"rod.\" In reply he writes: \u2014\nWhitfield Estate Office, Hereford, May 9th, 1896.\nThe report enclosed is quite accurate. My daughter May has been\nrequested to go to very many places to find water since the report you send\nwas written, and has always been successful. I have often been glad of her\nservices myself. q Wood.\nIn answer to my enquiries, Mr. Percy Clive writes as follows :\u2014\nTower of London, April 24th, 1897.\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the statement made above by Mr. G.Wood,\nwho is my estate agent at Whitfield. I saw Mullins \"find \" water in several\nplaces, where his findings were afterwards proved to be correct. I, as well\nas others, tried to find water in the same way, but had not the power. But\nwhen Mullins held my wrists, and I held the twig over running water, it\nturned round in my hands with such force that when I held it tight it\nbroke. Miss May Wood has been very successful in finding water ; and\nseems also able to make a pretty accurate guess at the depth at which it will\nbe found- Percy A. Clive.\nNo. 11.\u2014A still more youthful diviner was found by Mr. Vaughan\nJenkins in Cornwall, and is referred to in Mr. Pease's report. The\ncase is given at length by Mr. V. Jenkins in the Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. II., p. 106. Since then Mr. V. Jenkins has sent me voluminous\nadditional particulars, which I have incorporated in the following\nsummary of the case :\u2014\nMr. V. Jenkins having purchased some land for building purposes in\nChristehurch-road, Newport, Monmouth, the absence of a water supply\nnecessitated his sinking a well. Guided by the best advice, a site was\ncarefully chosen and a well commenced. When the well-sinkers had reached\n51 feet, and no water found, it was decided from the nature of the ground,\na hard, compact marl, it would bo useless to proceed further. A con\nsultation of local experts was held, and the conclusion arrived at that there\n\f36 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nwas no chance of obtaining water in that neighbourhood. Thereupon the\nforeman of the masons (a Cornishman) suggested using the divining\nrod. He said it was in common and successful use for the purpose of\nfinding water in his county, and his own son, eleven years old, had the\npower of using the rod in a remarkable degree. Mr. Jenkins, though at\nthat time very incredulous, consented. The lad was sent for, and with a\nhazel rod he crossed and re-crossed the ground several times. At one\nspot the rod began to revolve, and continued to do so with such force\nthat the lad was obliged to let it go, when the rod How to some distance.\nWhereupon the father of tho lad, George Lockyer, said, \"I will stake my\nlife we shall find a good spring of water under this spot. I will undertake\nto sink the shaft myself, and no water, no pay.\" Accordingly, a well was\nbegun the next day on the spot indicated by the \"rod.\" At the depth of\n48 feet, so strong a spring was struck that the men employed had to beat a\nhasty retreat, the water rising to a depth of 10 feet in the well, and\nsubsequently to 15 feet, and remains at that depth at the present time,\nconstantly yielding an abundant supply. The lad neither asked nor\nexpected any payment. The father stated that he himself also had the\npower of using the \" rod \" when he was a boy, but he lost it when\nabout 16 years old.\nThe discovery of this water supply led to tho old site for the house being\nabandoned, and a new site fixed on close to tho abundant supply of pure\nspring water that was obtained. The relative position of the two wells,\nmarked O O, is shown in the annexed plan, Fig. 2, drawn to scale. The old\nVia. 2.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod.\nsite is marked S', and the abandoned well shaft W, the new site is S\", and\nthe new well W\" adjoins it. The plot A belongs to Mr. V. Jenkins. The\nowner of the adjacent plot B, which slopes somewhat steeply to the S.W.,\nshortly after began to build two villas at B, and to sink the well W adjoining.\nHe declined, indeed ridiculed, the use of the divining rod, and informed Mr.\nJenkins that he was confident of getting water at 20 feet depth, but feared,\nas the land was so much lower, it would drain off the supply from\nMr. V. J.'s new well.i Accordingly at B a shaft was sunk, but no water was\nmet with at 25 nor even 50 feet. Eventually the well sinkers went down to\n100 feet, and still no water was found. A boring was then made 25 feet\ndeeper, and at 125 feet water was struck, but though the boring was\ncontinued still deeper, the water never rose beyond 18 to 24 inches in\nthe well ; a fair supply was, however, obtained. The water at Mr. J.'s\nwell at S\" was, and still is, entirely unaffected by the well at B. The soil\nat B was the same as that in the abandoned well shaft at S' in the plot A,\nviz., a \"hard, compact marl.\" Three pairs of villas were subsequently\nerected on the plot C, and three wells sunk as shown at W, W, \\V. Water\nwas obtained at 50 feet depth, but the supply \"was poor, and is not\nsufficient to keep the wells from running dry in a very dry summer.\" These\nwells were therefore a comparative failure.2\nThe date of this experience is, I find, 1853, but full notes appear\nto have been kept. The plan, Fig. 2, I made from the estate drawing.\nIt would be interesting to have a geological examination of this\nland, and a report on the foregoing case.\nNo. 12. \u2014The Rev. Martin R. Knapp, M.A., vicar of Holy Trinity,\nDalston, writes to me as follows :\u2014\n72, Forest-road, Dalston, N.E., November 14f\/t, 1896.\nIn the summer of 1892 I entered on the vicarage of North Wootton, in\nNorth Somerset, and had reason at once to look for water. I was advised\nto try a \" water-finder,\" and did so. The dowser was a retired miller, and\ncame provided with a number of forked twigs. Holding one he traversed the\nplace, and at certain points the twig oscillated violently in his hands, and\nthere, he professed, he should find water.\nThere was an interesting side-light in the matter that I will tell you of.\nMy builder, who came from Bath, was very sceptical about the whole thing.\nThree or four of us who were on the spot tried to see if the twigs would\n\" play up \" with us.\ni Upon getting this information, Mr. Jenkins asked the youthful \"dowser\" to\ngo over the ground again and see if he could trace the direction of the underground\nwater. This the lad did, and asserted, on the evidence of the rod, that water would\nbe found on the West side of the new well W\", but that little would be found on the\nSouth or East side of it ; the North side had already been tried and abandoned.\nThe father of the lad thereupon assured Mr. V. J. he had no cause for anxiety\nfrom the proposed well at B., which turned out to be correct.\n- It was the success of the rod in this case, and its personal value to Mr.\nVaughan Jenkins, that led him to devote much of his time for the past 40 years in\ncollecting evidence bearing on the subject of the divining rod.\n\f38 [PAKT\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nWe were unsuccessful till this man tried his hand, scoffing the while.\nBut directly that he came to the spots the dowser had found, the twig showed\nvigorous signs of animation.

He carries neither rod nor twig, and\ntold me, when I enquired, that his sensations are undoubted and extraordi\nnary whenever he is directly above either water or minerals.\nMartin R. Knapp.\nIn answer to enquiries Mr. Knapp tells me the builder was a\nstranger to the locality, and the spots where the rod moved were\nunlikely to suggest water below. The twig in the builder's hand,\nMr. Knapp says, in every case corroborated the dowser's indications,\nand hence he (the builder) was unmercifully chaffed, as he had treated\nthe whole thing with such contempt. Mr. Knapp says it is possible\nthat the places indicated by the dowser might have been perceived\nby the builder, but it was the spontaneous and vigorous movement of\nthe twig, evidently contrary to the holder's intention and against his\nwill, that excited their astonishment.\nUnfortunately Mr. Knapp was unable to sink a well; one of the\nplaces indicated was unsuitable, and at another he began to dig, but\nat the time had no means of going deeper than a few feet, and\nafterwards moved his' residence.\nNo. 13.\u2014Another instance of a successful amateur diviner is the\ndaughter of a clergyman in Buckinghamshire. Her father, the Rev.\nSeymour Ashwell, M.A., writes to me as follows :\u2014\nFinmere Rectory, September 7th, 1896.\nAs regards my daughter's ability to find water, all I can say is that it\nhas been a most useful gift. She has found springs all over the country,\nand wells have been dug at the spot indicated with the best results, and\nvillages and private houses that had been badly supplied for years have now\nplenty. I might mention a curious feature of it is if she walks backwards\nthe stick does not move.i Also she can tell when she is getting near water\nquite twenty yards or more before she gets to the spot where the spring is.\nShe is also equally successful in finding gold, as she proved at Lord North's,\nwhere they had buried some quartz containing gold for her to find. It\nwould of course bo much more satisfactory if you would come and see\nfor yourself what she can do. I might mention she finds hazel the best\ni This is only the effect of a \" fixed idea,\" as will be seen later on, and corres\nponds to a similar phenomena exhibited by Bleton in 17S0, and by many other\ndowsers. In fact, in a later letter, Mr. Ashwell writes: \"If my daughter holds\nthe forked twig with the point upward), and walks backwards, then the stick\nturns down ; though if the point be held downwards it does not move when she\nwalks backwards.\" -W.F.B.\n\fXXXII.] 39\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nwood to use, though some others will do, as also copper wire, but that acts\nbest when well twisted in the middle. Seymoub Ashwell.\nIn a subsequent letter the Rev. Seymour Ashwell writes from\nBalnakilly, Blairgowrie, N.B., September Uth, 1896.\nI may add I this day had a letter from Worcestershire to say that two\nwells had been dug at spots pointed out by my daughter last July. The one\nis 13 feet deep and has 8 feet of water in it, the other 30 feet deep and\nhas 17 feet in it. I should not think that the most sceptical need bettor\nproof as to the power of finding water. In what the power consists I don't\npretend to explain.

Bicknell, M.A., of\nBordighera, Italy, of the remarkable dowsing faculty possessed by the\nyoung son of a friend of his, who was formerly rector of Uggeshall in\nSuffolk, I wrote for further particulars. Mr. Bicknell replies :\u2014,\nBordighera, Italy, December 2Uh, 1896.\nOddly enough, Mr. Edgell, the father of the boy whom I mentioned, arrived\nhere this evening. He tells me that his son (1) when at Uggeshall found\nthe spring and well which supplied his pump ; the whereabouts of which was\nnot known to the present rector nor to the Edgells, the former occupants of\nthe rectory; and (2) that he also found water in his own garden at Teddington,\nthe existence of which was not known to the boy or the father, but only to\nthe old gardener, who had said, when Mr. E. told him about his boy's gift,\n\" Well, sir, I know where there is a spring in the garden, and if he finds it\nI shall believe there is something in dowsing.\"\nMr. Hanbury (who lives near here) told me that many years ago while he\nwas away a diviner indicated water in his garden, but, for some reason or\nother, they did nothing.

My carpenter found he had slight power in doing the same ; he could\nfeel the stick move, but it was not visibly active.\n\u2022\nLater on, Sir Charles writes :\u2014\nLamport Hall, Northampton, September 22nd, 1896.\nThree weeks since we discovered that my carpenter found water by the\ndivining rod at a farmhouse we are building. He tells me he went over the\n\f40 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nground, with his eyes shut, several times, and always came to within a yard\nof the place he had fixed on ; accordingly a well was sunk there and a good\nsupply of water was found.\nNo. 17.\u2014This list of amateur English dowsers would be very\nincomplete without some notice of Messrs. Young and Robertson of\nLlanelly who, together with several of their children, possess remark\nable dowsing powers, judging from the correspondence that is before\nme. Mr. Vaughan Jenkins, of Oxford, writes to me as follows :\u2014\nAmong the most successful diviners are Mr. Young and Mr. Robertson,\nof Llanelly, South Wales, who have not only not received any fee or reward\nfor their services, but have spent much time in the endeavour to ascertain\nthe cause of the rod's movements. No two men could be found who would\nmore readily co-operate with an honest and unbiassed scientific investigation\nof the matter.\nHere the faculty seems hereditary, for Mr. Young's father was able\nto discover underground water, the effect on him, as on his son,\ncreating a very unpleasant physiological disturbance. Mr. Young\nsends me the following illustration of his father's gift :\u2014\nMy father, who is living in Dorsetshire, is now 87. Two years ago he\npointed out a spot to a neighbour who was about to build two villas if water\ncould be found. A well was sunk, and an abundant supply of beautiful\nwater, at about 40 feet, was struck. Prior to the sinking, the owner of the land\ngot three other local diviners to look for water in this field; the last he took\nblindfolded to the spot. They each and all pointed out the very spot my father\ndid, and each one was perfectly ignorant that any one had previously tried.\nNow comes the curious part. The village doctor was building a villa about\n80 yards away, (on the same level), and said he could find water anywhere\nin that locality without the rod. He tried, sank a well, (a built well,) to 50\nfeet, and never had a drop, and the well was closed. This was about two\nyears ago. About three months ago the doctor decided to sink another well\nin a spot close by his first, where three members of my family and myself\npointed out as being a likely spot. The well was sunk, and is now in daily\nuse delivering, with a pump, a plentiful supply at a less depth than the\nbarren well a few yards away. He had been paying \u00a312 per year for\nwater carted for daily use. \u2022\nAmid the letters which Mr. Young has written to me on this\nsubject there are several instances of successful \" dowsing \" by himself\nand by his friend and neighbour, Mr. Robertson ; nothing, however, of\nany particular evidential value is to be found, except possibly in two\ncases. In one of these, both he and Mr. Robertson independently fixed\non an underground spring near the house of Mr. Meredith (son of the\nnovelist), and subsequently a strong spring burst forth from the very\nspot, though no signs of it existed before. I wrote for corroboration,\nbut Mr. Meredith had left Llanelly, and Mr. Young sends me a letter\n\fXXXII.] 41\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nfrom a gentleman whose house was near, which in general terms\nconfirms Mr. Young's statements. The other case was where Mr.\nYoung and Mr. Robertson independently determined the position of a\nleak in the town reservoir and also fixed on the depth below the\nembankment of the culvert or out-flow from the reservoir. Neither of\nthem knew this depth, both fixed on the same amount,\u201430 feet,\u2014and\nsubsequent inquiry proved they were exactly right. But in both these\nexperiments other explanations than a dowsing faculty (such as\nunconscious indications, latent memory, or thought-transference),\nmight account for the facts. Mr. Young tells me that by the\nsensations he experiences, when his mind is \" set \" on dowsing, he\ncan discover an underground spring even when quickly driving in a\nvehicle. He adds that not only his father but all his sisters are\nable to use the divining rod with more or less success ; the same\nseems to be true of Mr. Robertson's family, judging from the large\nfamily group represented as dowsing in the little book they have\npublished.\nOther cases have reached me of amateur dowsers, but what has\nnow been made sufficiently clear is that the movement of the rod is\nnot due to any voluntary conscious act on the part of the dowser.i\nI will therefore only add the evidence given by a few amateur dowsers\nof older date, as these are of some historical interest. The list might\nbe largely extended.\nNo. 18.\u2014The case of Lady Milbanke, the mother-in-law of Lady\nByron, is a well-known example of an amateur diviner. In a letter to\nDr. C. Hutton, F.R.S., dated February, 1805, Lady Milbanke describes\nhow she was led to try the rod from witnessing its use by a peasant\nin Provence, who had successfully found water springs by means of\nthe rod, so that the man got the appellation of L'Homme d la\nBaguette. Lady Milbanke says a large party assembled to watch the\ngyrations of the rod, which, in spite of the man's hands being\nstationary, twisted round so energetically when he stood over a spring\nthat the rod was broken. Lady Milbanke continues :\u2014\nAfter seeing him do this repeatedly, the whole party tried the baguette\n(a forked hazel twig) in succession, but without effect. I chanced to be the\nlast ; no sooner did I hold the twig as directed than it began to move as\nwith him, which startled me so much that 1 dropped it and felt considerably\nagitated. I was, however, induced to resume the experiment, and found the\neffect perfect. On my return to England, two years afterwards, being on\ni 1 am assuming that the dowser is not a rogue ; one might no doubt by practice\naccomplish the twisting of the rod, with apparently no muscular effort, like any other\npiece of legerdemain.\n\f42 [part\nProfessor W.

A stake was immediately driven into the ground to\nmark the spot, which was not very distant from where they had before\nsunk. They then took me to another and distant building in the park, and\ndesired me to try there. I found the baguette turn very strongly, so that\nit soon twisted and broke ; the gentleman persisted that there was no water\nthere, unless at a great depth, the foundation being very deep (a con\nsiderable stone-cellar), and that no water appeared when they dug for it.\nI replied that I knew no more than from the twig turning ; that I had too\nlittle experience of its powers or certainty to answer for the truth of its\nindication. He then acknowledged that when the building was erected\nthey were obliged to drive piles for the whole foundation, as they met with\nnothing but a quicksand. This induced him to dig in the spot I first\ndirected. They met with a very fluent spriwj.

In the places where I had good reason to know that\nno water was to be found the rod was always quiescent, but in other places,\nwhere I knew there was water below the surface, the rods turned slowly and\nregularly in the manner above described, till the twigs twisted themselves\noff below the fingers, which were considerably indented by so forcibly\nholding the rod between them.2\nAll the company stood close to Lady M. with all eyes intensely fixed on\nher hands and the rods to watch if any particular motion might be made by\ni See also description by an eyo-witness given in the Quarterly Rcricw, Vol.\nXXri., (1820) foot note, pp. 373-4.\u2014W.F.B.\n2 Dr. Hutton does not say horn he knew that water was. or was not, below the\nsurface. He was not, however, one likely to make loose and random statements.\nAccording to a footnote in the Quarterly Review, Vol. XXII., p. 374, it appears that\nthe ground chosen fur the experiment was a field Dr. Hutton had bought, adjoining the\nnew College at Woolwich then building.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 4:?\nthe fingers, but in vain ; nothing of the kind was perceived, and all the\ncompany could observe no cause or reason why the rods should move in the\nmanner they were seen to do.\nAfter the experiments were ended, every one of the company tried the\nrods in the same manner as they saw Lady M. had done, but without the\nleast motion from any of them. And in my family, among ourselves, we\nhave since then, several times, tried if we could possibly cause the rod to\nturn by means of any trick, or twisting of the fingers, held in the manner\nLady M. did ; but in vain, we had no power to accomplish it.\nNo. 19.\u2014Dr. Mayo, F.R.S., in his book on Popular Superstitions,\nquotes the case of a Mrs. R., sister of Sir G. R., then living at\nSouthampton, who, in 1806, observing the successful use of the divin\ning rod by the wife of a Colonel Beaumont, tried it herself, and found\nshe had the power in a remarkable degree. The rod, Dr. Mayo\nremarks, continued to move, even when Mrs. R.'s hands were grasped\nso firmly that muscular action by her wrists or fingers seemed to be\nprevented. V-shaped rods of iron or copper wire were as effective as\na hazel rod, but no motion ever occurred when the two handles of the\nrod were covered with sealing wax. If, however, the uncoated parts\nwere touched, the rod immediately revolved.i\nNo. 20.\u2014The Comte de Tristan, whose book on the divining rod\nhas already been mentioned, published in 1829 a record of his own\nexperience with the rod, extending over 1,800 experiments, 1,200 of\nwhich were carefully noted. He mentions five or six friends of his\nwho he found could also use the rod. Count de Tristan found the rod\nwould only move when he passed over what he calls \" exciting tracts \"\nof ground, and that its motion was arrested when the hands were\ncovered with thick silk.

The most remarkable of the foreign cases is unques\ntionably that of the French youth, Bleton, described by Dr. Thouvenel\ni That \"electricity has something to do\" with the motion of the rod, is a\nwidespread belief. This will be discussed later on ; here I will only say that, in spite\nof the foregoing experiments, and others to be related, the electrical hypothesis is not\none that any physicist could entertain.\n\f44 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nin 1781. This I have reserved for separate treatment in the list of\nspecial cases that are too long to be included in the varied collection of\nevidence which it is my object to present in the first instance.\nNo. 21.\u2014In the American Journal of Sciencei for 1821, Vol. III.,\np. 102, the Rev. Ralph Emerson suggests the publication in that\njournal of \" a sufficient number of well authenticated facts on the use\nof ' mining rods' in discovering fountains of water underground, to put\ntheir utility beyond a doubt. For myself,\" he adds, \" I was totally-\nsceptical of their efficacy till convinced by my own senses.\" He then\nrelates how the divining rod moved in the hands of his friend the Rev.\nMr. Steele, and how he made a crucial experiment to test the value of\nits indications. Taking Mr. Steele to a place where a perennial under\nground stream existed, of which Mr. Steele was unaware, the rod\ninstantly dipped down when he came over the stream, and when asked\nto trace its course he did so for 50 rods until he arrived at its mouth\n\" which was so situated as to prevent his discovering it \" till close by\nit. \" The mode of his tracing it resembled that of a dog on his\nmaster's track, crossing back and forth, and he proceeded with as little\nhesitation.\"\nHere, however, it is possible that some unconscious indications\ngiven by Mr. Emerson might be assumed as exciting, sub-consciously,\nthe suggestion which moved the rod in Mr. Steele's hands. But this\nexplanation will not hold good of the next case quoted by Mr. Emerson,\nwhich is as follows :\u2014\nNo. 22.\u2014On a journey to the south-east part of New Hampshire, I found\na practical use has been made of these rods in that region, for a year or two\npast, in fixing on the best places for wells. A man in that vicinity could not\nonly designate the best spot, but could tell how many feet it would be\nneedful to dig to find water, and had frequently been employed for this pur\npose without having failed in a single instance. I will recite one case out of\na number. A man who had dug in vain for a good well near his house, re\nquested his [the dowser's] advice. On trial with the rod, the best place was\nfound to be directly under a favourite tree in front of the house ; and there\nthe proprietor was assured he would find abundance of water at a moderate\ndepth. But on reflection, he was loth to sacrifice the tree, and concluded it\nwould answer as well to dig pretty near it. He dug ; and after sinking the\nshaft much deeper than had been directed, abandoned it in despair. He soon\ncomplained of his disappomtment. \" Did you then dig in the precise spot I\ntold you?\" \" I dug as near it as I could without injuring the tree.\" \"Go\nhome and dig up that tree, and if you do not find water at the specific depth,\nI will defray the expense.\" He did so ; and obtained an excellent well at\nthe given depth.\ni This monthly journal corresponds to our Philosophical Magazine, as a leading\nand authoritative scientific organ.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 45\nAs to the depth, it occurred to me when seeing the operation of the rods\nin the hands of Mr. Steele, that it might be easily ascertained, by taking the\nangle they made at a few feet from the spot where they became directly\nvertical- Ralph Emerson.'\nMr. Emerson does not say whether he obtained the information at\nfirst or second-hand ; this case, therefore, rests upon weak evidence.\nIn the next case the importance of sinking at the exact spot\nindicated by the dowser will also be seen.\nNo. 23.\u2014I am indebted to Mr. F. T. Elworthy of Foxdown,\nWellington, Somerset, (from whose well-known Somerset Word-book I\nhave already quoted) for several interesting cases of the reality and\npractical value of the faculty possessed by dowsers. Mr. Elworthy\nalso sends me the following communication he received from Mr.\nE. Neville Rolfe, H.M. Consul at Naples, whose brother, a resident in\nAustralia, wrote to him that the gift of \"dowsing\" was well known\nand its value recognised in Australia. Mr. Rolfe continues :\u2014\nOn the Queensland Central Railway and next to the cattle station I live\non (say 400 miles west of Rockhampton) is a station named Coreena. Near\nthe head station the manager had sunk a well, but the water proved salt. A\ndiviner happened to pass ; the manager showed him his well, and expressed\nhis regret that he had been so unfortunate as to get salt water. Testing the\nground, the diviner indicated the place where the manager ought to have\nsunk. The manager considered the matter and determined on a fresh trial,\nbut thinking \" there or thereabouts \" was near enough, sunk, say 50 yards,\nfrom the spot indicated, and to his disgust again struck lalt water. The\ndiviner passed by a few months later and was upbraided by the manager for\nthe waste of money he had caused him to make. \"Let us see in the\nmorning,\" said the diviner; \"I don't understand this at all.\" In the\nmorning, on seeing the new well, he said, \" This is not where I told you to\nsink; here (indicating the exact spot) is where I told you.\" \"I grant it,\"\nsaid the manager, \"but I thought those few yards made no difference.\"\n\"You try,\" replied the other, and again departed. The manager, after\nmuch deliberation, determined to sink a third well, and teas rewarded by an,\nabundant supply of fresh miter. The three wells are there at this moment\nas evidence of the truth of this story\u2014a truth I can vouch for myself, on\nwhat I consider the best evidence short of my being a principal in the\ntransaction. No doubt corroborative evidence could be easily supplied.\nIf it were required, I am sure an application to C. \\V. Little, Esq.,\nManager Union Mortgage and Agency Co., Rockhampton, Queensland,\nwould meet with a prompt reply. Mr. Little is one of the owners of\nCoreena.\ni As I have already said this is not, as I at first thought, Ralph Waldo Emerson,\nbut apparently a contemporary of his, who was ordained as a Congregational\nminister a little before Waldo Emerson entered the Unitarian ministry.\n\f46 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nI wrote to Mr. Little's address, in Queensland, who kindly replied\nas follows :\u2014\nBox 237, G.P.O., Sydney, January 27th, 1897.\nYour letter addressed to Rockhampton reached me a day or two ago.\nYour information is quite correct with regard to the well you mention at\nLochnagar, but I am sorry to say the other spots on other parts of the run\npointed out by Mr. Sewelli did not fulfil expectations. Mr. E. H. King,\nEton Vale, Toowoomba, Queensland, was at that time managing the station.\nI have sent a copy of your letter to him asking him to answer your\nquestions. He has also had experience of the use of divining rods on the\nDarling Downs.\nI have also sent a copy of your letter to Mr. Vincent Dowling, of Lue,\nRylstone, N.S.W., who has, I believe, had some experience, and may be\nable to give you some interesting information. q Little.\nSydney, February 8th, 1897.\nI am enclosing copies of letters from Mr. Dowling and Mr. King. With\nregard to the latter, I may say that when Mr. Sewell\u2014who used the rod\u2014\nwas at Coreena, an artesian flow of water had just been obtained by the\nrailway department on the run at 180 feet, and Mr. Sewell endeavoured to\nselect sites where we should be equally successful, but entirely failed ; had\nhe confined his attention to opening up springs, or sinking for supplies at\nabout 30 feet, he could probably have been more successful.\nC. W. Little.\nThe following is Mr. Dowling's letter to Mr. Little :\u2014\n\" Lue Homestead,\" Lue, February 2nd, 1897.\nYours of the 27th u!t., enclosing copy of Professor Barrett's letter,\nreceived.\nFor the Professor's information, I might state that for years I scoffed at\nthe \" divining rod \" ; no one could have been more sceptical than myself.\nI have, however, changed my views during the last few years, as 1 have had\nmany instances placing beyond all possibility of a doubt the fact that there\nis something in the art, or gift, or electric power, whatever you like to\ncall it.\nI have discovered three wells by the agency of the rod, two of them\nare deep, one about 100 feet, another about 130 feet, and another about 40\nfeet. The first I do not use, though there is plenty of water, but it is deep,\nand I have another well near ; the second was used in the 1888 drought, but\nnever since ; the third is in constant use, and waters about 6,000 sheep and\n700 head of cattle. I have an aermotor mill with an open tup lift pump,\npumping into a tank holding about 23,000 gallons water ; the water is\nabundant, and the tank often full, running water back into the well.\nI know of several wells near my Gummin station, discovered by the agency\nof the rod. The eldest son of my overseer at Gummin, a man now about\n35 years of age, can and does use the rod, and another man (Hitchins) living\nnear Gummin also possesses the gift. To give you an instance of the use\ni This is the name of the amateur dowser referred to in Xo. 23.\u2014W.F.B.\n\fxxxii.] On, the So-called Divining Rod. 47\nof this gift, the following is a fact. In the drought of 1888 the Ryder\nBros., of Calga, were very badly off for water, in fact were losing stock\nheavily. They wrote and asked me if I would lend them young Passworth,\nthe overseer's son, to see if he could find them water. I lent them the man,\nand he found them three sites for wells, following light streams of water\nuntil they joined and formed a large body. The Ryder Bros, were not\nsatisfied altogether, so without letting the other man\u2014Hitchins\u2014Passworth,\nor myself know anything, they paid Hitchins to go over and see if he could\nfind water ; the site of Passworth's wells was not marked except to the\ninitiated, the Ryders themselves. Hitchins followed the same streams and\nmarked the same site3 within a few yards or feet. The Ryders then put down\nthree shafts, and obtained abundance of fresh water in two ; the third was\nnever finished, as the rain came. However, they struck the water before\nthe rain fell, but did not go on. These wells saved thousands of sheep for\nCalga.\nTo give you another example, I once got Passworth (overseer's son) to\nfollow the stream from the \" Swamp Well \" (the well I have mentioned as\nwatering so many sheep and cattle), as I wished to see whether the same\nstream supplied other old wells I have some miles distant, but in the same\nfall. The stream was not the same ; we followed it for some distance and it\nsuddenly turned into the main Mambelong Creek, and I said no doubt this\nis the same stream ; but when we got into the bed of the creek, which was\nperfectly dry at the time, the rod stood erect when we faced down the\nstream, but bent when kept on its back ; it crossed the creek, and I followed\nwith him over a mile, the rod working well on a strong course of water,\nwhich eventually led us to the site of an old spring which I knew of, but\nthe man knew nothing about, the spring having been trampled in and\ndestroyed by cattle years before : it used to be a strong spring. This\nsatisfied me there was virtue in the rod. It is extraordinary to see the rod\nworking on a long course, directly the man gets off the stream, up comes the\nrod, more to the right or left, as the case may be, and down it comes when\nyou get over the course. Vincent Dowlino.\nThe next is Mr. King's letter to Mr. Little :\u2014\nElton Vale, Cambooya, February 1st, 1897.\nSewell's experiments were interesting so far as they went, but were of no\nreal practical value, I fear. You will remember we tried two of his sites in\nEmu Hills Park, both of which proved to be brackish or salt water, and\nsmall supplies at that, when big ones were promised ; at the Jersey Bore we\nwore to get a big flow at 3'I0 feet, but nothing came of this ; at head of Back\nCreek only a small stream found, and a big supply promised ; his only success\nwas at Locknagaar, where I believe he showed Conway where there was a\nsupply of fresh water close to a spring that -was known to be salt ; and on\nopening it up it proved correct. ^ H King\nNo. 24.\u2014Mr. Phippen, in his little work published on the rod in\n1853, gives several cases of abundant and perennial water supply found\nby the dowsers, Mapstone and Adams of Somersetshire ; and relates\n\f48 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nexperiments he himself made with Adams which made him an enthusi\nastic believer in the value of the rod. Like others, he and a friend\ncould not hold the rod still when it was over a subterranean spring.\nThe Rev. Mr. Foster, of Sodbury, Gloucestershire, had sunk a well\n60 feet deep without finding water. Adams was sent for, and by the\ndowsing rod fixed on a spot 6 feet from the dry well, where he said\nwas a good spring about 20 feet deep ; a tunnel was accordingly\ndriven at this depth from the old well to the spot indicated, \" when\nan abundant supply of excellent water was obtained which speedily\nfilled the old well up to 40 feet,\" i.e., to the level of the spring.\nNo. 25. \u2014Mr. J. G. Marshall, of Leeds, a well-known manufacturer,\nseeing the account in the newspapers of that day, wrote to Adams,\nwho lived at Rowberrow, near Shipham, in Somersetshire, to come to\nLeeds, as he needed a good supply of water. Adams came, and\nMr. Marshal] gives the following report in a letter he wrote, which I\nsummarise :\u2014\nMonk Coniston, October 24f\/i, 1846.\nI watched Adams closely : he appears a perfectly, simple, honest,\nstraightforward man. At the spot he indicated, and about the depth he\nspecified, a good spring of water wasfound. An old well sunk near the place\nbut not so deep had no water, and other wells near, of the same depth, had\nmuch less water. I tested Adams by taking him over our factory where he\nhad no possible guide from anything he could see ; he pointed out remark\nably nearly the position of the springs found by deep bore-holes. The\nsame result was found at another factory where he could not have got any\ninformation, nor was there any guide from what was said.\nI then completely blindfolded him, and after walking him about in various\ndirections I asked him to fix the spot where he had located a spring ; in the\nfirst attempt he failed, but afterwards succeeded ; he said he was not used to\nbeing blindfolded and was much confused by it.\nHe thinks it is some sort of vapour comes from the water or mineral\nvein, which affects his nervous system, \"giving him,\" as he describes it,\n\"a sort of turn.\"\nAdams failed to detect coins placed under hats, and yet the rod turned,\nwhich was the most suspicious circumstance I saw.\nI and several others repeatedly tried to detect some motion of Adams'\nfingers when the rod turned, but could find none whatever.\nJ. G. Marshall.\nMr. Phippen says he has in his possession nearly 100 certificates\nfrom gentlemen in Somersetshire, testifying to the success of Adams\nin finding water by his \" dowsing rod,\" and quotes the following as\none instance :\u2014\nMr. M. Teek, of Hill House, near Wells, certifies that he had lived\n40 years in that house, had sunk two wells to a depth of 50 feet each but\nfound no water in either case, and consequently water had to be carried\n\fXXXII.] 49\nOn the So-called Divining Rod,\na considerable distance. Adams was at last sent for, and the dowser found\nan excellent spring of water close to the house.\nMr. Phippen thinks one in every seven or eight persons have the\n\" gift \" of using the rod if they tried, and concludes by giving\ndirections as to holding the rod, which is quoted in Appendix C.\nNo. 26.\u2014Mr. Young, of Llanelly, sent me some details of the finding\nof water for the Shepton Mallet gaol long ago by the dowser Kingston,\nwho used to live at Evercreech ; previously to the dowser's visit a\nfruitless well had been sunk. I asked Mr. Young to get me the exact\nparticulars, and he sends me the following letter from Mr. W. Stone,\nan old man who was formerly employed at the gaol.\nShepton Mallet, December 19th, 1896.\nIt is between 40 and 50 years ago the trial with the divining rod took\nplace at the gaol. All I remember is that shortly after the enlargement of\nthe gaol we wanted more water and a deep well was sunk, but no water was\nfound. The magistrates then consulted and determined to call in a man\nnamed Kingston who used the divining rod. When he came, after trying\nvarious places he came to a spot in tho front yard, and here he said \"you will\nfind water.\" A well was sunk, but I cannot remember the depth, it was not\ndeep, when water rushed in and has continued to do so. sT0nE\nMr. Young adds the gaol authorities used the water supply thus\nfound for over forty years till a town supply was laid on. Shepton\nMallet and Evercreech are at the foot of the Meudip Hills.\nNo. 27.\u2014The following is a more remarkable case, and an important\none from an evidential point of view ; it is also from Shepton Mallet.\nI have not heard whether the \" diviner \" in this case was an amateur\nor not : he is now dead, I am informed. The Bristol Times and Mirror,\nof June 16th, 1891, states:\u2014\nThe Anglo-Bavarian Brewery at Shepton Mallet needed a large water\nsupply ; accordingly excavations had been made to find water, but without\nsuccess. About two years since, during an exceptionally dry season, it\nbecame absolutely nece&sary to obtain a further supply of brewing water ;\nhence several boring experiments were made on the property. At the\nsuggestion of a gentleman in the locality, the services of a \" diviner\" were\nobtained, and although the principal members of the firm professed to have\nno faith in his \"art,\" yet he was allowed to try the fields on the company's\nproperty, and those on the neighbouring estate, and discovered the well now\nused by the brewery. . . . The soothsayer, who carried the divining rod, a\nhazel branch, was Mr. Charles Sims, a local farmer, and a notable discoverer\nof wells in the district. Operations were immediately commenced, and, after\nexcavating and dynamiting through the rock, to the depth of 50 feet, a\nmagnificent spring was discovered in a fault of the rock, which proved to be of\nexceptionally fine water, and of even a finer quality than the town's supply.\nE\n\f50 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nI wrote to the Secretary of the brewery to make enquiries and he\nreplies :\u2014\nShepton Mallet, Somersetshire, September 12th, 1896.\nReplying to your letter in regard to a local diviner, we had one of the\nname of Sims, from Pilton, who successfully denoted a spot on our ground\nwhere we have had an abundant supply of water since. This was some eight\nyears ago.\nThe writer of this letter also has had some considerable experience with\nMr. Lawrence of Bristol, who was one of the most noted divining rod men\nin the West of England. He also was successful in denoting a supply for a\nBristol brewery with which the writer was connected ; and in numerous\nother instances in the neighbourhood.

Thomas\nHares used to find both water and minerals by the rod, but he told me that a\nwatch spring would not do in his hands for finding water, though it was all\nright for minerals.\nThe following facts are within my own knowledge.\nWithin 200 yards or so of Rectory Farm house, at Locking, near Weston-\nsuper-Mare, four wells have been sunk, the position of which is marked on\nthe enclosed rough tracing from the parish map. For No. 1 well, the spring\nwas found by Thomas Hares. After walking over the field in different\ndirections, with the rod in his hand, he crossed the fence, and, whilst on the\ntop of it, the rod kept turning. He marked the spot of the spring, and on\nthat spot I removed the fence and sank the well where the fence had stood.\nThere has been a constant supply of water in it, even all through last summer,\nwhen there was a general drought.\n\fxxxu.] O>t the So-called Divining Rod. 51\nFor No. 2 well, the spring was found by John Blake, on the lawn of the\nVicarage, opposite the drawing room window, a most unsuitable position.

It is nearly as deep as No. 1. There is water in it for about\n9 months of the year, but last summer it was quite dry.\nWater was wanted at Edbrook Cottage, in Fiddington, near Bridgwater.\nThere was a good spring in a field 200 yards away, and the dowser traced it\nover field, fence and roadway, and marked the spot for a well just opposite\nthe door of the cottage. I sank the well there, and the tenants have never\nhad to go elsewhere for water since.\nWhilst the dowser was tracing this spring, walking backwards and\nforwards across the line of its course, I hid my pocket compass in the long\ngrass in his track, and, when he came to it, the rod turned over, and he said\n\"There is summat here.\" I am certain that he did not see the compass\nuntil afterwards, when I showed it to him hidden.\nThe most striking case I know of is on Sandford Green, in the parish of\nWinscombe, Somerset, where Thomas Hares offered to sink his well for\nnothing, if he did not come to the spring. There was already a well on the\ne 2\n\f52 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ngreen, but it had scarcely any water during the summer months. The well\nsunk by the dowser was so near it that the sinkers threw the dirt as they dtuj\nit out from the ntw well into the old one. The water rose to within 6 feet of\nthe top of the new well. This was some 30 years ago. The spring was the\ntalk of the neighbourhood at the time, and it is still a noted one.\nI could go on telling yarns about dowsers, but all that I have written has\ncome under my own observation, and I can vouch for the truth of it.\nW.

In 1885\nI moved to Olevedon expecting to lot this place easily, but the want of\nspring water prevented my getting a tenant. In 1888 I returned and\ndetermined to get water if possible. ... I sent for Thomas Young\nwho lived at Rowberrow, and was noted as a successful dowser. ... I\nasked Young to dowse over a field called Taylor Hill. Almost immediately\nhe struck on a stream and on the side of the Hill (exactly 300 yards from\nmy house and several feet above it), the stick twisted considerably. Here\na well was sunk 22 feet deep. This filled in the winter, but soon became\ndry in the summer, and in September, 1889 (Thomas Young had died),\n\fXXXII.] 53\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nThomas Day, another noted dowser who also lived at Rowberrow, descended\nthe well with me. The twigs were much agitated, and, one after the other,\nif not allowed to twist, snapped off.\nDay said, \"There is a lot of water under here.\" He undertook the\nsinking and sunk 30 feet more, when the water came in so -fast he had to\nleave, and ever since, even during this dry summer (1893) I have had plenty.\nOf dowsing I can offer no explanation. I am contented with the result.\nIn reference to the above, the Rev. H. H. Winwood, M.A., F.G.S.,\nadds the following note :\u2014\nThe well in question was sunk through the New Red Marl which here\nrests on the carboniferous limestone, and apparently the water was found\nbefore the limestone had been reached. It seemed an unlikely place to\nmeet with a spring.\nNo. 30.\u2014In the Proceedings S.P.R.,Vol. II., p.l05,is given a striking\ninstance of water finding by the diviner, W. Stokes, an aged man,\nliving in Newbury, Berks, where he has for many years been employed\nas a wheelwright. That Stokes really was an excellent dowser Miss\nCox has shown in her paper before the Folk Lore Congress, already\nmentioned ; space will not permit my quoting the evidence cited by\nMiss Cox. Stokes, however, professed to be able to discover which\nis spring water and which rain water. Some elaborate trials were\nmade with him for this purpose at Donnington, near Newbury, in\n1886, and the careful tests adopted showed that the result was no\nmore than mere chance coincidence would have given. The full report\nis given in the Newbury Weekly News for July 29th, 1886, and signed\nby Dr. Palmer, H. I. Reid, F.S. A., and the three other members of the\ninvestigating committee.\nSubsequently Mr. Reid wrote to Mr. Edmund Gurney as follows :\u2014\nDonnington, Newbury, Berks., August 2nd, 1880.\nA week last Saturday the old man came here again for another trial, but\nI could not be worried to go through all the test again, so we simply drew\nlots for five vessels, and placed the tickets under each bucket as drawn. He\ntried all five and was in each case wrong, three spring he called surface, two\nrain he called spring. The buckets were again emptied and refilled again by\nlot, he tried all five, and I then again told him before lifting the bucket, to\ntry a second time to be certain. This he did, and the fifth bucket he had\ndeclared to be spring he then saw was rain, so that that bucket was discarded,\nfor in one case he must of course have been right. The other four were\nthen again lifted and the cards beneath showed ho was in each instance\nwrong. A more complete failure cannot be imagined. He seemed very\ndowncast and again requested aiwther trial. This I am at present disinclined\nto trouble about, the more so as I am leaving here for town in a few days.\nIt seems as if he wanted to be tested until he had achieved a success !\nHerbert I. Reid.\n\f54 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nThis well illustrates the absurdity of many of the beliefs held about\nthe divining rod. Probably Stokes had found he was sometimes\nsuccessful in these experiments and so had been led to entertain the\nbelief he expressed. But, as I shall show in the case of hidden coins,\nsuch success is due to chance coincidence or unconscious indications\ngiven by those present.\nNo. 31. \u2014The accompanying letters refer to a dowser, Rufus\nA'Barrow, of Sturt Farm, Stalbridge, Dorset, who has since died.\nThe first letter is from Mr. Dendy to the late Edmund Gurney : \u2014\nUniversity College, Oxford, Nacember, 1887.\nYou asked me to write you a short account of the search for water which\nI witnessed last July. The operator was one Rufus A'Barrow, of Stalbridge,\nDorset. The locns in quo was chiefly slightly rising ground behind my\nfather's house\u2014Lattiford House, Wincanton, Somerset. The operator took\na flexible forked twig between his forefingers and thumbs and carrying it,\npoint downwards, quartered the ground. After a short search the forked\nstick sprung upwards ; the two twigs of the fork bending and the man's\nthumbs remaining in their previous direction, that is, I>ointing downwards.\nThe stick retained this position as long as he stood upon the spot of ground,\nwhere he was supposed to have discovered water, and returned to its\ndownward direction as soon as he stepped off it. He then proceeded to\ntrace the flow of the water and followed it some eighty yards to a small lawn\nbehind the house when he recommended the digging of the well. He\nafterwards experimented for our amusement in other places with the same\nresults. In all cases but one when the stick indicated water, he was able to\nfollow its course. In that case he could find no flow away from the spot.\nSome of us tried to operate with the twig. It showed no movement in the\nhands of any but one lady, my brother's wife. When she held- it over the\ncourse, which A. Barrow had indicated, it rose very slightly and slowly as I\nshowed you when here, but still quite distinctly.\nMy father writes to me this morning. \" Rufus A'Barrow has been most\nsuccessful in these parts, not one failure. Bradney has twenty-five feet of\nwater in his well.\" I have written to Bradney, a neighbour of ours, and\nhave asked him to write an account to you of the discovery of his well.\nA. Dendy.\nAccordingly the following letter was received from Mr. Bradney:\u2014\nBayford Lodge, Wincanton, November 10th, 1887.\nSome time ago I was anxious to find a spring on my property, so sent for\na farmer, by name Mr. Rufus A'Barrow, who was renowned for this kind of\nwork with the divining rod. He duly came over, and the first thing he did was\nto cut a Y shaped twig out of the hedge, thus c\u2014 ne then held the two\nends of the fork at A and B between the forefinger and thumb of his right and\nleft hand, the point being straight-a-head of him ; he then commenced his .\nwalk and in a very short time the twig pointed straight upwards thus : \u2014 X\nhere he said was the spring, which he traced for some distance and ' >\neventually pointed out to me where he thought was the best place for me to\n\fXXXII.] 55\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nsink a well. He seemed to be able to trace to the eighth of an inch the course\nof the spring, as the moment he went to the righfor the left of it or in any\nway got off its course, down went the twig immediately. As far as I could\nsee, the twig pointed upwards quite of its own accord, but the best proof of\nthe matter is that I sunk for water where he told me, and at the depth of\nsome fifty feet came to a beautiful spring, and I have now twenty-six feet or\nmore of water in the well. If there should be any more facts that you\nwould like to ask about, I shall be most happy if in my power to give them.\nJohn Bradney.\nIn answer to enquiries, Mr. Bradney writes :\u2014\nDecember 4th, 1887.\nAs to whether there might be water 10, 20, 30, or 100 yards on either\nside of my well, of course I can't say. I only can say that where he said there\nwas water I sunk and found a good supply.\nNo. 32.\u2014The same dowser is referred to in a letter I lately received\nfrom Major Goff, of Hale Park, Salisbury, who writes :\u2014\nHale Park, Salisbury, Nocembcr 1st, 1896.\nSome yeaTs ago I had a water-finder, A'Barrow, of Stalbridge, to try and\nfind water for the Home Farm. No one had any notion as to where any\nwas to be found except from the existing wells, which were some 30 to 50\nfeet deep. On the man's arrival he was taken to ground rising above the\nsteading and at once found traces of water, which he said must be near the\nsurface and sprung about 50 yards from the farm stables. A well was\naccordingly commenced and water was come to at 13 feet, to every one's\nastonishment. The farm and neighbouring people looked upon the pro\nceeding as uncanny, and declared that the water found was only surface ;\nhowever, the well has never given out, even in the driest summer, which\nrather does away with the surface idea.\nI had the man over again a year or so after to try for water on one of our\ndown farms in the chalk ; he found traces, but said the water was very deep,\nso I did not dig on account of the expense, knowing that the existing wells\nwere over 100 feet deep. q Goff\nIn reply to mine, Major Goff writes :\u2014\nNovember 3rd, 1896.\nThe astonishment of the local people was due to the water being found\nwhere it was not expected, and at a lesser depth than the other wells, which\nwere within 100 yards and had a habit in a dry summer of giving out.\nC. Goff.\nP.S. \u2014A'Barrow would take no fee if water was not found where he said\nit was.\nNo. 33.\u2014The Rev. C. H. Mayo, M.A., of Long Burton Vicarage,\nSherborne, Dorset, Editor of the Somerset and Dorset Notes and\nQueries, kindly sends me a lengthy account of another instance of\nRufus A'Barrow's use of the rod, which Mr. Mayo witnessed in\n\fProfessor W. F. Barrett. [part\nAugust, 1890. The place where the operations were conducted was a\nfarm at Holnest, Dorset, and on sinking at the spot indicated by the\ndowser, water was found. A'Barrow stated that it was through\nwatching a dowser named Kingston at Ditcheat, Somerset, 40 years\npreviously, that he discovered he also had the power of using the rod ;\nthough at first he was disposed to think the indications it gave were\nworthless, he had found they were not so. Kingston was the dowser\nmentioned in No. 26.\nI am also indebted to the Rev. C. H. Mayo for kindly obtaining\nfull particulars of another case of dowsing for water in his neighbour\nhood, which turned out a complete failure ; this will be given on a\nsubsequent page.\nNo. 34.\u2014The following details of a case of successful water-finding\nby means of the divining rod at Meredith, near Gloucester, were\nkindly written for our Society by Sir W. Wedderburn, Bart., M.P.\nIt is an interesting and useful report from the careful description\ngiven. Note the straight rod used by the dowser :\u2014\nMeredith, Gloucester, January 1st, 1888.\nUp to the present year the water supply at Meredith has depended mainly\nupon a well near the house. This well is 54 feet deep, and at the most\nfavourable times is about half full of water ; but after dry seasons, and\nwhen there is a large demand upon it, the level becomes much lower, and in\n1885 there were only about five feet of water. Previous to the summer of\n1887 the seasons had been exceptionally dry, so that the water supply began\nto cause considerable anxiety, and in May and June last the reduced amount\ncoining into the well hardly met the day's consumption.\nUnder these circumstances I determined to sink a new well, and the time\nseemed opportune, because any spring running in so dry a season was not\nlikely to fail at any other time. Also Mr. Price, of Tibberton's Court, had\nrecently employed a water-finder, or \" dow ser,'' who had succeeded in finding\na strong spring on Mr. Langford's farm, at Radford ; and I was inclined to\ntry the same experiment, both because the water-finder, Mr. Thomas Willis,\nof Gloucester, was reported to be very' successful, and because I was curious\nto see the working of the \"divining rod,\" which is generally believed in in\nthis part of the country. Accordingly, Mr. Willis came by appointment on\nthe morning of Monday, 4th July.\nI believe a forked rod is generally used, but this is not the case with Mr.\nWillis, who uses a simple wand, of hazel or honeysuckle for preference, some\n18 inches in length, and as slender as it can be cut. He also uses sometimes\na steel wire, such as can be taken out of the framework of an umbrella,\nand din ing his operations we found that he sometimes tried one kind of wand\nand sometimes another. He had brought a steel wire with him, and began\nby cutting a few wands from a hedge of filbert bushes and from a honeysuckle,\nand he then enquired whereabouts I wanted to find water. I pointed out to\nhim, as the desired site, an orchard near the garden and stables ; and also\nshowed him where the old well is. Mr. Willis is a cabinet-maker by trade,\n\fXXXII.] 57\nOn the So-called Divining Bod.\nand is a quiet young man, apparently about 25 years of age, and seems to be\nof a sensitive temperament. . . . After a few minutes he summoned us\nto where he was and said that he had found a spring. He pointed out the\nexact spot, where we drove in a peg ; and he then showed us how the rod\nworked when held over the spot. What we saw was that the muscles of his\narms appeared to work and twitch as if he was holding the handles of a mild\ngalvanic battery, and the wand or wire, from being straight between his\nhands bent into a sort of bow and worked round like a crank, rotating\nupwards when passing the holder's body. As far as the observers could see,\nMr. Willis was using all his force to keep the rod in its horizontal position,\nand the result of the tight hold he kept of the ends of the rod was that, as it\nrotated, the bark was crushed and twisted at the place where he held it, until\nhe finally let go. When we came to consider the spot thus indicated, we found\nthat it was 40 or 50 paces due south from the old well, and as the strata are\nbelieved to slope from south to north, there appeared reason to think that we\nhad struck upon the spring which supplies the old well. We, therefore,\ndecided to look for another spring further east in the same orchard, and after\na little time Mr. Willis found one, some 30 yards to the east of the first peg.\nAnother peg was driven in to show the centre of the new well to be dug. He\nwas of opinion that the spring last found was a strong one. He does not\nprofess to be able to say at what depth the water will be found, but ordinarily\nhe is not able to detect it at a greater depth than 40 or 50 feet. He thought\nwe should have to go some 25 or 30 feet in the present case. Later on we\ntook him to another field at Rimless Hill, about half a mile off, where I\nwanted to find water. Here he tried for some time, but although he found\nindications of water, he did not think there was a sufficient quantity to justify\ndigging. He also tried in a field below Meredith, to the north, and we\nmarked places where he found water.\nA few days later the new well was commenced on the spot indicated, the\npeg No. 2 being taken as the centre. For 30 feet we went down through red\nmarl, with occasional veins of a somewhat harder rock, but no signs of water.\nWe then came to a stratum, some 4 or 5 inches thick, of hard, tea-green\nstone, and from that time a little water began to come in, trickling in small\nquantities from the sides of the well. This continued till the well was about\n47 feet deep, when water began to come in so fast as to impede the working.\nThe men had to send up three buckets of water for one of marl, and by the\ntime they had completed three feet more the water came in so quickly that\nthey had to stop working. Subsequently experiments were made to ascertain\nwhether there was any connection between the two wells. On the 10th of\nAugust there were about six feet of water in each well, and by levelling we\nascertained that the bottom of the new well was some two feet above the\nsurface of the water in the old well. It was, therefore, not possible that the\nwater in the new well could come from the old well. Also at different times\nwe pumped the water out of the two wells, and found that pumping one well\ndid not affect the level of the water in the other. We, therefore, concluded\nthat there was no connection between the two wells, and that Mr. Willis had\ndiscovered a new spring. We also ascertained that whereas the old well was\nreplenished at the rate of about a gallon in ten minutes, the new well filled at\nthe rate of a gallon a minute, being about ten times the supply of the old one.\n\f58 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nThe water in the two wells was analysed by the public analyst for Gloucester,\nwith the result that the water in the new well was found to be different from\nand superior to the water in the old well.\nAs regards the nature of the phenomena we witnessed, I may note that\nwe were all satisfied of the botut fides of Mr. Willis. It may be added that,\nthough almost always successful, he does not follow the occupation of a water\nfinder professionally, and only accepts a moderate fee after the water has\nbeen dug for and found.\nI can only add two facts mentioned to me by Mr. Willis. One is that he\ncan only detect a spring or running water, tho rod not being in any way\naffected when he stood over a large subterranean reservoir.\nW. Wedderburn.\nIn reply to recent enquiries, Sir W. Wedderburn writes :\u2014\n19, Beaufort Gardens, S.W., February 19M, 1897.\nI have little to add to the account of our water findmg, except that the\nwell continues to give a good supply of water. A few years ago, during a\nvery dry season, I took the opportunity to deepen it a few feet, but\nordinarily the water stands at the original level.\nI do not remember whether in my former communication I mentioned\nthat Mr. Willis told me that a friend of his polarised the steel wire he had\nbeen using to find water, and from that time it would not act. This seems\nto show that electricity has something to do with the phenomenon, and this\nis confirmed by the fact that only moving water (which is accompanied by\nfriction) seems to affect the \" divining rod.\" W Wedderburn.\nThe effect of polarising (magnetising) the steel wire is another of\nthe many illustrations, which this enquiry has brought to light, of the\nprofound influence exercised by a preconceived idea upon the motion\nof the rod. Sir W. Wedderburn would find the inhibitory effect take\nplace equally well if Mr. Willis had been told the wire was magnetised,\nand yet nothing at all done to it. In Germany, 200 years ago, not\nonly hazel and willow and whalebone, but snuffers, tongs, and even a\nlong bent German sausage were used as divining rods according to the\nidea of the particular dowser.\nNo. 35. \u2014Mr. Barber, the principal of a firm of surveyors in\nLondon, writes to me as follows :\u2014\n22, Buckingham Street, Adelphi, W.C., June 26th, 1896.\nI did a large mansion at Ross, in Herefordshire, and there we engaged a\nman who found water by the \"divining rod,\" and plenty of it ; but I can hear\nnothing of him, although I have written to two or three people, but I fancy\nhe came from Wales. In this instance I spent a morning with him going\nover the Estate, and suddenly he broke out into a fearful perspiration, and,\nafter tapping about the earth for some time, declared there was water\nbeneath. Wo sank a well, and there was. I may add that water is very\nscarce in that neighbourhood, and at the time the man was considered very\nclever, and my client was delighted. Walter W. Barber\n\fXXXII.] 59\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nMr. Barber is unable to remember the name of the dowser, but it\nwas probably Mr. Heighway ; see Group IX. This letter is only\nquoted as an instance of the remarkable, and, I believe, perfectly\ngenuine and uncontrollable, physiological effect which seems, in many\ncases, to accompany the dowser's discovery of an underground spring.\nNo. .36.\u2014In his little book on the divining rod, published at Cleve\nland, U.S.A., in 1876, Mr. Chas. Latimer, a civil engineer of repute in\nOhio, gives several instances of his success as a dowser, especially in\ndiscovering the exact depth at which water would be found. This he\narrives at by noting the position when the forked twig turns to 45 deg.\nas at A, then walking on till it points vertically downwards as at B ;\nhe concludes from this that B A the depth of the water\nfrom the surface B C is equal \/ to the distance traversed,\nA B ; B A C and B C A \/ being equal angles : he\nstates he has verified this \/ repeatedly. This would be\nvery satisfactory if it could be ' established, but Mr. Latimer fur\nnishes no conclusive evidence O 0f his theory, and the effect he\nhas observed may be due to his own unconscious suggestion on the\nmotion of the rod.\nIn the Cleveland Leader (September, 1893) Mr. Whitelaw, the\nengineer to the township waterworks, states that the severe testa to\nwhich he has submitted Mr. Latimer have completely destroyed the\nprofound scepticism he previously entertained as to the value of the\nindications afforded by the divining rod. Mr. Whitelaw narrates\nseveral of these tests ; amongst others he took Mr. L. to a particular\nsquare where he (Mr. W.) knew, but the public did not know, that\nthere was a certain water main running diagonally across the square.\nCasually remarking (apparently to mislead Mr. Latimer) : \"You know\nthere are no mains in the square,\" they proceeded to cross it. At a\ncertain spot the rod in Mr. Latimer's hand turned downwards, and\nMr. L. remarked, \"there is certainly something here.\" This was\ncorrect. Mr. Whitelaw adds : \" When we came directly over the main\nthe butt of the rod pointed down to it, and he (Mr. Latimer) told me\nthe depth as well as I knew it myself.\" This experiment was repeated\nwith equal success at other parts of the town, so that Mr. Whitelaw\nasserts Mr. Latimer found the different water mains and their depths\nas accurately as if he had gained beforehand a minute knowledge of\ntheir location. Of Mr. Latimer's good faith and high position the\nreport furnishes evidence.\nI add the following cases reported in newspapers, for which I\nhave not been able to obtain any confirmation ; partly because they\nare of some interest when taken together with the others, partly\n\f60 [part\nProfessor W.

Barrett.\nbecause I may possibly receive confirmation of some of tbem from\nreaders of this paper.\nNo. 37.\u2014The Isle of Wight Express, for March 18th, 1893, contains\nan interesting report of the success of two amateur dowsers at\nShanklin. It seems that the Local Board were in straits for want\nof a good water supply Eventually they employed Mullins, whose\nremarkable career as a dowser will be evident later ; Mullins came and\nfixed on two spots where, he said, water would be found. The Local\nBoard employed a well sinker, Mr. Parsons, and then the majority\nthought they knew better than Mullins, and made a boring in a\ndifferent place. The report goes on :\u2014\nThe Board paid a gentloman to tell them where the water was ; but in\ntheir wisdom they decided to try a spot of their own choosing, with the\nresult that Mr. Parsons has gone to a considerable depth, and broken his\ntools, without discovering the precious liquid. The divining abilities of\nMr. Mullins were looked at very sceptically by some, because there seemed\nto be no reason why the hazel twig should rise when Mr. Mullins passed\nover a spring ; but this divining quality dwells in others besides Mr.\nMullins.\nTwo members of the Local Board, Messrs. J. Bailey and J. Milman\nBrown, have found themselves possessed with the unknown power, and in\nconsequenco have been making experiments in the Great Woods, with the\nresult that they have proved, to their own satisfaction, at least, that strong\nsprings exist in the places indicated by Mr. Mullins, but stronger ones in\nother prats higher up the hill. The Board at their last meeting granted \u00a310\nto these two gentlemen to experiment with, and they have thought it best to\ntry the strongest spot marked by Mr. Mullins first. This they have done,\nand after going down 22 feet, water was found and has risen 9 feet 10\ninches. This is very gratifying.\nOur Shanklin correspondent accompanied Messrs. Brown and Bailey\non one of their divining expeditions and witnessed the marvellous\nphenomenon ; and while no explanation can be given, it is a fact beyond\ndispute that the twig turns over with an irresistible impulse when the\noperator is in the vicinity of a spring and cannot be kept back even by\nforce. The experimenters are delighted with their success.\nA Mr. Watson, a carter in the employ of Mr. Moorman, has the divining\nquality even more strongly developed than Messrs. Brown and Bailey, and\nhas amused himself and his friends by being blindfolded after indicating a\nspring and again finding the same spot.\nNo. 38. \u2014The Dublin Daily Express for January 15th, 1889, states\nthat :\u2014\nA farmer named Griffen, living at Knocknaboley, near Tinahely, having\nseen the divining rod used for finding water in America, whence he had lately\nreturned, discovered that he also could use it. Accordingly, finding on his\nreturn that his family were carrying water from a great distance, he tried\n\fXXXII.] 61\nOn the So-called Divining Rod,\nthe rod, which, contrary to the local belief, as the house was on a hill,\nindicated an underground spring close to the house. A well was therefore\ndug at this spot, and at a depth of only six feet, a splendid spring was struck,\nwhich has since given a copious supply.\nI should be glad of any confirmation of the above statement from\nthose living in the neighbourhood : Tinahely is a town in co. Wicklow.\nNo. 39.\u2014The next account is taken from the Western Mercury of\nMarch 1st, 1890.\nThe divining rod, as a means of finding a good supply of water, stood\na very successful trial last week at Oundle, Northamptonshire. Mr. W,\nTodd, a landowner, requiring a well on a portion of his property, sent for a\ndiviner, a man named Pearson. There has lately been some considerable\ndifficulty in obtaining water in this town, and the Commissioners have spent\n\u00a383 in trial borings. Although these trials were conducted by a professional\nman, they proved futile. In the presence of a number of spectators drawn\ntogether by the novelty of the experiment, Mr. Pearson walked over the\nestate with the usual V-shaped hazel twig. The rod was visibly agitated in\nseveral places, but the diviner kept on until it almost bent itself double in\nhis hands. At this spot he indicated with confidence that a good supply of\nwater would be found. A well was accordingly sunk with the result that at\n17 feet deep, water was found in such abundance that it rapidly rose to\nwithin three feet of the surface, at which height it has since remained.\nI wrote to Mr. Todd, but have had no reply, and should therefore\nbe glad of any further information from the Oundle Commissioners or\nfrom my geological friends.\nNo. 40.\u2014I had not before heard of the \"dowser\" named in the\naccompanying paragraph, which is taken from the Wisbech Standard\nof October 24th, 1890 :\u2014\nMr. F. Road, of Wisbech Market, experienced great difficulty in\ngetting a proper supply of water in a green field occupied by him at World's\nEnd. The result was that the aid of Mr. William Upcroft Hill was called in,\nand, by means of the divining rod, a spot was indicated and fixed upon, and\nwell-sinking begun at once, the result being that at a depth of eleven feet a\nplentiful and continuous supply of water was obtained. In this case, at\nleast, the use of the \" divining rod \" has been attended with success.\nI wrote to Mr. Read for further particulars, but my letter was\nreturned with the intimation that he had left the neighbourhood.\nNo. 41.\u2014The Blackburn Standard of June 2nd, 1894, has a lengthy\nletter from an architect, Mr. T. C. M. Crook, giving an account of\nsome successful dowsing operations in the neighbourhood of Black\nburn by a dowser named Mr. Blanchard, of Wisbech, of whom\nI had not before heard. The first experiment was at Stanley\n\f62 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nGrange, Samlesbury, where a spot was fixed on by the dowser,\nand the spring said by him to be about 40 feet from the\nsurface. A six-inch bore hole was made, and at forty feet water\nrose in the tube to within sixteen feet of the surface. The owner\ndetermined to go deeper to see if he could get a larger supply, and\nbored down 232 feet, finally breaking his tools in the rook, but he\nwas disappointed, the greater depth was useless. He then sunk a well\nsix feet in diameter and 36 feet deep on the same spot, and found\nan abundant supply ; the dowser having remarked that the small\nbore-hole might not cover the whole of the water veins he had\nindicated. In two other places in the neighbourhood of Bridge Hall\nand Samlesbury paper mills, the dowser fixed on sites where water\nwould be found, and in both cases a plentiful supply was found at\nthese sites and at the depth stated by the dowser. It would seem how\never that the depth was approximately the same (40 feet) in all cases,\nso that probably at that depth a water bearing stratum was reached,\nyielding water anywhere it was tapped. Mr. Crook, on the other hand,\nstates that at 20 feet from the surface a very hard rock, mostly of red\nsandstone, was reached and continued to a great depth. If the facts\nare correctly given, the interesting point is that a stranger, from a\ndistant part of England, who probably knew nothing of, and cared still\nless for, geology, hits upon the exact depth where water is actually\nfound. It may be a chance coincidence, but it is of frequent occurrence\nin other cases ; or it may be the dowser had secretly made inquiries in\nthe neighbourhood as to the usual depth of wells ; but this is not their\npractice, as they seem to have a supreme contempt for everything but\ntheir own infallibility.\nThrough the kindness of one of our American members, Mr.\nAlbree, of Allegheny, U.S.A., I received particulars of a remarkable\ncase of successful dowsing which appeared in the Pittsburg Leader for\nJanuary 14th, 1897 ; but when Mr. Albree, at my request, made\nprivate enquiries into the facts, he was unable to obtain any confirma\ntion of them. The narrative is therefore omitted. It was, however,\ninteresting to note the names by which a dowser is known in parts of\nAmerica, viz , \"water-witch\" and \"water-smeller.\"\nAfter the miscellaneous cases in this Group had been printed, I\nreceived a collection of interesting cases relative to an amateur\nAmerican dowser, Mr. Cyrus Fuller, which had been in Mr. Hodgson's\npossession for some time. This additional evidence, which might fitly\nhave come in here, has been placed later, (see Group X.), partly to\navoid alterations in the numbering of the cases already printed, and\npartly because it forms a small group by itself.\n\fxxxn.] On the So-culled Divining Rod. 63\nAt the close of each group I will add thefailures in that group that\nI have been able to discover, i.e., where the dowser has been wrong ; a\nboring having been made or a well sunk at the spot indicated by the rod,\nand no water found at or beyond the depth he predicted. These cases\nwill be lettered F 1, F 2, etc. It has been much more difficult to\nobtain first-hand evidence of these failures than of successes ; the\nprejudice against dowsing amongst the educated classes readily lends\nitself to rumours of failure, and I have found it a most laborious\nmatter to trace such rumours to their source, often with the result\nthat the failure was only in the actual depth or volume of water\nobtained not corresponding with the figures predicted by the dowser.\nAt the same time there are unquestionably several cases of absolute\nand complete failure. The number of these it is very difficult to\nascertain with any approach to accuracy ; all that can be said is that\nthe number varies with the particular dowser employed ; some men\n( a) who claim to possess the faculty of water-finding being evidently\ncharlatans or self-deluded, whatever success they have had being\ndoubtless due to pure chance. * On the other hand (\/3) some of the most\nremarkable water-finders, such as the late J. Mullins, occasionally\nfail in their prediction, as might be expected. Here are the\nonly two failures I have met with in the group of miscellaneous\ncases; both appear to belong to the former class (a).\nF 1.\u2014I am indebted to the Rev. C. H. Mayo, M.A., for the\nfollowing instance of failure. Mr. Mayo says, after giving me instances\nof the successful use of the rod :\u2014\nLong Burton Vicarage, Sherborne, January 21st, 1897.\nTwo other wells have been sunk at farms in Holnest, Dorsetshire, on\nthe divination of other water-finders ; one at Dyer's Farm,\u2014which has been\nsuccessful,\u2014the other at Bye-water Farm, which has proved a lamentable\nfailure. In the latter case, attempted early in 1895. a boring has been\ncarried through dense clay to the depth of 269 feet, with no result beyond\na useless expenditure of money, and the work has ceased. Holnest is\nsituated on a thick bed of Oxford clay, capped with gravel here and there.\nI wrote at once to ascertain further particulars and the name of\nthe dowser. But Mr. Mayo could give me no more information, and\ntwo or three letters I addressed with the same object to the occupier\nof Rye-water Farm met with no response.\nSubsequently Mr. Mayo most kindly ascertained for me the facts;\nthese are given in his letter which follows : \u2014\nLong Burton Vicarage, Sherborne, Dorset,\nFebruary 19th, 1897.\nI have been endeavouring to collect some further particulars relating to\nthe case of Rye-water Farm, and have spoken to Mr. S. Thorne, the agent\nof the property, on the subject.\n\f64 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nIt seems that two water-finders visited this farm\u2014viz., W. J. Mitchell,\nof Cerne Abbas, Dorset (see enclosed memorandum), and shortly after,\nA. Russell, of Sturminstor, Newton Common, Dorset. Both traced (it is\naffirmed) the spring along the same course. A well was begun, and then\nabandoned, and another begun close by, which was dug for 30 feet (4 feet\ndiameter), and then bored for 269 feet more through clay. No water was\nfound, and at this depth the head of the borer was broken off, and I believe\nstill remains at the bottom of the hole.\nI am told that Mitchell also claimed to discover gold by means of the\nrod, and met with a sovereign which had been concealed under a stone.\nAlso, when using the rod, he trembled \"and became as pale as death.\"\nSince writing the above, I have interviewed the wife of the tenant who\nwas at the farm when the boring took place. Apparently, one well was sunk\nfor 30 feet, and then bored for 90 feet, following the prognostications of\nMitchell, and proved a failure. It was then filled up, and another water-\nfinder, Russell, consulted, whereupon the second well was dug for 30 feet\ndeep, very near the former, and as before stated, bored for 269 feet in\naddition, without result, till the breaking of the head of the borer stopped\nthe work. These operations account for the time between the visit of\nMitchell on March 23rd, 1893, and the boring which I witnessed in the\nspring of 1895. I have in my diary a memorandum written in May, 1895:\u2014\n\" This spring a well has been bored at Holnest (Rye-water Farm) for 269 feet\nwithout meeting water. The spot was indicated by Mitchell, of Cerne, and\nRussell, of Sturminster Common, with divining rods.\"\nI hope these particulars will supply w7hat you require. I shall be happy\nto help further if y>u still have any other point to clear up.\nC. H. Mayo.\nP.S.\u2014I am informed that the second water-finder, Russell, was called in\nwhen the former of the two wells had been sunk with no effect. \u2014 C.H.M.\nMemorandum.\nMr. W. J. Mitchell, of Cerne, attended at Rye-water Farm on Thursday,\nMarch 23rd, 1893. I cannot find I have an entry of Mr. Russell's coming,\nbut he did shortly after Mr. Mitchell, and found the same spot as marked\nby Mitchell. S TH0Mns\nI know nothing beyond the above of the two dowsers named,\nMessrs. Mitchell and Russell, no record of any successes on their part\nhaving reached me.\nF. 2.\u2014The next case of failure illustrates the fact of a would-be-\ndowser having evidently mistaken his vocation.\nMr. W. H. Barber, the head of a firm of surveyors in Buckingham\nStreet, Adelphi (see case No. 35), sent me a memorandum he\nhad received from Mr. Pullen, a friend of his in Guernsey, giving\na list of wells sunk in Guernsey through the indications afforded by\nthe divining rod. The dowser in this case was a Guernsey resident,\n\fXXXII.] 65\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\na Mr. Mellish, who apparently wrote the memorandum himself. In\nsubsequent correspondence I received from Mr. Mellish particulars of\nnumerous cases where, according to his statement, attempts to find\nwater by sinking wells or boring had been made unsuccessfully in\nvarious places in Guernsey before his visit, and how in each case ha\nhad, through the indications afforded by the divining rod, been able\nto find water close by and at a less depth than the useless wells. I\nwrote to each of the addresses given and received replies from the\nmajority of the persons named. In no single instance was Mr.\nMellish's statement confirmed. Mr. Mellish's claim to possess the\n\" dowsing faculty,\" if such there be, is therefore so far entirely\nuncorroborated. This is the only instance I have met with of what\nlooks like a deliberate attempt to mislead in the course of this\nprolonged investigation. I communicated the foregoing facts to Mr.\nBarber, who replies that he was greatly surprised, for \" both Mr.\nPullen and a friend of his have seen Mellish at work with the rod,\nand also found water as the result.\"\nEvidence of Professional Dowsers.\nLet us now examine some of the evidence afforded by contemporary\nprofessional dowsers\u2014that is to say, by those who make a livelihood,\noften a very handsome livelihood, out of the use of the divining rod.\nIt will already have been noticed that the majority of dowsers a genera\ntion ago came from Somersetshire ; from the esteem in which the\n\"gift \" is still held in that county this might be expected, just as the\nmajority of French dowsers used to come (and perhaps still come) from\nDauphiny. Thus about two-thirds of the English professional dowsers,\nwhose names have been given in the miscellaneous cases, lived in\nSomersetshire, and others hard by, in Gloucestershire, Dorset, and\nWiltshire.\nBesides the foregoing, I know of nearly a score of contemporary\nprofessional dowsers in England and Wales, and there are doubtless\nothers of whom I have not heard. With the following I have been in\ncorrespondence and with some have had interviews and experimental\ntrials :\u2014Messrs. W. S. Lawrence, J. Mullins, senr. (both of these famous\ndowsers have died since the beginning of this inquiry), H. W. Mullins,\nW. Mereweather, W. Stone, B. Tompkins, J. Stears, L. Gataker,\nT. Heighway, H. Chesterman, H. Bacon, F. Rodwell, W. Rothwell\nand R. W. Robertson.\nI will begin with a few cases from Mr. W. Lawrence, who was one\nof the most remarkable and successful dowsers of this century. I\nF\n\f66 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nmuch regret that Mr. Lawrence's death renders the evidence here pre\nsented of his powers so very meagre ; his family would render a service\nto science if they would collect a trustworthy record of their father's\nexperiences in water-finding.\nGroup III.\u2014(n) Mb. W. S. Lawrence.\nThe oldest of the professional dowsers is Mr. W. Scott Laurencc,\nwho resides at Bishopston, Bristol, where he is much respected.i\nHis local standing is seen from the fact that he has heen a\nPoor Law Guardian, was Chairman of the Highway Board, and\nfor 21 years successively was elected vicar's churchwarden. He is a\nretired stone merchant, and is a hale and fine-looking old gentleman\nin his 86th year, the father of no less than 17 children ! One of his\nsons, Dr. Lawrence, is a distinguished West of England physician, and\nis consulting physician to the Bristol General Hospital ; another, a\nclergyman in the Church of England, appears to have inherited his\nfather's peculiar \"gift,\" and in reply to enquiry stated that he could\nnot control the motion of the rod, which appeared to be even more\nviolently affected with him than with his father. For 60 years Mr.\nW. S. Lawrence has been in repute as a \" water finder,\" and judging\nfrom the lengthy list of testimonials he has received, his career in this\ndirection has been singularly successful.2\nSeveral instances of Mr. Lawrence's success are quoted in the\nprevious S.P.R. report, and I had hoped in the appendix to this paper\nto have given a summary of Mr. Lawrence's experiences since that\ni Since the ahove was in type, the death of this remarkable octogenarian diviner\nhas occurred, as already mentioned ; Mr. Lawrence died in June, 1896.\na In the following letter (which was addressed to Mr. C. E. De Ranee, F.G.S.,\nMr. W. S. Lawrence describes how he happened to discover that he possessed the\ndowsing faculty.\nBishopston, October 5th, 1893.\n[Many years ago] my father was the contractor for building a new Rectory House\nat Winterbourne, Gloucestershire. In the contract he was to find a supply of spring\nwater, and had to sink a well for such ; he had done this to about 40 ft. deep without\nsuccess, when an old working man, a gardener, who passed the spot every day, stated\nit was quite useless to go on sinking it, being in the wrong spot. On being asked to\nmark the right spot, he went to the hedge of a field and cut a hazel forked stick, and\non arriving at the well marked a spot about 15 ft. away from the well, and desired us\nto sink there, which we accordingly did, and at about 15 ft. deep obtained a valuable\nspring of water. I then was about 20 years of age, and asked him to allow me to try\nand see if the forked twig would act same with me, but he said it would [probably]\nbe quite useless ; but if I would call on him next day at his cottage he would test me.\nI did so, and he placed in my hands a small steel watch spring, and desired me\nto walk about the kitchen with such, and to his great surprise it acted with me similar\nto what it did in his own hands. This was to prove and ascertain if I had the power,\nas he knew there was a capital spring of water under the floor of the cottage ; he then\nstated his great surprise, he said as many as 100 persons had been there previously, and\n\fXXXII.] 67\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nreport. Mr. Lawrence was, however, too ill to give me the necessary\ninformation or references when I applied to him in the spring of 1896.\nMr. Lawrence had previously furnished me with references to\nabout 100 different people, for whom he has successfully found water\nby the ' rod.' The list includes such well-known names as the Duke\nof Grafton, Lord Spencer, Lord Heytesbury, Lord Justice Fry, Sir\nH. W. Peak, Sir H. Selwyn Ibbetson, Lord Arthur Cecil, etc.\nNo. 42.\u2014The following is from Mr. George H. Pope, the Treasurer\nof the Merchant Venturers' Society of Bristol, whose kindness I have\nalready acknowledged in sending me other evidence.\nThe Manor House, Clifton, Bristol, December 30th, 1896.\nOn the estates which I look after we always employ a \"dowser,\" and I\ndo not recollect any instance of failure to find water ; we never sink a well\nbefore using the rod.\nMy friend, Mr. R. W. Butterworth, (now of Percy House, Kensington,\nBath) can tell you, I believe, that he sunk a deep well on his property at\nHenbury, near Bristol, without getting any water ; that he then consulted a\ndowser (Mr. Lawrence) who asserted the presence of a spring a few feet oft\" ;\nthat he drove a horizontal shaft from his own dry well in the direction\nindicated, and struck a copious spring, as predicted\u2014but I should like him\nto tell you his own story.\nI once allowed an experiment to be made on one of our farms by\nProfessor Sollas, and an account of it is given in Vol. II., pp. 73-78 of the\nProceedings of the S.P.R., but in my opinion the experiment proved little\nor nothing.* Gborge h p0pE\nI wrote to Mr. Butterworth as suggested by Mr. Pope. In reply,\nMr. Butterworth states he cannot now recall the exact particulars, as\nthe experiment was made so long ago. Happily, however, I found\nMr. Crisp, of Bristol, the architect of Mr. Butterworth's house, had\nalready put the facts on record, and they were printed in the appendix\nto Mr. Pease's S.P.R. report. Here is Mr. Crisp's letter :\u2014\nBristol, March Uth, 1883.\nPrior to sinking the well, we consulted a geologist as to the probability\nof finding water, and at what depth. He informed us that it was not likely\nnever one [had the rod] acted with previous. From which time I have made use\nboth of steel spring and hazel rod. I do not believe I have any power without the\nrod or spring to discover such.\nYou may make any use whatever of these remarks. I have just returned from a\nvisit to Aboynes and Drum Castle, Aberdeen, where I was sent for to go over o\nlarge quantity of land, farms, etc., and I marked about 30 or 40 places for sinking. I\nshall be most happy to give you any further information. w s LAWBEnOg\nP.S.\u2014I am now in my 84th year, and write this without the aid of glasses.\ni With this I quite agree, judging from the report Professor Sollas has\npublished.\u2014W. F. B.\nr 2\n\f63 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nthat water would bo fouml until we had sunk through the bed of the moun\ntain limestone existing there, and which was about 150ft. deep, when we\nshould come on a bed of clay and find an abundant supply of water. This\napplied to the district where this stone exists, and therefore the well could\nbe sunk in any part with the same chances of finding water. We accordingly\nsunk a shaft to a depth of 150ft. through the rock, and then bored 10ft.,\nbut found no water. This may perhaps be accounted for to some extent, as\nby ill luck we came in contact with some faults (or saddle-backs as they are\nsometimes termed) in the rock. We then called in Mr. Lawrence with his\nrod ; he held it over the mouth of the well and it was motionless, and Mr.\nLawrence stated it was no use sinking any deeper there ; he then walked in\na spiral line round the well, and when at a distance of about 20ft., the rod\nmoved vigorously, but nowhere else near the well. With his advice we\ndrove a level heading from the shaft at a depth of about 100ft. from the\nsurface, towards the spot indicated by the rod, and after proceeding about\n30ft. the water suddenly flowed in at the end of the heading, and the men\nhad to leave the heading at once and get to the surface. Since this there has\nbeen a good and regular supply of water. i H j qrisp\nMr. Mereweather, the contractor who sank the well, also gave a\nsimilar account in a letter he wrote long ago to Mr. Vaughan Jenkins,\nwhich the latter has sent me. Mr. Mereweather says the water was\nstruck when the heading reached 24 feet from the shaft of the well ;\nhere they came upon a fissure in the rock which yielded so large a\nsupply that the pumps were fixed at 80 feet from the surface.\nNo. 43.\u2014Very similar testimony is borne by another architect,\nMr. Henry Shaw, of New Broad Street, London. Here also a deep\nwell was bored and no water found. Mr. Lawrence's aid was sought.\nThe rod indicated water only a few yards from the old boring. A\nwell was sunk, and 14 yards from the surface an abundant supply of\nwater was obtained. The contractors, and the foreman who sunk\nthe well, also send letters about this case, which will be found in\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., pp. 103 and 104. The foreman says\nthat when Mr. Lawrence came to a certain spot the twig jumped\nviolently up and down. A steel spring was then tried by the dowser\nwith the same result. The position of the underground spring was\nthen marked. The foreman also says that, owing to a drain being in\nthe way, he had to dig a little on one side of the spot marked by\nLawrence as the centre. On sinking to 40 feet \" the spring burst out,\nas large as a hammer handle, beneath the very spot he [the dowser]\nhad marked for the centre of the well.\"\ni In the previous S.P.R. report. Vol. II., p. 105, a note is added stating Mr. Crisp's\naccount was \" confirmed by Mr. Butterworth, the owner of the house, Mr. Lawrence\nand others. There is some slight discrepancy in the measurements, which, however,\ndoes not materially affect the case.\"\n\fXXXII.] 69\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nNo. 44.\u2014The next case is an illustration of the implicit faith in his\ndowsing power which Mr. Lawrence appears to have inspired in those\nwho had employed him. The letter, which is too long to quote in full,\nis from the before-mentioned well-sinker and contractor, Mr. Mere-\nweather, who subsequently found he also could use the rod, and has\nhad some success as a dowser. The following summary gives the chief\nfacts :\u2014\nThe late Dr. Fox, of Brislington, directed Mr. Mereweather to sink a\nwell to supply the Lunatic Asylum at that place. Instead of sinking at the\nspot suggested by the contractor, Dr. Fox took him to the Park and after\nsearching found an iron peg driven in the ground, where he told the\ncontractor to sink the well. Dr. Fox gave as his reason that Mr. Lawrence\nhad been over the ground with his divining rod and fixed on that place. The\nwell was sunk 90 feet through Pennant stone and no water found. Dr. Fox\ninsisted that the work should go on, as he had absolute confidence that water\nwould be found, but as the contractor's experience was dead against finding\nwater there, he (Dr. Fox) at last consented to a four inch bore hole being\ndriven ; this was done and after 35 feet had been bored (125 feet from the\nsurface) a large body of water was struck, which has supplied the Asylum\never since, has never failed, and could not be pumped dry.\nNo. 45.\u2014The following letter gives a graphic account by an eye\nwitness of the muscular spasm which seems to lay hold of some\ndowsers (especially Mr. Lawrence) when they are over, or have reason\nto believe they are over, an underground spring. The letter was sent\nto me by my friend, Mr. H. W. Whitaker, the well-known geologist.\nI ought perhaps to add, to prevent misconception, that Mr. Whitaker is\nan utter disbeliever in the dowsing rod, or in any practical good\nresulting from its use.\nApril, 1890.\nWe went yesterday and saw the divining rod used, and a stranger\nperformance I never saw. The diviner, named Lawrence, an old white-\nhaired, benevolent-faced man, walked about the place for some time, it\nappeared fruitlessly, holding between each finger and thumb a piece of flat\nsteel wire bent round into a sort of horseshoe shape. This, he told us, would\ndetect minerals as well as water, so that when it presently began to agitate\nas it did, scriggling, and wriggling, and twisting, and turning in his fingers,\nhe could not say definitely that it was water he had come upon, until he took\nin his hand a strong forked hazel twig, holding an end of each fork in each\nhand, and keeping his elbows tightly down to his side. I can only\ndescribe the antics of that twig as a pitched battle between itself and him !\nIt twisted, it knocked about, it contracted and contorted the muscles of his\nhands and arms, it wriggled, and fought, and kicked, until it snapped in two\n\u2014and then\u2014what made it painful to watch until you got used to it, the old\nman reeled, and clutched hold of any one nearest to him for a few moments.\nIt evidently exhausts him very much, though afterwards I asked him what\neffect it had on him, and he said it only made his heart beat most violently\n\f70 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nfor a short time. Certainly it has not shortened his life ! Having found\nthat spring, (I must tell you the wire and twig will not act over stagnant\nwater), the farmer asked him to try if there was a spring nearer home. He\ndid not find one until, having gone into the garden, ho suddenly came upon\none close to the hall door. After that, he went further afield, and found\ntwo some distance from the house. He can also tell the direction the water\ntakes underground and the probable depth they will have to bore for it.\nMr. C.'s lawyer was there \" to watch the case \" ; he was must sceptical, but\nwas obliged to own that if they find the spring he must believe ! He went\nbehind Lawrence, and held his wrists with all his strength, to try and keep\nhim quiet while the twig moved, but he could not.\nI asked Lawrence how he found out he possessed the power, and he told\nus that 60 years ago he saw a cottager do it, so he tried himself, and found\nhe possessed the same property. We tried, Lady D. and I, but needless to\nsay, we could do nothing. Lawrence makes no mystery of it, though he\ncannot explain it ; he says it is a gift. He was asked if he could mesmerise,\nand he said, no. He held the wire over Lady D. 's watch, and it wriggled just\nas it had done over the water.\nWe are going to see the water when it has been found, to see the\nconclusion of the matter.\nIn a later letter, dated May 1890, the same lady relates that, the\nfanner having expressed doubts as to the genuineness of the proceedings,\nLawrence was taken again to the farm and blindfolded. The rod\nperformed in exactly the same manner, on reaching the spot where it\nhad indicated the water before. They then dug, and found the spring\nat 15 feet depth.\nNo. 46.\u2014Lady Dorothy Nevill sent to the Pall Mall Gazette, of\nFebruary 13th, 1897, an account of the successful dowsing for water at\na convent at Mayfield, in Sussex ; a place which was once the palace of\nSir Thomas Gresham. There being a need of water, the aid of an amateur\ndowser was sought. He traversed the grounds, and fixed on a certain\nspot where he said water would be found. Before digging a well a\nsecond dowser was called in some time after ; he selected the same\nspot as the previous one had done. Accordingly a well was dug, and\nat 30 feet deep water was found. Subsequently they wanted a well\nnearer the house, and sunk at another spot which both the amateur\nand expert dowsers had also fixed upon. Again water was found, and\nboring to a greater depth they have had an inexhaustible supply.\nI have also had accounts of this case sent to me by personal\nfriends ; it is interesting, and whilst the fixing upon similar spots by\nindependent dowsers is important, yet we are not told what precautions\nwere taken to prevent any knowledge of the spots chosen by the first\ndowser reaching the second.\nLady D. Nevill, at my request, kindly forwarded to the Superioress\nof the Convent a letter I wrote asking for further particulars. In\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 71\nreply, I was informed that they had little additional information to\nimpart ; but, in answer to my questions, stated the expert was Mr. W. S.\nLawrence, and the date of the experiment, June, 1893. The place was\nMayfield, in Sussex, and the depth of the well sunk was 270 feet.\nThey did not know what precautions were taken at Lawrence's visit,\nand so far as they knew no previous attempt to sink a well had been\nmade. The name of the amateur dowser they were not at liberty to give.\nLady Dorothy Nevill says the expert used a watch spring as his\ndivining rod, which was Lawrence's custom, and that \" he went into\na species of convulsions, shook and trembled at the spots he considered\nto be over the water.\"\nNo. 47.\u2014The next case is taken from the Bristol Times and\nMirror of May 17th, 1890:\u2014\nMr. Lawrence marked two spots on the farm of Mr. Prout, Frampton-\non-Severn, where he stated springs of water would be found, and in\neach case, after boring 10 feet, water was struck, and rose to within 6\nfeet of the surface ; but as many persons said that water might be found\nin any other part of the field which Mr. Lawrence had passed over, the\ntenant, to test this matter, directed the men to bore in another part to\nthe same depth, and the result proved the subsoil to be perfectly dry.\nBoth the steward and tenant consider the trial to be most satisfactory, and\nthat Mr. Lawrence possesses, in a most remarkable degree, the power of\nfinding water by aid of his divining rod. The following letters on the\nsubject, have been received by Mr. Lawrence :\u2014\n\" Dursley, May 10th, 189*.\n\"I have seen the two places at Mr. Prout's farm where they bored\nat the spots indicated by you with the divining rod, and in both places\nthere appears to be a good supply of water. Mr. Prout told me that\nhe had also bored at a place between the other two, and which you had\npassed over without indicating water, and found the subsoil perfectly dry.\nThis is a very satisfactory proof that you possess an extraordinary power of\nindicating where water is to be found. Tkewren Vizard.\n\" The Park Farm, Frampton-on-Severn.\n\" Dear Mr. Lawrence,\u2014We thought you would be pleased to hear that,\nafter a few hours' work, on Friday the men came upon a spring of water\nabout ten feet down, the spot being just outside the garden gate, on a line\nwith.the place in the garden. We have since bored at the place where you\nfirst declared there was a spring, and likewise found, at just about the same\ndepth, and the water rises to within nearly six feet of the surface of the\nground. Because some people were suggesting that perhaps water might be\nfound anywhere in the same ground, we have made the men bore to the\nsame depth midway between the places where water has been found in\nsprings, and none has been found there ; so I should now think that every\none must be convinced and satisfied that you can find a spring of water.\nKate Prout.\"\n\f72 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nNo. 48.\u2014I will conclude this group by quoting two or three letters,\naddressed to Mr. Lawrence, out of many similar testimonials that I\nhave read. The first is a letter from Samuel Lang, Esq., Bristol.\nAfter vain endeavours to obtain a supply of water for my kennels,\nand sinking 130 feet deep, I was advised to send for you, who, by\naid of your divining rod, in my presence, indicated the spot within 20\nfeet of the spot where I had sunk, and directed me to drive there, which I\ndid, and obtained at 30 feet deep most plentiful supply. I have the greatest\nbelief in your powers with the divining rod. Samuel Lang\nNo. 49.\u2014The next (from the Ely Paper Works, Cardiff), is quoted\nin answer to an objection sometimes made that no larye supply of\nunderground water has ever been found by a dowser.\nMay, 1888.\nAt your request we have much pleasure in stating the result of your visit\nto our works. We sunk two wells in spots marked by you ; in the first one\nwe have a supply of over 20,000 gallons per hour at a depth of 31 feet ;\nand in the other, about 300 yards away from the first, a supply of 12,000 to\n14,000 gallons per hour of spring water. EvAnS And QwEy\nAgain, we have the following addressed to Mr. Lawrence :\u2014\nNo. 50.\u2014From the Bristol Municipal Charity Trustees.\nFebruary 26th, 1892.\nIn reply to yours of yesterday's date, I am directed by the Trustees of\nthe Bristol Municipal Charities to state that they have much pleasure in\nrecording the fact that you were most successful with your divining rod in\ndiscovering water at the spot on their estate at Burnett, on which they\nafterwards bored, though the surface certainly afforded no evidence of the\npresence of water there. Fred W Nbwton> Secretary.\n(\/3) Mr. W. Mereweather.\nThe name of Mr. Mereweather has occurred in connection with\nsome of the preceding cases. It will be convenient if I give here the\naccount Mr. Mereweather has kindly sent me of his own use of the\ndowsing rod, for he found it was so successful in his hands that he\nconstantly uses it now when consulted about the best site to sink a\nwell, his business being that of a well-sinker and contractor at\nBedminster, near Bristol. Those who regard a professional dowser as\na professional rogue will be surprised to hear that Mr. Mereweather,\nlike the late Mr. Lawrence, is highly respected in his own neighbour\nhood. He is a Poor Law Guardian and Vice-Chairman of the\nBoard. He was also for three years on the Bristol Town Council.\n\fXXXII.] 73\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nIn reply to my enquiries, Mr. Mereweather gave the following account\nof his powers :\u2014\nSouth View House, West-street, Bedminster, Bristol,\nMay 1st, 1893.\nFor the last 45 years I have been more or less engaged as a contractor for\nwater works, and in a great many cases I have executed the work for Mr.\nWm. Scott Lawrence, who is noted for his power to find water. Finding\nwhat Mr. Lawrence said to come true, although I did not believe in the\ndivining rod, I made an engagement to meet him, and after he had used the\ntwig or steel spring, and pointed out where the water was, I asked him to let\nme try, and to my great astonishment, I could not keep it down, the tighter\nI held it the greater the indentation it made in my fingers, until I was obliged\nto let it go. It is about 16 years ago since I first tried it.\nI do not know whether this power is hereditary, but I find that my\nyoungest son can use it as well as myself. I do not notice any particular\nsensation in using the spring, but upon coming over underground water it\nsuddenly seems to stiffen in my hands, raises itself up and turns towards the\nbody. I notice there is a quicker motion wherever I find, on boring, the\nwater is near the surface, or if there is a plentiful supply deeper down.\nIn the year 1880 I was consulted respecting the water supply at the\nresidence of the late Captain Quayle, Backwell House. The house is\nsituated nine miles from Bristol and stands 700 feet above the level of the\nsea. The hill is of mountain limestone. Hitherto the house had only been\nsupplied with rain-water. At about 200 yards from the house there was a\nwell, which had been sunk to the depth of 110 feet, but no supply of water\ncould be obtained. I tried the steel spring round the well, but no action was\nproduced upon it. After trying in different parts some time I came across\na si>ot some 70 yards from the house where the spring turned vigorously. I\ntraced the water some little distance across the lawn to a spot where it was\ndecided to bore a three inch hole. This was done and at 60 feet deep we\nstruck a good supply of water, which rose 10 feet in the bore hole.\nIn the year 1884 I found water by using the steel spring, at Messrs.\nJames and Co.'s brewery, Midsomer Norton ; the depth from the surface to\nthe water was 12 feet ; the stratification was conglomerate stone.\nIn 1886, the water supply of the workhouse at Bourton (Bedminster\nUnion) was very deficient. I pointed out a spot where water could be found,\na well was sunk through the new rod sandstone formation to the depth of\nabout 40 feet, a good and abundant spring of water was struck, the supply\nkept up, and the water is being used to-day. About two years ago a supple\nmentary supply was laid on from the Bristol Water Works Co. main, chiefly\nbecause of the improved sanitary arrangements in the house.\nIn 1890, new oil tanks and stores were erected at Avonmouth. We were\nconsulted respecting the water supply for the engine, boilers, etc. I found\nthem water, and sunk a bore hole to the depth of 68 feet ; the water rose to\nwithin 12 feet of the surface, and was pumped direct from bore hole, but\nafter some time was given up, because the water was brackish, the hole being\nclose to the tidal river.\nIn October, 1890, the Rev. C. O. Miles consulted me respecting a water\nsupply for some 20 cottages and a cottage hospital that has since been built\n\f74 Professor W. F. Barrett. [PART\nlit Almondsbury ; after some time searching I found water, and sunk a well\nto the depth of about 30 feet in the blue lias formation. The water rises to\nwithin 8 feet of the surface ; it is pumped to a brick reservoir on the hill,\nand from this reservoir flows by gravitation to the stand-pipe and houses\nin the locality, and I believe the supply is sufficient for all their require\nments.\nIn 1891 we found water and sank a well at a new house belonging to Miss\nLippingcote in the parish of Over, adjoining Almondsbury ; the well was\n44 ft. deep, the bore hole 50 ft., a very good household supply was obtained,\nand I have no heard it has ever failed. The stratification was an up\nlifted coal shale.\nIn 1891 we opened a new brick-and-tile works at Parson-street, in the\nparish of Bedminster ; the extent of our land is about 6 acres. Knowing\nthat for this class of works and for steam purposes a great quantity of water\nwould be required, which would be a very heavy item of cost if purchased\nfrom the Water Works Co., we decided if water could be found to sink a\nwell. I tried the spring over a Urge portion of the land without any success\nand was on the point of giving it up, when within 6 ft. of our boundary the\nspring turned up, and I knew we were over the water. We sank the well\n30 ft. through red marl, and bored 30 ft. through new red sandstone, when\nwe struck the water at a depth of 60 ft. It rose to within 12 ft. of the sur\nface. The whole of the water that has, and is still being used, for the whole\nof the works, which we approximate at about 5,000 gallons per day, is being\ndrawn from this well, but at the very driest time the water in the well is\nwithin 10 ft. of the surface. ,,,\nW. Mereweather.\nMr. Mereweather, in reply to my enquiries, states that in all the\nabove cases, and in many other trials (some of which he sent me\nsubsequently), he employed a forked twig or steel spring to indicate\nwhere to sink ; he does not pretend to explain why the spring moves,\nbut he has great faith in it.\nNo. 51.\u2014The Rev. C. O. Miles, Vicar of Almondsbury, in reply to\nenquiries writes as follows :\u2014\nVicarage, Almondsbury, May 21st, 1893.\nColonel Master wished to supply water here to many of his cottages,\nand the finding of a supply close at hand was a very important matter.\nWatching, myself, the rod being used, I saw it rise up again and again\nwhen crossing veins of water known to me, but unknown to the operator.\nWhen the watch-spring used for the purpose was discarded, and strong\nforked rods cut from a hedge were used, these broke off short when crossing\nthe veins of water. They were held in such a position, downwards, as to\nprove that the force that impelled them upwards was not naturally exerted\nby the operator ; and when I add that the operator was Mr. Mereweather, of\nBedminster, I have written enough to prove that no fraud on the part of the\noperator is even conceivable. I should add that Mr. Mereweather is quite\nunacquainted with this parish.\nC. O. Miles, Vicar of Almondsbury.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod, 75\nGroup IV.\u2014(\u00ab) Mr. John Mulxins.\nOne of the most remarkable of the records of successful dowsing\nthat I have obtained is the next series, where the dowser is the late\nMr. John Mullins, of Colerne, Chippenham, Wilts, who for 30 years was\nprofessionally engaged all over Great Britain and Ireland in finding\nwater springs by the divining rod. In business he was a well-smker,\nand, if allowed to follow the indication of his rod, agreed I understand,\nThE LATE MR. J. MULLInS.\nto receive no payment for sinking a well if a good supply of water w'ere\nnot obtained. When one remembers the heavy outlay involved in\nmaking a well, often through solid rock to a depth of 70 to 100 feet or\nmore, this agreement is a forcible illustration of the faith Mullins had\nin his divining rod ; a faith that appears justified by its works, for\nMullins had probably sunk more wells than any other man. Mr.\nJohn Mullins, whose portrait is here given, was only 56 when he died\n\f76 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nin May, 1894 ; he was quite an uneducated man. His sons carry on\ntheir father's business. One of them, Mr. H. W. Mullins, seems to\nhave developed the faculty of water finding, as several successful cases\nof his are quoted at the end of this group.\nSome striking instances of Mullins' success were given in Vol. II.\nof the S.P.R. Proceedings. The volume of testimonials which Mr.\nMullins has published is a remarkable collection of evidence on behalf\nof the practical usefulness of dowsing, and also contains an account\nof the manner in which Mullins was found to possess the faculty of\ndowsing. In the lengthy list of those who have employed him to find\nwater, and have been led by actual experience to have faith in the\ndowsing rod, will be found nearly a score of distinguished noblemen,\nmore than a dozen owners of breweries and distilleries, or of paper and\ncloth mills and print works ; town commissioners, and clergymen ; and\nlandlords and their agents by the dozen. To many of these I have\nwritten and obtained corresponding statements to those printed by\nMullins.\nIt is impossible to quote more than a few of these cases, and\nI shall therefore confine myself, as far as possible, to those which\nare of evidential value, that is, where unsuccessful attempts to find\nwater by boring had been made in the neighbourhood prior to the\ndowser's visit.\nNo. 52.\u2014The first case I will quote is a remarkable one, and I\nhave to thank Mr. and Mrs. Christie-Miller for the trouble they have\ntaken in obtaining for me the particulars here given. Mr. Christie-\nMiller writes :\u2014\nBritwell Court, Maidenhead, December 5th, 1891.\nMr. Mullins came to us at Broomfield, Chelmsford, in June this year,\nand marked a number of springs. Two wells have been dug with great\nsuccess. The depth in the first was exactly that indicated (40 feet), the\ndirection of the spring also coincided. In the second case, the depth\nforetold was 50 to 60 feet ; water was reached about 40 feet, the spring\nbeing very strong.\nMr. Mullins' next visit was at Kircassock, Lurgan, Ireland. Out of\n17 springs marked we have so far tested two. The first well coincided\nin depth and quantity with his expectations. The second yielded about\n50 gallons per hour at 40 feet, and is now being bored to 00 feet, the\ndepth foretold.\nW. Christie-Miller.\nIn a subsequent letter Mrs. Christie-Miller tells me that the\nfirst well at Kircassock was 15 feet deep, the depth predicted, and\nsupplies cottages ; the second well supplies the house, garden, and\nstable-yard.\n\fXXXII.] 77\nOn the So-called Divining Bod.\nIn reply to my enquiries Mrs. Christie-Miller writes :\u2014\nBritwell Court, Maidenhead, December 31st, 1896.\nAs my husband is just leaving home, I write in reply to your enquiries.\nOur experience of the divining rod extends over nearly seven years. We\nwere first persuaded to experiment in a place where we had bored some 1,000\nfeet without success. After Mullins left we again sunk on the spot indicated\nby him, which was only a few yards off, and at between 80 and 90 feet in depth,\ncame on a spring which has proved excellent ; yielding over 50 gallons\nper minute. Since then we have successfully sunk both in Essex and\non our Irish estate, Kircassock (near Col. Waring's;, so far without a\nfailure.\nWe are unable to quote an instance of failure with the divining rod,\nand can therefore speak most confidently in favour of water finding by\nthe twig. We have seven wells sunk after marking by Mullins with\nhis rod.\nM. E. Christie-Miller.\nIn reply to my further enquiries Mrs. Christie-Miller writes :\u2014\nBritwell Court, Maidenhead, January 4th, 1897.\nMullins first worked for us in 1889, at Waterford. He was not aware\nof the attempt to find water by the Diamond Boring Co. who guaranteed\nto find it. When the boring failed at 1,000 feet, we were most reluctantly\ninduced to have Mullins. The man marked several places, but said at one\nspot the several springs met, and wo should succeed at between 80 and 90\nfeet. The same company were set to work and found a splendid spring at\nthe spot marked by Mullins, at, I believe, about 84 feet. The supply has\nnever varied or failed. In each instance Mullins' estimate of the yield\nper hour and depth were marvellously accurate. Mullins, after marking\nthe site of well at Waterford, was taken to the abandoned boring, and\nsaid even at 2,000 feet we should fail.- One of our Essex neighbours\nwho had sunk in vain repeatedly had Mullins with marked success, after\nhe had been with us.\nM. E. Christie-Miller.\nMrs. Christie-Miller kindly writes again in reply to my wish for\nexact measurements :\u2014\nJanuary 8th, 1897.\nAs regards the Essex well, the measurement of 40 feet 6 inches I know\nto be exact.\nIn reply to my enquiries I received the enclosed answers to my\nquestions about the wells at Waterford ; they are written by a gentle\nman on the spot who was a strong disbeliever in the divining rod, and\nopposed Mullins being brought. He walked with him over the ground\nand had the man guarded so that no one should give him a hint of the\nexisting bore.\nThese figures you can use, and depend on their accuracy. I do not think\nyou can find a stronger case.\nM. E. Christie-Miller.\n\f7s [part\nProfessor W. F.

It seemed advisable, there\nfore, in this case to make a careful study of all the facts : this was\ndone, and the details are given on a subsequent page, under the heading\nof \" The Waterford Experiments.\"\nNo. 53.\u2014Through the kindness of my friend, the Rev. Maxwell\nClose, M.A., of Dublin, I received the following account from Colonel\nWaring, M.P., of some of Mullins' operations in Ireland :\u2014\nWaringstown, co. Down, November 5th, 1891.\nMullins was employed by my neighbour, Mr. Christie-Miller, at Kir-\ncassock, and I was asked to see him at work there. He then volunteered to\ncome to Waringstown, an;l did so the next day. He first walked across the\ngravel on the garden side of the house, and detected the source of the cellar\nwell, at once saying it was a small and shallow spring, which is so. He then\nwent into the yard and tried for a deep well there, and told us that it was\nsunk 12 feet to the eastward of the proper line, and that an abundant supply\nwould be got by boring a tunnel from the bottom of our present well hori\nzontally that distance. He then went over the fields and marked several\nplaces where water was to be found, some of which were known to me as\nsuch (but not to him or to anyone else present). He found a covered-up well\nin an adjoining tenant's farm ; the tenant, however, a young man, said the\nwell was situated 12 or 15 yards from where Mullins said it was. But when\nthe \" oldest inhabitant \" was summoned, Mullins proved to be right and the\ntenant wrong.\nThe gold-finding was not done by him here, but at Mr. James Bruce's.\nMrs. Bruce hid hnlf-a-sovereign in the gravel of a walk and sent Mullins to\nfind it. She said to her husband : \" He has passed the place \" ; a few steps\nfurther Mullins stopped and the gold was there, and not where Mrs. Bruce\nhad fancied she put it.\nHarwood, my gardener, can turn the twig for water nearly as well as\nMullins There is no trick ; firstly, I watched Mullins closely ;\nsecondly, Harwood is incapable of deceit, and, lastly the twig turned in my\n\fXXXII.] 70\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nown hands when Mullins grasped me by the wrists. Mullins cannot do it if\nplaced on a stand insulated by four inverted tumblers or glass bottles ; his\nfeet must touch the ground.\nMr. Christie-Miller has sunk wells here, at Waterford, and in Essex, at\nMullins' direction and never failed to find water at the depth and in the\nvolume promised. Thos_ Wariko_\nIn a subsequent letter Colonel Waring writes :\u2014\nWaringstown, co. Down, November\\11th, 1891.\nI send you herewith two of the \"Dowsing\" or divining rods, for dis\ncovering water or minerals ; a fresh cut one (Fig. 1) and one after being used\nby Mullins (Fig. 2).i The portion nearly twisted offthe end of it (C, Fig. 2),\ni The cuts are drawn from photographs of the twigs sent me by Col. Waring. In\nFig. 2 (the one actually used by Mullins), the end was nearly twisted off, only a shred\nof bark remaining at C. The twigs are of pliable green wood, about 15 inches in\nextreme length, three-sixteenths of an inch diameter at A and B, and a quarter of\nan inch diameter (not quite as thick as a cedar pencil) at the junction.\n\f80 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nwill show the action ; it was done while I was looking on, and no move\nment of the hand was made to occasion the twisting. In fact, if you hold\nthe rod, or rather fork, as directed, such action, whether voluntary or the\nreverse, on the part of the operator is impossible. You pass the ends of the\nfork between the second and third fingers of the hand, palm upwards, and\nclose the thumb and first and second fingers tightly on the points of the fork\n(A and B, Fig. 1) and hold it, apex downwards, out before you ; when you come\non the spring the apex of the fork bends forward and upward, and if one\nend be held tight and the other allowed to revolve it will twist itself nearly\n(or quite) off, as in the specimen (Fig. 2.) The violence of the action,\nMullins says, depends on the volume and proximity of the running water.\nThos. Waring.\nI enquired from my colleague, Prof. Cole, F.G.S., what chance there\nwas, (geologically speaking) of finding water at Col. Waring's ; Prof.\nCole replies :\u2014\nWaringstown, 3 m. S.E. of Lurgan, Co. Down.\nDepends entirely on exact spot of boring. In town and West, Ordovician\nrocks, and no chance. Immediately East of town, admirable chances,\nthrough Triassic Sandstone,\u2014the farther E. for a mile or so, the better.\nWhereupon I wrote to Col. Waring to know the exact position\nthat Mullins had fixed on. Col. Waring replies :\u2014\nAll the places at which Mullins said water would be found are West of\nthe village, as it is on that side my demesne is situated, but I have not as yet\nsunk for water.\nI trust, therefore, Col. Waring will, from the scientific interest of\nthe question, if for no other reason, make the horizontal tunnel, 12\nfeet long, recommended by Mullins, and note the result.\nWith regard to the insulation on glass tumblers stopping the motion\nof the twig, the same result was found by Col. Waring's gardener (see\nNo. 5). It seemed desirable, therefore, to make a decisive experiment\nto test this electrical belief held by nearly every dowser. Through\nCol. Waring's kindness I was enabled to do so, and paid a visit to his\nbeautiful estate for this purpose. The result I have given in the\ntheoretical discussion towards the end of this paper ; suffice it to say\nthat, as might be expected, the inhibitory effect is not due to insulation,\nbut entirely to the preconceived idea on the part of the dowser.\nNo. 54.\u2014In Notes and Queries for October 24th, 1896 (8th series,\nVol. X., p. 345), occurs the following evidence from Mr. Leeson\nPrince, F.R.A.S.\nThe Observatory, Crowborough Hill, Sussex.\nThe Divining Rod.\u2014I must confess that I have been converted to belief\nin the power of the divining rod, and for the following reasons. Some eight\nor nine years since a stranger called upon me respecting a contemplated local\n\fxxxi I.] On the So-called Divining Rod. HI\nimprovement, and upon leaving me he said that he was a person who made\nuse of the divining rod to find water. I took him into my garden and asked\nhim to point out where water would be found. After wandering about over\nnearly an acre of ground, he came to a spot which he said would be\nsuccessful. He then left me, and I thought no more of it. About three\nyears since, a lady bought this property of me, and, having a large establish\nment, she was rather apprehensive of not finding a sufficient water supply.\nI pointed out to her the spot where it had been stated to me that water\nwould be found. She did not, however, pay much attention to this, and dug\nfor water in another part of the property ; but she was not successful.\nWithout having any further conversation with me, she sent for a \"diviner,\"\nwho, after walking about in various directions (and without her having\nmentioned to him what the other person had said), told her that she would\nfind abundance of water if she dug down at a certain place which was within\na yard of the same spot which the former person had pointed out. She\naccordingly acted upon his information, and at a depth of rather less than\ntwenty feet she found an ample supply. When the lady saw the twig point\ndownwards in the man's hand, she expressed a wish to try if it would act in\nthe same way in her hand ^ which, of course, it did not. He then told her\nthat if he put his hand upon hers it would, which it accordingly did. I may\nsay that I report this case from personal information of the facts. Only a\nfew weeks since I heard of another successful case, in an adjoining parish,\nprecisely similar to the above in every particular.\nC. Leeson Prince.\nI wrote to Mr. Prince for further information and he replies as\nfollows :\u2014\nThe Observatory, Crowborough Hill, Sussex,\nOctober 26th, 1896.\nThe lady I mentioned is Mrs. Gresson, and her property lies between\nmy observatory and Dr. Roberts', F.R.S. The dowser who came to her\nwas J. Mullins, from Colerne, who, I believe, is now dead.\nC. Leeson Prince.\nNo. 55. \u2014The following is taken from The Garden of April 11th,\n1885. The writer is Mr. Crump, of Madresfield Court, Malvern :\u2014\nMany successes in finding water on Earl Beauchamp's estates could be\nnamed ; in fact, not a single failure is known. Amongst the most recent\nconsultations with Mullins was one concerning a well that had been sunk\n116 feet without finding water. Mullins selected a spot a few yards distant,\nwhere, at a depth of 50 feet, an inexhaustible supply was found by him.\nHe again selected a spot, naming water at 30 feet deep, and it was found at\n27 feet. Many other instances could be mentioned, and so certain is he of\nhis power that he offers to dig the wells without charge if proved wrong in\nhis judgment.\nMullins was engaged to find some water on an estate at Madresfield last\nweek, and on the day before his visit we prepared for him a series of severe\ntests. No. 1 was to send him into a field which he had never seen before,\nin which a six-inch socket glazed pipe drain conveyed a stream of water to\nO\n\f82 [PART\nProfessor W. F.

All being in readiness,\nMullins commenced to cast about with his twig, when, to every one's\nastonishment, the moment he came upon, or over the water, up went the\ntwig to the perpendicular. He further proved the exact subterranean\nposition of the drain again and again. No. 2 test was similar to the last,\nbut the pipes in this case were of iron rather deeper. Nevertheless the\nresult was equally satisfactory ; of course every member of the party tried\nto use the rod, but amongst them only one young lady had any influence\nover it.\nMadresfiekl Court is the property of Earl Beauchamp, and Mr.\nCrump is the head gardener.

Mr. Munn and myself prepared the test, unknown to Mullins,\nwho, in fact, was unaware he was being tested. The first test was to send\nhim across a part of\"the pleasure grounds, where we know lay six inch glazed\nearthenware pipes, conveying [running] water. As these pipes did not lie in\nthe direction that a person would expect, judging from the surface, the test\nwas a fairly \" dodgey \" one ; but the moment Mullins' twig readied the\npoint where the pipes lay, up went the twig, and Mullins there and then\nsaid what was quite true, and pointed out, with the help of the little twig\n(previously cut from the nearest bush), the exact course of the water. He\nalso was tried over other (iron and lead) pipes, very deep in the ground, all\nwith the same result. He told us also of springs of water in various parts of\nthe fields that he tried for us, but we couldn't prove this.\nMullins was such an unassuming man, and was most willing and\ncommunicative to all. Ho showed us how glass insulated him i\nW. Crump.\n' Mr. Crump then describes how the twig would not move when Mullins was\ninsulated, which, as already explained, is merely due, in all probability, to the\ninfluence of a preconceived idea.\u2014W. F. B.\n\fXXXII.] On the So-called Divining Rod.\nI wrote to the Rev. G. S. Munn, and he lrindly replied as follows :\u2014\nMadresfield Rectory, Malvern, February 24th, 1897.\nIn reply to queries respecting Mullins and water-finding, I may say that\nI was told off to test Mullins on his first visit to Madresfield. Snow was on\nthe ground two or three inches deep, entirely obliterating all external\nindications of water. Knowing the locality well, I took him alone in a line\nacross two places beneath which water ran. One of these had been laid down\nso many years before that I believe it was known only to myself. In both\ncases the rod turned up exactly on the spot. I won't trouble [you] with other\ninstances where, as in the above, all collusion and deception was quite\nimpossible, except to say that on one of Lord Beauchamp's farms, which had\nbeen very short of water for many years, after much searching, he indicated\na spot where water would be found at, so far as I remember, from 20 to 30\nfeet below the surface. A well was sunk through the rock ; the water was\nfound, and I believe there has been an ample supply since.\nOn the last occasion Mullins was here, a considerable number of persons\ncame to see his performances ; many tried to see if they had the power.\nWhen all had failed, I persuaded one of my daughters to take the rod, and to\nmy great surprise, it acted in her hands as well as in Mullins'. She has used\nher power on some few occasions to find water for friends, and also to\nconvince those who have doubted the possibility\u2014as I did, entirely, before I\nwas convinced.\nIf you saw the rod act when in the hands of those who have the power,\nyou would see at once that no possible action of the hands could produce the\nresults. I shall be happy to answer any further questions ; or, if you should\nbe in these parts, you can see for yourself.

R. Bruce (one of the\nMasters in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice\nin Ireland), for.a record of a similar experiment he also tried with\nMullfns.-' Master Bruce writes to me its follows:\u2014\n. i.i i t >I v ' Rockford, Blackrock, Co. Dublin, May 6th, 1897.\nI engaged Mullins to come hero for a day on his way back from my\nbrother's, where I had seen him try for water. To' test his powers I took\nhim'into my yard, across which a small pipe ran underground, supplying the\nhousewith water from the main. Before doing this I turned the cock and\nstopped 'the flow of' water. \" Mullins passed the pipe and the rod gave no\nsign. 'While 'he \"and the persons about htm were engaged in this, I went\ninto the house unobserved, and having turned on the cock suggested his\nagain making a circuit of tire yard. He did so, and when he crossed the\npipe, the rodJ turned Up, the water then not being stagnant, but flowing\nthrough the pipe. \u2022 There were certainly no signs in the yard to show that a\npipe had been -laid \"under the ground, and I am convinced there was no\naudible-sound of running water, and nothing in my action to give Mullins\nany hint on the aubject.\nG 2\n\f84 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nI put him to another test ; he said that gold had the same effect as water.\nWhile he was in the house getting his dinner, I went out and hid half-a-\nsovereign in the ground on the marked line of a tennis ground. I am\ncertain no one saw me do this. I then took him out and told him to try and\nfind the coin, which was some place under the line. He did find the coin.\nI am certain that nothing in my face or manner gave him any indication of\nwhere it was, and it was absolutely impossible for any one to have discovered\nit by eyesight. In fact, I had some difficulty in finding the exact spot\nmyself. I should add that in going round the tennis ground the divining\nrod turned up two or three times before Mullins arrived at the spot over the\ncoin. This he accounted for by saying there was water there, which is quite\ncomprehensible. ,., \u201e ,\u201e\nv Wm. R. Bruce.\nNo. 57.\u2014Master Bruce having told me his brother, who lived in\nGloucestershire, had found difficulty in obtaining a water supply until\nhe employed Mullins, I wrote for particulars, and obtained the\nfollowing interesting evidence :\u2014\nNorton Hall, Campden, Glo'stershire, April 23rd, 1897.\nWith reference to Mullins, it is about 12 years since he came here. I\nbelieve he had never been here or in the neighbourhood before. We sunk at\nthree places pointed out by him, and got water at each of them. The\nsub-soil here is blue lias clay, and goes down a great depth. A friend of\nmine, who bored near here five or six years ago got down over 1,200 feet\nbefore he got through the clay ; this clay is quite impervious to water, the\nneighbouring hills are oolite brash.\nThis house is built on a levelled or terraced slope. When Mullins first\ngot to work at the hall door, before he had gone 10 yards he stopped and\nsaid there was water there, but it was not a convenient place to sink, so we\nwent on. It was some time before he got to another place, which was in the\nstable yard ; there he said we would find water at about 30 feet. When we\ncame to sink, we got to water at about the depth he said, which rose at the\nrate of about 6 feet a day (that is, 24 hours) till we had about 20 feet in the\nwell of about 3 feet diameter. We then tried another place he pointed out,\nwith a similar result. Then the men who were sinking for me, local men,\nsaid that any one would know how to find water there, that there was water\nanywhere along the bank, meaning the slope on which the house stands. I\ntold them to go and pick a place and try. After some discussion, they sank\nclose to my lodge ; when they had got 30 feet down they had not got water,\nand they said there was no use going further, as they were then down into\nthe blue clay ; at the end of a week there were not 6 inches of water in\nthat well.\nWe then tried another place that Mullins had marked close to the house,\nand about 20 yards from the place where he first stopped by the hall door.\nMullins had told us we would find a very strong spring here, about 20 feet\ndown. When we got about 12 feet down, we got signs of water, and when\nwe got 17 feet the water came so fast the men could not sink any further ; it\nwas a case of getting out three buckets of water to one of clay.\n\fXXXII.] 85\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nThe men that were sinking had up to now rather scoffed at Mullins'\ntheories, but now the head man said, \" This man must know something more\nthan we do after all, for this water is coming through a vein of gravel not\nbigger than my hat, and if we had been three feet one side or other of it we\nwould not have got a drop ; \" these men were well sinkers by trade. This\nwell did not hold out when we got a long spell of dry weather, and I always\nthink that there is an underground connection between it and the well in the\nstable yard, and also with another one in the house yard, and this well being\nthe shallowest of the three gives out ; probably the vein of gravel runs on\nand connects with the others. Once, in a very dry time,\u20141887, I think,\u2014it\nwas the well in the stable yard failed, and we had a lot of water from a pond\ntilled into it ; we found that the well in the hoitse yard rose as we filled into\nthe one in the stable yard, and the water was dirty like pond water. I don't\nthink I can give you any more information on the matter.\nMullins also found a half-sovereign that I had buried in a walk we were\nthen making. I would have lost the half-sovereign if it had not been for\nhim, as I was so careful not to put any mark lest he might notice that I was\nnot able to find the place myself, and when he stopped and said it was under\nhis foot, 1 thought he was wrong, but there it was ! g Bruce\nIn reply to my enquiries Mr. Bruce writes :\u2014\nNorton Hall, Campden, Glo'stershire, April 29th, 1897.\nYes, certainly, this neighbourhood is very badly watered, and springs\nfew and far between, at least those that are known to exist. As I mentioned,\nwe are on the blue lias clay, and in one case this was found to go to a depth\nof over 1,200 feet. I have not the exact figures of the boring, but I think\nit was 1,250 feet of clay, and then they went on over 100 feet more and got\nno water that they could utilise. S gruCE\nThe finding of the half-sovereign in both these cases, as elsewhere,\nmust be considered in connection with the specific experiments made\nin this direction, to be related later on. Though the foregoing are\ncertainly striking successes, I see no reason to doubt the explanation\nalready given, which is discussed more fully on a subsequent page.\nNo. 58.\u2014The next case is quite as remarkable as Mr. Christie-\nMiller's experience. Here also the best advice was obtained and some\n\u00a31,000 spent fruitlessly searching for an underground spring prior to\nthe dowser's visit. The first notice of this case appeared in a local\nnewspaper, the West Sussex Times and Sussex Standard, from which the\nfollowing letter is reprinted : \u2014\nWarnham Lodge, Horsham, January 3rd, 1893.\nHaving had very great difficulty in the supply of water to this house, I\nsent for John Mullins, of Colerne, near Chippenham, who, by the aid of a\ntwig of hazel, pointed out several places where water could be found. I\nhave sunk wells in four of the places, and in each case have been moat\nsuccessful.\n\f86 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nIt may be said that water can be found anywhere \u2014this is not my ex\nperience. I have had the best engineering advice and have spent many\nhundreds of pounds, and hitherto have not obtained sufficient water for my\nrequirements, but now I have an abundant supply.\n1 certainly should not think of sinking another well without previously\nconsultmg John Mullins. Hkney Hakben.\nFurther details of this case are given later under the head of\nThe Horsham Experiments.\nNo. 59.\u2014Having heard from Mr. Harben that a neighbour of his\nat Horsham had sunk two wells with very poor results, but that an\nabundant supply had been obtained at a spot indicated by Mullins, I\nwrote for particulars, and received the following letter from the owner\nof the estate in question : \u2014\nHedgecocks, near Horsham, Sussex, May 3rd, 1897.\nThere were two wells previously, but only land springs, about 27 feet\ndeep, and apt to get dry. I then employed Mullins, and sank a well at a\nplace where he said I should find water. The result was I found a good\nsupply at about 26 feet. The water was found within 6 inches of where\nMullins divined it.\nI have employed him since with equal success with three wells.\nWilliam Renton.\nNo. 60.\u2014The following is from Mr. F. Bastable, 14, Foskelt Road,\nFulham, and appeared in the Carpenter and Builder, of September 30th,\n1892. The contractor of the Somerset and Dorset Railway, Mr. T. A.\nWalker, here employed Mullins under the following circumstances :\u2014\nAt the Shepton Mallet Station, on that line, it was decided to sink a well\nclose to the rails to supply water for the locomotives. We had sunk a depth\nof 250 feet entirely through blue lias rock as dense and hard as possible, and\nas dry ns a bone, and began to look upon it as a forlorn hope, when Mr.\nMullins was mentioned as a man likely to help us in the matter. After\nmuch hesitation and fear lest it should turn out to be a hoax\u2014we were very\nincredulous\u2014it was decided to ask the advice of Mr. Mullins, who came at\nonce, and with very little trouble discovered for us close at hand that for\nwhich we had sought so long. . . . The most favourable spot was found\nto be about 50 feet from our well. Mr. Mullins, from his observations of\nthe action of the forked twig, advised us to commence and drive a heading\nabout 50 feet down the well, and under [where the twig turned] we should\nhave abundance. This was done, and when at that spot our miners had to\nrush out and up for their lives, leaving behind them their steel drills,\nhammers, clothes, etc. The well soon filled up, and when we left in 1879\nthe water was within 12 feet of the surface. _\nWe procured two pairs of smith's tongs to see if the twigs did actually\ntwist, and held them in a tight grip, with one pair securing the tips and the\n\fXXXII.] 87\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nother the fork, but the contortions still went on between the points held.\nWhat the power consists of I am still at a loss to conceive ; but this I know,\nnot one of us present at the operation had any doubts afterwards as to his\nability in discovering water in the earth.\nIn a letter to the Daily Graphic for March 30th, 1892, Mr. T. J.\nHickes, of Truro, describes this same case. He writes from a personal\nknowledge of the facts, but both he and Mr. Bastable appear to write\nfrom memory, and it is, therefore, not surprising that the figures they\ngive do not quite correspond. Mr. Hickes remarks that the water was\nfound exactly at the spot Mullins predicted and came with such force\nthat the well sinkers had to fly and leave everything. Mr. Hickes adds,\n\" I have used the divining rod on many occasions myself to find and\ntrace springs and thus been able to be of benefit to others.\"\nMr. F. J. Clark, F.L.S., who lives in Somerset, and kindly sent me\none or two cases in Group 1, writes to say he is well acquainted with\nthe foregoing facts, which came to his knowledge at the time they\noccurred, his father being then a director of the line. Mr. Clark\nadds :\u2014,\nI went to see my father on receipt of your letter, and he tells me that the\naccount you have printed [as above] is correct, though his impression is that\nthe well was not quite so deep.i My father proposed their having a dowser\nfrom the first, but the contractor laughed at the idea ; however, afterwards\nhe was very sorry he had not taken my father's advice at the beginning.\nNo. 61.\u2014I have to thank Mr. Clifford Gibbons for the following\ninteresting case :\u2014\nGreat Walstead, Lindfield, Haywards Heath,\nJanuary 7th, 1897.\nIn reply to your letter, I have much pleasure in giving you particulars of\nthe success of Mr. Mullins in finding water on my estate.\nThree old welis, 20 feet apart, sunk without the dowsing rod, are 50 feet\ndeep and communicate with each other by means of a tunnel. About 150\nyards to the west of these, and at the spot indicated by Mr. Mullins, a large\nsupply of water was found at a depth of 30 feet, and with much difficulty the\nwell was sunk another 15 feet. There are two wells both about 50 feet from\nthe above, one being to the north- and the other to the south-east ; the\nlatter is a very old farm well. When these two wells are dry, as they wore\nlast season, Mr. Mullins' well stood at 12 feet of water, ami at least 1,000\ngallons a day were pumped out. The three wells first mentioned were\npumped once or twice a week, but gave only a little water.\nThe most remarkable thing to me is, that when Mr. Mullins was survey\ning the ground with his rod, I tried it myself without any result, but on\ngoing over it again with my wrists held by him the twig rose in my hands in\nthe same manner as it had done in his.\ni On further enquiry, Mr. Clark informs me the depth was 100 feet.\n\f88 [PAUT\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nThe thing is altogether a mystery to me, but certainly if I were to sink\nanother well, 1 should get Mr. Mullins to select the snot, as I have (pent\nvery large sums of money almost fruitlessly before 1 knew him.\nAny further particulars you may desire, I shall be pleased to give you.\nS. Clifford Gibbons.\nWriting again to Mr. Clifford Gibbons, I asked him to give me the\nexact depth, distance apart, and relative level and position of the wells.\nMr. Gibbons replied as follows :\u2014\nGreat Walstead, Lindfield, January 20th, 1897.\nThe accompanying rough sketch plan shows the relative position of the\nsix wells on my estate at Lindfield.\nNoitth.\n05\nWest.

No. 6 well is the one made by Mullins.\nIt was commenced in October, 1893 ; abundant water was found at 30 feet\ndeep, but it was sunk to 45 feet.\nNos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, were almost dry in September and October last,\nbut No. 6 well stood with about 12 to 16 feet of water in it, and supplied all\nthe water that was required. s Clifford Gibbons.\nThis remarkable case would be still more instructive if Mr. Clifford\nGibbons would sink either No. 4 or 5 well two or three feet lower, and\nsee if the supply found in No. 6 would be reached. I wrote to ask\nMr. Gibbons if this could be done as a matter of scientific interest, but\nhe replies it is impossible at present, \"as it might disturb all the\npumping arrangements I have, which are most satisfactory, and the\nsupply of water excellent from Mullins' well.\"\nNo. 62.\u2014The next is from Mr. E. G. Allen.\nHighfield, Metheringham, Lincoln, March 2Uh, 1893.\nHaving frequently availed myself of Mr. John Mullins' services during\nthe last 20 years, I can say I have never known him to fail. I have sunk six\nwells, two on a heath farm about 30 feet deep (surrounding wells measuring\n\fXXXII.] 89\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nabout 70 feet) in limestone rock, thus saving a great expense in sinking. I\ntook him one morning to a farm which was at that time fanned by the\nowner, the Right Hon. H. Chaplin, M.P. The well in the yard (nearly\nalways dry) was about 30 feet deep, and water had to be led some distance\nfrom the Carr Dyke. In a few minutes, Mullins, carrying in his hand his\ntwig, found a good spring a very short distance from the old well. A new\nwell was sunk, and at 10 feet a splendid supply of water was found. It has\nnever failed, and has supplied the yards, etc., with water ever since.\nBeing in want of water for a large grass field, called \"Catley Abbey\nField,\" I went with Mullins, who placed down a peg to denote a spring. We\nsank a well, and bored 70 feet, obtaining a good supply of water. Being\nstruck with a peculiarity in the taste, it was submitted to Professor Attfield,\nPh.D., who pronounced it to be the only natural seltzer spring in the kingdom.\nE. G. Allen.\nNo. 63.\u2014There is an interesting sequel to this case. The Lincolnshire\nChronicle of June 8th, 1895, contains a long report of a visit of Mr.\nH. W. Mullins, the son of John Mullins, to Catley Abbey. The\nnewspaper report, which I have abridged, is as follows :\u2014\nThe object of the Catley Abbey Company in sending for Mr. Mullins was\nto secure a well of pure water for bottle washing. A well on the adjoining\nfarm of Mr. Allen had run dry, and recently the seltzer water had been\nused for the purpose of bottle washing. Eight years ago Mr. J. Mullins,\nthe father of the family, located the spot at Catley,where now stands the only\nnatural seltzer spring in Britain, and the Company had ample evidence of\nthe success which had attended the diviner in other directions. Proceeding\nto the site of the dried up well, Mullins took out a V shaped twig, the forks\nof which were each about a foot long, and walked slowly along the ground a\nshort distance from the well. Suddenly the twig revolved, having the apox\nat the top, and Mullins confidently asserted that he was standing over a\nsubterranean water-course. Proceeding to the other side of the well he\ntraced, or professed to trace, the course of the hidden stream, and marked a\nspot contiguous to the buildings, where he asserted a good spring would be\ntapped at a depth of from 120 to 130 feet, and he advised that a well should\nbe sunk there.\nIt was told to Mullins that his father asserted the seltzer spring flowed\nunder a hedge on the other side of the field, in which we were then standing,\nand he was asked to indicate the place. Starting at one end of the field he\nwalked close by the hedge side. He had gone about 100 yards when the\ntwig began to play, and digging his heel in the ground, he thus marked the\nspot. Mr. Allen, who was present when Mullins, senr., also located the\nspring, sent a man for a spade, and a stake was dug up, which eight years\nago was driven in by Mr. Allen to mark the place. Mullins, junr., had\ntouched the spot exactly.\nThe same newspaper of August 23rd, 1895, announces the result\nof digging in the spot indicated as follows :\u2014\nOur readers will remember that a few weeks ago our columns contained\nan article relative to the finding of water at Catley Abbey by means of hazel\n\f90 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ntwigs in the hands of Mr. Mullins, the eminent \"dowser.\" We are now\nable to state that a well having been sunk in the position indicated by Mr.\nMullins, a valuable supply of water has been obtained, and that at a depth\nof about five feet less than mentioned by him.\nI sent Mr. Allen the foregoing account, and asked if it were correct,\nhe replies that \"it is perfectly accurate, the facts being most interesting,\nand occurred as stated in the letter and newspaper report.\"\nNo. 64.\u2014The Bath Chronicle (date missing) gives the following\naccount :\u2014\nCaptain A. K. Barlow, who recently purchased an estate near Braintree,\nEssex, had made several borings for water, but without the desired result,\nand he had reluctantly made up his mind to sell the property and leave the\nneighbourhood ; but, being strongly urged to try the divining rod, he,\nwithout having much faith in the efficacy of the powers of the hazel twig,\nresolved to send for Mr. Mullins. Mullius came, and next morning walked\nup and down a portion of the estate with his hazel twig before him, and\neventually marked a spot about 250 yards from an empty well. Mullins\nremarked that this spot was the very best place to sink a well, and if it was\nbored 50 feet a capital supply of water would be found. Captain Barlow set\nmen on to dig a well at the place marked, and they have, at a distance of 34\nfeet from the surface, dug right into a fine body of water in a gravelly soil.\nI wrote to Captain Barlow for confirmation of the above state\nments, which I enclosed, and he replies :\u2014\nWivenhoe Hall, Essex, February 24th, 1897.\nI can only say that the report, as printed, is perfectly true and accurate.\n1 have since sold Lynden Wood. The supply of water there is unfailing and\nconstant. Lynden Wood also stands on the top of one of the highest points\nof land ill this county. 1 remember noticing that Mullins had hard\ncallosities on his hands just where the hazel twigs fitted between his fingers,\nand seemed to be in a very highly nervous state when operating with the twigs.\nAlexander Barlow.\nNo. 65.\u2014The following letter from Mr. W. D. Little, estate\nagent to the Earl of Jersey, is addressed to Mr. J. Mullius : -\nEstate Office, Middleton Park, Bicester, Oxon,\nAugust 20th, 1890.\nIn reply to your letter of inquiry, I have much pleasure in informing\nyou that since August, 1884, I have had upwards of 25 wells dug on sites\nwhere you had found springs by means of the dowsing rod, and in every\ninstance an abundant and unfailing supply of water has been obtained.\nThese wells have been sunk on the estates of the Earl of Jersey in the\ncounties of Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, and Middlesex, and on the Charter\nhouse Estate in Wiltshire. I send you a copy of a letter which appeared\nin Farm and Home in 1885.\nW. D. Little.\n\fXXXII.] 91\n0)1 the So-called Divining Rod.\nThe following is the letter Mr. Little addressed to the journal he\nnames :\u2014\nAs it may, perhaps, interest some of the readers of Farm and Home,\nI venture to send a statement of the practical results of seven wells sunk\nduring the autumn of 1884 on the Earl of Jersey's estate at Middleton\nPark, near Bicester, Oxon, on sites located by John Mullins, of Colerne,\nChippenham, Wilts, by means of the dowsing rod. I may preface the\nfollowing statement by saying that the unprecedented drought of last year\nwas most severely felt in Oxfordshire, and water had to be carted a consider\nable distance at great expense for several months, for all descriptions of\nstock. Mullins' search for water was made during the last week in August,\n1884, and the smking of the wells was proceeded with as soon after as\npossible.\nNo. 1 was sunk 22 yards from a well sunk in 1879, which had proved to\nbe useless even for supplying two cottages only. At a depth of 18 feet an\nabundant supply of water was obtained on the spot selected by Mullins.\nNo. 2 was also sunk to substitute a well made in 1879, which, although in a\nposition likely to yield plenty of water, had turned out useless. At a\ndistance of 60 yards from the old well, the new well, sunk on a site selected\nby Mullins at a depth of 12 feet G inches, yielded more water than two\nordinary portable pumps would keep down, the continued drought not\nseeming to affect it in any way. No. 3 was a well that had gone dry, and\nwas deepened on the strength of Mullins' recommendation with a satis\nfactory result. No. 4, a well sunk to supply the mansion with drinking\nwater ; it is 49 feet deep, and has an excellent spring with the water\nstanding about 25 feet deep in the well, the diameter of which is of large\nsize. It is proposed to further iucrease the inflow of water by boring at\nsome later period. No. 5 sunk to supply two cottages. Although situate\nin a district proverbially dry and badly off for water, a good supply was\nfound at a depth of 30 feet. No. 6\u2014this is perhaps the most remarkable\nwell of the seven alluded to in this notice. At a depth of 13 feet 6 inches\na spring (whose existence was not even suspected) was found that has been\nproved, after being tested by steam pumps for several days, to yield between\n20,000 and 30,000 gallons of water per diem ; and this after an abnormally\nlow rainfall during the year.

F. Barrett.\nhad been without any water for months, with the exception of one pond fed\nby a gravel spring.\n(I) Mullins commenced at Park farm, situated on the clay, with gravel\none field distant ; he marked two spots where his stick indicated water : 1,\nnear the house (clay), 2, near the pond before mentioned ; result, water\nfound near the pond at No. 2, but no water in bore of 30 feet at No. 1. The\nhouse is vacant, and having found water in one place I did not persevere\nat No. 1.\n(II) Baker's farm\u2014no water all summer, two places marked ; water in both\nat bore hole about the depth indicated, well thereupon sunk ; result,\nexcellent supply.

Franklin Bros., the well-\nknown land agents, to find water at Charndon, Bucks, on the estate of\nMr. Wykeham Musgrave, and has been there eminently successful. You\nask me to mention failures and I am only in a position to quote one in this\nneighbourhood, i.e., at Colonel Miller's on the top of Shotover Hill, where\nthey are said to have gone to considerable expense without finding water,\nbut it is only fair to Mullins to suggest that the depth of search was\ninsufficient.\nI was a disbeliever before seeing the experiment on my estate, but the\nevidence of my own eyes convinced me of its practical utility.\nI tested Mullins by taking him over springs of which I alone was aware,\nand to other spots where I knew no springs existed, and he was in both\ninstances correct.\nJ.

He said we should find a strong spring from 35 to 45 feet down, but\nif we failed at that depth we were to go on ; he then took his fee and\ndeparted. We sunk to a depth of 45 feet and began to despair and doubt\n\fXXXII.] 93\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nMr. Mullins' powers extremely.

Hayward, had no\nwater supply, except the runnings from the roofs. The buildings stand on\nthe summit of the rolling Cotswold district, the ground level being on a level\nwith Cirencester church tower, and 144 feet above the road from Cirencester\nto Cheltenham. Mullins undertook to sink a well, the depth he estimated\nas necessary being from 70 to 80 feet ; whereas owners of house property in\nthe vicinity situated on much lower levels have sunk from 120 to 150 feet,\nand then often failed to keep a supply of water in dry weather. By the\nterms of the contract, Mullins is to receive a certain stated sum on finding a\nsupply of water, but if he fails he receives no payment whatever. His men\nhave now been at work for seven or eight weeks, and have sunk just over 70\nfeet through the rock without coming to water, but they entertain no anxiety\nas to the result. The termination of the undertaking is being looked forward\nto with interest.\nA subsequent report informs us that the men sunk the well to a\ndepth of 101 feet, when an abundant supply of water was obtained\n\f94 Professor W.

Forder Plowman. In this paper the author gives the evidence\nof his friend, Mr. W. J. Brown, of Middlehill House, Box, Wilts,\na gentleman occupying a high position in the county, and a member\nof the council of several public bodies. Mr. Brown states (p. 415) : \u2014\nI employed Mullins to try for water near Box, the only well near, which\nwas 180 feet deep, being often out of water from September to December\nafter a dry summer. Mullins marked the track of four different springs,\none of which, he said, was rather stronger than the others. I asked him\nhow.deep the best spring was under the surface, and he said about 110 feet.\nI then directed Mullins to search for an old well, which, when I was a lad,\nmy father had discovered in an open quarry at the time the Box tunnel was\nbeing made. Although it had been filled up many years ago and there were\nno outward signs of it, I had an opinion as to where it was and directed\nMullins to try. They worked all day, but came upon no trace of it, and\nthe general opinion was that I was mistaken as to the spot. However, [\nordered them to go on in the same direction next day, and in the afternoon,\nafter working a little more westward, they suddenly came upon the well,\nand, on examining, wo found that the marks Mullins had made in the first\nplace to denote the position of the strongest spring pointed exactly into the\ncentre of the well. [In another communication Mr. Brown says they found\nthe depth of the old well to be TO feet, and that he contracted with Mullins\nto sink it 50 feet deeper.] I then directed him to sink down further for\nwater, and strange to say, at 111 feet, viz., within a foot of the distance ho\nhad stated at first, we found the spring come in, and just where he had\nmarked it. The well now supplies twenty cottages and if, in a very dry\nseason, they draw all the water out by night, there is plenty again the next\nmorning.\nWhilst this work was in progress, some friends and myself arranged to\ntest Mullins' capacity for discovering metal. In his absence we took ten\nstones off the top of a wall, and having placed them on the road, we\ndeposited a sovereign under three of them. Mullins passed his rpd over\nthe top of each stone, and without the slightest hesitation, told us at once\nunder which stones the sovereigns were. When he came to a stone under\nwhich there was no sovereign, he at once said, \" Nothing here, master,\" but\nwhen he got to the others, he remarked, \" All right, master, thankee,\" turned\nthe stone over and put the sovereign in his pocket.\nHe afterwards tried for water on the Cottle's House Estate, the then\nowner, Dr. Parfitt, being very anxious to obtain it, as there was none on the\nostate. Mullins, however, tried in vain, and, having given it up as a bad\njob, was leaving for home, when just as he passed the front of New House\nFarm, with his rod in his hand, it suddenly-indicated the presence of water\n\fXXXII.] 95\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nHe at once said there was a strong spring at a depth of only about 18 feet\nbelow the surface. He sank a well on the spot, and the water was found at\nthe depth he stated. [In another letter Mr. Brown says the depth of the\nwell was 20 feet.] The tenant told me it is capital water, and the supply\nnever runs short. '\nAfter Mullins has indicated water I have blindfolded him and turned\nhim round and round, but whenever after this he crossed the spring up went\nthe rod directly. I conclude by saying I believe in him thoroughly.\nThe author, Mr. Plowman, bears testimony \" to the open and\nstraightforward manner of Mullins, and that he is without any of the\noutward characteristics of the professional charlatan.\" In answer to\nenquiries Mullins stated to Mr. Plowman that whenever .he is dowsing\nand gets over a stream of water he feels a tingling sensation in his\narms like a slight electric shock, and the strength of this sensation\nenables him to guess the approximate volume or depth of a spring.\nSomewhat similar evidence of the success and accuracy of the dowser's\nart was also given to the author of the above paper by Mr. Maiton\nDruce, of Abingdon, by Mr. W. D. Little, estate agent to the Earl of\nJersey, (I have referred to this evidence elsewhere, p. 90), by Mr. W.\nH. Ashhurst, J.P., of Waterstock, by Mr. F. Webster, of the Queen's\nHome Farm at Osborne (whose testimony is endorsed by Mr. A.\nBlake, Her Majesty's Steward) ; Mr. Webster discovered to his\nsurprise that be himself was a good dowser. The author also quotes\nat length the remarkable evidential cases furnished by Sir W. E.\nWelby Gregory, Bart., and by the Hon. M. E. G. Finch-Hatton, now\nthe Earl of Winchilsea and Nottingham. (See Nos. 73 and 74).\nNo. 70.\u2014Another interesting case is given in full by Mr. Fordev\nPlowman, on p. 424, Vol. VI., of the Proceedings of the Bath Field\nClub. It is from Mr. H. D. Skrine, J.P., D.L., of Claverton Manor,\nBath. Mr. Skrine writes : \u2014\nMy first acquaintance with the divining rod w>is in January, 18l>5. I had\nheard that one John Mullins, a well sinker, who lived at Colerne, had the\ngift of finding water by the rod. I sent for him and took him to a field\nadjoining the village of Conkwell, where I had thought of building a cottage\nas a sort of sanatorium for my wife. On the way he tried the divining rod\nseveral times, and I was aware that in a line below the points where the\ntwig turned with him, there was a spring in the wood which came to the\nsurface.. Arrived on the field, the twig turned with him in several places,\nand he sset a mark on the wall opposite the spot.\nA-JeW days after I asked Mr. Earle, Rector of Monkton Farleigh, to\nmeet John Mullins and myself on the field on January 20th, 1865 ; as I had\nheard that.Mr. Earlc had the gift, and had discovered water by it on his\nown land at Monkton Farleigh. He was not aware of the marks on the\nwall, but the twig turned with him at the same places as with Mulline ; they\n\f06 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ndiffered only in the position in the field as to the best place to sink the well,\nboth being in the same line. The well was sunk, and water was found at\nabout 80 feet in yellow clay under the rock, but this not being of sufficient\ndepth and the clay being a thin bed, Mullins went down about 25 feet lower\nand came on a good spring in the blue lias.\nMullins afterwards found some springs near the house and traced them\nup to the spot where, under the croquet lawn, a spring had been found some\nyears before. Since then I have employed him at Claverton, and sunk two\nwells succesfully, and he has again traced several springs which have been\nverified. In two instances where the line of a drain had been lost, he\nrecovered the spot and was always correct. My two sons, who had watched\nthe operation, found they also had the gift. I cannot resist the conclusion\nthat it is a real gift possessed by some persons, and that it may have been a\nnatural provision to enable men to obtain that very necessary element\n(water) when there are no signs above the surface.\nThe following abstracts of cases already published in our Pro\nceedings are added here for the convenience of the reader :\u2014\nNo. 71.\u2014Captain Henry Smith, J. P., of Horbling, Folkingham, Lincoln\nshire, writing on December 26th, 1882, states that his scepticism as to the\npractical value of the indications given by the divining rod, as used by\nMullins, were overcome by what he himself witnessed and describes in full\nin Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 95, etc. Mullins fixed on certain spots\nwhere water would be found, and again indicated the same spots when\nunable to see the previous places. Against Captain Smith's opinion, Mullins\nsaid an abundant supply of water would be found at a particular spot, and\non sinking a well, this was found to be the case. Other evidence is also\ngiven.\nNo. 72. \u2014Mr. G. Hancock, of Corsham, Wilts, writing on January 23rd,\n1883, states he employed Mullins to find the best place for sinking shafts for\nmining operations, so as to avoid the inrush of water, which had previously\nhindered their work. Mr. Hancock says, \" In every case Mullins was\nright.\" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 96).\nNo. 73.\u2014Sir Welby Gregory, Bart., formerly M.P., of Denton Manor,\nGrantham, writing on January 28th, 1883, states he employed Mullins to\nfind water for a new country house he was building. As a test, Sir W.\nGregory first tried whether Mullins could find water on the lawn, through a\ncertain part of which a drain-pipe carried running water ; the exact position\nwas known to Sir W. G., but not to M. ; the twig instantly moved whenever\nM. crossed the drain. After traversing the grounds, Mullins fixed on two\nlines, A and B (about 30 yds. apart), where he said water would be found,\nfrom 20 ft. to 30 ft. deep at A, and from 30 ft. to 40 ft. deep at B, the latter\nthe more copious supply, the former small. A neighbouring hill, which\nMullins thought likely to yield a better supply, was traversed, but no indica\ntions of water were given by the rod. Subsequently Sir W. Gregory\nconsulted an eminent civil engineer, who stated from his geological knowledge\nof the country, that the hill was the best place to bore for water, but that none\n\fXXXII.] 97\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nwould be found at the places indicated in the grounds, A and B, at a less depth\nthan 120 feet to 130 feet. This opinion was confirmed by another geological\nauthority. Sir Welby's gardener having found the rod moved in his hands,\ntried his skill, and fixed on the same spots as Mullins had done ; the rod, held\nby pincers, violently twisted itself over the spots, A and B. Sir Welby\nblindfolded the man, and at the same spots again the rod moved. Hence he\ndecided to sink on both the lines indicated. In one (A), he found water at\n20 feet, and in the other (B), as stated by Mullins, a much larger supply at\n28 feet. Between the two lines Mullins said there was no water. Sir Welby\nsank a shaft midway, and went down 10 to 12 feet deeper than the deepest\nwell, but found no water, although the formation appeared precisely similar ;\nneither well was affected by this trial shaft. This is a striking case, and is\ngiven in full in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., pp. 97-99.\nIn a speech Sir Welby Gregory made at Grantham (reported in the\nGratttham Journal, September 28th, 1888) ho refers to his experience of the\npractical value of the divining rod and remarks that in future he prefers to\ntrust to the dowser rather than to the geologist in sinking wells.\nNo. 74.\u2014The Hon. M. E. G. Finch-Hatton, then M.P. (now the Earl of\nWinchilsea), writing on February 29th, 1884, from 23, Ennismore Gardens,\nS. W.,describes his own experience with Mullins, at HaverholmePriory, a place\nMullins had no previous acquaintance with. (1) Mullins found and traced\nthe water-supply pipe up to the house, though no indication on the surface\nwas visible, nor had any information been given to Mullins. (2) He found a\nspring on the lawn, the existence of an old well at the very spot being after\nwards proved, though unknown at the time. (3) He was unable to find another\nwater pipe, when the distant tap was nut turned on, but when the water\nwas running he fixed the spot correctly. Mullins was then blindfolded, and\nthough led round by a different route, again fixed on the same spot. \"At\nfirst he slightly overran it a foot or so, and then felt round, as it were, and\nseemed to be led back into the exact centre of influence by the twig. All\npresent considered the trial conclusive of two things : (1) of the man's perfect\ngood faith ; (2) that the effect produced on the twig emanated from an\nagency outside of himself, and appeared due to the presence of running,\nwater.\" (See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 101).\nNo. 75.\u2014Mr. F. T. Mott, F.R.G.S., whom I know personally, writing\nfrom Bristol Hill, Leicester, states that on his estate at Charnwood Forest\nthere was no spring water. The formation was metamorphic slate ; several\nwells had been sunk, and no water found ; in one case the boring went to\n100 feet, but unsuccessfully. Mullins was employed, and by the movement\nof the twig, which Mr. Mott states he could not restrain, though he tried to\ndo so, certain spots were marked. \" Anywhere along that line,\" Mullins\nsaid, \"you will find water if you sink about 30 feet.\" A well was sunk, and\nat 28 feet water was found. On sinking to 31 feet, a constant supply, standing\n1i feet in the well, has been obtained.

Mr. Mullins walked up my yard and when he came\nto the spot marked B on sketch, said, \"there is a very strong spring here,\nflowing in this direction,\" marked 0. I then showed him the well, W, and he\nsaid the amount of water we got from it was not as large as the spring he\nfound at B. He advised me to sink lower, when I should probably top the\nspring which, according to him, ran in the direction of the wells. I asked\nhow many gallons per hour did he think I should find ; he said from 1,000 to\n1,500. I did nothing to the well until three months ago, when I sank three\nfeet lower in the well and tunnelled four feet in the direction of the supposed\nspring, when one day the men heard a rumble and a large amount of water\nbroke in and rapidly rose in the well.

In answer to my enquiries Mr. Bayley\nwrites :\u2014\nArnold's, Holmwood, Surrey, December 29th, 1896.\nIn reply to your communication of the 26th inst., I beg to inform you\nwhen I bought this property 10 years ago there was an old well about 60\nfeet deep on the premises which was said to have a good supply of water,\nbut when I came to put it to the test I found it quite inadequate for the\nwants of my house, so consulted Messrs. Isler and Co. as to the best means\nof increasing the supply. On their advice I got them to bore through the\nbottom of the old well to a depth of about 100 feet, making in all about 160\nfeet, but found no water. Some time after, seeing an account of the divining\nrod, I sent for Mullins and he said there was water to be had at about 60\nfeet deep on the top of a hill 300 yards from the old well. He dug a well on\nthe site and found water at a depth of 90 feet, and now we have an abundant\nsupply. Holmwood is 28 miles from London and is under the Surrey Hills.\nEdmond K. Bayley.\nNo. 78.\u2014It is sometimes urged that only springs yielding a limited\nsupply of water are found by dowsers, who fix on spots where more or less\nsurface water can be got from shallow wells rather than run the risk\nof sinking a deep well. Many of the cases already cited refute this\nnotion, and the following sent to me in answer to my enquiries bears\non the same point. It is from Messrs. Beamish and Crawford, the\nwell-known brewers of Cork.\nCork Porter Brewery, Cork, December 30th, 1896.\nIn reply to your letter of 26th inst. we beg to state :\u2014\n1. We had an old well yielding a small supply of water. It was about\n30 feet deep.\n2. No new well was fixed on by Mullins. He bored down to a depth of\nabout 60 feet below the bottom of the old well, and therefore about 90 feet\nbelow the surface of the ground.\n3. The supply of water now obtained froivi the new pipes sunk by Mullins\nis, as nearly as we can estimate, about 10,000 gallons per hour.\nBeamish and Crawford, Ltd.\nNo. 79.\u2014The next letter in answer to my enquiries is from the\nRev. H. F. Ramsay, M.A. :\u2014\nBrendon, Lynton, N. Devon, December 30th, 1896.\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th instant, I beg to state that before\ncommencing the building of the new rectory at Oare we sunk a well close to\nthe site of the house to a depth of 28 feet. As hard rock full of fissures was\nthere met with, and there was no sign of water, we decided to discontinue\nthe sinking. It was at this stage that we called in Mullins, who went all\nh % \u2022 -\n\f100 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nover the ground in the usual way holding a hazel twig. He tried about the\nsite and pronounced our well to be absolutely hopeless ; afterwards he tried\nbelow the site and at the lowest spot on the field he pointed out a place where\nwe should get 400 gallons a day at 35 feet deep and a big spring at 70 feet.\nWe soon started to dig and came to a small spring yielding about 200 gallons\nat 26 feet. I find the supply insufficient, so I propose to deepen the well\nsomewhat, as there is not more than three feet of water in it. The new well\nis about 40 yards from the old well.\nI do not pretend to explain Mullins' modus operandi, but it does appear\nto me that he has a marvellous power of finding water underground. To\ntest him we took him to two fields (far apart from each other), and in each\ncase he discovered a hidden covered spring, of the existence of which he\ncould not possibly have been aware beforehand. In the one case the water\nwas drained off by underground drain tiles into the river Badyworthy, and\nin the other the water shows on the surface of the grass only when the\nsprings burst after prolonged heavy rain. tj p rAMSAy\nP.S.\u2014 Perhaps I ought to mention that the house is in the Lynn Valley,\nbut not quite at the bottom of the slope.\nNo. 80. \u2014Mr. F.

At last they determined to avail themselves of the assistance\nof Messrs. J. Mullins and Sons, water-finders, of Oolerne, Chippenham,\nWiltshire. Mr. Henry Mullins (one of the firm) visited the farm, and, by\nthe aid of a twig of hazel, pointed out several places where springs might\nbe found at depths varying from six feet to twenty-five feet. He succeeded\nin finding one six feet deep at a short distance from the farmhouse, and two\nmore a little further off, from eight to ten feet deep, each of which Mr.\nMullins estimated would produce from 300 to 400 gallons of water per day.\u2014\nFrom North Devon Herald, September 27th, 1894, communicated by Mr.\nG.

In a\nsubsequent letter, Captain Hobbs gives me the following details :\u2014\n8, King-street, Manchester, January 7th, 1897.\nI have to-day been able to get all the information about the finding of\nwater on the farm at Burtonwood, near Warrington. The property is owned\nby the executors of the late Wm. Bindloss, and is situated about five miles\nfrom Warrington. Up to the visit of Mr. H. W. Mullins, the farmer had\nused the rain water, filtered.\nOn November 29th, 1895, Mr. H. W. Mullins accompanied me and several\nladies and gentlemen to the place (he had never been in that neighbourhood\nbefore), and after walking over the farmyard, garden, and field near the\nhouse, he fixed on a spot about 50 yards from the house, in the garden, where\nhe said we should find a supply of water sufficient for the use of the house.\nThere a well has been sunk, and a supply of from 60 to 70 gallons\n(probably more, as we have never pumped it out quite dry) an hour was\nfound. The water was first found at 40 feet from the surface, but sinking\nwas continued for 5 feet more (through quicksand). There is now an ample\nsupply at all times in the well.\nIn 1880 a well was sunk about 12 yards from the house ; 48 feet were\nsunk and 18 feet bored (a total of 66 feet), but no water was found. No\nfurther steps were taken since that date until Mullins' visit.\nOn the opposite side of the road from the farm in question, in or about\n1877, three wells were sunk about 50 feet deep. In two of them no water\nwas found, and hardly any in the third, but the supply was so small that it\nwas useless. The farm on which these wells were sunk is in a north-west\ndirection from the Forest Farm (that is the name of the farm where our well\nis), and about 80 to 100 yards distant.\nThese three wells were all in sand ; our well was through 15 feet of clay,\nthen sand, and lastly quicksand.\nThe river nearest to these farms is the Mersey, distant about four miles.\nThe following were present at the finding of the water [a lengthy list of\nnames and addresses is here given.]\n\f102 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nWe all were, and are, convinced that the operation of the divining rod in Mr.\nMullins' hands was perfectly honest and genuine, as well as very wonderful.\nJ. C.

The\nreport states that a Mr. Beck Chadwick, J. P., having sunk borings and\nfailed to find water, was led to employ Mr. Mullins, who from the\nindications given by the dowsing rod fixed on a certain spot, where he\nasserted an abundant supply of water would be found at about 70 feet\ndeep. A well was accordingly sunk, and, at between 50 and 60 feet, a\ngreat inrush of water occurred and a copious supply has been obtained.\nThe Editor of the Warrington Guardian to whom I applied, referred\nme to Mr. Chadwick's agent, Mr. J. Shaw Green, F.S.S., an accountant\nat Warrington, who could vouch for the facts. Mr Shaw Green's\nreply to my letter is as follows :\u2014\n18, King Street, Warrington, January 11th, 1897.\nThe whole of the circumstances are very familiar to me. The spot is in\nthe township of Kingsley at a place where a valley runs for a considerable\ndistance. Two trial borings were made by an eminent firm of well-sinkers\nat places selected by them, but without result, and it was upon their failure\nthat the services of the water diviner were brought in.\nIn reply to the queries stated in your letter :\n1. The facts [in the newspaper report] are correctly stated.\n2. Two previous attempts, as stated above, had been made, one of them\nimmediately before the water diviner was called in. I cannot give the\nexac^ depth.\n\fXXXII.] 103\nOn the So-called Divining Hod.\n3. Tho results are set out in the cutting. A well already existed with a\nsmall quantity of water in it at about 35 feet. The distance between place\nindicated by water diviner and well is about 18 yards. One of the trial\nborings was made at a distance of about 25 yards from the spot indicated by\nthe diviner.\nIt is altogether a most interesting case and the full particulars of the\nsearch appeared in the Warrington Guardian, I believe, in the month of\nAPril k8t. J. Shaw Green.\nIn reply to my inquiry, Mr. Shaw Green writes :\u2014\n18, King Street, Warrington. January 20th, 1897.\nThe gentleman who made the search for us was the eldest son of J.\nMullins, who died nearly three years ago.\nThe date of the search was Friday the 24th April, 1896.\nI will obtain and send you particulars of the abortive borings, but it may\nbe a few days before I can do so, for the particulars are at Kingsley and not\nin my office. J. Shaw Green.\nNo. 83.\u2014The Pall MM Gazette of February 20th, 1897, publishes\nthe following letter from Lord Burton :\u2014\nWe are situated in Needwood Forest, on the top of a mass of marl thrust\nup between the rivers Dove and Trent. Our water is derived from wells\naveraging from 140 ft. to 180 ft. deep, and owing to a series of dry years our\nsupply has recently been very scanty. Our best well gives about 4,000 gallons\nin the twenty-four hours.\nAbout three months ago I sent for Mr. Mullins, the well-known water\nfinder, who walked round the property with a small hazel wand or twig in\nhis hands. Every now and then the wand seemed to twitch, and he indicated\nthat water would be found in these places, naming an approximate depth and\nprobable supply. At last we came to a field where the twig gave indications of\na row of springs, and Mullins informed us that if we sank we should probably\nget a supply of nearly 40,000 gallons in the twenty-four hours. We have sunk,\nand at 140 feet to 150 feet we have a most abundant supply, quite equal to\nwhat was promised, and we expect to get more by driving adits right and left.\nOne curious thing was that when the twig was placed in another person's\nhands turning towards the ground, on Mullins grasping the hands the twig\nslowly turned up ; but this happened only with two out of four persons\nexperimented on. I cannot explain the phenomenon, but it appears to me\nto be perfectly genuine, and certainly in my case the result has been very\nsuccessful. Bcrton.\nFebruary 18th.\nI wrote to Lord Burton asking him whether any wells had been\nsunk on his estate unsuccessfully prior to young Mr. Mullins' visit.\nHis reply is as follows :\u2014\nRangemore, Burton-on-Trent, March 9th, 1897.\nI fear I can add no facts to the short letter I sent to the Pall Mall. [Prior\nto Mullins' visit] we may have sunk a dozen wells in all, varying from 40 to\n\f104 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\n60 yards in depth ; the supply is not copious in any of them ; the stable yard\nis the best, about 4,000 gallons in the 24 hours at the most,\u2014this well is\nover 60 yards deep. The supply at the new [Mullins] well about half a mile\nto the east of the above and about 300 yards below and south of the village,\nis so good that we-are going to considerable expense in sinking and putting\ndown pumps, erecting tank and tower and so forth. Mullins marked five\nsprings in a line extending over perhaps 30 yards or more. We are driving\nside adits from the well and they seem to be producing a quantity of water.\nBurton.\nNo. 84.\u2014The Essex Times of January 29th, 1896, reports : \u2014\nConsiderable difficulty has been experienced in finding a sufficient supply\nof water for the Bower House, Havering, the residence of Mr. A. Money\nWigram, M.P. As Havering stands on very high ground, the only chance of\nfinding supplementary sources of supply lay in the discovery of the course of\nthe underground springs. Investigation in this direction by the ordinary\nmethods having proved fruitless, Mr. W. H. Pemberton Barnes a few days\nago invited Mr. John Mullins. i A field near the top of the hill was selected\nas the sphere of operations. Providing himself with the indispensable rod,\nMr. Mullins began by walking slowly across the ground, holding one end of\nthe rod in each hand with the point downwards, until he came across what he\nintimated was an underground spring, when the twig would turn in his hands\nin a half-circle. He indicated a certain spot as the place where the spring\nwas strongest, giving as his opinion that water would be obtained at a depth\nof from 30 to 35 feet. Here a shaft was afterwards sunk, but before the\nspecified depth was reached the water came in so rapidly that operations had\nto be suspended, owing to the impossibility of working the pumps fast\nenough to keep the well empty.\nI wrote to Mr. Money Wigram for further particulars, and the\nfollowing is his reply, which has been delayed for the reasons given :\u2014\n101, Eaton Square, S.W., May 15th, 1897.\nI have left Havering, and for the last few months have been travelling in\nthe East.\nIn answer, I would say the first experiment made at Mullins' suggestion\nfailed through no fault of his. He said, \" You will find water [atj 37 feet.\"\nWe did, in a shifting bed of sand, but on going 3 feet lower we struck clay\nand lost it all. Afterwards he indicated two springs within a few feet of\neach other, and both were tapped with success.\nI believe in him strongly for surface springs, and should always consult\nhim were I building cottages, &c., where the supply required is small.\nA.

Barrett.\nThe Waterford Experiments.\nIn the group of cases under the head of the late Mr. J. Mullins\nwill be found a very striking one, No. 52, (p. 77), the particulars of\nwhich were kindly sent to me by Mr. Christie-Miller. Subsequently\nmy friend Mr. Kilroe, of the Geological Survey of Ireland, told me\nof a very similar case occurring at Messrs. Richardson's factory at\nWaterford. I begged Mr. Kilroe to put the facts in writing for me,\nwhich he did in the accompanying letter. Afterwards additional\nevidence of eye-witnesses was obtained and it then became evident the\ncase was the same as that sent to me by Mr. Christie-Miller ; this led\nto enquiry and it turned out that Mr. Christie-Miller, though not\nliving at Waterford, is the proprietor of Messrs. Richardson's factory.\nAs the case is of special importance it will he necessary to give some,\nI fear, rather tedious details.\nMr. Kilroe writes :\u2014\nGeological Survey of Ireland Office, 14, Hume Street, Dublin,\nJanuary 23rd, 1897.\nIn or about the year 1888, Messrs. Richardson, bacon curers, of Water\nford, required a considerable water supply and got professional advice, based\nupon geological grounds, as to where to obtain it by sinking. The amount\nprocured on sinking proved entirely insufficient. This was surface water,\nand when the rock was reached it proved quite dry, giving a worse rather\nthan a better prospect as the sinking progressed. The strata at the place\nare nearly vertical and the bedding much folded.\nAn English \"diviner\" was engaged, and to hinder collusion, the chief\nclerk of the firm met him at the boat on arrival in Waterford ; who also\nbrought him to the works. There the diviner was accompanied by the head\nof the firm and his staff of clerks, as he went around the premises. He\ncarried in his two hands a forked hazel twig, holding a branch of the fork in\neach hand, the stem extending from him in front horizontally. He almost\nimmediately came to a spot over which the rod bent slightly and quite\nspontaneously, as well as could be observed. This spot was marked and the\nsearch continued. Similar indications appeared at two or three other\nplaces. At one, the effect was so manifest that the rod twisted completely\nround and broke .'\u2014also of its own accord. (The man had several of these\nrods with him.) The firm sank at one of the places indicated and obtained a\ncopious supply of water.\nMr. Budd, a local amateur geologist, ascertained the above particulars\nand communicated all to Mr. Clark, of the Irish Survey, who gave them\nto me. t t> xr \u201e \u201e\nJ.

Should you want any further information\nI shall do my best to get it for you. W RlChARds0n\nMemorandum from Messrs. Richardson and Co., Waterford.\nFebruary 2nd, 1897.\nIn the year 1887, we received an estimate for boring a 2& inch artesian\nlx>re from John Henderson and Son, Glasgow. He started to bore on the\n18th May, 1887, with jumper steel drills. The first 15 feet was clay, the\nfollowing 17 feet was slaty sandstone, after which the rock became harder\nwith the result that the rate of boring slowed, varying from 2 to 5 feet per\nday. When going through extremely hard rock they bored (on Monday, the\n18th June, 1887) only 4 inches. We continued boring until we had reached\na depth of 292 feet, after which we widened the bore for 100 feet to allow a\npump to be lowered, but the yield was not sufficient to justify our going\ndeeper, so relinquished this bore.\nWe next started to bore, in 1888, a 7 inch bore hole at the bottom of a\nwell 62 feet deep. This bore was executed by the Diamond Rock Boring\nCo., of London, and was bored by a revolving tube 7 inches in diameter\nhaving black diamonds set in a nose piece fastened to bottom of tube. We\nbored 612 feet with this size tube and then reduced to 6 inches and with\nthe 6 inch tube bored 337 feet 7 inches, making a total depth bored of\n949 feet 7 inches from the bottom of well, and from the ground level of\n1,011 feet 7 inches. We had, during the process of boring, tested at\nintervals for yield of water but with no satisfactory result. We again tested\nat 1,011 feet 7 inches, and again failure, so relinquished this bore.\nWe then asked Mr. Kinahan [senior geologist of H.M. Geological Survey\nof Ireland] to come down\u2014which he did, and suggested a spot to bore.\nThis bore we started with a 4 inch tube diamond drill, and bored 40 feet\n\f108 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nthrough yellow sandstone when we came on blue slate for 8 inches ; we then\nstopped and wired Mr. Kinahan what we ought to do. In the interval we\ntested for water ;\u2014result, 230 gallons per hour, not one-tenth part of what we\nrequired. Mr. Kinahan advised going on again. Went on 11 feet more,\ntested again, with the yield 180 gallons per hour, a loss of 50 gallons ; wired\nMr. Kinahan again ; \u2014 reply, give up boring\u2014 which we did ;\u2014another failure.\nWe then sent for John Mullins, the water diviner. He suggested that\nwe put down a bore on a marked out line, which we did, with the result that\nwe have an ample supply.

The line runs N.N.E.\nThe particulars sent me by Messrs. Richardson are obviously of\ngreat interest and evidential value in connection with our subject.\nI was therefore anxious to obtain the best geological evidence on this\ncase. Happily Mr. G. H. Kinahan, M.E.I.A., who at the time was\nsenior geologist of the Irish Geological Survey, had not only been called\nin by Messrs. Richardson, prior to Mullins' visit, but had kept the\ncontemporary notes and correspondence relating to this case. The\nletters which Mr. Kinahan sent me (with an accompanying note from\nhimself) are from Messrs. Richardson and from a local geologist, Mr.\nBudd, and, as will be seen, they were written at the time of Mullins'\nvisit to Waterford.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 109\nMr. Kinahan writes to me as follows :\u2014\n[January 25th, 1897.]\nI am glad to learn through Mr. Clark that you are taking up the\nDivining Rod question. I, therefore, through him, send you a rather\ninteresting case. These letters [which follow] I give solely up to you, and\nyou are at liberty to use them as you like. I should, however, let you\nknow how I was connected with them. A bacon firm in Waterford (Messrs.\nDenny and Co. ) were looking for water, and their trials were unsatisfactory.\nMy friend, the late Mr. James Budd, advised them to apply to me. This\nthey did, and as their case was a simple one, I easily put them right. Then\nanother firm, Messrs. Richardson's, was in a similar predicament ;\u2014they\nhad a water supply, but not sufficient. They employed a borer who bored,\nI think, 1,000 feet, without finding water. They were then advised by Budd\nto employ me ; when I visited their premises I found it was probably\ncrossed by three water lines, one south, another at their well, and the third\nto the northward\u2014as the strata was hard, impervious ordovician shale. It\nwas evident that unless the bore hole was exactly on one of the water lines a\nbore was useless. I, therefore, advised sinking and driving. While they\nwere considering my report, young Richardson heard of the water-man,\nand what happened afterwards you will know from the letters. I have\nmy theory about their \"water-finder,\" and would like to talk it over\nwith you.\nG. H. Kinahan.\nThe next letter is from Mr. Richardson, addressed to Mr.\nKinahan in the year 1889 :\u2014\nWaterford, October 2Uh, 1889.\nIn reply to your favour, re John Mullins, Colerne, Chippenham, Wilt\nshire, I will give you a short account of his doings here. The morning he\ncame I had him met at the Milford steamer, in order to prevent his having\ncommunication with any one in Waterford, and making inquiries about our\npremises. I myself went with him when he began his searches for water.\nHe had in his hands a hazel fork of this shape holding an\nend between his fingers of each hand. He then walked about until the\nhazel fork twisted suddenly in his hands. He did this over and over again\nto test it, and marked several places for us to bore where he said he was\ncertain we should find water, and gave the depths. One place in particular\nhe pointed out to us and advised our boring, saying we should find about\n1,500 gallons per ho\\ir at a depth of 80 to 90 feet. We procured the boring\npeople, and the result of it was we obtained water at the depth of 79 feet\nfrom the surface. We tested to 1,672 gallons per hour, but we are sure\nthere is more, only our pump could not test a greater supply. He [told us\nhe] has six sons, and not one of them has this power.\nIt is a most curious thing, but must be genuine without doubt. I know\nseveral people in the north who had Mullins there, and found water where\npointed out by him. It was from them I heard of Mullins in the first\ninstance.\n\f110 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nThe rod often breaks with the force it turns in his hands. The greater the\nmovement the more water is there, and by this he tells the depth.\nW. Richardson.\nMr. Richardson adds later :\u2014\nHe holds the twig straight out in front of him, with the ends passing\nbetween his finger and thumb and coming out between his second and third\nfingers ; backs of hands downwards.\nThe next letter is from Mr. Budd, addressed to Mr. Kinahan, and\nis interesting on account of its having been written whilst the boring\nexperiments were in progress :\u2014\nTivoli, Tramore, Waterford, September 3rd, 1889.\nYour being interested in Messrs. Richardson's case here will be my\napology for my inflicting on you the following authentic account of the late\nproceedings there.\nWell, they pierced where you pointed out to a depth of about 40 feet,\ngot a little water, and then came on our blue metamorphic rock. Then the\nboring machine was, I believe, out of order, and while waiting for some new\nparts from London the borers got some jobs in Clonmel ; this delayed work\nhere. Meantime young Mr. R. heard in the North of a man named Mullins, I\nthink from Chippenham, who had been most successful in finding water\nwith his hazel twigs. He is one of a few who possesses this \"faculty.\" He\ncannot communicate it, for none of his own sons possess it. They sent for\nhim, and to prevent any collusion or prefatory inquiries, one of their clerks\nmet him at the Milford boat, and walked up with him to the concern.\nHe carried with him about a dozen fresh forked twigs as thick as a quill,\neach side of the fork 12 or 15 inches long.\nHe traversed the whole of the premises, marking out four places where\nwater might be got. The premises are about 700 feet long [see diagram].\nO\nX.\no\nG.H K.\no o\n.T.M. (1) J.M. (2)\n^ 700 ft. \u2014}\nX = the abortive 1,000 bore ft. hold.\nNo. 1 he said was the best place. No. 2 was not 20 feet from the place\nthat you marked out (marked G. H. K.).\nHe held the twigs near their ends, between his second and third fingers,\nas if you were going to write, the point of the fork pointing downwards.\nAt No. 1 the point lifted itself up till it turned over backward and twisted\nitself till it broke ! \"Water here not more than 80 feet deep,\" said he.\nHe used another and another twig. The clerks then held them with him,\nand held his hands, always the same effect. I saw to-day two of the broken\ntwisted twigs.\n\fXXXII.] Ill\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nNow for the result [at J.M. (1), which corresponds to No. 4 in Messrs.\nRichardson's drawing.]\nThe diamond borers pierced through 41 feet of boulder clay, then through\n39 feet of our ordinary clay slate. Then on the 2nd [yesterday,] touched our\nold friend, the blue metamorphic rock, and stopped, sounded, and found\n36 feet of water in their four-inch tube. They were told to pump, a steam\none, which they did all night, 3 o'clock on 2nd to 9 o'clock on 3rd\u201418 hours\n\u2014without any diminution of the supply, their estimate being 800 to 900\ngallons per hour.\nArrangements were then made while I was there to pump into a cistern\ncontaining 270 gallons. After repeated trials the average was found to be\n1,560 gallons per hour without the slightest sign of abatement. To-day it is\nreported to me to be 2,000 gallons per hour. Good water, temperature 52\u00b0,\nan important item to Messrs. Richardson's.\nI would like to know what you think of this thing. To me it is wholly\nunaccountable. All I know is, they are singing \"Jubilate \" at Richardson's.\nWhat would Professor Huxley say ? J glTdd\nMr. Budd gives additional particulars in the next letter, also\naddressed to Mr. Kinahan :\u2014\nTivoli, Tramore, September 11th, 1889.\nI have been not only considering the bearings of the case, and it is an\nextraordinary one, but I have been making myself up on all the facts of it.\nMullins was never in the South of Ireland before, and certainly had no\nidea of Messrs. Richardson's locality. As to reading faces : they had no\nexpectation of success ; indeed, the failure of your boring made them give\nup all hope, and one of their principal persons utterly scoffed at the idea of\nthe twigs ; their faces, they tell me, must have expressed only incredulity\nand curiosity. I can quite believe that some nervous or muscular\nforce, voluntary or involuntary, affected the twigs, for certainly they could\nnot move of themselves. But was this force derived from some innate\nfaculty? Mullins made no pretence of magic ; there was nothing about him\nof \"See now vot you till see.\" Quite in a business-like way he walked\nthrough the premises as each door was opened for him, most of the clerks\nfollowing him, and stopping every now and then. Up to the present there\nhas been no effect on other wells with them or elsewhere. As to his know\nledge, he did not know whether there was any well in the concern, but\nhe had the general idea, which every one in Waterford has, that they had\nbored and utterly failed.\nThe clerk who accompanied him from the steamer, and whom I cross-\nexamined to-day, is a reliable man. He was warned to answer no questions\nas to wells, water, or strata. Mullins did not ask him a single question.\nWhen M. was asked before he left about his successes elsewhere, he said\nhe had often gone to places where there was no water, but when he had\nindicated water in any place, as far as he knew, it had always been found,\nbut he made no boast of this, said only he could not account for it.\nAs to 80 feet, no one said this to him, nor did any one know the depth\nof the strata there. Four boring was only 41 feet deep. The well through\nwhich the 1,000 feet was bored was originally 60 feet deep, and it was only\n\f112 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nto-day that I learned for the first time, with some difficulty, that the steam\npump well is 72 feet deep.

In most of them he paused,\nand said, \" There is no water here,\" but in two of them he said, \" There ia\nwater here,\" and they marked them in red.\nThe last place they came to, to their surprise, he said, ' ' This is by far\nthe best place I have come to.

Richardson kindly send the following additional\nparticulars :\u2014\nWaterford, February 22nd, 1897.\nThe Mullins line runs N.N.E. and almost in the direction of the bedding\nof the rocks.\nThis was merely a coincidence, as Mullins had no local knowledge what\nsoever of the locality, it being his first visit to this part of the country, and\nwe gave him no knowledge in any way, as to position of wells, or that we\nhad bored. In fact we kept him in entire ignorance, until he had located\nhis line.\nThe line as marked on our map, and position of well, is the correct\nposition, and all the borings and old wells are to the east of Mullins' line\nexcept the final well, which of course is on the line.\ni In reply to my enquiry Messrs.

As to this Messrs. Richardson write as follows:\u2014\nMarch 11tfc, 1897.\nIn reply to your enquiry, the surface of the well is 95 feet above low\nwater level ; while the bottom is 13 to 14 feet above it. The level of the\nwater in the well when not pumping is 44 feet from the surface.\nW.

From the wells above and below the premises there seemed\nto be two water lines crossing it, both of which our friend [Mullins] found\nby instinct, due either to his being able to smell water, or that water has\nsuch an influence on his nervous system that he can tell the distance and\nquantity when he is near it ; unless he was a Sherlock Holmes who could\ndraw conclusions from trifles that no one else could detect. G H K\nHaving submitted the foregoing case to the Geological Survey of\nIreland, Mr. J. R. Kilroe was good enough to send me a memorandum\non the subject, discussing the whole matter from a geological point of\nview, accompanied by a geological map and section of the locality. Mr.\nKilroe's memorandum is as follows :\u2014\nH.M. Geological Survey of Ireland, Dublin.\nNotes on the Borings at Waterford.\nThe rocks of the neighbourhood arc of Silurian age (Ordovician), and are\nin great part concealed by glacial drift. The drift area is indicated\nby stippling on the accompanying map ; the portions enclosed by chain\n(boundary) lines are those where the rock is devoid of drift, and appears at\nor comes very near the surface .\nThe strata consist of slates and grits in alternating bands ; the former\nare comparatively impervious to water while the latter are more or less\nporous, and some may be sufficiently so to constitute reservoirs for under\nground water.\nThe beds of rock are set at a uniformly high angle\u2014about 60\u00b0 to the\nhorizontal near Waterford,\u2014technically called the dip : they are also much\nfolded and contorted and dislocated by faults, as may well be observed\nalong the sea coast not far distant, though no faulting, and but little\ncontortion of the strata, seems to have been noticed at, or near, Waterford\ncity.\nThe strata at Waterford, moreover, are cleaved in a direction which\naccords with that of the stratification ; but stratification and faulting, in\ngeneral, affect the location of underground waters, rather than cleavage,\nso that the latter is not of apparent import in our case.\nThe futility of the first three attempts to find water proves the absence\nfrom the rocks pierced, of water-bearing strata, in other words, of porous\nsandstone or grit bands of any importance. A particular case in which a\nthick sandstone band might be supposed to exist, concealed, notwithstanding\nthe unsuccessful sampling afforded by the first experiences, is discussed\nbelow ; about this, however, one cannot speak confidently without a more\nintimate knowledge of the ground.\nThe lack of water in those borings does not seem to me to be accounted\nfor by concealed faults or breaks in the strata ; for if the rocks were thereby\nsufficiently shattered to admit of leakage, and descent of the water from the\nground tried, it would not descend lower than the level of the Suir and the\n\fXXXII.] 115\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\n\f116 [pakt\nProfessor W.

It cannot therefore be due to\npercolation from the river ; and must collect beneath the more or less\nporous drift which covers the rock at Richardson's works (see section).\nDiagrammatic Section along a vertical plane supposed to cut through strata\nat Waterford, at right angles to Mullins' water line. The wells are\nnumbered as on page 108.\nAssuming that water would be found at the other points indicated by\nMullins, equally with that at which the successful boring was put down,\nwe should have a wet zone stretching N.N.E.-ward, in which a copious\nsupply would be, in fact t(xts, tapped [at one point] at some 80 feet below the\nsurface.\nThis zone might be coincident with a line of fault in which water fallin\nupon the sloping surface northwestward would collect ; and such a supposition\nis favoured by the circumstance that it is not coincident with the direction\ntaken by the outcrop of the bedding.\nOn the other hand, a break of sufficientdimensions to supply over 1,500\ngallons of water per hour would in all probability extend to and beyond\nthe river, and admit of very great if not entire leakage of the water entering\nit, to a much lower level than 44 feet from the surface at all events ; and no\nfault is represented here, on the published maps of the Geological Survey.\nAn alternative supposition is that of a porous stratum concealed beneath\nthe drift, in the slight hollow at Richardson's premises. The only manner\nin which such a stratum could occur, consistently with the direction and\namount of dip recorded for the beds in the vicinity, is such as that repre\nsented in the above section, drawn at right angles to Mullins' wet zone,\nAnd showing the relative distances from the latter of Kinahan's boring B,\nthe 1,000 feet boring C, and the first one D.

The facts are briefly as follows :\u2014\nThe owner of an estate near Horsham, in Sussex, Mr. Henry Harben,\nfound there was a scarcity of water on his property. He called in the\naid of an experienced local well sinker and had a well sunk some 90\nfeet deep (well A, see p. 118), but got little water\u2014in fact, this well,\nMr. Harben states in a memorandum he sent me, is \"absolutely\nuseless.\" In an adjoining field, some 200 yards off, and at the lowest\npart of the estate, another well was sunk under the advice of another\nwell sinker (well C) ; at some 55 feet down a small spring of water\nwas met with running into the well, but the quantity was so small\nthat the supply was quite insufficient.\nHaving spent a considerable sum uselessly in sinking these two\nwells, Mr. Harben determined to obtain from London the highest\nengineering and geological advice. His position, as one of the\ndirectors of the New River Company, and his ample means, rendered\nthis comparatively easy. Acting under such advice another well was\nsunk (well B) not far from the first one (well A). This well was of\nlarge dimensions and sunk to nearly 100 feet, with, however, little\nresult as regards water ; tunnels were then driven in various directions,\nand finally, after \u00a31,000 had been spent on this last attempt\u2014made\nunder the best scientific advice and with the most modern and\napproved engineering methods\u2014the well B was abandoned.\nFinally Mr. Harben was induced to send for the dowser, Mr. J.\nMullins, of whom he had heard, and whom he had distinctly refused\nto employ before sinking well B, as he utterly disbelieved in him.\nMullins came some time in the year 1893 (not long before his death),\nand, to prevent his gaining any local information, Mr. Harben met\nMullins at the railway station and drove him to his estate, Warnham\nLodge, some four miles off. Mullins said it was his first visit to that part\nof Sussex, and there is no reason to think otherwise. Arrived at Warn\nham Lodge, Mullins traversed the estate, said there was no water\n\f118 Professor W. F. Barrett.

As he came near well C he was narrowly observed. Mr.\nHarben tells me he and the well-sinker alone knew the exact direction\nof the streamlet of water which entered this well ; no hint of any\nkind was given to Mullins. Suddenly the rod turned\u2014\"There is a small\nstream here,\" he said, \"flowing in this direction.\" This was absolutely\ncorrect, 1 am informed ; Mullins indicated the exact direction the\nstreamlet was known to enter the well. Mullins told Mr. Harben\nthat the depth of this well was between 50 feet and 60 feet, the\nactual depth being 55 feet. Dissatisfied with this supply, Mullins\nsaid he would try the higher ground. Mr. Harben tried to dissuade him,\nas that part had been examined and rejected by the scientific experts.\n\" Never mind,\" said Mullins, \"I am going to try it.\" At the top of\nthe hill the rod turned vigorously, and the spot was marked ; 30 feet\nfurther on (absolutely on the crest of the hill) it turned again. \" Call\nthis No. 1,\" said Mullins; 20 feet further it turned again. \"Call\nthis No. 2,\" said Mullins, \" and the first No. 3.\" Mr. Harben then\nremarked that water doubtless existed everywhere at a certain depth\nbeneath the hill. Mullins tried carefully and said \" No. Nos. 1 and\n2 are independent springs, there is no water between them, but you\nwill find plenty of water at either of these places at 12 feet or 15 feet\ndeep.\"\nMullins was then taken across the road to find a well for the supply\nof some cottages on the estate, about 250 feet distant from these last\nsprings ; he found a place where he said water would be obtained at a\ndepth of about 40 feet. Here a well was subsequently dug, and at\n35 feet deep a good spring was found, which, however, on analysis,\nproved to be chalybeate ; accordingly this well was filled up. Mullins\nhad indicated another place for a well, 75 feet distant from No. 2\nspring, and some little distance from the cottages. Upon sinking\nhere, water was found in this well in sufiicient quantity for the require\nments of the cottages (well G.).\nThe spots Mullins had marked as springs Nos. 1 and 2 on the crest\nof the hill were then dug ; soon a hard limestone was encountered\nand after blasting and sinking at each spot to a depth of 12 feet from\nthe surface, a copious supply of excellent water was suddenly met with\n(wells E and F). At No. 3 a good spring was also found at 19 feet\ndeep (well D). Much to Mr. Harben's surprise, Mullins had proved\nright in each case.\nMr. Harben, fortunately for our enquiry, then resolved to go to the\nexpense of testing Mullins' assertion that no water would be found\nbetween wells E and F, but that^ both were independent springs. By\nmeans of a powerful pump he had one of the wells pumped nearly dry ;\nthe water level in the other was unaffected. To leave no room for\n\f120 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ndoubt, however, Mr. Harben went to the expense of further testing\nMullins' statement by tunnelling through the solid rock the inter\nmediate 20 feet from the bottom of well E to the bottom of well F.\nMr. Harben assures me from his own personal observation, corroborated\nby the overseer, whom I saw, that no water was found between the\ntwo wells, the intermediate rock being dry.i As the tunnel joined the\nwater in the two wells a large storage tank has thus been formed some\n5 feet in diameter and 20 feet long. \" We have had,\" Mr. Harben\nwrites to me, \"ever since, even in the driest season, a most abundant\nsupply of water, and Mullins was right not only in indicating the\nprecise spots where water was to be found, but also in his assertion that\nwater would not be found between the two wells E and F.\"\nWriting to me on April 8th, 1897, Mr. Harben says :--\nI had forgotten to tell you of another illustration of Mullins' power.\nHe was walking with me towards my Farm Buildings [marked Home Farm\non the map] trying his rod occasionally ; when he came to the spot marked\nwith an asterisk [see right hand side of map], he stopped and said that here\nwas another spring. I told him there was n well in the neighbourhood.\nMullins then said, \" I shall be able to tell you whereabouts it is.\" He walked\nto and fro with his rod and said, \"The spring runs that way, and the well is\nprobably behind that chimney \" [see map, well H]. This was perfectly\ncorrect ; a well with pump attached was in an outhouse behind the Farm\nbuilding. There was no possibility of Mullins seeing the well or pump, as\nit was entirely out of sight and in a closed building ; nor had he left my\nside to make any enquiries. We had not yet verified his other predictions\nand this incident, together with his discovery of the direction of the spring\nrunning into the well C, and the depth of that well, impressed me much.\nOn visiting Warnham Lodge, I found what Mr. Harben said was\nstrictly accurate as to the impossibility of Mullins seeing the well and\npump H from the position he occupied. In fact, I could not discover\nit until taken into the building where it was situated.\nThe foregoing account was compiled from information Mr. Harben\ngave me either in writing or verbally ; it has been seen and revised by\nM r.

Harben.\nFailures.\nThe evidence thus far presented shows that certain persons, among\nwhom the late John Mullins was conspicuous, certainly possess some\nfaculty which is not given to all men, and not recognised by the science\nof to-day. It would be interesting to know how many failures Mullins\nhad in the course of his career ; but this, I fear, it is impossible now\nto ascertain. There could not have been very many, or news of them\nwould probably have reached me, as I have made numerous enquiries\nfor this purpose throughout the districts visited by Mullins in England\nand Ireland. A few cases have, however, been reported to me which\nI will here detail.\nThe first was the case of the Hastings Board of Guardians, who\nengaged Mr. J. Mullins in 1888. A new workhouse had been erected\nand attempts to find an adequate supply had, I believe, been unsuccess\nfully made before Mullins was called in. The Guardians were subject\nto some criticism for asking a \"dowser \" to advise them where to sink a\nwell, and this was increased when, after sinking some 80 feet at\none of the spots indicated by Mullins and no water found, the case\nwas reported a failure. Later on, however, after the well had been\nsunk some 200 feet, the architect reported (according to the local\npapers and the Gas Journal of June 4th, 1889), that a supply of\n2,300 gallons daily was obtained. In a letter to Mr. Vaughan Jenkins,\nJohn Mullins writes that he marked three places where water would be\nfound, and indicated the best, but \" the Guardians chose to sink\non the worst and had to go deeper than they expected, but they did,\nat last, get a good supply of water, though not sufficient for their wants,\nwhich were great.\" In the Sussex Daily News of May 23rd, 1890, a\nmeeting of the Board of Guardians is reported, at which a discussion\ntook place concerning the success that had attended Mullins. Councillor\nPerrins moved that whilst the Board believed in Mullins' sincerity\nthey regretted their hopes had not been realised, as at the best spot\nindicated by Mullins they had sunk 80 feet and found no water. [This\nwas evidently a second well.] Others raised some objection to Mr.\nPerrins' motion, and Councillor Chapman thought it only fair to say\ni I wrote to Captain McCalmont, M.P., who informed me that this incident did\nnot occur at his house, but at a neighbour's in the country. The name, I learnt on\nenquiry, was Mr. Crawshay, to whom I wrote. It is, I find, a reference to the\nincident that occurred with the dowser Mr. Tompkins, related by Mr. Crawshay,\nparticulars of which are given on a subsequent page. See latter part of No. 102\np. 151.\u2014W.F.B.\n\f122 [PAltT\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nthat at the first well they had a yield of 2,300 gallons a day and that\nthey had not driven headings as Mullins recommended.\nI wrote to the local newspaper and also to the Chairman of the\nBoard of Guardians to know whether any greater success had been\nobtained later, as I saw by another newspaper report that such was\nthe case. To neither of my letters was any reply sent. Through the\nkindness of a relative at Hastings who saw Councillor Perrins on my\nbehalf, the following letter from Mr. Perrins was sent to me :\u2014\n157, Queen's-road, Hastings, March 26Wi, 1897-\nThe Hastings Guardians a few years ago purchased a piece of land for\na workhouse site, and for the purpose of determining the best spot to sink\na well, the late Mr. Mullins was engaged to test the land by means of the\ntwig . . .\n[Mr. Perrins then describes the modus operandi, and the evident\nsincerity and absence of trickery on the part of the dowser.]\nMullins, at the end of his experiments, was able to indicate the best\nspot at which the well should be sunk, as being the place where the various\nsprings converged nearest to each other ; he also stated the probable depth\nat which the water would be found, but would not absolutely pledge himself\non that point. Suffice it to say, water was ultimately found in fairly large\nquantity, and the well only needed the requisite headings to store the water\nto make it a complete success. The water was found at a depth of about\n25 to 30 feet. W pERR1nij.\nIt will be noticed that the foregoing letter gives a much more\nfavourable account of Mullins than the statement made by the writer\nof the letter at the Board of Guardians in 1890, nor was I able to\nobtain from Mr. Perrins any explanation of the discrepancy.\nThis case cannot therefore be regarded as a complete failure, in fact\nI am informed by Mr. Percy Clive that it was hearing from a friend of\nhis of the success which attended Mullins at this Hastings visit that led\nMr. Clive to employ Mullins on his estate in Herefordshire (see p. 35).\nF. 3i.\u2014The next case, however, is more properly a failure ; here\nalso I found it extremely difficult to obtain precise details. Mullins,\nit appears, was called in by the governors of the Berry Wood Asylum,\nnear Northampton, to find a water supply, and as no water was found\nat the depth he estimated, he was considered an impostor. I wrote\nto the authorities at the Asylum for particulars, and eventually\nobtained the following information :\u2014\nBerry Wood, Northampton, February 27th, 1897.\nMullins, father and son, were here in March, 1892. They said we should\nfind water at a given place, and there we sunk a well about 70 feet deep right\nthrough the ironstone and drove headings in two directions without result.\ni The numbering, \"F. 3, etc,\" is continued from p. 64.\n\fXXXII.] On the So-called Divining Rod.\nI should say that water is often found under the Northamptonshire\nironstone, and one of our wells draws its supply from that source.\nThe marlstone lies about 300 feet from the surface here. We knew we\ncould obtain water at that depth, as numerous wells in the county get their\nwater from this marlstone. Having failed with the ironstone we bored to the\nmarlstone and found abundant water. Of course, Mullins had nothing to do\nwith this, as it was well known the water was there.\nRichard Greene.\nWith reference to this case Mr. H. WT. Mullins writes that he went\nto Berry Wood with his father and that a very large supply of water\nwas ultimately obtained, only at a greater depth than they had\nestimated. This does not, however, put any different construction on\nthe result.\nF. 4.\u2014The next case is from Mr. Denny, of Waterford, whose\nlarge bacon-curing establishment is near Messrs. Richardson's premises,\nwhere Mullins had the remarkable success detailed under the head of\nthe Waterford Experiments.\nMr. Denny writes to me as follows :\u2014\nWaterford, February 5th, 1897.\nMullins indicated several spots on which he said water would be found,\nbut in our case we got nothing practically but surface water. In fact with\nus here Mullins' plan proved as great a failure as it proved a success in Mr.\nRichardson's case.\nMullins also indicated a spot on our Cork premises whore water would\nbe found, and following his advice we dug a well and found a good supply at\nabout the depth he mentioned. E H M Denny\nI wrote to ascertain some further particulars, and learnt that at\nWaterford they sunk through clay and slaty rock down to 57 feet,\nand then bored a six inch hole to a depth of 207 feet from the\nsurface, but found no good spring, the water obtained from the well\nbeing mostly surface water.\nWhen the Waterford case (p. 106) is read in connection with this,\nit will be seen how easy it is to miss the exact water line in this\nlocality. Messrs. Denny tell me Mullins pointed out several places\nwhere they would find water, and they sank at one of these ; it is,\nhowever, conceivable that a very small deviation by the dowser, or the\nwell-sinker, would be fatal to success in this particular instance.\nThese are all the failures o9 the elder Mullins which I have been\nable to obtain ; even if multiplied tenfold they probably would not\namount to one per cent of the successes which he appears to have had ;\nfor it must be borne in mind that whilst I have printed all the\nfailures of which I can get any corroboration, only those successes are\ngiven which I have heard of that appear to bear upon the main object\nof this paper.\n\f124 [part\nProfessor W.

I was, of\ncourse, sometime before I would take hold of the rod and try it, as I was an\nunbeliever, and after I found I possessed the power, I was a long time before\nI would practise it, though I had numerous invitations.\nSince then I have discovered thousands of springs of water with my\ndivining rod, and can openly say that I have never failed to find water at the\nspots I have indicated. In numerous cases I have been called in after great\nexpense had been incurred without success ; also in many instances I have\ndiscovered water within a very few yards of the unsuccessful operations. I\nmay say that I have discovered over a hundred springs within a radius of\nabout 30 miles of where I am now living. I still feel a peculiar tingling\nsensation passing through my body, when standing immediately over springs\nof water.\nThe power to use the rod is not, I think, hereditary. My father did not\npossess the power, but I have a little daughter who possesses the power to a\nslight degree. W ^E\nOn my venturing to question Mr. Stone's statement that he \" never\nhad a failure,\" he replies, \"I would frankly tell you, if I could recall\na single failure, but I do not know of even one that I have had.\"\nThis statement is, however, not quite correct, as Mr. Stone, like other\ndowsers, has had occasional failures, particulars of which have reached\nme and will be given in a subsequent section In another letter, Mr.\nStone adds, \" The sensation I experience when over an underground\nspring is very like what is felt when grasping the handles of an\nelectric machine, often seen at railway stations.\"\nThe book of testimonials Mr. Stone sent me certainly contains\na very remarkable and lengthy list of successes testified to by\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 125\nowners and agents of landed property, manufacturers, etc. ; the\nfollowing is one of these.\nNo. 85. \u2014The manager of a brewery in Newcastle writes :\u2014\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, November 7th, 1894.\nThe success which has attended the sinking and completion of our well\naffords another striking proof of Mr. Stone's marvellous power in the use of\nthe divining rod. He visited us in May, 1894, and with his divining rod\ndirected us to a spot where he said we would find water about 40 feet from\nthe surface. His prediction was correct, for after sinking 41 feet, we came\nupon a spring of beautiful water, large enough to supply our wants at this\nbrewery. We need scarcely say that our confidence in Mr. Stone's ability is\nbeyond doubt, and he fully merits the fame which he has achieved in this\ndistrict. pro rphB Arthur's Hill Brewery Company,\nA. H. Higginbottom.\nIn reply to my enquiries Mr. Higginbottom writes :\u2014\nPost Office Chambers, Newcastle-on-Tyne,\nOctober 23rd, 1896.\nBefore engaging Mr. Stone no attempts had been made to find water by\nboring. I cannot believe Mr. Stone's success in our case was a mere chance.\nHis prediction as to the depth at which we should find water was about\naccurate.\nThese replies answer your questions. I may now add that the experi\nments were made inside and outside the brewery ; the strongest indication\nof the presence of water exhibited by the twig in the hands of Mr. Stone\nwas in a cellar, the floor of which was covered with cement about three inches\nthick. Having in my own mind perfect confidence in the power of\nMr. Stone I did not even bore, but at once proceeded with the sinking of\nthe well with the result that at a depth of 20 feet we came across good\nfeeders ; but at 40 feet, predicted by Mr. Stone as the depth at which we\nshould find a good supply, we found all the water we wanted and now can\ndraw 3,000 gallons per day. In order to put Mr. Stone to a further test 1\ntook him to a back street about 25 yards from the brewery where very many\nyears ago there was a pump (but of which Mr. Stone knew nothing) and on\nthe very spot where it stood the twig denoted the presence of water, but not\nof sufficient quantity for our requirements.i A H Higginbottom.\nI wrote to Mr. Stone to furnish me with particulars of any\ncases where, as he stated in his letter of October 13th, he had been\ncalled in to find water by the rod \"after great expense had been\nincurred without success.\" He replied he had not kept a list of all\nthese cases, but quoted a few he remembered as follows :\u2014\nNo. 86.\u2014Colonel Grantham, West Keal Hall, Spilsby, dug to the depth\nof 50 feet for a water supply for a house, without success, and sent for me\ni This is referred to by another correspondent see No. 94.\u2014W. F. B.\n\f126 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nto come and test with my divining rod. I did so, and tested, and about\nten yards of where his deep sinking had been carried out, I discovered a\nbeautiful spring of pure water at a depth of 30 feet. The water came in so\nstrong when tapped, that the men had great difficulty in bricking the well.\nI have had just the same results in other parts of the estate.\nI wrote to Colonel Grantham asking him if the foregoing state\nment, which I sent, was correct. Colonel Grantham, I learnt with\nregret, had recently died. His son, Captain Grantham, who was\npresent at the experiments and took much interest in them,\nwrites :\u2014\nWest Keal Hall, Spilsby, Lincolnshire,\nOctober 19f\/i, 1896.\nMr. Stone is quite correct in saying that he has sunk two most successful\nwells for us in West Keal ; the spring, or as it was in this case the run, of\nwater, being found by use of the divining rod. Certainly in one case a well\nhad been sunk to considerable depth, without success, within twenty yards\nof where Stone found a large supply at, as he says, about 30 feet. I do not\nknow the depth of the well originally sunk without success, but could find\nout if you care to know. Not only did he find the stream of water, but\ncould tell in what direction it was running. Having found two streams\nrunning at right angles he pointed out the spot where they would meet, and\non walking over it with his rod proved to be right within a few feet. He\nalso told us pretty nearly, if not quite, the exact depth of the water both\ntimes he has sunk for us. There is an under-drain running a small run of\nwater across the drive in front of my house, with nothing to indicate the\nplace ; I got him to walk along the drive with the rod ; as soon as he stood\nover the drain the twig turned over.\nE. M. Grantham.\nIn reply to further enquiries, Captain Grantham writes :\u2014\nWest Keal Hall, Spilsby, October 27th, 1896.\nMr. Stone assured us that we should get a sufficient supply of water by\nsinking on what he said was the strongest run. It being a suitable place we\ndid so, with, as I have already told you, every success. That there is some\nthing in the indication of the rod, after seeing it used, is not in my mind\nopen to question. I consider it is of the greatest use and saving in finding\nsprings, and should not now think of sinking a well when I was not sure of\nwater without the use of the divining rod. I have not as yet been able to\nascertain the depth of the unsuccessful well you mention, as I have been\naway from home, but will do so and let you know.\nE. M. Grantham.\nAsked the exact depth of the wells, in a subsequent letter Captain\nGrantham informs me that the unsuccessful well was 42 feet deep ;\n28 feet of this were dug and 14 feet bored. The successful well sunk\nby Mr. Stone was only 30 feet deep, and was 15 yards distant from\nthe useless well.\n\fXXXII.] 127\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nNo. 87.\u2014The next \" evidential \" case Mr. Stone quoted was as\nfollows :\u2014\nMr. Shirley, Ettington Park, near Stratford-on-Avon, had gone to\ngreat expense in a field this summer, and had to give up the same as\nColonel Grantham did, without any success, and he sent for me to go and\ntest. I at once went, and in the same field, only 15 yards from his expensive\nexcavation, I discovered an abundant supply of water at 7 feet deep, and my\nmen have just completed the laying on of the water, by natural gravitation,\nto the top of a very large mansion, gardens, stables, and yards. Many\nexpensive trials had been made in trying to obtain a water supply to this\nhouse, but without success. Therefore the house could not be occupied\nthrough not having a water supply.\nI wrote to Mr. Shirley, sending him the foregoing statement by\nMr. Stone, and asking how far it was correct. Mr. Shirley replies :\u2014\nLough Fea, Carrickmacross, Ireland,\nOctober 23>d, 1896.\nMr. Stone's statement is correct. I was with him when he went over\nvarious portions of my English property. He marked five or six places\nwhere he said there would be water, but so far I have only had one actually\ntested ; this was, however, perfectly successful, the water was found where\nhe pointed out and at the depth he stated. I had previously gone to\nconsiderable expense in sinking, but could not find a sufficient supply. I\nwas quite satisfied with Stone. S -g ghIRLBy\nIn a subsequent letter, after reading the proof of the above, Mr.\nShirley writes :\u2014\nEttington Park, Stratford-on-Avon, March 23rd, 1897.\nWe sank at various places looking for water before Stone's visit ; the one\nnearest to the subsequent supply found by Stone was about 20 or 30 yards\noff and about 10 feet deep : Stone went a little deeper but there was water\nbefore we got to this depth. The supply has continued very good. . . .\nStone found the main supply at once and without hesitation, and certainly\nsaved me a great deal of expense. s g Shirley\nNo. 88.\u2014The following is the next \" evidential \" case quoted by\nMr. Stone :\u2014\nA large hall called Preston Hall, Uppingham, Rutlandshire, had been\nstanding empty for several years through not having a water supply.\nMajor Codrington, of 110, Eaton-square, London, went to look at it with the\nview of purchasing, and when he found there was no water on the place he\nrefused to purchase, but agreed he would wait and see if I could find water.\nI was, therefore, sent for, and upon my arrival I met Major Codrington and\nthe agents of the estate. They had also a gentleman from London to meet\nme who is a leading geologist.\nI at once tested with my rod, and said a spring of water would be found\nflowing at about the depth of 60 feet. The geologist said water would be\n\f128 [paht\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nfound at 20 feet anywhere about the place, and he said to the Major, \" If\nyou don't find water at 20 feet, don't sink deeper whatever you do, for you\nwon't find water until you get to 150 feet.\" It was decided to have a trial\nfor the water, and the well is now sunk ; not a drop of water was found at\n20 feet, so the well was carried deeper until it reached 60 feet. Just at this\ndepth, to the inch, a beautiful spring of water was tapped, which yields an\nabundant supply for all purposes, and through this result Major Codrington\nhas purchased the estate.\nNine wells had been sunk on this estate before I visited it, without\nsuccess, and useless wells are on each side of the well I have just sunk. My\nsinking plant is still on the spot and the well is just completed and open for\ninspection.\nI sent the foregoing to Major Codrington and asked him how far it\nwas an accurate statement. Major Codrington's reply and subsequent\nletters are as follows :\u2014\n110, Eaton-square, 8.W., October 19<\/i, 1896.\nStone's account is substantially accurate. There are a few details which\nare not quite accurate, however. There was water on the place, but the\nsupply was insufficient. The geologist did not imply that water was to be\nfound at 150 feet, but he merely said, ' ' The clay is 150 feet thick at least,\nand there is no water in it.\"\nAt about 60 feet the clay was noticed to be very wet, and the actual\nsupply of water comes from a point 66 feet below the surface of the ground,\nwhere there is a band of rock about 7 or 8 inches thick.\nI sent a piece of this rock to the geologist, and he pronounced it to be\na band of limestone, such as frequently occurs in the upper lias clay.\nI may say that the soil which lies above this clay, and which is from\n20 to 25 feet thick, is known as \" Northampton sand.\" All the old wells are\nmerely dug in this, but they have apparently been neglected for years.\nThey nearly all contained some water, but, as I have said, the supply has\nnot been sufficient for the place.\nAs. to the name of the geologist, I do not like to give it to you without\nhis permission, but I will ask him, and if he has no objection, send his name\nto you.\nI had the water in the newly made well analysed, and the first analysis\nwas not satisfactory. Being told that it frequently happens that new wells\nare contaminated, either by accident or design (men washing in them, etc.),\nI had precautions taken, and the well cleaned, and the water analysed\nagain.

Upon my arrival on the scene, I pointed\nout a spot where a spring of water would be found, after walking about five\nminutes. Water waa found at this spot, less than 20 feet deep, and the\nprevious sinking and boring had bean abandoned after being put down to the\ndepth of about 50 feet with no results. This had been done in the same\nfield I discovered the spring in at 20 feet deep. Qjqjjj\nHaving obtained the name and address of this gentleman, I wrote\nto him for particulars. He replies as follows :\u2014\n6, Brandling-park, Newcastle-on-Tyne,\nDecember 23rrf, 1896.\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th, with reference to Mr. Stone and his\n\" divining rod \" (whom I employed on my place in county Down, in 1895),\nbefore employing him I had quarried through 17 feet of granite for water\nwithout success. I then sent a man from Northumberland with proper\nappliances to bore through the granite, still hoping to find water. He\nworked for several months. In December, 1894, he reported to me that he\nhad found a good spring. In June, 1895, we had no water ; after a great deal\nof expense it had turned out a complete failure. In December, 1895, I sent\nfor Mr. Stone, and I must confess my faith in him was not very great at first,\nbut I was soon convinced he could point out where there was water. He did\nso on several places on my land, and on one spot where he said there was a\ngood spring, we started and quarried down some 20 feet in hard granite ; we\nfound a splendid spring and we have a great supply of water. Through all\nthe long drought last spring and summer, when most of the springs in the\nneighbourhood were dry, ours showed no signs of diminishing. Where Mr.\nStone found the spring was not near where we thought we had a spring ; in\nfact, I would never have looked for one in the place he pointed out.\nI have great confidence in Mr. Stone and his divining rod, and I am very\npleased to recommend him.

McKay.\nK\n\f130 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nI wrote again to enquire the exact depth of the unsuccessful boring\nnd of the successful well, and the locality. Mr. McKay replies :\u2014\nJanuary 3rd, 1897.\n(1) The depth of the old well quarried was 17 feet deep. We then bored\nthrough hard granite 29 feet, in all 44 feet. There is a lake a little distance\nfrom where the well was sunk. We were 6 feet 6 inches below the level of\nthis lake. We expected to have a good supply of water on account of this.\nThe depth we quarried where Mr. Stone pointed out was 23 feet, and we got\na good spring.\n(2) The locality where the land is situated is in South Down, between\nRathfriland and Castlewellan (about midway).

The place, Woodside, is on the north coast of the\nIsle of Wight, between Osborne and Hyde ; it is indicated on the\ngeological map of the district. Mr. Stone's account is as follows :\u2014\nWoodside, Wootton, Isle, of Wight.\nThe owners of this estate had never been able to obtain a supply of water,\nalthough they had gone to a great expense to try and find a supply. I was-\ntherefore sent for, and upon my arrival I cut a hazel rod and immediately\ncommenced to work. I had not been walking ten minutes before I discovered\nan enormous spring of water, and being convinced by the action of my rod\nthat there was an abundant supply for all purposes beneath the spot upon\nwhich I was standing, I did not trouble to test further. I was then asked\nat what depth I thought the water would be found. I said at about seven\nfeet. The agent said to me, \"Mr. Stone, there's a well over the fence there,\n80 feet deep and no water in it, and another well 30 feet deep, just behind\nyou and no water.\" I said, \"Never mind the old wells ; you will find an abun\ndant supply at the spot I indicate, at about seven feet deep.\" I was asked if I\nwould undertake to carry out the necessary work, and agreed to do so. I\nstarted two of my sinkers to dig at the spot I had marked, and they had not\nbeen at work a day before they struck the water, which rapidly rose to the\nsurface. I then laid on the water by gravitation to the mansion, garden,\nstables, etc., and after all was completed Dr. Morgan expressed himself\nentirely satisfied with everything I had done.\nMy first visit to the Isle of Wight was to a village called Arreton. Several\nattempt* had been made, at great expense, to obtain a water supply to this\nvillage without success, and upon my arrival I was told by the old men that I\nshould never find a spring of water in their neighbourhood. I said, \"Well,\nyou must wait and see,\" and I started to work with my rod in hand, and in a\nfew minutes I discovered a spot, beneath which a good supply of water was\nflowing, and all the company who were with me were astonished, and said\nthat was a spot they thought water would never be found at ; I, however,\nguaranteed a spring at 10 feet, and the work was entrusted' to me to\ncurry out, which I did, and my men tapped water at nine feet, which quickly\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 131\nrose to the top, and I laid it on to the rectory and village by gravitation. A\nwell had been sunk within 20 yards of this spot, to a depth of about\n50 feet, and not a drop of water was found.\nAn account of this case, I find, appeared in the Isle of Wight\npapers, and also, as follows, in The Morning Post for September 20th,\n1892 :\u2014\nNo little astonishment has been caused amongst the inhabitants of\nFishbourne and Wootton, Isle of Wight, by the successful use of the\ndivining rod. On the shore near Wootton Creek, overlooking the Solent, is\na yachting estate known as Woodside, the residence of the Rev. J. B.\nMorgan, which has hitherto been without a good supply of water. Two\nwells have been sunk at considerable expense, but without success. It was\nthereupon decided to call in the assistance of Mr. William Stone, a well-\nknown operator with the divining rod. On his arrival, Mr. Stone, after\ncutting his rod in the neighbouring coppice, set to work, and within ten\nminutes indicated a spot which every one seemed to consider the most\nunlikely on the estate. It was on the brow of the hill, and over 100 feet\nabove the house, whereas the wells had been previously sunk in low-lying\nland. Men were, however, quickly set to work, and at a depth of 7 feet the\nwater rushed into the well so fast that the men were obliged to get out, and\nthe water came to the top of the well. This spring has been found an ample\nsupply, and the quality is excellent. This is Mr. Stone's third visit to the\nIsland. On his first visit he discovered a spring at Arreton, which yields\nenough water to supply the wants of the village, and he subsequently found\nwater on another estate near Ityde.\nOn writing to Mr. Morgan for information, he replied to me as\nfollows :\u2014\n5, Avenue Montaigne, Paris, October 21st, 1896.\nI do not know the details of the account of Mr. Stone's work at Wood-\nside House, I. W.\u2014which has readied you,\u2014but it is quite true that he\ndiscovered an abundant supply of water where efforts had previously been\nmade in vain. J B MORGAn.\nI then sent Mr. Morgan the above particulars and he replies :\u2014\nParis, November 6th, 1896.\nThe account which you sent to me of Mr. Stone's work at Woodside is\nsuostantially correct. J B MoRgAn\nMr. Morgan, in answer to my request for further details, wrote\nto say Mr. Taylor, of Woodside, would be able to give me the\nfacts desired. I, therefore, wrote to Mr. Taylor, at the same time\nenclosing him a copy of Mr. Stone's statement, and asking him if it\nwere correct. Mr. Taylor returns Stone's statement, endorsed, \"Quite\ncorrect, William Taylor,'\" and also sent the following letter and plan\nof the respective position of the wells. It will be seen that \" quite\ncorrect \" does not apply to the relative depths of the wells.\n\f132 [part\nProfessor W. F.

The various replies to my enquiries show that, after making due\nallowance for occasional exaggeration, the accounts of the various cases\nMr. Stone has given me were substantially correct, and I have no\nreason to think it would be otherwise in the case of Arreton.\nSubsequently Mr. Stone sent me some fine photographs that had been\ntaken of the springs, one of which we reproduce (see next page), and\nwhich he describes as follows :\u2014\n[It] shows me standing by the spring of water I discovered for the\nKev. Mr. Morgan, Isle of Wight, and the rod I have in my hand shows me\nholding it just as I did when I tested for this valuable spring. The moment\nI put my foot over the water the rod turned in spite of me, broke itself, and\nleft the two ends between my fingers and thumb. I was photographed with\nthe same rod, but of course it was much shorter than when I first tested, as\nabout three inches from each end had been broken oft\". I always hold the\nrod in the position you see. The photograph is taken near the house, the\nwater from the spring having been \" laid on.\"\nNo. 91.\u2014The next case Mr. Stone sends me is an interesting one,\nbut unfortunately, owing to the death of the gentleman for whom the\nwork was undertaken, the account given is only imperfectly\ncorroborated.\nThe Hareby Estate, Spilsby, Lincolnshire.\nThis estate recently belonged to, and was occupied by, the late Mr. F.\nTooth ; it is now occupied by Mr. George Marriner. It comprises\nabout 1,000 acres of land, upon which is built a large mansion, several\ncottages,\u2014forming the village,\u2014farm premises and a church. No water was\nobtainable here, only by two water carts, continually being used to fetch\nwater from a distance. In addition to the mansion, cottages, farm buildings\netc., the cattle had to be supplied with water. In this case numerous well\nsinkers had been called in and they all failed. Hearing of me Mr. Tooth\nvisited mo when I was engaged carrying out some extensive work, and\nhaving satisfied himself, there and then specially engaged me for his estate.\nOn my arrival there I found five wells had been sunk, from which no water\nwas obtainable. I tested with my divining rod, and near one of these wells,\nI discovered a spring of water, at a less depth by some 80 feet ; this was only\nwithin a few yards of one of the previous sinkings. When I discovered\nthis spring, I guaranteed to bring the water to the surface and above it. Let\nme say at once that that spring now delivers itself into a reservoir rising four\nfeet above the ground, and when tested was yielding 24,000 gallons per 24\nhours ; this same spring is now supplying the whole of the wants of the\nabove named mansion, village, farm buildings, etc.\n\fiUL- W. STONE.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 135\nIn connection with this, Mr. Tooth, since deceased, wrote to Mr.\nStone as follows :\u2014\nHareby, Spilsby, Lincolnshire, June 12th, 1893.\nI am greatly pleased with the result of your discovery of springs by the\n\" divining rod \" on this farm in October last, and by the practical way you\nhave since carried out the necessary works.\nI have hitherto had great difficulty in keeping my stock supplied with\nwater during the winter months, while in the yards, let alone the cost of\nleading ; now I am pleased to witness a constant supply, which has begun at\nabout 17,000 gallons per twenty-four hours, of clear, pure, spring water ; an\nadvantage to a stock farm that cannot be too highly estimated. I shall be\npleased to answer any inquiry upon the subject ; meanwhile the drainage\nwork to my grass fields will have your attention.\nFrederick Tooth.\nI wrote to the present occupier of the farm, Mr. Marriner, and his\nreply is as follows :\u2014\nHareby, Spilsby, January 13th, 1897.\nThe water discovered on the Hareby estate has proved most satisfactory,\nand I can faithfully substantiate the late Mr. Tooth's testimonial, for the\nwater discovered by Mr. Stone has proved abundant all through last summer,\nwhich as you know was exceptionally dry.\nG. T. Marriner.\nIn reply to further enquiries from me, Mr. Marriner writes :\u2014\nHareby, Spilsby, January 20th, 1897.\nIn answer to your first question : Was a well or wells sunk prior to the\ndiviner's visit, and if so with what result and at what place ?\nOnly one new well had been sunk by Mr. Tooth, and that one proved a\nfailure ; he had sunk 28 feet. Mr. Stone then commenced operations and said\nthere was water three yards away, and he sank 15 feet and found plenty of\nwater ; this well is some distance from the house and buildings and simply\nsupplies a tank in the field for stock. There are several old wells about the\nplace which Mr. Tooth had opened into, but from information learned from\npresent foreman, who was here before Mr. Tooth came into possession, I\ngather that the above well was the only one sunk by him.\nSecond question : How deep were the useless wells, and how deep the\nwell or wells successfully sunk by Mr. Stone, and how far apart ?\nOne old well is 80 feet deep. The well sunk by Mr. S., which supplies\nhouse and buildings, is near one which supplied same before Mr. Stone did\nanything, but which used to run dry in summer. The well sunk by Mr.\nStone was only seven feet deep ; it proved and has all along proved, a never-\nfailing supply ; the water here rises to the surface, and is conveyed into three\ncircular reservoirs.\nI myself think that Mr. Stone could very well do without the \"divining\nrod,\" it being simply a visible sign of the effect which water has upon his\nbody.\nG.

[part\nWriting again in explanation of the difference between Mr. Stone's\nstatement and the foregoing letter, to which I called his attention,\nMr. Marriner says, \" I am afraid my last letter was misleading, as I\nunderstood from the foreman only two wells had been sunk ; he now\ntells me that several others were dug before Mr. Stone's visit ; our\nwater supply now never gives us any trouble.\"\nI sent the proof-sheets of the above, with Mr. Stone's statement, to\nMr. Marriner for revision. In his reply Mr. Marriner states that\nfurther careful enquiry led him to make one or two slight corrections\nin his letter of January 20th, which I have incorporated, and he\nadds :\u2014\" I find eight wells had actually been sunk on this place prior to\nMr. Stone's visit, but no satisfactory water supply was got until Mr.\nStone came. Three or four of these wells had been dug by Mr. Tooth\nand filled in again. Stone discovered a spring at 15 feet below the\nsurface, only three yards from the useless well sunk to 28 feet by Mr.\nTooth, as shown by Mr. Tooth's letter, a copy of which I enclose.\"\nThe letter enclosed is from Mr. Tooth to his agent, Mr. Parish, dated\nOctober 23rd, 1893, and corroborates Mr. Marriner's statement.

I was called in and tested with my divining rod. I found\na spring from six to eight feet from the well. I suggested I should send\nsome of my skilled men and that they should cut a drift from the side of the\nwell in the direction of the spring. My suggestion was adopted ; the men\ncut the drift and immediately the spring was tapped it commenced to flow\ninto the well and the supply was and is sufficient (and amply so) for all the\npurposes of brewery, etc. I have heard nothing from Mr. Carmichael, the\nmanager's director, lately, but he would, no doubt, furnish you with the\nplain facts of the case.\nI wrote to the managing director, Mr. Carmichael, enclosing the\nforegoing account, and he replies as follows : \u2014\nBlyth, Northumberland, Februury 16th, 1897.\nIn reply to yours of the 12th inst., I have to say that what Mr. Stone has\ninformed you about his work here is practically correct.\nThe date when the work was done was in May, 1894. The site was\nin the brewery yard. Depth of old well 24 feet ; it was by no means\nuseless, as we had a regular supply of water, although small. The well is\nnow 28 feet deep, and tho supply is what I would call fairly good but not\nlarge.\nThe place in the rock where Mr. Stone found the spring would be about\n6 feet from the bottom of the old well in a drift which had previously been\nmade by us ; this was where we were getting the water from, and when the\nrock was cut away it so relieved the spring as to give us a much larger\nquantity and a quicker supply.\nJames Carmichael.\nIn subsequent correspondence with me, Mr. Stone remarks that\nhe thinks Mr. Carmichael's recollection of the facts is not quite as\nfavourable as the case deserves, and mentions some additional\nparticulars. I forwarded Mr. Stone's remarks to Mr. Carmichael, who\nreplies that, though Mr. Stone's recollection of certain particulars is\nnot quite accurate, yet \"both I and my co-directors were very pleased\nto get the increased supply.\"\nNo. 93.\u2014The Lincolnshire Chronicle of November 7th, 1896,\ndescribes some experiments in water-finding by Mr. Stone in front of\nthe Sessions House at Spilsby ; at a certain spot the \"little twig\nwhich had been held horizontally, rose perpendicularly and curled\ntowards the operator.\" Digging was commenced, and at 15 feet a\ncopious supply of water was met with. I wrote to the magistrate s\nclerk at Spilsby\u2014Mr. Thimbleby, a solicitor,\u2014to enquire whether\nprevious attempts to find water near the Sessions House had been\n\f138 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nmade without the dowser's aid, and with what result. But this\n,question Mr. Thimbleby does not answer ; he replies :\u2014\nMagistrates' Clerk's Office, Spilsby, January 9th, 1897.\nMr. Stone's power to find water is something marvellous. \" The only\ninstrument he uses is a branch of hazel or willow. He can tell at once\nwhere the water is, and approximately the distance to bore. I saw Mr.\nStone \"divine \" for water at the Sessions House at Spilsby with great success,\nand his prediction of depth, namely 15 feet, was exact. I have seen what\nhe has done at Hareby on the estate of Mr. Tooth and he was most successful.\nHe found water at Newcastle for a laundry company on a space between two\ndisused coal pits. Every one thought he was mad when he stated that there\nwould be water, as each of the pits showed no signs of the presence of water,\nbut by the aid of his rod he struck a spring which has supplied the laundry\n\u2022company at a saving, I believe, of some \u00a3500 or \u00a3000 a year. i\nThos.

I have had some correspondence with the\nLaundry Company referred to and obtained full particulars from them,\nthough the facts named by Mr. Thimbleby are not mentioned ; possibly\nJie was mistaken.\nA long account of the Newcastle experiments was given in the\nNewcastle Daily Leader for April 12th, 1894. The reporter minutely\ndescribes Mr. Stone's appearance and mode of using the rod, \" merely\na small V-shaped branch of a sapling, the legs not more than nine\ninches long and the sixth of an inch thick,\"\u2014and how it rose up and\npointed to the dowser's chin whenever \" he had struck water.\" The\npositions were marked and then trials were made at the Moor Edge\nLaundry, where a spot was marked as likely to yield a large supply\n\" about 50 feet below.\" The reporter states that \" the keenest\nscrutiny could not see a persuasive movement of his [the dowser's]\nfingers.\"- Then other persons tried their hands but the rod \"would\nnot rise, not even for a reporter.\" The dowser's hands were swollen\nby the strain, the report adds.\nThe Newcastle Daily Journal gives a very similar account, and in\nits issue of May 17th, 1891, states that after digging a well a powerful\nspring was struck at only 15 or 16 feet deep, at the precise spot\nmarked by Mr. Stone.\ni The secretary of the Laundry Co. (see next case) informs mc this should be \u00a350\nor \u00a300 a year.\u2014W. F. B.\n2 To this statement one of the directors of the Laundry Co., Mr. R. J.

No previous attempts had been made to find water within my\nknowledge.\n(2.) The well we sunk at the identical spot marked by Mr. Stone and\n,only went 15 feet deep.\nPersonally, I consider the extract from Daily Leader a very true report\n-of all that took place.\nPerhaps another instance may be of interest to you :\u2014\nSome little time after the experiment at our works I was invited to meet\nMr. Stone whilst he tried the ground at a brewery here. After indicating\n\u2022one spot inside the building where water would be found, he was conducted\nover some adjacent property and stopping short at a spot some 50 yards off,\nhe indicated another find. The principal of the brewery then stated to Mr.\nStone that the ground he was upon was not theirs, but that he had conducted\nhim thither to test him, adding that \"the ground you are now on is the\n-exact spot where an old public well was closed by the Newcastle Corporation\nyears ago, owing to the unfitness of the water for drinking purposes.\"\nI should add that Mr. Stone was a perfect stranger to this part of\nNewcastle and I cannot see that he could possibly have known of the\n,existence of this old well. yy Bird\nThe description given by Mr. Bird, in the latter part of his letter,\n\u2022appears to refer to the incident already mentioned in No. 85.\nIn the beautifully illustrated pamphlet issued by this Laundry\n,Company, there is a reproduction of a photograph taken of Mr. Stone\nin the act of discovering the spring which now supplies this laundry ;\nthe picture, which we have to thank the directors for allowing us to\nreproduce (see next page), is prefaced by the remark :\u2014\nAn important item in Laundry-work is to get pure water and plenty of it.\nAn abundant supply, fulfilling its requirements, we are pleased to say, has\nbeen found on the premises at the spot indicated by Mr. Stone. It will be\nnoticed in the photograph that the rod is pointing upwards, indicating the\npresence of water below.\ni This letter, from Mr. Charleton, will be quoted later on, as alreadv stated.\u2014\nW.

Mr. Stanton,\nMB. w. STOnE.\na contractor, gives several instances of Stone's success. Here is one in\na letter addressed to Mr. Stone :\u2014\nGeddington, near Kettering, October, 1891.\nI have sunk the well on Acroland Farm, where you found the spring, and\ngot a good supply of pure water at 54 feet. This is a great success, as there\nhave already been three wells sunk and no good water. In fact there never\nhas been any good water on the farm before. All the old men on the place\nsaid there would not be this time. Akthuk Stanton\n\fxxxn.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 141\nIn answer to my enquiries, Mr. Stanton writes :\u2014\nGeddington, Kettering, March 20th, 1897.\nAcreland farm in about half way between Geddington and Grafton-under-\nwood, by the roadside ; the old wells were about 20 feet deep, the new one\nsunk was about 80 feet [distance] from one of thi old ones which I filled\nup ; one is in use now for the cattle, and the other was filled up some\nyears ago.\nI have also sunk wells after four men using the divining rod, but most\nafter Mr. Stone and Mr. Mullins. In every case I found water, but in some\ncases a very short supply where the springs were shallow. At Barnwell\nCastle where I sunk a well, after Mr. Stone's trial, in a field for the use of\ncattle, I found a stiong spring about four feet below the surface. At Burton\nLatimer 1 deepened an old well 40 feet, which was 35 feet before, making the\ntotal depth 75 feet. I came across the spring exactly in the line as Mr.\nStone indicated. . \u201e\nArthur Stanton.\nMr. Stanton's reply shows the importance of ascertaining the\nrelative depth of the old and new wells. It appears that at Acreland\nthe old wells were \"about 20 feet\" deep and the new one 54 feet, and\nas there is no evidence to show water might not bo found anywhere in\nthis locality at 50 or 60 feet deep, the case ceases to be of the evidential\nvalue it first appeared.\nNo. 96.\u2014Having heard that attempts to find water had been made\nunsuccessfully at the Oakworth Mills, Keighley, Yorks., prior to the\nuse of the rod and that Stone had found an abundant supply, I wrote\nto Messrs. Haggas and Co., the owners of the Mills, and the following\nis the reply of the managing director :\u2014\nOakworth Mills, Keighley, March 24th, 1897.\nIn reply to your questions : 1. We have made attempts to get water\npreviously by boring without success. 2. We bored 50 feet without finding\nwater in one place, and 60 feet in another, about two years ago.\nRecently Mr. Stone has had men sinking on places indicated by himself\nwith the following results :\u2014\n(1) A well sunk 10 feet and found water to fill a half-inch pipe.\n(2) A well sunk 14 feet and found a small supply, fill perhaps quarter-\ninch pipe.\n(3) A horizontal drift into a hill perhaps 25 to 30 yards long, and 25 feet\ndeep at far end, yielding water about equal to a one inch to one and a-half\ninch pipe.\n(4) A well sunk about 25 feet ; the water rose to within 10 feet of\ntop, and then ran off. This will necessitate our drifting the water off at\n10 feet down.\n(5) A well 30 feet deep without result, and we have abandoned this, as\nwe think we have got the underground stream in about 100 yards distant (6),\nwhere at a depth of 18 feet we have got a strong run, perhaps 250 to 300\n\f142 [part\nProfessor W.

Vint, Direttor.\nNo. 97.\u2014The Liverpool, Daily Post of March 12th, 1897, has the\nfollowing. Holywell is in North Wales, Penymaes is a village near\nHolywell.\nA remarkable instance of the finding of water by means of the divining\nor \"dowsing\" rod has just occurred at Holywell. The governors of the-\nintermediate school now in course of erection at Penymaes were desirous of\nobtaining a supply of water, and with that end in view sank a well, but\nalthough the excavation reached a very considerable depth and was a very\nexpensive undertaking, there was not the slightest trace of water. In their\ndifficulty the governors decided to employ a \" water finder,\" and Mr.\nWilliam Stone, of Spilsby, Lincolnshire, was consulted. He duly appeared\nupon the scene, and, having procured the usual hazel twig, went with it over\nthe grounds of the school, and ultimately indicated a spot where water would\nbe found. On this spot accordingly a borehole was made, and at a depth of\nabout twenty feet an abundant supply of water was discovered, and yesterday\nthere were fourteen feet of water in the hole, with every indication of a\nsplendid supply.\nA very similar report was also published in many other Lancashire\nand Welsh papers. I wrote to the governors of the school at Penymaes,\nbut received no reply. I then wrote to the solicitor to the board of\ngovernors (whose name I obtained from Mr. Stone), who had engaged\nMr. Stone and again had no reply. Hearing that Mr. S. K. Muspratt,\nGrove Park, Liverpool, was chairman of the board of governors of the\nschool, I asked my friend, Professor Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., if he would\nkindly make enquiries. Professor Lodge had an interview with Mr.\nMuspratt, who is also mayor of Flint, and forwards me the following\nnotes of Mr. Muspratt's replies to his enquiries.\n\" The newspaper account is correct, except that they had not\npreviously sunk for water (an important exception). But there is not.\na full supply of water yet. The dowser asserted a depth of 70 to 100\nfeet, and the boring is going on and has reached 45 feet about at\npresent. No previous boring was made, but advice from local men and\nothers was got, and not being very satisfactory, was not acted on.\n\" The. general impression, however, is that there is a good deal of\nwater about Holywell altogether. The dowser indicated four springs,\nand on one of these spots the boring is being made and seems likely to\nbe successful. There is no supply to the town, except surface water.\nThe town and school are near top of the hill.\"\u2014O.J.L.\n\fxxxii ] On the So-called Divining Rod. US\nHere I may remark by way of caution that newspaper paragraphs\non behalf of the success of any particular professional dowser are\noften mere paid advertisements of the man ; so that little value should\nbe attached to them until corroborated by independent testimony.\nThe rivalry of the professional dowsers and the network of corre\nspondents who are in communication with me from all parts of England,\nenables me to hear offailures as well as successes in the use of the rod.\nIn fact, it is my practice specially to ask for information as to any\nfailures. One correspondent gave me a list of three or four failures\nStone had made. I wrote to each of the persons concerned. One or\ntwo appear to be failures, and are given in the list of \" failures \"\nbelow, whereas another writes that, though he does not like Stone\npersonally, he would certainly employ him again if he wanted to find\nwater elsewhere on his estate.\nNo. 98.\u2014Again, another of these reported failures turns out to\nhave been more or less a success, and brought the following letter :\u2014\nConheath, Bellingham, March 24th, 1897.\nThere is not the slightest doubt of his (Mr. Stone's) powers to find water;\nthe only objection I have to him is that his rod is too susceptible and finds\nwater in too small quantities to he of practical value in all cases ; although\nin justice to him it is only right to say that when I had him the weather had\nbeen extremely wet, so that at the time small springs were running abun\ndantly.\nHe gave one remarkable instance while sitting in the room at an inn with\na piece of steel in his hand ; he said, \" there is water here,\" and on taking\nthe hazel twig and walking round the room he indicated the spot where it\ncould be found. An old man in the room at the time then spoke up and\ninformed the company that he could remember a former tenant of the place\nhaving a well in the cellar below the room where we were sitting.\nIt. Riddle.\nIn reply to my further enquiries, Mr. Riddle writes : \u2014\nConheath, Bellingham, March 29th, 1897.\nThe incident of Stone finding the water in the inn is quite correct, and\nthere was no possibility of him getting any previous knowledge, as I met him\nat the place and was in his presence during the whole time. Another\nincident of the same nature occurred in one of the fields, where he indicated\na supply of water which had been drained away at some time, and no\nindication of such was visible ; another old resident that I had with us to\nmark the places called out, \"I believe in him now, I have carried water from\nthis place when I was a boy. \"\nThe scheme [of well sinking] was not carried out properly ; the part that\nwas done was at my own expense, and as the other proprietors did not join\nwith me in going to a source where I have every confidence plenty of water\ncould be found, I, of course, gave the thing up.\nRobt. Riddle.\n\f144 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nIn reference to this case Mr. Stone says, \" the ratepayers com\nplained that the sinking was not done skilfully, which is the usual\ncause of these so-called failures.\"\nIn the case of another failure of Stone's that was mentioned to me,\nI could get no reply to my repeated enquiries addressed to the\ngentleman named ; but from other enquiries I have made it appears\nthat in this case a supply of water was obtained, only not of the\nvolume, nor at the depth anticipated.\nF. 5.i\u2014The next letter, however, records a more distinct failure.\nMr. Hodgson writes to me as follows :\u2014\nRedesdale Cottage, Otterburn, Northumberland,\nMarch 24th, 1897.\nI have yours of the 23rd inst., respecting Mr. Stone. He made a good\nmany tests for me, and on one estate I followed up three of them, and\nin each instance got a good supply of water, though generally at a greater\ndepth than that named by Mr. Stone.\nI tried two places on another estate, at each of which Mr. Stone said I\nshould get water at about 4o feet. I sunk a well of about 5 feet in diameter\nto over 50 foet in depth in each case. I then bored from the bottom of the\nwell- in one case over 100 feet, and in the other about 70 feet, and never\ngot a drop of water in either of them. When \"divining\" Mr. Stone\npronounced the last mentioned to be the best and strongest spring he had\nfound in Northumberland. After the two trials above referred to, I lost\nfaith in Mr. Stone, and several other places which I have marked out remain\nuntried. William Hodgson.\nI sent the preceding letter to Mr. Stone and asked what he had to\nsay to it. He replied that the well sinking and boring was not done\nby him, that the work was badly carried out, and he was in no way\nresponsible for the failure. I sent Mr. Hodgson Stone's explanation,\nand he replies as follows :\u2014\nOtterburn, Northumberland, March 20lh, 1897.\nI tried by boring at one place, and went deeper than Mr. Stone said,\nhut did not get sufficient water to be of any use. This boring, I must say,\nwas not very satisfactorily conducted, as it was done for me gratuitously,\nand I could not have the same command of the men as I should have had if\nthey had been employed and paid by myself. William Hodoson.\nIt will be noticed that Mr. Hodgson now speaks of boring at one\nplace, and getting some water. I do not understand the discrepancy\nhetween his two letters. Mr. Hodgson adds that Stone was a\ncomplete failure at Otterburn. On the other hand Mr. Reynard, a\ngentleman who formerly resided at Otterburn, states that it was\nowing to Stone's success which he witnessed in that town, that he\ni The numbering, \"F. 5, etc.,\" is continued from p. 123.\n\fXXXII.] 145\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nrecommended his employment elsewhere. Without attempting to\nreconcile these different points of view, it is sufficiently clear that,\neven after wide enquiry, and making allowance for cases that have not\nreached me, the ratio of Stone's failures to his successes is a very small\nfraction.i For here, as elsewhere, it must be borne in mind that, whilst\nall the failures I have been able to substantiate are cited, only such\nsuccesses are given as are needful for the main object of this\ninvestigation.\nGroup VI.\u2014Mr. B. Tompkins.\nThe next group of cases relates to Mr. B. Tompkins, of Pipsmore\nFarm, Chippenham, Wilts, whose experience as a professional dowser\nonly extends from 1890. Prior to that time Mr. Tompkins was a\ntenant farmer, and gives me the following account of how he discovered\nhis dowsing power.\nOn his farm he had been to some expense in trying to obtain a\ngood supply of water for his cattle and at last was advised to send for\nMullins and get the aid of the divining rod. This he did ; Mullins\ncame and found a spot where he said a plentiful supply of water\nexisted at a depth of less than 30 feet. A well was sunk and at\n15 feet deep a strong spring was tapped, which has yielded an unfailing\nsupply ever since. After Mullins left Tompkins tried his own skill,\nand found the forked twig also moved in his hand. He traversed\nanother part of his land, and found three spots where the twig turned\nvigorously. Mullins was asked subsequently to try the same ground ;\nhe came during Tompkins' absence from home, tried over the place, and\nfixed on the same spots that Tompkins had found, and privately marked,\nunknown to Mullins. This led the former to test his own powers in\nother ways, and, having gained confidence, he was asked by Messrs.\nSmith and Marshall, of Chippenham, the agents to the late Lord\nMethuen, to try if he could find a spring on Lord Methuen's estate, as\na well already sunk had proved useless. Mi. Tompkins tried, and after\na long search the rod moved at a certain spot on a hillside, where he\npredicted a good supply of water would be found. A well was sunk,\ni Albeit one correspondent holds a very poor opinion both of Stone's success and\nof his veracity ; but there appear to be extraneous personal reasons for this opinion.\nI have never seen Stone : judging only from the evidence before me, he certainly\noeems one of the best dowsers now living.\nL\n\f146 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nby blasting through 9 feet of solid rock, and at 18 feet a spring was\nstruck, which rose some 9 or 10 feet in the well. Messrs. Smith and\nMarshall afterwards wrote as follows to Mr. Tompkins :\u2014\nChippenham, Wilts, and 7, Whitehall Place, London,\nNovember 24i\/i, 1891.\nThe decision you arrived at was perfectly correct, and it is our opinion\nthat if we had made the well six feet either way to the right or left of\nthe spot you marked, we should have missed the water, which is now\nabundant.\nSmith and Marshall.\nI wrote to Messrs. Smith and Marshall, sending them a proof of\nthe foregoing paragraph and letter, and begged them to make\nany corrections that were necessary. They replied from Chippenham\nthat \" the statements in the proof are perfectly correct,\" both as\nregards their own letter and the facts mentioned in the preceding\nparagraph.\nNo. 99.\u2014Mr. Charles Maggs, who is a Wiltshire county magis\ntrate, and proprietor of the Melksham Dairy Company, required a\nlarge supply of pure water for his butter factory, and, after ineffectual\nattempts to obtain it, wrote to Mr. Tompkins to come over and try the\ndivining rod. This was done, and subsequently Mr. Maggs writes to\nMr. Tompkins as follows :\u2014\nMelksham Dairy Company, November 10th, 1890.\nWe found water at 30 feet, as stated by you at time of finding the spring\n\u2014 a very strong spring. Our hopes had almost gone and faith was all but\nspent. I have written an article thereon in the Wiltshire Times.\nCharles Magqs.\nThe following is an extract from the article Mr. Maggs refers\nto :\u2014\nProof positive of the efficacy of the divining rod has been recently\nsupplied in this town for water in the paddock in the rear of Mr. Charles\nMaggs' Butter Factory. To obtain a good supply of cold water for the dairy,\na well had been sunk in close proximity to the buildings ; but after going\ndown 21 feet and boring a further 18 feet, no water of any consequence was\nmet with. This led Mr. Maggs to request Mr. B. Tompkins, of Chippenham,\nto come over to ascertain if water was present in the field. After considerable\nsearch, the twig began to rise, and the upward movement was so strong that\nthe rod bent considerably in its frantic endeavour to turn over, which it at\nonce did on coming over the spring head, and broke. Sinking operations\nwere shortly commenced ; but the faith of the workers, after going down 25\nfeet without any results, was well nigh gone. However, they were instructed\nto continue, and on reaching a depth of 30 feet, the axe \" pricked \" the\n\fXXXII.] 147\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nspring, and up came the water straight in a column (if about 9 inch circum\nference with great force. It continues to rise, and Mr. Maggs has now a\ngood supply of cold spring water, which rises to within three feet of the\nsurface level and as fast as the powerful centrifugal pumps carry it away to\nthe Dairy ; during the extreme drought of 1893 this spring has stood the\ntest and yielded a plentiful supply for our use.\nMR. B. TOMPKInS.\nI wrote to Mr. Maggs, and had the following interesting letter ire\nreply :\u2014\nBowerhill Lodge, Melksham, March 8th, 1897.\nBriefly the facts are :\u2014\nI sunk a well to find water for my dairy, and found none. Then I wrote\nto Mr. Tompkins, who came the following day ; he cut a forked stick out of\n\f148 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nthe hedge, and having placed it over the well, said, \" There is no water here,\"\nbut found a slight spring within 10 feet, too small to be of any service,\nhe reported. He walked all over the field, and said he had not come across\nany spring at all. However, in the extreme corner of the field a bunch of\nnettles was growing, and he entered this, and instantly exclaimed, \"Here it\nis ; and a good head of water, too ! Not running away, but just ready for\ntapping, and as soon as you strike it, it will come surging up.\" \"How\ndeep?\" \"Not over 25 feet.\" He cut out a turf to indicate the spot, and\nwe commenced sinking next day. The person employed was an old well\nsinker, and he came to me two or three times whilst engaged in sinking,\nshowing specimens of the soil or marl, assuring me there never was water\nwhere such existed, and it was worse than useless to go further. I told him\nto go on if he had to get to New Zealand\u2014it was my money, and he need not\nregard me nor my pocket. When he had gone about 22 feet, his pickaxe\ntapped the spring and the water came up like a fountain, and at such a rate\nhe feared ho should be drowned before he could get pulled up\u2014his mates\nbeing away ! The water rose rapidly to within twelve or fifteen inches of the\nsurface. We put on pumps and kept the water down whilst he went a little\ndeeper, but the rush of water was such that we had to desist going lower.\nSince then we have had a splendid supply. This was the beginning of his\n[Mr. Tompkins'] public career, and since then he has found water in several\nEnglish counties, and has been doing like work in the African Bush, also\nwith equal success. Cras Maqgs\nNo. 100.\u2014Following the preceding case, the local newspapers give\nan account of Mr. Tompkins' success in finding a strong spring on the\nestate of Sir Gabriel Goldney, Bart., at Bradenstoke Abbey, Wiltshire.\nHaving heard that the agent to Sir Gabriel' Goldney could give some\nevidence bearing on our subject, I wrote to Mr. H. B. Napier, the\nagent, who replies as follows :\u2014\nChippenham, Wilts, May Uth, 1896.\nIn reply to yours of the 6th inst, on the subject of water finding or\n\" dowsing,\" as we call it :\u2014\nI have employed Mr. Tompkins on several occasions, and up till now he\ncertainly has not been at fault, except in his estimate of the depth of the\nspring. Undoubtedly there is a great deal of humbug about the practice of\nthese water finders, but at the same time I am satisfied that they have the\npower of detecting a spring, but I am driven to the opinion that beyond this\ntheir powers do not extend.i I remember an interesting case where Mr.\nTompkins traced gold. When the Bath and West of England Show was held\nat Gloucester some years ago, a sovereign was lost under the board floor in\nthe Finance Office. The members of the Council did not themselves know\nexactly where to find it, and sent for Mr. Tompkins, who indicated a parti\ncular spot on the floor, and on a carpenter being sent for, the sovereign was\nfound to be immediately beneath the spot. In conclusion I may say that I\ni Mr. Napier probably means that their powers do not extend to finding the depth\n:tnd volume of water.\u2014W. F.

I am dis\nposed, however, to consider it merely a chance coincidence. It is true Mr.\nTompkins gives a detailed account of his finding concealed coins on\nother occasions ; see pages 16 and 17 of a little book on the \"Theory of\nwater finding\" which he has published.i Here, however, the persons\npresent knew where the coins were hidden : the experiment narrated\nby Mr. Napier is much less common and the result probably due to\nthe cause I have assigned.\nNo. 101.\u2014Mr. Cowper Coles, who is agent to the Duke of Beaufort\nand Sir Joseph Bailey, at Crickhowell, near Abergavenny, informed\nme in May, 1896, that he was sinking two wells at spots where Mr.\nTompkins predicted water would be found, and would send me the\nresult when the work was complete. Writing a few months later, Mr.\nColes tells me the result in both cases was successful. I wrote to ask\nin either case had prior attempts to find water been made, and with\nwhat result. Mr. Coles replies :\u2014\nPenmyarth, Crickhowell, September 19th, 1896.\nIn the case of Penprisk, Crickhowell, two wells had previously been\nsunk ; both were failures. Tompkins said water would be found at a certain\nspot at about 100 feet deep. After going through 98 feet of rock we came on\na gravel bed, and partly lost the water ; we are going deeper now into the\nnext rock. The rock is a very hard stone.\nThe other case, at Easton Court, near Tenbury, no prior attempt to find\nwater had been made. The rock here is sandstone. The well was sunk 50\nfeet, and is doing well. We are now pumping with a windmill.\nI am sinking several other wells now under Tompkins' guidance, and\nbelieve in the man. S H CowPEll CoLES.\nI wrote to Mr. Cowper Coles again this year to ask whether they\nhad yet sunk deeper at Penprisk. Mr. Coles replies, under date\ni Like all the other pamphlets and book'ets issued by the various professional\ndowsers, this is simply a traHe advertisement of Mr. Tompkins, and is not so remark\nable a collection of testimonials as some others of the same kind. The late Mr.\nMullins' little Ixiok, e.y., is far more striking, and contains numerous instances of his\nsuccess which I have not quoted in Group IV. On asking Mr. Tompkins what his\n\" theory\" was, for it is not mentioned in his brochure, he replies, much as I expected,\nas follows :\u2014\"My theory is, it is the action of the water naturally which produces\nelectricity and magnetism in the body; this acts upon the twig, which serves to indicate\nthe presence of water, and the greater the strength, the stronger is the pressure on the\noperator, who is of a sensitive nature.\" ! !\n\f150 [part\nProfessor W.

The letter is quoted from Mr. Tompkins' list of testimonials.\nLlanvair Grange, Abergavenny ; Aug'ut 29th, 1893.\nFor the last four months I have been almost without water (and in con\nsequence could not have my family home), and I now find that my prede\ncessors were short every summer. Having ascertained from Mr. Tompkins\nhis fees, I wired for him to come, and met him at the station myself, so as to\nprevent him speaking to anybody who knew my place. He at once started\nwork, cutting a V-shaped twig from a white thorn in the garden. He soon\ncame on a stratum of water, and. following it up through my smoking-room,\neventually came on the spring at a distance of 80 yards from the house. As\nmy readers may imagine, I did not believe him, and told him I wanted to\nsee the water. He immediately offered to sink the well on the condition of\nno water, no pay, which offer I closed with. After arranging terms, which\nwere the ordinary well-sinking charges, phm the fee for finding the water, he\nstarted sinking the well, and at a depth of 14 feet struck a very strong\nspring\u2014so strong that it was impossible to sink deeper than 18 feet, as no\npump was able to keep the water down so that the men could work. Since\nthen I have connected my engine, etc., to the well, and I am glad to say\nthat I now have an abundance of water, and I find it impossible to lower\nthe well more than 2 feet 6 inches. The water never rises more than 5 feet at\nthe most. Codrington Crawshay.\nI wrote to Mr. Crawshay to ask if he had sunk any wells unsuc\ncessfully prior to Mr. Tompkins' visit ; Mrs. Crawshay replies to me\nfrom Llanvair Grange, under date of February 10th, 1896, that her\nhusband was at the Cape, but she believes that no previous attempt to\nfind water had been made by them. Mrs. Crawshay kindly sends me\nher own recollection as to the particulars of Mr. Tompkins' visit, which\ncoincides with the facts stated above. Mrs. Crawshay adds that Mr.\nTompkins has been most successful elsewhere, but \" he is not always\ncorrect as to the probable depth of the spring; he said we should have to\nsink between 30 and 40 feet, and instead of that it was only 14 feet.\"\nI wrote again subsequently to Mr. Crawshay with reference to the\nincident mentioned by Mr. Harben at the end of the \" Horsham\nExperiments,\" p. 121, and enclosed the printed account of what is\nthere said. Mr. Crawshay replies :\u2014\nLlanvair Grange, Abergavenny, May 2oth, 1897.\nMr. B. Tompkins, of Chippenham, Wilts, was the water-finder I\nemployed, and I can't speak too highly of the work he did for me. He came\nhere a perfect stranger, and after casting round with his twig he came on a\n\fxxxit.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 151\nstratum of water, which he eventually ran to ground under our kitchen. This\nafterwards proved to be true, as the following November the spring\nburst through the floor, and nearly flooded us out, and I had to cut a drain\nto run the water off. He, after having found the above stratum, carried the\nline through the house, and found the heart of the spring about 80 yards\naway. At his advice, we sank the well, and at a depth of 14 feet came on\nwater in marly rock, and on driving the crow bar through, we came on a\nspring, enough to supply a large town. We had the greatest difficulty in\nsinking the well to a depth of 23 feet, which we eventually did. From that\nday to this we have had a most abundant supply of water, and although I\nhave an engine, I don't think we can pump the well out, as the water comes\nin with a regular stream.\nOne of the curious things in sinking the well was, at a depth of 12 feet,\nwe came across several green frogs in the marl, and as soon as they were\nexposed to the air they turned black and died.\nI see by the paper you enclosed me that Mullins is the name mentioned\nas having found the water in the dining-room ; I don't know anything about\nthis, but the facts I have told you happened under my own eyes. Captain\nMcCalmont, M.P., has an estate about 25 miles from me. Any other\ninformation that I may have I shall be only too pleased to give you.\nCODRInUTOn CEAWSHAY.\nIn a subsequent letter Mr. Crawshay writes in reply to mine :\u2014\nLlanvair Grange, Abergavenny, May 28th, 1897.\nPrior to Tompkins' visit we had a well sunk over 60 feet deep, which\nalways ran dry in the summer. Tompkins knew nothing about this well, nor\nits position : 20 yards from the old well he came on the stratum of water I\nhave previously described ; this led him to the spring where we sank the new\nwell. The depth of this well is only 23 feet, and it gives us, as I have aaid,\nan abundant and never-failing supply of excellent water.\nI am sure there are many people who, like myself, would greatly benefit\nif they only believed in water-finding by the so-called divining rod ; in fact,\n1 can never repay Tompkins for the service he did me at Llanvair. You are\nHuite at liberty to publish anything I have told you.\nCOdRIngTOn H. CkAWSHAV.\nNo. 103.\u2014 Another spring was found by Mr. Tompkins for the\nRector of Llanvair, under circumstances of considerable importance in\nconnection with the theory of the dowser's art, for the ground was\ncovered with snow at the time. This was the case also with the ex\nperiments recorded on page 83, No. 55, where the dowser was the late\nJ. Mullins. The Rev. W. J. C. Lindsay writes to me as follows :\u2014\nLlanvair Rectory, Abergavenny, September 7th, 1896.\nThe snow was on the ground when the \"diviner\" came here the first week\nin February, 1895. There was the usual walking over the grounds round the\nhouse, with the forked hazel rod in his hands, which occasionally gave an\nupward movement that, he said, indicated the presence of water. At last\nthe evolutions of the rod became so marked and vigorous, that it almost\n\f152 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nskinned the fingers of the holder, and he said a strong spring would be found\nhere. Thus was at a distance of some 250 yards from the house, and at an\nelevation rather above the level of the top of the house.\nA well was sunk and water found at a depth of 34 feet, the water rising\nto as high as 29 feet in the well. During all the dry weather we have had an\nabundant supply, and little pumping, as the cisterns are mostly filled by\ngravitation. W J c LlndSAY.\nIn reply to certain specific enquiries I made, Mr. Lindsay writes as\nfollows :\u2014\nLlanvair Rectory, Abergavenny, September 11th, 1896.\nMy gardener will give you answers to your questions. Mr. Crawshay's\nwell is about a mile and a-half from this. The diviner was anxious in my\ncase to find a good spring as near the house as possible, to save the expense\nof pipes to convey the water to the house. He knew nothing of the\nsurroundings, and made a diligent search all round, and found this splendid\nspring in a place where we should have never thought of looking for it.\nW. J. C. Lindsay.\nThe gardener's letter is as follows :\u2014\nAbergavenny, September 11th, 1896.\n(1) We had not tried to find water before Mr. Tompkins came. (2) It\nis therefore impossible for me to say whether a spring would be found\nanywhere on the grounds. (3) I am sure the diviner had no knowledge of\nthe place to guide him. (4) Mr. Crawshay's place is about two miles from\nhere, but I had not seen Mr. Tompkins before he came here.\nJames Hughes.\nNo. 104.\u2014Of more value, from an evidential point of view, is the\nfollowing letter, sent to me in reply to my enquiries. It is from the\nproprietor of the \" Western Counties' Creamery Company \" :\u2014\nMarston House, Marston Magna, Bath, May 28th, 1896.\nIn reply to yours, I beg to say that previous to Mr. Tompkins' visit I had\nsunk two wells, one 20 feet, and the other, plus boring, 50 feet, with the\nresult of only a very limited supply of water.\nAfter a careful search by Mr. Tompkins, he assured me he had found\na good spring at less than 30 feet. 1 agreed to let him sink the well,\nand at 18 feet he struck on a rock more than a foot thick, which, by the bye,\nwe had not found in the other two instances. The water came in so fast\nthat for several months I hoped I had sufficient, but some time after I found\nthe supply was not enough, and I was then induced by a friend to bore at\nthe bottom of Mr. Tompkins' well. This we did, and went down 130 feet, but\nthen came on salt water, and had to plug down the bore hole. I then\nconsulted some civil engineers, and they advised me to tunnel at the bottom\nof the 18 feet where Tompkins stopped. This I did ; and followed the\nsprings 10 feet each way, with (I am pleased to say) success. We now have\nplenty of water for factory, and I have just connected the well to the\nhouse besides. E_ Makden.\n\fXXXII.] 15*\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nIn reply to my enquiries as to the nature of Mr. Tompkins' search,\nand the position of the useless welh, Mr. Marden writes :\u2014\nMarston House, Marston Magna, Bath, June 1st, 1896.\nThe search by Mr. Tompkins was with the divining rod. The other two\ninstances were wells we had previously dug nearer the factory. Perhaps I\nshould add the first well was sunk as close as possible to the building for the\nconvenience of machinery, but we found no water. No. 2 is only 6 feet from\nNo. 1, and I dug down 25 feet with this ; I here bored at the bottom of it,\n25 feet more, making a total of 50 feet from surface. In neither of\nthese wells did we come across any material rock, and at the bottom of No. 1\nwe drove a pipe to connect the two wells for storage. Why I made the two\nwells so close together was on account of an amateur twig-man assuring me\nthat although there was no water in the first well, yet there was some within\n6 feet of it. This proved true, but when Mr. Tompkins (the expert) came\ndown, he informed me that the real spring was exactly under the engine.\nOf course it was not practical to sink there, so Tompkins started to find a\nspring elsewhere. After a search of about an hour he came upon No. 3,\nwhich, as before said, he told me was within 30 feet from the surface.\nTompkins sank No. 3 himself, and at 18 feet came upon a thick rock, and a\ngood supply of water.

Brani,.\n\f154 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nStatement Enelused.\n(1.) An uttempt was made to find water about 30 years ago. After sinking\nsome distance, air came into the well. This was then abandoned. After this\nanother attempt was made, and a well dug 167 feet deep, but no water was\nfound. This was given up.\n(2.) In 1893, Tompkins of Chippenham was engaged. The spot selected\nby him was 450 feet from the old well, the ground rising from 8 to 10 feet.\nHe went over the ground, tracing all the springs t,> one point, saying that\nwater would be found at a depth of 70 feet. We dug at the spot selected,\nand found indications of water at 70 feet, and struck the spring at 124 feet\nbelow the surface. We have since run a bore something like 20 feet, to\nobtain a better supply, but I do not think it has improved it.\n(3.) Site of well, Southdown Hills, in white chalk, with flints. When\nTompkins visited the place, he was taken over the old well, which was then\ncovered up, and according to him there was no spring in the old well, or\nanywhere near it.\nSome further particulars of the case (2) were given at the time by\nMr. Pickard, the steward of the estate, in the following letter addressed\nto Mr. Tompkins :\u2014\nHome Farm, Glynde, Lewes, Sussex, October 2iul, 1893.\nYou will be interested to hear that water has been found at the Toy\nFarm ; at a depth of about 118 feet a spring was found, and within a few\ninches from an opposite direction a second has broken forth, giving a strong\nsupply. The digging operations were carried on for a day or two, gaining an\nAdditional 6 feet before the water gained the upper hand. We have, there\nfore, a well of 124 feet in depth, with 12 feet of water in the well, which\ncertainly is very satisfactory. Water has been found where you indicated.\nThe spring flows from the directions you named from either end of the\nPlantation, and I am very thankful for the supply.\nI think as you have found a spring of water on the Toy Farm, you will\nfind one anywhere. I should not have a well dug unless I employed you.\nT. W. PicKArn.\nNo. 106.\u2014The next letter is addressed to me from the Rev. G.\nBooker, M.A., and gives particulars of Mr. Tompkins' dowsing for water\nat Woolhope, Herefordshire :\u2014\n5, Norfolk Terrace, Brighton, May 11th, 189H.\nIn reply to your queries, my brother in his lifetime tried to deepen a\nsmall well at his lodge gate ; and he lost the very insignificant quantity of\nwater which he had. There was on a high level, not far from the stable\nyard, a small well ; but there was no quantity of water in it ; quite in-\n,sufficient for the supply of the house, and much more of the stables and\ngardens. The principal supply of the house and stables, &c. , was drawn\nfrom two ponds used as reservoirs to collect the surface water from the rain,\nand a so-called land spring on a neighbouring estate. There was trouble about\nthe water supply almost every summer. Under these circumstances, I being a\ntrustee of the estate, had Mr. Tompkins' work as a water-finder brought under\n\fxxxn.] On the, So-called Divining Rod. 155\nmy notice. I communicated with him at once, and he came, and without any\ntrouble or delay found two springs, one of which, more convenient in\nposition, we adopted, and found water, sinking through the hardest blue-\nstone, at 51\u00a3 feet. Mr. Tompkins, in reply to an enquiry of mine when he\nfound the spring, named 50 to 55 feet as the probable depth we should have\nto sink ; you will see that the actual distance was between his two limits.\nAs to your third question [whether any prior attempts to find water\nin the neighbourhood had been made without the aid of a dowser] I have\nheard of attempts being made to sink wells and get water in the immediate\nneighbourhood of my son's property ; but without success.\nThe hitter part of the sinking in our well had to be done with dynamite.\nThe water came in too quickly for the use of gunpowder. When last I\nenquired, there were 25 feet in the well, and the workmen are now fixing a\nwind-pump to lift the water from the well and force it to the house and\nstables. There may be charlatans amongst the so-called water-finders : but\nTompkins is a genuine man and may be trusted. ^ Booker\nTwo days later, the Rev. G. Booker kindly sent the following\nfurther details :\u2014\nMay 13tfc, 1896.\nThe spring was found on the 19th September, 1893 ; but the well was not\nsunk for some months after that date, as Tompkins was very busy ; and when\nhe got to work he had to proceed by blasting with large charges all the way\ndown. It was past midsummer in 1894, I think, before he finished the well,\nand had a head of water of 30 feet. I said 25 in my last, but it is recorded as\nlast mentioned. The parish where the well was sunk is that of \\Voolhope,\nwhich is in County Hereford, and distant (speaking roughly) equally from\nHereford, Ledbury and Ross. It is, you may be aware, well known to geo\nlogists from its presenting a sample of the silurian formation ; and is, I\nbelieve, mentioned by Sir Bodcrick Murchison in one of his works.\nTompkins' success on my son's estate got him employment on the Earl of\nChesterfield's, which is close at hand. If you were to see him at work you\nwould not doubt him. It is most interesting to see him following the run of\nthe spring. GEO- Booker.\nNo. 107. \u2014I am indebted to Mr. Eastes, the Clerk to the Parish\nCouncil at Yelling, Huntingdon, for the following statement. I have\nalso to thank Mrs. Rowley, of The Priory, St. Neots, who, at my\nrequest, kindly made enquiries at Yelling, and confirmed the facts\nnarrated below :\u2014\nYelling Parish Council, Yelling, Huntingdon,\nJanuary 24th, 1896.\nYelling is a village and parish on the borders of Cambridgeshire, six\nmiles from St. Neots, and seven and a-half from Huntingdon. The inhabi\ntants have suffered much at times from scarcity of water, there being in\nreality no supply. What was procurable was from ponds and brooks, and\nwas known to be contaminated with organic impurities. There are several\nsurface wells in the place, but their position at once indicates that the water\n\f156 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nwhich percolates into them would be unsatisfactory,i and a chalybeate spring\nsituated at some distance from the village is useless for domestic purposes.\nIn February, 1895, the water-supply question was brought before the\nParish Council, and it was decided to seek the services of a water-finder.\nMr. B. Tompkins, of Pipsmore, Chippenham, Wilts, was communicated with\nand engaged to visit Yelling. This he did on April 8th. Mr. Tompkins-\ncarried a white thorn twig in front of him. Following quickly its lead, Mr.\nTompkins was soon [as he alleged] upon the spring-head, when round\nand round went the twig, over and over, twisting below whore it was being\nheld firmly, and eventually breaking off on one side. Mr. Tompkins then\nstated that here was what he termed \" a water-fiat \" ; the spring pointed out\nwas the strongest point. It was [he said] about 80 feet down, and capable\nof supplying 2,000 gallons of water a day. (Spring No. 1.) This was\nsatisfactory, but it was hardly in the right position. Another start was made\nfrom the centre of the village, and shortly round went the twig again,\nover and over ; this was in the right place, near the centre of the village ;\nhe said, about 20 to 25 feet down [we should have a] supply of about 1,000\ngallons a day. (Spring No. 2.) A third spring was also afterwards found in\nthe same manner.\nThe Parish Council then set to work. Had a well dug over Spring No.\n2. Found water at 23 feet 8 inches. Water analysed and found good. The\nCouncil have laid pipes from the well to the roadside, and there erected a\npump to supply the central part of the village. They have also dug over\nNo. 3 Spring, found good water and erected a pump. The rock over the\nSpring No. 2 was 2 feet 8 inches thick ; the soil consisting of blue gault.\nThe rock over the Spring No. 3 was thicker. There appeared to be two\nrocks to got through, between which was a layer of blue gault.\nJ. P. Eastes.\nIn reply to enquiries Mr. Eastes writes, \" No definite attempt to\nfind a spring by sinking a well beyond the surface wells hud been made\nbefore Mr. Tompkins came.\" In a subsequent letter, Mr. Eastes tells\nme that the depth of No. 2 Spring was 23 feet 8 inches, and of No. 3\nwas 80 feet.\nFurther particulars were also sent to me, in answer to enquiries, by\nMr. Anthony, of Yelling, who, Mr. Myers informed me, could also use\nthe dowsing rod. Mr. Anthony writes :\u2014\nYelling, Hunts, December 24th, 1896.\nThe water-finding here has proved very satisfactory. Although no\nattempts had been made to find water by sinking wells in Yelling prior to\nMr. Tompkins' visit in 1895, yet I am (mite satisfied that we should not find a\nspring of water by sinking a well anywhere in Yelling.2 For there are several\ni In a subsequent letter Mr. Eastes informs me that the Parish Council emptied the\nbest of these surface wells and after it had refilled had the water analysed. The\nresult showed \" it was highly charged with organic impurities,\" and unfit to drink.\nXo spring therefore existed in the well.\n2 Mr. Anthony tells me he means \" anywhere at random\/' as will also be seen from\nthe latter part of his letter.\n\fxxxii.] On tfte So-called Divining Mod. 157\nold wells in the village which have been sunk many years ago, not with the\nidea of finding a spring of water (as no such spring was ever found in those old\n,wells), but the idea was to sink wells and lay drains in the land 2 or 3 feet\ndeep so that the surface water might be drained into them, and so storing\nwater in winter for summer use ; frequently, however, the supply fell short\nin summer and great inconvenience was caused thereby. Since [Mr. Tompkins'\nvisit in] 1895, we have had a plentiful supply from two wells sunk last\nsummer, and which proved to be two good springs.\nI find I can also tell where there is water [even] without the use of the\nrod, but the rod indicates more distinctly the spot or strata where water\nmay be found.\nI would further say here, that I know instances in the neighbourhood\nwhere boring, or rather digging and boring operations, have been curried on\nto a depth of some 200 or 300 feet without success. I am quite satisfied if\nwe sank wells in Yelling, in many places we should find no water, and yet by\nmeans of using the rod it is possible to find water within a few yards of such\nwells without going many feet down. R Anthony\nIn a subsequent letter, Mr. Anthony replies to my inquiry as to\nthe depth of the surface wells which existed prior to Tompkins' visit :\u2014\nJanuary IWl, 1897.\nThe surface wells are various depths, from 30 to 40 feet. The success which\nattended the sinking of two wells in the neighbouring village of Croxton is\nsatisfactory, although water was not found at the depth Mr. Tompkins\nexpected. In one case it was found at about 12 feet, in the other at 80 feet.\nMr. Tompkins said they would find water about 35 or 40 feet from surface.\nThose two wells are sunk where the surface is about level, but in our case\nfat Yelling] one is on a hill, the other in a valley. t, .\n*J J R. Anthony.\nIn a recent letter I am informed that, Mr. Anthony having found\nthat the rod (in his own hands) moved strongly at one particular spot\non his farm, he determined to sink a well there, and has just obtained\na good supply of water at a depth of 65 feet.

F. Barrett.\nsome certainty of fmding it, as the whole formation of the subsoil is of a very\ndry nature. The farm lies on a bank, and the dwelling-house is at the foot of\nthe bank. The spot where Mr. Tompkins discovered water is some 50 feet\nabove the level of the house, exactly on the highest point of our fruit plan\ntations. The spring had two subterranean outlets,i and by means of one of\nthese the water finder traced the head of the spring, the twig pointing and\nleading him in a zigzag course till at length it revolved rapidly in his hands.\nThere, he said, water would be found, probably at a depth of 60 feet. The\nwell sinkers, however, had to go to 97 fe^t, through dry marly strata, before\nthey tapped the spring, which has since yielded at the rate of 2,000 gallons\nper day. No sooner had the confined water been properly released, than\nthe rod refused any further action, though up to that time it had been tried\nalmost daily, not only by Mr. Tompkins himself, but by a workman on the\nfarm who discovered he had the power, and the twig indicated, and turned\nover the spot up to the very hour the full flow commenced. A windmill\npumps the water for us into a 5,000 gallon tank, and at the present hour we are\nusing it on a freshly planted strawberry plot of 1J acres, the water being con\nducted through pipes, and from taps at intervals by means of hose.\nE. W. Beaven.\nHighfield House, May 2Ut, 1896.\n(1) No attempt was made to find water previous to the arrival of the\ndiviner, for the simple reason that we should not have thought of attempting\nanything of the kind. It was only on the guarantee that water would, be met\nwith, and, in fact, the absolute certainty of the rod's indicating power, a\npower that every unprejudiced mind must admit to be undoubted and\ngenuine, that induced us to sink for water. I am convinced that a thousand\npounds might have been laid out in boring, Ac., with no successful result.\nIt would have been entirely chance work without the divining rod.\n(2) As I said before, a workman on the premises discovered, quite\nunknown to us at first, that the twig would turn in his hands just over the\nspot indicated by Mr. Tompkins, and this was the only instance, although\nmany ladies and gentlemen tried their hands. g -yy' Beaven\nMr. Beaven, it will be seen, is (as, in fact, he tells me) \"a thorough\nbeliever in the divining rod,\" and has, I understand, published a book\ncalled \"Tales of the Divining Rod.\" Although the dry well was 80\nfeet deep and the well sunk at the spot indicated by the dowser was\n97 feet deep, the surface level of the dry well appears to be 50 feet\nlower than the other. Geological opinion on this case would be\nimportant.\nNo. 109. \u2014Mr. Tompkins has recently returned from a visit to\nSouth Africa, where he was engaged in sinking for springs by the rod.\nThe accompanying picture, from a photograph taken on the spot,\ni Mr. Beaven, I understand, means \"the spring supposed to be indicated by the\nrod.\"\u2014W.

The\nnews came in yesterday. You can imagine we are all delighted with the\nsuccess. The mining work was completely at a standstill for want of water.\nWe are sinking at three other spots you marked, and we believe we shall get\nlots of water in the ''Bult,\" and make the property a valuable one. The\ndrought is still very severe, and the difficulties of obtaining water for the\nmen and Kittle are very great. Hedley Bros.\nMr. Tompkins, in a letter to me, states that \"The syndicate which\nowned this large South African property had spent some \u00a37,000 in\nthe attempt to find water, but completely failed. Within 100 yards\nof one of the borings made I found a good spring.\" This statement\nmust be taken for what it is worth, for [ have no independent\ninformation whether any unsuccessful boring for water had been made\npreviously at this place.\nI wrote to Prieska, and also to Mr. Hedley's brother, who lives in\nEngland ; the latter can give me no further information, and from the\nformer I have not yet heard in reply.\nNo. 1 10. \u2014Mr. R. C. Warner writes to Mr. Tompkins as follows :\u2014\nOaksey, Malmesbury, October 27th, 1892.\nWe have sunk the well in the rick-yard, and at 49 feet we found the\nwater. There is now 9 feet standing in the well ofjS feet diameter, and I\nbelieve we shall have a sufficient supply for my requirements. We have also\nsunk the second well for the garden and house supply, and believe that both\nwill prove very successful. At the second well the water rose quickly to\nwithin 4 feet of the top, the well being 25 feet deep. At the first well we\nhave 12 feet \"of water now, and from this one we can draw 400 gallons per\nday continuously, and this quantity is as much as we are likely to require in\nany one day. R c Warner.\nI wrote to Mr. Warner to ascertain whether any prior attempts to\nfind water had been made ; he does not reply to this, but writes :\u2014\nEversley, Oaksey, Malmesbury, April l\\th, 1897.\nIn reply to yours I have very little to add to the testimony already given\nas to the utility of the divining rod in finding springs of water ; in my case\nthe result is still very successful, for during the last two seasons, which, as\nyou know, were extremely dry, we had quite sufficient water for my use.\nR. C. Warner.\nIn a subsequent letter, Mr. Warner adds that \" many failures had\noccurred in my district in sinking wells at hap-hazard.\"\n\fxxxn.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 161\nI have not space to quote the replies to other enquiries I have made\nin this group, as they merely indicate that a copious supply of water\nwas found at the various places indicated by the dowser ; the Rev. G.\nPiatt Dew, of Shirenewtown Rectory, Chepstow, and others, write to\nme to that effect. The Press Cutting Agency has also sent me\nnewspaper reports of similar results in other places, including some\nParish Councils who have engaged this dowser to find water in their\nlocalities. Mr. Tompkins also sent me a lengthy list of different\npersons for whom he has found underground springs by the rod, and\nno doubt among the list evidential cases are to be found.\nWhether the dowser's estimate of the depth and volume of the\nunderground spring be pure -guesswork, or is arrived at by some\ninstinct or experience, only a careful examination of the evidence can\nestablish. As I have quoted some letters which mention that Mr.\nTompkins was often incorrect as to the depth, it is only fair to say\nother correspondents tell me he was singularly accurate in his\nprediction of the probable depth of the spring.\nNo. 111.\u2014Here, for example, are two letters which reached Mr.\nTompkins unasked, and the originals of which he has sent me :\u2014\nParnacott, near Holsworthy, Devon, July 22nd, 1896.\nI should have written to you sooner to say how extremely gratified we are\nwith the result of your \" findings \" here. The spring I sank upon last year\nwhich we found at 34J feet (you guessed 33 feet I think) keeps the 5 feet\ndiameter well even now supplied with 20 feet of excellent water.

Wainwright.\nIn answer to my enquiry as to whether he experiences any sensa\ntion when over an underground spring, Mr. Tompkins replies :\u2014\nI feel a tingling sensation, and the twig begins to quiver when I get on to\na running stratum of water, and when over it the twig rises immediately.\nIt does not move for surface water nor water in pipes or drains, only\nnatural live water, as I term it. The moment I cross a stratum of water I\nfeel a sort of bracing sensation, which passes up my legs, back, and shoulders,\nand down the arms to the twig ; when I get off the water course I feel the\nloss of this power, till I cross the water again. When I get over the exact\nspot the twig revolves over and over, and I am powerless to keep it stdl.\n\f162 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nWhether this tingling sensation which is described by most dowsers\nis due to their imagination or not, I have no means of knowing ; and\nmeanwhile we must not attribute too much importance to it. Every\ndowser believes electricity moves the rod, and the chief effect of\nelectricity is popularly believed to be this tingling sensation. Hence\nit is possible enough that if the dowser thought electricity always pro\nduced a peculiar taste, we should find taste substituted for tingling\nwhen over a spring. I shall, however, return to the question of the\nphysiological effect alleged to be produced when dowsing for water.\nFailures.\nF. 6.i\u2014Mr. G. F. Lambert, of Bridgend, Glamorganshire, informed\nme on September 10th, 1896, that Tompkins had been engaged by the\nUrban District Council of Porthcawl, to find a supply of water for\nthat favourite seaside resort.\nTompkins fixed on a certain spot where he said \" an ample supply\nof water would be found at a depth of 80 feet.\" A well was sunk here\nand on September 18th, 1896, in reply to my enquiries, Mr. Lambert\ninformed me that water was found at the spot indicated at a depth of\n50 feet ; and he adds, \" the water collects in the well, which is 8 feet\nin diameter, to a depth of 20 feet in one night.\" Subsequently, how\never, I heard that the supply was insufficient and that the Local\nGovernment Board had disallowed the expenditure involved, which\nwas stated to amount to \u00a3800.\nIn response to my further enquiries, Mr. Lambert kindly went\nover to Porthcawl, and writes to me on June 24th, 1897, that he had\nseen the clerk to the District Council, who explained that, hoping to\nget a larger supply, the well was sunk to a depth of 140 feet, but\nthough some additional springs were intercepted, the total yield was\nquite inadequate to the requirements of the neighbourhood. The well\nwas sunk through a conglomerate magnesian-limestone (well known to\nexist round Porthcawl).\nMr. Tompkins had previously, in answer to my enquiry, frankly\ngiven me particulars of three cases where he had not been successful.\nHe states these are the only failures of his he had heard of ; quite\npossibly, but the dowser's estimate of the number of his own failures,\nas well as the usual attempt he makes to explain them away, must\nobviously he taken cum grano salis. After ascertaining where the\nfailures occurred in these three cases, I wrote to each person\nconcerned, and asked for further particulars.\ni The lettermg F. 6 is continued from p. 144.\n\fXXXII.] 163\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nF. 6a.\u2014From the agent to the Kemble Estate, Cirencester, I\nreceived the reply that they \"bored to a considerable depth at the\nspot indicated by Tompkins, but found no water.\"\nF. 7.\u2014The only other information of these failures I have been\nable to obtain is from Sir Henry Mather Jackson, Bart., D.L., etc.,\nwho kindly gave me full details of his case, and to whom I sent Mr.\nTompkins' own account of this failure. After some correspondence,\nSir Henry gives me permission to publish the following letter :\u2014\nLlantilio Court, Abergavenny, April 6th, 1897.\nI am obliged to you for allowing me to see Mr. Tompkins' statement in\nreference to his attempt to find a water supply for Buguderi\u2014a house of my\nmother's near to here.\nMr. Tompkins advised sinking on the top of a hill, and stated that in his\nopinion there would be water enough to supply a cottage.\nBoring was first adopted, and at one period there was, as Mr. Tompkins\nstates, a certain amount of water in the bore-hole, but whether this was\nspring or surface water it was impossible to say.\nAfter boring to a depth of 87 feet without any satisfactory result, Mr.\nTompkins came over to see the place again, and he then said that it was a\nmistake to have bored, that sinking should have been adopted, and that\nthough a considerable quantity of water had been allowed to escape, enough\nwas left for the purposes for which it was required. Sinking operations were\nthen commenced on the same spot, and after going down 122 feet without\nany sign of water, or evidence of there having been any water, the whole\nthing was abandoned. Mr. Tompkins is mistaken.in stating that the boring\nwas continued in the hopes that the \"water would rise to the top of the well;\"\nno such hope was ever entertained, and had any quantity of water been\nfound in the bore-hole, sinking to that point would at once have begun.\nIn my opinion Mr. Tompkins failed entirely in this instance, but I know\nof so many cases of success that I do not myself doubt the existence of\nthe \" gift \" ^moreover, as you say, the fact of his giving my name to you,\nthough he failed here, shows his honesty. Henry Mathbr JACKs01I.\nIn concluding this group I have to acknowledge the readiness with\nwhich Mr. Tompkins has offered to assist me. He writes : \" I will\ngladly submit to any test or experiment you may like to impose, in\norder to arrive at the truth of the enquiry you are engaged in.\" Not\nonly so, but Mr. Tompkins, at his own expense, came from Chippenham\nto the meeting of our Society in London, when this paper was read,\nto meet me and also to show the members of the S.P.R. the method\nhe adopts in dowsing.i Since then he has been to Cheltenham to submit\nto a series of experiments which Colonel Taylor has made for the\npurpose of this enquiry, the results of which will be given later on.\ni Mr. Chesterman, another professional dowser, also did the same, kindly coming\nup from Bath to London.\nM 2\n\f164 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nGroup VII.\u2014Mb. J. Stears.\nMr. Stears' name has already been mentioned in connection with\nthe very interesting case sent me by Mr. Clark (No. 7, p. 31). Mr.\nStears is now living at Westholme, Hessle, Yorkshire, and was until\nrecently engaged in business as an engineer in Hull. For some time\nhe was hon. sec. of the Hull Field Naturalists' Society, and is much\nrespected by all who know him. My attention was first directed to\nMr. Stears' use of the divining rod by the following letter which\nappeared in the Pall Mall Gazette and the Leeds Mercury for October\n9th, 1890. The writer is the Rev. W. Spiers, M.A., F.G.S., of Hulk-\nRecently in the company of a few geologists on the Yorkshire Wolds,\nit was stated that one of our company (Mr. John Stears, engineer of Hull)\nwas able to discover hidden water or metals by means of the rod. Our\nfriend cut out of the hedgerow a fork of hawthorn, shaped like a long V.\nHolding a prong in each hand with the apex downward, we soon had an\nopportunity of seeing \" there was something in it. \" Here and there, as he\nslowly walked along, the apex of the branch curled upwards as if alive. I\nknow the gentleman too well to suspect that he was cheating us ; but in\norder to see that he was not self-deceived, I placed my hand around those\nmuscles which must have moved had the contortions of the rod been due to\nunconscious muscular contractions. I quite satisfied myself upon that\npoint.\nI then requested him to close his eyes, and I led him over a small\nstream that was running down the hill on which we were walking, and the\nmoment we reached it, the rod commenced its remarkable movements. As\nsoon as I touched it with my fingers it resumed its natural position. For\nwater, it moved away from the operator, but for metals it swung round in\nthe opposite direction.\nI wrote to Mr. Stears, and the following is his reply :\u2014\nMy experience has been most satisfactory (extending over 30 years), and\nI have always found water where the rod indicated it, also iron pipes. In\nsome towns I have mapped out their position for the purpose of repairs, and\nthe pipes have been found exactly where I stated, some even left deep\nwhere a road had been raised.\nI may say that I notice a different sensation with waters and metals ;\nthere is a chilly feeling creeps up my legs when the rod shows water.\nMy powers vary with health ; if tired I lose the power ; provide the\nanimal system with a fresh supply of food, and back the power comes. I do\nnot like blindfolding. It seems to interfere with that calmness which is\ndesirable, but I have tried it on roads where I denoted water ; having been\ntaken backwards and forward I have been started in the middle of the road\nand stopped at the part previously marked. Darkness does not interfere\nwith the power in the least.\nMr. Stears then relates how he finds the nature of hidden metals by\ntrying various metals in his hand along with the rod, the corresponding\n\fxxxir.] On the So-called Divining Mod. 165\nmetal stopping all movement This is referred to in Appendix C;\nit is the survival of an old tradition, but is nothing more than the effect\nof the dowser's own idea. Experimental proof of the fallacy of this\namong other superstitions connected with the divining rod will be\ngiven subsequently.\nMr. Stears states that it was after watching the noted dowser,\nAdams (see No. 25, p. 48), that he found he also possessed a similar\npower, and he adds that in 1870 he and Adams, quite independently\nof one another, located the same spot as the source of a good under\nground spring. On sinking a well a strong spring was found some ten\nfeet beneath the surface in the magnesian limestone. When in Brazil\nin 1872, Mr. Stears says he occasionally tried his powers as a dowser\nand found a good supply of water for a resident, who sank a well at\nthe spot indicated by him through the motion of the rod.\nMr. Stears has at my request furnished me with a tabular statement\nshowing the places and the depths at which he has found water by the\nrod within the last two years only, at the same time furnishing me\nwith references to those who had engaged him for this purpose. The\nlist includes several local boards, noblemen, landowners and their\nagents, mill-owners, farmers, ,fec., a lengthy list. From many in this list\nI have received several letters in answer to my enquiries, and there can\nbe no doubt of the success Mr. Stears has obtained as a water finder.\nNo. 112.\u2014At a farm belonging to Mr. J. Letts, at Rillington, near\nMalton, in Yorkshire, a previous bore of 120 feet had been made\nunsuccessfully, not a drop of water being obtained ; nevertheless, close\nby Mr. Stears found, by the use of the rod, a tremendous spring which he\ninforms me \" fires up as high as the house and continues to do so when\nthe pipe is open.\" I wrote to Mr. Letts and had the following reply :\u2014\nRillington, Yorks, January 23rd, 1897.\n1. Boring for water had been made prior to Mr. Stears' visiting the farm\nat my recommendation, but without success, although they bored a distance\nof 120 feet.\n2. The place where Mr. Stears selected to bore would be about 30 yards\ndistant from the previous place. Mr. Stears found a very good supply at\n84 feet.\n3. The site of the farm is in the valley between the Moors and the Wolds.\nI may add Mr. Stears selected another spot for boring on my other farm.\nAlthough he found water, it was not nearly a sufficient quantity, consequently\nI didn't consider in that case he was so successful. I know several other\nplaces where he was most successful. John Letts\nIn correspondence Mr. Stears informs me that in addition to the\n120 feet useless boring, there was also another well close by, some 70\nfeet deep, which was contaminated with sewage, and that by the rod\n\f166 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nhe traced an underground stream, which fed this well, to a spot where\nthe new and successful well was sunk.

I sent this plan, with the foregoing remarks,\nto Mr. Letts, and asked him if he had any corrections to make. Mr.\nLetts returned it with merely a verbal correction, and marked\n\" correct.\"\nI am indebted to Mrs. Williams, of Temple House, Great Marlow,\nBucks, for a list of places in Aberdeenshire, where it was stated Mr.\nStears succeeded in finding water by the rod after other attempts had\nbeen made in vain. This latter statement, however, is not shown in\nthe correspondence that follows. Mrs. Williams says, \" The facts were\nrelated to me by my brother-in-law, Mr. Muirhead\u2014Lord Aberdeen's\nestate-agent\u2014who would tell you about his experience with Mr. Stears.\nMrs. Irvine, of Drum Castle, tried the rod, but it made her quite ill\nand exhausted.\"\nNo. 113.\u2014In reply to my enquiries, Mr. Muirhead writes :\u2014\nEstate Office, Haddo House, Aberdeen, March 23rd, 1897.\nOn July 7th last, accompanied by Mr. Stears, water-finder, I visited the\nfarm of Braiklay, on the Haddo House estates of his Excellency the Earl of\nAberdeen, in the parish of Tarves, and county of Aberdeen, the tenant of\nwhich is Miss Elizabeth Bean. The object of our visit was that Mr. Stears\nmight indicate a place on the farm where a supply of water might be found,\nwhich could be introduced to the buildings on the farm by gravitation.\nThe farm lies entirely, according to the Geological Survey Map, on the\ngneiss formation, and slopes generally to the east and south, from about 380\nto 250 feet above sea level, the farm buildings lying about half-way down\nthe slope.\nMr. Stears proceeded from the farm buildings up the slope, and very soon\nindicated by means of the rod a stream of water whose course he followed to\nthe highest point on the boundary of the farm. Leaving this stream he\nproceeded along the boundary until he found another stream, which he\nfollowed down the slope until he reached a point where he said that this\nsecond stream joined the first, which he had followed upwards from the\nfarm steading.\nThe crop on the field at the time of the visit was turnips, and as the\ntenant did not wish the crop interfered with until the turnips were ready to\nbe consumed by cattle, it was not until the month of November last that\nWing operations were commenced. After boring 21 feet water was found,\nwhich flowed at the rate of four gallons per minute, with steady pumping.\nThe boring was continued to a depth of 40 feet where a great supply was\nfound and which has never been pumped dry.\nThe water was recently introduced to the farm buildings.\n\f168 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nMr. Stears also, about the same time, visited the farm of Newton, in the\nparish of Methlick, also on his Excellency's estates, the tenant of which is\nMr. Robert Wilson.\nHere Mr. Stears also indicated a spot where water might be found,\nand, on boring operations being carried out, water was found at a depth\nof 10 feet. The boring was continued to 25 feet, where a satisfactory supply\nwas got.\nI will be glad to afford you any further information in my power.\nGeorge Muirhead.\nIn a subsequent letter, Mr. Muirhead writes, in reply to mine :\u2014\nNo attempt either by boring or sinking for water had been made in the\nneighbourhood of the place where Mr. Stears indicated that water would be\nfound, prior to Mr. Stears' visit.\nThere was no evidence of there being any water at hand either at\nNewton or Braiklay, both farms being on hills, and water had previously\nto be carried some distance. There is now a good supply.\nGeorge Muirhead.\nNo. 114.\u2014I wrote to Mrs. Irvine and the following is her reply :\nDrum Castle, Aberdeen, March ldth, 1897.\nIn reply to your note I beg to state that in 1893 we had the late Mr.\nLawrence of Bristol to find us water, which he did successfully in three or\nfour different places. In 1897 Mr. Stears came twice and marked a great\nmany places. Some for future use we have not yet tried, but in seven cases\nwe have found water on the exact spot marked by him.

Eddleston, farmer, Wrigley Carr,\n\fXXXII.] 169\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nBirtle, yesterday. The experiments were occasioned owing to a well which\nhad supplied the wants of the farm since 1888 having recently become dry.\nIn consequence Mr. Eddleston has been put to some inconvenience in\nobtaining an adequate supply of water, and he decided to invite Mr. John\nStears, of Hull, to visit the locality for the purpose of ascertaining by\nmeans of a \"divining rod\" where water could be found. About twenty\npersons, including farmers and others interested, witnessed the experiments.\n. . . After proceeding for some little distance, the \"divining rod'' (a\nforked branch of hawthorn) held in the hands of Mr. Stears about three feet\nfrom the ground, began to turn, and Mr. Stears announced that a good\nstream of water would be found underneath where they were standing, some\ndistance below the surface. Wooden pegs were driven into the ground, in\nplaces indicated by Mr. Stears, to mark the course of the stream. . . .\nWhile tracing this stream the current indicated was so strong that the twig\nwas snapped in two, and a little further on a second twig which had been\nobtained was also broken. . . . The well which had previously supplied\nthe farm, and which had been worked by one of Mr. Webster's wind-power\npumping engines, was next visited, but no satisfactory result was obtained\nin the vicinity of the well. A route was then taken in the direction of the\nfarm, and it was soon apparent that another stream had been struck. This\nwas traced for some distance and eventually found to cross the stream first\ndiscovered, although the two water-courses were, according to Mr. Stears,\nat different levels. He found the junction of the two streams, and a number\nof pegs were driven into the ground. Boring operations will be commenced\nin due course, and if these are successful the wind engine will be removed\nto the place from the well previously referred to The spot indicated is on\nrising ground.\nI wrote to Mr. Eddleston to ascertain if the foregoing report were\ncorrect and whether water had been found as indicated. The following\nis his reply :\u2014\nWrigley Carr Farm, Birtle, near Rochdale,\nSeptember loth, 1896.\nI gladly comply with your request for report of the water found by means\nof the divining rod. Having been very much troubled this dry summer for\ngood water, at the suggestion of Mr. Jonas Webster, water engineer, of\nBolton, I agreed that he should get Mr. Stears from Hull. At the time\nappointed Mr. Stears came, and on a very dry hill above the house he found\na good stream running in a west to east direction, and another smaller stream\ncrossing the same north and south.i We considered [it] best to take the\ncrossing point, so I at once engaged men to sink a well there ; they went on\nsinking, and bricking as they went on, through the different minerals as dry\nand hard as possible until they got to the depth of 30 feet ; then they came to\nthe stream [running] north and south, which made a fair supply of water. But\nI kept them sinking on till they came to the next stream at the depth of 42\nfeet, which was an excellent stream running across the bottom of the well,\ni Mr. Eddleston, of course, means that Mr. Stears stated these underground\nstreams existed.\u2014W.

I am glad to say the result is very successful, and\nMr. Webster is now going to put up one of his wind pumping engines.\nJoseph Eddleston.\nNo. 116.\u2014Another case, which needs further investigation, is\ngiven in a letter to a journal called The Carpenter and Builder, of\nNovember 18th, 1892. Mr. W. Smith, of Atherby, Malton, Yorkshire,\nwrites :\u2014\n\" In order to supply a small cottage property with water, I dug a new\nwell, and got to a considerable depth, when to our dismay, we struck solid\nrock, when on account of the cost it might entail, we were compelled to\ncease further operations, and in despair, filled it in again.\n\" I was relating my experience to Mr. Nelson, the courteous surveyor of\nthe Norton (Malton) Local Board, who suggested Mr. John Stears, of\nHull, with his divining rod. . . .\n\"Mr. S. proceeded to cut out of the hedge a forked thorn, which he\nheld by the forked ends, with both hands straight out before him, and\nwalked leisurely across the ground. Immediately he came across the\nspot underneath which he said lay water, the rod, which he held firmly\nwith both ends, began to move upwards until it touched his breast. At\nthat spot we have dug, and found water at a depth of only seven yards,\nwhich has set at rest any doubt as to the success or otherwise of the\nexperiment.\"\nNo. 117.\u2014The following is from the Peterborough Express of\nSeptember 12th, 1895.\nAs we briefly announced in a recent issue, the Arborfield Paper Mills at\nHelpston, owned by Messrs. A. Towgood and Sons, are being provided with\na fresh supply of water, a spring having been discovered by means of the\ndivining rod in the yard at the rear of the premises. A plentiful supply of\nwater is highly necessary for the manufacture of brown paper, and the\nfinding of the spring will give to the mill that which has long been required.\nThe services of Mr. J. Stears, water expert and engineer of Westholme,\nHessle, near Hull, were called into requisition. He found water in the yard,\nand it was eventually decided to bore at a spot behind the mill. The boring\noperation was placed in the hands of Mr. J. E. Noble, builder and contractor,\nof Bourne. Boring proceeded steadily for several days, various strata of\nearth, including rock, being passed through. At a depth of 49ft. rock was\nagain reached, and at 52ft. a steady stream of water was discovered. The\noperations were still continued, the rock being again pierced, and at 69ft. the\nmain spring was tapped, a volume of water of tremendous pressure shooting\nup. The boring was intended for a two and a-half inch pipe, but it has\nsince been decided to have a four inch pipe. The quality of the water is to\nall appearances exceedingly pure, and the volume of water is estimated to be\n\fXXXII.] 171\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nbetween seven and eight thousand gallons per hour. The method of passing\nthe water into the mill has yet to be dealt with.\nMr. Stears sent me the following letter from Messrs. Towgood\nto him :\u2014\nArborfield Mill, Helpston, May Uth, 1896.\nThe boring for water which we made here at the spot indicated by you by\nmeans of the divining rod has proved entirely successful ; a continuous supply\nat the rate of 10,000 gallons per hour is now rising to the surface.\nAlfred Towgood and Sons.\nI wrote to Messrs. Towgood asking if the above newspaper report\nwere correct, and if a previous boring had been made, and, if so, how\ndeep. They reply :\u2014\nThe printed report you send is quite correct. No previous boring had\nbeen made. We quite believe in the divining rod.\nAlfred Towqood and Sons.\nNo. 118.\u2014Mr. Stears, writing to me, states that he was also\nengaged by the local authorities at Helpston, who were in want of a\nbetter supply of water, and that he succeeded in finding an abundant\nsupply by the indications of the rod. This is described at length in the\nlocal papers. I abridge the following from the Peterborough Express\nof August, 1896 :\u2014\nThe question of the water supply of Helpston has been the one absorbing\ntopic for some time, and the villagers have been in sore straits owing to the\ninadequate supply. So short was water in the village a few weeks ago that\nthe inhabitants trooped to the pump in the early morning, but many had to\nreturn disappointed. A well sunk last year proved to be of little use. Mr.\nHowes, the representative on the District Council, interested himself to a\ngreat extent, and his efforts resulted in the matter being placed in the hands\nof the Parish Council with power to act. This body called in the service of a\n\"diviner,\" Mr. Stears, of Hull, who successfully operated in the case of the\nwater supply at the Paper Mills. One of the spots tried was at the four\ncross roads in Woodgate. Here so strong was the current that the divining\nrod was broken, and Mr. Stears recommended that boring operations should\ntake place. The work was placed in the hands of Mr. Noble, of Thurlby,\nand boring operations were commenced. By Saturday night a depth of 37\nfeet had been reached, 6J feet of rock having been passed through at the\ntop, followed by a thick layer of clay. By Monday a depth of 46 feet had\nbeen reached, a second layer of rocks being pierced at about 43 feet. The\nwater was \" struck \" on Tuesday and rose to the surface in great quantities.\nThe flow from the top, notwithstanding that the drill had not been removed,\nwas more than a six-inch pipe could take away, and the immediate locality\nwas flooded. Immediate steps had to be taken to open the drains. There\nis every reason to believe that a supply has now been tapped which is more\n\f172 [part\nProfessor W. F. Baivett.\nthan sufficient to supply the whole of the village, besides providing an\nunlimited quantity for flushing and other sanitary purposes.\nMr. Stears has sent me a copy of Mr. Noble's letter to him which\nis as follows :\u2014\nThurlby, Bourne, Lincolnshire, September 4th, 1896.\nI am pleased to tell you the bore on the Village Green at Helpston,\nmarked out by you, has given very great satisfaction. At a depth of 50 feet,\nthe water rushed up, the overflow being measured at 7,000 gallons per hour ;\nthe Helpston people are delighted at the success, having been without water\nso long.\nJ. E. Noble.\nNo. 119.\u2014The next case was described by Miss A. W. Richardson,\nof Moyallon House, Gilford, Co. Down. She wrote to Mrs. Sidgwick\nin 1885, as follows :\u2014\nOn one occasion, being with my father on business at one of our homes in\nIreland, Mr. Stears offered to tell him if there were water beneath a certain\npart of my father's property, in which he wished to build, and in which being\nvery rocky, it was troublesome to bore.\nThe idea was quite novel to us then, but upon his \"assuring my father that\nwater existed there, it was proved to be the case. This is the only instance\nwhere the process was at all removed from the possibility of thought-\ntransference. At our other home (he had never been to either before) he\nwas led over a piece of ground where several of us knew that drains at\nperiodical distances existed, and his rod went up quite correctly as he passed\nover them.\nIn this case, of course, it could at once be referred to transference of\nthought. Of course in these cases it is almost impossible to devise a plan by\nwhich it may be tested without the knowledge of some spectator.\nI have observed that the very slightest muscular motion sends up the\nvertex of the rod ; but, of course, the ambiguous part of the process is the\ncoincidence of the sensation which produces this movement with the presence\nof water.\nMy sisters were interested in finding that the custom commonly obtains\nin a remote part of the South of France, in which they spent a winter, lately.\nA. W. Richardson.\nMr. Stears is now on a \" water-finding \" visit to the West Indies,\nwhere he has been professionally engaged.\nFailures.\nI have heard of a few failures in connection with Mr. Stears ;\nothers doubtless exist which have never reached me. (As before,\nthe numbering F. 8 is consecutive, following on from p. 163.)\n\fXXXII.] 173\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nF 8.\u2014Here is one where the failure has led the Parish Council\nto a very heavy and useless expenditure :\u2014\nBardney, Lincoln, February 16th, 1897.\nBardney Water Supply.\nMr. John Stears, of Westholme, Hessle, Yorkshire, diviner, was\nemployed hy our Parish Council to find water. He tried many parts of the\nvillage, and indicated several places where he was sure water would be\nfound, particularly in one spot, where he was satisfied a very copious supply\nwould be found. At this spot we commenced boring about three months\nago, and have got to a depth of about 240,feet still in blue clay, but at\npresent without any signs of water. No engineer has been consulted. As\nsoon as water is found I will let you know.\nJ. R. Hird,\nClerk to the District Council.\nIn reply to my subsequent enquiry, Mr. Hird writes :\u2014\nBardney, Lincoln, April 13th, 1897.\nA depth of 340 feet has now been reached, but unfortunately without\nany signs of water. They are still in blue clay. At a depth of 286 feet they\ncame to rock 2 feet 9 inches in thickness, and at 300 feet the like 3 feet in\nthicknesS- J. R. Hird.\nFrom the following which arrived as this paper is going to press, it\nwill be seen the boring has been made still deeper. I enquired who\nwas the Chairman of the Parish Council.\nBardney, Lincoln, May 21st, 1897.\nA depth of 390 feet has now been reached, without at present any signs\nof water. They are now in rock, and have got about 18 feet into it. Mr.\nJohn Sharpe, of Bardney Manor, is our Chairman.\nJ. R. Hird.\nF. 9.\u2014In the next case my informant, Mr. Bradley, gives me\nevidence of Mr. Stears' success as well as failure. Here is his\nletter :\u2014\nEstate Office, Ebberston, York, May 20th, 1897.\nI heard of Mr. Stears being at Ileslerton, Ganton, Knapton, etc. ; several\nparties bored where Mr. Stears said there was water, and were successful.\nI went over to some of the places, and saw for myself.\nI recommended Mr. Stears to the managers of Trainton School, and they\nsent for him. He came over, and pointed out where there was water, and\nthey sunk a well and bored about 80 feet, and got plenty of water.\nI also recommended Mr. Stears and Mr. Gataker to the Parish Council at\nAppleton le Moors. They sent for Mr. Stears, and he went over and\npointed out to them that there was water in a certain field, a very high\npoint. They also sent for Mr. Gataker, and he sent his assistant, named\nWills, and he fixed on the same place that Stears did. But some of the\n\f17* [part\n, Professor W. F. Barrett.\nParish Council thought that Mr. Wills had overheard them say, \" That would\nbe the best place if there was water. \" Mr. Wills said there was water, and a\ngood supply could be got.\nThe Parish Council sunk a well about 45 feet, and bored 36 feet (81 feet\naltogether) and then stopped because there were no signs of water. They had\nbeen told they would get water at 60 feet, or might have to go 80 feet.\nThe Parish Council then asked me to go over and see the place. I went\nand inspected the well, etc., and the whole district, and 1 have not the least\ndoubt in my mind they would have to go down a great depth. At the place\nwhere the well is sunk there is at least 280 feet of limestone before they get\nto the clay bed. JosEph Bradley\nMr. Bradley adds a geological section of the district, which\nconfirms his statement. Mr. Bradley informed Stears and Gataker of\nthis failure, and both say the water is there, only somewhat deeper\nthan the Parish Council has bored !\nF. 10. - I have also had some correspondence with reference to\nanother case of failure on the part of Mr. Stears, which occurred at\nFlamborough in Yorkshire. Here a well was sunk at the spot\nindicated by Mr. Stears, and sinking or boring carried down to 170\nfeet through the clay into the chalk, and no water reached. My\ncorrespondent, however, does not wish his name or letters published.\nMr. Stears, in reply to my enquiry, gives as his explanation that \" the\nboring was not carried deep enough, as the chalk is upheaved and the\nstrata contorted at the place.\"\nDoubtless, if a boring goes deep enough, water might be reached,\nbut failure is the only name to be given to cases where water\u2014\npredicted at a certain spot and limit of depth\u2014is not found, after\nsinking to this depth, or, say, 20 per cent, deeper than was indicated\nby the dowser.\nExperiments in Kingstown.\nMr. Stears happening to be on a visit to Ireland, in July, 1892, I\nrequested him to submit to some tests of his powers, to which he\nreadily consented.\nExperiment 1.\u2014The experiments were made in the private pleasure\ngrounds opposite my house, at Kingstown, a place entirely new to Mr.\nStears, who had never been in this neighbourhood before. Cutting a\nforked twig, Mr. Stears started from the point marked A in the accom\npanying plan, and walked to and fro until he reached the point\nmarked with an asterisk, when from the sudden and vigorous movement\n\fXXXII.] 175\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nof the twig he asserted that a considerable spring of water was under\nneath this spot. There was nothing whatever to indicate that such\nwas the case, but on enquiry from the gardener (who was not present\nduring the experiment) I learnt for the first time that the very\nspot upon which Mr. Stears had fixed was the site of an old well, now\ncompletely hidden beneath the level greensward. I now begged Mr.\nStears to walk slowly over the ground, and if the rod indicated any\nother springs, to allow me then to blindfold him and so retrace the\nground. Mr. Stears consented, and with this object he moved in the\ndirection of the dotted line. The rod moved at the points marked xi\non the plan. At the point B., Mr. Stears, notwithstanding the very\nreasonable objection he had made in his letter to me 18 months before,\n(p. 164), was carefully blindfolded, and endeavoured to retrace his\nsteps : the rod moved at the points marked x2. He now asked me to\nlet him try the same course with his eyes closed and the bandage\nremoved. This I did, and the rod moved at the points marked X3.\nFinally, at C, he consented to be again carefully blindfolded, and once\nmore he retraced his steps, the rod moving at the points marked x4.\nIt will be seen that these points do not coincide, but in two or three\nplaces they are nearly in the same straight line,\u2014approximately N.\nand S. It is possible that there may be underrgound water in this\n\f176 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ndirection, as Mr. Stears subsequently declared there was from the\nmovement of the rod, and tracked out the supposed course of two or\nthree imaginary streams.\nExperiment 2.\u2014Mr. Stears having stated that the rod moved over\ncomparatively small masses of metal, I procured nine bandboxes and\nremoving their lids, put large lumps of iron beneath some of them, and\nnothing under others ; Mr. Stears did not see this arrangement I made\non the lawn till it was completed, when, as the boxes were all inverted,\nit was impossible to tell under which one the iron weights were con\ncealed, nor was I quite certain in each case myself, so that thought-\ntransference need hardly be considered. The result was that out of\nthe nine boxes Mr. Stears indicated five correctly ; that is, he was\ncertain from the movement or non-movement of the rod that iron was\nor was not beneath the box ; three indications were wrong, and one was\ndoubtful. The trial was therefore inconclusive, as the number told\ncorrectly was not beyond the probability of chance coincidence.\nExperiment 3.\u2014Another trial was made with three bandboxes, a\nmass of iron, unknown to Mr. Stears, being placed under No. 3. On\ntesting with the rod, Mr. Stears asserted from the movement of the rod\nthat the iron was beneath No. 2, and nothing under No. 3. This was\ntherefore a complete failure.\nExperiment 4.\u2014Finally I chose two exactly similar boxes and put\na half cwt. beneath one and nothing beneath the other ; recalling Mr.\nStears, I begged him to make a succession of trials, at short intervals,\non the two boxes, whilst I noted the results. I got some one to\nchange the position of the iron each time (or not change it), and then\ngo away without letting Mr. Stears or myself know what had been\ndone. On adding up the number of successes and failures, I found\nthat the result was just what chance coincidence would have given,\nthat is to say, there was almost exactly an even number of successes\nand of failures.\nWith the exception, therefore, of the location of the old well, the\nfirst experiments with Mr. Stears were inconclusive, and the latter,\nmetal-finding, distinctly adverse to the existence of any such alleged\npower. At the same time I am perfectly satisfied of the bonafides of\nMr. Stears, and have cordially to thank him not only for so readily\nacceding to every test I proposed, but for having put himself to some\nexpense and inconvenience by prolonging his stay in Ireland to enable\nme to carry out these trials.\n\fxxxn.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 177\nGroup VIII.\u2014Mr. Leicester Gataker.\nOne of the younger water finders is Mr. Leicester Gataker,\nformerly of Weston-super-Mare, now residing at Crescent-gardens,\nBath. He is a gentleman by birth and education ; his father was a\ncaptain in the Bengal Staff Corps, and the son, after leaving Bath\nCollege, where he was educated, discovered to his surprise that a\nforked twig revolved in his hands in the same way as it did with\na local \"diviner.\" Mr. Gataker states that whenever he is over a\nspring of water a sensation not unlike a slight shiver comes over him,\nchiefly in his arms, and the forked twig, or wire, he sometimes holds,\ncontinues to revolve\u2014independently of his volition \u2014so long as he\nremains over the bed of the stream or spring ; running water alone\naffecting him.i Judging from his sensations, or the movement of the\ni In conversation, Mr. Gataker told me this sensation was most marked, and\nusually began at the pit of the stomach : a feeling of sickness often being produced.\nThis is what some other professional dowsers have also told me, quite independently\nof each other. How far this experience is due to a preconceived idea, I do not know.\nn\n\f178 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nrod, he asserts that by practice he has been able to estimate the\ndepth and volume of the underground spring or stream. Repeated\ntrials having satisfied Mr. Gataker that his success was not due to a\nmere \" fluke,\" he determined to make water finding his profession,\nhis health not permitting him to continue the sedentary life of a\nLondon office. In addition to finding water, Mr. Gataker, like many\nother professional \" diviners,\" employs workmen to sink the well ;\nlike others also, he agrees to the terms of \" no water, no pay,\"\nbut charges 25 per cent, extra for his work if carried out under\nthese conditions !\nUnlike other dowsers, Mr. Gataker does not, ordinarily, use a\nforked twig or any kind of rod. An eye-witness thus describes his\nproceeding. The rod, it will be seen, is discarded :\u2014\" His procedure\nseems to be a rapid survey of the ground. He walks along with\na quick step, with his hands hanging by his side, until (according\nto his statement) he strikes a stream of water, when he at once\nbecomes visibly agitated. With outstretched hands he appears\ncarefully to feel his whereabouts, until he ascertains the direction\nthe stream is flowing and follows it up. Then he marks the spot\nof greatest supply and estimates the depth and quantity likely to\nbe obtained.\"\nThe accompanying woodcut (taken from Black and White) shows\nMr. Gataker at work (see p. 177).\nAgain, Mr. G. F. Tregelles, of Barnstaple, gives me the following\ndescription of Mr. Gataker's procedure :\u2014\nOn October 28th, 1896, I went down to Ilfracombe to join a party of\nmembers of the Ilfracombe Local Board, who had engaged Leicester Gataker,\nof Weston-super-Mare and Bath, to look for additional supplies of water for\ntheir reservoir. . .\nGataker, who is a young man, did not use the forked twig, but walked\nabout with long strides, holding out his hand, or hands, palm down, and\nevery now and then making a dash or lurch to one side, diverging right or\nleft, sometimes walking straight, and sometimes in a circle, and at last, if\nsatisfied, digging his heel into the turf at the chosen spot. He seemed to be\nfollowing a sensation, which is what he professes to do, and he looked very\nlike a dog following the traces of a rabbit over the gras\u00ab.\nOn questioning him he said that when over a hidden spring, even with\narms folded, he felt a tingling all through his body, and still more so when\none or both hands were extended. The depth and quantity of water he\nestimated by the intensity of this feeling, coupled with experience.\nI wrote to Mr. Gataker and asked him to furnish me with a\nsummary of any cases where he had been called in to find an under\nground spring, by the exercise of his dowsing faculty, after previous\n\fXXXII.] 179\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nattempts to find water in the ordinary way had failed. In reply, Mr.\nGataker sent me brief particulars of some two dozen cases \u2014drawn up\nin a business-like and excellent manner,\u2014and writes as follows : \u2014\nBath, January 12th, 1897.\n1 think I am right in saying that water was sought for unsuccessfully\nprior to my visit, in each case. However, clients can substantiate my claim\nor not. If the latter, I should like to know of it.\nI can give you other cases, only my own time being so much occupied, I\ncame to the conclusion that the few I have sent will be sufficient.\nLeicester Gataker.\nThe particulars given by Mr Gataker were, in nearly all these csises,\nfollowed by a copy of a letter from the person who employed him,\nsupporting in general terms Mr. Gataker's statement ; these letters,\nsome of which I here quote, did not, however, indicate that previous\nattempts to find water had in each case been made.\nNo. 120.\u2014Mr. Ashworth, agent to Mr. Arkwright, of Hampton\nCourt, writes as follows to Mr. Gataker :\u2014\nHampton Court Estate Office, near Leominster,\nOctober 30t)i, 1895.\nReferring to your visit to Bodenham on August 3rd, 1894, I am writing\nto inform you that a well was sunk at the spot indicated by you at the back\nof the keeper's cottage, and water was found at a depth of 53 feet, being 13\nfeet lower than the extreme depth as estimated by you.\nThe supply of water is sufficient for the purposes for which it is required,\nthe water rising about 3 ft. 6 in. in the well, and being of excellent\nquality. Henry A. Ashworth.\nRespecting this, Mr. Gataker states he was employed on this\noccasion to find water in consequence of a deep well formerly in use\nhaving run dry ; and he succeeded in locating the above supply within\na few yards of the old well.\nI wrote to Mr. Ashworth asking if Mr. Gataker's statements were\ncorrect, and received the following reply : \u2014\nHill House, Bodenham, Leominster.\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th inst, Mr. Gataker visited Hampton\nCourt Estate in the summer of 1894, and asserted, after searching, that water\nwould be found at a certain depth\u2014about 20 ft. east of the old well which\nhas been sunk for the use of the cottage, for which a supply was required\u2014\nthe old well proving dry. An excellent supply of water was found on sinking\nat the spot he indicated, but at about 10 ft. lower than he thought it would\nbe found.\nn 2\n\f180 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nNo attempts [beyond the old well] to sink had been made previous\nto his visit.\nH. A. AShWORTH,\nAgent, Hampton Court Estate, Near Leominster.\nIn reply to my enquiries Mr. Ashworth writes further :\u2014\nHill House, Bodenham, Leominster, April 26th, 1897.\nThe following are the particulars you require :\u2014\n(1) Depth of new well, sunk at the spot Mr. Gataker indicated, 53 feet.\n(2) Character of ground sunk through : hard marl, with the exception of\na thin bed of stone 6 inches thick, 6 feet from surface.\n(3) Depth of water in well : from 36 to 42 inches.\n(4) Depth of old well, which was situated 8 yards west of new well :\nabout 72 feet.\nH. A. Ashworth.\nNo. 121.\u2014The next letter is addressed to Mr. Gataker, from Mrs.\nHolloway, of Stroud :\u2014\nFarm Hill, Stroud, Gloucestershire, December 13th, 1894.\nYour search for water at Farm Hill, Stroud, was most successful, the\nwater being found at the spot indicated by you.\nThe men told me there were 18 feet of water in the well, which I have\nhad analysed twice, and it is found very good.\nAnne Holloway.\nHere Mr. Gataker states that, prior to his visit, boring for water\nhad been made to a depth of 70 feet, but no water found. I wrote to\nMrs. Holloway and asked if this statement were correct ; the following\nis the reply :\u2014\nFarm Hill, Stroud, Gloucestershire, March 16th, 1897.\nThe statement made by Mr. Gataker is correct. The distance between\nthe unsuccessful and the successful bore was a gradual ascent of about 300\nyards. Mr. Gataker gave the limit of depth at 50 feet, but a good spring of\nwater was actually found at 45 feet.\nAnn Holloway.\nNo. 122.\u2014In the next case Mr. Gataker writes to me as follows:\u2014\n\" I was engaged on the estate of Mr. Geake, near Launceston, and after\nsearching for water in Mr. Geake's field, I was brought to an old well\n(dry), and which was looked upon as useless. Full particulars of the\nwork carried out following my advice will be found in the letter I\nreceived, as follows \" : \u2014\nMillways, Launceston, Cornwall, October 4fA, 1895.\nYou will be pleased to hear we found the spring, after sinking one well to\n65 feet, and driving a heading about 15 feet, exactly as you predicted. This\nwe had to do to get at the spot marked by you.\n\fXXXII.] 181\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nThe find was more remarkable because you said we ought to come to this\nspot very soon, and you could not see how the well should go quite dry,\nconsidering the spring was so near. The well was not straight, and was sunk\nthe opposite way.\nWe have now 10 feet 6 inches of water deep, 15 feet long, and about an\naverage of 5 feet wide, which has kept to the level through September.\nJohn Grake.\nIn reply to my enquiries, Mr. Geake writes :\u2014\nMillways, Launceston, April lit, 1897.\nThe well was sunk many years ago to supply 20 acres of grazing land.\nOriginally it was about 25 feet deep. It was taken in hand from time to\ntime by different men, and put down to 55 or 56 feet. Even after that it\nwent dry for three and four months, according to the summer weather.\nWhen we sent for Mr. Gataker, we did not open the well ; it had been quite\ndry, as usual, for some time. Mr. Gataker came upon it suddenly. He had\nbeen going over other ground. We had hoped he would find a shallow\nspring somewhere else. After asking a few questions about the well, he\nwalked on one side of it, and simply said, \" I have it.\" He turned and said,\n\"There should be a certain quantity of water at the bottom of that well, if\nit is 55 or 56 feet deep ; there is a spring running near,\" pointing to one\nside of the well, \" and it should have touched the top of it.\" We found out\nafterwards that if the well had been sunk straight down, as we supposed it\nto be, this should have been the case, but in order to escape some hard\nground, the men, years before, had gone all on one side, quite the opposite\nside to where Mr. Gataker was pointing. He gave instructions to sink the\nwell 10 feet deeper, and drive to the place he marked. When it was\naccomplished we had a room of water, about 15 feet long and 10 feet deep,\nat the bottom of the old well ; the water rose to the level of the bottom of\nthe old well.\nAn old Cornish miner, who went down, said that at the spot Mr. Gataker\npointed out, and depth, there was a lode, about 12 feet wide, showing\n\" Manganese.\" The water is of excellent quality, and we have raised the\nrent accordingly. [!] John Geake.\nIn answer to my enquiry whether Mr. Gataker's predictions were\nverified upon actual trial, and whether it was probable water might\nhave been found elsewhere on the estate, or by sinking the existing\nwell deeper, Mr. Geake replies : \u2014\nMillways, Launceston, April 13th, 1897.\nWe verified Mr. Gataker's predictions. The spring was found at the very\nplace he indicated. We [probably] should not have found a similar supply\nby sinking deeper, or anywhere about but the place he marked. In my last\nto you, I quite forgot to mention that we had gone to great expense by\nhaving two holes bored at the bottom of the well, 20 and 30 feet, which\nmade the well and holes 86 feet deep.

In corroboration,\nhe encloses the following letter :\u2014\nBridgwater, Somerset, July, 1896.\nWe have sunk a well in the garden, and a copious spring has been found\nat 13ft. 6in., which amply verifies your prediction.\nJ.

As regards the statement that there\nwas a well about 20 feet deep which was useless, this is perfectly true,\nbecause the water in it was foul, and smelt badly.

In Pearson's Magazine, p. 31 1,\nyou will find some account of Gataker's work here. He is there depicted\nhunting for springs in the bed of the lake.

We,\nhowever, walked over two fields, in each of which points were marked where\nMr. Gataker said springs of water at various depths would bo found. I have\nup to the present only experimented on one, and this at about 9 feet deep,\nwhich is well within the estimated depth made by Mr. Gataker, and the\napparent water supply is nearly as stated by Mr. Gataker, viz., about two\ngallons a minute. Mr. Gataker, when pointing out this supply, told me that\nin a previous digging I had just missed the proper spring by about 4 or 5\nyards, and in this he seems to be correct. The excavation was almost\nentirely through rock.\nI shall be happy to report further if you desire it, but work is necessarily\nslow, as there is so much rock to go through. John Stansfeld.\nSubsequently I wrote to Captain Stansfeld, who stated he was\nexpecting another visit from Mr. Gataker, and that the spring the\nwater-finder had previously found continued to give a plentiful supply.\nLater on, I received the following :\u2014\nDunninald, Montrose, October 2Ath, 1896.\nMr. Gataker did not use the rod in discovering water, but in order to\nshow the working, he took a forked hazel rod, and this rod twisted round in\nhis hands. A gentleman then tried the rod, but in his hands it did not\nmove, till Mr. Gataker put his own hands on the wrists of the gentleman,\nwhen the rod immediately turned round. John Stansfeld>\nNo. 128.\u2014The Bath Chronicle of January 7th, 1897, has the\nfollowing :\u2014\nMr. Leicester Gataker was recently engaged by the Belfast Brewery to\nput them in the way of obtaining a good supply of water. They had\npreviously sunk four wells, and had also some time before had the services of\nanother diviner. Acting upon Mr. Gataker's advice, they have sunk two\n\f186 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nwells. In the case of the second one, he advised the company that at a depth\nof from 120 to 150 feet they would obtain what they required. After going\n80 feet they tapped a spring. This did not come up to their requirements,\nso they asked Mr. Gataker to come again, doubtless in view of their previous\nfailures. He accordingly went, and informed the company that they must go on\nto the depth originally given\u2014150 feet. They went on, and at the depth named\nthey secured a second spring of large power. While in Ireland last month\nhe again visited the place, and after descending the well, he predicted that by\ngoing nine feet deeper they would obtain an even stronger (third) spring.\nThey no longer had any doubt as to what course to pursue, and by doing as-\nlast advised, they have increased the supply by 2,000 gallons a day.\nA subsequent issue of the same newspaper states that : \u2014\nWell No. 2 has now been carried out, and Mr. T. R. Caffrey, the pro\nprietor, gives the yield at 7,000 gallons per 24 hours. He has also stated\nthat \"it would have been a saving of many hundreds of pounds had I known\nMr. Gataker when I first started looking for water.\" Both wells are 197\nfeet deep.\nI wrote to the proprietor of the brewery as to the accuracy of the\nforegoing newspaper reports, and asked for further particulars. Mr.\nCaffrey replies :\u2014\nThe Brewery, Belfast, February 26th, 1897.\nThe enclosed cuttings are quite correct, save and except the No. 2 well\nis now giving over 9,000 gallons in the 24 hours.\nI had a water-finder before I met with Mr. Gataker, who marked out four\nplaces. I got water in one of the four, none in the other three. Mr.\nGataker marked the two wells I have opened and found the water all right.\nThomas R. Caffrey.\nI could not ascertain from Mr. Caffrey the name of the previous\nunsuccessful dowser.\nThe next letter is from Dr. A. A. Mantell, of Bath :\u2014\nThe Elms, Bathampton, Bath, July, 1894.\nOn June 4th, 1894, I took Mr. Leicester Gataker to a neighbour's tennis\nlawn in Bathampton, which was made by him, and during the excavations a\nspring of water was found, which now runs diagonally across the lawn.\nMr. Gataker had not entered the premises before, nor had he the slightest\nknowledge that there was any water there ; I therefore proposed to the\nowner of the lawn to put him to a severe test as to his powers of divining. I\ncarefully blindfolded him, and in order to prevent his injuring himself\nfastened a rope to his arm, and held it loosely in my hand ; he was then\nasked to walk about and see if there was any water to be found. Imme\ndiately, when he walked over the spring, which lies about three or four feet\ndeep, the rod revolved, and whilst still blindfolded he traced its passage most\naccurately across the lawn. At a recent meeting of the Bath Field Club to\nwitness some experiments by a \" Water Dowser,\" we asked him to walk on\n\fXXXII.] 187\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\na row of bottles, which were placed over a spring, and which was known to be\nthere. When he was quite insulated by these bottles, the rod ceased to\nrevolve, and several members of the Club were under the impression that\nthe bottles acting as non-conductors prevented the current of electric fluid,\nor whatever it may be, from passing into the dowser's body. I therefore put\nMr. Gataker to a similar test, but with him the rod revolved as well with\nas without the intervention of the bottles ; this seems to indicate Mr.\nGataker's great susceptibility to the influence.\nMy neighbour and those present on this occasion feel convinced that Mr.\nGataker has the power of water-finding in a remarkable degree, and we hope\nthat he may be successful in making it his profession.\nA. A. Mantell, M.D.\nThe foregoing letter illustrates how necessary it is to guard against\ngiving unconscious indications and suggestions, which may account\nfor the dowser's success on this occasion. The failure of the insulation\ntest corroborates what has already been said about the fallacy of this\nexperiment.\nNo 129.\u2014The next letter to Mr. Gataker is the result of work\ndone on the Duke of Devonshire's Estate.\nChatsworth, Chesterfield, June 22nd, 1895.\nYou stated that you believed we should mid water at a depth of between\n60 and 70 feet. We found a supply at 69 feet, and there is every probability\nthat it will be sufficient for the requirements of the farm.\nYou are no doubt aware that we had previously sunk a well to a consider\nable depth without success.\nI was much surprised to find that you first indicated the locality of water\nwith your hands and no rod, only using the rod as a secondary aid to confirm\nyour indication. Gilson Martin.\nIn reply to my enquiries Mr. Martin writes :\u2014\nChatsworth, Chesterfield, January 14M, 1897.\nMr. Gataker's statements enclosed are quite correct. The well which\nwas sunk before he came was, so far as I remember, about 45 feet deep ; the\nwell which proved successful was about 300 yards from the useless one, and\nupon much higher ground. GlLSOn Mamik\nMr. Martin adds that he has increased the cheque due to Mr.\nGataker, as he was so gratified with the success attained.\nFailures.\nI have received reports, but no details, of several failures on the\npart of Mr. Gataker. I spoke to Mr. Gataker about these when he\ncalled upon me in Dublin, and he frankly said there was no doubt ho\n\f188 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nwas occasionally wrong, but he did not think his failures averaged\nmore than 10 per cent, of his total engagements. He told me he kept\na careful record of all his work, and he had, as I had requested, gone\nover all his cases to find the number of failures of which he had heard,\nwith the result stated. This statement I have, of course, no means of\nverifying.\nThe Rev. A. T. Fryer sends me some particulars of the failure of\nGataker and H. W. Mullins to find water for a Brewery near Bath,\nbut I cannot ascertain which of the two dowsers was really at fault,\nas it appears the well was sunk, not on the spot where both dowsers \u2014\nindependently of each other\u2014agreed there was a spring, but at a spot\nwhere one said there was a spring and the other said there was not.\nIn the Richmond Experiments which follow, Gataker and H. W.\nMullins were also employed, with the result described below.\nIt will have been noticed on a preceding page (p. 173), that Mr.\nGataker sends an assistant when he cannot go himself. These\nassistants Mr. Gataker professes \" to train \" for a fee. If there is a\npeculiar instinct, or faculty, for finding underground water, such as\nthe dowsers themselves claim to possess, this so-called \" training \" is a\npiece of the charlatanism which crops out in so many of these \" water-\nexperts.\" Here, for example, is an extract from the Richmond Times,\nof January 11th, 1896, where an account is given of Mr. Gataker's\ndowsing for water at Richmond, as fully detailed in the \" Richmond\nExperiments,\" which follow. The account, the editor informed me, was\nwritten by an experienced reporter, who states that\n' ' Mr. Gataker was closely questioned as to whether the stream of\nrunning water in the channel of the adit might not affect his judgment. To\nthis he replied most positively in the negative, saying that it might affect\nthe twig, but that by ' a new dodge ' which he had discovered about ten\nmonths ago, in working with his hands, he could absolutely eliminate that\ndisturbing influence. He could also discriminate between natural and\nartificial currents, and could even tell if there were two springs, one\nimmediately beneath the other, and could divine the depth and quantity\nof each.\"\nThis is the sort of thing that can only provoke well-deserved\ncontempt.\nThe Richmond Experiments.\nAmong the more extensive and costly series of experiments made\nto test the value of the \" divining rod \" as a means of finding under\nground water, must be included those carried out at Richmond,\nSurrey, in the spring of 1896. Though the results were only of\n\fXXXII.] 189\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\ntransient success, the experiments derive additional interest from the\nfollowing facts :\u2014\n(1) Prior to the \"diviners'\" visit, a series of borings for water\nhad ineffectually been made ; (2) the independent opinions of two\ndifferent \"diviners\" were obtained; (3) a full record of the experi\nments, as they took place, was published from time to time in the local\nnewspapers ; and (4) the opinion of the highest geological authorities\non underground water was also obtained and borings made according\nto their directions. It will be necessary, therefore, to consider this case\nat some length, the more so as public attention was widely called to\nthese experiments by the reports in the London papers which will be\nquoted presently.\nIt appears that the water supply of Richmond is derived from wells,\nbut was found inadequate to the growing needs of the township.\nAttempts to increase the supply were made, whereupon a corres\npondence arose in the local newspaper suggesting that the aid of the\n\" divining rod \" should be called in. The whole question was discussed\nby the \"Water Supply Committee of the Borough, who, however, could\nnot officially take so novel a course ; but the chairman of the committee,\nMr. T. H. Watney, acting upon the suggestion of the editor of the\nRichmond Times, undertook in his private capacity to defray the cost\nof putting the \" divining rod \" to the test. Arrangements were\ntherefore made for two \" dowsers \" to come to Richmond. The\ndowsers selected were unfortunately two young and comparatively\nunproved men.\nIn the Richmond Times of January 11th, 1896, a lengthy and\nadmirable report is given of the search for water by the two young\n\"diviners,\" who were first Mr. H. W. Mullins and afterwards Mr.\nGataker. From this report I condense the following :\u2014\nThe water hitherto obtained from the chalk at Richmond is taken from\na depth of over two hundred feet, and as there appeared to be no record of\nthe divining rod being influenced at so great a distance, it was determined to\ntake the diviners or dowsers down the Borough well and along the adits, of\nwhich there are some miles. It was decided that the two \" dowsers \" should\nmake independent examinations on different days, and that the first report\nshould be kept secret till after the other had been obtained. Accordingly on\nDecember 11th, 1895, \" Messrs. Mullins \" came as requested. Before going\ndown the well Mullins showed the use of the rod on the surface of the\nground. At one spot it was found to twist violently, Mr. Mullins stating that\nwater was to be found not far from the surface at that spot. Mr. Peirce, of\nthe Borough water works, confirmed this, stating a water pipe passed under\nthe ground there only a few feet down. Mr. Mullins had no previous\nknowledge of this fact. The party then went down the well and spent some\nhours exploring the adits, Mullins walking in front carrying the forked twig.\nThe indications of the rod, he said, were against a good supply. One place,\n\f190 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nhowever, was better and the quantity promised went as high as 1,000 or\n1,500 gallons a day, the other places much less. In all some thirty places\nwere indicated by the \"diviner,\" but Mr. Mullins repeatedly said, \"I\ncannot hold out any hopes of large quantities of water.\" The depth to be\nsunk he estimated at from thirty to seventy feet. Mr. Peirce marked the\nplaces indicated.\nThree weeks later Mr. Gataker made his examination. Here a noticeable\ndifference was observed in Gataker's method of working, as compared with\nMullins'. He discarded the twig or any other artificial aid whatever, and\nsimply walked about with his arms held stiffly down by his sides, the palms\nspread outward. There were consequently no outward manifestations to\nindicate the supposed presence or absence of water beneath the ground, and\nit was necessary to take his word entirely for the matter. A twig, however,\nwas carried by his pupil who accompanied him, and by its lively dippings and\ntwistings sustained the divinations of the master. As before, the party, after\ndescending the well, tramped for some hours through adit after adit, until\nGataker had explored every portion of the workings. The results were\nrather startlingly different to those obtained per Mullins. Gataker marked\nmany more points than the other, and he predicted for each a vastly larger\nflow. The range of depth at which water would be obtained was, in his\nopinion, from 50 to 200 feet below the floor of the adit. In one or two cases\nhis points tallied almost exactly with those of Mr. Mullins, and in several\nother cases they were within a few feet, but this could not be said of the\ngreat majority. Altogether he marked 55 places where a good supply\ncould be obtained at an average depth of t>0 feet ; the points marked\nwere distributed pretty equally all over the present headings. The total\ndaily supply he predicted would be 277,000 gallons. It should be added\nthat one of the members of the Richmond Town Council, who accompanied\nthe party, found the \"twig \" moved in his hands, also at some of the points\nwhich were indicated by Gataker as likely to yield the best supply.\nIn the Thames Valley Times of January 15th, 1896, a week after Mr.\nGataker's visit, is a report of a meeting of the Richmond Town Council,\nwhen the chairman of the water committee announced that borings\nhad been made at a spot indicated by both the diviners, working\nindependently of one another, one stating water would be found at a\ndepth of 50 feet, the other 30 to 50 feet, the former naming 800\ngallons a day as the yield, the latter 7,000. Water to the extent of\n8,000 gallons a day was actually found here at a depth of 21 J feet.\nPublic attention was directed to the matter by the following notice in\nthe London Times of January 17th, 1896 :\u2014\nA supply of water, estimated at about 8,000 gallons a day, has just been\ntapped at Richmond in somewhat remarkable circumstances. For some time\npast extensive borings have been made in the adits of the Richmond-terrace-\ngardens well, but with comparatively little success. Last week two \" water\ndiviners,\" named Gataker and Mullins, visited the well, and both predicted\nthat water would be found at certain indicated spots, the former alleging that\nby making 50 borings, at a cost of about \u00a3800, an enormous supply might\n\fxxxii.] On tfte So-called Divining Rod. 191\nbe obtained, worth to the town about \u00a35,000 a year, on the Southwark and\nVauxhall valuation. On Monday last it was decided to begin boring at a\npoint where both the \" diviners \" predicted a find, from 30 feet to 50\nfeet below. At a depth of about 20 feet a spring was tapped which is\nyielding 8,000 gallons a day. The experiments have been carried out at the\nexpense of Councillor Watney, and he has undertaken to bear the cost of\nfurther borings at other points indicated by the water-finders.\nThe Standard of the same date also had the following :\u2014\nA remarkable discovery of water by the aid of professional water-finders\nhas just occurred at Richmond, Surrey. The Corporation have had wells\nsunk to a considerable depth to procure water sufficient to meet the\nrequirements of the borough, and a supply, which for the past five or six\nweeks averaged 233,000 gallons per day, was discovered. Further borings\nfor a greater yield have, however, been attended with little success. Last\nweek two water diviners, named Gataker and Mullins, visited the Terrace-\ngardens Well, and indicated a number of places in the adits at which they\nalleged water would be found. The former stated that by making about\n50 borings at indicated spots a supply of water would be found worth about\n\u00a35,000 a year to the town, on the valuation of the Southwark and Vauxhall\nCompany. This suggestion was acted upon, and when the boring reached\nabout 20 feet, a spring of water was tapped yielding about 8,000 gallons\nper day.\nThe local newspaper, in commenting on these facts, states that\nthe finding of the water may be merely a coincidence, though a large\nnumber of borings had been previously made with practically no\nresult. It also points out that the \" dowsers \" worked under\nconditions entirely new to them, not on the surface of the ground, but\nin tunnels far underground, with water probably all round them.\nThe editor and proprietor of the Richmond Times, Mr. F. \\V.\nDimbleby, J.P., in reply to my enquiries (1) as to the accuracy of\nthe reports in his newspaper, and (2) as to evidence of any previous\nboring for water being made prior to the use of the \" divining rod,\"\nwrites :\u2014\nRichmond, Surrey, February 5th, 1896.\n(1) You may entirely rely upon the reports referred-to. Being interested\nin the matter (as a former member of the Water Supply Committee of the\nCorporation), I went down the well with Mullins myself, so that the part of\nthe report referring to his visit is my own work. The part relating to\nGataker was written by my chief reporter, an experienced and reliable\nman.\n(2) By this post I send you another paper of mine, the Thames Valley\nTimes of January 15th, which answers your question as to previous\nunsuccessful attempts to find water, and shows that a supply has now been\nobtained at the spot indicated by Gataker and Mullins. I should add,\nhowever, that since that date the yield of 8,000 gallons a day has greatly\n\f192 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\ndiminished. This usually happens when a fissure is tapped, and the water\n\" backed up \" in it has had time to run away.\n(3) Gataker paid us another visit on January 23rd, as reported in the\nRichmond and Twickenham Times of January 25th, also sent by this post.\nWe have now had three visits in all, at a cost (including expenses) of from\nten to fifteen guineas each, and as the work has been done very thoroughly\nby two independent men, both well-known as expert \" water-finders,\" it does\nnot appear to me to be necessary to go further until the reports of Mullins\nand Gataker have been fully tested. -c, ,,, ~\nJ Fredk. vV. Dimbleby.\nThe newspaper of January 15th, referred to in the above letter,\ncontained the following extract from the official report of the\nBorough Engineer to the Town Council as to previous borings to\nfind water :\u2014-\nDuring the past five weeks the workmen have been engaged boring in the\nadits in various directions 624 feet, viz., 179\u00a3 feet horizontally, six holes from\n7 to 70 feet, 248 vertically (downwards), seven holes 13 to 80 feet in depth\n(since increased to 88 feet), 196J feet inclined upwards, thirteen holes 8 to\n20 feet, yielding a very little water.\nThe local paper of January 25th states that the supply of 8,000\ngallons from the boring made at the place indicated by both Gataker\nand Mullins had diminished, as was usual in newly tapped chalk\nsprings, to 5,000 or 6,000 gallons. Concerning Gataker's second visit\non January 23rd, the Richmond Times of that week gives a detailed\naccount which I here condense :\u2014\nAt more than one point Gataker's \" divinings \" were in close proximity\nto the places previously marked by Mullins and the depths given approxi\nmately equal. At two points where bore holes had been sunk and only a\nmoderate supply obtained, Gataker advised deepening the holes to the limit\nnamed in his former predictions, viz., about 80 feet. In the south adit\nGataker estimated the depth of water as greater, reaching from 100 to 150\nfeet, and in one place as probably 200 feet. At the next point reached, five men\nwere then engaged in sinking a bore hole at the place Gataker had previously\nmarked, a depth of 63 feet had been reached and no spring as yet tapped.\nGataker advised going down to at least 80 feet, which was also the limit\nhe had given on his previous visit. Two other places where borings were\ngoing on Gataker also advised that the bore holes should be carried deeper.\nCommenting on this visit the same paper remarks :\u2014\nThe result of the inspection may be described as fairly satisfactory.\nThere are certain points of difficulty in connection with the experiments,\nwhich cause a critical test to be arrived at less easily than would otherwise\nbe the case, and tend to lessen the practical value of the method. Chief\namongst these may be mentioned the apparent impossibility of fixing the\nexact spot, to a foot or two, where water may be found, and as the diameter\nof the bore-hole is only about four inches, a slight error in giving the precise\n\fXXXII.] 193\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\npoint might render that particular bore-hole useless. But notwithstanding\nthese difficulties, a sufficient prima facie case has been made out to justify\nMr. Watney proceeding with these experiments, which he is carrying out at\nhis own expense.\nMy friend, Mr. W. Whitaker, F.R.S., F.G.S., who is well known\nboth as an eminent geologist and authority on underground waters,\nwrites in answer to enquiries as to his opinion of the foregoing\nreportsi :\u2014\nSouthampton, January 28th, 1896.\nI know the Richmond waterworks, having been all along the underground\ngalleries, etc , on two occasions. ... As the two \"rodders\" were more\nor less surrounded with water, their rods ought to have been twiddling\neverywhere ! I enclose the Engineer's answer to a letter of mine which\nlowers the reported success.\nThe enclosure is as follows :\u2014\nBorough Waterworks Office, Richmond, Surrey,\nJamiary 22nd, 1896.\nWith regard to the divining rod reported in the London press, too much\nhas been put forward. The truth is our new chairman has engaged both\nMr. Mullins and Mr. Gataker at his own expense, to prove whether\nthere is any power of proving water springs, as had been suggested in our\nlocal paper by one who had seen the rod used. We have not yet had much\nfrom the experiment ; that reported was at a spot where both the diviners\nsaid there was water and so we bored a threo-inch hole ; it has now very\nsensibly diminished. We have benefited most by the adit driving and must\ngo in for more, that being the only sure method of getting water here.\nW. G. Pbirce.\nThe next information comes from the local newspapers of February\n8th, 1896, as follows :\u2014\nWe are compelled to mention to-day, and we do it with no small regret,\nthat the prospect of obtaining any greatly increased supply of water from the\nRichmond well through the assistance of the \" water diviners \" has darkened\nthis week considerably. The bore-hole in the south adit, at which during\neach of his visits Mr. Gataker has so confidently promised that a supply of\nfive to six thousand gallons a day would be found within the extreme limit of\na depth of 100ft., has been abandoned after being driven to a depth of 125ft.\nwithout producing a drop. This is the second of Mr. Gataker's points that\nhave been tested, the first being that at which an additional supply of 8,000\ngallons a day was tapped, but quickly ran itself off. However, in the\nabsence of any other guide as to desirable localities, some more of the points\nindicated by Mr. Gataker and Mr. Mullins, where borings havo already\nbegun, will be thoroughly tested.\ni 1 am indebted to the Rev. Osmond Fisher, M.A., for this information.\nO\n\f194 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nProbably the bore-hole referred to above was the one at which the\nfive men were working in the previous report which Gataker advised\nto be sunk to at least 80 feet ; otherwise there seems a discrepancy\nin the statements, as in the south adit the reporter stated previously\nthat Gataker advised boring to some 150 feet or even deeper in\none place.\nA month later, at a meeting of the Richmond Town Council,\nreported in the Thames Valley Times, of March 11th, 1896, the\nborough engineer reported as follows :\u2014\nDuring the past four weeks the workmen have been engaged boring in the\nadits at various places indicated by Messrs. Mullins and Mr. Gatalter, 409^ft.\nin all, viz., thirteen bore-holes completed and in hand, varying from 10\\it. to\n125ft. in depth, yielding 220 gallons of water per day. Messrs. Mullins\nestimated 1,500 gallons per day, and Mr. L. Gataker 30,000 gallons per day,\nat the places selected and depths bored during the past month.\nSix feet of adit driving in the North-East Adit has been completed, and a\nbore-hole put down to the depth advised by Mr. L. Gataker, but without\nresult as regards an increase of water.\nThe total quantity of water pumped from the Terrace Gardens and Water-\nlane wells during the past four weeks has been fi, 464,670 gallons, averaging\n230,881 gallons per day.\nCouncillor Watney said he was afraid he had very little to report in\nregard to the work at the well. He regretted that there was a decreased\nsupply this month of water pumped from the well. They had been most\nunsuccessful during the past month in tapping any new fissures or supplies of\nwater. He was not going himself to he a prophet, or to predict what would\nhappen in the future. He desired to remind the Council that, although not\nmentioned in his report, the period of his three months' holiday at the well\nwould expire before the next Council meeting. He thought if they would\nallow him, he would go on with his experiments until the next Council\nmeeting, when he would ask leave to continue for another three months.\u2014It\nwas resolved that Councillor Watney's application should be acceded to.\nIn Notes and Queries of April 25th, 1896, there is a letter from the\nBorough Engineer, who writes as follows to a correspondent of that\njournal :\u2014\nThe diviners' success was of short duration ; the one bore-hole that\nyielded 8,000 gallons a day on the first day, gradually fell off and was\nexhausted at the end of the week. About 22 bore-holes have been driven to\nthe directions with a very small increase in the quantity of the water.\nW. G. Pbirce.\nWriting to me on October 2nd, 1896, Mr. Dimbleby says, in\nanswer to my enquiry :\u2014\nMr. Watney is still carrying on the boring operations at his own expense,\npending an application to the Local Government Board by the Corporation,\nfor power to borrow more money for these works. Small fissures, yielding\n\fXXXII.] 195\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nvery small quantities of water are frequently met with, but no large increase\nin the supply has been obtained. Fredk W Dimbleby.\nFinally, the same kind correspondent, in reply to my recent en\nquiries, writes on May 24th, 1897 :\u2014\n14, King Street, Richmond, Surrey, May 24t\/i, 1897.\nThe Richmond Corporation have now resumed the boring works on their\nown account ; the Local Government Board having, after a public inquiry,\nsanctioned a further loan of \u00a35,000 for this purpose.\nNo reliance is now placed on the advice of the so-called \"water-finders.\"\nI send you the last report of the Water Committee, dated May 4th, 1897,\nand also the one for the previous year. Feedk W Dimbleby.\nIn the last report of the Water Committee it is stated that the\ntotal length of adits driven is 6,991 feet; \"one fairly good fissure,\npassed on April 8th, still keeps up the yield of 5,846 gallons per\nday . . . The total quantity pumped from the wells during the\npast four weeks averaging 225,848 gallons per day.\" Though this is a\nless amount than that given above for the preceding year, yet, as the\nreport shows, a regular increase in the water supply has been obtained\nin proportion to the length of adits driven. The cost of the wells and\nadit driving at Richmond has been considerable. The Water\nCommittee's report shows that the Water-lane wells and bore-hole cost\n\u00a320,753 ; the Terrace Gardens well, adits and boring, cost \u00a316,590, or\na total of \u00a337,343.i Of this, Mr. Watney has refunded \u00a3670, the\nexpense only incurred up to March 31st, 1896, in his public-spirited\nexperiments.\nWith regard to these experiments, it is greatly to be regretted that\nJohn Mullins was not available. But Mullins was not living when\nhis \"firm\" were invited, and nothing could be more misleading\nthan the practice adopted by \" Messrs. J. Mullins and Sons,\" of\nsending out a book of testimonials, which chiefly relate to their father's\nsuccess, and not stating the fact that their father is dead. The public\nignorance of the whole subject, which ignorance this paper will, I hope,\nin some measure dispel, is, however, the most fruitful source of errors\nlike the preceding. The respective qualifications of various dowsers\nshould be ascertained from independent evidence, or their work paid\nfor in proportion to the success achieved.\ni Nevertheless, as the report shows, the actual cost to the ratepayers is less than if\nthey had bought the water from the London water companies.\nO 2\n\f196 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nGroup IX.\u2014(a) Mr. H. Bacon.\nI heard of this dowser, who lives at Newport, Essex, through Mr.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers. In reply to my enquiries, he sent me several\ntestimonials from those for whom he had successfully found water by\nthe divining-rod. In some of these cases Mr. Bacon tells me that\nattempts to find water by sinking or boring had been mode unsuccess\nfully before his visit to the place. Stagnant water he cannot detect,\nonly running water, and he says it is a matter of indifference to him\nwhether he goes over the ground at day or night ; or whether blind\nfolded or not. Having seen a dowser at work some five years ago, he\ntried, and found the forked twig moved with him ; hence, he was led\nto take up this business. According to his own statement,\u2014which\nmust be taken for what it is worth,\u2014he has never had a failure,\nthough he admits he is sometimes mistaken in estimating the depth\nand the volume of the spring. When over an underground spring\nhe states that the rod revolves strongly, and \" I begin to shake from\nhead to foot ; in fact, I shake so much that often my knees begin to\nknock together.\"\nAmong Mr. Bacon's testimonials are letters from Lord Calthorpe's\nagent, from Sir Walter Gilbey, Bart., from Hudson's Breweries, etc.\nMr. Hudson writes that he was \" previously very sceptical, but the\nproof of the pudding is the eating,\" a good supply of water being\nobtained on his premises at 19 feet deep ; whereas in the immediate\nneighbourhood (according to Bacon's statement to me) a deeper well\nhad been sunk prior to his visit with no result.\nNo. 130.\u2014I am indebted to Mr. J. Christian Smith, the Clerk of\nthe Works on Colonel Houblon's estate in Essex, for the following\ninteresting facts :\u2014\nGreat Hallingbury. Bishop's Stortford, Essex, December 1st, 1896.\nI have pleasure in giving you some particulars of water-finding by the\ndivining rod on the estate of Col. G. B. A. Houblon, Essex.\nWe were making extensive alterations in the year 1893 at Threenhall\nPriory, Essex, which necessitated a new water supply. We looked about for\nwhat we thought was a suitable place to have a well sunk ; we proceeded to a\nconsiderable depth without any signs of a supply. We then resorted to the\ndivining rod, and sent for a Mr. Stone out of Northamptonshire.i By the aid\nof his rod he informed us where we should find a good supply of water ; the\ndepth he could not give, but did not think it was very deep. He also traced\nthe direction the spring took. We sank at the point indicated, at the depth\nof 38 feet. The spring proved to be so strong that it rose and filled the\n[} Now of Spilsby, Lincolnshire. See Group V.]\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 197\nwell nearly full. It was only about twenty yards from the well we had\npreviously sunk and failed ; the nearer Mr. Stone went with his rod to this,\nthe weaker the latter became.\nThe latest experience we have had was with Bacon. I took him to several ,\nplaces where we were anxious to obtain a supply of water. I am pleased to\nsay that those places we have tried have been most successful. The first\nwell we sank was 20 feet deep ; at this depth we obtained an excellent supply,\nindeed, it has been up to the top. The second well we obtained a bountiful\nsupply at 53 feet deep ; standing supply, 17 feet. This well was sunk within\n200 yards of the old well, where there was an inefficient supply after being\nbored (depth of sinking, 30 feet).\nBacon informed me that he invariably finds that the springs run from\neast to west, or vice versa ; he, therefore, carries in his pocket a small\ncompass, so that he may be enabled to cross the spring ; walking as the\nspring runs, he says, punishes him more than he can bear.\nIf I can be of any further service, I shall esteem it a great pleasure.\nJohn Christian Smith.\nIn answer to my further specific enquiries, Mr. J. C. Smith writes :\u2014\nGreat Hallingbury, Bishop's Stortford, December 7th, 1896.\nBacon is, I understand, a clever mechanic, and at the present time acting\nas foreman to a local builder, unknown to me, until this year, when his\nservices were required. Living near, and hearing of his successes, we were\ninduced to try him.\n(No. 1.) The exact locality of this estate is about 28 miles north-east of\nLondon, 20 miles south of Cambridge, 5 miles west of Great Dunmow,\n1 mile east of Bishop's Stortford.\n(No. 2.) Bacon's trials were on the same estate, about four miles distant\nfrom Threenhall Priory, where Stone was. I do not think water is likely to\nbe found anywhere.\n(No. 3.) The well [at Threenhall Priory] was sunk to the depth of twenty-\neight feet only, with no signs of water, nothing but boulder clay coming out.\nStone went over this, \" said we should never find any water there ;\" the\nnearer he came to it from the present spring, the weaker did the crutch\n[effect] become.\n(No. 4.) I cannot say how deep the old 30 ft. well had been bored.\nWhen we were anxious to get a better supply here we examined this, and\nfound that a false bottom of wood had been put in and the bore hole plugged\nup ; we concluded that the boring had taken away the little water there was,\nand had to be plugged up again. Bacon went all round this, but could find\nno trace of water. John Christian Smith.\nAgain my correspondent kindly replies :\u2014\nGreat Hallingbury, December 12th, 1896.\nI have no hesitation in saying that my experience proves that the\nindication of the rod has enabled us to find water when other means had\nfailed.\n\f198 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nI am trying to get at the depth of the boring of that well ; if 1 succeed I\nwill inform you. [In a subsequent note I am informed it was 50 feet deep.]\nI mentioned in my previous letter to you that I took Bacon all round this\nold well, in hopes that we might find water near to the dwelling house, but\nthere was not the slightest indication of his rod moving.\nThe 28 feet well does refer to the one we sank at Threenhall Priory with\nout success. The 38 feet well, sunk where Stone indicated, where an\nabundant supply was obtained, was about 20 yards distant. At the 28 feet\nwell Stone went over and around. He said, \" You may go as deep as you\nlike, you will get no water there.\" We therefore abandoned it.\nThe nearer he came to the unsuccessful one, the weaker the indication\nbecame, losing it entirely before he got to that well.\nw\n20 yards\nUnsuccessful O\nE\nI can only add my experience of this method of finding water has been\nhighly successful on this estate. In the future there is not the least doubt\nwe shall resort to the same methods ; not having a single failure gives us\nevery confidence.

Bacon informed me he had found a considerable\nunderground spring at 18 feet deep, not far from a useless well which\nwas deeper than this. Mr. Baxendale's reply to my enquiry is as\nfollows :\u2014\n1, Sloane Gardens, S.W., December 2nd, 1896.\nIn answer to yours of 30th, Bacon was a very satisfactory \" water\ndiviner.\"\nI went down to see him \"divine,\" and he \" found water \" at about the\ndepth he mentions, on the top of a hill, which looks down east and west on\nthe source of the Cam, the \"Bench Mark\" at the top being 321-5. There\nwas a waterless well very near.i\nAfter this we went to look for water near some cottages, and he marked\na spot where he said water would be found, but in my absence my tenant\nthought that ho could make one well do for two sets of cottages\u2014sunk a well\nsome 70 yards to the north of the place marked by Bacon, and found much\ni Subsequently Mr. Baxendale tells me this was not a well, but a very deep pond,\n18 feet deep.

The rod\nindicated a strong spring at a certain spot where it was decided to\nsink a well. I wrote to Mr. Blyth, of Tolleshunt D'Arcy, who had\ntaken an interest in the matter, who replies as follows :\u2014\nOxley Lodge, T'Darcy, Witham, Essex, May 17th, 1897.\nWe have not yet bored, but have driven a tube to a depth of 27 feet with\nno result. It is a difficult matter to move a Parish Council to bore where\nthey have always been told there can bo no water. They fear a failure and\nalso a surcharge by the auditor. But if they will not move, I shall try on\nmy own account, and will then let you know the result.\nFred. W. Blyth.\nSo far, therefore, this may be taken as a failure by Bacon : other\nlike cases of his doubtless exist of which I have not heard.\n(6) Mr. H. Chesterman.\nAmong the many West of England dowsers is Mr. H. Chesterman,\nof Bath, who states\u2014in the course of a lengthy account he has sent me\n\u2014that 30 years ago he found he had the \" gift \" of dowsing, and has\nbeen, to some extent, engaged as a \" water expert \" ever since, though\nit is not the business of his life, his occupation being keeper of some\nrecreation grounds in Bath. Mr. Chesterman, like the late Mr.\nLawrence, prefers to use a loop of wire instead of a forked twig when\ndowsing, and states that when approaching an underground spring he\nexperiences :' a peculiar sensation, like an electric shock, creeping up\nthe hands and arms, becoming more violent when directly over the\nhidden spring ; the wider the space over which the shock is felt the\nnearer the spring is to the surface, and the smaller the space the\ndeeper the spring.\" Mr. Chesterman also adds that he has made a\nscale by which he can approximately tell the depth of the spring ; this\nhe has described at length to me ; an account of it is also given in the\nGentleman's Journal for October 1st, 1896, but it is of no value to any\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 201\none but himself, and not much to himself, judging from Mr. Cree's\nexperience given below.\nLike other dowsers, Mr. Chesterman states that the rod ceases to\nmove, and the sensation he experiences is completely cut off, when he\nis insulated on glass vessels. Again, like others, Chesterman\nfinds that when he holds the wrist of a person, in whose hands the rod\nwould not previously move, then the rod or wire instantly revolves if\n\u2022over a spring. This transference of what is apparently involuntary\nmuscular action is doubtless an effect of suggestion, which plays so\nlarge a part in the present as in the past history of the divining rod.\nLike other dowsers, also, Chesterman believes the faculty of dowsing\nis hereditary ; out of his seven children he tells me five have the \" gift.\"\nHe claims to have \" trained \" Mr. Gataker in the proper use of the\ngift he possessed, just as Mr. Gataker offers to train other appren\ntices\u2014for a substantial fee. The utter nonsense of this so-called\ntraining is obvious enough.\nI am indebted to Mr. Cree, of Over Moigne, near Dorchester, for\ngiving me particulars of an abundant supply of water found for him by\nChesterman ; but though geological information had been obtained,\n-and a well dug unsuccessfully prior to the dowser's visit, yet the case is\nof no evidential value, as the unsuccessful well was only a third of the\n\u2022depth of Chesterman's well. Moreover, Chesterman's prediction of the\ndepth of the spring was completely wrong, the prediction being 20 feet,\nthe actual depth double this. At the same time I believe Chesterman\nhas been much more successful in other instances.\nI have to thank Mr. Chesterman for kindly coming to London\nfrom Bath at his own expense to exhibit his method of dowsing before\nthe members of the S. P. R., when this paper was read.\n(c) Mr. P. Rodwell.\nAnother dowser is the lad who bears the appropriate name of\nFred Rodwell, and who came into some notoriety a few years ago\nthrough the animadversion of Professor Ray Lankester.\nRodwell is the son of a mining engineer and surveyor, living in\nWensley, Yorkshire, and in this case the use of the rod has chiefly\nbeen for the purpose of finding mineral veins. I shall, therefore,\nreserve the evidence of Rodwell's success in this direction to the next\npart of my paper. I have before me an extensive correspondence,\u2014\npartly addressed to me and partly to Mr. Vaughan Jenkins,\u2014 from\nthe father and other friends of young Rodwell, relating the tests to\nwhich the lad was subjected in his search for minerals, till at last he\nwas regularly employed by the Grinton Mining Company to prospect\n\f202 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nfor mineral lodes on their property. The Graphic of November 2nd,\n1889, gave an account of the lad and a wood cut illustrating his method\nof procedure. From this account the following extract is taken.\n\" Not long ago there was a long and animated correspondence in the\nStandard on the use of the 'divining rod' for finding water and minerals.\nA good many of the writers held that it was a mere superstition, handed\ndown from the dark ages, and that the belief in it was due to a few\naccidental successes on the part of the water-finders. On the other side,\nhowever, a multitude of evidence was adduced showing that there are certain\npersons who do possess this peculiar faculty. One such is the lad named\nRodwell. He is in the employment of the Grinton Mining Company in the\nNorth of England, and according to the chairman of the company has never\nfailed when tested. Wherever he has indicated the presence of water or\nminerals, at that very spot a spring or lode has been discovered. He proceed*\nthus. Taking in his hands a light rod, or, if he has no rod, with his hands\nclasped in front of him, Rodwell walks about in likely places. As soon as\nhe steps over water or a mineral-vein the rod springs up to his breast, or the\nhands clench themselves immovably, and he cannot unclasp them till he\nmoves from the spot. The lad in whom this strange faculty has developed,\nis about 14 years of age. We are not told whether his peculiar employment\nhas any effect upon his health.\"\nFor the above wood cut, which illustrates young Rodwell at work\nas a dowser, I am indebted to the kindness of the proprietors of the\nG'raphk.\nNo. 132.\u2014The following letter relates to Rodwell in his capacity\nas a dowser for water.\nThe Grange, Aysgarth, Yorks., May 13th, 1893.\nIt may be interesting to you to know that there is a youth (Fred Rodwell\nby name), who has on three separate occasions found the eiaet locality of\nunderground water on my property. The first occasion was the location of\n\fXXXII.] 203\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nwater pipes underground, of the existence of which he could not possibly\nhave had any previous knowledge. The other two instances were the discovery\nof two powerful springs of water, one of which has since been taken for a\nvillage for the supply of 500 people, and in neither of these two cases was\nthere suspected or was there the least external appearance to indicate the\npresence of underground spring. These facts speak for themselves.\nJames C. Winn.\nI sent Mr. Winn the printed proof of the foregoing letter and\nasked him to correct any inaccuracies. Mr. Winn replies :\u2014\nThe Grange, Aysgarth, R.S.O., N. Yorks, June 10th, 1897.\nThe proof of my letter is absolutely correct in every particular. I believe\nRodwell is now residing at West Witton, near Leyburn, but I have no-\nparticulars of him recently. j p -yyInn\nThe evidence in my possession respecting Rodwell's water-finding\npower is very meagre and inconclusive ; he may have had more success\nof late, but of this I have not heard.\nThe following account of experiments I made with Rodwell at\nWTimbledon were conducted and recorded in the year 1890. Had I\nthen the information I now possess, I should hardly have selected this\nyoung dowser for the purpose of experiment.\nThe Wimbledon Experiments.\nI was anxious to obtain some direct experimental evidence of my\nown as to Rodwell's ability to find hidden water or metal. Accordingly\nI wrote to Dr. McClure, who is the Chairman of the Grinton Mining\nCompany in Yorkshire, and from whom I learnt that the lad was\nnot only employed by this Mining Company to seek for mineral lodes,\nbut according to Dr. McClure he was also under an engagement to go\nto Australia to \" dowse \" for water and minerals. Hence I arranged to\nexamine the alleged powers of the lad before he left England ; for\nthis purpose instead of going to Yorkshire, on ground with which\nRodwell was acquainted, my friend, Mr. R. S. Donkin, M.P., kindly\nallowed me to make use of his extensive private grounds on the edge\nof Wimbledon Common, where it is needless to say the lad had never\nbeen before. The experiments I am about to describe were made on\nJuly 17th, 1890.\nBefore Rodwell arrived from Yorkshire I went over the place care\nfully with the head gardener, and the various buried water pipes,drains,\ndisused wells, and underground springs were pointed out to me. On\nthe arrival of Rodwell, who was a fat heavy-looking youth, and who\nwas accompanied by Dr. McClure, I begged the lad to try first of all\n\f204 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nthe lawn beneath which (unknown of course to the lad or Dr. McClure)\n-a troublesome spring was known to exist.\nExperiment 1.\u2014Pulling from his pocket a bundle of small forked\nhazel twigs, he selected one and holding it in the usual way marched\nto and fro across the lawn ; presently the twig turned up and he\ndeclared there was a small spring below his feet. This was within a\nfoot of the right place and looked promising.\nExperiment 2. \u2014He then endeavoured to trace the course of the\nstream, which ran through drain pipes in a direction that had previously\nbeen pointed out to me, but here he blundered a good deal.\nExperiment 3.\u2014Next I told him to see if he could find any of the\nwater mains, and for this purpose to walk all round the grounds on the\npathway. He did so. I observed that as he walked along his eyes were\nconstantly on the alert, and when he came to a part of the gravel walk\nthat had lately been disturbed he said a pipe occurred there, but that\nthere was none under the path he had traversed. As a matter of fact\nthe pipe ran under his feet to the stables all the way he had gone, and a\nbranch had recently been taken off to a greenhouse at the only spot he\nstopped at. The test was therefore a complete failure ; he was correct\nonly where it was probable that plumbers had been at work.\nExperiment 4.\u2014He then tried the archery ground and orchard ; in\nthe latter an Abyssinian well had been sunk for water, but had been\nremoved, as a supply had not been obtained ; here the result was\ndoubtful, as I was unable to test his assertion.\nExperiment 5.\u2014He then went to the paddock, an extensive field\nwhere an old and long disused well existed. The grass had so com\npletely covered the site of the well that its position was hidden\nI todwell wandered over the field, but found no water. He was told to\nwalk in the direction where I knew the well existed ; he did so and\ncrossed and recrossed the site of the old well, but found no indications\nof water, though it is highly probable there was an abundance\nbelow ; a little further on, however, the twig bent strongly upward\nand he declared that there was a large supply of water under that spot.\nThe place was marked, and was subsequently tested by digging.\nExperiment 6. \u2014I now took the lad into the kitchen gardens where\na sunken tank full of water existed ; the tank was so well concealed\nbeneath the ground that its position could not be detected by the eye.\nHe walked twice over the place where the tank was buried, but gave\nno indication. I then told him what we were looking for and suggested\nhe should try again ; after moving slowly about, presently at a certain\nspot the twig turned and he said the tank was under that spot, but\nit certainly was not. This trial also was therefore a complete failure;\nit is fair to say dowsers state they cannot detect stagnant water.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 205\nExperiment 7.\u2014I now proposed to blindfold the lad and take him\nagain to the lawn and paddock to see if he indicated the same spots\nas when unblindfolded. But both Dr. McClure and Rodwell\nstrenuously opposed blindfolding. At last they gave way, but only\nupon my insistence.i For the purpose of blindfolding a quantity of\ncotton wool was placed over his eyes and on each side of the nose, and\nan ample cloth tied round his head. I then led him to the paddock\nand brought him near to the spot where he had found water before\n(Experiment 5) ; he traversed and re-traversed the spot where he had\npreviously located water, without giving any indication, and walked\nsome distance in the wrong direction, when he pulled the bandage off\nsaying he was too hot. I readjusted the bandage and told him to try\nagain ; this time the twig moved violently very near the spot he had\nlx^fore indicated. His hands appeared locked in a convulsive effort ;\nhe declared that he was perfectly sure that water was below, and he\nthought near the surface. With the permission of my host I caused a\nwell to be dug next day ; two men were employed, but after several\nhours' work, and a depth of about eight feet had been reached, no water\nwas found ; an unusual fact, as in that gravelly soil water springs\nabounded very near the surface.2\nExperiment 8.\u2014Finally I took the lad back to the lawn and told\nhim, when blindfolded, to find the spring he had previously discovered\n(Experiment 1). He crossed the lawn two or three times, going over\nthe right spot without giving any indication, and then fixed on another\nspot where it is true there might be a spring, but its existence was not\nknown, nor could it be ascertained without injury to the lawn.\nThis ended my experiments with llodwell ; as will be seen the\nresult was unsatisfactory, or to say the least inconclusive, and if I were\nto generalise from this one day's experiments, I should agree with\nProfessor Ray Lankester, who, the year previously, had\u2014 after a similar\nbut rather hasty trial with the same lad\u2014come to the conclusion\nthat the boy was a rank impostor, and \"the divining rod business of\ni Rodwell's father, in a lengthy letter which he addressed to Mr. Vaughan\nJenkins, and the latter sent on to me, explains the reluctance of the lad to be blind\nfolded as due to the harsh treatment he received at the hands of Prof. Ray Lankester,\nwho, according to Mr. Kodwell's statement, almost frightened the boy to death !\nHence Mr. Rodwell says, \" I charged my son never to submit to anything of the kind\nagain, and told Dr. McClure I would not allow it.\" It was for that rea.son, thinking\nI was about to treat him as a rogue and impostor, that they objected to the\nblindfolding.\n'* Subsequently I had the hole dug deeper and about two feet of water came into\nthe hole, but the gardener, an experienced man, told me that in the light sand and\ngravel soil that exists there, water would probably be found in any spot that was\ndug 10 or 12 ft. deep. It would, of course, have been better to sink deeper, but it\nseemed hardly worth going to the further exi>ense involved by so doing.\n\f206 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nthe same order as fortune telling.\" To generalise from a single\ninstance is, however, unphilosophical at all times and is absolutely\nforbidden in dealing with those problems which come within the scope\nof this Society.\nGroup X.\nWelsh Bowsers.\u2014(a) Mr. Thomas Heigiiway.\nMr. J. F. Young, of Llanelly, kindly sent me the name and\naddress of Mr. Heighway, who is a Welshman, the proprietor of the\nPark Pump Room, Llandrindod Wells. His father, John Heighway,\nwas, I believe, most successful as a dowser, but he does not write\nEnglish.\nMr. Thomas Heighway tells me when he is dowsing and gets over\nan underground spring his nervous system is so much affected that he\ndoes not recover from it for some hours ; he therefore does not care to\nuse the rod much ; his father does not suffer in the same way. I have\nnot much information of Mr. Heighway's experiences, but the following\nletters are interesting, and present a new aspect of the subject, viz.,\ndowsing for mineral springs.\nNo. 133.\u2014Mr. Heighway having referred me to Captain Penry\nLloyd, for whom he had recently found a sulphur spring, I wrote\nto Mr. Lloyd, and the following is his reply :\u2014\nGlasbury, R.S.O., Radnorshire, February 27th, 1897.\nI have only one fact of evidential value regarding the use of the rod, and\nthat is in the case of Mr. Thomas Heighway, of Llandrindod, Radnorshire,\nwho, in November last, discovered a sulphur spring on my land at Llanwrtyd,\nBreconshire, at a depth of 75 feet from the surface, 68 of which was\nsolid, tough clay. Directly we struck rock, we struck water, and,\ncuriously, on the very side of the well which Mr. Heighway had predicted,\nthe water bearing lode crossing the diameter (6 feet) of the well on the\nsouth half. From a profound sceptic, I am now a firm believer in the\npower of the rod. p\nCaptain Lloyd kindly sends the following additional particulars in\nreply to my enquiries :\u2014\nGlasbury, R.S.O., March loth, 1897.\n(1) I had been seeking for sulphur mineral water previous to the dowser's\nvisit, and failed to find the spring.\n(2) Mr. Heighway was engaged, and I went with him over the ground. He,\nwith the twig, soon found three several springs, and I selected the most\nsuitable for sinking, and found the water at 75 feet ; the vein of rock\ncarrying the water crossed the bottom of well from west to east, and if we\n\fxxxn.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 207\nhad sunk 3 feet more to the north, should have missed it. When about\n35 feet down he came again, and went down the well, and told me to mind\nand sink well to the south side, as the water was there. And he was quite\nright. He was confident from first to last, when I had given up all hopes.\nI am now sinking, on his advice, for a chalybeate spring, and we are now\ndown about 25 feet, but have not yet come to the rock. He also traced the\nsprings across the river, which runs near the well.\nThere is no doubt whatever as to his power, and he can distinguish\nbetween fresh water and mineral water.\nI enclose rough sketch and section (see next page). p T\nVICTORIA WELLS\nNOTe.\nt is where Mr. Heighway found sulphur spring, and followed it to No. 1 well.\nNo. 1.

Mr. Heighway's prophecy was,\n\" Chalybeate water, very strong spring,\" and ho has proved himself to be\ncorrect.\nI quite believe he has the power of distinguishing between mineral and\nplain water ; at all events, he has succeeded in many instances, and I have\nnot heard that he has been wrong once. He tells me he acquired the power\nby practising over known mineral springs, and finds that he is affected in\ndifferent ways. Mineral water, he says, has much more power over him, and\n\" draws stronger,'' and is more difficult to determine as to depth. He also\nsays that plain water intervening would not affect him, owing to the greater\nstrength of mineral. It is indeed a wonderful attribute of the human body,\nand he certainly is an exceptionally good subject. Penry Lloyd\nWriting again on May 14th, Mr. Lloyd says :\u2014\nGlasbury, May 14th, 1897.\nWe have just completed sinking No. 3 well, on the spot indicated by Mr.\nThomas Heighway, and found sulphur water 52 feet below surface, and\n6 feet down in the solid rock. P. Lloyd.\nOne interesting feature in the above letters will be noticed,\nnamely, that the prediction of the dowser in two of the cases was\ncommunicated to and received by me before the actual discovery of the\nmineral springs.\n\fXXXII.] 209\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\n(6) Mr. R. Rothwell.\nRothwell is a gardener living at Cardiff, (65, Upper George-street,\nCathays, Cardiff), and is, I believe, over 60 years of age. Our friend\nand fellow-worker, the Rev. A. T. Fryer, of Cardiff, to whom I am\nmainly indebted for the evidence concerning this dowser, knows\nRothwell, and was favourably impressed by his evident straight\nforwardness. The Vicar of the parish also writes in answer to\nenquiry, \" I know Rothwell well ; he is an excellent gardener, and\nquite trustworthy as far as I know.\"\nRothwell states that he experiences \" a slight tingling sensation\nwhen the rod bends, just the same as he has felt with an electric\nbattery.\" He determines the depth at which the water will be found\nby walking away from the supposed stream at right angles to its\ncourse ; the rod invariably bends with lessening force as he moves\naway. Directly the rod is stationary, Rothwell stops, and then\nmeasures the distance, from the spot at which the rod ceases to act,\nto the stream. This, he asserts, gives him the distance down.\nNo. 134. \u2014Mr. Lyddon, Rothwell's employer, sent Mr. Fryer the\nfollowing account of Rothwell's first essay at dowsing :\u2014\nBute Docks, CardifT, July 5th, 1893.\nA well had been sunk by the builder when my house was being erected,\nbut on my occupying the house the supply of water was found to be\ninsufficient ; not knowing where to sink a well, I was advised by a member\nof a large firm in Bristol to let one of his engineers, who had the power of\ndiscovering water by the aid of a divining rod, see if he could find\nwater by the aid of the rod. This person, a complete stranger to\nthe neighbourhood, came, and accompanied by W. Rothwell, my gardener,\nwent over my field. He told me I should find water in two places,\nat the extreme north end, and at a spot in the south end, and nowhere else.\nThere was nothing to show that water was underneath. The Bristol man\nadvised me to bore in the north corner of my field. I did this, and found\nwater, but not a good supply.\nRothwell, when accompanying the Bristol man, thought the whole thing\nridiculous, and had no faith in it, but after the departure of the man\nRothwell tried the rod, and to his surprise found that in his hands it moved\nas it did with the other person. With the aid of the rod he discovered\nanother spring, and considered I should find water, about 40 to 45 feet\ndown. I found some, I think at about 55 feet, and I believe a better supply\nwas obtained at 62 feet.\nRothwell has been in Cardiff many years, has worked for me three years,\nand is, I believe, a perfectly truthful man.\nThe 4J inch bore to the spring did not give us sufficient water, so on\nRothwell's advice I sank a well, and have now a good supply.\nE. T. Lyddon.\nP\n\f210 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett,\nNo. 135.\u2014The next letter is from Mr. James, of the Malting\nHouse, Cardiff, and Chepstow.\nCardiff, Jnne 30M, 1893.\nSome years since, I called in the services of a man named Lawrence, a\n\"diviner,\" in order to find, if possible, indications of water on property\nadjoining our Maltings, at Cardiff, with the result that he pointed out a spot\nat which water would be found at a depth of 20 to 25 feet.\nTwo years since I made the acquaintance of Rothwell, a gardener, in\nCardiff, who had very recently found out he possessed this \" gift.\" As I was\nanxious to test his powers and see if he could find the same spring which was\nindicated by Lawrence, he came up, and after carefully walking over the field,\nin a few minutes found the precise spot, but fixed the depth at 28 to 30 feet.\nSince then, we have followed up the course of this spring, which runs into\nproperty belonging to the Bute Docks Gas Works, the manager of which\nmformed us that when erecting a new gasometer two years ago, when about\n26 feet below the surface, they were unexpectedly flooded out by some spring\nbreaking up, which necessitated a steam pump to keep the water down\nwhilst certain work proceeded.\nWe have to-day finished sinking a well at the place indicated by the\ntwo diviners (Lawrence and Rothwell) and found a good spring\u2014even in\nthis severe drought\u2014in the upper strata of marl, at a depth of 18 to 24 feet.\nThe main spring is 18 feet below surface.\nYou will note the Bute Dock Gas Works found water at about 26 feet.\nThis may be explained by the stratum dipping very considerably as it nears\nthe sea-board.\nBeing successful at Cardiff, I took Rothwell up to Chepstow, at which\nplace we also have maltings, with result that he has pointed out a spot at\nwhich we may expect to find water at about 28 feet.\nWe commence operations next week, and shall be pleased to inform you\nof result later on. A A Jamm\nI wrote to Mr. James to enquire whether Rothwell had any\nmeans of ascertaining beforehand the site of the spring fixed on by\nLawrence.\nMr. James replied that the only information Rothwell had was\nthat Lawrence had somewhere indicated a certain spot where he said a\ngood spring of water would be found ; Rothwell was then left entirely\nto himself to locate the place, which he found within a few minutes, after\nwalking to and fro over the ground. Mr. James adds that Rothwell,\nso far as he knew, had never been in Chepstow before. Subsequently,\nin answer to enquiries whether water had been found at Chepstow at\nthe place indicated by Rothwell, Mr. James writes :\u2014\nThe Cardiff Malting Company, Limited, East Moors, Cardiff,\nSeptember 10th, 1896.\nAs regards the result of Rothwell's \" divining \" for water at Chepstow, in\n1893, we found, by sinking a 30 foot shaft of 4 foot diameter, water coming\nthrough the limestone at about 26 feet below the surface.\n\fXXXII.] 211\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nThe rock is hollowed out by the action of the water, which no doubt at\none time was a very strong spring\u2014but owing to the drought of the last two\nyears the supply has become limited, but the water is there.\nI may mention a fact which I learned a few days after his visit, the\nexistence of a disused well near the river Wye, within the old fortified town\nwall, on a direct line from our present well to the river, the course of which\nhe indicated exactly. A A JAMBs\nThe following letter was sent to the Rev. A. T. Fryer in answer to\nhis enquiries :\u2014\nSevern Side Brewery, Wick, Bridgend, May 22nd, 1897.\nI am in receipt of yours of the 20th inst., and in reply have to say that\nMr. Rothwell visited my place for the purpose of finding water, and hit upon\na spot where he told me I should find a large supply at about 36 feet deep.\nI then engaged a sinker, and when he got to the 36 feet a very weak spring\nwas discovered. Wet weather then set in and prevented any further\nworking, and nothing has since been done. I feel quite certain that there is\nwater at no great distance, and should we have a dry summer I intend\ngoing a few feet lower.\nI may state that I put a test to Mr. Rothwell, and that was to ask him to\ntrace the spring from a distance before reaching the spot by the Brewery ;\nthis he did, and followed it for about a quarter of a mile across the road,\nunder the buildings, and across the fields to an old disused parish well. Mr.\nRothwell, to the best of my belief, had never been in the neighbourhood\nbefore. Not being altogether a believer in the art, I took care that every\nthing was fairly carried on, and I am now a firm believer in it.\nW. J. M. Herbert.\nIn the following letter the Rev. A. T. Fryer kindly gives me an\naccount of some experiments he made with Rothwell. Though the\nresults obtained are of no evidential value in connection with a\n\" dowsing faculty,\" yet several points of considerable interest are\nreferred to. The use of a wet pad on the rod to test whether the\nmotion of the rod be due to water or metal, is identical with the device\nemployed in America and elsewhere, see Appendix C. It is undoubtedly\nan entire fallacy, the effect being in all probability merely due to\nsuggestion. It is possible Rothwell heard of it through Lawrence, but\nit is curious how these traditions spread. Much the same remark\napplies to the experiment with the glass bottles and insulation.\n13, Dumfries Place, Cardiff, September Ulh, 1893.\nWe went this morning to a small estate at St. Briavel's, Gloucestershire,\nnamed Woodside, and occupied by a Mr. Cuthbert, retired sea-captain and\nmerchant, of Cardiff. He has been without water for some time, and at last\ndetermined upon sinking a well near where a spring had hitherto given a\ngood supply. Having gone down 30 feet and meeting with no reward, he\nfelt in a fix. [This well was marked D on an accompanying plan.] He then\nmade up his mind to give Rothwell a trial. R. had never been to the place\np 2\n\f212 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nbefore he went with me to-day. We started the search in the field behind\nthe house, Rothwell having cut a hazel forked-twig from the wood, and\nwater was found in a very few minutes. To test the find, R. placed on the\ntop of the twig a piece of paper which he had wetted with water. The rod\nremained quite unaffected, and did so also at other points. I have not heard\nof this test in any other case, but R. is satisfied with it. I may mention\nhere that at another spot where R. said he felt the influence of iron, the water\ntest was also resorted to, and the paper made no difference, it remained on\nthe stick, and the stick bent down as for iron, all the same.\nThe water was traced up the field, into the wood above. Here we applied\nthe bottle test. I had two champagne bottles stuck into the earth, and\nwhen R. stood on their broad, uppermost bottoms, the rod ceased to act.\nThen we followed the indications of water across a wall, and into the next\nfield. At [a point marked A on the plan] the source was found ; no trace of\nwater above it, or anywhere else, in the same field. Then R. descended the\nwell, D, and held the rod over the water at the bottom of the well (a little\naccumulation of surface drainage), and reported, \"No spring there.\" Then\nI blindfolded him and made him walk towards A ; the rod was quiet until\nwe came to A, when it dipped. It was settled that the well should be sunk\nat C [a certain spot on the course indicated by R.], and Mr. Cuthbert has\npromised me that I shall have the news of the result as soon as possible.\nWriting to me six weeks later, Mr. Fryer says, \" I sent Rothwell\nover to Woodside the other day to see if they had begun sinking, and\nhe has reported to me that they are sinking 6 feet away from the spot\nwhich he indicated ! Mr. Cuthbert is rather a self-willed man.\" On\nNovember 4th, 1893, Mr. Cuthbert writes to Mr. Fryer, in a letter\nwhich is before me, stating that he \" has sunk 58 feet through very\nhard rock, and according to my [Mr. C's] measurement of depth have\nonly to go two feet more, for the water is certainly under where we are\nsinking. This is nearly the same place as Rothwell fixed upon. . . .\nHad I not been able to use the rod, I would never have reached water\nby Rothwell's advice.\" From which it would appear that Mr. Cuthbert\nbelieved that he was a better dowser than Rothwell, and so preferred\nto trust his own opinion. Upon subsequent enquiry I learnt that Mr.\nCuthbert had died, but had not found any water in the well, which he\nhad sunk to a considerable depth.\nThese particulars are given, as it is not improbable the case may\nbe quoted in the neighbourhood as one where great expense was\nuselessly incurred on the strength of the advice given by Rothwell.\nAt the same time Rothwell's success as a dowser is not so marked as\nmany others. I have before me a letter from a Mr. Stacey, who lives\nnear Cardiff, dated July 5th, 1893, stating he sunk a well 12 feet deep\nat a spot where Rothwell said a good spring existed, and \"only a\nlittle water was found, which went off in a few days; it cost me \u00a312,\nand as there is now no water, I do not believe in the man at all.\"\nRather a sweeping conclusion for one trial only 12 feet deep.\n\fxxxn.] On the So-called Divining Bod. 213\nRothwell frankly informed Mr. Fryer that he had been asked to\nfind water at Vaynor Rectory, near Cardiff, but there he had partly\nfailed. This spontaneous admission on Rothwell's part is some\nevidence of his undoubted honesty. Mr. Fryer wrote to the rector of\nVaynor, and the following is his reply :\u2014\nVaynor Rectory, May 22nd, 1897.\nMr. W. Rothwell found water in our village two years ago, and was paid\nby the local authority for his work, and his train expenses paid by myself\nand another gentleman.\nThere was no failure, but we had him here twice. The men after sinking\ndown about 20 feet at the spot pointed out by Mr. Rothwell, came to a hole\nor a fault, and there was no sign of water at the depth suggested. Fearing that\nthis hole or fault had something to do with it, we asked Mr. Rothwell to\ncome up again. He came and held his twig over the shaft, and said that water\nwas there, but had been thrown downwards by some convulsion or fault.\nWe asked him to point out another spot on the same [invisible] stream,\nand he did ; we found beautiful soft water at a depth of 22 feet, and\nit still runs a splendid [supply]. Mr. Rothwell had not been to Vaynor\nbefore. He found another stream and followed it for a mile until he got to\nthe well.\nSince that time I have practised the art myself, and can find water any\nwhere where there is water. I found water on my own land here, in the\nmidst of lime-rock. I have not yet finished the well, but the men have gone\ndown 25 feet, and have found already nearly 3 feet of water.\nI read in an old book that there was a stream of water running under the\nold Castle of Brecon. I was there last Tuesday, and with my twig found the\nstream.\nI am writing a pamphlet on water-finding, which will include my questions\nto Lord Kelvin. J Q JEnKInS\nF. 12.\u2014Mr. Fryer also sends me the accompanying letter, addressed\nto him, which gives an account of a distinct failure on Rothwell's\npart :\u2014\nSteam Flour Mills and Ship Biscuit Works, Cardiff,\nMay 24th, 1897.\nIn answer to your letter of the 20th inst, Mr. Rothwell's water finding\nwas not at all satisfactory. We did not come to water at the depth he\npredicted, but had to go a good deal lower, and then, as far as we can judge,\nonly came to surface water. We think we should have come to the same\nsurface water wherever we had sunk the well, which is about 30 feet deep.\nWe could find no trace of a lead pipe in another place where Mr. Rothwell\nsaid we should find one. Altogether, we regard his experiments with us as a\ncomplete failure ; but we have heard that he has been very successful\nelsewhere. Spillers and Bakers, Ltd.\nMr. Fryer, in a recent letter, tells me Rothwell has signed a\ncontract to go to Australia to dowse for water there.\n\f214 [part\nPiofessor W. F. Barrett.\n(c) Mb. R. W. Robertson.\nIn the early part of this paper (p. 18) I referred to two\nenthusiastic amateur water finders, Messrs. Robertson and Young,\nof Llanelly, South Wales, several of whose children have inherited\ntheir fathers' faculty. Mr. Robertson's son has now become a pro\nfessional dowser, and has sent me a copy of the testimonials he has\nreceived in this capacity. One of these is as follows :\u2014\nNo. 136.\u2014The following letter from Mr. G. S. Richmond, hydraulic\nengineer, is addressed to Mr. R. W. Robertson :\u2014\nLlanelly, November 23rd, 1895.\nMy sinkers struck the spring on Wednesday last, at Goodig, at 28 ft. 6 in.\nfrom the surface, and considering that this spot is less than 100 feet from an\nold quarry, the rock in which shows no signs of water, and also that the\nsurface of the ground where the well is sunk is about 50 feet higher than the\nfarmyard only 107 feet away, I think it extraordinary that you should have\nfound a spring at all, and more so that you should have estimated the depth\nat which it would be found, so near, being only 3 feet beyond your estimate.\nThe position of the well is quite unique, and I do not think a pump will be\nnecessar>' G.S.Richmond.\nMr. Buckley Roderick, a solicitor of Llanelly, for whom the well was\nsunk, also writes to the same effect, and states that before the spring\nwas found, all the water for the farm had to be carried a great\ndistance. I wrote to Mr. Richmond, and he replies : \u2014\nLlanelly, September 22nd, 1896.\nGoodig is a farm near Pembrey, South Wales. The place chosen by Mr.\nRobertson was a very remarkable and unique spot for a well, which is sunk\non the side of a steep hill ; the bottom of the well being higher than the\nfarmyard. Water rose some 18 feet in the well, and a plentiful supply was\nobtained, which I have laid on to the farm by a siphon. No indications of\nwater existed anywhere about, nor for 300 yards distance before this spring\nwas found.\nI have sunk a good many wells in Monmouthshire and South Wales at\nspots marked by the divining rod, and in every case with success.\nG.

Robertson :\u2014\nNew Road, Llanelly, Carmarthenshire, Febnmry 14th, 1897.\nOn the estate of C. W. Mansel Lewis, Esq., at Llanelly, three springs were\nfound at spots indicated by Mr. Robert Robertson (Steward). There was\nnot the slightest surface indication of wetness.\nBy means of the divining rod these three spots were suggested by Mr.\nRobertson as likely to afford a subterranean supply. Tubes were driven\ndown from 18 to 23 feet and I with pleasure certify that a continuous supply\nof water of great value to the cottagers on this estate has been regularly\npumped up since. As a result the expense of carting water has been saved.\nG. Blake,\nLand Agent for C. W. Mansel Lewis, Esq.\nMr. Robertson informs me that one of the above springs he\ndiscovered on the Stradey Castle estate is 25 yards from a bore hole\nthat was sunk haphazard prior to his visit to a depth of 50 feet. The\nbore hole was a complete failure, not a vestige of water being found ;\nwhereas the spring discovered by the rod was struck at a depth of\nonly 18 feet and continues to yield a copious and undiminished\nsupply. The Rev. A. T. Fryer has verified this.\nAn American Dowser.\u2014Mr. Cyrus Fuller.\nAfter the greater part of this paper was in type, I received from\nour friend, Mr. Hodgson, Secretary to the American Branch of the\nS.P.R., the following account of a successful American dowser, Mr.\nCyrus Fuller, of Plymouth, Wayne County, Michigan. Mr. Fuller\nwas a farmer and Quaker by birth, and died at the age of 85, three\nyears ago. An article was published about him in the Religio-\nPhilosophical Journal of December 9th, 1893, by Mr. Giles B. Stebbins,\nwho in reply to Mr. Hodgson's enquiries, writes :\u2014\n143, Pitcher Street, Detroit, Michigan, November 22nd, 1894.\nCyrus Fuller is over eighty years old, and his reply and handwriting may\nbe imperfect, but his mind was clear as ever when I last saw him. His\n\f216 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett\nintegrity, judgment and ability are of high order. He is of Quaker birth\u2014\na spiritualist of the higher grade, but has no theory as to his water finding\nsave of a subtle rapport in his temperament\u2014no miracle in the case, but\nnatural law. He has found some 200 wells, with no single failure. Some\nyears ago he sent some twenty names, signed to a statement that he had\nfound water for them on the first trial, and a lasting flow, to the Detroit\nTribune, which had flippantly treated previous statements. Men of solid\ninfluence, Hon. Mr. Penniman, ex M.C. of Plymouth, now departed, among\nthem. The Tribune published the list, and became respectful. I have\nlooked out from his home windows and seen a dozen windmills drawing\nwater to feed human beings and cattle from wells of his finding. It has\nnever been a money-making work, as he is not a poor man.\nGiles B. Stebbins.\nMr. Stebbins attempted to find for Mr. Hodgson the Detroit\nTribune containing the statement referred to, but unfortunately with\nout success. He quotes the following from a letter from Mr. Fuller\nto him, dated April 19th, 1894:\u2014\"Two of my neighbours have\njust opened wells which I located with my rod, both a success.\"\nHe also sent Mr. Hodgson a letter written by Mr. Fuller to the\nReliyio-Philosophical Journal to correct some inaccuracies in their\naccount, part of which we print.\nPlymouth, Michigan, December l'Sth, 1893.\nWe have nine flowing wells in this school district, all located by the\ndivining rod, and not one has been found by putting the wells down at\nrandom.\nThere are very few wells in this vicinity but those located by the divining\nrod. I, myself, have located between four and five hundred. The depth of\nthe wells in this vicinity on the timber land is, as near as I can calculate, on\nan average of forty-five feet. I have located a good many wells since I saw\nMr. Stebbins.\nI went to Hudson, Lenawee County, 170 miles south, on the solicitation\nof the water board of that village, and located a vein of water where they put\ndown five wells. The pump [with which] they tested the wells threw two\nhundred gallons per minute. Each well would produce that amount of\nwater without being exhausted. The village contains fifteen hundred in\nhabitants ; they got all the water they wanted.\nI have located wells every season, I think, for the last fifty years, and\n\/ never solicited a job of that kind, \u2014 they all come to me. I commenced on\nthis farm that we live on sixty-one years ago, and it's our home yet. There\nare four wells I located this last season, that were to be put down this last\nfall ; hard times prevented. One of these wells I located when the snow,\nlast winter, was a foot and a-half deep. The man was putting up a barn,\nand wanted to build the barn by a well, instead of digging the well by the\nbarn, so as to have it handy. In the dry time this season I went to the\nplace and found it located all right.\nI located a well at Plymouth that may prove celebrated. The medical\nproperties are said to be superior to almost any in this county. They sent\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 217\noff twenty-five gallons of the water to be tested at Detroit. Since then I\nmet a load of jugs of the water going in the cars, destination Cincinnatti.\nCyrus Fcller.\nMr. Fuller having died a few months later, Mr. Hodgson was, by\nthe kindness of Mr. Stebbins, put into communication with his son-in-\nlaw, Mr. Ransom L. Alexander, who writes to Mr. Hodgson as\nfollows :\u2014\nPlymouth, Mich., March oth, 1895.\nI am sorry to say that I have not the newpaper article to which\nyou refer, and cannot obtain it, several years having elapsed since its\npublication. Cyrus Fuller found many wells in this section of the\ncountry ; I believe something over 100, but I do not find among his papers\nany list of the names of those for whom he found them. I send you a few\nnames that occur to me. He found three flowing wells for himself, which\nare still running. Two of them have run 50 years, the other 30. He found\nwells for the following named persons :\u2014\nWilliam Hake\nGrant H. Joslin\nOtto Melon\nAlbert Durfee\nWilliam E. Fry\nWilliam Riddle\nWilliam T. Rattenbury\nJoseph Clizbee\nOtis Warner\nRobert Rhead\nPlymouth P.O., Mich.\nSince deceased\nPlymouth\nGrand Rapids\nNorthville\nPlymouth\nStark\nBell Branch\nWayne\nHudson, Lenawee Co.\nFlowing\nwells\nHe used a forked peach tree or witch hazel twig, commonly the former.\nR. L. Alexander.\nMr. Hodgson wrote to the persons named by Mr. Alexander, but\nreceived only the following replies :\u2014\nNo. 138.\u2014The first is from Mr. Durfee.\n103, Ottawa Street, Grand Rapids, Michigan,\nMarch 25th, 1895.\nMr. Cyrus Fuller did locate not one, but two wells on my farm in\nLivonia Township, Wayne Co., Michigan ; one is 50 feet deep, the\nother 87\u00a3. The first-named is a flowing stream running into a tank, from\nwhich stock may drink. The other, water rises within 20 feet of tho surface,\nto which a windmill is attached, and by letting the mill run continuously for\nforty-eight hours I was only able to lower the water two feet, and within a\nfew minutes after mill was stopped water came to the same level (namely,\ntwenty feet from surface). I have known Mr. Fuller all my life, having\nlived neighbour to him, until five years ago I came to Grand Rapids.\nDuring the past year Mr. Fuller has departed this life. I know of eight\nwells located by him within a radius of one mile, all flowing ones, together\nwith a great many that were good ones, but not flowers.\n\f218 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nMr. Fuller's method of locating underground streams was by the\n\"divining rod.\" Those he used were either peach, witch-hazel, yellow or\nswamp willow. He has told me no other kinds of wood that he had ever\ntried would turn in his hands.\nSome other things I can remember his having told me ; in following\nveins, as he called them, through forests, that they would lead directly under\nmany of the largest trees, and one other thing was that if a tree was stricken\nby lightning, he was sure to find a stream leading very near to it.\nWithin the past ten years he was called to many places to locate wells,\nsome out of the State, one in Canada, I think for a railroad company.\nI will conclude by saying, I know Mr. Fuller to be a man honest in\npurpose, and one whose name was above reproach. Deceived he might have\nbeen, but dishonest never. If time and space would permit I could add\nmuch more, and if of interest to you may do so at some future time.\nA. B. DuRFEE.\nNo. 139.\u2014The next is from Mr. Hake.\nPlymouth, Michigan, March 25th, 1895.\nMr. Cyrus Fuller located five wells for me, and all are good ones.\nWe had no one else to locate them but Mr. Fuller. Two of those\nwells are flowing wells, the others are plenty of water.\nWilliam Hake.\nNo. 140.\u2014The only other reply received by Mr. Hodgson was\nfrom Mr. Riddle as follows :\u2014\nPlymouth, Mich., March 2oth, 1895.\nI went 112 feet in the ground where Mr. Fuller did not locate and\nfound no water. Then I went 56 feet in a four foot well, and got 30\nfeet of water in 30 minutes after I struck it. This last well Mr. Cyrus\nFuller, who was a neighbour of mine, located. This was about eight\nyears ago, and the well has never failed. Mr. Fuller died last summer.\nWilliam Riddle.\nMr. Riddle writes again as follows :\u2014,\nPlymouth, April 12th, 1895.\nI had a well in my barnyard, but it was dry, and Mr. Fuller told\nme that there was water if I would dig for it. I tried to, but it caved\nin, and I had to abandon it. Then I moved about 10 feet from the old well,\nand dug about 112 feet, as I told you before, and found no water. This last\nwell was not located by anybody. I dug there merely for convenience.\nWilliam Riddle,\nIt is to be regretted further details cannot now be obtained of Mr.\nFuller's work as a dowser. There is, I find, a letter of his published\nin Light for August 30th, 1884, the substance of which is as follows:\u2014,\n(1) The \"Michigan Central\" officials invited Mr. Fuller to try at Esse\nCentre, 15 miles south of Detroit. They had previously bored nearly 1500\n\fxxxil] On the So-called Divining Rod. 219\nfeet to get water, but without avail. Fuller located a certain spot with the\nrod where an abundant supply of pure soft water was obtained at 110\nfeet deep.\n.(2) At Wayne, 18 miles west of Detroit, a large sum had also been spent\nby \"the officials\" in boring for water, but in vain. Water was, however,\nfound at the spot fixed on by Mr. Fuller at 137 feet ; moreover a good\nsupply was also obtained at a second spot he located here a few years\nafter.\n(3) At Northville, Michigan, W. Foy (Fry ?) had spent 200 dollars\ndigging and boring to 97 feet, but got no water. A short distance from this\nuseless well, the rod indicated a spot, where a good supply of water was\nobtained at 20 feet from the surface.\nIt would be useful to have independent evidence of these state\nments. Several other instances of the success of dowsers in finding\nunderground water, often when other means had failed, are to be\nfound in the columns of Light from 1882 to the present time ; but as\nthe majority of the correspondents do not give their names, their\nevidence cannot be corroborated. A dowser of whom I had not heard\nbefore, Mr. Child, writes from Norwich in Light of October 8th, 1887,\nstating he had repeatedly found water by the rod within a few yards\nof wells that had been sunk unsuccessfully. I wrote to Mr. Child\nasking for particulars of these places, but my letter was returned\nmarked \"present address unknown.\"\nEvidence has already been given showing the wide area of\ndistribution of the dowsing rod. This fact also comes out in the\ncorrespondence on the subject that appears from time to time in\nvarious journals. I have not heard of its use in Asia or South\nAmerica, though the North American Indians are said to have long\nknown and practised dowsing. The London Times of December 27th,\n1881, refers to its use in Dakota, as Mr. E. T. Bennett has pointed\nout.i In an article on \"Farming in Dakota,\" reference is made to a\nfarm near Valley City belonging to a Mr. Kindred, and according to\nthe Times :\u2014\nWater is got in abundance from a bed of sand 30 feet deep, and brought\nto the tanks by a pump worked by a windmill. An effort had previously\nbeen made only 100 yards further north to find water ; a shaft, 138 feet, had\nbeen ineffectually dug. The bending of the willow twig carefully carried\nover the surface is said to have afforded indications which justified the\npresent successful opening.\ni See Light for January 7th, 1882, where Mr. Bennett asks for authentic instances\nof water-finding by the rod and originated the correspondence on the subject which\nfollowed. Some remarkable cases of the use of the rod in Jersey, by a local dowser,\nare given in Light for February 11th, 1882.\n\f220 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nIn Italy the rod has been in use for over three centuries. Lieut.-\nCol. Cocks, in a letter to the Times, states he has seen certain Italians\ntravelling through the Riviera locating the site for wells with a twig\nof olive bent into the form of a loop. The loop turns upwards wjth\njerks, often striking the breast of the operator when over a hidden\nspring ; Colonel Cocks gives instances that came under his own\nobservation, of the success of these dowsers. This form of rod is, I\nobserve, pictured in a work on Practical Mining published in Bologna\nin 1678, and is also described in various Italian essays on the rod of a\ncentury ago ; a loop of wire is used by some English dowsers. In\nparts of Switzerland the rod has also long been in use ; in the\nneighbourhood of Lucerne the dowser appears to be called the\nBrunnen-Schmecker (spring-taster) ;l in the United States he is often\ncalled \"water-smeller.\"\nPart IV.\nGEOLOGICAL OPINION.\nBefore bringing to a close the evidence for or against the dowser's\nsuccess, in the search for underground water, I wish to cite the opinion\nof a few geologists.\nPROFESSOR SOLLAS, F.R.S.\nIt is certainly a singular fact how very few attempts have been\nmade by competent scientific men to put the dowsers' claims to the\ntest of experiment. One such is recorded in our own Proceedings,\nVol. II., p. 73, etseq.- This is a report by a distinguished geologist,\nProfessor Sollas, LL.D., F.R.S., etc., which was made at the request\nand at the expense of our Society in the year 1883. The experiment\nconsisted in sinking two adjacent similar wells in an alluvial plain at\nLocking, near Bristol ; one well was sunk at the spot indicated by the\ndowser, and the other at a spot 15 feet distant where the \"rod\" did not\nindicate water.3 At the former, which Professor Sollas called the +\nwell, the dowser predicted that water would be found ; at the latter,\nor \u2014 well, that it would not. Professor Sollas, as a geologist, predicted\ni See Light of January 28th, 1882, where a good instance of the Swiss dowser's\nsuccess in water-finding is given.\n8 Reprinted, as already mentioned on p. 18, with some additions and maps in the\nProceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society for 1884.\n3 The dowser was Mr. Thomas Young, since dead, see No. 29, p. 52.\n\fXXXII.] 221\nOvt the So-called Divining Rod.\nwater would be found in both or neither. Wells were sunk, and when\nthe + well was 16 feet deep, Professor Sollas reports, \" it contained a\ngood deal of water, 8 or 9 feet. . . . The - well was 20 feet deep\nand contained feet of water. Water was trickling into it, but not\nso fast as into the other. The well-sinker said this 4J feet was merely\nsurface water.\" A fortnight later the bailiff to the estate visited the\nwells, and reports that the + well was only sunk to a depth of 1 7A\nfeet, but the - well was sunk to 20 feet, nevertheless the former had\n9 feet of water in it and the latter 4^ feet. Ten days afterwards a\npupil of Professor Sollas visited the wells and reported that the water\nstood at the same level in both wells, and a similar report was given\nsome time later.i A month after this last Mr. E. R. Pease visited the\nspot and had both the wells emptied of water. \" The + well I found\n(he remarks) now to be a mere hole some 10 feet deep, whilst the - well\nwas a carefully timbered shaft 24 feet deep.\" Measurements of the rate\nat which water flowed into the two wells \" seem to show that the +\nwell filled more rapidly than the - well, although its depth was so\nmuch less. The tenant of the farm told me that the water in the +\nwell was of letter quality than that in the - well.\"\nThe conclusion Professor Sollas draws from this experiment is that\n\" The case for the dowser has conspicuously failed \" ; any success\ndowsers may have he believes due to their possession of much mother\nwit and a large experience of the behaviour of underground water.\nMr. Pease, however, remarks \" I cannot feel his [Professor Sollas']\ncomplete confidence in the conclusive nature of this particular ex\nperiment.\" An opinion from which, with all respect to my friend,\nProfessor Sollas, few, I imagine, would be disposed to dissent ; even\nalthough the - well certainly could not be called \"dry.\"2\nMr. T. V. hOLMES, F.G.S.\nMr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., the President of the Geologists'\nAssociation of London for 1889-90, who read a paper on the divining\ni The dowser and his assistants attributed the water in the - well to an outflow\nfrom the + well, and the tenant of the estate said he had seen it flowing in from the\nside nearest the + well ; Professor Sollas confirms this from his own observation, but\nadds it trickled in from the other sidesalso, and remarks that if the rock between the\ntwo wells were so porous as to allow percolation from one well to the other, then the\nrock would be water-bearing and furnish water tc both.\n\u2022At the close of his paper Professor Sollas draws attention to the incompatibility\nof the dowser's pretensions, in this and like cases, with the assumption that some\nphysical effect is produced on the dowser by underground water, provided this\neffect be assumed to radiate from the water and decrease as the square of the distance\nincreases. I shall return to this argument subsequently when discussing the suggested\nexplanations of the \" dowsing faculty,\" if such there be.\n\f222 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett\nrod before the Anthropological Institute on March 30th, 1897,i writes\nto me as follows :\u2014\n28, Crooms Hill, Greenwich Park, S.E., June 23rd, 1897.\nA priori conclusions seem to me absurd and unscientific, whether put\nforward by the President of the Royal Society, or by a village cobbler. As\nregards the water diviner, I am only anxious that he should be brought\nfrom the realm of disorderly mystery, which is ignorance, to that of orderly\nmystery, which is science\u2014to use a phrase of Huxley's. That a somewhat\nabnormal nervous organisation may make given persons specially sensitive\nin special ways, where ordinary persons remain unconscious, is a perfectly\npossible, and not improbable thing to me. It is simply a matter of\nevidence.\nWhilst geology as a science is very modern, a knowledge of water\nbearing surface beds is extremely ancient, as the evidence afforded by the\nsites of ancient towns and villages amply demonstrates ; in fact, the presence\nof a water-bearing stratum, such as a flat of old river gravel, was one of the\nstrongest attractions.2 Nowadays, the existence of water companies allows\nthe extension of London over thick clay. But the ancient London, \"the\nCity,\" is on the first high terrace of old river gravel to bo met with on going\nup the Thames from the sea. Innumerable instances of a similar kind\nmight be given. This perception of water-bearing surface beds is therefore\na knowledge quite independent of a knowledge of geological structure, and\none which has existed from time immemorial.\nIndeed, (as I have elsewhere remarked), the rise of geology as a science\ntended to put this older knowledge of water-bearing surface beds into the\nbackground. The Geological Survey had been at work many years at the\ndeep-seated geology of England and Wales, before any \" drift-maps,\" or\nthose showing the superficial beds, which lie indifferently on the older rocks\nof various ages, were even thought of. But at a later period it was dis\ncovered that to ignore the superficial beds in such a district as the Eastern\nCounties was to ignore the strata forming four-fifths of the surface to an\naverage depth of thirty or forty feet. So drift-maps became more common.\nBut geologists seldom bestow much thought on these various drift-beds,\nunless interested in flint implements. Again, with the rise of geology as a\nscience came, pari passu, a distrust of water from surface beds as a source\nof domestic supply, and a preference for deep wells and water companies.\nIn short, the tendency of the great bulk of geologists is to ignore utterly\nsurface beds as a source of water supply, and to care but little for them from\nany other point of view ; while, as regards older rocks, most would l>e\nfound interested in them rather as showing deposition under marine,\nestuarine, fresh water, warm or cold water, conditions, than in their\nrelations to water-supply.\nConsequently, I am not surprised to learn from one of the cases you cite,\n(No. 73, p. 97), that a \" geological authority \" had said that no water would\nbe found at a less depth than 120 to 130 feet, and that Mullins found water\ni I am indebted to my friend, Mr. E. Westlake, F.G.S., for this information,\nwhich reached me too late for insertion in the earlier part of this paper.\n- This fact was pointed out some time ago by Professor Prestwich.\u2014W.F.B.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 223\nat 20 feet in a surface deposit. Whether the geologist ignored the surface\ndeposit, or thought water from it unwholesome, I know not.\nIn another case (No. 42, p. 68) the geologist is not so wrong as he seems.\nLimestone is a water-bearing rock, and water would tend to flow to the\nlowest level in that rock, impervious clay beneath preventing it from getting\nlower. But while water tends to percolate evenly through gravel and sand,\nit flows through sandstones and limestones mainly along their lines of\njointing. Hence it is by no means rare to find that little if any water comes\ninto a shaft driven into a limestone or sandstone to a supposed sufficient\ndepth, and a very common practice of practical well-sinkers to run headings\nin various directions to tap joints and fissures when such is the case, with\nresults as successful as in the above example.\nIn certain Essex cases north of Chelmsford and between Braintree and\nBishop's Stortford, where the diviner's success was thought wonderful, there is\na plateau of Boulder clay intersected by valleys which show the underlying\nFig. 1.\nGlacial gravel and sand, London clay underlying both. The villages are on\nthe gravel and sand of the valleys, and any practical well-sinker would see at\nonce that water would be attainable at a moderate depth on the plateau on\nsinking through the Boulder clay into the underlying gravel, see Fig. 1 ; the\nLondon clay, of course, prevents the water from getting lower. The valleys\nthereabouts are very close together, in addition. Non-drift maps of Essex\nignore almost everything above the London clay ; hence a Government official,\nreporting a year or two ago on Essex agriculture, stated that most of the\nsoil of Essex was London clay. Much more of it is Boulder clay than London\nclay. But drift-maps are of recent date, and all geological maps of less scale\nthan one inch to the mile necessarily ignore drift for the sake of clearness in\nmore fundamental points of structure.\nWith regard to Lady Milbanke's and Dr. Hutton's experiments (p. 42) ;\nthe \" new college\" was evidently the Royal Military Academy on Woolwich\nCommon, at which Dr. Hutton was Professor of Mathematics (1773-1806.)\nNow the surface of Woolwich Common between the Military Academy and\nthe Artillery Barracks and Rotunda (northward) consists of Blackheath\nPebble Beds ; while from the Academy (southward) the Pebble Beds become\ncovered with a gradually increasing thickness of London clay. Whether the\nspot at which the lady discovered the water had Pebble Beds at the surface,\nor they were covered by a few feet of London clay, is immaterial, as the water\nwould be found only towards the bottom of the Pebble Beds. And as water\n\f224 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\npercolates evenly and freely through them, and they are lying almost\nperfectly flat, water would be found thereabouts at very nearly the same\ndepth wherever the Pebble Beds are uncovered, and at a greater distance\nfrom the surface as the thickness of the London clay above increased. It is\ntherefore obvious that whatever influence may have caused the lady's agita\ntion and the twisting of the rod in her fingers, it could not have been a\npeculiar and special nearness of underground water at that particular spot.\nIn this instance, too, there can be no suspicion that she was trying to give\nherself a reputation for an abnormal faculty ; nor that her movements wero\nthe result of knowing that water was almost certain to be found at no great\ndepth in a bed of gravel. We learn also that the most perfect integrity is\nquite compatible with complete, though unconscious, self-deception. In short,\nthis case is one best explained by the conclusion of Paramelle, that \"the\nwand turns in the hands of certain individuals of peculiar temperament, and\nthat it is very much a matter of chance whether there are, or are not, wells\nin the places where it turns.\" Records of experiments with the divining rod\nshow many apparently similar cases.\nIn my paper I spoke of myself as afield-geologist, because having worked\non the Geological Survey of England and Wales about 11 years, in Yorkshire\nand Cumberland, I have often since felt the advantage of having been\ncompelled from official duty to note much about superficial, and other beds,\nwhich the non-official geologist almost invariably neglects. And when\npresident of the Geologists' Association, at a later date, (1889-90), it often\nstruck me how little many otherwise accomplished geologists saw in the field\nof those points which would be instinctively noted by the Geological Survey,\nwho had to map the various beds in detail. But many of these points\nwould equally attract the attention of the professional diviner. But the\ngeologist\u2014on water being found at a certain depth, whether in Carboniferous\nsandstone, or river gravel, or anywhere else\u2014would not call water so found\n\"a spring.\" A spring is a natural fountain. Where a permeable bed of sand\nstone\u2014for example\u2014lies above impermeable shale, water will flow downwards\nthrough the sandstone in the direction of its dip. Where the sandstone\nbecomes saturated to a level above that of the surface, there may be ono\nstrong spring, many slighter ones, or a belt of wet ground, according to local\ncircumstances.\nIf the permanent level of the water is at W. L. (see Fig. 2, representing\na section) then there will be springs along the line of the valley. But if I\nFio. 2.\n\fxxxn.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 225\nsink a well at my house at H. and find water 30 or 40 feet below the surface I\ncannot call water so found a \"spring.\" A geological surveyor or a practical\nwell-sinker would see the dip of the sandstone, and note any Kpring or belt\nof wet ground in the valley, the latter telling him that the sandstone being\nfull of water there, he need not go very deep for it at H. In a map the\nsandstone would probably be traceable for miles, and have a breadth of\nperhaps a quarter of a mile. Anywhere towards the bottom of the slope\nwater might be expected at a moderate depth. In short, where water may\nbe found at a moderate depth is a question of acres or square miles, not of\nfeet or inches, as the diviner absurdly thinks. And when the finding of\nwater by diviners is, nevertheless, treated as though it were equivalent to\nthe finding, in each case, of a pot of ancient coins, six feet below the\nsurface of a ploughed field, belief in his abnormal powers follows as a matter\nof course.\nNevertheless I may add, that to me abnormal sensitiveness to the\nproximity of water seems quite as possible as abnormal sensitiveness to the\naction of some special drug, or to the presence of some particular animal, of\nwhich many curious examples are known.\nAs to the nature of the nervous sensibility which produces these\nperformances with the divining rod ; how much its possessors resemble in\nnervous organisation persons subject to hypnotic influences, or those who\nspeedily become convulsed at fervid religious meetings,\u2014that is a question\nof much interest, but one into which I have not entered.\nI am amused at the fee demanded (note p. 6 of your paper) for training.\nFor on the hypothesis that the diviner depends solely on his inner\nsensations, \"training\" seems likely to do harm rather than good. The\nusual dislike of diviners to be blindfolded also becomes unintelligible. For,\nif blindfolded, he would be much more likely to be governed solely by his\ninner sensations. I know that they do not always object. If I were a\ndiviner, I would object or not according to the nature of the ground. If I\nwere in the midst of a large flat of river or other gravel, I would cheerfully\nconsent. But if progress in a certain direction for 100 or 200 yards might\nlead to a mistake, I would prefer to see. So far as I can make out, the\ndiviner acts in this way.\nAs to the question of sensitiveness to the nearness of mineral lodes, I\nhave not touched upon it. It seems to me that the two things are better\ntreated separately. And mineral lodes being confined to special lines of\ncountry, to definite and very limited areas, it would be much more easy to\nobtain satisfactory evidence in their case of abnormal sensitiveness than in\nthat of so broadly diffused a thing as water. Indeed, as regards water, I\ncannot think of any country in which the matter could be tested satisfactorily.\nAnd with regard to mineral lodes, it must not be forgotten that the practical\nobserver sees much in his own line where very able men, in other walks, see\nnothing particular, as regards surface indications. The \"Savage\" is a far\nbetter observer than most of our \"educated\" people, who see little and\nargue much. Had I known you were writing on the subject I should not\nhave written my own paper, but have sent you my notes thereon. But I\nheard of it oidy about two months ago.\nT. V.

After receiving the rest of the\npaper, Mr. Holmes writes to me as follows :\u2014\nI think no intelligent person can doubt the practical successes of dowsers\n(pp. 4-7). The question with me is : Does a recognition of them involve\nthe recognition of an abnormal faculty in the dowser ? It seems to me too\nmuch forgotten that a man may become a \"Sherlock Holmes\" as an\nobserver of the special natural phenomena in which he is interested, and\nremain a very average observer in other departments. I am very far from\nthinking that dowsers are guilty of conscious deception when they attribute\ntheir successes to an abnormal power. But people who owe little or nothing\nto education, so far as education means \" booklearning,\" are particularly apt\nto believe themselves the possessore of special abnormal gifts, simply because\nthey know that their success cannot be the result of what is commonly called\neducation.i In his special sphere a gamekeeper may point out many things\nto a Darwin which the latter would not otherwise have noticed.\nP. 48. \u2014Adams. Blindfolding should have helped him by preventing any\nconfusing of his sensations\u2014on the sensations hypothesis.2\nP. 53. \u2014Stokes doubtless was \" an excellent dowser,\" but his sensations\ndeceived him very decidedly.

As the sands occupy a large area of\nthe surface east of the house at Hale Park, they must contain a large amount\nof water, which is \"surface\" water as coming from surface beds. Any\ndiscovery more simple and less \"uncanny\" it would be hard to mention.\nIt makes one suspect that many other cases which seemed extraordinary to\nthe narrators would prove equally simple if one could get a similar\nknowledge of the geology.4\ni This is very true. I have already referred to the dowser's liability to self-\ndeception.\u2014W. F.

At the same time, if the rod be an\nautotcopc (p. 11) one can quite understand how unexpected bhndfolding might\ndisturb, rather than induce, that passive state of mind which seems necessary for\nsuccess in the whole group of sub-conscious phenomena.\u2014W.

I wrote to Major Goff to enquire why \" every one\nwas astonished \" at water being found. His reply is given on p. 55. Mr. Westlake,\nF.G.S., writes, \" I know Hale.

The patch of Bagshot-sand on which it stood gave a water supply.\nP. 196.\u2014The Bacon cases are in the Boulder clay district of Essex.\nThe thicknesses of the Boulder clay forming the surface of the plateau and\nof the underlying glacial sand and gravel, seen in the valleys of the various\nstreams, vary considerably within certain moderate limits. But the water\nis diffused through the gravel, and obtainable when the gravel is reached.\nPerhaps the usual depth to which it would be necessary to sink through the\nBoulder clay is from 20 to 40 ft. (See Fig. 1, p. 223.)\nThe Honham Experiments (p. 117).\u2014The position of Warnham Lodge is\nnot shown on the old Ordnance map on which the geological surveyors\nworked, but it evidently stands where the words \" Lit. Mays \" appear on\nthat map, about a mile N.W. of the village of Warnham, which is about\n2\u00a3 miles N.W. of Horsham. Horsham stands on the Tunbridge Wells Sand\nof the Hustings Beds, while Warnham and Warnham Lodge are both on the\noverlying formation known as the Weald Clay, as the great bulk of it\nconsists of clay.

To obtain\na water supply by means of shallow wells and pumps has been the\nchief cause of this selection, clay yielding no water. In the Weald Clay\ndistrict, the most important of the subordinate beds of stone is the\nHorsham Stone, on which the village of Warnham and Warnham Court\nstand. The presence of one of these beds of stone, where it attains a\nthickness of a few feet, will be marked by the existence of a ridge, which\nwill make higher ground than that where the surface beds are almost wholly\nclay. As water supply in such a district depends so largely on the presence\nof these beds of stone, the dowser naturally has a keen eye for the elevated\nground, and will go there, to the horror of his backers at first, and to the\nenormous increase of their wonder at his powers, when a well is successfully\nsank at the top of a hill, after failures down below.\nThere are signs of the presence of a bed of stone on the high ground\nwhere Warnham Lodge and farm buildings stand, and Topley mentions\n(p. 104) a bed of sand and sandstone ranging by Hurst Hill, Gearing's,\nLittle May's, Charman's, and other spots to Rudgwick, which is evidently the\nQ 2\n\f228 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nstone in question.i Whether in Yorkshire, Sussex, or anywhere else, where\nbeds of stone alternate with others of clay or shale, the high ground is\ncomposed of the beds of stone, and the lower of the shales, and the former\nare waterbearing, the latter not.\nI do not wonder that the non-dowsing advisers ignored the surface stone\nbed, and thought of (I suppose) going down to the Horsham Stone, or even\nthe Tunbridge Wells Sand ; or, perhaps, of tapping a sufficient number of\nwaterbearing beds, which individually insignificant might collectively prove\nsufficient, and be free from possible dangers arising from surface pollution\u2014\ndangers by no means uncommon in similar cases. The dowser's triumph is\nto find water, and to find it as near the surface as possible ; he has no further\nresponsibility. But the geologist who should recommend water from a source\neasily polluted, and which gave rise to disease in persons using it, would be\ndeemed to have shown a most culpable recklessness\u2014at the very least.\nHowever, the dowser in this case, after \" blasting and sinking\" in hard\nlimestone, obtained a supply of water at a depth of 12 feet, at spots known\nas E and F, and at 19 feet at D (p. 119), all these wells being only a few\nyards apart. The dowser, however, insisted that no water would be found\nbetween wells E and F, as \"both were independent springs.\" One of the\nwells was pumped nearly dry, and the water-level in the other was unaffected.\nBut this merely showed that there were no lines of bedding or jointing giving\nan easy passage to the water between the two wells. And the water from the\nstone for some distance around having been collected into the two wells,\nthe space between them was likely to be a spot comparatively free from\nwater. Of course, ultimately, a well midway between E and F would have\nbecome as full of water as they were. But the days necessary for this to\ntake place, in the absence of a good system of jointing, were not allowed,\nbut a tunnel was at once made connecting the wells E and F, and ensuring\na better supply than could otherwise be obtained.\nThis stone was evidently an extremely hard and compact rock, very much\nmore so than the chalk, but the best illustration I can think of to show the\ndifference between the restricted circulation of water in jointed rocks, and\nits free percolation in gravel and sand is from the chalk.\nIn the Essex Naturalist, Vol. I. , p. 254, (1887) there is a brief account of\nsome \" chalk wells \" in Buckinghamshire. These chalk wells were situated at\na tile works, and consisted of some five or six shafts, about 70 ft. deep, which\nafter piercing through the surface beds, entered the chalk to a depth of about\n6 ft., and then widened out into bell-shaped chambers. The object of their\nmakers was to obtain chalk for lime from the ground beneath the limited\narea of the tile works. The chalk being locally full of water almost to the\ntop, these chambers were hollowed out as near the top of the chalk as\npossible. After a considerable amount of chalk had been removed from one\nof these chambers, it would become unpleasantly wet, and would ultimately\nbe abandoned and another shaft sunk, and so on. The important point is\nthat these chambers became unpleasantly wet only after some time had\nelapsed, though from their size, as compared with that of a mere well, they\nmust have been comparatively far more likely to be speedily flooded. I\ni It is called a limestone in your paper. Probably it is more calcareous than\nusual at Warnham Lodge.\n\fxxxii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 220\nhave no doubt that the Warnham well between E and F would eventually\nhave had water in it, had sufficient time been allowed, just as in the case of\nthe chalk chambers at the tile works. That Mullins fixed upon the spot\nmidway between two wells as a dry place, seems to me simply caused by his\nexperience of the behaviour of water in jointed rocks, not as showing the\nveracity of his sensations. The dowser in the case reported by Professor\nSollas no doubt fancied that he was directed by his sensations. But he\nprobably thought also that water circulated as irregularly through the sand\nof an alluvial flat as through a jointed rock \u2014and consequently deceived\nhimself- T. V. Holmes.\nMr. Holmes' criticism of some of the cases which I have cited is\nextremely interesting and useful, and I am much indebted to him for\nthe trouble he has taken. Regarding the Horsham experiments, the\nexplanation suggested by Mr. Holmes presumes that Mullins had not\nonly local knowledge, but also a yeological knowledge of the locality.\nThis is in the highest degree improbable, (seep. 117). I never met\nJohn Mullins, but every one who has done so testifies to the fact that\nhe never troubled himself in the least about gaining the advantage to\nbe derived from even an elementary acquaintance with geological facts.\nWhatever information of water bearing strata he has gained by\nexperience was probably not consciously drawn upon, but may have\naided him in a kind of instinctive selection of the right spot where to\nsink a well. The question to be discussed presently is whether this\ninstinct gained by experience is sufficient to account for the dowser's\nsuccess in the whole of the cases I have cited. At Warnham Park\nthere was absolutely nothing in the surface of the ground to indicate\nwhich was stone and which Weald clay. The hill and its slopes as well\nas the rest of the ground were covered with vegetation, under which\nwas a thick layer of alluvial soil. Moreover the water found, though\nfrom a shallow well, is an excellent, abundant, and perennial supply.\nIf its discovery was so very obvious, as Mr. Holmes points out, why did\nnot the experienced local well sinkers and the eminent engineers who\nwere consulted,\u2014aided as they were by geological maps and geological\nadvice,\u2014indicate the fact to Mr. (now Sir Henry) Harben and save\nhim the fruitless expenditure of over \u00a31,000? If Mr. Holmes visited\nthe site, he would see the source chosen is the highest point on the\nestate ; it is not easily polluted and in fact it furnishes the whole of\nthe drinking water which is used in the establishment. It is, as we\nall know, very easy to prophecy after the event, but in this case not\n(1uite so easy beforehand, apparently.i\ni Writing to me on July 8th, 1807, after the above was in type, Mr. Holmes says :\u2014\nI visited Horsham on June 30th. As you say, there is no evidence of stone on\nthe surface, but that would not matter to the dowser. He would see, as I saw, that\nthere was a ridge capped by stone of some sort there, i.e., by something harder than\n\f230 [PAKT\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nWith regard to the absence of water between wells E and F\n(p. 118) if I understand Mr. Holmes aright, he argues this is merely\nrelative, water would gradually have percolated into the intervening\nspace, if time were allowed for it to do so. Possibly, but that is not the\npoint in question. How did Mullins find the exact spots where bedding\nor jointing allowed an abundant supply of water to be tapped ? And\nhow did he know that between E and F in the solid rock 1 2 ft. below\nhim there was \"an absence of a good system of jointing,\" to use Mr.\nHolmes' words ? He did not remove the trees, the shrubs, the grass,\nand the surface soil, and explore the rocks beforehand. Had Mr.\nHolmes himself been in Mullins' place, he must have been more\nthan a geological Sherlock Holmes to have discovered all this in a\nrapid walk over entirely new ground.\nNo, Mr. Holmes' criticism leaves the solution of the question\nas a whole as far off as ever. Many individual cases are, no doubt,\nreadily explicable; but nothing Mr. Holmes has said explains the\nWaterford experiments, nor, I venture to say, the Horsham\nexperiments, nor the numerous cases I have cited where useless wells\nor borings had previously been made, and where water was found by\nthe dowser at a less depth, or at a corresponding depth close by.\nThe next letter may be contrasted with Mr. Holmes' instructive\ncriticism, or with the opinions given on pp. 6, 7, and 67.\nMB. J. h. bLAKE, F.G.S.\nI wrote to several well-known geologists to ask for any information\nthey could give me either favourable or unfavourable to the pretensions\nof the dowser. Among other replies, my friend, Mr. W. Whitaker,\nF.R.S., referred me to Mr. J. H. Blake, F.G.8., of the Geological Survey,\nwho has had considerable experience in hydro-geology. I wrote to Mr.\nBlake, and the following is his reply :\u2014\nRe \"The Divining Rod.\"\n16, Polstead-road, Oxford, October 1st, 1896.\nI have received your letter of September 26th, desiring some information\nas to the ntm-snetes* of the above.

J. Palmer, of the Biscuit Factory, Reading, wanting a\nwater supply at Kingwood House, Lambourn, Berkshire, employed a\ndivining rod man, who walked over the ground and stated water would be\nfound at a few feet beneath the surface over a certain area which he pointed\nout. I was afterwards consulted, and having inspected the site, and made\nsome calculations, informed Mr. Palmer that no water would be met with\nuntil the plane of saturation in the chalk was reached, which at the locality\nmentioned would be about 300 feet from the surface of the ground. Mr.\nPalmer then decided to have a well dug, six feet in diameter, which was\ncarried out by a man I know very well, and who supplied me with all\nparticulars, and no water was found until the plane of saturation in the\nchalk was reached at about the depth I stated. This well was sunk\nin 1892.\nTo mention a more recent case, last June, the owner of \"The Hollies,\"\nBurghfield, near Reading, called upon me, and stated that her tenant\u2014a\nGeneral, who believed in the divining rod\u2014had employed a well-known\ndivining rod man, who went over the ground, and told him water would be\nfound at about 40 feet beneath the surface. After making some calculations,\nI informed the owner that no water would be met with until the basement\nbed of the London clay was reached, which at the site of the house would be\nabout 183 feet beneath the surface. This information was communicated to\nthe General, who shortly afterwards called upon me, when I explained\nto him how I arrived at my conclusions, and that the divining rod\nbusiness was ab$olute iwnseime ! I advised a boring to be made, which\nwas completed a few days ago, and no water was met with until the water-\nhearing basement bed of the London clay was reached at a depth of 190\nfeet from the surface.\nI will mention one more case to show the fallacy of the divining rod, or\n''dowsing fork,\" as it is sometimes called, but better known on the\nGeological Survey as the \"chousing fork ! \"\nA well-known divining rod man visited Reading a few years ago, when\nMr. Walker, the waterworks manager, took him along a street, at a certain\nspot beneath which the Holy Brook (which used to supply the old Abbey)\nflows in a culvert. When they came to it, all those present watched the hazel\ntwig, or fork, which he carried in the usual manner, and not the slightest\nmovement occurred, although all those present, excepting the divining rod\nman, knew perfectly well there was running water beneath them !\nIn conclusion, I consider those who profess to find water by means of the\ndivining rod, and receive moneyi for their erroneous information, ought to\nbe prosecuted forfraud, quite as much as a fortune-teller, for deceiving her\nMajesty's subjects. J H Blake\nAs Mr. Blake mentions two specific instances of failure, it was\ndesirable to obtain information alxmt these at first hand, so that they\nmight be recorded with other adverse evidence.

General Buck kindly replies as follows : \u2014\nThe Hollies, Burghfield, Mortimer, Berks., October oth, 1896.\nIn reply to your letter of October 2nd, 1896, I have to inform you that\nMr. Mullins, the diviner, came here and pointed out places where I should\nfind water, but I did not sink a well at the place pointed out, as he said I\nshould have to go down 70 or 80 feet. I subsequently consulted Mr. Blake,\nGovernment geological surveyor, who informed me that I should get no water\nnearer the surface than 186 feet. As a matter of fact, I had to bore 210 feet\nbefore I got a supply. No doubt I should have found water at that depth at\nthe place pointed out by the diviner, as I was aware that if I went deep\nenough I should get water. T d,.__\nYj, 15LCK.\nThe dowser in this case could not have been John Mullins, who was\ndead, but must have been one of his sons. Mr. Blake, it will be\nobserved, is not quite accurate in his statements as to the depth\npredicted by the dowser, or that at which water was actually found.\nThis, however, is immaterial, as the well was not sunk at the place\nindicated by the dowser. Nevertheless, the geological evidence shows\nthat the dowser employed was probably mistaken. It would, however,\nhave been rash to make any such prediction in the case of a spot fixed\non by John Mullins, as the Waterford experiments, the Horsham\nexperiments, and other evidence already cited demonstrate.\nWith regard to the first case mentioned by Mr. Blake, that of the\nlate Mr. W. J. Palmer, of Reading, I wrote to the address given by\nMr. Blake, and received the following reply from Mr. G. W. Palmer :\u2014\nElmhurst, Reading, February 2oth, 1897.\nIn reply to your letter, I write to say you have been entirely mismformed ;\nmy experience with the divining rod has, I am glad to say, been eminently\nsatisfactory. Geo Wm Palkbji\nUpon explaining that the reference was to the late Mr. W. J.\nPalmer, I was informed that the latter had been dead some years, and\nno information was possessed by my correspondent as to the facts\nnarrated by Mr. Blake. In reply to my enquiries as to any one who\ncould give me the requisite information, Mr. G. \\V. Palmer's private\nsecretary states that he has submitted my letter to Mr. Palmer, who\nhad to leave home on account of illness, and that \" he is unable to throw\nany light upon the matter.\" Whilst I do not in the least dispute Mr.\nBlake's statement, it will be observed that his information in this case\ndoes not appear to be first-hand. Certainly, Mr. G. W.

C. E. dE RAnCE, F.G.s.\nAmong English geologists who have made the question of water\nsupply their special study, few are more qualified to speak than Mr.\nC. E. De Ranee, Assoc. Inst. C.E., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of\nEngland and Wales.i Mr. De Ranee was secretary to the British\nAssociation \" Underground Water Committee,\" and drew up the whole\nof their twenty annual published reports. In a letter to Mr. E.\nWestlake, which I am permitted to print, Mr. De Bance, like most\nother geologists, speaks of the divining rod as a fraud, though he\nthinks many of its operators are honest and deceive themselves ; and\nadds, under date, November 16th, 1896 :\u2014\nWith an experience of a quarter of a century I know of no public water\nsupply, or first class pumping station for trade purposes, which originated\nwith a dowser. As regards shallow wells for domestic use, sunk by local\nwell sinkers, it is very seldom that a small supply of water cannot be got for\nthe limited requirements, and failures are few. The dowser is in the same\ngeneral condition ; for a small quantity he can hardly go wrong, and one\nnever hears of his failures in the newspapers !\nHow far the evidence I have presented confirms this opinion of Mr.\nDe Ranee I leave the reader to judge ; certainly local well sinkers do\nfrequently sink without finding water, as a large number of the cases I\nhave cited prove. I wrote to Mr. De Ranee, and asked him if he\ncould supply me with anyfacts as to the relative success, or non-success,\nof a good dowser on the one hand, and a good geologist on the other,\nin determining the correct sites of wells for various private properties.\nI received the following interesting letter in reply :\u2014\n55, Stoke Road, Stoke-on-Trent, December loth, 1896.\nDivhung rod.\u2014I agree with you that facts, and not belief or unbelief,\nshould^be the basis of the enquiry. But the difficulty is to get facts on both\ni See Appendix B, where Mr. De Ranee's work on the Water Supply of England\nand Wales, London, 1882, is referred to. Mr. De Kaneo kindly sent me a number\nof press cuttings on the divining rod of older date than those I had.\n\f234 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\naides that are comparable. It does not follow, because a man is an eminent\ngeologist or civil engineer, that he has studied \" Hydro-geology\"; the chances\nare that he has not. There are at the present time barely twenty under\nground water-experts in the British Islands, so the \" personal equation \" is\nof the greatest importance. There are probably 1,500 geologists, including\ngeologically inclined civil and mining engineers, but twenty would be the\noutside who could give a reliable opinion on underground water, any more\nthan on fossil insects, or fossil fish.\nIt is a matter of common experience that local authorities do not know\nwho are the underground water specialists, and call in a leading geologist, who-\nmay, or may not, respond to the call, just as some surgical experts may, or\nmay not, advise, when asked for an opinion outside their special branch.\nThe opinions of such geologists rest upon chance, and I should not be\nsurprised to hear that their success, or non-success, was on all fours with\nthat of \"the dowser.\"\nThen again, as regards comparing successes, it is important to remember\nan underground water-expert is hardly ever called in, except a daily supply\nof from 100,000 to 4,000,000 gallons is required. So far as I am aware, no\npublic or private supply of over 100,000 gallons per day has ever been\nadvised by a \"dowser,\" though such, of course, may be the case, unknown\nto me.\nUnderground water travels in sheets and not lines, and though underground\n\" channels,\" or \" courses,\" occur in limestones and impure limestone\u2014like\nthe chalk, \u2014occasionally, they are wholly absent in other rocks ; though, of\ncourse, these throw up lines of springs, where the flow of water is intercepted\nby faults, throwing in some impermeable material, forming a -water-tight\nbarrier. Such lines are well marked by melted hoar-frost at daybreak, on a\nfrosty morning.' C. E. De Ranxe.\nMr. Do Ranee is doubtless right that no large public water-supply\nis due to a dowser ; this is one of the special functions of the hydro-\ngeologist, who will on scientific grounds accurately advise where to\nsink deep wells. Here I should expect the dowser would be quite\nuseless. Mr. De Ranee is, however, mistaken in thinking no water\nsupplies of over 100,000 gallons a day (say 4,200 an hour) have ever\nbeen found by dowsers, see e.g., No. 49, where 20,000, and No. 78,\nwhere 10,000 gallons per hour were obtained ; but as a rule the supply\nfound is not so enormous, though ample for private purposes.\nIt is necessary to bear in mind that there are two distinct kinds of\nwells, viz., shallow wells, sunk into a superficial permeable stratum ;\nand deep wells, sunk through the superficial stratum and through an\nimpermeable stratum beneath, until the underlying water-bearing\ni This is -tn interesting observation and one to which I shall return in discussing\nthe theory of a possible \" dowsing faculty.\" In mining districts the melting of hoar\nfrost and the peculiar growth of herbage have long been known to afford some\nindications of the direction of mineral lodes beneath.\u2014W. F. B.\n\fxxxii.]' On the So-called Divining Rod. 235\nstratum is reached. Shallow wells are often contaminated and yield\nas a rule moderate supplies of water ; deep wells generally yield a\nmuch larger supply of pure water. Though the evidence in this paper\nshows that some deep wells have been successfully found by dowsers,\nan analysis of the whole of the cases shows that the success of\nthe dowser evidently lies in fixing the best spot where to sink\ncomparatively shallow wells, the average depth of the dowser's wells\nmentioned in this paper being a little over 40 feet, and the average\nsupply found being sufficient for the purpose required, though\ninsufficient for a public water supply. There is, however, abundant\nevidence to prove that in these wells, as a rule, the quality of the\nwater, even in the 12 foot well (p. 119) sunk by Sir Henry Harben, is\nexcellent for drinking purposes. The dowser, it must be remembered,\nis rarely employed in towns, where shallow wells are undoubtedly a\nsource of danger.\nAgain, in estimating the success or failure of the dowser, it should\nnot be forgotten that the most experienced geologists are sometimes\nmistaken in the advice they give as to water supply. Mr. De Ranee\ngoes so far as to say that even the opinion of leading geologists (the\nresult of their opinions is probably meant) \"rests upon chance.\"\nThere is a well-known case of the serious and costly failure of scientific\nadvice in well-sinking recorded in the Encyclopa-dia Britannica, (Art.\nWater Supply, p. 405). This was at the deep well on Southampton\nCommon, \" which has only yielded a small supply of water, though\ncarried 852 feet into the chalk.\" This well has since been sunk, by\nboring, to a depth of 1,317 feet, and was ultimately abandoned after\nthe ratepayers had been put to an expense of \u00a313,000.i Other cases\nof failure on the part of scientific experts in sinking deep wells have\noccurred. A French engineer congratulates himself that out of 16\ndeep borings he has made, only two were unsuccessful ; that is, his\nfailures were rather over 12 per cent. The writer of the work in\nWeale's Series already cited, an experienced hydraulic engineer, states\n\" the non-success of these borings is worthy of remark, as illustrating\nthe uncertainty of this class of operations.\" Nor do these deep wells\nalways yield a large supply ; according to the same writer, the artesian\nwell sunk at the \" Model Prison, Caledonian-road, London \" to a depth\nof 370\u00a3 feet only yielded 800 gallons per hour. The artesian well at\nChichester is sunk and bored to a depth of 1,054 feet, but does not\nyield 100 gallons an hour and \"the water is of a repulsive taste and\nsmell.\" These, I suppose, would be cases which Mr. De Ranee would\ni Treatise on WcU-dit>ging and boriwi in Weale's Series, 7th edition, p. 89. Mr.\nWestlake, F.G.S., informs me the total cost of this well was \u00a319,600 ; it did yield\nfrom 2 to 5,000 gallons per hour, but this was a failure for the object intended and\nthe well was abandoned as useless in 1882 ; though now used for road watering.\n\f236 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nmaintain illustrate his contention. Whether this be so or not, the\nsignificant point is that, when a failure on the part of a dowser occurs,\nan outcry is immediately raised and his successes are ignored ; whereas\nsimilar treatment is not accorded to the engineer or geologist. This\nis, no doubt, inevitable, though the problem being to obtain a water\nsupply, it is a matter of supreme indifference to the user whether the\nprocess by which it is obtained be rational and explicable on scientific\ngrounds, or irrational and inexplicable.\nAs these sheets are passing through the press a sheaf of newspaper\ncuttings has reached me, containing comments on the surcharge of the\nUrban District Council, at Ampthill, in Bedfordshire, of the fee paid\nby them to the dowser.i The geological reasons for this surcharge are\nfair enough, the site being on the Oxford clay, which it is said has\nbeen bored 700 feet without finding water ; albeit it appears that a\nfair yield of water was obtained at a moderate depth, on the site\nselected by Gataker; but the supply was quite inadequate for public\nuse.2 A similar dispute has recently arisen at Porthcawl, in\nGlamorganshire, which is referred to on p. 162. In both these cases I\nam informed that the newspaper comments are based on misleading\nreports. The solicitor to the Porthcawl District Council and Clerk to\nthe Board, in answer to my enquiry writes to say that the dowsing\ni One of the legal reasons given by the auditor for the surcharge was based on a\ndecree of the High Court to the effect that \" the pretence of power, whether moral,\nphysical, or supernatural, with intent to obtain money, was sufficient to constitute an\noffence within the meaning of the law.\" Some sensible remarks on this case are to be\nfound in one or two papers, but the bulk of the Press make merry over \" the\nsuperstition,\" \"the mediaeval ignorance,\" \"the corporate blindness,\" etc., of the\nDistrict Council.\n2 In justice to Mr. Gataker I append the following extract from a letter of his\nwhich appeared in the Pall Mall Gazette for July 3rd, 1897 :\u2014\n\"Two misstatements have appeared in the papers in relation to my work for the\nAmpthill Urban District Council. The first misstatement is that a boring to 700 ft.\nwithout result was made on my advice. This is not the fact. A boring to a depth of\n700 ft. was, I believe, made at considerable expense, for a brewery company, long before\nI was consulted by the Council, and in a totally different locality to that in which I\nlocated the springs for the Council. . . . The second is that test borings were made\non my advice by the Council, and that my predictions were not verified. This, again,\nis not the fact. At the monthly meeting of the Council held on Tuesday, June 15th, the\nchairman of the Council, as reported in the Bedfordshire Mercury of Saturday,\nJune 19th, said : ' The Council had really tested but one of his spots (that is, the\nspots at which I had located springs for the Council), and there, where he said they\nwould find a yield of 2,500 gallons, they had actually found 2,800. He contended\nthat Mr. Gataker had been treated in a very un-English way.'\n\" It would be a matter of great gratification to me were the whole question\ninvestigated by some well-known scientific person, or scientific body.\"\nLeicester Gatakek.\n\fXXXII.] 237\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nexperiment was not, as stated in the papers, a complete failure, but the\nquantity of water found was less than anticipated and insufficient for\npublic purposes.\nThe action of the Local Government Board auditors in sur\ncharging some District Councils for fees paid to a dowser is closely\nconnected with the hostile, a priori, geological opinion that is now\ncurrent. And rightly so, for our administrators cannot go behind the\nrecognised and authoritative exponents of any branch of science and\nenquire whether their views are based on a wide, patient, and unbiassed\nexamination of the evidence for and against the possible existence of a\n\"dowsing faculty.\" It must be assumed that no competent scientific\nauthority would unhesitatingly give an opinion on any subject without\nhaving scientific grounds for so doing. The a priori improbability of\nany alleged phenomena, or the difficulty of finding any immediate\nexplanation, are grounds for demanding ample and trustworthy\nevidence, but are not reasons for rejecting such evidence, or science\nwould not have accepted the aid to surgery given by the Rontgen rays\n\u2014among other instances that might be cited. On the contrary, it is\nthe received dictum of scientific investigation, as long ago pointed out\nby Sir John Herschel, that \"The observer ... in any department\nof science . . . will have his eyes, as it were, opened, that they\nmay be struck at once with any occurrence which, according to received\ntheories, ought not to happen ; for these are the facts which serve as\nclues to new discoveries,\" i\u2014a sentence that might well form the\nmotto of our Society.\nPart V.\nBRIEF SURVEY OF THE EVIDENCE.\nTo those who have had the patience to toil through the wearisome\nbody of evidence which has so far been adduced, two things are\nsufficiently clear. One is, that the absurd and preposterous idea\nentertained by many advocates of the divining rod in the present\nday, as in the past, that the indications afforded by the \" rod \" are\ninfallible for whatever special purpose it is employed, has, it need\nhardly be said, no foundation in fact. The other is, that the current\nview entertained by most men of science, especially by geologists, that\nthere is nothing to investigate but \" absolute nonsense,\" \" a miserable\ni Discount on Natural Philosophy, section 127, p. 132. The italics are mine.\n\f238 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett\nsuperstition,\" \"a pestilent heresy,\" \"a bit of clever legerdemain,\"\nthat dowsers \"ought to be prosecuted for fraud,\"\u2014if not so absurd,\nis equally erroneous.\nWhatever be the explanation, the evidence shows that failures in\nthe use of the rod for the discovery of underground springs is a small\npercentage of the total number of trials tv\/ten a skilful dowser is\nemployed. How large the actual percentage of failure is, it is difficult\nto estimate. It varies undoubtedly, and very largely, with different\ndowsers ; with some, like the late John Mullins, the number of failures\nseems to have lx>en very few ; with others, failure is far more frequent.\nThis is what might Iie expected if there be a peculiar instinct or\nfaculty in certain persons which is not common to all. Moreover, as\nan easy way of earning a living without the trouble of any education,\nthe class of professional dowsers is sure to lie recruited by a number of\nrogues and charlatans, and also by ignorant fools, who, because a forked\ntwig turns in their hands, without any apparent muscular action on\ntheir part, call themselves \" water experts,\" and, as such, demand big\nfees from the credulous public who employ them. Such men are pretty\nsure to quote in large type the first sentence of this paragraph to\nadvertise themselves. An emphatic caution is therefore necessary in\nadvance, to warn the public against putting the smallest faith in the\npuffs of a dowser, unless his work has stood the test of thorough and\nindependent investigation.\nIt must not be assumed that all the professional dowsers whose\ncareers I have endeavoured to investigate are equally satisfactory.\nThe evidence shows that this is not the case ; on the contrary I have\ngrave doubts whether some of them are not self-deceived and their\nsuccesses due to mere chance. What is needed is a record of every\ntrial they have made for, say, a couple of years, and an exact statement\nof the results in each case ; supplemented by a report from a\ncompetent geological authority, as in many districts water-bearing\nstrata are easily reached over a wide area.\nBut how any reliable statistics of this kind are to be obtained I do\nnot know. All that was possible in the present investigation was to\nmake the range of evidence as wide and unbiassed as possible, and not\nexclude a single case of failure that was substantiated. This has been\ndone, and I may add here that among other enquiries as to failures, I\naddressed a letter to Uotes and Queries.\\ For many years past this\nuseful and carefully edited journal has published a large number of\nletters from various correspondents on the divining rod. Accordingly I\ni Notes and Queries, Eighth Series, Xo. 248, p. 255. The case of a failure in\nNorthumberland, quoted by an anonymous correspondent ill the previous volume of\nNotes and Queries, p. 336, probably refers to the one I have given on p. 144.\n\fXXXII.] 28I)\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nasked to be informed by letter or otherwise of any cases adverse to the\npretensions of the dowser. But I did not receive either publicly or\nprivately a single reply in the direction asked for, though fresh\ninstances of its successful use were given by subsequent correspondents,\nand other similar replies were sent to my private address.i It must,\nhowever, be borne in mind that (especially among amateur dowsers)\none is more likely to hear of success than of failure2; and therefore an\nextensive and searching enquiry is necessary before any safe induction\ncan be drawn. This must be my apology for the tedious length of the\nevidence cited, and the long delay in the publication of this paper.\nProtracted as this enquiry has been, it does not pretend to be a final\none, but only the starting point for further and more exhaustive\ninvestigation.\nTwo points adverse to the dowser must be noted. One is that their\ngeneral idea of the distribution of underground water is absurd. As\na rule, they imagine springs exist like a buried treasure, or as Mr.\nHolmes says \" like a pot of ancient coins,\" located to an area of a few\nsquare inches beneath the surface of the ground : or they believe these\nsprings to be the source of narrow underground rivers, which they\nprofess to trace to within an inch on either side. Underground water\nusually exists in wide saturated areas, as is fully explained in Appendix\nB. Nevertheless, the evidence cited in this paper shows, as is well-\nknown, that narrow streaks of permeable water-bearing strata,\u2014sand,\nor gravel, or rock, \u2014 or water-bearing fissures, do often occur in waterless\nlocalities, so that while water may not be found in one spot, it is found\nin another a few feet away, see e.g., Nos. 11, 27, 42, 89, p. 108, etc.\nI am not a geologist, and may be wrong, but it seems to me that\ngeologists have not sufficiently recognised this fact in their discussion\nof the subject.\nThe other fact adverse to the dowser is the failure or inconclusive\ncharacter of test experiments ; e.g., those I have made with Stearsand\nRodwell, the one Professor Sollas made with Young, and those Mr.\nWatney made at Wimbledon with Gataker and H. W. Mullins. To\nthis it may be replied that none of these dowsers are really in the first\nrank\u2014-like the late W. S. Lawrence and J. Mullins, (or Bleton of\nthe last century) ; and, except Young (whose case has already been\ndiscussed) and Stears, they are all comparatively young and in\nexperienced. Moreover,\u2014and this, I think, is the more cogent reply, \u2014\ni The Waterworks and Investment Review for May, 1807, contains an unsigned\narticle on the divining rod in which reference is made to a complete failure on the\npart of some dowser ; but no names or localities are given. I wrote to the editor to\nask for these particulars, but received no reply.\n'-'Of course professional dowsers give their \"hits\" and not their \"misses\" in\ntheir pamphlets, but their failures get sooner talked about for obvious reasons.\n\f240 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nthe conditions of the experiment did not sufficiently resemble the\nactual operations of the dowser in the discovery of underground\nsprings.i\nAfter all, the best test that can be applied is the result of actual\ntrials in finding water where wate>- had not been found before the\nadvent of the dowser. And here the evidence is so clear that I have\nnot the least hesitation in saying that, had I to sink a well, I should\nprefer to have the precise spot selected b)' a good dowser rather than\ngeneral advice given by a geologist,\u2014provided that the depth of the\nwell did not exceed, say, 50 feet, and the quantity of water required\nwas for a private and not for a public supply.2 Deep wells and large\nwater supplies should always be left to the hydro-geologist.\nAs a practical and commercial test, the evidence afforded by the\nowners and agents of landed property who have employed an expert\ndowser is of considerable value. In several of the letters I have\nreceived this opinion is incidentally expressed. Thus the Treasurer of\nthe Merchant Venturers' Society, Mr. G. H. Pope, writing to me from\nBristol, p. 67, says :\u2014\nOn the estates which I look after we always employ a dowser, and I do\nnot recollect any instance of failuro to find water ; we never sink a well\nbefore using the rod.\nThe forcible opinion of the experienced bailiff to these estates\n(p. 50) has already been quoted. If these witnesses be considered\nbiassed by local custom, this objection could hardly apply to an\nextensive Wiltshire land agent and surveyor like Mr. H. B. Napier,\nwho writes, p. 149 : \u2014\nI am so satisfied of the dowsers' power, that I should never dream of\nsinking a well without their assistance.\nOr again take the opinion given on pages 86 and 120 of Mr. Harben,\n(now Sir Henry Harben), whose judgment as one of the directors of\nthe New River Company and a business man of wide experience is\ncertainly entitled to no little weight. Or the opinion of Sir Welby\nGregory, Bart.,(p. 97) who states that he prefers to trust to the dowser\nrather than to the geologist in sinking wells ; or that of the Earl of\ni If, as is asserted, dowsers can discover water iunning in pipes underground, the\nexperiment ought to bo capable of easy disproof or verification This experiment I\npropose to try, though dowsers not being indigenous to Ireland makes the trial\nsomewhat more difficult for me to bring about. It need hardly he pointed out that,\nif established, the fact adds enormously to the difficulty of whatever explanation bo\nadopted. I am inclined to believe, in spite of the remarkable success which Bleton\nhad in this particularexperiment, that the results are due to indications unconsciously\ngiven by those who were conducting the experiment.\n3 The dowser will also, in most cases, take the risk of sinking a well on the\ncondition that if the promised supply be not found the loss will fall on himself.\n\fXXXII.] 241\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nWinchilsea, given on the same page. Or of Captain Grantham (p. 126)\nwho writes :\u2014\nI should not now think of sinking a well, when I was not sure of water,\nwithout the use of the divining rod.\nOr of Mr. Clifford Gibbons (p. 88), who says :\u2014\nThe thing is altogether a mystery to me, but certainly if I were to sink\nanother well, I should get Mullins to select the spot, as I have spent very\nlarge sums of money almost fruitlessly before I knew him.\nAgain, there is the opinion of a man of affairs and large landed\nproprietor like Mr. Christie-Miller, whose wife writes, p. 77 :\u2014\nWe are unable to quote an instance of failure with the divining rod,\nand can therefore speak most confidently in favour of water finding by the\ntwig. We have seven wells sunk after marking by Mullins with his rod.\nAn astronomer, Mr. Leeson Prince, writes, p. 80, \" I confess I have\nbeen converted to belief in the divining rod,\" and then gives his\nreasons, and the same opinion is expressed by others, e.g., Mr. Crump\nsays (p. 82), \" I became a convert against my will and so did others.\"\nMr. H. D. Skrine, D.L., states (p. 96), \"I cannot resist the conclusion\nthat it is a real gift possessed by some persons.\" Captain Penry Lloyd\nwrites, (p. 206), \"From a profound sceptic, I am now a firm believer in\nthe power of the rod,\" and other similar expressions of opinion founded\non experience might be cited, e.g., Mr. F. T. Elworthy on p. 6.\nIt may be useful to contrast with the foregoing the opinion of a\nleading English scientific journal. In Nature of June 10th, 1897, the\nfollowing comment appears a propos of the employment of a dowser\nat Ampthill, Bedfordshire.\nIt is depressing to think that there exist not only private persons, but\npublic bodies, who put more trust in the wild assertions of charlatans than\nin the matured conclusions of science. The latest instance of gullibility of\nthis character comes from Bedfordshire. . . . The decision [of the\nLocal Government Board auditor] will assist perhaps in reducing the number\nof believers in the water-diviner's art.\nThe editor of Nature will have cause to be still more depressed when\nhe hears from the distinguished Bursar of Trinity College, Cambridge,\nMr. R.T. Glazebrook, F.R.S., that his College has employed with success\na dowser on one of their estates. Mr. Glazebrook kindly put me in\ncommunication with Mr. Reginald Woolley, of Lincoln, the College agent,\nwho, in reply to my request for some particulars, writes as follows :\u2014i\nMinster Yard, Lincoln, June 20th, 1897.\nWe determined to try the dowser,\u2014who had been successful for my firm\nelsewhere,\u2014before undertaking experimental boring.\ni Owing to Mr. Woolley having been abroad for his health, his reply reached me\ntoo late for the insertion of this case in its proper place, Group IV.\nR\n\f242 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nI met John Mullins at the Farm (Walkeringham), alone with the tenant,\non May 16th, 1893. I took him to the place which would be convenient as\nthe site of a windmill pump to supply the farmstead. He soon passed a\npoint at which the twig turned up strongly. He estimated the spring as\nfairly good, and from 60 to 70 feet deep. He marked other points, but we\nbored only at the first. A spring was found at 45 feet 9 inches, and others\nat about 80 feet, the depth to which we went. These springs yield an\nample supply.\nA point of interest is that the contractor for the boring, who was a local\nman quite unconnected with Mullins, stated that if the boring had been\ndriven a few inches from the point fixed, the first spring would have been\nmissed-i Reginald Woolley.\nMr. Woolley's brother also wrote to me as follows : \u2014\nSouth Collingham, Newark, June 24th, 1897.\nWe have employed the late J. Mullins for other clients than Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, with satisfactory results.\nI made use of his services in Gloucestershire on Lord Leigh's estate,\nwhere he found us an excellent and invaluable spring of water.\nIt may interest you to know that in one spot where he indicated water,\nI took the twig in my own hands and went over the same spot with no result.\nHe then took hold of my wrists without touching the twig himself and\nwhen we together walked over the same place, the twig turned up in my\nhands. This was, I suppose, caused by muscular action on my part, but if\nso, it was certainly, as far as I was concerned, perfectly unconscious action.\nMy mental attitude was one of neutrality ! ^, qecil s Wooixey\nThe fact mentioned by Mr. Woolley in the latter part of his letter\nis also described by others, see p. 244.\nIt will be noticed later on that in the discovery of metallic veins\nthere also exists a considerable body of evidence in favour of the\npractical value of the indications afforded by the rod ; evidence that\nstretches back from the present time to the year 1540. But when we\ncome to the other multifarious uses to which the rod has been applied\nin the past, such as the finding of buried treasure, of lost property, of\nstrayed cattle, the settlement of disputed boundaries, the tracking of\ncriminals, and other uses in the moral world,\u2014all of which were\nrampant two centuries ago,\u2014its history will be seen to have been a very\nchequered one, ever apt to degenerate, as it once did, into a mis\nchievous superstition. Even at the present day, owing to the impulse\nthat moves the rod being apparently derived from an unseen external\nsource, some perfectly honest dowsers will tell you they can find the\ndifference between a bucket of spring or rain water (e.g., No. 30),\ni How the contractor knew this is not stated : I do not dispute the fact, as similar\nstatements by others abound, but the reason should in each case be given.\u2014W.F.B.\n\fXXXII.] 243\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\ncan discover hidden coins, buried treasure and buried objects of all\nkinds, can trace underground gas pipes and electric cables, find the\nplace where you intended to hide an object, or the spot on which you\nhave breathed, or on which a ray of light has fallen, etc. ! In a few\nof these things the reading of natural signs, such as the disturbed\nsurface of the ground, or of unconscious signs or thought-transference\nfrom those who knew the position of the object searched for, will\nexplain such success as is observed ; but otherwise, needless to say,\nfailure is absolute, when chance coincidence is excluded and a rigid\ninvestigation made ; proof of this will be given subsequently.\nPart VI.\nTHEORETICAL CONCLUSIONS.\nThese remarks will help to clear the ground, and enable me\npresently to give a brief enunciation of the provisional laws which\nappear to me to embrace the whole of the phenomena of the divining\nrod. It is, however, desirable that the reader should bear in mind that\nthe subject before us is necessarily a most entangled one, and that the\nusual rough and ready explanations, given by the scoffer on the one\nhand and the believer on the other, are wholly inadequate from any\nrational point of view. Problems of considerable scientific interest\nappear to be involved.\n(i.) Few will dispute the proposition that the motion of the forked\ntwig is due to unconscious muscular action. When the rod is held in\nthe manner described by Cookworthy (see Appendix C), as was the\ncustom up to recent years, it is more or less in a sensitive state (p. 11),\nand an unintentional and almost imperceptible approach of the two\nhands will cause it to turn upwards. But this is not the case when\nthe rod is held as J. Mullins used to hold it, or as many other dowsers\nhold it at the present day. I have tried, and asked many friends to\ntry, to rotate the rod under these circumstances, and it is certainly\nmost difficult to produce any motion of the twig without a very visible\nmotion of the hands. This, however, is not all. Both with practised\nprofessional dowsers like Lawrence and J. Mullins, and with amateurs\nlike the Rev. J. Blunt, Lady Milbanke, and others, the forked twig\nnot only rotates, but one limb is frequently twisted completely off by\nthe force with which it is driven round and round; see e.y., Nos. 1, 4,\n12, 18, 45, 53, 60, 107, 115, and pp. 57, 110, 133. How is this to be\neitplained ? A good deal depends on the thickness of the twig. This\nvaries ; some dowsers use a thickish forked stick, others a much more\nr 2\n\f244 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nslender one. The twig that Colonel Waring, M.P., sent me, which was\nthe actual one he had seen thus twisted and broken in the hands of\nMullins, is about as thick as a cedar pencil in the thickest part and\ntapers off ; the exact dimensions are given in the foot-note to p. 79.\nUsing this twig neither I, nor any muscular friends who tried, could\nin the least imitate the effect produced by Mullins. One side must of\ncourse be rigidly held and the other allowed to rotate, and the fists\nmust be kept practically still. Any one can cut a forked twig and try\nthe experiment ; the only advantage of hazel is that the two limbs are\nmore symmetrical in size, and the wood is tough. One witness states\nthat even when the rod was held between pincers (bottom of p. 86)\n\" the contortions still went on.\"\nCertainly no voluntary effort, without long and laborious practice at\nlegerdemain, could produce an effect corresponding in kind or degree\nto that which actually takes place in the cases cited. We may com\npare it, as regards the kind of motion, to the involuntary pressure\nexerted by the \" medium \" or agent, which guides the percipient in\nthe \" willing game,\" or the quasi thought-reader in writing down the\nnumber of a bank note,\u2014a sub-conscious pressure that cannot be\nintentionally imitated by voluntary effort. And so also, in degree,\nthe amazing force with which the twig is sometimes twisted, without\napparent cause, is like the extraordinary and involuntary spasm of\nmuscular power, which often occurs in cases of hysteria or in moments\nof great excitement, and which cannot be repeated at will in the\nordinary state.\n(ii.) There is also another curious point which cannot be disputed,\nfor it rests not only upon the testimony of numerous credible witnesses\nat the present day and in England alone, but, as historical investiga\ntion has revealed, goes back to a remote period and was as noticeable\nwith Bleton, in Dauphiny, in 1780, as with Mullins, in Wiltshire, a\ncentury later. This is the apparent transmission of the power to twist\nthe rod from the dowser to another person whose wrist he grasps.\nThe twig, hitherto passive, immediately begins to move in the hands of\nthe second person, without conscious effort on his part, and in a\nmanner he could not imitate at will ; among other instances which are\ngiven, see Nos. 53, 6l, 83, and pp. 35, 242. Here also the directive action\nmay be analogous to the faint sub-conscious muscular pressure that is\ntransmitted from the agent to the quasi thought-reader. In any case\nthe phenomena described in this and the two preceding paragraphs\nseem worthy of more careful investigation by the trained physiologist.\n(iii.) The same remark applies to another interesting characteristic\nof dowsing, which is as follows. A successful dowser has to \" set \"\nhimself (as some term it), when he uses the rod or trusts to his\nsensations in dowsing. By this he means rendering himself as far as\n\fxxxn.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 245\npossible oblivious to the ordinary stream of sense impressions ; making\nhis mind as passive, as effortless, and as much a tabula rasa as he can.i\nA psychical state appears to be set up, analogous to that which a good\nsubject in the \" willing game,\" or in telepathic experiments, is able to\nbring about. This is a well-known condition of automatism. Just as\nwhen the sun sinks the stars become visible, so the dark continent\nwithin us, the large unconscious background of our life, only emerges\nwhen the light of consciousness is dimmed. A good dowser is largely\nan automatist and the rod is a convenient form of autoscope.\nFurther it is occasionally noticed in the so-called willing game\nthat a sense of malaise, a faintness and trembling, sometimes even a\nmore serious nervous shock, is exhibited by a successful subject (see\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. I., p. 57, etc.). A similar physiological\ndisturbance is still more frequently exhibited by the dowser. For one\nof the curious and well-attested facts revealed in the course of this\nenquiry is that an obscure pathological or sensory effect, sometimes\nresulting in a convulsive action either of the limbs or epigastric region,\nis exhibited by the dowser when he is on the \"scent.\"2 This cannot\nbe a stage effect, nor a traditional idea transmitted from one dowser\nto the other, for it crops up in all parts of Europe and will be found\namongst the most illiterate dowsers, from the time of Jacques Aymar\nin 1692 to Bleton a century later, and is exhibited to-day by dowsers\nin the country districts of England. I have given historic and con\ntemporary evidence of this in Appendix D, but the reader will have\nnoticed how this sensory effect is referred to incidentally in some of\nthe evidence already cited. The asserted sensations may be due to\ncauses purely imaginary on the part of the dowser, but to what\nassociation of ideas is this widespread illusion due 1 It seems more\nprobably a genuine physiological disturbance, due to a pyschological\ncause common to the group of sub-conscious phenomena of which the\ndivining rod is a remarkable type.3\ni That a partial hypnosis occurs with some dowsers is very probable. I have\nreferred to this elsewhere.\n2 The sympathetic nervous system, especially the solar plexus, appears to be\nthe chief seat of the disturbance with the dowser, as it is also frequently asserted\nto be among so-called clairvoyantes in the hypnotic state.\n3 In an article published in Light for August 4th, 1883, p. 349, it is stated that\nProfessor Lochman, of the University of Christiania, who is described as a\ndistinguished physiologist, recently read a pap>r on the divining rod before a\nscientific society in Christiania, in which he stated that his scepticism on this subject\nhad lately been overcome by the discovery that he himself could use the rod success\nfully He had personally tested its indications over and over again, and was now\nconvinced that a peculiar gift, of which he could give no explanation, was possessed\nby certain persons that enabled them to find underground water He thought the\nphenomenon was of a physiological nature, an opinion with which Professor Monrad,\nan eminent confrere, agreed. I should be grateful if any friends at Christiania could\nsend me particulars of the foregoing report.\n\f246 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\n(iv.) Another point that appears worthy of enquiry is, why should\nthe rod move in the hands of some persons and not with others ? In\nthe answer to this there is, of course, involved the whole phenomena\nof automatism, and the general theory of autoscopes, like plauchette,\netc. Reliable statistics are wanting as to the number of persons in\nevery hundred who can use the rod. Amoretti, working in Italy\ntowards the close of the last century, states, in his Sloria delta\nRahlomanzia, that he found 20 per cent, of the persons he tried had\nthe \"gift.\" Sementini, Professor of Chemistry in the University of\nNaples, who published a short treatise on the rod in 1 81 0,1 thinks this\nestimate too small, and that probably in 4 out of 5 persons the rod will\nmove successfully : but I prefer Amoretti's estimate. The children of\ndowsers almost invariably can manipulate the rod ; they have \" caught\nthe trick,\" or \"inherited the instinct \" from their father,\u2014the reader\nwill take which view he pleases : probably there is some truth in both\npoints of view.\n(v.) We have now to consider what determines the automatic motion\nof the rod ; what pulls the trigger 1 The first point to be noticed is\nthe prior intention of the dowser. As Malebranche pointed out two\ncenturies ago, the rod moves only for that particular thing the diviner\nhas the intention of discovering. When Jacques Aymar was in search\nfor underground water, his rod was unaffected by the track of a\ncriminal, or vice versd. And so to-day, if a mineral lode be the object\nof quest, a sheet of underground water may be passed over without\nany effect on the dowser or his rod. The object to which the dowser\n\" sets \" himself is the determining factor in the unconscious move\nment he imparts to the rod.\nPrecisely similar is the preconceived idea that electricity is the\ncause of the motion of the rod, an idea entertained by most dowsers\nand by others ignorant of physics. Dr. Thouvenel was the first to\nsuggest this explanation in 1781, nor did the complete experimental\ndisproof of his explanation, given by some distinguished physicists in\nParis at the time, much affect his belief. \" I strongly suspect it is the\ndevil ; but if not, it must be electricity \" is still the explanation given\nby multitudes who encounter any phenomena outside the daily range\nof their somewhat limited experience. Hence it is improbable any\nthing I can say will disturb so widely cherished and so simple a faith.\nLest, however, I myself should be accused of sacrificing truth to a\npreconceived idea, I made some direct experiments on this very\npoint, visiting the N.E. of Ireland for the purpose of meeting an\nunsophisticated amateur dowser, who, with his master, strongly held\nto \" electricity.\" It is needless to detail my experiments ; suffice it to\nPcmieri <\u2022 Sperimcnli sulla Bac\/uita Divinatoria, p. 24.\n\fxxxil] On the So-called Divining Rod. 247\nsay that when the dowser believed I had insulated him from the\nearth, the rod ceased to move ; when he believed he was electrically\nconnected with the earth, the rod promptly moved. Nevertheless, in\nthe former case he was, unknown to himself, uninsulated and in\nthe latter insulated. It was the dowser's idea, and not electricity,\nthat moved the rod.\nThat the motion of the divining rod is determined by a fixed but\nsub conscious idea is seen again and again in a historical study of our\nsubject. The most striking example of this will be found in the pre\ncisely opposite behaviour of the rod claimed by some now, and by those\nwho used it in the search for metals 1 50 years ago. Some assert when a\nsimilar metal to that in the vein was held in the hand, it arrested the\nmotion of the rod ; others that a similar metal held in the hand had no\neffect, but a dissimilar arrested the rod.i Again take the following\nfrom Dr. Mayo, F.R.S., who, in 1847, made some experiments with the\ndivining rod when he was staying at a watering place in Russia.\nFour or five persons were found in whose hand the forked twig\nmoved, though they had, presumably, never seen a divining rod\nbefore. With one of these the rod moved in the orthodox way\nwhether he walked backwards or forwards, with others the rod\nreversed the direction of its motion when they walked backwards.2\nDr. Mayo then says :\u2014\nI tried some experiments, touching the point of the rod with a magnetic\nneedle. I found, in the course of them, that when my man knew which way\nI expected the fork to move, it invariably answered my expectations ; but\nwhen I had the man blindfolded, the results were uncertain and\ncontradictory. The end of all this was, that I became certain that several of\ni In a little work on the divining rod by an American engineer, Mr. Latimer, C.E.,\nit is stated that a Mr. Sangster, of Tennesse, wrote to the author in 1870, that he had\nbeen 50 yearsexperimenting with therod, and added \" I can tell to a certainty whether\nI am over any substance, either water or mineral. ... I find out by taking a\nsponge and saturating it with ordinary water, putting it on the top of the rod ; if the\nsubstance beneath be water of the same kind, it will turn much stronger. If the rod\nshould not turn at all, it will be some other substance, either mineral or metal. The\ntests are made in the same manner for metals. I put a piece of metal on the top of\nthe rod,\u2014iron, lead, silver, copper, etc.,\u2014until I find one of these that will cause the\nrod to turn in a manner sufficiently strong ;\u2014that indicates the same metal under\nground.\" Mr. Latimer, who could also use the rod, says that after receiving this\nletter he made similar experiments, and arrived at the conclusion that Mr. Sangster1*\nstatements were quite correct ! \" I took a wet rag,'' he remarks on p. 81, \" and fastened\nit on to the top of the twig or divining rod ; 1 found the rod turned over a cistern of\nwater, but would not turn over iron pii>es. I then put a key at the end of the rod\nover the wet rag ; now the rod at once turned over the iron pipes.\" Contrast this with\nthe opposite results given by Cookworthy, etc., in Api>endix C ! Mr. Latimer also\nsays, \" Upon insulating myself there was no motion of the rod, which proves the\nmotion is due to electricity.\" Contrast Mr. Blunt's experience, given on the top of\npage 27, when he was insulated by thick rubber shoes.\na See also an example of this I have given in No. 13, p 38.\n\f4.S [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nthose in whose hands the divining rod moves [unconsciously] set it in motion.\nIn walking forwards the hands are unconsciously borne towards each other ;\nin walking backwards, the reverse is the case. i\nA curious example of the influence of unconscious intention is to be\nfound in Priestley's old work on Electricity. A distinguished scientific\nman, Dr. Grey, in 1736 thought he had discovered the fact that light\nbodies, when suspended and electrically attracted, always moved from\nwest to east. This Grey thought was the secret of the mechanism of\nthe heavens and he sent his results to Dr. Mortimer, the Hon.\nSecretary of the Royal Society. Dr. Mortimer repeated the experi\nments and obtained similar results.2 Dr. Wheeler, however, repeated\nwith great care the experiments and showed that a preconceived notion\nor the desire to produce this particular movement of an electrified\nbody, really determined its direction, unknown to the experimenter.\nFor the movement was only produced when the body was suspended\nfrom the experimenter's hand, but not when it was suspended from a\nfixed support. It was in fact a form of pendule explorateur,\u2014usually\na ring suspended by a thread and thus held by the fingers in a glass ;\nthis will often strike the hour of the day or oscillate in a determined\ndirection. The motion of the divining rod and of the pendule are\nequally due to a latent prior intention and unconscious muscular\naction.\nWhat then, it may be asked, remains to be investigated if this be\nthe key to the mystery 1 The answer to this has already been given in\nthe survey of evidence cited, where the success of the dowser remains\nto be explained. Is this merely due to his practical knowledge of the\nsigns of underground water 1\n(vi.) The opinion that certain appearances on the surface of the\nground do indicate the site for shallow wells,\u2014i.e. the existence\nof underground water comparatively near the surface\u2014as other\nappearances also indicate underground metallic veins, has long been\nentertained, and with more or less justice. Mr. De Ranee, on p. 234,\nhas already referred to one of these signs, and Paramelle, in his\nwork on the Discovery of Springs, to which reference is made in\nAppendix B, quotes several of these traditions. In the treatise on\nWells in Weale's series, 7th edition, 1877, p. 22, it is stated, as a guide\nto the well sinker :\u2014\n(1.) That when the grass is of a brighter colour on one part of a\nfield than another, or when in ploughed ground the earth is of a\ndarker hue in one place, water may be suspected below.\ni Mayo, Truths contained in Popular Superstitions, p. I!I.\n2 See Priestley's Electricity, London, 1775, p. 60, et seq ; also Phil.

It is said well sinkers in Northern Italy determine the site\nfor a well by lying on the ground and looking towards the sun in the\nearly morning ; wherever the exhalation of vapour from the ground is\nseen to be more copious, that spot is selected.\nThis last appears to have been an ancient practice ; the power of\ndetecting the vapour doubtless varies with different people ; moreover\nsome appear to have an abnormal sensitiveness and it has even been\nsupposed that they are able to perceive it by other methods than sight ;\nsee e.g., the letter quoted at the end of Appendix D.\nThus also the learned Jesuit Dechales, in his Mundus Mathematicus,\nwhich was published in Lyons in 1674, states in Vol. II., p. 190, that\na certain noble person, whom he knew, could not only find springs by\nthe bending of a forked twig of hazel, \" so surely that he could\ntrace the whole course of the underground water ; but he had\nalso other signs, for he used to detect a vapour Issuing from the earth,\nand by this means immediately pointed out the head of the spring.\"\nOwing to the wonderful power of discernment of this ancient amateur\ndowser, Dechales says:\u2014\"At first I suspected he had a compact\nwith the devil, but when I observed no incantations nor sorcery, I\nsuspended my judgment, as there are many things we know to be\ntrue, but cannot explain.\" 2\nThis philosophical remark of Dechales' may also be applied to the\nwell known idiosyncracies of certain persons which afford an instruc\ntive parallel, the faintest trace of certain odours or the presence of\ncertain animals, etc, being instantly detected by, and often causing\nextreme discomfort to, such persons, who are abnormally sensitive in\none direction. Probably a divining rod held by these sensitives\nwould be unconsciously and vigorously moved by them, in the\ni There is also a curious tradition referred to by the late Dr. Brewer, and used\nby Thomas Moore in one of his poems, that in Arabia the lapwing indicates the\npresence of an underground spring.

In \" Lalla Rookh \" Moore sings :\u2014\n\" Fresh as the fountain under ground.\nWhen first 'tis by the lapwing found.\"\nA note explains : \"The hudhud, or lapwing, is supposed to have the power of\ndiscovering water under ground.\"\u2014W.F.B.\n2 This passage translated from Dechales is the earliest account I can find of the\nsuccessful use of the divining rod for the discovery of springs.

Barrett.\npresence of the obnoxious object, and thus reveal it, even before the\nsense of discomfort had risen to the level of a conscious impression.\nDoubtless in all these cases the impression comes through one of the\nrecognised channels of sense ; in the same way as acute vision enables\nsome persons to detect distant objects, invisible to others, or an acute\nsense of smell enables the bloodhound to trace the footsteps of a\nfugitive. The Zahories of Spain were credited with a miraculous sense\nof vision i : a writer in the Quarterly Review (Vol. II., p. 264) says,\n\" The Zahories, by attending to indications which escape the less\nexperienced eye, are able to give a tolerable guess of underground\nwaters. Something similar is told of the Arabs of the desert . . .\nwho have the faculty of discovering distant wells by signs which do\nnot affect the senses of Europeans.\" The camel is said to have a\nsimilar power of discovering unseen water.\nAccording to Professor Milne, who was for many years Professor\nat Tokio in Japan, and has devoted his life to a study of seismic\nphenomena, the faint preliminary tremors of an earthquake, detected\nby extraordinarily sensitive apparatus, are perceived by pheasants,\ngeese, ponies and some other animals. Professor Milne states that\n\" the late Professor Sekiya, of Tokio, kept pheasants in order to\nobserve their behaviour at the time of earthquakes, with the result\nthat he found they gave him a few seconds' warning of shocks of\nlocal origin by screaming.\"\nIn the United States dowsers are often used to find mineral oil\nsprings and are called oil-smellers ; though it is probable keen observa\ntion rather than a keen sense of smell is employed. So, too, in parts\nof Ireland I am informed that the local fishermen term the look-out\nman who apprises them of the approach of fish the herring smeller,\nthough I imagine in this case it is unquestionably the sense of sight,\nand not of smell, that is concerned.\nIt is possible, therefore, that the professional dowser has the power\nof detecting signs of underground water which escape the ordinary\nobserver, and as this power would be trained by long practice at one\nemployment, part of their success may fairly be taken to be due to this.\ni The only authentic reference in history to the Zahories which I have been able\nto find is in Delrio's Latin folio on Magic, published 300 years ago. In a passage which\nwill bp quoted in the subsequent historical paper, Delrio says in 1575 he met one of these\nZahories in Madrid, and that the man could see underground metals, water, and\nburied corpses. No evidence is however adduced, but it appears to have been a long\nstanding tradition with this tribe of Spanish gypsies, as they probably were. Delrio\nsays the facts are \"most fully received and well known,\" and he adds, \"the\nZahuris probably know veins of water from the vapours exhaled at those places\nmormng and evening, and veins of metal from the kind of grass growing there ;\nbut treasure and corpses I consider are indicated by demons.\" (!) Delrio spells the\nword Zahuris, and says, \" the redness of their eyes is particularly to be observed.\"\n\fXXXII.] 251\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nBut it does not cover all the ground. The supposition of Mr. Holmes\nthat professional dowsers have a hereditary practical knowledge of\nthe geological features which indicate the presence of subterranean\nsprings has no support ; Lawrence was a stonemason, so was Mullins,\nTompkins was a farmer, Stone a drainage artizan, Stears a gas-\nengineer, etc. The fathers of none of these were dowsers, nor did they\nknow any of the secrets of their craft, if such exist, when they scored\ntheir early successes. Mr. Holmes, however, very justly points out that\nuneducated persons, as many of these dowsers are, usually imagine\nthemselves the possessors of abnormal gifts when they find they can\ndiscern natural signs overlooked by the ordinary observer, and further\nthey exaggerate their success by regarding the underground water,\nwhich may really extend over acres or square miles, as if it were only a\nfew square inches in area, and located at one spot like a buried treasure.\nBut, as already remarked, the striking successes of the dowser in find\ning water where none existed in adjacent wells is probably due to his\ndiscovery of fissures, or jointing, or water-bearing veins. But the same\nproblem meets us : how is he able to discern from a superficial inspec\ntion of ground, often entirely new to him and sometimes covered with\nsnow (No. 103, p. 151), the signs which indicate these interruptions\nof continuity in the strata below ? See e.g., Nos. 57, 88, etc.\n(vii.) The question then before us is whether the success of a good\ndowser is only due to his practical knowledge of surface water-bearing\nlocalities, indications being perceived by him that escape an ordinary\nobserver ; or to some peculiar instinct or faculty, the explanation of\nwhich involves considerations new to science. Mr. Holmes, F.G.S.,\nwrites to me to say that, \" looking at the professional dowser as the\npossessor of an ancient practical knowledge of surface water-bearing\nbeds, I should expect him to be right in detecting them 19 times\nout of 20 . . . but when they trust to their sensations to 'locate\nsprings ' in the water-bearing bed, they become the victims of\ndelusion.\"\nFour methods suggest themselves at first sight in order to test\nwhether the pretensions of the dowser have any more solid basis than\nchance coincidence, or shrewdness gained from long experience at one\nvocation. The successful issue of any of these tests would go far to\nprove the dowser was not a charlatan, but the tests 1 and 3a would only\nshow that his success might be due merely to a useful practical\nknowledge of water bearing localities. The suggested tests are :\u2014\n(1) Separate and entirely independent examination by different\ndowsers.\n(2) Blindfolding the dowser with care and taking him over the\nground again ; or repeating the trial on a dark night.\n\f252 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\n(3a) Geological opinion as to whether water is, or is not, likely to\nbe found on the spots and at the depths indicated by the dowser ; i.e.,\nagreement of geologist and dowser. Or, more conclusive (3\/3), dowser\nversus geologist,\u2014water actually found at the spot and about the\ndepth predicted by the dowser, in spite of geological opinion to the\ncontrary.\n(4) A well or boring made to a corresponding depth in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of where water has been found by the\ndowser, but at a spot where no spring was indicated by the dowser.\nAll of these tests, successfully made, are to be found in the course\nof the evidence in the foregoing paper, e.g.,\nTest 1 in Nos. 6 ; 7 ; 17 ; 23 (p. 47) ; 46 ; 54 ; 63 ; 70 and 135.\nTest 2 in Nos. 2 ; 6 ; 17 ; 25 ; 45 (p. 70) ; 69 (p. 95) ; 73 ; 74.\nTest 33, in Nos. 42 ; 52 (pp. 78 and 106) : 58 (pp. 85 and 117) ;\n73; 88 (p. 128).\nTest 4 in upwards of 50 of the cases cited.\nBut these tests are of very different value. Tests 1 and 2 are liable\nto be vitiated by sign-reading or thought-transference from the\nbystanders (assuming telepathy to be a vera causa). Test 3a is\noccasionally quite misleading, as the Horsham and Waterford experi\nments, and other cases of 30, illustrate. The most reliable test is the last\nnamed, namely, borings in adjacent places made either before or after\nthe advent of the dowser. The existence of such borings has chiefly\ninfluenced me in the selection of the evidence presented in this paper.\nLet me, therefore, enumerate the cases where adjacent wells or\nborings, which yielded little or no water, had been made to at least\nthe same depth as the successful wells or borings located by the\ndowser. So far as I am able to judge, 40 of these may be regarded as\ngood evidential cases ; these are :\u2014\nWith Miscellaneous dowsers Nos. 3a; 9; 10; 11; 17;\n23 (?) ; 24 ; 25 ; 26 ; 27 ; 28 Total, 11\nW.

It will, I think,\nbe admitted by every candid and careful reader that the evidence on\nthe whole affords a strong primd facie case on behalf of the existence\nof some peculiar instinct or faculty in certain individuals, the explana\ntion of which is not to be found in the narrow region of the dowser's\nconscious experience, but in the wider realm of his sub-conscious life.i\n\"Whether this faculty, which we may provisionally assume to exist, is\nso rare as it appears, whether it is hereditary, or whether it can be\nexalted by cultivation, are questions to be answered in the future.2\nThe explanation of the divining rod is therefore probably a\ncomplex one, and its full discussion cannot be appreciated until the\nreader is in possession of the historical evidence to be adduced in a\nsubsequent paper. Here it will suffice to say that doubtless a sub\nconscious suggestion, of some kind, evoked in the dowser's mind, excites\nthe reflex action to which the actual movement of the rod is due.\nThe evidence shows that this suggestion cannot come only from a\ncapricious idea in the dowser's own mind, but is also derived from an\nimpression he gains from without : how far that impression is cor\nrelated to the object of his search, and if so, how much is due to\npractical knowledge, and how much is due to some unknown\ncause or unrecognised instinct, are questions which can only be solved\nby a careful study of ample and trustworthy evidence. Cases such as\nthe Waterford and Horsham experiments, where special precautions\nwere taken, and the ground was entirely new to the dowser, or some\nof Stone's cases, such as those on pages 128 and 129, and others, tend\nto exclude the idea of any information being derived from surface\nindications or practical knowledge, and suggest either a novel and\nuseful instinct on the part of the dowser, or that his perception is due\nto some physical effect associated with underground water. The recent\ndiscovery of a new type of obscure radiation from certain bodies, such\nas uranium salts, and also from numerous common bodies with which\nwe are surrounded, renders it conceivable that a radiation, to which\nopaque bodies are permeable, may be emitted by water and metals,\nwhich unconsciously impresses some persons.

James' Text-book on Psychology, p. 217.\n2 It must not be assumed, let me repeat, that ability to twist the rod necessarily\nindicates the existence of a dowsing faculty in the operator.

Barrett.\nthe way of this, or any physical hypothesis,\u2014a difficulty which would\nbe insuperable but for the fact that no hypothesis can be purely\nphysical where human automatism plays so large a part\u2014is that\nwhich Malebranche pointed out 200 years ago, viz., that exposed\nrunning water and exposed metals ought to produce a still greater\neffect than those that are underground and further off, and yet the\ndowser appears for the most part insensible to these.\nAssuming the actual motion of the rod to be caused by involuntary\nmuscular action, a summary of the causes determining that motion,\nexcluding of course cases of fraud or self-delusion, may, in my opinion,\nbe given as follows :\u2014\n(1) In every case the direction of the motion of the rod, upwards\nor downwards, and probably in all cases the motion itself, will be found\nto arise from a suggested or preconoeived, but usually latent, idea in\nthe dowser's own mind. It is the unconscious emergence of a fixed or\nderived idea registered in, or made upon, the sub-conscious self.i\n(2) In some cases (such as those already alluded to, finding coins,\netc.) an idea is unconsciously conveyed to the dowser's mind by almost\nimperceptible signs, unintentionally made by those present ; or by (3).\n(3) In many cases, an impression from without, derived through\nthe ordinary channels of sensation, appears to be unconsciously made\nupon the dowser by faint indications associated in the dowser's mind\nwith the particular object of his search. These indications,\u2014usually\nvisual, or it may be a vague diffused sensation,\u2014would probably\nentirely escape the bystander : the impression that comes in through\nthe sensory apparatus going out through the hands of the dowser\nwithout recognition or conscious effort on his part. Added to this we\nhave the ordinary observing power of the dowser, trained by years\nof continuous practice at one particular occupation, and constantly\nconfirmed or corrected by the results of his previous trials.\n(4) In other cases, however, an impression from without appears\nto be gained, not through the ordinary channels of sensation.\nThought-transference will, I believe, be found to receive remarkable\ni An amusing illustration of the effect of suggestion in determining the motion\nof the rod is given by Mr. E. B. Tylor, D.C.L., F.R.S., (Nature, May 17th, 1883,\np 58) ; the suggestion in this case arising purely from an association of ideas. Mr.\nTylor remarks that he does not believe that the dowser fraudulently moves the rod,\nbut that slight movements of his hands unconsciously cause the twig to turn, and\nhe adds, \" I noticed that, when I allowed my attention to stray, the rod would from\ntime to time move in my hands in a way so lifelike that an uneducated person might\nwell suppose the movement to be spontaneous.\"\n\fXXXII.] 255\nOn the So-called Divining Rod.\nconfirmation from experiments with the dowsing rod. But only here\nand there can this agency be even supposed in the evidence cited in\nthis paper : it may occasionally come into play in finding hidden coins,\nor tracing the direction of underground pipes conveying water.i\n(5) There appears to be evidence that a more profound stratum\nof our personality, glimpses of which we get elsewhere in our\nProceedings, is associated with the dowser's art ; and the latter seems\nto afford a further striking instance of information obtained through\nautomatic means being often more reliable than, and beyond the reach\nof, that derived from conscious observation and inference.2 The whole\nof the evidence cited, in my opinion, cannot be explained away merely\nby the practical knowledge of the dowser, nor by the explanations\ngiven in 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nIn some cases a peculiar pathological effect is produced upon\nthe dowser, often strong enough to rise to the level of consciousness\nand even discomfort ; or it may be so weak that it is not perceived,\nthough sufficient to start the motion of the rod.3 This effect appears\nto be associated with the object of the dowser's search, and may be\nmerely due to nervous excitement, or a secondary result of some\nhitherto unsuspected impression made upon the nerve centres of\ncertain individuals. Whether, if this latter be the case, it can be\ntraced to an abnormal sensibility of one or other of the recognised\nchannels of sensation, resembling the hyperesthesia of hypnotised\nsubjects, or is due to some more transcendental psychological condition,\nor, far less probably, to some physical cause, can only be conclusively\nascertained by a persevering and unbiassed investigation, which this\npaper may perhaps help to stimulate.\ni The fact that the water must be running and not atagnant (see Nos. 56, 74, etc.),\nsuggests that hearing, or possibly a slight tremor produced by the running water,\nmay be the means whereby the desired information is picked up by the sub-conscious\nor secondary self. Sir Philip Smyly, M.D., told me of a hypersesthetic patient of his,\nwho heard and repeated to him the words he had uttered in a low voice two Moors\nbelow, and with closed doors between. Hearing in such cases is beyond the normal\npower of strained attention, as any one can prove. The most remarkable instance of\nthe dowser's power of tracing underground water pipes, conveying running water,\noccurred with Bleton and will be given in the subsequent historical paper.\n2 Numerous cases of extraordinary subliminal perception are given by Mr\nF. W. H. Myers in his essays on the subliminal self published in our Proceedings.\nThe frequent success of the dowser in forecasting the approximate depth of springs\nis remarkable (see pp. 02, 76, 100, 119, etc.) ; but it n^eds somewhat more evidence to\neliminate local knowledge and chance coincidence.\n8 See Appendix D.\n\f256 Professor W.

The word\ndow3e must not be confounded with the word douse (pronounced to rhyme with\nhouse) which has various meanings in our language, and, according to Dr. Murray,\nhas no etymological connexion with dowse or dowser.\n2 Since this was printed, I have found the word josing mentioned at the close of\nthe 18th century by Billingsley in his Surrey of the County Somerset, Bath, 17I)7 i he says\nthe miners in the Mendip Hills use the divining rod, \" which they call josing, etc.\" ;\nhe goes on to speak of their complete faith in its efficacy,\u2014a faith which is as strong\namong the miners in the Mendips to-day as it has been for the last 250 years. Locke's\nacquaintance with the word denting rod may be accounted for by the fact that he was\na native of Somerset and born under the shadow of the Mendips. The published\ncopy of Locke's letter on Lowering of Interest in the British Museum is dated 1692,\nand the page on which the word \" deusing rod or Virgila {tic) Divina \" occurs is 127,\nnot 40, as given above.\n\fXXXII.] 257\nAppendix A.\nthere in Borlase's Natural History of Cornwall (1758,) where the\ndivining rod or virgula divinatoria is referred to ; neither is there in\nthe Gentleman's Magazine of 1751, where there is a lengthy description\nof the rod ; nor are the words used in the account of the divining rod\nin North Wales, given by Pennant in his Tour in Wales, 1770, nor\nin a similar work by Mr. Evans in 1800, nor in Emerson's account of\nthe rod in New Hampshire (U.S.) given in 1821, nor in the lengthy and\ndetailed paper on the rod given in the American Journal of Science\nfor 1826. Moreover in the earliest English accounts of the divining rod\nwhich my investigations have recently brought to light, viz., Childrey's\nBritannia Baconia, or Natural Rarities of England, 1660, G. Platte's\nDiscovery of Subterranean Treasure, 1638, and the extract from\nBoyle's works, 1663, to be given later on, there is no mention of the\nword deusing, or dowsing rod, or dowser. The use of the word\ndeusing rod by Locke in 1691, is therefore remarkable and apparently\nunique, until we come to 1830, when the word is used freely in the\nQuarterly Mining Review of that date, Vol. I.\nIn the glossary of Pryce's work already mentioned, and also in the\nglossary to Borlase's Cornwall (1758) occurs the Cornish word \"dizzue,\nto discover unto; to dizzue a lode is to discover or expose the good ore.\"\nLooking at Locke's \" deusing rod,\" I thought that possibly a \"dowser\"\nmight originally have been a \"dizzuer\" of a lode. But Dr. Murray\ntells me that this word dizzue is entirely irrelevant, and neither in\nsound nor sense allied to dowse.i The same remark, Dr. Murray\nsays, applies to the well-known word \" douse,\" which is common in\nCornwall for dipping or lowering, as \"douse the sail.\" Dr. Murray\nalso points out that we must not make too much of Locke's spelling,\nsince the word occurs in a single passage, and may be merely a\nmisprint for dousing, which in the case of an unknown word might\neasily happen. Such instances are not at all uncommon. But it may\nalso be founded in the Somerset and Devon pronunciation, since in\nthese dialects ou or ow is often sounded in a way that a \" foreigner \"\nmight mistake for en or ew. De Quincey and some other writers of\nthe present century have spelt the word jowser or jouser, and we\nlearn from the West Somerset Wordbook, by Mr. Fred. T. Elworthy,\nin which there is an interesting article on the word Dowse, that\nthis is a real dialect pronunciation in some parts of the county.\nDe Quincey's suggestion that the slang word chouse, to swindle, may\nbe derived from the \" jowser,\" regarded as a charlatan, is absurd and\nbaseless (see chouse in Oxford English Dictionary) ; but it may be\ni An incidental evidence of the marvellous range of Dr. Murray's Dictionary is\nshown by the fact that this word \"dizzue\" and Pryce's references thereto are all\nquoted in this Dictionary, as I see from the proof sheets Dr. Murray sent me when\nI ventured to suggest this origin of the word \"dowse.\"\ns\n\f258 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nresponsible for the fact that (as I am informed) in the Geological\nSurvey of Great Britain, the dowsing rod is called the chousing-iork,\nwhich has certainly no local support in any dialect.\nTwo conjectures as to the possible etymology of the term dowsing\nrod occurred to me, but I fear they must be dismissed, as the dis\ntinguished philologists to whom I ventured to submit these conjectures\nregard them as valueless.i It may, however, be useful briefly to refer\nto them here, as collateral questions of interest are opened up.\nIt is well known that the English language was not spoken in\nCornwall till the middle of the 16th century. At the close of that\ncentury, when the virgula divina was introduced by the German\nminers into Cornwall, the Celtic Cornish language was still widely\nused. The Cornish miners might therefore naturally call the rod by\nthe nearest Cornish equivalent to the Latin name. In Williams'\nLexicon Cornua-Britannicum, a dictionary of the ancient Celtic\nlanguage of Cornwall, as Mr. E. Westlake first pointed out to me, the\nCornish word for \" Divinity, Godhead,\" is \" Bowses,\" and Williams\ngives also another form, \" Dewsys. \" Pryce in his glossary of Cornish\nwords gives \" Deuyse \" for goddess. One might conjecture, therefore,\nthat the \" divining rod \" or, as some early writers called it, the\n\" divine rod,\" might to the Cornish miners become the \" dowses-rod \"\nor \" deuyses-rod,\" which would accord with Locke's \" deusing-rod \"\nin 1691.2\ni I have specially to thank Dr. Murray, who, though overwhelmed with his\nmagnum opus, kindly took immense trouble in explaining to me the reasons for his\nopinion, which, of course, I do not venture to question.\n2 1 had remarked in writing to Dr. Murray that though \" dowses \" is \" divinity,\"\nand not \" divining,\" yet the Latin divinitas has the double meaning of \"divinity\" and\n\" divining.\" In his reply Dr. Murray writes fully on this point, and coming from so\nhigh a philological authority, the following extract from Dr. Murray's letter is of\ninterest:\u2014\nOxford, November 2\\st, 1896.\n\" Certainly, in Latin, divinitas has the twofold meaning ; that is the initial fact\non which we have been going all along, and upon which, as I understood it, your\nconjectuie as to dowse started. For it is only because of this Latin fact that there is,\nin any language destended from or borrowing from Latin, any connexion of notion\nbetween god, godhead, and soothsaying. And it is precisely because it is a Latin fact,\nand so far as I know, a Latin fact only, that I, as a philologist, consider it irrelevant.\n\"In Latin, divinus meant not only ' of or pertaining to the divus or deity,' but\nalso ' inspired by the deity, ' hence ' prophetic,' ' soothsaying.' Consequently divinitas\nmeant not only divineness. divine nature, but also divine inspired-ness, prophetic\ncharacter; and divinarc to act the prophet, to 'divine.' Divinare became in\nFrench deviner, and the French word became in English to divine ; hence English\ninherits through French, from Latin, an etymologicalconnexion between the notions of\n' divine, godlike ' and the verb to ' divine, to guess supernaturally,' with its noun of\naction divination. To us, it is only an etymological connexion, for I think no\n\fXXXII.] 259\nAppendix A.\nProfessor Rhys, the Professor of Celtic in Oxford University, to\nwhom this conjecture was submitted, advised that Dr. Jago (one, I\nbelieve, of the best living authorities on the Celtic Cornish language),\nshould be consulted, though the term \" dowsing rod \" is not, Professor\nRhys adds, in Dr. Jago's English Cornish Dictionary.\nAccordingly I wrote to Dr. Jago and have received in reply a\nseries of lengthy and interesting letters, of which I regret that space\nonly allows me to give a few extracts. In his second letter to me Dr.\nJago writes :\u2014\n13, Ham Street, Plymouth, November 26^1, 1896.\nI cannot but think that the rod was looked on as a sacred instrument,\nhence \"virgula divinatoria \" for its name, and so would the Cornish in\ntheir tongue apply a term as meaning what is sacred or God-like. . . .\nIn Cornish we have for God these forms :\u2014Dero, Dew, . . . etc , etc.,\nthe plurals ending in various ways, as in ow, ou, etc., etc. Williams (Lex.\nCorn. Brit.) has for \"Divinity (Godhead)\" Dnsds, Dewsys, Demys, terms\nnearest to Dowser, and Dowsing. . . . My own opinion is that dowsing\nis in its origin from the Latin Deits, through the Cornish forms dnses, deusys,\ndewsys.\nDecember 5th, 1896.\nFor Goddess we have in Cornish, Dues (Lex. Com. Brit.) Deuyse (Pryce),\nDuwies (Welsh), Douees (Armoric). Borlase gives as Cornish \"rhodl, a\nbranch.\" All trees and plants are in the feminine gender in Cornish.\nIn a letter dated December 7th Dr. Jago sends me a long and\ncarefully compiled list of changes in words and names of places\nbrought about by the mingling of the ancient Cornish with English.i\nWriting again on December 14th, Dr. Jago says :\u2014\nDecember Uth, 1896.\nI sent you the list of compound words to show how dewsys and\nrhodl, the ancient Cornish for goddess and rod may easily be changed\none feels any connexion of idea between ' divining what a person would be at,\nand the 'divine nature,' any more than he feels between seating a letter, and\nseal fishery.\n\"But the fact is only a Latin one; there is nothing analogous in Greek, in\nGermanic, or in Celtic ; in none of these languages has the word for ' god ' happened\nto give birth to a derivative meaning ' soothsay ' ; they might, perchance, have done\nso as wellas Latin, but theydid net. Now ' the illegitimate process 'of your reasoning a\nthat you take a fact which is true of Latin only, and apply it without proof to a\nCeltic language. . . . But this is the very thing to be proved ; and investigation\nshows that there is no evidence for it, that all the words connected with divination in\nthe Celtic language are quite different and have no connexion with the word for od\nor divine. Thus to the philologist, the conjecture is one that lies outside the lines of\nscientific notice, and is for him no solution. \" J A. H Murray \"\ni See Appendix in Jago's English-Cornish Dictionary, \" English changes of\nCeltic-Cornish words,\" containing a long list of curious changes of Cornish into\nEnglish, e.g., MSn Eglos, the Chapel Rock, changed to \"The Manacles:\" rocka\nnear Falmouth.\ns 2\n\f2G0 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nby passing from the Cornish to the English, and for want of a better\nterm, I call such changes \"phonetic.\" The terms used by the Cornish\nminers are mostly of great antiquity, and so far as I know, the dowsing\nrod was in use in Cornwall long before the Cornish language became\nextinct. This being so, the Cornish miners must naturally have had a\nCornish name for the rod.\nIt was not till towards the end of the reign of Henry VIII. (1509 to\n1547), that English was used in any of the Cornish churches. Before this\ntime Cornish only was known or spoken. . . . But the Cornish\nwas so well spoken in the parish of Feok (near Falmouth), in 1640,\n\" that the Rev. William Jackman, chaplain and vicar of Pendennis\nCastle, Falmouth,\" at the siege thereof by the parliament's army,\nwas forced for divers years to administer the sacrament in the Cornish\ntongue ; but, says Drew, \" So late as 1650 the Cornish language was spoken\nin the parishes of Paul and St. Just (near Penzance), the fish-women and\nmarket-women in the former and the miners in the latter for the most part\nconversing in their old vernacular tongue.\" . . . Old Dolly Pentreath\nwho died, aged 102, at Mousehole, near Penzance, in January, 1778, was\nthe last known person whoso mother tongite was Cornish ; she could not\nspeak English till she was a grown woman.\nI am of opinion that the modern dowsing rod was with the Cornish\nminers, before the old Celtic tongue died out, known as the Dewsys Rhodl,\nand corrupted by English-speaking people into dowsing (or density)) rod, and\nthat it is a sacred term in origin. Fred W p Ja00\nOn the other hand, no evidence is forthcoming in support of this\nconjecture, and the highest philological authorities, such as Dr. Murray,\nof Oxford, and Professor Skeat, of Cambridge, to both of whom I sub\nmitted Dr. Jago's letters, are entirely opposed to the foregoing\nconjecture, and state that it is \" not even a possible suggestion of the\netymology of the word dowsing rod.\" i\nThe other conjecture, suggested by a historical investigation of the\nrod, seems more plausible, but to it there are also philological objections.\nIn the earliest references to the use of the dowsing rod, it is called\n(written in Latin or German) \"the striking rod,\" and it is always\nspoken of as \"striking\" when it comes over a hidden vein of ore. Thus\nBasil Valentine, in his Novum Teslamentum (date uncertain, assigned\nto 1440, probably later), speaks of the dowsing rod as the \" Furcilia,\ni I sent the proof-sheets of this note to Dr. Jago, who writes, \" With the highest\nrespect for the authorities you have referred to, I am still of opinion that dowzin.rtni\nis only a corrupted form of Dcwsyt rhodl, the rod of the goddess ; this is not more\nstrained than the Cornish pcn-y-lxd. head of the mine, into the corrupted form ' penny\nball ' or men eylos, church rock, into manacles.' \"\n\fXXXII.] 261\nAppendix A.\noder von der Schlag-ruthen \" ; in the English translation (1657) of this\nalchemist's work this is given as the \" Furcilla, or striking rod,\" and\nwe are told \" if it strikes,\" the ore is beneath. The phrase Die\nWiinschel-rulhe schklgt (the divining rod strikes) occurs continually in\nworks of the 17th century. Beyer, in his work on mining (1749),\ndiscusses why the rod strikes (schlagt) with some persons and not\nwith others. Formerly the motion of the rod was always downwards ;\nit turned until it struck, or nearly struck, the ground ; and it is still\ncalled in parts of Cornwall \" the dipping rod.\" Now, one meaning of\nthe word dowse, or douse, is to strike, and another, to dip ; thus\nProfessor Skeat, in his Etymological Dictionary, under \" Dowse,\"\ngives \"middle English (13th to loth centuries), duschen, to strike ;\nCf. 0. Dutch, doesen, to strike.\" It seemed possible, therefore\u2014\nto one who is not an etymologist\u2014that the \" deusing rod\" of Locke,\nand the \" dowsing rod \" of to-day, might simply be the \" striking \" or\n\" dipping rod.\" i On the other hand, Dr. Murray says the two words\nare no more related than to \" seal \" a letter is to \" seal \" fishery.\nProfessor Skeat writes, \" That dowse means to strike, especially in the\nface, is well authenticated, so that the etymology suggested is not\nphonetically impossible, and this is something.\" But in a subsequent\nletter Professor Skeat says, \" I did not know the dowse you refer to\nis pronounced dowz ; it makes a great difference, and to my mind\ncompletely severs it fiom the verb douse, to strike, which rhymes\nwith house. To douse means to slap, rather than merely to strike.\"\nHere I leave the question still in obscurity ; if, as Professor\nSkeat remarks, \" people will have etymologies, ' Recte si possint ;\nsi non, quocunque modo,' \" then the perusal of this Appendix may be\ninstructive.2\ni Dr. Jago, though opposed to this derivation, tells me that in Cornwall dome\nmeans to dip or lower suddenly or forcibly ; this is precisely what occurs with the\ndowsing rod when it \"strikes\" the vein or spring. The Rev. W. Jago, of Bodmin,\nindependently suggests the same etymology as his namesake. It will be interesting\nto see what the Oxford English Dictionary has to say on the word \" strike,\" and the\nhistory of its many meanings.\n2 It is a curious coincidence that one George Dowtiny, a schoolmaster of St.\nFaith's, near Norwich, used \" magic \" to find treasure in the early part of the reign\nof Henry VIII. , (1521). A license had been given to Sir R. Curzon to search for\nhidden treasure in Norfolk, and the aid of George Dowsing was sought, he being\nconsidered an expert \"hill-digger,\" as those were called who searched for minerals\nand buried treasure, an uncanny occupation in those days. See Dr. Jessopp's Random\nRoamings, p. 103. Oddly enough, one of the very earliest uses of the divining rod\nwas in the search for hidden treasure. This superstition became the subject of one of\nSheppard's Epigrams on the Virynla hivina, published in London in 1651, p. 141 :\n\"Some sorcerers do boast they have a rod, Gathered with vows and sacrifice,\nAnd (borne about) will strangely nod, To hidden treasure, where it lies.\nMankind is (sure) that rod divine, For to the wealthiest (ever) they incline.\"\n\f262 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nAPPENDIX B.\nGeological Opinion upon Underground Water.\nThe available sources of underground water depend mainly on the\nrainfall.i The rain water which sinks into the earth, or the water\nwhich has leaked from the bed of a river or lake, passes through more\nor less porous strata, which it gradually saturates, until it meets with a\nmore impermeable layer ; here it accumulates underground, \"until by the\npressure of the descending column, it is forced to find a passage through\njoints or fissures upwards to the surface. The points at which it issues\nare termed springs. In most districts the rocks underneath are\npermeated with water below a certain limit which is termed the [under\nground] water level. This line is not a strictly horizontal one, like that\nof the surface of a lake. Moreover, it is likely to rise and fall accord\ning as the seasons are wet or dry. In some places it lies quite near, in\nothers far below, the surface. A well is an artificial hole dug down\nbelow the water-level, into which the water percolates. Hence, when\nthe water-level happens to be at a small depth the wells are shallow ;\nwhen at a great depth they require to be deep. Since the rocks\nunderneath the surface vary greatly in porosity, some contain far more\nwater than others. It often happens that, percolating along some\nporous bed, the subterranean water finds its way downward until it\npasses beneath some more impervious rock. Hindered in its progress,\nit accumulates in the porous bed. . . . If a bore hole be sunk\nthrough the impervious bed down to the water-charged stratum\nbelow, the water will rise in the hole, or even gush out as a jut\nd'eau above ground. Wells of this kind bear the name of Artesian,\nfrom the old province of Artois in France, where they have long\nbeen in use.\" 2\ni Mainly, because from the bed of the ocean, water is continually filtering down\nwards. Moreover, Mr. I. Roberts, F.R.S. , has shown in an admirable series of\nexperiments {Proc Brit Association, 1878, p. 397), that sea water filtering through\nthe Bunter sandstone is, by a purely mechanical and physical process, deprived of the\nsalts it contains, and issues as potable water ; this action continues until the sandstone\nis saturated with salme particles, which can be washed out by fresh water. As a\nmatter of fact, this filtration from the salt water of the Mersey is the source of fresh\nwater in numerous wells in Liverpool, which \"yield daily several million gallons of\nwater, the yield having been continuous for years.\" Of late, however, the water in\nmany of these wells had mysteriously become moreand more brackish, and in some was\nas salt as its source. Mr. Roberts' experiments have now cleared up this mystery ;\nthe sandstone is becoming saturated with salt.\n> Sir A. Geikie, F.R.S. \"Geology,\" in Encye. Brit., 9th Ed., p. 269.\n\fXXXIl]. 263\nAppendix B.\nA spring, therefore, depends for its supply upon the extent of the\nunderground reservoir furnished by the permeable stratum. Owing\nto their permeability, \" the old red sandstone, the triassic sandstones,\nsome beds of millstone grit, the jurassic limestones, the lower green-\nsand and chalk formations constitute the more important water-bearing\nformations of the British Isles.\" i Rocks absorb varying quantities of\nwater, from the oolite, which reaches up to an absorbing power of 2-2\ngallons per cubic foot, down to the carboniferous limestone ; one gallon\nof water absorbed per cubic foot corresponds to over 80 million gallons\nper square mile of rock for every yard of its thickness.2\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that there is a circulation of\nunderground water, the direction of its flow depending on the dip of\nthe impermeable strata, or on the direction of the faults and fissures of\nthe rocks, which act as ducts for the underground water. Thus Dr.\nAnsted in his Physical Geography writes :\u2014\" It is certain that water\nmust be constantly circulating through natural fissures in the earth at\nall depths.\" As Sir A. Geikie points out :\u2014\" That the water really\ncirculates underground and passes not merely between the pores of the\nrocks, but in crevices and tunnels, which it has, no doubt, to a large\nextent opened for itself along numerous natural joints and fissures, is\nproved by the occasional rise of twigs, leaves, and even live fish in the\nshaft of an artesian well. Such evidences are particularly striking\nwhen found in districts without surface waters, and even, perhaps,\nwith little or no rain. ... In these and similar cases it is clear\nthe water may, and sometimes does, travel for many leagues under\nground away from the district where it fell.\" 3\nIn certain districts, moreover, actual subterranean rivers exist.\nThus in the limestone district of the West of Ireland, Professor\nHull remarks :\u2014\" The limestone itself is often penetrated by under\nground rivers, which create hollows arched over by the rocks, but\nwhen these give way a chasm is created, and the commencement of a\nlake may be the result.\" 4 But prior to this, Mr. G. H. Kinahan,\nM.R.I.A., in his excellent Manual of the Geology of Ireland, published\nin 1878, devotes a section of his book to subterranean streams and\nrivers, and gives the various localities where they are to be found in\nIreland. In most cases Mr. Kinahan believes the origin of these\nrivers to be due to \"dykes of incoherent fault rock, through which\nthe water flows as through shingle ; \" in other cases they are passages\n\" dissolved out along the joints in the peculiar limestones of the\ni Dr. Hull, F.R.S.

Barrett.\ndistrict.\" Similar phenomena exist in Fermanagh and in the lime\nstone districts of Derbyshire and Yorkshire, the underground river\nchannels being dissolved out by water beneath the surface.\nThe \" diviner \" has, therefore, some reason for speaking of under\nground rivers ; but the place in which he locates them is often where\ngeologists assert they do not exist, and there is no geological evidence\nto show that there is anything in nature analogous to his peculiar\nnotions of the distribution of water underground. Albeit, in justice\nto the dowser, the following remarks of a distinguished geologist, the late\nProfessor Ansted may be quoted (it occurs in his Geological Gossip,\np. 17); speaking of underground water, he remarks:\u2014\"It will exist\nsometimes in open cavities, and sometimes under great pressure in\ncrevices to which the day never penetrates, and of whose position no\none can guess who is not endowed with the peculiar second-sight of tjie\ndowser.\" (The italics are mine.)\nThis brief notice of geological views on underground water would\nbe incomplete without special reference to De Ranee's comprehensive\nwork on the Water Supply oj England and Wales, published in 1882.\nIt embodies the author's experience as one of the staffof the Geological\nSurvey of Great Britain, and also as secretary of the B.A. Committee\non underground water. The mass of statistics which Mr. De Ranee\nhas collected are arranged on a geological basis; some 215 catchment\nbasins are given, and 985 urban sanitary districts are dealt with.i\nThe neighbourhood of London has obtained most attention from\nthe hydro-geologist,\u2014the name now applied to experts in this special\nbranch of applied science. The principal works on this are Prestwich's\nWater-bearing Strata around Loudon, 1851, and Lucas' Horizontal\nWells for Supplying London, 1874 ; important papers on \"Water\nSystems,\" by the latter author, will be found in the Proceedings of the\nInstitute of Civil Engineers, and also of the Institute of Surveyors,\nfrom 1877 to 1880. The ordinary reader will find in the second\nchapter of Huxley's Physiography an admirable account of the origin\nof springs, with especial reference to the London basin.2\ni As Mr. De Ranee has pointed out, the sea bottom near coasts can also yield fresh\nwater,\u2014for the sea bottom, like the land, consists of permeable and impermeable\nstrata ; the former receive the water from the land, which travels down the line of\ndip, and issues as fresh water springs beneath the floor of the sea,\u2014when intercepted\nby faults or penetrated by well-borings. An instance of the latter is seen at Spithead\nForts, where a well sunk beneath the sea bed supplies sufficient fresh water for the\nlarge garrison stationed there.\n2 Those interested in the subject of underground water should consult Daubree's\nLts Eaux Soutcrrainca, or any standard work on geology or physiography. Much\ninformation will also be found in the series of reports presented to the British\nAssociation by the Committee on Underground Waters from 1875 to 1894. For the\n\fXXXII.] 265\nAppendix B.\nIn connexion with the subject of underground water, I wish in con\nclusion to draw special attention to the remarkable treatise by M. l'Abb\u00e9\nParamelle, called \" L'art de de'couvrir les sources.\" This bulky volume\nwas first published in Paris in the year 1827, several editions have been\nissued, the last appearing in 1896. Paramelle, so far as I know, was\nthe first hydro-geologist, and the first, I believe, to use that term. His\nbook is the result of a careful study of the geological conditions which\ndetermine the presence or absence of water-bearing strata, more\nespecially of the district in which he lived,\u2014 the Department of Lot,\nin the south-west of France. So successful was Paramelle in his\nprognostications that he was appointed the official \" Hydroscopist \" to\nthe Department. Towards the close of his book a series of documents\nare quoted from the Prefecture of the Department, these being\nthe official records of his work in that immediate neighbourhood.\nThe last document, dated February 1st, 1843, certifies that out\nof 338 wells sunk at places indicated by Paramelle, 305 continued to\nyield an abundant and excellent supply of water, which in all cases\nwas found at the depth which the Abbe\" had predicted. M. le prefet\ndu Lot, writing to the prefect of Versailles, remarks :\u2014\nAujourd'hui I'experience a confirm\u00e9 la reality du pouvoir de M. 1'AbW\nParamelle pour d\u00e9couvrir les sources : les faits sont tellement nombreux,\ntellement accumul\u00e9s que le doute n'est plus permis. On evalue a pres de\nsix mille le nombre des sources d\u00e9couvertes par ce savant hydroscope dans\nplus de trente departements. . . . On ne peut porter a moins de quatre\nou cinq millions [francs] la valeur des sources deja mises au jour d'apres les\navis de M. l'Abb(5 Paramelle.i\nThough Paramelle professed to be guided solely by scientific reasoning\nin his discovery of underground water, yet his manner in locating the site\nfor a well was more like intuition than scientific deduction, and strongly\nreminds one of the ordinary dowser. It is possible that if the faculty\nclaimed by the latter really exists, Paramelle may unconsciously have\npossessed it. Be that as it may, his book, from the early date at which\nit appeared, seems to deserve a wider recognition in England than it\nhas received.\nnon-scientific reader I have met with nothing so admirable on this subject as a little\nbook by Professor Ansted, M.A., F.R.S., called Lectures on the Application of\nGcology to the Art) and Manufactures : the second lecture is devoted to an exposition\nof Springs and Water Supply. Prof. Ansted also published a paper on Subterranean\nWater Storage in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society for 1806. A\nchronological list of works referring to underground water (England and Wales) is\ngiven by Mr. W. Whitaker in the Proceedings of the British Association for 1895 and\n1897 ; m all, 695 works are cited, ranging from the years 1656 to 1895.\ni Quoted in an article on Paramelle, published in the Journal d'Agriculture\npratique, Avril, 1845, p. 459.\n\f266 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nAPPENDIX C.\nHow the Rod is Held.\nA writer in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1751, p. 507, gives a\ndescription of the method he had found best for holding the rod, and\nsays, \" after numerous experiments he has good reason to believe the\neffects of the divining rod to be more than imagination,\" remarking that\nhe believes all persons could use the rod, though \" some have the virtue\nintermittently.\"i He uses either a forked hazel twig or two straight\ntwigs tied together in the shape of an X, and continues :\u2014\n\"The most convenient and handy method of holding the rod is with the\npalms of the hands turned upwards, and the two ends of the rod coming\noutwards ; the palms should be held horizontally as nearly as possible, the\npart of the rod in the hand ought to be straight, and not bent backwards or\nforward. The upper part of the arm should be kept pretty close to the\nsides, and the elbows resting on them ; the lower part of the arm making\nnearly a right angle with the upper, though rather a little more acute. The\nrod ought to be so held, that in its working the sides may move clear of the\nlittle fingers. The position of the rod when properly held is much like the\nfigure annexed (Fig. 1.) where the distance between the four downward\nlines is the part that is supposed to be held in the hands.\nFig. 1.\nThe best manner of carrying the rod is with the end prolaided (sic) in an\nangle of about 80 degrees from the horizon, as by this method of carrying it\ni The writer in the Gentleman's Magazine does not give his name ; the Editor calls\nhim an \" ingenious gentleman, who has revived with great success the use of the rod.\"\nThere can be little doubt, however, from internal evidenoe, that the writer was\nWilliam Cookworthy, of Plymouth, who, in the obituary notice published of him in\n1780, is described \" as an eminent Minister of the people called Quakers, and one of\nthe greatest chemists this nation has ever produced.\" This latter statement is of\ncourse merely local colour ; Cookworthy was, however, a notable, learned and high-\nminded man ; to him is due the discovery of the existence of china-clay in Cornwall, a\ndiscovery which has so largely enriched that part of England.\n\fXXXII.] 267\nAppendix C.\nthe repulsion is more plainly perceived than if it was held perpendicularly.\nBut after all the directions that can be given, the adroit use of it can only be\nattained by practice and attention. It is necessary that the grasp should be\nsteady, for if, when the rod is going, there be the least succussion or\ncounteraction in the hands, though ever so small, it will greatly impair\nand generally totally prevent its activity, which is not to be done by\nthe mere strength of the grasp, for, provided this be steady, no strength\ncan stop it.\nIt is interesting to note that the foregoing description of the way\nof holding the rod closely resembles that given by Agricola, in his\nfamous folio, Be Re Metallica, published in Basle in 1546. Agricola's\nwork is the earliest detailed account we have of the use of the\nVirgula divina, and refers, of course, only to its use in finding mineral\nlodes. In like manner the learned Jesuit Dechales, in his great work\nMundus Mathematicus, Lugduni, 1674, Vol. II., p. 190, gives a\nsimilar description of the way the rod is held. The following is a\ntranslation of the passage, which is of great interest, as it is the\nearliest reference I can find to the successful use of the rod in finding\nunderground water (the italics are mine) :\u2014\nThey hold it [a forked branch of hazel] with both fists, in such a way\nthat the outer part of the fists turns downwards, i.e., the two little fingers\nface each other. Thus each branch being grasped firmly in each fist, they\nwalk to and fro. . . . When they come perpendicularly over under\nground water, the branch, however strongly it is held, turns upside down ;\nthat is, the vertex points downwards, so that the forked sides are twisted;\nbut it does not succeed with all persons. . . . Once on a certain\noccasion I purposely hid some money in the earth, which was found by a\ncertain noble person by the hazel twig in my presence. The same person\nused to find springs so surely that he would trace the whole course of\nunderground water.\nOne of the earliest English references to the use of the rod for\nfinding underground water, is contained in the article before quoted from\nthe Gentleman'8 Magazine oi 1751 : the writer says, \"The hazel, willow,\nand elm are all attracted by springs of water ; some persons have the\nvirtue intermittently, (5ic.\"\nA detailed account of the manner of holding the divining rod is also\ngiven by Pryce in his Mineralogia Cornubiensis, p. 118. The date\nof this folio is 1778. Pryce, or rather, again, Cookworthy, who, we are\ntold, wrote this part of the work, says :\u2014\n\" It is very difficult to describe the manner of holding and using the rod :\nit ought to be held in the hands, in the position shown, the smaller\nends lying flat or parallel to the horizon, and the upper part in an elevation\nnot perpendicular to it, but 70 degrees, as shown (Fig. 2).\n\f268 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\n\" Alonzo Barba directs the rod to be fixed across the head of a walking\nstick in the form of a T, and the end which is nearest the root will dip or\nincline to the mineral ore. i\nFiq. 2.\n\"The rod should be firmly and steadily grasped ; for if, when it hath\nbegun to be attracted, there be the least imaginable jerk, or opposition to its\nattraction, it will not move any more, till the hands are opened and a fresh\ngrasp taken. The stronger the grasp the livelier the rod moves, provided\nthe grasp be steady, and of an equal strength.\n\" A little practice by a person in earnest about it will soon give him the\nnecessary adroitness in the use of this instrument : but it must be particularly\nobserved that, as our animal spirits are necessary to this process, so a man\nought to hold the rod with the same indifference and inattention to, or\nreasoning about it or its effects, as he holds a fishing rod or a walking stick ;\nfor if the mind be occupied by doubts, reasoning, or any other operation that\nengages the animal spirits, it will divert their powers from being exerted in\nthis process, in which their instrumentality is absolutely necessary ; from\nhence it is that the rod constantly answers in the hands of peasants,\nwomen, and children, who hold it simply without puzzling their minds with\ndoubts or reasonings. Whatever may be thought of this observation, it is a\nvery just one, and of great consequence in the practice of the rod.\nThe remark in the last paragraph is interesting, and Cookworthy's\nobservation is confirmed by the quite independent testimony of\nothers. Thus the German writer, Beyer, makes a similar observation on\nthe divining rod in Chapter 12 of his folio on Mining, published in\n1749. If the dowsing faculty be some intuitive sub-conscious sense\ni I can find no mention of this in Alonzo Barba's interesting old Spanish work\non mining called Arte de los Metales, Madrid, 1639. I am greatly indebted to the\never ready and kind help of my friend and colleague, Professor J. P. O'Reilly,\nForeign Secretary of the Royal Irish Academy, for examining on my behalf this and\nother Spanish works to which I have had occasion to refer in the preparation of this\nmonograph. There is a reference to a T shaped extemporised rod in a book by\nGabriel Plattes, called The Discovery of Subterranean Treasure, viz., of All Manner of\nMines and Minerals, London, 1638. This is the earliest English reference to the use\nof the divining rod for finding mineral veins which I have been able to find.\u2014W.F.B.\n\fXXXII.] 269\nAppendix G.\nperception, possessed by certain individuals, of which the rod is the\noutward and visible sign, we should expect to find \" doubts or reasonings \"\nfatal to the successful use of the rod, as they would be in the case of\nany other autoscope.\nCookworthy then goes on to describe how the motion of the rod\nmay be stopped by various objects held in the hand or put under the\narm. In other writings of his, he tells us that \" a piece of the same\nmatter with the attracting body, held in the hand, or applied to any\npart of the rod, prevents its attraction. Its attraction to springs of\nwater is prevented by spitting on the hands or moistening them with\nwater.\" Thus, he explains, the diviner can discover whether it be'\nmetal or water, or what kind of metal is indicated.i This is another of\nthe numerous illustrations with which the history of the divining rod\nabounds, of the effect of suggestion on the motion, or arrest of motion,\nof the rod. For in 1663, exactly the opposite effect is assigned by no\nless an authority than Robert Boyle, who in his Philosophical Essays\nstates that he has been informed \" the wand will bow more strongly \"\nwhen a piece of the similar metal to that underground is held in the\nhand.2 See also the letter quoted in the foot-note to p. 247.\nI have already referred (p. 18) to the excellent picture by\nA. Crowquill, of a dowser at work, given in Mr. Phippen's brochure on\nthe rod, published in 1853. Here also the arms are held tightly to\nthe sides of the body, but the prongs of the fork pass between the\nindex and next finger of each hand.3 Miss Cox in her paper on the\nrod, shows Stokes, the dowser, holding the rod pointing downwards\nwith the prongs grasped by the fists. (See Fig. 3).\ni So also the writer of La Verge de Jacob, a little work on th\u00ab rod, published at\nLyons in 1693, states that a wet rag will stop the rod when it turns for underground\nwater, but not when it is turning for metallic ore ; similar assertions are made to-day\nby Tompkins and other dowsers, see pp. 165, 212, etc., so this belief is wide-spread\nand long lived !\n2 Vol. I., p. 172, in the complete edition of Boyle's Philosophical Workt: the\nwhole passage will be given in the historical part of my paper.\n3 I had intended quoting the careful description Mr. Phippen gives of the way\nthe rod is held, but it is hardly necessary, as it closely resembles that already given.\nFig. 3.\n\f270 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part\nThe late J. Mullins, however, whose success as a dowser was the\nmost remarkable in modern times, always held the rod as shown in\nFig. 4.\nFig. 4.\nThis is much the same way as Tompkins is shown holding the rod\non pp. 147 and 159 ; this might indeed be expected, from the narrative\ngiven on p. 145. On the other hand, W. Stone, who is also a\nsuccessful dowser, is seen on p. 134 to be holding the rod in quite\nanother manner. Again, in the American Journal of Science\n(Silliman's Journal) for 1826, p. 201, in the course of a lengthy article\non the rod, a picture is given showing how the rod must be held, and\nhere the prongs of the fork pass between the thumb and forefinger of\neach hand. Messrs. Young and Robertson, in their little book on\nthe divining rod, mentioned on p. 18, give illustrations showing their\nway of holding the rod : they have sent me a little waistcoat-pocket\nforked rod made of aluminium, which they recommend to be held in the\nway shown in Fig. 5. They also use a straight rod or wand some three or\nFig. 5.\nfour feet long, which they hold inclined in the right hand, the thinner\nend being held in the hand and \" the eye resting on the top of the\nthick end.\" This, they assert, dips down over an underground spring.\nThis \"dipping rod \" is a return to an old form of divining rod, a picture\nof which is given in an Italian work on the rod, published in 1678, and\n\fXXXII.] 271\nAppendix C.\nwill be reproduced in the subsequent historical part of this paper.\nThe Abb\u00e9 de Vallemont gives pictures of straight rods in his La\nPhysique Occulte, published in 1693; and Bleton, as already mentioned\n(p. 21), in the last century used a nearly straight rod placed horizontally\non the index fingers of the two hands. This slightly-curved rod\nrevolved from 30 to 80 times a minute when Bleton came over under\nground water. Here (Fig. 6.) are some other ways of holding the rod\nin use in the 17th century.i\nFig. 6.\nIt will thus be evident that the manner of holding the rod varies\nwith the individual dowser, and obviously cannot be of much\nconsequence. Some positions in which the rod is held doubtless\nrender it a more sensitive indicator to the muscular tremor which\ndetermines its motion. It may be held in a position of tension or\npoised equilibrium (as mentioned on p. 11), and it then becomes a very\nsensitive autoscope ; in this position it is desirable some experiments on\nthought-transference should he made with the holder of the rod.\ni 1 am indebted to the editor of Pearson's Magazine for this woodcut. Though not\nstated the pictureia a copy of one of the plates in Lebrun's Lcttres . . sur labaguette,\n1693. Aymar sometimes used a straight rod held in one hand.\n\f272 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nAPPENDIX D.\nThe Sensations Alleged to Occur in Dowsing.\nThe assertion is made by numerous dowsers that when they are\nover underground water they experience a peculiar sensation,\u2014which\nsome describe as felt in the limbs, like the tingling produced by a mild\nelectric shock, others as a shivering or trembling, and others as an\nunpleasant sensation in the epigastric region, etc. It is unnecessary to\nquote the various statements made by different dowsers, quite\nindependently of each other ; they will be found on pages 22, 48, 69, 95,\n124, 161, 164, 177, 196, 200, 206. But these sensations seem to be\nonly experienced when they are dowsing ; when off duty, underground\nwater seems to have no effect. This fact, coupled with the apparent\nabsence of any feeling produced by the much greater masses of visible\nwater in lakes, rivers, or the sea, indicate the purely psychological\norigin of the asserted sensations. The interesting point is, however,\nthat this psycho-physiological disturbance in the use of the divining rod\ncan be traced back at least two centuries, and exists among diviners\nin different countries.i\nAmong the most remarkable symptoms were those exhibited by the\nFrench dowser, Bleton, in the last century. A careful medical examina\ntion of Bleton was made by Dr. Thouvenel, who was a distinguished\nFrench physician, and in his Mhnoire Physique el Medicinal, Paris,\n1781, page 53, he describes these symptoms as follows:\u2014\nLa premiere impression que fait \u00e9prouver au corps de Bleton la presence\nde l'eau aouterraine, se porte sur le diaphragme, en s'\u00e9tendant vers ses\nappendices supeVieurs ou ses attaches avec le sternum, et produisant un\nserrement avec de l'oppression, dont le siege parolt born\u00e9 k la partie\nanterieure et superieure de la poitrine. Un saisissement, un tremblement\net un refroidissement gen\u00e9ral s'emparent en meme-tems de lui. Ses jambes\nchancellent. Los tendons des poignets se roidissent et entrent en convulsion.\nLe pouls se concentre et diminue peu-a-peu. En un mot, cet etat represent*\net caracteVise 1' invasion d' une veritable attaque de spasme convulsif. II\nsubsiste, avec des nuances cependant et des variations du plus au moins,\ntant que cet homme reste sur la source, et disparoit presque subitoment\ni That nervous excitement is partly at the root of these sensations seems to be\nindicated by the case of Jacques Aymar. In a copy of the Journal des Searana\n(Savants) for January 1093, for the possession of which I am indebted to the zeal of\nMr. Holland's excellent book agency in Paris, it is stated by a contemporary witness,\nDr. Chauvin, that when Aymar, who had gained repute as a spring finder, was taken\nwith his baguette into the cellar where the Lyons murder had been committed, Aymar\n\" n'y fut pas plutot entn'' qu'il se sentit tout eniu, et que son poux s'eleva comme une\ngrosse fievre.\"\n\fXXXII.] 273\nAppendix D.\nlorsqu' il se place \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, si ce n'est, \u00e0 ce qu'il dit, un sentiment int\u00e9rieur de\nfroid et de serrement l\u00e9gers, au devant de la poitrine. Ce sentiment ne cesse\ntotalement qu'\u00e0 une certaine distance de l'eau ; et cette distance exprime\nselon lui la profondeur de cette derni\u00e8re, comme nous le verrons ci-apr\u00e8s.\"\nDr. Thouvenel states Bleton did not feel any effect from stagnant\nwater ; a headache and lassitude were, however, produced by a river,\nwhen in a boat, \" mais point du tout ce qu'il appelle sa commotion\ndans la poitrine, ni le contre-coup de cette commotion dans les\nextr\u00e9mit\u00e9s.\"\nIt is said that when Bleton was a child, the discovery of his \" gift \"\nwas accidentally made from perceiving that a feverish attack seized him\nwhenever he happened to be at a certain spot where a subterranean\nspring was subsequently discovered. In one of the numerous pi\u00e8ces\njustificatives and proc\u00e8s-verbaux attached to Thouvenel's book, the\nfollowing evidence is cited. The writer of the certificate, after stating\nthat numerous persons in Burgundy can testify that Bleton is neither\nan impostor nor a charlatan, goes on to say :\u2014\nC'est un pauvre paysan qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 par charit\u00e9 dans une des Chartreuses\nde Dauphin\u00e9, et voici comment ce talent, si c'en est un, lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 connu.\nA l'\u00e2ge de sept ans, portant le d\u00eener \u00e0 des ouvriers, il s'assit sur une\npierre, o\u00f9 la fi\u00e8vre le prit : les ouvriers l'ayant fait mettre \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'eux, la\nfi\u00e8vre cessa ; il retourne \u00e0 plusieurs reprises sur la pierre, toujours la fi\u00e8vre.\nOn raconta cette histoire au Prieur de la dite Chartreuse, qui voulut par lui-\nm\u00eame en voir l'exp\u00e9rience. Convaincu par le fait, il fit creuser sous la\npierre ; il s'y trouva une source qui, \u00e0 ce que l'on m'a assur\u00e9, fait moudre\naujourd'hui un moulin.i\nSeveral witnesses of high standing are cited by Dr. Thouvenel, who\ntestify to the pathological effect which underground water had upon\nBleton ; the curious point being that Bleton's prognostications were so\nrarely wrong, water being found, according to the evidence, even in the\nmost unpromising places when Bleton was affected in this manner.\nM. le Pr\u00e9sident d' 0 , who made numerous experiments with\nBleton, relates that, a generation before Bleton, in 1735, another\nsourcier, or water finder, had said when there was a difficulty in finding\nhim a proper rod or baguette :\u2014\nN'importe, Monsieur, ce n'est pas la baguette qui me dirige, c'est un\nsentiment que j'\u00e9prouve au dedans de moi-m\u00eame.\nOn p. 263, Dr. Thouvenel gives an account of a visit paid by M.\nC to a Prior at Autun who possessed the \" gift \" of water-finding,\nwhich he had gratuitously exercised for the benefit of his commune.\ni M\u00e9moire physique et m\u00e9dicinal, etc (Paris, 1781), p. 251.\nT\n\f274 - Professor W. F, Barrett. [part\nThe Prior states that he detected an underground spring by a peculiar\nmalaise it produced upon him, which was more marked in following\nthe spring upwards than downwards. He stated a shivering was\nproduced in his shoulders and muscles of the arm and leg, and if he\ncontinued following an underground spring, extreme and abnormal\nfatigue was produced ; the sensation was stronger after fasting than\nafter meals.\nDr. Thouvenel also refers to Parangue, a young girl, born in 1760,\nwho from her infancy appeared to have the faculty of detecting\nunderground water by the terror she displayed when over an under\nground spring. According to the Abbe Sauri, Parangue apparently\nsaw the water below, \"the earth becoming transparent to her vision.\"\nA similar case is related by Dr. Ashburner of a girl who, when\nhypnotised, declared she \" saw \" a spring at a certain depth below a\ncertain spot ; upon digging, a spring was found at the spot and at the\nvery depth stated.i But these cases of clairvoyance obviously need\nconfirmation and critical examination ; the same may be said of the\nfollowing. In an article on Modern Magic by M. Shele de Vere,\npublished in 1873, it is stated that Catherine Beutler, of Thurgovia\nin Switzerland, and Anna Maria Briegger, of the same place, were both\nso seriously affected by the presence of water that they fell into violent\nnervous excitement and became quite exhausted when they happened\nto cross places where water was concealed underground.\nWe have also the evidence of Dr. Mayo, F.R.S., who states in his\nessay on the divining rod 2 that when in Russia he met with a youth\nwho had not handled a divining rod before. Instructing him how to\nhold the rod and to walk over some ground where Dr. Mayo believed\ni The incident as related by Dr. Ashburner is as follows : A respectable girl, a\nlady's maid, was found to pass into a mesmeric sleep on holding for a few seconds a\nhazel twig ; when asleep the twig was so tightly held that in spite of using much\nforce, a bystander could hardly turn it. Her mistress wrote in July, 1845, \" We\nmade a curious experiment with Harriet. We have very bad water here and have\nlong been unable to find a good spring. Mr. G. has dug and dug in vain. I proposed\nthe divining rod ; Harriet was willing, so we went to a field . . . put Harriet\nto sleep, with the hazel stick. She grasped it so tightly we were obliged to use the\ngold chain. She then held it only in one hand and began to walk very carefully for\nabout 20 yards, then suddenly stopped ; not a word was uttered, we all looked on, and\nwere not a little surprised to see the rod slowly turn round until her hand was almost\ntwisted backwards. Suddenly she exclaimed ' There, there, don't you see the stick\nturn? The water is here, under my hand. I see it, I see it.' ' How deep is the\nwater? ' said Mrs. G. ' Oh, about 3 feet.' We marked the place, and after a few\nmoments awoke her. Mr. G. caused a large hole to be dug and just at the depth of\n3 feet the water was found. A brick well has been constructed and we have now\na good supply of excellent water. When awake Harriet knew nothing of the\ncircumstance.\"\u2014Note added by Dr. Ashburner to his translation of Jteichenbach's\nResearches (London, 1851), pages 100-103.\n2 Truths contained in Popular Superstitions, (London, 1S56) p. 18.\n\fXXXII.] 275\nAppendix D.\nunderground water to exist, the forked twig instantly began to ascend.\nDr. Mayo goes on to say that the lad\nLaughed with astonishment at the event, which was totally unexpected\nby him, and he said that he experienced a tickling or thrilling sensation in\nhis hands The experiment was repeated by him in my presence\nwith like success several times during the ensuing month. Then the lad fell\ninto ill health and I rarely saw him. However, one day I begged him to make\nanother trial with the divining fork. He did so, but the instrument moved\nsluggishly and when it moved .... the lad said he felt an uneasy\nsensation, which quickly increased to pain at the pit of the stomach, and he\nbecame alarmed.\nThis, doubtless, was a purely nervous effect, but the coincidence is\ncurious, as Dr. Mayo seems to have been wholly ignorant of\nThouvenel's experiments with Bleton, and of course the Russian lad\nknew nothing about them.\nOn the other hand, the profound effect of 8-uqgestion in producing\nor arresting pathological disturbance comes out very clearly in\nThouvenel's experiments. Believing that the motion of the divining\nrod was due to some unknown electric agency, Thouvenel experimented\nupon Bleton with what he calls \"electric compositions,\" and also\n\" compositions magnetiques recemment Electrifies.\" When Bleton was\nover underground water, if he were touched with one of these com\npositions, the usual symptoms and the rotation of the rod were instantly\ndiminished by three-fourths, and (p. 91)\u2014\nDes l'instant meme que le retirois mes preparations, lcs phenomenes de\nl'eau sur Bleton r\u00e9paroissoient dans toute leur force.\nNow it is absurd to suppose any physical effect could have been\nproduced upon Bleton by these compositions, which were probably bits\nof sulphur or of iron that had been sparked upon by an electric machine ;\nthe result was undoubtedly an effect of sub-conscious and possibly\ntelepathic suggestion. The latter (telepathy) seems indicated also in the\nsubsequent experiments with Bleton to test the effect of insulation, for\nThouvenel appears to have taken the precaution not to let Bleton know\nthe fact nor the object of the experiment.\nComing to the present day, an old amateur dowser, Mr. Robert\nYoung, of Sturminster Newton, Dorset, writes to say that whenever\nhe comes over an underground spring, so violent a trembling seizes\nhim that he has to be supported or he would fall. Mr. Young, I\nam assured, is entirely ignorant of the literature of this subject, so\nthat he has not been affected by what others have said. His daughter\nwrites :\u2014\nOne day I asked father to point out to mo the spring in Gough's close ;\nho walked to and fro, and when he came to a certain spot ho reeled and\nT 2\n\f276 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nstaggered and said the spring was below. To teat the reality of his indica\ntions, I privately marked the spot where he said the spring was. I then\ntook him to the far end of the field and blindfolded him carefully, then led\nhim about the field by a circuitous route. Directly he came on the spot I\nhad marked, he reeled as before and would have fallen if I had not held him\nup. Directly he came off the place he was all right.\nAs perhaps might be expected, the son of Mr. R. Young, Mr. J. F.\nYoung of Llanelly, (also an amateur dowser) feels somewhat similar\nsensations when he is dowsing. I have already referred to Mr. Young\nin the foot-note to p. 19 ; though a hard-working tradesman with little\ntime at his disposal, Mr. Young has devoted his leisure to an\ninvestigation of the rod, and I may add, the extensive correspondence\nMr. Young has had with me has impressed me with his sincere love\nof truth. Mr. Young writes :\u2014\nI have noticed, when divining, unpleasant and peculiar symptoms always\noccur when I am over an underground spring ; often a convulsive feeling\nand staggering comes on. My father, though never otherwise sick, staggers\nand vomits when over a spring. These unpleasant symptoms only occur\nwhen we are \"set\" on divining.\"\nWriting to me again on November 29th, 1896, Mr. J. F. Young\nsays :\u2014\nThe sensation I experience when I get over a spring in divining is very\nlike that experienced at the epigastrium when on the downward stroke of a\nswing, together with a peculiar tingling of the fingers. There is no mistaking\nthis and I have also seen the fingers of Mr. Robertson [a friend of Mr.\nYoung's, also an amateur dowser] severely contracted when he gets over a\nspring.\nMr. Thomas Heighway, the Welsh dowser referred to on p. 206,\nalso sends me an account of the very similar sensations he experiences,\nand so with other dowsers quite independently of each other.\nThese symptoms may only be the result of nervous excitement,\nbut as Bleton a century ago trusted to his \"sensations\" in finding\nwater and as some dowsers still do so to-day, it would seem as if they\nhad some psychical root deeper than mere imagination. In connection\nwith this I will quote the following interesting letter, which has\nrecently appeared in the columns of Truth (July 22nd, 1897) ; the\nwriter is personally known to me, he is an F.R.S., and a dis\ntinguished London physician :\u2014\nAlthough the great majority of people disbelieve in the power of a man\nto detect the presence of water even a few feet under the ground\nupon which he is standing, they readily credit the story of a camel scenting\nwater half a mile off in the middle of a desert. I believe that the almost\nincredible acuteness of sight, scent, and hearing, which are found universally\n\fXXXII.] 277\nAppendix D.\nin certain classes of the lower animals and are not uncommon in savage\nraces, are occasionally possessed by certain individuals amongst civilised\nraces. For instance : the presence of water-vapour in the air over certain\nspots makes itself evident to every one as a visible fog in early morning.\nNow lam acquainted tiritha rheumatic patient who, onpassing over such a spot\nduring the day, when no vapowr is visMe, feels pains in her joints. Of course,\nsuch a condition of hypersesthesia is very rare indeed. I think, however,\nthat the diviner detects water by some sensation which affects either his\nnostrils, or his body generally, when he is standing in a place where there\nis water below the surface. The only use of the divining rod is to magnify\ninvoluntary muscular motions, and thus convert what might otherwise be a\nvague sensation into a definite and perceptible action. But the moving of\nthe rod in a diviner's fingers depends simply upon the bodily condition of the\ndiviner himself, just as the rigidity of a pointer's tail when scenting game\ndepends entirely upon the excitement of the dog.\nThe part I have italicized is interesting in connexion with what\nis stated on p. 249.\nThe comparison of a dowser to a pointer, though inadequate in my\nopinion, is quite as far as the present state of scientific knowledge will\nbe disposed to admit. From this point of view it is a very just\nanalogy ; the wonderful scent of the dog, in its sensitiveness far\nbeyond any instrumental means of detection which science could\nemploy, corresponding to the dowser's \" scent \" for underground\nwater ; the nervous excitement of the dog, corresponding to the\ndowser's psycho-physiological disturbance ; and the index afforded by\nthe rigid tail of the dog when pointing, being the analogue of the\ninvoluntary motion given to the indicating rod of the dowser.i\ni Dr. Carl du Prel, in a brief essay on Die Wunschclruthc, believes the explanation\nof the rod will be found \" in the domain bothjof transcendental physics and trans\ncendental psychology, the rod being the historic fore-runner of the modern practice\nof 'questioning the oracle ' by automatic writing.\" But this was an ancient use of\nthe rod, as will be seen in Zeidler's Pantomysterium (Magdeburg, 1700), where the\nprescience displayed by the rod is attributed to the spirit of nature, the anima mundi,\n\"the Soul needing the rod a# an instrument.\" Of the theories of the rod held in\nsuccessive centuries by the learned world, Zeidler's was one not discordant with\ncertain views of psychical phenomena set forth in our Proceedings.\n\f278 [part\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nAPPENDIX E.\nNote on the Horsham Experiments.\nSince this paper was printed, Mr. E. Westlake, F.G.S., who has\ndevoted attention to hydro-geology, has visited Sir Henry Harben's\nestate, Warnham Lodge, and sent me some geological notes on the\nHorsham Experiments, detailed on pages 117-121. These notes are\ninteresting in connection with Mr. T. V. Holmes' remarks on pages\n227-9, and also as correcting some slight inaccuracies in the state\nment originally given to me. Mr. Westlake went over the ground with\nMr. Ogilvie, the bailiff, and with Mr. Edwards, the head gardener,\n(called the overseer by me on p. 120), who superintended the work of\nthe well-sinking. It seems the rock mentioned on p. 119 was not a\nlimestone, as Sir Henry Harben thought, but a \" white, fine-grained,\nclose-jointed, compact sandstone,\" nor was it so hard as to require\nblasting : a sand pit some 300 feet to the west of the well G shows the\nsame stratum. Some 3 to 4 feet of soil and sand or sandy loam\ncovered the stone, which rests on an impervious \"blue marl\" (the\nWeald clay), the latter being found some 14 feet below the surface\nin the case of well D, which penetrated 5 feet into this marl. Most\nof the water comes from little veins in the sandstone and runs into\nthe wells from the direction of the pond (see map, p. 118) \"as Mullins\nhad said it would.\" Mr. Westlake says, \" The main source of the\nwater thus appears to lie to the east of the wells, though what should\nconfine its flow to certain lines in a tolerably pervious bed is not\neasy to understand, nor yet the large flow from what seems a small\ncollecting ground. It is possible the direction of the flow may be\ndetermined by the patchy character of the bed, which is soft in certain\nplaces, as may be seen in the sand pit, and was said to be also in the\nwells. The depth of the water in the wells varies from 4 feet in\nsummer to 9 or 10 feet in winter. The water is soft and good in all\nrespects ; the analyst who examined it said he had never seen a\nbetter.\"\nAn additional fact was ascertained by Mr. Westlake, which is of\nconsiderable importance in connection with Mr. Holmes' remarks. In\norder to run the water from the wells to the pumping house, which is\non lower ground, (near well A, see p. 118), a trench was sunk to within\na foot of the bottom of the wells E and F, and carried 85 yards to the\nnorth of well E ; 24 yards from E an offset, 8 yards long, connects the\n\fXXXII.] 279\nAppendix E.\n2 inch water pipe, which was laid in the trench, to the well D. Mr.\nWestlake says : \" These trenches, Edwards assured me, were all dry\nto the bottom and no springs were intersected, except the one sup\nplying D; at that time, October, 1893, the water in the wells E and\nF stood more than 6 feet deep, but it was kept down by pumping\nwhen the trench was being brought near to the wells. It was not\na ' tunnel,' but a trench, subsequently arched over, 4 feet wide, that\nconnected the bottom of the wells E and F, and here also no spring was\nmet with in the stone between the two wells, as is stated on p. 120.\"\nI regret that no mention is made of the length of time that elapsed\nbefore the trenches were covered in, but whether a few hours or days,\nit is obvious the water-bearing character of the surrounding sandstone\nwas very different in different places, through jointing or otherwise.\nEven allowing for possible looseness of observation on the part of\nEdwards, the broad facts remain that a copious supply was found in\ncertain spots indicated by the dowser and not in others closely\nadjacent. Sir Henry Harben confirms the fact that, prior to connecting\nthe wells E and F, one of these wells was pumped \" continuously while\nthe work was proceeding,\" during which the level of the water in the\nother well did not sink perceptibly.\nSir Henry Harben also informed Mr. Westlake that the engineer\nwhom he consulted, and whose advice failed, was a leading water-\nengineer of large experience. He walked over the whole ground and\nhis attention was specially directed to the pond and to the fact that\nwater was sometimes seen on the higher ground ; but he decided to\nreject that locality, and the high ground geneially, and fixed on the\nsite where the well B was sunk, with adits, at a useless expenditure\nof \u00a31,000. Mullins was told exactly what the engineer was told,\nthough he did not see the pond; on trying with the \"rod,\" he\nutterly scouted the place the engineer had fixed on, and decided on\nthe higher ground.\nIt seems that Mullins (who is now dead) came twice ; at first he\n\" located \" the wells D and E, and on the second visit the wells F and\nG ; it was then he stated no water would be found between E and F.\nHaving contracted for the well-sinking, his son, Joseph Mullins, carried\nout the work and also, it is said, independently found by the \"rod\" the\nspring at F.\nThe bed of stone in which the wells are sunk is about 100 feet\nabove the outcrop of the Horsham Stone at Warnham (Geological\nSurvey, sheet 8), and is the \" No. 2, Sand and Sandstone \" of Messrs.\nTopley and Drew \u2014viz., the second of seven subordinate permeable beds\nthat occur in the Weald Clay, of which the Horsham Stone is the first\nand lowest. (See Topley's Geology of the Weald, 1875, pp. 102, 104.)\n\f280 [PART\nProfessor W. F. Barrett.\nMr. Westlake suggests that one of the best tests of the claims\nof the dowser would be a series of experiments in connection with\nsuitable engineering works, such, for example as a projected deep\ncutting for a new railway. The dowser should be taken over the\nground before the cutting was begun, and his report as to the existence,\nthe exact location, and the probable depth of any undeiground water\nthat might be met with should be carefully noted. The cutting should\nthen be watched and reported on during construction in respect of any\nsprings, or lines of flow that might be encountered. The expense of\nsuch a test would not be great, and I think it is most desirable it\nshould be made ; two dowsers should, however, be employed, indepen\ndently of each other, to examine and report beforehand.\nMy best thanks are due to the Editor, and to Miss A.

Introductory.\nTwo reports on the trance-phenomena of Mrs. Piper have been\npublished in our Proceedings (see above), and to these I refer the reader\nfor information concerning the experiments made with her prior to the\nyear 1892. All that.I need repeat here is that Mrs. Piper passes into\na trance, during which apparently other personalities than the normal\nwaking Mrs. Piper \" control \" her body, use her organs of speech, or\nwrite with her hand, and show a knowledge of facts which Mrs. Piper\ncould not have obtained by ordinary means. These other personalities\npurport to be the \"spirits\" of disembodied human beings, and make\ncommunications which take the form of coming from the still existing\n\" deceased \" friends or relatives of the persons who have \" sittings \"\nwith Mrs. Piper. In the early years of Mrs. Piper's trances, her voice\nwas usually controlled by a personality that went under the name of\n\"Doctor Phinuit,\" who acted as intermediary in the communications ;\nbut of late years the communications have been chiefly independent of\nPhinuit, who for the past year has not manifested at all.\nOf course the first point that will occur to the reader is how we\nknow that these manifestations are not due wholly to imposture. This\nquestion has been fully considered in the above-mentioned reports, but\nit may be well for me to give a brief summary of our previous conclu\nsions. My own knowledge of Mrs. Piper began in May, 1887, about a\nfortnight after my arrival in Boston, and my first appointment for a\nsitting was made by Professor William James. Professor James had\nvisited her about a dozen times during the previous year and half, and\nhad sent a large number of persons to her, making appointments himself\ni The responsibility for the views expressed in this paper rests entirely with its\nauthor.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 285\n\" for most of these people, whose names were in no instance announced\nto the medium.\" As a result of his inquiries he became fully satisfied\nthat Mrs. Piper had supernormal powers.\nI had several sittings myself with Mrs. Piper, at which much\nintimate knowledge, some of it very personal, was shown of deceased\nfriends or relatives of mine ; and I made appointments for sittings for\nat least fifty persons whom I believed to be strangers to Mrs. Piper,\ntaking the utmost precautions to prevent her obtaining any informa\ntion beforehand as to who the sitters were to be. The general result\nwas the same as in my own case. Most of these persons were told facts\nthrough the trance-utterance which they felt sure could not have become\nknown to Mrs. Piper by ordinary means. For several weeks, moreover,\nat the suggestion of one of our members, detectives were employed for\nthe purpose of ascertaining whether there were any indications that\nMrs. Piper or her husband, or other persons connected with her, tried\nto ascertain facts about possible sitters by the help of confederates, or\nother ordinary methods of inquiry ; but not the smallest indication\nwhatever of any such procedure was discovered. My own conclusion\nwas that\u2014after allowing the widest possible margin for information\nobtainable under the circumstances by ordinary means, for chance\ncoincidence and remarkable guessing, aided by clues given consciously\nand unconsciously by the sitters, and helped out by supposed hyperes\nthesia on the part of Mrs. Piper,\u2014there remained a large residuum\nof knowledge displayed in her trance state, which could not be\naccounted for except on the hypothesis that she had some supernormal\npower; and this conviction has been strengthened by my later\ninvestigations.\nFurther, Mrs. Piper came to England, at our request, in November,\n1889, and remained till February, 1890, and during that time gave\neighty-three sittings under the supervision of Dr. Walter Leaf,\nProfessor Lodge, and Mr. Myers. Due precautions were, of course,\ntaken as regards the introduction of sitters, etc., and suffice it to say\nthat the above observers became convinced that the claim to super-\nnormally acquired knowledge in Mrs. Piper's trance was fully justified.\nBut although this general conclusion was reached, there was no\nunanimity of opinion as to the explanation. Thus Dr. Walter Leaf, for\nexample, adopted the position that Dr. Phinuit was \"only a name for\nMrs. Piper's secondary personality, assuming the name and acting the\npart with the aptitude and consistency which is shown by secondary\npersonalities in other known cases \" ; and that the supernormal\nphenomena shown were explicable on the hypothesis of thought-\ntransference from the sitters. Professor Lodge, on the other hand,\nheld that something more of supernormal character was involved in\nmany of the instances than could be explained by thought-transference\nu 2\n\f286 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nfrom the sitters, and he found himself forced to the hypothesis\nof \" telepathy from distant persons if that is in any way feasible,\ntelepathy from deceased persons only as a last resort, but telepathy\nof some kind, as distinct from any conceivable method of extracting\ninformation from persons present.\"\nIn my own previous reports which dealt with sittings up to\nOctober, 1891, I stated that the hypothesis which for a long time\nhad seemed to me most satisfactory was that of an auto-hypnotic\ntrance in which a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper either\nerroneously believes itself to be, or consciously and falsely pretends\nto be, the \"spirit\" of a deceased human being, and further fictitiously\nrepresents various other personalities according to the latent ideas of\nsome of the sitters. I added, however, that my confidence in this\nexplanation had been considerably shaken by further familiarity with\nthe Phinuit personality and other allied manifestations of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance state, and that I had no certain conviction that any single\ntheory which had been put forward was really the correct one. It was\nindeed the case that many sitters believed themselves to he, through\nMrs. Piper's trance, in actual communication with deceased friends ;\nbut various considerations made this view very difficult of acceptance.\nThe personality known as Phinuit could give no satisfactory account\nof himself; he was unable to justify, by any evidence of identity,\nhis claim that he was a deceased human being, and still less could he\njustify his claim that he had been a French doctor. In some cases\nthe sittings were total failures. And in many others the correct\nstatements were mixed up with much other matter that was irrelevant\nor wrong. There was also at times a great deal of what appeared to\nbe guessing and \" fishing \" on the part of Phinuit, and even when\nextraordinary specific knowledge was shown of private matters con\ncerning sitters and their deceased friends, Phinuit was unable to get\nsatisfactory replies to other questions, the answers to which were well\nknown to the alleged communicators when living. In short, while any\nunbiassed student of the previous records in our Proceedings would\nconclude that the phenomena demanded some hypothesis which went\nat least as far as telepathy, there were difficulties in the way of\naccepting either the spiritistic hypothesis, or telepathy from the living,\nas an adequate explanation.\nThese difficulties have by no means been altogether removed, but\nsince the writing of the last Report on the trance-phenomena mani\nfested by Mrs. Piper, several circumstances have occurred the result\nof which has been that a marked improvement has taken place in the\nquality of the evidence, and some new light, I incline to think, has\nbeen thrown upon its significance. One of these circumstances was\nthe sudden death, early in 1892, of a young man keenly interested in\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 287\nintellectual pursuits generally\u2014and aware of the investigations of the\nS.P.R.\u2014who purported to make himself known about four weeks later\nthrough Mrs. Piper's trance, \u2014and who since that time has been ready\nwith assistance for most other \" communicators.\" I shall refer to him\nas George Pelham, or G. P. Whether the real G. P. has anything to\ndo with it at all, whether there are any \" communicators \" concerned\nbeyond some part of Mrs. Piper's personality and the personalities of\nthe sitters and other living persons, remains for consideration later.\nThis manner of speech is the most convenient for rendering the facts\nintelligible to my readers, and is of course merely descriptive of the\nfashion which they assume. It would give a totally wrong impression\nof the phenomena were I to simply speak of Mrs. Piper as producing\nthe manifestations which occur through her organism in a state of\ntrance ; and to attempt to give a full description in each case of what\nis \" claimed \" or \" alleged \" or \" purported \" would involve a tedious\nand useless, if not a confusing, repetition. Hence, I shall as a rule\nrefer to the alleged communicators, Phinuit, G. P., and others, as\nthough they were distinct personalities. Superficially at least they\ntake this form ; it is this form which gives a very special character to\nthe sittings ; and provisionally, therefore, I adopt it, for the sake of\nclearness and convenience of description.\nAnother circumstance leading to the improvement of the quality\nof the evidence was the development of automatic writing during Mrs.\nPiper's trance. That is to say, Mrs. Piper's hand during the trance is\nfrequently taken possession of by some other \"control,\" while Phinuit\nstill remains master of the voice. Phinuit \" loses the hand,\" and\napparently is unaware of what it writes. This channel of communica\ntion, while not absolutely originated by George Pelham, was developed\nchiefly by him, and has thereafter served for a large number of different\n\"communicators\" as a method substitutive of, or auxiliary to, that of\nusing Phinuit as their intermediary. Further, Phinuit himself claims\nand appears to have been benefited by the stimulation of his new co\nworker in the task of providing proof of supernormal faculty. Later,\nin March, 1893, Mrs. Piper underwent a capital surgical operation in\na Woman's Hospital, for the removal of a traumatic tumour, thereby\ngetting rid of a continual source of ill health which had troubled her\nfor many years, and which had interfered much with her sittings. It\nwas the accumulated result of an injury, caused many years ago by\na collision with an ice-sled. (See Appendix III., p. 479). After Mrs.\nPiper's recovery she was able to give sittings with much greater\nregularity than before, and appeared to be much less exhausted by\nthem. But in the course of 1895 the development of a serious hernia,\nnot an unusual result after such an operation as hers, again interfered\nmuch with her sittings, so that finally another operation became\n\f288 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nnecessary. This was performed in February, 1896 ; and it was not\ntill October of that year that she resumed her sittings. Since then\nher health has been uniformly better than I have ever known it to\nbe, and she may now be regarded as a thoroughly healthy woman.\nAltogether, since my last Report, I am familiar with the results of\nmore than 500 sittings, of which, however, only about l.'JO were for\nfirst sitters, and of some of these I received only oral accounts. Of the\nwritten reports of first sittings there are many which I am practically\nunable to use as evidence, owing to the reluctance of the sitters to\nallow the private matters concerned to be published in any form.\nThere are others which I could publish only under such restrictions\nand with such alterations that they would lose much of their\nsignificance. Others again I am prevented from using by the fact\nthat,\u2014notwithstanding repeated inquiries on my part, and the express\nor implied promise by the sitters beforehand that such results as were\nnot too private would be at our disposal,\u2014I have failed in getting the\nsitters to make detailed comments upon the reports. Owing to these\nvarious causes a large amount of the best evidence derivable from first\nsittings is unavailable for publication.\nOf the other sittings some fell into series which I am able to use,\nto a certain extent, as explained below ; many were for persons who\nhad frequently sat before with Mrs. Piper, and the communications\nat these were chiefly of a personal character ; many were held by\nmyself or other persons for the purpose of getting some light if possible\nfrom the communicators themselves concerning the rationale of the\nphenomena. This last matter, not being of directly evidential value, is\nscarcely adapted for publication in detail in our Proceedings, or at least\nnot in the present stage of our inquiry ; but later in my paper I shall\nmake brief reference to some of it so far as it seems to be of assistance\nin the way of explanation.\nNotwithstanding, however, the mass of matter which it is im\npossible or undesirable to publish, there are at our disposal more\nrecords than it seems at all profitable to print in extenso. Much of\nthis available matter contains nothing specially new in character, and\nresembles the ordinary sittings of which our members have had\nsufficient illustration in the previous reports. I shall therefore omit\nmany of these entirely and abridge or omit portions of many others,\nbeing careful of course to give due prominence to failures.\nI may add that the large majority of the sittings were supervised\nby myself, and I was also the chief note-taker, except in cases where\na stenographic reporter was present, or my place was taken by my\nassistant, Miss Edmunds.\nNow, although for the purpose of establishing that Mrs. Piper\npossesses some supernormal faculty, the records of \"first sittings,\"\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 289\nwhere precautions have been taken to prevent Mrs. Piper's acquiring\nknowledge beforehand as to the sitter, are especially valuable, they\ncannot lead us very far in the direction of complete explanation.\nThey may add largely to the proof that Mrs. Piper's trance-personality\nshows knowledge of particular facts about the sitter which Mrs. Piper\ncannot intelligently be supposed to have acquired by normal means,\nthat private facts known only to the sitter are frequently communi\ncated, and that occasionally a knowledge is manifested of events\nentirely unknown to the sitter and afterwards verified. Further,\naccompanying this exhibition of supernormal knowledge there may be\na more or less personal element characteristic of some deceased friend\nof the sitter, and leading the sitter to the conclusion that he is in\ndirect and actual communication with this departed friend. It is,\nnevertheless, difficult to suppose that however remarkable such first\nsittings may be, they could form a satisfactory basis for the \"spiritistic\"\ntheory. They might indeed be profoundly suggestive of such a theory,\nand in the minds of many might raise a presumption in its favour,\nbut they would still be apt to remain, for the probing investigator,\ninadequate ; they would still be apt to appear as comparatively\nisolated groups of facts, bound together, as it were, only by the plastic\nand mysterious, but persistent personality known as Phinuit.\nWe might compare such phenomena to those of an imaginary\nhaunted house, where there was continually some manifestation of an\nintelligent but somewhat unreliable personality, that exhibited strange\ninformation about most of the successive visitors to the house\u2014 some of\nwhom thought that they felt there the conscious presence of deceased\nfriends and relatives. If we suppose that this haunting phantasm,\nwhile giving such strange true information about others, was far from\nable to give information about itself sufficient to identify it with any\nonce living human being, and that the information actually obtainable\nconcerning the inception of the haunting strongly tended to show that\nthe phantasm represented a character in a purely invented sensational\nnovel, we should be confronted with a problem much like that pre\nsented by Mrs. Piper so long as we confine our main attention to the\nresults of first sittings.\nWhen I wrote my previous Report, there were not wanting several\ninstances where the witnesses had enjoyed more or less frequent\nopportunities of judging as to the knowledge and peculiarities of certain\n\" controls \" purporting to be their personal friends. But the only\nimportant accounts of these which I was able to publish were\ncontributed by Miss A. M. R. (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., pp.\n111-114) and Miss W. (loc. cii., pp. 29-34), each of whom had many\nsittings at which an intimate friend purported to take \" control \" and\nuse the voice instead of Phinuit.\n\f290 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nMiss R. wrote concerning her friend's \" control \" :\u2014\n\" In .1 great many little ways he is quite like what my friend used to be\nwhen living, so much so that I am afraid it would take a great deal of\nexplanation to make me believe that his identical self had not something to\ndo with it, wholly apart from the medium's powers or from anything that\n\" may be in my own mind concerning him.\"\nAnd Miss W. wrote :\u2014\n\" The clearly-marked personality of that friend, whom I will call T., is\nto me the most convincing proof of Mrs. P.'s supernatural power, but it is a\nproof impossible to present to any one else.\"\nNow it so happens that I have before me several series of sittings\nrecorded in detail where repeated attempts have been made by the\n\" same deceased person \" to communicate. Much the longest and most\nremarkable of these series of communications has concerned the identity\nof the young man to whom I have referred above as George Pelham or\nG. P. Unfortunately, but necessarily, the most important evidence\ntending to show that the real G. P. was in some way \" communicating \"\ncannot be published. It concerns the confidential remembrances of\nfriends, dealing not only with personal matters pertaining to G. P.\nhimself alone, but with incidents of a private nature relating to other\npersons living. I shall endeavour, however, as far as possible, to give a\nfairly full description here of the general character of the communi\ncations and the kind of evidence offered in justification of the claim\nthat they emanate from the still persisting individuality of G. P. It\nwas the first part of this series in particular to which I referred in the\nAddendum to my previous Report on Mrs. Piper (Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. VIII., p. 58) when I wrote that :\u2014\n\" Mrs. Piper has given some sittings very recently which materially\nstrengthen the evidence for the existence of some faculty that goes beyond\nthought-transference from the sitters, and which certainlyprima facie appear\nto render some form of the 'spiritistic' hypothesis more plausible.\"\nBefore entering into the details of this series of sittings, it seems\ndesirable that I should describe the development of the automatic\nwriting aforementioned. I may here explain briefly the order which\nI propose to adopt in this Part of my Report. After describing the\ndevelopment of the automatic writing in Mrs. Piper's trance, I shall\nfirst give a somewhat detailed running history of the early G. P.\ncommunications, following this by a summary (p. 328) of the general\ncharacter of the evidence pointing to the real G. P. as the com\nmunicator, and offering a preliminary explanation of the failures and\ndeficiencies that may seem at first sight to conflict with this view. I\nshall then give some brief accounts of other communicators, and\nproceed to consider specially whether the \" spirit \" hypothesis or\nthe hypothesis of telepathy from the living is the more probable\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 291\nexplanation of the manifestations in question, pointing out that the\nresults present an appearance precisely in accordance with what we\nshould expect from returning \"spirits\" communicating under the con\nditions involved, and that such results do not fall into orderly relation\nwith one another on the hypothesis of telepathy from the living. I\nshall then give a very brief account of recent changes in Mrs. Piper's\ntrance, and indicate the lines of investigation that seem likely to be\nmost fruitful in this and similar cases. \u2022\nMuch of the illustrative material which I quote, apart from the\nearlier G. P. communications, will be found in greater detail in the\nAppendices which follow the body of the Report; but these Appendices\ncontain also other records which are more or less representative, and\nwhich I have not attempted to summarise. Appendix I., which\ncontains extracts from a series of stenographically-reported sittings\nspecially concerned with G. P., should be read in connection with\nsection \u00a7 3 of the Report, which deals with the G. P. communications.\nThe sittings recorded in Appendix II. cover the period November, 1891,\nto February, 1893 ; and those in Appendix III. cover the period from\nOctober, 1893,\u2014about which time Mrs. Piper resumed regular sittings\nafter her operation in the preceding March,\u2014to the latter part of\n1895. Appendix IV. contains a group of sittings belonging chiefly\nto the period of 1892, and concerned with the family and intimate\nfriends of Dr. A. B. Thaw. I fear that most of my readers will avoid\nthese somewhat lengthy detailed records, and confine themselves to\nthe incidents which I quote from them in the body of my Report.\nThe psychological student, however, may find them far too few, and I\nhope in the future to place as complete a record as possible of my\ndetailed investigations in the rooms of the Society.\n\u00a7 2. Development of Automatic Writing in Mrs. Piper's Trance.\nThe first case of this automatic writing which I witnessed myself\noccurred on March 12th, 1892. The sitter, a lady, had taken several\narticles as test objects, among them a ring which had belonged to\nAnnie D .\nPhinuit made references to this lady, giving the name Annie, and\njust before the close of the sitting Mrs. Piper's right hand moved\nslowly up until it was over the top of her head. The arm seemed\nto become rigidly fixed in its position, as though spasmodically\ncontracted, but the hand trembled very rapidly. Phinuit exclaimed\nseveral times: \"She's taken my hand away,\" and added : \"she wants\nto write.\" I put a pencil between the fingers, and placed a block-\nbook on the head under the pencil. No writing came until, obeying\nPhinuit's order to \"hold the hand,\" I grasped the hand very firmly at\n\f292 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nits junction with the wrist and so stopped its trembling or vibrating.\nIt then wrote : \" I am Annie D [surname correctly given] ... I\nam not dead ... I am not dead but living. ... I am not dead\n. . . world . . . good bye ... I am Annie D .\" The hold\nof the pencil then relaxed, and Phinuit began to murmur \" Give me\nmy hand back, give me my hand back.\" The arm, however, remained\nin its contracted position for a short time, but finally, aa though with\nmuch difficulty, and slowly, it moved down to the side, and Phinuit\nappeared to regain control over it. Previous to this I had witnessed\na little of Phinuit's writing, but I was not aware that any other\n\" control \" had used the hand while Phinuit was manifesting at the\nsame time. I have since learned from Miss A. M. B., some of whose\nexperiences with Mrs. Piper were described in my former Report\n(Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., pp. 111-114), that her \"friend H.,\" to\nwhom she there refers as having written when controlling the body in\nthe absence of Phinuit, wrote several sheets on May 23rd, 1891, and\nMiss R. finds the note appended :\u2014\n\" Written when Phinuit had control, but H. said that he seized and\ncontrolled the hand and wrote it.\"\nAt several other sittings in the course of the next few weeks more\nwriting was produced very similarly, the block-book being held on the\ntop of the head, but apparently with much less inconvenience to\nPhinuit. On April 29th, 1892, I placed a table so that Mrs. Piper's\nright arm could rest comfortably upon it, and suggested that the hand\nshould write on a block-book on the table instead of on the head. The\narm had already taken up its position with the hand over the head,\nPhinuit saying that \" George \" was going to write, but partly owing to\nmy request for the new position, and partly by using not a little\nforce,\u2014the resistance to which was diminished after my repeated\nrequest, \"You must try to write on the table,\"\u2014I succeeded in\ngetting the arm down, and thereafter the writing has been habitually\nproduced with the arm resting, more or less, on a table to the right of\nMrs. Piper.\nWhen the arm is being seized \" for the purpose of writing,\" as also\nto a less extent when Phinuit is regaining control, it shows a certain\namount of spasmodic movement, which occasionally is extremely\nviolent, knocking pencils and block-books helter-skelter off the table,\nand requiring considerable force to restrain it. Sometimes, but not\noften, the writing will be interrupted by a spasm in the arm, and the\nhand will be strongly clenched and bent over at the wrist, but after\nan interval that can be measured in seconds rather than minutes, the\nhand will be released and proceed with the writing. It is not necessary\nfor Phinuit to stop talking while the hand is writing. On one occasion\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 293\nwhen I was present Phinuit was listening to the stenographic report\nof a previous interview, commenting upon it, making additions to his\nstatements about some objects, and at the same time the hand was\nwriting freely and rapidly on other subjects, and holding conversation\nwith another person, the hand purporting to be \" controlled \" by a\ndeceased friend of that person. This lasted for over twenty minutes.\nOn another occasion, when I was not present, I was informed that\nPhinuit for about an hour kept up a specially rapid and vigorous\ntalk, more voluble even than usual with him, with two or three\nyoung girls who were present at the sitting, and during the whole of\nthis time the hand was writing on other matters with another person.\nThe only one that appeared to be distracted was the sitter who was\ntalking with the \" hand,\" who was remonstrated with by the \"hand \"\nfor not paying sufficient attention to it. I have frequently witnessed,\nduring lesser intervals, the \" hand \" writing with one person and\nPhinuit talking with another, and also the \" hand \" writing and Phinuit\ntalking at the same time to myself, and have never failed to get this\ndouble action when desired if Phinuit was present and the hand was\nbeing used by another \"control.\" In all cases when the \"hand\" is\nwriting independently of Phinuit, the sense of hearing for the \" hand-\ncontrol \" appears to be in the hand, whereas Phinuit apparently always\nhears through the ordinary channel. This apparent hetersesthesia will\nbe considered in Part II. of my Report.\nThe writings, of course, as already implied, do not always purport\nto come from the same person, nor is writing always produced at\na sitting. If writing occurs at any sitting it usually purports to\ncome directly from some deceased friend of the sitter. About the\ncharacteristics of the actual handwritings themselves I shall have\nsomething to say later. At present it is enough to say that they vary\nsuperficially a great deal, according to the excitement, so to speak, of\nthe purported \"communicator,\" to the frequency of his writing in that\nway previously, and probably to other causes difficult to estimate except\nspeculatively. It would seem, moreover, that until instructed in some\nway, the quasi-personality that guides the writing is unaware that he is\nwriting. The process from the point of view of the \"communicator\"\nrather resembles the definite thinking of his thoughts, with the object\nof conveying them to the sitter,\u2014and I feel very sure that this is\ntrue whatever theory may be held as to the identity of the \" com\nmunicator,\" whether this is what it purports to be, or merely another\nstratum of Mrs. Piper's mind believing itself to be an extraneous\nintelligence.\nSoon after this writing began, it occurred to me that possibly the\nleft hand might also write, and that it might be possible to get botli\nhands writing and Phinuit speaking all at the same time on different\n\f294 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nsubjects with different persons, and I remarked to Phinuit that I\nhoped some day to get a separate \"control\" of each finger and toe\nof the medium's body, while he could manage the voice. On\nFebruary 24th, 1894, what we have called the \"E\" control wrote\nin the course of some remarks about certain \" mediums \" : \" In these\ncases there is no reason why various spiritual minds cannot express\ntheir thoughts at the same time through the same organism.\" I then\nreferred to my proposed experiment with the two hands, and said\nthat I would arrange to try it some time, with \" E \" using one hand\nand \"George\" the other, but that I was not prepared to make the\nexperiment at that time. At my next sitting, February 26th, 1894,\nwhen I was unprepared and was alone, an attempt, only very partially\nsuccessful, was made to write independently with both hands at the\nver,y beginning of the sitting. On March 18th, 1895, another attempt\nmuch more successful was made, when I was accompanied for the\npurpose by Miss Edmunds. Her \" deceased sister \" wrote with one\nhand and G. P. with the other, while Phinuit was talking, all\nsimultaneously on different subjects. Very little, however, was\nwritten with the left hand. The difficulty appeared to lie chiefly in\nthe deficiencies of the left hand as a writing-machine.\nSometimes, shortly before the hand starts writing, Phinuit gives\nnotice that some one is \"going to talk with you himself.\" Sometimes\nthe hand is \"seized,\" and passes through its convulsive vagaries while\nPhinuit gives no sign but talks on with the sitter continuously, even\nafter the writing has started. To give an extreme instance of this,\nat a sitting where a lady was engaged in a profoundly personal\nconversation with Phinuit concerning her relations, and where I was\npresent to assist, knowing the lady and her family very intimately,\nthe hand was seized very quietly and, as it were, surreptitiously, and\nwrote a very personal communication to myself, purporting to come\nfrom a deceased friend of mine, and having no relation whatsoever\nto the sitter ; precisely as if a caller should enter a room where two\nstrangers to him were conversing, but a friend of his also present, and\nwhisper a special message into the ear of the friend without disturbing\nthe conversation.\nIn the case of a new communicator, however, Phinuit frequently\nrequests the sitter to \" talk to him,\" i.e., to the hand-writer, though\nPhinuit is not averse from keeping up the oral conversation as well, if\nthis is desired. Indeed he seems to prefer this, but when the sitter\nturns to pay attention to the hand, Phinuit frequently makes some\nsuch enigmatical remark as \"I'll help him,\" or \"I'll help to hold him\nup.\" At other times Phinuit will request that an article should be\ngiven to himself, so that he might have something to engage his atten\ntion, and I have known him to blurt out something about the article\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 295\nin the middle of the sitting, while the writing is still going on. At\nany time, apparently, under these circumstances, Phinuit can be evoked\nfrom his silence by talking into the ear, and will at once resume the\ncommunication while the writing continues without a break.\n\u00a7 3. History of the G. P. Communications.\nNow to proceed with the history of the G. P. communications.\nSome preliminary statements are required to enable the reader to\nform a fair judgment on the facts to be presented.\nG. P. met his death accidentally, and probably instantaneously,\nby a fall in New York in February, 1892, at the age of thirty-two\nyears. He was a lawyer by training, but had devoted himself chiefly\nto literature and philosophy, and had published two books which\nreceived the highest praise from competent authorities. He had\nresided for many years in Boston or its vicinity, but for three years\npreceding his death had been living in New York in bachelor apart\nments. He was an Associate of our Society, his interest in which\nwas explicable rather by an intellectual openness and fearlessness\ncharacteristic of him than by any tendency to believe in supernormal\nphenomena. He was in a sense well known to me personally, but\nchiefly on this intellectual side ; the bond between us was not that\nof an old, intimate, and if I may so speak, emotional friendship. We\nhad several long talks together on philosophic subjects, and one very\nlong discussion, probably at least two years before his death, on the\npossibility of a \"future life.\" In this he maintained that in accord\nance with a fundamental philosophic theory which we both accepted,\na \" future life \" was not only incredible, but inconceivable ; and I\nmaintained that it was at least conceivable. At the conclusion of the\ndiscussion he admitted that a future life was conceivable, but he did\nnot accept its credibility, and vowed that if he should die before I did,\nand found himself \"still existing,\" he would \"make things lively\" in\nthe effort to reveal the fact of his continued existence.\nOn March 7th, 1888, he had a sitting with Mrs. Piper, one of a\nseries arranged by the Committee on Mediumistic Phenomena\nconnected with the American S.P.R. (See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.\nVIII., p. 2). The names of the sitters in this series were very carefully\nguarded by the Committee, and I may add my own opinion that Mrs.\nPiper never knew until recently that she had ever seen G. P. At the\nsitting which G. P. attended, the Rev. Minot J. Savage acted as the\nsupervising member of the Committee, and G. P. was a stranger to\nhim. (See p. 326).\nG. P.'s conclusion was, briefly, that the results of this sitting did\nnot establish any more than hypersesthesia on the part of the medium.\n\f296 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nI knew of G. P.'s death within a day or two of its occurrence, and\nwas present at several sittings with Mrs. Piper in the course of the\nfollowing few weeks, but no allusion was made to G. P. On March\n22nd, 1892, between four and five weeks after G. P.'s death, I\naccompanied Mr. John Hart [not the real name], who had been an old\nintimate friend of his, to a sitting.i I understood from Mr. Hart that\nhe had some articles with him to be used as tests, but he gave me no\nfurther information than this, though I surmised that the articles might\nhave belonged to G. P. The appointment for the sitting was made by\nmyself, and of course Mr. Hart's real name was not mentioned to Mrs.\nPiper. I abridge from the notes of the sitting made by myself at the\ntime, and substitute, in part, other names for those actually used.2\nThe sitting began by some remarks of Phinuit concerning the sitter,\nfollowed by an incorrect statement about a cousin said to have died\nsome years before with heart trouble. Mr. Hart presented a pencil.3\nPhinuit : Cousin. Heart, through here [clutches throat and about breast\nand lower] something like pneumonia. Do you know that's a brother 1\ni I must mention here that towards the end of 1887, at a time when Mrs. Piper's\nsittings were given in a very much more haphazard way than at present, I had taken\nMr. Hart to Mrs. Piper on the chance of getting a sitting. Mrs. Piper was just\nabout to give a sitting to a lady, so that our visit was futile. In my own opinion this\ncircumstance is irrelevant, but as Mrs. Piper saw Mr. Hart at that time for a few\nminutes, although his name was not mentioned, it might be regarded by some\npersons as important. Further, Mrs. Piper was staying in New York with one of our\nmembers, Dr. Anna Lukens (who knew nothing of G. P.), at the time when G. P.\nmet his death. She went to New York February 8th, 1892, and returned to Boston\nFobruary 20th, ls92, as I learned from Dr. Lukens, staying with Dr. Lukens all the\ntime, and giving a series of sittings. Mrs. Piper independently gave me a concordant\naccount.\n3 Owing to the personal character of many of the incidents referred to in the\nG. P. communications, I have in nearly all cases substituted other names for the real\nones. It has been suggested that the important witnesses in connection with the\nG. P. evidence may have been in collusion with Mrs. Piper. The absurdity of this\nsuggestion would be at once apparent if their real names were given, but since the\nonly real full names given of actual sitters with G. P. are those of Professors C.\nEliot Norton and .Tames M. Peiree, of Harvard University, who are referred to\nchiefly as cases of being recognised by the communicating G. P. as personally known\nto him, I state concerning the others that I know personally all but two of the G. P.\nsitters, and most of them intimately, that they belong to the most cultivated and\nresponsible class in the United States, and that it would be as absurd to suppose any\ncollusion between them and Mrs. Piper as to suppose that the members of the Council\nof the S.P. R. were in collusion with her. Many of them aro also known person\nally to Mr. Myers, who adds the following statement.\u2014R. H.\nI am well acquainted with fourteen of the principal persons cited in the sittings\nabove recorded, in connection with \"George Pelham.\" Several of these, indeed, are\namong my most valued friends. Not only would the idea of their deliberate collusion\nwith Mrs. Piper be absurd, but I also regard then: as very unlikely, from their previous\nopinions and their character, to supply the unconscious collusion\u2014if I may so term\nit\u2014of prepossessed credulity.\u2014Frederic \\V. H. Myers.\n3 In the accounts of sittings, the sitter's remarks are throughout given in round\nbrackets, and explanatory notes in square brackets.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 297\n(Sometimes he used to call me brother.)

(Yes, I know, but he is not dead. ) There\nis another George who wants to speak to you. How many Georges are there\nabout you any way ?\nThe rest of the sitting, until almost the close, was occupied by\nstatements from G. P., Phinuit acting as intermediary. George\nPelham's real name was given in full, also the names, both Christian\nand surname, of several of his most intimate friends, including the\nname of the sitter.\nMoreover, incidents were referred to which were unknown to the\nsitter or myself.\nOne of the pair of studs which J. H. was wearing was given to\nPhinuit. . . . \"(Who gave them to me?) That's mine. I gave\nyou that part of it. I sent that to you. (When ?) Before I came here.\nThat's mine. Mother gave you that. (No.) Well, father then, father\nand mother together. You got those after I passed out. Mother took\nthem. Gave them to father, and father gave them to you. I want you\nto keep them. I will them to you.\" Mr. Hart notes : \" The studs\nwere sent to me by Mr. Pelham as a remembrance of his son. I knew\nat the time that they had been taken from G.'s body, and afterwards\nascertained that his stepmother had taken them from the body and\nsuggested that they would do to send to me, I having previously\nwritten to ask that some little memento be sent to me.\"\nJames and Mary [Mr. and Mrs.] Howard were mentioned with\nstrongly personal specific references, and in connection with Mrs.\nHoward came the name Katharine. \"Tell her, she'll know. I will\nsolve the problems, Katharine.\" Mr. Hart notes : \" This had no special\nsignificance for me at the time, though I was aware that Katharine,\nthe daughter of Jim Howard, was known to George, who used to live\n\f298 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nwith the Howards. On the day following the sitting I gave Mr.\nHoward a detailed account of the sitting. These words, ' I will solve\nthe problems, Katharine,' impressed him more than anything else, and\nat the close of my account he related that George, when he had last\nstayed with them, had talked frequently with Katharine (a girl of\nfifteen years of age) upon such subjects as Time, Space, God, Eternity,\nand pointed out to her how unsatisfactory the commonly accepted\nsolutions were. He added that some time he would solve the pro\nblems, and let her know, using almost the very words of the\ncommunication made at the sitting.\" Mr. Hart added that he was\nentirely unaware of these circumstances. I was myself unaware of\nthem, and was not at that time acquainted with the Howards, and\nin fact nearly every statement made at the sitting, during which\nI was the note-taker, concerned matters of which I was absolutely\nignorant.\nMeredith, an intimate friend of Mr. Hart and G. P., was mentioned.\n\" Lent a book to Meredith. Tell him to keep it for me. Go to my\nroom where my desk is.\" In reply to inquiries (April, 1892), Meredith\nstated that the last time he saw Pelham was in Pelham s own room\nseveral months before the latter's death. They had spent the greater\npart of the day together, and Pelham had pressed Meredith to take\naway some of his manuscripts and books. Thus far the reference to\nMeredith seems to have been correct. But Meredith was unable to\nremember definitely that he took any manuscript or book away.\nThe only references coming from G. P. that were apparently con\nfused or without special significance were the remarks towards the end\nof the sitting : \" Give me a powder ; my tongue is wet \"\u2014which had\nno meaning for the sitter (but which the Howards thought might\nhave reference to a time when G. P. was ill in their house)\u2014and the\nstatements below about the handkerchief and perhaps the \" Uncle\nWill.\" He did leave his papers, letters, etc., \" mixed up.\"\n.John, if that is you, speak to me.

(What does he want with his handkerchief ?) I left it at the Club.\n(What Club?) O U R ... did you find it? (Yes, no, you haven't\ntold me at what Club.) I saw you there. It isn't like you, John. [The\nlast time I saw G. was at the Players' Club in New York.\u2014J. H.]\nWho's Rogets? [Phinuit tries to spell the real name.] (Spell that\nagain.) [At the first attempt afterwards Phinuit leaves out a letter, then\nspells it correctly.] Rogers. (What do you want Rogers to get ?) I want\nyou to tell Rogers to get my handkerchief. I left it. He found it. Rogers\nhas got a book of mine. (What is he going to do with it ?)\n[Both Hart and G. P. knew Rogers, who at that time had a certain\nMS. book of G. P. in his possession. The book was found after G. P. 's\ndeath and given to Rogers to be edited. G. P. had promised during his\nlifetime that a particular disposition should be made of this book after his\ndeath. This action which G. P. living had contemplated with regard to the\nbook was here, and in subsequent utterances which from their private nature\nI cannot quote, enjoined emphatically and repeatedly, and had it been at once\ncarried out, as desired by G. P., much subsequent unhappiness and confusion\nmight have been avoided. Neither Hart nor Rogers knows anything of the\nhandkerchief incident.]\nDuring the latter part of the sitting, and without any relevance to\nthe remarks immediately before and after, which were quite clear as\nexpressions from G. P. came the words, \" Who's James ? Will-\nWilliam.\" [It must be remembered that Phinuit was talking\nthroughout.] This was apparently explained by Phinuit's further\nremarks at the close of the sitting.\nPhinuit : Who's Alice ? (What do you want me to say to her 1) [To\nR. H.] Alice in spirit. Alice in spirit says it's all over now, and tell Alice\nin the body all is well. Tell Will I'll explain things later on. He [George]\ncalls Alice, too, in the body. I want her to know me, too, Alice and\nKatharine. . . . Speak to him. He won't go till you say good-bye.\n[The hand then wrote : George Pelham. Good day (?) John.]\n[Phinuit's reference seemed to be quite clear at the time to Professor\nWilliam James, and the three Alices were discriminated. It seemed as\nthough Phinuit's mention of the other Alices had reminded G. P. of the one\nwell-known to him . Alice James, the sister of Professor William James, had\nrecently died in England. The first name of Mrs. James is also Alice.\nAlice, the sister of Katharine, is the youngest daughter of Mr. Howard and\nwas very fond of G. P.]\nAs I have already said, the most personal references made at the\nsitting cannot be quoted ; they were regarded by J. H. as profoundly\ncharacteristic of Pelham, and in minor matters, where my notes were\nspecially inadequate, such as in the words of greeting and occasional\nremarks to the sitter, the manner of reference to his mother with him\n\" spiritually,\" and to his father and [step] mother living etc., the sitter\nwas strongly impressed with the vraisemblance of the personality of\nPelham.\nx\n\f300 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nIt so happened that appointments had been made for other sitters,\nand it was nearly three weeks before a special opportunity was given\nfor further communication from G. P., at a sitting when Mr. and Mrs.\nJames Howard were present alone. In the interim I accompanied\nseveral different persons to their sittings, and at each of these Phinuit\nrepresented G. P. as anxious to see his friends, using some such remark\nas \" George says, when are you going to bring Jim?\" or \"George says\nhe wants to tell you about the philosophy of this life.\" One only of\nthese sitters, Mr. Vance, had been known to G. P., and at the\nbeginning of his sitting, which was on March 30th, 1892, G. P. first\nwrote a few words to myself expressing a wish to see his father\n(Mr. P.) about some private matters ; then Phinuit spoke for him,\nsaying, \" I want to tell you where I am and what I am doing and\nwhat this life consists of.\" Then references were made to two other\nfriends of G. P., who had also been mentioned at John Harts\nsitting, and then for the first time the sitter was noticed. \" How is\nyour son? I want to see him some time.\" \"Where did he know\nmy son?\" \"In studies, in college.\" This was correct: Mr. Vance\nhad a son who was class-mate of G. P. Mr. Vance then asked :\n\" Where did George stay with us?\" and received a correct answer, a\ndescription of his country house being given. (See pp. 457-8.)\nAt the Howards' first sitting, on April 11th, 1892, for which I\nmade the appointment, of course without giving names, Phinuit said\nvery little. After a few words at the beginning he gave way for what\npurported to be G. P. using the voice, and during nearly the whole of\nthe time of trance apparently G. P. controlled the voice directly. The\nstatements made were intimately personal and characteristic. Common\nfriends were referred to by name, inquiries were made about private\nmatters, and the Howards, who were not predisposed to take any\ninterest in psychical research, but who had been induced by the\naccount of Mr. Hart to have a sitting with Mrs. Piper, were profoundly\nimpressed with the feeling that they were in truth holding a conver\nsation with the personality of the friend whom they had known so\nmany years. The following passages are from Mr. Howard's notes\ntaken during the sitting, and may serve to suggest to some extent\nthe freedom with which the conversation was carried on. All the\nreferences to persons and individuals are correct.\nG. P.: Jim, is that you? Speak to me quick. I am not dead. Don't\nthink me dead. I'm awfully glad to see you. Can't you see me ? Don't\nyou hear me? Give my love to my father and tell him I want to see him.\nI am happy here, and more so since I find I can communicate with you. I\npity those people who can't speak ... I want you to know I think of\nyou still. I spoke to John about some letters. I left things terribly mixed,\nmy books and my papers ; you will forgive me for this, won't you ? . . .\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 301\n(What do you do, George, where you are ?)\nI am scarcely able to do anything yet ; I am just awakened to the\nreality of life after death. It was like darkness, I could not distinguish\nanything at first. Darkest hours just before dawn, you know that, Jim. I\nwas puzzled, confused. Shall have an occupation soon. Now I can see you,\nmy friends. I can hear you speak. Your voice, Jim, I can distinguish with\nyour accent and articulation, but it sounds like a big bass drum. Mine\nwould sound to you like the faintest whisper.\n(Our conversation then is something like telephoning ?)\nYes.\n(By long distance telephone. )\n[G. P. laughs.]\n(Were you not surprised to find yourself living ?)\nPerfectly so. Greatly surprised. I did not believe in a future life. It\nwas beyond my reasoning powers. Now it is as clear to me as daylight.\nWe have an astral fac-simile of the material body. . . . Jim, what are\nyou writing now ?\n[G. P. when living would probably have jeered at the associations of the\nword \"astral.\"\u2014R. H.]\n(Nothing of any importance.)\nWhy don't you write about this t\n(I should like to, but the expression of my opinions would be nothing.\nI must have facts.)\nThese I will give to you and to Hodgson if he is still interested in these\nthings.\n( Will people know about this possibility of communication ?)\nThey are sure to in the end. It is only a question of time when people\nin the material body will know all about it, and every one will be able to\ncommunicate. ... I want all the fellows to know about me. . . .\nWhat is Rogers writing 1\n(A novel. )\nNo, not that. Is he not writing something about me ?\n(Yes, he is preparing a memorial of you.)\nThat is nice ; it is pleasant to be remembered. It is very kind of him.\nHe was always kind to me when I was alive. Martha Rogers [deceased\ndaughter] is here. I have talked with her several times. She reflects too\nmuch on her last illness, on being fed with a tube. We tell her she ought\nto forget it, and she has done so in good measure, but she was ill a long\ntime. She is a dear little creature when you know her, but she is hard\nto know. She is a beautiful little soul. She sends her love to her\nfather.\nBerwick, how is he ? Give him my love. He is a good fellow ; he is\nwhat I always thought him in life, trustworthy and honourable. How is\nl Irenberg ? He has some of my letters. Give him my warmest love. He\nwas always very fond of me, though he understood me least of all my friends.\nWe fellows who are eccentric are always misunderstood in life. I used to\nhave fits of depression. I have none now. I am happy now. I want my\nfather to know about this. We used to talk about spiritual things, but he\nwill be hard to convince. My mother will be easier. . . .\nx 2\n\f302 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\n[As stated above, all the references to persons, incidents, characters, etc.,\nso far as they are known to living persons, are correct.]\nAmong the private matters referred to was the disposition of the\nbook, concerning which G. P. expressed orally the same desire as\nbefore. (See p. 299.) The only writing produced at this sitting\nmoreover was confined to this matter, and was a message to his father\nrepeating his wish.\nHe referred to a tin box of German manufacture which he said\nwas either in New York or Z [giving the name, a very peculiar\none, of the locality of his father's country residence]. He said that\nit contained letters from three persons whom he specified. He washed\nthe Howards to have this box. They replied that the letters were all\nburned.\nG. P. : I think not. I want you to have them. I want you to tell my\nfather about this.\n(Can't you give us something that will convince him ? something we\ndon't know and he does ?)\nI understand, a test. You can tell him about this tin box that I left in\nmy room. I know they have taken the chest, but this tin box they have\nnot. [The box was found at Z , but there were no letters in it. See\nbelow.\u2014R. H.]\n[Mr. Vance, the sitter of March 30th, 1892, had sent me two questions\nfor G. P., which I requested the Howards to put at their sitting. The\nquestions were \" 1. What was the purpose of the association you formed\ntwo years ago with Miss Helen Vance and two other ladies ? 2. Give the\nnames of the two other ladies.\" My impression is that I gave Mr. Howard\nmy recollection of these questions without having the original letter of Mr.\nVance at hand, and probably Mr. Howard put the questions as I gave them\nto him. His account is as follows : ]\nThen we put two test questions, by request of Mr. Hodgson : 1st. What\nwas the nature of the Society formed by you and some other young people ?\nHe was obviously confused, and in trying to answer said \"development.\"\nWe told him not to bother about it now, but to tell us at next sitting, a\nproposal which Phinuit recommended, but he himself in his gruff voice\nsuggested \" Theosophic. \" I told him no. He made a try at question 2nd.\nNames of members of Society, \"Helen Dering \u2014Derrich, or Herrick.\"\n[The questions were apparently not asked until towards the end of the\nsitting, and Phinuit had evidently taken control of the voice and was acting\nas intermediary. The answer must be called wrong, although Helen was\nthe first name of one of the members. See account of next sitting.\u2014It. H.]\nApril 13th, two days later, was the date of the next sitting, when\nthe Howards were present again, and the characteristic personality of\nG. P. was, if possible, made still more manifest than at the previous\nsitting.\nThe \" little tin box \" (see account of previous sitting) was referred to\nagain by G. P., and although the sitters repeated \"All your letters were\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 303\ndestroyed,\" he reiterated \"No, I think riot, not those in box.\" The\nPelhams first wrote that there was only a large tin box, which was in New\nYork, not Z , but finally the \"little tin box\" was found at Z , but\nwas empty when found. [Mrs. Howard knew that G. P. had once possessed\nsuch a tin box.] This was explained to G. P. at a sitting on May 14th,\n1892, by Mrs. Pelham. Phinuit : \" That's the one I had reference to. He\nsays he put some letters in before going across the water, but he doesn't\nremember taking them out.\"]\nAt this sitting (April 13th) G. P. had direct control of the voice\nfor about twenty minutes only. Then Phinuit acted as intermediary,\nand there was also a little writing, a few lines by G. P., in the form\nof an affectionate letter to Mr. and Mrs. Howard. Apparently\nG. P. was more confident of giving his own exact words by the direct\nwriting process than by the method of getting Phinuit to repeat them.\nMr. Howard was absent during part of the sitting, and during his\nabsence G. P. inter alia referred to Mr Vance's questions. (See\nprevious sitting.) The following is from Mr. Howard's notes on his\nreturn to the sitting :\u2014\nI answered part of that question [the part he answered was correct], but\ndid not give the names of the other two people because it would be no test,\nbecause I told her [Mrs. Howard] the names of the other two in life, and\nas she knows them, if I was to give the names in her presence, they would\nsay it was thought-transference. No, I shall reserve the two names to tell\nHodgson some time when he is alone with me, because he does not know\nthem. [All true.]\nMany will regard this as perhaps an excuse for ignorance, as names\nsubsequently given were not correct.\nI wish you could convince my father and ma!:., him come here. (Can't\nyou tell us something he or your mother has dune ?) I saw her brush my\nclothes and put them away. I was by her sido ;,s she did it. I saw her take\nmy sleeve buttons from a small box and give 1 hem to my father. I saw him\nsend them to John Hart. I saw her putting papers, etc., into a tin box.\nThe incident of the \" studs \" was mentioned at the sitting of Hart\n(p. 297). G. P.'s clothes were brushed and put away, as Mrs. Pelham\nwrote, not by herself, but by \" the man who had valeted George.\"\nThe statement made at the same sitting to Mrs. Howard, who had put\nsome violets on the body of G. P. before the coffin was closed : \" I saw\nyou put those violets on my body,\" can of course be accounted for by\nsimple thought-transference from the sitter, and may be regarded as of\nlittle evidential value. But other cases mentioned in the reports of\nsomewhat similar incidents just after death are correctly described.\n(Compare, for example, Phinuit's description, p. 539, of Mrs. Thaw's\nlittle child, Margaret, as having some flowers in her hand; it was in her\nhand, after death, that Mrs. Thaw had placed three little flowers. In\nthe case of Mrs. Sutton's child it was a book that Mrs. Sutton placed\n\f304 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nia the hands, p. 493, and lilies of the valley in the casket, p. 486. See\nalso the reference by John Hart to the question of the disposition of\nhis body after death, and this was unknown tome, p. 354.)\nAn arrangement was made with G. P. that he should watch his\nfather and see him do something that the Howards could not know\nabout and tell them at their next meeting, which was fixed for the\nfollowing day. Mrs. Piper was ill in bed next day, and it was not till\nApril 22nd that the next sitting was held.\nMrs. Howard and myself were present, but I was out of the room\nmost of the time and the record of the sitting was made chiefly from\nMrs. Howard's notes written immediately afterwards.\nMost of the sitting was private, and of the rest I quote only the\npassage for which I have contemporary documents.i G. P. wrote: \"T\nsaw father and he took my photograph and took it to the artist's to\nhave it copied for me. ... I went to Washington ; my father will\nbe hard to convince ; my mother not so hard.\" Mrs. Howard wrote\nto Mrs. Pelham concerning this and other matters referred to at the\nsitting. Mr. Pelham wrote to Mrs. Howard on April 24th, 1892 :\u2014\n. . The letters which you have written to my wife giving such\nextraordinary evidence of the intelligence exercised by George in some\nincomprehensible maimer over the actions of his friends on earth have given\nfood for constant reflection and wonder. Preconceived notions about the\nfuture state have received a severe shock. . . . My wife is writing. . . .\nMrs. Pelham wrote :\u2014\n. . . Some of the things you state are very inexplicable on any other\ntheory than that George himself was the speaker. His father did, without\nmy knowledge, take a photograph of him (the same as the one sent you) to a\nphotographer here to copy\u2014not enlarge. The negative had been broken.\nMrs. L was going to have it copied in N. Y., and Mr. Pelham thought\nhe would see what they could do here. . .\nThe Howards had arranged for another sitting on April 28th, and\nin the interim two or three other persons had sittings. On one of\nthese intermediate days I requested G. P. through Phinuit to obtain\ninformation, if possible, concerning certain incidents, and com\nmunicate the results to the Howards at the next sitting. But the\nHowards in the meantime, as I learned later, had transferred their\ni In connection with some of these early sittings, the contemporary notes are\ndeficient. I entrusted my office copy of the whole first batch of G. P. sittings, with\nappended notes, to Hart, who was about to make a visit to Europe, to show to some\nfriends there, and to be returned to me immediately afterwards. Hart did not return\nthem, was ill for a long time in Europe, where he died in 18(15, and I have not been\nable to recover my original documents. The Howards also later went to Europe for\nthree years, leaving such notes as they possessed stored away in Boston, and it was\nnot till the end of 1897 that I was able to obtain the contemporary documents given\nabove.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 305\nsitting to a friend of theirs, Mr. Peirce. It then occurred to me that\nI would request G. P. at the beginning of the sitting on April 28th to\nvisit the Howards, and bring me word before the end of the sitting\nconcerning the doings of the Howards during the time of the sitting,\nand I sent a special letter to the Howards, asking them to do various\nfantastic things and make a memorandum. The sitting was practically\na complete failure as regards Mr. Peirce, much that was said being\nwrong, and what was right appearing to the sitter to be probably\nderived from indications given by himself (see p. 461). But the\nsitting had one peculiarity which is noteworthy. I carried out my\nintention of sending G. P. away at the beginning of the sitting to\nwatch the Howards, and towards the close Phinuit was interrupted\nby statements about what G. P. claimed to have seen Mrs. Howard\ndoing. In the middle of these statements, the sitter, who was known\nto G. P., seemed to be recognised.\n[Phinuit speaking.]\nShe's writing, and taken some violets and put them in a book. And it\nlooks as if she's writing that to my mother. . . . Who's Tyson . . .\nDavis (R. H : I know. That's all right.) [I apparently supposed that\nthese names had nothing to do with G. P.'s communication. Mrs. Tyson\nwas well known to me, and Davis (or Davies) was the name of her father\n(deceased) whom I had also met.\u2014R.H., 1807.] ... I saw her [Mrs.\nHoward] sitting in the chair. By George ! I've seen that fellow [the sitter]\nsomewhere [touching face] (Why, George, you know me) sitting before a\nlittle desk or table. Took little book, opened it, wrote letter he thinks to\nhis mother. Saw her take a little bag and put some things in it belonging\nto him, placed the photograph beside her on the desk. That's hers. Sent\na letter to T A S O N (Tyson ?) T Y S 0 N. Mrs. [R. H. asks for\nGeorge to tell about sitter's name, etc.] You know [to sitter] that George\nis a comical sort of fellow. He is laughing very hard. There is some joke\nabout his telling your name, I don't know what. He will not tell. [Phinuit\nsays that George recognises the sitter, but doesn't want to tell because we\nwill say he got it out of the sitter's head.] [See p. 303, where a similar\nreason was offered for refusal of information which was not afterwards, in\nits most important part, obtained. In this case, however, the desired\ninformation was given before the close of the sitting. See below.\u2014R.H.]\nShe hunted a little while for her picture, sketching. He's certain that the\nletter is to his mother. She took one of George's books and turned it over\nand said : \" George, are you here ? Do you see that ? \" These were the very\nwords. Then she turned and went up a short flight of stairs. Took some\nthings from a drawer, came back again, sat down to the desk, and then\nfinished the letter. [Phinuit kept feeling sitter's head and face. R. H. was\nurging him to get George to tell about the sitter, etc. Phinuit said at last\nthat George had gone again. R. H. urged Phinuit to find out sitter's name,\netc., from George. Finally Phinuit said he had to go, and Mrs. Piper began\nto come out of trance. Convulsive movements worse than usual, and then\nwhispered voice muttering some words indistinguishable. . . . Further\n\f30G [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nunintelligible sounds, among which the name Peirce was alone distinct.\nThis name was spoken twice, and was not in either Phinuit's or Mrs. Piper's\nordinary voice. Shortly after this Mrs. Piper came to herself.]\nMrs. Piper had seen Mr. Peirce a few days previously (when he\ntried for a sitting, but Mrs. Piper was unable to go into trance), and\nas he is well-known in Boston, may have been aware of his name.\nThis is Mr. Peirce's own explanation of the whispering of the name.\nI do not myself believe that Mrs. Piper did, in her normal state,\nknow his name. I should supplement this by adding that when\nPhinuit declined to give the name of the sitter on the alleged ground\nthat it would be explained by thought-transference from the sitter,\nI charged him with ignorance of the name, and implied that his\nalleged excuse for not giving it was false. This made Phinuit\napparently very annoyed, and he upbraided me for my disbelief in\nhim and his \" spirit \" existence after all that he had done for me.\nI endeavoured to pacify Phinuit and thought I had succeeded, and he\nsaid that he would get the name from George when the latter came\nback. It was almost immediately after this that Phinuit \"had to go.\"\nSince this sitting I have frequently heard Mrs. Piper speak during\nthe interval between trance and waking, on the borderline of waking.\nOn rarer occasions I have heard her speak just as she is losing con\nsciousness before the trance. At both these times her voice, though\nslightly different from the ordinary voice in conversation, is not\ndifferent to the extent that the remark in my contemporary note above\nseems to suggest. Sometimes it is a whisper, more commonly not : but\nit always sounds dreamy or automatic, i.e., it sounds just as I should\nimagine Mrs. Piper's voice would sound if she were talking in her\nsleep, either aloud or in a whisper.\nNow the statements made as to what Mrs. Howard was doing at\nthe time of the sitting were not one of them correct as regards that\nparticular time, though they seemed to indicate a knowledge of Mrs.\nHoward's actions during the previous day and a half, as appears from\nthe following statement :\u2014\nDear Mb. Hodgson,\u2014I did none of those things to-day but all of them\nyesterday afternoon and the evening before !\nYesterday afternoon I wrote a note to Mrs. Tyson declining an invitation\nto lunch ; this I did at a little table. Later I wrote to his mother at a desk,\nand seeing George's violets by me in their envelope, gave them to my\ndaughter to put in my drawer, not \"into a book.\" This is the only\ninaccuracy of detail. The day before I also wrote to his mother, putting his\nphotograph before me on the table while I was writing\u2014two of his photos\nin fact, one from another photo and one from a portrait I had painted of\nhim ; these I afterwards put into his mother's letter. Did \" hunt for my\npicture,\" my painting of him. Also wondered in my mind what they had done\nwith the photo of me painting, and received letter from Mrs. Pclham saying\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 307\nthey had burned it. What he says about the book is also true, though I\ncan't tell at precisely what time I did it as I was alone at the time. In all\nother matters my memory is corroborated by my daughter who took the\nnote to Mrs. T.'s, and saw me put photo before me on the desk. She now\nsays that I only put one before me on the desk and went and got the other\njust before putting it in envelope. It was only a minute on table.\nWhile writing to his mother I did \"go and take things from a drawer,\ncame back again, sat down to the desk, and then finished the letter.\" This\nwas the letter written at the desk, not the one written at a table.\nI ain much disappointed that he did not see what I did this morning. I\nam afraid he was right in saying they had no notion of time. Perhaps it\ntook him too long to come to me, or he did not understand Phinuit's\nquestion.\nI hope to have a chance to hear what you think of this soon.\u2014Yours,\n[Mks. Howard.]\nP. S. \u2014I don't know whether I made it quite clear that I sat thinking,\nwondering where the photo of me while painting could be, and I think that\nin the first of the two letters I wrote to his mother, I told her he had asked\nfor it. I know I thought of doing so.\nI seldom write to Mrs. Tyson and this note is almost the only one I have\nwritten her this winter,\u2014have not written to her for weeks, perhaps months,\nbefore this. It is certainly strange that he should seem to know so much of\nmy doings. I feel as if he must have seen them.\n[G. P.'s reference to a bag is apparently incorrect, as Mrs. Howard makes\nno allusion to it. My impression is that Mrs. Howard told me later that in\nher letter to Mrs. Tyson she referred to the \"G. P.\" subject, but I can find\nno memorandum on this point. I was struck at the time by the consideration\nthat all the incidents mentioned were directly connected with the thought of\nG.P.\u2014R. H., 1897.]\nThis suggested that G. P. had a very obscure perception generally\nof our physical world, and that he had mistaken for contemporary\nphysical events a series of recent scenes in Mrs. Howard's subliminal\nconsciousness. A similar conclusion, to which I called attention in\nmy previous report, was indicated by the experiments which I made\nwith Phinuit in relation to the doings of Mrs. Holmes in New York,\nwhich I said \"strongly suggested that Phinuit in some way was\ngetting glimpses into the mind of Mrs. Holmes, was reading off some of\nher past experiences.\" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., pp. \"24-25.)\nAnother conclusion to which I have come is that usually for\nexperiments of this type to be successful, the agent should be thinking\nstrongly, and \" emotionally,\" of the real person who claims to act as\npercipient, and should also be concerned with matters directly relating\nto him. The failures as well as the successes of G. P. in such\nexperiments point to the existence of a real G. P. as distinguished\nfrom a fragment of Mrs. Piper's personality. (See p. 335).\n\f308 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nOn April 29th, the day following the sitting with Mr. Peirce, Mrs.\nHoward and myself had a sitting, and nearly all the time was occupied\nby G. P. writing. I held the forearm firmly in the neighbourhood of\nthe wrist, in accordance with Phinuit's request to \" help by holding.\"\nThe result of this was to keep the arm steadier, so that the fingers\ncould move independently, but such holding at later sittings soon\nceased to be necessary, except upon rare occasions.\nI must explain some things which you would like to know. I\nwas glad to see Peirce. ,1 could not speak to Dr. Scliville [i.e, Phinuit, who\nhas always given his last name as Scliville. See previous Reports. \u2014R.H.],\nto make him understand what I wanted him to say, so I tried to tell the\nmedium just as she was coming into her body again, and I hope she told you\nthe test you asked for. Ple;ise answer me, did she tell you ? (Yes, she gave\nus the name.) That is all you asked me for. I will now explain. I had so\nmany things in my mind about . . . and other things which you had\nasked me to do for you. The fact is I really had no time or strength to tell\nyou anything about anybody else. However, I will tell you anything I can\nfrom time to time.\n. . . The better way for you ... to get things from me is to ask\nme to look up things for you and then let me tell them to you quite clearly,\nand then if you want me to recall my friends when they are hero simply ask\nme. Then my mind is not full of other things. ... I knew Peirce at\nonce, but could not make Dr. Scliville understand the propriety or good of\nyour wanting me to give his name to him for your benefit. . . . Tell\nMr. Peirce I did not want to slight him or shuffle about, but was so busy\nwith other things, and besides talking to Dr. when in the medium's body\n. . read it . . . it is more or less confusing, and I cannot give it\nso clear. Do you see how it all is, Hodgson? (Yes, I understand exactly.)\nWords can never express what I feel towards you . . . for trying to get\nme to do things te explain to you where I am and how I live, and all for you\nall. Now please give me some tests for me to give to you the next time 1\ncome to you.\nMrs. Howard had received some questions from Mrs. Pelham, and\none of these was given to G. P. at the latter part of the sitting. \"Did\nyou ask your mother to do anything for you in Washington, a short\ntime before your death, something which you cared a great deal about\nhaving done, and do you remember what it was ? \" The answers first\ngiven showed that he understood the question as referring to a time\nafter his death, and concerned with communications at previous\nsittings. After it was explained that his mother wished to know\nwhat it was that he had asked her to do in ^Vashington \" before he\npassed out,\" the following was written :\u2014\nI don't think I told you anything, only in regard to getting me some\npictures and the papers for my writing. I will give it to you again clearly.\nThere is no use trying to act against what is not given us\u2014strength. We\ncan have so much and no more. I have found that out. Do tell Peirce\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 309\nhow I tried to toll the medium, but I don't know you got, whether you got\nit or no. (Yes, we got it.) Good. You see I saw her spirit just as she\nwas going in, and as I could not tell Dr. I took that chance. (We got it\nall right.) Oh, I am so glad. Well, Hodgson, there is no death. What do\nyou think now ? (Do you remember our conversation, when I told you\nabout my hypothesis about a physical basis of a future life ?) I sneered at\nit (Well, it wasn't quite so much as that, but you didn't accept it.) No, I\ndid sneer. (Is it the kind of body I suggested, etherial ?) It is atheria, and\n. . . Etherial, and you were right. [See p. 364.] . . . Now give me\nsome more to do . . that I may prove it to you. Hurry, please,\nfor I am weak. Good bye, friends . .\n[Phinuit then made a few remarks about the difficulty of seeing things\nclearly, etc.\u2014\" It is like looking through a key-hole into a room and trying\nto find out about the people passing backwards and forwards.\"]\nIt was ascertained later from Mrs. Pelham that a lady well-known\nto G. P., whose home was in New York, had been taken ill in\nWashington during a visit there, and that G. P. had requested his\nmother to call upon her. The answer would have been, \"To call upon\nMattie Johnson.\" [This is not the real name.] Following the words,\n\" Good bye, friends,\" in the above writing came three or four other\nwords.\nThe last five letters written at the sitting were not all deciphez-ed at\nthe time ; apparently they formed no word, and I had evidently tried\nto link the letters into some significance with what immediately\npreceded by conjecturing a reading which altered one of the letters\nand made two words out of them, and putting my conjecture in square\nbrackets with a note of interrogation. On recently examining the\noriginal writing I found that these five letters were quite clear, and\nrepresented the first five letters of the first name (one or other way of\nspelling it) of the lady whom G. P. had wished his mother to see in\nWashington, and whose name would have been the substantial part of\nthe answer to the question. In case I might be misreading the\nwriting, I submitted it independently to Miss Edmunds and Dr. W-\nR. Newbold, both of whom have seen much of Mrs. Piper's automatic\nwriting. I gave them no indication whatever as to any possible\ninterpretation. Miss Edmunds interpreted the letters as Matil, and\nDr. Newbold interpreted them as Matie\u2014\"short, of course, for Matilda.\"\nBoth these interpretations had occurred to myself. Although I have\nsubstituted other names, the analogy is very close. The case would\nappear more remarkable if I could mention the actual circumstances.\nI do not know of any other word in the English language that the\nletters concerned could stand for except the first name of the lady in\nquestion.\nThis may appear to be a very trivial circumstance, but it is by\npaying special attention to the mistakes and the obscurities and the\n\f310 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\noddities of these curious trance-phenomena that the most advance, as\nI believe, has been made. There are instances in later sittings which\nindicated that when some question in the nature of a test had been\nput to G. P., the answer to which had been known to the once living\nG. P., some desperate attempt was made to give the answer in one\nway or another, by a last movement of the hand in writing, a last\nutterance through Phinuit, or automatic speech by what I may call\nMrs. Piper's ordinary subliminal, as in the case recorded above, where\nthe name \" Peirce\" was given by Mrs. Piper as she was coming out of\ntrance, in reply to the request for the name of the sitter.i There are\ninstances also suggesting that the same kind of supreme effort, as it\nwere, has been made by G. P. on behalf of other persons. Take, for\nexample, the two following cases. At a sitting shortly after this in\nNew York, G. P. was acting as amanuensis for a deceased lady whom\nhe had known when living. The first name of this lady, a very\nunusual one, had been given, also the place where we had both l>een\nguests together for a week or two one summer was designated, and\nG. P. went on to write some more general statements at her dictation,\nwhich were not meant specially for my benefit. While these were\nbeing written I asked for the surname of the lady, and G. P. rebuked\nme decidedly for my interruption, and proceeded with the statements\nwithout answering my question. \"This,\" thought I, \" is an evasion ;\nit would have been much easier to have written the name, if it were\nknown, than to spend so many words in telling me not to interrupt,\"\nand my suspicion seemed to receive confirmation later, when the\nwriting ended without (as I thought at the time) any sign of a\nreply to my question. Phinuit followed with a few words about\nother matters, but stopped suddenly and called out the letters\nM A N N O R S (pseudonym), in fact almost shouted them, and then\nrepeated the letters, spelling them as before. He said that George\nwas \" yelling at \" him to fay that. The letters which Phinuit gave\nwere indeed the answer to my question. Phinuit spelt the surname\nof the lady, but did not pronounce it (p. 471).\nAnother striking case occurred at the end of M. Paul Bourget's\nsitting on December 11th, 1893. He put four test questions to the\nchief communicator at his sitting, and after the writing apparently\nwas finished and the hand dropped, it was seized again suddenly and\nviolently, and wrote a name beginning with A, but the other letters\nwere indecipherable. This was followed by the name Venice, and then\nanother unavailing attempt at the name A ... I understood\ni This particular desire to answer \" test questions \" if possible at the sitting where\nthey were asked seems to have originated after my discussion with Phinuit at the\nsitting of April 28th, where I urged my dissatisfaction with the reason offered for not\ngiving the sitter's name at once (p. 300).\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance 311\nfrom M. Bourget at the time that a name beginning with A was the\ncorrect answer to one of his questions, but he has not replied to my\ninquiries on this and other points. He himself noted that \" Venice \"\nwas correct (apparently as the answer to one of his questions) ;\nanother question had been answered previously (see p. 375).\nIt is, of course, by no means usually the case that the last scrawls\nare apt to be evidentially the most valuable. On the contrary, the\nlatter part of a sitting, ceteris paribus, is apt to be inferior, owing to\nthe growing exhaustion of the medium, or what the communicator\nwould be more likely to describe as the dimming of the light, and pari\npassu with this dimming there is a tendency for the intelligence at\nwork to become dreamy and confused. But when it appears that the\nintelligence at work has temporarily ceased from the act of com\nmunicating, and afterwards almost immediately returns to give another\nword or two, the circumstances do justify the expectation that the final\nfragments may be specially worth study. The explanation offered is\nthat the communicator's mind, when the act of communicating is\nbroken, regains the balance which it lost while communicating, realises\nmore fully the questions that were put, and recalls more clearly the\nanswers. The swift resumption of communication while the answers\nare \" on the mind,\" and before other thoughts can intervene, is likely\nto result favourably.\nI think it probable myself, then, that there was some such attempt\nin the last writing of the sitting of April 29th. The answer to Mrs.\nPelham's question was- unknown to the sitters at the time, and we\napparently endeavoured to connect the last letters with what preceded.\nIt never occurred to us to look for an answer to Mrs. Pelham's ques\ntion just there, whereas after my later experience it is precisely the\nplace where I should expect to find the answer, especially after\nijr. P.'s statement earlier in the sitting, \" I will give it to you again\nclearly.\"\nI may add a few words in explanation of the general tenour of the\nsitting of April 29th. It was important in helping to bring about an\nappreciation of the difficulties in \" communicating,\" and of the methods\nto be followed for avoiding confusion. G. P. evidently tried to explain\nsome of the limitations to which he was subject, and which I think\nhold good whether we suppose the G. P. communicating to be the\ncomplete veritable once embodied G. P., or only a small portion of that\nG. P., or a fragment of Mrs. Piper's subliminal consciousness. He urged\nthat when he came full of information for which I had asked, he should\nbe allowed to give it before being despatched, so to speak, on another\nerrand, and that when he had certain things to say to me he should\nnot be interupted by other requests. It was some time, however, before\nI understood fully the advice which now seems so clear to me, and I\n\f312 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nwould, for the benefit of other investigators, specially emphasize the\nfact that this advice appears to me to be good, even if we distinctly\nadopt the view that we are here concerned, not with any extraneous\nintelligences, but with some subliminal personality of the medium's.\nAt the next \" G. P.\" sitting, on May 14th, in New York, when\nMrs. Pelham was present (see below) she \"asks about a letter written\nby a friend after he passed out, and places a letter on Mrs. Piper's\nhead.\"\nThe friend was Mattie Johnson, p. 309.\n[Written.] Oh yes, I know her, but cannot recall her name. Mother, I\ntruly cannot think of her name. (Don't you remember you asked me to go\nand see her ?)\n[Phinuit speaks.] \"The test you were after ? \"\n[Written.] I wanted you to go and see her, but I have forgotten her\nname. (It begins with an M. ) I think it was Matilda.\nNo further reference was made to this until during a sitting on\nDecember 5th, 1892, when in the midst of another entirely\nunrelated enquiry which I was making (see p. 423) G. P. suddenly\nreferred to Mattie Johnson, asked if she was better, and also wrote\n\"Washington.\" I paid no special attention to this, but went on with\nmy previous inquiry.\nThe sitting of May 14th, from the record of which I have quoted\nabove, was held at the house of Dr. A. B. Thaw, at whose invitation\nMrs. Piper had gone to New York, and whose guest she was during\nher stay. I arranged for the sitting with Mr. and Mrs. Pelham, who\nwere unknown to Dr. Thaw, and introduced them under other names.\nPhinuit began by saying that somebody was going to write, and the\nwriting started: \"Hallo, father and mother, I am George.\" There\nwere three different batches of writing, with intervals of speech by\nPhinuit on behalf of G. P. Several articles which had been taken\nby Mrs. Pelham were seized with much excitement, and appropriate\nremarks made about them, or actions performed. My report,\nhowever, is too fragmentary to be of much service as regards the\nensuing conversation. There was a very strong personal element, and\nan intimate knowledge was shown of private family matters, especially\nin connection with a living brother. But there was also a certain\namount of confusion, probably owing chiefly, as I now think, to the\ncontinual change of subject. G. P. had various questions to ask,\nand so had the sitters, and they were continually interrupting each\nother. There were three questions, besides the one concerning\nMattie Johnson, which were apparently not answered, or answered\nincorrectly.\n(Mrs. Pelham : What did you give Rogers to publish in the Cosmo\npolitan 1 ) ... He says that's about his life. [See p. 301.] [Mrs.\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 313\nPelham explains that she means something which George gave to Rogers\nto publish in his magazine before George's death.] He'll write it. [Hand\nmoves as though wishing to take pencil, but then apparently relinquishes\nthe idea.]\nNo further reference was made to this. G. P. turned the conver\nsation, through Phinuit, to family matters. Later on Mr. Pelham\nasked a question about a lady, giving her name. Thereupon Phinuit\nrepeated three other Christian names of ladies which had no relevance,\nand again the subject was changed. Towards the end of the sitting,\nwhile writing was going on, Mrs. Pelham asked about a MS. book\nof poems, and the reply came, \"That has been laid in one of my\ndrawers.\"\n[Mrs. Pelham says that this isn't so.] Ask Harry Meredith. [Mrs.\nPelham remarks that she thought Harry Meredith was dead. R. H. says\nthat he supposed that Harry Meredith was living, but was not sure.] Harry\nwill tell. [See p. 298. Harry Meredith was then and I believe still is living.\n\u2014R. H.] It is not right for me to stay longer.\nThere was evidently some misunderstanding about this question,\nas the book referred to was the one about which G. P. had shown a\nfull knowledge at previous sittings, but the confusion may have been\ndue to the failing energy, as the trance was just about to end. All\nother questions apparently were exactly appreciated, references to his\nbrother, to his father's two different homes, to the circumstances of\nthe accident that caused his death, to his own mother and sister\ndeceased, his unfinished MSS., books and letters that he had received\nand that he wished to be returned, and the mutual relations between\nhis father and mother and certain friends. Great anxiety was shown\nby G. P. to make some arrangement for giving tests by describing at\na later sitting what his father and mother were doing at some specified\ntime, and it was decided that he should follow them that afternoon,\nduring which they should do something special having relation to him,\nwhich he should recount at the next sitting. The day was Saturday,\nand the next sitting was held on the following Monday, Mrs. Howard\n(who was visiting New York) and myself only being present. Mr.\nand Mrs. Pelham, who were staying at a hotel in New York, left Dr.\nThaw's house immediately after their sitting on Saturday morning,\nand did not enter it again. After Phinuit had said a few words at\nthe sitting on Monday, May 16th, I was sent out of the room, and\nthen G. P. took direct control of the voice and talked for some time\nwith Mrs. Howard. Almost immediately after my return G. P.\nstopped speaking and began to write. He first (in the writing)\nexpressed his desire to see Berwick soon, a friend of his whom he\nmentioned to the Howards at their first sitting (see p. 301), and I\nthen asked him what his father did on Saturday afternoon.\n\f314 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nI saw him take some notepaper and write an explanatory letter to Frank\nabout what I had said to him when I saw him in or on that day. [Phinuit\nsays: \" Do you understand ? \"] (Yes.) [Then followed some indecipherable\nwords, some of which resemble \" tt tout cas.\"]\nThe flowers which I saw mother put before my photo, she and father will\nunderstand . . .\n[The next sentence not written, but spelt out by Phinuit.] 1 saw them\ndo [patting] I saw mother put them under my picture on the afternoon of\nwhich he spoke to me to watch him.\n[Written.] In connection with this I saw them open my book and place\ntherein a picture of X. Y. That is all of importance that I saw them do.\nI saw you [Mrs. Howard] and saw father give you the roses.\n[Spoken by Phinuit.] He saw you take a picture\u2014that is after he had a\ntalk with his father. Then you went to some place to get a picture. (Of\nwhom 1)\n[Phinuit stumbled over a word sounding something like \" himself.\"]\n[Written.] Himself my myself. [Mrs. Howard asks which picture,\nshowing portraits, at one of which Phinuit says, \"That's it.\"] I mean the\none you got from the photographer. I saw you take it and hold it in your\nhands before you and talk to me. (What did I say to you 1 Did I speak\nto you ?) Yes, it but what you said was wholly mental. . . .\n[Phinuit speaks on behalf of G. P.] Ask Hodgson whether this is\nimportant to him or not. I am determined to [writing again] transfer to\nyou my thoughts, although it will have, to be done in this uncanny way.\n(Nevermind. That's all right. We understand, etc.) Good. I will move\nheaven and earth to explain these matters to you, Hodgson. [Phinuit\nspeaks.] You see I am not asleep. [Written.] I am wide awake, and I\nassure you I am ever ready to help you and give you things of importance\nin this work. [Phinuit speaks.] It was like Greek to him before he came\nhere. I could not believe this existence. [Written.] I am delighted to\nhave this opportunity of coming here to this life, so as to be able to prove\nmy experiences and existence here. Dear old Hodgson, I wish I could have\nknown you better in your life, but I understand you now, and the philosophy\nof my being taken out and (Didn't you go too soon ?) Not too soon, but it\nis my vocation to be able to explain these things to you and the rest of my\nfriends. (Does it do you harm ?) And it is all nonsense about its doing me\nharm, for it surely does no harm, and will help to enlighten the world.\nWhat think you, Hodgson ? (I agree entirely. I think it's the most\nimportant work in the world.) Oh, I am so glad your exalted brains are\nnot too pretentious to accept the real truth and philosophy of my coming\nand explaining to you these important things. (Now, George, we mustn't\nkeep the medium in trance too long.) Do not worry about her, she is\nhaving a good time, and I will do no harm. You know that too well.\n[Phinuit speaks.] He says he's not an idiot. (Oh, I know he's not an\nidiot, etc. )\n[Written.] I understand. You see I hear you. Now I will proceed\nwith my important conversation. Your material universe is very exacting,\nand it requires great practice and perseverance to do all I want to say to\nyou. . . .\n\fxxxni.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 315\nMrs. Howard informed me that all the statements about the\ncircumstances connected with herself were correct, and she left at\nonce to ascertain whether the statements concerning the doings of\nMr. and Mrs. Pelham on the Saturday afternoon were also correct. My\nimpression i is that Mrs. Howard was aware, from some knowledge\nwhich she obtained directly or by inference during a call upon the\nPelhams on the Saturday, that they had done something with flowers\nand photograph. The other matters mentioned were entirely unknown\nto her, though she might indeed have surmised, consciously or\nunconsciously, that Mr. Pelham would contemplate writing to Frank\nsuch an explanatory letter as was indicated. It appeared\\hat two of\nthe acts attributed to Mr. and Mrs. Pelham had been done as\ndescribed, nor were there any other test incidents, but the third, viz.,\nthe writing of a certain explanatory letter to Frank (brother of G. P.)\nhad not been actually carried out. Mr. Pelham had intended writing\nsuch a letter on the Saturday afternoon, and had consulted his wife\nabout the proposed contents, but had not found time to write. This\nexperiment again suggests that the supernormal knowledge [shown of\nour physical world by the communicators through Mrs. Piper is\nobtained indirectly and telepathically through the minds of living\npersons, rather than by a direct visual perception such as we enjoy.\nThere was no further opportunity for investigating G.P. at that\ntime, as Mrs. Piper was giving a series of sittings under the arrange\nment of Dr. A. B. Thaw, at that time living in New York, by whose\nspecial kindness I was enabled to make the appointments for the\nsittings of May 14th and 16th. However, G. P. rendered assistance\nat least by acting as amanuensis for other communicators at more than\none of the sittings which followed in May and June in New York, and\non May 29th talked at our request into a phonograph, to which\nunfortunately we trusted for a record of the conversation, but were\ndisappointed. (See Appendix IV., p. 563).\nWithin a few days after this Mrs. Piper gave one or two sittings\nto personal friends of her own who lived in the neighbourhood of\nBoston, and was then away in the country resting during the summer,\nnot resuming her sittings till the autumn. Special arrangements were\nthen made, owing to the generosity of one of our members, for having\na series of stenographically reported sittings which should be devoted\nto further inquiries concerning the G. P. personality. Mrs. Piper\nsuffered much from ill-health during the winter of 1892-3, the cause\nbeing some tumours, for the removal of which an operation was finally\nnecessary (see p. 479). This interfered to some extent with the\nsittings, of which, however, we were enabled to hold fourteen reported\ni See footnote p 304.\ny\n\f316 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nstenographically. Many other matters were referred to in these\nsittings besides those connected with G. P. I shall here refer only to\nsome of the more important incidents having relation to G.P.'s identity.\nThose which I give in brief will be found more in detail in Appendix\nI., together with some additional extracts and abridgments and\nexplanatory comments.\nThe sittings were held in the library of Mr. Howard's house, in\nBoston, in the evening. It was necessary, of course, to offer some\nexplanation to Mrs. Piper for our making such an arrangement, and I\ninformed her that we wished a special series of sittings for the purpose\nof getting statements from a communicator whom we had agreed to\ncall George. This, as a matter of fact, was his real first name, but'I\nthought it highly probable that it would be used by some of the sitters\nin Mrs. Piper's presence during her normal waking state. My own\nbelief is that Mrs. Piper was unaware till long afterwards that George\nwas any more than a pseudonym ; but, of course, for purposes of\nevidence it must be assumed that she knew the full real name and was\nthoroughly acquainted with the object of our inquiry.\nThe first sitting of the series was held on November 22nd, 1892.\nG. P., in his first writing, referred to his knowledge of the place, and\nasked Mr. Howard if he remembered how he, Mr. Howard, always\nknew just where to find certain books. G. P., living, and Mr. Howard\nhad frequently talked together there and had occasion to turn up\nreferences to one book or another, and G. P. had remarked several\ntimes on Mr. Howard's accurate knowledge of the location of books on\nhis shelves. G. P., later, using the voice, asked about the letter- that\nOrenberg wrote to Mr. Howard in regard to his \"passing out,\" and made\na remark which seemed to show a specific knowledge of its contents. It\nwas Orenberg who informed Mr. Howard of G. P.'s death, by telegram,\nfollowed by letter. G. P. then wrongly stated that his father was at\nthat minute writing a letter. He then said, \"Get me my hair.\" Since\nthe last sitting in the previous spring, Mrs. Pelham had sent Mrs.\nHoward some of G. P.'s baby hair. Mrs. Howard was not consciously\nthinking of this and had forgotten to bring it into the room. After\nreceiving it, G. P. said : \" Mother gave it to you. She had it a\nlong time.\"\nAt the next sitting, November 28th, Mrs. Howard's eldest daughter,\nKatharine, was present part of the time. She was greeted, naturally,\nby G. P., who used the voice, and later asked her about her violin, and\nsaid it was horrible to hear her playing it. G. P., living, was annoyed\nby her practising it when she was a little child. He asked after a\nspecial picture which he had owned, and was told that it had been torn\nup after his death. Mrs. Howard presented a picture for recognition, and\nG. P. placed it on top of the head, and said it was their summer house,\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 317\nbut that he had forgotten the name of the town.i Such a temporary\nforgetfulness, it may be observed, would not be unnatural in anyone of\nus. It was some years since the Howards had lived there in the\nsummer, and they had since spent their summers in another country\nplace, X -ville, to which G. P., later, spontaneously referred, not at\nthe moment remembering the first part of the name, \" Then you\nbought a place at some ville.\" When Mrs. Howard mentioned the\nname of the first country place, D , G. P. at once correctly referred\nto the little brick house and the grape-vine, and asked specially where\nthe little out-house was. This is noteworthy, as the \"little brick hen\nhouse,\" Mrs. Howard notes, \"just did not come into the picture.\" On\nthe other hand, it may be said that a country house is sure to have an\nout-house. Further, Mrs. Howard handed another picture to G. P., but\nhe at once said that he had no recollection of it, and, as a matter of\nfact, G. P., living, had never seen it. Less evidential were the\nfollowing : That his father had had a book printed (his father had\nprinted G. P.'s poems in a small volume, which appeared just before\nthe first sitting of this series) ; that a basket presented was his (it had\nbeen given by him as a Christmas present) ; that a paper presented by\nMrs. Howard was written to him by her that morning (it was a poem\non death, written that morning with G. P. in mind, but no reference to\nG. P. in it) ; that a letter presented was written by hims\"elf a long time\nago (correct) ; that a newspaper presented by Mr. Howard had been sent\nto him by Orenberg (it was a foreign newspaper, still in its wrapper,\nthat Mr. Howard had received from Orenberg that morning, and that\nhe had at once hidden away without telling any one of it ; but G. P.\nfirst mentioned the name of John Hart in connection with it, both\nJohn Hart and Orenberg being in Europe). More personal was the\ni I may say here that on different occasions in past years I examine:! Mrs. Piper's\neyeballs during the trance, and always found them rolled up, and my conviction is\nthat the trance-personalities do not obtain any information by tho ordinary process of\nvision. It may be assumed, however, that Mrs Piper rolled her eyeballs up\ntemporarily when she supposed that an examination was about to be made, and even\nthat she possesses, during the trance state, some hyperesthesia of ordinary vision.\nWhen the hand and voice are being used by the same \" control,\" and an article is given\nto the hand, it must be assumed, in the abseDce of indications to the contrary in the\nrecord, that the article may have come within the field of her vision. When the hand\nis being used independently of the voice, the head is invaribly turned away from the\nhand, and under ordinary circumstances (unless the head is lifted and turned and\nsustained by the sitter) the hand on the table and any articles presented to it there are\noutside the field of vision. With the development of the automatic writing Phinuit\nseemed to lost? the ability to support the upper part of the body, which tends to sag\nforward and downward with the head turned to the left. In tho early stages of the\ndevelopment of the automatic writing it was usually supported to a certain extent in\nthat position by one of the persons present. Later on cushions were arranged on a\ntable in front and somewhat to the left of Mrs. Piper, and the head has usually\nbeen allowed to rest more or less buried in these cushions, but still turned to the left.\nY 2\n\f318 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nremark to Mr. Howard in connection with James Peirce : \" When you\ndine with him, think of me.\" G. P., living, occasionally dined at the\nhouse of Mr. Peirce in company with Mr. Howard. The suggestion to\nMr. Howard, \" Get the long pipe and smoke,\" may be regarded by\nsome persons as a guess. It was, however, well known to G. P., living,\nthat Mr. Howard was in the habit of smoking a long pipe in the\nevening.\nAt the third sitting there was little that can be quoted as of\nevidential nature, most of the time being occupied by questions\nconcerning G. P.'s new state of existence. Reference was made to\nPlato's views in connection with a discussion which I had with G.P.\nliving, in a way which indicated a knowledge of the specific issues\ninvolved in that discussion. (See p. 363.) Another daughter of the\nHowards, Evelyn, was present during part of the sitting. G. P. living\nused to tease her a good deal, and one of the first things said was \" I\nwon't tantalise you now,\" and afterwards again, \" I used to torment\nEvelyn ; but she will forgive me, I know.\" Duiing the last part of\nG. P.'s conversation with Evelyn the other sitters were sent away.\nG. P. wished, as it appeared, to give her some ethical advice. Evelyn\ngave a brief account of the conversation immediately after the sitting,\nfrom which it appeared that G. P. asked if she remembered the little\nbook which he'had given her and had written her name in. This was\ncorrect. Evelyn had been looking at it a few days before. G. P. wrote\nsome words and told her to compare them with his writing in the little\nbook. There was no special likeness between the two writings. (For\nremarks on the handwriting see Part II. of this Report.)\nPart of the fourth sitting was occupied by G. P. in explaining, in\nreply to questions by R.H., some of the obscurities in his conversation\nof the previous sitting concerning his new existence.\nDuring this, G. P. made some side remarks, as it were, to Mrs.\nHoward, asking her about Mrs. Warner (who was known to G. P.\nliving, and had visited Mrs. Howard that morning and talked with\nher on the G. P. matter) and referring to \" another friend I used to\nknow, a Mrs. Easton,\" Mrs. Howard for a moment not thinking who\nwas meant, and then remembering that Mrs. Easton was the sister of\nJames Peirce (see p. 305). In the latter part of the sitting Mr.\nMarte, an old friend of G. P., came into the room with Mr. Howard.\nG. P. had been using the voice, but apparently was unable to continue\ndoing so, and wrote a little. There was some confusion, apparently, in\nwhat followed. (See the detailed account, p. 420.) Mr. Marte was\nrecognised, and the subject in which he was specially interested was\nreferred to by G. P.; the excitement in the hand and the remarks made\nby G. P. were quite in keeping with the relations which had existed\nbetween Mr. Marte and G. P. living. But Mr. Marte is so well known\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 319\nboth as an author and a lecturer that any mere knowledge of his name\nand work cannot be regarded as having any evidential value.\nThe fifth sitting was largely occupied with other inquiries and\ncommunications. Mr. Howard was not present and Phinuit at the\nbeginning of the sitting said that G. P. had gone to find him. Later\non G. P. wrote that Mr. Howard had gone to see his friend Fenton.\nThis was correct. Fenton lived in a town [in the country. In reply\nto a question as to what Howard and Fenton were talking about,\nG. P.'s statement \" about this very subject and about me,\" although\ncorrect, cannot of course count for anything evidentially, as it was so\nprobable, but the statement made earlier in the sitting, at 9.10 p.m.,\nthat Mr. Howard was reading, or was a few minutes previously, and\nwhich was afterwards ascertained to be correct, perhaps counts for a\nlittle in the direction of telsesthesia. G. P. also said that he had\nsomething to tell Orenberg that would surprise him, and told us to ask\nOrenberg \" what he wanted to destroy my papers and letters which I\ngave him,\" the fact being that Orenberg had helped Mr. Pelham to\ndestroy G. P.'s letters after his death. This, however, was known to\nthe Howards.\nIn connection with this I may refer to an incident that occurred\nmuch later, at a sitting with Mr. A. B., on April 17th, 1894, who\ninquired whether G. P. knew what he, Mr. A. B., had done on G. P.'s\nbehalf after the latter's death. G. P. stated correctly that A. B. had\ndestroyed some \" cigar checks \" which he had left about. These had\napparently been returned to G. P. living, after his payment of Club\nbills, and after G. P.'s death Mr. A. B. had found them and destroyed\nthem.\nDuring the sixth sitting, December 7th, G. P. asked for his\nmother's letter. A letter from his mother had been received by\nMr. Howard, and this was put into the hand. As I have explained\nelsewhere (p. 317 footnote) when the hand is \" controlled \" apparently\nindependently of the head, the head sags down and to the left in\nsuch a position that the hand is outside of the field of vision,\nand there is no possibility of Mrs. Piper's reading by any normal\nprocess a letter given to the hand under those circumstances. After\nhandling the letter G. P. stated correctly^that his father was not well,\nthat his mother said in the letter that she was going somewhere, that\nthe house and property in N. Y. were to be disposed of. These\nmatters were mentioned in the letter and also known to Mrs. Howard\nwho had read it. When asked to mention the name of the place he\nwrote Potomac. This was not correct. The name of the place had\nbeen mentioned correctly by G.P. at a previous sitting (p. 302).\nI think it improbable that there was here any clairvoyant reading\nof the letter, but that the information was obtained possibly from the\n\f320 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nmind of Mrs. Pelham by some process akin to tehesthesia, or perhaps\nfrom the mind of Mrs. Howard by direct thought-transference. In the\nninth sitting of this series, December 1 9th, when G. P. was using the\nvoice, a letter written by Mr. Pelham was given to him by Mrs.\nHoward. The Howards supposed that it was a letter in which\nMr. Pelham referred to G. P.'s manifestation at the sittings and his\nown interest in hearing of them. It was not, however, this letter, but\nanother one from Mr. Pelham entirely on business matters, which\nMrs. Howard had given. Yet G. P. referred to the character of the\ncontents of the letter which directly concerned himself, saying that his\nfather \" believes that I exist. He was pained, but he is no longer pained,\nbecause he feels that I exist.\" This was right, but obviously was not\nobtained by any reading of the words of the letter which had been\ngiven. It may be said that G. P. merely made a not unlikely guess,\nespecially since he had been told that there was something in the\nletter that would please him ; but if any supernormal knowledge was\nshown it must apparently be ascribable either to some direct apprecia\ntion of his father's state of mind or to thought-transference from the\nHowards.\nTo return to the sitting of December 7th.\nMr. Howard asked what it was G. P. referred to at the previous\nsitting in connection with Orenberg, and the reply was that Orenberg\nhad written to Mr. Howard and wanted to know what G. P. had to say.\nThis, though true, would have been more interesting, as Mrs. Howard\nsuggested at the time, if told before the letter had been received.\nAt the next sitting, December 9th, where Mr. Marte was again\npresent, and asked some questions on philosophical subjects, there was\nmuch confusion. Both Phinuit and G. P. complained at the begin\nning of the sitting that the \" light \" was weak, apparently owing to\nMrs. Piper's increasing ill-health (which eventually led to an operation\nin March, 1893). Nearly all the following sittings wore much shorter,\nand contain less characteristic matter. Mr. Marte inquired inter alia\nconcerning a book on the One or Many, but G. P. showed no know\nledge of it. This apparently was the name proposed by G. P. living in\nconversation with Mr. Marte, for a book written by G. P. It existed\nonly in M.S. form. It is at least doubtful whether G. P. living thought\nof it under the title proposed by him to Mr. Marte.\nLater on in my Report I shall mention some other incidents in\nconnection with the series of sittings to which I am now referring,\nbut 1 give here portions of the account of the eleventh sitting of the\nseries, December 22nd, 1892 (see p. 438).\nAt the sitting a personal incident was correctly mentioned by G. P., in\nconnection with a particular occasion of one of his meetings with the Howards.\nIn reply to inquiries he specified correctly that it was in N. Y., but was\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 321\nunable to give the precise circumstances ; gave names of two common New\nYork friends incorrectly in reply to the query where the dinner was when\nthey met. . . . Arthur C was referred to as a friend, and the town\nPortsmouth was also mentioned, near which Mr. C lives in the summer.\n[Correct.]\nIt was during this sitting that perhaps the most dramatic incident\nof the whole series occurred. Mrs. Howard was supporting Mrs. Piper's\nhead, I was following the writing, and Mr. Howard was sitting some\ndistance away smoking a long pipe, when the following conversation\nensued.\nG. P. : \" Now, what will I do for you ? \"\nR. H. : Well, George, is there anything that you would like to give us,\nany special message that you thought it would be desirable for us to have, or\nanything about philosophy, we should be glad to have that !\nMr. Howard : Well, George, before you go to philosophy\u2014you know my\nopinion of philosophy\u2014\nG. P. : \"It is rather crude, to be sure.\"\nMr. Howard : Tell me something, you must be able to recall certain\nthings that you and I know ; now, it makes no difference what the thing is ;\ntell me something that you and I alone know. I ask you because several\nthings I have asked you, you have failed to get hold of.\nG. P. : \" Why did you not ask me this before 1 \"\nMr. Howard : Because I did not have occasion to.\nG. P. : \" What do you mean, Jim ? \"\nMr. Howard : I mean, tell me something that you and I alone know,\nsomething in our past that you and I alone know.\nG. P. : \" Do you doubt me, dear old fellow ? \"\nMr. Howard : I simply want something \u2014you have failed to answer\ncertain questions that I have asked\u2014now I want you to give me the\nequivalent of the answers to those questions in your own terms.\nG. P. : \" What were they 1 \"\nMr. Howard : The questions wore about where we dined, and that you\ndid not remember [see above, pp. 320-1] ; now tell mo something you do\nremember.\nG. P. : \" Oh, you mean now.\"\nMr. Howard : Tell me something now that you remember that happened\nbefore.\nG. P. : \"Well, I will. About Arthur [see above] ought to be a test.\nHow absurd . . . what does Jim mean ? Do you mean our conversation\non different things, or do you mean something else 1 \"\nMr. Howard : I moan anything. Now, George, listen for a moment,\nlisten, listen.\nG. P. : \"I know\"\nMr. Howard : I mean that we spent a great many summers and winters\ntogether, and talked on a great many things and had a great many views in\ncommon, went through a great many experiences together. Now [G. P.\ncommencing to write] hold on a minute.\nG. P. : \" You used to talk to me about , . .\"\n\f322 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nThe transcription here of the words written by G. P. conveys, of\ncourse, no proper impression of the actual circumstances ; the inert\nmass of the upper part of Mrs. Piper's body turned away from the\nright arm, and sagging down, as it were, limp and lifeless over Mrs.\nHoward's shoulder, but the right arm, and especially hand, mobile,\nintelligent, deprecatory, then impatient and fierce in the persistence\nof the writing which followed, which contains too much of the\npersonal element in G. P.'s life to be reproduced here. Several state\nments were read by me, and assented to by Mr. Howard, and then was\nwritten \" private \" and the hand gently pushed me away. I retired to\nthe other side of the room, and Mr. Howard took my place close to\nthe hand where he could read the writing. He did not, of course,\nread it aloud, and it was too private for my perusal. The hand, as it\nreached the end of each sheet, tore it off from the block book, and\nthrust it wildly at Mr. Howard, and then continued writing. The\ncircumstances narrated, Mr. Howard informed me, contained precisely\nthe kind of test for which he had asked, and he said that he was\n\" perfectly satisfied, perfectly.\" After this incident there was some\nfurther conversation with references to the past that seemed specially\nnatural as coming from G. P.\n\"About my work, yes, my writing, I used to help you in my work, and\nyou ditto. . . . Jim, I am dull in this sphere about some things, but\nyou will forgive me, won't you ? . . . but like as when in the body\nsometimes we can't always recall everything in a moment, can we, Jim, dear\nold fellow ? . . . God bless you, Jim, and many thanks. You often\ngave me courage when I used to get depressed. You know how you especi\nally used to firo at me sometimes, but I understood it all, did I not, old\nfellow 1 . and I used to get tremendously down at the heel some\ntimes, but I am all right now, and, Jim, you can never know how much I\nlove you and how much I delight in coming back and telling you all this . . .\nWhen I found I actually lived again I jumped for joy, and my first thought\nwas to find you and Mary. And, thank the Infinite, here I am, old fellow,\nliving and well . . .\"\nCharacteristic also of the living G. P. was the remark made to me\nlater, apparently with reference to the circumstances of the private\nstatements :\n\" Thanks, Hodgson, for your kind help and reserved manners, also\npatience in this difficult matter.\"\nAs I have already said, Mrs. Piper suffered much from ill-health at\nthis time, and the last sitting given before her operation was held on\nMarch 12th, 1893. This sitting was held primarily that the doctors\nwho were to operate might have some experience of Mrs. Piper's trance\nin case any unusual feature might develop while she was undergoing\nthe operation under ether: G. P. wrote only a few words of advice,\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 323\nsaying that he came \" just one minute to speak to you. I understand\neverything now. I will wait for you and be with you all I can in the\nmeantime.\"\nPhinuit gave a description of Mrs. Piper's trouble in substantial\nagreement with the surgeon's diagnosis, and verified at the operation,\nwhich was performed successfully, and without the occurrence of any\nabnormal circumstances (see p. 479), on March 14th, 1893. The first\nsittings which Mrs. Piper gave afterwards were two in September, to\nMr. M., a previous sitter. G. P. appeared at the first of these and\nsent some brief messages to friends, and rendered assistance almost\nconstantly at later sittings, until the assumption of the control of\nMrs. Piper's trance by persons who claimed to have been the chief\ncommunicators through the late Rev. W. Stainton Moses (see p. 408).\nReferences to G.P.'s presence at sittings will be found in various\naccounts given in the Appendices to both Parts of this Report. Very\nfrequently he professed to act as amanuensis for deceased friends or\nrelatives of sitters who were strangers to him, and at other times he is\nrepresented as offering advice and explanations to those trying to\ncommunicate directly themselves by writing with Mrs. Piper's hand.\nHe stated about the latter part of 1893 that he was going \" farther\naway \" and would not be so available for tests, but that he would\ncontinue to assist as far as possible, and help any \"stragglers\" to\ncommunicate. The Howards had several more sittings, chiefly of a\npersonal sort, before they left for Europe in the spring of 1894, and\nthey also arranged sittings for several persons known to G. P. living,\nall of whom were recognised with complete appropriateness by the\nG. P. communicating.\nThis recognition of friends appears to me to be of great importance\nevidentially, not only because it indicates some supernormal know\nledge, but because, when all the circumstances are taken into\nconsideration, they seem to point, in G. P.'s case, to an independent\nintelligence drawing upon its own recollections. I have more or less\ncomplete records of nearly all the sittings given by Mrs. Piper since the\nfirst appearance of G. P. Of most of the remaining few I received\naccounts shortly after the sitting. At the outset of the communications\nfrom G. P., he was particularly anxious\u2014I describe it as it seemed\nprimd facie to be \u2014to see the Howards and his father and mother for\nthe purpose of clearing up some private matters. After the sitting of\nMr. Hart, when G. P. expected soon to see the Howards, he manifested\nhis presence at the following sittings which I attended until he saw the\nHowards. During this interval Mr. Vance had a sitting, and although\nhe made an appropriate inquiry of Mr. Vance and answered correctly a\ntest question, the incident was, as it were, casual ; he did not stay ; he-\nwas not there to see Mr. Vance, and Mr. Vance was not there to see\n\f324 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nhim (see p. 457). Before the sitting of Mr. Peirce (see p. 305), Mrs.\nWarner, known to G. P., had a sitting on April 25th, 1892, at which\nG. P.'s presence was not announced at all, as far as appears from my\nrecord of the sitting, which is, however, not complete, as I was out of\nthe room part of the time. Mrs. Warner did not go to see G. P. She\nhad taken a chain that had been worn by Madame Blavatsky and a cap\nthat had been worn by Walt Whitman, about which she desired to\ninquire.i\nOn April 28th occurred the incident which I have described on\np. 305, when G. P. said that he knew the sitter, and I asked for the\nsitter's name, which was given correctly by Mrs. Piper in the \" sub\nliminal\" stage of her recovery from trance. On April 29th came the\nexplanation from G. P. about the difficulties involved in the act of com\nmunicating, and I believe that I emphasised the importance of his always\nrecognising an}r friend of his who happened to attend a sitting, no\nmatter what other communications he might wish to make. Prom that\ntime onwards he has never failed to announce himself to, and to recog\nnise, with the appropriate emotionaland intellectual relations, the sitters\nwho were known to G. P., living, and to give their names in one form\nor another, with one exception. This exception, however, seems to me\nto be as noteworthy as if the recognition had been complete. It is the\ncase of Miss Warner, who had her first sitting on January 6th, 1897.\nG. P. wrote a little near the beginning of the sitting, but seemed to\nhave only some vague remembrance of the sitter, who, nevertheless,\nwas given a good deal of correct information by Phinuit and others\nconcerning the members of her family and friends. At the end of the\nsitting G. P. wrote a few words to ask how Rogers was getting on, and\nsending regards to him. At Miss Warner's second sitting, held the\nnext day, Januaiy 7th, G. P. wrote part of the time, and asked the\nsitter if she knew Orenberg. She did not. The sitter mentioned at\nthe previous sitting that she remembered G. P., but that he knew her\nmother better, and at this second sitting G. P. asked who she was. I\nsaid her mother was a special friend of Mrs. Howard.\nI do not think I ever knew you very well. (Very little. You used to\ncome and see my mother.) I heard of you, I suppose. (I saw you several\ntimes. You used to come with Mr. Rogers.) Yes, I remembered about Mr.\nRogers when I saw you before. (Yes, you spoke of him.) Yes, but I cannot\nseem to place you. I long to place all of my friends, and could do so before\nI had been gone so long. You see I am farther away. . . . I do not\nrecall your face. You must have changed. . . (R. H. : Do you\nremember Mrs. Warner ?) [Excitement in hand] Of course, oh, very well.\nFor pity sake are you her little daughter ? (Yes.) By Jove, how you have\ngrown. \u2022 . . . I thought so much of your mother, a charming woman.\nMrs Warner waa later on mentioned by (!. P. See p. 318.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 325\n(She always enjoyed seeing you, I know.) Our tastes were similar (about\nwriting ? ) Yes. Do you know Marte at all ? (I've met him once or twice.)\nYour mother knows. Ask her if she remembers the book I gave her to read.\n(I will.) And ask her if she still remembers me and the long talks wo used\nto have at the home evenings. (I know she does.) I wish I could have\nknown you better, it would have been so nice to have recalled the past. (I\nwas a little girl.)\nNow it should be remembered that these sittings were held five\nyears after the death of G. P., and that G. P. had not seen Miss Warner\nfor at least three or four years before his death, that she was only a\nlittle girl when he had last seen her, that she had not been, so to say,\na, special friend of his, and that she had, indeed, changed very much in\nthe intervening eight or nine years.\nThis non-recognition, then, by G. P. is a perfectly natural circum\nstance, and when we compare the details given by Phinuit of Miss\nWarner's family, and the incidents mentioned by Hart, through\nG. P. writing, in connection with her brother (see p. 356),\u2014incidents,\nmoreover, which were unknown to the sitters,\u2014and when we\nremember also that both Miss Warner and myself were fully aware of\nher name and of the fact that she had known G. P., the very non-\nrecognition seems to me to afford an argument in favour of the\nindependent existence of G. P., as contrasted with the conception of\nsome secondary personality depending for its knowledge upon the minds\nof living persons.\nSeveral other incidents point in the same direction. Thus, at the\nsitting of December 22nd, 1892 (p. 321), G. P. referred to his friend,\nArthur C , and gave the name of the town near which Mr. C\nlives in the summer. In the following year Mr. C.'s brother, also known\nto G. P., died, and at the first sitting given by Mrs. Piper afterwards,\nG. P. sent a message from this brother to Mr. C. On November 18th,\n1893, Mr. C. had his first sitting with Mrs. Piper. G.P. was, apparently,\nnot present at first, but afterwards wrote a little, said that he knew\nthe sitter well, and a name beginning with C was written, but the rest\nwas not clearly legible. He said there was much confusion, and he\nwould try to clear it up. The confusion was apparently caused, in part\nat least, by the attempt of two previous communicators to send\nmessages to their friends, and I had encouraged both of them ; one of\nthem because he had given the name of Harry, which was also the\nname of Mr. C.'s brother, and the other because the first three letters\nof his surname were also those of Mr. C.'s. G. P. wrote that the\n\" light \" was not so good as it was sometimes, and he apparently\nmistook me at first for Howard. But at the close of the sitting,\nthere was some strong writing purporting to come from the sitter's\nbrother, giving in full his three names and also the sitter's first name,\n\f326 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\naddressing him as his brother, etc. Further details are given in\nAppendix III. (See p. 483). \"What I suppose happened was that\nG. P. saw what was needed, and sent tlte brother.\nAgain, there was a curious recognition of the Rev. Minot J. Savage,\non March 21st, 1894. After G. P. began to write, I asked :\u2014\n\"(Do you know this gentleman, M. J. Savage ?) [Mr. Savage had had\nsittings years previously and was known to Mrs. Piper.] Yes. I do. How\nare you, sir 1 Speak to me. This is too delightful. I am so pleased to see\nyour face again. (You remember meeting him in the body ?) Oh yes, well,\nI do well.\"\nI supposed at the time that Mr. Savage had never met G. P., and\nthat was Mr. Savage's opinion also, and we both expected the answer\n\" No \" to my first question, and I at least was further surprised at the\namount of feeling indicated both by the words written and the excite\nment of the hand. Very soon, however, during the sitting, I recalled\nwhat I had temporarily forgotten, viz., that when G. P. had his sitting\nwith Mrs. Piper on March 7th, 1888 (see p. 295), the Rev. M. J.\nSavage was the Committee Officer, who was present officially at the\nsitting. But G. P. was not introduced under his real name to Mr\nSavage, and it was specially recorded in the report of the sitting that\nhe was unknown to Mr. Savage. It is probable and, I think, almost\ncertain that later Mr. Savage may have heard or read in MS. (the\nreports were never published) what the name of the sitter was, but he\nhad no recollection of having done so. I should probably myself have\nforgotten, beyond any normal recollection, the circumstances of their\nhaving met, had I not had occasion to consult all my documents\nconcerning Mrs. Piper in connection with my previous Report and so\nrefresh my memory of the 1888 sitting. The excitement on March 21st,\n1894, seems thus to be quite natural, if we regard it as connected in\nG. P.'s mind with the remembrance of his only other (so far as known)\nmeeting with Mr. Savage, when he, G. P., was in the position of the\nsitter, whereas now he was in the position of communicator.\nParenthetically the incident is instructive about mistakes which\nmay easily be, and doubtless frequently are, made, and we must admit\nan indefinite margin for error on the part both of living witnesses and\nof alleged communicators. Thus the communicating G. P. might have\nfailed to recognise Mr. Savage. Both Mr. Savage and I would,\nprobably, have regarded this as correct, and later on, either myself or\nsomeone else might have discovered that G. P., when living, had met\nMr. Savage, and the incident would have been considered as going to\nestablish that the failure at recognition was due to the ignorance of\nMr. Savage and myself, and that the knowledge of the \" automatic\nwriting \" was bounded by the conscious knowledge of the sitters. Or,\nG. P. might have forgotten Mr. Savage, but Mr. Savage may have\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 327\nremembered G. P.'s name as that of the sitter whom he accompanied.\nOr again, G. P. might have actually met Mr. Savage under other\ncircumstances which were unverifiable, and his statement that he knew\nMr. Savage might well have been regarded as an error.i\nThis incident leads to another curious one that occurred at the\nsitting of Januaiy 30th, 1893. In this case G. P. stated that he\nremembered the sitter not \" by name, but only by face,\" and he\napparently associated his memory chiefly with Marte and with a club.\nThis partial recognition was entirely contrary to the expectation of the\nsitter or myself. But the sitter and G. P. were both members of the\nUniversity Club in New York, and the sitter attended a reception to\nMarte in New York during the time of G. P.'s residence there, and it\ncannot be regarded as improbable that G. P. was also present,\nconsidering his friendship and admiration for Marte. (See Appendix I,\np. 440).\nFinally, on November 21st, 1896, G. P. wrote, near the beginning\nof the sitting, after starting to make a statement to me concerning\nanother matter : \u2014\n[Hand gestures towards Mrs. M.] By Jove, H. W^io is this ? I have\nmet her before. (Have you ?) Yes. I wish to speak to her. Why, why,\nwhy, Mrs. M . I am George Pelham, and I have seen you in the body.\nYes, I met you at Mrs. [pause] S . (Mrs. M. : I don't think I was ever\nat Mrs. S ). Mrs. Somebody's. Wait a moment until I just think.\nYes. I heard you read once at a friend's house, and yet at this moment I\ncannot recall just where it was.\nMrs. M. did not regard it as improbable that G. P. had met her,\nand here again it is much more likely that he should remember her\nthan that she should remember him. I do not, therefore, regard this\nas a mistake of G. P.'s. Taken in connection with the case mentioned\ni There is yet another incident at this same sitting of March 21st, 1894, which\nillustrates apparently the recollection by another person, and as it concerns Mr.\nSavage also I quote the account of it hero. The \" E \" control (see Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII , p. 44) was anxious to write a few words concerning tho course of an experiment\nI was trying and I introduced the sitter :\u2014\n\"(This is Minot J. Savage) delighted to see you\u2014I used to read about\u2014Light\u2014\nyou I think . . . do . . . (Vou mean in the magazine Light ? Yes, very\nprobably.)\"\nHere then was no claim at recognition of Mr. Savage, but a remembrance\napparently of having read about him in the spiritualistic periodical Light. Now it\nis highly probable that the living \" E ,\" an Englishman, deeply interested in psychical\nresearch, had seen references to Mr. Savage in Lujht, and I incline to think highly\nimprobable that he had seen references to Mr. Savage anywhere else. The very\nopposite of this would be true of G. P., who not improbably never saw a copy of\nLight, and to whom the name of Mr. Savage was doubtless known with various\nassociations, so that he was much more likely to remember Mr. Savage than Mr.\nSavage to remember him, and the evidential value of the incident consists in the\nemphatic claim that 6. P. made that he had met Mr. Savage, accompanied by the\nexcitement shown.\n\f328 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nimmediately above, and with the case of Mr. Savage, it seems to me\non the whole to strengthen the presumption that we are here dealing\nwith an intelligence whose memory is independent of the conceptions\nof the sitters. In no other case has G. P. claimed any personal\nacquaintance with a sitter to whom G. P. living was unknown ; and in\nall other cases where he was known the recognition was clear and full,\nand accompanied by an appreciation of the relations which subsisted\nbetween G. P. living and the sitters. Omitting the case of Mrs.\nWarner, when G. P. did not profess to be present, and which occurred\nbefore he started, so to speak, upon his work of assistance, and was\nspecially requested to identify his friends,\u2014and the cases of Miss\nWarner and Mrs. M., both of which, in my opinion, strengthen the\npresumption of an independent communicating intelligence,\u2014there\nare thirty cases of true recognition out of at least one hundred and\nfifty persons who have had sittings with Mrs. Piper since the first\nappearance of G. P., and no case of false recognition.i\nOther friends of G. P., moreover, have been referred to, living and\ndead, besides those who have had sittings, and always with an\nappreciation prope^ to G. P. living. As I have suggested above, there\nhave been indications that G. P. was almost invariably present at\nsittings during the five years following his first appearance in March,\n1892, frequently acting as amanuensis for other communicators, or\nsending brief messages to his friends, or offering some explanations to\nmyself. Most of these communications are of a personal nature and\ncannot be regarded as evidential from the ordinary point of view ; but\nthe continual manifestation of this personality,\u2014so different from\nPhinuit or other communicators,\u2014with its own reservoir of memories,\nwith its swift appreciation of any reference to friends of G. P., with its\n\" give and take \" in little incidental conversations with myself, has\nhelped largely in producing a conviction of the actual presence of the\nG. P. personality, which it would be quite impossible to impart by any\nmere enumeration of verifiable statements. It will hardly, however,\nbe regarded as surprising that the most impressive manifestations are\nat the same time the most subtle and the least communicable.\nI may now give a brief summary of the kinds of evidence which I\nhave illustrated in some detail in the foregoing pages.\nOn the first appearance of the communicating G. P. to Mr. Hart in\nMarch, 1892, he gave not only his own name and that of the sitter, but\ni The above estimate includes the Howard family (five) and myself. Twenty-one\npersons were residents of Boston (or vicinity), five were New York residents who had\nsittings in New York amon\u00abj various other persons unknown to G. P., two were New\nYork residents who had sittings in Boston (or vicinity), and two (Mr. and Mrs.\nPelham, the only relatives of G. P. who had sittings) were residents of Washington\nwho had a sitting in New Yolk.\n\fxxxiii.] Obseivations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 329\nalso the names of several of their most intimate common friends, and\nreferred specifically to the most important private matters connected\nwith them. At the same sitting reference was made to other incidents\nunknown to the sitters, such as the account of Mrs. Pelham's taking\nthe studs from the body of G. P. and giving them to Mr. Pelham to be\nsent to Mr. Hart, and the reproduction of a notable remembrance of n\nconversation which G. P. living had with Katharine, the daughter of\nhis most intimate friends, the Howards. These were primary examples\nof two kinds of knowledge concerning matters unknown to the sitters,\nof which various other instances were afterwards given ; knowledge of\nevents connected with G. P. which had occurred since his death, and\nknowledge of special memories pertaining to the G. P. personality\nbefore death. A week later, at the sitting of Mr. Vance, he made an\nappropriate inquiry after the sitter's son, and in reply to inquiries\nrightly specified that the sitter's son had been at college with him, and\nfurther correctly gave a correct description of the sitter's summer\nhome as the place of a special visit. This, again, was paralleled\nby many later instances where appropriate inquiries were made and\nremembrances recalled concerning other personal friends of G. P.\nNearly two weeks later came his most intimate friends the Howards,\nand to these, using the voice directly, he showed such a fulness\nof private remembrance and specific knowledge and characteristic\nintellectual and emotional quality pertaining to G. P. that, though they\nhad previously taken no interest in any branch of psychical research,\nthey were unable to resist the conviction that they were actually\nconversing with their old friend G. P. And this conviction was\nstrengthened by their later experiences. Not least important, at that\ntime, was his anxiety about the disposal of a certain book and about\ncertain specified letters which concern matters too private for publica\ntion. He was particularly desirous of convincing his father, who\nlived in \"Washington, that it was indeed G. P. who was communicating,\nand he soon afterwards stated that his father had taken his photo\ngraph to be copied, as was the case, though Mr. Pelham had not\ninformed even his wife of this fact. Later on he reproduced a series\nof incidents, unknown to the sitters, in which Mrs. Howard had been\nengaged in her own home. Later still, at a sitting with his father and\nmother in New York, a further intimate knowledge was shown of\nprivate family circumstances, and at the following sitting, at which\nhis father and mother were not present, he gave the details of\ncertain private actions which they had done in the interim. At\ntheir sitting, and at various sittings of the Howards, appropriate\ncomments were made concerning different articles presented which had\nbelonged to G. P. living, or had been familiar to him ; he inquired\n\"after other personal articles which were not presented at the sittings,\n\f330 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nand showed intimate and detailed recollections of incidents in\nconnection with them. In points connected with the recognition of\narticles with their related associations of a personal sort, the G. P.\ncommunicating, so far as I know, has never failed. Nor has he failed\nin the recognition of personal friends. I may say generally that out\nof a large number of sitters who went as strangers to Mrs. Piper, the\ncommunicating G. P. has picked out the friends of G. P. living,\nprecisely as the G. P. living might have been expected to do, and has\nexhibited memories in connection with these and other friends which\nare such as would naturally be associated as part of the G. P. person\nality, which certainly do not suggest in themselves that they originate\notherwise, and which are accompanied by the emotional relations\nwhich were connected with such friends in the mind of G. P. living.\nAt one of his early communications G. P. expressly undertook the\ntask of rendering all the assistance in his power towards establishing\nthe continued existence of himself and other communicators, in\npursuance of a promise of which he himself reminded me, made some\ntwo years or more before his death, that if he died before me and\nfound himself \" still existing,\" he would devote himself to prove the\nfact, and in the persistence of his endeavour to overcome the difficulties\nin communicating as far as possible, in his constant readiness\nto act as amanuensis at the sittings, in the effect which he has\nproduced by his counsels, to myself as investigator, and to numerous\nother sitters and communicators, he has, in so far as I can form\na judgment in a problem so complex and still presenting so much\nobscurity, displayed all the keenness and pertinacity which were\neminently characteristic of G. P. living.\nFinally, the manifestations of this G. P. communicating have not\nbeen of a fitful and spasmodic nature, they have exhibited the marks\nof a continuous living and persistent personality, manifesting itself\nthrough a course of years, and showing the same characteristics of an\nindependent intelligence whether friends of G. P. were present at the\nsittings or not. I learned of various cases where in my absence active\nassistance was rendered by G. P. to sitters who had never previously\nheard of him, and from time to time he would make brief pertinent\nreference to matters with which G. P. living was acquainted, though I\nwas not, and sometimes in ways which indicated that he could to some\nextent see what was happening in our world to persons in whose welfare\nG. P. living would have been specially interested.\nThus the occasional references to his father and mother, and\nbrother and sister, and a few of his most intimate friends living, were\nof the kind that might be expected to come from the G. P. personality,\nand sometimes were of direct evidential value otherwise, though it is\nonly in their indirectly evidential nature that I refer to them here.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 331\nIn all such personal references the G. P. communicating has shown\nthe remembrances and the continued interest that we should expect to\nfind in the independent intelligence of the real persisting G. P.\u2014\nso far at least as I have been able to ascertain\u2014and in ways\ntoo complicated and private for any but two or three of his nearest and\ndearest friends to know or appreciate. Up to the last series of\nsittings which I had with Mrs. Piper, (1896-7) in a sitting which\nEvelyn Howard had in November, 1896, and in a sitting which Mrs.\nHoward (just then returned to America after between three and\nfour years' absence in Europe) had since my departure from Boston in\nSeptember, 1897, the same persistent personality has manifested itself,\nand what change has been discernible is a change not of any process\nof disintegration, but rather of integration and evolution.\nOn the other hand there are certain failures and mistakes and\ncertain real or supposed deficiencies to be considered, which we can\nscarcely suppose would have emanated from G. P. living, and these\nrequire some explanation if we are nevertheless to regard them as\nmanifestations of the real G. P. personality. I shall deal with them\nbriefly now, and oft'er a more general explanation later.\nPritnd facie there appear to have been four chief methods of\nexpressing their thoughts used by the communicators through Mrs.\nPiper's trance : (1) Where Mrs. Piper's voice was used directly by the\ncommunicator himself. The chief instance of this was Phinuit, but\nthere have been, and still arc, various other persons who are able to\nuse the voice directly, independently of Phinuit. (2) Where Phinuit,\nor some other \"controller\" of the voice, served as intermediary.\nNearly all the communications in the earlier years of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance were given in this way. (3) Where the communicator used\nMrs. Piper's hand to write. Since the development of the automatic\nwriting, most communicators have made some attempt to express their\nthoughts directly through this channel. (4) Where G. P., or some\nother \"controller\" of the hand, served as intermediary by acting as\namanuensis.\nMost of the G.P. communications have been by (3), but some of\nthe most important earlier communications were by (1). Each method\napparently has advantages and difficulties of its own.i\ni I feel absolutely certain that no progress will be made in this branch of our\ninvestigation until questions like those which I am considering are understood. It\nwould make this report far too voluminous were I to attempt to give the details of\nincidents upon which 1 found my conclusions, and I must content myself at present\nwith stating those conclusions in the text as among the results of a long practical\nexperience. And I re]>eat that I have no doubt that these conclusions in the main\nhold good even on the hypothesis that the \"communicators ' are merely fragments of\nMrs. Piper's personality awl have no direct relation with the \"deceased\" persons they\npurport to be.\nZ\n\f332 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nThus very few communicators are able to use the voice at all.\nMany have tried and failed. Some can use it for a short time only.\nG. P. was able to use it more fully and freely soon after death than in\nthe later stages of his communications. The main advantage in using\nthe voice is that the conversation can proceed more naturally as it did\nin ordinary life, and that the communicator is not so much hampered\nby interruptions and changes of subject on the part of the sitters. The\nmain disadvantage is that the resulting language shows a tendency to\ndepart more or less from the language that would have been used by\nthe communicator when living ; it is, apparently,\u2014and this we might\na priori expect \u2014much harder for the communicator to adjust the\nlanguage to the thought when operating through what we may\nsuppose to be the speech-centres of the medium, than it is to adjust\nthe language to the thought when using the writing mechanism\nof the medium. Little as I understood myself the conditions for\nobtaining the clearest results at the time of the early communications\nfrom G. P., other sitters understood them much less, and in fact there\nare few persons now who have begun to realize the difficulties that\nmust necessarily be in the way of holding a clear conversation with the\nwriting communicators through Mrs. Piper's trance. Compare, for\nexample, the natural flow of the conversation in the record of the\nsitting on November 28th, 1892 (Appendix I., p. 414) with the con\nfusion produced at the sitting with Marte, December 2nd, 1892.\n(Appendix I., p. 420).\nLet the reader start to hold a conversation with two or three\nfriends, but let him be forced to spell out his words instead of\nspeaking them in the ordinary way, and be absolutely confined to\nthis msthod of expressing himself, no matter what his friends may\ndo or say. Let him be interrupted at every two or three words by\nhis interlocutors, who tell him that they \" didn't catch the last\nword,\" and ask for it to be repeated, and occasionally several times\nrepeated. Let them, further, frequently interrupt him by asking fresh\nquestions before his answer to a previous question is completed.\nFurther, let him suppose that it is very difficult for him to hear\nprecisely what their questions are, so that he hears only portions of\nwhat they say. Having made this experiment, let him then suppose\nfurther that instead of using his own voice to spell his words with, he\nis placed in one side of a machine so constructed that the thoughts\nrunning in his mind have a tendency to be registered in writing on the\nother side of the machine, not as fast as he thinks them, but at the rate\nof writing, and that it is only by reading this writing that his interlo\ncutors know what he has to tell them. Let him suppose, further,\nthat one or more other persons are standing near him on his side\nof the machine and talking to him or to one another within his\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 333\nhearing, so that the words which they say tend to be registered in\nthe writing ; and let him further suppose that he is unfamiliar with\nthe machine, and that the writing produced has a tendency to vary\nsomewhat from the words actually thought of by him, owing to\nimperfections in the machine. Let him further suppose that the\npart of the machine in which he is placed is filled with a more\nor less suffocating gas which produces a partial loss of consciousness,\nthat sometimes this gas is much more poisonous than usual (weakness\nor ill-health of medium) and that its effects are usually cumulative\nwhile he remains in the machine.\nThe important failures of G. P. were due primarily, I believe, to\nthe ignorance of the sitters that he was communicating under some\nsuch conditions as these. And I cannot too strongly emphasise my\nconviction that, unless the presence of such conditions is constantly\nrecognised by the investigator, his further research in this field will be\nfutile. Having recognised the limitations, he may be able to modify\nthem and minimise the effect of them ; and in my opinion, it is to the\nfuller and more exact appreciation of what these limitations are, and\nto what extent they can be removed, that the main path of progress\nin psychical investigation trends. Once more I repeat that I hold this\nto be true, even if the \" communicators \" are but fragments of Mrs.\nPiper's personality.\nApplying this conception then to the failures of G. P., we find\nthat they are readily explicable. That the written communications\nshould present a certain amount of confusion and incoherence after\nfrequent interruptions by the sitters and repeated inabilities to de\ncipher the writing, will occasion no surprise. That the writing should\nfrequently \u2014especially towards the end of the sitting, as the commu\nnicator becomes exhausted and stupefied, and loses the power of\ninhibition\u2014become extremely automatic and dreamy is to be expected ;\nand questions put to the communicator in this state will be answered\nby the first vague associations that rise to the surface of the failing\nconsciousness. Not only is this the case, but such irrelevant (as they\nmay be) associations occasionally tend to recur at later periods, when\nthe communicator lapses into the same stage of dreaminess, precisely\nas they might be expected to do in ourselves. For example, in the\nlatter part of Professor Norton's sitting on May 26th, 1894, (see\np. 525) when Professor Norton put a question which G. P. living in\nfull consciousness would have answered by a reference to an essay he\nwrote at Harvard on Jane Austen, G. P. replied by references to what\nhe had written about Robert Noyes (pseudonym), the life of whom he\nhad published not long before his death, and to articles in the Sun, a\nNew York paper with which he was connected at the time of his death.\nProfessor Norton then mentioned Jane Austen. On two or three later\nz 2\n\f334 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\noccasions at the end of a sitting when the writing became particularly\ndreamy, the name of Professor Norton appeared in connection with\nthat of Jane Austen.i Another special failure occurred at the sitting\nof Mr. A. B. on April 17th, 1894 (see also p. 319), who was well-\nknown to G. P., and with whom G. P. held a \" natural \" conversation,\nasking after some common friends, etc. But he referred to his MS. on\n\"The One and the Many\" (see Appendix I., p. 428), and Mr. A. B.\nasked him a series of questions concerning the number of pages, the\npaper on which it was written, its division into chapters, its external\ntitle page, and its first sentence and its dedication, to all of which the\nanswers were wrong, as I learned afterwards. There was plainly some\nconfusion, and G. P. wrote \" do not talk too fast because I am in a\ndaze, so to speak.\"\nAgain at the end of December, 1896, he was asked whether he\ncould give the name of the person to whom he had once entrusted\nsome family documents, but he replied that he could not remember,\nand that he had been \" gone too long.\"\nI believe that these are the only notable failures of this type which\nI have in my records besides those mentioned already, or given in the\nrecords of Appendix I. Incidents illustrating temporary forgetful-\nness occur, I need hardly say, very frequently to all of us, so that we\nmomentarily fail to recall even the name of a well-known friend, and\nit is therefore not surprising, for example, that in the latter part of the\nsitting on May 14th, 1892, when G. P. was becoming more comatose,\nhe should have experienced some difficulty, after the variety of subjects\nthat had been introduced by the sitters, in immediately recalling the\ncircumstances to which his mother referred relating to another matter\naltogether (see p. 312).\nBut there were also failures of other types, which do not, however,\nseem to me to afford an argument against the \" identity \" of G. P. I\nrefer to prophecies and to descriptions of events occurring in our\nworld after his death, and to attempts to find objects that were lost.\nThus a bangle with which G. P. was familiar during life and which\nhad been used at sittings, was lost, and G. P. located it wrongly.\nSimilarly a bell with which he was familiar was supposed to be lost\nand he located it wrongly, adopting a suggestion of mine that it was\nleft in a certain hotel. Also a book, with which he had nothing to\ndo, but about which he was asked, he located wrongly. Incidents of\nthis class help us in ascertaining the limits of knowledge of communi\ncators, and correct answers to such inquiries would strengthen the\nevidence for the possession of supernormal faculty going beyond\ntelepathy from the sitters, but they do not directly affect the question.\n1 Sec, for a somewhat similar case, the report of Mrs. M., p. 347.\n\fxxxnl.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 335\nof identity. The same general statement applies to G.P.'s prophecies,\nwhich were not many and were chiefly personal, though here I think his\nsuccess would outweigh his failure. Nor, so far as I know, is there\nany indication in these groups of incidents that the wrong statements\nmade depended telepathically upon the expectations of living persons.\nThere is another type of incident yet where G. P. made at least two\nnotable failures and two notable successes. He failed completely to\ndescribe my own doings at a time agreed upon under circumstances\nwhich appeared especially favourable for a correct description if he\ncould see into our world as we do (p. 439), and in New York, a few\ndays after sittings with Miss M. and her brother, whom G. P. living\nknew well (and recognised appropriately at their sittings), he made an\nattempt to describe Miss M.'s doings during a sitting which I held for\nthe purpose. The result was a complete failure. On the other hand he\nsucceeded on at least two occasions in describing certain actions of his\nfather, and on another occasion described correctly a series of actions\nperformed by Mrs. Howard. In the case of his father the time (after\nnoon following the sitting) was correct in one set of incidents, but the\ntime did not enter into the photograph incident (see pp. 304, 314). In\nthe case of Mrs. Howard, the one to which I specially refer, the time\nwas wrong (p. 306). As I have already said, these incidents point to a\nfailure of supernormal power to see what is going on in our world as we\nsee it, and suggest rather some form of perception of scenes in the sub\nliminal consciousness, perhaps of telepathic nature. There was also some\nslight success in connection with Mr. Howard, where the time element\nwas correct (p. 319). On the whole this group of incidents appears to\nme to strengthen the evidence pointing to G. P.'s \" identity,\" since\nalthough G. P. living knew Miss M. and myself well in certain ways,\nthere was not by any means the same feeling that he had for his\nfather and the Howards. That G. P. could get into some closer\nrelation with his father and the Howards than with Miss M. or myself\nis intelligible ; but it is not so obvious why Mrs. Piper's secondary\npersonality should. But the experiments in this direction that are\nmentioned in the records are too few for any conclusion.\n\u00a7 4. Brief Accounts of Other Communicators.\nI pass on now to consider briefly the results obtained from some\nother communicators, and begin with the case of the lady whom I have\ncalled Madame Elisa Mannors. Other names are substituted for the\nreal ones. She was known to G. P., and her first appearance was to\nher sister, Madame Frederica, on May 17th, 1892 (Appendix II.,\np. 471). She had died the previous summer. The cause of her death\n\f336 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nwas designated by Phinuit, who also described correctly, purporting\nto repeat what she was telling him, some incidents which had occurred\nat her death-bed. The sitter inquired about a watch which had\nbelonged to Madame Elisa, but the statements made at this sitting,\nand to myself at subsequent sittings, did not lead to its recovery.\nSome Italian was written by request, the lady being as familiar with\nItalian as with English, but only two or three common words were\ndecipherable. The first names of sitter and communicator were given,\nand the last name was both written and afterwards given by G. P. to\nPhinuit. Some of the writing was of a personal character, and some\nabout the watch, and G. P. stated correctly, inter alia, that the\nsitter's mother was present (in \"spirit\") with the communicator, and\nthat he himself did not know her. The real names are very uncommon.\nThe Italian for \" It is well. Patience \" was whispered at the end of\nthe sitting as though by direct control of the voice by Madame Elisa.\nBoth the sitter and her sister were well-known to me, and also to\nthe Howards, and Madame Elisa made several personal communica\ntions in the course of the sittings recorded in Appendix I. (see\npp. 417-19, 423), where further attempts, only partially successful,\nwere made to write Italian clearly, and also to speak it, but not much\nwas said.\nShe communicated by writing later to three or four other friends or\nrelatives, always in a strongly personal way, and very clearly. In her\nstatements to one very personal friend, at sittings when I was present,\nshe showed on several occasions an intimate private knowledge of her\nsister and her sister's family, in connection with events that were\noccurring, and also of other relatives to whom she was deeply attached.\nShe also had several \" written talks \" with myself alone, referred to\nincidents with which we were both familiar when guests at the same\nhouse in another part of the country, and appreciated properly other\nreferences which I made myself. It always seemed like the woman I\nknew.\nAs I have mentioned elsewhere (pp. 293, 332), the intelligence com\nmunicating by writing is not conscious of the act of writing. The\nchief difficulty apparently in getting another language written by the\nhand is that strange words tend to be written phonetically unless they\naie thought out slowly letter by letter. The writing is usually much\nmore legible now than it was during the period of the records from\nwhich I am quoting, when there was frequently much difficulty in\ndeciphering even the simplest English words. It was therefore not\nsurprising that so little of the \" Italian \" written by Madame Elisa\nwas decipherable.\nIn another case there was an attempt to write Hawaiian (p. 481).\nThis was at a sitting arranged for by Mrs. Howard in October, 1893.\n\fxxxnt.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 337\nMrs. Howard made some notes at the time from which the report\nwas prepared, and I obtained some additional information later from\nthe sitter, Mr. L. Vernon Briggs. The original writing was apparently\nlost, and Mr. Briggs never had the opportunity of studying it after\nthe sitting. The communication purported to come from a Honolulu\nboy named Kalua, who became much attached to Mr. Briggs during a\nsix months' stay of Mr. Briggs in Honolulu in 1881, and who followed\nMr. Briggs to Boston under somewhat romantic circumstances in 1883.\nHe was soon sent back to his native island, but again returned to Boston,\nwhere he was shot in 1886, in a sailor's Bethel, whether intentionally\nor not was unknown. There was some suspicion against a Swede, who\nwas imprisoned, but there was no evidence against him, and he was\nfinally discharged. The Swede said that Kalua had accidentally shot\nhimself with a revolver, and eventually confessed that after the accident\nhe had himself hidden the revolver behind a flue, where, after taking\npart of the chimney down, it was found. Mr. Briggs had taken a hand\nkerchief belonging to Kalua to the sitting. Kalua had been shot\nthrough the heart, and there was some confusion apparently about the\nlocality of the suffering, \" stomach \" and \" side \" being mentioned, under\nwhat appeared to be the direct control of the voice by \" Kalua,\" and\nMr. Briggs asked if it was Kalua. Phinuit then spoke for \" Kalua,\"\nwho said that he did not kill himself, that he had been gambling with\nthe other man who disputed with him and shot him, but did not mean\nto, and who threw the revolver \"into the hot box where the pepples\nare\" (meaning \"the furnace\" and the \"coals\"), and hid his purse under\nthe steps where he was killed. \"Kalua\" also said there was shrubbery\nnear it. The cellar of the house was examined, but no purse was found,\nand there was no shruhbery in the cellar. \"Kalua\" tried to write\nHawaiian, but the only \"ordinary\" words deciphered were \"lei\" (mean\ning wreaths, which he made daily for Mr. Briggs) which was written\nclearly and frequently, and an attempt at \" aloha \"\u2014greeting. Phinuit\ntried to get the answer to the question where Kalua's father was, but\ncould only succeed in getting \" Hiram.\" But the writing gave the\nanswer \" Hawaiin Islands.\" In reply to the question which one, the\nanswer in writing was Kawai, but Phinuit said Tawai. The word is\nspelt Kawai, but is pronounced Tawai by the natives of the island\nitself and in the island where Kalua was born. The natives of the\nother islands call it Kawai.\nAnother instance of a clear \" communicator \" is that of an artist,\nLouis R., who died from cancer of the liver, on February 24th, 1892,\nand appeared first at a sitting to Mr. W. L. P., on March 10th. The\nlocality of the trouble that caused his death was pointed out. With a\ncheque book of his held above the head where no direct vision of it was\npossible, the leaves were turned over by Phinuit, and the fingers finally\n\f338 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nstopped over a pencilled statement on the back of one of the pages of\nthe cheque book, \" It's there. He says it's there.\" It appeared that\nthe day before his operation at the hospital, in January, Louis R.\n\" drew his last cheque, and when alone occupied himself in figuring\nwith pencil on the back of the next page the balance and the possible\namounts due him from various sources.\" When Phinuit said \" It's\nthere,\" the finger was \" passed exactly over the balance in the bank.\"\nPertinent statements were made, through Phinuit, showing knowledge\nof the business relations that subsisted between himself and Mr. P.,\nwith expressions characteristic of Louis R.\u2014and calling Mr. P. Will,\nas Louis R. used to call him, though he is commonly called Billie. The\nname Louis was given. \"Tell Will it's Louis.\" At a sitting which\nMrs. W. L. P. had, two days later (and to which, of course, she\nwent as a stranger), she was at once asked \" How's Will 1 \" The\nnames Augusta (wife) and a close approximation to Bowditch (intimate\nfriend) were given, and \" Louis \" recognised a knife presented as one\nthat he used to scrape the blobs of paint from his pictures, and\nseemed to be aware that Mrs. P. had the custody of his pictures. The\nmost curious incident was that in reply to Mrs. P.'s request for \" a sort\nof nickname, German,\" by which he \"used to call Will\" ; the name\nshe had in mind was not given, and Phinuit refused to accept the\nsuggestion of the sitter that the name she wanted began with Auf.\nThe name that Phinuit gave, after stumbling over durstan and Appeu-\ndust, was Uppendu.sl. The words were not spelt, and I took them\ndown as they sounded, knowing nothing myself of the name. Up and\nDust was another nickname which Louis R. occasionally applied in\njoke to Mr. W. L. P., as the latter himself explained to me, arising\nout of an odd pronunciation which he had once given in saying Ich\nhob' ein' Durst. Mr. P. had another sitting on March 25th, where\nother friends and relatives occupied most of the time communicating,\nand a reply to an inquiry which he put about a book in a sealed\npackage elicited no result of any significance from Louis R. Other\nincidents of interest connected with other communicators occurred at\nthese sittings (see especially p. 291), though there was some confusion.\nLouis R. was known to me, as he stated at Mrs. P.'s sitting, and asked\nif I was \"still fishing for facts.\" I replied that I was, and should be\nglad if he would help. At the first sitting held at the house of Mr.\nHoward, November 22nd, 1892 (p. 413) G. P. wrote that Louis was\nthere and wanted to see Billie. \" Go out and tell him to come.\" The\nHowards saw no relevance in this, and they did not think of Louis R. ;\nbut Mr. W. L. P. lived very close to the Howards, and Louis R.\nhimself was an intimate friend of the Howards, and had often been in\nMr. Howard's library, where the sitting was held. (An interesting\ncommentary on the freaks of memory exhibited by communicators !)\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 339\nThis was followed by the writing of a name unknown to me, Foxcroft,\nand apparently no one recognised this either, so I told Phinuit to send\nthose persons away; that we wished to talk to G. P. I learned after\nwards that Foxcroft C , deceased, was a fellow artist and friend of\nLouis R. and was also known to the Howards, and in the following\nsitting the names of his wife Mary and daughter Addie were given by\nPhinuit. At the twelfth sitting held at the house of Mr. Howard,\nJanuary 24th, 1893 (p. 439), Louis R. appeared again, and sent some\nmessages through Phinuit, referring to the room as the place where he\nhad been many a time, mentioning Mr. and Mrs. W. L. P., and\nrecognising some brushes brought by Mrs. Howard as ones which he\nhad given her, and saying he had been to Philadelphia to see his\nfriends\u2014the living Louis R. had friends there\u2014and asking after\nTheodore, the first name of another artist living, a friend of Louis R.\nand also of the Howards. On two or three later occasions Louis R.\n\" dropped in,\" as it were, to send a little personal message by writing,\non one occasion seizing the left hand when Madame Elisa (see p. 335)\nwas using the right. Madame Elisa drew my attention to the fact\nthat some one else was speaking, and then mentioned his name, not\nLouis, but \" Mr. R\u2014\u2014,\" writing the surname correctly. Numerous\nincidents of this kind have, as I think, thrown much light on the\ncause of many of the irrelevancies manifest when Phinuit was practi\ncally the only intermediary. Thus at Mr. MacDonough's only sitting\n(p. 473), on February 9th, 1893, Louis R. was mentioned by Phinuit.\nThe sitter would count this as a mistake, and as diminishing the\nevidential value of the sitting. But G. P. seemed to be able to\ndistinguish much better than Phinuit which communicators were\nfriends of a sitter, and which were, for the time being, outsiders, and\nhe would, as it appeared, sometimes tell such outsiders to go away and\nnot interrupt, and at other times make it clear that they were not\nconnected with the sitter, and would give their messages in an\n\" aside,\" as it were, to me.\nA good instance of the confusion arising from what appears to be\nthe \" return \" of a recent communicator to send further messages to\nfriends, is given in Appendix III. (see pp. 499-501). On March 2nd,\n1894, Mrs. M. E. P. and Mrs. Alice Dale (pseudonym) had a sitting,\nand on March 3rd, when Mr. Heywood was present, the first writing\nthat came was a message to Alice Dale, purporting to be from her\nsister Polly, who said she was with Elsie at all times. But the writing\nfurther on contained the statement \"I often see Alice Wilkinson.\"\nPolly, whose real name was Alice Wilkinson, was the adopted sister of\nMrs Dale, and Mrs. Dale's last baby had been named Alice after her,\nbut was called Elsie to avoid confusion, as Mrs. Dale's name was also\nAlice. Of these circumstances the only one known to me was that\n\f340 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nMrs. Dale's name was Alice. I asked at later sittings for an explana\ntion of this error, and concluded that \" Daisy \" ( \" deceased \" wife of\nMr. Heywood), from whom the immediately following communications\npurported to come, was m contact with the writing mechanism (see p.\n399), which reproduced what \" Daisy \" heard \" Alice Wilkinson \" say,\nand also what was passing through her own mind (or possibly what she\nheard another \" intelligence \" say). I did not appreciate until long\nafterwards that apparently G. P. saw what was happening, and\nperceived that something was wrong with the writing mechanism or\nthat \"Daisy\" could not manage it. He therefore took her place, saying\n\" I saw her and in consequence right it for you.\" Mr. Heywood and\nmyself, who were not aware that there was anything to right, assumed\nthat write was intended, and we laughed and remarked upon it. To\nwhich G. P. wrote emphatically, \" Am I not right I \" and then\ncontinued : \"Well, do speak and I will help you. This was a mistake,\nif you please. Trust me\u2014trust it to me, sir,\" i.e., to act as amanuensis.\nG.P.'s discernment in such cases has apparently been of great assist\nance, and my own more complete supervision of Mrs. Piper's sittings\nand knowledge of the records has enabled me to keep out much\nconfusion by either taking the message in any particular case and\npromising to deliver it, or by sending the \" intruder \" away. The\nresults have proved to be in precise accordance with the theory that\nthe communicators are what they purport to be, which thus conforms\nto one important canon of scientific requirements.\nAt Mr. MacDonough's sitting (p. 473) there were some messages\nfrom the sitter's brother, John MacDonough, including specific\ndirections for the discovery of a leak in Mr. MacDonough's house at\nLong Branch, N.Y. The leak was said to be under a certain window-\nsill, and there indeed the leak was afterwards found and repaired.\nJohn MacDonough also seemed to know the state of his son's business\ninterests, and that he had trouble with his throat and head, none of\nthese circumstances being known to the sitters at the time, but\nverified afterwards. On five later occasions messages came from John\nMacDonough which on the whole suggest that he was better than\nmost communicators as regards his knowledge of contemporary mun\ndane affairs. On two of these occasions G. P. acted as amanuensis,\nand the first time apparently wanted to make sure that MacDonough\nwas not an \" interloper \" before he would give the message (p. 477).\nOne of the five messages was personal and non-evidential, and one\nwas confused, and seemed to convey the information that the com\nmunicator's son John had died. His son John was apparently well\nat the time, but died in the following year. At least two of the\nremaining three messages contained specific information not referred\nto previously and unknown to me, but correctly given.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 341\nThe question may arise whether all such incidents demand a\nhypothesis which goes at least as far as telepathy from distant persons.\nIf they were known to the sitter at the time of his sitting, then,\nalthough not mentioned by the communicators at that time, it might\nbe supposed that the knowledge was acquired then for reproduction\nafterwards. Many however cannot be explained in this way, even if\nwe allowed a very wide margin for the presence at sittings of persons\nwho might be supposed to know of the facts incidentally. Thus it will\nhardly be considered probable that one of the above messages, which\nreferred to Mrs. MacDonough's apprehensions concerning her then\nillness, could be thus explained. I think that few if any of my readers\nwill be likely to press this hypothesis into much service, but I may\npoint out that theoretically it might be assumed that the supraliminal\nand subliminal consciousness of all persons, on this earth at least, if\nnot elsewhere also, are open to Mrs. Piper's inspection.\nI know of several instances where other communicators have had\nthe opportunity of frequent communication through Mrs. Piper's trance\nduring a course of several years, and at many of these sittings I have been\npresent. They have strengthened my conviction that primarily depended\nupon the communications from G. P., but the sitters regard them as too\npersonal for publication. The best things can obviously never or very\nseldom be reproduced ; if they could be, they would prove themselves,\nby that very fact, to fall short of being the most convincing. And\nhence all one can offer is a few dry bones instead of a living and\nbreathing personality, to use the words of the lady who prepared the\nfollowing account. I shall call her Mrs. M. She is an exceptionally\ngood witness, and I confirm the statements which she makes as\nregards my share in her sittings. Other names have been substituted\nfor the real names.\nApril, 1890.\nI met Mrs. Piper for the first time on the 23rd of April, 1894, in New\nYork, at 1068, Lexington Avenue, where she was then giving \"sittings.\"\nI had made the appointment from a town in Georgia by letter, through\nMr. Hodgson, and arrived alone at the house at ten o'clock a.m. 1 inquired\nfor Mr. Hodgson, who, I was told, had not come yet, but was expected soon.\nI waited a few moments, when Mr. Hodgson arrived, addressed me as\n\"Mrs. Smith,\" and called Mrs. Piper\u2014who was upstairs, and whom 1 had\nnot beforo seen, \u2014introduced me to her as \" Mrs. Smith,\" and arranged the\nroom for the \"sitting.\" There was a little indifferent conversation, but\nnothing which could in any way give a clue to my identity.\nMr. Hodgson I had never seen until that morning, and had had only a\nslight correspondence with him referring to my appointment with Mrs. Piper\nand my associate membership in the S.P.R. , and as far as I am aware he\nknew absolutely nothing about me, except that I was anxious to have some\nsittings with Mrs. Piper. At that time I had never seen or heard of the\nreports of Mrs. Piper in Parts XVII. and XXI. of the Proceedings of the\n\f342 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nS. P.R. , but I had road the account of her written by Miss X. in Borderland\nfor January, 1891, so was somewhat prepare! for the peculiarities of.Mrs.\nPipar's trance and for \" Phinuit\" when ha made his appearance. About the\nfirst remark \" Phinuit \" made to me was, \"There is a gentleman in your\nsurroundings who won't stay in the body long\u2014a relative of yours.\" The\ndescription which \" Phinuit \" gave me did not apply to any near relative of\nmy own. Ha then said, \" Who is Richard 1 He's here with me, wants\nto spaak to you. He hasn't been out of the body a great while.\" I asked\nwhat relation Richard wa? to me. Phinuit said, \"He will try to write it.\"\nWritin'j. \" I see my sister and I am her brother, but I am a little less\nlight than I wish to be.\" I then said, \"Is this B ?\" using a pet name\nof my brother's ; there seemed to ba great excitement in the hand, which\ngrasped mine and shook it frantically. This question was then written,\n\" Where is Jamas ? \" [Richard is the name of a younger brother of mine\nwho died early in 1891, and James is the name of my elder brother, and\nhe was with me when I was taking care of Richard during his last illness.]\nThe rest of the sitting was very much confused, and reminded me painfully\nof the last hours of my brother's illness, which had been passed in delirium,\nbut, as at that time, a clear thought would be expressed now and then. He\nsaid he wished to send a message to his mother (who is living), but seemed\ntoo confused to be able to do so. There were many little things very\ncharacteristic of the boy, but the effect of most of the \" sitting \" was\nlike the half-intalligible muttering of delirium. The hand felt my jacket\nand seemed to try to reach something inside. I gave it a small locket and\nchain which I wore around my neck under my dress. The hand\u2014all the\ntime holding the locket\u2014then wrote, but very confusedly, and with many\npauses, \"I remember *. . . he is here and will come in again .\ntjll my sister all about it . . . yes . . . he loves her and understands\nall ... I do not quite get it ; Tom. I do not hear quite distinctly\u2014\nPaidiae is on my mind.\"\nThe locket contained soma hair and a small picture of my husband,\nwho died in 1892. Tom is the name of a person who was well known to my\nhusband and who, for reasons known only to myself, was very much in my\nt'l oughts at that time. Pauline is the name of my eldest sister. After the\nwriting had ceased \"Phinuit\" took the locket and chain and remarked,\n\"There are two dilferent people here ; a gentleman connected with this lady\nwho passed out with something the matter with his heart, and an old lady\ncalled Mama (?), she's been passed out some years. The other's a gentleman's\ninfluence.\"\nNo one had owned the locket and chain but myself. I bought it a few\nweeks after my husband's death, put the hair and picture in it, and it had\nnever afterwards been out of my possession, so the reference to the \"old\nlady \" had no moaning for me.\nMy second \"sitting \" occurred the next morning. I had no conversation\nwith either Mrs. Piper or Mr. Hodgson in the meantime, except to tell\nMr. II. that I had a brother Richard and that I had not found the person I\nhad hoped to hear from, and to beg for another sitting. Mr. Hodgson\nsuggested that I bring some article belonging to the person I was trying to\nfind, and I therefore brought with me a letter of my huiband's when I came\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 343\nthe next morning (April 24th). Mrs. Piper went into trance as usual, and\nat once \" Phinuit \" remarked to me, \"After I went out I found your brother\nand another gentleman with him. . . . The gentleman is everything to\nyou. He will come ... is getting light. Has something important\nto say. ... I get the name of Brown. B-r-o-w-n. I get it from your\ngentleman. He says you will knoiv. Richard says Susy. \"\nIn my first \"sitting\" the name Sits;\/ had occurred a number of times,\nbut it had no special meaning for me in connection with my brother, and I\nwas constantly thinking of Ruth, the name of a young girl to whom my\nbrother had been.ongaged to be married, but on my way home it flashed over\nme that Susy was the name of a sister two years older than my brother\nRichard. She died before ho was born, so when \"Phinuit \" said \" Richard\nsays Susy \" I asked, \"Did he mean Susy when I suggested Ruth to him\nyesterday ?\" \" Yes, it is Susy. He told you forty times the last time, but\nyou wouldn't understand ; he said, ' If that's my sister she must know who\nSusy is.' She's here with him ; she was his sister, she passed out many\nyears ago ; it was very sad for her mother, the most sad of any trouble she\never had. She was very bright. She would have been very musical ; it was\nvery sad for her mother.\"\nThe baby Susy died at seven months old, was \"very bright\" \u2014 and my\nmother has often told mo how fond of music she was, and that the\nsound of the piano would quiet her when she was in pain. Her death was a\ngreat sorrow to my mother.\nWhen \"the writing\" b^gvn it was confused and trembling, \"Do you\nknow who I am?\" Then the names Brown and Parker were written\u2014the\nnames of the doctor and nurse who had cared for my husband during his last\nillness\u2014and then a sort of cry seemed to come with the words, \" Oh, don't\nyou know me? Don't you know me ? I am Roland and I love you always.\nSpeak to me.\" [Roland was correct, and was the name by which Mrs. M.\nusually called her husband. As I have stated above, in introducing Mrs.\nM.'s account, this is not the real name. Roland and Rullo\u2014see below\u2014are\nchosen as substitutes for the real names.\u2014R. H.] What followed was\nperfectly intelligible and much of it characteristic, but seemed like the weak\nand trembling words of a very sick man trying to keep his thoughts clear\nand make himself understood. After a short time this was written : \"I told\nRichard to tell you about Tom for me ; too bad he was all mixed up. \" Then\nTom was spoken of as only my husband would have been likely to speak of\nhim, and affairs connected with him and unknown to any person but myself\nwere mentioned.\nAn intimate friend of my husband's was spoken of by name, and I was\nbegged to caution him not to overwork. He referred directly to the last\ntime we were in the park together at T , and answered a question which\nI had asked him when he was dying, but which he had been too weak to\nanswer at that time \u2014it was a curious incident. Mr. Hodgson was in the\nroom with me most of the time, as I was too unused to Mrs. Piper's automatic\nwriting to read it without help, and I said, \" If this is my husband, will you\nanswer the question I asked you when you were dying ? \" The hand grasped\nmine, but no reference was made to my question for a few moments,\nthen very cautiously a name was written, and my question fully answered,\n\f344 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nbut in such a w\u00bby that Mr. Hodgson\u2014or any stranger\u2014would not under\nstand to what he referred, but which was perfectly plain to me. It was, to\nme, the most wonderful part of my \" sitting.\"\nOn April 25th Mr. Hodgson wrote me :\u2014\n\"At 101i8, Lexington Avenue, this morning, one of our members,\nMrs. R., was trying experiments in crystal gazing ami automatic writing.\nMrs. Pipar had her hand resting occasionally on Mrs. R.'s. Mrs. P. felt\nsome pushing, etc., in her hand. I put pencil in and we went on talking.\nTurning to talk to another lady present, a Mrs. G , my attention was\nattracted suddenly by Mrs. P.'s breathing. She was on the point of being\nentranced, and while I was managing to keep her out of trance successfully,\nher right hand with pencil was dashing off the enclosed, viz. :\u2014'Add lo\ninstead of and.' Sitting late this afternoon began without speech. Writing :\n'Add lo in place of and. Rollo.' Then writing changed. Phinuit. turned up\nat end of sitting for brief period\u2014little strength, but I gathered from ' him '\nthat this message is for you. Apparently Phinuit said, ' It was Rollo,\ncalled Roland.' \"\nAt my \" sitting,\" April 24th, I had twice asked my husband to write his\nname, and each time he wrote Roland. I was not thinking of \"Rollo,\" but\nhoped that the full name would be written, because I knew neither\nMrs. Piper nor Mr. Hodgson knew it. I am quite sure I did not use the\nname \" Rollo.\"\nIn my next sitting, May 1st, the incident is not mentioned, perhaps\nbecause there was so much to say, but on May 31st, at a sitting Mr. H. was\nhaving, this was written : \"Do you recognise me, sir ? Add lo instead of\nand. \" My husband's family usually called him ' ' Rollo,\" and I often did also.\nAt the sitting April 24th he had begged me to call him by the name\nI used to, and I did call him a foolish little pet name I often used, and which\nseemed to satisfy him at the time, but once again in the sitting Mr. H.\nwas having for me (June 15th) he wrote : \" Ask her if she remembers what\nRollo means,\" and in the letter I wrote my husband, and which Mr. Hodgson\nread at the sitting on June 26th, I spoke to him as \" Rollo,\" and at once was\n\u2022written, \"Rollo ! ah, ah\u2014now you know what I meant.\"\nMy third \"sitting\" was on May 1st. It was much bettor than the\nothers, though the oft'ect of some of it was still like a sick and very weak\nperson trying to talk.\nThe night before this sitting [when alone] I had asked my husband if he\ncould not tell me on the following morning, through Mrs. Piper, of something\nI had done or said in the last few days, simply as a proof that he could hear\nand see me, as he had told me at my last \" sitting \" that he could. A young\nbrother who was a great favourite with my husband was spoken of by name,\nand I was told that my husband had seen us walking together lately in what\nseemed to him to be a garden and water near it ; also that he had heard us\ntalking of his mother's building another house. Between my sitting on\nApril 24th and that on May 1st I had taken a walk with my young brother-\nin law, and we paused several minutes to look at the fresh grass and trees in\nthe garden of St. Luke's Hospital, 56th Street and 5th Avenue, and then\npassed the Park at 59th Street, and during the afternoon we had talked a\nlong time about a new house my mother-in-law was thinking of building.\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 345\nThere were no mistakes in names during the \"sitting,\" and nothing\nwhich my husband might not have written.\nIn answer to a question of mine referring to \"the gentleman in my\nsurroundings to pass out soon,\" who had been spoken of in my first sitting,\nPhinuit said, \"There are three different friends of yours going to pass out\n,within six months.\" He then gave me a quite different description of\n\"tho gentleman\" from the first, and which strongly reminded me of a near\nrelative, yet it was by no means a perfect description, and Phinuit did not\nsay who the man was, or in what relation he stood to me, only that \" He\ncomes very near to you.\" He said the others were \"A little lady with\nsomething the matter with her stomach ; I think the other is a relative.\"\nI have lost no near friend or relative since that time. An aunt of my\nhusband's died within a few weeks, and afterwards Phinuit told me she was\none of the people he meant, but he was very confused and uncertain about\nwhat he said.\nAfter my last sitting Mr. Hodgson called at my hotel one evening to\nhelp me decipher the automatic writing, and during the evening suggested\nthat I try to send him a message by my husband through Mrs. Piper. I\nagreed to it, and when Mr. Hodgson returned to Boston he had a series of\n\"sittings\" for other purposes, during which a good deal of the writing\npurported to come from my husband.\nOn May 2ist, 1894, Mr. H., who had at previous sittings requested\nPhinuit to get \"Roland\" to give the message which his wife was going to\nsend, wrote me that he had given one of my letters to Mrs. Piper to hold\nduring her trance, and that this writing came : \"She gave me this message,\nsir.\" Then followed what purported to bo the message I was to send\nMr. Hodgson, but which was no approach to it. Several references were\nmade to people who had been mentioned in my \"sittings\" in New York\u2014\nnothing irrelevant was written, but no new matter was introduced.\nAgain, on May 31st another message came, different from the first but no\nnearer the few words I was trying so hard to convey to my husband. How\never, this occurred : \" She told me to tell you, sir, that she put some flowers\non the tomb, and asked me if I saw her do it. If so, come and tell you.\"\nA few days before I had planted some wood violets on my husband's grave.\nI had sent the gardener away for water and was quite alone. It seemed to\nme my husband was very near. I looked up from my work and said, as if I\nwas speaking to some one standing by me, \" Roland, if you can see me I\nwish you would go and tell Mr. Hodgson so, \" but I had no thought of the\nmessage really being taken, for there had already been a failure to take the\nspecific message I was trying to send. Of course I had no corroborative\ntestimony to this incident, as I never spoke of it to anyone, and might have\nforgotten it had it not been for the writing coming so soon afterwards.\n' On June 5th, 6th, 9th, 11th, and 1oth, Mr. Hodgson had \"sittings,\" at\nwhich my husband wrote, always giving some \"message,' but never any\nnearer the right one, though always something I might have said which\nwould have seemed natural enough. There was often much confusion, as\nif many people were trying to talk at once, and it reminded me of a \" crossed\ntelephone wire.\" There was also much complaint of the difficulty in keeping\nthe thoughts clear in so much confusion, and remarks like this, \" It is not\n\f346 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nso easy to express one's thoughts to a marriage ring as it is to one's wife.\"\nI had sent Mr. Hodgson a ring of my husband's and a lock of hair of my\nown to be used at the \"sittings,\" both of which were correctly recognised,\nand the remark made that the ring had been made for Mr. M., and taken\nfrom his body after his death, which was true ; but the ring had rather a\npeculiar history, known to my husband, which was not referred to in any\nway, though I wrote Mr. Hodgson to say at the next sitting that there was\nsomething more about the ring I would bo glad to hear.\nOn June 4th an aunt of my husband's died, and I hoped that some\nreference to the fact would appear in the \"sittings,\" and tried to gut that\nmessage to my husband. I wrote Mr. Hodgson that some special event had\ntaken place at home, and asked him to ask my husband if he knew what\nit was. No knowledge of it was shown until June 16th, when this occurred :\n\u2022' Ask her if this was the message, viz., 'Take my thanks to Mr. H ,\nand tell him there is another spirit friend of mine with you\u2014yes - and ask\nher to go with you and give her name to H .' Thanks. Will you ask\nher ? If you will, I'll bring the lady to you. First I wish to know if this\nis not exactly what she asked me, sir. Ask her, and if she wishes the lady's\nname you will have it.\" Unfortunately Mr. Hodgson was to have but one\nmore \" sitting \" at which my affairs could be given any attention, and I had\nwritten a letter to my husband for Mr. Hodgson to read at the sitting, and\nin it had mentioned the name of the aunt who had just died, so that it\nwas of no use to \"ask for the lady's name.\" Nearly all of the comments\nwhich were made during the reading of the letter were quite out of the way,\nand a number of names were mentioned of supposed friends on \" that side,\"\nnone of which were correct as applied to any of my own or my husband's\nconnections.\nOn June 9th, in answer to a question I had asked Mr. Hodgson to ask for\nme, Phinuit said he did not think it best for me to know who the friends\nwere who were to \"pass out,\" but that ho would give their names to\nMr. Hodgson, who might keep them till after the events had taken place.\nTho next fall, at my request, Mr. Hodgson gave me the paper (after Phinuit\nhad given him permission to do so). The name of a near relative\u2014 of whom\nPhinuit's secuntl description had made me think\u2014was given, and the remark\nmade that a cousin would pass out in a specific manner. Neither event has\ntaken place.\nMy next \"sitting\" with Mrs. Piper was in Arlington Heights, Mass.,\nOctober 19th. I had ten sittings at that time -from October 19th to\nDecember 7th\u2014and again in the spring of 1895 I had two sittings, May 11th\nand 13th. One on August 23rd, two September 16th and 17th, and four\nfrom November 12th to December 6th, making 21 in all.\nOn February loth and March 7th, 1895, Miss Edmunds had two sittings\nfor me, using articles I had sent her for the purpose, and of the ownership\nof which she was entirely ignorant. All of the articles were correctly\nrecognised, and several prophecies which had been made to me about their\nowners repeated with some detail. I asked Miss Edmunds to ask my husband\nto write his full name, which was not on my visiting card and which she\ncould not possibly be aware of. The name was at once correctly written, but\nfor some reason Miss Edmunds did not think it was right, and asked if the\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 347\nwriter was quito sure of it. The name was then differently written, though\ncommencing with the same letter R (which was on my visiting card), and at\na sitting which Miss Edmunds had for me on January 25th of the present\nyear the name was written again in the same way, though Miss Edmunds\nthen knew it was wrong, and knew what the real name was.\nDuring the ten sittings, from October 19th to December 7th, 1894, many\nprophecies were made as to the death of near relatives and friends, and\nevents to take place in my own and my friends' lives. No definite time was\ngiven, more than to say \"it will come soon,\" or \"before a great while.\"\nWith a very few minor exceptions, none of the things told me at that time\nhave happened.\nAt my two sittings in May, 1895, I was told I would be in three different\nplaces that summer\u2014one, Boston, where I then was ; another, a place my\nhusband had never been and did not know the name of, so he said, but\nPhinuit described it as \"near the water,\" which is his usual way of\nspeaking of the sea-shore ; the third place was \" where Dr. P. lives in the\nsummer\" [Dr. P. had a sitting with Mrs. Piper several years previously.\u2014\nR.H.], and I was told I would stay in \"a weather-stained sort of house, near\na red house, some water in front of it.\" I had never seen D , Dr. P. 's\nsummer home, and had heard no description of it, beyond the fact that it was\na beautiful country place, with mountain scenery, and from some remark of\nDr. P.'s, I had supposed there was no water there. When I told him what\nPhinuit had said, he remarked that the \"Evergreen Cottages,\" where I would\nprobably stay if I came to D , could not be better described than as\n\"weather-stained and red,\" for one was a shingled and stained house, the\nother painted red, and there was a beautiful little lake very near them. At\nthat time I was hoping to come to D , but so uncertain about it that I\nwould not allow Dr. P to engage my rooms at the \"Evergreen Cottages,\"\nalthough I knew there was little chance of securing them later in the season,\nand I had no thought of going to the sea-shore, it seemed the last thing\nlikely for me to do. However, I did go to the sea-shore for ten days in\nAugust, and later spent a month in D , staying in the weather-stained\nhouse described by Phinuit. During the same sittings I was told that the\nnear relative of whoso death so much had been said would not \" pass out \"\nfor a year yet.\nIn my sittings in August and September I was told that certain properties\nI hold would be sold at a given figure \" within three months.\" It would have\nbeen impossible to sell any of them for half the value given, at any time\nsince the sittings, but other minor details of a financial nature have, rather\nto my surprise, come about as stated at that time.\nDuring the sittings, particularly the series of ten\u2014October 19th to\nDecember 7th, 1894\u2014there were many mistakes in Christian names. For\ninstance, I asked to have the names of my husband's three sisters written.\nThe names of two were at once written ; the second name, the real name of\nmy sister-in-law, but not the name by which we usually call her. Her name\nis also that of my eldest sister, so that when it was written I said, \"That is\nmy sister ; I want the names of your sisters.\" At once came the remark,\n\"But mine, too. Have you forgotten?\" The name of the third sister I\ncould not get written, and there seemed the strangest hesitancy about\n2 A\n\fRichard Hodgson. [part\nattempting it, and evasion and \"trickiness\" most distressing, and very\nuncharacteristic of the living personality of the writer. At last a name was\nwritten, but not the correct one, though a near approach to the pet name by\nwhich she was called. I have never been able to get the pet name correctly\nwritten, though the real name has since been written, or any reasonable\nexplanation of why it could not be written. Nothing more than \" Names\nare one of the most difficult things to recall here.\"\nThe aunt of my husband's who died in June, 1894, has often sent me,\nthrough Phinuit or my husband, some appropriate sounding message, and\ntwice purported to write herself, but never seemed able to give her own\nname correctly ; it is an unusual name, probably unique in this country,,\nand I tried to get it written a number of times, but with no success.\nThe matter of the four sittings from November 12th to December 6th,\n1895, is of too private a nature to quote here, and owing to the fact that\nmuch of it referred to other people and their affairs, I have been unable to\nverify many of the statements made. When I had the sitting on November\n12th, I expected to leave Boston in a very few days, and spoke of the\nfact, and that I feared I should have no opportunity for another sitting. I\nwas told I would stay in Boston much longer than I expected, and in a day\nor two I received a letter which changed my plans, and I did remain in\nBoston until December 9th.\nIt is very difficult for me to explain \u2014as Mr. Hodgson has requested me\nto\u2014just what general effect the \" sittings \" have made on my mind. If I\nhad never had a \" sitting \" with Mrs. Piper, and this report had been written\nby some one else, I am sure I should say : \"There's not enough evidence\nhere to prove that the living personality of the man called Roland ever\nreached his wife through Mrs. Piper's ' mediumship ' ; there is little beside\ncoincidence, suggestions unconsciously made by the sitter to Mrs. Piper\nduring the highly susceptible condition of her trance state, incidents that can\nbe fully explained by thought-transference from living persons,\" etc., etc. I\nam quite sure I should never be convinced by any such report as this of the\nreality of \"spirit return.\" Yet I am convinced of it, but it is because there\nis much in my \" sittings\" which might help to convince a stranger, which is\nof too personal a nature to quote, and perhaps the most convincing thing is\nthe accumulation of little touches of personality which make the \"sittings \"\nso real to me, but which it would bo almost impossible to reproduce in print.\nPeculiarities of expression in the writing and of manner in that wonderfully\ndramatic hand of Mrs. Piper's. Anyone who has had a good sitting with\nMrs. Piper will know exactly what I mean. One feels the hand is alive with\na distinct personality very different from \"Phinuit \" (who has \" controlled \"\nthe voice in all my sittings). The behaviour of the hand when it is controlled\nby my husband or my brother is as distinct and as characteristic of the two\nmen as anything of the kind could possibly be.\nThere is a great difference in the qiurtity of the sittings ; at some of\nthem no irrelevant matter would be written, and at others much which\nsounded, as I have before said, like the odd scraps of conversation one might\nhear over a telephone wire. I have generally found that the poor sittings\nwere on days when either Mrs. Piper or I was not up to our normal physical\ncondition.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 349\nAt my first four sittings Mr. Hodgson was present and took notes for me;\nafter that I have always taken notes, -during the \"sitting,\" of \"Phinuit's\"\nremarks, and immediately afterwards, generally on my way to Boston from\nArlington Heights\u2014where most of my sittings took place\u2014written out as full\na statement as I could of all that had occurred, looked over the automatic\nwriting, and filled in my own remarks and questions as accurately as possible.\nIt is from these notes and MSS. I have made this Report.\nI have other records of series of sittings which I have been\nrequested not to publish except under such restrictions as would make\nthem practically useless, but which I hope at some future day to obtain\npermission to give in detail, as they have been of much help in enabling\nme to understand the causes of obscurity in communicating. I make\nthe following brief statement about three of them, in illustration.\nThe first was the case of a gentleman intimately known to me,\nwhom I shall call A. I devoted about six sittings, more than a year\nafter his death, in the attempt to obtain clear communications from\nhim. Various names and incidents were referred to in which he had\nbeen specially interested when living, including two or three specific\nreferences to matters unknown to me. There was much incoherence,\nbut of a character which distinctly suggested the mind of A. and not\nthe mind of anyone else, as regards the more or less disassociated\nfragments of knowledge exhibited. He had been troubled much for\nyears before his death by headaches and occasional mental exhaustion,\nthough not amounting to positive mental disturbance. I finally\ngave up the attempt, on the advice of G. P., who affirmed that\nhe would not be clear for some time to come. There was no opportu\nnity afterwards for any detailed communication from him. He\nmanifested to four other persons at sittings incidentally, claiming\ncorrectly that he knew them, and he did not claim any recognition of\npersons who were strangers to him. But I do not know whether other\nsitters may have been known to him to whom he did not appear.\nThe second case was that of a gentleman whom I shall call B., and\nwith whom I had a short correspondence two or three years before his\ndeath, but he was unknown to me personally. He took his own life in\na moment of temporary aberration. Communications purporting to\ncome from him were obtained originally by means of articles which\nhad been used by him and which were presented to Phinuit. Here\nthe incoherence at first was even greater than in the case of A., and\nthere seemed to be as much difficulty in getting facts known to me as\nin getting those which were not. Thus in reply to inquiries, he named,\nas the cause of his death, a trouble from which he had suffered for a\nyear before his death, and which led to his temporary aberration. This\nwas unknown to me ; but the circumstance that he had taken his own\nlife, which was known to me, was not mentioned till long afterwards.\n2 a 2\n\f350 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nAt some of the sittings later on, two friends of his were present, and\nwere fully and appropriately recognised, but it was several years\nbefore he could communicate with any continuous clearness. In the\nmeantime, amidst much confusion, and various wrong statements,\nthere was much specific information correctly given which, as in\nthe case of A., indicated the mind of B. rather than the mind\nof anyone else. Some of this information was unknown not only to\nmyself, but to his friends who had sittings. Gradually, however,\nowing, as I think myself, to the lapse of time and greater familiarity\nwith the act of communicating on the part of B.,\u2014or, as some may\nthink, owing to the development of a pseudo B -personality in Mrs.\nPiper,\u2014these confusions cleared away. I quote the following from a\nstatement made by one of the two friends of B. who had sittings.\nWe at first thought mind-reading might play an important part in the\nsittings, but the more we experimented the less weight we gave to it. On\nseveral occasions no information could be obtained of facts known perfectly\nto both sitters, and on which both our minds were fixed. Several of the\nsittings were excellent throughout, notably one [the last] at which [the other\nfriend] and I were alone present. It seemed as if B. stood before us in\nperson ; the answers came immediately, without the slightest hesitation, and\nshowed an intimate knowledge of our past relations to each other. Many\nfacts were related and circumstances referred to which were known only to\nB. and ourselves, but which are of too personal a nature for publication.\nThese were given not in the nature of a test, but in the course of conversa\ntion as one friend would talk with another. Small touches of character,\npeculiarities of expression, and modes of thought, we instantly recognised as\na part of his individuality.\nIn the third case, C, another friend of mine who also took his\nown life, there was much confusion even a year after his death, when\nhe first came into communication, and there was a lamentable failure\nin answering questions concerning matters well-known to C. living.\nLater on, however, he became clearer and gave specific information,\nunknown to the sitters, of a private and personal kind, well suited\nas a proof of identity, and showed in written communications\nafterwards much that was suggestive of C,\u2014in tendencies of thought\nand particular remembrances,\u2014 operating under peculiar difficulties\nthrough an inferior mechanism. More than seven years after\ndeath he wrote, \" My head was not clear, and is not yet, when I speak\nto you.\"\nAs I suggested at the beginning of this paper, it is to series of\nsittings with the same communicator that we must look for special\nlight upon the question how far the continued personalities of the\n\" dead \" are actually concerned in these phenomena, but there are\nvarious incidents in the detailed records given in the Appendices\npublished herewith, where only one or two opportunities have been\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 351\nafforded to the same communicator, which I think add to the evidence\nderived from the longer series. Thus, at the sitting of Miss Macleod\n(p. 447), where her sister Etta seemed to be the chief communicator,\nthrough Phinuit, though several mistakes were made and several names\nmentioned that had no relevance, she was told that her uncle David\nwould die soon. So far as the sitter knew, his health was then perfectly\ngood, but he died in a year. Etta while living supposed that her\nillness \u2014the cause of her death \u2014had to do with \"the stomach,\" and\nthis was stated at the sitting, but it was known to the sitter and her\nfamily that the cause of death was heart trouble. Again \"Etta\" said\nthat the last thing she saw was her mother's face until she became\nconscious in a room and saw her body lying under something white.\nThis was confirmed by the mother, who said that Etta was looking\nright into her face \" when the light went out of her eyes.\" But the\nsitter had always thought that Etta's eyes were closed at this time.\nThe records of M. Bourget's sittings (p. 494) and Mr. Heywood's\n(p. 501) and Mr. Mitchell's (p. 517) all appear to me to be interesting\nexamples of the complicated form which the communications have\nfrequently taken during Mrs. Piper's trance. At Mr. Heywood's\nsittings, besides much that was personal and characteristic of his late\nwife, including knowledge that he believed to be known to no other\nperson living but himself, several facts were mentioned of which he was\nentirely ignorant. But the records should be read throughout to be\nappreciated. (See especially pp. 504-510).\nDr. F. H. K. (p. 527) also received information unknown to him, at\nhis sittings, and afterwards verified, besides much that was personal to\nhim, producing as he says \" a very strong conviction that the control\nwas what it purported to be, that of my late wife.\" At his second\nsitting, on his way home after a year's trip abroad, he received some\ncommunications from his \" uncle G., recently deceased.\" Among other\nstatements was : \" Give my love to L., and tell her I see the trouble\nwith her eyes.\" L. was the initial of his uncle G.'s widow, but Dr. K.\ndid not understand the message till he reached his home in Illinois\nand found that his aunt L. had been \"for some little time under treat\nment for some trouble with her eyes.\"\nVarious instances of the giving of information unknown to the\nsitters occurred in the series of sittings, the records of which are given\nas a group in Appendix IV., as all being closely concerned with the\nfriends and relatives of Dr. and Mrs. A. B. Thaw. At their first\nsitting a very intimate friend of theirs, who had been dead about a\nyear and a half, and whom they have called Dr. H. in the records,\ngave (through Phinuit) a nickname by which he had been called. This\nname was not known to the sitters. On inquiry his widow said it was\nthe name commonly used by his mother and sisters, all dead, but not\n\f352 Richard Hodgson.\nused by anyone living. At a later sitting a test question, which was\nsent for the purpose by the widow of Dr. H., and the answer to which\nwas unknown to the sitters, was correctly answered at the same\nsitting. These incidents were in addition to various personal references\nto his wife and children and other interests,\u2014such as the church and a\nvolume of his poems unpublished before his death, but published\nafterwards,\u2014and some utterances repeated by Phinuit that were so\ncharacteristic of Dr. H., that Dr. Thaw supposed that he had taken\ndirect control of the voice, and asked him for information about\nPhinuit (p. 567).\nAt the sitting which Mr. G. Perkins had on March 18th, 1892, he\npresented a chain which he knew had been worn by his mother,\ndeceased. Phinuit said that both his mother and sister recognised\nthe chain, and that both had worn it. This was true, although Mr.\nPerkins did not know that his sister had also worn it. She died when\nhe was a small child (p. 555). Again, the nurse of Mrs. Thaw's children\npresented a parcel which she supposed contained her mother's hair.\nPhinuit speaking of the sitter's mother said, thrusting his finger\ndown the neck of the sitter, \" Put it in there and wear it, just as she\ntold you to.\" The sitter insisted that Phinuit was wrong, but he tore\nopen the paper and showed that it contained an Agnus Dei, which as\na matter of fact the sitter's mother had told her to wear (p. 573). There\nare other minor instances of the giving of information unknown to\nthe sitters in the records printed in Appendix IV., with an enormous\nmass of correct detail concerning friends and relatives of the sitters,\nand with very little error. Several minor prophecies proved correct ;\none important prophecy concerning the success of certain machines\nwas wrong as to time, as well as other circumstances connected with\nthem ; but another concerning the death of a brother, who was never\npresent at a sitting, was right. This brother was a chronic invalid\nwith asthma. At the sitting of May 10th, 1892, Phinuit said that\nhis kidneys were out of order, and it was discovered for the first time\nthat he had kidney disease on a careful medical examination made two\nweeks later. At the same sitting Phinuit said that he would die\n\" within six months or a year,'' and, in reply to the question how, said,\n\" He's going to sleep, and when he wakes he'll be in the spirit. Heart\nwill stop.\" On May 22nd, the time was given as \"six months or a\nlittle less.\" He died in sleep, of heart failure, on the 3rd of the follow\ning September. At the first sitting which the Thaws had afterwards,\nfour months later, he communicated (p. 580).\nThere are many interesting details regarding what I might speak\nof as related groups of communicators, including persons who knew\nsomething about Mrs. Piper's trances, directly or indirectly, before\ndeath ; and of these I shall give some instances in Part II. of my\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 353\nReport (to be published in the next number of Proceeding^), where I\nshall also give some account of a few other special communicators who\nbelong chiefly to the period of 1 896-7. I close this section of my\nReport by a brief account of the case of the friend whom I have called\nMr. Hart, to whom in the first instance G. P. manifested (p. 296)\nand who himself died in Naples on May 2nd, 1895. As in G. P.'s\ncase, I substitute other names for the real ones. I had not been\nhaving regular series of sittings at this time, and heard incidentally on\nMay 3rd that a cablegram had been received by a relative announcing\nthe death of Hart. My assistant Miss Edmunds went out to Mrs.\nPiper at my request to arrange a sitting for me for the next day, May\n\u2022tth, and to say that it was extremely important that I must have the\nsitting. I did not tell Miss Edmunds the reason, and she made a\ntotally erroneous conjecture concerning it. The announcement of the\ndeath however, with the place, and cause of death (inflammation of\nthe heart), appeared in a Boston evening paper on May 3rd. At the\nsitting on May 4th, after a few words from Phinuit, G.P. wrote and\ngave several messages from friends, and then asked what he could do\nfor me. I replied that I had something for him to do, but could not\ntell him what it was. He made a brief reference to his father and\nmother, and then to a friend of my own, and then came the following :\u2014\nHold, H. See all of these people bringing a gentleman. [R. H. thinks\nthis is unintentionally written, and doesn't repeat the words aloud.]\nRead ... do you see them, H. ? (No.) He is coming here. I\nthink I knew him. [R. H. can't decipher after think.] That I knew him.\nCome here and listen, H. He has been here before and I have seen him\nsince I passed out. (Who is it?) John. \"Do you see me, H. ?\" He says\nthis. (No.) \"What about my health, Oh George, I am here, do not go\naway from me,\" . . . not to you, H., tome. (Yes, I understand.) \"I\nthought I should see you once more before I came here.\" (What is the full\nname ?) John H. (Give me the second name in full.) Did you speak?\n(Write the second name in full.) Hart. (That's right, Hart, old fellow.)\n\" Will you listen to me, Hodg. . . . [Much excitement in hand, and\nletters jumbled over. G. P. writing throughout, but at times apparently\nmuch perturbation introduced.] George knew I was here and met me but I\nwas to weak to come here and talk H.\" . . . Yes, H., but the dear old\nfellow is short breathed. . . . \"I expected to see you before I came\nhere, H. (Yes, I hoped to have met you in the body again) but you see I\nwas failing. How are you ? \"\nWhat [apparently from G. P. to Hart.]\n\" I brought Ge here first.\" (Yes, you did.)\nYes, I do [from G. P. to Hart.] [More probably from Hart to G.P., in\nanswer to some such question as \"do you mean me ?\" from G. P. to Hart.\n1898.]\nOh what about me, H. ?\n(He means your first messages came to him.)\n\f354, [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nOh I see ! but I was . . . but (you were out of the body) yes.\n. . . \"I am a little dull, H., in my head.\" (Isn't the light good to\nday ? ) Yes, but it is I, H., my (you mean you are not in good trim, George ! )\nNo no I Hart no, H. I Hart (I see, Hart is dull, Hart oan't do so well.)\n[H. is the initial of Hart's real name. 1898.] [Thump with fist. Much\nthumping with fist during sitting indicative of assent at different times.]\nThe above is transcribed from the type-written copy of the record\nof the sitting, and the quotation marks were doubtless inserted by\nmyself to make the record clearer. There was much confusion in the\nrest of the sitting. The cause of death he stated to be inflammation\nof the stomach, which was not correct, though he had suffered much\nfrom this for a year before his death. I may have known of this but\nwas not consciously aware of it. I knew that he had been ill in Europe,\nbut when I last heard from him several months previously I under\nstood that he had recovered. There were confused references to the\nHowards. He referred to two other friends in Europe (whose names\nhad been given in previous sittings by G. P.), mentioned several names\nunknown to me, and referred to incidents in connection with them, as\nwell as other matters, none of which, for family reasons, I have yet\nbeen able to verify. I think it probable that they will be partially,\nbut only partially correct. There seemed to be glimpses here and\nthere of a clear consciousness. He wanted to know if it was Paris\n(where he had stayed some time while in Europe). I said it was\nArlington Heights.\n\"Arlington, I remember Arlington\u2014did you not take me here ? (Yes,\nthis is the very room where George came to you). Oh, yes, I had his\n[article of G. P. specifically mentioned] and my watch. . . Will they\nsend my body on to New York ? (I don't know.) I hope they will. They\nare now talking about it.\" [I learned later that the desirability of taking\nthe body to America was discussed.]\nWhen I asked, \"Why didn't George toll me to begin with?\" he\nreplied, \" because I told him to let me come and tell myself.\" This\nwas like Hart, and so was the statement quoted above that it was he\nwho brought G. P. first.\nAt this sitting, and several also in the following week, during which\nthe confusion continued, a knowledge was shown of various matters\nknown to me which were specially suggestive of Hart, references to\nfriends and relatives, presents which he had given me, jokes about\ncigars, magazines which he had entrusted to me just before he went\nto Europe three years previously, etc., but of course I was anxious to\nobtain information concerning events in Europe of which I was\nentirely ignorant, especially any that occurred just before his death ;\nand I have such on record but have not yet succeeded in discovering\nhow much correct statement they include. Between the first and\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 355\nsecond sitting it occurred to me that the announcement of his being\nthere to communicate was \" led up to \" by G. P., and at the second\nsitting, when Hart wrote part of the time himself, I said, \" I suppose\nlast time you thought I took your coming very coolly.\" The hand\nwrote excitedly : \" You seemed very inconsiderate to what you used\nto do.\" I explained that I had heard of his death by a cablegram\nwhich had been received by his \"brother-in-law.\" He then wrote the\nname of the brother of his sister's husband. I said no, \" your wife's\nbrother.\"\nAnother incident at the same sitting showed a curious remem\nbrance.\n. . . Ask for my cigar case . . . am I dreaming ... I think\nI know that one I sat in this corner [hand points to other side of the room,\nto place where Mrs. Piper sat at time when Hart attended his sitting on\nMarch 22nd, 1892.] (You mean you sat there !) Yes I did (yes, I remember)\nI know where I am now.\nAs I recall this incident, I did not understand what was meant at\nfirst when the hand pointed, as it was more than three years since\nMrs. Piper had sat there. That position in the room was not\nassociated specially in my mind with Hart, as various other persons\nwhom I had accompanied to sittings had sat in the same position, both\nbefore and after Hart's sitting, and it was only after April 29th, 1892\n(see p. 292), when I succeeded in getting the hand to write with the\nblock-book on the table instead of on the top of Mrs. Piper's head,\nthat I requested Mrs. Piper to change her position, so that there might\nbe plenty of room for the table and for a sitter on the other side of it.\nBut the occasion was a very memorable one to Hart, and if he was\ncommunicating and waking to a consciousness of his surroundings, it\nwas a natural observation for him to make.\nIn June and July a friend of mine was having a series of sittings,\nand Hart sent a message to me through him ; he was becoming clearer,\nand wished to communicate. There were no opportunities for any\nfurther series of sittings however, and Mrs. Piper stopped sitting for\nher summer rest, and I visited England later. Few sittings were\ngiven in the winter of 1895-6 owing to Mrs. Piper's ill-health. Hart\ngave brief messages on several occasions ; said that he wanted to follow\nin \"G. P.'s tracks,\" and seemed somewhat aggrieved, so to speak,\nbecause he did not have the same opportunity as had been afforded to\nG. P. Thus, on January 22nd, 1896 :\u2014\n. What in the world is the reason you never call for me 1 I am\nnot sleeping. I wish to help you in identifying myself, ... I am a\ngood deal better now. (You were confused at first.) Very, but I did not\nreally understand how confused I was. It is more so, I am more so when I\ntry to speak to you. I understand now why George spelled his words to\n\f356 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nme. [Several sentences, even of ordinary words, were spelt out by Phinuit\nfrom G. P. at his first appearance, to Hart.]\nHe became clearer later on, and purported to take part in an\ninquiry I was making concerning a person's whereabouts in Mexico\n(an account of which will be given in Part II. of this Report). It was\nduring this time that Miss Warner (p. 324) had her two sittings,\nJanuary 6th and 7th, 1897. She remarked to me during the sitting of\nJanuary 7th, 1897, that Hart knew one of her brothers, Charlie, and\nthat they went to the Azotes together. I asked Phinuit if he or G. P.\ncould get Hart. Shortly afterwards G. P. wrote, and after a short\nconversation with the sitter came the following : \u2014\nDid you have a brother Jack, Hart asks. (Yes.)\n[For Hart.] I am here. George tell her I see her and I long to ask her\nbrother if he recalls the storm we experienced.\n(I know he does. I've heard him speak of it.)\nGood, and ask him if he still has the stick like mine. Take the pipe, old\nchap, I do not wish it. Hear you ? (R. H. : Yes, it may be the one he\ngave me) and I have it in my mind. A memento. He ought to have it.\n[Hart gave me a pipe. It is not clear whether the reference is to this, or\nto one connected with sitter's brother.\u2014R. H.]\nWe went to a queer little Hotel, at a little Hotel together. Charlie had\na headache from hunger. We were almost starved when we got there, the\nfood was bad, the food was so bad, poor. I am content here, quite. Do you\never see me as I really am? (No. I don't see you at all.) Not at all. I do.\nH. Hear Hart say have a smoke, anything for relief. Ask him [Charlie]\nabout this for me. Hungry. (R. H. : He's still talking about Charlie and\ntheir experiences together ?) Yes, II. He is.\n(Tell some more.) We went up to the Hotel and ask him if he recalls\nthe laugh we had after we got to our room. Give him my love.\n(What did you laugh about?) because of the dirt etc. . . . very\namusing. He has not been well but he is going to be [Disturbance in\nhand] Hold on, old man, I cannot hear if you grab me in this way.\nDid you ever have a fever ?\n(R. H. : Who says that ?) I, J. H.\n(Do you mean me ?) Yes. (Yes. I had a fever. Pneumonia, and\ntyphoid fever.) Never have another. Going to be well now. I said it.\n(Do you mean me ?) Yes, Charles too. Give him my love and do not forget\nabout the stick.\nMiss Warner wrote :\nI had known that Charley and Hart took a trip in a sailing vessel to the\nAzores but absolutely no details, except that the boat was driven on the\nrocks and they watched her break up.\nThis was all she could recollect in connection with the statements\nmade by Hart about her brother. I remembered also about the ship\nwreck at the Azores, but had no recollections of any sort connecting\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 3o7\nHart with Charley Warner, or about any of the other incidents\nreferred to. I think, however, that as Hart himself told me of the\nshipwreck at the Azores, he probably mentioned Warner in connection\nwith it. He may possibly also have spoken of some of the other\nincidents. But I am unable to recall the vaguest memory of any\nsort about them. Charley Warner was then in California, and in\nreply to inquiries he wrote on February 2nd, 1897 :\u2014\nJ. H. and myself once were hove to on the North Atlantic for about three\ndays during a severe storm. At another time we were at Horta, Fayal\nIsland, and watched our vessel drag ashore and break up on account of a\nvery bad storm, or hurricane. J. H. had a very serviceable stick. As I\nremember it a stout little blade dropped out of the ferrule. I never had one\nlike it that I can remember. He thought highly of it and advised me to get\none like it. I don't remember anything about a pipe. What he says about\nthe queer little hotel is all true ; I don't remember that I had a headache,\nbut we were hungry. J. H. was extremely amused about something at\nthat hotel and we had a hearty laugh. It was connected with dirt.\nThis was the last appearance of Hart. Soon afterwards the\n\"controls\" of Rev. W. S. Moses took supervision of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance. (See p. 408).\nS; 5. The \" Spirit \" Hypothesis and the Hypothesis of Telepathy\nfrom the Living.\nWe may now turn to the more definite consideration of the\nsignificance of such manifestations as I have illustrated.\nIn my previous report on Mrs. Piper's trance (Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII.), in discussing the claims of Phiuuit to be a \"spirit\" and to\nbe in communication with the \" deceased \" friends of sitters, I urged\nthat there were almost insuperable objections to the supposition that\nsuch \" deceased \" persons were in direct communication with Phinuit,\nat least in anything like thefulness of their personality ; but it seemed\nto me a hypothesis that should be continually borne in mind that\nthere might be some actual communication, even if it was only partial\nand fragmentary (loc. ext., p. 57). I am now fully convinced that\nthere has been such actual communication through Mrs. Piper's trance,\nbut that the communication has been subject to certain unavoidable\nlimitations, the general nature of which I shall shortly indicate ; and\nin the remaining portion of this Part I. of my paper I shall consider\nthe main classes of facts which appear to point in this direction,\nreserving Part II. (to be published in the next number of Proceedings)\nfor the consideration of objections which may be brought against this\nview, for the account of some additional and more recent evidential\ncommunications, and for the explanation of certain points in connection\n\f358 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nwith the actual modus operandi of the trance-manifestations, and of\nvarious unusual obscure incidents.\nAnd first I may again say that I think it needless to devote any\nmore special attention to the view that the manifestations in question\ncan be accounted for by the supposition of imposture on the part of\nMrs. Piper. I refer the reader, on this point, to what I have said at\nthe beginning of this paper, and to the previously published reports\nthere mentioned, in which the possibility of accounting for Mrs. Piper's\nphenomena by fraud has been fully considered and rejected. Further\nevidence, were it needed, rendering the \" fraud \" hypothesis yet more\nuntenable, is offered in the records of sittings included in this report.\nRegarding these phenomena, then, as supernormal, I may first\nemphasise the fact that they are much more difficult of explanation\nnow on the assumption that the supernormal knowledge exhibited has\nits source in the minds of living persons than in the earlier years of\nMrs. Piper's trances, when practically the only intermediary was the\nPhinuit personality. With the advent of the G. P. intelligence, the\ndevelopment of the automatic writing, and the use of the hand by\nscores of other alleged communicators, the problem has assumed a very\ndifferent aspect. The dramatic form has become an integral part of\nthe phenomenon. With the hand writing and the voice speaking at\nthe same time on different subjects and with different persons, with the\nhand writing on behalf of different communicators at the same sitting,\nwith different successive communicators using the hand at the same\nsitting, as well as at different sittings, it is difficult to resist the\nimpression that there are here actually concerned various different\nand distinct and individually coherent streams of consciousness. To\nthe person unfamiliar with a series of these later sittings, it may seem\na plausible hypothesis that perhaps one secondary personality might\ndo the whole work, might use the voice and write contemporaneously\nwith the hand, and pretend in turn to be the friends of the various\nsitters ; might in short be a finished actor with telepathic powers,\nproducing the impression not only that he is the character he plays,\nbut that others are with him also, though invisible, playing their\nrespective parts. I do not, however, think it at all likely that he\nwould continue to think it plausible after witnessing and studying the\nnumerous coherent groups of memories connected with different\npersons, the characteristic emotional tendencies distinguishing such\ndifferent persons, the excessive complication of the acting required, and\nthe absence of any apparent bond of union for the associated thoughts\nand feelings indicative of each individuality, save some persistent basis\nof that individuality itself. This general impression, I venture to\nthink, cannot altogether be disregarded ; I am of course conscious in\nmy own case that as regards these trance phenomena I have had a\n\fxxxtil] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 359\npractical experience, very much of which is incommunicable to others,\nbut which has had nevertheless some influence in determining my mind\nto incline to this hypothesis rather than to that. By practical\nexperience here I mean to indicate just what the words ordinarily\nimply, and not the very large mass of information as to specific details\nabout private matters.\nAn operator may talk through a telephone himself, and may talk\nfrequently on behalf of other people, and we may suppose him to be\ncognisant of conversations between numerous other persons who are\ntalking together. He will thus get a practical experience of different\npersonalities which can be separated from his ascertainment of specific\nprivate matters talked about, and which suggests that the speakers at\nthe other end were those whom the callers wished to summon.\nNow, it seems to me that no explanation of Mrs. Piper's pheno\nmena \"begins to be\" plausible which does not take account of these\nvarious apparently separate and individually coherent streams of con\nsciousness,\u2014which, of course, purport to be the \"spirits\" of deceased\nhuman beings. But I think it is easy to frame a hypothesis which\nfulfils the needed requirement, and which does not go beyond the\nconsciousness (subliminal as well as supraliminal) of living persons.\n(I do not, be it observed, regard this hypothesis as the true explana\ntion.) It might be expressed somewhat as follows. The brain\nsymbolically represents that which holds together various states of\nconsciousness associated into some kind of personality. In the separate\nstreams of consciousness, where manifested in connection with a single\norganism, we find evidence of disassociation. The apparently individual\nstar is not single, but double, or triple, or multiple ; or it is a solar\nsystem ; or it may be broken up into a group of asteroids. And we\nfind, in the fragments of Mrs. Piper's broken individuality, the\nvarious quasi deceased friends of the sitters. It may not be necessary\nto assume a different fragment for every communicator. We may\nassume that there are a few fragments such as Phinuit, G. P., and a\ndozen or so others, which have become specially separated ; they are\ndominant groupings of some of the conscious elements of Mrs. Piper,\nwhich by conversation with the living friends of the persons whom\nthey represent, and by knowledge drawn telepathically from those\nfriends and other distant persons, have obtained coherent forms which\nserve as. very good simulations of the deceased persons who they\npurport to be. They acquire the form much as a viscous mass may-\ntake the impress of a mould, and have got considerably hardened.\nBut other forms may be continually more or less changing, taking the\nimpress of new moulds according to the conceptions which new sitters\nhave of their friends, and occasionally some of these may become more\ncoherent and get hardened.\n\f3G0 [part\nRichard Jlodgson.\nThus, if we suppose that A to Z represent the at present available\nfragments of Mrs. Piper's personality, A to N may represent the most\ndefinite and experienced communicators, which have acquired a very\nstable form, and O to Z may represent other plastic combinations\nwhich take on a temporary form only during a sitting.\nTo some such hypothesis I think we are driven if we refuse to\naccept the independent conscious existence of the alleged communi\ncators. But such a hypothesis, besides its complication, is not without\ndifficulties of its own.\nI do not find any evidence tending to show that the bond of\ncontinuity in the case of the most successful communicators depends\nfor its existence upon the minds of living persons. And the hypothesis\nis far from accounting for the efforts of the more confused communi\ncators. The mixtures of truth and error bear no discernible relation\nto the consciousness of the sitters, but suggest the action of another\nintelligence groping confusedly among its own remembrances. And as\nfurther light appears in this confused groping, the bonds of associa\ntion appear more and more to be traceable to no other assignable\npersonality than that of the deceased. It is not this or that isolated\npiece of private knowledge merely, not merely this or that supernormal\nperception of an event occurring elsewhere, not merely this or that\nsubtle emotional appreciation for a distant living friend,\u2014 but the\nunion of all these in a coherent personal pian with responsive intellect\nand character that suggests the specific identity once known to us in a\nbody incarnate.\nTo this it may be replied, however, that the basis of this personality\nmay be, not the conception of this person or that person or the other\npersons who have been brought into relations direct or indirect with\nMrs. Piper's trances, but a composite conception formed from all of\nthese.\nAnd this, I take it, cannot yet be rejected as an impossible\nhypothesis. And when we remember the various forms of hypnotic\ntrance, and the efficacy of subtle suggestion, and reflect upon our\nignorance of our own \" subliminals \" and their possible inter-relations,\ntelepathic or otherwise, we must allow a very wide margin for the\nbuilding up of fictitious personalities. But while I think this hypo\nthesis a legitimate one, I think it highly improbable that it is the true\none ; and I believe that further investigation will show that the very\nreasons given for its adoption by those who may incline to hold it, will\nprove to be the very reasons that will render it more and more\nimprobable. I shall now attempt to justify this somewhat paradoxical\nstatement.\nThose who maintain the hypothesis of telepathy from the living as\nthe most probable, are largely influenced by other considerations than\n\fxxxm.] Observatioyts of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 361\nthose drawn from the case of G. P. They will admit that the evidence\nfor personal identity in his case is strong, but they will urge that\nit is outweighed by the failures of so many others. If all the\ncommunicators through Mrs. Piper's trance had succeeded as well\nas G. P., the hypothesis of telepathy from the living would seem to\nthem much less acceptable.\n\"Why,\" they will say, \"if discarnate persons are really communi\ncating, do they not give us much more evidence 1 We ourselves, if put\nin the witness-box here and cross examined, could do vastly better\neven than G. P., and why have so few others been able to show even\nan approximation to such clearness as he exhibited ? Why all the\nincoherence and confusion and irrelevancy ? Why the mistakes and\nwhy the failures, even in cases where other striking incidents appear\nto suggest the actual presence of the communicator ? Why in some\ncases is there so much that seems distinctly unlike the alleged\ncommunicator ? And why do some sitters get almost nothing that is\ncorrect? Granted that Mrs. Piper is in a genuine trance, and that she\nexhibits a mass of information not obtained by normal means, there\nis so much of lapse and error and complete failure that we cannot\nsuppose that these manifestations emanate from the persons alleged.\nWe cannot isolate one or two fragments. Take the communications as\na whole, and we find them coming very far short indeed of what we\nshould expect from the real friends who once lived with us.\"\nAs I have suggested in the previous section, there are various\ninstances, other than that of G. P., where the \" deceased \" persons\nconcerned have had many opportunities of communicating frequently,\nand have made coherent statements from the beginning, besides many\nother cases where it is strongly suggested by the few opportunities\nwhich alone have been afforded, that the communicator could have\nsupplied much detailed evidence pointing towards his identity if his\nfriends could have had a continuous series of sittings. But even if\nsuch cases were multiplied many times, and even if the results were\nactually comparable with those obtained from G. P., they still would\nnot, I think, furnish an adequate reply to the above statement that\nthe communications, as a whole, fall far short of what we should\nexpect.\nWhat then, are we justified in expecting if discarnate \"spirits\"\ndo indeed return to communicate through Mrs. Piper's trance in the\nways described? And how far do the results actually obtained accord\nwith such expectations ?\nThe answers to these questions I shall content myself at present\nwith briefly indicating, and what I have to say constitutes the general\nreply to which I referred in considering the specific failures of G. P.\n(p. 331).\n\f362 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nIf, indeed, each one of us is a \" spirit \" that survives the death of\nthe fleshly organism, there are certain suppositions that I think we\nmay not unreasonably make concerning the ability of the discarnate\n\"spirit\" to communicate with those yet incarnate. Even under the\nbest of conditions for communication\u2014which I am supposing for the\nnonce to be possible\u2014it may well be that the aptitude for communicat\ning clearly may be as rare as the gifts that make a great artist, or a\ngreat mathematician, or a great philosopher. It may be a completely\nerroneous assumption that all persons, young or old, good or evil,\nvigorous or sickly, and whatever their lives or deaths may have\nbeen, are at all comparable with one another in their capacity to\nconvey clear statements from \" the other world \" to this. Again,\nit may well be that, owing to the change connected with death itself,\nthe \" spirit \" may at first be much confused, and such confusion\nmay last for a long time ; and even after the \" spirit \" has become\naccustomed to its new environment, it is not an unreasonable supposi\ntion that if it came into some such relation to another living human\norganism as it once maintained with its own former organism it\nwould find itself confused by that relation. The state might be\nlike that of awakening from a prolonged period of unconsciousness\ninto strange surroundings. If my own ordinary body could be pre\nserved in its present state, and I could absent myself from it for days\nor months or years, and continue my existence under another set of\nconditions altogether, and if I could then return to my own body,\nit might well be that I should be very confused and incoherent at\nfirst in my manifestations by means of it. How much more would\nthis be the case were I to return to another human body. I might\nbe troubled with various forms of aphasia and agraphia, might be\nparticularly liable to failures of inhibition, might find the conditions\noppressive and exhausting, and my state of mind would probably be\nof an automatic and dreamlike character. Now the' communicators\nthrough Mrs. Piper's trance exhibit precisely the kind of confusion\nand incoherence which it seems to me we have some reason a priori to\nexpect if they are actually what they claim to be. And G. P. himself\nappeared to be well aware of this. Thus he wrote on February 15th,\n1894 : \u2014\n. . . Remember we share and always shall have our friends in the\ndream-life, i.e. your life so to speak, which will attract us for ever and ever,\nand so long as we have any friends sleeping in the material world ;\u2014you\nto us are more like as we understand sleep, you look shut up as one in prison,\nand in order for us to get into communication with you, we have to enter\ninto your sphere, as one like yourself asleep. This is just why we make\nmistakes as you call them, or get confused and muddled, so to put it, H.\n[R. H. repeats in his own language.] Your thoughts do grasp mine. Well\nnow you have just what I have been wanting to come and make clear to you,\n\fxxxtii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 363\nH., old fellow. (It is quite clear.) Yes, you see I am more awake than\nasleep, yet I cannot come just as I am in reality, independently of the\nmedium's light. (You come much better than the others.) Yes, because I\nam a little nearer and not less intelligent than some others here.\nAnd again on February 16th, 1894 :\u2014\n[After a reference to Mr. Marte.] That he with his keen brain and\nmarvellous perception will be interested I know, He was a very dear friend\nof ... I was exceedingly fond of him. Cosmical weather interests\nboth he and I\u2014me\u2014him\u2014I know it all. Don't you see I correct these.\nWell, I am not less intelligent now. But there are many difficulties. I am\nfar clearer on all points than I was shut up in the prisoned body. (Prisoned 1\nprisoning or imprisoning you ought to say.) No, I don't mean to get it that\nway you spoke\u2014perhaps I have spelled it wrong. Prisoned body. Prison\ning. See here, H. \"Don't view me with a critic's eye, but pass my\nimperfections by.\" Of course I know all that as well as anybody on your\nsphere. (Of course.) Well I think so. I tell you, old fellow, it don't do to\npick all these little errors too much when they amount to nothing in one\nway. You have light enough and brain enough I know to understand my\nexplanations of being shut up in this body dreaming as it were and trying to\nhelp on Science.\nWith these statements we may compare a description given long\nago by the Platonic Socrates, of the bewilderment of a \" returning\nsoul.'' Before quoting this, I make a digression for the purpose of\nexplaining an incident which happened to lead my thoughts to this\ndescription. The incident concerns G. P., and a few preliminary\nexplanations are needed.\nG. P. held the \"Mind-Stuff\" theory in somewhat the crude form\nexpressed by Clifford. According to this general theory, the world\nconsists of something which is intrinsically identical with what we\nknow as our own consciousness, and which in its more elementary\nforms may be called mind-stuff. Each one of us consists of a special\ncoherent aggregation of mind-stuff, and this, acting upon another\nsimilar aggregation, produces in it the perception of a human\norganism. Also G. P. and myself had several times spoken together\nof the analogy used by Plato in the 7th Book of the Republic, where\na description1 is given of a cave in which are prisoners, fettered from\nearliest childhood, so that they cannot move, and can look only straight\nbefore them. Behind and above them is a fire, blazing at a distance,\nand between the fire and the prisoners are men passing along with\nvarious kinds of vessels, statues, figures of animals, etc., and casting\ntheir shadows on the wall of the cave. The prisoners have no know\nledge save of the shadows, which to them are the reality. In our\napplication of this, the objects which we perceive in the physical\ni I abridge and quote from Jowett's translation.\n2 li\n\f364 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nuniverse may be like those shadows, and the things to which they\ncorrespond are in reality composed of mind.\nNow in the special discussion which I had with G. P., some two-\nyears before his death, concerning a future life, he maintained that in\naccordance with the \" mind-stuff \" theory, a future life was incon\nceivable, since although the material body with its brain was only the\nshadow of the mind, yet since that shadow went through a process of\ndisintegration, we must conclude that the mental thing corresponding\nto it also went through a process of disintegration. To this I said\nthat we might frame a hypothesis which should be in accord with the\ngeneral mind-stuff theory, and to which such an objection as his could\nnot be urged,\u2014that the gross material body might be the shadow of a\ncoarser and cruder form of mind-stuff, that it might be tenanted by a\nmore subtle organic body composed of the luminiferous ether, that\nsuch etherial body might be the correlate of the human personality,\nand that although the gross material body might disintegrate at\ndeath, the etherial body might not. After a long discussion G. P.\nagreed that such a hypothesis might be made in legitimate accord with\nthe mind-stuff theory, and that it rendered a future life conceivable,\nthough this still seemed to him incredible ; and it was then that he\npledged himself to do all that he could to establish it if he died before\nme, and found that there was a future life after all.\nNow at one of the early sittings in the G. P. series (see Appendix\nI., p. 418), in reply to some questions by Mrs. Howard, as to the\npossibility of his having access to books which had ceased to exist for\nus, such as the Alexandrian library, he replied :\u2014\n\" It does not make any difference how much the material is\ndestroyed. Plato was a philosopher and a good one. You know,\nHodgson, that was our argument, our discussion.\" I said : \" That\ncame in certainly, we used the old Platonic analogy.\"\nThis was a very direct reference to the central point of our\ndiscussion, and is the kind of incidentally evidential remark of which\nthere are many instances in connection with personal matters relating\nto G. P. and his intimate friends. G. P. at this time was using the\nvoice. He followed with the remark : \" Socrates was a medium.\" It\nwas not, I believe, till 1896, when abridging the series of G. P. sittings,\nthat my attention was drawn specially to this last remark, and I\nre-read the account given by Plato. So far as my memory serves, G. P.\nand myself had always referred to Plato (and not Socrates) in connec\ntion with the shadow analogy, and had never thought of considering\nit in connection with any \" mediumistic \" experience. The Platonic\nSocrates, who is giving the description of the cave and the shadows,\nsupposes one of the prisoners in the cave to he released and to be\ncompelled to move up into the light. He describes his distress at the\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 365\nglare, and his inability to see clearly ; the objects in the upper world\nof light will at first appear less real, and he will need to grow\naccustomed to the sight of them. But afterwards he imagines such a\none to be suddenly \" replaced in his old situation ; would he not be\ncertain to have his eyes full of darkness ? . . . And if there were\na contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the\nprisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his sight was\nstill weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which\nwould be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very\nconsiderable) would he not be ridiculous ? Men would say of him that\nup he went and down he came without his eyes ; and that it was\nbetter not even to think of ascending,\" and so on. \" And you will not\nmisapprehend me if you interpret the journey upward to be the ascent\nof the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief,\nwhich, at your desire, I have expressed, whether rightly or wrongly,\nGod knows.\"\nPlato then proceeds to apply this to the relation between the world\nof ideas, illuminated by the Idea of Good, and the world of sense\nwhich ordinary men regard as the sole object of knowledge. But it\nis permissible to suppose that Socrates,\u2014to whom we cannot attribute\nPlato's metaphysical system\u2014may have actually used this analogy to\nrepresent the possible relation between this life and another one,\nespecially if we compare it with some passages in the Phsedo, where\nPlato makes him refer to men in this life as being in a sort of prison,\nand speak of the soul as being made giddy and intoxicated, as it were,\nby the body. (Compare the expressions in the passages quoted from\nG. P. above, p. 362). In any case, however, whatever either the\nPlatonic or the actual Socrates may have said or meant, the analogy\nsuggests a very good description of what I have frequently witnessed\nin connection with Mrs. Piper's trance.\n\" Anyone,\" says Socrates, \" who has common sense will remember\nthat the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and\narise from two causes, either from coming out of the light, or from\ngoing into the light, and he will not be too ready to laugh at a\nperson whose vision is perplexed and weak, or if he have a mind to\nlaugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will\nbe more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who\nreturns from above out of the light into the den.\"\nThe reader may apply this analogy if he pleases to some of the\ncircumstances recorded in the accounts of sittings. Thus he may\nnotice that the observer in the light who is looking at the real things\nmay perceive objects which have not yet cast their shadows on the\nwall of the cave, but which probably will do so ; and he may similarly\nperceive objects which have already cast their shadows but have passed\n2 b 2\n\f366 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nbeyond the shadow line. It may be easier for him to see such objects\nthan to see such as are actually at the moment casting their shadows.\nAnd it is not improbable, as Socrates points out, that he should make\nthe most grotesque failures in estimating the shadows themselves.\nBut we must not forget that this is only an analogy.\nReturning to the actual circumstances, I say that if the \"spirits\"\nof our \" deceased \" friends do communicate as alleged through the\norganisms of still incarnate persons, we are not justified in expecting\nthem to manifest themselves with the same fulness of clear conscious\nness that they exhibited during life. We should on the contrary\nexpect even the best communicators to fall short of this for the two\nmain reasons : (1) loss of familiarity with the conditions of using a\ngross material organism at all\u2014we should expect them to be like\nfishes out of water or birds immersed in it ; (2) inability to govern\nprecisely and completely the particular gross materia] organism which\nthey are compelled to use. They learned when living to play on one\nvery complicated speaking and writing machine, and suddenly find\nthemselves set down to play on another of a different make.\nAnd we should reach a similar conclusion if we suppose that it is\nnot merely the nervous mechanism of the \" medium \" that is acted upon\nby our supposed \"spirits \" (in some such way, whatever that may be,\nthat each one of us acts upon his own material organism),\u2014but the\nconsciousness of the medium that is acted upon by the communicators.\nIn this case we must suppose that the process of communication is\ntelepathic. But from our knowledge of telepathic communications\nbetween embodied persons, even if we include the large number of\nspontaneous experiences of phantasms of the dying, we should certainly\ninfer that no percipient while yet embodied could receive the full and\ncomplete impression of another personality. Such telepathic impressions\nindeed as we are warranted by direct experiment in holding to occur\nbetween one living person and another are of extremely partial and\nfragmentary character, not in any way comparable with even the\nordinary results of Mrs. Piper's trance, and if we suppose the agent\nto be removed to a \" world \" whence he can affect the percipient more\nclearly, we must still suppose that the manifestations through the\npercipient will partake of the percipient's limitations. And here also,\nof course, the modus operandi, whatever it may be, must be a new\nand untried way. Whichever point of view we take,\u2014whether the\nconsciousness of the medium is impressed by the supposed spirit, or\nwhether the consciousness of the medium is entirely absent and her\nnervous mechanism is used as a machine,\u2014 we should expect obscurities\nand deficiencies. If we had, say, an exceptionally good telepathic\npercipient receiving impressions from \"spirite,\" we should not expect\nto find him receiving telepathic impressions from all agents equally ;\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 367\nwe should expect that some agents would be much more successful\nthan others, and should be quite prepared to find that some were not\nsuccessful at all, even after repeated experiments. We should not be\nsurprised at finding, even amidst highly successful results, other\ncompletely wrong guesses, as well as, in partial successes, distortions\npresumably due to the mind of the percipient. We might also expect\nto find occasionally that the percipient received impressions that were\nnot intentionally conveyed. So also in the working of the complex\nnervous mechanism, we should expect to find great differences in\nexpertness of operating. Some persons would begin to understand the\nnew machine at once, whereas others would continue automatically in\nthe habits they had formed with their old machines, and need to\npractise very many times before they could produce coherent results.\nAnd if their productions through the old machines had themselves\nbeen incoherent, still more incoherent might we expect their working\nof the new machine to be.\nIt will be obvious, I think, upon such considerations as these, and\nsimilar ones, that the confusion and failure which we find in Mrs.\nPiper's trance communications, are so far from being what we should\nnot expect, that they are exactly what we should expect, if the alleged\nspirits are communicating.\nBut to all this it may be replied : \" Granted that the results\nobtained are in accordance with what we should expect if they come\nfrom ' spirits.' It still remains an open question whether they do come\nfrom 'spirits.' All that you say applies equally well to the hypothesis\nthat living persons only are concerned. The same partial and frag\nmentary character that you allege must be exhibited if the supernormal\ninformation in question comes from spirits, must also be exhibited if\nit comes from the minds of living persons, and since we do not doubt\nthe existence of the minds of living persons, but do doubt the existence\nof ' spirits,' we adopt the hypothesis of telepathy from the living.\"\nTo this I answer that the character of the results would not be\nthe same. The results would be fragmentary in both cases, but not\nfragmentary in the same way.\nAnd herein we find, as I think, what will eventually prove to be\nthe differentiating characteristics that point to the \"spirit\" hypothesis\nas the true explanation. I say eventually, because I think that there\nis at present not by any means enough material on hand to justify a\npositive conclusion. This point is so important that I devote a separate\nsection to it. But first let me give a brief summary up to the stage\nwe have reached.\nMrs. Piper has been giving sittings for a period extending over\nthirteen years. Very early in her trance history she came under the\nattention of Professor James, who sent many persons to her as\n\f368 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nstrangers, in most cases making the appointments himself, and in no\ncase giving their names. She came to some extent under my own\nsupervision in 1887, and I also sent many persons to her, in many\ncases accompanying them and recording the statements made at their\nsittings, and taking all the care that I could to prevent Mrs. Piper's\nobtaining any knowledge beforehand of who the sitters were to be.\nIn 1889-90 Mrs. Piper gave a series of sittings in England under the\nsupervision of Dr. Walter Leaf and Mr. Myers and Professor Lodge,\nwhere also the most careful precautions possible were taken to ensure\nthat the sitters went as strangers to Mrs. Piper. Further sittings\nwere supervised by myself in 1890-91 after Mrs. Piper's return to\nAmerica. Many persons who had sittings in the course of these\nearlier investigations were convinced that they were actually receiving\ncommunications from their \" deceased \" friends through Mrs. Piper's\ntrance, but although the special investigators were satisfied, from their\nstudy of the trance-phenomena themselves and a careful analysis of\nthe detailed records of the sittings, that some supernormal power was\ninvolved, there was no definite agreement as to their precise signifi\ncance. And to myself it seemed that any hypothesis that was offered\npresented formidable difficulties in the way of its acceptance. In the\ncourse of these earlier investigations, the communications were given\nalmost entirely through the speech-utterance of the trance-personality\nknown as Phinuit, and even the best of them were apt to include much\nmatter that was irrelevant and unlike the alleged communicators,\nwhile there were many indications that Phinuit himself was far from\nbeing the kind of person in whom we should be disposed to place\nimplicit credence.\nDuring the years 1892-1896 inclusive, I exercised a yet closer\nsupervision of Mrs. Piper's trances than I had done in previous years,\ncontinuing to take all the precautions that I could as regards the\nintroduction of persons as strangers. This period was marked by a\nnotable evolution in the quality of the trance results, beginning early\nin 1892. The character of the manifestations changed with the\ndevelopment of automatic writing in the trance, and with what was\nalleged to be the continual rendering of active assistance by the\ncommunicator whom I have called G. P. As a result of this it\nappeared that communicators were able to express their thoughts\ndirectly through the writing by Mrs. Piper's hand, instead of conveying\nthem more dimly and partially through Phinuit as intermediary ; and\nthe advice and guidance which they, apparently, received from G. P.,\nenabled them to avoid much of the confusion and irrelevancy so\ncharacteristic of the earlier manifestations. I may remind the reader\nof the striking evidence of different kinds furnished by the communi\ncating G. P. (p. 328), and of the brief indications which I have given\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 369\nin the previous section of this report that other communicators have\npresented strong characteristics of personal identity. Among these are\nmore than half-a-dozen intimate friends of my own, who have produced\nupon me the impression, through different written communications, that\nthey are the personalities I knew, with characteristic intelligence and\nemotion, questioning me and answering me under difficulties, but with\ntheir peculiar individual and responsive minds in some sense actually\nthere. Now, to give Phinuit his due, notwithstanding all his short\ncomings and delinquenciesi, I was inclined to think, even before the\npublication of my previous report, that Phinuit believed himself\nto be a \"spirit.\" (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 57.) But there was\nso much that was inferior about him that one could not attribute\nany force, on the ground of either his intelligence or his sincerity, to\nhis persistent affirmations that he was a \" spirit \" and giving communi\ncations from \"spirits.\" But we must, I think, allow some weight to\nsuch statements when they are made persistently by a continually\nincreasing number of coherent personalities manifesting directly\nthrough Mrs. Piper's trance, and characterised by a high moral tone, a\npervading sincerity, and a deep earnestness of purpose, who indi\nvidually insist that they are the persons we knew in bodies incarnate \u2022\nwhen they all make their statements from the point of view that\nwould naturally belong to such persons under the conditions in which\nthey claim to be ; and when they stoutly resist any suggestions to the\ncontrary. Those who adopt the hypothesis of telepathy from the\nliving must clearly recognise the fulness and completeness of many of\nthe personalities which they suppose to be fictitiously formed in\nconnection with Mrs. Piper's trance, and the inversion, as it were, of\nthe conceptions of living persons ; so that there is produced this\nmarvellous simulation of the \"deceased,\" accompanied not only by\ntheir specific memories, but by the presentation of each character in\nits unity, showing a clear self-consciousness, a working intelligence of\nits own, and a morality in no case less than that of the persons\n,concerned when living, but showing rather a more definite upward\nmovement, a stronger determination towards the \" things that are\nhigher.\" And yet with all this apparently complete independence and\ni Phinuit has of course been frequently commented upon by other communicators,\nand sometimes apparently resented somewhat the statements made about him. See\nthe sitting of December 16th, 1892, (Appendix I., p. 429). G. P. there began to\nmake some remarks about Phinuit, which were apparently followed by a struggle in\nMrs. Piper's organism, after which there was quiet, and G. P. who was writing,\nwrote (and emphatically underlined it) This is a tabula rasa. Later on he used the\nvoice. On January 14th, 1894, G. P. wrote: \"I don't think it wise for you to ask\nDr. Phinuit much now he is inclined to try too much at times, H, and thinks he\nhears things when they are not close enough to him. He is a mighty good fellow,\nbut exaggerates a little occasionally when he is dull. Better not tell him I say this.\"\n(Compare Proceedings Vol. VI., pp. 517, 552-3.)\n\f370 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\npower of reasoning and lofty ethical aspirations, they must be regarded\nas either lying or mistaken about the fact of their existence itself,\nand must be assumed to be, one and all, merely fragments of Mrs.\nPiper.\nBut the reply to this consists in the statement, firstly, that these\ncommunicators themselves are unable to do things which they could\nhave done when living, they make mistakes which, living, they would\nnot have made, and they show deficiencies in other ways ; and,\nsecondly, that there are numerous other communicators who present\nvery little evidence of being what they claim to be, and many who may\nbe said to be entirely without any verisimilitude whatever ; that the\nmanifestations must be taken as a general group together, and, as such,\nare very different from anything we should expect if the communicators\nwere really \" spirits.\"\nIn answer to this I have adduced various considerations which\nmake it clear that the partial and fragmentary character which we find\nin these manifestations as a whole is, on the contrary, precisely what\nwe should expect if the communicators are the persons they claim to\nbe, manifesting in our world by difficult and unfamiliar modes, and\nhampered by restricting conditions, of which there may be many\nunknown to us, but of which some are very obvious.\nThis being agreed upon, it is then urged in reply that the results\nobtained at the sittings are also such as might be supposed on the\nhypothesis of telepathy from the living, which, therefore, still remains\nin the field as a legitimate hypothesis.\nTo this I answer that the results in question might in truth be\nexpected to be partial and fragmentary on either hypothesis, but that\nthe deficiencies would be of different character in the two cases. In\none case we have a relation between the \"medium\" and a group of\n\" deceased \" persons ; in the other case, a relation between the\n\"medium\" (or percipient) and groups of living persons. Since the\ngroups are different from each other, the results must also be different,\nand we have now to inquire whether any indications exist which seem\nto point to the one group of agents rather than the other.\n\u00a76. Indication's that the \"Spirit\" Hypothesis is true.\nIf we suppose an extension of telepathy between one living person\nand another far beyond what we have been able to produce experi\nmentally\u2014a telepathy which shall involve not only specific impressions\nfrom many distant persons who have never been near the percipient,\nbut also realistic conceptions of numerous persisting personalities with\ntheir own individual streams of consciousness and abiding reservoirs of\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 371\nmemories, personalities moreover which, so far as we can ascertain,\ncontinue to (frow,\u2014then indeed, on this arbitrary supposition, we might\ntheoretically explain the success connected with any single communi\ncator. If all communicators were equally successful, or if they were\nsuccessful with the same living persons as sitters, but not with others,\nthe indications would not point so strongly as they actually do to the\n\" Spirit \" hypothesis. It is the very failures which, when contrasted\nwith the successes, point away from the living to the \" dead.\" The\ncomplex mass of manifestations falls into systematic order if we relate\nthem to the supposed still existing personalities of the dead, and they\nfall into no systematic order in relation to the consciousnesses of the\nliving. There are perturbations in the results which vary according to\nthe invisible personalities who claim to be there, and not according to\nvisible living persons.\nAnd here I must clear the ground by a few preliminary con\nsiderations, referring to classes of cases that may be regarded as\nneutral, in the sense of not favouring one view more than the other.\nThere are certain persons who appear to be almost entirely unsuccessful\nas regards communications from their \" deceased \" friends, and indeed\nat \" sittings \" altogether, and from causes which apparently inhere in\nthemselves. This might be expected on either hypothesis. The agent\nin ordinary thought-transference experiments could scarcely look for\nsuccess if he amused himself with other matters instead of trying to\nimpress the percipient ; and the sitter should not expect his remem\nbrances of the dead to be reproduced by Mrs. Piper's percipient\ntrance-personality unless his mind is actively concerned with them.\nAnd so the sitter who hopes for a communication from a \"deceased \"\nfriend can scarcely expect to get it unless his thoughts and emotions\nare directed towards that friend with longing sympathy. It may well\nbe supposed that such a friend though living in \" another world \" may\nbe conscious of such an appeal, but it would be unreasonable to suppose\nthat the \" dead \" are perpetually waiting upon the living, whether the\nlatter are longing for their presence or not. And it may even be that\nthe state of mind of some persons is actually repellent to the efforts\nwhich their \" deceased \" friends make to communicate, as I have\nwitnessed, I believe, on more than one occasion ; and in many cases\nis not very helpful.\nParenthetically I may say that there are of course many cases\nwhere communicators appear who were not in the conscious minds\nof the sitters, and these taken together point as a group to the\nexistence of independent intelligences. Such has been especially the\ncase with communicators who have previously met friends at sittings,\nand who thus \" know the way,\" and return either to recognise new\nsitters, or to send messages to other living friends. The cases of\n\f372 [part\nRichard llodyson.\nLouis R. (p. 337) and MacDoaough (p. 340) are instances of what\nI mean. There are numerous other examples in my records. Be it\nobserved that I am not now arguing that because certain incidents\nwere not in the conscious minds of the sitters, they indicate an intelli\ngence independent of sitters and medium. It is plain throughout the\nreports that the communications do not directly depend upon the\nsupraliminal consciousness of the sitters, and that the facts, if they\nare to be accounted for by telepathy from the living, demand at least\nthe supposition that the subliminal consciousness of the sitters may be\ndrawn upon for information and also the minds of distant living\npersons. I am now considering a particular class of those facts, and\nasking whether they point to the action of extraneous intelligences or\nto thought-transference from living persons to Mrs. Piper's personality.\nI give another instance to make my meaning quite clear. Miss\nEdmunds was holding a sitting on behalf of a lady entirely uncon\nnected with G. P. and his group of friends. O. P. wrote a little. Ab\nMrs. Piper was coming out of the trance, the voice shouted excitedly,\n\"Tell Aleck Bousser [pseudonym, the A. B. mentioned pp. 319, 334].\ntell Aleck Bousser not to leave them alone.\" Miss Edmunds knew\nnothing of Aleck Bousser, but he was well-known to me. He was an\nintimate friend of G. P. and was also the husband of Madame\nFrederica, the living sister of Madame Elisa (p. 335), for whom\nG. P. had acted as amanuensis on more than one occasion. I sent\nthe message immediately to A. B., and received the following\nreply :\u2014\nThere certainly do happen to be some people I just was happening to\nhave been debating about in my own mind in a way that makes your short\nmessage perfectly significant and natural. I am sorry thus to be obliged to\nfeed your credulity, for I hate your spirits.\nI understood, as it was described later, that Madame Elisa arrived\nwith this message too late to give it herself, and G. P. gave it to\nthe \"returning consciousness \" of Mrs. Piper in the same way that he\ngave the name Peirce (pp. 305-6). That Madame Elisa should select\nsome significant circumstance in connection with living friends or\nrelatives is intelligible ; but to suppose that a fragment of Mrs. Piper's\npersonality selects it is not intelligible,\u2014it is not explanatory, and\nsuggests no order.\nReturning to the first class of cases which I mentioned, then, it\nseems clear that either the failure or the success, in getting the\nperson desired as the alleged communicator, is explicable on either\nhypothesis.\nSimilarly, in many cases, the correct answers to special questions,\nwhen known to the inquirer at the sitting, may also be regarded as\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 373\nexplicable on either hypothesis. For example, when Mrs. Howard\nasked G. P. if he could tell the name of a certain book which she\nplaced on Mrs. Piper's head without bringing it into Mrs. Piper's field\nof vision at all, and the correct answer at once came that it was\nhis \" French Lyrics,\" it might be regarded as a case of direct thought-\ntransference from Mrs. Howard, or as a case of knowledge shown by\nthe* independent G. P.\nThe cases which seem in themselves to suggest merely thought-\ntransference from the sitters are exceedingly rare, and even these are\nnearly all explicable otherwise. For example, the letter from Mr.\nPelham given to G. P., which the Howards supposed to be about G. P.\nhimself (p. 320), but which was a letter about business matters, did\nnot lead to any statement about business matters from G. P., but to\nstatements referring to the contents of the contemporary letter which\nMrs. Howard thought she had presented. But the letter may have\nserved, as G. P. at the time said it did, to bring him \" nearer to his\nfather,\" and to get at his father's state of mind. Still we may well\nsuppose that some cases are, as a matter of fact, due to direct thought-\ntransference from sitters. I have no doubt that the emotional state of\nsitters is usually readily discerned by the communicating intelligence,\nand think it probable that in rare cases, analogous to occasional\ninstances of thought-transference between living friends, the person\nality purporting to communicate is affected by specific information\npossessed by the sitter.\nThere is further another type of case which is explicable equally\nwell on either hypothesis, where a test is given that the sitter thinks\nmight be given,\u2014though not specially asked for, except in general\nterms. For example, a club friend of my own named Otis made\nseveral brief communications at sittings. I asked him for a test, and\nhe replied by reminding me of the \" sword-dance.\" He had on a\nprevious occasion referred spontaneously and naturally to the fellows\nat the club and the Christmas festivities, but did not then refer to the\nsword-dance, though that was in my mind. He was my vis-a-vis in a\nsword-dance given by ourselves and six other members of the club in\nconnection with some Christmas festivities. Now if Otis had asked\nme how he could know that I was Hodgson, I should have replied\n\" sword-dance,\" as that was the only special matter between us in\nwhich we were both particularly concerned. But where the communi\ncators have other personal and striking remembrances in common with\nthe sitter,- we find that such a coincidence rarely happens, or I should\nsay that there is no indication that it happens more frequently than\nwe should expect on the hypothesis that the communicator is drawing\nupon his own remembrances. Very frequently, indeed, the answer\ngiven by the communicator to a particular question strongly suggests\n\f374 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nin itself an independent mind. For example, when Mrs. W. L. P.\nasked Louis R. for the German nickname by which he used to call her\nhusband, he referred, not to the one of which she was thinking,\nbut to another, Up and Dust (p. 338). Again, when Miss Vance\n(p. 437) asked G. P. for the name of a decease I college friend of her\nbrother Ken, G. P. answered Harry Guild. This was the name of\nanother college friend who died in 1883. The one of whom Miss\nVance was thinking died in 1887, and his first name, Charles, was\ngiven by G. P. after he was told that Harry Guild was not the name\nintended, although a correct answer. Similarly, in the case mentioned\nby Professor Nichols (p 535). He and his mother one Christmas-\nexchanged rings, and each had engraved in his gift the first word of\nthe giver's favourite proverb. Professor Nichols lost, many years\nbefore the sitting, the ring which he had received from his mother.\nWhen his mother died, a year before the sitting, the ring which he had\ngiven her was at her request taken from her finger and returned to\nhim. This ring he held in his hand at the sitting\u2014having, as he\nsays, \" in mind only that, ring,\"\u2014and asked what was written in his\nmother's ring. His mother at the moment purported to be using the\nhand, which immediately \" slapped down on the paper,\" not the word\nin the ring which he was holding, but ,' the word in t\/ie other riny \"\nwhich his mother had originally given him and which \" had been\nlost years ago while travelling. As the word was a peculiar one,\ndoubtfully ever written in any ring before, and as she wrote it in\nsuch a flash, it was surely curious.\" It might be said that wherever\nthe correct statements made by the communicator were known to\nthe communicator when living, and are not, or have not just been,\nin the conscious mind of the sitter, although once known to the sitter,\nthey make for the hypothesis of an independent intelligence. I think\nmyself that they do, at least to some extent, but I am assuming for\nthe present that the subliminal consciousness of the sitter may be\ndrawn upon by the \" medium.\"\nPutting aside then, as not pointing definitely to either of the views\nwe are considering, any cases of complete failure, and cases of partial\nor complete success of the ordinary kind where information is given\nabout facts once known to the sitter, we come to a type of failure that\nappears to me to point distinctly to the agency of the \"dead.\" Take\nsuch cases as I have described on pp. 319-50. The sittings which I held\nfor the purpose of obtaining communications from A., were held under\ncircumstances which seemed favourable, so far as I could judge, in\nother respects. Other communicators manifested clearly at some of the\nsittings. My own mind, as well as the minds of distant living relatives\nand friends of his, according to the hypothesis of telepathy from the\nliving, might have been drawn upon. If the information given to me\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 375\nat some of these sittings, and at other times from other persons, about\nprivate incidents in my own life, many of which I believe to have been\nknown to no other person living but myself, and about an enormous\nnumber of other matters concerning myself and deceased friends\nwhich, if not exclusively known to myself alone, are of so intimate\na character that I have no doubt that they must be assigned to some\nsupernormal origin,\u2014if, I say, all this information came from my own\nmind,\u2014then it is unintelligible that definite information could not be\n\" given back \" to me concerning A. To suppose that the mass of\nfacts associated in my mind, supraliminal and subliminal, with A., and\nbound by strong sympathy, should result in incoherencies of expression\nfrom \"A.\" when contemporary communications from other persons\nwere clear, is not explanatory. The circumstances suggest a confusion\nin the actual communicator A., and when we remember that his head\nfrequently troubled him for some years before his death, and when\nwe find a similar confusion manifesting itself in connection with other\ncommunicators who suffered for a long time under confusing bodily\nconditions, the facts begin to fall into order. In some respects, of\ncourse, each example stands by itself, and, as I have stated, I do\nnot think that we have enough material yet to apply any calculus\nof probabilities, but I hope that such material as I have on hand\nmay be largely increased by further investigations and by other\ninvestigators. The causes of confusion in communicators are still very\nobscure ; but prolonged bodily disturbance, especially if associated\nwith mental disturbance, in the communicator while living, seems\ninvariably to be followed by confusion in his early attempts at\ncommunication.\nTake a case like that of the communicator at M. Bourget's sitting\n(p. 495). The communicator, a lady, apparently tried to write herself,\nbut was unable to produce anything more than two or three French\nwords, among them what seemed to be mon dieu. Very little that\nwas coherent could be obtained from her. G. P. nevertheless correctly\nstated that she was a beautiful lady who was an artist by profession,\nthat she had very expressive eyes and short hair, combed and parted\ncuriously on the side, that she had a severe trouble with her head,\nfollowed by confusion, and that in a fit of insanity she jumped out of\na gondola or boat. Only the first syllable of Bourget could be obtained,\nand another communicator, who apparently offered to render assistance\nas being a good French scholar \u2014 as G. P. was not\u2014succeeded only in\ngetting the lady's first name, for which M. Bourget asked. He was\nthinking of Matilda. The name given was Tillie. \" Venice \" was the\nanswer to another question put by M. Bourget, and \" Venice \" was\nwritten spasmodically at the end of the sitting, probably by G. P.\n(see p. 310).\n\f376 [pabt\nRichard Hodgson.\nVarious cases of communications from suicides have come under my\nattention, at least six, in three of which repeated opportunities have\nbeen given for communication, and in which the details of nearly all\nthe sittings are known to me. I have, besides, five cases of prolonged\nbodily disturbance where many opportunities have also been given for\ncommunication, and where I am also familiar with all the results. In\nfour of the eight cases where many opportunities to communicate were\ngiven, the alleged communicators were intimate friends of my own, and\nanother I knew very well ; and my own mind was full of clear and\nvivid memories concerning them. In two cases I had never met the\npersons concerned when living, but I knew intimately living friends of\ntheirs whose minds might have been drawn upon for clear statements\naccording to the hypothesis of telepathy from the living In one of these\ncases the friends themselves had repeated sittings. In the remaining\ncase I knew the person when living, though not intimately, and I knew\na good deal about him. In all these cases the confusion persisted\nthrough varying conditions of Mrs. Piper's trance, and while clear\ncommunications were received from other persons ; and yet, so far as\nthe sitters' minds were concerned, there seemed no assignable reason\nwhy the communications were not clear originally, or did not soon\nbecome clear, if dependent upon living persons. Similarly in other\ncases, where the mental disturbance was less pronounced, or where we\ncan scarcely suggest, owing to our ignorance of the circumstances,\nwhat the precise cause of the inadequacy of the communicator might\nbe. Probably in many cases,\u2014and this applies particularly to the\ngroup of clearer communicators, between whom we find individual\ndifferences\u2014the skill in \" controlling \" the nervous mechanism of the\nmedium is as little traceable to any external differences discernible in\nthe persons known to us when living, as would be, say, the ability to\nplay the violin well. And thus we get all varieties of communication ;\nsome of them, purporting to come from persons who when living\nwere much mentally disturbed, suggesting the incoherency of delirium ;\nothers of them, purporting to come from persons who have been dead\nvery many years, suggesting a fainter dreaminess ; others, purporting\nto come from persons recently deceased whose minds have been clear,\nshowing a corresponding clearness in communication. Even these last\nindeed require some practice in handling the writing mechanism, and\nat first the assistance of G. P. or some other experienced amanueosis\nhas usually been required.\nBut I am anxious to avoid any misunderstanding as to the causes\nof failure in communicators. I have referred to certain extreme types\nof persisting confusion as indicating most markedly the actual presence\nof the communicators, inasmuch as in these cases there have been\nrepeated opportunities for communication, in some cases with different\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 377\nsitters, and under numerous varying conditions. Thus, to take one\ncase, at the time of my earliest sittings for C. (p. 350), I believe that\nI was unaware that he had taken his own life. And in other cases the\nconfusion in the communicator was not consciously expected in any\nway by the sitters, including myself, who were on the contrary entirely\nunable to understand the strange incoherencies and irrelevancies that\npurported to come from their \" deceased \" friends, rather than the\nclear utterance, and the sweeping recollections of which we ourselves\nwere so vividly conscious, and of which we looked to see some striking\nmanifestation from that \"superior world\" to which our friends had\ngone. My own conclusion as to what might be anticipated in such\ncases, where the communicators when living suffered from prolonged\nbodily weakness or extreme mental disturbance, is a late induction\nof my own, forced upon me by experience, and strengthened by various\nstatements of the communicators themselves concerning the causes of\nconfusion.\nIn most other cases, not of this extreme type, where only one or two\nopportunities have been given for communication, and where there has\nnot been any prolonged mental disturbance, or any mental disturbance\nat all, the incipient confusion is fully accounted for by the necessary\nconditions of communicating, if the persons alleged are actually there,\ntrying to express themselves for the tirst time through an unfamiliar\norganism. And when opportunity is given for further communication,\npart of this confusion seems to clear away, and what remains is what\nwe should expect under the circumstances. I now refer to various\ninstances of this in illustration. In some cases the confusion is.\ncomparatively slight, in others it is very marked. Thus, there was a\ncertain amount of confusion in G. P.'s first communications to Mr.\nHart, and one of the statements suggested to the Howards a time\nwhen G. P. had been ill at their house. Similarly at the first sitting\nof Mrs. M. (p. 341), her brother wrote although she was hoping for\nsome communication from her husband, and the confusion, as she says,\nreminded her painfully of the last hours of her brother's illness which\nhad been passed in delirium. This was obviously contrary to any con\nscious expectation of Mrs. M., and if it be urged that it was drawn\ntelepathically from her subliminal consciousness, we ask why was that\nparticular group selected by the medium.\nAgain, that persons just \" deceased \" should be extremely confused\nand unable to communicate directly, or even at all, seems perfectly\nnatural after the shock and wrench of death. Thus in the case of\nHart (p. 353), he was unable to write the second day after death. In\nanother case (p. 440) a friend of mine, whom I may call D., wrote,\nwith what appeared to be much difficulty, his name and the words,\n\" I am all right now. Adieu,\" within two or three days of his death.\n\f378 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nIn another case, F., a near relative of Madame Elisa (p. 335), was\nunable to write on the morning after his death.i On the second day\nafter, when a stranger was present with me for a sitting, he wrote two\nor three sentences, saying, \" I am too weak to articulate clearly,\" and\nnot many days later he wrote fairly well and clearly, and dictated also\nto Madame Elisa, as amanuensis, an account of his feelings at finding\nhimself in his new surroundings. Both D. and F. became very clear\nin a short time. D. communicated later on frequently, both by writing\nand speech, chiefly the latter, and showed always an impressively\nmarked and characteristic personality. Hart, on the other hand, did\nnot become so clear till many months later. I learned long afterwards\nthat his illness had been much longer and more fundamental than I\nhad supposed. The continued confusion in his case seemed explicable\nif taken in relation with the circumstances of his prolonged illness,\nincluding fever, but there was no assignable relation between his con\nfusion and the state of my own mind.\nThe more or less incoherent writings of different communicators\nappear to me to be invaluable as regards the light that they throw\nupon the workings of consciousness in the communicators and upon the\nprocess of communication itself, but the readers of these Proceedings\nmay probably find it tedious to read even the examples I have given in\nthe Appendices, where a little of the detailed direct writing of first\ncommunicators is reproduced. Take the sittings of Mr. Mitchell (pp.\n517-23). At his first sitting, held in the afternoon, Phinuit was unable\nto use the voice, owing to the lack of \"light.\" Mrs. Piper had become\npartially entranced in the morning unintentionally, and Mr. Mitchell\nand myself waited for more than two hours before the trance began.\nThe communicator purported to be the wife of the sitter, recognised her\nhusband, giving his name James, gave her own name as Margaret, and\nas M. M.\u2014all correct\u2014made attempts to write the name Edith (that of\na living daughter), writing E.M. and ddie and ed, and \"our ddie,\" and\ni The notice of his death was in a Boston morning paper, and I happened to see\nit on my way to the sitting. The first writing of the sitting came from Madame\nElisa, without my expecting it. She wrote clearly and strongly, explaining that F.\nwas there with her, but unable to speak directly, that she wished to give me an\naccount of how she had helped F. to reach her. She said that she had been present\nat his death-bed, and had spoken to him, and she repeated what she had said, an\nunusual form of expression, and indicated that he had heard and recognised her.\nThis was confirmed in detail in the only way possible at that time, by a very intimate\nfriend of Madame Elisa and myself, and also of the nearest surviving relative of F.\nI showed my friend the account of the sitting, and to this friend, a daj' or two later,\nthe relative, who was present at the death-bed, stated spontaneously that F. wlun\ndying said that he saw Madame Elisa who was speaking to him, and he repeated\nwhat she was saying. The expression so repeated, which the relative quoted to my\nfriend, was that which I had received from Madame Elisa through Mrs. Piper's\ntrance, when the death-bed incident was of course entirely unknown to me.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 379\n\"she was very ill, but will get well.\" She had been very ill, and was\n\" about recovered.\" The communicator apparently tried to write her\nname at the beginning, but wrote \" Mit, Mitel. I am she.\" Mrs.\nMitchell died of cancer, and in the writing came \" no more cancel's\n\u2014you know, dear.\" Several other names were also mentioned that were\nunknown to the sitter. The special confusion was in my view owing\nto two circumstances : (1) the lack of \" light\" ; (2) the inexperience of\nthe communicator. At Mr. Mitchell's second sitting, five days later,\nthe results were much clearer. Phinuit gave the name Margaret\nMitchell quite distinctly, and in reply to the sitter's demand for a test,\nhis \"wife,\" writing, correctly referred to the little house where they\nfirst lived and the little stoop where she used to sit, and in reply to the\ndemand for a pet name he called her, she wrote that he called her\nMaggie first, as was true, and then wrote Dellie, the pet name to which\nthe sitter referred being Dollie. She also referred to \" the baby,\" as\nwith her ; a little grandchild who had died a year previously was\nalways thus spoken of in the family. There was some writing also\nfrom the sitter's son George, whose name was correctly given and who\nreferred to his brother James correctly as being \"with us.\" The sitter\nhad taken a gold watch to the sitting which \"George\" rightly claimed\nand then referred to a silver watch which he had owned, also true, though\nof little evidential value. The middle initial of his name was given\nfirst as A and then as I, before being given correctly as S. A name\nDavidson, which was unknown, was mentioned in connection with the\nwatch, and later on the name Rich, a gentleman well known in the\nsitter's family, with Robert, which apparently had no special signifi\ncance. In the writing came : \" My lungs are well,\" and \" Do you think\nconsumption a bad thing?\" George had died of consumption. In\nreply to questions as to where he went for his health and whom he met\nthere, he stated correctly that it was South, and gave the name Wilson\n(correct), after several attempts at words beginning with a \"W.\" This\nwas followed by a little obscurer writing at the end of the sitting from\n\"James,\" the other son of the sitter, who placed a notebook on the\nhand and asked what it was. \" My accounts and description of a trip\nto \" . . . The next words were undecipherable. The book was one of\nseveral containing a journal of a voyage to China via Australia. The\nimportant matter about sittings like these and many similar ones\nappears to me to be not so much the mere facts that are offered, false\nor true, but the matrix in which they are imbedded ; and this cannot\nbe appreciated without a careful study of the detailed reports them\nselves. Thus, in the second sitting, G. P. is represented as rendering\nassistance. \"All right, I remember, but it is hard to put it as Pelham\nasks me\u2014WILSON.\" The communicator has difficulty in repro\nducing the name Wilson clearly through the writing mechanism, and\n2 c\n\f380 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nGS. P., as on many occasions at other sittings, tells him to make capital\nletters. Compare this with the early part of Mr. C.'s sitting (p. 514)\nwhere the communicator, after greeting the sitter naturally, tries to\nwrite his own name.\nDon't you remember me Duane ? I will, D W A I N E, D-W- I am\nbothered. This is jt, it alone, DUANE.\nI reproduce this with explanatory comments.\nDon't you remember me Duane ? [Sitters not sure of word Duanc.\nG.P. tells communicator to put it in capitals. Communicator says to G.P.:]\nI will [and tries. Writing mechanism spells out] DWAINE [sjtters spell\nout the letters. Communicator tries again.] D W [Sitters spell out the\nletters. Communicator says to himself or to G. P.] I am bothered. [Per\nhaps to himself] This is it, it alone. [Final successful effort] DUANE\n[correct name].\nI shall say more about the writings themselves in Part II. of un\nreport, but this instance will suffice here to illustrate the fact that\nthere is often a confusion in result which is not the confusion of the\ncommunicator's mind. There are, indeed, three kinds of confusion that\nneed to be distinguished by the investigator : (1) the confusion in the\n\" spirit,\" whether he is communicating or not, due primarily to his\nmental and bodily conditions when living ; (2) the confusion in the\n\"spirit\" produced by the conditions into which he comes when in the\nact of communicating ; (3) the confusion in the result due to the failure of\ncomplete control over the writing (or other) mechanism of the meaium.\n(2) and (3) are increased very much by the failures of sitters to\nunderstand the process. Thus when \" Mrs. Mitchell \" was requested\nto repeat words which we had difficulty in deciphering, she wrote:\u2014\nNo, I can't, it is too much work and too weakening, and I cannot repeat\u2014\nyou must help me and I will prove myself to you. I cannot collect my\nthoughts to repeat sentences to you. My darling husband, I am not away\nfrom you, but right by your side. Welcome me as you would if I were with\nyou in the flesh and blood body. [Sitter asks for test]. * * * I cannot\ntell myself just how you hear me, and it bothers me a little . . . how\ndo you hear me speak, dear, when we speak by thought only ? But your\nthoughts do not reach me at all when I am speaking to you, but I hear a\nstrange sound and have to half guess.i .\nOf such confusions as I have indicated above I cannot find any\nsatisfactory explanation in \" telepathy from the living,\" but they fall\ninto a rational order when related to the personalities of the \" dead.\"\nMost communicators, when they attempt to produce the writing\nthemselves, find themselves in a state of complete bewilderment at\nfirst, and frequently an extreme mental automatism is shown, but so\ni Note how this corresponds with the difficulties which I have suggested on\np. 332 as being in the way of the communicator.\n\fxxxni.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 381\nfar as I have been able to extend my analysis, such automatism in\neach case seems to suggest the mind of the alleged communicator.\nAnd in these extreme types there may be given not merely information\npeculiar and private to the communicator that was known to him\nwhen living and that may or may not be known to the sitter, but\ninformation of contemporary events elsewhere, unknown to the sitter.\nThus one of our members in Boston, Mrs. J., had much difficulty in\ngetting her husband to write his own name in full, and afterwards had\nthe same difficnlty in getting her own first name written ; at her\nsecond sitting when she asked for it, it was not written at all, though\nother matters connected with her family were correctly mentioned.\nAt the third sitting she asked about her son living :\u2014\n\" . . . the silver handle troubles him . . . my shop .\nwhere is my shop ... or my work . . . the new handle troubles\nme or him.\" Later this was repeated.\nMrs. J. called at her son's office the same day and wrote to me on\nthe following day that \"the bother about a silver handle was correct.\"\nHer son was engaged in jewellers' designing work, as her husband had\nbeen, and she \"found him,'' as she wrote in more detail two days later,\n\"quite upset by the 'bother' he had had to make the handle in perfect\nkeeping with a very fine creamer he had designed and made.\" Mrs. J.\nwas unaware of the trouble, and no such incident had occurred before.\nThis, of course, belongs to a type of case to which I have previously\nreferred, as occurring frequently among clearer communicators (p. 372);\nwhere it is difficult to suppose that Mrs. Piper's secondary personality\nselects such an occurrence for reproduction, but where it becomes\nintelligible on the view that Mr. J. was interested in his son's doings,\nand that the mention of his son brought up the consciousness which he\nhad just acquired of his son's worry. Yet this was consistent with the\nutmost difficulty in keeping his thoughts together sufficiently to follow\nand answer our questions about his own name or the name of his wife.\nI give another case connected with Mr. Vance, whose first sitting\nwas on March 30th, 1892 (p. 457). Besides G. P.'s inquiry after the\nsitter's son and his correct statement that the son and himself were in\ncollege together, and his correct description of the sitter's country\nhouse in reply to the question where he had stayed with the Vances,\nanother striking piece of information was given by Phinuit. The\nsitter presented a paper, and Phinuit said it looked more like a little\nverse than anything else. \"Do you know there's two Marys connected\nwith this. Two Marys were in the body. One Mary suggested it\nand the other Mary wrote it. One is mother, and mother suggested\nit.\" This was true. It was a short verse from the Bible, and\n\" was written by my sister at my mother's request shortly before\nher death ; it was given to me with a special motive, and has\n2 c 2\n\f3S2 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nbeen kept under lock and key until it was taken to Mrs. Piper.\"\nThe information purported to come, through Phinuit, from Mary,\nthe \" deceased \" writer of the verse. Mr. Vance, then, if this com--\nmunication and the answers from G. P. were instances of thought-\ntransference from his mind, was not altogether a \"bad agent.\" Three\nyears later Mr. Vance had another sitting for the purpose of getting\ncommunications from a recently deceased friend. G. P. appeared, gave\nthe name of the sitter, asked after his son, and tried to get some clear\ncommunications from the friend, who purported to be there. The\nsitter asked the friend various questions, but all the answers or\nremarks were irrelevant, and names asked for were given wrong. He\nasked specially for the name of a book written by the friend, to which\nno answer was given at the time, and an answer given at a later\nsitting was wrong. Yet the name of this book was well-known to\nme as well as to Mr. Vance, who also I believe at the time knew the\nanswers to the other questions which he asked. G. P. himself however\nappeared to be quite clear, and when I finally suggested that he\nshould stop writing as the results were all confused, wrote: \"Adieu,\nVance. Sorry to be put out in this way, but suppose I shall have\nto swallow it. G. P. Adieu. Sorry you did not wish to see me.\"\nThe friend apparently complained of his head at the beginning of the\nsitting, and later on said, \"I feel very sleepy.\" In life, as a matter of\nfact, he suffered from mental trouble for which he was compelled to\ntake hospital treatment, and from other details known to me, I should\nsay that this is precisely the type of case from which I should now\nexpect to get no clear communications until long after death and after\nmuch familiarity with the process of communication.\nIt was out of the automatic dreameries of persons in some such\nconditions as those which I have illustrated above, that Phinuit in my\npresent view so often had to fish his facts, and I think that assent to\ncorrect statements and other clues from the sitters, besides helping the\n\" communicator,\" were probably of great service to Phinuit, enabling\nhim to \" cast his line \" for those mental automatisms that specially\nconcerned the sitter. Much light seems to me to have been thrown\nupon Phinuit's mistakes and obscurities and general method of trying\nto get at facts, in what were on the whole bad sittings, by comparison of\nthe results obtained from the various communicators writing directly or\nusing G.P. as amanuensis; and I feel pretty sure that much of Phinuit's\n\"fishing\" was due to the confusions of the more or less comatose\ncommunicators whose minds had let loose, so to speak, a crowd of\nearthly memories. And in cases where we should a priori be led to\nexpect that the communicators would certainly not be confused, or, if\nthey were confused, the confusion would not make much difference,\nPhinuit was particularly successful. These cases, in which there was\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 383\nalso a little direct communication with the voice, seem to me to afford\na special argument in themselves in favour of the \" spirit \" hypothesis.\nThey may be contrasted with the type of extreme failures which I have\nconnected with chronic morbid habits or disruptive dominant ideas.\nThe cases I refer to are those of little children recently deceased.\nBefore describing these I refer to the cases of two children who had\nbeen dead many years. Mrs. J. (to whom I have referred on p. 381)\nreceived at her first sitting a little writing, only a few sentences, pur\nporting to come from her son, who died twenty-four years before at the\nage of two years and three months, from suppressed scarlet fever\ncausing congestion of the lungs. He gave his name Arthur, wrote,\n\" Here I am, Mamma, after all these years,\" and said that his father,\nrecently deceased, was with him ; mentioned three names that had no\nrelevance for the sitter, and said that his head and stomach were all\nright. Mrs. J. knew well that there was no trouble with the head or\nthe stomach, and she had other vivid remembrances of her child which\nwere not mentioned. This is not an unnatural result if regarded as\ncoming from the professed communicator, in whom we should perhaps\nhardly expect to find much recollection of events that occurred in the\nlife on earth when he was such a little child twenty-four years before.\nThe other case is that of the son of Mrs. R. (p. 511) who was killed\nin an accident some thirteen years previously when about thirteen\nyears old. Through G. P. writing, he gave his name Roland, and\nreferred to his having been killed. I knew somewhat of the circum\nstances and made some remark about the \" little boy.\" G. P. wrote :\u2014\n\" Roland is a gentleman, not a boy.\" He referred to a picture as being\ndear to his mother (she was in the habit of carrying a portrait of him\nabout with her), referred to the years that had passed, and quoted a\npassage : \" Don't worry about me, Mamma, I am all right, and as\nhappy as possible,\" words which Mrs. R. states were in a letter received\nby her from \"a strange medium \" soon after her son's death, and which\npurported to be a message from her son She refused to accept it at\nthe time as such. This communication was apparently referred to at\nthe sitting.i So far as this communication went, concerning the\nmatters pertaining to Roland himself, it seemed very clear, but there\ni There are several other cases in the reports where reference is made to communi\ncations through some other mediums. See Mr. Mitchell's sitting, p. 518, and Dr. K.'s,\np. 527. In Dr. K.'s case the circumstance might be of some evidential value if we\nhad more details. The case of Mr. T. B. ft, p. 472, is interesting, but might of\ncourse be accounted for by direct thought-transference. I have two or three other\nprivate cases in my records, but at best they merely add a few incidents which\nstrengthen the view that telepathy from the sitter is not an adequate explanation.\nSee p. 351. Of course if the real persons are actually communicating under the novel\nconditions to which I have referred, it is probable that they themselves would have an\nunusually vivid recollection that they had done so.\n\f384 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nwas no reproduction of boyish incidents which must have been stored\nin Mrs. R.'s mind, and of some of which, as I know, she had thought\nmuch and constantly. Yet it is not unnatural that after thirteen\nyears in another world, if we suppose a change from childhood to\nmaturity, such boyish incidents should not be dominant in the mind of\nthe actual communicator.\nIf we had numerous cases like these two, and numerous cases like\nthose which follow, they would, when contrasted, furnish an additional\nargument in favour of the view that the alleged communicators are\nactually the persons that they claim to be.\nThere are various references in the records given in Appendix IV.\nto the twin children of Dr. and Mrs. A. B. Thaw. One of these,\nMargaret, died a year before their first sitting at the age of six\nmonths, and the other, Ruthie, died three months before their first\nsitting at the age of lifteen months. The communications concerning\nthese children were given almost entirely by Phinuit, who had, how\never, some difficulty with the names. At the first sitting several\nattempts were made before the name Margaret was given clearly.\nTrouble with teeth was mentioned in connection with the children,\napparently as the first impression on the appearance of Margaret, but\nnot actually specified as Margaret's. Margaret was teething when she\ndied. Phinuit also said that one of the children wanted baby's beads.\nMargaret used to play with a necklace of beads belonging to her older\nsister living. And referiing to Margaret, Phinuit said that she had\nsome flowers in her hand, that \"she liked them and took them\nwith her.\" Mrs. Thaw had placed three little flowers in Margaret's\nhand after her death. Phinuit got much more in connection with\nRuthie, whose first appearance seemed to be accompanied by a\nrecurrence of associations connected with the trouble that caused her\ndeath, dysentery and sore throat. Phinuit indicated the locality and\nthe distress, and Ruthie's dislike of \" the powder.\" Bismuth was\ngiven through the entire illness of two weeks and was always\ngiven with trouble. Phinuit spoke of Ruthie as having light golden\nhair, afterwards adding curly;\u2014correct\u2014but called her a boy. The\nliving Ruthie was very generally mistaken for a boy, but not, of\ncourse, by the Thaws. Yet Phinuit had much difficulty in getting the\nname, and failed to get nearer than Ethie, and the sitters told him it\nbegan with R. Phinuit said that she had not learned to talk, but\nlater on he got the name Ruth ie correctly. He remarked that she\nonly said papa and mamma. Other words that the living Ruthie said\nwere given in later sittings. Phinuit described her as wanting to see\nthe stars. For two or three months before her death Ruthie was fond\nof pointing at the stars through the window. At the beginning of\nthe sitting Phinuit said she put her hand on Dr. Thaw's head, and\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 385\nafterwards described her as wanting to pat his face, actions which\nwere characteristic of the living Ruthie towards Dr. Thaw. Similarly\nshe wanted to hear the tick tick (watch) in connection with her uncle\nAleck, and it was he who chiefly used to hold the watch for her to\nhear it. And another characteristic action was reproduced in con\nnection with Mr. Melvin W. ; Phinuit said she wanted him to wave\nthe hand in a certain way to Mr. W., and the living Ruthie waved\nher hand in that way to Mr. W., and to him only. Reference was also\nmade to her picture, and Mrs. Thaw was painting a picture of Ruthie\nwhen she was taken ill. In later sittings Phinuit described her as\nsaying other words, baby, pretty, Bettie, and pussie, with the accent used\nby Ruthie when living. Tiiese were the only words besides the papa\nand mamma mentioned before, used by Ruthie when living. The first\ntime Mrs. Thaw wore fur at a sitting, the hand stroked it, and Phinuit\nwhispered \" pussie \" as Ruthie living used to do. But Ruthie had\nwhispered \" pussie \" at a previous sitting. Two or three times there\nseemed to be a direct control of the voice by Ruthie who took the place\nof Phinuit (pp. 561, 576, 578). The first time she whispered pttee and\npssee (pretty and pussie) and the second time pttee only, the words being\nmany times repeated. This second occasion was connected with rather\na striking incident. Mrs. Piper was visiting the Thaws in New York,\nand they took her up the river Hudson to their country house and had\na sitting on the afternoon of the day of their arrival. I was taking\nnotes, sitting slightly to one side and partly behind Mrs. 'Piper, while\nDr. and Mrs. Thaw were sitting in front of her, with their heads some\nwhat bowed. Phinuit apparently \"left,\" and his place was taken by\nRuthie, who began whispering pttee pttee. The hand rose and turned\nsomewhat diagonally and extended the forefinger and pointed towards\na picture on the far side of the room. The Thaws did not see this action\nuntil I drew their attention to it, when they looked up, and followed the\ndirection of the pointing. The hand then trembled and sank. Dr.\nThaw noted : \" During the last month of Ruthie's life it was a regular\nmorning custom to bring her to the room in which this sitting was\nheld\u2014our bedroom\u2014and she would always point, as hand did in\nsitting, with one finger (unusual with a baby) and say ' pt-tee, pt tee,'\njust as in sitting. This little incident had not been in either sitter's\nconscious mind since baby's death, six months before. Mrs. Piper had\nnever been in that room until the actual time of sitting. Many other\npictures in the room, two of which Mrs. Piper's hand could have\npointed at more easily than the particular one always noticed by the\nbaby.\" i\ni Dr. Thaw was a careful investigator, and I have no doubt myself that Mrs.\nPiper herself in her normal state knew nothing of the room or the incident of the\npicture, but of course I do not offer an incident like this by itself as any proof of\nsupernormal power. Mrs. Piper was a guest of the Thaws at the time, and those\n\f386 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nIn the two sittings which Mrs. Sutton had in December, 1893,\n(p. 484) she had articles which had been used by her recently deceased\nlittle girl Katherine. One incident that was characteristic in the case\nof Ruthie, the patting of her father's face, was repeated in the\ncase of Katherine, when it had no special significance. There were\nonly three points that might be described as in part common to the\ntwo children Ruthie and Katherine. Katherine had \"lovely curls,''\nmentioned by Phinuit, and also called for \"the tick-tick,\" but Phinuit\nadded correctly that she called it \" the clock,\" and the word babee was\ngiven correctly, as Ruthie also used to pronounce it. Apparently the\nonly incorrect statement purporting to come from the child was that\nshe called a lady (Mrs. C, a friend of Mrs. Sutton, who purported to\nbe present in \" spirit,\" bringing the child, and whose Christian name\nand surname were given correctly by Phinuit) Auntie. The lady was\nnot her aunt. The statements made came through Phinuit. Concern\ning a silver medal it was said that she wanted to bite it, and\nconcerning a string of buttons that she wanted to put them in A\\ev\nmouth, both correct. Phinuit said that she had no sore throat any\nmore, and that she kept showing him her tongue. Katherine living\nhad sore throat anil her tongue was paralysed. She gave correctly the\nname by which she called herself, Kakie, the name Dodo by which she\ncalled her brother George, the name Bagie by which she called a living\nsister, Margaret, and the name, Eleanor, of another living sister for\nwhom she called much in her last illness. She also asked for Dinah,\nthis being the name of an old rag-doll. She said truly that Dodo\nused to march with her, \"he put me way up.\" She wanted to go\nto \" wide horsey \"\u2014as the living Katherine had pleaded all through\nher illness, and to be taken \" to see the mooley-cow,\" the name by\nwhich the living Katherine called the cow, which she was taken\nalmost daily to see. She said she had \" the pretty white flowers you\nput on me,\" and Phinuit described lilies of the valley, which were the\nflowers that had been placed in the casket, (see p. 303). She said she\nwas happy with grandma,\u2014Mrs. Sutton's mother had been dead many\nyears,\u2014and later on wanted to send her love to her grandma and also\napparently to her great grandma who was referred to as Marmie. She\nhad a grandmother and also a great grandmother then living, and\npersons who are disposed to explain these phenomena by the hypothesis of fraud can\nreadily suppose that Mrs. Piper may have acquired the information needed to go\nthrough the scene described above. Believing that there is abundant proof, in this\nand the previous records published, that Mrs. Piper in her trance-state possesses\nsupernormal power of a kind which goes at least as far as telepathy from distant\nliving persons, and being satisfied myself otherwise that Mrs. Piper dot's not hunt up\ninformation about sitters, I have, in considering what hypothesis seems best to fit the\nphenomena as a whole, put aside the question of fraud. I refer to the subject\noccasionally in this way for the purpose of avoiding misunderstandings.\n\fXXXIII.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 387\nMarrnie was the name by which Mr. and Mrs. Sutton spoke of the\ngreat giandmother, but Katherine always called her Grammie.i She\nalso referred to two songs she used to sing : \" Bye bye, O baby bye,\"\nand \" Row Row, my song.\" This \" Row Row \" song was sung\nfrequently by Katherine during her illness, and was the last sung by\nher when living, and she asked Mr. and Mrs. Sutton to sing it at the\nsitting. They sang the first four lines, and the voice \u2014presumably still\n\"controlled\" by Phinuit in imitation of Katherine\u2014sang with them.\nPhinuit then hushed the sitters, and the voice sang the remaining\nfour lines above. It is, of course, a familiar child's song (p. 486).\nAt the second sitting a fortnight later, the voice sang all eight\nlines alone, then asked Mrs. Sutton to sing it with her, as she did,\nand then at Mrs. Sutton's request also sang with her the other song\n\" Bye bye,\" precisely, according to Mrs Sutton, as the living Katherine\nsang it. Mr. Sutton, who was present at the first sitting, did not\nattend the second sitting, and he was asked for immediately after this\nsinging, which came at the beginning of the sitting. \" Kakie wants\npapa.\" This was a very characteristic expression. There were indi\ncations suggesting a knowledge of what was going on in Mrs. Sutton's\nfamily. At the first sitting Katherine said she went \" to see horsey \"\nevery day. The sitters had been staying in the country with Mr.\nSutton's parents and had been driving frequently. Margaret, a living\nsister, was still there, and driving daily. Mrs. Sutton, who has had\nmany psychical experiences herself in seeing the \" apparitions \" of\n\" deceased \" persons (see p. 484) had \" seen Kakie \" during that visit to\nMr. Sutton's parents. At the second sitting Katherine said that she\nsaw Bagie with grandma, and that she played with Eleanor every day\nand liked the little bed. A lady had recently lent Eleanor a doll's\nbed, but Mrs. Sutton had not associated this with Kakie. There were\nincidents at both sittings which showed associations that seemed to\nbe in the mind of the child, which did not awaken the corresponding\nassociations in the minds of the sitters even when the contemporary\nnotes to the sittings were made. Thus in the first sitting she asked\nfor \"horsey.\" Mrs. Sutton gave a little toy horse with which the\nchild had played during her illness. But the child said \" big horsey,\nnot this little one,\" and Mrs. Sutton surmised that she referred to\nanother toy cart-horse that she used to like. At the second sitting\ncame \" Kakie wants the horse,\" and the little horse was again given.\nNo, that is not the one. The big horse\u2014so big [Phinuit shows how\nlarge.] Eleanor's horse. Eleanor used to put it in Kakie's lap. She loved\nthat horsey.\ni It scarcely needs mentioning that this is explicable on either of the hypotheses\nunder view.\n\f388 [part\nRichard Ilodijson.\nThese additional particulars, which were true, then reminded Mrs.\nSutton of the horse referred to, which was packed away in another\ncity, and which had not occurred to the mind of Mrs. Sutton in\nconnection with Kakie. Similarly at the first sitting she asked two\nor three times for \" the little book.\" The sitter noted that she liked a\nlinen picture-book. But the remarks made at her second sitting\nsuggest that the little book in the child's mind was not this one.\n\"Kakie wants the little bit of a book mamma read by her bedside,\nwith the pretty bright things hanging from it\u2014mamma put it in her\nhands\u2014the last thing she remembers.\" Mrs. Sutton states that this\nwas a little prayer-book with a cross and other symbols in silver\nattached to ribbons for marking the places, and that it was sent to\nher by a friend after Kakie had ceased to know anyone except\nperhaps for a passing moment. Mrs. Sutton read it when Kakie\nseemed unconscious, and after Kakie's deathi placed it in her hands to\nprevent the blood settling in the nails. She adds later that Mrs.\nPiper's hands when the book was asked for at the sitting, were put\ninto the same position as Kakie's.\nAnother book was mentioned at the second sitting which apparently\nwas the one Mrs. Sutloii thought of at the first sitting. \"Kakie wants\nthe book with red letters and pictures of animals.\" Correct description.\nAt this second sitting also Katherine again apparently referred to\nMrs. C, \u2014who was not a relative,\u2014as Auntie, and to her great\ngrandmother as Afarmie. At this sitting Mrs. Sutton twice saw the\n\" apparition \" of Kakie (and she also saw the figure of Dr. Clarke,\nanother communicator, just as Phinuit said : \" Here is an old\ngentleman who wants to speak to you, Dr. Clarke,\" see p. 484). On\none of these occasions Mrs. Sutton \" saw her for a moment, standing\nat the table, trying to reach a spool \" of silk, and at the same moment\nPhinuit reached for it saying : \" She wants that, she and Eleanor used\nto play with. She calls it Eleanor's.\" This was all true, but the sitter\n\" had not connected it with Eleanor in her thoughts.\" Another incident\nI quote here just as it is given in the detailed report of the sitting.\n[Kakie asks for her ball. I gave it to Phinuit, who tries to find what\nshe wants to do with it.]\nBite it ? Toss it ! Roll it ? Throw it ?\n[No, she wants a string. Mrs. H. gave him a string. He tries to tie it\naround the ball.] [A little red wooden ball with a hole through it. The\nball had a string through it when she used to play with it.]\nNo, that is not right, through it.\nThere, there, be a good little girl. Don't cry. Don't be impatient, you\nwant your mamma to see how you do it, so she will know it is you, don't\nyou, dear ? Old man will do it for her.\ni If the human personality survives death, it may bo a difficult question to decide in\nindividual cases precisely w hen the consciousness is finally withdrawn from the body.\n\fxxxin.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 389\n[He put the string through, held it up, and hit it with the finger, making\nit swing.]\nThat is it, is it not, darling. ? Nice little girl as ever was.\n[While she was sick, it was her great delight to have me hold the string,\nand lot her hit the little red ball with her finger or spoon. She made the\nmotions as if doing it, after she became unconscious.]\nMrs. Sutton had some brief communications also from other friends\nand relatives. One from a deceased friend Hattie she thought not in\nthe least like Hattie. And there was much apparently painful effort\nand confusion and agitation in writing at both sittings from another\ncommunicator through whom an attempt was made unsuccessfully to\nget a certain address ; yet Phinuit correctly specified where the person\nwas born and where he died, though at the time Mrs. Sutton believed\nboth to be wrong.\nWhat seems to me to be suggested by the references to these\nchildren in the records is that, on their first coming to communicate,\nthe recollection of the troubles from which they suffered when living\ncame to the front in their consciousness, but their definite remem\nbrances were few in number. The half-a-dozen words that Ruthie\nwas represented as saying were all that the living Ruthie had\nbeen able to say, and similarly there were only a few characteristic\nactions, and these were naturally associated with the persons with\nwhom the living Ruthie had associated them. Since there were only\na few persons with whom Ruthie had any definite associations at all,\nand since these definite associations themselves were few in number, it\nwould make no practical difference how much confused she might be.\nThese associations were easily recognised as hers. In such cases also\nthe wrench of death may be less violent than in more mature persons,\nand the change from one set of conditions to the other may be less\ndisturbing. Similarly in the case of Mrs. Sutton's child. But here the\ndefinite associations were much more numerous, and, as I have pointed\nout, Mrs. Sutton apparently did not understand two of the allusions\nmade at the first sitting. But add another thirty or forty years of\nlife, with the myriads of associations involved, and with the mind\ninured to the habits of a particular fleshly organism, and then after a\nchange to another completely new set of conditions, draw the\npersonality back once more into the bonds of another and different\nbody, where it has little or no control over the mass of its mental\nassociations, and the result might be expected to be very different from\nthat of the \" simple child that lightly draws its breath.\"\nOn the other hand it may be urged that such cases are equally\nexplicable on the hypothesis of thought-transference from the sitters.\nWe can of course suppose that parents whose little children have recently\ndied are good telepathic agents for the group of associations connected\n\f390 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nwith those children. But we can see no reason why thoy should be\nbetter telepathic agents, that is, to Mrs. Piper's personality, than, say,\na wife who has just lost her husband. I have known cases of this type\nwhere strong grief and vivid remembrance have served apparently\nto bring the desired \" communicator,\" but not to make him clear.\nLet us finally contrast another kind of failure with what seems to be\na very simple kind of success. I refer to the naming of sitters. G. P.\nhad the opportunity, by his frequent \" return,\" of becoming expert in\ncommunicating, and was unusually clear, to begin with, in his manage\nment of the writing mechanism. The ordinary communicator has\nmuch difficulty in giving names apparently ; he is like a man half\nasleep, who only half knows what you want, and through whose con\nsciousness may drift a mass of irrelevant names which tend to be\nwritten, but which, if he were in full waking consciousness living,\nwould be inhibited. In very good sittings of the old type, the sitter's\nsurname was rarely given. What is it, then, that in the G. P.\ncommunications happened to give the surnamesi of the particular\ngroup of persons known to G. P. 1 What is it that selected the thirty\npersons recognised as G. P.'s friends and knew their appropriate\nrelations with G. P. living 1 Why should the supposed Mrs. Piper's\ntelepathic power succeed so strangely with these G. P. recognitions,\nand be so failing and uncertain in the case of so many persons who\nhappened to be unknown to G. P. living 1 What was it that picked\nout the odd associations of Marte and the club with Mr. Smith\n(p. 327), and yet, with all this supposed telepathic capacity failed to\nrecognise Miss Warner, who had changed so much that G. P. living\nwould probably not have recognised her, but who knew well herself, as\nI did also, that she had met G. P. in years gone by ? I think that\nthere is here a strong indication pointing to the actual G. P. It\nsuggests the existence of something which has the perceptions and\nmemories of G. P., but not a general telepathic capacity outside this.\nOtherwise we must make some such extraordinary supposition as\nthat all G. P.'s friends were good telepathic agents with Mrs Piper as\npercipient, and,\u2014when we take the detailed records into consideration,\n\u2014that they showed this united telepathic capacity only as regards\ntheir relations with G. P.\nNow, as I stated in \u00a7 5 of this Report (p. 367), I do not think that\nwe have by any means enough material on hand to form a positive\ni G. P. gave the surnames in all cases where I have not specified otherwise, or\nwhere it was obviously not required, as in the case of his father and mother, and the\nchildren of the Howards, whom he called by their first names only. (See pp. 323-328.)\nIn nearly all the other cases he gave the first names also, in all where the first names\nwere familiar to G. P. living. In addition to this, various other Christian names and\nsurnames were given of intimate friends and relatives of G. P. living.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 391\njudgment, though I regard such cases as those which I have men\ntioned in illustration as very strongly suggestive of variations in the\nindividual communicators themselves. I am not attempting to prove\nthis here, but only to show that there are facts which apparently point\nin that direction, and to indicate lines of inquiry for future work and\nfor new investigators, who may eventually obtain enough material to\nmake a positive conclusion possible. And I must warn the reader yet\nfurther that by positive conclusion I do not mean absolute demonstra\ntion to the exclusion of any other hypothesis. There will still be a\nquestion of presumption and probability which will appeal to different\nminds differently, as do for example the general conclusions\u2014with\nwhich I myself agree\u2014put forward in the Eeport of the \"Census of\nHallucinations\" (Proceedings, Vol. X.), concerning the existence of a\ncausal relation between certain hallucinations and dying persons. To\ngive the full force of the probability as it has affected my own mind\nwould make the present Report much too long, even were all the\navailable material at my disposal, as it is not. In a future Report,\nwith the accumulation of fresh material, I hope to undertake this task.\nIt will involve a detailed consideration of the general psychology\nof memory and a detailed consideration of the mental automatisms\nmanifested in dream and reverie and delirium and insanity and\nhypnotic trance, and more or less allied states, where the manifesta\ntions of the personality concerned are different in various ways and in\nvarious degrees from those of his normal waking consciousness. After\nacquiring a familiarity with the tendencies exhibited in such manifesta\ntions, we should then have to consider in detail the specific mental\nautomatisms displayed by groups of alleged communicators through\nthe trance, obtaining, for our comparison with these, as complete a\nknowledge as possible of the alleged communicators when living.\nOne man's madness is not the same as another's. And a similar\ndetailed consideration needs to be given to the other classes of cases\nto which I have referred. Should any other persons like Mrs. Piper\ncome before us for our investigation, it seems to me desirable, if\npossible, that the experimenting should be confined to a few investi\ngators, who should endeavour to make an absolutely complete record\nfrom the Iieginning. As regards the evidence in such cases, I am\nconvinced that it has been dealt with altogether too much \" in the\nrough.\" It is the detail that counts, since it is from the detail that\nwe get the most important light concerning the actual processes\ninvolved.\nWith this caveat, then, I indicate the results to which my own\nobservations seem to tend.\nThe persistent failures of many communicators under varying con\nditions ; the first failures of other communicators who soon develop\n\f392 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\ninto clearness in communicating, and whose first attempts apparently\ncan be made much clearer by the assistance of persons professing to be\nexperienced communicators; the special bewilderment, soon to dis\nappear, of communicators shortly after death and apparently in\nconsequence of it ; the character of the specific mental automatisms\nmanifest in the communications ; the clearness of remembrance in\nlittle children recently deceased as contrasted with the forgetfulness of\nchildish things shown by communicators who died when children many\nyears before,\u2014all present a definite relation to the personalities\nalleged to be communicating, and are exactly what we should expect if\nthey are actually communicating under the conditions of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance manifestations. The results fit the claim.\nOn the other hand these are not the results which we should expect\non the hypothesis of telepathy from the living. That persons who\nmust be assumed on this hypothesis to be good agents otherwise, should\nfail continuously and repeatedly with certain persons as \" com\nmunicators \" ; that first communicators of a clearer type should show,\nespecially when themselves professedly directly communicating, the\npeculiar strangeness which they do even to experienced agents who are\nfamiliar with the modus operandi of the communication ; that there\nshould be a special temporary bewilderment shown in cases immediately\nafter death and that this should be followed in a few days by a\ncomparatively complete clearness in various cases where there is no\nassignable change in the agent (unless it were a diminution of his\ntelepathic power) ; that there should be specific mental automatisms\nwhich suggest, not the mind of the supposed agent, or the mind of the\nsupposed percipient, but the mind of the \" deceased \" person ; that\nmemories of little children recently deceased should have a special\ntelepathic agency,\u2014such results we have no reason to expect from\nwhat we know or have reason to surmise concerning telepathic action\nbetween one incarnate living person and another.\nFurther there are certain kinds of successes with particular com\nmunicators connected with their knowledge and recognition of friends,\nshown most notably in the case of G. P., but exhibited to some extent\nby others also (e.g., Madame Elisa and Louis R.) which suggest the\nrecollections and continued interest in personal friends living which\nwe should naturally expect from the alleged communicators themselves,\nbut for which there seems to be no adequate cause in Mrs. Piper's\npercipient personality.\nIn general, then, we may say that there are on the one hand\nvarious limitations in the information shown through Mrs. Piper's\ntrance, which are prinul facie explicable on the assumption that it\ncomes from the alleged communicators, and for which we can find no\ncorresponding limitations in the minds of living persons ; and on the\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 393\nother hand, that there are various selections of information given in\nconnection with particular communicators, which are intelligible if\nregarded as made by the alleged communicators themselves, but for\nwhich discrimination there is no satisfactory explanation to be found\nby referring them to Mrs. Piper's personality. With one class of\ndeceased persons Mrs. Piper's supposed telepathic percipience fails ;\nwith another class it succeeds ; and it fails and succeeds apparently in\naccordance with what we should expect from the minds of the\ndeceased, and not in accordance with what we should expect from the\nminds of living persons acting upon Mrs. Piper's percipient personality.\nThe question is whether this particular distribution of successes and\nfailures is due to mere chance coincidence in Mrs. Piper's percipient\npersonality, or can be traced to any adequate causes there, or whether\nit points to the agency of the invisible personalities whom we once\nknew incarnate. My own conclusion is that it points to the latter,\nbut I do not think that there is evidence enough producible to make\nthis pointing a certainty. But, so far as it goes, it suggests that the\n\" natural grouping \" of the facts affiliates them to the personalities of\nthe dead.\nNotwithstanding all this it may still be urged that the hypothesis\nof telepathy from the living may be extended so as to cover even the\nvarious types of cases illustrated above. It may be so extended by\nmaking further additional arbitrary suppositions, and what this exten\nsion leads us to we shall see presently. I first recur briefly to some\nother series of facts bearing on the question.\nLet us go back to what we know of experimental thought-\ntransference. I have supposed, for the sake of allowing as much\nlatitude as possible to the hypothesis of telepathy from the living, that\nthe subliminal consciousness of the sitters and also of distant living\npersons might be drawn upon by the medium. But this itself is a\npurely arbitrary supposition, and as Professor Lodge emphasised in\nhis report on Mrs. Piper (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 453), \" it ought\nto be constantly borne in mind that this kind of thought-transference\nwithout consciously active agency has never been experimentally\nproved.\" Now, so far as I can judge from my own experience as\na sitter, and from the experience of other sitters, without any\nstatistical record,i I should say that if we exclude the bringing of\nthe communicator, the results, as regards the giving of specific\ninformation, would prove conclusively that the information was not\ni 1 mean by this a record in which the successes and failures are classified in\nrelation to what the sitter was consciously thinking of at the time. It will, however,\nI think, be plain to any reader of the reports that neither the successes nor the\nfailures in regard to the general information given at sittings show any direct relation\nto the conscious minds of the sitters.\n\f394. [part\nRichard Hodysov.\nobtained by a process like that involved in experimental thought-\ntransference, and that for the kind of telepathy, if telepathy it be,\ninvolved in these manifestations there is no experimental basis\nwhatever. At the same time, if the information given at the sittings,\nboth in matter and form, was limited by the knowledge possessed by\nthe sitters, we should have no hesitation in supposing that it was\nderived from their minds, telepathically or otherwise ; but enough\nexamples are cited in this report alone to show that the information\ngiven is not so limited. We must then make the arbitrary supposi\ntions that Mrs. Piper's percipient personality gets into relation with\nthe minds of distant living persons, (1) who are intimate friends of\nthe sitters at the time of the sitting (e.g., p. 297, Hart's sitting and\nreferences to the studs and the Howards, etc.), and (2) who are\nscarcely known, or not at all known, to the sitter (e.g., MacDonough\nmessages p. 340, and Aleck Bousser message, p. 372). And many of\nthese distant living persons had, so far as they knew, never been near\nMrs. Piper. These cases then compel us to assume a selective capacity\nin Mrs. Piper's percipient personality, and not only selective as to the\noccurrences themselves, but discriminative as to the related persons ;\nthat is to say, attaching the various pieces of knowledge respectively\nto the fictitious personalities whom, if real and living, the events in\nquestion would have concerned. If now we widen this supposed\npercipient personality of Mrs. Piper, and differentiate its parts so a*\nto cover all the various successes of the communicators described in\nthis report, with the verisimilitudes of the different personalities of\nthe \"deceased,\" and so as to cover also all the types of confusion and\nfailure, and so as to allow for the yet increasing number of new\ncommunicators, we reach a conception which goes as far as the\n\" spirit \" hypothesis itself.\nAnd I may add here that these arbitrary suppositions may be>\nincreased yet further to cover other forms of evidence that may be\nobtained hereafter, such as the giving of information supposed to be\npossessed by the dead alone, or the manifestation of knowledge not\nyet acquired by the human race, so far as we are aware, such as the\nexistence of heavenly bodies previously unknown or the customs of\nthe inhabitants of other planets, \u2014-verified, let us assume, in future\nyears. All that we need suppose in such cases would be that the facts,\nknown consciously to the dead alone were communicated by them\nwhen living telepathically to the subliminal consciousnesses of other\npersons, that the giver of knowledge concerning the heavenly bodies,\nobtained it clairvoyantly, and so on.\nBut I have supposed that the personality of Mrs. Piper exhibits,\nnumerous individually coherent but different fragments of conscious\nness, and in my own practical experience T have reached conclusions\n\fxxxin] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 395\n. as to the g'wast-independence of the apparent communicators which I\ncannot expect all my readers to share. I accommodate my supposition,\ntherefore, to conform with the conclusion to which I believe that all\npersons would come concerning the manifestations through Mrs.\nPiper's trance, if they could witness a series of sittings and observe the\ntwo contemporaneous \" controls \" of the hand and the voice. I put\naside the cases where both hands have written independently at the\nsame time that the voice was independently speaking, these cases being\ntoo few to rely upon as evidence (see p. 294). But there has been an\nindependence between the streams of consciousness using respectively\nthe hand and voice which compels us to suppose that there are at least\ntwo distinctly different and individually coherent intelligent conscious\nnesses of some kind manifesting themselves contemporaneously through\nMrs. Piper's organism. I believe, also, that the observer of Mrs.\nPiper's phenomena in detail would have, further, no doubt but that\nneither of these consciousnesses is identical with that of the normal\nwaking Mrs. Piper. This at least dual consciousness, acting indepen\ndently of the normal Mrs. Piper, must be taken into full consideration,\nthough we may suppose here that the two streams of it represent only\ndivided parts of Mrs. Piper's personality. These two intelligent\nfragments, we may suppose, do all the acting ; they get impressions\ntelepathically from the minds of the sitters and of distant living\npersons, they form conceptions of the alleged communicators, they\ndramatise the results and present them with the completeness that\nis shown at the sittings. We may even go further in our sup\nposition and contemplate the manifestations as the result of a\nsingle consciousness playing all the parts as described. To realise\nwhat such a consciousness implies, we must bring before our thought\nthe fulness of knowledge shown continuously through Mrs. Piper's\ntrance by so many alleged communicators, the varying ways in which\nthat consciousness has manifested itself in accordance with the minds\nof such communicators, the completeness of the personalities repre\nsented in many cases, and the confusions and failures of others, all\nconforming to what we should expect from such communicators, if\nactually existing as they describe themselves to be, showing a dis\ncriminative diversity of telepathic power which exactly suits the\nrespective communicators, manifesting emotional remembrances and\ndesires and intelligence characteristic of the alleged communicators,\nand urging further towards higher aspiration and noble deed, and\nconstantly affirming their independent existence.\nWhat kind of a consciousness is this that we must suppose, and to\nwhose domain must it be attributed t According to our outlook upon\nthe universe, one hypothesis will appear more plausible than another.\nIn my own case my conclusions have been largely determined, no\n2 d\n\f396 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\ndoubt, by intimate actual experience of the manifestations and a\nknowledge in detail of nearly all the personal and private matters\nthat cannot appear in the evidential record. There may be many\npersons who are willing to take the evidence here presented and\ngive it due weight, and who nevertheless will adopt some such view\nas that a form of Consciousness manifests itself through Mrs. Piper's\nentranced organism, in which Consciousness the \" pseudo-personalities \"\nof our \" deceased \" friends appear, and grow, and behave in all\ndiscernible ways as their actual personalities might be expected to\nbehave if existing independently and coufined, in their communications\nto us, to the manifestations possible through such a limited organism.\nSuch a form of Consciousness, with all the capacities that must be\nattributed to it, is very much an \" unknown quantity.\" For myself, I\ndo not object to calling this unknown quantity a larye Consciousness,\nbut it seems to me simpler to call it another icorld than to call it the\nsecondary personality of Mrs. Piper.\nBut this is not all. And here I must again state my conclusion as a\nresult of practical experience, which will however, I have no doubt, be\nconfirmed by all those who have had much to do with Mrs. Piper's\ntrance or similar manifestations. If the hypothesis of telepathy from\nthe living is acted upon in anything like the ordinary experimental\nway, the supernormal results will be lessened. If the investigator\npersistently refuses to regard the communications as coming from the\nsources claimed, he will not get the best results. If, on the other hand,\nhe acts on the hypothesis that the communicators are \"spirits,\" acting\nunder adverse conditions, and if he treats them as he would a living\nperson in a similar state, he will find an improvement in the\ncommunications. I have several times got better results alone from\ncommunicators who were strangers to me, than the intimate friends or\nrelatives were able to get, and including information unknown to me.\nTo describe it as it appears, the \"spirit \" in the attempt to communi\ncate seemed like a living friend wandering in his mind owing to an\naccident. To clear such a person's mind we should soothe him, not\nbother him with questions, but let him unburden his mind of whatever\nhis dominant ideas were, remind him of strong associations that\nwere dear to him, express sympathy, etc., etc. ; but to ask him one\nquestion after another, to put him through a cross-examination and\nexpect him to have all the answers ready at once, would obviously\nnot be conducive to anything but a worse confusion. And having\ntried the hypothesis of telepathy from the living for several years,\nand the \"spirit\" hypothesis also for several years, I have no\nhesitation in affirming with the most absolute assurance that the\n\"spirit\" hypothesis is justified by its fruits, and the other hypothesis\nis not.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 397\nHere I may explain more specifically than I have hitherto done\nwhat seems actually to occur during Mrs. Piper's trance. First, I\nmust ask the reader to revert to what I have said on pp. 332-3 con\ncerning the position of the communicator, and on pp. 358-60 concerning\nthe supposititious fragments of Mrs. Piper's personality. And I repeat\nthat I believe that this brief general account of the manifestations of\nMrs. Piper's organism holds true in the main, even if we regard the\ndifferent alleged communicators as parts not of a unique larger con\nsciousness, but of a consciousness limited in most ways like our own,\na merely human, though peculiar, secondary personality of Mrs. Piper.\nI shall use terms as far as possible which are familiar to the readers\nof our Proceedings, even although they may not be strictly accurate in\ntheir application ; they will probably convey my meaning better than\nif I adopt a new terminology.\nWhen Mrs. Piper begins to pass into trance, her normal or supra\nliminal consciousness begins to disappear, and her subliminal conscious\nness begins to manifest itself. It is as though her supraliminal\nconsciousness was sinking, and her subliminal consciousness was rising.\nThere is one stage where the subliminal consciousness seems to\ncome into view before the supraliminal consciousness has completely\ndisappeared. In this stage she is apparently dreamily conscious of the\nsitter, and dreamily conscious of \" spirits.\" She seems to be partly\nconscious, as it were, of two worlds. This stage, as she passes into\ntrance, is usually very brief and changing. She sees figures and hears\nvoices before she has completely lost her consciousness of her ordinarj\nphysical surroundings ; as is indicated by her appearance and her\noccasional remarks to the sitters, or to the \" persons \" that she\napparently sees or hears. In the next stage the supraliminal con\nsciousness has entirely disappeared, and the subliminal consciousness\nonly is manifest. It is as though her own personality held much\nthe same relation to her organism as Phinuit or other \" spirit \"\ncontroller of the voice. This stage also is very brief as she passes xnto\ntrance, but occasionally it lasts somewhat longer than usual, and she\nrepeats a remark addressed to her by some \"spirit,\" or makes a remark\nherself to a \"spirit.\" She seems then to possess, not the dreamy\nconsciousness of the previous stage, partly aware of two worlds, and\nin a dream-like relation to both, but a fuller and clearer consciousness\n\u2014we may call it her subliminal consciousness\u2014which is in direct\nrelation, however, not so much with our ordinary physical world, as\nwith \" another world.\" In the next stage this consciousness also-\ndisappears ; it seems to be withdrawn from any direct governance of\nher body, the upper part of which becomes inert and apparently\nlifeless. What I believe happens is that Mrs. Piper's normal or supra\nliminal consciousness becomes in some way dormant, and that her\n2 d 2\n\f398 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nsubliminal consciousness withdraws completely from the control of her\nbody and takes her supraliminal consciousness with it. Whether this\nis the true explanation or not, the body seems to be no longer under\nthe control of any consciousness. The upper part of her body tends to\nfall forward, and I support the head upon cushions on a table. About\nthis time, or shortly afterwards, there arises a very slight disturbance\nin the upper part of the body, which becomes less inert and which\nappears to have come to some extent under the \" control \" of some\nconsciousness, and at the same time, or frequently earlier, some\ntimes before Mrs. Piper's consciousness has completely disappeared,\nsometimes before even her supraliminal consciousness has disappeared,\nthe right hand and arm manifest a control by what seems to\nbe another consciousness and begin to make movements suggesting\nwriting.i\nThe upper part of the body including the left arm is then usually\ncontrolled by one personality and the right arm by another. For the\nseveral years during which the personality calling itself Phinuit\ncontinued to control the voice in the trance, after the development of\nthe \"automatic writing,\" the personalities controlling respectively the\nhand and the voice showed apparently a complete independence.\nWhether \" spirits,\" as they assert, or not, Phinuit and the conscious\nness controlling the hand appeared to be entirely distinct from each\nother, and frequently carried on separate and simultaneous independent\nconversations with different sitters (see pp. 292-3). Since Phinuit's\n\"departure\" (see p. 409) the voice has been used on a few rare\noccasions only, and almost exclusively by communicators who pur\nported to be relatives of the sitters, and who had used the voice before\nPhinuit's \" departure.\"\nTo continue with my description, the consciousness controlling the\nhand holds a conversation with the sitter by writing, but, so far as I\nhave been able to ascertain, it is not directly conscious of the act of\nwriting. The writing seems to be an automatic registering which is\nproduced by the nervous mechanism of Mrs. Piper's organism, and of\nwhich the consciousness communicating is as little aware as the\nordinary person talking into a phonographic mouth-piece is aware of\nthe registration on the revolving cylinder. The sense of hearing for\nthis consciousness appears to be in the hand, and the sitter must talk\nto the hand to be understood. I do not profess to be able to give\nany satisfactory explanation of some of the processes which I am\ndescribing. What the precise relation is between this consciousness\ni 1 describe what occurs now, and not what occurred in the earlier trances when\nPhinuit \" controlled \" ; but so far as the hand is concerned, the process is the same\nas when Phinuit used to manifest.\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 399\nand the movements of the hand I do not know. I do not know\nwhether or not the motor centres of the brain ordinarily concerned in\nthe movements of hand and arm are in operation or not. I incline to\nthink not, certainly not in the ordinary way. The writmg produced\nis very different from Mrs. Piper's ordinary writing ; it shows individual\ndifferences, but belonging to the same generic type on the whole, with\ndifferent alleged communicators, and does not resemble the writing of\nthose persons when living any more than it does Mrs. Piper's.i The\nthoughts that pass through the consciousness controlling the hand tend\nto be written, and one of the difficulties apparently is to prevent the\nwriting out of thoughts which are not intended for the sitter. Other\n\" indirect communicators \" frequently purport to be present, and the\n\" consciousness of the hand \" listens to them with the hand as though\nthey were close by, as it listens to the sitters, presenting the palm of\nthe hand, held in slightly different positions for the purpose by\ndifferent \"direct communicators,\" so as to bring usually the region of\nthe junction between the little finger and the palm towards the mouth\nof the sitter. The writing at its best is liable to include occasionally\nremarks not intended to be written, words apparently addressed by an\n\" indirect communicator \" to the consciousness of the hand, or by the\nconsciousness of the hand to an \"indirect communicator,\" or by\n\"indirect communicators\" to one another; or, in worse cases, where\nthe power of inhibition seems to have been almost entirely wanting,\nthe wandering thoughts of the \" direct communicator \" were appar\nently produced in writing in incoherent fragments, mixed up with his\nattempts at replies to questions of the sitter, and bits of conversation,\nas it were, between him and other \" indirect communicators.\" But\nthere never seemed to be any confusion between the personality using\nthe hand, whether this was \" clear \" or not, and the personality using\nthe voice.\nThe behaviour of the hand during a sitting, not merely in relation\nto the sitters, but in relation to the one or more \" indirect communi\ncators,\" for whom some \" direct communicator \" professes to act as\namanuensis, is not easily described in words. It behaves at times\nas though the \"direct communicator\" was holding a conversation\nwith the \" indirect communicators \" (when sometimes the writing\nmechanism goes on producing writing movements while the hand is\nheld in the air), listening to them as described above ; at other times\nas though one consciousness withdrew from the hand to make room for\ni Miss R. (p. 202), whose friend was apparently the first to write at all, using the\nhand while \" controlling \" the body generally, and also using the hand while Phinuit\nwas controlling the voice, has shown me some of this early writing and some writing\nof her friend when living. Some peculiarities were common to both, but not enough\nto found an argument upon as' to the identity of the communicator.\n\f400 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nanother ; at other times as though the sudden arrival of another\n\"indirect communicator\" nearly ousted the \"direct communicator\"\nfrom the hand ; and it shows various other intelligent relations. The\ncommunicators themselves do not profess to know precisely what\noccurs between the thinking of their thoughts and the production of\nthe writing, or to know even what movements of the hand are being\nproduced.\nThe statements of the \" communicators \" as to what occurs on the\nphysical side may be put in brief general terms as follows. We all\nhave bodies composed of \" luminiferous ether\" enclosed in our flesh\nand blood bodies. The relation of Mrs. Piper's etherial body to the\netherial world, in which the \" communicators \" claim to dwell, is such\nthat a special store of peculiar energy is accumulated in connection with\nher organism, and this appears to them as \"a light.\" Mrs Piper's\netherial body is removed by them, and her ordinary body appears as\na shell filled with this \" light.\" Several \" communicators \" may be in\ncontact with this light at the same time. There are two chief\n\" masses \" of it in her case, one in connection with the head, the other\nin connection with the right arm and hand. Latterly, that in connec\ntion with the hand has been \"brighter\" than that in connection with\nthe head. If the \" communicator \" gets into contact with the \" light \"\nand thinks his thoughts, they tend to be reproduced by movements in\nMrs. Piper's organism. Very few can produce vocal effects, even\nwhen in contact with the \"light\" of the head, but practically all can\nproduce writing movements when in contact with the \" light \" of the\nhand. Upon the amount and brightness of this \" light,\" cateris\nparibus, the communications depend. When Mrs. Piper is in ill-\nhealth, the \" light \" is feebler, and the communications tend to be less\ncoherent. It also gets used up during a sitting, and when it gets dim\nthere is a tendency to incoherence even in otherwise clear communi\ncators. In all cases, coming into contact with this \" light \" tends to\nproduce bewilderment, and if the contact is continued too long, or the\n\" light \" becomes very dim, the consciousness of the communicator\ntends to lapse completely.\nReturning to my own description of what occurs, independently of\nsuch statements, there are usually marked indications, towards the end\nof a sitting, of increasing weakness on the part of the controlling\nconsciousness, and it ceases to manifest, withdrawing apparently from\nany governance of Mrs. Piper's organism and leaving it in what\nappears to be much the same state as immediately after what seemed\nto be the complete disappearance of Mrs. Piper's consciousness when\nshe was passing into trance. Once more the body appears inert and\nlifeless for a short time, and then Mrs. Piper's consciousness appears in\nthe reverse order of its disappearance. But in passing out of trance,\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 401\nthe stages are usually of longer duration than when she enters it.\nShe frequently repeats statements apparently made to her by the\n\"communicators\" while she is in the purely \"subliminal\" stage,\nas though she was a \" spirit \" controlling her body but not in full\npossession of it, and, after her supraliminal consciousness has begun\nto surge up into view, she frequently has visions apparently of the\ndistant or departing \" communicators.\"\nThere are many questions that will occur to the reader of this\nshort outline of what seems to take place, questions for most of which,\nprobably, I have at present no answer. But it is important that he\nshould remember constantly, in considering the value of the resulting\nmanifestations, what the difficulties are under which the communi\ncators labor, if they are what they claim to be. Where the \" direct\ncommunicator \" is one who acts as intermediary owing to his greater\nexperience with the machine of Mrs. Piper's organism, some of the\nsources of confusion can be avoided,\u2014or rather lessened in degree,\nsince we still have to allow for the sources of confusion in the inter\nmediary himself,\u2014but we must add the difficulty that the \" indirect\ncommunicator \" has in conveying the thoughts that he wishes to\nconvey to the intermediary ; and this is superposed upon the bewilder\nment produced in the \" indirect communicator \" by his relation\nto the \" light.\" Then floods of excited emotion at the presence of\nincarnate friends, dominant ideas that disturbed him when he was\nincarnate himself, the desire to render advice and assistance to\nother living friends and relatives, etc., etc., all crowd upon his\nmind ; the sitter begins to ask questions about matters having no\nrelation to what he is thinking about, he gets more and more\nbewildered, more and more comatose, loses his \"grasp\" of the \"light,\"\nand drifts away, perhaps to return several times and go through a\nsimilar experience.\nI remind the reader again that I am here giving the conclusions\nto which I have myself been led, and I wish to emphasise strongly\ncertain points as to the condition of the \" communicators,\" if they\nare, as I believe, the persons they claim to be. I shall endeavour to\nillustrate their position from a somewhat different point of view, and\nas briefly as possible.\nThe physical world that I know is presented to me within my\nconsciousness. I suppose that if I could have regarded that world\nduring past ages I should have seen, displayed therein, a gradually\nincreasing complexity of manifestations of such a kind that I should\neventually have been forced to the conclusion that consciousnesses like\nmy own, as regards their manifestations on this planet, have gradually\nbeen developed during a very long period, in connection with the\ndevelopment of specific fleshly organisms. Analogous evolutions, but\n\f402 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nvastly shortened in time, occur now in connection with the growth\nof individual human organisms. In these two main ways human\nconsciousness has come to manifest itself in my physical world in\nconnection with human organisms. I do not know directly the\nconsciousnesses connected with these human organisms ; I know them\nindirectly through the manifestations of the organisms, and it is\nthrough such manifestations alone, directly or indirectly, that I know\nthem. Putting aside for the present any consideration of whether such\nhuman consciousness as I believe thus to manifest itself can manifest\nitself directly in connection with movements of inorganic matter,\u2014\nas alleged in relation to certain \" so-called physical phenomena of\nspiritualism,\"\u2014I may say that human consciousness, if it manifests\nitself in my physical world, does so primarily and with an almost, if\nnot quite, exclusive universality, by changes in a human organism.\nAnd with changes of a particular organism I come to associate in\nmy own mind changes which I think of symbolically, as being in a\nparticular consciousness not my own. I observe also that these other\nconsciousnesses, as I suppose, vary and cease and renew their manifesta\ntions in special ways, as I infer from the behaviour of the organisms.\nThere are cases of accident, fever, insanity, epilepsy, double personality,\nsleep, trance, amesthetisation, etc. The manifestations of consciousness\nunder such varying circumstances present at times very great variations\nfrom the normal. I believe that, for all these organisms eventually,\nthere comes a time when consciousness ceases entirely to manifest itself\nby changes therein. When this occurs I usually call the change in\nthe organism death.i If the consciousnesses that manifested through\nsuch organisms are still persisting, I should suppose that the easiest\nway for them to manifest again in my physical world would be by\nsome such way as they had previously manifested, by means of a\nhuman organism. The difficulty would be to obtain an organism. I\ncannot produce changes in other organisms directly as I can in my\nown ; neither can I, under ordinary circumstances, produce, directly,\nchanges in the consciousnesses which I suppose to be connected with\nthose organisms. Occasionally however such effect seems to be pro\nduced, as shown in the evidence for telepathy, where one human\nconsciousness affects another without using any assignable manifesta\ntions of organisms. I may suppose then that if the consciousnesses\nwhich have ceased to manifest in what I may call \" their own \"\ni 1 purposely leave open such questions as : whether such consciousnesses existed\nin any individualised form or not prior to their manifestations to me through\norganisms ; or whether the consciousnesses which have temporarily ceased to manifest,\nbut later again manifest, through their own organisms, are or are not, during the\ncessation of such manifestations, in a state similar to that of those whose organisms\nhave died.\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 403\norganisms, are still existing, they may be able to affect, in some cases\nat least, and to some extent, those which still continue to manifest\nthemselves through organisms. I should also suppose that, owing to\nthe fact that the same general fundamental structure, the result of a\nlong process of evolution, is common to human organisms, if any such\nconsciousness could be brought into a similar relation with an organism\nnot its own that it once had with its own, it would be able to manifest\nitself to some extent. But its manifestations would be affected accord\ning to differences between that organism and its own, and could in no\ncase be precisely identical with those which it showed with its own.\nIf I suppose such an event to occur, I must seek for analogies, when\nconsidering what results to expect, in what occurs when the conscious\nness of a person I call living fails to manifest in the ordinary way\nowing to some incompleteness of control over its organism. Such\nincompleteness is shown in relation to states like those which I have\nindicated above. There may be an inability to control different parts\nof the organism, the organism itself may be injured, or its working\nmay be temporarily disordered in a variety of ways. I find further\nthat there may be states of some particular organism, when not only\nare the manifestations to me of the consciousness connected therewith\nlimited and disordered in an extraordinary manner, but my manifesta\ntions to that other consciousness are also limited in an extraordinary\nmanner, and owing to certain deficiencies which have some direct\nrelation to the state of the organism which I perceive. For example,\nthat other consciousness may neither \"see\" my organism as it usually\ndoes, nor \" hear \" its voice ; it may both \"see\" and \"hear\" and yet not\nrecognise ; it may see and hear and recognise, but yet be temporarily\nunable to recall its memories; it may even be unable to tell its name; it\nmay be entirely incapable of following and understanding the simplest\nquestions. If I observe the returning manifestations of consciousness\nin an organism which has ceased for some time to manifest any\nconsciousness, as after etherisation or profound sleep, and which is\notherwise not disordered in its brain, I observe many differences with\ndifferent organisms. In some cases the consciousness very soon\nmanifests itself in its ordinary fulness. In other cases the process of\ncomplete manifestation is very slow ; and in spite of all my efforts to\nobtain some recognition of myself or some replies to my questions, the\nmanifestations continue for some time to be incoherent. I may\nsucceed in obtaining a partial recognition, in stimulating the pro\nduction of maniestations which indicate glimpses of clear conscious\nness, but there is often a tendency to relapse into incoherence and\nirrelevancy of manifestation which indicate an almost complete\nwant of control on the part of what I call that other conscious\nness. I find that this incoherency tends to persist until what I\n\f404 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\ncall the waking stage begins. This in ordinary cases is apt to be\nfirst accompanied by the manifestation of memories vivid in that\nconsciousness just before it ceased to manifest through its organism,\noften mingled apparently with other ideas which it seems to have\nhad just before renewing its manifestations. Slowly it seems to gain\ncontrol over its recollections, to be able to disentangle this from\nthat, to realise the surroundings of its organism, to understand the\nquestions to which it has been responding by various kinds of irrele\nvant manifestations, and to become finally \" normal \" and \" awake.\"\nThe relation of the consciousness to its organism in the preceding\nstage has been such that there has been apparently a confusion of\ncomprehension of me, and not merely a confusion of manifestation to\nme. I need not extend these considerations into greater detail. In a\nconsciousness beginning to manifest through its own organism after\na period of cessation from manifestation I should expect certain\ndeficiencies. If for a long time prior to the cessation of its manifesta\ntions it had shown continual symptoms of disorder, I should expect\nsimilar symptoms to appear on the first recurrence of its manifestations.\nIn all cases I should expect at first a confusion in understanding me,\nas well as a confusion in manifesting to me. If the cessation from\nmanifestation has been very complete and has lasted a very long time,\nI should expect a greater bewilderment, for a short time at least, when\nit began again to manifest. These deficiencies and bewilderments I\nshould expect to be much more marked if such a consciousness, instead\nof trying to manifest itself once more through its own organism with\nwhich it had practised for years, were restricted for its manifestations\nto another organism. In such an event I should expect the manifesta\ntions to partake in the first instance of the same lack of inhibitory\ncontrol, the same inability to appreciate my injunctions and questions,\nthe same dreamy irrelevancy that characterises all the manifestations,\nin my physical world, of a consciousness that has temporarily ceased\nto manifest therein and begins once more to reveal itself in what I call\nthe waking state, \u2014varying in individual cases as I find they do in\nordinary life, \u2014-whether it be after ordinary sleep, or prolonged coma,\nor amesthetisation, etc.\u2014but with a tendency for the incoherency\nof the manifestations to be much more pronounced inasmuch as the\nconsciousness is trying to regain its wakefulness towards me by an\nunwonted way. Whether such a consciousness could ever regain its\ncomplete former fulness in my world through another organism\nseems highly improbable. What I should expect to find is that\nth ough another organism it could only partially wake. Hence I\nmust suppose that even the best of direct \" communicators \" through\nMrs. Piper's trance is partly asleep. This is the first point I wish\nto emphasise.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 405\nThe second point is one that I have already mentioned more than\nonce, but it needs iterating and reiterating to bring it home to the\nreader. I have not had enough experience with different \" communi\ncators \" using the voice under circumstances permitting of adequate\ninvestigation, to come to any such positive conclusion as to the\ncloseness of relation between the thoughts passing through the\n\"communicator's\" mind and the words uttered,\u2014as I have been able\nto reach in the case of the \" communicators* \" producing writing. After\nhaving endeavoured as best I could to follow the writing of thousands\nof pages, with scores of different writers, after having put many\ninquiries to the communicators themselves, and after having analysed\nnumerous spontaneously occurring incidents of all kinds, I have no sort\nof doubt whatever but that the consciousness producing the writing\u2014\nwhatever that consciousness be, whether Mrs. Piper's secondary\npersonality or the real communicator as alleged,\u2014is not conscious of\ntvriting, and that the thoughts that pass through \" his \" mind\ntend to be reproduced in writing by some part of the writing\nmechanism of Mrs. Piper's organism. This writing mechanism is\nfar from perfect, and it frequently produces words that cannot be\nread. This entails a repetition of the word and checks the thought\nof the communicator, already reduced to the necessity of thinking\nhis words at the slow rate of writing, and of excluding other\nthoughts that he does not wish written, in a state when he has\nalready been steeped into a state of partial sleep by coming into\nrelation with an organism not his own, for the purpose of manifesting\nin my physical world.\nBut I must draw this part of my Report to a close. I am far from\nthinking that there are no difficulties yet remaining to be solved,\nthough many of what were once difficulties to myself in the way of\nbelieving that these phenomena were the result of the agency of\n\"deceased\" persons have been removed by the fuller evidence pre\nsented by G. P. and other communicators acting directly, taken in\nconnection with the failures of yet other classes of communicators, and\nall together regarded in the light of the considerations which I have\ntried to make clear to the reader concerning the restricting but\nnecessary conditions of communication. What my future beliefs may\nbe, I do not know. Rontgen suggested that certain special effects\nproduced in his famous experiments were due to rays whose vibrations\nwere longitudinal to the path of propagation, but later experiments\nhave tended to show that they are due to vibrations of the same\ngeneral character as those with which we were familiar, but of a\nhigher order of frequency. And it may be that further experiment\nin the lines of investigation before us may lead me to change my\nview ; but at the present time I cannot profess to have any doubt\n\f406 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nbut that the chief \" communicators,\" to whom I have referred in\nthe foregoing pages, are veritably the personalities that they claim\nto be, that they have survived the change we call death, and that\nthey have directly communicated with us whom we call living, through\nMrs. Piper's entranced organism. There are doubtless many inci\ndents that may seem inexplicable in accordance with the hypothesis\nwhich my experience has compelled me to adopt. I also hold the\ngeneral doctrine of Evolution, but unless my memory deceives me,\nthere are many biological incidents which have not yet been\nfully explained on that theory. What I have said, so far, taken in\nconnection with the further detailed evidence given in the Appendices,\nrepresents the substantial part of my Report. In Part II. I shall\ndeal with various objections that may be raised to the views which I\nhave here expressed, and shall refer also to some statements\u2014giving\nillustrations\u2014made by the \"communicators\" concerning the writings\nand their production. I shall also add some accounts of other incidents\nwhich occurred chiefly during the period 1896-7, and which go to\nstrengthen the general evidence which I have offered in this Part of\nmy Report, and if there are any notable inadequacies or failures which\nhave come under my own attention, and which are not adduced by\nthose who differ with my conclusions, I shall endeavour also to give\ndue consideration to these. By the superficial observer, especially if\nhe has not revised his conceptions of what he should expect from the\n\" returning dead,\" and does not keep constantly before his mind the\nconditions involved in their returning through Mrs. Piper's entranced\norganism,\u2014the fragmentary and obscure utterances of which he will\nfind so many examples in the records, might not unnaturally be\nregarded, in the incipient stages of a \" spirit's \" effort to communicate,\nas the incoherent output of a disordered and disrupting intelligence ;\nbut a closer analysis reveals that in many of these the want of\ncoherence lies not primarily in the source of the information, but\nin the new untried methods of its distribution. Behind them is\nmanifest, and grows more and more manifest, the suggestion of\nsome larger knowledge, the presence of some persistent personality\nthat knew and knows us well. And my main hope, as I offer\nthis Report to our members, is that it may be serviceable to other\ninvestigators,\u2014whether they a^ree with my views or not,\u2014as regards\nthe understanding of the conditions under which these alleged com\nmunications come.\nI shall now, before concluding, give a brief account of the recent\nchanges in Mrs. Piper's trance, and offer some practical considerations\nwhich seem to me to be directly suggested by the position which I\nhave taken in this section of my Report.\n\fxxxnl.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 407\n\u00a7 7. Recent Changes in Mrs. Piper's Trance.\nIf the conclusions to which I have been led concerning the real\nexistence of the personalities professing to manifest through Mrs.\nPiper's trance are justified, certain very obvious inferences may be\ndrawn, some of which I shall now indicate. If \" communicators \"\nvary in their ability to use Mrs. Piper's nervous mechanism as a means\nof communication, it seems desirable that only those who can use it\nbest should be allowed to use it at all. Again, those communicators\nwho were disordered in their minds when living, should be debarred\nfrom the use of the mechanism until, at least, their disorder has dis\nappeared. If my consciousness were temporarily withdrawn from my\norganism, and my organism could be used in the meantime by another\nconsciousness, I should object to its being used by any consciousness\nless moral and intelligent than my own. Also, if my conclusions\nhold that greater familiarity on the part of the manifesting intelli\ngence with the use of the mechanism conduces to clearer communica\ntions, we are likely to obtain the most satisfactory explanations\nof the rationale of the phenomena so far as they appear to such\ncommunicating intelligence, by encouraging the continued use of the\nmechanism by the same operator until he can express himself as fully\nand freely as the development of the mechanism appears to allow.\nIf, further, the personalities concerned are actually \" spirits,\" it is\ndesirable to obtain as operators such individuals as know most about\nthe use of such \" mediumistic mechanisms,\" and about the relations\nbetween the \" other world \" and ours. The same considerations, of\ncourse, apply to any other case similar to Mrs. Piper's, and especially\nin the early stages of its development. If we have a delicate proto\nplasmic machine that may conceivably be used as a means of com\nmunication from \" another world \" to this, that is only beginning to be\nused as a machine, that is probably much more complex and much\nmore delicate than any material machine of man's invention, that may\nnot improbably be a machine in the incipient stages only of its evolu\ntion, and the evolution of which may be marred in all kinds of ways\nby injudicious handling\u2014then I say that we should make the most\nstrenuous efforts possible to put that machine into the most experienced\nhands\u2014not for the purpose of forcing it into the production of\nimmediate results, but for the purpose of developing it in the first\nplace into the most perfect form of which it is susceptible. Certain\nlenses are ground for years before they are used in telescopes. The\nmusician practises for a goodly portion of a lifetime before he is a\nskilled performer. \" Do you think that I am easier to be played on\nthan a pipe ? \"\n\f408 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nSuch considerations as these have been forced upon me especially\nby the advent of the communicating personalities professing to be those\nwhom W. Stainton Moses when living alleged to be the communicators\nthrough his organism. In the summer of 1895, when a friend of mine\nwas having a series of sittings with Mrs. Piper, and asking questions\nof G. P., certain statements were made by G. P. denying the so-called\n\"obsession by evil spirits.\" My friend referred to the alleged \"Spirit\nTeachings \" published by W. S. Moses, and the result of the conversa\ntion was that later on W. S. Moses purported to communicate at my\nfriend's request through Mrs. Piper's trancei. He was confused and\nincoherent,\u2014and G. P. offered a warning to that effect. He gave\nentirely wrong names in reply to questions concerning the real identity\nof the Imperator, Doctor and Rector mentioned in his \" Spirit\nTeachings,\" and failed later in attempting to answer test-questions\npropounded by some of his friends. Later still, however, he did\nfurnish some private information unknown to the sitters, and after\nwards verified in England, and well adapted so far as it went as an\nindication of identity.\nI shall not enter into detail concerning the professed appearances\nof W. S. Moses at later sittings. Mrs. Piper gave few sittings in\nthe winter of 1895-6, and early in 1896 underwent a second opera\ntion, as I have already mentioned, resuming her sittings in October\nof that year. I pointed out to G. P. the importance of making\nW. S. Moses \" clear,\" and getting the answers to my test questions.\nThe final result was that W. S. Moses professed to get the assis\ntance of his former \"controls,\" who after communicating on\nvarious occasions directly in November and December, 1896, and\nJanuary, 1897, demanded that the control of Mrs. Piper's \"light\"\nshould be placed in their hands. In other words, \" Imperator \"\nclaimed that the indiscriminate experimenting with Mrs. Piper's\norganism should stop, that it was a \" battered and worn \" machine,\nand needed much repairing ; that \" he \" with his \" assistants,\"\n\"Doctor,\" \"Rector,\" &c., would repair it as far as possible, and that\nin the meantime other persons must be kept away. I then for the\nfirst time explained to the normal Mrs. Piper about W. S. Moses\nand his alleged relation to \"Imperator,\" and she was willing to follow\nmy advice and try this new experiment,\u2014to which, I may say, I was\nrepeatedly and emphatically urged by the communicating G. P. I\nexplained at the following sitting to \"Imperator\" that the medium\nand myself agreed to the change. Much of what followed later was\npersonal and non-evidential. It was stated that there were many\ni A more detailed account of this incident given by my friend himself, will be\npublished in Part II. of my Report.\n\fxxxin.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 409\ndifficulties in the way of clear communication, due chiefly to the fact\nthat so many inferior and perturbed communicators had bsen using the\nmachine. Phinuit's last appearance was on January 26th, 1897. Later\non, other alleged \" communicators \" were specified as persons who\nwould not injure the \"light,\" in addition to what I might call W. S.\nMoses's group, and various persons who have had sittings in previous\nyears with Mrs. Piper had opportunities of being present, and some\nnew sitters also. Those who had sittings in previous years and who\nhave been present since the change which I have described, were all\nstruck by the improvement in the clearness and coherence of the\ncommunications from their \" deceased \" friends. Most remarkable has\nbeen the change in Mrs. Piper herself, in her general feeling of well-\nbeing, and in her manner of passing into trance. Instead of the some\nwhat violent contortions which she was apt to show in earlier years\nwhen Phinuit \"controlled,\" she passes into trance calmly, easily,\ngently, and whereas there used to be frequently indications of\ndislike and shrinking when she was losing consciousness, the\nreverse is now the case ; she seems rather to rejoice at her\n\" departure,\" and to be in the first instance depressed and disappointed\nwhen, after the trance is over, she \" comes to herself \" once more in\nthis \"dark world\" of ours, and realises her physical surroundings.\nVarious attempts by these new \"controls\" to describe contemporaneous\nincidents occurring elsewhere in this world have been notable failures.\nOn the other hand there have been a few cases under this regime\nwhere opportunity has been given for tests purporting to come from\nrecently \"deceased\" persons. And in these cases, so far as I can\njudge, and so far as the incidents go, the results as a whole have been\nmuch clearer and more coherent than they were in similar cases\nformerly. \"Imperator\" occasionally purported to produce the writing,\nnot, however, as amanuensis for any other person, and seemed to be\nfree, in a way that no other communicator was free, from \" writing \"\nthe disturbing thoughts of other communicators. The chief amanuensis\nnow purports to be \" Rector.\" G. P. would occasionally write a\nlittle, making some personal inquiries, etc. It has been stated\nrepeatedly that the \" channel is not yet clear,\" that the machine\nis still in process of repair ; and it has been prophesied that I\nshall myself return eventually to America and spend several years\nfurther in the investigation of Mrs. Piper's trance, and that more\nremarkable evidence of identity will be given than any heretofore\nobtained. I hope that this prophecy may be realised and that\nI may be able to present such additional evidence in some future\nReport.\nIn my own view, whether this particular experiment succeeds or\nnot, it is obviously the right kind of experiment.\n\f410 [part\nRichard Hodgsan.\nWe do not regard it as useless employment to seek for the best\nconditions possible in, say, ordinary thought-transference experiments.\nIf the percipient fails when sitting in an uncomfortable position, or in\na foul atmosphere, or when disturbed by frequent noises, or by the\nconstant interruption of his thoughts by the remarks of persons\npresent, or by continual change of the class of object selected for\nexperiment, or after much exhaustion, we should scarcely think it wise\nto insist on one or other of these conditions, nor should we infer that\nthe failing percipient was a person telepathically insensitive. By\nremoving these interfering conditions as far as possible, we may\nsucceed in getting remarkable results. The case is sufficiently analogous\nto that of the supposed communicator through Mrs. Piper's trance.\nAs a conclusion from prolonged and varied experience I have, as I\nbelieve, ascertained that the confusions and incoherencies of the sup\nposed communicator, while partly due to its own peculiar state or\nmake-up, are partly due to various other causes which are, more or\nless, removable,\u2014and where not altogether removable, the incoherent\nresults of them, when the causes are understood, become more in\ntelligible. This is rather fact than theory, and is true whatever theory\nwe adopt about the communicator,\u2014whether we regard it as a mani\nfestation of Mrs. Piper's personality, or of some other intelligence.\nAmong these other causes of confusion is the physical weakness of Mrs.\nPiper's organism during the trance, whether this prevails throughout\nthe sitting owing to Mrs. Piper's ill health, or whether it becomes\nmanifest only in the latter part of the tranoe, owing to the growing\nexhaustion consequent upon her loss of energy during the trance. I\nspeak of \"weakness\" and \"loss of energy.\" What it is that gets\nused up during the trance I do not definitely know, but that there is\nsomething that does get used up, that represents directly or indirectly\nsome peculiar form of energy, that when this is abundant the commu\nnications are clearer, and that when, cteteris paribus, it approaches\nexhaustion, the communications become obscure and even absolutely\nincoherent,i I have no doubt.\nAnother cause of perturbation in the directly communicating\nintelligence is the presence of other intelligences\u2014other than those of\nwhich the sitters are directly and consciously aware as users of the\nhand or voice. (These other intelligences, of course, purport to be\n\" spirits,\" but I believe, and once more repeat, to avoid misunderstand\nings, that my conclusions as to conditions hold good whatever these\nintelligences are.) They frequently\u2014whether in a way unknown to us,\nand which may be telepathic, or by processes in the medium's mentation\ni In other words, the consciousness manifesting itself is, from the point of view\nof its manifestations to me, lapsing into complete sleep.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 411\nlike those of the association of ideas \u2014inject their more or less irrelevant\nthoughts or words into the writing or speech of the directly com\nmunicating intelligence. This in actual practice, whatever the real\nexplanation may be, can be largely prevented by a strong appeal to\nthose other intelligences to keep away and to keep others away, and\nto allow the then and there communicator to express what he has to\nsay without interruption. Phinuit, for example, claims to have done\nmuch work, while the hand has been used for writing, in keeping back,\nso to speak, various other would-be communicators. Interruptions,\nnevertheless, were frequent enough until the advent of the group\nconnected with \" W. Stainton Moses,\" and the establishment of their\nsupervision. Whatever else has been done, it seems to me that one\nresult of this change has been to make the way clearer, and free from\ninterruptions and from the admixture of apparently foreign elements\nthat prevailed so largely in earlier sittings. The new \"controls\"\nclaim to have both the desire and the power to exclude \" inferior \"\nintelligences, whom they speak of as \"earth-bound spirits,\" from the\nuse of the \"light,\" and as a matter of fact, the perturbations referred\nto have practically disappeared. That the exclusion of influences that\nare continually changing,\u2014and that may be otherwise not conducive\nto the clearest results\u2014is a desirable thing, is also perhaps indicated\nby the methods which we have found most successful in forms of\nordinary telepathic experiment.\nWe there take into consideration the attitude of mind of agent\nand percipient ; we give the percipient a chance to receive impressions\nof one object before we hurry him along to another; we have regard to\nwhat may be the extremely sensitive state of his \" telepathic faculty,\"\nwhatever that may be, and whether it resides in his subliminal\nconsciousness or not.\nSimilarly, if we find a particularly good agent and a particularly\ngood percipient, we should think it wise to give them the best\nopportunity possible, in long series of experiments, to get better\nresults, and, by varying the conditions, to ascertain if possible what\nare the limits of, and what the causes most conducive to, clear tele\npathic communication.\nAnd so I think that in Mrs. Piper's and similar cases, the\nintroduction of persons more or less indiscriminately may not be\na condition for general success, but a condition for perpetual\nblundering. We can all use telephones now ; but when Iteis and\nBell and Blake and others were making experiments on lines that\neventually led to satisfactory instruments, they would hardly have\nthought it worth while to let the general public spend their time\nin listening to more or less inarticulate noises through their incipient\nreceiving apparatus.\n2 E\n\f412 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nNow, if Mrs. Piper's organism represents one end of a line the\nother end of which is in the so-called \" spirit world,\" or if there is a\nrecognisable possibility of this, it seems to me eminently desirable\nthat we should try to find out what will improve the line and the\ntransmitting and receiving apparatus, and if possible obtain knowledge\nconcerning the methods to be used in making and improving other\nsimilar machines.\n\fxxxni.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 413\nAPPENDIX I.\nExtracts and Abridgments from Stenographic Reports oj Thirteen\nSittings, November 22nd, 1892-January 30th, 1893.\nThese sittings were held at the house of Mr. Howard, for the\npurpose chiefly of obtaining further information concerning George\nPelham.

Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Howard, when the name Louis\nwas written, thought of Louis R , who was German on his father's\nside, was an intimate friend of theirs, and had often sat in Mr.\nHoward's library, and indeed in the very chair occupied by Mrs. Piper.\nThe remarks, \"He wants to see Billie\"\u2014\"Go out and tell him to come,\"\nevidently referred to William L. Parker, at whose sittings on March\n10th and 25th, 1892, Louis R purported to be communicating.\nMr. Parker's house is but a stone's throw distant from Mr. Howard's.\nG. P. stopped writing, and soon afterwards Phinuit insisted upon\nwriting, and wrote \" Foxcroft \" in mirror writing. This was not\ni J. Mr. Howard. K. Mrs. Howard.\n2 E 2\n\f414 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\ndeciphered at the time, and Phinuit then wrote it in capitals, and also\nin ordinary writing. I knew nothing of this name, and explained to\nPhinuit at some length that we wished to talk to him and George, and\nthat unless something extremely important was involved in the way of\na test, he must keep all other persons away. I learned afterwards,\nthat Foxcroft C , deceased, was a fellow artist and friend of Louis\nR , that he was known somewhat to the Howards, had also, when\nliving, sat in Mr. Howard's library, and in the chair occupied by\nMrs. Piper.\n. . . Later, G. P. took direct control of the voice . . . -\"What can I\ndo for you to prove it all ? I am anxious, I am impatient. ... I want\nto ask Jim about the letter that Orenberg wrote him in regard to my passing\nout. It was all right, Jim, don't you fear.\" [It was Orenberg who first\ninformed me of G. 's death, by telegram, followed by letter. The remark made\nwith reference to the letter seemed to show a specific knowledge of its con\ntents. \u2014J.] \"Father is writing this minute.\" Q. \" What is he writing ? \"\n\"Simply a letter.\" [Since ascertained from Mr. P. that, as far as he can\nremember, he was not writing any letter at or near the time in question.]\nG. P : Get me my hair. [Package brought from another room.]\nMother gave it to you. She had it a long time. [Mrs. Howard had for\ngotten to bring this into the room, was not thinking of it, and had received\nit from Mrs. Pelham since the last sitting in the previous spring. Mrs.\nPelham had possessed the hair for a long time, as it was some of George's\nbaby hair.\u2014R. H.].\nSecond. November 28<\/t, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard, and (part of the time) their eldest\ndaughter Katharine, R. H. and Reporter.\nPhinuit : He [G. P.] has been to see his father, and he has seen, he has\ntaken a book and carried it to have it printed. [His father had collected his\npoems and had them printed in a small volume, which appeared just before\nthe first sitting of this series].\nDuring the early part of the sitting, Katharine entered the room and sat\ndown in a remote corner. Almost immediately Phinuit said \"he wants to\nsee who is Katrine 1 \" Katharine comes over, and G. P. takes control of\nthe voice, and personal greetings follow. . . . Recognition of dress, also\nof shawl, which was asked for, and which was placed over Mrs. Piper's\nshoulders.\n\" What is it takes me to Paris ? \" The shawl had been worn in Paris\nfrequently during a year, but there is no reason to suppose that G. P.\nliving was aware of this.\nG. P. inquired what had been done with a special picture which he had\nowned.\nMrs. H. : That got torn up after you passed out, but here is a picture that\nI don't know whether you will recognise, but you used to know the place.\n[G. P. puts picture on top of the head].\nG. P. : What is this 1 This is your summer house.\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 415\nMrs. H. : Yes, you have got it right.\nG. P. : But I have forgotten the name of the town.\nG. P. : 0, the little brick house and the little vine, grape-vine, some call\nthem. Yes, I remember it all ; it comes back as distinctly as the daylight.\n. . . Where is the little out-house t [All correct. The little brick hen\nhouse that, like the house itself, was solidly built of brick just did not come\ninto the picture, but came to the very edge of it, so it was natural for George\nto ask where it was. The grape-vine that covered the whole house up to the\nroof was a striking feature of it.\u2014K.]. . . .\nMrs. H. There is the painting [handing another picture].\nG. P. : No, I have no recollection of that.\nMrs. H. : No, I painted it when you were not there. You never\nsaw that.\nG. P. : It is not fresh to me at all ; but this [fingering the photo of the\nhouse] is very clear. Katharine.\nMrs. H. : She remembers that too.\nG. P. : She was a little thing. Then you bought a place at some ville\n[Katharine's age when we left D was six, nearly seven. Wc first bought\nthe place at X ville in 1886]. Further references to personal incidents\nat D . \" Katharine, how is the violin 1 \" [She plays the violin]. . . .\nTo hear you playing it is horrible, horrible. . . .\nMrs. H. : But don't you see she likes her music because it is the best\nshe has.\nG. P. : No, but that is what I used to say, that it is horrible. [George\nwas always more or less annoyed by hearing Katharine practise when she\nwas beginning the violin as a little child.\u2014K.]\nG. P. : [A basket put into G. P.'s hands which he had given as a\nChristmas present.] That is mine. Where is my lamp arrangement ? I\nwas very fond of that, you know. [He had also expressly got a small light\nshade that could be moved round the shade of an ordinary lamp to cut off\nthe light from the eye, and he had used this much when living. He had\nmade other references to this in previous sittings.] .\nMrs. H. : I want you to see that [handing a paper.i]\nG. P. : You wrote that to me this morning. [It was a poem on death\nwritten that morning with G. P. in mind, but no reference to G. P.\nin it.] . . .\n[Another paper handed.i] That is a letter. That is mine. That is my\nown, but that was written a long time ago. [Correct. A letter of his\nwritten many years before.] . . .\nGive my regards to James Peirce.

See p. 317, footnote.\n\f416 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nG. P. : Where is John Hart ? I am too weak to tell you. Is that\nOrenberg? Mr. H. : Yes. G. P. : Yes, that is he. You tike that away\nand I will tell you better [referring to the wrapper which Mr. H. takes off.]\nThat is Orenberg, dear old fellow. I would like to see him. His own\nhand folded it. [It was a foreign newspaper that Mr. H. had received from\nOrenberg that morning, and had at once hidden away without telling anyone\nof it.] . . . [To Mr. H.] Got the long pipe and smoke. [Mr. Howard was in\nthe habit of smoking a long pipe in the evening, as was well known to G. P.]\n. . . [Mrs. Piper was entranced at 8. 30 p. m. G. P. leaves, and at 9.16\nshe comes out of trance, but as usual is somewhat dazed at first.]\nMrs. Piper : \"There is the man with the beard.\"\nMrs. Piper then described what she thought was a dream. \" I saw a\nbright light and a face in it, a gentleman with a beard on his face, and he\nhad a very high forehead and he was writing.\"\nR. H. : Would you know it again if you saw it 'I\nMrs. Piper : Oh, yes. I would know it, I think.\nR. H. : Well, try and recall it. [See note at end of sitting.]\n[Medium says she feels queer and as if she could turn right round and go\ninto the trance again. Does not know what is the matter with her. After\nsaying this she becomes entranced again very quickly at 9.22, and Phinuit\nappears, shouting.]\nPh. : You know you don't play that on me. George Pelham is a very-\nclever fellow, but I am going to tell you he passed by me, and do you know\nwhat he did, he let her go without signalling to me at all ; he did it by\nmistake ; he told me afterwards, and so I came back to tell you. . . .\n[To Katharine] Vous etes bonne fille. C'est la petite de madame : bonne\nfille, bonne fille, grande belle fille. [I was struck by Phinuit's speaking\nFrench all at once to Katharine, as she always speaks French with her\nsisters, having lived so long in France. There was more French than was\nhere reported, as the stenographer does not know French well, and had to\nget what wo could remember from us afterwards. Mr. Howard and I were\nmuch struck by the thoroughly French use of the word belle. Katharine is\nin no sense of the word a beautiful girl as English people generally under\nstand the word belle, but she is conspicuously a tell, well-developed, well-\nmade girl, of the sort to which belle in the French sonse would be\napplied.\u2014 K]\n. . . Phinuit : Who is Farnan ?\nMr. H. : Vernon ?\nPhinuit : I don't know how you pronounce that. It is F-a-r-n-s-w-o-r-t-h.\nR. H. : What about it >\nPhinuit : He wants to see you.\nR. H. : Wants to see me 1\nPhinuit : Not you, but this lady.\nMrs. H. : Well, what does he want to say to me? Is it a woman or a\nman '>.\nPhinuit : It is a gentleman, and do you remember your Aunt Ellen f\nMrs. H. : Yes, which Aunt Ellen ?\nPhinuit : She has got this gentleman.

Phinuit was right\u2014that is, there was a man named Farnworth, since\ndeceased, who was gardener in my uncle J 's family, and afterwards\nworked for my grandfather J , probably in 1847 ; but my grandfather\ndied before I was born, so I never saw or heard of this man before.\u2014K.]\nMrs. Howard : Tell Mr. Foxcroft his daughter is very happy. Did\nyou have a message from Mr. Foxcroft ? Foxcroft is his first name ; we\nknow his other name now ; you wrote it. [See sitting, November 22nd,\np. 413.]\nPhinuit : Oh, he told me to write it. Oh I know, but that gentleman\nwanted to send his love to her, and to be remembered to you ... so\nthat you may know he is here and it is a test. These little things sometimes\ninterrupt me greatly, and when I go to explain it to you you can't understand\nit ; but sometimes when I am talking to you I am suddenly interrupted by\nsomebody who don't realise what they are doing, and then I give you what\nthey say as near as I can, you understand that, and it is very difficult some\ntimes for me to discern it and place it in the right place. . . . Who\nis Marie, Marie [Mary] that is with him 1\nMrs. Howard : His wife.\nPhinuit : And that is Allie, Ellie, in the body, Addie.\nMrs. Howard : Addie. You have got it.\nPhinuit : She is the one he wants to send his love to. [Foxcroft C 's\ndaughter is named Addie. I know her somewhat, and she has been to see\nme in that library shortly after her father's death.\u2014K.]\nAt the previous sitting a suggestion was made that G. P. might talk or\nwrite Italian on behalf of a deceased Italian lady, Madame Elisa, and an\nattempt was made here apparently to write some Italian words. They\nwere, however, not very legible.\nMrs. Piper is apparently about to come out of trance when another\ncontrol takes possession for a few minutes, who is thought by Mrs.\nHoward to bo Elisa, and who whispers something in Italian to Mrs.\nHoward. Again Mrs. Piper is apparently about to come out of trance when\nPhinuit returns for a moment to say an revoir. [What follows is in substance\nthe conversation between Elisa and Mrs. Howard.]\nE. : Pazienza, pazienza, pazienza.\nMrs. H. : Si cara Elisa.\nE. : [Tries to give a message in Italian to her sister, but Mrs. H. could\nonly catch a few words.]\nMrs. H. : Non comprendo bene.\nE. : Taceo, pazienza, pazienza. Dire tutto a Frederica [name of sister]\na rivederla. Elisa a rivederla.\n[Signs of suffering indicating the trouble that caused the death of\nMadame Elisa.]\nMrs. H. says in Italian \"Don't suffer, Elisa.\"\nE. : Pazienza a rivederla.\nAfter Mrs. Piper comes out of trance she is shown a collection of thirty-\ntwo photographs, nine of them being of men, from which she selects a\npicture of the person whom she saw when coming out of trance the first time.\nThe photograph that she first picked out was an excellent likeness of G. P.\nShe afterwards picked out another photograph of him. She stated that she\n\f418 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nnever knew the gentleman when living. [My remembrance is that Mrs.\nPiper was left alone while she made her choice of the photographs, but I\ncannot find any notes of the incident other than the preceding statement\nmade at the time by the stenographic reporter. \u2014R. H.]\nThird. November 30th, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard, and (during part of the sitting)\ntheir daughters Katharine and Evelyn, R. H. and Reporter.\nPart of this sitting was occupied by Phinuit's attempts to obtain some in\nformation about certain articles that were presented and that had no connec\ntion with G. P.\nThere was also some writing, purporting to be Italian, written by G. P.\nat the dictation of Madame Elisa, but apparently illegible except the final\nwords for \"Good-bye.\" Most of the time was occupied by questions con\ncerning G. P's. impressions of his new state of existence, etc., and there\nwas not much of an evidential nature. Incidentally there were several\ncurious points which struck the Howards and mysolf as particularly sug\ngestive of G. P. The most important are too personal to quote, but the\nfollowing may be given.\nG. P. : [controlling the voice.] \"Take Kant and Aristotle, take Locke,\nDescartes.\" [George had a habit of pronouncing French words like English\nones, at which we have often laughed and accused him of affectation. He\npronounced Descartes in this way here.\u2014K.]\nMrs. H. : Could you have the Alexandrian library that was burned ?\nG. P. : Yes, everything. It does not make any difference how much the\nmaterial is destroyed. Plato was a philosopher and a good one. You know,\nHodgson, that was our argument, our discussion.\nR. H. : That came in certainly ; we used the old Platonic analogy.\nG. P. : Socrates was a medium. . . .\n[For remarks on this incident see pp. 363-5.]\nThere was some special conversation between G. P. and Evelyn, during\nthe last part of which the other sitters were sent away. One of the first\nthings said was, \" Well, I won't tantalise you now,\" and later on \" I used\nto torment Evelyn ; but she will forgive me, I know.\" [He used to tease\nher a great deal]. . . . \" Evelyn is a girl that can always tell how much\ntwo and two is.\"\nE. : Yes.\nG. P. : You have just learned, haven't you? You are not a great one\nfor mathematics, are you 1 [She is specially weak in mathematics.]\n[Evelyn gave the following account of her conversation] :\u2014\nShe says that she was unable to hear all that was said.\nG. P. : Now be good, Evelyn. It doesn't matter so much about your\nlessons ; being good is the most important thing of all. Do you remember\nthe little book I gave you, and wrote your name in 1 E. : Yes, I was looking\nat it but the other day. G. P. : Well, you bring it and show it to me next\ntime. [Here G. P. wrote a few words on a sheet of paper, and told E. to\nkeep these words and compare them with the handwriting in the little book.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 419\nHe told her she might tell her mother what he had said, and show her the\nwriting afterwards. The writing has no special likeness to G. P.'s].\nFourth. December 2nd, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard, Katharine Howard, R. H.,\nMr. Robert Marte, and Reporter.\n[The sitting was originally arranged for the latter part of the\nafternoon, but Mrs. Piper was unable to go into trance. The sitting\nwas then postponed till 9 p.m. Mr. Howard took Mr. Marte to his\nClub to dine, and Mrs. Piper remained with Mrs. Howard. Mr.\nHoward and Mr. Marte did not return till nearly the end of the\nsitting.\u2014R.H.]\nPhinuit took control and made some statements [afterwards ascertained to\nbe incorrect] about a scarf and a locket that were presented, and concerning\nwhich the sitters were ignorant. At 9.21 Elisa (see p. 335) took direct\ncontrol of the voice and talked a few sentences while G. P. wrote at the same\ntime. G. P. then took control of the voice, and shortly afterwards R. H.\ncame into the room, and for most of the time talked with G. P., who\nexplained some obscurities in his conversation of the previous sitting. This\ntalk was interrupted, as it were, by some remarks to Mrs. Howard.\nG. P. : Where is your friend\u2014wait until I think . . . Mrs.\nWarner ?\nMrs. H : She was here this morning, but she is not here now. I told\nher about you this morning.\nG. P. : I heard you talking with her when you were telling her about me,\nwas with you all the time, and she questions a little, she does not know\nwhether it is I or somebody else.\n[Mrs. Warner had called to see me on the morning of December 2nd, and\nI talked with her about the previous sitting, and gave her the message for\nAddie (see p. 417). She has also since confirmed G. P.'s statements as to\nher state of mind.\u2014K.] [Mrs. Warner had a sitting with Mrs. Piper in the\nearly part of the year, when her name was not mentioned. \u2014R. H.]\nG. P. : Then there is another friend I used to know, a Mrs. Eastern.\n[Pseudonym.]\nR. H. : Did Mrs. Howard know Mrs. Easton ? Was she a friend of Mrs.\nHoward ?\nMrs. H. : I don't know anybody well by the name of Easton. Oh,\nJames Peirce's sister ?\nG. P. : Yes, that is she.\nMrs. H : Well, I know her slightly.\nG. P. : Oh, I know what I have in mind. I forgot to speak to him about\nher. [Mrs. Easton is a sister of James Peirce, who had a sitting with\nMrs. Piper on April 28th, 1892. See p. 305.] [Mrs. Piper had been\nentranced for probably about an hour when] Mr. Howard and Mr. Marte\nentered the room, Mr. M. seating himself close to the medium.\nR. H. : George, can you tell me anything about this person ?\nG. P. : I don't want you to bother me ; I have\n\f420 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nR. H. : But this is very important, more important than anything else.\nG. P. [taking the hand of M. and then reaching for pencil] : Give it to\nme, I will write it.\n[The quotation marks indicate what was written, and the writing was\ndone very rapidly, and in an excited manner.]\nG. P. : \" Hello, hello. Jim, where did you see Mar \" [breaking off\nhere and shaking Mr. M.'s hand] \"oh, help me.\"\nMr. H. : We will help you.\nR. H. : Can't you talk, George ?\nG. P. : \"I was just getting weak when he came in. Hallo, Mart. How\nare you, old fellow ? \"\nMr. M. : How are you, George ?\nG. P. : \"All right. Thanks, dear old chap. I am glad to see you, dear\nold friend. How is your family ? \"\nMr. M. : They are all very well, indeed, George, all very well.\nG. P. : \"Oh, I am so glad. Have you seen father?\"\nMr. M. : Whoso father?\nG. P. : \"His father.\"\nMr. M. : Have you seen my father ?\nG. P : \" Yes, he is very well, and wishes to be remembered to you.\"\nMr. M. : Can George give his name? Can George know my father's\nname ?\nMrs. H. : Write his father's name.\nG. P. : \" Why did you not \"\nMrs. H. : What is his father's name 1\nMr. M. : Does he keep the same name there ?\nG. P. : \"come here before? I nev . . I don't know, but I will ask\nhim.

P. : \" Oh, you people are so stupid.\"\nMr. H. : Well, George, I know we are, but we cannot help it.\nG. P. : \"The fact is you all want me to work for you, but you don't care\na straw about helping me.\"\nMrs. H. : [to Mr. M.] Speak to him just as you would to anybody.\nMr. M. : It is not easy to carry on a natural conversation under the\ncircumstances, being the first time that a fellow has seen this sort of thing,\nGeorge !\nG. P. : \"Is it Mart?\"\nMrs. H. : He does care.\nMr. M. : Very much indeed.\nR. H. : George, can you talk I\nG. P. : \"I can't now, I am too weak ! \"\nMr. M. : George, have you seen your grandfather, Robert Noyes, there ?\nHave you met Robert Noyes there ?\nG. P. : \"Robert N. is all right, and so is, and so is Robert Mart. I\nknow you and am glad to see, right glad to. Oh do help me, Jim.\"\n[Shaking hands with Mr. M. again.]\nMr. M. : I will come again sometime, George.\nG. P. : \"Evolution is all right in the real life, as Darwin says, but it goes\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 421\non evoluting in the ideal life, which fact he, of course, who knew nothing\nuntil he came here.\" . . .\nMr. M. : Have you seen old Robert Noyes since you have been there 1\nG. P. : \"Kind, kind old Jim dear, please excuse, oh yes, Mart, he is as\nI thought, but kind friends you\u2014\u2014.\"\nMr. M. : Was he satisfied with your account of his conduct in the peace\nnegotiations 1\nG. P. : \"Yes, perfectly, after I explained it to him.\"\nMr. M. : Have you seen Franklin ?\nG. P. : \" Whom do you mean. ...\"\nMr. M. : I should think George would know that.\nG. P. : \" . . . Ben?\"\nMr. M. : I mean Jim's ancestors.\nG. P. : \" Yes, of course I have. He has told me all about the philosophy\nof electricity. Good-bye, friends. \" . . . \" I am so glad to have seen my\ngood friend, and hope he will come again soon.\" . . . \"Yours most\ncordially and sincerely, George Pelham.\"\nPhinuit takes control again at 10. 16. Trance ends at 10. 20.\nI have quoted the above written communication complete, as it\nillustrates very well the kind of confusion for which sitters, ignorantly,\nare partly responsible. And it may be worth while for me to\npresent my interpretation of this incident, as I am inclined after much\nlater experience to conceive it\u2014far-fetched though such an interpre\ntation may seem to persons unfamiliar by practical experience with\nMrs. Piper's trance-phenomena. Let us suppose for the moment, as is\nclaimed, that the \"energy\" available for the trance is nearly used up,\nand that, not only for this reason, but because the act of communicating\nitself benumbs the agent, G. P. is at the point, so to speak, of\nexhaustion. At this stage an old friend enters, there is a rush of\nexcitement ; G. P. immediately greets him in a natural way, but is\ncompelled by the circumstances of the case to express himself at the\nslow rate of writing. Cteteris paribus, more energy is needed to use the\nvoice than to use the hand, and there seem also to be other difficulties\nin the way, as very few communicators are able to use the voice at all.\nThe writing itself moreover appears to be not the result of any\nconscious effort of writing on the part of the communicator, but the\nresult of the communicator's thinking what he has to say at the slow\nrate of writing. (See p. 332). The next important point to notice is\nthat G. P. apparently starts out in a natural conversation with his old\nfriend, but is immediately pulled up short by questions which are\nentirely foreign to the thoughts and emotions surging through his\nmind. Still at the first opportunity where a question is not thrust\nupon him he begins to say something which is peculiarly appropriate\nto the sitter, connecting evolution in this life with evolution in another,\nbut is not allowed to finish. The sitter interrupts with his series of\n\f422 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nquestions, and remonstrance on the part of G. P. is entirely unavailing.\nG. P. was the author of a biography of his own grandfather, Robert\nNoyes, of whose conduct in certain international peace negotiations\nG. P. took a special view. Mr. Marte's question at this point evidently\nreferred to this. Further, G. P. is deprived of the opportunity of\nfinishing his sentences, in reply to the sitter's inquiry. G. P.'s reply to\nthe question, \" Have you seen Franklin 1 \" was evidently, \"Whom do\nyou mean, Ben 1 \" It must be remembered that as soon as words are\nwritten they are uttered aloud, usually by me when I am present at a\nsitting. This was originally in accordance with the request made by\nG. P., so that he might know that he was understood. Thus as soon\nas \" whom \" was written it was pronounced aloud, and so on. In this\ncase the sitter interrupted after the word \"mean\" was written, just\nas G. P.'s question higher up, \" Why did you not come here before ? \"\nwas interrupted in the middle of the writing by two questions which\nignored what G. P. was trying to express. G. P.'s reply about\nFranklin was exactly to the point, but, of course, Benjamin Franklin's\nexperiments in electricity are probably a matter of almost universal\nknowledge. I have said that the statement about evolution's con\ntinuing in the other life was peculiarly appropriate to the sitter ; but\nit must be added that during a portion of the previous sitting and the\nearly portion of this sitting G. P. had been talking on this very point.\nMr. Marte is widely known for his contributions to the doctrine of\nevolution, was an intimate friend of G. P., and had talked much with\nhim, when living, on philosophical subjects. But Mr. Marte is so well\nknown, both as a writer and lecturer, that any mere knowledge of his\nname and work cannot be regarded as having any evidential value.\n(See the sitting of December 9th, 1892, p. 428.)\nFifth. December oth, 1892.\nPresent : Mrs. Howard, R. H, Reporter, and (part of the time)\nKatharine.\nPhinuit says that George has gone to find Jim and will \"come back and\ntell Hodgson what Jim is doing.\"\nR. H. makes an inquiry and presents articles on a matter having no\nrelation to G. P. A locket (also presented at the previous sitting) was given\nto Phinuit for further statements.\n[The reporter reads over to Phinuit what was said in connexion with the\nlocket, and Phinuit makes a few corrections. While doing this he stops the\nreading at the word Susio and uses the right (left ?) hand in making letters\nof the deaf and dumb alphabet quite rapidly, then tells her to go on. (The\nreporter recognised some of the signs used, but not enough for any intelligible\ninterpretation.\u2014R. H.) While the reporter is talking with Phinuit, George\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 423\nuses the right hand of the medium and carries on a conversation in writing\nwith Hodgson and Mrs. Howard.

H.]. . . .\n[Here came the reference to Mattie Johnson ; see p. 312.]\n******\nAt 10.12 [G. P's.] place at the writing was taken by Madame Elisa\n(see p. 335), who wished to tell her sister that she was living.\nMrs. Howard took a paper from her pocket and placed it in the\nhand,i saying that she had received it from Frederica (the name of the\nsister). The hand was passed wholly over the paper and then a\nChristian name was written, and almost immediately afterwards a sur\nname, both correct. The name was that of Frederica's husband, and\nthe paper was some verses written by him and given to Mrs. Howard\nsome months previously. Other personal and characteristic messages\nwere written, including appropriate references to the sitters, the full\nname of the communicator and several (not uncommon) Italian words,\nviz. : stabene, pazienza, adagio, taceo, addio a rivederci. The writing\nended \" addio. I remember the flowers you sent me.\" Mrs.\nHoward's impression was, that she did send some flowers [apparently\nduring Madame Elisa's illness] but could not be absolutely sure.\nG. P. then took control of the voice and talked for a short time. I\nquote a portion of the rest.\nG. P. : . . . There are two things : first of all is the argument, and\nsecond is the test.\nR. H. : Yes, first-rate.\nG. P. : It is hard work, Hodgson, but I have got courage to brave it out.\nR. H. : You are doing first-rate.\nG. P. : That is what I am here for. And I will make Orenberg realise that\nI exist or else I will go back in the body and do it over again. Dear old\n\f424- [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nOrenberg.

It is like crawling through a log, a hollow log.\nMrs. Howard : George, you said you had been following Jim. Do you\nknow where he is now, or where he went ?\nG. P. : He has gone to see his friend Fenton [correct] saw him not three\nquarters of an hour ago, as near as I can go by the time.\nR. H. : Well, it was more than three quarters of an hour.\nG. P. : That I can't specify.\nMrs. Howard : George, do you know what Fenton and Jim were talking\nabout ?\nG. P. : About this very subject and about me [correct]. They have been\ndiscussing it, but Fenton is as hard-headed as Orenberg, for you could not\nturn him any more than you could Orenberg, but they will have to turn and\nbe glad to come back and acknowledge it as I have. . . .\nSixth. December 7th, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard, R. H., the Reporter, and (part of\nthe time), Katharine.\nR. H. presented some fresh articles in connexion with the case about\nwhich he inquired on December 2nd and December 5th, and Phinuit made\nvarious statements about them after sending Mr. and Mrs. Howard out of\nthe room.\nLater on G. P. writes and gives satisfactory reasons for his treatment of\nmy inquiry concerning the questions of Y. Z. at the previous sitting, Mr.\nand Mrs. Howard having returned. This inquiry, owing apparently to\nantagonistic personal remembrances which G. P. living entertained towards\nY. Z. on account of private matters unknown to me at the time of the\ninquiry, seems to have produced a certain temporary irritation on the part\nof G. P. communicating towards myself (see below). Then came the\nfollowing (written) :\nG.P. : \"Don't you want me to give, please give me mother's letter.\"\n[Mrs. Howard had received a letter from Mrs. Pelham which was then given\nto the hand.]i \" Oh I see father is not well.\"\nMrs. Howard : She says that in the letter.\nG. P. : \"I am sorry, but it cannot be helped. Where is it that she says in\nthat letter she is going ?\"\nMrs. Howard : First to New York and then perhaps to come here,\nGeorge, to see you.\nG. P. : \"Oh, I am sorry I asked you now [crumpling letter in hand]\ngoing to dispose of it all right, then it will be far better \"\nMrs. Howard : Let us see that word again, George.\nG.

H. : Take your time, George, capital letters, George, capital letters.\nG. P. : \"I do wish Hodgson would be more patient.\"\nB. H. : I think I am patient, George. I am telling you to be patient.\"\nG. P. : \"He exasperates me \"\nR. H. : All right, George. I will keep entirely silent if you like.\nG. P. : \"in the extreme. Fire away, Mary, Go \"\nMrs. Howard : Now George, I want you, if you remember the name of\nthat place in New York, that country place that is going to be disposed of.\nI want to know the name of it. Yes, here is the letter, and if you can give\nme the name write it down.\nG. P. : \" Well, why do you confuse me so, why don't you let me go on\nand tell you what she says 1 \"\nMrs. Howard : Yes.\nG. P. : \"Without interrupting me so often [crumpling letter again] why\ndon't you answer ? \"\nMrs. Howard : George, you know there is a question she wants me to ask\nyou in that letter.\nG. P. : \"Potomac.\"\nMrs. Howard : Yes, it is on the Potomac. That is all right. [Some\nconfusion here. The town Z. which had been mentioned by G. P. in a\nprevious sitting (see p. 302) and which was the place referred to, was on the\nHudson, and this was well-known to Mrs. Howard.

Just read what\nshe says there, something about what she has been doing.\nG. P. : \"I prefer you [Hodgson] to ask for evidential purposes, for she\nknows.\"\nMrs. Howard : Yes, I do.\nR. H. : Well, but she knows what questions to ask, George, and I don't.\nIt is all right if she asks, never mind if she does know.\nG. P.: \"those . . . oh, all right.\"\n\f426 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nR. H. : Now, Mrs. Howard will ask.\nMrs. Howard : I want to know, George, what you have seen your mother\ndoing.\nG. P. : \"I simply see the letter and tell you for test.\"\nR. H. : Well, George, I am going to look at this letter again and ask a\ntest that nobody knows here at all. She says that you perhaps saw her.\nG. P. : \"please look, but I tell you all I can anyway whether you ask\nor not. \"\nR. H. : Yes, well, that is a question, George ; if you will wait just a\nminute, I want to ask because your mother asks it.\nG. P. : \" She has asked me what she has been doing.\"\nMrs. Howard : Yes, that is true.\nG. P. : \" Well, she has been shaking up my things a little, I mean my\nclothes, it is a simple thing but will go for a test. \" [I believe that this was\nascertained by Mrs. Howard to be correct, but she has not filled up the\nspaces for her notes to this sitting. \u2014R. H., 189G.]\nR. H. : First-rate, George, we will find out from her about this.\n******\n[He is told that Marte is coming the next time, and requested to find out\nthe name of Marte's father in the spirit. Some remarks with reference to\nMarte and the difference between him and Y. Z.]\nG.

P. : \"Oh, no\" . . . \"stumbling blocks there are, Hodgson.\"\nR. H. : Well, perhaps I shall know them some day, George, when I\ncome to try it myself.\nG. P. : \" Yes, then you will be glad to congratulate me for what I have\ndone.\"\n******\nPhinuit makes some more statements about the articles given to him at\nthe beginning of the sitting, during which the hand is seized and makes the\n\fxxxin.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 427\nletters of the deaf and dumb alphabet. Phinuit on being asked who is\nusing the hand, says that he does not know \"who she is.\" (See pp. 439-40.)\nAfter Phinuit leaves, Madame Elisa talks in a whisper for a short time to\nMrs. Howard\u2014personal messages, no fresh evidential matter. The trance\nends, and while Mrs. Piper is recovering she says, half dazed, \"I dreamed\nI saw a lady with a lot of flowers in her hand. Where am I ? Do you\nknow Walter Leaf ? . . . I tell you what I do remember, of seeing\na lady with something in her hand, I don't know what it was. . . She\nhad dark curly hair, not very much curly, crinkled a little up here (fore\nhead) brushed back like that. She had a very pronounced looking face,\nvery fine looking face, quite large eyes, quite a large mouth.\" (What sort\nof flowers ?)\n\"I can't tell you, it is going from me now.\"\nTo the ordinary reader, most of what I have quoted above may\nseem not merely tedious but worthless from any point of view. This\nobviously is not my own opinion. It would be indeed impossible,\neven by filling some thousands of pages with full reports and detailed\ncomments, to convey to the reader the impressions produced by\nattending hundreds of sittings with Mrs. Piper. I should, however,\nentirely fail in producing any approximation to a correct impression\nwere I to limit myself to a bald enumeration of the facts indicating\nsupernormal knowledge on the part of Mrs. Piper's trance personalities.\nIt is my desire, if possible, to enable the reader to appreciate, if only\nto a small extent, the mise cn scene of the sittings, the subtleties of\nthe different personalities that purport to communicate, particularly of\nGeorge Pelham, and the difficulties involved in such communications\nunder the circumstances described. It is important that the reader\nshould remember that in the above dialogue, as in most of the other\ncommunications from G. P., what he has to say, either spontaneously\nor in reply to questions, is written, that in these earlier communica\ntions at least, while I was yet ignorant, so to speak, of what the\ndifficulties appear now to me to be, he was continually being\nvexatiously interrupted, and that frequently the writing was illegible,\nand it was necessary that the words should be re-written. The.\nscrawls and the re-writings are not as a rule here reproduced, but\nthere is enough indication in what I have quoted to show the kind\nof difficulty that this re-writing must occasion in the mind of the\ncommunicating intelligence, whatever that may be. Further, it is\nonly by more or less prolonged conversations that glimpses into per\nsonality may be obtained in inquiries of this sort, and the evidence in\nrelation to G. P.'s identity rests not a little upon the characteristics\nof his mental make-up, including not only his intellectual, but his\nemotional qualities, his affections, his weaknesses, his sympathies and\nantipathies, and his loyalties. In the badgering (this is really the\nnearest term to suggest the actual fact) to which I had subjected him\n2 F\n\f428 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nby the persistence of the inquiry which I made in connection with\nY. Z.'s question, I had touched unwittingly the very core of that\nloyalty to his friends which was highly characteristic of the living\nG. P., and which apparently led by my association with Y. Z. to the\nmanifestation against myself of a certain amount of annoyance\u2014\nfollowed, be it noted, by a desire to remove the dissatisfaction\nproduced in me by his remarks.\nSeventh. December 9th, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. Howard, Mr. Marte, R. H. and Reporter at beginning\nof sitting, and a little later Mrs. Howard.\nPhinuit said at the previous sitting that he would not be present the\nnext time at all, but he appeared at the beginning, and said that he had come\nbecause he had got some further information about the subject of the\narticles presented at several previous sittings. He complained that \"the\nlight\" was \"not so strong,\" \"not so good as it is sometimes.\"\nR. H. asked if it was because the medium was not very well. Phinuit\nsaid she was ill; \"there is something wrong down here,\" and shortly\nafterwards, just before the writing began, said again : \" You know there is\nsomething wrong with the medium.\" Also near the beginning of the\nwriting G. P. remarked \"this light is weak,\" and later on \"don't hurry\nme, for this medium is not clear physical organism.\"\nPartly (as I now think) owing to Mrs. Piper's ill health, and\npartly to our inexperience, the sitting was not successful, though the\npersonal relations between G. P. and Mr. Marte were marked as on\nthe previous occasion of Mr. Marte's presence. (See p. 419.)\nMr. Marte put some questions on philosophical subjects, and there was\nsome confusion of the kind which I have illustrated in the account of the\nsitting of December 2nd, 1892, p. 421. Mr. Marte also asked about the\nbook One or Many, and G. P. showed no knowledge of such a book. It\nappeared that G. P. living, in conversations with Mr. Marte, had proposed\ngiving the name \"One or Many\" to a philosophical MS., which he, G. P.,\nhad written. Mrs. Howard noted that G. P. living never so called his MS.\nin conversations with her, though she saw him constantly at the time it was\nwritten, but always referred to it as his philosophical book. He also several\ntimes mentioned it to myself without giving any name to it. I supposed that\nthe general subject was the \" Mind-Stuff Theory.\" The MS., as I learnt\nlong afterwards from the present custodian of it, does not bear any title like\n\"One or Many.\" The communications were chiefly in writing, but partly\nin speech from G. P.\nMost of the conversation that followed after G. P. took control of the\nvoice was of a non-evidential character. In reply to enquiries he said that\nho had seen us three (Mr. M., Mr. Howard, and R. H.) in a club that day,\neating, the Tavern, that he had been there with R. H, and once with John\nHart.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 429\n[All correct, except that whether he had been at the present quarters of\nthe Club once or more than once with John Hart is uncertain. He had\nbeen to the old quarters of the Club several times with John Hart.] Also :\nG. P. : I saw you in Marte's library a few days since.\nMr. Howard : All three of us ?\nG. P. : No, simply you, Jim. [I was there, but not alone, all the time\nwith Marte, December 1.\u2014J.l\nHe had heen asked at the previous sitting to find out the name of the\nfather of Mr. Marte. He said here that he had not got it, could not find\neverybody in a minute, etc.\nMr. Marte formed an opinion entirely unfavourable to Mrs. Piper.\nThe remaining sittings of this series are nearly all much shorter,\nand contain much less characteristic matter. This fact I attribute to\nMrs. Piper's increasing ill-health, leading to an operation in March,\n1893.\nEighth. December 1Uh, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. Howard, R. H., and Reporter, and, later, Mrs.\nHoward, Katharine, and Evelyn.\nPhinuit talked for a short time about various persons and makes a\nprophecy not yet fulfilled. G. P. began to write : \"How are you, Jim and\nHodgson. Where is Mary, and what is that little piece of paper she has in\nher hand ?\" I then inquired if ho could tell us what Mrs. Howard said to\nhim alone, if he happened to be there, soon after the last sitting. \" She\nasked me to help her and try and make things right, and asked me to help\nher convince you and others that this is I. Now I think that is all I heard\nher say.\" Mrs. Howard comes in shortly after, and reads this, and says : \"I\nknew you knew some of the things I said to you. Did you see me writing\nto you ?\" [Mrs. Howard did not fill in her notes to this sitting. My im\npression is, that she had thought something more specific than this which\n,was not mentioned by G. P. She writes at the end of 1897 : \"What 1\nsaid to G.P. alone was said for him alone and was therefore not put in any\nnote, but all his references to that and to my writing were I think correct.\nI think I had the piece of paper in my hand in my own room but not when\nI came into the library, where the sitting was held, but I cannot be sure of\nthis as my memory may play me false.\"] Previous to Mrs. Howard's\nentering, G. P. had expressed a wish to speak to me one moment, and now\nproceeded with this. He wished to explain again about the difficulty of\ncommunicating, and the necessity of his not being interrupted when he was\nanswering a question. \"This is the most difficult task, I must say, that I\never had to perform, so please be as kind and patient as possible . . .\nfirst you asked me to pump Phinuit.\"\nPhinuit : You better shut up about me. . . .\nMrs. Howard gives Phinuit some articles, and is talking with Phinuit\nwhile the hand is writing: \"His proper name is John Pt. [?] Scliville,\noidy P no Phinuit at all.\" [Phinuit seems to be having a struggle with\nthe hand. George in the meantime is trying to go on with the writing.]\n2 F 2\n\f430 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nTwo or throe illegible words written and the paper is torn. Then \"this\nis a tabula rasa,\" emphatically underlined.\nMrs. Howard : Who has got the hand, doctor ?\nG. P. : \"George, I am going into the head. ... I want Hodgson\nto speak his mind fully to me personally now.\" . .\nR. H. : Well, I have not got anything specially on my mind now,\nGeorge.\nG. P. : \"Have I said anything to trouble you ? be frank, please.\"\nR. H. : No, you have not said anything to trouble me, except this, except\nthe things that make it difficult to reconcile with your identity. You said\nthings that easily contradict, George, and those things conflict evidentially\nwith the proof that it is you. Of course, those things trouble me a good deal,\nbut I have not anything special.\nG. P. : \"I think you will find my statements contradictory only when\nyou confuse by all talking at once, or when I do not fully understand your\nquestions.\"\nR. H. : Well, George, I am going to go over all the things that appear to\nbe contradictory, and ask you about them, but I was not going to do that to\nnight.\nG. P. : \"That is what I want. It has worried me far more than it has\nyou, my dear fellow.\"\nR. H. : Well, I suppose it must have, George. I can understand that.\nG. P. : \"Now just let me illustrate. When I began to speak about\nmy existence here and was ready to quote it philosophically, you interrupted\nme continually. \"\nR. H. : Well, we are very sorry, George ; we would like you to go\nstraight on without our saying a word for an hour, if you could.\nG. P. : \" Don't you know you did it 1 Please be frank.\"\nR. H. : No, I am not aware that we did, George, except you seemed as\nthough you needed us to speak to you occasionally.\nG. P. : \"Have you not got the things written ? \"\nR. H. : Yes.\nMrs. Howard : Yes, I think he was interrupted a good deal by Marte at\nthe last sitting.\nG. P. : \"Well, please read them carefully . . . and see if I am not\nright.\"\nR. H. : Well, we will take care, I think, George, not to do you an\ninj ustice.\nG. P. : \"Thank you.\"\nThe statements made here by G. P. I now believe to be fully justified,\nthough apparently I did not think so at the time.\nR. H. : Now, George, if you can give us a description of your life there,\nor of the views that you had on philosophy here, or anything of that sort\ncontinuously, we shall be glad to have you write or speak without saying a\nword.\nG. P. : \" Yes, but this has worried me so much I had to speak to you\nabout it.\"\nR. H. : Well, we are very glad, George, that you have spoken, and I\nknow that we have interrupted, but\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 431\nG. P. : \"Because it is most difficult to express one's thoughts through\nmaterial substance. Now when you consider this, I think you will allow for\nsome snags, won't you ? \"\nR. II. : Certainly. Now, would ycu like to answer Marte's questions or\nto talk on your own account ?\nG. P. : \"Thought exists without material substance, and is in no wise\ndependent upon it. [We probably could not decipher it immediately, and\nso he wrote] body. I assure you this. For thought continues to exist even\nafter the annihilation of or non-existence of body. Is that not like me ? \"\nR. II. : Well, go on, George, we are taking it all down.\nMrs. Howard : That is like you.\nG. P. : \" Well, the personal existence or the reality of the Ego is not a\ntruth of inference. Am I getting you mixed up? \"\nR. H. : No, not at all, George.\nG. P. : \"All right. I want to be sure that I am clear myself.\" \"The\n[Ego ?] exists after the disposition of the body, and in an immediate\nintuition . . . [This last sentence was apparently not deciphered at\nthe time, and the result was that G. P. 's attempt to distinguish between\n\" an immediate intuition \" and \" a truth of inference \" as applied to \" the\nreality of the Ego \" entirely escaped us, and the train of his thought was\nswitched off. I said we could not read it, and asked him to write it again,\netc. Then followed] \"The Ego exists after the disposition of the body,\nand consolidated with thought in which one and the same is thought. Am I\nconfused?\" We read this aloud, and \"consolidated with\" was rejected\nfor \"combined in,\" and finally \"it is all one. That is what I want to\nexplain.\" . . .\nG. P. : \" All right. Well, now then, after the Ego (which goes to make\nup the material organism) leaves the material organism, it goes on existing\njust the same as in the material, only is much more free, and can express\nitself in a much clearer sense than when in the material. Man's mind or\nsoul is a tabula rasa here for a register of thought. Read it now\nplease . . . you know that already . . . but let me tell you what\nI know.\"\nAt this stage Katharine and Evelyn were introduced and greeted, and\nG. P. was asked if he could talk to them.\nG. P. : \" Not now, dear Jim. Well, I want to finish this article. Then\nas thought goes on in the spiritual, I express myself, my thought to you.\n[Questions and repetitions, owing to difficulty in deciphering] . . .\nAll right. Here I am as the Ego of George Pelham . . . well, now,\nyou see as thought is not cause, but cause is thought. Do you understand ? \"\nR. H. : Certainly, exactly. [?]\nG. P. : \" Well, then, so thought goes.\"\n[Pause. Feeling of cap on head and working his arm.] . . . \"I\n,want my shawl.\" [Shawl placed on head.] Here G. P. begins to use the\nvoice, speaks again about the difficulty of recalling everything in a moment,\nand the confusion produced by interruptions, etc., and says inter alia : \"I\nam getting farther away from you each time. I am going on ; it is too bad\nin one sense, but it is all right for me.\" He wanted to know what Marte's\nquestions were, could not remember to whom the book on The One or the\n\f432 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nMany was dedicated. When asked if he remembered anything about any book\ncalled One or the Many, he said : (Mrs. Howard having previously remarked\nthat it was not a printed book) \"No. I did not know there was such a\nbook printed.\"\nR. H. : You never heard of any book by that name printed or unprinted ?\n[See previous sitting.]\nG. P. : \" Yes I have. Wait a minute. Say that again, Hodgson.\"\nR. H. : You don't know of any book by the name of One or the Many\nprinted or unprinted ?\nG. P. : \" Yes I do ; that is mine\u2014[pause]\u2014let me think ; let me write it\nfor you, will you t \"\nShortly afterwards there was some writing, very confused, and not\nall decipherable, in which the names of Orenberg and Rogers were\nmentioned.\nR. H. : Do you mean that you think it was Rogers who wrote The One\nor the Many ?\nG. P. : \" I think so, but do not remember.\" Then followed a little\nmore writing, expressing a consciousness of being mixed about the book,\nPhinuit in the meantime taking control of the voice and talking. The last\nwriting was \"remind me of it when I come again, and all I ever knew I\nwill tell you.\" Phinuit talks for some time, chiefly with Katharine and\nEvelyn. [The references to Orenberg and Rogers suggest an automatic or\ndreamy association of ideas. He had been told at a previous sitting that his\nMS., about which he inquired, was in the care of Orenberg, and he knew\nthat a volume of his poems had been in the hands of Rogers for\nposthumous publication.]\nI have given these lengthy and detailed extracts from the sittings\npartly to lead my readers along the path by which I myself have\ntraveired, that they may be to a certain extent equipped for some\nof the points to be considered in asking whether there is any\nevidence here of an extraneous intelligence or not, but partly also\nbecause of the impossibility of summarising, in any brief statement,\nthe evidential value of a conversation where one of the interlocutors\nmay be restricted to frequently indecipherable \" automatic writing \"\nas a channel of communication. Whether spoken or written, I regard\nthe dramatic form of the utterances as an integral part of the\nphenomenon, which must in no wise be neglected, even though we\nmay think that it can be fully explained as an outcome of still embodied\nminds \u2014for example, on the analogy of morbid or ordinary dream\nprocesses. Much of this dramatic form is incommunicable, and herein\nlies one of the difficulties of affording a fair estimate of those manifesta\ntions of personality which depend upon intimate habits of thought and\nemotion, and cannot be expressed by the verbal reproduction of\ndefinite remembrances.\nThe above instances may, however, suffice to illustrate some of the\ncauses of obscurity and confusion in this automatic writing.\n\fxxxni.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 433\nNinth. December 19lh, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard, R. H., and Reporter.\nSitting begins by G. P. 's using the voice. . . . Mr. Howard and\nR. H. leave the room on request of G. P., who holds a short conversation\nwith Mrs. Howard, after which they return. G. P. says he wants to under\nstand Marte's question. After some references to this by Mr. and Mrs.\nHoward, G. P. expresses a strong desire to see Helen Vance, saying that he\nhad seen her father [who had a sitting March 30th, 1892J. He is told that\nshe is coming the next time.\nMrs. Howard gives a letter, [this must be supposed to have come within\nthe field of vision of Mrs. Piper though, as I have explained, I believe that\nthe trance-personalities do not acquire any information by the ordinary\nprocess of vision (see p. 317).\u2014R. H ] saying, \" 1 want you to see your\nfather's letter, because there is something in it that will please you. \"\nG. P. : This does not sound as father would talk when I was in the body.\n. . . He believes that I exist [calls for Hodgson, complains of being\nmuddled, and asks Hodgson to put his hand \" up there\" (i.e., probably\nagainst the forehead) ] He was pained, but he is no longer pained, because\nhe feels that I exist.\nMrs. Howard : That is right ; I have read it.\nG. P. : That brings me nearer to my father ; now give him my tenderest\nlove and tell him that I am very near him, and see him almost every day, if\nI could go by days, but I can't judge of that, because I have no idea of time ;\nthat is one thing I have lost, Hodgson. . . . But, still, I am very near\nto him, and wish to express my kindest feelings, Jim, Hodgson, both of you,\nand I see him and hear him when he is talking of me, hear him discussing\nwith mother certain things about my life, some things that perhaps pained\nhim, and some things that perhaps pleased him. I often hear him discussing\nmy good qualities and my weak points, but it is a pleasure to me to know I\ncan be so near him.\nR. H. : He will be very glad, and we will be sure to send the message.\n[The letter handed to George was one entirely on business matters, not\nthe one we supposed, in which his father did speak of George's re-appearance\nat these sittings, and his own interest in hearing of it. \u2014J.]\nG. P. : You of all others are the one that I want to be absolutely certain\nof my identity. . . . Hodgson, I mean, and Jim, I want you both to\nfeel I am no secondary personality of the medium's [struggling to get the\nlast phrase out.]\nShortly afterwards he says he is \"getting weak,\" and soon Phinuit\n\"takes control of the head\" and greets the sitters, but is interrupted by\nthe seizing of the hand by G. P., who writes. I quote the first part of the\nwriting, omitting the remarks connected with our interruptions.\n\" Now, about my theory of spirit life independent of the material\nsubstance. I live, think, see, hear, know, and feel just as clearly as when I\nwas in the material life, but it is not so easy to explain it to you as you\nwould naturally suppose, especially when the thoughts have to be expressed\nthrough substance materially. However, this only gives me pleasure to\nexpress to you all that I can possibly even in this peculiar way. 1 am not\n\f434 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\ndistressed, though, because I cannot do as I would like. I am very thankful\nand willing to do all I can (for you in this way) even though it is not all\nclear. . . Nevertheless, I am bound to do just all I can for you to prove\nto you that I (George Pelham) do absolutely exist, independently of the\nmaterial body which I once inhabited. . . . Now, then, what I want to\nsay is that I am light and free, and much clearer in thought than I was in\nmy material body. . . . You see as I was explaining to you about\nthought, and had not strength materially nor time to finish, I will go on\nto that again and in a little more detail, which will explain to you (as well as\nanything) how and what [ am now, i.e., as a spiritual Ego. Thought is, as I said\nbefore, in no wise dependent upon body, but must necessarily, a$ yon see, depend\nupon the body of another person or Ego in the material to express one's\nthought fully after the annihilation of one's own material body. ... In\nconsequence of this you see that there must necessarily be more or less\nconfliction between one's spiritual Ego or mind, and the material mind or\nEgo of the one which you are obliged to use to explain these difficult\nproblems to you, my friends, in the material. . . . Well, then, thought\nis an immediate intuition or primary datum of consciousness ... in\nmy present life everything is expressed by thought. Now I am getting a\nlittle hazy.\"\nQuestions asked for. R. H. asks what becomes of the medium during\ntrance. \" She passes out as your etherial goes out when you sleep.\" R. H. :\nWell, do you see that there is a conflict, because the brain substance is, so\nto speak, saturated with her tendencies of thought !\nG. P. : \" No, not that, but the solid substance called brain, it is difficult\nto control it, simply because it is material . . . her mind leaves\nthe brain empty, as it were, and I myself or other spiritual mind or\nthought takes the empty brain, and there is where and when the conflict\narises.\"\nA little further conversation with G. P. writing, followed by a short\ngeneral talk with Phinuit.\nTenth. December 21s<, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard, Reporter, and most of the time\nMiss Helen Vance. Miss Vance was not present at the beginning of\nthe sitting, and Mrs. Piper did not see her at all while in the normal\nstate.\n[G. P. had been informed at the previous sitting that Helen Vance was\n\"coming next time,\" and after the previous sitting was over, and Mrs.\nPiper was perfectly normal, it was mentioned in her presence that Helen\nVance was coming to the next sitting, though Mrs. Piper appeared\nindeed not to have heard this remark. But it would be fair to assume\nin any case that Miss Vance might have been known to Mrs. Piper.\nHer father, the reader may be again reminded, had a sitting on March 30th,\n1892.\u2014R. H.]\n[Towards the close of the previous sitting, Mr. Howard remarked to\nPhinuit that he was going to see \"that old friend of mine\" (referring\nobviously to Fenton, whom Phinuit had described, alid G. P. mentioned by\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 435\nname at previous sittings, and who lives in a country town). Phinuit replied\n\"Good, I will go with you. You do something special, move some object\nor- something, and I will go and see if I can tell you what it is.\"] . . .\nPhinuit : Where is Jim ? I saw him at a place.\nMr. Howard : What did you see me do ?\nPhinuit : I saw a thing like that there ; what is that thing there ?\nMrs. Howard : A table.\nPhinuit : I saw you there, and saw you take a lot of things on that\u2014\nwhat do you call that\u2014books !\nMr. Howard : Books, yes.\nPhinuit : And what is the scarf thing you had over you there, you and\nthe old gentleman there 1 He is an elderly gentleman. You had a thing\nsomething like this that attracted my attention, a desk ; you know what I\nmean ; and then I saw you take and put one book on the other, books they\nwere.\nMr. Howard : Yes, there was a lot of books there.\nPhinuit : Well, what were you doing with them 1\nMr. Howard : I was looking over them to see what I could get to read.\nPhinuit : I saw you do that particularly ; I mean to say that one thing.\nMr. Howard : Well, I wanted to get some old books to bring down to the\nlibrary.\nPhinuit : Oh, I see ; I saw you lay them on this thing, you know, like\na desk. I saw you lay two or three there. You see what I mean ; you\nremember of doing it ?\nMr. Howard : I do perfectly. I brought the books down and gave them\nto the public library to-day.\nPhinuit : Oh, I see. And then I saw this gentleman sitting in a big, like\na chair, with arms to it ; you know what I mean, and you were sitting back\nin another one with arms to it, talking to him.\nMr. Howard : Yes, 1 was sitting in a chair with arms, and he was lying\ndown.\nPhinuit : He was reclining, but you were in a chair with arms to it.\n. . . And there were in the room where they were a great many books,\ndo you know, all round the place, and right over\u2014I am not very good at\nillustrating, but you know what they call the mantel there, a great big\nthing, looks like a picture in a frame, and there is one in that ; then on\nthe other side there is another one, and a great big curtain drawn, what we\ncall in French a portiere, in that same apartment.\nMr. Howard : Yes.\nPhinuit : Then there is a great big desk with feet to go under it.\nMr. Howard : Yes, he has that right by where he sits.\n*******\nPhinuit : Well, is there any question you want to ask me about that old\ngentleman 1\nMr. Howard : He is ill, isn't he ?\nPhinuit : He is quite ill, and he has trouble right here [chest], and right\nround here ; right round the heart there is a little bit ; it is difficult for him\nto breathe ; you see what I mean 1\nMrs. Howard : Yes, he said so yesterday.\n\f43G [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nMr. Howard : Yesterday he had a sort of an attack.\nPhinuit : Well, that is what I am getting at, his physical when you were\nwith him, and his breathing [medium breathing hard] ; then he has got a\nwhite medicine, looks something like a little powder, that he takes. I\ndon't know as you have seen that.\nMr. Howard : No, I have not.\nPhinuit : Well, he has taken that sometimes when he is not well. It\nseems like a valvular trouble.\n***\u2666,* *\nPhinuit : I saw you sitting at that desk too, Jim.\nMr. Howard : Yes. I sat there talking with him. I went up and\nwondered whether you would see me. Wo spoke about you.\nPhinuit : Do you know that scarf thing ?\u2014he has got something with\nhim\u2014what do you call that, afghan [struggling over the last word], like a\nscarf, round thing ; I saw him have that on. And do you know really that\nfellow knows in his mind that he is not going to get well ? Do you know\nthat?\nMr. Howard : Oh, yes.\nPhinuit : And he may not say to you -that I am not prepared to say,\nbut, however, in his mind he feels that he is not going to get well . . .\n[I placed about half a dozen different volumes on the writing table by\nthe side of the bed on which my friend lay. These he examined, at my\nrequest, to determine which he would give to the Boston Public Library,\nas early American imprints.\nI wore no \"scarf thing,\" merely my usual velveteen coat. He wore a\nsort of thick blue dressing gown.\nHe sat in no chair, but, as I said, lay in his bed, resting on pillows and\none elbow. I sat much of the time opposite him in an arm-chair. There\nare bookshelves pretty much all round the room. Over the mantel is a\nmoderate sized picture about 18 by 20 inches. Opposite, two curtains,\nnot large ones, overhang a window, keeping out the light from my\nfriend's eyes.\nHe has trouble with his heart. I know nothing of any white medicine.\nHe feels that he will not recover. He wrote to me December 22nd: \"I\nhave no special apprehensions, but it seems to me obvious that I lose strength\nand vitality from year to year (to put it mildly) and, anyhow, it can't last\nfor ever.\"\u2014J.]\nPhinuit says that G. P. is coming, and writing begins just after the\nentrance of Miss Vance. There is much misunderstanding of the writing,\nowing partly to the absence of R. H., who is more accustomed to deciphering\nrapidly. G. P. gives both names, Helen and Vance, asks after the society\n[a little society for literary purposes (i.e. practice in writing), to which\nGeorge and Miss Vance belonged as well as two others, young women. \u2014H. V.]\n[George had been questioned about this society before. See p. 302\u2014R. H.],\nafter her father and mother and brother [natural], and said that one died in\ninfancy, that he sees her. [The statement that a sister died in infancy was\ncorrect. \u2014H. V.] Miss Vance asked the name of this sister, and then just\nafterwards the name of \" Ken's friend who passed out, in college with\nKen.\" G. P. begins to explain about the need of asking questions slowly,\n\fxxxin.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 437\nand waiting for the answer. Phinuit also begins to explain to the sitters\nwhat to do. In the meantime Miss Vance apparently dropped the question\nabout her deceased sister's name, and repeated her request for the name of\nher brother Ken's friend, and the replies suggest that G. P. thought that\nshe wanted to speak with that friend. \"I will bring him for you.\" \" He\nwill tell you and send a message to Kenneth.\" [Name of Miss Vance's\nbrother.] Later on G. P. writes the name of Harry Guild. [The name of one\nof my brother's college friends who died more recently than the one whose\nname I wanted. \u2014H. V.] Later on he wrote: \"Charles is with me.\nYou asked . . . tell Ken ... to keep the book he gave him\nin college (what book, history V) Macaulay's. (Charles gave it to Ken\nin College ; is that it 1 ) Yes. at least he had it, so he says. Tell\nhim about Hale and . . . how is Berwick ? [See p. 301]. Tell him\nCharles says he is to keep work he instructed him about and help him write.\nI don't think you understand.\" [Charles was the first name of the class\nmate of Kenneth and George, about whom Miss Vance was inquiring. He\ndied in 1887. Harry Guild died in 1888. She notes that Ken has no\nrecollection of any book, and does not understand the allusion to Hale.]\nHe referred to having seen Miss V.'s father [sitting on March 30th, 1892],\nasked after \"the rest of the girls connected with our Society.\" Miss V.\nmade a statement about one of these other members, giving her name, and\nsoon afterwards asked if he remembered the names of the others in the club.\nG. P. asked after ' ' May . . .\" [My sister Mabel sometimes called May.\nIn this place George wrote May followed by last name we could not read.\nSome scribbles, one of which was dotted, may have been meant for Davis,\nthe correct name. Later on (after Miss Vance mentioned this name. \u2014R. H.)\nwhen George said he had already written it, he turned back to this page and\nwrote above the two names, \"It is there.\"\u2014H. V.] Miss Vance repeated\nlater her question about the other lady member of the club, and asked also\nto be told about \"a girl we both know who liked you and you liked her very\nmuch.\" As interpreted, \" Alice \" was written. [Incorrect. \u2014H. V.] Later\nG. P. asked after Nell. [No \" Nell \" I know of.\u2014H. V.] Some time after\nwards Miss Vance mentions the name, apparently, of this third lady member\n[Louie ] of the club in answer to G. P.'s question,\u2014\"Now, whom do\nyou have to correct your writings 1 \" [We all corrected each other's papers\nin turn.\u2014H. V.],\u2014\"But do they give satisfaction? (Yes). What, in\ntheir corrections ! [Miss Vance did not at first understand. Reporter\nexplains.] (Yes, but not as much as you ; your corrections were better than\ntheirs). Well, that is what I am trying to get out of you. (In other\nwords, George, you wanted a compliment from me). Oh, bosh, you know\nme better than that.\" After references to other matters (among them a\nquestion about a pencil which he said he had given Kenneth, who has,\nhowever, no recollection of any pencil) he wrote that he had asked half a\ndozen times about Louie but could not get any answer, and he finally insisted\non their turning back to the early sheets of the writing, where he claimed\nthat he had written it. At the time of original writing the word which he\nnow said was Louie was read as Sadie (as it certainly is), but this interpre\ntation was negatived at the time by G. P., and the subject was not pursued\nthen by the sitters. . . .\n\f438 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nEleventh. December 21nd, 1892.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard, R. H., and Reporter, and, part of\nthe time, Katharine and Evelyn.\nPhinuit talks with Evelyn, about her health, diet, etc.\nG. P., writing, refers to my absence last time: \"I followed you on a\nrailway train for some distance and then I thought you were in N.

January 24th, 1893.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard and Reporter, and, part of the\ntime, R. H, Katharine, and Evelyn. Mr. Hodgson comes in after the\nsitting is begun and leaves before it is finished.\nMrs. Howard places a book on Mrs. Piper's head, just after G. P. has\nbegun to write, and says : \" Do you remember that ? \"\nG. P. : \"Oh, yes. It is my French Lyrics.\" [Correct.] [There is no\nother contemporary memorandum as to how Mrs. Howard placed the book\non Mrs. Piper's heid. My own remembrance is that Mrs. Howard came\ninto the room holding the book behind her own back and placed it on Mrs.\nPiper's head from behind. Mrs. Howard writes at the end of 1897 that her\nrecollection agrees with this. She adds : \" I brought it in for a test, and put\nit so that it could only be perceived by supernormal means.\" The correct\nstatement may of course have been due to simple thought-transference.\n\u2014R. H.].\nVery little communication from G. P. He says he has not yet found\nMarte's father [see p. 429], that he had seen Marte himself, that he thought\nhe was out west, Chicago, or some place like it, lecturing. [Correct, but of\nno special importance, known to Mrs. Howard, and easily ascertained\nknowledge. \u2014R. H.]\nR. H. : Well, George, I want to ask you if you can't do something.\nG. P. : \" What you want me to do for you I will, and I know what it is\n. 3Tou want to do something, and have me tell you what you are\ndoing.\"\nIn reply to questions he wrote that he heard me say so to Jim ; \"heard\nit distinctly.\" I replied that he \" heard my thought,\" (I had not mentioned\nit) and asked if he could tell me more specifically what I was going to ask\nhim to do. \" Oh, no, not until you are doing it.\"\nR. H. : Well, George, I want to go away very shortly while you are still\nhere, and I want you to either go yourself or to get Phinuit to go, and if\npossible tell them here where I am going and what I am doing.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 439\nG. P. : \"Yes, I will try my best, but it will depend wholly on my seeing\nyour spiritual body, so please send out your spiritual body to me as much as\nyou possibly can while you are doing the trick.\" . . .\nShortly afterwards I left, and G. P. also stopped writing. Phinuit talked\nabout some articles that were given (two of them presented at previous\nsittings). Later he said there was a Mr. Osgood there who seemed to know\nthe Howards [correct]. Then came, through Phinuit, Louis [see p. 337],\nwho mentioned Billy Parker, spoke of himself as a painter, asked if it\nwasn't the room where he had been many a time, asked \" Where is Bessie ? \"\nMrs. Parker.] Mrs. Howard brought some brushes. \"These are the\nbrushes I gave to you.\" [Correct.] He said he had been to P h i 1 d e\n[Mrs. Howard then said Philadelphia] [Phinuit trying unsuccessfully to\npronounce it] and seen his friends there recently. He also asked after his\nfriend Theodore [the first name of an artist friend of Louis].\nPhinuit then described a little girl named Grace. \" She used to know\nyou years ago. She has reddish hair ; she passed out with diphtheria.\"\nMrs. Howard : I am sure I don't know. [See Proceeding*, S.P.R.,\nVol. VIII., pp. 40-1.]\nMrs. Howard asks several times for the return of G. P., and after an\nabsence of about three quarters of an hour the writing comes, \" I have only\nreturned for one minute, and really must go immediately back with Hodgson,\nor I shall lose it all now. He met my friend Vance, and now I must leave\nand watch them. Ait revoir. George P.\" [Incorrect.]\nAlmost at the end of the sitting there is a communication apparently\nhaving something to do with \"Laura Bridgman,\" the hand gesticulating\ndeaf and dumb characters, and afterwards writing words backwards (not\nmirror writing). [See pp. 422, 427, 440.]\nA sitting had been arranged for Mr. T. B. C. (see p. 472) on January\n\"28th, and I requested Mr. Howard to take the first part of this sitting\nand report to me what G. P. claimed to have seen me doing. The\nfollowing is from Mr. Howard's notes made the same day :\nHe [R. H.] went to Arthur Carey's house and talked with him there\n[there were several persons present, then or later, I think he said], and\nR. H. got on a table or some elevated thing, and turned a chair upside\ndown. These things he said he saw.\nAll this was wrong. Mr. Howard reported that he had a close\nand intimate conversation about friends, etc. Among the statements\nwas the following :\nHe said he had seen Mrs. Howard recently doing up some things to send\nto his mother. \"What things could you see?\" \"Books and pictures.\"\n[Correct.]\nThirteenth. January 30th, 1893.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Howard, R. H , and a gentleman who was\nintroduced to the medium under the name of Smith, also a reporter.\nG. P. did not manifest until specially asked for by Mrs. Howard.\n\f440 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nPhinuit spoko a little of Mr. Smith's character, and said there was a\nyoung man, also apparently an older one, who wished to communicate with\nhim. The latter tried to write a few words, but they were almost entirely\nillegible, and Phinuit said he would go and try to get George to help him.\nThere were further vain attempts at writing while Phinuit was talking about\npersons and articles inquired about at previous sittings, and then came some\nlegible writing : \"I am glad to see you,\" and soon after, Phinuit still\ntalking, \"Tellher I am living still, Walt W.\". . . . [On April 25th,\n1892, Mrs. Warner had presented a cap which had belonged to Walt\nWhitman, to whom she was known personally. See p. 324.]\nThen came several different writers. A lady wrote a short message to a\nprevious sitter. A friend who had died two or three days before, as was\nknown to us, wrote his name and \"I am all right now, adieu.\" Alice\nJames (sister of Prof. William James) made a brief statement about her\nbrother \" Bob,\" as Robertson James was commonly called by members of\nhis family. All this was accompanied by much violent movement in the\nhand and arm.\nPh. : What is the matter ? I don't know what they are doing with me,\nany way.\nR. H. : Seems to be a regular stream of them now.\nPh. : I can't help it ; they say these things, and they will say them,\nHodgson. I can't help it.\nThen, \"lam with you, also, Laura Bridgman.\" . . . Mrs. Howard\nthen asks for George, and the writing stops and Phinuit complains because\nMrs. Howard has \" sent that lady out,\" and there is some discussion in con\nsequence, after which O. P. writes that he does not recognise this gentleman\nand does not think he is a friend of his, thinks he has met him, but doesn't\nquite recall him. Asked where he thinks he met him, he writes : \"I think\nwith my friend, Marte. Ask him if he remembers me, please tell him who I\nam. I am George Pelham.\" Sitter asks if he has been in New York ? G. P.\nasks if he did not meet him once in the club, or reading-room, of his friend,\nBerwick. Sitter had met a Mr. Berwick, but not for many years. G. P.\nreferred again to the club, also to Marte, asked that his photo should be\nshown to the sitter and said : \" I do not remember you by name, only\nby face.\" Sitter said that he had met Marte in New York when there\nwere many others present, whose names he did not know. \" I really\nwas there.\"\n[On the morning of this day the gentleman here spoken of as Smith, one\nof our members living in New York, happened to call at my office. A\ndesirable experiment occurred to me, and I inquired if he knew anything\nabout George Pelham ; he replied in the negative, and I requested him to\nattend the sitting with Mrs. Piper that evening at the house of Mr. Howard.\nHe accompanied me there and I introduced him as Mr. Smith, not giving\nany information whatever to the Howards. On a previous occasion I had in\nthe same way taken a friend who knew Mr. and Mrs. Pelham, but not George\nPelham, and was unknown to Mr. and Mrs. Howard. On that occasion\nthere was no sitting owing to Mrs. Piper's illness, and after it was decided that\nMrs. Piper was too ill to sit, I had introduced him by his real name to the\nHowards, who then learned that he was a personal friend of Mr. and Mrs.\n\fxxxni.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 441\nPelham. I wished to see whether at this sitting, G. P. communicating would\nclaim some personal knowledge of Mr. Smith, or would claim that Mr. Smith\nwas known to his father and mother, as I felt certain that the Howards\nwould infer, from the fact of my taking Mr. Smith to their house under the\n,circumstances, that he had some special relation to G.P. I might thus, I\nthought, obtain some clue as to how far the minds of the Howards might\naffect the communication from G. P. The result was quite different from\nany anticipations that I had formed.\nAfter seeing G. P.'s photo, the sitter wrote : \" The features in the photo\ndo not look unfamiliar, yet they do not serve to assure me of my having\npreviously met Mr. Pelham. While it is entirely possible, or probable even,\nthat I may have done so, I cannot recall any definite memory of such\noccurrence.\" But it is not improbable that on the occasion of Mr. Marte's\nvisit (March 1890) to New York to which the sitter referred, G. P. was\npresent at the meeting. Mr. Marte was unable to make any statement as to\nwhether G. P. was present or not. Also the sitter and G. P. were both\nmembers of the University Club in New York. This last fact must I think\nhave been known to me, though I did not consciously think of it at the\ntime. I may add that the Berwick referred to in the G. P. writing was a\nHarvard classmate of G. P., that the Berwick referred to by the sitter was\na Yale man ; and that both were members of the University Club. The\nsitter afterwards recollected further that he had once met Mr. Pelham,\nSenr., quite casually, also at the University Club.]\n\f442 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nAPPENDICES II. and III.\nUnless otherwise specified, or obvious from the record, the accounts\ngiven in Appendices II. and III. are of first sittings, which were held\nat Mrs. Piper's house in Arlington Heights, Mass., and the appoint\nments for which were made by me. I believe that in all these cases\nthe sitters were previously unknown to Mrs. Piper. Their names\nwere never mentioned by myself, and I introduced all sitters by a\npseudonym, usually Smith. Of other first sittings of which I know,\nheld during the period covered by these Appendices, from the end of\n1891 to the end of 1895, there are not more than six that can be\nclassed as complete failures.\u2014R.

(Associate\nA.B.S.P.R.). R. H. taking notes. Miss Hartshorn added a few\nminor points.\nMiss Hartshorn wrote on November 7th, 1891, after her return\nhome :\u2014\nThe result of my sitting with Mrs. Piper becomes more and more\ninteresting, both directly and indirectly. The round silver box had\nabsolutely no associations. It did not \" amount to a row of pins,\" although\nI supposed it did.\nThe handkerchief was left at T.'s house at a party, and we do not know\nto whom it belonged.

H.]\nPhinuit : You have lots of friends. Middle aged elderly lady friend of\nyours, not well, she has a very spiritual nature. People don't know how\nlovely she is. I am very sorry, she is not going to recover, she's going\nto pass out. . . . She's got a daughter, she's got two, one of them is\nnaturally younger than the other. One of them is with her mother more\nthan the other. One of them goes to and fro to see her mother. The\nyoungest one is going to be very sad.\n[Quito correct. Both daughters live at home, but one rooms with the\nmother. It is the youngest. Lady in very frail health. (Has just been\nvery ill, but is gaining. January 6th, 1892)].

Don't like her as well as I\ndo you.\nSitter : Is she living ?\nPhinuit : No, she's in the spirit.\nWait a minute. There's Tillie's mother. There's a cousin of yours.\nTillie's mother is your own cousin. (That's a fact). That makes Tillie your\nsecond cousin. [Relationship correct]. You know I get a boy's influence.\nHe makes me very nervous.\nSitter : What boy is that 1\nPhinuit : Oh, he's a trial. Tillery, Tillie, there's a child in her surround\nings. It comes very close to you.\n[No child in Tillie's surroundings.]\nIt's a boy, very nervous temperament, very positive.\nSitter : Are you sure it's a boy 1\nPhinuit : Well, he looks like a boy, he's got his hair short any way.\nHullo, here's Marie\u2014M-a-r-y. That's connected with her too. She's\nliving.\nLou, Louis, Louie, Louie. Well, I don't know whether it's a girl or\na boy. It's Louie any way.\n[No clue to any of this.]\nYou tell her there's some severe trouble with somebody's eyes in con\nnection with that. They told me that afterwards.\n[Sitter gives ring].\nPhinuit : Person connected with this that's passed out of the body.\n[Correct.]\nI get the name of Sarah.\nSitter : No.\n2 a.\n\f444 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nPhinuit : There's a lady by that name connected with you. Hadn't you\nan aunt of that name ?\nSitter : No\u2014yes I did, uncle's wife, I had forgotten. [I never saw this\naunt.]\nPhinuit : There are two influences with this. Another lady wore it and\nthen you wore it. [Correct.] And I get your mother's influence strongly.\n[Mother not connected with it in any way.]\nAlso I get a sister here.\nSitter : A sister ?\nPhinuit : Not your sister, your mother and her sister. [Mother had no\nown sister, only sisters-in-law\u2014all dead.]\nSitter : Is she in the body or not ?\nPhinuit : Yes. An aunt by marriage in the spirit and she is very cranky.\n[Easily applies to two aunts.]\nFormer owner [of ring] is in spirit, and it passed from her to you.\n[Correct.]\nWhat's the matter with your mother's foot 1 [Sitter afterwards recalled\ndropsical affection of foet, necessitating bandaging. ]\nSitter : I don't know, do you mean now ?\nPhinuit : Yes. (In the spirit world ?) Yes.

That's one\nof the names in connection with one of the persons who owned this.\nSitter : No, try again.\nPhinuit : I think it's a second name. [Wrong.]\nSitter : What did they use it for ?\nPhinuit : I see some square things, stamps like.\nSitter : Well, I just took some stamps out, but what was [it] used for\nbefore ?\nPhinuit : He used to carry little round things in that, things to eat you\nknow. Cowchoose [as pronounced].\n[Sitter could not for several hours remember what she had been told\nher uncle kept in the box, finally recollected it was camomile flowers to\nchew.]\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 445\nSitter : Cachous 1\nPhinuit : That's what I was trying to get at when I got Charles. How\nwould you like to have people say ch, ch, ch to you, and you thought they\nwere giving you a name ? That's what you blame me for, Hodgson.\nDo you know anyone named Jennie ?\n[Sitter knows several Jennies, intimate with none.]\nSitter : Yes.\nPhinuit : Well, Jennie doesn't have much to do with you.\n[Dr. Hodgson asks about Jennie.]\nPhinuit : Jennie be hanged . . . That [box] comes in connection\nwith this lady. It has her uncle's influence upon it. [Correct.]\n[Concerning first ring.] Belonged to a very dear friend of yours in the\nspirit. Not a relative. (That's right.) [Correct.]\n[Sitter gives bracelet.]\nPhinuit : Uncle John. I want to get it over that way. [Inside of\nbracelet on head.]\nI get your uncle's influence still. This takes me with it. This was got\nacross the country. This was given to a lady who had some trouble with\nher throat. This was made to order. It came through a lady's influence\nto you in the body. Lady in spirit to whom it belonged received it from\nher uncle. Name Willie comes in connection with it. Susie connected\nwith it. Lady who owns it now is in some trouble.\n[Sitter knew nothing of bracelet. It was lent to her byTillie. No John\nabout it.

In the spirit.\n[Correct.]\n[Sitter gives round silver box.]\nPhinuit : A gentleman gave this to a young lady who is now in the body.\nFor sweet things, little peppermint things like.

Looks to me liko a Christmas present. Came with a\ntoilet set. I get the name of Janette, Alice, Elsie. He no, I won't tell\nyou that.\n[Sitter knew nothing of handkerchief given to her by Tillie. When it\nwas returned to Tillie before any details of sitting have been mentioned,\nsitter said \"Phinuit liked this handkerchief.\" Tillie said \"I hesitated\nwhether to give you this handkerchief of which I know nothing, as it was\nleft at my house at a party, or to give you a ring belonging originally to\nElsie. I took them both out of the drawer, and finally decided on the\nhandkerchief.\"]\nDr. H. : Yes, tell us.\nPhinuit : No, it is too sad. Elsie had a child and lost it.\n[Elsie died at the birth of a child, who lived, though she had previously\nlost one ; her husband was nearly insane at the time from grief. Elsie had\nthe ring on when she died, and her husband gave it to Tillie. Sitter did not\nknow Elsie, and did not know Tillie had such a ring.]\nThere's a young fellow named Arthur in the surroundings who's very\nclever.

[Correct.]\nDo you know Kittie 1\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 447\nSitter : No, I think not. [After the sitting, sitter remembered a child\nfriend Kitty who died many years ago.]\nPhinuit : You may find Kittie in connection with this [handkerchief].\n[MSS. given.]\nPhinuit : That's nothing but a notebook.\nSitter : What influence is upon it 1\nPhinuit : I get very strongly the name of Thomas. There's something\nwritten there by him. He recognises it, and he's in spirit. That's your\nfather's influence. He says he is your father. [Correct.]\nThis lady had an Uncle William. He's in spirit, and he had something\nthe matter with his heart. There was pressure here, crowded on the heart,\ndon't you know ? [Cause of death forgotten.]\n[Phinuit handles the articles again. ]\n[First ring.] From a dear friend. [Correct.]\n[Square box.] Her uncle's. [Correct.]\n[Bound box.] Another lady gave her that. That don't amount to a row\nof pins. [Correct.]\nMarch 7th, 1892.\nSitter : Miss Gertrude E. Macleod, Cambridge, Mass.\nThe following report was received early in 1893, probably in\nFebruary, and I knew nothing about the sitting until shortly before I\nreceived the report. The sitter, Miss Macleod, died in August, 1894.\nShe was not a member of the Society at the time of the sitting. Her\nsister, the Mabel referred to in the sitting, has given us the following\nfurther information. The sitting was arranged \" for a friend of his\"\nby the Rev. M. J. Savage [who remembers making the appointment],\nand Miss Macleod went as an entire stranger to Mrs. Piper. The\nEtta referred to in the sitting was Miss Macleod's sister, who died 0n\nDecember 21st, 1891, at the age of twenty-four. Miss Macleod asked\nEtta what Mrs. Putnam, a friend, and Mabel were doing at the timet\nas a test, and first mentioned their names. The Albert was Albert\nBraid, not a relative, who died about the end of November, 1886, at\nthe age of six ; Susie was the name of his mother. Agnes and Annie\nwere friends,\u2014Annie Mary not known to Miss Mabel. Frank and\nGeorgie were deceased brothers. Georgie died in 1876, at the age of\nthirteen. Miss Macleod never crossed any large body of water, and\ndid not \" have many books behind her.\"\nCopy of notes made immediately after a sitting with Mrs. Piper on\nMonday, March 7th, 1892.\nAt 12.15 o'clock.\u2014Mrs. Putnam writing in her room. A lady was there\nat first who was not there when Etta came away. [I asked if Mrs. Putnam\nwrote with a pen or a pencil, and Phinuit said \"a pencil.\" Mrs. Putnam\nwrote a letter with a pen, and her landlady, whom Etta had never seen, was\nthere for a little while, but Mrs. Putnam thought she was not there just at\nthat time.]\n\f448 PART\nRichard Hodgson.\nAt 12.45.\u2014Mabel walking in a large building. She arranged her hair a\nlittle and brushed herself. [Mabel was at Fay House at that time, but did\nnot remember doing the other things.]\nSome picture to be turned round in our house ; Annie's picture or a\npicture of a girl with a pail. [He was very angry because I could not think\nof the right picture. No picture was turned around.]\nDavid will die soon. [David is still living, but is now very ill.]\nAnnie Mary has turned her ankle. [Not true.]\nAlbert wants his mother to go to Wilton, and will go with her. [I\nmentioned Albert first, but Phinuit talked about Wilton himself. Wilton\nis a place in New Hampshire, where Albert went once with his mother.]\nAgnes will be ill. [For the first time since early childhood Agnes was\nill for a week in the fall of 1892.]\nSnsie.\u2014[I did not understand about Susie, but Phinuit may have meant\nAlbert's mother.]\n[More notes on this sitting written on March 9th.] Phinuit said that I\ncould write for Etta. [This was after saying that I could be a medium.]\nAlbert could come to his mother if she would let him.\nI had many books behind me, and should cross the water soon, after\nwriting much more than ordinarily.\nCousin Mattie wanted to know where David was.\nSomething which I did not understand about Fred, Henry, and Edward,\nand Marion. [I do not know what Marion.]\nEtta said that the last thing she saw was mother's face until she became\nconscious in a room and saw her body lying uuder something white. [This\nis really the only thing which had already happened, and which I did not\nknow until after the sitting. I always thought that Etta's eyes were closed\nwhile mother held her in a sitting posture to aid her breathing, and that she\nfell back without opening them. But when I told mother what Phinuit said,\nshe said at once, \"Why, yes, did you not know that? Etta was looking\nright into my face when the light went out of her eyes.'1]\nPhinuit decided, after some hesitation, that Etta's hair was gold coloured,\nand very light. [True.]\nHe said Frank was a little fellow, and did not seem to know Gertie as\nwell as Georgie. [I had not mentioned Frank, nor indeed anyone but\nAlbert, and Frank died at six months old, before I was born.]\nGeorgie had lung trouble which made Phinuit cough, but Etta had\nstomach trouble, and that Etta did not like some broth which we gave her.\n[Georgie died of quick consumption. If Mrs. Piper had asked any person\nin Cambridge what caused Etta's death she would have learned that she had\na heart trouble. But what Phinuit said is just what Etta would have said if\nsomeone had asked her the day she died. She did not in the least know that\nher heart had anything to do with her distress, and called it her stomach.\nStill it seems more like something from the things she knew before leaving\nher body than like what she would have said if she had been around and\nheard us talking afterward. And about the broth which she did not like\u2014\nthere was a kind of medicine which she hated and finally refused to take.]\nAlbert is afraid his mother will never get over the loss of him. He\nwishes she would not grieve so much, but would go to Wilton.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 449\nGeorgie and Etta and Frankie are all altogether and happy, and not very\nfar away. \"What we want you to know is that we are alive.\" Phinuit\nsaid that Etta was so eager that it seemed as if she would tear him to pieces.\nThis is the end of my notes, but I remember a few more things which\nmay explain some of them better. When Phinuit spoke of Mattie he said :\n\"Your cousin Mattie is here, and wants to know where David is.\" David\nis her father. Phinuit explained that David and Mary and my father were\nbrothers and sister, which is true.\nHe spelled several of the names, and could not pronounce them until I\ntold him how.\nWhen he said Etta was there he said, ' ' There is a very pretty lady who\nwishes to speak to you. I am trying to get her name. She is telling me\nher name, Ada, Edda, how do you say that name 1\" I thought that was\nnear enough, and told him.\nHe spelled Gertie, and said \"Who is Gertie?\" and seemed sur\nprised at its being I. If Mrs. Piper had been doing it she would have\ncalled me Gertrude, as nobody calls me Gertie of late years. Only Etta\nused to call me Gertie occasionally for fun.\nIn speaking of my sisters and me he said, \" There are three of you, one,\ntwo, three ! \" This was rather odd, because we had a little joke about there\nbeing \"one, two, three\" of us, about which Etta was very much amused.\n[It is, however, not uncommon for Phinuit to count up in this way when\ntrying to give the number in a family.\u2014R. H.]\nIn telling the colour of Etta's hair he said at first that it was darker than\nmine. Then Mrs. Piper put her hand on my head, saying, \"Let me see\nwhat colour your hair is. Why it is dark. I thought it was light. My\nfriends say that I make mistakes about colours. Is there gold colour ? Her\nhair is that colour.\" Her hair was really very golden.\nGertrude E. Macleod.\nMiss Macleod added, on March 27th, 1893 :\n\" My uncle David, whose death Mrs. Piper predicted at the sitting which\nI had with her on the seventh of March, 1892, died at Chicago on last\nTuesday, the twenty-first of March. As far as I know, his health was\nperfectly good at the time of the sitting.\"\nMarch 10th, 1892.\nSitter : W. L. Parker (Associate A.B.S.P.R.). [R. H. taking notes.]\n[The words in large capitals were spell.]\n[Mixed and unimportant at first, until]\n(I want to speak to a friend who used this [giving cheque-book] )\nHodgson, that reminds me of Dr. L. [Books were placed in Phinuit's\nhands in experiments in connection with Dr. L.]\n1. Here comes a spirit who's got rheumatism. He passed out with\ntrouble round here [pointing exactly to region of liver, and pressing hard and\n\f450 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\npounding on that spot.] [My friend Louis R. [an artist] died February\n24th, 1892. Had suffered with rheumatism, and died from cancer of ilrer,\nwhich was discovered by an operation in January 1892. The spot touched\nand pressed hard was almost exactly where the incision was made.]\n2. He's a very nice gentleman, but he's older than you are. [Wrong.\nAge 38 at time of death ; mine 44, but he looked much older than he was.]\n[He was known to me, and I should say that he certainly looked older than\nMr. Parker.\u2014R.

[The day before the operation at the hospital, Louis drew his last\ncheque, and when alone occupied himself in figuring with pencil on the back\nof the next page the balance and the possible amounts due him from various\nsources, all of which 1 found when I received the book later on. This\nparticular spot had more of his personality than any other, and I had made\nup my mind beforehand that the spirit would stop at that page, but was not\nprepared to find the finger passed exactly over the balance in bank.]\n3. Where's his pocket book ? (Pocket-book ? Don't know. ) [At the same\ntime I received a pocket-book containing a letter to his wife, and sundry last\nwishes which he kept near his person until his death.

I am sure of the\nessential (and generally almost of the literal) correctness of my additions ;\nbut in one or two cases I am not quite certain of their place.\nIt is, of course, still true that much was said, especially while you were\nout of the room, which is unrepresented in the notes, but I think nothing of\nreal importance. At any rate, I am unable to amend the notes further with\nout danger of error.\nWould it not be well to mark the place at which you were recalled and\ncame back t Mrs. Piper said something like : \" Hodgson, come, tell the\ngentleman what to say. \"\nYou asked for my comment on the sitting. I find it difficult to convey\nthe impression left on my mind, \u2014 there was so strange a mixture of truth\nand error,\u2014some correct knowledge of a few facts, on the one hand, and a\ncomplete failure to indicate personality, or even to identify the spirits\nalleged to be present on the other. I am still in doubt about all but\nmy mother, as to who was meant.\nOf the names mentioned, the greater number are names of persons known\nto me and closely connected with me. But some of these were strangely\nconfused, and nearly all were left in the air, as it were, without any indica\ntion of the persons whom they designated. Two of them appeared to be\nwrongly applied at first, but were afterwards, in obedience, as it seemed to\nme, to indications conveyed automatically by me by intonation of voice or\notherwise, used differently. Some of the names wholly unknown to me.\nNames could not be given in several important cases. Nearly all the names\ngiven are very common ones. There seemed to me to be only one striking\ncase in the use of names. The name of Rogers, an unusual first name,\nwas spoken distinctly, and without any of the gradual process of formation\nwhich is commonly employed by this medium. This is a name of marked\nsignificance to me, and was rightly closely associated with my mother. It\nis, of course, also a name which might easily be ascertained by enquiry to\nhave interest for me ; while it would be less obviously a part of common\nknowledge concerning me than my father's name, for example, or other more\npublic matters.\nOf the matters of fact and other things which make up the substance of\nthe interview, less success is to be predicated. One or two points were\ncorrectly stated, or indicated. The greater number, including all those on\nwhich special stress was laid, are utterly without meaning for me. They\nare simply mistakes.\nIn regard to the indefinable, unreasoned impression made by the inter\nview,\u2014a point to which I am forced to attribute much importance in the\ncase of some of my friends who have visited Mrs. Piper,\u2014I must say that\nI received none that tends to strengthen the theory of a communication\nwith the departed. No personal trait, no familiar and private sign, no\nreminiscence of old affection, no characteristic phrase or mode of feeling or\nthought, no quality of manner was there, to make the presence of a beloved\nspirit seem real. I never for one instant felt myself to be speaking with\n2 h 2\n\f462 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nany one but Mrs. Piper, nor do I perceive any change of voice or personality,\nbeyond what is ordinarily witnessed in skilled impersonation, even where\nthere is no abnormal psychical condition, and constantly shown by persons\nin the hypnotic trance.\nYou will understand that I am not undertaking to discuss Mrs. Piper's\nmanifestations in general\u2014I am only trying to transmit to you, as trans\nparently as possible, the view which remains in my mind as the result of\nmy own experience. I think it ought to be remembered as an essential\nfact, bearing on that experience, that my first visit was entirely without\nresult, and that an interval of several days passed before my second visit.\nI regret not to have witnessed any of the wonders which are reported of\nthis case. Had I seen them, I should have gladly borne my testimony to\nthem. A real communication with the glorious dead would surely be\nthe greatest conceivable satisfaction to one who cannot be many years\nseparated from the state in which they abide.\n******\nI meant to have added that Phinuit seemed to me to be constantly\ngroping after indications from me to correct and direct his intelligence,\nand in some cases he seemed to me to be so directed. Whatever the\nexplanation of the phenomena, I believe this process to go on,\u2014a struggle\nfor knowledge to whose issue the sitter contributes. J Peirce\nP.S.\u2014Since writing the foregoing, I have gone over the notes in\ndetail, making a memorandum of successes and failures. I am surprised\nto see how little is true. Nearly every approach to truth is at once vitiated\nby erroneous additions or developments.\nMay Gth, 1892.\nSitters : Dr. and Mrs. L. E. H. New York.\nThe notes marked with an asterisk are from additional information\nsupplied by Dr. H. in 1897, and are as nearly as possible in Dr. H.'s\nwords. He adds : \" It would, I think, be of interest to preface the\nsitting with the remark that Mrs. Piper was entirely unknown to both\nof us, and we to her ; that Dr. and Mrs. Thaw were the only mutual\nacquaintances, and that they said nothing to Mrs. P. about us except\ning that we were to have a sitting. The large number of little details\nbrought out about the family are extremely interesting, the most\nmarked being those relating to Walter, his death and his friends, and\nto David,\u2014many of the remarks made by both of these are strictly\ncharacteristic. However, nothing appeared in the sitting which could\nbe afterwards confirmed, which was not fully known either to Mrs. H.\nor myself. All the things here brought out might be explained as\nsimply mind-reading, but a wonderful example of that.\"\n[At the house of Dr. A. B. Thaw, who arranged for the sitting, Mr. A.\nDow taking shorthand notes, Mrs. Thaw present at beginning.]\n\fxxxin.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 463\nPhinuit : Comment vous portez-vous, Monsieur ? Hodgson ! Where am\nI? Where am I? What's this thing ? [Feeling Dr. H.'s head.] What's\nthis ? What this ? Where is this place ? Where is this place 1 Where's\nHodgson ? (Dr. H. He's not here.)\nPhinuit : I want to know where I am. Oh, I see, I'm some other place.\nOh, I see, you want me to talk to this gentleman and this lady. Why the\nDickens didn't you tell me so in the first place ? [Feeling Mrs. H.'s head.]\nHow are you, sis ? You're a good girl. (Mrs. H. : I'm very well. Glad to\nsee you.) Phinuit : Oh, you're all right. (Dr. H. : You're well to-day,\nPhinuit ? ) Phinuit : I'm always all right. I'm never ill. [To Mrs. T.]\nWho's that lady ? [To Mrs. H.] Here's a gentleman wants to speak to you.\nCome here. I want my watch. [Dr. H. offers his watch.] [To Mrs. H.]\nYour father wants his watch. He's a doctor\u2014a doctor. [Phinuit then made\na motion as though unwinding something about the hand and then dropping\nit off the side. Repeated several times. Then put something to Dr. H.'s\nnose as if to smell.] Give me that thing. I want that thing quick. [Is\ngiving paper and pencil. Several words written\u2014among them \"Evelyn.\"\n\" I am glad to see you, and see you well.

Dr. R . was not asked\nconcerning the possible significance for him of the names William and\nChamberlain.*]\n[To Mrs. H.] : Give me your father's watch.\n(Mrs. H. : I haven't it.) [Before coming Mrs. H. had made an unsuc\ncessful attempt to bring the watch.]\nPhinuit : There's a trouble in his head. [Incorrect.] There's also a\ntrouble here, right in the stomach. [Correct.] That's true. Perhaps you\ndon't believe me, but you ask him and he'll tell you. I want that lady to\ncome here, and I want you to step out. I want that lady. I want to tell\nthat lady all about her friend. I wish you'd all go away.\n[To Mrs. H.] You'll remember what I say to you, and what I say to you\nyou can tell your friends. I want to tell you about your little girl, you\nknow what I mean, that's in the body, the little girl that's in the body, that's\nyours. She's a sweet little thing, but awfully positive. She's awfully\npositive, but you let her have her own way. I can talk to you, and then to\nthe gentleman. I want Lewis. [Unknown.] You know what I mean. I'll\ntell you about your Ellie\u2014Ethel, Ethie. [Evelyn, the name.] No, that's\nnot quite right. Wait a minute\u2014I'll get that for you in a minute. She's\ngot a pretty good temper of her own ; excuse me for telling you that.\nShe's got a lot of talent in her ; just give her her own way. Don't oppose\nher any. She's a little headstrong. You see what I mean, don't you ?\nGo away, Alex, [to Mr. A. Dow.] That's too bad, isn't it I I get also\n\f464 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nthe influence of your mother. [Characteristics of child quite striking.]\n(Mrs. H. : My mother?) \u2022\nPhinuit : You speak to me, don't go to sleep.\n(Mrs. H. : You tell me about my mother )\nPhinuit : She says that if you will follow my instructions she will come\nout all right. There is one, two, three ; you see what 1 mean. I want to\ntell you about the different ones. There are two children, and that's all.\n[Correct.] There are no more. How do you suppose I know that ? There's\none ; that's the little girl ; she's the one that is so positive that I told you\nabout. And that's the one who'll have her own way. She's a little sensitive.\nShe has a little trouble here. [Correct.] Right inhere [feeling throat], and\nit's the only trouble she's had about the whole physical body. She's pretty\nwell, pretty strong in the legs here. What's the matter with her foot the\nother day ? [Probably alluding to Mrs. T.] (Mrs. H. : I don't think there\nwas anything the matter with her foot.)\nPhinuit : That's there ; but all her little trouble is right here. [Feeling\nthroat.] You know I see her going a distance where there is water around\nher I don't think you understand me. Where's that other lady 1 She'll\n[tell ? ] you how to talk to me. She's got two children, and there's a little\ngirl that's got a little trouble with her throat, but she'll get well and strong,\nand stay in the body. She's going where I see water around her ; she's not\ngoing to fall in the water. [A journey to a town on Lake Ontario was taken\nvery soon after.] [This journey was intended at the time of the sitting, and\nEvelyn went there a few days after.*] Tell those fellows to go out and keep\nquiet. Her mother is here.\n(Mrs. H. : What do you mean by here ?) Phinuit : Here with me, right\nbeside me. (Mrs. H. : Is she in the body or in the spirit ?) Phinuit : In\nthe body [correct], but I get her spirit influence, so I can tell you about her.\nShe's what \u2014what do you call it ? Your double. That is, the mother and\nyou are alike. You look alike, you know what I mean ; that is, you are\nboth the same. [Correct.]\n(Mrs. H. : See if you can get any friends of hers.) Phinuit : I called for\nyour father's watch and you said you couldn't give it to me. You ought to\nbring that for me to help me out. I can't bring any one without their\ninfluence. He's in the spirit and the mother's in the body. [Correct.]\nOh, she's such a beautiful lady. (Mrs. H. : I thought about bringing the\nwatch. )\nPhiuuit : I know you wanted to bring that, and that's why I called for it.\nBut, oh, weren't you stupid ? [To others.] Why don't you keep away ? I'll\ntalk to you and then I'll talk to them.\n[Mrs. H. gives Phinuit a toy wheelbarTow made by Walter.] Now wait a\nminute. Who's that they call Bub ? Who's B-r-o-b-e-r-t-s ?

Put that down there quick. That's father's. Here's Willis.\n[Unknown.] Here's a mother, Marie. Marie is the mother [Mary, correct]\nand a wife of this gentleman that's talking to you. Don't you suppose\nI know that. She's the lady's mother. [Yes.] [Mary is the name of\nMrs. H.'s mother, not Walter's wife*] Your father just told me that.\nTell him that I'm alive in the spirit. I am not dead. That name was\nEd\u2014Ed. [Emphatic.] [Ed. correct name.] He wanted to send a message\nto you. It sounded like Fred. I called it Fred, but it's Ed, if you please.\nEd. That's my dear friend, you know. [EJ., Mrs. H.'s brother, Hying,\na dear friend of Walter.*] [The apparent confusion here becomes clear if\nwe suppose that the father of Mrs. H. and also her cousin Walter were both\npresent giving messages. \u2014R.H.] Evly\u2014Evie\u2014Evie. Dear Evie, I want\nher to be good.\n(Mrs. H. : She is good. )\nPhinuit : I want her to live right. He is awfully anxious to send his love\nto his mother. And to Mary, too. She didn't understand him, that is, since\nhe passed out. That is, since he was here she didn't understand that he\nlived. She doesn't understand that he is here. She didn't understand him,\nand never did since he came out of the body.\n(Mrs. H. : Can you get the father's name ?)\nPhinuit : Henry. Who is Henry ? Who's your father ? He wants to\nsend his regards to Henry. Tell Henry I'll talk to him soon.\n(Mrs. H. : Who is Henry ?)\nPhinuit : He is my brother ; he sends me to see him. [Correct.] [Henry\nis brother of Mrs. H.'s father.*]\n(Mrs. H. : Wants to see Henry ?)\nPhinuit : That's your Uncle Henry. He is in the body. [Correct.] How\never, he wants to be remembered to you, and asks me how things are at the\noffice\u2014at the office. He wants to know that because he's frequently at the\noffice. [Intimate business relations existed between the two.] Please speak\nto me. Give me something belonging to your father.\n(Mrs. H. : I haven't anything. )\nPhinuit : Well, give me Walter's little instrument. Here he comes. He\nhad a little clock shaped thing, and he made that also, he tells me. [Correct.]\nThere's a little chair, you recollect that. [No.] The little chair, little stool,\nwith a round top, with a pyramid on the top. He made that and he\nremembers it distinctly. [Walter's instrument is the toy wheelbarrow\npreviously referred to. He also made many little brackets and other things,\namong them a small clock which he had given to Mrs. H.'s mother. Nothing\nremembered about the chair.*]\nBut who is Evie ? He says he remembers her perfectly, and wants her to\nknow that he is satisfied over here. That's where the sister comes in that I\ntold you about. J-o-h-n. Tell John, J-a-ane,\u2014wait a minute. I haven't\ngot that right. That connected with Evie. [No.] Oh, here's Will.\n[Unknown]. He's smiling, and he's in the body. J-o-h-n. I don't know\nhow you pronounce that, but that is connected with him too.\n(Mrs. H. : Who is John ?)\n\f466 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nPhinuit : That's his John. [John, child of W.'s intimate friend, of whom\nhe was very fond.] [See helow.\u2014R.H.] He belongs to him, and that\nbelongs to you. That's his boy. There is a little girl, and he's trying to tell\nme about them all, and he's very fond of these two children. [Correct.]\nI've got something the matter with my head. [Killed by an injury on the\nhead.]\n(Mrs. H. : Did you suffer with your head ?)\nPhinuit : He tells me it hurt him. It hurt his head. Inhere [feeling of\nthe neck, arm, and shoulder]. She'll know all about it. Now I woke up\nquick and I didn't know I was out of the body. I woke up and found that I\nwas living again. Tell her that. You'll forgive me if I ramble, but this is\nstrange to me. I'll get over this condition in a minute. It hurt me, didn't\nit 1 It was accidental.

He's a friend of his, you know\u2014most\nintimate friend on earth, you know. [Correct.] And he says he wants to\nsend his love to him particularly. He gives you this so you know he is here.\nTell him that I wish he wouldn't fret because everything is all right. It was\nso to be, and I am happy now. You can ask me any questions you like.\nThere are two of us h-re.

[David fond of the children.] (Dr. H. : Very well.)\nPhinuit : Busy as ever? You're all right, feeling well? He says that\nhe is going to see his friend and is coming back to see you. (Dr. H. : Is his\nfriend in the body now ?) Phinuit : He is in the body, he has not passed\nout. (Dr. H. : Is he well ?) Phinuit : He's going to see. He's left for a\nminute, and he will come back and tell you all about him. I'll talk about\nhim in a minute. Is there anybody else you want to see ? That gentleman's\nmother is here. (Dr. H. : Is she in the body ?)\nPhinuit : . . . That little girl of yours is a perfect little positive ;\nshe will have her own way. I would let her have it if I were you. She'll\nmake a noble woman. As soon as she gets over this little difficulty she'll\nbe all right.\n(Dr. H. : How about the other child ?) Phinuit : The little rascal. He's\ngood, honest, different in temperament, that all. [Correct.] Is there\nanything you want to say particularly ? (Dr. H. : Can you tell me something\nabout this person ?) [An old silver spoon was placed on Mrs. Piper's head.\nIt was one of a pair. Dr. and Mrs. H. knew very little of its history, and\nnothing of the people connected with it.]\nPhinuit : You know he keeps calling El\u2014rie. [Unknown.] Wait a\nminute. I have called it to you two or three times. That's connected with\nthis. Oh, I have heart trouble. A difficulty around here, and a kidney\ntrouble comes with this. [Phinuit at this point had silver spoon on head ]\nI don't believe I'll get that so clear for you. Now there's a lady and gentle\nman both connected with this ; the lady is in the body and the gentleman's\nin the spirit. [No history of spoons except they were made from the hilt of\nan old sword. No names connected with them known.*]\n(Dr. H. : Is the lady well ?)\nPhinuit : There's something I'll tell you about. You may not believe it,\nbut there's something the matter with her head. [Age only.] There's also\na nervous condition. I can't get that so well as I can the other. Who's\nthat they call L-u-r-i-e, L-a-u-r-i-e, \u2014Laurie, Laurie?

I get those two a little mixed.\nThat's connected with this, and there's something else belonging to him.\nYou know there are two like this. [Dr. H. brings second spoon from bag\nand gives to Phinuit.] Now I've got them together, now I want the glove.\n[Dr. H. gets glove from bag also, which is placed with spoon on Phinuit's\nhead.] Merci.

D-e-s-k,\n[Unintelligible.] (Dr. H. : Whose desk is it, Doctor?)\nPhinuit : Tell him to take those books and put them back, and get the\npaint and the brush together. What does that mean ? For the pictures are\nall disturbed.\n(Dr. H. : Is this with the spoons ?) [Dr. H. knew nothing of the history\nof the spoons.]\nPhinuit : That's with these things here. And he says that the easel has\nbeen turned around the other side too. Now what does that mean ?\n[Unknown.] (Dr. H. : I don't know.)\nPhinuit : If you get that, you'll understand him, perhaps. What is it\nabout the easel? [Unknown.] (Dr. H. : I don't know.)\nPhinuit : And the books have all been taken from the desk and he wants\nthem to be put up.

Phinuit : That's passed out of the body.\nThat's the one whose lady is in the body and has trouble in the head and in\nthe heart. That's the one that I just called Margaret, and this is connected\nwith you ; she is an aunt. She is connected by blood, you know, not by\nmarriage. [Glove belonged to Margaret's sister. The facts correct.]\n[Margaret, great aunt of Mrs. H., was seriously ill with heart-disease.\nHer husband, Charles, had been dead less than a year. Carrie perhaps an\nattempt at Charlie.*]\n(Dr. H. : Is she going to get well ?)\nPhinuit : This has something to do with Margaret, and this is the one\nwho has got the trouble with her head and with her heart. She looks very\npoorly to me. You don't know this friend, I think. If I could I would tell\nyou she is going to get well, but I see inwardly a more serious condition,\nthat is developed in the lower part of the body, down here. That's Margaret.\n[This trouble (swelling) had existed before ; was supposed by Mrs. H. to be\nabsent at time of sitting, though it did exist at that time, and was observed\nby Mrs. H. upon visiting Margaret some time afterward.]\n(Dr. H. : Do you hear from Margaret's husband at all ?)\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 469\nPhinuit : That's the gentleman who is connected with the other articles\nthat came with this. The other influence you gave me and this came from a\ngentleman in the spirit, and a lady in the body. I'll try to get a message\nfor you as soon as I can.\n(Dr. H. : Has David come back ?) Phinuit : He's gone to find his room\nmate. [Room-mate living. Room-mate's wife dead.*] He'll be back in a\nfew minutes, don't you hurry me. Give me plenty of time and I'll tell you\nall about it. That physical condition is a poor one. Can you help her ?\n(Dr. H. : Well, we'll try.)\nPhinuit : She doesn't worry because there is no necessity of worrying.\nShe's got some sense about it. [Very characteristic of the lady.]\n(Dr. H. : I'll turn this inside out for you, Doctor.)\nPhinuit : That's better. That's the mother. That's connected with\nyour mother, your mother's sister. [Mary the mother of Mrs. H. ;\nMargaret, Mary's aunt, but brought up in same family and usually addressed\neach other as sisters.*] She's a good lady. They're both good. Mary and\nMargaret. Two good names, don't you think so 1\n(Dr. H. : Yes. Tell me about the lady and the glove.) [This glove had\nbeen worn by the owner to the house of her sister Margaret. It is curious\nthat no mention was made of the owner, but only of the invalid sister, about\nwhom all the statements made are entirely correct.]\nPhinuit : You know. I get this. That's not Margaret that's connected\nwith her, but that's the daughter. Oh, you're Marie's daughter. [Feeling\nMrs. H.'s head.] [Correct.]\n(Dr. H. : Do you hear anything from Marie's husband, that is, this lady's\nfather 1)\nPhinuit : You know, I see a great long couch, a long couch in the room,\nwith a little alcove place in it [correct] and I see this girl there. I get music\nwith this. There is some music connected with this. There's somebody\nwho plays well. [All this connected with Margaret. Her daughter very\nmusical.] Who plays very nicely. Is nervous and a little curious.\nMargaret is in the body too. That's funny, and that's her that's speaking.\nI hear that name very distinctly. Send for Charles, and tell him I'm all\nright. Tell him I'm not dead, I'm alive. (Dr. H. : Who says that ?)\nPhinuit : David says that. [David not connected with Margaret or her\ndeceased husband, Charles.*] You folks will have to straighten that out.\nYou connect these people if you can. I could do better if you would leave\nthis with me, and then come back and I'll tell you later. I do like you\nvery much. You're getting on all right in everything, and she's the nicest\nlady in the country.\n(Dr. H. : Do you hear about Eugene ?) Phinuit : E-v-e-n, I called him\nseveral times, but the lady didn't know whom I meant. I tried to get that\nname for you but I couldn't get it. I could get part of the name but I\ncouldn't get all of it. [Abruptly.] I'd like to know who Warren is.\n[Another deceased relative.] This comes in connection with this. [Warren\nhad no connection with the glove.*] Well, it's very trying. He's in the\nspirit, Warren is. There now, I got that all right. Now, friends, you must\ntell me what you want to know most about. (Dr. H. : Has David come\nback?) Phinuit: David is coming. In the meantime about David's friend's\n\f470 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nwife. Is she there ? The wife of David's room mate ? That's Charles.\n[The Charles alluded to above, but he was not David's room mate.]\n(Dr. H. : That's all right.) Phinuit : That Charles sends a message\nto her. Tell her I am all right. That's her husband. (Dr. H. :\nIs David here ?) Phinuit : Louise, Louise. She's in the body. Wait a\nminute. Louise is connected with this Warren. They both want to be\nremembered. They are in the body. Warren is here and the lady is there.\nSo that makes two of them, but she's in the body and he is in the spirit.\n[Warren dead was Louise's grandfather.*] (Dr. H. : That's right.) Phinuit :\nCan you tell me as much as that ? You'll be satisfied when I tell you. Don't\nthink I'm not going to tell you, because I am. (Dr. H. : Who's the lady\nwith David ?) Phinuit : David's gone. I don't know who he'll bring back,\nbut he'll be back in a few minutes. Margaret is connected with this also,\nand I get the name very distinctly of Henry and Will, William. The\nWilliam is a brother also. Henry is a brother of the father. I thought\nthat there was a Will and Henry, but it's William Henry, one person, the\ntwo names come together. [Quite correct.] [William Henry, brother of\nMrs. H.'s father, whose home was in Brooklyn.*]\n(Dr. H. : Is the father happy ?)\nPhinuit : That fellow had a trouble with his head, with his neck.\n[Probably referring to Walter.] Frank is coming. Rockwood\u2014Rockwood.\nBrooklyn ; with David, just returned from Brookwood. This is David.\nDr.\u2014Dr. \u2014Hertford.\u2014Herford. [Unintelligible.] Who's he talking about,\nDoctor ? (Dr. H. : I don t know, Doctor.)\nPhinuit: H-o-u-g-h-t-o n\u2014Houghton. Oh, I can't get it. (Dr. H. : Is\nit David that's talking ?)\nPhinuit: I can't get that. B-e-l-l-e-n. B-a-r-r-e-t-l. (Dr. H. : Who\nsaid that ?) Phinuit : Barrett, that's it. Now you have it. He's connected\nwith David. He is, indeed, and he's all right. [Barrett, a business friend\nof David.] (Dr. H. : Is Barrett in the body?) Phinuit: Tell the Doctor\nhe is with him and he is all right. [Barrett living.*]\n(Dr. H. : How about the wife of David's room mate ?) Phinuit : She's\nin the spirit. She's the one I spoke to you about in the first place. Her\nname, that is the one I told you about, that she has you know, is Evelyn.\n[No.] (Dr. H. : What was her name, the wife of David's room mate ?)\nPhinuit : She's the one who came in with Evelyn, Alice we called her. She\nis all right, and sends her love to you. [Alice was the name. But Mrs. H.\nhad brought with her something given by Alice to Evelyn, and the names\nand persons were closely associated in her mind.]\nWho's Tom ? He knows him.. David's connected with him also. [A\nfriend.] Thompson. [Unknown.*] There you've got it. I'll have to see\nyou again, friends. You speak to David and ask him if there's anything he\nwants to do in the meantime. (Dr. H. : Has David any message for his\nfather ?) Phinuit : Ask the lady. His father came to him with her.\n[Unknown.*] He's what you call not low, but poorly\u2014not in good health.\n[Correct.] I can't toll you anything about this, I'm too weak. [Phinuit\ntakes a ring.] That's connected with that also. I wish I had had that a\nlittle sooner, but I'm too weak now. I'm sorry, good-bye. Ruthie. Mollie.\n[Unknown.]\n\fxxxiii ] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 471\nMay 17th, 1892.\nAt the house of Dr. A. B. Thaw in New York. [R, H. taking\nnotes.]\nThe following account is an abridgment with names changed, and one or\ntwo other circumstances somewhat modified. I was sent out of the room\npart of the time, and the lady, friend of the sitter, who was to have written\nout the record of the sitting, began but did not complete it, and the notes\nare particularly deficient as to which questions were asked by the sitter\nin Italian and which in English.\nThe sitter was an Italian lady, Madame Frederica, who had lived long\nenough in America to be familiar with English. The deceased sister, Madame\nElisa, also spoke English as well as Italian.\nPhinuit referred to the \" sister,\" attempted a name that had no signifi\ncance, made attempts at the name Frederica, gave a personal description of\nElisa, also designated (by pointing out locality, etc.), the trouble that caused\nher death, and mentioned some specific points in connection with the scene\nat the moment of her dying. A watch which had belonged to Madame Elisa\nhad been lost or mislaid by the sitter, who inquired about it ; but the\nstatements made concerning its whereabouts did not lead to its being\nfound.\nThe communicator began to write \" Dear Sister,\" and was at once\nrequested to write in Italian, and several sheets were written\u2014some fifty\nwords, of which a few are evidently repetitions, attempts to write more\nclearly, but none of it is clearly decipherable except the words si [yes] and\nmia [my] and the Christian names of the ' ' communicator \" and the sitter.\nThe hypothetical interpretation of several other words is much too doubtful\nto be of any evidential value as indicating a knowledge of Italian words.\nThe communicator was then requested to write in English, and Phinuit\nbegged the sitter not to speak so loud. The sitter then asked in Italian,\n\" Does my voice hurt you, Elisa ? \" The reply was, \" My dear sister, I hear\nyou speak to me and it makes me so happy to hear your dear voice again.\"\nThere were then some replies written to questions about the whereabouts of\nthe lost watch, some of the words being undecipherable, but the writing\nended, as we ascertained afterwards, by an attempt to write the communi\ncator's full name.\nGeorge Pelham, known to both the sitter and her sister, then acted as\namanuensis for Madame Elisa, after greeting the sitter, and wrote replies to\nquestions about the watch. I interrupted her by a demand for the last name\nof the communicator, to which G. P. wrote : \" Don't bother me while her\nsister is speaking to me please, for I have quite enough to do without this.\"\nLater on G. P. referred to the sitter's mother as with the communicator,\nadding that he himself did not know her. [Correct.] There was further\nwriting of a personal character, after which I asked where had I been with\nthe communicator, at Newport. We had been guests at the same house\ntogether, and the name of our hostess was correctly written. The writing\nended, and I supposed that the surname of the communicator had not been\ngiven but the last faint scrawls, as we found later, were clearly intended\nfor this name. Suddenly Phinuit called out \" Who's M-A-N-N-O-R-S. I\n\f472 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\ngot that for H-O-D-G-S-O-N. Tell Hodgson I gave this to you as I could\nnot stay there longer on account of Elisa.\" This was G. P.'s message\napparently through Phinuit. \"Mannors\" was the surname of Madame\nElisa. Immediately after Phinuit's departure, and before Mrs. Piper\nrecovered consciousness, the following was whispered in Italian : Sta Bene,\nSta Bene, Pazienzn, Pazienza, Pazienza. [It is well. Patience.] [For other\ncommunications from Madame Elisa, see pp. 335-6.]\nJanuary 2Sth, 1893.\nSitter : Mr. T. B. C. (Associate A.B.S.P.R.), Minneapolis, Minn.\n[Mr. C. gave me the following account on the afternoon of the day\nof the sitting.\u2014R. H.] :\u2014\nPhinuit said there was a lady who wanted to speak with me, my wife.\nHe indicated that she died of inflammation, and gave the name of the disease\nperitonitis. He gave the name Louise, and said Louise was my daughter,\nand was with her mother, and that others were there also with them. He\nthen gave the names Irrie, Nellie, Dellie (D E L L I E) and Lizzie, and said\nthey were my [four other] children in spirit, as is true. [All these state\nments were correct.\u2014R. H.]\nLaura was mentioned and said to be my sister. [Correct. She died\nnearly forty years ago.]\nPhinuit further said there were two children in the body\u2014some distance\naway. One of them, \"nice bright little fellow,\" was sick, had sore throat\nand something the matter with his head. [True, when I left them three\ndays ago in Washington.] Phinuit said that he would come out all right,\nand live a long time. Phinuit gave these statements as coming from my\nwife and Louise. Louise also said, \"Give my love to Lon.\" There was\nsome stumbling over the name Lon, which was, however, finally correctly\ngiven, and spelled out Alonzo, which is the full name. But she always\ncalled him Lon. This is her husband, still living.\nIrvie was rightly said to have died of consumption.\n[There was some writing apparently by Louise, as follows] :\u2014\n[If by Louise, she must have been acting as amanuensis for her mother\nwhose name was Sarah.\u2014R. H.] \"I told you in my note to keep the\nappointment, did I not, dear?\" Spoken. \"This appointment was what I\nmeant.\" [See note below.] [I had given one of my wife's rings to a friend\nof hers. Knowledge of this was shown in the following writing] :\u2014\n\"Give my ring to my dear friend.\" (Was that right?) Yes. (Who\nwas the friend ?) [Attempts at Shepherd, which was finally written]\nS H E P A R D. [Should have been Shepherd.]\nThe other writings are private messages of personal affection to convince\nme that my relatives were actually present and talking with me.\nIt was mentioned that Hattie's mother had died of cancer, and that I\ncould find this from Hattie. This is not yet known to me, but Hattie is my\nbrother's wife still living. [Afterwards ascertained to be not true.]\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 473\nNote by Mr. V.\nOn January 22nd, 1893, I tried Ouija Board for the first time with a\nprivate lady friend in Washington who has had various remarkable experiences\nwith it. A few private things came out at the first sitting which were a great\nsurprise to me, but somewhat personal. At our next trial, which was on\nJanuary 24th, several messages were spelt out as coming from my wife, who\nwrote, inter alia :\u2014\n\" All your movements are noticed. (By whom 1) By me. (Who ?) By\nSarah. Did I not mention to you that I am always waiting for you. Bitter\nit is. Meet your appointment. You should trust. I make you no promises.\nI am a law at your side. \"\nI kept this appointment [sitting with Mrs. Piper] specially because of\nthis message, which was thus indirectly corroborated as coming from her by\nthe communication through Mrs. Piper.\nI have never seen any Spiritualistic medium before of any sort.\n[Some weeks previously I had made two different appointments for Mr.\nC. to accompany me to Mrs. Piper, but both these sittings had to be given\nup, in one case owing to Mrs. Piper's illness, and in the other owing to\ncircumstances connected with the death of a friend of Mrs. Piper's. In one\nof these cases Mr. C. met me at the Boston station. In the other case I\nsent a note to his hotel to prevent his going to the station. In neither case\ndid he go out to Arlington Heights. Mr. C. was travelling about a great\ndeal, and arranged that I should have a sitting on his behalf with some\narticles which he sent me for the purpose. I informed him by letter that\nI would have the sitting on January 28th, but he finally decided to come to\nBoston again himself. Not finding me at the Boston Station, he thought\nthat the arrangement for the sitting had fallen through, but was induced to\ngo on to Mrs. Piper's by the persistent iteration of the thought \"Keep\nyour appointment.\" I had requested Mr. Howard to take my place that\nmorning, so that he might ask G. P. a question, the answer to which was\nknown to me, but not to Mr. Howard (see p. 439), who explained the matter\nto Mr. C. on meeting him at Mrs. Piper's house.\u2014R. H.]\nFebruary 8th, 1893.\nSitters : Mr. and Mrs. Thomas B. MacDonough. R. H. taking\nnotes, but not very full ones. Mr. MacDonough is an Associate\nA.B.S.P.R., New York district. Mr. MacDonough's comments were\nnot made till about the time of his letter which follows the report,\nJuly 1st, 1896, when he made some notes on the type-written copy\nof my record which I sent him, and gave further explanations in\nhis letter.\n[Phinuit.]\nHere's the Colonel.

She was laid up about six months. Her fall\nand escape were miraculous, and furnished the newspapers at the time with\nmaterial for illuminated cuts, etc., etc.]\nThos. B. MacDonouuh.\nThe Birches, Lake Mooselookmeguntic.\nRangeley Lakes, Maine, July 1st, 1896.\nDear Mb. Honuson,\u2014I kept no notes of the sitting with Mrs. Piper,\nand therefore the three years which have elapsed 1 eaves me hazy regarding\nit. All I can positively remember I have set down on schedule, or incor\nporate hero.\nNote, No. 1. The old gentleman who asks \" what about those papers ?\"\nwas Michael MacDonough, my father. Phinuit, in struggling with his first\nname, called him \"Michel\" which is French for Michael. As I seemed at\nthe time to recognise my father, I suggested the correct name or English of\nit, and Phinuit, with emphasis accepted the translation. The only connec\ntion I can make with the \"papers\" asked about and my father's pride about\nthem, arises from this. My father was an Englishman, who came to this\ncountry in 1834. He was treasurer of the Carvers' and Gilders' Association\nor Guild of London\u2014now defunct. As its representative he had purchased\na building site for the guild\u2014the deeds for which were somehow made in\n\f476 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nhis name. I can remember, when I was a lad, quite a little excitement in\nour household ovor a letter from Lo:ulon asking my father to go before\nsome authority\u2014possibly the British Consul, and make over the property\nto the guild -since they could do nothing with it or about it while he had\nlegal possession. We were very poor. My father's pride arose from the\nfact of his prompt compliance.\nNo. 2. The leak referred to was a defect in tower on the east side of our\ncottage at Long Branch. We followed my brother's directions, discovered\nthe leak under the window sill and repaired it.\nNo. 3. My brother's son\u2014John Jr. \u2014was at this time quarrelling with\nhis employers, . . . Theatrical Agents . . . and was contem\nplating throwing up his situation. His head and throat were ailing him\u2014\nall this I heard about after the sitting. I had hitherto supposed his relations\nwith his firm to be most amicable.\nNo. 4. At this time I had been suffering for some time with pains about\nthe heart, and was alarmed, supposing it to be organic. I asked Phinuit\nwhether he could see anything the matter with me. His reply was remark -\nable. Some time after the sitting I consulted a physician, and by the way,\nhe was Dr. Pomroy, a clairvoyant, who pronounced my case one of indiges\ntion\u2014using almost the same words Phinuit used. Both have been proven\ncorrect. Indigestion has long been my tormentor.\nI am unable to recall all of the message signed George [February 2 1st,\n1894, see below] except that part which said \" you will sell Kansas property\nthis year.\" The property is not in Kansas\u2014but Kansas City, Mo. It is\nnot sold. My brother died February 12th, 1892.\nI hardly think you will make much out of this, but it is the best I can\ndo. Mrs. MacD. appends her signature and unites in regards.\u2014Yours, etc.,\nThos. B. MacDonouuh.\nI have read my husband's notes of the sitting wo jointly held with Mrs.\nPiper in company with Dr. Hodgson, February 8th, 1893, and append my\nsignature in corroboration.\nFrances MacDonottoh.\n[It is probable that on February 8th I told \" John Mc \" that he could\nsend communications to his brother through me. Numerous instances of\nbrief messages of this type from various communicators have occurred at\nsittings, and I give the following as illustrations.]\nOn February 13th, 1893, in the presence of another sitter, Phinuit said :\n\" John sends his love to Tom and Frank,\" and on February 17th, 1893, at a\nsitting which I was holding on behalf of another person, the following\nmessage was written :\u2014\n\" I am John Mc, you [wanted ?] me, did you not. I am John Mc, very\nwell, I came here to speak to you one minute.\nWhose hat is that ! (That is not yours.) I see, I don't recall it. Oh, I\nsee now, but who are you, please ?

Kansas City was mentioned by\nMr. MacDonough at the sitting on February 8th. \"Frank\" is Mrs.\nMacDonough, but Mr. Mac Donough may have called her \"Frank \" at the\nsitting of February 8th. On January 18th, 1894, when G. P. was writing,\nthe following occurred :\u2014\n. . . \"There is a confusion, H., you had better wait a little until it\ngets more quiet here. Do [you] know this is just like being in a very large\nhall and hearing two or three dozen voices all at the same time discussing\ndifferent subjects. . . .\nWho is this John McDonough. (I know his brother. I understand and\nwill send message). Give my love to him and say that I should be delighted\nto see him and Frank again some time and tell him to hold on for awhile\nlonger and I will advise him just what to do. 1 am ever your brother,\nJohn Mc. Do you know these people, H. ? (Yes, that's all right). O. K.\nI didn't. (Tell him I'll send the message). Oh, good.\"\nI forwarded this to Mr. MacDonough, who replied :\u2014\n\"Pittsburgh, Pa., January 29th, 1894.\nDear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014The message you send, and which I re-enclose, is\nsingularly opportune.

Ingraham, M.D., of Boston, Mass., who has furnished me\nwith the following account. The reference to Mrs. Piper's pulse and\ntemperature concerned a sitting with Mrs. Piper on March 12th,\n1893, which was almost exclusively devoted to conversation between\nPhinuit and Dr. Ingraham and two other doctors, during which I was\nnot present.\nMay 20th, 1896.\nDear Mr. Hodgson,\u2014The operation upon Mrs. Piper was coeliotomy\nfor removal of diseased Fallopian tubes and ovaries. . . . The wound\nhealed by first intention, and the patient had an uninterrupted and uneventful\nrecovery. Upon exammation after operation the parts were found in good\ncondition, with complete relief of all symptoms for which the operation\nwas done.\nMrs. Piper's pulse before the trance was rapid, from the fact that she\nbecame rather excited over dread of examination, operation, etc., but just\nbefore the trance it was about seventy-two per minute, and was not\naccelerated during the trance.\nHer temperature was 99 deg. before, during and after the trance She\ntook ether without any unusual symptoms.\u2014I am very truly,\n7, Gloucester Streot. ^' In0ItAHA51-\nThe operation was performed at Dr. Cushing's Sanitarium,\nBrookline, Mass., and I went out to the Sanitarium and remained in\nthe building while the operation was performed, so that I might be of\nassistance in case of any unusual occurrence. After the operation,\nand while Mrs. Piper, who had been taken to her room, was still under\nthe influence of the ether, and apparently unconscious of any person\npresent, Dr. Ingraham requested me to enter the room, as Mrs. Piper\nwas calling for me. I went in and spoke to her, but she seemed to be\nquite unaware of my presence, although she moaned occasionally, and\nseveral times called out spasmodically \" Mr. Hodgson.\" During this\ninterval of unconsciousness her attention became fixed as upon an\nobject of interest, and she exclaimed : \" Who is that old man ? Take\nhim away.\" Then came a pause, as if she was listening, and she then\nadded, \" Oh, no. He's a nice old man. He can stay.\" This\nnaturally caused me to think of Phinuit.\nThe first sittings Mrs. Piper gave after her operation were two in\nthe early part of September to a previous sitter, and were largely\n\f480 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\npersonal. I was present taking notes. There were personal messages\nto other previous sitters from G. P. and others. At the first sitting,\nSeptember 7th, 1893, Phinuit said, with reference to the operation :\n\" I saw the medium on a long table and helped her out. I saw\nHodgson too, and tried to make the medium see me.\"\nI believe that the first sittings given afterwards were those\narranged for by Mrs. Howard.\nEarly in October, 1893.\nSitter : Mr. L. Vernon Briggs, Hanover, Mass.\nDuring this month I was in Chicago, and Mrs. Howard arranged\nfor two sittings at the house of Mrs. T. in Boston, who was present\nfor a few minutes, for a private conversation with Phinuit, not\nrecorded, at a sitting of March 12th, 1893. Some notes were made at\nthese two sittings, chiefly by Mrs. Howard, but I did not receive a\ncopy till several months later from Mrs. T. Mr. Briggs was present\nat the second sitting only. I understood at the time that the sitters\nwere anxious for privacy, and did not learn who Mr. Briggs was till\nthe summer of 1895. Mr. Briggs never had an opportunity of study\ning at leisure the attempts at Hawaiian writing at his sitting, the\noriginal writings of which were apparently lost. I received in the\nearly part of November a brief account orally from Mrs. Howard of\nthe sitting concerned with Kalua, at which she was present, and also\nMrs. T. The following is from the written account which I received\nfrom Mrs. T.\n******\nThe medium was then given a handkerchief of a Honolulu boy who had\nbeen shot in Boston\u2014intentionally or unintentionally was not known. This\nboy had shown great affection for a person present\u2014fallowing them twice to\nBoston from Honolulu as a stowaway. The medium showed great suffering\n\u2014placed her hand to her side, saying, \"It's my stomach\u2014Oh, my side.\nThey put me out too quick.\" Here the medium seemed to suffer too much,\nand Dr. Phinuit was asked to take control and speak for the boy. Conver\nsation continued through Dr. Phinuit. \u2014\"Is this you, Kalua?\" [This\nquestion was put by Mr. Briggs.\u2014R. H.]\n\" Yes, I did not kill myself. He killed me. We were gambling\u2014that\nwas wrong. He hid my purse under the steps where I was killed.\" [The\ncellar was examined\u2014five planks, one below another, we\/e taken up but no\npurse was found.] Kalua also said there was shrubbery near it. [There\nwas no shrubbery in the cellar of this house.]\nThe boy seemed delighted to speak with his friend, and finally took the\nhand and wrote, \" This is splendid\u2014Oh, Dr., help me.\" He asked questions,\nand tried to give the name of a place in the Hawaiian Islands, which finally\nwas made out. He then tried to write his own language, and did write some\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 481\nwords which were understood. For instance, he wrote \" lei,\" which means\n\" wreaths\"\u2014and which he always made daily for his friend.\nDr. Phinuit said what he heard sounded like Italian\u2014and that the boy\nwas singing\u2014which ho was always doing in life. He spoke again of his\ndeath, and said : \"The man had a hot temper and disputed with me, and\nhe shot me\u2014he did not mean to.\" [Question] \" What became of the\nrevolver?\" [Answer] \" He threw the revolver into the hot-box where the\npepples are.\" [Note. \u2014This was true\u2014the revolver was found in the\nfurnace.] [Known to Mr. Briggs. By pepples was meant pebbles, inter\npreted by the sitters as coals. \u2014R. H.]\n\" Did you get my trunk 1\" \"Yes.\" \"So glad you have it\u2014keep my\nthings.\" \" Did you get them, M. i \" \"Yes.\"\nHe was asked where his father was. And we could only understand\nHiram. \u2014 Phinuit could not get Hawaii for sometime\u2014it was finally written\nHawaiin Islands. We asked which one \u2014Phinuit said it was Tawai. This\nwas interesting, as the island is spelled with a K, but pronounced with a T.\nThe following is my record from notes of a conversation with Mr.\nL. Vernon Briggs on June 11th, 189o, revised by Mr. Briggs. \u2014R. H.\nJune 12th, 1895.\nMr. L. Vernon Briggs, of Hanover, Mass. , called upon me yesterday morn\ning, and gave me an account of his sitting with Mrs. Piper in October, 1893.\nThe sitting was arranged for by Mrs. Howard, and was held at the house\nof Mrs. T. Mr. Briggs attended the sitting, and was introduced as Mr.\nSmith.\nMr. Briggs had taken with him a handkerchief and other articles that\nhad been worn by a Hawaiian whose acquaintance he had made originally in\nHonolulu. His name was Kalua.\nDuring the time, six months, that Mr. Briggs lived in Honolulu, Kalua\nbecame very much attached to him, and was very anxious to accompany him\nwhen ho left the Islands in the year 1881 to return to America.\nOne day, about July in the year 1883, a cousin of Mr. Briggs entered his\noffice accompanied by Kalua. It appeared that Kalua, when the ship which\nhad taken Mr. Briggs away, returned to the island, had concealed himself\nin the hold and lived on raw onions till the ship was well out to sea. When\nhe revealed himself the Captain sent him to the forecastle, and finding that\nhe was intelligent, and taking a liking to him, employed him as cabin-boy.\nHe accompanied the ship to China, and when it returned to Boston left it\nand inquired for Briggs. Some person explained the directory to him, and\nit happened tlvvt the first person by the aame of Briggs whoso address he\ngot from the directory was a cousin of Mr. L. V. Briggs. This gentleman\nknew something about Kalua from the letters which his cousin had written\nhim from Honolulu, and he took him around at once to Mr. Briggs' office.\nHe lived with Mr. Briggs some months. He was a very devoted servant,\nand was very ambitious, and anxious to be educated.\nAfter three months he was sent back to his native island very much\nagainst his own wish, but when the ship arrived at Honolulu he refused to\nland, climbing to the top of the mast and remaining there half a day lest ho\nshould be dragged from the vessel, possibly.\n\f482 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nEventually the Captain brought him back again to Boston, and he again\nsought out Mr. Briggs, who placed him at an academy, where he learned\nvery rapidly.\nWhile in the academy he went to a sailors' Bethel, where he had somc\nclothes stored in a trunk. He had purchased a new trunk, and was taking\nthe clothes from the old and putting them into the new trunk. Word came\nto Mr. Briggs that Kalua had committed suicide by shooting himself.\nInquiry was made, and it appeared that Kalua was engaged in the work of\nremoving his clothes from one trunk to the other when a revolver went off\nand shot him through the heart. The announcement of his having shot\nhimself was made by a Swede, Olaf, who immediately disappeared. Officers\nwere immediately sent in search, and discovered him after some time on\nboard a Gloucester fishing smack that was about to sail. He said that Kalua\nwas engaged in taking out the cartridge from a revolver with a knife when it\nwent off, and that he had run away because he was afraid of being\nimprisoned.\nHe was imprisoned, but there was no evidence against him, and eventu\nally, after remaining some time in prison, he was discharged. The revolver\ncould not be found anywhere, and it was supposed that the Swede must\nhave thrown it into the harbour. Finally the Swede was induced to confess\nhe had hidden it behind a flue. Part of the chimney was taken down, and\nthe revolver was actually found there.\nSitting with Mrs. Piper :\u2014The articles were produced. Phinuit placed\nhis hand on the heart and spoke about the heart. There was also some\nwriting purporting to be by Kalua. The word \" lei,\" meaning wreaths, was\nwritten clearly and frequently, and there was also an attempt to write the\nword \"aloha,\" which means greeting. There were apparent attempts at\nother words in Hawaiian, which could not be deciphered.\nKalua was very fond of making wreaths of wild flowers.\nPhinuit also gave the name of \"Tawai,\" pronouncing it, but in the\nwriting the word was spelled \"Kawai.\"\nBy the natives of the island itself, and on the island where Kalua was\nborn, this word is pronounced \"Tawai,\" although it is spoiled \"Kawai.\"\nThe natives of the other islands call it \" Kawai.\"\n[I think if you refer to the notes, that this statement cau be added to\nconsiderably. I first met Kalua probably in February, 1881. He came to\nBoston first in 1883, lastly in 1885. He was killed in June, 1886. I left\nHonolulu in May, 1881.\nL.- Vernon Briggs.]\nEarly in October, 1893.\nSitter : Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, Professor W. James present.

See the letter from Professor James, p. 494.\n1524, Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa., January 27th, 1894.\nMy Dear James. \u2014I have read, with care, since the receipt of your\nnote, the memoranda you and I made at my sitting with Mrs. Piper. I\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 483\nreturn thom to you, as they are of no special value to me, and you may\nfind the name desired. My report would be this :\u2014\nIf I had never seen you and heard your statements in regard to Mrs. P.,\nmy afternoon sitting with her would have led me to the conclusion that the\nwhole thing was a fraud and a very stupid one. Of course I do not think\nthis, because I am bound to consider all the statements made, not merely\nthe time spent with me. As to this point I want to make myself clear,\nbecause I should like on another occasion to repeat my sitting.\nOn re-reading your notes I find absolutely nothing of value. None of\nthe incidents are correct, and none of the very vague things hinted at are\ntrue, nor have they any kind or sort of relation to my life, nor is there one\nname correctly given. . . .\nS. Weir Mitchell (M.D.).\nNovember 18th, 1893.\nSitter: Mr. A. A. C. (Member A.B.S.P.R.) [R. H. taking notes.]\nIn September, 1893, a message was sent to Mr. C. purporting to come\nfrom his deceased brother Harry through G. P.\nNear the beginning of this sitting Phinuit said, \"Do you know who's\nHarry ? He hasn't been here a great while.\" As this applied to the sitter's\nbrother, Phinuit was encouraged to get all the information he could from\n\"Harry,\" but in Phinuit's talk, as also in the writing that followed, the\nnames and other references, amid some confusion, had no significance for the\nsitter. Especially the \"Harry\" was anxious to send a message to \" Gussie\nin the body.\" G. P. wrote, but there was some confusion which perplexed\nhim, and he apparently did not recognise me at first, but thought I was\nHoward. He wrote that there was \"not so much light as there is some\ntimes,\" and he left to try aud clear the matter up. Then came some more\nwriting, probably from the first cmimunicator, and then again another wrote,\nwho soon gave his name as Carrington. [This was a friend of Mr. T. B. C,\nwho had the previous sitting, November 16th, at the end of which sitting\nCarrington was represented as present, and I had explained that at some\nother time I would take a message for him.] I told him that I would be\nglad to listen to him another day, but that I was anxious to hear then\nfrom the friends of the sitter. He then apologised for mixing things up,\nbut reminded me that I had told him to come. \" Did you not tell me to\ncome another time ? . . . Then why did you not explain to me ? . . .\nBut you see I am sorry for this, as I did not know, and besides there's not\nmuch strength to come in on, so I have tried to make the best of it.\nExcuse me, sir, and I will go out. Now I am going. Good-day, sir.\"\nFollowing this Phinuit talked again, but the only relevant matter was,\n\" Young man named Harry\u2014I want to see my brother.\" Phinuit also com\nplained of confusion.\nMrs. Piper had begun to come out of trance, but was strongly convulsed\nagain, and the hand moved to write. I put a pencil in it, and a very direct\npersonal communication was written to the sitter, who was addressed by his\nfirst name. The full name\u2014first, middle, and surname\u2014of his brother\n\f484 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nHarry, from whom the communication purported to come, was written\nseveral times with great violence, tearing the paper of the block book. The\nwild anxiety of the communicator, as shown in the writing and in the\nmovements of Mrs. Piper's hand and arm, was very striking, but it would\nbe difficult to appreciate this without witnessing it. Phinuit stated on\nNovember 23rd that when he \" went out \" he found this young man, who\nbugged most earnestly for the opportunity of speaking to his brother, and\nthat he, Phinuit, had \"helped him in,\" &c. (See. p. 325.)\nTwo or three days later I learned of circumstances which threw some\nlight upon the confusion in connection with the Harry who was represented\nas sending messages at the beginning of the sitting, and whom I had\nencouraged. Mrs. Howard not long beforo had taken a lady to a sitting\nwho was very anxious for privacy, and who had received, as Mrs. Howard\ninformed me, very remarkable communications from her deceased husband\nHarry, and it was arranged that if he wished to communicate with her\nagain he should announce that Harry wished to send a message to Gussie.\nMrs. Howard was to tell me of this, so that in case of such a message I\nmight deliver it to her for transmission ; but Mrs. Howard had not had an\nopportunity of giving me this information until after the sitting of\nNovember 18th. It reminded me of the statements at Mr. C.'s sitting, and\nI submitted them to Mrs. Howard, who stated that they were relevant, and\nevidently intended for her friend. I have received no statement, however,\nfrom her friend, who remains uuknown to me.\nDecember 8th and 21st, 1893.\nThe appointments for these sittings were made by me.. Mrs.\nHoward was present on both occasions and took notes, which I think\ncan be substantially relied upon, as Mrs. Howard is a rapid writer,\nand had been present at many previous sittings (the G. P. series and\nothers, see Appendix I.), and was aware of the importance of recording\nany information given by the sitter. Mrs. Sutton herself has had\nmany remarkable psychical experiences, especially in seeing the\n\" figures \" of deceased persons, and in 1887 published a little book\ngiving an account of some of these. It was called Light cm the Hidden\nWay, with an Introduction by James Freeman Clarke. (Boston:\nTicknor and Company). The book was published anonymously. It\nhappened, however, that I knew a member of the publishing firm, who\nsent me a copy of the book, with a letter of introduction to Mrs.\nKatharine B. Paine (as her name then was), who at that time lived in\nCooperstown, N.Y. I never used the letter of introduction, and did\nnot see Mrs. Katharine Paine Sutton till after her sittings with Mrs.\nPiper. Mrs. Howard, I believe, had made her acquaintance only a\nshort time before the sittings, when Mrs. Sutton was staying for a\nshort time in Boston. The Rev. James Freeman Clarke, who lived in\nBoston, (or its immediate vicinity), was well and widely known. I\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 485\nregard Mrs. Sutton as a most excellent witness. Mrs. Howard was\npresent at various first sittings for persons who were friends of\nhers, and assured me that she always introduced the sitters by the\nname of Smith.

Deport by\nMrs. Sutton from notes token by Mrs. Howard during the sitting.\nMrs. Howard held Mrs. Piper's hands. She became immediately\nentranced under the control of Dr. Phinuit. After a brief communication\nto Mrs. Howard I took Mrs. Piper's hands and Phinuit said : This is a lovely\nlady,\u2014she has done much good,\u2014has helped so many poor souls. A little\nchild is coming to you. This is the dearest lady 1 have met for a long time\u2014\nthe most light I have seen while in Mrs. Piper's body.

I want her to know that I love her and come round her,\nand sing \"Bye, bye,\" when 1 am in heaven. I am so happy with all these\nlittle girls. What was the pretty white thing, with the pretty flowers\nhanging over it, that you put in the little mound ! [The little casket of our\ndead, new born baby.] Phinuit says : Three little mounds, but only their\nbodies there ; their spirits are happy here.\nPhinuit says the lady who has Kakie wants to speak to me.

There is opportunity for him to grow spiritually. They will be\nhappy together.\n[Kakie again.] I will put my hand on papa's head when he goes to sleep.\nWant the babeo.

The little book.\nKakie wants the little book. [She liked a linen picture book.*] I gave\nPhinuit a neck-tie and some writing, and he began : Where is father? I\ndon't believe\u2014Charles in the body\u2014where is my desk in my room ? [Not\nintelligible.] [I do not know what is the significance of this. I did not\nknow the gentleman and but little about him. I afterward learned that the\ndesk is significant, also the beautiful face.*] Phinuit describes a gentleman\nwith a beautiful face, greatly agitated, also a very large gentleman with him\n\u2014he was a great preacher\u2014Phillips\u2014Phillips Brooks. He says : I want to\nsay that when I made mistakes in life, I hope you will do all in your power\nto rectify them. [1 asked if he did not believe in an after-life t] Yes, but\nI did not believe in the possibility of communication after death. [Mrs.\nHoward thought this correct. In Dr. Brooks' sermons, \" New Starts in Life,\"\nVIII., series, recently published, p. i>6, in a sermon written in 1873, he\navows his belief in the possibility.*] [Mrs. Sutton said that she did not\nknow Dr. Brooks, but it appears from her account given to Miss Edmunds,\nthat she had mot him several times, once at a tea with six other persons, but\nhad no special conversation with him. Mrs. Howard notes : \" I knew\nPhillips Brooks from the time I was a girl and had more than one long talk\nwith him.\" It was known to myself and also to Mrs. Howard, that the\nRev. Phillips Brooks had spoken disparagingly of attempts to obtain\ncommunications from the \"deceased\" through Mrs. Piper's trance.\u2014R.H.]\nHere we see its full importance.

To\nobtain it was the object of the communication with the gentleman whose\nnecktie was placed in Mrs. Piper's hand. Nothing intelligible was\nobtained.*] After the writing, we thought the sitting over, and Mr. Sutton\nhad gone across the room, when Kakie's little voice piped up. Want papa\u2014\nwant papa. Bear papa. [Phinuit pats his face.] Do you love me, papa ?\nWant babeo. Sings, Bye, bye\u2014papa, sing\u2014mama sing. Cuddles doll up in\nneck and sings. [An exact imitation marvellously animated and real.*]\nIt may be of interest to note that the day before the sitting, Mr. Sutton\nhad questioned whether it was right or desirable for them to bring them back\nfor our gratification. It did not occur to him during the sitting, but Alonzo\nsaid\u2014\" Do not think it wrong to bring us back\u2014we love to come.\"\nThe \"sitting\" was as a whole very satisfactory.

Report by Mrs. Sutton from notes\ntaken by Mrs. Howard during the sitting.\n[Mrs. Piper was sitting talking with us, not ready to be entranced, when\nshe suddenly put her hand to her head, rose, and moved toward the window.\nBefore reaching it she staggered and would have fallen but that we supported\nher to a chair. For an instant only she seemed lifeless, then as suddenly\nrose full of animation under the control of \"G.

Dr. Phinuit assumed control,\nand I exchanged seats with Mrs. Howard, holding Mrs. Piper's hands. He\nrecognised me cordially and said : Baby wants to see her mamma, come,\ndear. A sweet child voice sang softly,\u2014\nLightly row, lightly row,\nO'er the rippling waves we go.\nSmoothly glide, smoothly glide,\nWith the ebbing tide.\nLet the winds and waters be\nMingled with our melody,\nSing and float, sing and float,\nIn our little boat.\n[The words and tuuo were sung frequently by the child during her\nillness,\u2014the last she sung on earth.]\nMamma sing with Kakie.

I see you are nervous and impatient sometimes when the\naching body is tired out, \u2014but control your nerves, can't you, dear ? that is\nall I want to change in you. I know you try, but it seems as if you ought\nto rise above it. [This is not in the least like her.*]\nPhinuit said : There are many here anxious to speak to you. Here is\nyour father and your mother. They have been here a long time, \u2014your\nmother came 6rst. [Correct.*] They are very bright. They want to tell\nyou to be patient.

Kakie, let me see how\nmany you have. [He counts twelve in French.]\nI exclaimed : Do you have buttons there ?\nHe replied : She had not the button, but she has the idea of them, which\nis the reality. Kakie wants the horse. [I gave him the little horse she\nplayed with during her illness.] No, that is not the one. The big horse\u2014\nso big\u2014[Phinuit shows how large]. Eleanor's horse. Eleanor used to put\nit in Kakie's lap. She loved that horsey. [This horse was packed, in\nTrenton, and had not occurred to me in connection with Kakie. What she\nsaid of it was true.]\n[Kakie asks for her ball. I gave it to Phinuit, who tries to find what she\nwants to do with it.]\nBito it ? Toss it ? Roll it ? Throw it ?\n[No, she wants a string. Mrs. H. gave him a string. He tries to tie it\naround the ball.] [A little red wooden ball with a hole through it. The\nball had a string through it when she used to play with it.*]\nNo, that is not right, through it.\nThere, there, be a good little girl. Don't cry. Don't be impatient, you\nwant your mamma to see how you do it, so she will know it is you, don't\nyou, dear ? Old man will do it for her.\n[He put the string through, held it up, and hit it with the finger, making\nit swing.]\nThat is it, is it not, darling, ! Nice little girl as ever was.\n[While she was sick, it was her great delight to have me hold the string,\nand let her hit the little red ball with her finger or spoon. She made the\nmotions as if doing it, after she became unconscious.]\n[Again I saw her for a moment, (t e. Mrs. Sutton herself saw the\n\"apparition\" of Kakie. See introductory remarks to her sittings p. 484 \u2014\nR. H.) standing at the table, trying to reach a spool of tangled red knitting\nsilk, and at the same moment Phinuit reached for it, saying : ] She wants\nthat, she and Eleanor used to play with. She calls it Eleanor's. She is\ndelighted with it\u2014it brings her nearer her little sister.\n[All true, but I had not connected it with Eleanor in my thought.]\nI gave Phinuit a lock of Eleanor's hair. He felt it a moment and said :\nYou cut that close to the head\u2014that was right. I can see her perfectly\u2014\nlovely little girl. [I had not told him whose hair it was.] She is inclined to\nbe irritable\u2014nervous, 1 mean\u2014nerves are irritable. One of the dearest\nHttle things that ever lived.

Rub her a great deal,\nthat is good for her.\nMrs. Howard asked : Would Christian science help her 1\nWould what I exclaimed Phinuit.\nMental treatment.\nOh, yes, that would be good for her. Keep her in the open air as much\nas possible. Do not let her get tired. Carry her out with something soft at\nher back. She has been very ill. How that poor child has suffered !

[Correct description of a book she was fond of.*] She\nwants Eleanor's hair.\nPhinuit makes the motion of drawing something from it and giving it to\nher, saying : Now she has it. She can get nearer her little sister with it.\n. I gave him a bit of Mr. Sutton's hair, without saying whose it was.\nAs he took it, he said laughing: That is papa's hair, \u2014mighty little of it, was\nnot he stingy of it though ? [When I cut it, Mr. Sutton warned me playfully\nthat ho had not much to spare.] He will live to be a hundred. You need\nnot worry about that. [Mrs. S. has all of a woman's solicitude for a\nperfectly healthy husband.\u2014S. W.

His wife died a year\nbefore him. He left a small insurance which Mr. S. shared.*]\nPhinuit exclaimed : I see you in such a pleasant home ! All the sur\nroundings so pleasant\u2014lovely trees. Mr. Sutton will receive a \" call \" soon\nfrom a good parish, and will accept it. Substantial people\u2014a good work in\na small town near water. [I asked if it was Duxbury.] No, New burgh ?\nNo, not so far from Boston. [I named several places.] I think it ends in\nton\u2014Winchendon sounds like it. I think it is there.

You will be successful\nthere, and it will be a permanent settlement. But before this comes, it\nwill seem very dark, very dark to you. [We came to Athul to a small\nstruggling parish and small salary ! No vestry, or anything of the sort.\nThe church is the usual old New England white church and steeple. It is\non a hill-side. Our house is among pine trees and charmingly situated, but\nthe permanence of the settlement is problematical.*] Here is Kakie with\nUncle Charlie [my brother.] He did not know he was coming. It was very\nsudden. He went to bed with terrible pain in his head, and the next he\nknew he was here. He is so grateful to you that you never doubted him\u2014\nit grieved him that anyone could. How could anyone have thought he\nwould do that? [He was found dead in bed in his twenty-fourth year.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 493\nSome thought he committed suicide.] [A small vial that had contained\nchloroform was found in the room. He had sometimes put it on his head\nwhen in acute pain. The physician who was called said that had it been full\nit was not enough to cause death. He died of valvular disease of the heart.\nHe had been told by two physicians a month before that he was liable to die\nany hour and could not live long.*] He is very happy here. He would not\ncome back for all the world, Phinuit turns his head, as if looking at a\nchild beside me, and says : Yes, I know \"Kakio wants,\" but Kakie must be\npatient, others want to speak to mamma. [She was very persistent with\n\" Kakie wants \" when here.] He loves your children, and they love him.\nHe is with you in all your trouble. Ho sees a brighter future for you\u2014this\nwill not last. . . . You dear little girl, you want to get in mamma's lap,\nand you shall. [Phinuit makes the movement of lifting her into my lap,\nand for a moment I saw her distinctly lying in my arms, with the sweet look\nof demure contentment she used to have when I held her.] Phinuit said :\nYou have a child here who came long ago. He is a beautiful spirit now, he\ndoes not get near enough for me to hear him, but I can see him. And there\nis another little one here, too, they call \"baby,\" not long here, it never\nlived on earth. Mary C has it. She does love that baby so, she and\nHattie.

[This is curious. It was a little prayer-book,\nwith cross, anchor, and other symbols, in silver, attached to ribbons for\nmarking the places. It was sent to me by a dear friend, after Kakie had\nceased to know anyone, except, perhaps, for a passing moment. I read it,\nand so did our physician, in the night watches, when she seemed un\nconscious, and after her death I placed it in her hands to prevent the blood\nsettling in the nails. The last thing she remembered was my placing it in\nher hands ! What does this signify I ] [Mrs. Piper held her hands in just\nthat position when she asked for it.*]\nYou have so many friends here, but you do not need to come here to\nmeet them. They come to you, and you see and hear them. There are\nmany here whom you have helped, and they crowd about you. You have\ndone much good, but you have much more to do. You have many dear ones\nhere\u2014so many. Here is an old gentleman wants to speak to you, Dr.\nClarke. [I saw James Freeman Clarke as he spoke.] He asks if you gave his\nmessage to [name of his daughter*].

Nothing given that\nI had not known that was intelligible.*]\nThis sitting was more satisfactory than the first. It was freer in move\nment, more friends communicated, and there was less agitation.\n[Mrs. Sutton.]\n[It may be worth noting that in these sittings no mention was made of\nthe near death of my grandmother, who always helped me. She lived with\nme, and at her death left me enough to somewhat ease our straitened\ncircumstances.*]\nDecember 7th, 1893.\nSitters : M. Paul Bourget, Mme. Bourget, and part of the time,\nMarie Garin, a servant of Professor W. James, who made the\nappointment for the sitting and at whoso house in Cambridge the\nsitting was held. I understood from Professor James later that the\nsitting was successful as regards Mme. Bourget as well as M. Bourget.\nBut Professor James never received any account from them. On the\nday following the sitting Professor James wrote me the following\naccount of the statements made concerning Marie Garin. (M.\nBourget had another sitting on December 11th, 1893, p. 495).\nCambridge, December 8th, 1893.\nDear Hodgson, \u2014The Piper sitting with the Bourgets yesterday was a\nfairly successful one, though there was much confusion owing to the number\nof clues that were started and could not develop in the 2 hours and 20\nminutes that the trance lasted. ... I have urged B. to send me a\nwritten account. Meanwhile something interesting occurred to my servant\nMarie.\nIn Weir Mitchell's very bad sitting, six weeks or so since [see p. 482],\nthe name \" Marie\" kept coming, and he failed to connect it with any one\nwhom he knew. I thought of our bonne, but said nothing, as I didn't wish\nto confuse M.'s hour. Yesterday the sitting opened with Mme. Bourget\nholding Mrs. P.'s hand, and this same name \" Marie\" and \" I want you to\ntell my sister Marie, in the body, \" kept coming through the hand, mixed\nwith much other matter. At last a name \"Carrie\", or \" iiarie \" came,\nwhich was so like Marie Garin's surname that I got her to come up to see if\nshe were the Marie in question. Immediately she took Mrs. P.'s hand the\nother hand wrote \" Sunstroke. I passed away with sunstroke, I am glad\nto see my dear sister Marie. Tell Mother I am happy. The children are\nwell with her. There has been great confusion but the two children will be\nwell with her, etc.\"\nI don't give the exact words, some of which came through mouth. There\nwere other names and references which Marie couldn't understand. One of\nthese was \"James.\" Mme. Bourget said to Marie \"That's Jacques in\nFrench, have you any Jacques ? \" The hand then wrote Jack Alexandre,\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 495\nJacques Alexandre being the name of an uncle of Marie's who many years\nago came to America and had never been heard from. Louise, Daniel,\nJulie, Eugenie, Charles were mentioned, all being members of Marie's\nimmediate circle, Louise her mother's name. The whole thing very brief.\nNow Marie's brother had had a grave sunstroke shortly before we left\nSwitzerland in August. In September Marie got a letter from hor mother\nsaying he was dead. The mother, Louise, has Marie's' two children with her.\nNo member of this family ever mentioned this to Mrs. P. I mentioned it to\nyou and M., as a good possible test for Mrs. P. before the news had come of\nthe death, but M.'s sitting was otherwise so full that Marie was crowded\nout. Marie herself hardly speaks two words of English, and only knows\ntwo persons in Cambridge, servants who know nothing of Mrs. Piper. She\nis very reticent and says she does not think she has mentioned her brother's\ndeath to these persons, one of whom is a recently arrived Italian servant\nand the other a French Canadian servant of the Miinsterberg's.\nWm. James.\nDecember Uth, 1893.\nI met M. Bourget on the evening of December 10th, and he\nreferred to Mrs. Piper [see record of December 7th, 1893] and\nexpressed the wish to have another sitting. It happened that a person\nfor whom I had arranged a sitting for the next day was unable to be\npresent and I took M. Bourget to the sitting instead. He took an\narticle to the sitting about which Phinuit occasionally made some\ncomments while the writing was going on. I ascertained later from\nProfessor James that some reference had been made at M. Bourget's\nprevious sitting to the lady who had drowned herself. The notes\nitalicised in square brackets were made by M. Bourget himself during\nour return to Boston in the train, and the other confirmatory or non-\nconfirmatory notes were my contemporary notes from statements made\nby M. Bourget. The notes of Phinuit's remarks during the sitting\nwere made by M. Bourget. The record is not adequately annotated.\nI hoped to have made some further inquiries through Mrs. Piper's\ntrance, and I understood from M. Bourget that he would send\nme some articles for experiment so that I might obtain answers if\npossible to his special questions. He did not, however, communicate\nwith me again, and made no reply to my later inquiries. I now\ninsert some additional explanatory remarks in the record, according\nto my remembrance of what M. Bourget told me, signing these\nIt. H. Soon after the sitting began, M. Bourget asked questions,\nfour specially, which he continually repeated, in English. He wished\nto know\n1. The name of the painter who painted the portrait of the lady, a\nportrait which M. and Mme. Bourget had seen on a visit to the lady in\n\f49G [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nquestion when the lady herself however was absent. M. Bourget did\nnot know the name of the painter.\n2. The first name of the lady.\n3. Place where the lady lived.\n4. Place where the lady died.\nSome of the writing is addressed to M. Bourget, some of it to\nmyself and some of it apparently to the would-be communicator, to be\nimagined as talking to G. P.\n[So far as I am aware, the communication purporting to come from\nMrs. Pitman is the first and only one from her through Mrs. Piper.\nPart at least of what she first wrote was apparently addressed to\nPhinuit, \"if you will forgive me for doing as I did by you when I was\nin the body.\" Early in June, 1888, Mrs. Pitman, who was a member\nof the American S P.R., had two sittings with Mrs. Piper. She was on\nthe point of making a trip to Paris, and died in France that year, and\nmy notes of her sittings were not commented upon in detail.\nAt the time, Mrs. Pitman apparently regarded them as failures,\nbut was much impressed before her death at what she believed to be\nthe fulfilment of Phinuit's prophecies. This I ascertained afterwards\nfrom a Boston lady, Miss Josephine Jenkins, who was with Mrs.\nPitman during her last illness. Phinuit said \" You're going to be\nvery sick .... You're going to Paris. Going to be quite sick.\nGoing to have a weak state of organs of stomach. Weak in head.\n. . . Sandy-complexioned gentleman will take care of you when you\nare sick across the ocean.\" As I remember, Phinuit several times\nevaded Mrs. Pitman's question as to her health after this prophesied\nillness, until finally she requested me to get an answer. I urged\nPhinuit to tell us, and he replied \" After she gets over illness she'll get\non all right.\" These quotations are from my original notes made at\nthe sitting. Mrs. Pitman denied that she could have anything the\nmatter with her stomach, and contradicted Phinuit on this and other\nmatters in a way which seemed to annoy Phinuit very much. When\nMrs. Pitman was seriously ill, and was attended by Dr. Herbert\n(described by Miss Jenkins as \"a decided blond\") who treated her for\n\"inflammation of the membrane of the stomach,\" she recalled the\ndetails of her sittings and reflected that she had done Phinuit an\ninjustice, and believed that she would..recover, since Phinuit, she\nthought, had so prophesied. Phinuit's exact words, however, as given\nabove, appear to be somewhat oracular.\nAs I learned from Miss Jenkins, Dr. Charcot in June said that\nMrs. Pitman's trouble was a nervous one and put her under his hydro\npathic treatment. \"At first the baths improved her, but when they\nwere renewed in the autumn she seemed to go all to pieces and her\n\fxxxin.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 497\nmind was affected. A seeming cold after one of these baths developed\ninto this inflammation of the membrane of the stomach, as Dr.\nHerbert said.\" Mrs. Pitman grew worse, and Miss Jenkins finally\nsent for Charcot, who pronounced the trouble to be \" consumption of\nthe spinal cord,\" and said that she could not live. \" This consumption\nof the spinal cord, I forget the technical term, is not a rapid matter,\nand poor Mrs. Pitman had been suffering with it for years.\"\nWhen the \" Mrs. Pitman \" statement came I suggested to M.\nBourget that he should talk in French, as he then did. My impression\nnow is that he continued talking in French till the end of the sitting,\nand that he told me afterwards that his remarks and questions\nappeared to be clearly understood by the \"writer.\" The last two\nwords written followed a spasmodic resumption of the pencil after the\nwriting had apparently come to an end. \u2014 R.

H. present at beginning and end of trance.\nThe following record reached me with a letter of March 29th, 1894.\nOn March 2nd, 1894, a young relative and I went to see Mrs. Piper, a\nBitting having previously been arranged for us by Mr. Hodgson.\nWhen we reached Arlington Heights, accompanied by Mr. Hodgson, who\nkindly went with us, we drove directly to Mrs. Piper's house. We were\nintroduced to the medium, who opened the door to us, as Mrs. Jones and\nMrs. Robinson. We had never seen her before, She struck us agreeably\nat first sight. A naturally refined and womanly woman, and very genuine\nshe seemed to us. After a little desultory conversation she went into a\ntrance and was controlled by Dr. Phinuit. The passing into the trance\nstate was disagreeable to witness. It seemed to me like a person inhaling\nether very unwillingly, and with more or less struggle.\nAs soon as Mrs. Piper was well under the influence of the so-called \"Dr.\nPhinuit,\" Mr. Hodgson left the room, and we had our experience to\nourselves.\nDr. Phinuit turned to my companion and told her accurately the number\nand sex of her children, and described very truly the character of her\ngoverness and nurse, and also gave some advice about one of the children\nwho is rather delicate.\nI had taken a hat-band with me, belonging to a young friend who had\ngone away for his health. This band Mrs. Piper applied to her forehead,\nanil described fully the person to whom it belonged, saying he had a great\ndeal of headache from over study, but rest and a change he was then having\nwould soon set him right.\nA good deal of the time of our sitting was taken up with the effort of a\nfriend to make himself known to us through writing. He had been dead 27\nyears, and it was difficult for this reason, so he said, to communicate.\nMuch of what was imparted to us was too personal to be repeated, but\nnothing was said that was not true. We afterwards, however, came to the\nconclusion that every thing we had been told might be explained by the\ntheory of thought-transference, except one or two predictions that are yet\nto be verified.\nAfter seeing her, we felt no doubt of Mrs. Piper's genuineness.\nM. E. P.\n\f500 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nIn reply to my inquiry, Mrs. P. writes on August 3rd, 1896 :\u2014\n\"In my sitting with Mrs. Piper, March, 1894, she predicted three things\nthat were to come to pass in my life. One has been fulfilled, the other two\nare still to be verified ;\" and on August 10th, she adds: \"The prophecy\nthat was fulfilled was that we should leave our (then) home and settle in the\ncity in a corner house. This has come to pass. The other predictions\nunfulfilled are of a more private nature.\"\nOn March 3rd, 1894 (see p. 505), the first writing that came was as\nfollows [names altered] :\u2014\n\"I am Polly, sir, and I want to see my sister, Alice Dale. You tell my\nsister I am happy. I am with Elsie at all times, also my own [or \"come\"]\nlittle girl. Tell her I am living [?] for her and Will. I often see Alice\nWilkinson . . . yes, sir. [R. H. asks if she will be able to speak with\nthe voice.] Yes, this old gentleman [Phinuit] has told me I could . . .\nthank you, sir [to the sitter who deciphered the word \" could.\"] I shall be\nso happy, sir, thank you ever so much. [Then evidently to Phinuit ] You\nare a dear old fellow and I like you already, sir. [Phinuit says: \"Never\nmind talking to me. You go on, sis.\"] for letting me come in here so\ndearly [?] [Disturbance in the hand, and scrawls] do help me, sir. [Scrawl.]\nUncle Will is so fond of mama he cannot help coming in here to express his\nlove for her, thank you, sir [to the sitter, who deciphered the words \"for\nher \"]. You have light, haven't you, so you see what I say very well, and I\nam very grateful to you for your kind help, assistance . . . do, oh yes,\nI see his father, yes I do, also a lady friend of his. Alice is all right and I\nlove her dearly.\"\nI sent this communication to Mrs. Dale with inquiries as to its\nrelevance, and asked her whether the names had been mentioned at\nthe sitting of March 2nd. She replied on March 5th :\u2014\n\" 'Dale ' and 'Elsie ' may have been casually mentioned at our sitting.\nAlice Wilkinson was not, but the wording of the sentence spoilt what might\nhave been quite a remarkable knowledge of names. It reads, 'lam with\nElsie at all rimes,' and further down the page, 'I often see Alice Wilkinson\/\n' Polly,' who purports to write the communication, was my adopted sister,\nwhose real name was Alice Wilkinson. My last baby is named after her,\nbut is called Elsie, to avoid confusion, as my name is also Alice.\"\nOn March 8th, 1894, another writer (\"Q.\") in the middle of a\ncommunication wrote :\u2014\n\" Here is a dear lady whom I have met who is very anxious to speak one\nword. Her material name is, or was, Polly Watson. She says, do not worry\nabout her she is happy. God knows best. This is all I hear. [It. H. asks\nabout confusion in previous message. W'hy should Polly say she was with\nAlice Wilkinson when Alice Wilkinson was herself? If she is there still,\nask her to explain this ] Yes. Alice Wilkinson and Watson are both is her\nname, but this was not she who wrote it for you but another lady who was\njust coming in, and caught what she said, and I have no doubt she put it\non paper as she heard it. You will understand it.\"\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 501\nAgain, on March 13th, 1894, Phinuit said (whether in reply to a\nquestion of mine or not I do not know, but no question was recorded)\nthat \" Polly began to write her own message, but that Daisy [name of\ndeceased wife of sitter on March 3rd] completed it.\"\nThe next communication was from Mrs. Dale, but whether I sent\nboth the foregoing explanations or not I do not remember. I must\nhave sent her at least one. She was away from home at the time, and\nher letter is dated April 6th, 1894, and was forwarded to me to New\nYork when I was busy interviewing witnesses and supervising a series\nof sittings that Mrs. Piper was giving in that city. She wrote : \" Dr.\nPhinuit has made a delightful mess out of his explanations. You\nmisunderstood my complicated note, and Dr. P. took your version of\nthe affair.\"\nIn going over my documents I found that this letter from Mrs.\nDale was apparently never answered, and I wrote to her recently to\nhave the matter cleared up. My explanation is that probably\n\" Daisy \" was in contact with the writing machine as it were, and\nwas communicating the words thought by \" Polly,\" but also her own\nwords or possibly the words of some other \" intelligence \" present, so\nthat it was either \" Daisy \" who thought the words \" I see Alice\nWilkinson,\" or some other person \u2014possibly \" Q.\"\nMrs. Dale, who is now at a distance, states in a letter received\nAugust 13th, 1896 : \u2014\n\" As you have written out the words and explanation in this letter,\nit all makes sense. I will read it over with you some day and explain it to\nyou. It would be all too long and complicated now. Mrs. Piper is certainly\na most interesting phenomenon, but I do not like to have her brought into\nspiritualistic relations with one. It seems sacrilegious to me, as I do not\nbelieve that such things are any more than mind-readings.\"\nThe names and circumstances referred to in the above com\nmunications were unknown to me.\nMarch 3rd, 1894.\nMr. Charles Heywood, Gardner, Mass. (Associate A.B.S.P.R ).\nR. H. present part of the time.\nMr. Heywood accompanied me for a sitting on March 1st, 1894.\nThere was no speech but apparently strenuous attempts at writing .as\nby different persons. The oddities of spelling and writing were\nprobably Phinuit's. The following is the complete record of the\nwriting of March 1st.\nno light no light here [Spelt backwards and written forwards, on\nthgil, etc.].\n\f-502 [part\nlit chard Hodgson.\nno liht liht [spelt backwards and written forwards] no [written correctly].\nno liht can't stay y yes no liht [Spelt backwards and written forwards].\ncan't stay [spelt forwards and written backwards, i.e. yats time, beginning\nwith the letter c and writing from right to left].\nhere [spelt backwards and written forwards, the h in mirror-writing].\nPhinuit [mirror-writing] followed by a stroke with an r perhaps intended\nfor Dr.\non tighl [or lighl].\ntoo bad [spelt backwards and written forwards] bad dab oot.\nDr. Phinuit [spelt backwards and written forwards, and some of the\nletters mirror-writing].\nAdieu [Spelt backwards and written forwards].\nNo use G.

Adieu G. P.\nMr. Heywood accompanied me again on March 3rd, 1894, and had\na successful sitting. In the afternoon of the same day, he wrote me\nthe following letter: \u2014\nGardner, March 3rd, 1894.\nMy Dear Mr. Hodgson,\u2014After arriving here this afternoon, I took the\nenvelope containing articles belonging to my wife to the room where her\nbelongings are, and requested her to ask Mr. Pelham or Dr. Phinuit to give\nto you from her some further explanation of one or two things in our\ninterview. So I will be obliged to you if you will watch out for anything\nfrom Pelham or Phinuit.\nOn looking over my notes, I find this curious thing :\nD. P. B. : \" Where are those pants !\"\nC. H. : \"Pants?\"\nD. P. B. : \" Yes, those light things. 1 do not like them\u2014too much like\na negro.\"\nC. H. : \"Negro?\"\nD. P. B. : \"Yes.\"\nThe fact is that in the summer of 1891 (the year before my wife died), I\nhad a pair of very light coloured and very loud trousers, which afforded\ninfinite amusement to my wife and myself. I used to call them, in allusion\nto their similarity to the nether garments of coloured gentlemen, my coon\npants !\nWill transcribe and send soon. There are some things which I am much\nin doubt about, as there are various possible readings.\nC. Heywood.\n\fxxxiii.] Observattons of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 503\nConcerning the first paragraph of the ' above letter, the only\nmemoranda which I can find of any special messages concerning\nMr. Heywood are that on March 7th Phinuit said : \"Do you know\nDaisy Bradford ? She's very grateful to you. She isn't here now, but\nshe told me to tell you,\" and on March 10th he said : \"Do you know\nanybody named Heywood? (Yes). There's a lady wants to send her\nlove to him.\"\nThe following documents explain themselves.\nGardner, January 107A, 1895.\nDear Mr. Hodgson,\u2014In fact, it occurs to mu in looking over my papers\nthat I never sent you the promised transcription of the results of my sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper last spring. There are two reasons for this. My interpre\ntation of several obscure passages obtained at the first [second] sitting, which\nI wrote out fully and carefully, were materially modified by communications\nreceived at the second [third] sitting ; and all the writing secured at that-\nsitting, I regret to say, has disappeared, and I am afraid got burned up with\na lot of old newspapers, etc., which a servant hid received orders to destroy.\nAt any rate I can't find any traces of it.\nMuch of the report already written out, therefore, was rendered value\nless, and some of the more striking proofs, or at least coincidences, wore so\nentirely personal as to exclude, for propriety's sake, their appearance in\nprint. There are many things, however, which I can write out for you, and\nthis I will do gladly if you desire.\nPhinuit made some remarkable prophecies at my last sitting. The minor\npredictions, many of them, were fulfilled, and I naturally expected a corres\nponding realisation of the two great predictions up to which the lesser led ;\nbut the Doctor evidently took too much for granted. The big things failed\nto occur. If Mrs. P. is still giving sittings please remember me to Phinuit,\nand ask him if he ever sees Daisy Bradford or Charles Heywood. You were\nobliged to interrupt my last sitting at the critical point when the intelligence\npurporting to be that of C. H. (my father) was about to say something which\nhe considered of very great importance, and of vital interest to me. I have\nalways wanted to get hold of him again.\u2014Truly yours,\nCharles Heywood.\nGardner, February 10th, 1896.\nDear Sir,\u2014After writing my letter of last week, I made a strict search\namong my papers in an endeavour to find the MSS. obtained upon the\noccasion of my second visit to Mrs. Piper (the first visit which afforded\nsatisfactory results).\nBut I was unable to find them, and learning from a friend of the family\nthat my mother had had them in her possession a short time before her\ndeath, I came to the conclusion that they could be found, if at all, among\nher papers.\nI dismissed the subject from my mind for the time. But last night,\nhaving occasion to open my mother's safe, my brother-in-law and I found\ntherein, not only the original writings, but my transcription and supple\nmentary dialogue, made within a week after the sitting, together with some\n\f504 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nadditional comments in my handwriting, the existence of which had entirely\nescaped my memory. In fact, I hadn't seen the transcription itself for a\nvery long time, and I couldn't have sworn to its existence, nor whether, in\nfact, an entire transcription had been made.\n******\nOf course any attempt at this late day to construct a dialogue from the\n.automatic writings would be almost valueless, but the selections which I send\nyou are from the aforesaid transcript made within a very short time of the\nsitting. I send all which I can positively submit to strange eyes, and I beg\nto assure you that what is omitted is of a character which exhibits startling\ninternal evidences of being communicated by the personality of my dead wife.\nAs I have said, the notes of the second (really the third) seance are lost,\nbut from the memoranda concerning it found last night, and from my\nmemory of its salient points, I am enabled to give some interesting informs-\ntion about it. . . .-Sincerely yours, Charlus Heywood.\nGardner, Mass., February 10th, 1896.\nSome Notes upon Automatic Writing obtained through Mrs. Piper.\nI have had three sittings with Mrs. Piper. The first was unproductive.\nPhinuit said there was not enough \"light.\" The second Listed about one\nhour and a quarter, and was devoted wholly to automatic writing. Phinuit\nwas very quiet, and \"George Pelham \" seemed to be the controlling and\ndirecting intelligence. Of course, nearly all the writing was done by the\n\" D. P. B.\" intelligence, but Pelham seemed to supervise, and at times took\nthe pencil himself and assured me that he was looking after things.\n\"D.P.B.\" spoke of Pelham as standing within \"earshot,\" if such a term\nmay be used.\nThe third sitting occupied one hour, and was divided between some\n\" psychometry \" by Phinuit, and writing by \"D.P.B.\" and an intelligence\nsaid by \"D.P.B.\" and by himself to be the spirit of my father (died 1882).\nThe writing obtained at this time cannot be found, but from the memoranda\nin my possession I can say that the results were in most respects eminently\nsatisfactory. \"D.P.B.\" gave an eminently satisfactory explanation of the\n\" Haskins\" matter [see p. 505] ; while my father brought along the spirit of\nAmos Morrill (died 1891) with whom he had been in business relations for\nmany years, and they gave me some exceedingly good business advice, and\nmade one or two predictions, in a general way, which have been fulfilled.\nPhinuit's readings from locks of hair, gloves, etc., pressed against Mrs.\nPiper's forehead, were excellent so far as they related to the character of the\npersons and their circumstances, but. his predictions were simply my own\nideas of the probabilities, and in almost every instance have failed.\nFrom my minutes made shortly after the first [second] sitting I quote :\u2014\n\"The intelligence which controlled Mrs. Piper's hand, whatever it was,\npossessed or had acquired an intimate knowledge of my married life, and an\nintimate acquaintance with the little mannerisms and more superficial\ncharacteristics of my late wife.\"\n******\n\"Favourite expressions often used by her, i.e., 'Don't be stupid!'\n'Now you are waking up!' 'Well, I should say 1 had!' 'Don't I?'\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 505\n'Well I guess!' 'Dear,' and particularly 'Dear little boy,' Mowed from\nthe pencil in such a familiar way that I felt the influence of her personality\nvery strongly. Some little traits were shown in the impatient brushing\naway of loose articles upon the table, and the pounding of the table with\nthe fingers when perplexed.\" When I saw that motion I exclaimed : \" Ah !\nnow I recognise you beyond a doubt ! \" Little things like that seemed to\n-supply the missing links in the chain of identity.\nIn closing I wish to mention one fact which struck me at the time as\nvery awe-ful and impressive. On one occasion the point of the pencil was\nbroken suddenly, and the hand turned the point up in precisely the fashion\nit would be turned up for the inspection of one standing just at the medium's\nshoulder. My sensation at the moment was that it was as if some person\nbehind the medium had slipped his arm through the medium's sleeve, and\n,was in this manner writing. xx\nh Charles Heywood.\n[From the Automatic Writing at Sitling of March 3rd, 1894.]\nD. : Charlie, I am Dorothy [a pet name of my wife] C-h-a-r-l-i-e, this is\nto you.

She had intended to tell me the matter, and about a\nmonth before her death had started to do so, but something had turned the\nconversation. The whole alt'air was so trivial (although very personal) and\nso natural a solution of the difficulty that I have often wondered at my\nblindness, and laughed at the ridiculous answers which I hatched out in the\ninterval between the two sittings.\nIn attempting to explain the matter at her first sitting, she referred me\nby name to a person who might readily have given me the needed informa\ntion, but I felt unwilling to discuss the matter.]\nC.

Phinuit said : \" Yes, but\nhe is not coming to stay,\u2014he is guarded by a great spirit.\" The baby was\nborn a couple of weeks later, and died suddenly this morning.\nI have not the papers here but I think my recollection is correct.

[Correct,\u2014about two years previous.]\nPh. : David is here and sends love to his father in the body. [David has\nsent love to his father at previous sittings. His father was his only near\nrelative living. David not living.]\nPh. : Oh ! the baby has had the measles ! [One child, not the baby\u2014\nhad just had the measles.]\n[The hand, after manipulation, began to write, after letters from J.D.S.\nhad been bound around wrist.]\nYes, thank you very much, I have it all right now. Oh, where am I,\nsir ? Will you stay with me and help me ? I wish to speak to my friend on\nearth.\nOh, how are you ? I am so glad to see you. My name is David [possibly\nDuane.] You dear old John.

Yes, indeed, I can.\n(Does it trouble you when we are sad?) No, for I can see how things\nare going to terminate. (Are they going well with us ?) Indeed they will,\nand the worst is over.

(Which chair ?) My reclining chair. [Sitters did not remember\nany particular chair.]\n(Have you anything to say about the disposition of your things ?) Not\nthat I care. Let them do as they wish. I don't care a fig. [Characteristic\nphrase of Duane, who is J.D.S.]\n(Will Mrs. M. go to Europe ?) Very soon, in June.\n(No, she has given up her trip.)

Do you know, when I left the body that P.M.\u2014\nnot P. but A., I intended to say A.M. [A.M. correct.] I saw a light, and\nthen I saw father (Saw your father ?) farther into this world than I at first\nthought I should. Then Alice [his wife, who had died five years before]\nheld out her hands, and told me I was all right. Then I took her hand,\ndear Alice, and we went together. Then I found the baby.

(The\none who was here when you first came ?) Yes, I think he will interpret this\nfor me. Oh ! do. [Mr. C. went to call Mr. H., and meanwhile Mrs. H.\naddressed the hand.]\nYour dear little one's well ? (Yes, we miss you very much, but cannot\nwish you back.) Do you ? Well, I am better off. [Mr. H. returned, inter\npreted writing and said] (I will know you another time, and if you wish to\nsend a message to your friend, I can take it.) Thank you, sir. Do you\nknow J.C.

Adieu, from D-U-, etc.\nPh. then said that some tie prevented him\u2014J.D.S.\u2014from leaving,\nwhich recalled to sitters the letters bound around the wrist ; after their\nremoval, the hand was quiet.\nPh. began to talk to Mrs. H., but soon said, \" Who is this little gentle\nman who passed out of the body with consumption ? He speaks so hoarse I\ncan hardly hear him. He wants to say something to his friend.\" Mr. C.\nthen came forward, and Ph. said : \"This gentleman wants to tell you about\nsome papers in that little piece of furniture in the corner (the escritoire ?)\nYes, that's it. There are some Papers of his about some land he owns.\"\nMr. C. : At C. ?\nPh. : No, not there.\nMr. C. : At Round Island ?\nPh. : Yes, that is it ; and he wants to tell you about some things of his.\nIt is hard for :ne to understand. If you can get him to use the hand, you\ncan get the messages more direct. They often get confused, coming through\nme.\nThen followed directions as to the whereabouts of a cane [which was not\nfound where it was said to be], a jug with a handle, and other things, which\nPh. said were safely put away, and that no one had taken.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 517\nMr. C. asked about some cut-glass dishes, but Ph. said he heard nothing\nabout them.\nSome prophecies were made about A.P.H., and it was stated that a lady,\nE. P., had recently changed her surroundings entirely, and felt that it was\nthe best thing she had ever done. [In fact, the lady had really gone to\nEurope for the first time in her life, within a month before date of sitting.]\nMr. Hodgson then sent Ph. away, and Mrs. Piper came out of trance\nabout 11.45.\nNew York, April 9th, 1894.\nApril 10, 1894. On this date, at the beginning of a sitting with persons\nunknown to Mr. C. and Mrs. H., the hand wrote : \"Duane Scott, where is\nJohn ? John, are you there, dear? If so, speak.\"\nMr. Hodgson then explained that others were sitting, and that he must\ngo away. \"Oh, I'll go. Too bad, sir. He asked me to come in and finish\nmy statements. Why did he ask this of me ? Why did he not explain 1\nYou see, I don't know this\u2014too bad. I'll go then. Good evening, sir.\nDuane (?) S.\"\nApril 25th, 1\u00ab94.\nSitter: James Mitchell (Associate A.B.S.P.R.), at house of Dr.\nAnna Lukens, New York. R. H. taking notes.\nIt was on the morning of this day that Mrs. Piper lost conscious\nness momentarily while sitting with some persons who were trying\nexperiments in crystal gazing and automatic writing. (See p. 344.)\nIt was probably owing to this that there was a lack of available energy\nfor the trance in the afternoon. Several different writers apparently\nseized the hand in quick succession at the beginning of the sitting, and\nI inserted interrogatively what I conjectured to be the names of these\nwriters, the brief messages being directly pertinent.\n[Sitting arranged for soon after 3.30 p.m. Mrs. Piper tries several times\nvainly to go into trance. Finally goes into trance about 6 p.m. Apparently\nvain attempt to speak.

Various other statements\nwere made, and names and localities were mentioned. I caused inquiries\n\f518 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nto be made about what was said (and also about some further statements\nmade at later sittings), but could find no trace of anything correct. After\nthis came the following writing purporting to be by the wife of the sitter.]\nMit Mitel\u2014I am she . . . where is my son ? ... do give me\nstrength . . . oh, yes, indeed, I do, dear, do you miss me 'I . . .

This was Mr. Mitchell's second sitting. (First sitting April\n25th, 1894. See p. 517.) R. H. taking notes.\n[Phinuit.] You're not the strongest man in the country. Blood very\npoor, vitality weak, not very much of it, nerves not very strong. You'll\nhave to take care of yourself, if you want to stay long in the body. Take\nexercise and open air, etc. I don't tell you this for idle talk, there's a great\ndeal of meaning in what I say.\nDo you take milk ? (Yes, some.) Don't take it, it sours in the stomach.\nNot very good for you. Take a glass of lemonade, hot or cold, better than\nmilk.\n(Wine ?) I shouldn't advise you to take much wine\u2014not very good for\nyou. Take acid wine instead of sweet. There's a little catarrh in your\n\f520 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nstomach, and its all through your system. Right down through the mem\nbrane, and right through stomach and bowels. You don't want to take milk.\nYou sometimes have bad taste in the mouth in the morning. Rinse your\nmouth out with warm water, and take glass of hot water.\nTake a tepid sponge bath. Rub yourself\u2014friction with coarse towel.\nDon't think too much. You worry, too.\n(1) There's a voice I hear as plainly as you would a bell ring, and she\nsays: \" That's right, doctor, tell him not to worry, because he always did\nso\u2014my dear husband\u2014I want him to enjoy his remaining days in the body.\nTell him I'm Margaret Mitchell and I will be with him to the ends of\neternity, spiritually.\"\n**\u2666**\u2666\nDo you know a gentleman named Adams ? (In the spirit ?) Yes, he used\nto know you years ago and your father before you.\n(2) Do you remember a funny little house with low-pitched roof, door in\ncentre, room on each side, and unfinished room at the end ? It had a long\nwalk\u2014a little pointed path all about it. (Beds 1 flower-beds ?) a blossoming\nshrub in the corner. A gateway entrance on the side.

H. apparently] You are not my husband, sir.\nOh, you are here, aren't you, dear ? I see you now. I want to tell you\nhow and where I am. How is Edith getting on ?

S. Shaler, at the house of Professor\nW. James. The sitting was arranged for by Professor James, who was\nalso present taking notes. I quote the account of the sitting given by\nProfessor Shaler (of Harvard,\u2014the well-known geologist), in a letter to\nProfessor James.\nCambridge, June 6lh, [1894.]\nMy Dear James,\u2014At the sitting with Mrs. Piper on May 25th, I made\nthe following notes :\u2014\nAs you remember, I came to the meeting with my wife ; when Mrs.\nPiper entered the trance state, Mrs. Shaler took her hand. After a few\nirrelevant words, my wife handed Mrs. Piper an engraved seal, which she\nknew, though I did not, had belonged to her brother, a gentleman from\nRichmond, Virginia, who died about a year ago. At once Mrs. Piper began\nto make statements clearly relating to the deceased, and in the course of the\nfollowing hour she showed a somewhat intimate acquaintance with his\naffairs, those of his immediate family, and those of the family in Hartford,\nConn., with which the Richmond family had had close social relations. The\nstatements made by Mrs. Piper, in my opinion, entirely exclude the\nhypothesis that they were the results of conjectures, directed by the answers\nmade by my wife. I took no part in the questioning, but observed very\nclosely all that was done.\nOn the supposition that the medium had made very careful preparation\nfor her sittings in Cambridge, it would have been possible for her to have\ngathered all the information which she rendered by means of agents in the\ntwo cities, though I must confess that it would have been rather difficult to\nhave done the work.\nThe only distinctly suspicious features were that certain familiar\nbaptismal names were properly given, while those of an unusual sort could\nnot be extracted, and also that one or two names were given correctly as\nregards the ceremony of baptism or the directory, but utterly wrong from\nthe point of view of family usage. Thus the name of a sister-in-law of mine,\na sister of my wife's, was given as Jane, which is true by the record, but in\nforty years experience of an intimate sort I never knew her to be called\nJane, in fact I did not at first recognise who was meant.\nWhile I am disposed to hold to the hypothesis that the performance is one\nthat is founded on some kind of deceit, I must confess that close observation\nof the medium made on me the impression that she is honest. Seeing her\nunder any other conditions, I should not hesitate to trust my instinctive\nsense as to the truthfulness of the woman.\nI venture also to note, though with some hesitancy, the fact that the\nghost of the ancient Frenchman who never existed, but who purports to\ncontrol Mrs. Piper, though he speaks with a first-rate stage French accent,\ndoes not, so far as I can find, make the characteristic blunders in the order\nof his English words which we find in actual life. Whatever the medium is,\nI am convinced that this \"influenco\" is a preposterous scoundrel.\nI think I did not put strongly enough the peculiar kind of knowledge\nwhich the medium seems to have concerning my wife's brother's affairs.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 525\nCertain of the facts, as for instance, those relating to the failure to find his\nwill after his sudden death, were very neatly and dramatically rendered.\nThey had the real life quality. So, too, the name of a man who was to have\nmarried my wife's brother's daughter, but who died a month before the time\nfixed for the wedding, was correctly given, both as regards surname and\nChristian name, though the Christian name was not remembered by my wife\nor me.\nI cannot determine how probable it is that the medium, knowing she was\nto have a sitting with you in Cambridge, or rather a number of them, took\npains to prepare for the tests by carefully working up the family history of\nseveral of your friends. If she had done this for thirty or so persons, I think\nshe could, though with some difficulty, have gained just the kind of\nknowledge which she rendered. She would probably have forgotton that my\nwife's brother's given name was Legh, and that of his mother Gabriella,\nwhile she remembered that of Mary and Charles, and also that of a son in\nCambridge, who is called Waller. So, too, the fact that all trouble on\naccount of the missing will was within a fortnight after the death of Mr.\nPage cleared away by the action of the children was unknown. The deceased\nis represented as still troubled, though he purported to see just what was\ngoing on in his family.\nI have given you a mixture of observations and criticisms ; let me say\nthat I have no firm mind about the matter. I am curiously and yet absolutely\nuninterested in it for the reason that I don't see how I can exclude the\nhypothesis of fraud, and until that can be excluded, no advance can be made.\nWhen I took the medium's hand, I had my usual experience with them,\na few preposterous compliments concerning the clearness of my under\nstanding, and nothing more.\u2014Faithfully yours,\nN. S. Shalee.\nMay 26<A and 29<A, 1894.\nSitter : Professor C. E. Norton, of Harvard, at the house of\nProfessor W. James. Appointment made by Professor James, who\nwas also present most of the time. R. H. also present. The sitting\non May 29th was very short ; there was apparently very little\n\" energy,\" not enough for the use of the voice, and the writing was\nvery incoherent. On May 26th also the writing was more incoherent\nthan usual. G. P. wrote most of the time and referred to Professor\nNorton by name. The most important incident had reference to an\ninquiry made by Professor Norton which (as was quite obvious to me\nat the time and must have been quite obvious to G. P. living and in\nfull consciousness) concerned a prize essay on Jane Austen, which\nG. P. had gained at Harvard. But G. P. communicating did not\ngive the name of Jane Austen. Professor Norton has made the\nfollowing statement :\u2014\nAshfield, Mass., September 1st, 1896.\nDear Mr. Hodgson,\u2014Dr. James asks me to write to you twenty lines\ngiving my impression of the two sittings with Mrs. Piper which I had at\n2 m 2\n\f526 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nhis house some two years ago. You may recall that the sittings were not\nregarded as altogether satisfactory. I made no memoranda of them at the\ntime, and, after such an interval, any account which I might give of the\nsittings would be open to question.\nI can only give you a statement of certain general conclusions to which I\ncame at the time.\nFirst, that there was no question as to Mrs. Piper's good faith, or as to\nher delusion in respect to the nature of the influences to which she was\nsubject when in the trance state.\nHer conditions seemed to me analogous to those of an ill person dreaming\na suggested dream, in which trains of dream to which the dreamer has been\naccustomed are modified by the special conditions of the moment.\nThere was no indubitable evidence of mind-reading, but there were some\nevidences of imperfect thought-transference.\nThere was no evidence of acquaintance with any facts known only to\nmyself, or which were remote and obscure.\nBut there was enough that indicated a peculiar influence upon tho medium\nto interest me greatly in the sittings, and I should not have regretted a\nfurther opportunity of trial of Mrs. Piper's, I will not say powers, but\nconditions when in a trance.\nAs to the origin of many of the phantasmagorias of her trance dreams, I\nformed a very distinct opinion, but many experiments would be required to\ntest its correctness, and these I shall never make.\nI am not sure that what I have written is to your purpose. If not, and\nyou will be so good as to put to me the questions which you wish to have\nanswered, I shall be glad to answer them to the best of my power.\u2014I am,\nvery truly yours,\nC. E. Norton.\nJune 1st, 1894.\nSitter : Professor J. Trowbridge, of Harvard, at house of Professor\nW. James. Appointment made by Professor James. R. H. present.\nProfessor James taking notes. Professor Trowbridge made the\nfollowing statement in a letter to Professor James :\u2014\nCambridge, June 7th, 1894.\nDear James,\u2014I took to the sitting an Indian handkerchief, brought\nfrom India by Captain Thayer, a brother of Mrs. Trowbridge, who died\nabout a month ago. He brought it from India in 1859. It has never been\nout of Mrs. Trowbridge's hands, and has been worn by her constantly.\nI can only give you my general impressions, which, of course, are those\nof an untrained observer in the region in question.\nI was struck by a sort of insane cunning in the groping of the woman\nafter something intangible.\nIt did not seem to me that she simulated a trance state. She was\napparently, as far as I could judge, in some abnormal condition.\nI could not discover that she hit upon anything that was connected with\nthe handkerchief. . . .\nJohn Trowbridge.\n\fxxxin.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 527\nJune 11th, 1894.\nSitter : Dr. F. H. K., Illinois. Alone. Appointment made by R. H.\nDr. K. afterwards became an Associate A.B.S.P.R., but was a stranger\nto me before the sitting. He called at my office as a stranger, and as\nI happened to have a \"sitting\" day vacant just afterwards I told him\nthat he might take the appointment. His account follows :\u2014\nThe Quincy House, Boston, [June IZth, 1894.]\nOn Tuesday, June 12th, '94, through the courtesy of Dr. R. Hodgson, I\nenjoyed the opportunity of a sitting with Mrs. Piper. The communications\nwere almost entirely in writing, and at times were somewhat illegible, but\nduring the better part of the interview were quite satisfactory.\nDuring the first third part of the sitting, several names came, all of which\nwere those of strangers to me. The communications to which these names\nwere signed were irrelevant and upon matters unknown to the writer. After\nthese names appeared the personality of the control seemed to change, and\nfrom that time through the remainder of the sitting the control purported to\nbe my late wife, and the name by which I knew her was frequently written.\nThe messages were in the main very coherent, and corroborated some\nmessages I had received prior to this in another city. Reference was made\ndirectly to these messages by the medium. Most of the messages were of a\nprivate and personal character, but still a few hints may be worthy of record.\nI was asked as to the disposition of my wife's watch, and upon my reply that\nI intended giving it to her namesake, the name of the little namesake was\nat once written and a minute later the name of the child's mother. Upon\nenquiry as to the relationship between these two names, it was correctly\nstated that the little girl was the daughter of the C, whose name had been\ngiven. Reference was made as to the location and character of the disease\nfrom which my wife died in correct terms. Many statements were made as\nto private matters which can only be verified or disproved at a later date.\nI had been introduced to the medium under an assumed name and my true\nname had not been mentioned. At the close of the interview I asked for\nthe signature in full of the control, and at once the three initials of the name\nof my wife were correctly given. I asked for the surname, and the maiden\nname of my late wife was at once written\u2014a name which has the same initial\nletter as my own name. I then asked for the married name, and at once\nreceived it correctly spelled.\nI will add that I am an entire stranger in Boston and some of these\nnames could be known to no one hero but myself. After the control ceased\nto write, another control of the medium, Dr. Phinuit, told me that a little\nboy, a living relative of mine, had sustained an injury to an elbow or wrist,\nbut he was doing well at the time. This was correct, for a nephew of mine\nhad sustained a fracture of the arm a few days previously, a fact which had\nnot been mentioned by me to anyone.\nDuring the latter part of the interview, the impression produced by\nfrequent allusions to private matters and the character of the messages\nthemselves gave rise to a very strong conviction that the control was what\nit purported to be, that of my late wife.\u2014Very respectfully, g_\n\f528 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nTo Miss Edmunds, at a sitting on June 13th, 1894, was said : \u2014\n[Phinuit] Do you know Etta? (No.) She wants to send hor love to her\nhusband in the body.\nTo 11. H. on June 14th, 1894, was said concerning Dr. K. :\u2014\n[Phinuit.]\nTell him that she will prove the test to him that was private to him. She\nwill do what she said she would. She won't let me tell you what it is, but\nhe will tell you afterwards. \u2014G-O-O-D\u2014He'll know what that means.\nI sent these statements to Dr. K., who replied as follows :\u2014\nLondon, July 20th, 1894.\nDr. Richard Hoimsson,\u2014Dear Sir,\u2014Your very kind letter of June 29th\ngiving me the messages from \" Etta \" which came after my visit to Mrs.\nPiper was received here this morning. . . . They are perfectly\nintelligible to me, as I can explain to you at some future time as she said.\nWith reference to the writing of June 12th one matter concerning which\nthere was a positive statement which I could only verify in New York after I\nleft Boston, I found to be exactly as she stated it would be. I cannot go\nfurther into particulars at present, but will at some future time. . . .\nF. H. K.\nDr. K. had another sitting with Mrs. Piper about a year later, on\nhis way home, I understand, after a trip in Europe. On May 16th,\n1896, he made the following statement in the course of a letter in\nreply to my inquiry on another matter.\nI am tempted to give you a little incident connected with my last visit to\nMrs. Piper, which was only verified when I reached my home. I received\nfrom Mrs. P. a few words of communication from some one who claimed to\nbo my Uncle G., recently deceased. I had an uncle with that initial who\nhad died a short time before. Among other things said was \" Give my lore to\nL. and tell her I sec the trouble with her eyes.\" L. is the initial of my uncle's\nwidow. As you remember I had but just returned from a year's trip abroad,\nand I knew nothing about my Aunt L., and of course did not understand the\nmessage. Later, when I reached my home, I found out that my aunt had\nbeen for some little time under treatment for some trouble with her eyes.\nDecember 13th, 1894.\nSitters : Professor J. Estlin Carpenter, of Oxford, and Mrs.\nCarpenter, at the house of Professor James, by whom the sitting was\narranged, and who was present till Phinuit had said a few words,\nwhen his place as recorder was taken by Professor Edward Cummings,\nof Harvard, who, Professor James informs me, had had two sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper some years previously \" with success.\" Professor\nJames adds :\u2014\n\" Mrs. James and Mrs. Piper were in the same room when Professor\nJ. Estlin Carpenter of Oxford entered. He was introduced as Mr. Smith\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 529\nto Mrs. Piper, and withdrew, speaking to her, to the end of the room.\nHis wife then entered and was greeted by Mrs James inadvertently as\n' Mrs. Carpenter,' which of course annuls the best test of this sitting.\"\nThe following is the statement by Professor Carpenter :\u2014\nCambridge, December 14th, 1894.\nDear Professor James,\u2014I had a sitting yesterday with Mrs. Piper at\nyour house, and was greatly interested with the results obtained, as they were\nentirely unexpected by me. Various persons were named and described\nwhom we could not identify (my wife was present) ; but the names of my\nfather and mother were correctly given, with several details which were in\nno way present to my mind at the time. The illness from which my father\nwas suffering at the time of his death was identified, but not the accident\nwhich took him from us. A penknife which I happened to have with me\nwas rightly referred to its place on the desk in his study ; and after\nconsiderable hesitation Mrs. Piper wrote out the word organ when I asked\nconcerning other objects in the room. She added spontaneously a very\nremarkable item about which I was in no way thinking, viz., that on Sunday\nafternoons or evenings (her phrase was \"twilight\") we were accustomed to\nsing there together. She stated correctly that my mother was older than my\nfat her but died after him ; and she connected her death with my return from\nSwitzerland in a manner that wholly surprised me ; the fact being that her last\nillness began two or three days after my arrival at home from Lucerne. She\ngave the initials of my wife's name rightly, and addressed words to her from\nher father, whose first name George was correct. She also desired me in my\nfather's name not to be anxious about some family matters (which have only\nrecently come to my knowledge), though their nature was not specified.\nFinally, though I should have mentioned this first, as it was at the outset of\nthe interview, she told me that I was about to start on a voyage, and\ndescribed the vessel in general terms, though she could not give me its name,\nor tell mo the place where it was going. I saw enough to convince me that\nMrs. Piper possesses some very extraordinary powers, but I have no theory\nat all as to their nature or mode of exercise.\u2014Believe me, faithfully yours,\nJ. Estlin Carpenter.\nFebruary 10th, 1895.\nSitter : Mr. W. B. C, alone. Appointment made by R. H. Mr.\nC. sent the following account with subjoined table. I believe that I\nwas unaware of any of the facts referred to at his sitting except his\nconnection with music.\nJune 2\\st, 1895.\nMy Dear Mr. Hodcson,\u2014 . . . Mrs. Piper's manner of entering\nthe trance was in no way different from what your descriptions led me to\nexpect.\nThere was physical contact during the whole sitting, the weight of the\nupper part of her body being supported through her forehead resting on the\nback of my wrist and hand.\n\f530 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nI endeavoured to keep track of the statements which were not correct\nequally with those which were, but I am quite aware of the difficulty of so\ndoing, and that nothing short of a stenographic report would be trustworthy\nin that respect. In cases where there was an unmistakable element of\ntruth I found my mind constantly tending to overvalue the amount of the\ntruth and to fit in or ignore the incorrect to an alarming degree. The value\ntherefore of my conclusions is limited by my personal equation of self-control\nof which I can naturally not be a judge.\nI have endeavoured to divide the statements made by Mrs. Piper into\nseveral headings, for a description of which I will refer you to the subjoined\nlittle table. I have numbered the items and have commented on them\nfollowing the table.\nI may say at once that the thesis, which this sitting tended to support, is\nthat she was in condition to be able to draw upon my unconscious memory\nwith limitations which I had not evidence enough to define. The effort to\nwill a particular vividness of remembrance seemed of no avail whatever in\nassisting her, and was possibly even an impediment to the ease of her\ndemonstrations.\nBefore going to Mrs. Piper I had no knowledge that anyone else held the\nsame view in regard to her. It came to me before speaking to any one about\nthe sitting as the result of that sitting and was reinforced by many small\npoints which I could only describe at great length if at all. I have given a\nfew below.\nI should say further that though some months previously a separation\nfrom a most valued friend, a man, under the most painful circumstances,\nand the death of a very near relative had taken place, it was not with the\nslightest idea of hearing anything from them that I went to Mrs. Piper. I\ndid not then believe nor do I now see any re>ison for believing anything\nprophetic or supernatural in anything Mrs. Piper accomplishes.\nFrom all possible evidence, for which in fact you can best vouch, Mrs.\nPiper never saw or knew of me or my name.\nSome of the items in the table are marked H to indicate those which it\nwas within possibility that you should have known and informed Mrs. Piper\nabout. I leav e you to make such statements in that respect as you see fit.\nReferring to the table I will now take up some of the statements.\n1. Immediately on going into the trance Mrs. Piper spoke of my being\nsurrounded by music, sheets of music. I have placed this in the column\n\"Could have Been Observed\" because before the trance began I went to a\npiano standing in the room, remarked upon your having spoken of her\ndaughter's studying music and asked leave to look at the title of the piece\non the rack. The composer was Hunter, who writes for children and\nstudents. I carelessly enough showed my familiarity with him which would\nhave been sufficient to show that I had done something, even much, with\nmusic, which has always been the case.\n2-7. Next followed a torrent in regard to the difficulty with the friend of\nwhom I have spoken above. The chief assertions (such as that there was a\ndifficulty with a friend, misunderstanding, life broken up, would all come\nright, etc., etc.) I have divided into six points, three of which might have\nbeen the stock guessing of a fortune teller in a similar case, but the other\n\fxxxiii ] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 531\nthree were certainly more remarkable. I do not give details as they are too\npersonal, and because I found in this part of the sitting nothing to put into\nthe column (the last two) bearing most strongly on the general thesis, except\nthat they raise the average of correctness and were perhaps a little more\nthan could havo been expected in concord and proportion with the weight of\nthis matter on my mind over all others. A photograph of this person was\ntouched by Mrs. Piper according to her custom, but no name or writing.\nShe gave immediately and correctly, however, the first initial of his name,\nwhich is, it should be remarked, one of the most common in the English\nlanguage. But she could only complete the name with difficulty. This\nrather curiously coincides with the fact that none but his intimates ever\nknew and none at all used his first name, as he always signed with the first\ninitial, full middle, and full last names. The name by which he was\ncommonly known was his middle one and that Mrs. Piper failed wholly\nto give.\n8. A first name imperfectly pronounced in Mrs. Piper's French accent\nwas then given of the only person who knew the circumstances of the above.\nIt was not till several days after that I recognized from my notes and\ndescription the person and connection, which were then unmistakable, a\ncircumstance which easily places this mention in the column marked\n\"Remarkable\" from the point of view of connection with my unconscious\nmemory.\n9. In response to the question as to the health of the person referred to\nin 2-7, he was said to have a cold and to be at home lying on a couch with\nhis throat bandaged. He did have a cold at the time but was on no day\nabsent from his business.\n10. The next statement, most suddenly and disconnectedly made, was in\nregard to pictures, both pictures and sketches, which she saw about in great\nnumbers. She insisted on this several times, while, my mind being intent\non the person previously spoken of, I could see no connection whatever.\nAsking her for a description, she began to describe my sister, a step-sister,\nwho had died a few months before and whose whole life was bound up in\npainting. [11] The fairly correct physical description had gone but a little\nway when she seemed to be seized with an extreme pain most alarming to\nme, as it did not seem possibly a part of her trance. The pain was in a part\nof the body where a surgical operation had been performed of which my\nsister immediately died.\n[24] Mrs. Piper then took to writing as under control of my sister and\nafter a few sentences wrote the complete signature, first name, middle\ninitial, and last name of my sister. Mrs. Piper had had in touch a letter\nfrom my sister, and I afterwards supposed she had somehow seen the last\nname signed to that and I knew she had mentioned the abbreviated form of\nthe first name. But on referring to the letter still later it was only signed\nby initials, and the full name was nowhere mentioned in it nor had been by\nme during the sitting. I should call your attention to the fact that as this\nsister was a step-sister her last name was different from mine.\n12. During the writing very insistent mention was made in regard to a\nring which she wanted taken from its then resting place and given to her\n\f.532 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nmost intimate friend, M. In answer to my questions the ring was described\nas containing a small diamond and as kept in a small box in a writing-desk\nupstairs as distinguished from one downstairs. On investigating this\nquestion afterwards I found that there was such a ring but that it contained\ntwo other stones, one each side of the diamond, that it was kept in a small\nbox in a chest of drawers upstairs at the home of a sister who lives iu a\ndistant city, and that, as a singular coincidence, it had been taken from there\nfor the first time in many months on that very date, February 10th, and\nplaced in a writing-desk. I see no value in any of this part, especially as\nthe family speak of there being another ring also, about which I can get no\ninformation as yet.\n13. The assertion was made that at the moment she spoke of it, 11.53\na.m., a person, G. M. L., was at home writing a letter at his desk. From\nthe best information afterwards obtainable there were two short periods\nduring that day when he could have written. During one of them he had\nwritten a note, and one of these periods corresponded with the one during\nwhich I was with Mrs. Piper.\n14. The death of this sister, a different one from that mentioned in No.\n10, was not by consumption but by typhoid fever. We always regarded her\nhowever as inheriting consumption, and already then showing various\nsymtoms of it.\n16. Her description was meagre but correct, which would accord with\nthe circumstance that, as she died nineteen years ago, my own remembrance\nis meagre.\n17-23. Then followed the description of a very intimate friend, F.W. B.,\nlately dead, of whom the two most remarkable characteristics, one a very\nunusual one, as different from other men, were correctly stated.\n25. A return to the person mentioned in 2-7 brought up a description of\na mutual friend who would most naturally have come up in the connection.\nI did not at first recognise the person till Mrs. Piper abruptly said that\nsomel hing was the matter with either the first or second finger of the right\nhand. I instantly recognised the person then, and that this was the one\nslight physical deformity by which he might have been described by those\nof us who had known the cause of it. It then became a question as to\nwhether Mrs. Piper could name the finger correctly. I exercised all possible\nwill-power to assist, but she wrongly named the second finger instead of the\nfirst.\n26-29. Mrs. Piper then passed abruptly to a criticism of my own physical\ncondition. There were four chief points, all correct, but as my own ills are\nthose of thousands, especially in America, I have valued them as in the\ntable, very little.\n30. During the writing purporting to be by my sister, mention was con\nstantly made of the name of her most intimate friend, and that without any\nquestion or allusion on my part. In this event there was what seems to me\na singular piece of support for my thesis, for the name by which this friend\nwas called was that by which I, not knowing her well personally, always\nsupposed she was called by my sister. But it seems that between them\nselves the middle name only was used.\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 533\nSeance with Mrs. Piper,\nFebruary 10th, 1895.\n\u2022a \u00ab\n-2\n. - Direct V\nJt \u2014 \u2014 Assertions. 3\n1 -1\nII\ns ?\n'0.

Various other names were mentioned in both the writing and speak\ning, some entirely unknown to me and others proving nothing.\n32. Various statements also were made which were such as any fortune\nteller might make, having a general bearing, but no special worth. I am\nbound to say, however, that they were few, which on the other hand again\nmay be accounted for by my interposing definite questions when such\nremarks became at all tedious.\nI have nothing more to add except that the total result seems best\nrepresented by the contents of columns 6 and 7 of the table. . . .\nW. B. C.\nSeptember 9lh, 1895.\nSitter : Professor J. M. Baldwin. Appointment' made by Professor\nW. James. [Sitting probably held at house of Professor James in\nCambridge.] Professor Baldwin made the following statement : \u2014\nPrinceton, N.J., September 13th, 1895.\nMy impressions noted immediately after my sitting with Mrs. Piper,\nSeptember 9th, are about as follows :\u2014\n1. There are three elements of truth in the matter of her \"messages\"\nwhich need explanation : her description of certain facts of my brother's\nlife ; the initials H. B. and H. H. B. (my wife's initials) in connection with\nthe seal which I put in her hands\u2014a seal given to me by my wife ; and her\ntelling of the death of another brother in boyhood.\n2. These elements of truth were, however, so buried in masses of\nincoherent matter and positive errors as to matters in which she tried to\ngive information, that the sense of her failure on the whole is far stronger\nwith me.\n3. Even as to the fact of her being in a trance at all, my impression Ts\nnot strong despite the fact that I came fully expecting to be convinced on\nthat point.\n4. My state of mind, therefore, is almost the same that it was before the\nsitting, i.e., a condition of willing approach to any evidence on either side\nof the question at issue ; I am only disappointed that she did not give me\nmore data for forming a positive opinion. 1 am fully aware, however, that\none such sitting has very little negative weight, considering the variations\nwhich this sort of phenomena are subject to.\nJ. Mark Baldwin.\nAbout November 30th, 1895.\nSitter : Professor Herbert Nichols.\nProfessor Nichols lectured for some time at Harvard University.\nThe following account, undated, was forwarded to me by Professor\nJames, to whom it was sent. I knew Professor Nichols, though not\nintimately, and was unaware that he had a sitting until several days\n\fxxxiii.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 535\nafter his sitting, when a brief message came apparently from his\nmother, that led me to surmise that he may have been the \"unknown\"\nsitter for whom I had appointed a day.\n******\n[Received by R. H. December 24th, 1895.]\nJust before coming away I had a wonderful sitting with Mrs. Piper. As\nyou know, I have been a Laodicean toward her heretofore. But that she is\nno fraud, and that she is the greatest marvel I have ever met I am now\nwholly convinced. Think my interview more wonderful than any I have\never heard reported of her before. I went under an assumed name through\nappointment made with Hodgson by letter\u2014even he did not know who I\nwas\u2014probably does not now. The most of the interview, and by far the\nimportant part, was of such a nature I can't write about it, but should like to\ntell you somewhat of it sometime.\nI asked her scarcely a question, but she ran on for three-quarters of an\nhour, telling me names, places, events in most startling manner.\nThen she suddenly stopped talking and began writing\u2014this was far less\nsatisfactory and about an entirely [different] set of matters\u2014mostly about\nMamma (who recently fell and was killed) and message to her grandchildren.\nOne thing here, however, will interest you. Mamma and I one Christmas\nexchanged rings. Each had engraved in his gift the first word of his\nfavourite proverb. The ring given me I lost many years ago. When\nMamma died a year ago, the ring I had given her was, at her request, taken\nfrom her finger and sent to me. Now I asked Mrs. Piper \" What was\nwritten in Mamma's ring ? \" and as I asked the question I held the ring in\nmy hand and had in mind mdy that ring. But I had hardly got the words\nfrom my mouth till she slapped down on the paper the word in the other ring\n\u2014the one Mamma had given me, and which had been lost years ago while\ntravelling. As the word was a peculiar one, doubtfully ever written in any\nring before, and as she wrote it in such a flash, it was surely curious. . . .\n[Nichols.]\n\f536 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nAPPENDIX IV.\nThe following series of sittings with Dr. and Mrs. A. Blair Thaw\nand several of their closely connected relatives and friends are\nquoted in full as a specimen series, owing to the completeness of the\nrecord. Some weeks before the date of their first sitting, Dr. and\nMrs. Thaw, who had heard that Mrs. Piper had been reported upon\nfavourably in our Proceedings, called on Mrs. Piper at her house in\nArlington Heights, Mass., and requested a sitting, without giving their\nnames. Mrs. Piper was ill at the time, and not giving any sittings,\nand referred them to me. They called on me, and expressed their\ndesire for a sitting, and finally gave me their address in New York.\nThey were previously entirely unknown to me and were not members\nof our Society, and did not give me their names till the end of our\ninterview. I told them that Mrs. Piper expected soon to visit one of\nour members, Dr. Anna Lukens, living in New York, and a sitting\nmight be arranged for them there. In consequence they had their first\nsitting at the house of Dr. Lukens, to whom they were previously\nunknown. Their next three sittings were at Mrs. Piper's house in\nArlington Heights, and the May sittings were in New York or its\nvicinity, where Mrs. Piper was their guest. The sitting of January\n16th, 1893, was at a friend's house in Boston. The omitted portions\nof the sittings, marked by asterisks, and all of which I have seen,\nconsist, for the most part, of references to living persons, showing an\nintimate knowledge of their character. The record of one sitting,\nwhich came between the numbered sixth and seventh, is omitted\naltogether, at the request of the sitter, as being too intimately personal,\nand containing much very private matter concerning the deceased.\nThe persons who had sittings were Dr. and Mrs. A. B. Thaw, Mr.\nLorenzo Dow and Mrs. Sabrina Dow (the father and mother of Mrs.\nThaw), Mr. Alexander Dow (the brother of Mrs. Thaw), Mr. George\nPerkins, an intimate friend of the Thaws and of Mr. A. Dow, and at\nthat time associated in business with him, Mr. Melvin W., the agent\nof Dr. Thaw's country estate, and Miss Ellen Heffern, the nurse of\nDr. Thaw's children. It may be said that in the later sittings, at any\nrate, some of the information given may have been acquired by Mrs.\nPiper, since she was a guest at the house of the Thaws. This, of\ncourse, cannot be denied. Dr. Thaw, however, was a careful investi\ngator, and was well aware of the necessity of adopting such precautions\nas were possible under the circumstances ; and there are various\n\fxxxni.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 537\nincidetits in the later sittings which probably few persons would\nsuppose that Mrs. Piper could have \" got up \" or heard about before\nhand, such as the information given in connection with special articles\npresented as tests, or the prophecy, afterwards fulfilled, that Dr.\nThaw's brother W would die in sleep, in six months or less, of\nheart failure.\nSome of the most striking incidents in the series occurred at the\nfirst sitting, in connection with the deceased children of the Thaws,\nand with their friend \" Dr. H.\" In considering the hypothesis of\nimposture, first sittings, of course, caeteris paribus, are of the most\nevidential value ; but it is only from series of sittings with the same\nsitters, or the same \" communicators,\" that we can hope to arrive at\nsatisfactory conclusions concerning the significance of the phenomena.\nSome of the more important incidents that occurred in this series of\nsittings are quoted on pp. 351-2, 384-5. Of the many other references\nto friends and relatives mentioned at the sittings I have not given any\nsummary. The records should be read in detail to be appreciated, as\nthe form in which the information is given is in most cases not\nless important than the matter.\nFirst Sitting. February 14th, 1892.\n[Present : Dr. and Mrs. A. B. Thaw ; also Mrs. Holmes, who has\nquieting physical influence on Mrs. Piper. Sitting arranged for by\nDr. and Mrs. Thaw, without giving names.

I'll touch him.\nPhinuit : Ret-tie. Ret-thie. [Phinuit is given watch and chain that\nbelonged to Dr. T.'s mother, who died thirty years before.] Here comes a\nlady. Grandma !

[All correct.]\nBut he has no heart trouble. He thinks there is something the matter\nthere, but there isn't. Did you ever hear him say he had heart trouble ?\n(Mr. P. : No.) Well, he said so, whether you heard him or not. [All this\nnot known to any one present, but verified afterwards. Mr. P.'s father had\nnever mentioned it, even to his doctor.]\nPhinuit : Wait a minute, where's Sis\u2014 That little girl is here with her.\nShe'll be back in a minute.

I get the sister and the mother both with this.\nDo you know, they both wore this ? You know what I mean. Both\nrecognise this ; it's connected with them.

[To Mr. P.] I\ndun't think this belongs to you. But there's a young lady and also a gentle\nman comes with this ; you see what I mean, and perhaps you will reoognise\none of them. There's a young lady who passed out of the body and died\nsome years ago ; I think fell from a horse ; had a fall. Well, well, you find\nout about it. This is not a relative of yours, it is a friend.

And he says \" Tell George he is a good fellow, but he didn't\nunderstand me ; you must say so.\" [Mr. P. and friend B. had misunder\nstanding for several months before B's death.]\nI tell you what they say, but I don't know whether it's right or not.\nWho's Orton ?

He's there with you ; tell him I'm\nall right. [Verified afterwards. Fred, an intimate friend of G.

I hope one of you will drop round and\nsee me sometimes. I didn't think I was coming here\u2014but woke up. I\nchoked at first, but I'm better now. You wouldn't go to sleep if you had\nseen me when I first waked up. I didn't think I was going to wake up\nlike this. You haven't got all your wits about you yet, and so you don't\nrecognise your friends. I'll be with you ; I'll help you out in all your little\ndifficulties. I'll be with you. I mean well.\n(Mr. P. : Will you tell me about them ? There's one that passed out\nafter you did.)\nPhinuit : This one talks in a whisper to me. Good fellow, means well.\nWhat a funny nose he has. He looks as if his nose turned up a little. You\nknow what I mean. [Correct.]\nWho's Charlie ? Wait a minute\u2014A-N-D-R-A\u2014There's a fellow with him\nin the body that he's calling for\u2014Chester\u2014something like Blown. I'll try\nagain.

Speak to me.\nPhinuit : He wants you to speak to him. He says he's very light.\nPhinuit [for Andre] : This is news to me. I didn't know we could com\nmunicate like this. I didn't know I should have a chance to speak to you\nso soon. How is mother ?\n(Mr. P. : Any message for her ?)\nPhinuit [for Andre] : Tell mother to put my check suit in the closet,\nand not to give it away ; I liked it very well.

Mother's going to be all right. She's not\nwell. She's not well. She's poorly. She\u2014I'll tell you about this. She's\ngot\u2014[Working with glove fingers.] This is a weak influence. This is\nyour mother's influence in the body, and she's not well, you know. She's got\na trouble with her stomach, with her head. She has headache a little.\nThere's something wrong with her liver. She's got rheumatism a little, too.\nSomething in her blood. She ought to get it out. [True.] Her mother\nwants to send love to her. Who's Ruth, grandmother ? Ruth, grandmother\nwants to send her love to her, and tells her to take a good deal of fresh air.\nHer father is here with her. But you know there's a little trouble with\nyour mother's hand. [Feeling Mrs. T.'s hand. Lets go Mrs. T.'s right\nhand, and takes hold of forefinger of her left hand, and rubs all around\njoint and nail.] Her father tells me she's had great trouble with her hand\nhere. Right on that finger of that hand ; yea, right there. And it's a\nswelling round here. Inflammation. A sort of felon. From a sliver he's\ngot there. And it has an inflammation all around that nail. [All this about\nMrs. T.'s mother, right in every particular.]\nHer father sends his love to her. (Mrs. T. : Can you give his\nname?) Phinuit : I told you about him before. (Mrs. T. : Can he send his\nname ?)\nPhinuit : He was here when the fellow was here. I called it to you,\nbut I told you it was a little mixed. I'll talk to you\u2014Ruth it here too\u2014\nLittle Ruth and big Ruth, and Margery, and there's aunt Anna, and do you\nremember this aunt Eliza? Ah! You know who this is! [Mrs. T.'s\naunt Ann Eliza.] Well, there's aunt Mary Jane.\nYou tell Dr. Thaw that L is all right, and she's got to come to it,\nand that's what's the matter. I never saw such a lot of people.

[We\nknew that a Mr. French, deceased, had been an intimate friend of Dr. H.,\nbut we were unaware of his first name, which proved to be Henry.]\nH. : How are they all at home ? (Mrs. T. : Pretty well.) H. : Do they\nknow of this ? (Mrs. T. : Yes, I told them and they are very glad. )\nH. : Well, you tell them I am not dead, and I wish they were as well\noff as I am. This is only one of the first signs of what is coming to\nthe whole world\u2014of what is opening to you, and I tell you I have seen your\nlittle children, and they are well and happy. All these things are natural,\nand you have to expect them as natural, as natural consequences, so what's\nthe use of making a fuss and kicking up a broil over nothing ? Just pass\nout of the body and it's all right. Who's this George ? I think I've seen\nhim in the distance. I don't quite recollect him. But perhaps you will\nremember me to him. [H. had seen George Perkins only once since he\nknew him in boyhood.]\nPhinuit : You know Ellen, Helen.

[This was a test question asked on behalf of Mrs.\nH. The answer was unknown to us.]\nH : I see him, of course. He said, \" Some things are very bitter ; I'll\ncome to you if I can.\" [Unknown.]\n(Mrs. T. : Can you tell me what he believed about these things ?)\nH. : He was a little mixed, but he believed that he should exist. And\nhe exists just as he thought he would, and tells me to tell you so. [This is\nthe correct answer to Mrs. Dr. H.'s test question.]\nPhinuit : Here's James, an elderly, gentleman comes. [Mrs. T.'s mother's\nfather.] Phinuit, for J. : Tell your mother that I am all right, and I wish\nshe would tie up her fingers and take care of her toes, and they'll get well.\n[Very characteristic of James.] I am here to send love to her.\nPhinuit : The babies are here. Tell mamma about the pictures of little\nMargery.\n(Mrs. T. : No, the picture is of little Ruth.)\nPhinuit : A picture of little Ruth, and a picture of little Margery. It\nwas hardly finished. Ruthie's was begun, but it was not finished. It is\nfinished now, and it looks very pretty. Looks as if she could speak. She\nwants you to make one of the little one. There is one\u2014what you call a\nphotograph. [All true.]\n(Mrs. T. : Will she come to me so I can get it like her ?)\nPhinuit : Well, she wants you to copy that, and then she'll come, and\nyou'll get a picture, and she'll look exactly as if you had drawn her in the\nbody. [Mrs. T. gives a pin, about which we knew no more than that it was\ngiven to us to test Phinuit with by a cousin. The pin was very small.\nPhinuit muttered a good deal of French, repeating, \"Petite, petite, petite,\"\nseveral times.] Well, there's a young girl connected with this in the body,\nthat's got sandy hair. She's got a mother, in the spirit. She's been, or\ngoing, across the water. That belonged to a gentleman and then to a lad}-.\nThere's somebody named Will connected with it. 1 don't get the intelli\ngence of any spirit ; if I did I could get it straighter for you. Oliver,\nArline\u2014[a cousin's name] somebody, but I can't get that. I don't know\nabout it. This was given to a lady by a gentleman. It's a young man, you\nknow what I mean. They are both in the body, and he has a mother in the\nspirit. Then she also had a friend named Lucy. [Pin was given to Arline\nby a gentleman, H. L., who received it from his father William. H. L.'s\nsister has sandy hair. Their mother is dead. Lucy unknown.]\n[Mrs. T. gives mother's glove again.] Your mother and father both have\nrheumatism. You must look after them. They are going to take a trip\nthat will be very beneficial to them. She's nearer to you [pointing to Mr. D.,\nthen to Mrs. T] I can't make out which one she's more with, but she's\nnearer one of you.\n(Mrs. T. : She's living with me now.)\nPhinuit : Oh, you live in one home, but I see the other in another home,\nand she lives with you [pointing to Mrs. T.] [Pointing to Mr. D.] She's\nvery fond of you.\n(Mrs. T. : Yes, he's better than I am.)\nPhinuit : What nonsense, he isn't better than you, don't be jealous.\n\fxxxm.] Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance. 561\n(Mrs. T. : I'm not jealous.)\nPhinuit [rubbing Mrs. T.'s head] : No, and you are not going to begin in\nyour old age, are you ? You be a good girl. You'll be all right if you don't\nread lying down. If you'll only read when you're standing up you'll keep\nall right. Your sister is not your sister but a half-sister. [Correct.] Your\nfather had two wives. [Correct.] Well, that's mighty funny. I told you\nher name a long time ago, but you wouldn't recognise it. [Name Elizabeth.\nPhinuit gave Bessie.] You were not quite right. You speak to her and\ntell her you are sorry. Why didn't you recognise her ?\nPhinuit for E. : You tell your father Gracie\u2014Gracie is all right. (Mrs.\nT. referring to E. : What did my father use to call her ?) Phinuit : She's\nlaughing and says he knows, ask him. She wants to send her love to him.\nWho's Nana I That's another name for Nellie. Well, you tell Nana\nshe's all right. [Nana was a pet name of Bettie's for Nellie. Ruth made\nattempts to say it before her last illness.]\n(Mrs. T. : What about Father's business ?) [Phinuit immediately makes\nmotions as of playing on piano keys. Mrs. T.'s father's invention, a type\nsetter, with keys like a piano.] Phinuit : It has keys. Keys with letters\non them. [Correct.]\n[Mr. D. takes Mrs. T.'s place.] Oh, it's such a funny thing. Did he\ninvent them ? Well, he's a great man. There's going to be a spring addition\nthat's going to be very useful, and after a few months of dulness it will be\nall right. You are going to change the surroundings. [True.] And that\nwill be much better. He's going to sell some of these things. What does\nhe want to do with them ? Wants to rent them. [Correct.] It's been a\nlong pull and a hard pull, but he's going to rise out of this like a fish\njumping out of water. Add the spring part, and it will be good. All this\nlong pull and dull time was for the best. [Long struggle to get the thing\nstarted.] You're going across the water. A William is in the surroundings.\nWho's L-o-w-r-e-n-z-e\u2014who's L-o-r-e-n-z-e ? (Mr. D. says: \"Lorenzo\").\n[Lorenzo Dow, living, the father of Mr. A. D.\u2014R.

A William is coming into the surroundings, and then it\nwill be all right. You're going across the water. It is going to be a great\nthing. Get the patterns all right. [Mr. P. and Mr. D. were making\ndrawings of the machines, called \"patterns\" by them.] It will be dark a\nfew months ; afterwards all right.\nGeorge Perkins. Do you know how I got his name first. One of his\nfriends whispered me his name. George is a good fellow. Honest fellow.\nGeorge is true blue. Don't tell that to him ; he might get conceited.\n(Mr. D. : I don't believe he'll get conceited.)\nPhinuit : Well, I'm only in fun.\n[Mrs. T. takes Phinuit' s hand.] (Are we going to do any good in our\nwork ?)\nPhinuit : You are going to make a change. Who's Emily ? You're going\nto change your life. I'll be there. [Mrs. T. found on getting home that\nthe Christian name of principal of the school they were starting was Emma.\nThis we had never heard or seen, as the lady was not known personally\n\f562 [part\nRxchard Hodgson.\nto Mrs. T., and her acceptance of the position was not received by us until\nafter the sitting.] You are getting on with it. I might say you're just\nbeginning with it, but it's going to be splendid. It has to do with the mind.\n[Feeling Mrs. T.'s eyes.] The physical being of those who can't see. To\nbenefit the blind, the ignorant. I don't mean the eyesight. [Dr. and\nMrs. T. starting free primary school and kindergarten.] Margery will be\nthere.\nMamma, mamma, I love you. Don't cry.

But how she has changed. Are you happy now ?\nJames says that he wants to know if you are happy now ? It's a long road\nthat has no turning to it. I have been here many years. But you will\nremember the old place. Home is home in the body, and my home is near\nto me, dear. It has been a long struggle, but you have waded through it.\nIt's going to be all right.

I'm coming back after all. . . . Who's\nTom, Thompson ? That's his father. He's aspired to come, but he can't\nget here. [Thompson was the name of the husband of the mother of\nGeorge Perkins, the sitter of March 18th, 1892. \u2014Dr. Thaw, 1896.]\nHere's the little child\u2014Margery.\n[R. H. returns and takes notes. Dr. T. gives a watch not given before.]\nYou give me the watch and I'll take it to her. . . . Ho! That brings\nthe gentleman. There's your mother's watch I want. (Tell me about that\nwatch.) That's the father and the mother. (Whose father ?) That's your\nfather. (Wrong that time.) [The other watch given.] [Phinuit says the\ntwo watches confuse him.] This is the one she wanted. Your mother.\n[Correct. Same watch as in first sitting.] She's been out of the body a\nlong time. [Phinuit asks that explanation be made to Dr. T.'s mother\nabout his marriage. She died when he was a little child.] She remembers\nH , and W is with her and W is coming to us soon and suddenly.\n[Phinuit apparently bewildered with names.] W says W is coming\n\f566 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nto us. [At this place Phinuit said, \"How can W be here and W\nbe coming ? \" Dr. T. said he understood it.]\n(How soon ?) He's coming within six months or a year. You've got\ntwo fathers. One's name is Lorenzo and one James.\n(Mrs. T. : That's my father and grandfather.)\n(How is W going to pass out ?) He's going to sleep, and when he\nwakes he'll be in the spirit. Heart will stop. Kidneys out of order. He's\nout of order all over. It'll be one of the greatest reliefs to all concerned.\n[See note at end of sitting.]\n[In reply to question about L .] L is going to change her views.\n(Shall I help to bring this change ?) Your spiritual self will act on her\nunconsciously to yourself. Consciously you can't do her good. Your\nmother says that they are going to influence her.\nI want to know who you call J . He's here in the spirit. He comes\nin connection with yonr mother and father. He's a relative. (How old\nwas he when he passed out ?) A little fellow. That's your brother.\n[Brother J. died in infancy, eight years before Dr. T.'s birth.]\n(Is there another J ?) And there's another J , that's a funny\nold crank, etc. [Also name of grandfather.]\n(Why don't you tell us more about W ?) [Slight alteration.] When\nhe came out of the body, the first interest was back with his children in the\nmaterial body. (Didn't he want to see my mother ?) She's with him. (Why\ndidn't he see her first ?) Well, he did. After he saw her he went to the\nchildren. (Has W any message to send to his scientific friends ?)\n[Phinuit explains that question must be given now, and answered another\ntime.]\n[Letter.]\n[Sitter, Mrs. Thaw, asks for name of friend of her mother which Phinuit\npromised at previous sitting to get and give.]\nThat's the lady who passed out of body with cancer.

I\nwant to thank you for all the many kind things you've done for me. The\nchildren are all right. There's not one of them coming to me. What's\nthat about the grave, the tomb 1 (I don't know.) Well, tell them not to\nworry about it. [Dr. H.'s wife was for nearly a year much depressed\nby the fact that H.'s body lay in vault awaiting burial.] He says some\nthing about A .

She's going to stay in the body for the present.\n[H.'s daughter A was dangerously ill at that time, but on our next\nvisit was found to have passed the crisis.] I'm glad to see you, my best\nfriends.

I'm talking to you myself, you\nrascal. I'm talking for him. (Well, you're trying to make us think he's\ntalking.) I'm simply telling you what he says. I'm trying to imitate him.\n[Writing.]\n[Writing by \"Dr. H.\"] Give me something to do for you, Dr. dear.\nTell me what I shall do for you. I will bring anything I can to prove\nmyself to you. (Tell us something that's known only to your wife.) All\nright. I will. (Will you do more than one thing ?) Yes. Please tell me,\nDr. dear, what you want.

There had been some increase of difficulty of\nbreathing and circulation during the past eighteen months, and a brief\nperiod of slight dropsical symptoms during the winter. Two weeks after\nsitting W came to New York for a careful medical examination, and for\nthe first time kidney disease was discovered.\nW died September 3rd, in sleep, of heart failure, four months later.\nIn the sitting of May 22nd the time of death is put at \" six months, or a\nlittle less.\"\nW had been a great sufferer most of his life.\nSeventh Sitting.

(He is not here). [To Dr. T.]\nHello, Dr. ! [Touching Mr. W.] That's a gentleman. You want me to tell\nyou about all your friends, don't you. I have a message for you Dr. from\nDr. H. (That's all right). [Dr. T. goes out.]\n[To Mr. W.] You're not ill. There's nothing the matter with you.\nWhy don't you talk to me ? First, I want to see how you feel. Ha, that's\nfunny. [Feeling head. Feeling stomach.] There's no danger of your\npassing out yet awhile. You think there's something the matter with you\nphysically here, but you're pretty well. Mentally you get all muddled up.\n\f568 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\nSometimes you don't know what to do or which way to turn. Before your\nfriends come here I'll talk to you yourself. You're going away. Across a\nlarge body of water. It is unexpected, but pretty near by. You will be\npractically alone, but friends of some kind will be with you. [This pro\nphecy had a curiously exact fulfilment within two weeks, though without\nany expectation of it at the time of sitting.]\nThere's a little child around you. Funny little thing. In the body.\nThat's queer.\nYou don't know which is which or what is what, sometimes. [Feeling\nhead.] That impresses me. but you're a pretty good fellow all the same.\nHave you got anything belonging to anybody ? [Gives a pin.] I've got a\ncough. You won't believe me, but there's a lady and gentleman both\nconnected with this. [Pin, belonging to gentleman (dead) was thrust\nthrough a silk band painted by a lady who died of consumption.] The lady\npassed out of the body. I'll tell you about her in a few minutes. You\nwon't believe me, but there was a trouble through here. [Lower abdomen.\nUnverified.] It takes some time, because this is a small thing.\nAnother one has handled this, in connection with the lady who is here. Do\nyou know about this? (Yes.) I am sorry because you'll say I got that\nout of your head. [To Dr. T.] Dr., you go out. [Dr. goes out.]\n1 get your mother on this. These articles were put together. They\nwere mixed up. [That was true.]\n[Gives a ring.] That belongs to the mother. This is a lady who also\npassed out of the body. The two connected in a funny way. Like mother\nand daughter-in-law. [Not true.] You have a little piece of your mother's\nhair somewhere. (Yes.) There's something funny about it. You cut it off\nafterwards. After she passed out. (That is true.) I get Mara, a sister. I\ndon't know how you pronounce it. It is in connection with this lady. It's\nan aunt. M-A-R-I-E. [Only sister of father. Sitter did not recollect at the\ntime, but this is true.] You will find that out. Her other name is Elizabeth.\nMarie Eliza. You'll find that out. [Her name was afterwards found to be\nMary Eliza. See below.]\n(What do you get about my mother ? ) You haven't the piece of hair ?\n( No. ) Who's this she calls Alvin ? Elvin\u2014E-L-V-A. Well, it sounds like\nthat, any way. She's talking to you. Elvin. She says, \"Why don't you\ntell him his name's Elvin ? \" She knows\u2014you know what I mean. She is\ntrying to break through the veil. She wants you to know she's not dead.\nSpeak to her. (Who is with her ?) She speaks in a whisper. She had\ntrouble here. [Touching chest.] She filled all up. She passed out with\nthat. But she didn't suffer as she seemed to. [All true. Consumption.]\nThere's this lady, a sister of your father, passed out. Marie Eliza. Some\nthing like that. There's another sister. That makes two, three. Some\none in body, Jane. Jen. She was kind to her. (Maria ? ) Before she\npassed out. She was not a relative. Ann. Who's this ? A sister.\nJ-E-N-N-I-E. There's a good test for you. Maria ?\nHad trouble in her throat. Some time before she passed out. There's\none they call L-A-U-R-A. [An aunt.] One that sends her love. [Takes\nobject.] You put that on head.\nWho's William ? Warren.

[Not known.] Tell Elvin to speak\nto me and don't bo afraid. I got a Laura too.\n(What's my mother's name ?) She sends her love to you. What are you\nwriting ? There are papers all about you. You get awfully mixed up.\n[True at this time.]\nTell Caroline I'll speak to her later. That belongs to the lady that spoke\nto you. [Mrs. T. had spoken to sitter a moment before.] You don't talk\nto your mother at all. Tell Elvin I am here. Who's that other person ?\nThere are three. An aunt and a sister of this lady, your mother.\n[Gives hat-band again ] Hat. This belongs to your own family. (The\none who gave that?) Who's Laura ! (A sister of that one.) Your mother\nhad a sister and your father had a sister.\nMaria calls Will\u2014William. He passed out of the body by drowning.\n[Unable to obtain answer to inquiry.\u2014R. H.]\nLouisa and Jane were friends of this sister. [Louisa not known.] Who\ntook care of her when she passed out ! Louise had rheumatism in her hands.\nYou find out about that. [Nothing known.] One was a sister by marriage.\nThere was a name, Norton.\nWho does Ruth belong to ? She sees somebody and wants to talk to\nsomebody. She puts my hand that way. [Waving hand like a child.] Tell\ndoctor he is good. I like him. My son. My son. Tell them my son is good.\n[To the doctor.] Tell him I'll speak later. They're all right. Tell them\nall about Margaret.\nElvin. Elvin. Why didn't you come when she passed out ? To speak\nto her, \u2014after she passed out. Sura. Surie ? . . . S\u2014S-a-r-a-h. S-e-u-s-a.\nS-e-u-s-a-n. S-u-s-a-n [Correct.] I can't say it. Tell Elvin I am Susan.\nYou wanted to know my name, and I've told you. Don't doubt I'm your\nmother. She passed out in the evening or afternoon. She passed out of\nthe body and reached here in the evening, and wished to speak to you but\ncould not.\nSomebody else has handled this. It has your influence and hers. Susan\nwants me to tell you. . . .

[On\nbeing asked to repeat, writes it Melvin.] I am your mother, dear boy.\nSusan. Melvin. Melvin dear, speak to me. I am not dead.\n(What were the last words I said to you ?) Called \" mother,\" and asked\nme if I could see you, if I remember rightly. Those were the last words I\nheard you say. [Correct.] (What were the last words you said ?) I am\ngoing, raise me. Toll father. [Nothing remembered positively.]\n[Here Phinuit talks.] This is a lovely lady. Just as bright and spiritual\nas she can be. She's a beautiful lady. She suffered, but not as much as you\nthought she did.\n[Writing.]\nTell father to get the things.* [This is the sense of last words to husband.]\nI do not remember just that. Dear Melvin, I see you, dear child. I love\nyou, my boy, and want you to think of me often. Tell him I am happy.\n\f570 [part\nRichard Hodgson.\n(Have you any message to send to father ?) G is all right. I know\nit. Poor [?] boy.\n(Have you any message for father ?) Who do you mean ? Oh yes. [The\nhand here turns back to page having writing marked by star above, then\ngoes on writing] and bring them to me. Yes, I told him to bring the things\nhome. Tell him he brought them and I was pleased.\n(Won't you send some other message ?) Yes.\n(Is my father happy in his life now ?) No.\n[The hand here was writing \" yes \" while sitter was asking second\nquestion. The sitter, not knowing which answer applied to second question\nasked, \" Yes or no ? \" The hand then tried to scratch out the yes.] .\n[Sitter asks about owner of pin.]\nHe is here, but I do not know him personally. How can I, dear T I\nwill find him.\n[Sitter asks about some misunderstanding in the house.] (Did you\nremember it ?) I do perfectly, and I told [something.] [Confused.] [End\nof writing.]\n[Phinuit comes back, with great difficulty getting hand away, until ring\nwas removed from the linger ; then talks.] [On several occasions Phinuit\nhas purported to leave the body for a short time while the hand was being\nused by another communicator. But the phrase used above probably here\nmeans only that he began again to talk. He frequently remarked about the\ndifficulty of \"getting the hand back \" from the control of a writing com\nmunicator. See p. 292. \u2014 R. H.] Here's the baby Ruthie. Pat papa.\n[Pats for a long time.] She says I don't do it right. I am not gentle\nenough. I don't do it the way she used to do. [Medium waves hands at\nMr. W.] This is for that gentleman.

Yes, as sure as you live.\n(Tell Dr. H. to have some things ready for us soon.)\n[Dr. Phinuit listened to his own voice in phonograph, saying, \"Oh,\nyou're a nice old fellow. You've got me on record.\"]\n[Phonograph says, \"I'm going out.\"] So I am going out. Ha, ha, that's\ngood.\nRuthie wants to see Nana soon and bring Betty.\nEighth Sitting. May 20th.\n[Mr. L.

You came with the tube.\nYou're the fellow with a little weakness. How are you, pretty well ?\n(Is there anything particularly the matter with me ? ) Well, you're pretty\nlevel-headed, to say the least. I'll tell you one thing very good, you're over\nthe worst of your troubles. You have no Bright's disease, no heart trouble\u2014\njust a little nervous. A little pressure on the bladder. You're going to be\nall right. You may have a touch of neuralgia or rheumatism. But you'll\ncome all right.\n(How about Medium ? She has a cough.)\nMy Medium ? She has a cough, has she ? Well, you have her put a half\nounce of turpentine in a half a cup of boiling water, and inhale it.\n(What for her trouble under the arm 1 )\nOh, that's poor blood. A tonic will scatter that. You give her two\nounces of tincture of cinchona ; four ounces of French dialyzed iron and four\nounces simple syrup. Give her a teaspoonful one half-hour before meals.\nFabin. He knew you years ago. [Name not known.]\nBefore I forget it, Susan wants to tell Elvin she has found the young man\nin the spirit. His mother saw him. He wants to see Elvin. (\\Vho is he\nwith ? ) He's with his own friends. He's all right.\nHere's your lady. Elizabeth. And Gracie. [Correct. See former\nsittings.] She says you must take things easy. We are watching you in a\nway you know nothing about.\nYou're in something, in business. It's coming out all right. It needs\npatience and time. Everything has been good. What seems bad is for\nyour advantage. You will see that.\n(What do you want me to do ? )\nGive me something connected with your work. [Sitter gives small steel\npiece of machine.] I want to tell you something important. There's a tall,\ndark-complexioned gentleman with a heavy beard. He will put his interest\nin the thing. His name is something like Atwood. Atwood. [L. D. had\nbeen talking business with a Mr. Wood, of said complexion, etc.] (Do I\nknow him ?) I think not. He will be super\u2014what do you call it 1 Super\n\u2014something. (Superintendent.)\nIt will be the greatest success of the kind in your country.\nI see the propellor, or something of that kind. (Pusher.)\nI see five of these things. More. Many come running together. [Asked\nabout Atwood, counts five or six weeks in French.] He will come in that\nnumber of weeks. He has dark eyes and a prominent nose. [Not true.]\nThe name is nearly right, an A-t- and then two O's and a W. I see this my\nown self. There are no special spirits [Asked how he sees it ] I see it\nback of you, just as plainly as if it were before your eyes.\nThere's a young man has something to do with this. How's Aleck ?

[Ellen says that\nshe has seen and spoken with her mother twice ; once just before the\ndeath of Ruthie, and once before the death of a nephew. Both occasions\npreceded her first information as to anything regarding Mrs. Piper or similar\nsubjects.] There was a dream. She comes and walks around you. She's\ngot something here.

For in any new\nline of investigation there comes a time when, with the development of\nmethods and the accumulation of a sufficiently trustworthy mass of material,\nsome claim can be made to the presentation of its methods and results in\neducational institutions. Psychical research seems naturally to fall under\nPsychology, and so it is for instructors in psychology to decide when these\nnewer subjects of psychical investigation deserve a place in our university\ncourses.\nAt Harvard, Professor James gives about fifteen out of forty-five\nlectures in his course in Abnormal Psychology to psychical research work.\nBut neither of his psychological colleagues, Royce or Munsterberg, takes at\npresent any active interest in the subject. In Columbia the only allusion\nto the subject is by Professor Hyslop, who regrets that lack of time and a\nproper psychological course only allow him to mention it. He hopes,\nhowever, to offer some special work in this subject, and, if time and\nopportunity presented itself, would give a course for the whole year. He is\n\"convinced that the experimentalist who ignores it and taboos it, or refuses\nto understand it (it is not necessary to believe in it) is going to be left\nbehind, and will lose his influence ; for the time is coming in the near\nfuture when he will be called upon to discuss a problem which he has not\nequipped himself to discuss. \" However, neither of those in charge of the\nexperimental or abnormal Psychology \"pays the slightest attention to\npsychical research a la the English Society.\" The experimentalist \"taboos\nit throughout, but has never even read the reports and their experiments\nin telepathy.\"\nAt Pennsylvania, Professor Newbold says, \" My own interest in the\nmatter is very keen, and I regret very much that my work leaves me no\ntime for original research. I do not, however, introduce it into my teaching.\nIn the first place I am giving no courses in which the subject would\nnaturally find its place, and in the second, I am by no means sure that it\nis desirable, either for the sake of the cause or for the sake of the\n\f584 [Supplement.\nHarlow Gale.\nstudents, to do so. I always, however, so far as possible, endeavour to\narouse the interest of any individual student who seems possessed of the\ngood sense and judgment which are so essential in one who intends to\ndeal with such questions.\" Perhaps quite naturally Professor Fullerton's\nsix years of work with the Seybert Commission, in which he came in contact\nwith fraudulent mediums only, has resulted in giving him a thorough distaste\nfor the whole subject. The experimental Psychologist there is an orthodox\nof the pronounced type, and glories in the fact that he is not in the least\ninterested in \" so-called psychical research.\" Since the same man has charge\nof the work in experimental Psychology at Bryn Mawr (Women's), this\ncomplacent superiority prevails there also ; although Professor D. S. Miller,\nAssociate Professor of Philosophy, gives four or five lectures of his intro\nductory course to Hypnotism and psychical research, and formerly, in an\nadvanced course, gave them more time.\nAt Brown, Professor Delabarre has a \"Seminary on 'Abnormal and\nUnusual States of Consciousness' during the winter term, in which the\nwork of the S.P.R. is referred to and criticised.\"\nAt Smith (Women's) Professor Gardner reports :\u2014\"My reference to that\nwork in my classes is only incidental. Some years ago I had an elective\ncourse in which hypnotism, clairvoyance, telepathy, etc., were considered in\nsome detail, but I gave it up, as it seemed to me that the work was not of\nthat disciplinary character which I consider the main work of a college\nshould be.\"\nThe subject gets some attention at Chicago in connection with the\nregular psychological work, but it is given no independent treatment.\nA Psychologist of one of our larger Universities gives some criticism\nto psychical research, but does not wish his name mentioned in this\nconnection.\nFrom Cornell an Associate of the Society reports that not only is there\nno psychical research work there, but that the Psychologist \"will not even\nhave the S.P.R. Proceedings in the library lest they should inflame the\nimaginations and corrupt the minds of the students. This policy recently\nled to the somewhat comical result that he had to borrow the books of me,\nwhen he needed them for polemical purposes.\"\nThe attitude at Yale, aside from indifference, is shown in the warning\n\"against the unjustifiable application of the term 'experiment' to hypnotic\nexhibitions, to thought-transference follies, and to the so-called psychical\nresearch experiments. These amusements are as unrelated to scientific\nexperiments as clairvoyant healing and faith-cure to the science of\nmedicine \" (Scripture : Thinking, Feeling, Doing, 1895, p. 26). In his.\nNew Psychology, 1897, the same \" New Psychologist \" selects some\nS.P.R. cases as a travesty contrast to the experimenting of the trained\nscientist, and again sums up the detailed study thus: \"The objections to\npsychical research lie in its unscientific methods of experimentation and in\nthe air of occultism in which the whole is enveloped. If the investigator*\nwere trained in the psychological laboratory, we might expect interesting\ndiscoveries in regard to mind, while at the same time the repellent mysticism\nwould disappear along with odic force, animal magnetism, thought-transfer\nence, and other ghosts\" (pp. 62-69).\n\fPart xxxni.] Psychical Research in American Universities. 585\nAt our distinctively psychological University, i.e., Clark, the position of\nPresident Stanley Hall was shown in his review of the Proceedings and\nPhantasms of the Living in the first number of his Journal of Psychology.\nHe then wrote in 1887 from Johns Hopkins that the formation and plan of\nthe S.P.R. were \"such as to commend it, not only to every psychologist,\nbut to every true and intelligent friend of culture and religion \" ; and, in\nmost gratifying contrast to many cases of dogmatic incredulity, he has\nfollowed the publications of the S.P.R. in two reviews (Journal ofPsychology,\nVol. L, pp. 128-146; Vol. VII., pp. 135-142). He has made experiments\nin normal and hypnotic reaction times (Mind, Vol. VIII., p. 170) in his\nlaboratory at Johns Hopkins. There also Drs. Jastrow and Nuttall made\ntheir investigation \"on the existence of a magnetic sense\" (Proceedings of\nthe American S.P.R., p. 116). He himself had also up to 1887 \"spent\nmuch time and labour in repeating with many subjects nearly all the experi\nments of the English Society.\" Under these conditions of experience, and\nalong with much suggestive criticism, it is to be regretted that he then\nconcludes \" that the crude and premature theory of telepathy . . . lacks\neverything approaching proof save to amateurs and speculative psycho\nlogists\" (Journal of Psychology, Vol. I., pp. 143 and 146). Instead of\nbettering its claim during the next eight years his judgment seems more\nsevere. For he is profoundly convinced that \" the telepathic presumption is\nyet very far from being a prima facie case, is premature at best, and that it\nis at present with its rank mazes of mystic guess-work a source of befuddle-\nment and obfuscation galore. To say that telepathy ' is a name given in\nlieu of a theory about it,' or, with Mr. Podmore, to say it 'involves just as\nlittle theory as Newton's conception of gravity,' seems to us almost grossly\nmisleading, to say the least. Telepathy began as a definition of a new mode\nof psychic interconnection, and, instead of resting on the commonest facts\nof sense, and proving by mathematics, it has yet to find a single fact that\ncan be demonstrated regularly in laboratory courses that proves or even\nillustrates it with certainty. . . . The writer has diligently read the\nexperiments of the proceedings, and can honestly say that there is not one\nin which the conditions as reported seem to him satisfactory. . . . Give\nus one little fact, ever so little, that we can freely test and reproduce once a\nyear in our laboratory. We will cross seas to see it, will acknowledge our\nmistaken scepticism, and confess telepathy, and turn the research of ono\nlaboratory at least in a new direction\" (Journal of Psychology, Vol. VII.,\npp. 137 and 139).\nOn the other hand, however, Professor James gives most weighty\ninfluence to psychical research through such reviews as those in the Psycho\nlogical Review, Vol. II., p. 67, and his reply to Professor Cattell, of Columbia,\nin Vol. III., p 648 ; not to speak of his presidential address and papers\nwithin the S.P.R. itself.\nHere in the University of Minnesota I have given in the spring term of\nmy junior year course in Psychology nine weeks or thirty-six hours to\npsychical research, including two weeks on Hypnotism. In the first twelve\nhours the evidence on Telepathy is outlined after the plan in the Phantasms\nof the Living. Mr. Podmore's Apparitions and Thought-transference makes\nan invaluable book for the students in this problem, and the cases brought\n\f586 [Supplement.\nHarlow Gale.\ninto the lecture room are largely supplementary to those in these books.\nPractical demonstrations of the methods in the experimental cases, and a\nconstant analysis and criticism of these and of the spontaneous cases,\nstimulate some students to experiment with valuable results.\nIn the next sixteen hours the other more negative parts of the Society's\nwork are outlined. In addition to the most useful summaries on some of\nthe subjects given in Mr. Podmore's Studies in Psychical Research, Mr.\nMyers' \"Resolute Credulity,\" and in Professor James' Essay in his Will to\nBelieve, perhaps the appended note of references may be stimulating to a\nfurther presentation of them. Upon our reference table, as well as in the\nUniversity and Public Libraries, are sets of the S.P.R. publications,\ntogether with some of the standard works on the subjects. To these I add\nsomething from notes of my own experiences with professional mediums, and\nshow a collection of alleged spirit photographs compared with ones of my\nown manufacture.\nThen follow the eight hours of demonstration in non-sensational psycho\nlogical phenomena of Hypnotism, and the following of suggestion through\nits various names and phases of suggestive Therapeutics, \" School of\nPsychology \" (Chicago), Mind and Faith Cures, Metaphysical, Magnetic and\nDivine Healing, Christian Science, Miracles, etc., etc.\nComing, as this term's work does, after one term of lectures and\ndemonstrations in the Physiology and Psychology of Sense Perception, and\na second term on Association, Memory, Feeling, and Willing, it gives a most\nvaluable review of many of these phenomena, and their meaning is greatly\nenlarged by the new light from these points of view. So that this term is\nnot only naturally more popular than the other two, but, so far as I can judge\nfrom three years' trial, it is the most profitable of all to the students. For\nfew undergraduates get any serious meaning of the relation of the modern\nknowledge of our wonderful nervous mechanism to our conscious life, of the\ncomplex processes of sense perception to our real criterion of truth and\nlimits of knowledge, of the pleasure-pain elements on the highest develop\nments of our evolution and the ultimate basis of all conduct. But most\nstudents are still surrounded by a bewildering maze of alleged supernatural\npsychical phenomena which the ordinary psychological instruction does not\nattempt to pierce. If, however, the student can gain some analytical power\nin the classification of these mixed phenomena, some critical sense of what\nproof has been offered and must be offered in each category, the relations of\nthe residuum thus gained to our already established and explained psychical\nfacte, such an acquirement will, I think, do vastly more than the usual\nharmless psychological \"discipline\" towards making strong men. This so\nneglected function of criticism in education accounts for the often exaspera\nting slowness with which phenomena are transferred from some modern\nform of Animism to natural Science. Though I appreciate in the highest\ndegree, and after four years' experience of the Psychological Laboratories\nof Leipzig and Berlin, the great work which experimental Psychology is\nconsciously or unconsciously doing in freeing Psychology from Metaphysics\nand raising it to a worthy place among the Sciences, yet I deliberately\nbelieve that for immediate practical returns in education, the S.P.R. has\nmore to offer than all the Psychological Laboratories.

By Edmund Parish.\nLeipzig. 1897.\nThis pamphlet of forty-eight pages is a criticism, read before the\nPsychological Society of Munich, of the evidence for telepathy afforded by\nthe Report on the Census of Hallucinations published in the Proceedings of\nthe Society for Psychical Research, Vol. X. (Part XXVI.). '\nThe author in his preface characterises the discussion of the subject in\nthis Report, as \"the most important attempt yet made to prove the existence\nof telepathy.\" This was not the view taken of it by the Committee respon\nsible for the work. To them the most important evidence appeared to be,\nfirst, the experimental evidence published at various times in the Proceedings\nand in Phantasms of the Living ; and secondly, the large collection of\nspontaneous cases published in Plutntasms of the Living and since added to.\nExperience had already shown them that evidence equal to this, either in\nquantity or quality, could not be expected from a body of seventeen thousand\npersons chosen at random ; and accordingly the object in the part of the\nReport which deals with telepathy was to contribute to the proof of its\nexistence, not so much by accumulating fresh evidence as by supplying a\nmore complete answer to one of the objections urged against the evidence\nfrom spontaneous cases,\u2014the objection that the coincidences are accidental.\nHerr Parish has, however, evidently given more attention to our work\nthan our opponents usually vouchsafe to it. He in the main does justice to\nthe care with which the Committee endeavoured to carry out their task ; and\ngives a good short account of their method (pp. 10-17). Nevertheless, he\ndissents from their conclusion. He admits that the difficulties and objections\nho urged in his work on Hallucinations and Illusionsi against the telepathic\ninterpretation of certain results of-the \" census,\" are most of them found to\nhave little weight in the light of the since-published full report of the\nCommittee. Either they are removed by facts not known to him at the\ntime he advanced them, or they have been considered by the Committee\nthemselves and shown not to affect their general conclusion (p. 17). He\nstill thinks, however, that certain considerations, based on the material\nfurnished by the census of hallucinations itself, can be shown to overthrow\ni Ubtr die Trugwahmchmwtg. Leipzig, 1894. This work, published before the\nReport of the Canaus ,>\u00a3 Hallucinations came out, was reviewed in Proteedings, Vol.\nXI., p. 162. It has since been translated into English and published in the\nContemporary Science Series under the name of Hallucinations and Illusions: A\nstudy of the fallacies of Perception. Most of the additional discussion contained in\nthe pamphlet now under review, and other matter arising out of the Census Report,\nwas included in the Knglish edition, where, however, it is not always worked into\nthe earlier matter with complete success.\n2 Q 2\n\f590 (Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nthe evidence for telepathy afforded by it. To these arguments I shall\nendeavour to reply. He deals with them in order of importance, beginning\nwith that to which he attaches least weight. Put briefly they are as\nfollows.\n(1) A person who, in good faith, reports himself to have experienced\na hallucination of the senses, may very often be really suffering from an\nillusion of memory,\u2014a \" retro-active hallucination \" (p. 17).\n(2) Given that a hallucination of the senses really occurred, it is very\nquestionable whether the point (e.f\/., the recognition of the figure)\nwhich chiefly connects it with the coinciding death or other event, has\nnot been imported into it afterwards by \" memory-adaptation \" (p. 18).\n(3) He believes that the choice, as the object of statistical enquiry,\nof waking hallucinations of persons in good health, is itself the reason\nwhy there appear to be too many coincidences to be explained by chance\n(p. 23), because (p. 25) the coincidence causes what might otherwise\nbe remembered only as a dream to be remembered as a waking\nhallucination.\n(4) The content of a hallucination may be due to association of\nideas, and if this possibility be not excluded\u2014and it is practically\nimpossible to exclude it\u2014we are not justified in attributing the\nhallucination to a telepathic impact (pp. 40-45).\nThe first three of these objections all turn on supposed defects of\nmemory, and are all, by implication at least, dealt with in Chapter XII. of\nthe Report on the Census of Hallucinations. It is there said (pp. 210-211),\n\"There are two questions to ask about each case. (1) Have we good\nreason to believe that the hallucination really occurred within twelve\nhours of the death ? (2) Have we good reason to believe that it was\nrecognised before the death was known, and not merely, having been\nunrecognised at the time, assumed afterwards to have represented the\ndecedent because of the coincidence ? \" The first of these questions covers\nthe ground of Herr Parish's first objection, and also of his third, though\nthere are points in this last which we shall have to return to and consider in\nmore detail. The second of our questions covers the ground of Herr\nParish's second objection. The Report goes on to point out that the best\nguarantee against both kinds of exaggeration is a written note of the\nhallucination made before the death was known, and that confirmation may\nalso be afforded by evidence of the hallucination having been mentioned to\nanother person, or of action of some kind having been taken on it before the\ndeath was known. And in a large number of cases we have confirmation of\nthis kind.\nThere is a curious disagreement between the writers of the Report and\nHerr Parish in connection with the second question. They say that, though\nthe remembering of an unrecognised figure as a recognised one is an error\nagainst which we ought to be on our gu*rd, yet it is one of which we have no\nproved instances. Herr Parish on the other hand finds in the Report itself\ninstances of what had, he says, previously been with him mere conjecture ;\nand he quotes and discusses three of these. I have carefully examined these\nthree again and endeavoured to see why they affect Herr Parish and the\n\fPart XXXIII.] 591\nReviews.\nCommittee so differently, but I am bound to say that I fail to discover where\nHerr Parish finds the proof that recognition was read into them afterwards.\nIt will be instructive to discuss some points in these three cases a little\nmore fully. Two of them\u2014the experiences of Dr. H. C. (Proceedings,\nVol. X., p. 117) and of Dr. Jamieson (Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 265), are\nfrankly described as unrecognised from beginning to end, so that there\nseems to be no room for memory-adaptation. Dr. H. C, it is true, says he\nat one time connected the hallucination with a death that occurred some days\nlater, but there is no reason to suppose that he ever thought he had\nrecognised the figure.i Dr. Jamieson connected the figure with the death,\nwhen he heard of the latter, because of the coincidence of time, and because\nall that was discerned \u2014a female figure of medium height\u2014corresponded\nwith the appearance of the decedent, not because he imagined that he had\nrecognised it. In the third case, Countess Kapnist ( Proceedings, Vol. X.,\np. 284) describes herself as experiencing that kind of half recognition of the\napparition with which we are all familiar when we recognise a face but\ncannot put a name to it. She felt it represented some one she knew, but\ncould not think who it was till the news of the death brought the person to\nher mind. In dealing with a real person the genuineness of the half recogni\ntion may often be verified because, when we do succeed in putting the name\nand face together, we may ascertain that the person seen was really the owner\nof the name. In the case of an apparition no such verification is possible,\nand therefore for evidential purposes we must treat it as unrecognised.\nBut we may observe that Countess Kapnist's description of the phantasm\nappears to have resembled the dying person with whom it was afterwards\nconnected, sufficiently for her sister to agree as to the resemblance.\nIt seems to ba only in a quasi-coincidental case that this kind of deferred\nrecognition strikes Herr Parish as suspiciously suggestive of, and even\nproving, memory-adaptation. An instance of it given in the Report (Vol.\nX., p. 143) as a case where the content of the hallucination, as afterwards\nrecognised, can be traced to definite associations of ideas, appears to him to\nbe very interesting from the latter point of view (p. 42). 2\ni His word* are : \" five days before the death of a lady whom I used to connect\nin my mind with my vision. But I did not do this when I related my story in the\nmorning, nor till after the death of the lady ; and I now reject this connection as a\nfanciful addendum.\" ThU does not justify Herr Parish's statement (p. 20) \"dass die\nhallucinierte Gestalt wahrend fiinf Tagen unerkannt blieb, dass aber in Folge einer\naufregenden Todei-nachricht, die GesichtstaiHchuug sich sofort adaptierte.\" Merely\nto connect a vision and a death is a very different thing from the act of recognition,\nand if an illusion of memory led a man to believe falsely that he had recognised a\nfigure, it is difficult to see how he could believe afterwards, without positive evidence\nto the contrary, that he had not recognised it.\n- In this case the percipient saw very clearly and definitely a hallucinatory figure,\nand was a good deal disturbed by her inability to put a name to it. About a\nweek later it suddenly struck her that it had been the figure and face of a certain\nMrs. Beasant whom she had known years before. She believes that this particular\nperson was brought to her mind by complicated associations of ideas arising from\nrecent annoyance connected with another woman of the same name, a storm raging\nat the time, and a tree falling on the house a little time before. Mrs. Beasant had\nbeen killed by a falling tree.\n\f592 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidguncle\nUnless I have misunderstood Herr Parish, I think that some of his\nobservations on these cases betray a certain confusion of thought as to the\npurely subjective character of apparitions, whether veridical or not. There\nis a tendency in sensory hallucinations, as is pointed out in the Report,\nto take a realistic form\u2014to look as real figures or objects would look in the\nsame place and the same light. Thus in a good light the hallucinatory\nfigure will generally look clear and distinct, and in a dim light is not unlikely\nto be correspondingly incompletely seen. This is doubtless an effect of self-\nsuggestion. It was thus perhaps more probable than not that a hallucination\nseen by Dr. Jamieson in the almost darkness of 7.30 a.m. on, the 24th of\nDecember at Edinburgh i would be seen as he would have seen a real person\nunder similar circumstances, namely, as a dark figure without recognisable\nfeatures. At the same time there is no difficulty in a hallucination appearing\nas a physical object could not, e.g., coloured in a faint light, as Countess\nKapnist describes hers as doing. So to describe a real figure would be a\ncontradiction in terms, and Herr Parish writes as though the same con\ntradiction existed in the description of the hallucinatory figure and afforded\nevidence of confusion due to pseudo-memory. But there is no reason to\nsuppose this, since a hallucination cannot be affected by the state of the\nlight except so far as the latter may act suggestively on the mind of the\nseer.\nWhen a hallucination is indefinite as Dr. Jamieson's was, an interesting\npsychological question arises about it. Was the indefiniteness due to\nvagueness in the underlying mental impression, or was it due to defective\nexternalisation of a definite subconscious impression ? The question seems\nto Herr Parish absurd (see footnote, p. 22) but here again I think he shows\na want of complete grasp of the purely subjective character of the\nhallucinatory process. According to the provisional conception that we\nhave formed of the process of telepathic hallucination, there are three stages\ninvolved in it : first a subconscious mental impression of some kind, then\nthe externalisation of this as a hallucination, and, thirdly, the suggestion\nby that hallucination of conscious ideas and judgments. Of the first\nstage we have, in the case of spontaneous hallucinations, no direct\nevidence ; but the supposition of it is supported by the case of post\nhypnotic hallucinations where we are able to trace all the steps of the\nprocess. A good hypnotic subject can be told that he will see a certain\nperson or thing at a certain hour, and though he knows nothing of this\nsuggestion when roused from the hypnotic trance, will punctually see the\nhallucinatory form suggested. The experiment is so familiar to students of\nthe subject that it seems almost impertinent to give instances, but I may\nperhaps refer the reader to a striking example reported in a paper by\nMr. Gurney on Recent Experiments in Hypnolism (Proceulitw, Vol. V.,\npp. 12, 13).\nGranting these three stages in the hallucinatory process it seems reason\nable to suppose that indefiniteness may enter into it at any of them ; i.e.,\neither (1) the original mental impression may itself be vague, or (2) it may\nbe externalised in a vague hallucination, or (3) a clear externalisatim\ni The sun rises on that day at 8.47 according to an Edinburgh almanac.\n\fPart XXXm.] 593\nReviews.\nmay, as in Countess Kapnist's case, be incompletely or erroneously\nmterpreted. Here, again, we can appeal to hypnotic experiments. I will\ngive first a case where the vagueness in the hallucination was doubtless due\nto vagueness in the original idea. It is an account of an experiment made\nby Mr. Myers, and is described in a paper by him on the Subliminal\nConsciousness (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 400). Mr. Myers writes :\u2014\n\"Next time I suggested a hippopotamus -an animal which P. had\nnever seen in the flesh. On being awakened he saw on the card what he\ncalled a rhinoceros. He complained that it was rather indistinct ; he\nwas not sure whether it had horns or tusks. There is a certain interest\nin this as indicating that the hallucination was founded upon a mental\npicture suggested by my words, rather than on the words themselves.\nOne might have supposed that, since my whole suggestion consisted of\nthe word hippopotamus, the awakened subject, however vaguely he saw\nthe beast, would have known that it was meant for a hippopotamus.\nBut the picture, vague as it was, seemed to be more communicable\nfrom the hypnotic to the supraliminal self than the word which had\noriginally generated it. A picture was what had been ordered, and a\npicture came.\"\nThe same series of experiments furnishes a case where the suggested\nidea must have been clearly apprehended by the percipient, but where\npart of it failed to externalise itself so as to be consciously recognised. Mr.\nMyers told T. (hypnotised) that at Barnum's circus there was a race of\nponies with monkeys on their backs. T. was awakened and set to gaze into\na glass of water. He said, \" Look, there's something going round and\nround in the water . . . it's horses\u2014they're horses going round and\nround\u2014they've got something small on their backs, not so big as those girls\nwho jump through hoops. It's like a circus \" The idea was externalised as\na hallucination, but not clearly enough for the monkeys to be recognised as\nsuch. In many of the experiments tried by myself and Miss Johnson and\ndescribed in the same volume of the Proceedings (Vol. VIII.), similar\nindistinctness was exhibited in the initial stages of hallucinations which\nafterwards became clear. Here is one (p. 505, No. 19; in which there was\ninitial incomplete externalisation which ultimately developed itself on wrong\nlines.i I select it because it affords an example of arrested development due\nto the suggestion of physical limitations - tho edge of the card\u2014which is\nanalogous to what I suppose may be produced by the dim light in cases like\nDr. Jamieson's.

I should fancy it might be a geranium,\nbut there's only sticks, so you can't tell.\"\nHere again is an example with the same percipient in which an apparently\nclear hallucination is misinterpreted. It was intended that P. should see on\nhis blank card a picture of a choir boy. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 565,\nNo. 18). He said :\u2014\n\" Edge of card's going a dark colour.

It's not getting any better, it's fading\u2014no, it's\nstill there. It might frighten any one.\"\nSome more complicated and very amusing instances of misinterpretation\nwill be found among Mr. Myers' experiments before mentioned (Proceedings,\nVol. VIII, pp. 459-462).\nOf course in a case like Dr. Jamieson's it is impossible to determine at\nwhich of the first two stages the indefiniteness began. By hypnotising a\nperson who had just had an indefinite hallucination the subconscious\nimpression might be arrived at, but it would have to be done before\ncoincidence or any process of reflection had suggested an interpretation.\nLet us now return to Herr Parish's third objection, his hypothesis that\ncoincidental cases are remembered as waking hallucinations in greater\nproportion than non-coincidental cases. He is concerned first to establish\nthat, since sensory hallucinations occur only when the percipient is in a state\nof \" dissociation,\" there are, properly speaking, no such things as waking\nhallucinations at all. This appears to me to be a mere question of words.\nNo one probably would maintain that while a sensory hallucination is\nexperienced, the brain of the percipient is working in a perfectly normal\nway. We may, if we like, call its condition a condition of dissociation ; and\nthe question what characterises that condition besides the experiencing of a\nhallucination, and whether any physiological conditions special to sleep are\nalways present, is an interesting one for physiologists.2 We may further\nadmit with Mr. Gurney the psychological identity of dreams and waking\nhallucinations. \"One step farther,\" he says, \"and we realise the complete\ncontinuity of the waking and the sleeping phenomena. Dreams are by far\nthe most familiar instances of the projection by the mind of images that are\nmistaken for realities : indeed, it is just because they are so familiar, and\nwaking hallucinations comparatively so rare, that there is a danger of over\nlooking the psychological identity of the two classes.\" (Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. I., p. 484). We may even admit, as we do in Chapter IV. of\nthe Report, the difficulty in some cases of deciding whether they should be\ni The hypnotist.\n3 Herr Parish continually refers to the frequent absence of surprise or other\nappropriate emotion, when an apparition is seen, as evidence of a state of \" dissocia\ntion.\" This is one of the things that suggests a close connection between apparitions\nand dreams, but it does not necessarily suggest the physiological or psychological\ncondition of sleep.\n\fPart XXXIII.] 595\nReviews.\nclassed as waking or sleeping experiences. But all this is irrelevant as\nregards the present discussion. For it is not denied, even by Herr Parish,\nthat the percipient may not be aware, either at the time or afterwards, of\nhis condition of \"dissociation,\" so that the hallucination, though it really\noccurred when he was not fully awake, may leave in his recollection a kind\nof waking quality (Wachqualitiit). Or, as Herr Parish shortly expresses his\nview, \"Dream phenomena and waking hallucinations are in recollection\nquite different in character ; in reality, at the moment of their occurrence,\nthey are identical.\" (p. 24.) Now all that we are concerned with from the\nstatistical point of view is the percipient's classification of his experience.\nHe must, after it is over, and when he is in a completely wakeful and\nnormal state, attribute to it the waking quality, \u2014recollect and class it as a\nwaking hallucination. It was in order to avoid any begging of the very\nquestion Herr Parish raises, that, in collecting the statistics, we inquired\u2014\nnot as to the fact of the percipient's being awake when the hallucination\noccurred\u2014but as to his belief about it. Of course assurance is required that\nthe classification was made immediately ; that the percipient believed, as soon\nas he was able to reflect on the hallucination as a past experience, that he\nwas awake while it occurred and had not awoken from it ; and, in particular,\nin coincidental cases assurance is required that the waking quality was\nattributed to the experience before the coincidence was known. But this\nassurance is obtained by evidence of precisely the same kind as that which\nleads us to believe that the hallucination occurred at the time stated, or\nrepresented the person stated, or anything else about it.\nHerr Parish's contention is that the peculiar memory illusion involved in\nbelieving later that an experience was a waking hallucination which\nimmediately after its occurrence was classed as a dream, is.specially liable to\nbefall a dreamer after the knowledge of a coinciding external event has\nreached him. If he could establish this and if, further, he could show that\nwe had not taken sufficient precautions against this source of error, he would\nhave revealed a serious flaw in our evidence. But he has not attempted to\ndo so. All he has tried to show is\u2014what, as I have already said, is really\nirrelevant as regards evidence for telepathy\u2014that almost all the accounts\ngiven of supposed waking hallucinations suggest to some extent what he calls\n\"dissociation. ' For this purpose he takes, as a sample of the collection, the\ndeath coincidences given in Chapter XII. of the Report. i I propose, at the\nrisk of boring the reader, to follow him through these cases, with a view to\nshowing what the grounds are for believing that they were classed as waking\nhallucinations before the coincidence was known ; and incidentally to show\nthat there undoubtedly are hallucinations which occur when the percipient\nis in a condition which, whatever its physiological characteristics may be,\ni Herr Pariah, when he begins to discuss these cases (p. 27), rightly presents them\nas, from the point of view in question, an unselected group and therefore a fair\nsample of the whole. Later, at page 39, he seems less clear about this, claiming to\nhave proved the practical impossibility of distinguishing waking hallucinations from\ndreams \u2014not on doubtful cases on the margin (einzelue Grenzfiille und Beispiele\neines flussigen Uebergangs) but on the twenty-six best cases evidentially (best-\nbeglaubigten Fiille). But these twenty-six cases are those which seemed to the\nCommittee to be on the whole the best cases, evidentially, of death coincidences\u2014not\nthe twenty-six cases exhibiting most strikingly the waking quality.\n\f596 (Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\ndoes not, from the point of view of the percipient himself or those with him,\nresemble sleep or half sleep, or drowsiness.\nThe first case referred to is that of Mr. S. Walker Anderson (Re)>ort,\np. 211) who saw his aunt on the day of her death. Mr. Anderson was in\nbed, but as he believes fully awake. He distinguishes clearly between this\nexperience and others in which he does not think he was awake (Report,\np. 382). The experience led Mr. Anderson to believe that his aunt was\ndead and he mentioned this to his wife and they both made notes of the fact.\nIs it likely that, when some time later the news of the death came, this\nconfirmation of the anticipated coincidence should produce a memory\nillusion that what he had previously believed to be a dream was a waking\nhallucination I\nThis percipient had another experience\u2014not coincidental\u2014which is\nreferred to by Herr Parish. While crossing a river his horse was carried\ndown the stream unable to swim across ; he had given himself up for lost,\nwhen he saw his aunt standing on a floating tree. He felt the apparition to\nbe an indication that he was to leave the horse and seize hold of the tree,\nwhich he did, and was carried safe to the bank (Report, p. 382). Under\nsuch circumstances as these, could the percipient regard himself as having\nbeen otherwise than fully awake 1\nHerr Parish's next case is that of Mrs. J. P. Smith, (Report, p. 214). This\nis one of those cases near the line between waking and sleeping which we\nfound difficult to classify. The difficulty and the line adopted are discussed\nand illustrated in Chapter IV. of the Report, pp. 71, 72, where a very\nsimilar non-veridical case (729. 17) is given. The reason for adopting Mrs.\nSmith's classification of the experience as a waking hallucination is that she\ngot up and followed the figure out of the room. This detail is not likely to\nhave been introduced by a memory illusion when the coincidence became\nknown.\nThe third case discussed is Mrs. Baldwin's (Report, p. 217). Herr\nParish omits to mention that while the vision persisted Mrs. Baldwin\ndescribed it to her husband. Under these circumstances they could not\neither of them be expected to regard her as otherwise than awake. Herr\nParish may suggest that there was here a further memory illusion and that\nshe did not describe it to her husband at the time at all. To this I can only\nreply that I myself discussed the question with Mrs. Baldwin, that her\nmemory on the point was perfectly distinct, and that her daughter, whom I\nalso saw, had heard a similar account from her father, now dead.\nHerr Parish's fourth case is that of Madame Obalecheff. (Report, p. 218.)\nThat she was at the time awake in the ordinary sense of the word, and\nbelieved herself to have been so, is shown by her assumption that the\nservant was sharing her experience and by her asking her husband to\nexamine the adjoining room to make sure that her brother-in-law in person\nwas not there.\nThe next experience \u2014Miss S.R.R.'s (Report, p. 234)\u2014is an unusual one\nbecause of its persistency, or recurrence whenever, through the night, the\npercipient looked in a particular direction. The location of the figure in\na particular part of the room, and the sense of turning round to see it,\nseem to indicate a waking quality which it is gratuitous to suppose was\n\fPart XXXin.] 597\nReviews.\nimported into the experience afterwards ; especially as the conviction at the\ntime was clear that it meant that her sister was dead, so that the confirma\ntion of this would give no shock of surprise, or new importance to the\nexperience. The details, I may remark, are less confused and dreamlike\nthan Herr Parish supposes. He has not quite understood the narrative.\nThere is no mention in it of a bier (\"Bahre.\") Professor Sidgwick questioned\nthe percipient as to the position, etc., of the figure seen, with a view\nto ascertaining whether it was likely that the experience had been an illusion\n(which is what its persistence and the dim light suggested). He ascertained\nthat by her bed was a long chest (real, not hallucinatory) made of cedar\nwood ; that on this she first saw something white, which developed into a\nfigure of her sister lying dead in bed with her arm outside the bed clothes.\nThe chest had no covering of any kind on it which could have formed\nthe basis of an illusion of any ordinary kind ; the place of the bare\nchest was taken by a hallucinatory bed with the sister lying in it, her face\ndistinctly seen.\nThe next nine casesi may be taken together, as the facts supporting the\nview that the experience was at the time regarded as a waking one are in\neach case immediate action or immediate communication to another person.\nThus Mr. Beer \" was so disturbed [by the apparition] that he got up and\ntold a footman of it in an adjoining room.\" Dr. B. G. woke his wife, told\nher what he had seen and asked her to look at the watch. Mrs. C. S.\n\"pressed her [friend's] arm and whispered the fact and hour to her as a\nwitness to the truth of it.\" Mrs. A. immediately told another woman in\nthe room, who was talking to her at the time, what she had just seen (her\nfather's hand ) ; and her impression that a misfortune awaited her was so\nstrong that, though she had only that day arrived, she started on the return\njourney early the next morning. Mrs. Murray woke her husband, told\nhim whom she had seen, and he searched the room and house, to discover if\na real person had been there. In Mr. and Mrs. Sims' case the apparition is\nstated to have been collective ; they must therefore have compared notes\nand known at the time that they believed themselves to be awake. Mr.\nCass said to his wife at the time, \" my sister Isabella is dead, I have just\nseen her pass through the room.\" Miss J.E.L., after seeing her friend, got\nout of bed and looked at the hour ; it was between 6 and 7 o'clock. Mr.\nJ. H. woke his brothers who were sleeping in the same room with him, but\nthey could not see anything.\nHerr Parish then proceeds to consider a series of cases which he regards\nas strongly suggestive of Crystal-vision.* This may afford evidence of\n\"dissociation,\" but from our point of view it establishes the c.tses as waking\nhallucinations, for crystal-vision appears, both to the percipient and to those\nwith him, to be a waking experience. To these he adds cases where the\npercipient was sewing or reading,3 occupations which also, as a rule, betoken\ni 645 11, (p. 233); 725.6, (p. 237) ; 385.20, (p. 239) ; 579.25, (p. 211) ; 307.23,\n(p. 229) ; 418. 4, (p. 230) ; 523. 12, (p. 231) ; 215. 9, (p. 224) ; 630. 5, (p. 227).\n'\u25a0 Cases 571. 14, (p. 237) ; 452. 10 (second case), (p. 238) ; 328. 5, (p. 235) ; 191. 3\n(P 240).\n3 Cases 579. 24, (p. 223) ; 83. 21, -(p. 228) ; 730. 24, (p. 233) ; 442. 17, (p. 213).\n\f598 (Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nwhat is ordinarily called a waking condition ; moreover in each of them the\npercipient immediately spoke of the experience to a companion.\nHen- Parish thus establishes to his satisfaction reasons from internal\nevidence for suspecting \"dissociation\" in twenty-one out of twenty-six\ncases. I think that I may claim to have shown that whether there was\n\" dis-iociation \" or uot, the percipients classed their experiences as waking\nexperiences, and that the ground for believing that they did this before\nthd coincidence was known is in every case strong.\nHerr Parish believes that the fact that there are not similar indications\nof \"dissociation\" in the remaining five of the twenty-six cases is princi\npally due to the Committee not having specially inquired about such\nindications. If they had, he thinks indications would have been brought to\nlight in more cases. But so far as dissociation means absence of wakefulness,\nfacts bearing on it were very carefully inquired into by the Committee, for\nit was of extreme importance from the statistical point of view to know the\nbroad fact that the experiences had really the \" waking quality.\" Evidence\nabout the more subtle questions in the physiology and psychology of\nhallucinations must be obtained from experiments, and from critical\nobservations of their own experiences by intelligent observers. Many cases\npublished by the S.P.R., both in connection with the statistical inquiry\nreported in Volume X. of the Proceedings and otherwise, afford a valuable\ncontribution towards material for a study of the subject ; but to hope to\nelicit from informants reliable details about things to which their attention\nhad never beforo been drawn concerning experiences often remote, is futile.\nHerr Parish practically admits this, and is all the more pleased at having\nfound indications of \" dissociation \" in so many cases. What he\u2014rightly or\nwrongly\u2014regards as indications, however, are for the most part somewhat\nmarked facts about the percipient's position or occupation at the time of the\nexperience ; such as his having been in bed, or reading, or sewing. Facts\nsuch as these a percipient is likely to remember in connection with a striking\nexperience, and an account must bo meagre indeed which failed to answer\nthe Committee's question, \" How were you occupied at the time ? \" I\nrefer to this now because at this point of his argument (p. 38) Herr Parish\ngoes out of his way to introduce, as evidence of the influence of time in\nobliterating the circumstances accompanying hallucinations, a table in the\nReport which is differently interpreted by the Committee ; and his criticisms\nseem to call for some reply. The table is the one on p. 66 of the Report.\nIt shows that supposed apparitions of living persons of which the accom\npanying conditions exhibit one of three specified characteristics suggesting\nthat the figure seen may have been a real person and not a hallucination at\nall, are forgotten more rapidly than the mass of apparitions of living persons.\nHerr Parish thinks that it probably is not the whole experience, but the\nspecified accompanying circumstances which are forgotten. I cannot agree\nwith him\u2014not because I do not think that the memory of apparitions fades\nand loses in definiteness like the memory of other things\u2014 but because, for\none thing, the specified circumstances seem to me such as almost must be\nobserved and, if the experience is remembered at all, remembered. They arei\ni Rtp>rt, p. <>,\u00bb.\n\fPart XXXIII.] 599\nReviews.\n(1) the seeing of the figure at some distance either out of doors or in a\npublic room ; (2) seeing the figure passing outside the door of the room in\nwhich the percipient is, or seeing it inside a room as the percipient passes\nthe door ; (3) seeing it in a bad light, without any positive circumstances\nwhich show that a real person could not have been there. But secondly,\nthe Committee does not base its conclusion that cases having these\ncharacteristics are forgotten or ignored more than others only on their\noccurrence in smaller proportion in the reports of remoter years. This\nconclusion was strongly confirmed by finding that if cases having\nthese characteristics were omitted from among those that occurred\nwithin the last three months, the remainder were distributed fairly evenly\nover that period. So that, so far as the evidence went,i it seemed to show\nthat within that period almost the whole brunt of the effect of oblivion was\nborne by those cases. If this were not due to the experience being forgotten\n,or ignored as a whole, we should have to suppose that the very marked\nspecified characteristics were specially liable to be forgotten ; or rather\u2014as\nour percipients almost all describe some conditions\u2014mis-remembered. We\nshould have to suppose, for instance, that a person who had within the last\nthree months seen a supposed apparition at some distance out of doors would\nbe apt to remember it as having occurred in his room.\nThe question is chiefly of interest as bearing on the whole number of\nwaking hallucinations that occur. It does not materially affect our con\nclusions as to the evidence for telepathy. The argument for this may, if it is\npreferred, be based on the assumption that these \"suspicious\" cases are as\nreal as others, and the number of reported cases be multiplied by six and a-\nhalf instead of four as the correction for oblivion. (See Report, p. 247.)\nI now come to what Herr Parish considers to be his chief and most\nimportant objection to the argument from the census for the operation of\ntelepathy. It is, I think, fairly represented in my description of it at the\nbeginning of this article. The content of a hallucination may be due to\nassociation of ideas, and if this possibility be not excluded, and it is\npractically impossible to exclude it, we are not justified in attributing the\nhallucination to a telepathic impact. He states his general principle in a\nmore comprehensive form thus : \" If the content of a hallucination can be\ntraced to certain content-forming elements, it is not legitimate to regard the\nhallucination as the outcome of another heterogeneous chain of causes\"\n(p. 40). He adds, however, that our Committee has endeavoured to show\nthat there are cases where certain content-forming factors,\u2014e.g., anxiety and\nverbal suggestion\u2014are excluded, or can be shown to afford an insufficient\nexplanation. But, strange to say, they have overlooked one factor, namely,\nassociation of ideas. He attributes this strange oversight to a want of a\nclear perception of the distinction between the circumstances which produce\nthe condition in which a hallucination is liable to occur and the circumstances\nwhich determine the content of the hallucination. Anxiety about a person\ni If the Committee had been dealing here with a sufficient number of cases to\nmake it certain that the element of chance was excluded, the inference drawn would\nhave been an established fact. What prevents our accepting the conclusion as a\ncertainty is not any weakness in the reasoning, but the small number of cases to\nwhich it is applied.\n\f600 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidg wick.\nwho is ill may operate both as n hallucination-favouring condition and as a\ndeterminant of the form of a hallucination. It thus naturally attracted\nattention ; while association of ideas\u2014which cannot cause hallucinations, but\nonly determine the content\u2014did not. This Herr Parish thinks the more\nunfortunate, as in his view it is the content of the hallucination alone\nthat we are concerned with in the numerical comparison of coincidental and\nnon-coincidental cases.\nTo a member of the Committee, and I venture to think to most careful\nreaders of the Report, all this is very surprising. We were under the\nimpression that throughout Chapters VI. and X. the effect of the percipient's\nideas on the form of the hallucination was constantly urged on the attention\nof the reader ; that instances of the same thing occurred and were considered\nin other chapters ; and moreover that the very instances quoted by Heir\nParish to illustrate the effect of association of ideas are quoted and referred\nto in the Report in the same connection.\nTo me it seems probable that association of ideas plays at least some part\nin the construction of every hallucination. Even when there is good reason\nto attribute the fundamental idea of the hallucination\u2014the idea of the person\nseen -to telepathy, the attitude and dress and the apparent position of the\nfigure in space seem generally to be due to association of ideas. The grounds\nfor thinking so seem to me to be strong\u2014what evidence there is for reciprocal\naction between agent and percipient and for telepathic clairvoyance notwith\nstanding- if we consider on the one hand (1) the extremely meagre amount\nof information conveyed, as a rule, to the percipient by a telepathic\nhallucination, and (2) the way the hallucination fits into his ordinary\nsurroundings ; and on the other hand the role obviously played in hypnotic\nhallucinations by association of ideas working on the ideas originally put into\nthe percipient's mind by the hypnotiser.\nBut interesting and important as is the effect of association of ideas on\nhallucinations, it has no bearing on the question whether the coincidence\nof apparitions with the death of the person seen can be attributed to chance\nor whether, on the contrary, there is a causal connection between the\ndeath and the hallucination. In the first place we are not concerned only\nwith the content of the hallucination ; we are concerned with the hallucma\ntion and its content. In the second place Herr Parish's general principle\ncannot be maintained. The known existence of one series of causes leading\nup to an event does not exclude the operation of another series of causes,\nunless the first series can be shown to be absolutely necessary and sufficient\nunder all conditions. The fact that we caught a catarrh by sitting in a\ndraught does not prevent the catarrh being due to a microbe. If we can\nshow that a certain microbe is capable under favourable conditions of\nproducing catarrh, and that when catarrh occurs the microbe is always\npresent in the organism, then the connection of microbe and catarrh is\nestablished, and a strong presumption that the microbe is necessary to the\ncatarrh. If we can further show that sitting in a draught is followed by\ncatarrh much more often than would happen by chance, it follows that there\nmust be a causal connection between sitting in a draught and a catarrh. It\nis not necessary, in order to prove this, that sitting in a draught should always\nbe followed by catarrh, nor that a catarrh should invariably be preceded by\n\fPart XXXra.] 601\nReviews.\nthe sitting in a draught ; nor is it necessary that we should know how the\ndraught tends to produce the catarrh. Moreover, if the draught is a vera\ncan&a of the catarrh in certain cases, it follows that, unless the draught\nintroduces the microbe into the organism, the microbe is not by itself and\nunconditionally a sufficient cause of the catarrh. It must have favourable\nconditions, and the draught is one way among others in which the favourable\nconditions are brought about. Similarly if visual hallucinations coincide\nwith the death of the person seen much more often than would happen1 by\nchance, there must be some causal connection between the two events. This\nis all that the statistical inquiry attempts to prove ; and this conclusion is\nnot affected by any number of other conditions which may be found necessary\nor favourable to the production of visual hallucinations representing recog\nnised human beings.\nBut I need not reiterate this. Herr Parish does not in fact deny it,\nthough in some of his reasoning he seems to do so. On page 45 he\ngives us his real conclusion, which is that, as it is not legitimate to\nassume a causal connection between the death and the hallucination, we\nmust turn the statistical argument round. We must assume that if, as the\nCommittee concluded after allowing for selection and exaggeration,i thirty\ndeath coincidences occurred among the experiences of 17.0002 informants,\nthen, gince 1 in 19000 is the number of such coincidences that chance would\nproduce, the real number of apparitions of living persons seen must have\nbeen 19000 x 30 or 570000. As therefore, they report only 350, 569650, or\n1627 out of every 1628, must have been forgotten or ignored. This, it will\nbe observed, involves the almost immediate forgetting of a large proportion\nof the waking hallucinations that occur. The experiences are distributed\nover thirty years, so that in Herr Parish's view they occurred at the rate of\n19,000 per annum, and of 19000 divided by 26, or approximately 730, per\nfortnight. Now the number of visual hallucinations of all kinds (not only\napparitions of living persons) reported byv our informants as having occurred\nto them within the most recent fortnight is twelve ; 3 they must therefore,\non Herr Parish's supposition, have forgotten or ignored at least 718, \u2014or\nmore than 98 percent, of those which had occurred to them a fortnight or\nless before they were asked if they had ever experienced one !\nIf Herr Parish finds himself able to adopt so extravagant a conclusion\nthere is no more to be said. But why did he take the trouble to write this\nlong and elaborate criticism ?\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\ni The number reported was 62. Herr Parish on p. 15 of his pamphlet attributes\nthe Committee's reduction of sixty-two death coincidences to thirty to allowance for\nselection by the collectors. The Committee, however, for reasons given by them,\nregard eight as an ample allowance for this possible source of error, and allow\ntwenty two, also for reasons given, for possible exaggeration by the percipients as to\nthe closeness of the coincidence, etc. (See Report, pp. 242-3).\n2 Herr Parish prefers to operate at this point of his argument with round numbers\n\u201420,000 informants, 50 coincidences, 500 apparitions of the living\u2014but I have thought\nit more convenient to adhere to the actual numbers.\n2 See Report, p. 63.\n\f602 William Romaine Newbold. [Supplement.\nDemon Possession and Allied Themes. By John L. Nbvius, D.D. Edited by\nHenry W. Rankin. Second Edition, F. H. Revell Co., 1896, pp. 520.\nDr. Nevius was for forty years a missionary in China. Early in his\nministry he found that demon possession is a common occurrence among the\nChinese and although he was able to observe in person one case only, he\nsucceeded in collecting a large amount of information about the phenomena\nand the construction put upon them by the natives. This material forms\nthe basis of the book in hand.\nA few illustrations will serve to give a conception of its general\ncharacter. The second case is that of a mountaineer, Kwo by name, who\ngives an account of his own experiences. He had been arranging for the\nhousehold worship of the Goddess Wang-Muniang, when one night he\ndreamed that the goddess appeared to him and announced that she had\ntaken up her abode in his house. This was followed after the lapse of a\nfew days by a feeling of restlessness coupled with an irrational impulse\nto gamble ; his mind became confused, memory was impaired. He was\nthen seized by an epileptiform attack, to which succeeded mania with\nhomicidal impulses. The \"demon\" proclaimed its presence, demanded\nworship. Upon compliance with its demands it departed. For some\nmonths the \"demon\" reappeared at intervals, promised to heal disease.\nKwo notes that \" many diseases were not under its control, and it seemed as\nif it could perfectly cure only such as were inflicted by spirits \"\u2014a significant\nremark. When the sufferer became a Christian, the \" demon \" disappeared\nsaying \"This is no place for me.\"\nCase 3 is narrated by a native Christian. He described the patient as\n\"sitting up, her eyes closed, with a fluttering motion of the eyelids, her\ncountenance like one weeping and the fingers of both hands tightly clenched.\nShe would allow no one to straighten her closed fingers. I then, hardly\nexpecting an answer, as the woman had hitherto been speechless, said to the\ndemon : ' Have you no fear of God ? Why do you come here to afflict this\nwoman 1 ' To this I received instantly the following reply :\n' Tien-pu Yia-su puh Kwan an,\nWo tsai che-li tsih pa nian,\nNi iao nien wo, nan shang nan,\nPi iao keh wo pa-shin ngan.'\n(Translation)\n' God and Christ will not interfere. I have been here seven or eight years :\nand I claim this as my resting place. You cannot get rid of me.'\" This\npatient was relieved by prayer.\nIn several instances the \" demon \" claims identity with the spirit of some\ndeceased human being. Thus in case 24 a bride on her wedding night was\nseized by what purported to be the spirit of a girl to whom her husband had\nbeen engaged, and who had drowned herself on account of the ill-treatment\nof her future mother-in-law. In other cases the \" demon \" claims to be one\nof the lower animals\u2014e.g. in one which occurred in Japan,\u2014page 105\u2014it\nprofessed itself a fox.\nThe entire collection gives a most interesting glimpse of Chinese spiritism.\nWe find the cult of spirits a recognised institution. \" Physical phenomena \"\n\fPart XXXIII ] C03\nReviews.\nare alleged to be matters of daily occurrence. Every village has its\n\"medium.\" The \"developing stance\" has its counterpart (page 07). The\nmedium sometimes goes into \"quiet trance,\" and sometimes communication\nwith the unseen world is effected by means of an instrument essentially\nidentical with planchette (pages 48, 69).\nEvidence of this sort is not without its value as going to show that\nspiritism is a growth indigenous to many countries, that it i3 a plausible\ninterpretation of phenomena which occur spontaneously among all races and\nis not merely a mass of imposturo based upon the \" Rochester knockings \"\nand peculiar to the last half of the nineteenth century. No one who believes\nthat the natural basis of such a belief deserves thorough investigation will\nrefuse to Dr. Nevius and his friend and editor, Mr. Henry \\V. Rankin, the\ngratitude due them for having put a mass of new information within reach.\nBut if one goes further and asks what Dr. Nevius has done towards\nvindicating the popular interpretation of these phenomena, the reply cannot\nbut be unfavourable.\nEvery page bears witness to the author's desire to be exact in description,\nunbiassed in interpretation, and just in criticism ; it is rather his misfortune\nthan his fault that he has fallen so far short of the mark in all three respects.\nPractically all his material rests upon the evidence of native\u2014Chinese or\nMongolian\u2014witnesses. All are fully convinced of the diabolical origin of\nthe phenomena, and without in the least impugning their good faith, we can\nscarcely accept their accounts as literally true and uncoloured by precon\nceptions. Such evidence can scarcely do more than supply illustrations of\nfacts already independently established.\nOf alleged supernormal phenomena the book is almost barren. One case\nof a \" Poltergeist\" rests solely upon the evidence of Mongolians, whom the\nmissionary transmitting the account stigmatises as \"so imbued, one and all,\nwith the spirit of lying that I have found it useless to repeat what the most\nrespectable say.\" In a few other cases it is claimed that the demoniac was\npossessed of supernormal knowledge and of the gift of healing, but no\ndefinite facts are given. It is consequently somewhat surprising to find\nDr. Nevius claiming (page 190) that the possession of supernormal knowledge,\nand especially of the power of speaking languages unknown to the patient,\nis a differentiating mark of demon-possession as distinguished from hystero-\nepileptic disorders.\nDr. Nevius's interpretation cf the facts is what might be expected of a\nman of his antecedents. His creed already required of him a belief in the\nperson and work of devils, and his experiences in China seem to have done\nno more than bring this intellectual assent to events of the past down into\nthe realm of vivid conviction as to the happenings of the present. That once\ndone his credulity is almost unlimited. He assents to the view of the early\nfathers that pagan divinities are but devils in disguise. Mohammed was a\ndemoniac. The \" bewitched \" of Western Europe were demoniacs, inspired\nby the devil to utter false accusations against the innocent. \" All his\n(Satan's) attributes as a deceiver, a liar, a murderer, and a false accuser,\nl oappear conspicuously in this one transaction \" (page 309). So of modern\n\"Spiritualism,\" the marvels of which he seems to accept without serious\nquestion.

The negative results of such an investigation as that of the\nSeybert Commission of the University of Pennsylvania are to be explained\nupon the hypothesis that \" it is hardly reasonable to suppose that these\ndemons would voluntarily, gratuitously and without restraint, submit them\nselves to an examination which might only serve to disclose their actual\ncharacter\" (page 317).\nDr. Nevius's criticism of other theories brings his limitations even more\nclearly to light. He refuses to group possession with the hystero-epilepsies\non the ground that in possession we have secondary personalities and super\nnormal knowledge, whereas in merely pathological disorders we never find\neither. He does not seem to have understood the attempts to explain the\nphenomena upon psychological principles and, after giving a few quotations\nfrom James, Myers, Ribot, and Moll, contents himself with remarking, in\neffect, that these authorities do not agree and their explanations do not\nexplain. Of the epoch-making work of Pierre Janet, Binet and their\nco-workers he says nothing, and seems ignorant of the phenomena of\nsuggestion, especially of the psychical contagion that springs from collective\nor mass-suggestion. This is the line of work which has brought to light the\ngraded series of phenomena between those of normal life and those of\npossession, amoking and the like.\nDr. Xevius failed to see that the evidence which is sufficient to bring a\nmass of phenomena under an accepted category may be wholly insufficient\nto establish the category. The evidence which he has collected may be\nsubsumed under several categories with equal ease, but there is nothing in\nthe evidence to determine us to the choice of the spiritistic rather than of\nanother. That must be done by the more complex considerations that fix\nfor each man his attitude towards the Universe.\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\n[November Ulh, 1896.]\nStudies in Psychical Research. By Frank Podmore, M.A. London : Kegan\nPaul, Trench, Triibner, & Co. New York : G. P. Putnam's Sons.\n1897. pp. 458.\nMr. Podmore is, of course, responsible for his own conclusions in his\nwork on the results attained, so far, by the Society for Psychical Research.\nHe shines therefore with no borrowed light in \"explanations.\" While\nsympathising with his determined efforts to keep things at their lowest level,\nto make the largest allowances for the mythopoeic element in our fallen\nnature, I think that Mr. Podmore is too mythopoeic himself. All our\ntheories of all obscure processes or facts are essentially myths, stories\nwhich we tell ourselves in our attempt to account for the world. But we\nknow that our theories are myths, till they are verified, and, if we are not\nspiritists, we keep the animistic element out of our explanations. Now\nMr. Podmore's explanations of a number of alleged facts, or rather his\nexplanation of \"how such stories came to be told,\" do seem to me to be\nmyths not verified, and, I fancy, perhaps not verifiable. He is none the\nless mythopoeic because his inventions coincide in character with those of\n\fPart XXXIII.] 605\nMeviews.\nirresponsible common sense. Examples will be given when we come to the\nchapters on Home, and on the Poltergeist. There Mr. Podmore seems to\nme to be sacrificing to common sense, which wants an explanation, and a\nnormal explanation, and does not care whether it is verifiable, or even\nplausible or not. Why did we Researchers come forth from the world to\nhunt dark corners, if we are to carry the superstitions of the world into our\nresearches 1 Our attitude, I think, should be that of pure agnosticism in\ncases where all is obscure. There are the stories of marvels filed for\nreference. If we meet with modern instances, we can compare them with\nthe records ; meanwhile, we can only explain the tales by unverifiable\nguesses, whether \"psychical,\" \"spiritual,\" or \"sensible.\" It is much\nbetter, surely, not to fashion such etiological myths, not to \"pay ourselves\nwith words.\"\nMeanwhile I offer some jottings on Mr. Podmore's chapters. I believe\n(p. 1) that \" hospitality to the marvellous\" is more, not less, general than\n\"in Dr. Johnson's day.\" The mere existence of the Society is a proof of\nthat. The general mass of the \"educated public\" is \"hospitable,\" and\nalways has been, in regard to stories of experiences. But the general public\nhas no inkling whatever of the trend of such stories in regard to philosophy.\nMen of physical science, as a rule, merely refuse to examine alleged facts,\nfirst, because, in the nature of the case, experiments in human faculty are\nincapable of constant and exact repetition in experiment ; secondly, because\nan affirmative conclusion would upset a number of theories which are\nregarded with an almost theological jealousy. Moreover there are one or\ntwo awful examples of the debasing effect which psychical research produces\nin scientific minds, whether the controversialists take the affirmative or\nnegative side. But this ought only to teach scientific men the imperative\nduty of cultivating logic, accuracy, and self-restraint. Meanwhile we\nResearchers are a little flock, engaged in quite novel work. In the last, and\nearly in the present century, Kant, Hegel, Schelling, and, I think, Fichte,\n\" went into these things a good deal.\" But Kant turned away with a sneer\nand a sigh, while Hegel calmly swallowed the whole mass of \" facts \" (except\nperhaps phantasms of the dead, and volatile furniture) and digested them\nby aid of his vast boa-constrictor of an universal philosophy. He was\nreckless of exact evidence, being convinced in his own mind. Our\nobject of course, is to get the facts fit to go to a jury, before we\nphilosophise. Nevertheless Mr. Myers's \"subliminal self\" deserves com\nparison with Hegel's fnhlende Seele, both in its points of resemblance and of\ndifference.\nMr. Podmore has easy sport with popular spiritualism, about which\nnothing need be said here. The movement, at best, produced examples of\npsychological anomalies, which were naturally ascribed to \" spirits,\" and it in\ncidentally encouraged the art of detecting imposture. Gasparin's experiments\nhiissent a ddsirer in accuracy, Mr. Podmore thinks, and then we come to Home,\nLord Crawford, and Sir W. Crookes. I have no theory of Home, but\nMr. Podmore \"explains\" by dint of what I call myths. He is \"not\nprepared with any cheap and ready solution of the problem,\" yet he offers\nsolutions marvellously inexpensive. \" The witnesses wero to some extent\nhallucinated.\" Why all in the same way ? By communicated \" suggestions,\"\n2 k 2\n\fCO6 Supplement.\nAndrew Lang.\nI presume. There is, (1) Home's fire tricks. He \" really took live coals\nout of the fire, and possibly on some occasions held them in his hand,\nprotected by some non-conducting substance.\" This \"substance\" is a\nmyth of Queen Entelechy ! What substance ? We might as well posit a\nspirit as talk of a \"substance\" unknown to science. Sir W. Crookes\nanalysed the handkerchief which did not burn (much) when Home put a hot\ncoal on it, and found no \"non-conducting substance.\" He knows of no\nsuch substance in rentm natura. (Proceedings VI., 103). Perhaps\nHome \"palmed\" another handkerchief? Then he had been thoughtful\nenough to provide the substituted fogle with three similar, and\nsimilarly situated, slight marks of burning. Certainly, were I Sir W.\nCrookes, I could not swallow Mr. Podmoro's explanation. Then how did\nHome get his non-conducting substance on to the hands of Lord Crawford\nand others, who could usually, but not always, take the coals with impunity\nfrom Home ? An acquaintance of mine retains the mark of the blister.\nWas he so hallucinated that fancy produced a blister ; a beautiful case\nfor MM. Binet and F\u00e9r6? Till Mr. Podmore exhibits his \"non-conducting\nsubstance,\" he ranges in pure mythology. As for the fire trick, the\nFijians did it publicly, in September, 1897, before a crowd of spectators\nfrom New Zealand. I may here refer to a mass of evidence in the chapter\non \" The Fire Walk \" in my Modern Mythology. But I fear nobody will\ntake the trouble to look at it ; one is as a vox clamanti* in eremo. (2) \"When\nlevitated, Home at least thrust his head and shoulders out of the window.\"\n(p. 121.) If he did, the three spectators could not see him do so through a\nbrick wall ! Home was in the next room, and returned to that where the\nspectators were by way of the window, seventy feet from the ground,\n(p. 52.) He then went out and in again, in the next room, to which the\nspectators had adjourned. Mr. Podmore has to imagine that three men of\nsense, Lord Crawford, Lord Adare, and Captain Wynne, were so \"excited\"\nthat, when Home thrust his head out of window A, (which was to them\ninvisible,) they all three believed they saw his whole body outside of window\nB, and that they then went to window B, in the next room, and fancied\nthey saw Home emerge longitudinally, and re-enter. There is no use in\nciting here the illusions of \" hypnotised boys ; \" these gentlemen had not\nbeen hypnotised. Their \" strained expectation \" could not see through a\nbrick wall, and enable them to infer, in all cases, the same hallucinatory\nconclusions from what they saw. And if one of the three spectators was\ncapable, as is alleged, of hallucinatory experiences, how did he communicate\nthem to his friends ? Of course you may say \"suggestion,\" or \" chimera\nhombinans. \" Obviously it should be proved, by experiment, that precisely\nthis sort of suggestion is possible in persons not subjected definitely to\nhypnotism. Mr. Podmore's explanations (tentative of course) seem to me\nmyths, and I must keep asking him to produce that \"non-conducting\nsubstance.\" When Home was \" levitated \" or did fire tricks, \" the light in\nthe room was lessened.\" The light in the fire trick was given by a candle on\nthe table, and one on the chimney piece, and by the fire. That is enough\nlight whereby to see a man standing not a foot from you, with a red hot\ncoal in his hands. Home also \" passed his fingers several times through the\ncandle flame so slowly that they must have been severely burnt under\n\fPartXXXHL] G07\nReviews.\nordinary circumstances.\" He anticipated Bernadette and the Miracle de\nCierge. A candle would give light enough to see that by ! Again, \" when\nthe gas was turned up,\" objects moved, while Home was \"at a distance and\nhis hands held.\" Alteration of weights was registered by a mechanical\napparatus on smoked glass.\nThere are two other points to be urged against Mr. Podmore's theory\nthat observers of Home were hallucinated. The Society's records contain\nplenty of \"collective, so-called telepathic hallucinations.\" But surely these\nhallucinations offered visionary figures of persons and things not present in\nfact. Has Mr. Podmore one case, except Home's, of a collective hallucination\nin which a person actually present is the hallucination ; floats in air, holds\nred-hot coals, and so forth,\u2014appears outside of the window, for instance,\nwhen ho is inside the room ? Of course where conjuring is barred. Again,\nHome's marvels are attested by witnesses violently prejudiced against him,\nand (far from being attentively expectant) most anxious to detect and\nexpose him. Mr. Hamilton Aid\u00e9 is an example. Mr. Podmore's theories\ndo not give to himself much \"mental satisfaction.\" They are not calculated\nto do so. It would be better to leave such explanations to popular\nscience, and to admit that we are confronted by an enigma which we\nhave no present means of answering. The performances of Mr. Moses are\ndifferent. These things were \"done in a corner.\" The \"alleged spirit\nmessages\" of Mr. Moses, under Mr. Podmore's criticism, are seen to have\nno evidential cogency. The sprites rap out a story which has been in the\nDaily Telegraph, or in an old Annual Register ! This makes one entertain\nthe most lurid opinions about Mr. Moses's \" physical phenomena.\" Perhaps\nhe was only a humbug in a subliminal sense, when not quite himself. I am\nacquainted with a parallel case of combined imposture and self-belief in\nquite a different field,\u2014I am not speaking of politics. The thing can exist,\nand that Mr. Moses was an example of the double mood is less incredible\nthan that his miracles were genuine. Believing this, why do I remain\nagnostic in Home's case ? Merely because Home's marvels were infinitely\nbetter observed and recorded than those of Mr. Moses.\nAs to the Poltergeist, Mr. Podmore's explanation of his first case seems\nto me on a level with his \"non-conducting substance.\" The reader should\ncompare Mr. Podmore's original version in Proceedings. There he abandons\nthe hypothesis of \" mechanical means.\" And if the \"agent\" was \"a half\nwitted child of an imbecile mother,\" how could she do what could not be\ndone by mechanical means ? Is Mr. Podmore sure that the child was\nhalf-witted ? And, if so, would that explain the first abnormal occurrence,\nwhen the child had not yet been received into the house ? The child was\naged eighteen. The thing began on February 20. or 21, and became a pest\non March 1. Mr. Podmore was not on the spot till April 7. But he does\nnot print the contemporary newspaper accounts, so that we may compare\nthem with evidence collected on April 7. I have compared them, and very\ncurious they are. The discrepancies in testimony at that date are exactly\nsuch as occur in all human evidence in the most ordinary affairs of life.\nWere they absent, we might be certain that the witnesses were in a concerted\neffort to deceive. If a policeman attests that he saw a bowl wobble slowly\nup into the air (as in this case), my judicial powers remain at a standstill.\n\f608 [Supplement.\nAndrew Lang.\nBut when this peculiar kind of movement is described by a consensus of\nindependent evidence in many lands and ages, I cannot fly to \"hallucina\ntion \" for a theory, like Mr. Podmore, or to \"sensory illusion, conditioned\nby tho excited state of the percipient. \" If he is right, we have a new law of\nperception, \"Podmore's Law,\" \" percipients in an excited condition will see\ninanimate objects meandering with a mazy motion through air.\" Let me add\nthat they will also feel and hear the objects descend softly and gently on\nthemselves, or on the floor. How does \" excitement \" here, and now, and\nin the seventeenth century, in America, Germany, Russia, France, or in\nGalloway, produce this unanimity of hallucinated perception? It affects\nSir W. Crookes and his friends, as it affected Mr. Telfer, of Rerrick, or\nWilliam Morse, of New England, in 1680-90, or every one at Cideville,\nin 1851, exactly as it affected Policeman Higgs. White calls in that active\nand intelligent officer ; \" Here's a jolly turn up in my house,\" says he.\nThereon tho excited Higgs, with everybody present, is hallucinated exactly\nlike our historical friends, or Sir W. Urookes, or Mr. Bristow when examining\nwith a good deal of care, during six weeks, some odd phenomena in a\ncarponter's shop (Proceedings VII., 383-394). All these witnesses were un\nacquainted with the reports by Telfer, Glanvil, Cotton, and the rest. Their\ncoincidence of testimony, to which I may add some given to myself by a person\nwho was in no state of excitement at all, seems, prima facie, rather evidence\nto facts than proof of Mr. Podmore's Law. I allude here to the testimony of\na man who employed Esther Teed, the \"'Amherst Mystery,\" and who, while\nengaged in his normal stable and thinking of no such matter, beheld the\nphenomena attributed by Mr. Podmore to \"a sensory illusion conditioned by\nan excited state.\" This explanation wins its way to the mythical. Every\none must agree that the Poltergeist kind of occurrence is often the result of\ntrickery, but cases like that at Worksop remain, I think, to be pigeon\nholed for reference. Perhaps the most interesting point is the coincidence\nof testimony as to the peculiar flight of objects. It either attests a fact of\nobservation ; or proves that \" excitement \" is wonderfully uniform in its\nproduction of sensory illusions. The discovery of this psychological law\nwould alone deserve high consideration for Mr. Podmore's book. But we\ncannot test the law till the S.P.R. succeeds in catching a poltergeist in active\nbusiness, and does not arrive the day after the fair. Indeed I regard this\nsecular uniformity of evidence to the non-natural movements of objects as\nthe best ground for supposing that something odd has really sometimes\noccurred. The idea of expectant \" excitement \" must be dismissed in cases of\nhostile witnesses, like Alphonse Karr and Mr. Aide. Excitement could not\nlast through six weeks' experience of floating bits of wood, in Mr. Bristowe's\ncase. My informant in whose family Esther Teed was a servant was not\nexcited or expectant. \"Suggestion,\" as producing identity of collective\nhallucination, is excluded when the witnesses are of different lands and\nages, all unaware of the same evidence previously given by others to the\nsame set of facts. The Marquis de St. Victor never heard, we may be sure,\nof the Rev. Alexander Telfer, and probably Sir W. Crookes was not\nconsciously in the same tale with William Morse. The idea that the members\nof Sir W. Crookes's party unconsciously adapted their memories into\nuniformity is checked by the notes made during the seance ; and Morse, in\n\fPart XXXIII.l 609\nReviews.\nNew England, cannot have fitted his story to match Telfer's in Galloway.\nTherefore, either the events occurred as described, or fits of crazy percep\ntion, uniform in character, beset mankind whether excited or not excited.\nMr. Podmore is reduced, by facts, to the last form of explanation. It is\ncalculated to stagger common sense.\nOmitting Madame Blavatsky as exploded, we come to Experimental\nThought-transference, and transference of sensation, as in Hegel's work\nalready cited. The examples here given are familiar to readers of the\nProceeding, as are the \"Telepathic Hallucinations.\" Mr. Podmore seems\nrather to hanker after an explanation involving ether and the nervous\nsystem. Mr. Podmore's Theory of Ghosts is already well known. It\ndraws heavily on any balance which Telepathy may have at the bank,\nand Mr. Myers's reply seems telling. But the subject is obscure, and\na larger collection of facts is necessary. As to \"haunted houses\" and\n\"expectancy,\" expectancy is too often a failure, alas, and ghosts \"come\nnot by observation.\" For the present Mr. Podmore \"can but regard\"\npremonitions \"as the sports of chance.\" I could add a good deal, and\nmay do so later, to his evidenco for clairvoyance, but the facts would\nbe set down to Telepathy. Mrs. Piper has a faint kind of charm for\nMr. Podmore. But as we know that her Dr. Phinuit tries to cheat (how\never honest Mrs. Piper may be in her normal state), I put no trust in his\nrevelations.\nI have dwelt on my differences from Mr. Podmore, which amount to\nlittle more than a distaste for \" explanations\" like those which he tentatively\noffers. To take a case apart from his work :\u2014A. made certain arrangements\ndeeply affecting the common interests of himself and B. B. had a surmise,\naccidentally caused, that some arrangements had been made. A. died ; B.\ndreamed a vision of a mass of details, all unknown to him, some of which\nwere, while others could not possibly be known to A. The dream was\naccurate. These facts a philosopher of my acquaintance explains by saying\nthat A. had told B. the details, but B. had not listened. The fact that the\ndetails were of the highest interest to B., (who did not listen to them), and\nthat the essential details were unknown to any one not omniscient,\u2014lying, as\nthey did, in the future,\u2014makes no difference to my friend. His explanation\npleases him vastly. We shall not make much progress while philosophers\ninsist on explanations, and are satisfied with their own conjectures.\nMy friend, to assist my comprehension of his hypothesis (sub-conscious\nknowledge brought to consciousness in a dream), told me the old yarn of the\nservant girl who talked Hebrew. I asked for the evidence to the fact.\nThere was no evidence ; but then, said my friend, \"philosophy had only to\nexplain facts.\" There is not much use in explaining a fact which probably\nnever occurred. There are times when one despairs of human reason, for if\nthese things are done by professors of philosophy, what must we expect\nfrom the educated public ? The real use of psychical research is its value in\nenabling us to understand the system of paying ourselves with words. We\nmay discover no \" psychical \" laws, but we are compelled to tear up a world\nof prevalent logical fallacies.\nAndrew Lano.\n\f610 [Supplement.\nJames H. Rydop.\nTelepathy and the Subliminal Self. By R. Osoood Mason, A.M., M.D.,\nFellow of the New York Academy of Medicine, 8vo, pp. 343. New\nYork : Henry Holt and Company, 1897.\nPsychical research still continues to have its advocates, and they come\nfrom a source that is not unworthy of the cause. Dr. Mason represents\nthe medical profession, and thus an interest that might be more widely\ncultivated among his compeers could individuals declare their independence\nof certain scientific superstitions in the matter. Physicians are specially\nwell situated to study exceptional phenomena, \u2014I shall not say abnormal, \u2014\nlike those classified for psychical research, because they are presumably\nconnected with the conditions and opportunities for their occurrence.\nPerhaps this implies that they are abnormal and thus unworthy of any\nother attention than to be prevented by therapeutics. This I would not\ngrant of all of them, even if it be true of any or a small portion of them.\nBut suppose that they are to be labelled with the suspicion of being\npathological, what difference does this make I Are they to be discarded on\nthat account, or to pass under the insinuation that they have no such value\nas is claimed for them simply because they are associated with pathological\nconditions ? This can be denied, and a most effective case made out for the\nclaim that many, if not the most, of the phenomena sheltered under the\nname of psychical research are connected with as normal conditions as our\ncustomary thoughts and experiences and not more impugnable than they on\nthe ground 0f pathology. But Dr. Mason does not discuss this question,\nthough it would be open to a physician, if not obligatory in his situation, to\nthresh out this subject for the satisfaction of those who see that no regard is\npaid to the principles involved in such a contention when the diagnosis of\npathological cases depends upon the testimony of pathological cases, and for\nthe discomfiture of those who would make psychiatry impossible by their\nassumptions. I should like to have seen a physician like Dr. Mason handle\nthis subject as it needs and deserves to be. But he has chosen to discuss\nthe general phenomena and problems of psychical research, as data for\nprofounder theories of psychology than those depending solely upon the\nmore universal events of experience.\nDr. Mason has covered the whole field of psychical research in his\ndiscussion, and in a much more scientific way than most of the popular\ntreatises on such phenomena in the past, though I shall have occasion, before\nconcluding, to point out some defects which the thorough scientific mind\nwould remark in his treatment. But he has gone briefly over the topics of\ntelepathy or thought-transference, hypnotism, clairvoyance, duplex person\nality, natural somnambulism, and dreams, automatism, planchette, automatic\ndrawing and writing, crystal gazing, and phantasms. These constitute\na rather large subject for so small a book, though the matter illustrating\nthem is admirably abbreviated ; a fault for science but not for the general\nreader who is interested in conclusions and not in evidential details. Most\nof the facts or alleged facts are taken from the Proceedings of the Societyfor\nPsychicnl Research, but some are from Dr. Mason's own experience and\ninvestigations, and have also been put on record in a completer form with\nthe Society. The style of treatment is fair and judicious, and governed by\nthe consciousness of what has to be met in converting scientific minds to an\n\fPart XXXIII. 611\nReviews.\ninterest in the subject, even when the author does not supply the conditions\nfor securing that conversion. There is sobriety in the discussion and balance\nof judgment, as all must admit even when they do not agree with the author\nin the speculative value attaching to the alleged facts. Dr. Mason does not\ncommit himself to any theory of these phenomena except that of telepathy,\nif that be called a theory, and possibly that of clairvoyance, though the\ndistinction between cases that can be explained by telepathy and those which\ncannot, but which require clairvoyance, is not as clearly stated as might be.\nDr. Mason also makes a wide use of automatism to explain cases which many\npersons bring under the class of spiritualistic phenomena. Dr. Mason is\nloth to admit that there are any evidences of spiritualism which absolutely\ndemand the abandonment of either telepathy, clairvoyance or automatism to\nexplain them. He does not deny the possibility of that doctrine ; on the\ncontrary, in the preface to the second edition of the book, which we are glad\nto see has been issued, he mentions with some gratification that some persons\nhave felt that the facts discussed furnish much evidence for survival after\ndeath, though he protests that this was not the intention of the work. No\none could ask for more caution in the annunciation and defence of theories.\nThe work is largely a narrative of phenomena alleged to be facts, with a\nbearing upon the problem of supernormal human faculty.\nWhen it comes to critical remarks upon Dr. Mason's book, it is proper to\nsay that, in tho mind of the present reviewer, the work is much superior to\nHudson's Lam of Psychic Phenomena. Dr. Mason is far more judicious and\ndiscriminative in the selection of cases for illustration and proof. He has\nhad a definite regard to cases that are both more pertinent to his problem\nand more evidential in their origin, though it must be confessed that the\nevidence for their genuineness is not presented here in its fulness. But in\nspite of this omission, which was a concession to the popular reader, the\nselection of reported and original cases has some reference to the problem of\nevidence, which is not even raised in Hudson's book. The only fault that\ncan be found is that, on the one hand, this evidential feature is not so fully\nconsidered as science demands, and on the other, tho problems of mal-\nobservation, illusions of memory, and coincidental experiences have not\nbeen discussed, as they require to be in this connection.\nFor this defect there is no doubt some excuse in the fact that the\nobjections which tell against one case often have no weight against another.\nThis is to say that, even if one case like another is defectivo in evidence,\nthough still possibly a fact, the satisfaction of this demand by tho second\ninstance may have the retroactive effect of proving the credibility of the\nother, and hence it is not enough to discredit a particular case. The whole\ncollective bunch of them has to be broken. When Dr. Mason tells one\nstory that is borrowed from the narrative of some one we do not know, we\nmay be justified for a sceptical attitude of mind, but then he tells us one or\nmore of his own experiences, perhaps more striking than the questioned\ncase, and knowing Dr. Mason, we wonder whether after all scepticism is\nanything more than an excuse to remain in respectable compuny, or at least\nin the good opinion of those who pass for that. Dr. Mason's book is thus\nnot without its interest and weight, though we wish that it had been gauged\nto meet the severest tests of scientific method. James H Hyslop\n\f612 \u2022[Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nLettersfrom Julia ; or. Light from the Borderland. Edited by W. T. Stead.\nLondon : Grant Richards, 1897, pp. 188.\nMr. W. T. Stead, the well-known editor of the Review of Reviews, and.\nuntil October last, of Borderland, a magazine which has now ceased t,>\nappear, has collected under tho above title a series of letters purporting to\nhave been written automatically through his hand by a deceased lady, and\ndealing mainly with religious matters and with the conditions of the life after\ndeath. This is of course a very far-reaching claim, and it will be summarily\nput aside by most persons. Our Society, however, is bound not to put\nsuch claims aside without examination ; and inasmuch as I have dealt much\nwith similar claims in the cases of the late Mr. Stainton Moses, and of Mrs.\nPiper,\u2014and have also (in Proceedings IX., pp. 52-61) discussed certain\nprevious evidence offered by Mr. Stead himself, it may be convenient that 1 \u2022\nshould say a few words as to this volume. In order to make my criticism as\nlittle personal as possible, I will begin with some considerations applicable\nto all this class of religious literature, claiming to bo automatically produced,\nof which there are now a good many examples.\nThere are three separate points to be considered in analysing any work of\nthis kind.\n(1) Is the book really automatic ? That is to say, is the alleged automatist\nsincere and accurate in his claim to have written it without knowing what he\nwas writing 1\n(2) If so, does the book contain what we may call moral evidence,\u2014\nevidence of style and general content,\u2014which convinces us, without going\nfurther, that it does not come from some region of the automatist's own\nmind ?\n(3) Or, failing this, is there definite, objective evidence (as the\noccurrence in the writing of facts presumably unknown to the writer, &c.,)\nwhich obliges us to connect the book, or any part of it, with some\nother mind ?\nThe first two questions can in this case be answered easily.\n(1) I, for my part, fully believe in Mr. Stead's sincerity. I take it on his\nword that the book was written automatically, and that he believes ex animo\nthat it comes from a disembodied spirit, and contains important truths.\n(2) But, on the other hand, the general style and contents of the book\nconvey for me no real indication of origin external to Mr. Stead's mind.\nThey appear to me to bear about the same relation to the style and matter,\nsay, of Mrs. Oliphant's \"Little Pilgrim of the Unseen\" as Mr. Stead's\nliterary output in general bears to Mrs. Oliphant's. When Mr. Stead says,\n\"I only wish my conscious self could write so well,\" I think that he pays\neither too low a compliment to his conscious self or too high a compliment to\n\" Julia.\"\nThe contents of almost all these automatic utterances,\u2014through Stainton\nMoses, Mrs. Piper, &c., and also of almost all the best romances on such\nsubjects,\u2014Mrs. Oliphant's stories, Balzac's S\u00e9raphita, &c, appear to me to\nbe more or less,\u2014not necessarily directly derived from Swedenborg, but\u2014\nanalogous to Swedenborg. It is, of course, possible that Swedenborg's\nutterances convey much of inspired truth, and that spirit-communicators\n\fVart XXXIII.] 613\nReviews.\nand romancers alike give much the same messages simply because the spirits\nknow them to be true, and the romancers guess them to be true. It is also\npossible that SweJenborg's own mind anticipated ideas which, though in his\ntime scouted as bizarre or impious, have in our time become a constant\nelement in serious thought. In neither case can the mere repetition of\nsimilar ideas claim inspiration on moral or internal grounds alone.\n(3) The third point, then, \u2014the objective evidence to authorship other\nthan Mr. Stead's, \u2014becomes here of high importance. My readers may,\nperhaps, recall some narratives which I quoted in our Proceedings (Inc. cit.)\nwhich seemed to offer goodprimdfacie evidence of a telepathic communication\nbetween Mr. Stead's and other incarnate minds. \" Mr. Stead's experiments,\nindeed \" (I wrote, Proceedings IX., p. 60), \"are so precisely confirmatory of\nthe existence of a continuously active subliminal consciousness in all man\nkind that I almost shrink from pressing cases which look as though they had\nbeen constructed (although they most certainly were not) to bolster up my\nown hypotheses.\" I concluded with the hope of being \"aide to report further\non Mr. Stead's writings at no distant date \" ;\u2014a hope in which I was\nencouraged by some expressions of his willingness to submit further evidence\nto the S.P.R. Until that evidence should come, I deferred any notice of\n\"Julia.\" Mr. Stead was, in fact, good enough to show me some evidence as\nto another alleged spirit communicator, but that evidence was not convincing\nto me ;\u2014nor quite so, I fancy, to Mr. Stead himself. When, therefore, this\nnew volume appeared, I looked at once for evidence re Julia's identity ;\u2014\nhoping to sec some matter thereanent which had appeared in Bordeiland\nreprinted, and much addition made thereto. I was disappointed to find that\nsuch evidence was given only with a brevity such as that of the following\nassertions, which Mr. Stead \" states as facts. \" (1) \" That strangers who have\nnever heard of her existence have described her as standing near me when\nmy automatic hand was writing.\" (2) \" That several of these have not only\ndescribed her, but have given her name\" (i.e., \"Julia,\" as the next sentence\nshows). (3) That one here and one in \" her native land have also given her\nsurname, which I have refrained from publishing, and which I have equally\nin vain endeavoured to telepath to the minds of other mediums.\"\nNow, considering the details given in Mr. Stead's first account of \"Julia,\"\nand the publicity of that lady's career, both before and after physical\ndissolution, I feel that the only inference which we are entitled to draw from\nthe above facts is that the mediums to whom Mr. Stead \"in vain endeavoured\nto telepath \" her surname, must have been, on that occasion at any rate,\nperfectly honest persons.\nMr. Stead, however, it is fair to say, does not rely on these heads of\nevidence alone. The headings (2), (3), and (4) on page xi. of his Preface in\ndicate lines of proof which might have a real cogency if set forth at length and\nproperly substantiated. The automatic production of an affectionate private\nsobriquet not known to Mr. Stead ; \u2014of a definite incident also unknown to\nhim ;\u2014of various names of friends, also unknown to him ;\u2014these are just\nthe kind of facts which we should like to see given in full, and multiplied by\ncontinued inquiries from the \"control.\" Mr. Stead says, indeed, \"It is\nnot necessary for me to enter into a detailed statement of the evidence\nwhich has led me to the conclusion that these 'Letters from Julia,' are\n\f614 [Supplement.\nFrank Podmore.\nreally what they profess to be.\" But I cannot see the grounds for this\nabstinence ; 1 cordially invite him to set forth his evidence\u2014whether\nfor publication or not\u2014in a more complete form. I make no doubt whatever\nthat he has acted in his manner of publication of this book with sincere\nconscientiousness. But there exists another point of view. There are some\nmen who would shrink from the responsibility of laying before the public a\nseries of assertions which, if true, are so momentous as those made by\n\" Julia,\" without at the same time giving with the utmost care and complete\nness the evidence which has led the earthly editor to accept them as\nauthentic and veritable messages from a lady who has been privileged to\nmeet and speak with Jesus Christ in the spiritual world.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nThe Subconscious Self and its Relation to Education and llculth. By Louis\nWaldstein, M.D. (London : Grant Richards, 1897, pp. 171.)\nThis is not an easy book to analyse, or even to read. It has no index nor\ntable of contents, and the chapters, of which there are four, have neither\nheading nor summary. Carlyle once said of Coleridge's talk, that it was of\nexcellent quality, but that it atarted from no premises and arrived at no\nconclusion. It would not be quite fair to apply this to Dr. Waldstein's\nessay, for his statement of premises and conclusion is fairly definite. But it\nis by no means easy to trace the intermediate steps of the argument.\nPart of this obscurity is no doubt duo to the difficulties of a language to\nwhich Dr. Waldstein may be presumed to be a foreigner. But it may be\ndoubted whether in any other tongue his reasoning would be found either\nlucid or cogent. His argument, summed up in his own words, runs as\nfollows :\u2014\n\"I have endeavoured to show in this short sketch that our mental\npersonality is represented by the sum of all the impressions which have been\ndeposited in our memory during our lifetime, impressions which depend\nprimarily, as has been indicated at the outset, upon peculiarities of organic\nstructure preformed in us. The nature of all these impressions, however,\ndiffers, as has been seen, in two well-defined manners. The conscious\nimpressions, towards which we learn gradually to direct our attention, form in\ntheir aggregate a conscious self, which directs in its turn our attention and\nour acts as they affect principally our relation to the outer world. Through\nthe conscious self we also control that other part of our self from which\nemanate impulses and moods, the consuming desire to live our own life, to\nrealise our ideals irrespective of the relations which surround us. Hence it\ncomes that a dualism exists in the life of every one of us, more or less\naccentuated according to the difference between our conscious and our\nsubconscious self.\"\nFrom these premises Dr. Waldstein draws a practical deduction that the\ndue training and subordination of tho subconscious self in early life is a matter\nof the highest importance, and he makes certain suggestions for effecting\nthis end. The practical part of the book contains some matter of value,\n\fPart XXXIII ] 615\nReviews.\nsupplied by the author's experience as a physician. But his theoretical\nconclusions are imperfectly worked out and insufficiently supported. He\ndraws too absolute a line between what is conscious and what is subconscious.\nMoreover, he does not apparently realise that the content of the subconscious\nis largely made up of ideas which have lapsed from the conscious field. Nor\nis he at all clear as to what constitutes a conscious impression. He asserts\nrepeatedly that the child's impressions aro wholly of an unconscious kind\n\"until comparatively late in life \" (see, e.g., p. 44), and yet writes elsewhere\nthat \"the eye of the hawk, the ear of the horse, even the antennae of insects\nmust convey definite conscious impressions to the animal \" (p. 159). What\nmanner of thing is this \"consciousness\" which is granted to the ant or\nthe beetle, but denied to the pupils of a kindergarten 1 Again, in support of\nthe highly controvertible statement that ' ' in whatever degree or manner\nthese impressions (conscious or unconscious) are received thoy are registered\npermanently,\" he thinks it enough to say \"that countless instances of the\nreappearance of most feeble impressions, coming up again after many years,\nshould make further proof unnecessary \" (p. 3). It would be as logical to\nclaim the recent discover}' of the Words of Jesus as a proof that no ancient\nMSS. have ever been lost or destroyed. A subsidiary argument for his\nposition is even less calculated to convince. \" Impressions that have been\nregistered in early childhood reappear involuntarily, thus showing their\noriginal tenacity at a period of life when ?io selection process, or reasons for\nremembering orforgetting, can possibly have been at imrk.\" Even if we grant\nhis postulate that there is no conscious selection at an early age, this statement\nis surely very wide of the mark. The state of the child's health, the cerebral\nstate at the moment, the competition of other impressions, the likeness or\nunlikeness of the particular impression to others, all that is comprehended\nunder the term \"association of ideas \" and many other factors must operate\nsubconsciously to select and differentiate impressions.\nIn brief the book reads like a rough assortment of ill-digested memoranda ;\nit is an organism held together by connective tissue, in default of a solid, well-\narticulated skeleton. There are a fair number of interesting illustrations,\nand some few acute observations, and if Dr. Waldstein had taken the trouble\nto arrange and digest his material, he might have contributed something of\nsolid value to our knowledge of the Subconscious Self. If he fails in his\npresent work for the most part either to impress or convince us, it is from no\nlack of impressive, even ostentatious, conviction on his own part. Throughout\nthe book \"I hold,\" \"I maintain,\" \"I venture to assert\" are made to do\nduty for argument and illustration. He hints, indeed, vaguely at vast stores\nof observation and experiment ; but the few instances he quotes are quite\ninsufficient for his purpose. And when he says \"it is clear\" we feel that\n\"it is probable\" would have been a wiser and a juster claim. For instance :\u2014\n\" The hysterical condition . . . need not necessarily include any feebleness of\nthe faculties for observation or judgment ; they are, indeed, in many cases\nuncommonly strong, but here the subconscious memory has been unduly\ndeveloped. Such subjects are highly impressionable, and are governed by\ntheir vague and powerful emotional moods, so that the mental reflexes are\nset going upon the slightest stimulation, while the inhibiting power of the\nwill, however much it may be exerted, remains ineffectual. It is clear,\n\f616 [Supplement.\nJ. G. Smith.\ntherefore, that the first causes of hysteria must be looked for in the habits\nwhich the mind was allowed to form in early youth \" (p. 107).\nIs this really \"clear\" to anyone but Dr. Waldstein ? are the arguments\nadduced such as to make the deduction \"clear,\"\u2014i.e., beyond dispute 1\nOne more illustration of the author's reasoning may be quoted. This is\nhow he refers to the subject of telepathy :\u2014\n\" The experience of one person in a given moment might very well be\nidentical to that of another, for we are to-day subject, even at great distances,\nto a multitude of similar impressions, mostly induced by vague sensations.\nThe direct effect of modern journalism and the telegraph must necessarily be\nto set in motion mental activity of precisely the same nature all over the\nglobe, and call up much the same interests and emotions. The uniformity\nof daily habits, fashious, food, and the like, will serve to awaken numberless\nsubconscious moods, which might suggest, in their turn, the same course of\nideas. May we not explain in this way the origin of some of the phenomena\nwhich have been ascribed to tele1mthic influences ?\" (pp. 83-4).\nThis is a forcible statement of the considerations which render telepathy\na dubious explanation of simultaneous dreams and other commonplace\nimpressions. But, so far as I know, no one has professed to found a belief in\ntelepathy on such occurrences. And even the association of ideas is limited\nin its operation ; it could scarcely, for instance, be supposed to affect the\ndrawing of a card, or operate to produce the death of the agent in sub\nconscious correspondence to a hallucination on the part of the percipient.\nFrank Podmore.\nThe Book of Dreams and Ghosts. By Andrew Lano. Longmans, Green,\nand Co., 1897.\nMr. Lang has certainly succeeded in attaining the object which he\nsought in writing The Book of Dreams and Ghosts, namely, \" to entertain\npeople interested in the kind of narratives here collected.\" The stories\n.tre written with admirable clearness and brevity, and the titles of some of\nthe tales are alone sufficient to make the readers' flesh creep :\u2014 \"The Weird\nMoon,\" \"The Lady in Black,\" \"The Old Family Coach,\" \"The Assyrian\nPriest,\" \"The Foul Fords; or. The Longformacus Farrier,\" \"The Black\nDog and the Thumbless Hand,\" and \"The Ghost that Bit.\" The simple\nsensation-loving reader will perhaps regret that the series was not published\nin a magazine, with gruesome illustrations to accompany the toxt. The\nauthor has to a great extent relied on well-known stories like Lord Lyttelton's\nGhost, Mr. Williams's dream of the murder of Spencer Perceval, etc., and\nespecially on narratives published in the Proceedings of the Society for\nPsychical Research. He gives, however, some veridical dreams, and some\ncases of crystal-vision which have not appeared before. Of the latter, one\nhas been printed in the Journal S. P.It. : the others are given in greater\ndetail than here in Mr. Lang's paper on \" Crystal-Vision,\" which was read\nat the meeting of the Society on January 28th, 1808. Besides these, there\nis a case of apparently veridical waking hallucination (p. 45), told to the\n\fPart XXXIII.] 617\nReviews.\nwriter by his old headmaster, the Rev. Dr. Hodson, brother of Hodson, of\nHodson's Horse, \" a person whom I never heard make any other allusion\nto such topics ; \" and also a \" collective \" case, which we give in Mr.\nLang's words.\n\" The following story was told to myself, a few months after the curious\nevent, by the three witnesses in the case. They were connections of my\nown, the father was a clergyman of the Anglican Church ; he, his wife, and\ntheir daughter, a girl of twenty, were the percipients. All are cheerful,\nsagacious people, and all, though they absolutely agreed as to the facts in\ntheir experience, professed an utter disbelief in ' ghosts,' which the\noccurrence has not affected in any way. They usually reside in a foreign\ncity, where there is a good deal of English society. Ono day they left\nthe town to lunch with a young fellow-countryman, who lived in a villa in\nthe neighbourhood. . . . His house was kept by his sister, who was\npresent, of course, at the little luncheon party. During the meal some ques\ntion was asked, or some remark was made, to which the clerical guest replied\nin English by a reference to 'the maidservant in pink.' 'There is no maid\nin pink,' said the host, and he asked both his other guests to corroborate\nhim. Both ladies, mother and daughter, were obliged to say that, unless\ntheir eyes deceived them, they certainly had seen a girl in pink attending on\nthem, or, as least, moving about in the room. To this their entertainers\nearnestly replied that no such person was in their establishment, that they\nhad no woman servant but the elderly cook and housekeeper, then present,\nwho was neither a girl nor in pink. After luncheon the guests were taken\nall over the house to convince them of the absence of the young woman\nwhom they had seen, and assuredly there was no trace of her. On returning\nto the town where they reside, they casually mentioned the circumstance as\na curious illusion. The person to whom they spoke said, with some interest,\n' Don't you know that a girl is said to have been murdered in that house\nbefore your friends took it, and that she is reported to be occasionally seen,\ndressed in pink ? ' They had heard of no such matter, but the story\nseemed to be pretty generally known, though naturally disliked by the occu\npant of the house. As for the percipients, they each and all remain firm\nin the belief that, till convinced of the impossibility of her presence, they\nwere certain they had seen a girl in pink, and rather a pretty girl, whose\nappearance suggested nothing out of the common.\"\nMoreover, in several well-known historical cases, Mr. Lang has carefully\ninvestigated the different versions, and gives evidence for their various\ndegrees of authenticity. In one case, \u2014that of the foretelling of the death\nof the Duke of Buckingham by the apparition of his father,\u2014the narrative\nof a Mr. Wyndham, who had the story direct from the percipient, a kinsman\nof his own, is given ; this has never before been published.\nMr. Lang has also discovered a curious fact in connection with the\nmurder of Mr. Perceval, about which Mr. Williams had his well-known\npremonitory dream in 1812, namely that there was a report of the murder in\nBude Kirk, a village near Annan, on Sunday, May 10th, the day before the\ncrime was committed. \" This was stated in the Dumfries and Galiov-ay\nCourier, and copied in the Times of May 25th. On May 28th, the Perth\nCourier quotes the Dumfries paper, and adds that ' the Rev. Mr. Yorstoun,\n\f618 [Supplement.\n0. Smith,\nminister of Hoddam (ob. 1833), has visited Bude Kirk and has obtained the\nmost satisfactory proof of the rumour having existed ' on May 10th, but the\nrumour cannot be traced to its source.\"\nMr. Lang does not profess a severely scientific treatment of the subject,\nbut several of his remarks on evidence are instructive, and he gives some\nquotations from Professor William James' Principles of Psychology for the\npurpose of explaining the meaning of \"hallucination\" in its technical\nsense. His only system of tacking the stories together is by classing them\n\"in different grades, as they advance from the normal and familiar to the\nundeniably startling ; \" and this plan does not seem to be very strictly\nadhered to ; since to the last story of all, \" The Ghost that Bit,\" a footnote\nis appended to explain that \"this story should come under the head of\n1 Common Death-Bed Wraiths,' but it is such an uncommon one ! \"\nTo some members of our Society the book will probably appear to be\nwritten in a frivolous and dilettante spirit. And no doubt the journalist,\nthe ordinary reader, the man in the street, when he finds story after story\nquoted from the publications of the S.P.R. , will take occasion to have his\nusual laugh at the expense of a Society which amuses itself with collecting\nblood-curdling ghost stories, and expects to be taken seriously. But unless\nhe is a very dull journalist, or a very careless reader, he will perceive that\nMr. Lang's levity is at any rate impartial and comprehensive, and that he\nintends the laugh to go round, holding that fun may be as legitimately\nderived from the \"fallacies which impose on the credulity of common-sense,\"\nas from the rash conclusions of dreamers and ghost-hunters. In the preface\nhe says : \"This book does not pretend to be a convincing, but merely an\nillustrative collection of evidence. It may, or may not, suggest to some\nreaders the desirableness of further inquiry ; and the author does not hope\nto do more, if as much.\" Let us hope that this modest aspiration will be\nrealised.\nJ.
