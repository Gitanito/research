[Nov., 1885.\nOn the proposition of Mr. Edmund Gurney, Professor Boutlerow,\nof St. Petersburg, was eJected a Corresponding Member.\nOne new Member and three new Associates, whose names appear\nabove, were elected.\nIn connection with the occurronce of the General Meeting on the\n29th of October, a Meeting of the Council, held in accordance with the\nresolution passed in February last, was summoned for the afternoon of\nthe same day. The Members present were: Professor Barrett, Messrs.\nAlexander Calder, Walter H. Coffin, Edmund Gurney, Richard\nHodgson, F. W. H. Myers, Frank Podmore, and Hens1eigh Wedgwood.\nThe chair was taken by Mr. H. Wedgwood.\nAfter the Minutes of the previous Meeting had been read. and\nsigned as correct, three new Members and three new Associates were\nelected, whose names and addresses are included in the list given above.\nThe Treasurer reported that Mr. Frederick Elder, who was elected\non the 2nd of October, had qualified as a Life Member of the Society.\nThe Council directed the amount thus received, \u00a321, to be invested\nin Consols.\nSome presents to the Ll'brary were on the table, which are otherwise\nacknowledged.\nA cash account made up to date was presented, and one account\npassed for payment.\nThe very few complete sets of Volume I. of the Journol which\nremain having been bound, it was resolved that four copies be presented\nto the following Libraries: The British Museum, the Bodleian, the\nCambridge University, and the American Academy at Boston, the\nremaining copies to be retained by the Society.\nIt was resolved that 25 copies of the first Report issued by the\nAmerican Society for Psychical Research be ordered. The price at\nwhich these can be offered to Members will be announced as soon as\nthey are in hand.\nThe next Meeting of the Council was fixed for Friday, the 27th of\nNovember.\nREPORT OF THE GENERAL MEETING.\nThe first General Meeting of the Society for the season was held on\nthe evening of Thursday, the 29th of October, at the Garden Mansion,\nQueen Anne's Mansions, S.W.\nIn the absence of the President, the chair was taken by Professor\nBarrett. .\nMr. Myers began by explaining the general position he was about\nto take up in the controversy now going on as to the true nature of\nDigitized by Google\n\fNOT., 1885.] Journal qrSocietyfor P'!lchical Rutn1\u00b7ch. 91\nman. The old view, he said, held both by ordinary common-sense and\nby most metaphysicians, maintains that each of us possesses a distinct\nand permanent personality-a. self which is a unity and not a. mere\naggregation. This view is usually based on intrtnpec'ion. The new\nphysiological view, on the other ha.nd, is to the effect that the only\nunity in us is the unity of our organism, and that our sense of\npersonality depends merely on the temporary harmony of a sufficient\nnumber of the physical elements which compose us. This view is\nsupported by the physiological analysis, which tends to show how our\nhigher physical processes may be mere developments of the lower\nprocesses which we share with the brute. Mr. Myers explained that he\nadvocated the f1M1}UH:l8 of this newer school, but that he was led by\nthem te something more like the ccmcluriofu of the older. But he held\nthat the old empirical conception of human personality must be\nanalysed into its constituent elements before the basis of a scientific\ndoctrine of human personality could safely be laid.\nIn pursuance of this ana.lysis, he proceeded to give an account of\nvarious experiments on hypnotised subjects, partly made by the Society\nfor Psychical Research, but mainly made by certain French I(J~,\nProfessors Bernheim, Beaunis, &c. From these it appears that if a\nfavourable subject was hypnotised, and a suggestion made to him in the\nhypnotic trance, this suggestion will work itself out a.fterwards in his\nwaking life, and he will do what he has been told to do, yet will all the\nwhile suppose that he is acting on his own impulse. It was thus shown\ntha.t our sense of free-will may often be illusory.\nMr. Myers then touched on the phenomena of Glurnating memory,\nwhich hypnotism evokes. The subject acquires, it seems, a. second\nmemory, distinct from the first, and including the things said and done\nin the trance condition, which are entirely forgotten in ordinary waking\nlife. It was thus indicated that we can hardly appeal to the continuity\nof our memory as a proof of a persistent personality.\nAfter pointing out the dangers involved in hypnotism, and the safe-\ngoards against those dangers, Mr. Myers gave some remarkable examples\nof improvement of character effected by hypnotic suggestion. It appears\nthat habits of over-indulgence in beer, spirits, coffee, and smoking ha.ve\nbeen effectually checked by throwing the subject into the hypnotic\ntrance, and suggesting to him that on his awaking he would find that\nhe disliked beer, &C. This kind of suggestion needs occasional renewal,\nand an anecdote was told of an idle boy, to whom it was suggested. in\nthe hypnotic trance that he would henceforth be diligent. He became\nso, and rose to the top of his class, but he did not like his new character,\nand when the effect of the suggestion wore off he obstinately refused to\nbe hypnotised again. Mr. Myers was of opinion that this power of\nsuggestion might be turned to great practical advantage.\nDigitized by ~&OgIe\n\f92 Journal qf &eke!l.for PS.lfcllicnl Research. [Nov., 1885.\nReturning to his opening statement of opinion, he pointed out that\nthis process of analysing human faculties by direct experiment, though\nin some directions it led to conclusions at which our self-esteem might\nrevolt, yet was beginning to discover in us the germs of faculties\ntranscending any which we were previously aware of possessing. Such\na faculty was telepathy, or the transmission of thought and sensation\nfrom one mind to another, without the agency of the recognised organs\nof sense. This discovery in itself placed the whole problem of our being\nin a different light, and domed reasonable grounds for hope that we\nmight hereafter establish on a valid scientific basis much that bad\nhitherto been the object only of trust and aspiration.\nThe Chairman expressed his sense of the importance of Mr. Myers'\npaper. He considered that these facts mark an era in hypnotic\nresearch. He invited M. Richet, one of the Corresponding Members of\nthe Society, to address the Meeting.\nM. Richet (who spoke in French) expounded the view of \"un-\nconscious intelligence,\" which he has advocated in connection with his\nexperiments in mental suggestion, and expressed his conviction that a\nlarge amount of intelligent process \u00a3OEl8 on below the level of con-\nsciousness.\nThe meeting then assumed a conversational character.\nIDbituat~ Jaoace.\nBy the death of LoRD HOUGHTON our Society has lost a valued\nMember. Lord Houghton (on whose other attainments and distinctions\nit is, of course, needless here to touch), had throughout his life paid\nattention to occult subjects,and possessed a rare and valuable collection\nof books on mystic lore.

This Committee issued circulars, asking for\n.assistance in experiments designed on lines similar to those suggested\nby M. Richet. They received in reply records of 5,500 tria.Is in guess-\ning the colour of a playing-card on which the agent concentrated his\n.attention, and of II,600 trials in guessing which of the 10 digits\nwas thought of. In the card experiments, where the most probable\npercentage of success was 50, the actual percentage was 50'51.\nAnd in the digit experiments, where the most probable percentage\nof success was 10, the actual percentage was 10'33. The smallness\n\u00b7of these excesses over the most probable number leads to the conclusion\nthat no thought-transference took place.\nIn the digit experiments, the Committee recommended that the 10\ndigits should be written down by the agent one below the other in any\n.arbitrary order, and that he should then think of these figures succes-\nsively, passing alternately up and down the column till I 00 guesses have\nbeen made. This plan seems to give the percipient too mucb information\nabout the order of the digits, and so to introduce a possible source\u00b7 of\nserious error. In the first place, he knows that each digit will occur\nonce, and once only, in each decade. If, therefore, he has already\nguessed a 3, say, in the course of a decade, there is a danger of bis over-\nriding an impulse, which may be due to thought-transference, to\nguess a 3 again. In the second place, he knows that, given the order\nofthe digits in the first decade, that in the other nine decades would\nfollow, so that if he remembers his first ten guesses the impulse produced\nby this recollection to guess the digits of subsequent decades in the order\ngiven by the first may be stronger than any impulse from thought-\ntransference. The consequence would be that if all his first ten guesses\nwere wrong he would make no right guesses at all, though by thought-\ntransference he might have been led to guess right ninety times; while\nifhisfirst ten guesses happened to be right he would be right all through\nthe hundred, though there might have been no thought-transference\nwhatever in the last ninety. In short, bias from this second cause, if\n.completely operative, would, as Professors Peirce and Pickering point\n\u00b7out, reduce a set of a hundred guesses to equivalence with ten. It will\nbeinteresting to learn from Dr. Minot's promised analysis of the guesses\n. \"bether bias from either of these causes has operated, except in\nthe case described as C&Sf'I E.\nExperiments were also made in guessing the number on a die thrown.\nDigitized by Google\n\f94 JON\"\",1 ofSockt!l for P81lcllical RutarcA. [NOY., 1883.\nThe probable percentage of correct guesses was 16\u00b77, and the actual per-\ncentage IS\u00b79, but the number of triala-31S-is insufficient to base any\nconclusion upon.\nThe report of the Committee a1lo contains a short appendix on\nsome experiments with diagrams similar to those which have se,\u00b7eral\ntimes been described in our own Proceeding,. The success is, perhaps,\nnot very brilliant,but it is decided enough to afford distinct corroboration\nto our own experiments.\nAn interesting appendix is added by Professor Pickering on the\npossibility of error, due to thought-transference, in scientific researches\nin which an assistant is aware of facts a knowledge of which the\nobserver intentionally avoids. The example he brings forward is the\nrevision of the Northern stars, where, after the observer has indepen-\ndently estimated the brightness of a star, his estimate is compared with\nthat of the Durchmusterung of Argelander. If thought-transference\noccurs between the recorder who knows the previous estimate, and the\nobserver who does not, Professor Pickering thinks that the result\nshould be a greater number of cases where the new estimate and the\nold agree than there would otherwise be. He explains how the cal-\nculation is to be made, and what corrections need to be applied, and\ngives a careful analysis of the observations made at the Harvard College\nObservatory, where he finds nO indication of thought-transference.\nI am inclined to doubt whether the knowledge of previous estimates\nalways tends to produce argument; with over-scrupulous observers it\nmay, I think, tend the other way. But, however this may be, for any\neffect at all to be produced, there must surely be some degree of\ncertainty as to what the previous estimate was; and from what even the\nmoat successful percipients tell us of their experiments, the impression\nthey believe themselves to derive from thought-transference would seem\nto be generally faint in comparison to the slightest impression allowed\nto enter the mind from other sources. For this reason I should be\nsurprised to find thought-transference operative in cases such as that\ndiscussed by Professor Pickering.\nIn conclusion, the Committee say that they have under consideratioa\nsome forms of experiment founded on the hypothesis that conceptionsof\ngeometric form or arrangement may be more easily transferred than\nconceptions of colour or number, and capable of bringing the queatioll ~\nexact numerical tests. We may, therefore, look forward with interest\nto the next number of the Pf\"OCe6ding,.\nE.M.B.\nDigitized by Google\n\fBoy., 1885.] Journal ~f Society for Paychical Be.arch. 95\nMESMERIC EXPERIMENTS AT LYON.\nM j[~Vtne ,.4\"ifl1(Jl ; par Ie Dr. CLAUDE PUBONNBT (de Lyon).\nLons-le-Saunier, 1884.\nThis book consists of papers first printed about 18 months ago,\nin the Liherte du Jura, and afterwards collected and republished in\nthe chief town of the Jura department. Many of the personal\nobservations are very interesting, and as they have not hitherto received\nmuch attention, either in France or England, we may be excused, we\nhope, for giving a brief summary of their principal points.\nInterest at Lyon in hypnotic phenomena was excited by Verbeck, the\nwell-known conjurer, who showed in public what could be done with\nmany persons when in the condition of hypnotic catalepsy. M.Perronnet\nwas impressed with the inference that suggestion was very powerful with\nsuch persons. In May, 1883, he availed himself of an opportunity for\nexperiment; he was called to a girl of 18, who was a nervous, wayward\nsubject, and whom he found in a state of muscular rigidity. He put his\nfingers on her eyeballs with a slight tremulous movement; for a time the\nmuscles completely relaxed, but afterwards they grew rigid again; when\nhe touched the left side of her head, she moved the right side of the\nbody and also spoke, as he thought she probably would do, since he\nimagined that the speech-centre in the left side of the brain would be\nstimulated; if the right side of the head was touched there was, as a.\nrule, movement of the left side of the body without speech. In one\nexperiment, however, he was meaning to touch the left side and was\nanticipating speech ; the speech came, but be found he was really touch-\ning the right side, and he inferred that the speech followed his will or\nanticipation rather than the position of his fingers. He, thereupon,\nretreated several yards, so that contact was impossible, and gave her\nmental orders without speaking. He was surprised to find that she\nobeyed them at once; and still more surprised when he found that if\none of the spectators took his hand at a distance and gave similar silent\nmental orders, she obeyed him also.\nTwo months later he was treating Mdlle. X., ret. 21, a hysterical\nand anremic .woman. She was easily hypnotised by gentle pressure on\nthe eyeballs; if the left eye only was touched the right side of the body\ngrew cataleptic, and the left was rigid. She could not play the piano;\nbut he took her up to it, put his left hand on the left side of her head,\nand played a tune with his right hand, telling her, when he had finished,\nto repeat it; this she did accurately with her right hand, and even\nrepeated it in another key when she was asked to do so, after the first\nnote only had been struck for her guidance. He retreated to some\nlittle distance behind her, and asked her to play another well-known\ntune, which he named, and to play it with some spirit. She played it\nDigitized by Google\n\f96 Journal qf &ciety for P8fjcllical Reuarch. [NOY.. l885.\nin a most excited fashion, but he found he could silently stop her by his\nwill when he was standing\u00b7 behind her and looking at her.\nOne day the idea struck him that he would make a person he had\nhimself mesmerised mesmerise another subject; and he found no difti..\nculty after he had mesmerised X to make X mesmerise Y. But when\nY was thus mesmerised he could not wake her, or influence her move-\nments, except by means of inducing X to act upon her. This could\nbe carried a step further, and, by action on X, he could induce X to\nmesmerise Y so that Y should go on to mesmerise Z. In such a case\nhe found himself powerless over Y and Z, and that they had an inert\nexpressionless look, which he attributed to want of will in the persons\nwho had mesmerised them.\nHe found it easy to make his mesmerised subjects believe that a\nglass of water which was in their hands contained any drugs he thought\nof; and that without a word spoken, and, indeed, often without there\nbeing in reality any glass or any water. He turned his thoughts to\nmorphia; the mesmerised person sang Marguerite's song in \"Faust\" with\nall the emotions of that scene plainly shown in her face. then imagined\nthat she drank the poison, and fell gradually under the influence of\nmorphia; more water was given, whilst the doctor fixed his thoughtson\natropine. and she slowly recovered from the narcotic effects of the\nimaginary morphia by the antidote of the imaginary atropine. After\nother delusive suggestions that the mesmerised su~jects had taken\ncolocynth. aloes, Glauber's salts, &c., the usual physiological results\nfollowed unsparingly. This was a repetition of the experiments which\nhad been suggested by M. Dumontpallier. M. Perronnet found. also,\nthat with patience he could, from a distance, influence the vaso-motor\nsystem and the distribution of the blood supply of the subject according\nto his unspoken intentions, so that, from a distance, he was able thus to\nmake ono limb colder than the other, and in one case he thought he\ndiminished the temperature and inflammation in cellulitis of one arm.\nWhen he mesmerised people and others asked them questions without\ncontact, the answers were tinged more or less by the knowledge and\nwishes of the questioner, and there were four classes of conditions 80\nproduced. (i.) The questioner asked a qUElStion, of which he knew the\nanswer; this knowledge and the real fact conspired to make the subject\ngive the true answer. which generally happened.\n(ii) The questioner asked a question to which he did not know the\nanswer, but hoped it might be one particular thing. The desired\nanswer was generally given whether it was true or not. If the\nquestioner desired nothing in particular he might get the true answer.\n(iii.) If both M. Perronnet and the questioner knew t.he correct\nanswer it was generally easily obtained.\n(iv.) If the lluestioll~r did not know the answer but M. Perronnet\nDigitized by Google\n\fNoy., 1885.] Journal of Society\/oJ\" Psycllicnl Re&eu,\u00b7ct.. 97\n-did, the answer given was generally a mixture of what the questioner\nwanted with what M. Perronnet knew.\nM. Perronnet does not hesitate to accept some cases as instances of\n-clairvoyance (lucidite objective) in a somnambulic state, but he only\n~ves the details of one story which could be considered as strictly of\nthis kind. He chose A, a girl easily mesmerised, and put her at his\nhouse into a state of deep sleep; her limbs became rigid or flaccid\n.according to his wish, and stayed where he chose to place them; her\npupils did not react to light, which he took to be the most conclusive\ndisproof of fraud. They went together to visit a sick child, B; A was\nleft in the corner of the room. The doctor went up to B, and taking up\nher hand asked A what was the rate of the pulse; A told him quite\n\u00abIrrectly how many beats there were to the minute, and when the\ndoctor felt a beat missed out she exclaimed quickly, \"A beat dropped I\"\nSo far, what she had done might be interpreted as the result of the\ndoctor's knowledge communicated to her at a distance, or of an abnormal\nsensibility on the part of the girl, which enabled her to see the beating\nof the pulse. He went on, however, to a more important point, and\nput his clinical maximum thermometer under the sick child's arm.\nAfter a few minutes he took it out, and put it back in its case without\nlookir.g at it, and asked A what the temperature was. \" Thirty-seven\nand something more,\" she said. \"Are you Bure '\/\" the doctor asked..\n\"No, no,\" she answered; \"I see I mistook a 9 for a 7, it is 39\u00b0 and\nthree cross-lines.\" He then looked at the thermometer, and found it\n39\u00b0'3; the tenths of each degree being marked with cross-lines on the\nstem.\nHe goes on to give several stories of another kind, viz., thought-\ntransference, for which we have here room for only one. A girl whom\nhe had mesmerised was in the same room with him when he was writing\na letter, but at a considerable distance and out of sight. When he had\ncome to an end of the letter, he read it through silently to himself, and\nwhen he reached the place where, in writing the word \"three-quarters,\"\nhe had left out the \"three\" by accident, the girl suddenly called out,\n\"He has left out the 'three' 1 He has made a mistake 1\"\nTo illustrate the usefulness of mesmerism in medical practice he\nrecounts se~era.l of his own experiences, in which he found himself able\nto exercise great control over hysterical women in tonic rigid spasm,\nin trance, and in violent convulsions, and on one occasion to strengthen\nthe aruesthetic effects of ether when administering it before a surgical\noperation to a drunkard who took it very badly.\nHe at first thought that everyone shares about equally in mesmeric\npower, but after considerable experience has come to believe tha.t it\nvaries with the individnal, a.nd depends on some quality of temperament\nwhich he cannot determine beforehand.\ngitized by (.oogI\n\f98 Joflt'nal C!f &Cietylor PB1\/chical Raea,.ck. (Nov.,l8S.'i.\nOf the method of physical action in these thought-transferences, M.\nPerronnet attempts to give BOme explanation. He suggests that all\nthoughts probably produce BOme physical movements in the periphery\nof the body; and that, though these movements may generally be\nunconscious and always very trifling, yet the undulations started by\nthem may be perceptible by the abnormally acute receptive powers of\nthe hypnotised subject, and may BO be able to reproduce the idea from\nwhich they originated. \"Moo e:eplication n'tJIIt pas parfa.ite,\" concludes\nM.

On their way to\nNiagara from Quebec, having reached the town of Prescot.t, which ia above\nall the rapids of the St. Lawrence River, they then embarked on a sailing\nvessel comlllanded by a Captain Pattel'lOn. As the voyage from Prescott to\nNiagara in those days would probably occupy about a week, the p8III8ngera\nwould undoubtedly become pretty well acquainted with the captain of the\nlittle veeael.

I immediately brought out a C8IIe containing a little\nhypodermic syringe and bottle of solution of morphia, intending to UIIe it\nupon him at once, but I found there was little or none of the solution in\nthe bottle, so I ran oft' as fast as JX'8Bible to the nearest chemist's (about a\nmile away) to get the bottle refilled. Returning about 15 minutes later,\nI at once injected the morphia, and in a few minutes he had fallen asleep.\nShortly after this (certainly before half-past 7), I received a telegram\nirom my brothar Alec, who was a physician living and practising at Tidioute.\nPennsylvania, U.S. (some 400 miles distant from Kingston, Ontario), asking\nme if father was ill and to wire reply at once, which I did, stating that he\nbad had a very levere attack of neuralgia, but was then sleeping quietly\n.from a dose of morphia.

The occurrence to which my brotherreferred happened\n.as long ago as 12 years back, but was so impresaed upon my memory that I am\nnot likely to forget it. We were then living in an adjoining parish to this,\nof which my father was vicar, and at that time there was no one else in the\nhouse but my father and myself and two servants. We had all gone\n.to our respective rooll18 at our usual time, and according to my custom I\nhad locked my door, and gone to sleep. I was suddenly awaked with a\ndistinct impreBBion that there was somebody present in the room standing\nbv the side of my bed, close by. Such an indescribable horror came over\nme that I remember shutting my eyes and covering up my face lest I might\nlIee what I felt was in the room.

Shortly after,\nwe received news by telegram of the sudden death of my brother in the West\nIndies, and the day coincided with that on which I had Been the vision as\nrelated. When the letters containing all details arrived we loamt\nthat he was buried the same day that he died in the evening,\nthe funeral service taking place in the Colonial Cathedral.

It was about a week\nlater when I saw it again, at least, not the light but its reflection.\nI was in bed, and about one o'clock at night the room became suddenly\nlighted with a bright rod light, which was, to say the least of it, rather\nstartling. It seemed to be in the same place, but higher up and much brighrer\nand redder than on the previous occasion. It muet have been very near the\nwip.dow (which was about 10 feet from the ground), for the marks and\nflaws on the glass were quite plainly reflected on the wall. I was very much\nfrightened when I saw it, thinking that some burglar was about to enter my\nroom through the window. But the light seemed to pass away as suddenly\n&8 it camEl, leaving the room in total darkness 1\\8 before.\nThe only explanation I ever heard was given me by a servant, whose\nfather was a miner in Zennor. She said that it was a kind of will-o'-the-\nwisp, which appeared over ground in which tin or copper were to be found.\nThis seemed to be a natural explanation, as Zelmor was full of old mines\nwhich had been worked many years ago, and stopped probably on account\nof insufficient capital to carry them on.

It consists\n~f a \"letter addreued by Mr. A. P. Sinnett to Light,\" and\" reprinted\nunder the authority of the Council of the London Lodge of the Theosophi-\nal Society.\"\nMr. Sinnett complains in this letter of the great delay in the publication\n(If my Report ct-ncerning the alleged marvellous phenomena in connection\nwith the Theosophical Society. No one is chargeable for this delay but\nmyself, amd I du not blame Mr. Sinnett for having considered it a just cause\n~f grievance. The Report might have been ready in August had it not been\nthat many documents in connection with the suhject were forwarded to me\nby Mr. Hume, and these documents required a careful examination. The\ndelay is chiefly due to my examination of these documents, and especially of\na large IDaII8 of K. H. MSS., which they included. But while I\nregret this delay, which I could not foresee at the end of June, as the docu-\nments in question had not then reached me, I am unable to see that the\ngeneral charges brought against Madame Blavatsky were not adequately\nsupported by the statements made at our meetings. It is true that it was\nimpossible for me then to go into detail concerning every single phenomenon\n.which I investigated in India; and if Mr. Sinnett had merely complained\nthat I had expl'CBlled my opinion concerning the phenomena in their\nentirety, whereas I had shown only that the most important of them were\nfraudulently produced, I should have had nothing more to say beyond the\nexpression of my regret for the delay in the production of the full Report,\nand the explanation of it which I have given.\nBut Mr. Sinnett seems to forget that the lll8in burden of the indictment\nagainst Madame Blavataky was laid and supported at our first meeting, at\nwhich Mr. Sinnett himself was not present. One of the principal charge.\nagainst Madame Blavatsky had been brought against her by the authorities\nof the Madraa Ch'rilltian College Magazill~, who published in September,\n1884, portions of a series of lette1'8 which, if genuine, distinctly proved\nthat Madame Blavatsky had engaged in a conspiracy, which had extended\n~\\\"er several yea1'8, for the production of spurious Ill8rvels. The editor of\nthe Chri8tian College Magazill~, before publhiliing these lette1'8, had obtained\nthe best evidence procurable at Madras as to the genuineness of their hand-\nwriting, and the various gentlemen to whom the lette1'8 were submitted were\nunanimously of opinion that Madame Blavataky had written them. Mr. J.\nD. B. Gribble, of Madras, wrote a pamphlet on the subject, giving his\nreasons for coming to the same conclusion. Mr. F. G. Netherclift, the chief\ncaligraphic expert in England, had examined a large number of these lette1'8,\nand had expressed biB unqualified conclusion that they were unquestionably\nwritten by Madame Blavatllky. l\\-Ir. Sims, of tho British Museum, expressed\n.the same conclusion. The members of our Committee, including myself.\nDigitized by Google\n\f110 Journal Qf 801'iet!llor P8!Jcllicai Re8earc\/,. [Nov., 1885..\nwere also of the same opinion concerning tlaem. At our meetings I gaTe\naccounts of various phenomena as described to me by the witn8llll8ll, and\nshowed that there was clear evidence that theae phenomena were fraudulently\nproduced, and that abundant circumstantial evidence had been supplied by\nTheosophists themselves which corroborated the opinion of experts as to the-\nauthorship of the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters. Especially I went into con-\naiderable detail concerning the Shrine, and showed that it was manifest from\nthe statements of Theosophists that the Shrbe was fixed at the vety spot on\nthe wall most convenient for fraudulent purposes, that it had a sliding panel\nat the back, and that there had been a hole in the wall behind the panel,\nwhich communicated with Madame Blavatsky's bedroom. Yet Mr. Sinnett\nwrites :-\n\"A series of charges imputing misconduct of the blackest dye to\nMadame Blavatsky have been made public on the &88umption that they\nwould ultimately be supported by certain testimony. But after more than\nthree months this testimony still remains unpublished.\"\nMr. Sinnett regards the evidence which I collected in India, \"as far as.\nthis was foreshadowed\" by my speech, as \"worthleB8\" ; with this I in a\ncertain sense agree, and it will be remembered that I gave instances at our\nmeetings of the absolute unreliability of some of the native witne88e8 whose\nevidence I quoted. But if Mr. Sinnett thinks that the cumulative testimony\nwhich shows that the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters are genuine, and that the\nShrine was, to use Mr. Sinnett's words, a \"conjurer's box,\" is to be re-\ngarded as \"worthieu,\" it is difficult to see what sort of testimony he would\nregard as having any value. Mr. Sinnett himself baa, in mont than one\ninstance, relied on evidence supplied by apparent identity of handwriting.\nThe whole point of the \"Jhelum telegram\" incident recorded by him in\n\"The Occult World,\" turned upon the opinion-of Mr. Sinnett 1-that the\nwriting of a certain telegram was in the K. H. hand; and he baa laid\nstreas upon the fact that he baa received almost immediate K. H. com-\nmunications in supp08ed reply to his letters when Madame BJavatsky was at\nthe other side of India,-where again the whole force of the incident must\nrest upon the fact that Mr. Sinnett recognised the writing as being in the\nX. H. hand.\nI may take this opportunity of removing one or two misapprehensions\nwhich Mr. Sinnett baa shown in his letter. He appears to think that I ought\nto have allowed Madame Blavatsky to see \"the original letters alleged to be\nhers,\" and he saYIl that hecannot reconcile my neglect in this matter with my\n&88urance that I conducted my in'quity \"with an open mind.\" Now in the-\n:first place I had no authority to show these letters to Madame BlavatskYt\nand Madame Blavatsky well knew that I had none. She frequently asked\nme whether I had seen the letters myself, and slae knew that a considerable\ntime had elapsed before I had an opportunity of doing so, in consequence of,\nthe absence from Madras of the Editor of the Christian Cullege Magazine;.\nand when I was first enabled to inspect them, I spoke to her of certain re-\nstrictions which were placed-I think quite rightly-upon my use of them.\nSeveral of them I had in my own posseuion for a day or two only, for my\nown examination. The remaining ones I examined in the house of a gentle-\nman, in whose custody tlley were at the time, and two groups of tllem were\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1885.J Journal of Socil'fy for Psychical Researc\". 111\neventually entrusted to me for the apecific purpoee of being sent to England\nfor the judgment of the beat caligraphic experta obtainable here (a fact of\nwhich I did not think it neceaaary toinform Madame BlavatUy), under the\nparticular condition that they ahould be returned at lOOn aa poIIIible; and\nthey were actually sent back to India before my arrival in England. Thoae\nwhich I had in my own poaaeaaion for a ahort time I waa requeated not to\ntake on my own reeponaibility to the headquartera of the Theoaophical\nSociety, the Editor of the CAriIti4n College Magazine being naturally appre-\nhenaive that Madame Blavataky might seize an opportunity of tampering\nwith them.* In the aecond place, Madame Blavataky had explicitly pro-\nnounced certain portiona of them to be forgeriea, when they were firat pub-\nliahed, and I ahould be aurpriaed to learn that ahe had ever expreBBed any\nwiah to Bee the originala while I waa at Madraa. Had ahe done BO, I have\nno doubt that BOme arrangement would have been made according to which\n&he would have had the liberty of inapecting them in the presence of wit-\nneuea. That I do not Bay thia unadviaedly ia sufficiently ahown by the fact\nthat BOme of the diaputed lettera were taken to the headquartera of tho\nSociety and ahown to Theoaophista, in September, 1884, in conaequence of a\nrequest by lIajor-General Morgan to see the letter in which he was con-\ncerned. The editor of the Chriatian CoUtge Magazine writes in the number\nfor April, 1885 :-\n\"We took with UI to headquartera four of the diaputed lettera, and\nfreely allowed all present to examine them. In return we aaked to be per-\nmitted to see BOme of Madame Blavataky's recent lettera to Dr. HartmanlJ,\nDamodar, or anyone at headquartera.

It was perfectly well known at the headquartera of the Society\nthat I was taking the evidence of witneaaes, that I had interviewa with the\nauthoritiea of the ChNtian Col,kge Magazine, and alao with the Coulomba;\nthat I waa inveatigating all the circumatancea in connection with every\nphenomenon BO far 1\\8 it WI\\8 poaaible for me to do so. Mr. Sinnett muat have\nbeen strangely misinformed about the facts of the caae, and his miaappre-\nhension baa already been once pointed out. In a letter to the Jo\"rnal for\nJuly, he spoke of my evidence as \"collected in secret\" (p. 4(2), and Pro-\nfeuor Sidgwick directed his attention to the fact \"that we took care to make\nit known to all concerned that Mr. Hodgaon had gone to India to collect this\nevidence on behalf of our Society, and that his unfavourable view of the\nevidence WI\\8 communicated to the leading Theosophists at Madraa before his\ndeparture from India\" (p. 4(4). Yet, notwithatanding thia explicit state-\nment made by Profel8Or Sidgwick, Mr. Sinnett apparently repeats the\ncharge. H he will turn to p. 16 of the Official Report of the Theoaophical\nSociety for 1885, he will find that Colonel Olcott made the following state-\n\u2022 I was allowed only a similar degree of liberty with certain documents which I\nobtained from Theoeophists.\nDigitized by Google\n\f112 Journal f!f Societ!\/ for P,gcllical Research.

He speaks of my\" unfamiliarity with India and Indian ways\" as\nbaving led me .. into many serious mistakes.\" Of course I do not claim the\nfamiliarity with India wbich Mr. Sinnett poasea8s, but I do not see how this\nfact can n.1l'ect my investigation in tho way Mr. Sinnett lOOms to suppose.

It was, at any rate, not unfamiliarity with Indian ways\nthat led the Paraee gentleman, Mr. K. M. Seervai, formerly Vice-President\nof the Theosophical Society at Bombay, to give up all connection with the\nSociety, or that led ?llr. S. K. Chatterjee, formerly President of tho Lahore\nBranch, to declare that the Society was \"a llUge imposture,\" or that led\nMr. A. O.

I hold it as a general principle,\nwhich it is mostly right and wise to oblerve, that the work of a committe&\nIhould not be publicly diacuued except on ita report to the Council; but as\nMr. Hughes baa given his version of this Committee's proceedings, and as his;\nltatements are in my estimation leriously misleading, I must ask you to be\nkind enough to alloW' me to offer lome remarks on the lubject.\nI was one of the members of the old Physical Phenomena Committee, and\nentered upon my duties in connection with it with considerable interes~. Mr.\nHughel was the secretary-not appointed by the Committee, who were left n~\nchoice in the matter, but by the Council. Like Mr. Hughes, I was under th&\nimpresaion that the Committee was not permitted to lpend the funds of the\nSociety in the employment of paid mediums. Professor Sidgwick _ya that\nno expressresolution to that effect was ever passed by the Council. That is.\nso no doubt-but the views of a body of gentlemen can often bereadily gauged\nwithout an expreaaresolution, and there can be no question, I think, that Mr.\nHughes' understanding of the views of the Council was in Itrict accordance\nwith fact. \" The consequence was,\" Mr. Hughes lays,\n.. that we were compelled to have recourse to the asaiatance of friends of &\nmember of the Committee who were BUp~ to ~ mediumistic powers.\nResults-table tilting. raps, &'c.-were obtained, which, if they could have\nbeen obtained undersatisfactory testa, would have been conclusive; but as such\nte&tscould not be applied, I myseU and other members of the Committee were\nnot convinced that these phenomena were not the result of fraud, conBcioDS or\nuncoDBCiouB.\"\nI cannot for a moment believe that Mr. Hughel would intentionally mis-\nrepresent ; but the .statements I have quoted are at variance with the facts\nnevertheless-a circumstance which appears to me to be explicable only on\nthe lupposition that the writer was incapable of correct oblervation, or that\nhe was the subject of a strong reluctance to be convinced by any evidence\nwhatsoever.\nAt the first meetings of the Committee we had no mediums present, and\nthere were no relults. In consequence of appeals that were made to me, I\ntook lOme members of my family to lubsequent meetings, but as they are\nnot medium'S fur anything more than slight table-movements, the results\nwere again valueless.\nHaving had 80 little SUCCIlIS hitherto, I was prell88d to try to induce my\nfriends, Mr. and Mr.. E., to attend at the next meeting, and they very\nkindly agreed to do 80. Mrs. E. il a lady of whOle excellent mediumistie\npowers I have had abundant evidence, on hundreds of occasions, during a.\ncourse of several years. Without fee or reward af any kind whatever, and\noften at great personal inconvenience, she baa always been ready to aasist\ncandid inquirers, in private seance, and it has never even been hinted, until\nMr. Hughes did 10, that ahe could be guilty of fraud .. conscious or\nunconacioul.\"\nOf the phenomena. which occurred at the Society'l rooms in the presenc&\nDigitized by Google\n\fNo~.,l885.] Journal of Bociet!\/\/or P8!lcllicnl Rellenrc!l. 115-\nof Mrs. E., I speak only of those which occurred in good gas light.

It was a circular table made for\nthe purpose-with the top and bottom exactly alike; the large, flat surface\non the ground making it impoaaible for any of the sitters to tilt it by\npreaaure without the exercise of 80 much force as to be plainly observable, it.\nbeing also impoaaible to insert the toe of a boot beneath the bottom edge.\nAfter sitting a few minutes frequent raps were distinctly heard on the table\nand on the floor, the vibrationa on the table being plainly felt by the handa\nof the sitters. On the occurrence of these raps Mr. Hughee expreaaed bim-\neelf both surprised and gratified.\nAgain. we had clear and undoubted tiltinga of the table while the handa\nofall the sitters were in full view. Mr. Hughes says that satisfactory testa\ncould not be applied! But they were applied-though not at hi.8 suggestion,\nbut at the suggestion of l\\lr. E. After we had had aeveral tiltinga of the table\nit rose 'luite oft\" the floor, and Mr. E. suggested, in ordllr that there might.\nbe no room for doubt as to the genuineneaa of the phenomena, that the menl-\nbera of the circle should all stand up and place the tips only of their fingem\nlightly lIpon the upper surface of the table. This was done, and the table\nwas not only lifted oft\" the floor, and gently put down again, but was moved\nin jerks along the floor a distance offrom 15 to 18inchea.\nMr. E. proposed another experiment. He said that in his own houae, if\nthe leaves of the table were drawn a little apart, what appeared to be fingers,\nand felt like finget'P, were often pushed up from boneath, under the\ncloth; and he suggeated that if a hole were cut in the table we were uaing,\nthat experiment might be tried at the next meeting of the CODmlittee. It\n\\t!(U tried and aucceeded ; and varioua members of the circle, if not all of\nthem, not only saw the movements, but felt the fingers or what they\ndeclared to feel like fingers. Was this the result of fraud, as l\\lr. Hughe&\nseems to hint, either\" conscioua or unconscious\"I All the handa of the\ncircle were visible.

DARIUS' MEDIUM.\nTo the Editm- oj the JOURNAL OF TIlE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RBluuBCJL\nSIR,-In your Journal for August, 1885, I observe two communications,\n-one from Mr. G. D. Haughton, 00 which is a reply by Mr Myers; in the\nformer is a paragraph referring to experiments conducted by myself, and in\nthe latter are remarks on Mr. Haughton's suggestions. As the remarks in\n~ach case are brief I quote them, and ask your pennission to reply to the\n-observations of Mr. Myers.\nMr. G. D. Haughton says (p 28): \"There is, however, quite enough to\ninterest and engage them at home, if their hearts are in the cause. Why\n-do they not investigate the case of Mr. Barkas, of Newcastle 1 He is a\n-credible witness-tile people of Newcastle know him well, his antecedent.\nwould aa.tisfy even Mr. Davics. Now I want t() know why the Barkas caae,\n.and the source of the replies made by an indifferently educated person to the\n.abstruse questions propounded, as recorded in the columns of Light, are not\nthoroughly and exhaustively e:u.mined 1 I suspect that a similar motive\nrules here as in the Eglinton case.

I consider\nthe case curious and interesting, and I am not surprised at Mr. Barkas' view\n-of it, but unfortunately the gross want of comprehension of the subjects\ninquired about, and the palpable blunders wllich the replies contain, seem\nto mo to preclude us from regarding them as affording evidence of the\n.guidance of a scientific spirit.\n\" The fact, moreover, that the same medium, under the name of Mrs.\nEsperance, was afterwards detected in personating a materialised spirit,\ntended to discourage me from seeking further evidence tllrougll that channel.\"\n1 desire very briefly to reply to tlle unintentionally unfair and illogi-\n<Cal criticisms of Mr. Myers.\nTile first Itas reference to tile alleged\" palpable blunders\" in tile written\n<communications, and the second to the alleged detection of the medium\n.. in personating a materialised spirit.\"\nI simply wish to aa.y in reference to the last charge that intelligent and\n-experienced investigators, who were at the seance when tho sllpposed detec-\ntion took place, deny the assertion utterly, and I personally affinn that if\nthe alleged personation really occurred it is not beyond experience that it\ntook place automatically and unconsciously so far as regards the mediwn.

If he doubts this I shall have pleasure, when next he visits\nNewcaatle, in showing him a book written by one of the moat eminent\nacientific men now in the world, in which there are recorda of many alleged\noriginal diaooveries, and many alleged new genera. named and figured, not\none of which is new, and not ODe of which is oorrect.

MYERS.\nREPORT ON \"IMPROMPTU REPLIES THROUGH A LADY\nPSYCHIC OF VERY LIMITED EDUCATION.\"\nI have been asked to expre88 my opinion of the answers given by Mr.\nBarkas' medium to a seriell of questions on scientific subjects, principally\nacoustics and the theory of mueic. My opinion is that they exhibit just\nthat amount of knowledge, or rather of complicated ignorance, which\nwmtld probably be acquired by a person of liulited education, but fairly\ngood verbal memory, after reading an old-fashioned treatise on acoustics, and\n8upplementing the perusal by a hasty glance or two at some more modem\npopular text-book.\nA good many sentences in the answers appear to be more or 1888 UMUC-\nee88ful attempts to reproduce passages out of the text-books read, the\n\u00b7quotation, in each case, being generally irrelevant to the question, and\nprobably suggested by BOrne catchword occurring in the latter. Having but\nfew books on the theory of BOund, and those not of a popular kind, I have\nn:>t been able to refer these passages to any particular treatise; but the\ninternal evidence is fairly convincing, as I think the following examples will\n1:Ihow: In seance No.5 (Light, March 14th, 1885), a question was asked\nabout the slnall hole made in the \u2022\u2022 boot\" of certain reed organ pipes in\n<trder to bring them into tune. The explanation is: \"Because in organ\npipes the souud is made to, I mean the air is made to vibrate by iBBuing\n.from a small slit and striking on a sbarp cutting edge.\" The\" small hole\"\nreferred to in the question is mistaken for tbe aperture through which air is\nforced into the pipe by the bellows, and we have a quotation, nearly a\nludicrous misquotation, of a description of the action of the mouthpiece of\n.an organ pipe. This is quite irrelevant to the question, and it is followed\nDigitized by Google\n\fNOT.,l883.} Journnl qf Socl~t!l.for PS!lchical Research. 119\nby the imbecile comment of the acientific intelligence himself: \"This should\nbe done in evety case: I don't know why in reed organs alone, since it\n\"Would be an advantage in evety case.\" Again, in the IllUDe seance, the\nqueatio:>n, \"What, in your opinion, is the origin of harmony 1\" is declared to\n-be vague, and .. reverted\" into \"What is the clliference between harmony\nand noise 1\" The term \"harmony\" is _then taken to be equivalent to\n\" mUBic\" or \"mUBical BOund,\" and we are treated to an explanation of this\nentirely clliferent question, the pusage which follows being, in my opinion,\nan obvious quotation, which is more accurate than usual.\nIt would be tedious, as well as IUperftuoUS, to examine all the answers in\ndetail ; they abound in wrong ideas, erroneous ltatement., and groll misUBe\nof acientific terma; lOme of them are, to me, absolutely unintelligible jargon.\nA:o.y one acquainted with the lubject. diBCUlled hal only to read the answers\n-for himself in orderto bo convinced of the truth of the aBl8rtionj but for the\nake of readers unacquainted with &COUBtica, I will examine a few of thele\noommunications, and point out, as plainly as I can, lome of their\ninaccuraciea.\n1. Quution. What are harmonica1 ('th leance\": Light, February\n21at, 1885.)\n.Anncer. By harmonica are meant those BOunda caused by the nodel or\n\"fentral aegment. ofstringed instrument. which occur in suceellion.\nComment. The term \" harmonica\" is not understood, and the answer is\nlIhBolutely worthlell ; moreover, since a node of a string for any particular\nform of vibration is a point of the Itring which does not share in that vibra-\ntion, we are in effect told that BOunda are caused by parts of stringed instru-\nment. which are vibrating, or by those which are Mt vibrating. Finally,\nharmonica are not confined to strillged instrument.. What il meant by the\n-ooncluding relative claUBe, and to which of the preCtlding lubetanti\\\"81 it\nrefers, I am unable to say.\n2. Question. H in a stopped pipe 0. hole be made at half.length, would\n.itaffect the pitch, and to what extent 1 (Gth Mance.)\n.Anncer. The pitch would not be affected, but the length of the wave\n\"Would be shortened by half.\nComment. This amount. to saying that tbe\"pitchlwould 110t be altered,\nbut the note BOunded would be an octave higher than before.\nThe remaining examples will be taken from the Mance of AUgUBt 30th.\n<Light, April 18th, 1885.)\n3. The first queltion recorded &aka for an account of the method by\nwhich the ratio of the specific heats of air for constant volume and constant\npressure reapectively may be found from the obeerved velocity of BOund, and\nthe velocity calculated by Newton's formula.\nMr. Barkaa and the guiding spirit both mistook \"heat.\" for \"beat.,\" in\n-spite of the context, which ought to have set them right: the result is the\nfollOwing answer:-\n\"The ratio can only be calculated in this manner. Suppose two chords\nto be struck, or two forks tuned at the IllUDe time : if the intensity of the\nBOUnd be the same, or nearly the same, the beat. will occur in this manner:\nSuppose one pulsation beat. at the rate of 228 per second, o.nd the other at\n220, the beat. will reach the ear at the rate of 228-220==9 per second; this\nDigitized by Google\n\f120 Journal of Sociefy for Psychical Research. (Nov., 1885.\nwill give you eight beats per second, and is the utmost that can be carried\nto the ear.\"\nEvidently the word ~'beats,\" supposed to belong to the question, baa\nbeen the only one to suggest any familiar passage of the text-books; 80 we\nhave an attempt to reproduce an explanation of the beats of jarring chords,\nthat is, the intervals of comparative silence produced by the interferenoe of\nthe vibrations of two bodies nearly in unison. This, of course, baa\nnothing to do with the question; and, takingthe answer on its own merita,\nthere is a blunder in eve~ sentence. For\" chords\" I suppose we must\nread\" strings\" or \"notes,' and for \"tuned\" subatitute \"Bet in vibration\";\nto say that \"one pulsation beats \" at such and such a rate is mere nonsense;\nand the crowning absurdity is achieved in the last Bentence, where \"beats\"\nhave been confounded with\" vibrations,\" and the eight beatB per second\nhave imperfectly recalled the lowest rate of vibration neceaaary to produoe\nthe impre88ion of a musical Bound.\n4. Question. When a musical note is vibrating at 300 per second, and\nanother at 200 per second, they produce a fifth. If the note which \\\\\"88\nsounded at 200 be raised to 201, at what number will the beat occur for the\nfirst time 1\nAn.tlrer. At exactly the aamenumber as in the first case, but a beat over\nthe original number will be BOunded, but that beat would be one octave\nlower than tlle first ones.\nComment. Utter nonsense from beginning to end. In the last clause,\npitch, which depends on the time occupied by each of a set of isochronous\nvibrations, is here actually attributed to an interval of silence, or if \u2022\u2022 beat ..\nbe taken to mean\" vibration,'\" to a lIingk vibration.\nThen come some questions on musicru intervals, and here, as might be\nexpected, Mr. -- Humnur Stafford -- completely breaks down. The\nonly fragments of correct information I have been able to discover are\n\" From C to D is a major tone,\" alld \"I do not understand the terms you\nuse.\" To illustrate the truth of tlle latter statement, take the explanation\nof a comllla (the difference between a major and a minor tone): \"That\ncessation of all sound caused by the coincidence and interference of BOund-\nwaves.\" What suggested this extraordinary answer I cannot say, unle88 the\nordinary meaning of the word, as a mark of punct.uation, suggested that it\nought, in music, to denote a pause of some kind.\nSo much for the amount of knowledge of sound and music posaesaed by\nthis dillembodied intelligence. It is only fair to add that he is conscious of\nits imperfection, and desirous of improving it. Thus we read: \"I am not\nso well acquainted with optics as you imagine, and will Mt'e to study a liU~~\nmoTll, or mtlier to rake my mem,ory Ol't'l', to be able to answer your question,\n&C. ; and again: \"I best understand the organ, piano, and harmonium ; the\nconversation can be on these or optics. IMt'e been getting tip that,80 if you\nhave any questions, I shall be glad to answer them.\"\nMr. Barkas seems to be afraid that clever unbtllievers, such as Me11lII'S.\nProctor and Lankester, will try to make out\" that the medium is clever, and\nwell acquainted with the topics introduced.\" I do not think he need be in\nany fear on this point. He also &l8erts that Blost E'ducated people would\nmiserably fail. in comparison with the controlled hand of the medium, in\nanswering these questions impromptu. They might do BO, I grant, in\npicturesquene88 and piquancy, scarcely in accuracy, especially if they\nenjoyed the privilege, accorded to Mr.-- Humnur Stafford--, of\nreceiving due notice beforehand, so as to be able to get up the subject.\nFinally, I cannot refrain from asking why the opinion of the eminent.\nprofe88or of music, who proposed the questions, has not been recorded.\nG.
