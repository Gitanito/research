F. Saltmarsh\nThe phenomenon of supernormal precognition is generally held to\nbe one of the most puzzling, the most mysterious of all the mysteries\nwhich are presented to the psychical researcher. That a human\nbeing, conditioned in space and time, should be able under certain\nrather rare and exceptional circumstances to acquire knowledge of\nfuture events raises problems of the utmost importance, not only for\npsychical research, but also for philosophy and metaphysics and\npossibly for physical science itself, for it seems obvious that the\nsolution of this problem must somehow involve a conception of the\nnature of time.\nObviously the first point to be determined is whether precognition\never actually occurs.\nThere can be no doubt that precognition of a sort is a reality ; we\ncan foretell many future events with more or less certainty. The\nastronomer predicts the movements of stars and planets, the chemist\nknows in advance the reactions of his reagents, the meteorological\nofiice, though not so conspicuously successful, achieves a percentage\nof true forecasts which is in excess of what might be attributable to\npure chance.\nIn the psychical realm we can sometimes predict a man's be-\nhaviour under given circumstances ; we are even more successful\nwhen dealing with crowds and the statistical determination of the\nannual figures of such things as marriage, murder and suicide, all\nof which are at least partially psychically determined, show a\nsurprising degree of accuracy.\nNow all these precognitions have one feature in common, they are\nbased on inferences from past experience and rely on the assumption\nthat the causes and conditions which have operated in the past will\nD 49\n\f50 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\ncontinue to do so with more or less uniformity in the future. They\nare all instances of what may be called normal precognition. But\npsychical research has to do with the supernormal.\nI have therefore made an examination of the records of the\nSociety, as embodied in the Journal and Proceeditigs , from its be-\nginning and have extracted and summarised all cases of precog-\nnition. It may be that I have overlooked some isolated examples of it\nwhich have occurred mixed up with other more striking phenomena\nor reported in a paper or article not specifically dealing with the sub-\nject, but I do not think that much of importance has been missed.\nI have included all the cases I could find in which an element of\nprecognition was apparent. As I shall show when I come to analyse\nthem, some of these may not be true examples of supernormal pre-\ncognition but may be susceptible of another explanation. Some I\nhave had to reject altogether on the grounds that the appearance of\nprecognition was either false or else too vague to be considered\nevidential ;\nthey are placed under the last two headings of my first\nclassification, i.e. vague or non-precognitive. The remainder of the\ncases which are considered as susceptible of another explanation\ncontain for the most part some supernormal element, such as tele-\npathy or hyperaesthesia, and the explanation suggested requires the\nassumption that these phenomena have occurred.\nIt must, however, be noted that the alternatives suggested are\nnever more than hypothetical and it may well be that if a final\nanalysis should show good grounds for holding that supernormal\nprecognition does sometimes occur, that interpretation may in many\nof the cases in question be preferred to the alternative. In the\nstatistics which follow I have included these possibly dubious cases\nbut have excluded those which, as I have said, I reject altogether.\nThe nature of the statistical facts is such that the question of alter-\nnative explanation has no relevance.\nI have also studied the few papers which have been read on the\nmatter, particidarly those of Mrs Sidgwick and Mr Myers, and I here\ndesire to acknowledge my indebtedness thereto.\nAlthough a few examples of precognition may have escaped my\nnet the haul is sufficiently impressive. I have been able to collect\nsome 349 cases ; some few of them are multiple, that is to say,\nrecording more than one instance.\nHaving summarised these cases I then proceeded to analyse and\nclassify them. I grouped them first under the type of impression\nand sub-divided each type into four headings, viz. Good, Ordinary,\nVague and not precognitive.\nA Good case is one where the precognition is particularly definite\nand detailed, or where the evidence is exceptionally good. An\nOrdinary case is one which, although it does not attain to the above\n\f134] Report OIL Gases of AjJparent Precoijnition 51\nstandard, is sufficiently evidential of precognition to be significant.\nThe fact that it has been deemed worthy of publication is itself some\nguarantee for this.\nI have classed as Vague those cases where there was nothing of a\ndefinite nature to indicate that a precognition had occurred or\nnothing conclusively to connect the event which is reported as\nfulfilling the prediction with the alleged precognition. For example :\nif A hears the ticks of a death watch and during the next few weeks\na relative dies, that would be a vague case. Or if B has a vague\nimpression of calamity or sees an unrecognised hallucinatory vision,\nand subsequently experiences some misfortune to which there was\nno obvious reference in the impression or hallucination, the case\nwould come under this class.\nThe class of non-precognitive cases are those where there is reason\nto think that the event referred to was simultaneous with or prior\nto the dream, impression, hallucination, etc. or else that the whole\nthing was clearly attributable to mere chance.\nThe following is the result of the analysis :\nc\nc\no\nc O\nm\nS '\n11\n'Ij\nC a\n0\/\norcic\no\n'o 6CllU\nm 1\n\u2014\n1\n\"3\nGood - - - - 76 4 14 17 20 3\nOrdinary ... 40 3 25 45 31 3\nVague - - - - 11 8 23 6\nNon-precognitive - 9 4 2 5\n136 7 51 87 62 6\nBefore discussing the figures a few remarks on the various head-\nings should be made.\nBorderland cases\u2014a very small class\u2014are those where the impres-\nsion occurs between sleep and waking, so that it is impossible to say\nwhether it was a dream or waking impression. I do not think that\nthere is any particular significance in this division of classification,\nbut it appeared to me desirable to make it for the sake of accuracy.\nImpressions are, of course, waking impressions not attaining the\nstatus of definite hallucination.\nMediumistic cases include predictions made by recognised med-\niums together with a. very few cases of precognition in hysteria and\nanalogous states.\nCrystal cases, another very small class, are precognitions occurring\n\f52 H. F. Sahmarsh [part\nwhile crystal-gazing, or during some other form of scrying. It is\nclear that the dividing line between the classes is not in some cases\nperfectly hard and fast. For example, crystal-gazing cases might\nwell be included in the mediiimistic class, or an impression might\nalmost reach the point of hallucination.\nAlso there are cases where several types are joined together, e.g.\na precognitive dream may be preceded or followed by an impression,\nor else A may have a dream while B experiences an hallucination,\nboth apparently having the same reference. Although there is this\nunavoidable lack of definition in some cases the majority fell into\ntheir respective classes clearly and definitely, and I do not think that\nany conclusions which may be drawn from the figures would be mate-\nrially affected by any re-arrangement which might possibly be made.\nIt will be observed that, with the possible single exception of\nwaking impressions, all the classes occur in states wherein there is\nsome dissociation. Even in the case of impression it is not un-\nreasonable to suppose that some slight dissociation occurs, as there\nare instances where the impression was so overwhelming as almost\nto amount to hallucination. The impression comes into the mind,\nnot by association with any of its supraliminal contents, but appar-\nently as imposed on it from without ; it possesses an unaccountable\ncompulsive force. It cuts through and intrudes upon the normal\nflow of thought. Now, if all cases of precognition are accompanied\nby or take place during a state of dissociation, I think it may be\nconcluded with a fair degree of certainty that the part of the mind\ninvolved is the subliminal.\nThis, perhaps, is not a very striking or original conclusion ; in\nfact it is only what we should have expected a priori. I merely\nwish it to be put on formal record at the very outset of the inquiry as\nit may be found later on to have an important bearing on theory. To\nturn now to the figures themselves. It will be noticed that the dream\nis a long way the most prolific source of precognitions ; moreover it is\namong dream cases that we find the highest percentage of good cases.\nHallucinations come next in point of number but fall rather low\nin the proportion of good to ordinary ; moreover there is an un-\nusually high percentage of vague cases. This, I think, is perfectly\nreasonable. From the nature of an hallucination the details given\nare not as a rule as full as with a dream, so that definite reference\nto a particular event, the absence of which renders a case liable to be\nrelegated to the vague class, is less likely to be found and recorded.\nAs examples of this one might cite the fairly numerous cases where\nthe percipient hears unaccountable knocks or ticks and shortly\nafterwards suffers the loss by death of a near relation. The knocks\nmay be a vague precognitive phenomenon not reaching to the\nheight of definite knowledge, but in t^^\". absence of any indication\n\f134] Beporf on Cases of Apparent Precognition 53\nof tlie identity of the person to whom they refer, even where the\npercipient regards them as a warning of approaching death or\nbereavement, the cases are so nebulous and uncertain that they\ncannot be held to be of any value as evidence.\nThe next class, mediumistic, presents a better average of good\ncases, though still falling far short of dreams in this respect, while\nthe percentage of vagues is roughly the same. As regards this class,\nhowever, I feel that little or no reliance can be placed on any con-\nclusions based on numbers, for I cannot regard my collection as\nbeing in any way a fair sample of the total amount of precognitive\nmatter found in the iitterances of trance mediums. I should say\nthat the number of mediumistic cases of precognition actually pub-\nlished bears a very small ratio to the total of such cases. From my\nown knowledge of Mrs Leonard's trance utterances, a knowledge\nwhich covers only a relatively small fraction of the whole, it appears\nto me that instances of apparent precognition are fairly frequent.\nThey may not be of a very striking character, but this, from the\ntheoretical point of view, is irrelevant. Precognition of the most dull\nand commonplace events demands explanations just as much as\ndoes the most startling prophecy.\nMediumistic cases possess the advantage of being able to give a\ngreater amount of detail than is possible with hallucinations or\nimpressions, though they fall short of dreams in this respect. This,\nsubject to the uncertainty of conclusions drawn from the number\navailable, is shown in the somewhat higher ratio of good to ordinary\ncases.\nAs regards impressions we have to take into account a special\nconsideration. Precognitive dreams are, as a rule, of peculiarly\nimpressive character, which renders them more liable to be remem-\nbered and recounted by the dreamer than are the ordinary normal\ndreams. While it is true, as some of us know to our cost, that there\nare people who habitually bore the breakfast table with accounts of\ntheir dreams, to the credit of humanity it must be admitted that\nsuch malefactors are comparatively rare. The dreams they tell are\nfor the most part very dull and ordinary.\nThe peculiar characteristics possessed by the true precognitive\ndream induces the dreamer sometimes to record it in writing, some-\ntimes to regard it as a warning to be acted upon, but more often to\nrecount it to other people with special emphasis. Mediumistic pre-\ncognitions are for the most part embodied in the records of sittings,\nwhile hallucinations are sufficiently uncommon and striking events\nto be specially noted and remembered. Impressions, however, may\nrange from the vague feelings of disquiet which, I suppose, everyone\nis liable to experience, up to those so relatively massive and detailed\nas to amount almost to hallucination.\n\f54 H. F. SaUmarsh [part\nIt would occur to no one to note and remember every passing\nimpression, and thus it must happen that many which might pos-\nsibly be precognitive are passed by and forgotten. Even of those\nwhich are remembered and recognised as having been fulfilled, many\nare likely to be deemed unworthy of being reported. It is only the\nmost impressive that would be considered sufficiently interesting\nto be placed on record.\nThere are cases where the impression is definitely felt to concern\nsome particular person, there are others where it is so strong as to\nbe regarded as a warning to be acted upon. It is significant that\nthere is a larger proportion of warning cases with impressions than\nwith any of the other types.\nI think that we are safe in assuming from these considerations\nthat the reported cases of impression do not represent so high a per-\ncentage of the total number of such incidents as with dream or\nhallucination. One would have expected, a priori, that the pro-\nportion of good to ordinary would be lowest among impressions,\nwhereas, though last but one in the list, it is considerably above\nhallucination.\nI think that this may be accounted for by the fact that the poorer\ncases would be thought not worth reporting, or, if reported, not\nworth publishing.\nAs regards the remaining two types, viz. Borderland and Crystal-\ngazing, the number of these cases is so small that the figures can\nhave no significance as statistics.\nThe percentage of cases rejected as non-precognitive has no\ninterest.\nWe are left then with the following supply of material\n:\na\nas\na\no\n_S\nO\nS \"C\no\n'w a\na s t\/J\n0;\nfi Bord alluc:\n3\no\nK\nGood - - - - 76 4 14 17 20 3\nOrdinary . - - 40 3 25 45 31 3\n116 7 39 62 51 6\nor 281 cases in all.\nIn rejecting the vague and non-precognitive cases I do so for\nsafety's sake ;\nif, on the evidence of those remaining, supernormal\nprecognition is found actually to occur, then some of these rejected\ncases may well have been real instances of it.\n\f134] Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition 55\nI have made a further classification of the good and ordinary cases\nunder the headings of the type of incident to which the precognition\nrefers. This is as follows :\no\nO\n3\n'\n-ji\nfi\n+2\n03\na\nm\n*3 c6\n-t-\u00bb\n1\u2014\ni\nO\nUnii\n1\n1\nU\n1\n1\nCCllU\n>i\nU\nO\nw\nJJeatn irom natural causes 9 Q\nO 29 10\nDeath from accident Q\nu A\n4: 5 Q\nO\nvourse 01 niness a 4-\n3 5\nAccident not involving\ndeath - - - - 11 3 3 2\nAccident to material\nthmgs, such as nres, etc. 17 11 6 2\nTrivial incidents 35 6 5 21 3\nIncidents not trivial 3 4 3 1\nArrival cases - - - 5 2 8 2\nWinning numbers, win-\nners of races, etc. 6 2 1 6\n120 39 63 55 6\nIt will be observed that the totals in this classification are in some\ninstances slightly higher than the total number of cases given above.\nThis is, of course, because some of the cases exhibit precognition\nof more than one type of incident.\nThere is a certain amount of ambiguity between some of these\nheadings. For example, an accident to a material thing such as a\nfixe or carriage accident, might be classed as such or as an incident,\ntrivial or not, according to its nature. In actual practice, this\nparticular ambiguity has not been felt. I have experienced no\ndifiiculty in classifying under these headings except perhaps, in a\nvery few cases, certainly not sufficiently numerous materially to\naffect results.\nOf course, the distinction between trivial and not trivial is very\nvague. However, in most cases no doubt arose. One would not\nclass precognitions of the Great War under the heading of trivial\nincidents, or even such a matter as the failure of the bank wherein\nthe dreamer had her money. On the other hand, the call of a com-\nmercial traveller selling books could hardly be called anything but\ntrivial.\nUnder accidental death I have classed the few cases of death by\nmurder.\n\f56 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nUnder arrival cases I have included arrivals of ])ersons and mess-\nages, such as letters and telegrams. Under winning number cases,\nnumbers drawn in lotteries, games of chance, also some cases of\nprecognition of the numbers drawn by men called up for military\nservice, precognition of cards drawn from a pack, winners of races\nand so on.\nThe other headings are, I think, sufficiently clear to need no\ncomment.\nThere is perhaps one point concerning death from natural causes\nwhich should be mentioned. There are one or two cases where the\nactual cause of death was a natural one, but brought about or\nintensified as the result of an accident. In these I have used my\ndiscretion in deciding whether the accident or the illness was the\npredominant cause.\nTaking all the types of precognition together, the most numerous\nof the incidents foreseen was death, either natural or accidental,\nbeing 72 natural and 27 accidental. Running it very close, however,\ncome incidents, 70 trivial and 12 not trivial. It is, perhaps, worthy\nof notice that hallucinations give a far higher ratio of precognitions\nof death to those of incidents than do any of the other classes, and\nthis is significant (see Appendix B). This seems explicable by the\ngreater emotional tone involved, which may reasonably be held to\nhave some connection with the generation of hallucination. The\nstatistics of phantasms show conclusively that a state of crisis is\nsomehow connected casually with their occurrence, and it appears\nlikely that a similar nexus may exist with precognitions.\nThe ratio of death to incident in mediumistic cases is somewhat\nlower than with the other types ;\nbut, as was pointed out above,\nstatistics in this class cannot be considered reliable.\nI do not think that there are any other points in connection with\nthese figures which merit special mention at this stage.\nA further classification has been made in which the numbers of\ncertain special types have been extracted. This is as follows :\nc\nc o\nS ce\nDrea\nBorderl Impres;\nHallucin\nMedium\nCrysti\nCollective - _ - 2 2 9\nRecurrent - - - 6 1 5 2\nSymliolic ... 6 9\nWarning ... 12 2 9 10 1\n\f134] Report on Cases of Apparent Prcrognition 57\nOf these, collective dreams are more of a curiosity than of much\npractical importance. Neither of the two cases which I have are of\nthe good class.\nIn the first, Proceedings, xiv. 253, Dr Howard and another student\nof Columbia University, both dream on the night before the boat-\nrace that Columbia would win. Presumably they were all excited\nabout the race, so that there is nothing very remarkable in two of\nthem dreaming that the same crew would win. The full report of\nthe case reads better than my bald abstract, but it is scarcely, if at\nall, beyond chance.\nThe second case. Journal, xiii. 118, Mr E. J. and his wife have\napparently simultaneous dreams of his mother. In Mrs J.'s dream\nshe is told that the mother will not live for another three months.\nFulfilled. However, the mother was 83 years of age and expected\nto die at any time. Again a very poor case. In fact, neither of them\nwould have been mentioned but for their interest as curiosities ;\nas\nevidence of precognition they are almost worthless, apart from the\nsmall additional value afforded by the fact of collectivity.\nIt is conceivable that collective dreams might occur owing to\ntelepathic suggestion from one dreamer to another, or by the opera-\ntion of an external cause acting on both sleepers simultaneously, and\nit would be of interest to know if any such cases, whether precogni-\ntive or not, could be found.\nCollective hallucinations are fairly common, so it is not surprising\nthat some instances should be found among precognitive cases. The\nproblems raised by the cases do not directly concern the matter of\nprecognition. Whether they are due to telepathic suggestion from\none of the percipients to the other, or to the operation of an external\nagency acting simultaneously on more than one person, need not be\ndiscussed here. The fact of collectivity, however, gives a certain\nadded impressiveness to the phenomenon.\nRecurrent cases, whether of dream or any other type, certainly\ngive the impression of a persistent cause, either external or internal.\nA dream repeated two or three times is more likely to be remem-\nbered and noticed, and where the evidential conditions are good, the\ncase gains greatly in impressiveness. It is true that the hypothesis\nof an illusion of memory may sometimes have a certain plausibility\nhere, inasmuch as it might be suggested that the dream really\noccurred only once and that the apparent repetition was due to a\nfalse memory. However when dreams occur on different nights or\nat fairly long intervals on the same night, or even where the dreamer\nwakes and is sufficiently impressed by the first dream to note it parti-\ncularly and be perturbed by it, this hypothesis is hardly tenable.\nApart from illusion of memory these cases are of particular value\nbecause the possibility of explanation by chance is much reduced.\n\f58 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nIt might be due to chance that I should dream of an event which is\ngoing to happen next day, but that 1 should do so twice running is\nfar more unlikely.\nThat there should be some amount of symbolism, particularly\namong the dreams and hallucinations, is only what might have been\nexpected. In fact, I am rather surprised that the number of such\ncases is not higher. As has been conclusively shown by the investi-\ngations of Freud and Jung, symbolisation plays a very important\npart in dream formation. It is a device frequently resorted to by\nthe subliminal mind, and, as I suggested in my report on the Warren\nElliott sittings, it is part of the mechanism of transference from one\nstratum of consciousness to another. The fact that it is not more\nin evidence, being only 5 to 6% in dreams and 14% to 15% for\nhallucinations, should be noted. It may be that this is partly due to\nthe symbols not being recognised as such, though in many cases the\nprecognition takes the form of a more or less accurate picture of the\nevent foreseen wherein no question of symbolism seems to be in-\nvolved. It is possible that were the symbolism of our dreams more\nfully recognised and correctly interpreted we should find many\ninstances of precognition.\nWarning cases have a double importance. First, as regards\nevidential value and secondly for theory. I will not discuss the latter\nnow. As regards the former, it is, I think, clear that the fact that\nthe dream, impression, etc., has been regarded as a warning and in\nmany cases has been acted upon, lends weight to the evidence. It\nshows that the percipient has been impressed by his experience\nbeyond the ordinary, for one's conduct is not, as a rule, governed in\nany way by one's ordinary dreams.\nIt is therefore more likely for the account given to be full and\naccurate. One of the peculiar characteristics of dreams, and to some\nextent of all subliminal phenomena, is that memory of them tends\nto vanish more rapidly than in the case of waking experience. Un-\nless the memory be fixed and reinforced by special attention it is\nlikely to vanish completely in a short time.\nI have, therefore, in assessing the evidential value of any case,\nallowed considerable weight to instances of warning.\nThis is perhaps as suitable a place as any to give some account of\nthe methods which I adopted in assessing evidential value. I made\nfive classes for evidential status, as follows.\nE 1. Impression recounted beforehand, confirmed by documents\nor reliable independent witnesses.\nE 2. Acted upon beforehand. Warning cases.\nE 3. Told afterwards and confirmed by independent witnesses as\nregards the telling and the details of the fulfilment.\nE 4. Not told but percipient deeply impressed. i\n\f134] Beport on Gases of Apparent Precognition 59\nE 5. Mere narrative.\nIn addition to this classification I allotted a fiu'tlier index for the\namount of detail involved and the degree of fulfilment.\nD 1. Detailed impression, fulfilled and verified.\nD 2. Detailed impression, partially fulfilled.\nD 3. No details.\nThus a case possessing the highest evidential value would be one\nmarked E 1, D 1, a case having only E 5, D 3 would be practically\nvalueless, most probably would be rejected as vague.\nI here reproduce the notes which I made for my own guidance after\na preliminary survey, although they to some extent forestall the\ndiscussion on theory. I do so in order that readers may know\nexactly what was in my mind when classifying the cases, and may\nbe helped thereby to criticise my methods.\nI laid down the following conditions for an ideally perfect case.\n(1) It\u2014the precognition\u2014must have been told or recorded before\nfulfilment, or acted upon in such a manner as to afford evidence of\nforeknowledge.\n(2) It must include details so that chance fulfilment is rendered\nunlikely.\n(3) The precognition must indicate fairly narrow limits of time\nfor fulfilment, or else must contain such details as to fix the occasion\nof fulfilment, e.g. on visiting a certain place (see 8).\n(4) It must be of such a nature that inference from considerably\nwider knowledge and with considerably enhanced powers of infer-\nence, could not reasonably have been held to have afforded the\nforeknowledge.\n(5) It must be of such a nature that suggestion, whether auto-\nor hetero-, conscious or unconscious, could not have brought about\nthe fulfilment.\n(6) It must be of such a nature that the information was not in\nthe possession of any other person so that it could have been con-\nveyed telepathically to the percipient. The information in such\ncases would include the intention to perform certain actions.\n(7) It must be of such a nature as to exclude hyperaesthesia of\nany extent which might reasonably be considered possible.\n(8) The time interval between the prevision and the fulfilment\nmust be sufficiently long to exclude the illusion of deja vu and suffi-\nciently short, on the other hand, to reduce the probability of chance\nfulfilment to negligible proportions. This latter limit is dependent\non the circumstances of the prevision, such as the nature and amount\nof the details foreseen.\nNote A. In the matter of time there must be taken into account\nthe interval which has elapsed before the incident is reported. When\ndocuments are forthcoming this may not be of very much importance\n\f60 H. F. Salfmarsh [part\nbut documentary evidence is rare. The lapse of a considerable time\nbefore reporting and investigation reduces the evidential value in\ncases where the account depends entirely on memory. People are\nliable to embroider their narratives and memory is unreliable.\nConfirmatory accounts should be independent. Action taken before\nfulfilment is, from some points of view, better evidence than con-\nfirmatory accounts.\nNote B. Details are more easily given in visual premonitions,\nhence dreams, visual hallucinations and crystal visions furnish the\nbest cases. In auditory cases, those where actual words are given in\nthe premonition, approximate in evidential value to the above, but\nthe number of details can never be so full. The number of details\nis important, the evidential value rising by a function of the product\nof the number and not by mere addition.\nThe trivial details are evidentially more valuable than broad\ngeneral features.\nIncorrect details do not necessarily deduct much from evidential\nvalue.\nThis concludes the preliminary discussion and I now propose to\ngive samples of the various classes. I have summarised the accounts\nas briefly as possible in order to keep this paper within reasonable\ndimensions.

It is unnecessary for my\npresent purpose to weary the reader with the recital of a larger\nnumber, although it would be possible to give many instances of\nmost of the types.\nWe must now turn to the consideration of the main purpose of\nthis inquiry, viz. the discovery of hypotheses to account for the\nphenomena.\nThere are, first of all, four such possible hypotheses which may be\nheld to be the most probable explanation in certain cases. These\nare, (1) Telepathy, (2) Auto-suggestion, (3) Subconscious knowledge,\n(4) Hyperaesthesia.\nBefore discussing these in detail I should like to point out that\nthey are all based on mental phenomena which involve, as a general\nrule, some amount of dissociation, thus linking up with what was\nsaid earlier concerning the state of the percipient.\nCases of precognition where an explanation based on telepathy\ncan plausibly be put forward are for the most part arrival cases. In\nthis it may be held that some person connected with the arrival\n\f64 H. F. SaUmarsh \\\n[part\nwhich is to be, is thinlving of the coming event at the time the per-\ncipient receives the impression and that this thought is conveyed\ntelepathically.\nIt need not, of course, be only an arrival. Any event which is\nplanned beforehand might be the subject matter of a precognition\nof this sort. The intention to act in a certain manner may be trans-\nmitted telepathically, and the percipient may receive it as an im-\npression of something about to occur or as a dream or hallucination\nrepresenting the scene as imagined. This hypotheses, while fairly\ncovering the simpler arrival cases such as that of a letter or visitor,\ngets a little thin when stretched to include some of the more com-\nplicated.\nAs an example of this I quote a case told to me by the percipient\nsome years ago. Unfortunately, it is not available for formal report,\nthe percipient having died some time since, so it is only of use as an\nillustration and not as evidence.\nThe percipient, the wife of a minister, was expecting a visitor, a\nbrother minister from a town some distance away, to lunch. She\nwas sitting in a room on the first floor, overlooking the road, and\nabout lunch time looked out of the window and saw her visitor\nwalking up to the house. She recognised him perfectly and noticed\nthat he was dressed in a fashion very unlike his usual attire. She\nrang the bell for the maid to set on the lunch and went downstairs\nto the front door to admit him. On opening the door she was sur-\nprised to find no one in sight. At the time of the occurrence the\nvisitor was at a railway station some miles away, having missed his\ntrain. He arrived later in the day. When he arrived the percipient\nsaw that he was dressed in the, for him, unusual fashion which she\nhad noticed in the halhicinatory vision.\nNow it is quite possible that while he was waiting on the station\nhe might have thought of himself as arriving at the door of the\nhouse which he was to visit, but it requires some amount of stretching\nof the telepathic hypotheses that the projected phantasm should\ninclude details of his clothing. He might, of course, have been more\nthan usually conscious of his attire owing to its not being his ordinary\nfashion, but one would expect that the phantasm would represent\nhis more normal appearance.\nI am aware that this particular case might Ije attacked on several\ngrounds, such as that it is not a premonition at all, but a simple case\nof mistaken recognition. I am not going to trouble to answer any\nsuch objections as I do not cite the case as evidence, only as an\nillustration.\nIn the following case, P. xi, 503, E 5, D 1 } the telepathic hypo-\nthesis requires even more stretching. The facts are : Professor J.\n^ Though tliis has to be classed E 5, 1 think it really merits a higher marking.\n\f134] Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition 05\nThoulet, waking from sleep, thinks that he has a telegram in his\nhand and goes into the room in which his friend is sleeping and says,\n\" You have got a little girl, the telegram says ...\" He begins to\nread the imaginary telegram when it vanishes and he realises that\nhe has been dreaming. He wrote down what he had read. Ten\ndays later a telegram corresponding to the one seen in the dream\nactually arrives. M. Thoulet is able to recognise the words he had\nseen but not read aloud.\nIn order to make the telepathic hypothesis cover this case we\nmust assume that the wording of the telegram had been decided\nupon ten days before the event which it was to announce had\nhappened. This, though possible, seems rather unlikely, especially\nas the sex of the unborn child could not have been known.\nThus we get a graduated series of cases starting from those which\nthe telepathic hypothesis will cover with ease, and working up to\ninstances which require more and more stretching.\nNow, although the canons of scientific methodology may compel\nus to give preference to this hypothesis on the grounds that telepathy\nis an already established phenomenon, yet the fact that its applica-\nbility tails off as it were rather tends to discredit it. If in the more\ncomplex cases we find that telepathy alone cannot satisfactorily\nexplain the facts, and should we be successful in finding another\nexplanation, then I think that even in the simpler cases we should\nhave to bracket the two hypotheses together as alternatives. We\ncannot reject telepathy in cases where it fits, because we know, or at\nleast most of us feel pretty well convinced, that telepathy exists.\nThe net result is to throw some doubt on the matter and restrain\nus in our endeavours to stretch the hypothesis to cover other types\nof cases.\nI have made a list of the cases wherein I consider that the tele-\npathic hypothesis may reasonably be held to apply. I have included\nthose instances where a fair amount of stretching is necessary, such\nas the one just quoted.\nThe result is : Dream 9 ;\nImpression 9 ; Hallucination 9 ;\nMediumistic 2 ;\nCrystal 1.\nThe next hypothesis to be discussed is that of auto-suggestion.\nIt is possible, of course, that hetero-suggestion might also operate\nin bringing about the fulfilment of a precognition ; but so far as I\nhave been able to discover there is no case in those under review\nwhere this seems reasonably plausible.\nAs a typical case where auto-suggestion seems a possible explana-\ntion the following may be cited.\nJ. iv. 292-3. E4, D2. Mrs Edwards has an auditory hallucination\nwarning her that she will die at a certain hour. As the clock was\nstriking the hour she had a severe haemorrhage and very nearly died.\nE\n\f66 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nIt seems plausible to suggest that the hallucination acted by auto-\nsuggestion to bring about the haemorrhage at that exact moment.\nI do not think that there is much that need be said on this point.\nWe are aware of the very powerful influence which auto-suggestion\ncan exert, particularly in cases where there is already some patho-\nlogical state of the organism.\nThe number of the causes which I have extracted as being\npossibly due to this cause is as follows : Dream 3 ;\nImpression 2 ;\nHallucination 7 ; Mediumistic 1.\nIt may perhaps be worthy of note that the percentage is higher\nwith hallucinations than among the other types. This seems quite\nreasonable in that hallucination, being a more exciting and notable\nevent than a dream or impression, would tend to be stronger in\ninciting to auto-suggestion.\nThe next hypothesis, viz. Subconscious knowledge, is perhaps the\none which possesses the greatest possibilities of extension. On this\nhypothesis the apparently supernormal precognition is reduced to\nthe normal type, that is to say, a prediction based on inference from\nknown facts and causes, only in this case they are subliminally\nknown. We have also to suppose in many cases a considerably\ngreater power of inference than is possessed by the supraliminal\nmind.\nIt is obvious that the possible range of this hypothesis is extremely\nindefinite. What limits are we to place on the possibility of sub-\nhminal knowledge and inference ? Is it true, as some determinist\nphilosophers have held, that if we could know the exact state of\naffairs down to the minutest details at any given moment, and if we\nalso possessed the necessary powers of calculation, we could predict\nthe state of affairs at any future time with complete certainty ?\nAnd if this be true, can we assume that any human being could\npossess this knowledge and these powers of calculation, whether\nsupra- or subliminally ?\nIf these suppositions be accepted, then all apparently supernormal\nprecognitions are simply disguised cases of normal prediction. We\nhave found an explanation which will cover the whole lot. As a\nmatter of personal opinion I doubt very much whether any such\nview can be seriously entertained. I regard the necessary supposi-\ntions as being so extremely far-fetched and wildly improbable, in\nview of our knowledge of the human mind and its limitations, that\nthe question hardly merits serious discussion.\nConsider, for example, the case of Mrs Atlay, P. xi. 487, of which\nI have given a short summary in my list of specimen cases. If the\ndeterminist theory be correct, all the causes, or causes of causes,\nwhich produced the event of the pig escaping from its sty and\nwandering into the dining room during prayers were in existence at\n\f134] Report on Gases of Apparent Precogmtiort 07\nthe time Mrs Atlay was dreaming, and we must assume that she\nsomehow became aware of them. How complex this interlocking\nsystem of causes must have been we can hardly imagine. It would\ninclude the state of the fastening of the door of the sty, the state of\nmind of the pig, if I may be allowed to speak of states of mind in\nconnection with pigs, also the motives which induced it first to\nescape, and second to wander into the dining room. Besides all this\nthere would be innumerable other factors such as the absence of\nanyone en route to head him off and lead him ignominiously back to\ncaptivity, the causes of a free passage, such as open doors or window\nin the dining room, etc.\nThen, having acquired all these data, Mrs Atlay's subconscious\nmind must have engaged in a process of calculation as a result of\nwhich she foresaw the inevitable outcome of all the interacting\nfactors.\nOur normal knowledge of the psychology of our fellow human\nbeings is insufficient to allow us to make accurately dated forecasts\nof their actions except in comparatively simple cases. Our know-\nledge of the psychology of pigs is far smaller than that of human\nbeings. Can we reasonably suppose that our subliminal powers so\ngreatly transcend those of our supraliminal minds ?\nThere are, however, types of cases in which this hypothesis of\ninference from subliminal knowledge seems plausible. They are for\nthe most part cases involving the precognition of states of the\norganism, either predictions of the coiirse of an illness or of death\nfrom natural causes. They are, in short, a sort of supernormal\nmedical prognosis.\nIt is clear that in such cases the cause of the precognition may be\njoined to or supplemented by one or more of the other causes men-\ntioned. Thus, if by inference from subliminal knowledge the per-\ncipient forecasts the progress of his disease, auto-suggestion may\noperate to bring about some definite happening at the exact moment\nforetold. Where the prognostication concerns some other person it\nmay be that the knowledge on which the inference is based is\nacquired telepathically from the patient, or possibly by hyperaesthe-\nsia, and in such case unconscious hetero-suggestion might come into\nplay to produce definite results. Whether the latter phenomenon\ndoes actually occur I cannot say. I have not been able to find any\nclear indication of its presence.\nAs examples of cases in which this hypothesis seems plausible I\nwould refer to P. xi. 446 ; J. xii. 340 ; P. v. 293 ; P. xi. 443,\nsummarised above.\nThe number of cases in which I have considered that it might be\nreasonably held to apply is as follows : Dream 10, Borderland 2,\nImpression 5, Hallucination 19, Mediumistic 7, Crystal 1.\n\f68 H. F. Saltniarsh [part\nThe last of these hypotheses, viz. hyperaesthesia, is applicable\nalmost entirely in cases involving an accident to some material\nobject. The following are typical examples.\nP. xi. 418. E 2, I) 3. Anon. A lady living in a wooden house\nin the Kockies, while sitting one evening in the porch, has an\nhallucinatory vision of a fire in the distance. After watching for\nabout ten minutes she hears a faint crackling sound, and, being\ndisturbed by the hallucination which at the time she takes to be real,\nshe goes to investigate and finds her own house on fire. She is just\nin time to save her child.\nAs lending some support to the hypothesis of hyperaesthesia it is\ninteresting that the same percipient experienced a second somewhat\nsimilar occurrence. While in England she was wakened one night\nfrom sleep by the impression of hearing her name called. On waking\nshe found the nightlight blazing.\nP. xi. 419. E 2, D 3. C. W. Moses, engineer in charge of a train,\nwhile driving his engine feels the impulse to stop the train when\napproaching a trestle bridge. He does so and goes ahead to investi-\ngate. He finds the bridge destroyed by fire, and a serious accident\nis thus avoided. This might have been due to hyperaesthesia of\nsmell or else some difference in the noise of the wheels on the\nrails.\nP. xi. 421. E 2, D 3. M. H. Gray has hallucinatory vision of\nflames. Investigates and finds the clothes in the laundry on fire.\nMight have been hyperaesthesia of smell or hearing, although two\nclosed doors intervened. Where this hypothesis appears to be a\nreasonable explanation the case, of course, ceases to be a true pre-\ncognition, as hyperaesthesia presumes the actual existence at the\ntime of the event supernormally cognised.\nThe number of such cases is. Borderland 1, Impression 6, Hallu-\ncination 4.\nTaking together all the cases which have been selected as possibly\nexplicable by one or other of these four hypotheses we get the\nfollowing totals : Dream 22, Borderland 3, Impression 22, Hallu-\ncination 39, Mediumistic 10, Crystal-gazing 2.\nIn making this selection I have tended to stretch the hypotheses\nas far as they could reasonably be stretched. I have no doubt that\nin a good many cases some people would think that I had overdone\nit, but on the principle that an explanation by known causes is\nbetter than one that postulates the unknown, I thought it right to\nbe as liberal as possible. If it should happen that an hypothesis is\nfound which can account for precognition in general, and is based on\nestablished fact, then these categories would be subject to revision.\nAfter deducting the cases as enumerated above we have left a\nconsiderable residuum for which some other explanation must be\n\f134] Report on Cases of Ajyparent Precognition 69\nfound. There remains 94 cases of Dream, 4 Borderland, 17 Impres-\nsion, 23 Hallucination, 41 Mediumistic, 4 Crystal-gazing. This\nconstitutes a mass of evidence far too weighty to be set aside.\nThere is, of course, one general hypothesis covering all possible\ntypes of precognition which so far has not been mentioned, viz. that\nthey are all due to chance coincidence. This is the view that is\ngenerally held by the uninstructed and those who have not made an\nunbiassed study of the evidence.\nI have had it said to me when discussing the matter with persons\nnot acquainted with the subject, \" Millions of people dream every\nnight. It is, therefore, only what might be expected that some of the\ndreams should correspond with what happens during the next few\ndays.\"\nThere is a superficial appearance of reasonableness about this\nargument when stated thus vaguely ; but I thinlc that if it be put\ninto more definite form it will be seen to be quite untenable. It is\ntrue that millions of people dream every night, but the proportion\nof dreams which are remembered is comparatively small, and out\nof this fraction there is an even smaller proportion which exhibit the\npeculiarly impressive character which so often marks the premoni-\ntory dream and causes it to be recorded. We cannot have, unfor-\ntimately, any statistics of such dreams whereby we can arrive at an\nestimate of the numbers which turn out to be false premonitions.\nStill I do not think that this is essential to the argument.\nEven supposing that there are millions of dreams remembered,\nthe number of subjects which may be dreamed about is practically\ninfinite. Thus the chances that any particular subject will enter\ninto the dream on any particular night is very small. It is of course\ntrue that the subjects of any person's dreams are as a rule limited to\na comparatively small section of the total of the possible subjects,\nbeing usually concerned with those things which enter his daily\nexperience. For example, a fairly high proportion of my own\ndreams are connected with sailing and boats. But if I dream that\nI am sailing in my boat and actually do so during the next few days,\nI should not consider the dream premonitory. Should the dream\ncontain details, say that the jib halliards carried away, and should\nthis happen within a short time, it still would be hardly worthy of\nnotice, for, although jib halliards do not often carry away, at least\nif you look after your gear as you should, I have known them to\ndo so.\nShould the dream contain a combination of independent details,\nnone of which, perhaps, is very strikingly unusual or unlikely to\nhappen, and should the fulfilling event consist of the same arrange-\nment of details, then the chance hypothesis loses its plausibility, for\neven if, as remarked above, the number of subjects about which\n\f70 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nanyone is likely to drcain may be a comparatively small fraction of\nthe practically infinite theoretical total, yet the number of possible\ncombinations of these subjects is immensely great.\nIf then the chance that anyone will dream a particular dream on\nany particular night is very small, so also is the chance that any\nparticular event will happen to that person during the next few\ndays.\nIn saying this I refer, of course, to a complex event. For, as in the\nexample quoted above, while it is quite likely that I should go sailing\nonce or twice in a week, it is not so likely that while sailing my jib\nhalliards should carry away and still more imlikely that that event\nshould be combined with several other similar happenings. It is\nonly when the apparent precognition refers to such a combination\nof details that anything supernormal is suggested.\nThe probability that the precognition is due to chance depends\non both the separate probability of the dream being dreamed and\nthat of the event occurring within a reasonably short interval.\nWhere these separate probabilities are represented, as I have\nendeavoured to show, by very small fractions, the probability of\nchance fulfilment becomes infinitesimally small. The time element\nis, of course, important, and I have, therefore, rejected any cases\nwhere the lapse of time between the dream, impression, etc., and\nthe fulfilment appears excessive.\nWhat I have said of dreams applies equally to impressions, but\nwhen we come to consider hallucinations the argument is very much\nstronger owing to the rarity of these phenomena.\nIn this discussion we have been considering the probability of\nprecognition of events of a usual and commonplace character, but\nin many cases the event foreseen is not usual.\nConsider again the case quoted of Mrs Atlay and the pig in the\ndining room. How often does one dream of seeing so imusual a\nsight ? It must be a very rare occurrence. On the other hand, how\noften does one find pigs\u2014I refer, of course, to the non-human\nvariety\u2014in dining rooms ? This again is not a usual happening.\nAnd when we combine the additional details of time, i.e. after\nreading prayers, and place, i.e. between the table and the sideboard,\nwe get a combination of circumstances such that chance seems to be\nexcluded for all practical purposes.\nNow if this incident stood alone, we might perhaps say that it\nwas an extremely curious coincidence and leave it at that. But it\ndoes not stand alone, we have a large number of cases to match it.\nDreams of being followed by a monkey are surely very rare, at any\nrate for persons living in this country, and the event of being so\nfollowed must be almost unique in London where loose monkeys are,\nto say the least, unfiimiliar objects.\n\f134] Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition 71\nI could go on citing cases but I think it is unnecessaiy. The\nhypothesis of chance cannot possibly be held to cover all the cases\nreported.\nI have classed as non-precognitive a certain number of cases where\nit had appeared plausible, but there still remains so large a residuum\nwhere it is wildly improbable, that I have no hesitation in rejecting\nit as a possible explanation.\nThere is another hypothesis which is sometimes put forward, viz.\nthat the precognitions are due to illusions of memory. In certain\ncases, where no records have been made and where no one has been\ntold of the dream etc. before fulfilment, this explanation might be\npossible ; but when records have been made or an account given\nbefore fulfiJment, it seems inapplicable. We should have to suppose\nthat there was illusion of memory not only as regards the pre-\ncognition and its fulfilment but also as regards the times of making\nthe records or giving the accounts. Not only must the percipient\nhave experienced illusion of memory but also all those who give\nconfiimatory evidence. In many of what I have called warning\ncases, of which there are some 34 all told, some action has been\ntaken as a consequence of the premonition. It seems hardly likely\nthat in so many cases the illusion of memory should apply to these\nactions as well as to the precognition itself.\nIllusion of memory may possibly account for a few of the poorer\ncases, but it would be to discredit too profoundly the value of human\ntestimony to suppose that it occurred in all the large number of well\nevidenced cases which we possess.\nI do not think it necessary to spend time in discussing fraud, bad\nreporting, inaccurate observation and all the rest of the stock in\ntrade of the sceptic of a certain type. Fraud is obviously out of the\nquestion in so large a mass of spontaneous phenomena. As regards\nthe rest, the cases were all drawn from the Proceedings or Journal\nof the Society and this in itself is some guarantee that these points\nhave not been overlooked. For a case to have been printed it must\nhave reached the evidential standard laid down by the Society ;\nthere may have been a few lapses from this standard, but on the\nwhole it may be taken to have been observed.\nReading the reports of the cases themselves together with the\nconfirmatory evidence published amply supports this view.\nAfter prolonged study I have no hesitation in afiirming that pre-\ncognitions do occur. In doing so I have the support of many\nauthorities in psychical research. Should the reader feel any doubt\nremaining, I would refer him to Prof. Chas. Richet's excellent little\nbook, UAvenir et la Premonition.\nWe have now come to the end of the hypotheses which have from\ntime to time been put forward to account for these facts, and we\n\f72 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nfind ourselves left with a. very considerable mass which none of them |\nwill cover. Can we find a tentative hypothesis or must we leave it, -\nas Prof. Richet does, unexplained ? !\nIt is, perhaps, a temerarious enterprise to venture in where he\nhas abstained, yet in spite of this I propose to make the attempt.\nIf I fail and my suggestion be held to be untenable, at least one more\nalternative will have been cleared out of the way and the path ren-\ndered less obstructed for future explorers.\nNow what is the central basic fact common to all cases of pre-\ncognition ?\nWhen I observe an event which happens in my presence my mind\nsomehow or other comes into conscious contact with that event.\nHow it does so is a matter concerning which much controversy has\narisen, and there are a number of different theories of perception.\nIt would be out of place to attempt to discuss these here, even were\nI competent to do so. All we need say is that a cognitive relation\nis set up between the event and my mind.\nThe difference between normal cases and those of precognition is\nthat in the latter the event does not happen in my presence, that\nis to say it is not an event in my present but in the futirre. Somehow\nor other a cognit've relation is set up between my mind and an event\nwhich, as we say, has not yet happened.\nIt is unfortunate that this enquiry leads us into some of the very\nworst morasses of metaphysical speculation. I would willingly have\navoided adventuring into this perilous region could I have done so,\nbut if the attempt to explain precognition is to be made, some ex-\ncursion therein is inevitable. I will make it as short as possible.\nNow it is held by some authorities that the future is non-existent.\nWhat exactly is meant by the word \" exist \" I will not consider,\nbut in view of the evidence before us I suggest, although I feel\nconsiderable trepidation in doing so, that these authorities are mis-\ntaken, for how can I set up a cognitive relation with the non-\nexistent ? It is equivalent to postulating a relation which contains\nonly one term. Yet unless we dismiss the entire mass of evidence\nwhich remains uncovered by the alternative hypotheses discussed\nabove, this relation actually occurs. I argue, therefore, that the\nfuture exists now in some way, and may be accessible to my con-\nsciousness under certain circumstances.\nIt has been held by some writers. Prof. Richet for example, that\nthe logical consequence of this position is that the entire future is\ncompletely determined. Such a consequence of complete deter-\nmination would entail the surrender of freedom of choice with all its\nmetaphysical and ethical implications. For, they argue, if we can\nforesee a future event, that event must exist in its entirety and can-\nnot be altered by any action of ours in the present.\n\f134] Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition 73\nBut even if we accept this argument (which, for reasons which I\nwill try to explain later, I do not) the phenomena of precognition\nsuch as we have before us do not warrant us logically to infer com-\nplete universal determination.\nAll that we know is that a few future events have been subject to\nprecognition. We are not entitled to argue thereform that all events\nwhatsoever could have been foreseen.\nNo one denies that some amomit of determination of the future\nobtains ; if I release the trigger of a properly constructed and loaded\nMills bomb, that action in those c'rcumstances will determine an\nexplosion at that place after a few seconds.\nIt may be that one of the indispensable conditions of the occur-\nrence of a precognition is the complete determination of the event\nforeseen, that is to say, only those port-'ons of the future which are\nalready fixed can be foreseen.\nIn order to prove universal determination we should have to show\nthat every event whatsoever could be the subject of precognition,\nand this, of course, we cannot do. It is true that those events which\nwe have actually formd to be the subject of precognition appear to\ndiffer in no observable single respect from any other events, that is\nto say they seem to be a fair sample (with the possible exception\nthat death has rather more than its share, which, however, is pro-\nbably susceptible of a perfectly simple reasonable explanation).\nBut although we can detect no difference in general character\nbetween the events which have been foreseen and those which have\nnot been, so that we must admit that we can see no reason why, if\nthe former have been the subject of supernormal precognition, the\nlatter might not be so also, many essential characteristics are hidden\nfrom us and notably the characteristic of being completely deter-\nmined or not. We can in some cases feel pretty sure that an event\nhas been completely determined, though these are for the most part\nrelatively simple and, as it were, self-centred events, but where all\nthe multifarious conditions and influences of the environment\nimpinge on it we can never be sure that we have allowed for all\nrelevant factors. On the other hand, we can never say with cer-\ntainty that an event was not completely determined.\nCould these questions be settled definitely it would put an end to\nthe age-old controversy between the upholders of free-will and the\ndeterminists. If observation carried on over a thousand years has\nbeen unable to settle the matter we may be fairly confident that it\nis because the fact is not observable.\nUntil, then, we can show that all events whatsoever are theoreti-\ncally susceptible of becoming subjects of precognition the argument\nfor universal determination fails.\nThere are two sides to the question of precognition. First, how\n\f74 H. F. SaUnmrsh [PARI'\nwe can come to know a future event, and second, the mode in which\nthe future can be held to exist.\nIn putting forward my suggested hypothesis I do not for a moment\nsuppose that it is a complete explanation or even that it represents\nhow things actually happen. It is merely a suggestion of a possible\nmode of looking at the phenomena based on an analogy with an\nestablished psychological doctrine.\nWe take our stand firmly on the empirically established fact that\napparently supernormal precognitions do occur, and that they imply\nthat conscious contact is sometimes made with future events. There\nmay be an explanation of this phenomenon of which we have and\ncan have no conception under the limitations imposed by the\nfiniteness of our minds and the essential relativity of all our know-\nledge, but if we can find a tentative hypothesis based on other\nempirically established facts, that is all we can hope for ; and it is\na step worth the taking. We are always at liberty to retrace our\nsteps. :\n)\n\/\u2022\u2022\nIt is clear that the crux of the whole thing is Time.\nWe must distinguish between two sorts of time, or rather between\ntwo different conceptions of it, viz. the mathematician's and physi-\ncist's time and psychological time. The former is admittedly an\nabstraction ; it consists of point-instants having no magnitude but\nonly temporal position ; it has no more real existence than the\nmathematical point or line.\nPsychological time is time as experienced.\nStrictly speaking, of course, time is never actually experienced.\nWhat is really the object of experience is change, i.e. events taking\nplace. Time is an abstraction from change.\nWith mathematician's time we have no concern. Its proper place\nis in physical science, and in its proper place it acts as a well behaved\nabstraction should act. Its conduct is not, perhaps, quite so fault-\nless as is that of some other mathematical abstractions, but that is\nno concern of ours. Unfortunately the mathematician's concept of\ntime has to some extent influenced our ordinary ideas, and these\nshould, of course, be formed solely on our experience, i.e. psycho-\nlogical time.\nMost people have very hazy notions on the subject ; in fact, its\ninherent difiiculty and familiarity renders the ideas of even the\nclearest thinkers rather nebulous. For the average person who has\nnot thought about or studied time, I imagine that the definition\nimplied in the hymn, \" Time, like an ever-rolling stream, bears all\nits sons away,\" is more or less unconsciously adopted. As a defi-\nnition it is obviously useless ; as a description it is inaccurate.\nTime does not roll\u2014abstractions don't. Events, if you like to put it\nthat way, may roll.\n\f134] Report on Gases of Ajjpareut Precognition 75\nCoucomitantly with this idea of time as a flowing stream, another\nand conflicting one is ordinarily held. Time is thought of as a sort\nof pseudo space, stretching out before and behind, wherein events\nare located ; we pass along a path in this pseudo space, the point\nat which we are being the present moment.\nIt is over this idea of time that the mathematician's concept is\napt to exercise a misleading influence.\nLet us endeavour to thrust aside these notions, and rest solely on\nactual experience ; that is to say, experience of change or of an\nevent taking place.\nWe must distinguish between two different types of experience\nof change ;\nfirst, that of an event actually taking place before our\neyes as it were, and second, that of an event having taken place.\nIn the first the experience is direct and immediate, as when we\nactually see an object move or change in some way ; in the second\nwe infer change by comparing our immediate perception with our\nmemory of another perception of the same object.\nFor example, look at a watch ;\nyou see the second hand actually\nmove, the hour hand appears to be stationary ; but if you look again\nin half an hour's time, you infer that the hour hand was moving\nbecause you see that it has changed its place.\nWe look at the watch in what we call our present.\nNow if we perceive an event actually occurring, that present must\nhave some duration. Were it a mathematical point-instant having\nno dimension, change could not occur within it. There is no room\ninside a point.\nPerception, whatever else it may be, involves a state of con-\nsciousness, and a state of consciousness must possess some duration.\nIf it vanished the moment it occurred, we could not be conscious.\nMoreover, it cannot be denied that our consciousness extends over\na certain length of duration, and if this be so it cannot be made up\nof point-instants having no length. If our present moment has no\nlength of duration, it must be separated from the present moment\nwhich just preceded it by a gap having length of duration, as other-\nwise the two moments would coincide ; thus all duration would be\ncompressed into a single moment or point-instant.\nThe idea that our experienced duration is due to the persistence\nof memory of past point-instants is clearly untenable. We should\nhave to picture the stream of consciousness as consisting of a series\nof flashes ;\nflashes, moreover, which are so rapid that they occupy\nno duration ; between the flashes are blank periods. If the experi-\nence of change actually occurring be psychologically the same as\nthat of change having occurred, which is what the memory theory\nimplies, each instantaneous flash must not only include an act of\nperception, but also an act of memory and an inference from the\n\f76 H. F. SaUmmsh [part\ntwo. This seems rather a. lot to pack into a point-iustant, wherein\nadmittedly there is no room to pack anything.\nIt is true that we cannot understand perhaps how duration can\ncome to us, as it were, in lumps, but neither can we understand how\nit can come in point-instants having no duration. When the choice\nbetween two inexplicables is presented, I think that we are bound to\naccept that one which is in accord with experience rather than that\nwhich rests on abstractions.\nI need labour the point no further ; that our present moment has\na definite duration is pretty generally accepted by psychologists.\nIt is known as the doctrine of the specious present. There is a\nquestion which immediately presents itself, viz., does this specious\npresent include past alone, future alone, or both past and future ?\nSome authorities have held the first view, others the third, but I do\nnot know of any who have held the second. Were I called upon to\nchoose, I should adopt the view that both past and future are\nincluded within the specious present, but I consider that the question\nis really meaningless, being based on the illegitimate hypostatisation\nof an abstraction.\nIf I talk of an event as being in the past or in the future, I require\nsome \" present \" in reference to which that event is past or future.\nNow the only present of which I have any experience embraces a\nslab of duration. All the parts of it are present. I can, in imagina-\ntion, cut it up into slices, and one slice may precede another, but it\nis quite an arbitrary matter which slice I take as the actual, or as I\nprefer to call it, the fictitious present. If I wish to call one particular\nslice past and another future, I must place my fictitious present\nsomewhere between them. But what grounds can I have for select-\ning the slice which is to be my present moment ? The whole idea of\na fictitious present is due, in my opinion, to the influence of that\nabstraction, mathematician's time.\nMoreover, unless the slice of duration which I select as my ficti-\ntious present has no magnitude, i.e., is a point-instant, the question\nof past and future within its limits applies just as much to it as to\nthe whole of the specious present. Yet point-instants never enter\ninto my experience ;\nthey are abstractions and exist only qua\nabstraction.\nIt may be objected that an event occupying a certain duration\ncan be cut up into any number of slices and that each particular\nslice will occupy its own particular slice of duration and no other.\nFurther, that there is no limit to the number of slices into which we\ncan cut it up.\nIt is true that we can do so in imagination, yet even so we never\narrive at a slice having no duration.\nIt is a form of the old paradox of the flying arrow. The paradox\n\f134] Report 0)1 Cases of Apparent Precognition 11\narises only when we deal with abstractions, viz., a mathematical\npoint on the arrow, a mathematical point in space and a mathe-\nmatical point-instant in time. If we abstain from abstraction even\nin only one respect, say we consider the arrow as a whole, the paradox\nvanishes.\nIn making these abstractions does not imagination outrun possi-\nbility ? The facts on which the quantum theory of physics is based\nshow that so far as certain natural phenomena are concerned, there\nis a limit beyond which this cutting-up process cannot go.\nMight I suggest, with the utmost deference as becomes the humble\nlayman, that something like the quantum principle applies to space-\ntime ?\nHowever this may be, it is a question for the physicist. As\nregards psychological time, experience presents it to us as a contin-\nuum, but as a continuum which will only cut up into lumps of a\nminimum size. How and why this is so I do not profess to under-\nstand ; it is one of those matters which, like the quantum principle\nand many other things in modern physics, has to be accepted, as\nProf. Alexander says, \" with natural piety\".\nThere is, of course, a mode in which I may reasonably speak of\nevents as being past or future ;\nmy specious present covers a com-\nparatively short length of duration, and events which are located\noutside of it are either past or future from its point of view. Also\nsuppose that I have a specious present extending from t to t' , and\nanother person has one from T to i to t' to T' , then from my point\nof view events in the period T to t in the other man's present would\nbe past and those in t' to T' would be future.\nThere is a further point to be considered. All the events occupy-\ning the specious present are not presented with equal clearness.^\nThis may be represented in a diagram. Let the horizontal line repre-\nsent duration and the vertical coordinate the degree of clearness of\nFig. 1.\npresentation. Then we should get a curve which would represent\nthe consciousness during the specious present. It might take the\nform A (Fig. 1), in which case an event located near to t' would be\npresented with a smaller degree of clearness than one situated mid-\n1 1 use the term \" clearness \" in a very special sense. It is by no means\nideal for the purpose, but I cannot think of another. It is obvious that a\nsensuous presentation may be either clear or dim quite irrespective of its\nposition in the specious present, but this has nothing to do with its clearness\nin the special sense in which I have used that word.\n\f78 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nway between t and t' . In all succeeding diagrams t is to be under-\nstood as being towards the past and t' towards the future.\nAs the specious presents succeed one another the clearness of\npresentation in each will grow to a maximum and then gradually\ndecrease to zero ; the succession of specious presents would, in\nreality, be due to the fact that every event which is perceived is\nperceived throughout a finite time with continually varying degrees\nof clearness which eventually diminishes to zero.\nOr the curve might take the form B (Fig. 2), which implies that\nwhen an event first comes within a specious present, it is perceived\nwith maximum clearness which gradually diminishes to zero.\nFig. 2.\nThere are obviously other possible variants, such as\nFig. 4.\nbut for purposes of this enquiry these need not be discussed. The\npoint at issue is whether the degree of clearness at i! is minimal,\nor whether the presentation to consciousness springs into being\nfully grown or at any rate with a substantial magnitude. I do not\nthink that introspective observation will help us in this matter, and\nif we are to choose between the two, it can only be a tentative choice\nbased on general grounds.\nIt might be argued that diagram B represents the act of perception\nas instantaneous, i.e., as occupying no duration and thus occurring\nwith infinite speed. As a general rule, infinite speeds are looked upon\nwith suspicion. We are much more ready to accept gradual growth.\nTaken as a whole, the plan of nature seems to have been drawn\nwith a soft pencil, or perhaps even with a brush. Mathematical\nlines and points are introduced only by the mind using its faculty\nof abstraction. We are more accustomed to soft curves and flowing\nlines than to sharp angles and hard edges.\nIt must be admitted, however, that these considerations are not\ndecisive, but we can say that diagram A is, at least, as plausible as\ndiagram B.\nThis being so, I propose to assume that the curve is somewhat in\nthe form shown in diagram A, in so far, at any rate, that the angles\n\f134] Rejwrt on Cases of Apparent Precognition 79\nat t and t' are always less than right angles. There may be sharp\nfluctuations at any point of the curve, but with these I am not at\npresent concerned. All that is necessary for my hypothesis is that\nas one approaches t' there is a gradual diminution of the coordinates,\nand not a sharp drop to zero.\nI admit that this is an assumption, but I claim that it is legitimate.\nThough the theory of precognition which I am about to suggest\nrequires that it be made, it could be stated on the basis of diagram\nB, but it would require the help of some rather cumbrous and un-\ngainly expedients.\nThe diagrams above represent a single specious present. The\nactual fact is, of course, that there is a succession of specious pres-\nents, either as a continuous change, i.e., one merging into another\nby infinitesimal degrees, or else a discontinuous series. I do not\nattempt to decide which of these two alternatives is correct. To\ndo so would involve the discussion of some of the most recondite and\ndifficult problems of metaphysics. However, a decision on the point\nis fortunately not required for the present purpose, but as it is\nimpossible to represent continuous change in diagrams, I shall, in\nwhat follows, show the series of specious presents as discontinuous,\nwith the proviso that it is only to be taken as a symbolic representa-\ntion for the sake of convenience, and not as implying any acceptance\nof the view that they are really discontinuous.\nThere is, however, one point on which I must insist, viz., that if it\nbe a discontinuous series, the succeeding terms overlap to some\nextent. This is, I think, in accordance with experience. The repre-\nsentation in diagram of the series of specious presents will therefore\ntake somewhat the following form\nFig. 5.\nI can now state my tentative theory of supernormal precognition.\nI suggest that the specious present of the subliminal ^ mind is of\nI I use the term subliminal mind in all that follows, because it is the one\nmost familiar to students of psychical research and conveys the meaning I\nrequire. I wish, however, to make it quite clear that I do not intend thereby\nto express my opinion as to its nature or status. All that I postulate is that\nit is a region, normally cut off from ordinary consciousness by a threshold,\nwherein events take place, events which, even if they are not identical in\ncharacter with those of the supraliminal mind, are of an analogous nature.\nWhether the subliminal can properly be termed a mind, I do not attempt to\nsay. Possibly it is part of what Dr Broad in his Mind and its Place in Nature\ncalls the psychical factor and to which he denies the term mind.\n\f80 H.

D. Broad, to whose generous help and criticism I owe a great\ndebt, which I hereby acknowledge, has pointed out to me that this\nis an inadequate statement of my theory, and has very kindly\nsupplied the following accurate account.\n\" There is a one-to-one correlation between the series of supra-\nliminal specious presents in a given mind and a series of subliminal\nspecious presents in the same mind. Any term of the latter series\noverlaps in time the corresponding term of the former, extending\nfurther backwards into the past and further forwards into the future\nthan the corresponding supraliminal specious present.\"\n(I wish to make it absolutely clear that the assistance which Dr\nBroad has so kindly given me does not imply that he endorses my\nsuggestion or is at all prepared to accept my tentative theory.) This\ntheory may be represented in diagram as follows :\nThe line A-B represents the threshold between the supraliminal\nand the subliminal, the supraliminal specious present from t to t'\nhas a corresponding subliminal specious present which extends from\nT to T'. Similarly, the succeeding specious present t, t' ,\ncorresponds\nwith the subliminal T, T'\n.\nIf th<? flowing curve of diagram A (Fig. 1) be not allowed, and\nthat of Fig. 2 insisted upon, I think the theory can still be rep-\nresented in diagram. It would be somewhat as follows :\nThe ungainly features of which I spoke are the sharp angles where\nthe vertical line from I' changes to the curve of the subliminal.\nHowever, as there is already one sharp angle necessitated by the\n\f134] Report on Gases of A'pparent Precognition 81\ntheory, I cannot see that anyone can reasonably object to another\nbeing inserted.\nThe contents of the supraliminal and subliminal minds, in so\nfar as they are presented events, may be shown as follows :\nA\n^3 ^4 ^3 ^6 ^7\nFig. 8.\nXqX\n8^9\nHere a?j, x.^, Xq, Xg,\nt\/g, Xq are presented to the supraliminal.\nare presented to the subliminal only,\nWe may say, therefore,\nthat for the supraliminal mind x^, x^, Xq are present events, x^ and\npast, Xg, Xg and x-^q future. For the subliminal all the events\nfrom to x^^ are present. I have in this diagram shown only one\nspecious present, as it would have made it too confusing to have\nshown all the overlapping curves, but it is easy to see how it would\nlook if they were filled in.\nThere is one point which must be mentioned, viz., that it is poss-\nible that an event, say x^, which was presented only to the subliminal\nin one specious present, might reach the supraliminal in a succeeding\none.\nLet us now see how we can represent a supernormal precognition,\nand for this purpose we will assume a fictitious case. At twelve\nnoon, that is to say within the specious present of my supraliminal\nmind in which the striking of noon by my clock is presented to me,\nI have a supernormal precognition of an event which happens at\n6 p.m. on the same day. The first diagram is as follows :\n6 p.m.\nA B\n\\ s\nFig. 9.\nHere the first curve shows the specious present in which the striking\nof noon is presented. This is represented by the line from 'N. The\nsecond curve is the specious present in which the striking of 6 p.m.\nis presented, or woiild be presented if the spatial conditions are\nfavourable. In the first curve the event x is present to the sub-\nliminal only, for obviously while that curve is in being the second\n\f82 H. F. Sallmarsh [part\nhas not yet occurred. But in the second specious present, viz., that\nat 6 p.m., X is presented to the supraliminal. That is to say, it is\nexperienced in the normal way.\nNow my hypothesis suggests that the subliminal presentation of\nX in the first curve is somehow or other transmitted to the part of\nthe curve above the line A, B.\nThis might be represented as follows. I show only the first curve,\nas this diagram represents the state of affairs at noon.\nnoon\nN X\nFig. 10.\nThe dotted line represents the supernormal transmission of the sub-\nliminal presentation of x through the threshold to the supra-\nliminal. When 6 p.m. arrives x is normally presented in the spec-\nious present at that moment, and this brings about the verification\nof the precognition.\nAll, therefore, that is required for my hypothesis to account for a\nsupernormal precognition is that the specious present of the sub-\nliminal should extend sufficiently to cover the actual event, and that\nthere should be a means of transmission to the supraliminal. That\nwhich is a precognition for the supraliminal is only a cognition for the\nsubliminal.\nStated thus, these may not seem to be very extravagant demands\nfor an hypothesis designed to account for so bizarre and puzzling\na phenomenon as supernormal precognition. We know that the\nspecious presents of the individual vary in length under the influence\nof fatigue, drugs, and probably concentration of attention. More-\nover, it is likely that different individuals normally have specious\npresents of different lengths. It seems, therefore, not a very great\nleap to suppose that the supraliminal mind should differ from the\nsubliminal in a similar way, but to a greater extent.\nAs regards the second requirement, viz., means of transmission\nthrough the threshold, we are in a similar position. That is to say,\nall we need to postulate is an extension of a process which we already\nknow to exist. It is generally admitted that passage through the\nthreshold does to some extent occur normally, as for example, in\ndreams, the mechanism employed frequently includes the use of\nsymbolism ; moreover there is ample evidence of supernormal\n\f13-t] Report ow Cases of AjJj^arenl PrecoyiiUion 83\ntransmission ;\ne.g., in the cases of hyperaesthesia. This is usually\naccompanied by, or occurs during, states of dissociation. It may\nnot be correct to say that the subliminal perception itself is trans-\nmitted, though in some cases this appears to be so. It would,\nperhaps be better to restrict ourselves to the statement that the\nknowledge acquired by the subliminal perception is conveyed to the\nsupraliminal.\nIn these non-precognitive cases of transmission through the\nthreshold the events concerned lie in that portion of the subliminal\nspecious present which coincides with that of the supraliminal. A\ndiagram will make this clear.\nThe events, subliminal perception of which may be transmitted to\nthe supraliminal, lie between t and T'.\nAll that is required, therefore, for my hypothesis is that we should\ndeny to these events any special privilege in the matter of passage\nthrough the threshold. All the events lying between a and \/3 are\npresent to the subliminal. Is there any obvious reason why a certain\nsection of them should possess any special privilege simply from the\nfact of their position relative to the supraliminal specious present ?\nIf we admit that the mathematical present moment is an ab-\nstraction which has no real existence, an admission which, it must\nbe confessed, may be easy enough to make verbally, but is very\ndifficult to embrace whole-heartedly with all its implications, I\ncannot see that there is any ontologcal difference between the\nvarious events which are present to the mind, whether supra- or\nsubliminally, such as would confer this special privilege. I can offer\nno hypothesis as to how the subliminal mind establishes the cogni-\ntive relation, or, as I have put it, comes into conscious contact with\nthe events within its specious present. It may be by an act of per-\nception similar in character to ordinary perception, or it may be\nthat the normal senses are specialised cases of a general faculty of\nknowing or presenting objects to consciousness. Each sense in\noperation would then be this general faculty working through and\ncanalised by a physical mechanism whereby it takes on its own\nspecific characteristics and becomes subject to its own peculiar\nlimitations. On that level of the subliminal mind which lies furthest\nA\na\n\u2014 B\nFig. 11.\n\f84 H. F. Sallmartik [fart\naway from the threshold the general faculty of knowing may operate\ndirectly, and not through any physical mechanism. It would be\npure psychical knowing, but what it would be like I cannot conceive.\nPossible telepathy and clairvoyance may be examples of it.\nIn order that knowledge thus acquired may be transmitted to the\nsupraliminal, it would have to be translated into terms which that\npart of the mind can understand ; that is to say, visual, auditory,\netc.\nNo weight, however, can be rested on this suggestion. Neverthe-\nless, I think we may safely say that, whatever the real facts may be,\nthe subliminal mind operates in some fashion other than through\nthe normal senses.\nWhen we turn to the mode of passage from the subliminal to the\nsupraliminal we find an equally unsatisfactory state of ignorance.\nWe do not know how the transfer is made eA^en in normal cases ;\nwe only know that it occurs and that it tends to occur more freely\nin cases of dissociation.\nThere is one minor point which may be mentioned here. I noted\nearlier that there was a rather surprisingly low percentage of exam-\nples of symbolism in supernormal precognitions. We know from\nthe work of the psycho-analysts that in cases of normal passage\nthrough the threshold symbolism is freely employed, and I suggest\nthat the relatively low percentage of symbolism found in super-\nnormal precognitions is due to the fact that the normal mechanism\nof passage through the threshold is not as a rule employed.\nThere is one fmal point to be considered, viz., what is the extent\nof this subliminal conscious contact with the future ?\nIn Fig. 9 I showed the curve of consciousness meeting the line of\nduration at a point a little way ahead of the specious present. This\nwould represent the degree of clearness of presentation as reduced\nto zero ;\nthat is to say, conscious contact as ceasing altogether.\nThere are, however, three other alternatives. First, the curve\nmight end abruptly before meeting the line of duration thus\nFig. 12.\nThis I regard as highly imlikely. It does not seem reasonable to\nsuppose that the causes, whatever they may be, which bring about a\ngradual approach of the two lines over the rest of their length should\nundergo so sudden and profound a change.\n\f134] Report on Cases of Ajyparenf Prccognifion 85\nThe second is that the line of consciousness approaches the line of\nduration asymptotically ; that is to say, approaches ever nearer to\nit without ever actually meeting it.\nThe third alternative, which is the one which I am inclined to\nprefer, is that the line of consciousness is parallel to that of duration,\nand the curve is in the line representing the threshold. It would be\nthus :\nThe coordinate of clearness as regards the subliminal mind would\nbe constant throughout. The gradation of clearness of presentation\nwhich is actually observed in the specious present of the supra-\nliminal would then be shown by the vertical distance between the\nhues of consciousness and the threshold in the loop t to t'.\nIn all probability the actual facts are far more complex than\nanything which can be represented in a diagram. For example, the\nthreshold is almost certainly not a sharp division between two homo-\ngeneous sections of the mind. There may be, I should say probably\nthere are, several thresholds, or else there is one threshold which\nwould be represented as a wide belt of gradually increasing density.\nWe have a little evidence to guide us in this matter of the length\nof the subliminal specious present. Precognitions of events weeks\nor even months ahead are fairly common. We have several quite\ngood cases which stretch over years. Now if the conscious contact\nwhich the subUminal mind makes with the future can extend for a\nperiod of years, there seems to be no particular reason why it should\nnot extend indefinitely. If the length of the contact is limited at all,\nI feel that it must be comparable in length with that of the supra-\nliminal mind, i.e., the normal specious present.\nK the curve of consciousness approaches the line of duration\nasymptotically, then the degree of clearness of presentation would\ndiminish rapidly at first, the rate of diminution getting slower and\nslower as we get further away from the present.\nThere is one fact in the evidence which may be cited in support\nof this view, viz., that the precognitions of trivial events are as a\nrule only a short time before the fulfilment. The longer the shots,\nthe fewer the details.^ However, this is susceptible of another\nexplanation.\n^ Case P. xi. 577, summarised on page 61), is an exception to this rule, nor\nis it the only one.\nFig. 13.\n\f86 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nIt must be admitted that tho implications of this hypothesis are\nvery serious and may land us in considerable difficulties as regards\nour conception of time. However, there seems to be a conflict\nbetween the facts on which the doctrine of the specious present is\nbased and our ordinary conception of time. It may be that the\ndoctrine of the specious present may be rejected, but if so, some other\nmeans of accounting for the facts must be found.\nI suggest, then, that we must revise our ordinary ideas of the\nnature of time, however difficult may be the task and however\nunsatisfying the result. That this is no novel demand the history\nof metaphysical thought since Kant clearly shows, and those who\nare familiar with MacTaggart's great work. The Nature of Existence,\nwill already be prepared, if not to accept it, at least to regard it as\nwithin the sphere of reasonable discussion.\nBriefly, my own personal ideas on the subject, for what they are\nworth, are as follows : I accept MacTaggart's view of the unreality\nof time and change in so far as sequences of completely determined\nevents are concerned, but I hold, in disagreement with him, that\nthere are non-determined events, such as events arising from free-\nwill, which exhibit true change and therefore are subject to true\ntime. But in all sequences of events, whether subject to true time\nor not, there is temporal order or location ; that is to say, if A\ncauses B, and B caiises C, B will always lie bewteen A and C. In\nother words, A is and always was and will be earlier than B, and\nC is, was and will be later. This conception of temporal location\nmust be accepted as a fundamental feature of experience and held\nalong with, but quite distinct from, the conception of true time.\nThat it is a difficult conception to grasp and hold, I freely admit, but\nit seems to me to be necessitated by the facts, and mere difficulty of\nconception is, or should be, no bar.\nThis is not the place to enter upon any discussion of the grounds\nof this opinion. I may say, however, that I reached it from general\nmetaphysical arguments and not from the consideration of the\nphenomena of the specious present and supernormal precognition.\nThat these phenomena seem to require it, or something like it, for\ntheir explanation, appears to me to lend considerable support to the\nhypothesis.\nIt might seem at first sight that my theory implies that a future\nevent, meaning thereby an event which does not yet exist, can\nexercise a causative influence on the present. This is obviously im-\npossible, for non-existence cannot exercise a causative influence. But\nmy suggestion is that the event which is the object of a precogni-\ntion is not future in this sense ; it already exists in the present of the\nsubliminal. It is future only in the sense that it is temporally located\nlater than events which are in the present of the supraliminal.\n\f134] Re]3ori on Cases of Apimrent Precognition 87\nWe must now turn to the other side of th(^ matter.\nI have suggested that the fact that precognitions occm' shows\nthat the subliminal mind is in conscious contact with a section of\nduration lying ahead of the normal specious present ; that is to\nsay, what we ordinarily call the future.\nIf this be so, the future exists now in some sense. Can we form\nany idea of the manner in which it exists ?\nI have already argued, unless we can show that all future events\nwhatsoever are theoretically capable of being subjects of precogni-\ntion, we cannot claim that the few scattered cases of which we have\nevidence prove the theory of universal determination.\nBut inability to prove a fact does not justify us in denying it. If\nall events are completely determined, that is to say, if freewill is\nan illusion, then, in my opinion, MacTaggart is right in denying\nreality to time. All events are coexistent in reality. We call one\npast and another future simply because of their temporal location\nwith regard to another event which we call present, and our reason for\nselecting that particular event is that it is included within our spec-\nious present. That is to say, it is presented to my consciousness with\nsufficient clearness to pass the threshold dividing the subliminal from\nthe supraliminal.^ Now obviously, clearness of presentation is a com-\npletely non-temporal feature, so that it is really a very poor sort of\nreason, when one comes to think of it, for fixing the present moment.\nI do not for a moment suppose that this theory of the unreality of\ntime in determined sequences will be acceptable to everyone, but\nthe matter can be considered apart from any theories. We say that\nan event happens and that it happens in the present. Well then,\nwhat is it that happens when a completely determined event\nhappens ? Being completely determined by events and conditions\nwhich already exist, and thus being incapable of being changed in\nany way, its actual happening seems to be reduced to the level of a\nmere formality. The happening adds nothing to it. It is true that\nit may be presented in my supraliminal specious present while it is\nhappening, provided that conditions for observation are favourable.\nBut if this be the only difference between present, past and future,\nwhen no observer is available, happening is reduced to a mere formal\npossibility of being observed. I admit that these considerations are\nnot conclusive, because the formal possibility may depend in part\nupon a real time relation. The nature of time can be investigated\nonly by metaphysical examination.\n^ I do not wish it to be assumed that I consider clearness of presentation to\nbe the only condition necessary for the passage through the threshold. There\nmay be, and if Freud is right there are, others. Passage may be denied by the\nendo-psychic censor on account of the inacceptability of the idea. But 1\nthink that as regards the presentation of events, clearness is probably the main\nfactor.\n\fI\n1\n88 H. F. Salfmarsh [pabt\n1 ha ve nirntioned the above merely to show that the thing is not\nj\nso obvious and transparent as it may seem at first sight. So far we \\\nhave been discussing completely determined sequences, but there\nare grounds, for example those based on ethical considerations, which ,\nrender universal determinism unacceptable to many of us. Every- !\nbody assumes for practical purposes that some degree of freedom of\nchoice exists. Many people, including philosophers of the highest\nrank, accept it theoretically as well. Let us assume that we possess\nsome degree of freewill ; that is to say, that we can intervene to some\nextent in the course of events and exercise a directional influence\nover them. I am not going to discuss the grounds for this assump-\ntion ;\nthey have been discussed ad nauseam for the past thousand\nyears, so it is unlikely that I shoidd be able to add anything of\ninterest.\nIf we are able to intervene and guide the course of events, it\nfollows that they must be to some extent what I may call plastic ;\nthat is to say, they are not frozen to rigidity.\nNow the temporal locus of the operation of freewill appears, on\nthe face of it, to be the present, that is the specious present, not the\nfictitious present.\nIt may be objected that the doctrine of the specious present is\nall very well for psychology and for knowing about things, but that\nwhen it comes to the actual doing of things, to the happening of the\nevents themselves, it really \" won't wash\".\nCan things happen in a time that is actually as the psycho-\nlogist's time appears to be ?\nI freely admit that I cannot conceive how this may be so, but\nthen I can no more easily conceive how the alternative, i.e., mathe-\nmatician's time, can be real. But I have actual experience of\npsychologist's time, while the other is admittedly an abstraction.\nThus I prefer to accept the view based on experience, even if I\ncannot understand it. Moreover, arguments similar to those used\nin the case of the specious present may be adduced in this matter as\nwell.\nAn act of freewill must have some duration, otherwise it would\ncease to exist at the very moment that it started. That is to say,\nit would not exist at all. Also, it must impinge on events, if I may\nput it that way, over a definite length of duration for the same\nreason. The cutting edge of a tool, however sharp, must have some\nthickness ; it cannot be a mathematical line.\nI thiiik that I need labour the point no further, but will take it as\nestablished that when I exercise freewill it extends over a length of\nduration included within my specious present.\nNow the only observable difference other than temporal location\nbetween the various slices of the specious present is the degree of\n\f134] Be2wrt on Cases of Apparent Precognition 89\nclearness with which they tire presented to my consciousness.\nOntologically, they appear to be otherwise simihxr.\nIt may be that there are also degrees of what I have called\nplasticity. In fact, I suggest that this is so. Still, however this may\nbe, some part of the period is plastic and susceptible of being\nmoulded to some extent by the operation of my freewill. If this is\ntrue for the supraliminal specious present, it may be, and my theory\nis that it is, true for the longer specious present of the subliminal.\nThe view which I would like to suggest may be pictured somewhat\nas follows :\nImagine a bundle of wires or threads all running roughly parallel\nto each other. You are looking at the bundle through a narrow slit\nacross its length so that you can see only a short section at any one\ntime. The slit moves along in the general direction in which the\nwires run.\nNot only can you see through the slit, but you can also touch the\nwires through it. Some of the wires are flexible and elastic, others\nrigid and immovable. You are able, therefore, to exercise a limited\ncontrol over their arrangement and relative positions.\nThe wires that are capable of being moved have this peculiar\nproperty, that after the slit has passed over them they become rigid,\nso that the whole bundle astern of the slit is fixed and immovable.\n^\nThe edges of the slit are not sharply cut, but have fringes, so that\nyour vision is clearest about the centre and diminishes in clearness\nat the edges.\nThe bundle of wires represents a strand of history, the slit the\nspecious present of the observer. The screen in w^hich the slit occurs\nis the threshold between the supraliminal and the subliminal. Those\nwires which are rigid throughout their whole length are those events\nover which we are not able to exercise an influence by the inter-\nposition of our freewill ;\nthey are completely determined. The\nflexible wires are those which we can affect by freewdll ;\nthey are\nnot completely flexible and elastic and can only be moved to a\ncertain extent, thus symbolising the limitations of our power over\nthem.\nTo make the picture complete, a further complication must be\nintroduced. The eye which looks through the slit is, of course, the\neye of the supraliminal, but somehow or other the subliminal mind\nis on the other side of the screen all the time and is in conscious\ncontact with the wires. If my earlier suggestion be accepted, this\nconscious contact is effected, not by means of the ordinary senses,\nbut by an undifferentiated faculty of knowing.\n^ This is not strictly correct, as some slight amount of movement is possible\nastern of the slit. See Dr Broad's Mind and its Place in Nature, p. 2.56. How-\never, this point does not concern us for our present purpose.\n\f90 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nBut leaving (his asifle I'or the moment, let us try to imagine what\nhappens when the position of one of the wires is altered by the\nexercise of a freewill act operating through the slit.\nThe arrangement of that part of the wires which is seen through\nthe slit is disturbed ; astern of the slit they are all frozen into\nrigidity, so no effect is produced ; but ahead the whole length of the\nwire touched is moved, so that the disturbance stretches indefinitely\nin that direction.\nThus an action in the present immediately modifies the entire\nfuture. If we suppose that there are forces of attraction and repul-\nsion between the wires, the slight movement of one of them occa-\nsioned by the freewill act operating on the small section covered by\nthe slit may bring about an upsetting of the equilibrium at any part\nlying ahead, and thus cause profound and far-reaching changes.\nSuppose that I exercise my freewill and move my chair. In its\noriginal position it was in certain spatial and gravitational relations\nwith the rest of the universe. By moving it I have changed these\nrelations. The relations are reciprocal. My chair stands in a certain\nspatial relation with, let us say, a particular electron on Sirius ; the\nelectron has a reciprocal relation with my chair. To describe that\nelectron completely, all its relations must be included ;\nthey are\npart of the conditions which determine its present and future\nexistence. I move my chair, thereby altering some of these relations\nand with them the conditions which determine the present and\nfuture existence of an electron on Sirius. The entire universe is\nchanged by my freewill act ; its future is modified ; it can never\nbe the same again.\nWe may say then that the future is completely determined by\nthe present, but is not inexorably fixed, for the element of plasticity\nallows that which determines the future, i.e., the present, to be\naltered.\nThis plasticity pervades all duration ahead of, and including, the\nspecious present.\nI cannot see that the ontological difficulties raised by regarding\nthe future as determined yet plastic are any greater than those\nwhich arise from the ordinary view which we take of the present\n;\nthat is to say, as existent yet subject to modification by freewill.\nThat there are difficulties I do not deny, but then ontology is always\ndifficult.\nWe must look, then, on the future as existing but as being subject\nto change, so that at the present moment the future, say this time\nnext week, is so and so, call it A. B.C., but in half an hour's time it\nmay be different, say D.E.F., having been changed by some freewill\nact which I have performed in the meantime.\nIf I were now to experience a visual precognition of an event a\n\f134] Report on Cases of Ajrparenf Precognition 91\nweek ahead 1 slioukl get a picture of A.B.Cl., but in hall' an hour\nshould the precognition occur, it would be a pictui'e of D.E.F.\nI have one case which illustrates this rather well. It is the warning\ncase cited from P. xi. 497. The visual precognition included the\ndetail of the coachman falling from a box and crushing in his hat on\nthe pavement. All the events occurred as foreseen up to a certain\npoint when, owing to the interposition of Lady Z in calling to the\npoliceman, the course is altered. So far as one can see, had not Lady\nZ. interposed, things would have happened exactly as in the dream.\nAlthough I quote this case as an illustration, I am by no means\nsure that it is a true example. In the first place it is somewhat\ndoubtful whether Lady Z's action in calling to the policeman was\nreally a freewill action. I am inclined to regard it as impulsive and\ndetermined. Moreover, it might be suggested that the detail of\ncrushing in the hat was an embellishment to the story given by the\nprecognition, an added detail, that is to say, derived from the dream\nfactory itself and not from outside.\nAs we can never determine with any degree of certainty whether\nany action is the outcome of freewill, any cases cited will be open to\ndoubt. The theory, however, does not rest on particular cases, but\non general considerations.\nWe may say, therefore, that the future exists now in the sense\nthat it is determined by the present. Yet it is not immutably\nfixed, but subject to modifications which are themselves determined\nby actions taking place in the current present.\nMy theory is that the deepest stratum of the subliminal mind is\nin permanent conscious contact with this ever-changing future and\nthat precognitions occur when, for some reason which we do not under-\nstand, the knowledge acquired by the subliminal of events lying\nahead of the supraliminal specious present is somehow transmitted\nthrough the threshold ; such knowledge, can, of course, be only of\nthe future as it then is, or, in other words, as it then is determined\nto be by the present. It will have been observed that I have been\nusing terms which imply the reality of time, whereas I have admitted\nmy adherence to the opposite view. But when doing so I particu-\nlarly limited my remarks to completely determined sequences, while\nnow we are discussing non-determined events. Although I agree with\nMacTaggart that time is unreal as regards determined sequences,\nI hold that it is real, or rather I ought to say that change is real,\nfor time is only the common element abstracted from change, in\ncases of non-determined or freewill events. A non-determined event\nis the coming into existence of something entirely neiv. In so far as\nman possesses freedom of will he is subject to true time. Hence I\nclaim that I was justified in the above use of terms implying its\nreality.\n\f92 H. F. SaUmarsh [part\nIt i.s obvious, of course, that the theory which I have suggested\nwill account only for precognitions of determined events. I see no\nreason, and have no evidence for believing, that precognitions of\nnon-determined events ever occur. In fact. I regard them as\nimpossible.\nThat this view implies a very large restriction of the scope of \\\nfreewill, I am ready to admit, but I think that it can be shown on\nother grounds that such restriction is necessary. A discussion of the\nmatter would be out of place here, so I will content myself with\nstating that, in my opinion, freewill should be regarded as limited to\na very occasional non-determined change and not as an often\nexercised faculty.\nI regard it as possible that, although a man may theoretically\npossess some degree of freedom, he may not, in the whole course of\nhis life, ever actually exercise it.^\nI am perfectly aware that this hypothesis which I have outlined\nmay seem fantastic and far-fetched.\nIt may seem plainly repugnant to common sense to suggest that\na future event may exist in any sense and yet be subject to change,\nbut I cannot see that this difficulty is any greater as regards the\nfuture than as regards the present. The present xmdoubtedly exists,\nand yet, if freewill be accepted, it can be changed.\nMy theory does not deny the reality of time, or rather I should\nsay of change, for even if the whole past, present and future is\nalready existent, changes occur in some parts thereof, but it is only\nas a result of non-determined events, such as freewill acts, that\nthese changes occur ; for determined events the reality of time is\ndenied.\nThe position as regards time on this view may be briefly stated as\nfollows. Determined sequences of events do not exhibit real change ;\nthey are inexorably fixed. Therefore true time does not apply to\nthem. They are subject, however, to temporal location ; that is to\nsay, they stand in relations of the temporal order before and after.\nTemporal location must be accepted as a fundamental feature of\nexistence quite distinct from true time.\n' The two varieties of the determinist theory would be represented as follows\non our wke model. On the fatalist theory all the wires are rigid. Though the\nobserver may possess freewill he cannot move them, for, whatever course he\nmay elect to pursue, the future is unalterable. I doubt if this theory is really\ntenable. On the ordinary determinist theory, he cannot exercise freewill.\nHe is only an observer, all his actions are represented by wires, there is nothing\noutside the bundle of wires which is capable of affecting them ;\ntherefore,\nwhether they be rigid or not, their relative positions never change. All\nsequences are causal. On the freewill theory some of his actions are uncaused\nand are thus, as it were, outside the bundle of wires. Some of the wires, being\nflexible, can be moved by this influence from (lutsido.\n\f134] Report on Cases of A'ppareiit Precognition 1)3\nMan, as possessing freedom of will, can initiate real change, i.e.,\ncan bring into existence an entirely new event. He is therefore, in\nso far as he does this, subject to true time. He is also, both as regards\nhis freewill acts and his determined actions, subject to temporal\nlocation, or rather the events in which he is concerned are so subject.\nA temporal location series will appear as a true time series when\nviewed by an observer who is subject to true time. Hence the\ndifficulty experienced in conceiving temporal location apart from\ntime.\nBut as I remarked above, I do not for a moment suggest that this\nis a true account of the way in which events actually happen ; at\nthe best it is only a more or less convenient way of looking at the\nfacts. However, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that\nthere is a fact to be explained, viz., that on a few rare occasions the\nhuman mind does make conscious contact with future events. If a\nbetter explanation than the one I have suggested can be put for-\nward, I will gladly jettison my own hypothesis.\nWhatever hypothesis we adopt, however, I think that this fact\ncompels us to the conclusion that the time conditions governing the\n\u2022 subliminal mind are in some way different from those to which we\nare accustomed in our ordinary life.\nThere is one final remark which I feel bound to make in concluding\nthis already too lengthy report. If either the view of the curve of\nconsciousness as approaching the line of duration asymptotically,\nor that where it is shown as running parallel, be accepted, the sub-\nliminal mind must be regarded as being in contact with the future\nover an indefinite period. It would then seem that our ideas on the\nquestion of survival must be affected thereby.\nIn a sense, we are now, at this present moment, living in the inde-\nfinite future ; hence the question, \" Do I survive bodily death ?\"\ntakes on an entirely different complexion.\nIf we could find a well authenticated case of a precognition of\nwhich the fulfilling event happened after the death of the percipient,\nthen I think we should have evidence relevant to the question of\nsurvival. I cannot say that I have found any such case among those\nwhich I have collected, but it is quite likely that such may occur.\nAlthough it is not definitely stated in his account, I think that the\ncase of M. Berteaux quoted by Prof. Richet in L'Avenir et la Pre-\nmofiition is probably an instance. It would be interesting to learn,\nif possible, whether the medium who made the prediction predeceased\nor survived M. Berteaux. I do not say that precognition proves\nsurvival, for it may be that physical death involves the withdi-awing\nof consciousness from a future ahead of the date of death, but I do\nthink that it is a factor which has to be reckoned with in any dis-\ncussion of the subject.\n\f94 H.

If we take a number of successful cases\nand classify them under various categories it is sometimes possible\nto estimate the chance distribution under the different headings,\nthen, if it is found that the actual distribution shows a divergence\nsulficiently large to be considered significant we are entitled to infer\nthat some factor other than chance has been involved.\nFor example take the number of cases in which the event foreseen\nwas death and compare it with that of the other cases.

Hallucinatory cases\nshow 35 deaths to 28 others = 55-55% death, while other types show\nonly 65 to 162 = 28-63%-\nTo test whether this is significant we apply the usual Contingency\nformula\n2 _ {ad - hcf {a + h-\\-c + d)\n^ ~(a + b){G + d){a + c){b + d) ' 'i\nwhere a, b, c, d, are the four observed numbers.\nIn this case the value of ;)(2 = 15-82 and reference to the\nappropriate tables ^ shows that the probability of this distribu-\ntion being due to chance is very much less than -01 (1 in\n100) so that the observed discrepancy may be taken as definitely\nsignificant.-\nIt follows therefore, either that the distribution of precognition of\ndeath in the types of case other than hallucinatory is that due to\nchance, in which case there must be some other factor operating in\nhallucinations to produce a significant increase, or the distribution\nin hallucinations is due to chance, when we must admit that\nsome other factor has operated in the other types to bring about\na significant decrease, or else of course the distribution in no\ncase is due to chance. Whichever view we take we cannot avoid\nthe conclusion that chance alone is not responsible for all the\nphenomena.\nIt may be that the suggestion which I made when discussing the\nfigures simply in the light of inspection, viz., that the higher ratio\nof death cases in hallucinations is due to the greater emotional tone\nattached to such events is sufficient to account for this discrepancy.\nAnd if this be so, an important conclusion follows. If the cause of\nthe predominance of death cases in hallucinations arises from a\npeculiar characteristic of the event foreseen, it seems to follow that\nthat event, while still in what we call the future, exercises an in-\nfluence and produces an effect in the present. This, if admitted,\ngoes a long way towards confirming the reality of precognition and,\nI submit, lends colour to the hypothesis which I have put forward\nto account for the phenomena. For the effect which is produced is\nan effect on the mind of a percipient exactly similar in character to\nthat which would be produced if the event were perceived in the\nnormal way, i.e. as a present event. This is, however, somewhat of\na digression. To return to the question of mathematical treatment\nof the data. In selecting the particular categories to be analysed\n'Fisher's Stntistical Methods for Beserirch Workers, Table III.\n^ I am indebted to Mr Wliately Carington for help in computing these\nsignificances.\n\f134] Appendix B 101\ntliert' are certiuii points which must be cousidered and certain cor-,\nrectioiis which must be made.\nThe first subdivision of the cases is into \" good\", \" ordinary\",\nand \" non-precognitive\", and these are classified under the difi^erent\nheadings such as dreams, impressions, etc.\nNow as regards this classification the following considerations must\nbe borne in mind.\n(1) The classification simply represents my individual opinion and\nother judges might arrive at different results.\n(2) The basis of the classification is twofold, (o) amount of detail,\n(6) quality of evidence.\nAs regards (a) this might in some cases be susceptible of mathe-\nmatical treatment, but (b) stands on quite a different footing. A\nperfectly good case may be spoiled, either because the investigator\nneglected to obtain confirmatory evidence, or because the witnesses\nrefused on quite irrelevant grounds to give that evidence . Or again\nthe circumstances might have been such that no confirmation could\nhave been possible, yet the precognition might have been genuine\nfor all that.\nThe fact is that this classification of cases refers, not to the occur-\nrence of precognition or the characteristics of the phenomenon, but\nsolely to our grounds for believing that it occurs.\nIt seems possible at first sight that a useful comparison might be\nmade between the ratios of good cases to ordinary of two different\ntypes, e.g. between dreams and impressions, as, although the figures\nare simply the expression of my opinion, I am not likely to have\nerred in favour of one type against the other. Any error may be\nassumed to be spread uniformly over the whole and would not,\ntherefore, vitiate the result. Still, owing to the classification being\nbased partly on quality of evidence, I cannot see that it can yield\nany information about the nature or cause of precognition.\nAs regards the classification into the various types of event fore-\nseen this objection would not apply ; there is little room for error\nand practically none for individual bias, the only possible loophole\nfor differences of opinion would be those which I have mentioned\nwhen discussing the figures of these classes ;\nthey are, however, quite\nunimportant as regards number.\nAs following on the line of thought suggested by the example\nworked out above, I think that a fruitful comparison might be made\nbetween precognitions of events having high emotional tone, i.e.\ndeaths, accidents and non-trivial incidents, and those not having\nthis, viz., trivial incidents and winning numbers. I leave out the\ncategories \" course of illness \" and \" arrival \", as being most likely\ndue to other causes such as telepathy, auto-suggestion, etc. I\nalso make a deduction from \" accidents to material things '\nof\n\f102 H.

This must be admitted, but as the error ansmg from this\nwould presumably be evenly spread over the various types, that is\nto say would not apply with greater force, say, to dreams than to\nhallucinations, it will average out and not materially aftect the\nresult. Secondly, it might be said that the cases as to which we\nhave data do not represent a fair sample of the whole number oi\nprecognitions actually occurring. I have given reasons for holding\nthat in the mediumistic type the number in my collection is probably\na small fraction of the whole ; I think that the same thing applies\nto impressions and, to a smaller extent, to dreams. But hallucina-\ntion is itself so striking a phenomenon that the omissions here may\nreasonably be supposed to be considerably less than with the other\ntypes. 1111, -1\nFurther, the cases not recorded would most probably be mamiy\nprecognitions of trivial events as being less striking and thus more\neasily overlooked or forgotten ; the additions would therefore be\nchiefly to the figures for \" other events \".\nWe therefore have an error of understatement m two types on the\ndream side and one type on the hallucination side, viz. impression.\nAssuming that the error is of about the same magnitude m all cases,\nthe effect would be to increase the figures for non-emotional events,\nand this would make the significance of the discrepancy more marked.\nI think that the above is sufhcient to indicate the possible scope of\nmathematical treatment and I will content myself for the present\nwith the two examples worked out. I would suggest that if anyone\nwas sufiiciently interested in the matter there is a possibility of useful\nwork in further analysis of the data by this method.\n\fPROXY SITTINGS WITH MRS LEONARD\nI\nBy Mrs Lydia W. Allison\nFOREWORD\nReaders of the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas's paper in a recent Part\nof our Proceedings (xli. 139-185) will be aware of the nature and\npurpose of \" proxy sittings.\" They have the advantage that the\nsitter, being ignorant of the circumstances to which the communi-\ncations ostensibly refer, cannot give anything away consciously or\nunconsciously ; nor can direct telepathy from the sitter be con-\nsidered an explanation of any supernormal knowledge these com-\nmunications may show. When therefore we come to weigh the claims\nof various possible hypotheses, we have one less to put into the scales\n.\n_\nMrs Alhson, the proxy sitter in this case, has herself described the\ncircumstances in which she came to hold the sittings and no further\nstatement is necessary on that point. There is, however, one matter\nto which it may be well to call her readers' attention at the outset.\nBy far the strongest evidence linking the trance-statements with\nthe absent sitter, Mr John F. Thomas, and the purporting communi-\ncator, his wife, were obtained at the fourth and last sittings. The\nstatements made in the three earher sittings, though for the most\npart apphcable to Mr and Mrs Thomas, were with a few exceptions\nof such a character as to be near the borderline of what may be\naccounted for by chance coincidence ;\nupon which side of this\nborder they lie is a matter for individual judgment. But the rele-\nvance and accuracy of the statements made at the fourth sitting are\nbeyond what chance will easily account for, and since in this sitting\nwe are ostensibly concerned with the same persons as in the first\nand third, we are justified in regarding these three sittings as forming\na single whole. The case of the second sitting, to which objects\nprovided by Mr Thomas were taken for \" psychometry,\" is in my\nopinion more doubtful, because Feda distinctly stated (p. 114)\nthat the persons here referred to were not the same as in the first\nand third sittings. This is quite possibly a mistake on Feda's part,\nbut it has to be recognised that the second sitting is not entitled to\nthe evidential advantage accruing to the first and third from their\nbeing definitely linked with the fourth. The incidents which seem\nto afford the strongest grounds for supposing that the second sitting\nfalls into line with the others are the references to the mausoleum\nand the plant without flowers (pp. 115-6).\nHelen De G. Salter.\n104\n\f[part 134] Proxif Sittings ivith Mrs Leonard 105\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the autumn of 1927, Mr John F. Thomas, of Detroit, Michigan,\ncalled on me one evening, introduced by Mrs Thomas Guinan, at\nthat time secretary to Dr Walter Franklin Prince, of the Boston\nSociety for Psychic Research. Mrs Guinan had previously written\nthat Mr Thomas and his son had had some interesting sittings with\nmediums in England and America with his deceased wife as the\npurporting communicator. I did not attach any special significance\nto his visit because persons connected with psychical research have\nfrequently called on me when passing through New York, at the\nsuggestion of some mutual friend or acquaintance.\nIn the course of a casual conversation about the Boston Society,\n(of which we both are active members), and related topics, Mr\nThomas told me that Dr J. B. Rhine of the psychology department\nat Duke University was editing the records of Mr Thomas's experi-\nments. He did not mention any details concerning the sittings and\nsaid nothing that gave me the slightest hint of his personal affairs.\nI did not see Mr Thomas again until two years later, in November\n1929, after the sittings on which this report is based had been held.\nWhen I recalled how at our first meeting he had avoided personal\nsubjects and references to his sittings, he replied that he habitually\nrefrained from allusions that might be informative.\nShortly after Mr Thomas's first visit I saw Dr and Mrs Rhine,\nwho stopped in New York en route to Duke. Dr Rhine told me that\nhe was working on a very interesting set of sittings collected by\nMr Thomas, but mentioned no details. These facts were the only\nones I could recall concerning Mr Thomas, when a letter arrived from\nhim on 10 May 1929, one week before my departure for England,\nfrom which I quote :\n\" Mrs Guinan writes me that you are going to\nLondon this summer and I have been wondering whether you would\nbe interested in trying out an experiment with me there. I still\nhave a London secretary (Mrs Hankey) who holds absent sittings\nwith various mediums from time to time. It seems to me it would\nbe quite good evidence if you would use this secretary for a few\nsittings with such mediums as Mrs Elliot and Mrs Garrett. If you\nwere unknown to the secretary and any of my people participated\nin the sitting the material would at least serve to stretch the tele-\npathic hypothesis in order to cover the circumstances.\"\nIn response to my request that he describe more fully what he had\nin mind, Mr Thomas repUed that he would like me to take some\narticles to various mediums abroad for psychometry. I answered\nthat I preferred Mrs Leonard to any other medium, enclosing my\nLondon address, and as my sailing date was only three days distant\n\f106 Mrs Lydia W. Allison [part\n1 also wired kim to forward the articles directly to the ship. They\ncame with a note from Mr Thomas saying he would write me further\nto London. Shortly after my arrival there I received the following\nmessage :\n\" Thank you for your letter and the telegram. I hope\nthe articles reached\" you. How would it be to try a sitting with\nMrs Garrett and Mrs Leonard before you get in touch with Mrs\nHankey ? It is possible that a skeptic might raise the point that\nthe mediums associate Mrs Hankey with me and that material\nappropriate to me follows. Of course, I know there is nothing to\nthe point but the most complete way to answer it is to avoid it.\nAfter a sitting or two before Mrs Hankey is brought in, there would\nbe distinct advantages to working with her. [As will be seen later\nI did not follow these suggestions. There remains the possibility of\nnormal leakage.] As to Mrs Leonard, she is, of course, without a\npeer. I had two personal sittings (anonymous) with her in April\nand May 1927, and Mrs Hankey (a professional recorder accus-\ntomed to taking sittings either personal or absent) held one for me\nusing articles on 29 October 1928.\"\nOn this latter occasion Mrs Hankey told Mrs Leonard that the\nsitting was for the American who sat with her in 1927. This admis-\nsion, because of the comparatively small number of American\nLeonard sitters and Mrs Hankey's having recorded Mr Thomas's\npersonal sittings, may have immediately suggested an association to\nMrs Leonard, a surmise which, however, does not affect this report.\nMr Thomas added in his letter that he had not mentioned Mrs\nLeonard to me because he knew how she is importuned for appomt-\nments and he did not want to presume on my entrance there. With\na single exception, I have always stenographically recorded my\nown Leonard sittings. I therefore decided to follow my usual pro-\ncedure in this instance and avoid any suspicion that might arise\nfrom my being accompanied by a recorder. Mr Thomas did not\nknow the dates of my sittings.\nA passage from the record of an absent sitting held for Mr Thomas\nwith Mrs Soule in Boston on 27 February 1928, Miss Lovewell, a\nprofessional stenographer, recording, and Mrs Thomas purporting\nto communicate, appears to have a bearing on this experiment,\nalthough its value is dubious. Mrs Soule, who is also known as\nMrs Chenoweth, is the well-known Boston medium who figures so\nlargely in the investigations of Dr James H. Hyslop and Dr Prince.\nIt reads thus :\n\" I have seen a friend of yours whom I did not know\nbefore I died and I think she will be a help to us. I wonder if you\nwill not be glad to have me refer to a Mrs A. who has talked with\nyou. Well, I have seen her husband over here and he feels as I\ndo that we are very dependent on the dear ones on earth for our\nsuccess in getting our messages over.\" My last sitting with Mrs\n\f1.34] Proxy Sittings with Mrs Leonard 107\nSoule was more than five years before this reference was received.\nI have no reason to think that she knows my name, as I had always\ngone to her under a pseudonym, not beginning with \" A.\"\nAs stated above, Mr Thomas had called upon me for the first\ntime in the autumn of 1927. Commenting later on the prediction,\nhe writes :\n\" I am sure I had never told anybody about my call\nupon Mrs Allison in New York. As a matter of fact, it was not in\nmy own mind, because I hunted about mentally among the relatives\nand mutual friends of Mrs Thomas and myself to fit in this reference\nand finally gave it up as a lost cause. It did not occur to me that\nit was about Mrs AUison until after I wrote her about joining with\nme in the London experiments.\"\nOn the other hand, it never occurred to me not to mention Mr\nThomas's visit. I recall two instances when I did so, both times to\nfriends active in psychic research. The prospect of future work\ntogether never entered my mind. Our meeting might, of course,\nhave reached the ears of Mrs Soule. Even had she been informed\nof our conversation, the point remains, however, that she predicted\nmy participation fifteen months before it was actually considered.\nThe following points in her statement are correct: \"Mrs A.\"\nwould apply to me ; Mrs Thomas had not known me ;\nMr Thomas\nand I had talked together and my husband is dead.\nBlanket Statement.\nFor purposes of brevity I have adopted certain abbreviations and\ndesignations for use in this report. Throughout I assume that the\ncommunicators are what they represent themselves to be and omit\nthe quahfying word \" purported.\" The most frequent communi-\ncators in my previously reported sittings, who again assist in these,\nare Dr James H. Hyslop, described by Feda as \" the 'fessor,\" \" the\ntest gentleman \" or \"the older gentleman \" and my husband, Dr\nEdward Wood AlUson, whom I refer to as E.W.A. and whom Feda\ncalls \" your gentleman.\" The initials E.L.T. specify Mrs Thomas,\nwho was the principal communicator in Mr Thomas's Leonard\nsittings, as she appears to be in mine. Feda addresses me as \" Mrs\nLyddie \"\n;\nmy own initials are L.W.A. Mr Thomas's report,\n\" Case Studies Bearing upon Survival,\" Boston Society for Psychic\nResearch, 1929, is indicated by \" Case Studies.\" His series of four\nLeonard sittings preceding those of this report were held on 26\nApril 1927 ; 12 May 1927 ; 29 October 1928 ; and 20 May 1929.\nAt the first two Mr Thomas was present, with Mrs Hankey recording ;\nthe others were recorded by Mrs Hankey, who presented articles\nwhich Mr Thomas had sent to her for Mrs Leonard to psychometrise.\nThese sittings are referred to as Sitting 1, present ;\nSitting 2,\npresent ;\nSitting 3, absent, and Sitting 4, absent. Since Mr Thomas\n\f108 Mrs Lydia W. Allison [part\nwas almost a complete stranger to me and 1 knew hardly aiiytliiug\nabout his family or his affairs, 1 have throughout this rej^ort stated\nthe rare instances where I personally could definitely aflirm or\ndeny the truth of Feda's remarks. Otherwise, it may be taken for\ngranted that I had no conscious knowledge of the degree of appro-\npriateness of all Feda's other statements.\nSitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard, Monday 3 June 1929,\nTankerton, Whitstable, Kent.\nSitter : L.W.A.\nIt was not my intention in this first sitting of my 1929 series to\ninvite failure by proposing an unusual experiment. Moreover I\nwanted the sitting for myself. I had left Mr Thomas's articles\nbehind and hoped to revive the easy, cordial relations that have for\nsome years existed between Feda and myself before venturing to\nsuggest psychometry. Feda opened the sitting with several state-\nments which were appropriate enough to me and a prediction which\nthus far has not been fulfilled. She then went on to give me a few\nfurther examples of her apparent faculty for acquiring knowledge\nof contemporary events concerning sitters. These are omitted from\nthis report. All the annotations given below are by Mr Thomas,\nexcept those in square brackets, which are my own.^\nRecord of the Sitting.

[On in-\nquiry Mr Thomas wrote me that\nhe did not wear glasses at Mrs\nLeonard's.]\nI had been having my eyes re-\ntested for new glasses, partly as a\nresult of a statement that I re-\nceived in an absent sitting with\nMrs Garrett, on 2 February\n1929, recorded by Mrs Hankey,\nand sent to me in Detroit, as fol-\nlows :\n\" I do not think he wears\nglasses in the ordinary way but\nshe is giving me that there is\nsomething wrong with one eye.\nI wonder if he has not got to at-\ntend to his eyes ... in some way\nto the right eye.\" My visits to\nthe oculist on 20 and 21 May\n1929 were the first times I had\nconsulted an oculist for several\nyears.

I have\nnot as yet (9.6.29) bought the\nnew ones, but expect to do so.\nCorrect.\n[I did not know that Mr\nThomas was especially inter-\nested in Dr Hyslop. Feda casu-\nally alluded to Dr Hyslop in Mr\nThomas's first three Leonard sit-\ntings, with appropriate but not\nevidential remarks.]\nWithin three or four weeks I\nhad been going through the Pro-\nceedings of the American Society\nin order to find a quotation from\nDr Hyslop with which to close\nmy report to the Boston Society,\nentitled \" Case Studies.\" I\nfound one and used Dr Hyslop's\nname in this report, which was\nmailed out from York, Pa., aboxit\nsix days preceding this sitting.\n[Mr Thomas has resided in vari-\nous parts of the United States.]\nAt the time of this sitting I\nwas at my summer cottage at\nOrchard Lake, about twenty-five\nmiles out from Detroit.

There was, of course, no intimation\nthat these articles had any relation to the previous sitting. This\nwas the first time that I had ever asked Feda to psychometrise\nanything. Considering the difficulty of obtaining Leonard sittings\nthere was more reason for Feda to suppose that I had a personal in-\nterest in these articles than that they were the property of a stranger.\n[Almost the whole of this second sitting is omitted. The state-\nments made, although many of them were correct as applied to\nMr Thomas, were for the most part rather vague, and of such a kind\nas to leave too much scope for individual interpretation.

Mr Thomas no doubt read\nthe entire passage before making\nhis annotation.] We had not\nlived particularly near any ceme-\ntery of this description. All the\npoints apply to the cemetery in\nwhich the mausoleum where\nE.L.T. is interred is located. We\nhad not Uved nearer to this than\nseven or eight miles at any time,\nbut we often drove by it.\nNearly every time E.L.T. and\nI came in sight of this building\nwhen driving we did look at this\nplace and talk about it in a\nrather desultory way as a place\nfor burial. As a matter of fact,\nthe reason burial was made there\nwas because of these more or\nless light-hearted references we\nhad made to the building. This\nwas the first time any member of\nthe family was placed in the\ncemetery.

The achy and tired feel-\ning was due to too much golf and\nI noticed it only when I had\noccasion to go up a flight of\nstairs, such as the marble steps\nat the mausoleum. One striking\nthing about the remembrances\nin this mausoleum is the pre-\ndominance of wreaths and other\nsymboUcal pieces made of leaves,\na fact that is due to the impossi-\nbility of keeping flowering plants\nalive and fresh in a building of\nthis kind. I had, myself, been\nlooking for some kind of a plant\nof green leaves that would live\nand thrive there and I had fin-\nally before this sitting decided\nupon a fern, which was not\nplaced until 31 July.

It therefore seems\nnatural that the trend of this third sitting follows the thread coaxed\nalong and encouraged by me in the first sitting and further developed\nin the second. Although, as will be noted, Feda did not connect\nthe personalities, living or deceased, that she introduced in the\nfirst and third sittings with those of the articles I presented for\npsychometry in the second sitting, yet it is obvious that while she\nherself denied the connection, the content of all three sittings is\nfairly homogeneous.\nRecord of Sitting.\nGood morning, good morning.\nI was just talking to them. They\nare both here and send their love.\nYour gentleman says, \" I have\nconstituted myself\"\u2014I wonder\nwhat that means, say messenger\n\u2014such a funny word, \" a messen-\nger will do.\" Because lately a\nlot of people have been asking\nhim to get in touch with people\non the earth through you.

(Feda, I wish he\ncould help the people he spoke of\nin my first sitting.)\nHe is going to help them. He\nwas just approaching the woman.\nIn the first sitting he told you\nabout a lady who passed over not\nlong ago, but a lady in the mid-\ndles. And he wanted to help her\nbecause she was a very good wo-\nman and also because the people\nthat belong to her do miss her so\nmuch on earth.\nThis has nothing to do with\nthe people he was speaking of at\nthe last sitting. It was the first\nsitting.\nThis lady he is speaking of now\n[Apparently I myself confused\nthe content of the first and sec-\nond sittings and Feda took up\nthe confusion.]\nE.L.T. passed over three years\nand two months before this sit-\nting, at the age of forty-eight.\n[My guess would have been\nanywhere between two and five\nyears before and that E.L.T.\nwas probably middle-aged.]\n[See introductory note to this\nsitting.]\n\f134] Proxy Sittings ivith Mrs LeoHard\nhas got a geutl\u00abnmu she is very\nfond of and is trying to get back\nto.

The person on the earth\nis not someone who is always\nwith you. He seems to be away\nfrom you. I do not mean in\nEngland, but that man in Amer-\nica isn't close to you, but in a\ndifferent condition and place. I\nget the feeling that you know\nhim more through writing than\nthrough seeing you. And it isn't\nonly that he is in a different\u2014but\nthe kind of place and circum-\nstances are very different.\nThen he gives me a rather cut\noff feeling, as if he is seeing him-\nself out of things. \"It is not\neasy to get help, to get com-\nmunication here.\" He gives me\nthat feeling rather strongly. I\ndo not think he is getting a lot\nof help where he is and he is\nthinking of you as being able to\nhelp him more than he can get\nhelp where he is.\nNow I am seeing a big \" B.\"\nI think that has got something to\ndo with the man.\nIn a way he is rather impor-\ntant.

Allison [part\nSitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard, Thursday 13 June 1929.\nSitter: L.W.A.\nOn 12 June, the day before this sitting, I had an anonymous\nsitting at the British College of Psychic Science for Mr Thomas\nwith a medium named Miss Thomas, recommended to me by Mrs\nMcKenzie, the Honorary Secretary of the College. The appointment\nwas made over the telephone. My only stipulation was that I\ndesired a sitting with any medium good at psychometry. The results\nwere negative. I had presented the same articles as at sitting 2\nabove. After the sitting I saw Mrs McKenzie and we chatted about\nvarious subjects connected with psychical research. Mrs McKenzie,\naware of my interest and connection with the Boston Society, told\nme that Mr Thomas's \" Case Studies \" had arrived a few days ago.\nShe very kindly offered to lend me the volume. I refused, for\nobvious reasons, but I deliberately asked one question, \" Do you\nknow what Mr Thomas's wife's name was ?\n\" Mrs McKenzie said\nshe thought it must be Ethel, although she did not think the com-\nplete name had been given in the record, only attempts to get it.\nMy reason for that question was to see if Feda would give me the\ncorrect name after I knew it. I was attempting to get the name\ntelepathically. It never occurred to me until much later that if\nFeda gave me the name under those circumstances she might only\nbe repeating something she had already given in an earlier Thomas\nsitting.\nRecord of Sitting.

Dodds\nThe composition of this paper was suggested to me by the following\npassage in the address delivered to the Society in 193'2 by Dr Brown :\n\" It seems to me that at the present day the evidence for survival\nwhich must have most weight with us is the evidence from philo-\nsophical and religious considerations, from the nature of the human\nmind, the nature of human values, and the extent to which survival\nitself would make life and the -whole world process more rational.\nI do think that considerations such as these are sufficient to produce\nin our minds at any rate an active pragmatic conviction of survival.\n'\n'\nA little further on he adds :\nIt seems to me that the scientific researchers are concerned\nrather with getting sufficient evidence to supplemetbt evidence that\nthey all accept as really the fundamental groundwork in their\nreligious and philosophical beliefs.\" ^\nOn reading these remarks of Dr Brown's, the following reflections\noccurred to me. (1) If it is true, as Dr Brown says it is, that all\nthe scientific researchers who are working on the interpretation\nof the supernormal evidence are from the start imbued with an\nantecedent conviction that survival is a fact, then it would be not\nonly interesting but actually prudent to see how this evidence\nappears to less biassed observers or, failing that, to observers whose\nbias is in the opposite direction. (2) There should be no difficulty\nin obtaining such observers : for, so far as I can judge, the view\nof the antecedent probability of survival which Dr Brown attributes\nto all the scientific researchers \" is not that which would be taken\nby the majority of working scientists outside this Society ; it is\nalso in strong conflict with the views of distinguished philosophers\n1 Proc, xU. 86.\nK 147\n\f148 Professor E. R. Dodcls\nof various schools like Dr Broad, Earl Russell, and the late\nr. H. Bradley ; and it conflicts no less with the impression\nformed by a large number of educated people who are neither\nscientists nor professional philosophers. Taking myself as an\naverage representative of this last class, it occurred to me further\nthat it would be useful to me, and might possibly be of interest\nto others, if I attempted first to present a brief reasoned statement\non the probability of survival as it appears to me, and then to\nformulate in the light of this statement an attitude towards the\nsupernormal evidence with the problems of interpretation which it\npresents. This seemed to me preferable to the usual practice of\neither considering the supernormal evidence in isolation from the\nantecedent evidence, or taking for granted a particular view of the\nlatter without attempting a reasoned defence of it.\nI was, however, well aware that the view which any man takes\nof the antecedent probability, or otherwise, of human survival\nmust itself depend to a great extent upon his general philosophical\nand religious outlook, and that in turn upon his individual tempera-\nment and history. Hence any attempt at discussing the antecedent\nprobability of survival runs the risk of raising issues so vast, so\nvague and so insoluble as to swallow up the entire discussion in a\nfutile exchange of unproved generalisations. If this were to be\navoided, it seemed necessary to confine myself to a statement of\nthe case as it might appear to a person sharing the same general\npresuppositions as myself, and to indicate explicitly what these\npresuppositions are. The argument claims validity only in so\nfar as this framework is accepted. That is why in the title of my\npaper I have violated the esteemed precept, beloved of girls'\nschools, which forbids to the writer on general topics the introduction\nof the pronoun \" I \". This paper does not pretend to be a complete\nstatement of the case against survival ; it is merely a statement\nof my own reasons, not for regarding survival as impossible,\nbut for thinking the hypothesis unproved (and in some at least\nof its forms definitely improbable), and in that sense disbelieving\nit.\nThe presuppositions I have referred to are two in number. The\nfirst is that our sole means of reaching a conclusion on this question\nconsist of observation and experiment together with the exercise\nof reason. This excludes the view that we have divine authority\nfor the belief in survival. A complete statement of the case against\nsurvival would have to take account of this view, and investigate\nits claim to historical truth. I do not share the curious opinion\nthat such investigation is bad form, nor the alternative opinion\nthat it has been rendered unnecessary by the conclusion of a treaty\nof peace between science in the person of Professor Jeans and\n\f135] Why I Do Xot Believe in Survival 149\nreligion in the person of Bishop Barnes. But it is evident that\nto attempt in the present paper any statement of my reasons for\nrejecting this view would carry the discussion too far from the\nimmediate question at issue.\nMy second presupposition is that the validity of our apparent\nexperience of mind and matter as two distinct modes of reality is\naccepted as a working hypothesis on the empirical level, without\nexcluding the possibility that either may prove in the last analysis\nto be a mere appearance of the other. Both idealism (or \" men-\ntalism \") and materialism seem to me to be possible ways of inter-\npreting our experience ; neither seems to be required by the facts,\nand a survey of their history suggests that the influence of each has\ndepended less on its inherent convincingness than on its political or\nreligious utility, on the variations of social demand, and on the\ndialectical dexterity of its exponents. This being so, an argument\nwhich is valid only on the idealist or only on the materialist hypo-\nthesis carries, for me, less weight than one which is valid without\nthis limitation.\nWithin this very wide framework, then, before approaching the\nevidence from psychical research I ask myself what are the ante-\ncedent probabilities for or against survival. In its favour I find\ntwo distinct types of argument advanced. The first, which Dr\nBroad calls metaphysical, and which Dr Brown intends (I think)\nwhen he speaks of the evidence from the nature of the human\nmind \", asserts under varying forms that our mind has a quality\nin common with the ultimate stuff of Reality, or with the creator of\nReality, and that the possession of this quality assures its con-\ntinuance : in theological language, it asserts man's immortality\nas a consequence from his divinity. On this argument, two reflec-\ntions occur to me. In the first place, it rests on a proposition about\nReality (or about its creator) which may be true, but which I do\nnot certainly know to be true. I do not know of what ultimate\nstuff the universe is constituted, nor how it came into being ; and\ncertainly I find nothing in my experience which assures me that\nmy continued existence is indispensable to it. But secondly, if\nthis type of argument proves anything at all, it appears to me to\nprove too much. As the late Dr McTaggart put it,\n\" I do not see how existence in future time could be shown to be\nnecessary in the case of any being whose existence in past time is\nadmitted not to be necessary. If the universe got on without me\na hundred years ago, what reason could be given for denying that\nit might get on without me a hundred years hence ? Or if it is\nconsistent with my eternal nature that its temporal manifestation\nshould begin at some point in time, could we find any reason for\nsupposing that the cessation of that manffestation at some point\n\f150 Professor E. R. Dodds [part\nin time would be inconsistent with that nature ? I do not see of\nwhat kind such a reason could be, nor do I know of any attempt that\nhas been made to establish one.\" ^\nIn other words, if we accept the metaphysical argument as a\nvalid proof of survival, we must accept it also as a valid proof of\npre-existence. This is, for me, unfortunate. For the doctrine of\npre-existence is open to several objections which I do not know\nhow to meet. Until these have been resolved for me, I feel con-\nstrained to reject the theory of pre-existence, and with it the\nmetaphysical argument for survival.\nI think, however, that even if I could accept the metaphysical\nargument, with all its consequences, this would have but little\nlogical bearing on the interpretation of mediumistic utterances.\nFor the entity whose immortality and pre-existence the meta-\nphysical argument has been held to certify is not, so far as we can\njudge, at all like the entities which converse with us at seances.\nIt is a timeless, noiimenal self, exempt from passion and withdrawn\nfrom change, and held to be imperishable either because of that\nvery detachment or because of its capacity for pure impersonal\nthought. Now, whatever the \" controls \" and \" communicators\n\"\nof Mrs Piper or Mrs Leonard may be, it seems certain that they are\nnot noiimenal selves (if they were, they would give small satisfaction\nto the average sitter). Far from being exempt from passion, they\nare frequently emotional to the point of sentimentality ; and pure\nimpersonal thought is precisely what their communications con-\nspicuously lack. Hence I do not think that the metaphysical\nargument, even if it were valid, could help us, at any rate directly,\nin the interpretation of these phenomena.\nI turn to a brief consideration of the ethical arguments for survival\n(or, more exactly, for immortality), described by Dr Brown as \" the\nevidence from the nature of human values, and the extent to which\nsurvival would make life and the whole world-process more rational.\"\nIt is argued (i) that an apprehension of timeless values in some way\n1 Some Dogmas of Religion, chap. iv.\n- 1 have been asked what these are. In answer, I should mention the\nfollowing difficulties among others, (a) If the doctrine means anything,\nit means that in addition to the recognised factors of heredity and environ-\nment a third, presumably far stronger factor, is operative in the formation of\nhuman character : is it not strange that no certain trace of the activity of\nthis factor has been detected by psychologists ? (6) It means, again, that the\nnew-born infant possesses, or rather is, a mature and experienced mind : is\nit not strange that all the manifestations of that mind are precisely what we\nshould expect them to be if it were neither mature nor experienced, but were\nin fact, what it appears to be, an infant muid in an infant body '?\n(c) The\ndoctrine involves the assumption of an act of incarnation whose mechanism\nis exceedingly difficult to picture and which lacks even the remotest analogue\nin our biological knowledge.\n\f136] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 151\nconstitutes a claim to a permanent existence in time ;\n(ii) that the\nnon-survivalist view is in some way incompatible with the good\nlife for man, and should therefore be rejected ;\n(iii) that the non-\nsurvivalist view is incompatible with the goodness and rationality\nof the universe, and should therefore be rejected. I confess that\nthese arguments appear to me completely nugatory. The first, so\nfar as it is not a restatement of the old metaphysical argument,\nseems to rest on a mere confusion. If values are really \" timeless \",\ntheir timeless nature may be as fully actualised in an experience\nlasting thirty seconds as in one which lasts thirty thousand years.\nAnd observation does not suggest that there is in nature any\ncorrelation whatever between valuableness and temporal per-\nmanence. As to the second argument, I discover little either in\nmy personal experience or in my reading of history which tends to\nshow that a belief in survival is morally necessary or even, for the\naverage person, morally useful ; but were the reverse the case, I\nshould still find it impossible to leap from an admission of the moral\nutility of the belief to Dr Brown's \" active pragmatic conviction\n\"\nof its objective truth. Finally, to consider the third argument, I\nfind death no more irrational than copulation, birth, and a thousand\nother natural events ; while to the suggestion that our extinction\namounts to a charge of immorality or insanity against the universe,\nI can only reply that the universe, so far as my limited knowledge\nof it extends, is like other fathers of families \" capable de tout \".\nThose who desire a more critical examination of this group of\narguments may be referred to the eleventh chapter of The Mind and\nits Place in Nature, where Dr Broad breaks these butterflies upon\nthe wheel of a remorseless and elegant logic. With his conclusion,\nthat no valid philosophical grounds whatever have been produced\nfor believing in human immortality (or in human survival either),\nI find myself regretfully obliged to agree.\nMy next question is. Are there any positive antecedent grounds\nfor rejecting the belief in survival ? If this question means, \" Can\nsurvival be shown on antecedent grounds to be impossible ? \", the\nanswer is, I think, that it cannot, save on the materialist pre-\nsuppositions which, as I said at the outset, I do not feel constrained\nto accept although they may be correct. But secondly, Are there\nany valid grounds for considering survival improbable ? There are\ntwo considerations, each of which seems to me to raise a presump-\ntion, faiiiy strong though falling short of proof, not indeed against\nall forms of the survivahst hypothesis, but against the particular\nform of it which is required to account for the supernormal pheno-\nmena.\nThe first of these considerations is historical, and is in part an\n\f152 Professor E. R. Dodcls [part\nargument from silence. Now arguments from silence are notoriously\ndangerous ; and in this case Dr Broad holds that the absence of\nevidence for survival does not constitute evidence against it, since for\nall we know the conditions of existence after death may be such as to\nexclude the possibility of affirmative evidence being obtained.^ This\nis a perfectly satisfactory answer from the point of view of the ortho-\ndox Christian, who believes the dead to be segregated in Heaven, Hell\nor Purgatory ; it is also satisfactory from the point of view of the\nman who says '\nI believe that the dead survive, but I know nothing\nof their powers or their mode of existence or their location in space.\"\nIt is less satisfactory from the point of view of the spiritualist. For\nif the spiritualist interpretation of the supernormal phenomena is\ncorrect, we know a good deal about the dead, and what we know is\ninconsistent with Dr Broad's defence. All spiritualists believe that\nthe dead have both the will and the means to communicate with the\nliving, either by controlling the hand or vocal organs of a medium\nor by influencing her mind telepathically. Most of them believe\nalso that the dead can make their existence known by speaking to\nus directly, without the intervention of a human organism ;\nby\nappearing in visible form ;\nby the production of supernormal lights ;\nby the supernormal movement of objects ; and in various other\nways. Now if the dead are really endowed with powers so varied\nand so remarkable ; and if it is true, as they themselves tell us, that\nthey are much occupied with the problem of comforting and assisting\ntheir surviving relatives ; on these assumptions is it not matter for\nsurprise that they refrained for so long from exercising their powers\nand making their existence known ? During two and a half\nmillenia of which we have fairly full written records\u2014say from\n650 B.C. to A.D. 1850\u2014they failed so far as I know to produce\nsatisfactory experimental evidence of their identity.\"^ Why ?\nDuring certain portions of this period they might have endangered\ntheir surviving friends by attempting to communicate with them ;\nbut there were long centuries during which action on their part\nwould have been perfectly safe. Nor was there any lack of the\nnecessary machinery or the necessary interest on the side of the\nliving : the evidence collected in Oesterreich's book on Possession\nshows that the mediumistic trance is a fairly constant phenomenon\nin all ages and among all peoples ; and curiosity about the state of\n1 Op. cit., p. 524.\n- 1 do not, of course, deny either that necromancy was occasionally prac-\ntised, especially in later antiquity and the Middle Ages, or that the belief in\nthe power of the dead to return in certain circumstances was general in the\nlatter period. But the \" spirits \" appear to have made little or no attempt to\nestablish their identity ; and the ordinary mediaeval belief was founded\nmuch less on contemporary experiment than on the biblical story of the witch\nof Endor.\n\f135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 153\nthe dead has left its mark on the Uterature alike of Greece and\nRome, of the Middle Ages, and of the Renaissance. But there is\nsomething more singular still. The two groups of pre-nineteenth-\ncentury mediums about whom we have most information, the\nKHToxoi of the late Graeco-Roman period ^ and the witches of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, while performing a number of\nthe feats performed by modern mediums, perversely attributed\nthem in the one case to the agency of non-human gods or demons,\nin the other to the agency of the devil. Once again, why ? A\nsatisfactory answer may one day be forthcoming ;\nbut until it is, I\ncannot but feel some doubt about the correctness of the spirituaHst\ninterpretation of the contemporary phenomena.\nI come now to my second consideration, which is a very familiar\none. It is drawn from certain apparent features of the relationship\nbetween the living mind and the living organism. Now it must be\nadmitted that any attempt to interpret psycho-physical relations\nis in the present state of our knowledge fraught with danger and\nuncertainty, especially for the non-physiologist Uke myself. Keeping\nthis warning before me, let me nevertheless consider the phenomena\nof old age. Anyone who has lived much in the society of the aged,\nand has observed them closely, will I think agree, whatever inter-\npretation he may put upon the facts, that not only the human\norganism but the human mind, or that portion of it which expresses\nitself in thought, feeling and action, does appear to grow old. I\nam thinking here not merely of the grosser effects of time, those\nwhich a physician would classify as symptoms of senile decay ; but\nalso of the subtler psychological changes which come with advancing\nyears, the gradually increasing imperviousness to new ideas, the\ngradually diminishing response to emotional stimuli, above all, the\ngrowing sense of finality, of fulfilment, of a destiny accomplished\nand accepted\u2014in a word, the progressive encroachment upon the\nwill to live of a new will to cease from living. Analogous changes\nappear, so far as we can judge, to attend the onset of old age in the\nhigher animals, notably the dog and the horse.\nCan these appearances\u2014pathetic in some of their aspects, in\nothers singularly beautiful\u2014be interpreted in a manner consistent\nwith survival ? Many have thought so ; but I cannot myself feel\nthat the interpretations they have suggested are free from grave\ndifficulty. It may be held that the old age of the mind is a tempo-\nrary disease caused by the action of toxins produced by the ageing\norganism, and that on separation from the organism the mind will\nrecover. But I find it hard to believe that growing old is really a\nreversible process\u2014that mental changes so far-reaching as those\nassociated with old age can be undone even when the supposed\n^ See Journal, xxvii. 216 ff.\n\f154 Professor E. R. Dodds [part\noriginating cause is removed by death. Moreover, does not this\nline of argument assume a degree of dependence of mental states\nupon organic secretions which is sufficient in itself to create a strong\npresumption against the mind surviving after the dissolution of the\norganism ? Another expedient is to assume that, besides the\nphenomenal self which experiences old age and its natural con-\nsummation in death, there is a remoter, ageless self which does not\ndie because it does not grow old. But this hypothesis, apart from\nthe total absence of any evidence in its favour, seems open to the\nsame objection as the noiimenal self of the metaphysical argument\n\u2014\nfor an ageless being can hardly be credited with an origin in time.\nIn any case, like the noiimenal self, it fails to throw much light on\nthe supernormal phenomena : an element of the personality so\nremote from all ordinary observation and so strangely exempt from\nexperience seems an unlikely carrier for the collection of small\npersonal reminiscences which are the stock-in-trade of the average\n\" communicator \".\nThe general situation as regards the connection between mind\nand body is I think reasonably and moderately stated by Dr Broad,\nwho says :\n^\n\" The view that the mind is existentially dependent on the\norganism and on nothing else is compatible with all the normal\nfacts, and is positively suggested by them, though they do not\nnecessitate it. And it is the simplest possible view to take. The\ntheory that the mind merely uses the body as an instrument is\ndifficult to reconcile with the normal facts.\"\nDr Broad's own theory is that the mind is a compound product\nof the organism j9^?\/-s what he calls a \" psychic factor and that this\npsychic factor survives bodily death although the mind or personality\ndoes not. He claims that this hypothesis (a) covers all the observed\nfacts, both normal and supernormal, and (6) is the minimum hypo-\nthesis which does so. Whether, if the first claim be granted, he is\nright in the second is a question to be discussed at a later stage.\nBut I may venture to suggest here that the hypothesis in question\ndoes not seem to cover the supernormal facts very satisfactorily.\nLet us assume that when the late John Jones professes to com-\nmunicate, and the communication is veridical, what has really\nhappened is that a detached psychic factor, once an element in the\nmind of John Jones, has allied itself with the organism of the\nmedium to form a new temporary mind, which is not the mind of\nJohn Jones but has one factor in common with that mind. Dr\nBroad supposes this alliance to result in the reinstatement of certain\nmemories which were once present to the mind of John Jones, and\nthe reproduction of certain modes of behaviour which were once\n1 Op. cit., 549.\n\f135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 155\ncharacteristic of that mind. So far, so good. But what if \" John\nJones \" goes on to describe correctly some event which has occurred\nsince John Jones's death, and is unknown to the medium and\nperhaps also to the sitter ? There is nothing exceptional about\nsuch an occurrence at a good sitting. Mr Saltmarsh, in his valuable\nanalysis of 142 sittings with Mrs Warren Elliott, found that in this\nseries the total number of veridical statements about events subse-\nquent to the death of the supposed communicator was actually\nlarger that the total number of such statements about events prior\nto his death ; and that the percentage of veridicality was also higher\nin the statements about events subsequent to death. ^ Now this is\nhardly what I should expect if the source of the communications\nwere the surviving personality of John Jones ; but still less is it\nwhat I should expect if the source were a psychic factor of the sort\nassumed by Dr Broad. \" A psychic factor by itself \", says Dr\nBroad, \" is no more a mind than John Jones's corpse is a mind.\"\nWhat it is, or does, when it is \" by itself \" (i.e. unconnected with\nan organism), Dr Broad cannot tell us ; but at any rate it is not a\nmind. From the day that John Jones's organism perished, his\nwidowed psychic factor ceased to function as a mind, or element in\na mind, until the day that it contracted an irregular union with the\nmedium's organism. How, then, can it be a possible source of\ninformation about events which occurred in the intervening period ?\nBut if it is not a possible source, to what source shall we attribute\nsuch information ? To the telepathic or clairvoyant powers of the\nmedium, or to the agency of non-human spirits ? I see no other\nalternative, since the agency of the dead is ex hyjMhesi excluded.\nYet either step is surely fatal to the whole theory. For once we have\ngranted that by the exercise of telepathic or clairvoyant powers, or\nby the agency of non-human spirits, the medium can supernormally\napprehend an event which happened in 1916, the year after John\nJones died, it appears wanton to invent a wholly different explana-\ntion for her supernormal apprehension of similar events in 1914\nwhen he was still alive. The psychic factor has become, it seems\nto me, an entirely otiose hypothesis.'^\nBut if I reject Dr Broad's interpretation of the evidence furnished\nby psychical research, what interpretation am I to adopt ? In the\nfirst place, where a normal explanation appears possible I shall\ncertainly accept it. I am, however, satisfied that neither chance nor\ncheating, nor any combination of the two, will suffice to account\nfor the whole of the mental phenomena of mediumship. (About the\nphysical phenomena I am less certain ; but these do not in any case\ncome much in question here, since the great majority of them do\n^ Proc, xxxix. 91. A similar analysis of Leonard sittings is a desideratum.\n3 Cf. ibid. p. 173 fi.\n\f156 Professor E. R. Dodds [part\nnot afford even prima facie evidence of survival.^) As regards the\nmental phenomena, my choice is practically confined to three views :\n(ffl) That which attributes them to the exercise by the living of\nsupernormal faculties, viz. telepathy, or a combination of telepathy\nand clairvoyance.\n(6) That which attributes them to the agency of non-human\nspirits.\n(c) That which attributes them to the agency of the surviving\ndead. I will call these respectively the telepathic, the daemonist\nand the spiritualist hypothesis.\nNow if my initial presuppositions are accepted, and my subse-\nquent reasoning is valid, these three hypotheses vary widely in\ntheir antecedent probability. The telepathic hypothesis invokes\nno agency for whose existence there is not strong independent evi-\ndence : the independent evidence for regarding telepathy as a vera\ncausa seems to me almost conclusive,^ and that for clairvoyance\nvery substantial. The daemonist hypothesis has the status of a\nbare unmotived possibility : I know of no valid evidence against\nit, and I cannot agree with Mr Drayton Thomas in calling it far-\nfetched and fanciful \" ; but the only evidence in its favour is\ndrawn from pre-scientific sources to which I can attach little\nweight. The spiritualist hypothesis seems to me, for the reasons\nI have given, to start under the heaviest handicap of the three ;\nnot only is there no valid argument in its favour, but there is a\ndefinite antecedent presumption against it, although this does not\namount to disproof. This being so, an elementary canon of scientific\nmethod requires me to give the preference to the telepathic theory,\nprovided that it adequately covers the phenomena to he explained.\nBut does it cover them adequately ? This is the crucial point of\nthe whole enquiry, and to this I must now address myself.\n1 have made a list\u2014doubtless not exhaustive\u2014of ten objections\nwhich have been advanced against the telepathic hypothesis. Most\nof them were mentioned 12 years ago by Dr W. F. Prince in a paper\nwhich he read at the First International Congress of Psychical\nResearch ;\n* some of the others are taken from Dr Broad's book ^\niQf.

Ill f.\nFor the same reason I have taken no account of \" book-tests or of prevision.\n2\nThe failure of recent experiments in \" mass telepathy \" in no way invali-\ndates earlier evidence obtained under wholly different conditions : it merely\nproves (and the proof is valuable) that the conditions of these expermients\nare unsuitable for provoking the phenomenon.\n3 Proc, xli. 161.\n*\nC'o\u00abyj\/e ife\/irfi\/ Oj\/ZaeZ, Copenhagen 1922, p. 101 If . , . . ..\n5 P. 546 if . , .\n.\n\f]35] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 157\nand from a recent paper of Mr Drayton Thomas's. I proceed to\nconsider them seriatirn.\n(1) It is objected that the telepathic hypothesis does not account\nfor the fact that communications invariably claim to come from\nthe surviving dead.^\nAbout this there are two things to be said. In the first place,\nthe claim in question is by no means invariably made. Prior to\nthe rise of the spiritualist movement in the nineteenth century the\nspirits of the dead were far from enjoying, if we can credit our\ndocuments, any monopoly of the control of mediums : the professed\nsource of the communication was at least as often a non-human\ndaemon or familiar, while in many cases no agency is alleged other\nthan that of the \" seeress \" or \" wise woman \" herself. And even\nto-day the asserted monopoly is not without exceptions. Dr\nOsty, for example, has obtained numerous veridical communications\nboth about the living and about the dead, comparable in range and\naccuracy with those of the best spirit mediums, from a subject, Mme\nMorel, who has no \" controls \" and no \" communicators \" and does\nnot regard the dead as the source of her supernormal knowledge.^\nIt can hardly be doubted that were this lady imbued with the\ncurrent spiritualist convictions her communications would emerge\nfrom the subconscious as orthodox \" spirit messages \".\nFor secondly, if we know anything about the working of the\nsubconscious mind, we know (a) that it is addicted to dramatisation,\nand (6) that its dramas are usually if not always wish-fulfilments :\nboth points are abundantly demonstrated by the study of dreams.\nRemembering further that the great majority of recent mediumships\nhave been developed in a spiritualist environment, and that the great\nmajority of sitters come to mediums not out of scientific curiosity\nbut out of hunger for communion with the dead, I can find nothing\nin the facts here which I should not expect to find on the telepathic\nhypothesis.\n(2) Dr Prince argued in 1921 that the wholesale ascription to\nmediums of telepathic powers was unjustified, since the experimental\nevidence suggested that only a very small minority of human beings\npossessed these powers in any recognisable degree, and there was no\nindependent evidence that any medium possessed them.\nThe force of this argument has since been greatly weakened by\nthe publication of a number of incidents which seem to have their\norigin in telepathy from sitter to medium. Perhaps the most\nstriking of these is the John Ferguson case, published by Mr Soal\n1 Proc, xli. 139 ff.\n^ Cf. e.g. Dr W. F. Prince in Proc, xxxix. 299.\n^ E. Osty, \"\"\nTelepathic Spontanee et Transmission de Pensee Experimen-\ntale,\" Rev. Meiapsychique, 1932-3, pp. 80-3.\n\f158 Professor E. R. Dodds [part\nin Proc, xxxv. The communicator, \" John Ferguson \", was\neventually shown to be a fictitious personality ; but before this\nhappened Mr Soal (the sitter) had privately invented a number of\nhypotheses about \" John Ferguson's \" life and circumstances,\nwhich hypotheses were at subsequent sittings communicated to him\nas facts. This fictitious communicator also made a number of\nveridical references, the source of which could hardly have been\nany other than Mr Soal's mind. Mr Soal has himself mentioned\nthe possibility ^ that the medium (Mrs Blanche Cooper) may have\nbeen assisted in her \" mind-reading \" by unconscious whispering\non the sitter's part. The suggestion lacks proof and requires a\ndeal of stretching to make it cover the facts ^\n;\nyet if the case stood\nalone it might be not unreasonable to discount it on the ground of\nthis suspicion. In fact, however, it by no means stands alone. Dr\nOsty has described numerous instances where different mediums\nhave reproduced beliefs or hypotheses which were present in the\nminds of various sitters, but were subsequently proved to be\nerroneous. 3 It is not easy to suppose that all these sitters (including\nOsty himself) gave themselves away by unconscious whispering or\nother means. Moreover, Osty finds that \" quand on experimente,\nen seances successives et periodiques, avec un menie sujet sur un\nmeme etre eloigne, il est aise de se rendre compte que ce qu'on\napprend sur cet etre entre deux seances permet au sujet, dans la\nseance suivante, de preciser, de rectifier, de developper ses revela-\ntions anterieures.\" * This agrees in principle with Mr Soal's\nexperience ; and it points clearly to telepathy from the sitter.\nNor are incidents of Uke import lacking in the records of Piper\nand Leonard sittings. Thus when Newbold was sitting for auto-\nmatic writing with Mrs Piper, an irrelevant (and rare) name, which\nhe had erroneously associated with the supposed communicator, was\n1 Proc, xl. 177.\n2 It rests primarily on Mr Soal's statement that he possesses \" an exceptional\ntendency to articulate words inaudibly \" (Proc, xxxv. 475). Did the tendency\nmanifest itself at the Cooper sittings ? Mr Soal thinks not, but it is hard to\nbe certain (his bona fdes is naturally not in Ciuestion). Would his inaudible\narticulation convey anything to an experienced lip-reader ? It seems quite\npossible. But what I cannot readily see is how on this hypothesis I am to\nexplain such things as the very indirect yet quite convincing reference to\nthe name \" Paglesham \" (p. 540). I can imagine Mr Soal unconsciously\nanswermg his own question by articulating \" Paglesham \" : but would he\narticulate the ingeniously fantastic description \" where cowslips grow in\ncockle beds \", and the personal allusions which foUow V I permit myself\nto doubt it.\n3\nLa Connaissance Supranorrnale, p. 333 ff. ; Rev. MHapsijchique, 1932-3,\np. 45 ff.\n* La Conn. Sup., p. 206.\n\f135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 159\nreproduced as a spirit utterance in Mrs Piper's script.^ Again, when\nthe experimenter (Hodgson) thinks about Sir Walter Scott, an\nobviously fictitious \" Sir Walter Scott \" communicates next day\nat the Piper sitting ; when he thinks about D. D. Home, a similarly\nspurious \" Home \" presents himself next day.^ In the same way\nMrs Beadon (one of Mrs Leonard's sitters) meets in the street a lady\nwhom she has not seen for twenty-four years, and is thus reminded\nof the lady's brother who died twenty-five years earlier ; at Mrs\nBeadon's next Leonard sitting, a few days later, \" Feda \" refers\nto this man by name and gives identifying details. Mrs Beadon\nstates that she has observed parallel occurrences at many sittings.^\nAgain, Mrs Salter heard one evening in conversation an anecdote\nabout a man who wore several pairs of trousers simultaneously ;\nnext day at a Leonard sitting the control purporting to be Professor\nVerrall remarked to Mrs Salter \" It isn't given to many men to wear\ntwo pairs of trousers. Well. I did once, I think you'll remember.\"\nMrs Salter did not remember.^ Here it looks as if the control\nmistook an anecdote telepathically derived from the sitter's mind for\nan incident in Professor Verrall's life. Again, in the White case\nMiss Nea Walker's erroneous belief as to the circumstances of the\ndeath of the presumed communicator is reflected by \" Feda.\" ^\nThe evidence of such incidents is cumulative. If they are con-\nsidered individually, possible alternative explanations can usually be\ndevised. But collectively they seem to me to enforce the admission\nof telepathy from the sitter as a vera causa. The next step is to try\nto learn something of the conditions and limitations under which\nit operates ; and for this purpose deliberate experiments in tele-\npathically influencing the course of a sitting, on the lines of the\nFerguson case, should in my view be undertaken.^\n1 Proc, xiii. 24, 29 f. Cf. also p. 48 f.\n2 Proc, xxviii. 8.5. ^ Proc, xxxii. 69-72. * Proc, xxxix. 320.\n^ Nea Walker, The Bridge, p. 89. Cf. also Dr Jacks\" Leonard sitting,\nProc, xxxii. 133 ff., where \"\"\nFeda \" seems to have built up a fantasy about\nan imaginary \" spirit \" out of scraps of information telepathically derived\nfrom the sitter. It is worth noting also that Mi's Leonard claims to have\nexperienced in her normal personality at least one veridical hallucination of a\ntype usually assumed to be of telepathic origin {My Life in Two Worlds,\np. 23).\n\u00ae The examples I have collected suggest on the whole that the ideas most\nlikely to be transmitted are those which occupy not the foreground but the\nbackground of the sitter's consciousness. Cf. the difficulty which even the\nbest communicators find in replying to a direct question ; and the remark\nof Flournoy that les idees des assistants qui ont le plus de chance de se\ntransmettre au medium sont ceUes c^ui se trouvent en quelque sorte a I'etat\nnaissant ou evanescent, je veux dire sur la limite entre la conscience et I'incon-\nscience, en train de passer de Tune a I'autre \" {Esprits et Mediums, p. 481).\nThis need not preclude deliberate experiment, but it should be borne in mind\nby experimenters.\n\f160 Professor E. R. Dodds [part\n(3) It is objected that if the telepathic hypothesis is to cover the\nfacts we must credit mediums with the power of drawing on the\ncontents of the minds of living persons quite unknown to them,\nwho are not present at a sitting, and to whom their attention has not\nbeen in any normal way directed. Such an assumption, it is urged,\ngoes far beyond any telepathic feats of which we have independent\nevidence ; and if the phenomenon occurs only in spiritistic conditions\nwe must assume that spiritistic conditions are requisite for its\nproduction.^\nThis objection is more formidable than the last ; and it has been\nbrought into special prominence by the striking successes achieved\nby Mrs Leonard in \" proxy \" sittings. But, like the last, it loses a\ngood deal of its force when we consider some of the incidents pub-\nlished by Dr Osty. These seem to show (a) that correct information\noutside the normal knowledge of all present at the sitting, concerning\nprivate details of the life of absent persons, may be given by sensi-\ntives who do not profess to be assisted by spirits \"\n; (6) that\nincorrect information may be given which corresponds to the\nbelief of a third party who is unknown to the sensitive. Of the\nfirst type a number of instances are given in La Connaissance Supra-\nnormale : e.g. Mme Peyroutet, on being asked by Osty to describe\nthe past life of the person of whom he was thinking, furnished\nnumerous details of a highly individual character which were quite\nunknown to Osty but were subsequently attested as correct by\nintimate friends of the person in question.-' The circumstances\nhere are analogous to those of a \" proxy \" sitting with Mrs Leonard,\nsave that the being whose past is disinterred is a living being and\nnot a dead one. The second type is exemplified in the case of the\npretended Grand-Duchess Anastasia. Here the sensitive (Mme\nMorel), on being presented by Osty with a letter written by the real\nGrand-Duchess and a flower which had been handled by the pre-\ntender, had a series of visions which corresponded neither with the\nobjective facts as subsequently verified nor with the impressions\nin Osty's mind, but with the fictitious story told by the pretender\n\u2014\na story which we are assured was at the time unknown to Mme Morel\nand only partially known to Osty.^\nOsty is not the only investigator who has obtained results of this\nsort without the professed aid of spirits. Andrew Lang pointed out\nmany years ago, a propos of the Piper controversy,* that Miss Angus's\ncrystal-gazing experiments afford strong prima facie evidence of an\nindependent character that \" third-party \" telepathy (to use a con-\n1 Cf. Mr Thomas in Proc, xli. 161 ; and Prince, op. cit., p. 112 S.\n2 p. 148 ff. * Rev. Metapsychique, 1932-3, pp. 52-7.\n\u00bb Proc, XV. 48 if.\n\f135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 161\nvenient phrase) really is a vera causa. On one occasion, for example,\n\" Miss Angus described doings from three weeks to a fortnight old,\nof people in India, people whom she has never seen or heard of, but\nwho were known to her '\nsitter '\n,\n\" in circumstances which appear to\npreclude explanation by collusion or coincidence or telepathy from\nthe sitter. Yet neither in this nor in any other of Miss Angus's ex-\nperiments is there any suggestion of the direct or indirect agency of\nthe dead. A spiritualist interpretation might, I suppose, be forced\nupon these cases and upon Osty's : it is certainly not the natural one.\nStill less is a spiritualist interpretation applicable to the messages\nwhich Mr Soal received through Mrs Cooper from a supposedly\ndeceased Gordon Davis\u2014who subsequently proved to be alive and\nwell at Southend.^ Apart from the apparent element of prevision\nwhich it contains, this puzzling case seems to be susceptible of two,\nand only two, rational explanations. One is that the source of the\nmessages was the subconscious mind of Mr Soal : this requires us to\nassume a considerable, but perhaps not impossible, amount of\ncryptomnesia on Mr Soal's part. The other is that the source was\nthe subconscious mind of Mr Davis\u2014a person who was quite un-\nknown to the medium,^ who was a good many miles distant at the\ntime of the sittings, and to whom the medium's attention had not\nbeen in any normal way directed.\nOn the whole, I feel obliged to conclude that third-party telepathy,\nif it cannot be regarded as an established phenomenon, has consider-\nably more than the status of a bare hypothesis. The independent\nevidence in its support is not very abundant, but it is not negligible.\nIts paucity need surprise no one who remembers (\u00ab) that in everyday\nlife instances of long-distance telepathy from complete strangers,\nif they occur, are very unlikely to be recognised ;\n{b) that in this\ncountry at any rate a \" sitting \" practically always means an attempt\nto obtain communications not from the absent living but from\nthe dead. The remedy for the latter circumstance lies in our own\nhands.\n(4) It is objected that the vivid presentation in trance of a\npersonality normally unknown to the medium is not adequately\nexplained save on the spiritualist hypothesis. Mr Salter has\nrecently mentioned this along with the last objection, as two of the\nthree chief stumbling blocks in the way of the telepathic theory ;\n^\nand Mr Thomas lays great stress on it.\nTo this contention there are two possible rejoinders. In the first\nj)lace, sceptics may doubt, and have in fact doubted, whether in\n1 Proc, XXXV., 560 ff.\n- If she had made secret inquiries about Mr Davis she could not have failed\nto learn that he was alive.\n^ Journ., xxvii. 331.\n\f162 Professor E. R. Dodds [part\nthe circumstances of a sitting such \" vivid presentation of a per-\nsonality \" ever has substantial value as evidence of identity. They\npoint out that when the tones of the trance speech are recognised by\nthe sitter as those of a familiar voice, or when certain mannerisms\nor fa^ons de fader are felt by him to be characteristic of a certain\nperson, it is very rarely possible to check the objectivity of the\nrecognition, as can usually be done when a name, a date or an event\nis in question. The door is commonly left wide open to the insidious\ntemptations of the will-to-believe\u2014temptations whose potency in\nthis context can be fully realised only by those who have either been\nsitters themselves or made an impartial study of the annotated\nrecords of sittings.\nBut secondly, whether evidence of this type has much or little\nvalue, there is some reason to think that certain mediums can on\noccasion \" reproduce \" the personalities of the unknown living with,\nas much success as those of the unknown dead. At any rate, Dr\nOsty tells us that one of his sensitives. Mile de Berly, is capable of\n\" reproducing approximately the timbre and rhythm \" of the voice\nof persons living or dead whom she has never heard speak, of \" saying:\nwhat they might say or might have said \", and of \" exhibiting their\ncustomary attitudes.\" ^ One would have liked more detailed\nevidence about these remarkable powers of Mile de Berly\u2014but in.\ndefault thereof it is worth while to look again at the Davis case. The\ncommunicator in that case spoke, in Mr Soal's opinion, with a voice\nand accent closely resembling Davis's\u2014so closely that early in the\nfirst sitting Mr Soal was impelled to cry out \" By Jove, and it's like-\nGordon Davis !\n\" Moreover, the communicator reproduced so\nsuccessfully a number of Davis's mannerisms that Gordon Davis-\nhimself later agreed, when shown the record of the sittings, that it-\nwas very like Gordon Davis. Nevertheless it wasn't Gordon Davis.\nIt wasn't Gordon Davis unless you are prepared to assume that-\nhe could simultaneously interview a client at Southend and con-\nverse with Soal in London through the lips of Mrs Cooper. Person-\nally I find this assumption more staggering than any which is\ninvolved in the telepathic hypothesis ; and I must therefore con-\nclude that the latter hypothesis is not invalidated by the recog-\nnised reproduction of such personal characteristics as voice, accent\nand idiom.\n^\n^ La Connaismnce Supranormale, 252.\n^ It is immaterial to the argument whether we suppose the impersonation\nto have been based on material telepatliically derived, either from Mr Soal\nor from Mr Davis himself, or on the other hand simply assume that both Mr'\nSoal and Mr Davis were victims of the will-to-believe. The point is that a\nvivid impression of Davis's personal presence was produced on a highly\nintelligent observer in circumstances which make it incredible that he was\nin any sense really present.\n\f135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 163\n(5) A further objection to the telepathic hypothesis is\nthat it appears to involve an otherwise unexampled selective\naction of the medium's mind, in supernormally deriving\nfrom other' human minds precisely those remembered facts\nwhich are required for the building up of a particular trance\npersonaUty. This was the spear-head of Hyslop's argument for\nthe spiritualist interpretation of the Piper phenomena, and has\noften been urged since.\nBut I do not think that the available evidence in the least requires\nme to picture the subconscious mind of the medium hunting through\nthe subconscious mind of the assumed agent, as through a lumber-\nroom, until it finds precisely the bit of information which it needs\nin order to give verisimilitude to its impersonation of some deceased\nfriend of the agent. I am equally free to imagine that when\nrapport is established between the medium's subconscious mind and\nthat of the assumed agent, the nature of the material transmitted is\ndetermined by the relative emotive force of the agent's various\ncomplexes, or by the fact that the material belongs to an associative\ncomplex some elements of which are already in the medium's mind,\nor by any other cause that you like to suggest. Selection does\nundoubtedly operate at some stage before the material is presented\nin trance ; but I see nothing to prevent its operating after the\nmaterial has become part of the furniture of the medium's sub-\nconscious mind. I am free to imagine, in the first place, that the\nparticular complex of feelings and images which underlies a par-\nticular trance personality attracts to itself only such elements of\nthe newly acquired material as have some associative relevance to\nits existing content ; and secondly, that the \" control \" who sits in\nthe gateway of trance\u2014Feda or Topsy, Phinuit or Rector\u2014operates\non occasion, like the Freudian \" censor \", to prevent the emergence\nof irrelevant or disturbing matter which might interrupt the illusion\nand break the continuity of the medium's dream.^ These are no\nmore than guesses, although they derive a certain amount of support\nfrom the known mechanism of the normal dream. I claim no more\nfor them than that they cover the observed facts as well as any other\nhypothesis, and better in one important respect than the hypothesis\nof possession. The degree of relevance and continuity to be\nobserved in most trance communications is, to say the least, ex-\ntremely limited. In Mr Saltmarsh's words, \" one of the most\nstriking features of communications received through trance\n1 Cf. a remark of the acting control\" in one of Mr Thomas's Leonard\nsittings : \"If she [a certain communicator] tells me anything that disagrees\nwith what she told me previously, I shall have to inform her that, in this\nconfusing condition of the sitting, she is not recollecting clearly Proc,\nxli. 175.\nL\n\f164 Professor E. R. Dodds [part\nmediums is their disj ointedness \" This is what I should expect from\nthe sort of psychological machinery I have suggested ; it is not what\nI should expect if the communicators are what they say they are.\n(6) A further objection to the telepathic hypothesis is that it fails\nto account for certain cases of \" object-reading \" (popularly called\n\" psychometry \"). The cases in question are those where a relic\nis submitted to an entranced medium, its ownership and history\nbeing unknown both to her and to the sitter, and she nevertheless\nfurnishes correct details about its present or former owner. These\npuzzling occurrences have been most fully studied by Osty in La\nConnaissance Supranormale, by Prince and Pagenstecher in Proc.\nAmer. S.P.R., xv. and xvi., and by Mr Saltmarsh in his report on\nMrs Warren Elliott.\nThey are, it seems to me, puzzling occurrences on any hypothesis.\nThe notion that the relic in some unimaginable way carries a per-\nmanent record of its own history, which the medium is able to read,\nis definitely put out of court by the fact that much of the information\nsupernormally obtained in such cases refers to scenes in which the\nrelic played no part whatever.\" It apparently functions not as a\nrecord but as a signpost pointing to some mind, living or dead,\nwhence the information is then supernormally derived. How is this\nfunction exercised ? On the telepathic theory, the source of the\ninformation will be a living mind, usually and perhaps always that\nof the contributor of the relic ; but I do not know how the presence\nof a watch or a purse creates a rapport between the medium's mind\nand that of the contributor. Equally, on the spiritualist view, I do\nnot know how the presence of a material object causes the particular\nspirit which once owned that object to present itself to two strangers\nat a particular time and place. Are we to imagine the spirit, in the\nWarren Elliott experiments, following its relic from the house of\nthe contributor to 31 Tavistock Square, and vigilantly haunting the\nS.P.R. rooms from the day of the relic's arrival until the day when\nchance determined that this particular relic should be removed, still\nin its wrappings, and without the contributor's knowledge, from the\nlocked cupboard and conveyed to the sitting ? or if not this, what\nare we to imagine, short of crediting the dead with omniscience ? I\ncan only echo Driesch's remark that object-reading is \" the most\nmysterious and inexplicable of all supernormal phenomena \".\nIt seems worth while, however, to mention an analogous incident\nwhich occurred in the Sinclair telepathy experiments, and to which\nMrs Sidgwick called attention in her review of Mental Radio.

Mrs\nSinclair later picked up the envelopes in succession and tried to\nreproduce the contents without opening them. Now on one occasion\nthe secretary included in his batch two drawings which were not by\nhim but by a person unknown to Mrs Sinclair. On picking up the\nenvelope containing the first of these draw'ings, Mrs Sinclair gave a\ndescription which did not apply to the drawing in question, but did\nvery accurately apply to the stranger's other drawing, which came\nseven places further on in the series. It looks on the face of it as if\nthe handling of the stranger's first envelope had somehow served to\nestablish telepathic rapport between Mrs Sinclair's mind and the\nstranger's. If so, we have here another case of the directive in-\nfluence of the relic ;\nonly here the\n'\n' relic\n'\n' has no association with\nthe dead, and the dead do not profess to co-operate in the achieve-\nment of the result. No solid argument can be based on a single\ninstance ; but I suggest that it is desirable to carry out further\nexperiments on these lines both with Mrs Sinclair and with Mrs\nElliott.\nAnother parallel in a non-spiritist context is furnished by certain\nof the feats attributed to the Polish amateur clairvoyant M. Osso-\nwiecki, who makes no claim to the assistance of \" spirits \".^ Hand-\nhng, for example, a sealed letter whose authorship and contents\nwere not normally known either to him or to Geley (the only other\nperson present), he stated correctly, among other things, the age of\nthe writer and also that of the writer's wife (who was mentioned in\nthe letter).^ These facts were not given or implied in the letter ;\nthey were not (apparently) known to Geley, who in any case could\nnot be normally aware of their relevance to the letter ; and the\nexperiment had no connection with any deceased person. We\nseem reduced here to a choice between two explanations\u2014an un-\nlikely coincidence, or \" third-party telepathy mediated by a\nmaterial object.\n(7) It is further objected that the amount and quality of the\nveridical information given varies not with changes of sitter but with\nchanges of communicator\u2014which is the contrary of what we\nshould expect on the telepathic hypothesis.\nThe evidence on this point is not so abundant as one could wish,\nsince most sitters always evoke the same communicator, and most\n1 For his interpretation of his own powers see G. Geley, UEctopias mie et\nla Clairvoyance, 72 ff.\n^ Geley, oj). cit., 35 f.

Doclds [part\ncommunicators always manifest themselves in response to the appeal\nof the same sitter or group of closely associated sitters. Mr Thomas\nclaims that in a set of \" proxy \" sittings recently studied by him\nthis difficulty is removed, since the actual sitter (Mr Thomas) was\nthe same throughout the series, while there were 24 different\ncommunicators : he thinks that \" it may therefore be assumed\nwith some confidence \" that variations in the veridicality of the\ncommunications depend on variations in the ability of the com-\nmunicators. I cannot myself feel any such confidence. In 20 of\nthese 24- cases the experiment was originated by the relatives of the\nalleged communicator, who were in many instances not personally\nknown to Mr Thomas ; and I gather that the bulk of the facts\ncorrectly given at these sittings were unknown to Mr Thomas at the\ntime when they were given. It follows that on the telepathic\nhypothesis the ultimate source of the information about these facts\nis to be sought in the minds of the surviving relatives ; and each\ncommunicator had apparently a distinct set of relatives. We are\nthus landed back in our old difficulty : when the communicator\nchanges, the possible telepathic sources of relevant information\nchange too, and variations in the veridicality of the communications\ncan be equally well ascribed to the variation of either factor.\nIt is, however, a fact, as Hodgson pointed out, that some com-\nmunicators, such as Mrs Piper's \" George Pelham \", have been\nsuccessful with a number of different sitters, while others have\nconsistently failed with a variety of sitters. This is perhaps most\neasily explained on the spiritualist hypothesis. But other explana-\ntions are not impossible : e.cj. that the dream figure called \" George\nPelham \" emerged from a deeper stratum of Mrs Piper's subconscious\nmind than the dream figure called \" Stainton Moses \", and was\ntherefore more accessible to impressions telepathically received.\nAnd there is on the other side a fact which tells, so far as it goes, in\nfavour of the telepathic hypothesis, namely that while some sitters\nconsistently fail, others receive veridical information from a number\nof different communicators : Mr Soal and Mr Thomas himself are\ncases in point. My general conclusion is that little weight can be\nattached to objection 7.\n(8) In the paper already mentioned Mr Thomas advances a series\nof objections which may be summarised in the statement that in\nthese 24 cases there was no observable correlation between the\nsuccess or failure of a sitting and the presence or absence of condi-\ntions which Mr Thomas considers favourable to telepathy.\nI am afraid that the answer to this is that we know next to nothing\nabout the conditions favourable to telepathy. I do not know which\nof Mr Thomas's cases were \" likely cases \" for telepathy, though Mr\nThomas apparently does. There are only two things that I can say\n\f135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 167\n(and those not very confidently), (a) Other things being equal,\ntelepathy is probably more likely to occur when agent and percipient\nare in the same room than when they are miles apart.^ This test\ncannot be applied to Mr Thomas's cases, since in none of them was\nthe presumed agent present at the sitting. But in the Warren\nElliott series studied by Mr Saltmarsh, which included 53 ordinary\nsittings and 89 of the \" Absent Sitter \" type, the percentage of\nveridicality in the former class was found to be quite double what\nit was in the latter ; and a number of individual communicators who\nwere successful when their surviving relatives were present at the\nsitting were complete failures at sittings where they were absent.^\n(b) Other things being equal, an \" absent sitter \" who is personally\nknown to the actual sitter is probably better situated as a telepathic\nagent than one who is unknown both to the actual sitter and to the\nmedium. This personal link existed in 12 out of Mr Thomas's 24\ncases. The basis is far too narrow for confident generalisation ; but\nit is at least noteworthy that the three best cases are \" personal\nlink \" cases. The fact that five of the remaining \" personal link\n\"\ncases were inconclusive or failures does not, pace Mr Thomas, logically\ninvalidate the possible inference that the existence of such a link is a\ncondition required for the attainment of the highest degree of\nsuccess ; it merely proves that it is not the sole condition.\n(9) It is further objected that the telepathic hypothesis does not\nsatisfactorily account for cross-correspondences, in so far as these\nexhibit evidence of conscious design. This is Mr Salter's third\nstumbling-block.\nThis objection leads me on to the most thorny and difficult ground\nin the whole field of psychical research\u2014ground which I could not\npossibly attempt to traverse in detail at the end of a long paper even\nif I felt myself adequately equipped for the task. All that I can do\nis to state the general impression which the evidence produces upon\nme, without demanding that others should acquiesce in my con-\nclusion\u2014or rather, in my absence of conclusions. For there are to\nmy mind two points in which the evidence of cross-correspondences\nis inconclusive. In the first place, I cannot quite convince myself\nthat in demonstrating pattern or coherence Mr Piddington and other\ninvestigators have conclusively demonstrated design. The patterns\nare there, and I do not suggest that their occurrence is in all or even\nin most cases due to chance. But suppose we posit that an unde-\nsigned telepathic infiltration from time to time takes place between\nthe subconscious minds of certain automatists. What chiefly then\n^ Cf. the Brighton experiments {Proc. vi. 156 f., viii. 544) and the Usher-\nBurt series (Annahs des Sciences Psychiques, xx. 14-21, 40-54).\n- Proc, xxxix. 90 ff., 106 f. It is to be hoped that a similar comparison\nof Leonard sittings will one day be undertaken. ^\n\f168 Professor E. R. Dodds [part\nremains to be explained is {a) why the same idea frequently emerges\nin two automatists' scripts not in identical but in complementary\nforms ; (6) why tlie emergence of a common idea is occasionally\naccompanied in the script by some such note as \" seek elsewhere for\nthis \". I cannot feel that either of these peculiarities affords really\nclear evidence of design.\n(a) As Pigou pointed out in 1909, \" complementariness \" occurred\nwithout design in a famous telepathic experiment in which Mrs\nVerrall was the percipient.^ And. to quote a more recent example,\nwhen the agent txied to make Professor Murray think of Sir Francis\nDrake drinking the health of the Elizabethan mutineer Doughty,\nwhat emerged was \" a faint feeling of Arabia or desert.\" ^ In a\ncross-correspondence this would have been called a very neat\nexample of disguised allusion. Again, Osty has recently pointed out\nthat in the majority of cases of spontaneous telepathy (phantasms\nof the dying, etc.) \" la representation mentale de I'evenement se fait\npar images symboliques, allegoriques, et souvent elle est fragmen-\ntaire. Les choses se passent comme si le plan cryptique d'intelli-\ngence qui prend paranormalement connaissance de I'evenement\nlointain ne voulait pas le presenter a I'ordinaire conscience.\" ^ Does\nnot this observation adequately account for the much admired\nobscurity of our cross-correspondences ? We should expect them,\nit seems to me, on the telepathic theory, to be just what they are\u2014\noblique, allusive, and couched in phrases and images which are\nlinked not by logical coherence but by emotional associations.\nThese are in fact the common characteristics of subconscious\nproducts, as exemplified in many normal dreams.\n(6) It seems not impossible that the consciousness which produces\nthe script can sometimes distinguish from the general mass of\n1 The \" One-Horse Dawn\" case (Proc, xx. 156-67, 387-94 ; xxv. 109-11).\nMr Piddington subsequently endeavoured to sliow that this case involved\nsomething more than telepathy between the living (Proc, xxx. 175-229,\n296-305 ; xxxiv. 159-65) ; but I find the attemj)t more ingenious than con-\nvincing. I cannot feel that he has proved, or come within measurable distance\nof proving, that a reference to Jebb's note on Oedipus Tyrannus, 846, was\nintended by the intelligence responsible for the scripts. But secondly, if\nthis were proved up to the hilt, there would be no reason, so far as I can\nsee, for attributing the reference to any other source than the subconscious\nmind of Mrs Verrall. That she may have read, and jDrobably had read, the\nnote in question is not disputed (Proc, xxx. 214). That upon subsequent\nstudy of her own scripts she failed to recognise the alleged reference does not\nsurprise me at all ; but it need not have surprised even Mr Piddington very\nmuch, in view of what psychoanalysis has taught us about the great strength\nand the apparent arbitrariness of subconscious resistances.\n2 Proc, xxiv. 231.\n^ Rev.

This is supported by the case of Miss Samuels, who could\nusually distinguish the undesigned telepathic impressions received\nfrom Mr Wales both from those she received from Mr Fuller and\nfrom her own endogenous dreams or day dreams.\n^\nI am not wholly satisfied, therefore, that the cross-correspon-\ndences are the result of design. But, secondly, even if they are, I\nknow of no conclusive answer to the suggestion put forward by\nMangin, Broad and others, that the design of most of those hitherto\npublished may have originated in the subconscious mind of Mrs\nVerrall. It is certainly true that more difficult intellectual feats\nthan the construction of these puzzles have before now been per-\nformed subconsciously ;\nthat Mrs Verrall possessed just the sort of\nliterary and linguistic knowledge which would be required for their\nconstruction ; and that in all the more learned and elaborate of the\npublished cross-correspondences her script played a prominent part.\nWe shall be in a better position, however, to estimate the value of\nthis theory when fuller information is available about the later work\nof the S.P.R. group of automatists.\n(10) It remains to say a word about an objection which though\ndemonstrably invalid is more frequent than any other on the lips\nof the uncritical. The spiritualist hypothesis, people say, is \"so\nsimple \", the telepathic \" so complicated \".\nIf this means merely that the spiritualist explanation is more\neasily grasped by the unthinking, the statement is true, but irrele-\nvant. We do not prefer Newton's picture of the physical world to\nEinstein's because it is more easily apprehended. If it is meant, on\nthe other hand, that the spiritualist hypothesis is in the scientific\nsense simpler, the statement is relevant, but false. To a scientist,\nI take it, the simplest hypothesis is that which makes no assumption\nunsupported by independent evidence ; the next simplest is that\nwhich makes the fewest and narrowest unsupported assumptions.\nNow the telepathic hypothesis assumes ^ that mediums possess a\nsupernormal faculty for whose reality there is substantial indepen-\ndent evidence ; and it assumes further that they possess it in a\ndegree for which there is a slight amount of independent evidence.\nThe spiritualist hypothesis assumes\n(1) that many, if not all, human personalities survive bodily\ndeath ;\n(2) that they retain an accurate memory of many details in\ntheir past lives ;\n^ Proc, xxxi. 124 \u00a3f.\n^ In this comparison I have taken no account of the facts discussed in\nconnection with objection 6, which seem equally obscure on either hypothesis.\n\f170 Professor E. R. Dodds [part-\n(3) that they have a detailed awareness of many physical events\nwhich have occurred among the living since their death ;\n(4) that they have in some cases access to the unspoken\nthoughts of the living ;\n(5) that they can at times communicate with the living, either-\nby direct use of the organism of a medium or by telepathi-\ncally influencing the medium's subconscious mind ;\n(6) that the unspoken wish of a living mind is in some cases\nsufficient to initiate this relationship between a particular-\ndeceased person and a particular medium.\nThese are I think the minimum assumptions which will cover the\nphenomena I have been considering. If the hypothesis is used, as\nmost of its advocates use it, to explain also book tests, newspaper\ntests, and the whole range of physical phenomena, a large number of\nadditional assumptions are involved. Thus, far from being simple,\nthe spiritualist hypothesis is hydraheaded. It is in fact not one\nhypothesis at all, but a series of hypotheses, of such a character that\nno later member of the series is a necessary, or so far as our know-\n'\nledge goes a probable, consequence of an earlier member. If the dead\nsurvive, there is no positive probability that they will remember\ndetails of their past lives ; if they survive and remember the past,\nthere is no positive probability that they will be aware of terrestrial\nevents after their death ; and so forth. Whatever advantages the\nspiritualist view possesses, simplicity in the scientific sense is not one\nof them.\nI have now considered all the objections known to me which seem\nto me to have a prima facie claim to consideration. To sum up my\nconclusions, objections 1, 5, 7, 8 and 10 appear to me to have little or\nno cogency ;\nindeed, all of them are capable of being turned against\ntheir advocates. Objections, 2, 3 and 4 are to a considerable extent\ninvalidated by evidence obtained under conditions which appear to\nexclude spirit agency. Objection 9 I am obliged to write off as\ninconclusive, for the reasons I have briefly mentioned. Finally,\nobjection 6 calls attention to a set of phenomena which I cannot\nsatisfactorily explain to myself on any theory.\nUntil, then, some stronger objection emerges, I must grant that\nthe telepathic hypothesis covers the evidence as well on the whole\nas any other ; and since it is the minimum hypothesis which does so,\nit commands my provisional acceptance. Until this conclusion is\nupset, I must regard survival as unproved ; and I have stated my\nreasons for thinking that survival of the kind postulated by spiritua-\nlists, though not impossible, is antecedently improbable. It is in\nthis sense that I do not believe in survival.\nI must add that the two current forms of the spiritualist hypo-\nthesis\u2014the theory of telepathy from the dead and the theory of\n\f135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 171\npossession\u2014seem to me to differ widely in their evidential status.\nAgainst the former no conclusive objection has been drawn, or is\nhkely to be drawn, from the trance phenomena, for the excellent\nreason that we know nothing at all about the conditions which might\ngovern this kind of telepathy. Against direct possession there is\nevidence which I find insuperable. It has been presented by Mrs\nSidgwick in her two masterly papers on the Piper phenomena ;\ni\nand it is not necessary here to do more than recall its general charac-\nter. The main points are the shiftiness displayed even by highly\nveridical communicators like \" George Pelham \" ;\n2 their confident\nstatements in cases where they can hardly fail to know that they are\nlying ;\nthe habitual lameness of their attempts to answer direct\nquestions ;\nand above all their acceptance of bogus personalities as\ngenuine spirits (e.g. \" George Pelham \" guaranteed the authenticity\nof\" Phmuit \", \" Hodgson \" upheld the objective reality of a \" Bessie\nBeals \" whom Hall had invented, \" Frank Soal \" described \"\nJohn\nFerguson \" as a spirit, and none of Mrs Leonard's communicators,\nso far as I know, has given \" Feda \" away). These facts are not\nmcompatible with telepathy from the dead ; but I do not know how\nto reconcile them with the theory of direct possession, although I\nhave read many attempts to do so.\nThere are other considerations, of a sufficiently obvious kind\nwhich tend to discredit all forms of the spiritualist hypothesis, but\ntell most definitely against the theory of possession. It is, I think\nfair to say that the \" spirits \" have so far failed to convey to us any\ndistinctive impression of their present mode of life, their occupations,\nor their state of mind ;\nand that they have never explained this\nfailure. How comes it that these countless Columbuses, returnin<^\nto us (if but for an hour) from the supreme voyage of discovery''\ndescribe the life beyond the tomb in terms that are equally applicable\nto life m Putney, or alternatively, are borrowed from cheap theo-\nsophical literature ? ^ Can the vivid literary talent of a Verrall or\nthe philosophic insight of a Myers do no more than this ^\nAnd why in\ngeneral, do the \" spirits \" of intellectually gifted persons produce\nno evidence that they retain their gifts in the other world ?

[pabt\nof information whicli they have adduced in support of their claims\nto identity. In other words, we have treated them almost exactly\nas we would treat the claimant to a dukedom, if we had no finger-\nprints or Bertillon measurements of the true, but missing, heir. In\nparticular, we have not hitherto been able to apply those processes\nof Measure and Calculation which alone characterise the transition\nfrom speculative enquiry to exact Science.^\nThe object of the researches here described has been to explore the\npossibilities of substituting anthropometrical ^ for legal methods and\nof bringing the personaUties concerned out of the witness-box and\ninto the laboratory.\n2\nThe general method adopted has been that of the Word Associa-\ntion Test, use being made, according to circumstances, of the Psycho-\ngalvanic Reflex, the Reaction Time, and Disturbances in Repro-\nduction, as indicators of the effects produced by the stimulus words.\nMany readers are doubtless already familiar with this test ; but\nI must devote a few paragraphs to it for the benefit of those who are\nnot.\nIn principle, the procedure is simple enough. The experimenter\ntakes a list of quite ordinary words, such as are met with in everyday\nlife and calls them out, one by one, to the subject, who is preferably\nseated comfortably in such a position that he cannot see what is\ngoing on. The rules of the game are that the subject shall respond,\nas quicJdy as possible, with thefirst word suggested by the word called\nout. This sounds almost too easy to be informative, but certain\ncomplications are involved which may throw considerable light on\nthe psychological make-up of the person under test.\nFor instance, the first word suggested may be too embarrassing to\nutter, so that it must be replaced by something innocuous ; or what we\nmay call purely intellectual difliculties may arise ; or the subject may\nhesitate between one reply and another. In any of these cases the\ntime elapsing between calling out the word and receiving the reply\n\u2014\nknown as the Reaction Time\u2014will be longer than the normal, and\nthis will be an indication that the word has some special significance\nfor the subject.\nMore generally, we may say with Jung\u2014the adoptive father of\nthe technique\u2014that the calling out of any word is equivalent to\nconfronting the subject \" in miniature \" with all the situations in\nhis experience in which the referent and connotations of that word\nhave played a part.\nThis is so evidently true that I need not labour the point here ;\nand it is, I think, equally clear that we have in this method, in\n1 See Appendix III, pp. 220-240, for Technical Notes, to which this and other\nnumbers in the text refer.\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 175\nprinciple at least, a means of distingiiisliing personalities by a\nsubstantially direct examination of their psychological content.\nFor the experience of no two people is the same, and it is this\nexperience which gives connotational significance to the words ;\nso that a standard list will be differently accented, so to speak, for\neach individual and comparison of the accentuations should enable\nus to distinguish one individual from another.\nMoreover, since reaction times and psychogalvanic reflexes can\nbe measured, and disturbances in reproduction can be counted, we\nhave, what is all important, a means of obtaining metrical attributes\nof the personalities\u2014the psychological analogues of Bertillon\nmeasurements\u2014to which mathematical treatment generally and\nthe methods of statistical analysis in particular can readily be\napplied.\n3\nNow it has been shown up to the hilt\n\u2014\ne.g. by Jung and Bleuler ^\n\u2014\nthat the replies given and the reaction times, etc., observed in the\ncourse of the word association test are not determined only by those\nstored experiences, which we call memories, that are easily accessible\nto consciousness, but also by other factors\n\u2014\" complexes \" and the\nlike\u2014lying deep in the subconscious or the unconscious.* This,\nindeed, stands to reason and we have only to study dreams intelli-\ngently, or read such a book as Freud's Psychopathologij of Everyday\nLife, to realise how true it is that oxir most superficial actions, our\nmost apparently inconsequent psychological formulations, are\ninfluenced by the deepest constituents of our beings and not only\nby those we can recognise.\nThis is, of course, very relevant to the whole subject of multiple\npersonality in the ordinary pathological sense, and this in turn is\nclosely connected with our present discussion.\nIn many such pathological cases we know, and in many others we\nhave no reason to doubt, that the secondary personality shares a\ncommon subconscious with the primary and is, therefore, no more\nthan the same \" psyche \"\n\u2014if I may be allowed the term\u2014mas-\nquerading in unfamiliar guise. It is, indeed, only this knowledge\u2014\n\u2014or justiflable inference from analogy, as the case may be\u2014that\nentitles us to speak of the two or more superficially different per-\nsonalities as being \" really \" the same. Otherwise, we should be\nprejudging the whole central problem which has perplexed observers\never since the first hysteric was judged to be possessed of a devil.\nAgain, it has been shown\n\u2014\ne.g. by Prideaux and others\u2014that in\ncases of functional amnesia words which were of emotional signi-\nficance in the forgotten part of life arouse abnormally large reactions\nwhen apphed to the amnesic patient.\n\f176 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nIn view of these facts and others like them, we should confidently\nexpect that the various personalities of any manifold\u2014if I may\nadopt a convenient term\u2014would show substantially identical, or at\nleast significantly similar, reactions when tested in this way.\nThis view is supported by some experiments of Prince and\nPeterson in the EGA case as long ago as 1908.^ Using the psycho-\ngalvanic reflex as indicator, with the early technique due to Tar-\nchanov, they succeeded in eliciting in personality A reactions of\nabnormal size, in response to test words relevant to one of B's\ndreams of which A had no conscious knowledge.\nIt follows from the foregoing that if the personalities of mediumis-\ntic trance are really no more than secondary personalities of the\nmedium, as classical psychology would have us suppose, and if\ncurrent theories of multiple personality are correct, then we ought\nto obtain from the supposed Control or \" communicator \" sub-\nstantially the same reactions as those given by the medium in the\nnormal state. If we do not, and if the difl^erence is greater than can\nreasonably be attributed to chance, then we must conclude that one\nor other of these provisos needs revision ; that is to say, either the\nControls are not mere secondaries, or our psychological theories of\nmultiple personahty must be overhauled.\nThe general plan, then, is to take a number of sets of reactions\nto a given list of words from the normal personality and an equal\nnumber of sets from the trance personality, to compare the two\naggregates of figures so obtained, and to calculate the probability\nthat any resemblance or difference between them has arisen by\nchance alone\u2014that is, by the operation of all those uncontrolled\nand unknown factors which, taken together, we call Error.\nThis last part of the procedixre is, in an important sense, the most\nindispensable of all ;\nfor, strictly speaking, no result is worth\nanything until we know just how much it is worth.\n4\nI first suggested this method as far back as 1921, when I showed,\nusing the psychogalvanic reflex and a correlational method of\ncomputation, that it was possible to distinguish normal people from\neach other and to identify them with themselves on different\noccasions by these means.\u00ae\nBut the honour (if honour it prove to be, as I hope it may) of\nhaving first attempted to apply the technique to the mediumistic\ntrance goes to my near-namesake Mr Hereward Carrington, who is\nwell known to students of Psychical Research and is now Director\nof the recently formed American Psychical Institute. In 1932 and\n1933 he carried out, unknown to me, a series of tests with Mrs Eileen\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 177\nGarrett and her Control \" Uvani \" (whom I have also studied) and\nthe results were published in the first Bulletin of the Institute\nmentioned. The fact that these results were not at all conclusive,\nas was at first supposed by himself and by certain uncritical en-\nthusiasts, has been in no way his fault but must be attributed\nentirely to ignorance of the psychological, physical and mathe-\nmatical technicalities involved, on the part of those on whose\nassistance he relied. It is only fair to emphasise this here in view\nof the criticism to which the work in question must elsewhere be\nsubjected. After all we do not blame, but rather praise, a pioneer\naviator who succeeds in getting only to Newfoundland and not to\nFlorida, if he has been provided with an unreliable compass, a\ntwisted drift-sight and a misprinted Nautical Almanack.\nThis seems a convenient point at which to acknowledge most\ngratefully my own contrasting indebtedness to those who have\nhelped me in the work I am about to describe.\nFirst, of course, there are the three mediums, Mrs Garrett, Herr\nRudi Schneider and Mrs Osborne Leonard, on whom the tests were\nmade. Next the various Controls and \" communicators \" them-\nselves, for, whatever their psychological status may ultimately prove\nto be, they have been uniformly obliging in this matter.\nI am also greatly indebted to Mr Theodore Besterman for collect-\ning the data for me in the cases of Mrs Garrett and of Ptudi Schneider\nand, particularly, for suggesting that I should make a study of the\nlatter as an integral part of the work being done on his mediumship\nas a whole.\nIn the case of Mrs Leonard I am under a deep obligation to Mr\nDrayton Thomas, not only for performing the same somewhat\ntiresome function, but also for most generously devoting a large\nnumber of his private sittings to the research and for enlisting the\ninvaluable co-operation of his two \" communicating controls.\" Mr\nBesterman, in his capacity of Investigation Ofiicer to this Society,\nmight almost be described as a professional chaser of the wild-goose\neggs found in mares' nests, and is correspondingly inured to every\nform of thankless and wearisome investigation\u2014though this, of\ncourse, in no way detracts from the value of his work here ; but Mr\nDrayton Thomas is well known as a convinced, if critical, supporter\nof the spiritistic view of these phenomena, and I think, if I may say\nso without impertinence, that it speaks volumes for the genuineness\nof his scientific outlook that he should so willingly have begun and\nso enthusiastically have continued a long and tedious research\u2014\na\nresearch which he must have thought at best superfluous and one\nwhich might quite possibly produce results notably damaging to his\nmost cherished convictions.\nAbove all, I wish to express and to emphasise my gratitude to\n\f178 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nProfessor Fisher, now occupying tlie Chair of Genetics at London\nUniversity. Whatever success this research may be deemed to\nhave achieved is\u2014given the observations\u2014almost entirely due to\nhim ;\nfor, if he had not developed his elegant and powerful Analysis\nof Variance, the results could not, I think, have been obtained at all\n;\nwhile, if he had not personally guided my uncertain footsteps at\nevery stage of the analysis, I should still be floundering in the morass\nof my own ineptitudes. The responsibility for the way in which\nI have applied his methods is, on the other hand, entirely mine.\n5\nI will now turn to a somewhat closer examination of the technique\nused, and will begin with the psychogalvanic reflex, to which I have\nalready alluded more than once.\nI want it clearly understood that there is no magic whatever about\nthe psychogalvanic reflex. This formidable name refers merely to\na decrease in the apparent electrical resistance of the subject's\nskin, and such a decrease takes place (in normal subjects, at any rate)\nwhenever any stimulus is apphed. It is true that, in spite of many\nyears of study by numerous experimenters, there is still some\ndifference of ojiinion as to precisely what causes it, as to the nervous\nmechanisms which control it, and as to what it is that it indicates.\nFor some say that it indicates \" emotion,\" while others say \" cona-\ntion \" and yet others (of whom I myself was formerly one) prefer to\nspeak of \" affective tone.\" Mercifully, none of this matters for our\npresent purpose ; we are only interested in the undisputed facts\nthat the decrease in apparent resistance is an easily measurable\nquantity and that it is positively correlated with the degree of\npsychological disturbance\u2014of whatever kind this may be\u2014that\ntakes place when a stimulus is applied. We shall do best to think\nof it, in this context, merely as a measurable part of the total\npreparation for action which takes place in the subject as a result\nof confronting him \" in miniature,\" as we have put it, with the\nsituations recalled by the stimulus word.\nSimilarly there is nothing in the least remarkable about the\napparatus we used for its measurement, except that it was specially\ndesigned for portability. It consists merely of an ordinary Wheat-\nstone's bridge\u2014the standard instrument for measuring electrical\nresistance\u2014provided with the usual knobs and dials for reading\nthe magnitude of the resistance to which it is applied (in this case the\nresistance of the subject) and it is fitted with a built-in galvanometer\nof a portable reflecting type, built-in batteries, sensitivity control\nand the usual switching arrangements. For a description of the\napparatus, see Appendix I.\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 179\nOn the other hand, a few words may be of interest as to the way\nin which it is used. The standard method, so to speak, which I\nemployed successfully in all my early work of 1920-21, consists in\nusing a pair of circular zinc-plate electrodes, about two inches in\ndiameter (in the Garrett-Uvani experiments they were 44 mm.),\ncovered with chamois leather soaked in salt solution, and applied to\nthe palm and back of the subject's left hand. The whole is padded\nwith cotton wool and may conveniently be bandaged to a splint to\nminimize mechanical movement between the hand and the elec-\ntrodes. Such mechanical movements tend to loosen one contact or\nthe other and thereby to increase resistance, thus reducing or\nnullifying the effect we are seeking to observe and even producing,\nin many cases, a negative deflexion of the galvanometer.\nThis procedure works well for most ordinary people. So far as I\ncan remember, I have met only about three, in a hundred or so\ntested, for whom it did not ; but there are a few, who have a very\nhigh resistance and a tendency to erratic response, for whom more\ndrastic methods are necessary. For these we now use \" foot-bath\n\"\nelectrodes, such as are employed for work with electro-cardiographs.\nThese consist of porcelain tanks containing the salt solution, in\nwhich the subject's feet are immersed, while special compartments\ncontain zinc-plate electrodes, which accordingly do not make direct\nmechanical contact with the subject. This plan lowers resistance\nand practically eliminates the effects of muscular movement. It is\nthe preferable procedure for all cases where there is any uncertainty\nas to the magnitude and reliability of the response obtainable with\nthe simpler type of hand electrodes, which I should now use only in\nemergency or for specially good subjects. A still later plan, more\nconvenient in many cases, is to use the foot-baths as hand-baths in\nwhich the hands and forearms of the subject are immersed, suitable\ntransverse \" grips \" being provided to help in reducing casual\nmovement.\nIt will be understood that what is actually measured is simply\nthe movement of the spot of light given by the galvanometer along\nthe scale attached to the latter, and that this movement is a measure\nof the resistance change produced in the subject's skin by the disturb-\nance caused when the stimulus word is called out and answered.\nSuitable corrections\n\u2014\ne.g., for sensitivity and for the voltage\napplied to the bridge\u2014must, of course, be applied before the\ndeflexions noted during the experiment are subjected to analysis.^\n6\nI pass to a consideration of the reaction times. These are, of\ncourse, easy enough to measure ; for all that is needed is to use an\n\f180 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nordinary stop-watcli, reading fifths of seconds, start it as the\nstimulus word is called out (preferably on the accented syllable of\npolysyllabic words), and stop it as the reply is given (again prefer-\nably on the accented syllable). The time thus recorded is the reac-\ntion time, and there is only one remark worth making here, namely,\nthat any constant error on the part of the observer\u2014or, indeed, any\nconstant lag on the part of the subject\u2014is automatically eliminated\nin the course of the subsequent analysis.\nThere are, however, two points connected with the use of reaction\ntimes, which are of very great importance, for ignorance of one\nmight easily mislead and ignorance of the other might altogether\nvitiate otherwise valuable work.\nThe first is that differences in the actual mean magnitude of\nreaction time, taken over a series of words, do not necessarily imply,\nor even presumptively indicate, a difference of individuality between\nthe personalities concerned. That is to say, if one personality gives\nan average reaction time of two seconds for a list of words and\nanother gives an average of two seconds and a half, this is by no\nmeans necessarily an indication of non-identity in the sense that\ninterests us here, even if the difference is shown by analysis not to\nbe attributable to chance. Such a result could be brought about\nby many causes, such as drugs or fatigue or even a change of \" mood \"\nand it is, indeed, just the kind of difference which might reasonably\nbe expected to accompany the trance state, as a part, perhaps, of\nthe subconsciously determined impersonation undertaken by a\nsecondary personality. We are interested only in the differential\nincidence, as regards personalities, of prolongation of reaction time\namong the various words of the list.\nThe second point may be explained as follows : In the case of the\npsychogalvanic reflex it is easy to see that there are plenty of physical\nand physiological reasons why the deflexion obtained cannot be\nindefinitely large. The subject's resistance cannot drop to zero\n(I am talking of ordinary deflexions and neglecting the not-impos-\nsible effects of the e.m.f. mentioned in Note 7) and even if it did, the\nresistance of the leads and electrodes, etc., would ensure a finite de-\nflexion. To the first approximation, at any rate, we are accordingly\nentitled to take the deflexion as a definite numerical measure of the\ndisturbance produced, which indeed, unless we call introspection to\nour aid, can only be stated in terms of the magnitudes we measure.\nBut there is nothing in principle to prevent a reaction time being\nprolonged indefinitely ; there is only the moral effect of its being\nan experiment and not a child's game (and possibly theforce majeure\nof the experimenter) to prevent the subject postponing the reply for\nten minutes or till the week after next. Consequently, very long\nreaction times are apt not to be significant in proportion to their\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 181\nlength. If the average is one second, for example, a time of one\nsecond and a half probably means something ; but a time of three\nseconds will mean little more, while one of ten will almost certainly\nmean no more at all than that of three.\n^\nNow the effect of such meaninglessly long times, occurring at\nrandom, cannot be to produce spurious eifects of similarity, for\nsimilarities depend, as is easily understood, on coincidences, as\nbetween the personalities, of long or short times on the same words,\nand the chance of this occurring by accident is taken care of in the\nanalysis. But they might produce spurious effects of difference, as\ncan be understood at once by imagining two idealised sets of identi-\ncally similar reactions (which would, of course, give perfect simi-\nlarity) and then considering the effect of adding random increases\nto the entries in one of them. We must, accordingly, be very much\non our guard against this effect, if ever we meet with apparent\ndifferences between personalities based on reaction times. My own\npractice is to write double the mean value (or, better, double the\nmedian value for all values greater than this, and to compute on\nthe basis of the figures thus obtained. My experience leads me to\nbeheve that this is just about right ;\nbut, pending further ad hoc\nresearch, I am not in a position to defend this procedm-e against\nanyone who likes to contend that one and a half times the mean, say,\nor two and a half times the mean, are better \" cut-off \" points.\nIn certain cases of critical importance, therefore, I have resorted\nto an over-drastic test by writing simply the value one for all values\ngreater than the mean (or median, as the case may be) and zero for\nall values less than it. This procedure, of course, sacrifices all the\ninformation there may be in the gradations of the times and I\naccordingly use it only occasionally as a crucial qualitative test and\nrely on my \" double the mean \" plan for comparative work, where\nthe error introduced, if any, will become what I may loosely term\na second order effect depending on the differences between errors\nthemselves already small.\nSince writing the above I have begun a comprehensive study of\nthe points involved and hope to be shortly in a position to propose a\ncompletely standardised procedure for dealing with both reaction\ntime and psychogalvanic reflex data in this and other respects.\nSome such standardization is essential in order that results obtained\nin differing circumstances or by different workers may be truly\ncomparable.\n7\nThirdly, there is what is known as the reproduction test.\nWhen the experimenter has gone through the list, noting the\nreaction times, the psychogalvanic reflexes and the words given in\n\f182 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nreply to the stimuli, he goes through it a second time, asking the.\nsubject to reply, if possible, with the same word that was first given\nin association. Failure to do this, or prolonged hesitation in doing\nso, is counted as a \" disturbance in reproduction,\" and the incidence\nof these disturbances among the various words of the Hst affords\nanother basis for deciding whether the personalities concerned are\nsimilar or different.\nThis \" complex indicator,\" to use the technical term, is one of\nexceptional merit,i^ mainly on account of the almost complete lack\nof extraneous error connected with it ; and it has the additional\nadvantage of being exceptionally easy to compute, since all the\nentries are necessarily either one or zero.\n8\nIn addition to these three tests, I have done a considerable\namount of work on other possible sources of information, notably\non the Form of the Association ; that is to say, on the grammatical\nform of the response and on the logical or grammatical relation\nbetween it and the stimulus word. But I have definitely come to\nthe conclusion that, in the present state of the art, the method is\nsubstantially valueless.\nIt is easy enough, on the face of it, to classify the words or the\nrelationships under different headings and to compute the chance\nthat the numbers thus obtained for different personalities agree or\ndisagree by accident to the observed extent. I have, indeed, ob-\ntained some most striking results by this method\u2014for example, all\nthe four personahties dealt with in the case of Mrs Leonard and\ndescribed below appeared to be sharply separable by this means.\nBut I have yet to find a system of classification which is both\nunambiguous and psychologically relevant, so that I was left with\nthe uneasy feeling that I could quite well have produced entirely\ndifferent results with almost equal plausibility.\nI have accordingly abandoned the method, for the present, as an\ninstrument of research, though I think it by no means impossible\nthat special study might lead to a scheme capable of yielding very\nvaluable results.\nI have also tried other plans, such as the study of grammatical\nform alone, of the ways in which complex indicators are combined,\nand even of such preferences as are shown for initial letters for the\nresponse words. But none of these have yielded any results of\nstatistical significance one way or the other, and I have accordingly\nfallen back on the three classical indicators already described.\n\fi\n136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Perso7ialities 183\n9\nI have no time for more than a very few words on the subject of\nthe beautiful and searching method, known as the Analysis of\nVariance, whereby the data obtained have been examined. (The\ngeneral procedure is illustrated in Appendix II.)\nIf we inspect a mass of reactions obtained from two different\npersonalities in response to the same set of stimulus words, we\nnotice, of course, that, in general they differ one from another.\nThese differences are due to a number of causes ; one personality,\nfor example, may be, on the whole, more sluggish in reply, or less\nsensitive as regards the reflex, than the other ; the various words are\nresponsible for marked differences of reaction ; and there will be\ndifferences also corresponding to the several occasions on which the\npersonalities have been tested\u2014greater sensitivity on one day, less\non another, and so forth. In addition to these clearly identifiable\nfactors there operates a host of incalculable minor influences\n\u2014\nranging from distractions during the course of the experiment to the\ntrivial incidents of the medium's daily life and thought\u2014and these,\ni\ncollectively, make up error.\nNow, what I may colloquially term the \" overall differentness \" of\nthe hypothetical \" population,\" of which the observations form a\nsample, is known as its Variance and to it contribute all the various\nfactors I have mentioned. The function of the technique is to sort\nout the contributions made from the various sources, to express\nj\nthem in comparable form and, by comparing them with each other,\nto determine the probability of the similarities or differences\nexisting between the reactions obtained from the different per-\nsonalities being the result of chance alone.\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the last few words.\nAnyone can manipulate figures and get an answer of sorts ; and all\ntoo many people do. But unless that answer is backed by a proba-\nbility telling us what degree of reliance may be placed on it, it is\n(likely to be worse than useless.\nIn Science it is the Probability Integral, rather than Faith, that\nis \" the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not\nseen.\"\n\f\u2022i\n184 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nPart II\nExperiments and Results : Interpretation\n10\nAt last I come to the experiments conducted and the results\nobtained from them.\nThe first case to be investigated was that of Mrs Garrett and her\ncontrol \" Uvani,\" who, incidentally, purports to be an Arab and not\nto know English except, I gather, through the intermediacy of the\nmedium.\nThese two personalities were tested at six double sittings,\"*\nand Mr Besterman, as aheady noted, was responsible for collecting\nthe data, which comprised all three indicators.\nCopies of these observations, as of all others mentioned in this\npaper, are preserved among the Society's archives.\nThe list of one hundred words used was the same that I em-\nployed in my original work on the differences between normal\npersons. It was derived from that given by Dr Eder, in his Intro-\nduction to Jung's Studies in Word Association, by deleting the\ntwenty words which I had previously found to give the largest\npsychogalvanic reflexes, on the average, when applied to about\n100 normal subjects, and replacing them with twenty others which\nI judged likely to be less exciting.\nThe reason for doing this in the first instance was that I feared lest\nthe inclusion of many words of great common interest\u2014such as\nthose bearing on erotic life and the like\u2014might obscure individual\ndifferences in respect of other matters. In the present case I was\nagain influenced by these considerations, hut also by the knowledge\nthat this list had already worked well. The order of the words was\nsuitably varied from sitting to sitting.\nNo difficulty was experienced in obtaining reaction times or\nverbal responses from either personality, each of whom, especially\nMrs Garrett, had had previous practice with Mr Hereward Carrington\nin America.\n11\nOn the other hand, Mrs Garrett proved to be by far the worst\nsubject for the psychogalvanic reflex that I have ever worked with,\nwhile Uvani was little better, if at all. I have met, perhaps, so\nmany as three or four persons of this high-resistance, erratic-\nresponse type before, but having previously had ample material to\ndraw on, I discarded them at once in favour of more amenable\nsubjects. We could not do this here, since mediums of Mrs Garrett's:\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 185\ncalibre are not too easy to come by, so we struggled on doing the\nbest we might and finally obtained some 520 positive deflexions of a\nsort, from the two personalities together, out of the 1200 aimed at.\nThere were also 92 reasonably definite negative deflexions of no\ninterest to us and ascribable to mechanical movement, while the\nremaining 588 attempts to obtain a reading failed to give anything\nworth writing down.\nWe used the hand electrodes throughout, hoping always that\nbetter results would be obtained next time ; but I think now that\nI ought to have suspended the work after the first sitting and adopted\nfoot-bath electrodes at once.^'\nThese data (the 520 positive deflexions referred to) were far too\nfragmentary for treatment by the Analysis of Variance, which de-\nmands for its operation a compact array of figures without gaps.\nI was accordingly forced to employ the far cruder technique of\ncorrelation, which I had used in my early work, and this itself was\nreduced in value by the many gaps in the material.\nI shall not trouble the reader with a detailed account ^\u00ae of this\nwork ;\nfor, although it occupied me for very many weeks, nothing\nunquestionably significant came of it.\nNone the less it is noteworthy that, no matter whether I dealt\nwith the actual ohmic changes produced, or with the most elabo-\nrately corrected derivatives of these ; or whether I used the\nclassical method of correlation, or that by \" ranks \" (which there is\nsome reason for doing with material so bad as this ; or whether\nI eliminated or did not eliminate two words (\" Frog \" in the case of\nGarrett and \" Dog \" in the case of Uvani) which seemed unduly to\ninfluence the results,^^ I always obtained a much stronger suggestion\nof difference than of similarity.\nAs a matter of fact, I obtained one result to the effect that the\nchance of the observed difference being accidental was no more\nthan 1 in about 600 ; but in view of the general unsatisfactoriness\nof the material, I do not care to rely much on this figure.\n12\nThe reaction times, however, told a far clearer story. In this\ncase I was obliged to discard the first sitting altogether, because the\noflGicial stop-watch broke down in the middle of it ; but none the less\nMr Besterman obtained for me a good compact mass of 91 words\nat each of five double sittings\u2014a total of 910 observations. Such\nan aggregate is readily handled by the Analysis of Variance\u2014\n\u2022\nbnce one knows how\u2014and Professor Fisher himself very kindly\ndealt with the first fifty words for me in order to illustrate the\nprocedure.\n\f1\n186 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nActually, I worked these figures four times ;\nfirst with tlie un-\ncorrected \"\ndata ;\nsecond, writing double the mean for all values\ngreater than this ;\nthird, writing 1 for all above the mean and 0 for\nall below it ; and finally doing the same thing but using the median\ninstead of the mean.^^\nAll four procedures led to the same result. There was found, m\neach case, either a wholly negligible similarity or none at all,\ntogether with a highly significant difference.\nThe chances of this difference being accidental were found to be\nabout one in ten miUions, one in one million, one in ten thousand,\nand one in ten million respectively.\nIncidentally, this goes far to confirm the very approximate\ncorrectness of the plan of using double the mean for all greater values.\n13\nI also analysed the disturbances in reproduction in this case.\nUnfortunately a great many replies took the form of \" No \" or\n\" I don't know,\" and it is scarcely reasonable to maintain that the\nrepeating of such negations constitutes undisturbed reproduction.\nI was accordingly obliged to omit these words, with the result that\nthe data became nearly as fragmentary as those for the psycho-\ngalvanic reflex.\nI obtained, however, an unbroken block of 26 words, which I\ntreated by Analysis of Variance,^* and I also appUed another\nmethod, known as Contingency, to the comparable pairs of rephes,\nworking through the data sitting by sitting.^^\nThe two procedures agreed in showing a significant difference\nbetween the two personalities, the chance of this difference being\naccidental amounting to probably much less than one in one\nhundred.\n14\nCombining the results from these two sources of reaction time and\nreproduction test\u2014which are quite independent\u2014and allowing\nourselves the modest make-weight of a one in ten chance from the|\npsychogalvanic reflexes, we conclude that, in respect of the range\nof interests covered by the words of the list, these two personalities\nare significantly different\u2014different, that is to say, to an extent\nthat would arise by chance only once in some thousand million\ntrials. 2\u00ae\nThey show, therefore, no sign of sharing a common subconscious\ncontent in the way that the classical view of multiple personality\nwould lead us to expect.\n\f136] The Qua7ititative Study of Trance Personalities 187\n15\nThe next case to be studied was that of the well-known \" physi-\ncal \" medium, Herr Eudi Schneider, and his Control \" Olga,\" who\npurports to be, I understand, the surviving consciousness of one\nLola Montez, once well known as an artiste and otherwise.\nAs already mentioned, this investigation was suggested to me by\nMr Besterman with a view to its forming a part of a wider study of\nHerr Schneider's mediumship which was then in progress, but it\ndeveloped, as will be seen, into a very valuable contribution to my\nown work.\nThe data were again collected for me by Mr Besterman^'' and con-\nsisted of the psychogalvanic reflexes and reaction times elicited in\nresponse to one hundred German words adapted by Mr Besterman\nfrom Jung's own list.^^\" The words of this list largely resembled,\neither by actual equivalence or close affinity, those used for Mrs\nGarrett, but a number of special words were included which I shall\ndiscuss below.\nFoot-bath electrodes were used for the psychogalvanic reflex with,\non the whole, very satisfactory results. There was no trouble with\nnegative deflexions, the subject's resistance was low and deflexions\nof good size were easily elicited.\nThere was still a considerable number of readings spoiled for one\nreason or another and the first of the six double sittings had to be\ndiscarded altogether. We obtained, however, an unbroken block of\n56 words for each of the other five, making a satisfactory total of\n560 items for analysis.\nThis analysis disclosed a highly significant similarity between\nthe two personalities, the chance of its being accidental amount-\ning to something less than one in one hundred thousand. No\nmore than a faint and wholly insignificant trace of difference was\ndiscernible.^\"\nI may say in parenthesis that once we get into these high figures\n(or, rather, these microscopic chances) the presence of a few zeros\nmore or less may be disregarded. We obtain a measure of difference\nor similarity, as the case may be, the nature of which I shall discuss\nbelow, and the chances which I cite are measures not of these\nquantities but of our confidence in them. This confidence naturally\nincreases with the number of data available, so that once it has\nbecome high we know that it is only a matter of going on long enough\nto obtain any specified chance we like, however small, assuming\nrelevant conditions to remain unaltered. It would, therefore, be\nquite erroneous to conclude that Eudi and Olga are less definitely\nsimilar than Garrett and Uvani are different ; for the results ob-\ntained from the latter pair are based on 910 items of information and\n\f188 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nthose for the former on only 560 ; and even this leaves out the\nquestion of the varying degree of error in the two cases. We are\nentitled to say that our estimate of the Garrett-Uvani difference is\nlikely to be somewhat nearer the true value than our estimate of the\nKudi-Olga similarity ; but the fact of significant difference and the i\nfact of significant similarity may be regarded as coercively established\n^\nin the two cases.\n16\nI mentioned just now that the list contained a number of special\nwords. These were inserted with a view to throwing light, if\npossible, on Rudi's (and Olga's) attitude towards the genuineness of\nthe phenomena alleged to occur in his presence.\nWhen I analysed the data, I did not know which these words\nwere ; but I selected ten, which seemed to be relevant and to have\naroused especial interest to judge by an inspection of the reflexes |\nthey produced. I should add that no others appeared to have any |\nbearing on the subject and that these ten did actually include all\nthose chosen by Mr Besterman for this purpose.\nThese words were : aufpassen, Gesetz, streitenjahcl, Angst, Geist,\ndrohen, Sclmindel, Vorsicht, vertrauen. They may fairly be trans-\nlated : Beware, Law (hence, rules, conditions, etc.). Have a row with\n(hence controversy, etc.), False, Fear (or anxiety), Spirit, Threaten,\nFraud, Caution, Trust (hence distrust, suspicion, etc.). It is easyl\nto see that all these words are likely to arouse, directly or in-\n1\ndirectly, thoughts of fraud and suspicion, fear of exposure (if there is|\nany) and the like. . I\nIn order to see what kind of importance these words had, I with-il\ndrew them from the aggregate and analysed afresh the data corre-\nsponding to the remaining 46 words. I still obtained a definitely\nsignificant similarity,^! the chance of its being accidental coming to\n,\nno more than about 1 in 250, so that it cannot plausibly be main-\nj\ntained that the observed similarity is due to a strong common ji\ninterest shared by two distinct individuals. On the other hand, the ;\n'\nsimilarity is diminished to such an extent that this group of ideas, ;\nj\nassociated with fraud and suspicion, may fairly be said to dominate\nthe psychic life of the joint personality, which we may term RuD-j\nOLGA. It I were pressed to desert purism for a moment in the 1\ninterests of vividness, I would hazard the opinion that this group of\nideas is responsible for something like one-third of the total similarity\nobserved.\nThis is the more noteworthy in view of the fact that the list con-\ntained a good number of words connected with such almost univer-\nsally interesting topics as love, sickness and death.^s\nEven those with a weakness for illogical distinctions without\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 189\ndifference must, I think, admit that if Eudi and Olga are\u2014in some\nmystical and transcendental sense\u2014not \" the same \" they are, at\nany rate, \" two minds with but a single thought, two hearts that beat\nIS one \".\n17\nThe reaction times given by Eudi were of peculiar interest.\nIn the first place they Avere very short, averaging about 1-9 second,\nas compared with about 2-5 for Mrs Garrett, 3-8 for Uvani and 4-5\nifor the whole Leonard group to be discussed later. {N.B. Olga was\nvery much longer, with a mean of no less than 8-4 seconds, but this\nmay be attributed to the pecuUarities of the \" trance \" state and is\nnot relevant to the present issue.)\nSecondly, they maintained a most remarkable dead level of\nmagnitude, showing extraordinarily little variation from word to\nw^ord.^^ This is of importance for the following reasons :\nMy imperfect acquaintance with the German language has pre-\nivented me making as thorough a study of the replies given as I could\n(wish ; but two things are quite clear to me even under this handicap.\nFirst, there is a very high proportion indeed of replies which seem\n;. to have no connection whatever with the stimulus word ;\nsecond,\n,j\nof these irrelevant replies, a considerable number\u2014of the order of\n,\nfifteen or twenty per cent, I should judge\u2014appear to be determined\n,y\nby the immediately preceding word, or by one only two or three\nJ.\nplaces removed from it.\njj\n!\nWhen we find the first of these features\u2014irrelevance\u2014coupled\nwith an abnormally long reaction time (as in some of the early\nI,.\nLeonard sittings) we may confidently attribute it to \" mind-\n^ wandering.\" But when we find it coupled with an abnormally\n\\ short time we cannot but suspect that the subject has been making\n\u2022Ijiup his mind what to reply before he hears the stimulus word. And\nJ.\n'\nthis view is strengthened by the apparent borrowing of associations\nf'from near-by words. I have counted some fifty cases of this\nj\napparent borrowing in the first three Eudi sittings, whereas, in the\n; whole of the rest of the material examined, I have noticed only some\n({\nhalf-dozen examples of this happening.\np. I necessarily speak with difiidence here ; but the strong impression\nj5\nI gather from the data as a whole is that Eudi, far from co-operating\n,['\nproperly in the test, was attempting rather to follow a plan of\ncampaign well calculated to obscm-e the issues involved.\n18\nI-\nWhen these times were compared with those of Olga and analysed,\nfurther points of some interest emerged.\n\f190 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nI first treated the raw data, without applying corrections of any\nkind. This gave me a highly significant difference between Rudi\nand Olga\u2014a surprising and almost unbelievable contradiction of the\neven stronger similarity I had obtained from the psychogalvanic\nreflexes. When, however, I wrote double the mean for every value\ngreater than this {of. 6 above) and re-analysed, I found negligible!\nindications of difference and similarity alike\u2014the latter being, if\nanything the less feeble of the two. When I applied the still morei\ndrastic \" one or zero \" method, which I have already mentioned\ni\n(using the mean as the critical value), I obtained a difference of\nrather less than nothing, if I may loosely put it so, and a similarityj\nwhich, though scarcely significant statistically, was quite well\nmarked.^*\nIt is clear that this procedure, by eliminating the cause of spurious\ndifference already noted, has yielded a result conforming both to the\ndecisive answer given by the reflexes and to the known inferiority\nof the reaction time data.\nThese points are not without an interest of their own, but\nthe real value of the Rudolga investigation to the main structure of\nthis paper is that it shows clearly that, when we are confronted\nwith two apparently different personalities which are really one and\nthe same, the method proclaims them to be so with no uncertain\nvoice.\nFrom the methodological standpoint, in which I am far more\ninterested here than in demonstrating any particular conclusion,\nthe importance of this can hardly be over-estimated. We should]\nlook with grave suspicion on our fine new telescope if it showed\nevery star in the heavens as double !\n19\nI think that having gone so far, almost anyone might be excused\nfor supposing that all we had to do in future was to sit back in our,\nchairs and sort out pairs of personalities into similar sheep and dis\nsimilar goats. Such, however, is far from being the case, and when\nI came to deal with the Leonard group of personalities, which I shall\nnow discuss, I was faced with intricacies of relationships involving\ncorresponding difficulties in analysis.\nI must accordingly ask for close attention while I develop an\nargument which cannot fail to be complicated ; and I can only\nhope that the reader will not find it so hard to follow as I have found\nit to prepare.\nThrough the great kindness of Mr. Drayton Thomas, as already\nmentioned, I was able to study, in the case of Mrs Leonard, no fewer\nthan four personalities. These were : first, Mrs. Leonard in her\nI\niSSC\nMI\nwi\nbee\nM\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 191\nnormal state (but see section 29 below) ;\nsecond, her Control\n'\nFeda,\" who\u2014as most readers probably know\u2014usually takes\ncharge of the trance and purports to act as a kind of intermediary\nbetween the would-be communicators and the sitter ;\nthird, the late\n'\nReverend John Wesley Thomas\u2014father of Mr Drayton Thomas ;\nand, fourth, Mr Drayton Thomas' sister, nee Miss Etta Thomas and\ndaughter, therefore, of the Reverend John. These two appear to\n!\nbe able to control the medium\u2014if I may be allowed spiritistic terms\n:\nfor a moment\u2014almost as well as Feda herself ; and it was, of course,\nwhile they were doing so that their reactions were taken.\nI shall refer to these four personalities, for the sake of brevity, as\nL, F, J and E respectively.\n20\nMost unfortunately, we were unable to use the psychogalvanic\nreflex in this case. Mrs Leonard herself, I hasten to add, was very\nwilling ; but there were external obstacles which could not be\nsurmounted and we were accordingly forced to rely on the reaction\ntimes, reproduction test and response words only. This, as may be\ni imagined, was a heavy handicap, especially as all four personalities\nj\ngave very long times all round and I was by no means sure that the\n'\nvariations in these would be sufficient to give definite results.\nIn any event, the task of determining the relationships within a\nfourfold personality with the aid of nothing more elaborate than a\ncommon stop-watch may reasonably be described as formidable.\nI may say here, in parenthesis, that the response given to the\nwords of the list showed a most striking concordance with the\nprofessed characters of the personalities concerned. Thus J was\nrich in scriptural allusions and references to church matters, E in\nassociations constellated by reminiscences of ill health and F in\nwords having a more or less Oriental flavour.\nAs I have already explained, I have not yet been able to devise a\nsatisfactory method of subjecting responses to mathematical\ntreatment, but it is greatly to be hoped that ]\\'Ir Drayton Thomas\n\u2014\nwho is far better qualified to do so than I\u2014will see his way in dis-\ncussing this aspect of the research in a special communication.\nThe main experiments consisted of six quadruple sittings and\nthe same list of words was used that did duty in the Garrett-Uvani\nj\nwork. But it was found that we could not count on getting more\nthan 75 reactions from each personality, because the work seemed\nto exhaust somewhat rapidly the \" power \"\u2014whatever that may be\n\u2014on which the process of \" control \" depends. For this reason,\nalso, we obtained no reactions at all from E for the second sitting,\nI\nbecause the power gave out after taking a himdred each from\nL, F and J.\nI\n\f192 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nThus the comparisons discussed below are based on six sets of\nseventy-five words for each personality, except when E is involved,\nand then on five sets of seventy-five.\nExtra reactions, up to a total of one hundred, were actually taken\non a number of occasions, in the hope that the responses might be\nused statistically ; but this hope proved illusory, as already ex-\nplained. '\n21\nNow in studying a quadruple manifold of this kind, the most\nnatural thing to do, perhaps, would be to throw all four personalities\ninto hotch-potch\u2014as the lawyers say\u2014and apply a test to the total\nmass of data to see whether, taken as a whole, it is substantially\nhomogeneous or not.\nUnfortunately, we cannot allow ourselves so simple a procedure\nas this ;\nbecause, although the result would be extremely striking\nif the mass were found not to be homogeneous, we might easily be\nmisled if it were.\nSuppose, for example, that Feda were a clearly distinguishable\npersonality, bearing the same relation to Mrs Leonard that Uvani\niDears to Mrs Garrett, and suppose also that she were capable of\nassuming diverse superficially different forms while remaining\nfundamentally the same\u2014as a well-behaved secondary personaHty\nshould do. Then the sameness between F, J and E might easily so\nobscure the difference between F and L, if all were treated together,\nthat we should conclude that the whole manifold was homogeneous,\nwhereas actually it would not be.\nIt is accordingly necessary to take the personalities by pairs and\nascertain what relationship exists between the members of each.\nThere are, of course, six such pairs to be studied, namely L and F,\nL and J, L and E ; F and J, F and E ; and J and E.\nI accordingly analysed each of these pairs in turn and obtained\nthe following results for similarity based on the reaction times.\nz P\nLF - \u20222740 Less than -01, say 1 in 110\nLJ - \u20223445 \u201e \u201e -002, J\n)\n1 600\nLE - \u20221977 \u201e \u201e -05, J?\n1 1 >\n25\nFJ - \u20221271 )) J!\n'15, J 7\n1 7 J\n7\nFE - No similarity.\nJE - \u20222702 Less than -01, J1\n1 5\n;\n100\nNow I cannot discuss the mathematics of the subject here ; but\nit will not be misleading to regard the figures in the column headed z\n\f136] The Quayititative Study of Trance Personalities 193\nas measures of tlie similarity between the personalities concerned\n\u2014though somewhat clouded, of course, by error\u2014and those in\nthe column headed P as the chances that these apparent similari-\nties have arisen by accident. Thus the smaller the value of P the\ngreater our confidence in the measure of similarity to which it\nbelongs.\nIt will be noticed that the closest similarity is between L and J\n\u2014not between L and F as we might, perhaps, expect\u2014and that we may\nfeel practically certain that this is genuine ; L and F, with J and E,\ncome next and we may feel quite confident about them also ; the\nsimilarities between L and E and between F and J are rather small\nand their associated P's rather high, so that we have not much\nconfidence in them ; while there is no similarity at all between F\nand E, so that the question of confidence does not arise.\n22\nThe corresponding figures for the reproduction test are :\nP\nLF \u20222287 About \u202202, say ] . in 50\nLJ \u20223289 \u201e -002, \u201e ] 500\nLE \u20222192 \u201e -03, \u201e ] 30\nFJ \u202238965 \u201e -000,4, \u201e ]\n5 ^\n2,500\nFE \u20223314 \u201e -002, \u201e ]\n5> 500\nJE \u20224951 \u201e -000,01, \u201e ]^ J\n)\n100,000\nThese figures naturally do not correspond exactly with those\nobtained from the reaction times ; and it would be very odd if they\ndid, for the two tests clearly involve appreciably different processes.\nThe reaction time test is a matter of finding a word with which to\nreply, while the reproduction test is one of remembering which word\nyou found. The results of the two should give somewhat similar\nresults (and they do), but there is scarcely more reason why they\nshould be identical than those obtained by examining school\nchildren in Mathematics and in French.\nThe relatively very great similarity between J and E should be\nnoticed here\u2014a similarity consistent with their supposed relation-\nship of father and daughter. This similarity is well above the\naverage for reaction times also.\n\f194 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\n23\nAnother point of considerable interest may be brought out as\nfollows :\n-11\nLet us take the average similarity of each personality with the\nother three and arrange these averages in order of magnitude.\nThis gives us :\nFoe Keaction Times. For Keproductions.\nL - - -2731 J - - -4045\nJ - - -2473 E - - -3486\nE - - -1227 F - - -3166\nF - - -1037 L - - -2589\nNotice here how J and E keep together in each case and par-\nticularly how the J factor, so to speak, dominates the scene in the\nreproduction test and is second in the case of the reaction times.\nOn the whole it is markedly J whom the others most resemble\u2014not\nL as one might expect. We shall find this tendency again and again,\nand I have no hesitation in saying that, if the four sets of figures had\nsimply been marked W, X, Y and Z and given to someone to analyse\nwho did not know which was which, he would have come to the\nconclusion that the one corresponding to J was the \" highest common\nfactor \" in the group and would have surmised that this was the\nnormal medium.\nIt is also interesting to note\u2014though I do not want anyone to\nattach a grain more importance to it than he wishes\u2014that F least\nresembles the others in the matter of reaction time, where some\nelement of word-selection is involved and likeness of vocabulary is\ncalculated to promote similarity. This is curiously consistent with\nFeda's claim to be of Indian birth, so that English would be an\nacquired language to her, and with her habit of talking somewhat\nchildishly. If F is a secondary personality of L, in the classical\nsense, she certainly seems to play her part with an extraordinary\nattention to detail ;\nbut, on the other hand, it might be rash to\nwager very heavily on the vaUdity of the indication obtained.\n24\nI must now ask my readers' indulgence while I digress to discuss\na point which must already have been perplexing some of them,\nespecially those who are accustomed to deaUng with statistics.\n\" Why,\"\u2014it has probably been wondered\u2014\" having discovered\npretty strong similarities in five cases out of six, is it not frankly\nadmitted that we are dealing with a straightforward case of quad-\nruple personality and have done with it ? Is not all this talk about\n\f:l36] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 195\ndifferences of similarity and the dominance of one factor rather than\nanother, and all the rest of it, no more than a somewhat disingenous\nattempt to discover dilferences where none exist and so pave the\nway for a fanciful interpretation of facts which could be simply\nexplained ?\n\"\nWith this feeling, if it exists, I have every sympathy ; for it is\nnot unnatural on the facts so far presented in the manner I have so\nfar presented them.\nNone the less, I propose to reserve my main defence for a moment,\nand I will ask the reader to follow me in an argument which I believe\n|i to be in some degree novel, which is certainly important, and likely,\nI think, to convince him that the differences I have been discussing\nare not artifacts, but genuine differences worthy of examination.\nI want those who are conversant with statistical practice to forget,\nand the others not to think of, the ideas of \" populations \" and\n\" samples \" which form, so to say, the current coin of statistical\nsmall talk.\nI want to discuss the matter rather in terms of such everyday\nobjects as Automatic Machines\u2014the kind of things one finds on\nrailway stations, where one puts in a penny and takes out a packet\nI\nof butterscotch or a good cigar. The resemblance of such a machine\nito a medium under test is very close ; there is only the trifling\n!\ndifference that instead of a coin one puts in a stimulus word and\ninstead of a packet of butterscotch one takes out a reaction time,\njit would, indeed, be easy enough, in principle, to design a machine\nI\nwhich in answer to a word called out to it would reply with another\nafter an interval determined by the nature of the word called out.\nConsider two of these machines and imagine that each has slots\n!for a half-penny, a penny, a three-penny bit, a sixpence and a\nshilling\u2014or as many other coins as you like. Let us suppose also\nthat both machines deliver bars of butterscotch of different weights\naccording to the coins inserted, and that we want to determine\nj\nexperimentally whether the machines are similarly constructed or\nnot. We put our five coins into the first machine and receive, let\nus say, packets containing respectively one, two, six, twelve and\ntwenty-four ounces of the commodity. We do the same with the\nsecond machine and receive\u2014somewhat to our surprise\u2014two, six,\none, twelve and twenty-four ounces for the respective coins. We\nconclude that the machines are to some extent similar (because the\ntwo biggest coins produced the same results) and to some extent\niifferent (because the three smaller ones did not).\nNow it is quite easy to calculate a measure of similarity from these\nlata\u2014one of the z's, in fact, that I have been tallying about\u2014and\nilso the chance that this result is accidental\u2014for example, that one\n3f the machines is out of order. But we need not bother about the\n\f196 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [parI\nactual values in this rather fantastic case : What I want to emphai\nsize is that, unless one of the machines goes wrong, we can go on\nrepeating the test indefinitely without ever getting a different\nmeasure of similarity\u2014because the similarity is, as it were, built\ninto the machine. But we will, of course, get a constantly increasing\nmeasure of confidence ; for the more often we get the same result\nthe less hkely it is to be due to some passing derangement and our P\nthe chance of accidental occurrence\u2014is a measure of this likelihood.\nNow, in machines there may be said to be no error ; but if there\nwere\u2014as there is in obtaining reaction times from human subjects\n\u2014\nor if we weighed our butterscotch inaccurately, we would get a\nfalse measure of similarity ; but the longer we went on the more\nclosely would our estimate approximate to the true value and the\ndecreasing magnitude of P would be an indication of this.\nIt follows that, unless we are prepared to deny the propriety of\nregarding a subject under test as a response-producing mechanism,\nit is no use talking in an all-or-none sort of way (protopathically, as\nthe late Dr Rivers would have put it) about significant versus\ninsignificant similarities. We must recognise that these figures we\nhave calculated\u2014these z's\u2014are genuinely measures of the relation-\nships between the personalities, somewhat deformed by error, it is\ntrue, but accurate and reliable to the extent indicated by the asso-\nciated chance. And in so far as they differ between themselves they\nindicate corresponding differentiations within the psychological\nmanifold considered.\n25\nI do not know whether the reasoning in which I have just indulged\nwill have seemed convincing. If it has not, the reason, I venture to\nbelieve, is to be found only in my imperfect exposition.\nFortunately, it does not particularly matter ; for I am in a\nposition to adduce further facts which I think will be found sub-\nstantially conclusive.\nI have already mentioned that the technique of Analysis of\nVariance affords a test of difference as well as one of similarity.\nWhen we apply this test to the Leonard reaction time data we\nhave :\n2 P\nLF - - No difference observable (z is - -0531)\nLJ - - \u201e \u201e \u201e (0 is --1773)\nLE - - \u201e \u201e \u201e (2 is --1088)\nFJ - - -2266 -005 v.n., say 1 in 200\nFE - - -2063 -01 \u201e \u201e 1 \u201e 96\nJE - - No difference observable {z is - -1946)\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 197\nTaking tlie average diiferences in the way we did before we have :\n' F - . . . . .1266\nE - - - - - --0324\nJ - - - - - --0484\n\u2022 L - - - - - --1131\nIt will be seen that this order for difference is precisely opposite\nto that for similarity ; which is as it should be, if\u2014as seems natural\n\u2014the most markedly similar personalities are the least markedly\ndifferent. The chance of this effect arising by accident is, of course,\n1 in 24\u2014a comforting, if not compulsive, reassurance that the\nmeasures of similarity and of difference which we are studying are\nnot a \" fortuitous concourse \" of chance determined figures, but an\nordered assembly with, so to speak, a definite structure behind it.\nThe figures for reproduction test differences are somewhat curious :\nfor, although the differences shown are all feeble, they are all positive.\nI do not know what the chance is of this occurring by accident among\nsix partially interdependent quantities of this kind ; but it is clearly,\nI think, not more than 1 in 8, because we can choose (in several\ndifferent ways, as it happens) three ^dependent comparisons\u2014such\nas LF, LJ and LE\u2014the probability of any one of which being positive\nis one-half, on the assumption that chance alone is at work. Com-\nbining this with the above-mentioned chance of 1 in 24 we get a\ncombined chance of about 1 in 160, which makes us feel pretty\ncertain that there is some method in this madness.\nThe actual figuies for the differences are :\n2 P\nLF - -0437 About -31\nLJ - -0836 \u201e -23\nLB - -1542 \u201e -045\nFJ - -0712 \u201e -41\nFE - -1504 \u201e -05\nJE - -0390 \u201e -33\nThe average differences for personalities are :\nE - - - - - -1145\nL - - - - - -0938\nF - - - - - -0851\nJ - - - - - -0646\nand these show only a trilling correlation in the expected sense with\nthe corresponding figures for similarities. On the other hand,\namong the similarities and differences themselves we observe no\nfewer than three coincidences in rank (in the expected sense, of\ncourse) and the chance of this happening by accident is 1 in 18.\nThus we see that from all sides small contributions conspire to\n\f198 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\ngive us a strong assurance that we are dealing with an ordered\nsystem of differing relationships and not with a casual collocation\nof artifacts arising from the fortuitous incidence of error.\n26\nThe coercive evidence, however, is to be found in the reaction\ntime differences for FJ and FE. The chances of these being acci-\ndental were about 1 in 200 and 1 in 100 respectively, and it will be\nremembered that these comparisons gave also the smallest measures\nof similarity. I have, of course, checked these by the \" one or zero\n\"\nmethod mentioned in section 6 above and obtained confirmatory\nresults. *\u00b0\nNow these two comparisons are independent, in the sense that\nthere is no sort of reason, other than the existence of an inherent\nstructure such as we are interested in, why a difference between F\nand J should involve one between F and E.\nWe may accordingly combine them by the usual rules and we then\nhave a combined chance of only about 1 in 19,000 of there being no\nheterogeneity at all within the total mass of data.\nIt follows from this, to a very high order of probability, that the\nLeonard Quartet, if I may so describe it, is 7wt\u2014like Minkowski's\nSpace-Time\n\u2014\" a homogeneous four-dimensional manifold \" but\nthat there are highly significant heterogeneities within it.\nThis should dispose of any lingering objections that may still be\nfelt as to the propriety of treating the differences between similarities\nas validly informative results, even if my ad hoc argument by\nanalogy with automatic machines has failed to carry conviction.\n27\nI must mention here that, in addition to the six quadruple\nsittings just described, we carried out an entirely separate set of\nexperiments with the Leonard personalities, dictated by my early\nfear that the reaction times were too long and too obscured by error\nto give reliable results.\nFor this second set of experiments,*- I used a different and\u2014if I\nmay put it so\u2014a much \" stronger \" list of words, containing many\nmore of marked general interest, and this fact alone would prevent\nus from expecting precisely parallel results. I also asked Mr\nDrayton Thomas to do his best to speed up the reactions ; and this\nhe did effectively, for the mean time for all personalities dropped\nfrom 4-5 to 3-1 seconds.** On the other hand, it proved possible to\nuse only fifty words instead of seventy-five and to obtain only four\ninstead of six sittings.\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 199\nThe results obtained accordingly bear but little resemblance to\nthose from the main set of experiments,*^ and these results are of\nlow reliability, so that this work is mainly of interest in showing\nthat a total of only 200 observations from each subject is not likely\nto afford a firm basis for future investigations.\nNone the less, one or two points of interest emerge, which seem\nworth mentioning. For example, J and E still show the strongest\nsimilarity, not only on the reproduction test as formerly but also\non the reaction times. J's dominance of the group asserts itself here\nin respect of reaction times and not of reproductions, where he drops\nto third place ; and F retains her position at the bottom of the\nreaction-time list, thus tending to confirm the suspicion that there\nis something aberrant about her when an element of word-selection\nis involved.\n28\nI should like to suggest, at this point, somewhat parenthetically,\nthat it should be possible to extract yet more information from these\nfacts, and those yet to be given, by a process of systematic inter-\ncomparison. We might develop an argument, or series of argu-\nments, somewhat on the lines \" If the similarity between A and B\nis greater than that between B and C, and if the difference between\nA and C is less than that between B and D, then . . . etc.\" Such a\nprocedure systematically applied would presumably disclose cer-\ntain inconsistencies within the nexus of relationships considered\nand it should be possible to decide what scheme of similarities and\ndifferences calls for a minimum distortion of the figures given,\nallowing for the fact that they are of differing reliability as indicated\nby their associated P's (or the ratios of the to their standard\nerrors which determine these).\nThis appears to call for a mixture of logic and mathematics beyond\nmy present powers ; but I fancy it might prove a valuable line of\ninvestigation.\n29\nThe foregoing pretty well clinches, I think, the case for the\nexistence of marked and genuine diiferences between the com-\nponents of the Leonard group ; but I have yet to present what are,\nperhaps, the most striking of all the results I have obtained. The\ncircumstances which led to them were as follows :\nWhen I first began work on the analysis of the Leonard data I was\nmuch perplexed to find so many resemblances as those I have\ndescribed. I had not then formulated the technique which later\ni\nenabled me to distinguish the personalities, and the contrast between\n'\nthis considerable measure of similarity and the marked difference\nobserved between Garrett and Uvani was very puzzling.\n\f200 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nIt was an almost casual, but none the less valuable, remark by\nMr Drayton Thomas that set me on what appears to be substantially\nthe right track. In one of his letters, he mentioned what he termed\nMrs Leonard's \" personal preparation for a sitting \" and suggested\nthat this might result in the reactions taken in what was supposed to\nbe her normal state being not, in fact truly normal.\nI at once asked that a further six sets of Leonard reactions should\nbe collected in circumstances calculated, so far as possible, to ensure\na genuinely normal condition and, in particular, as far removed as\npracticable from any of Mr Thomas' own sittings. Mr Drayton\nThomas most kindly concurred in this proposal and further enlisted\nthe services of two friends, Mr W. H. Wilson and the Rev. G. C.\nBatten, to assist in the work.

We conclude, therefore, that some highly\nsignificant change is wrought in Mrs Leonard's psychical constitution\nby the process of preparation referred to.\nWhen we compare Normal Leonard with J, it is interesting to\nnote that there is still a considerable measure of similarity and only\nan insignificant trace of difference, as compared with an overwhelm-\ning similarity and no difference at all in the case of Prepared Leonard.\nThe comparative figures are :\nSimilarity Difference\nZ P 3 P\nL(N) & J - -2546 -013 -0444 -32\nL(P) & J - -3445 -002 v.n. - -1773 \u2014\nIn the case of E we find a negligible similarity and an equally\nnegligible difference ; the two personalities are even more neutral to\neach other than the two varieties of Leonard.

The influence of the J\nfactor extends even to normal Leonard states ; but this is not\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 203\nunreasonable on any hypothesis. Mediums are often described as\n\" sensitives \" and it is certainly likely that they owe their gifts,\nwhatever the explanation of these may be, to a susceptibility which\nmore ordinary people do not share. It seems to me inevitable\nthat the mere fact of doing a test, even in her normal state, after\nhaving done so many with Mr Drayton Thomas, would arouse in\nMrs Leonard's mind, or attract to it, whatever influences are operat-\ning in the Thomas sittings.\nThe E factor is closely linked with J, and it seems to me that the\nresemblances noted between L and E, such as they are, arise more\nbecause E is like J and J dominates L than because E and L resemble\neach other. Note how E escapes from L as it were when J's influence\nis weak, as in the reproduction test with Normal Leonard.\nF seems to occupy a somewhat intermediate position. Her\nallegiance appears to oscillate between L and J according to circum-\nstances and her connection with E seems to follow her connection\nwith J. But the reaction times distinguish her very sharply from\nNormal Leonard.\n33\nUnfortunately, I cannot very well end this paper without a few\nwords on the thorny subject of interpretation, even though I am\nmuch more interested in illustrating a method than in drawing\nconclusions from these applications of it.\nThus, although I am above all things anxious that we should\nmaintain a conservative policy and develop this kind of work on a\nbasis of reasoning from present knowledge rather than of guessing\nfrom present ignorance, it would be mere cowardice if I did not\npoint out some of the difiiculties which would embarrass any\nattempt to explain these facts in the light of current psychological\nconceptions.\nLet us see what we can make of it on orthodox lines.\nWe might start by saying that the work of Prince and Peterson\nwas on too small a scale to be very weighty, and we might go on by\nsaying that the condition under which Rudi appears to play the part\nof Olga is not a trance at all. Both these points are debatable, but\nwe will not bother about that now.\nThis procedure enables us to suggest that the yielding of signi-\nficantly dissimilar reactions is a regular feature of multiple persona-\nlity. I do not in the least know how we could reconcile such a\ncontention, and all that it implies, with the rest of our knowledge\nof how subconscious content constantly influences behaviour. But\nI doubt not that there would be found, let us say, here or there a\npsychoanalyst hardy enough to undertake the task, for are not\nsome of these true sons of Habbakuk\n\u2014\ncapable de tout ?\n\f204 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [pabt\nBut I think that even the hardiest and most successful expositor\nmight find himself in a quandary if he were then asked, \" Well\nthen, by what criterion do you define individual minds as different ?\n\"\nIf he replies, \" By the criterion of having different bodies,\" he begs\nthe whole question at issue and is ipsofacto unfitted for human inter-\ncourse, while, if he says, \" By the criterion of having differing sub-\nconscious content,\" he will be reminded that this is just what he has\nbeen attempting to explain away. I think his only chance would\nbe to maintain that\u2014in the case of Mrs Garrett, for example\u2014there\nare \" really,\" if we only knew it, duphcate brains and nervous\nsystems which are switched into and out of action by the process\nof going into trance.\nPersonally, I consider this sort of thing to be fantastic to the\npoint of absurdity and calculated to arouse only the ribald laughter\nof instructed persons ; but I suppose that as a most desperate pis\naller it might satisfy the prejudiced and the ignorant for a time.\nBut I cannot imagine what our supposed apologist would do when\nhe came to the Leonard material and found himself confronted with\nthis strange medley of personalities, resembling each other in some\nrespects, differing in others, in varying degrees and according to\ncircumstances\u2014for all the world as if they were really four different\nconsciousnesses each interpenetrating the other to some extent.\nAbove all, he will find it awkward to explain how it comes about that\na personality which gives so perfect a rendering of a distinguished\nWesleyan Divine, contrives to dominate the scene and to be, as it\nwere, plus royaliste que le Roi\u2014more normal than Normal Leonard\nherself.\nI fear he will be driven to the conclusion that I must have calcu-\nlated the whole thing backwards like a cinema-film reversed.\n34\nOn the other hand, for anyone who likes to be bold enough to\nentertain the hypothesis that the personalities are what they purport\nto be, the whole thing becomes simple enough. And it is simpler\nstill if we rid our minds of the antiquated notion that consciousnesses\nare some sort of discrete entities which can be isolated in psychical\npreserving jars and neatly labelled L and F and J and E.\nOnce our thought is freed from this kind of hmitation, it is easy\nenough to imagine the temporary formation of a corporate or\ncomposite personality or consciousness in which each member\naffects the others though each is uppermost when in control of the\nmedium. On such lines as these, I find, everything falls readily\ninto place ; the dominance of J\u2014a man of strong character in life ;\nthe affinity with E, his daughter and for many years his close\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 205\ncompanion ; the consistent least similarity of F to the others when\nword-selection is involved ; the influence of the strong-minded and\ninterested J on the normal but always sensitive L ; and the negligible\neffect of the less interested F in the same circumstances\u2014all \"fit\ntogether into a coherent pattern as neatly as the pieces of a well made\npuzzle.\n35\nNone the less, although what I have just said seems to me scarcely\nto be denied, I want to make it perfectly clear that nothing whatever\nin the facts I have presented entitles anyone to claim\u2014as some\nenthusiasts are sure to do, however plainly I warn them\u2014that this\nwork \" proves human survival \" or even \" demonstrates the exist-\nence of discarnate entities.\" Let it be clearly understood that\nit does neither the one nor the other, and any claim that it does\nwill constitute a grossly imwarrantable extrapolation from the\nfacts.\nIt is perfectly true that the facts are easier to explain if we make\ncertain tremendous assumptions of a spiritistic nature ; but this\ndoes not constitute proof. It may be merely an indication of our\nown psychological ignorance, just as at one time it was found easiest\nto explain simple astronomical occurrences by supposing the sun\nto be swallowed by a monster every night and regurgitated every\nmorning.\nDiscarnate consciousnesses may exist : I think that they do.\nHuman survival of death may be a fact in Nature : I think that it is.\nIt may even become strictly demonstrable : I believe that it will.\nBut however true these propositions may be, not one of them follows\nfrom the facts I have described in this paper.\nAll that I claim that these facts show is, first, that the Word\nAssociation test\u2014properly applied and its data properly analysed\n\u2014\naffords a most powerful instrument for the study of the problems\nwhich confront us ;\nand, second, that in order to cope with the facts\nelicited we may well be obliged to revise somewhat extensively our\ntheories concerning multiple personality.\nAnd I want to insist that, despite the difficulties I have indicated,\nit is from this starting point of multiple personality\u2014of which as\npsychologists we know a good deal\u2014and not from that of discarnate\nentities\u2014of which as psychologists we know nothing at all\u2014that\nthe study of these phenomena must be developed,\nj\nWhen, if ever, we succeed in obtaining significantly similar\n'\nreactions from the same ostensible communicator through two\ni\ndifferent mediums, we may begin to talk about discarnate entities,\nI And when, if ever, we obtain from a supposed communicator,\nthrough a medium, reactions significantly similar to those he gave\no\n\f206 Whately Caringion, M.A., M.Sc.

These instruments are very\ncompact, being self-contained and fitted with a translucent scale\nonly some 6\" or so from the mirror.)\n207\n\f208 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nSince, in this class of work, we are negligibly interested in the\nactual resistance of the subject, but only in the relative sizes of\nchanges of resistance, the bridge was built up of \" commercial\n\"\ngrade resistance units, costing only a shilling or two apiece, instead\nof using expensive precision resistances.\nDry batteries were fitted giving, by means of a two-way switch,\na nominal three or six volts across the bridge. The actual voltage\napplied at any moment could be read by means of a simple volt-\nmeter mounted on the operating panel. This precaution is im-\nportant.\nThese batteries also supplied the galvanometer lamp and an\nadditional small lamp for the use of the operator.\nThe electrode leads (of ordinary \" flex \") were arranged to plug\ninto sockets in the side of the containing case.\nThe sensitivity control of the galvanometer consisted of a\n1000 ohm resistance connected in parallel with it, one lead to the\ngalvanometer traversing this resistance ; thus sensitivity was a\nmaximum when the galvanometer was shunted by the whole 1000\nohms.\nThe sensitivity indications on the control dial were, accordingly,\ncorrect in general only for the external resistance (4000 ohms) at\nwhich the bridge was calibrated for sensitivity. The following\ntable shows the sensitivity factors for other external resistances.\nTable I\nSetting on Control Dial\nExternal\nResistance,\n(ohms)\n3\/4 1,2 1\/3 1\/5 1\/8 1\/10 1\/20\n1,000 1-7 2-6 3-8 6-3 9-5 11 20\n2,000 1-5 2-3 3-4 5-6 8-7 10 20\n4,000 1-33 2-0 3-33 5-0 8-0 10 20\n7,000 1-33 1-7 2-6 4-4 7-1 9-0 20\n9,000 1-33 1-6 2-5 4-2 6'9 8-7 20\netc. etc.\nThese and similar factors were, of course, used in reducing the\ndeflexions observed to standard form.

This is an absurd case, of\ncourse, but will serve as a starting point.\nNext, suppose that the two personalities differ in the sole respect\nthat one is, say. twice as \" reactive \" as the other ;\nbut that, again,\nthere is no kind of error and that the words have all the same equal\nsignificance for both subjects. In this all the entries in either block\nwill be the same, but all those in one will be double those in the other.\nThis case does not particularly interest us and we will neglect it\nhere.\nNow, suppose that there is still no error, and that the personalities\nare identically similar ; but that the different words have a varying\nsignificance {ex hypothesi, for both subjects alike).

This last is the quantity in which we\nare interested.\nIn order, therefore, to judge the extent to which the two per-\nsonalities are similar we must compare the variation of the entries\nunder \" Sum \" with that of the entries under \" Difference \"\n;\nbecause, if the former is large compared with the latter, we shall\nknow that the differentness of the words, rather than that of the\npersonalities, is mainly responsible for whatever variation is found\nin the \" Difference \" column.\nNow, in statistical practice, for reasons which I shall not attempt\nto explain, variations of this kind are always measured by taking\nthe sum of the squares of the quantities concerned from their mean\nvalue (or some derivative of this, such as its value divided by the\nnumber of quantities or the square root of this last\u2014known as the\n\" standard error \" or \" standard deviation \").\nThe quickest way of calculating this quantity is to use the formula\nS{x-x)^=Sx-{) -xS{x)\nwhere S{x -x)^ stands for \" the sum of the squares of the quantities\nfrom their mean,\" S(x-) for \" the sum of the squares of the quan-\ntities \" and xS{x) for \" the sum of the quantities multiplied by their\nmean.\" {N.B. Since x equals tlie sum of the quantities divided by\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 213\ntheir number, it follows that the quickest and most accurate way of\ncomputing this quantity is to take the sum of the quantities, square\nit, and divide by the number of quantities.)\nThis procedure is used for calculating all \" sums of squares.\"\n{N.B. The abbreviation \" sum of squares \" is habitually used for the\nexpanded expression \" sum of squares of difference's from the\nmean.\")\nIn order, then, to compare two personalities for similarity, we\nstart by working the quantity S{x - x)^ first for the \" Sum \" column\nand then for the \" Difference \" column.\nIn the infantile example given in Table III we have :\nSums Differences\nS(x) - 580 S{x) - 0\nS{x^) - 89,000 S(a;2) - 400\nfS(.r) - 84,100 xS{x) - 0\nS{x-x)'^ - 4,900 S{x-x)- - 400\nIn order to reduce these values to a \" standard form,\" so to\nspeak, independent of the number of observations on which they\nare based, we must divide each by the number of contributing\nentries\u2014^in this case 10, because there are 5 entries in each of the\ntwo rows which go to build up any given Sum or Difference. In\ngeneral, we divide by 2n', where n' is the number of occasions\n(sittings) involved.\nFurther, we must obtain a magnitude which is not at the\nmercy of the number of words used. To get this we do not\ndivide by n, the number of words, but by n-1, because there are\nonly n-1 independent comparisons which can be made between\nwords.\nThe result of the fijst process is to give us the \" sum of squares\n\"\nfor the entries considered, and of the second to give us the \" Mean\nSquare.\"\nThus, by dividing by 10 in the above case, we obtain 490 and 40\nfor the \" sums of squares \" for the Sums and Differences respectively;\nwhile a further division by 3 {N.B. There are only four words, so\nthat n - 1 is 3) gives us 163-3333 and 13-3333 respectively.\nNow the first of these, as already indicated, depends on the\nvarying effect produced by the differing significance of the ivords,\nand we may therefore speak of it as the Sum of Squares for Words,\ndenoting it by W, and the corresponding Mean Square by\nMS.W. The second depends on the differential effect of words on\nthe personalities, so that we may call it the Sum of Squares for\nWord-cum-Personality, denoting it by \\'VT ; the Mean Square\nwill similarly be MS.WP.\n\f214 Whately Garington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nThe next step is to divide MS.W by MS.WP, which gives, in this\ncase 12-25.\nFor mathematical reasons given in Professor Fisher's book we\nnext look up the natural logarithm (the logarithm to base e) of this\nand halve it. Thus :\nLog, 12-25 2-5055\n1 \u201e \u201e 1-25275\nThis quantity is known as z and is the measure of the similarity\nbetween the two personalities.\nBut we now want to know how much it is worth, and inasmuch\nas in this case it is based on only four words we shall not expect it\nto be worth very much, although \" as z's go,\" so to speak, it is a\nhigh value.\nNow it can be shown {loc. cit.) that the standard error of such a z is\nequal to the square root of the reciprocal of the number of indepen-\ndent comparisons (technically known as \" degrees of freedom \")\nwhich can be made between the quantities from which it is derived ;\nthat is to say, in this kind of case, between the numbers of words.\nAs there are only four words in this case the standard error will\nbe the square root of 1\/3 which is -5774 very nearly.\nWe accordingly divide z by this standard error (commonly known\nas Oz) and look up the value of P corresponding to it in a table\ngiving the deviation of the normal distribution ^ in terms of the\nstandard deviation [e.g., loc. cit., Table I).\nIn this case we have :\nz\/cr, =2-1695.\nReference to the table shows us that the corresponding value of\nP is almost exactly -03. But this must be halved, because it only\nrepresents the chance of getting a z of this magnitude by accident,\nwhereas we want to know the chance of getting one not only of this\nmagnitude but also of this sign ; for there is nothing in the mathe-\nmatics to prevent z being negative.\nSo we end up with\nz = 1-25275, P = -015.\nWe may interpret this result as meaning that there is a strong\nsimilarity between the two personalities, which is fairly\u2014but not\noverwhelmingly\u2014reliable, for there are about 15 chances in 1000 of\nits being accidental.\nAs an alternative to the last part of the procedure, we may use\nProfessor Fisher's Tables, which give the values of z, for various\nnumbers of degrees of freedom for the two Mean Squares concerned\nat the two points P -05 and P -01. {N.B. It is a more or less arbitrary\n^ N.B. z is normally distributed.\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 215\nconvention that anything yielding a chance of -01 or less is considered\ndefinitely significant, anything between -01 and -05 as semi-signi-\nficant, and anything greater than -05 as non-significant.)\nIn actual word-association test practice, of course, where the\nnumbers of degrees of freedom for W and WP are always equal , it\nis quicker (and more accurate) not to work the mean squares but\nto divide one 2w'W by 2n'WP straight away. In the example we\nshould divide 4,900 by 400 without reducing them to 163-3333 and\n13-3333 first.\nIn practice, also, where 50, 75 or more words are used, the figures\nare very much heavier. The following is an example from actual\nwork.\nCase : L(P) and F. 75 words, 6 sittings.\nDo\/12 212,829 = W Do\/12 123,047 =WP\nDo\/74 1,662-8 = MS.WP\nW\/WP 1-7297\n2 -2740\no, -11625\nzja^ 2-35704. P is more than -01 and less than -02.\nTo recapitulate : In order to test two personalities for similarity,\nproceed as follows :\nWrite down the observations in rows and columns as shown in\nthe illustrative tables above. Add the entries in each row for each\npersonality, thus obtaining the \" Personality Word Totals \" given\nunder T and T'. Sum these by words for the two personalities,\nobtaining the figures under \" Sum.\" Subtract the right-hand word\ntotal (say) from the left, writing down the (algebraic) difference\nunder \" Difference \". Check all this by the ordinary methods of\nsumming columns, etc.\nWork the sum of the squares of the differences from their mean\nof the entries under \" Sum \". Do the same for entries under\n\" Difference \" (algebraic mean, of course).\nDivide the result for Sums by that for Difi^erences (this is short-\ncircuiting the process of reducing to Mean Squares). Find the\nnatural logarithm of this quotient. Halve it. This gives z, the\nmeasure of similarity you want.\nSubtract one from the number of words used. Find the reciprocal\nof the resulting number. Find the square root of this.

Look up the value of P in a table of normal deviates. Halve\nthis. The result is the chance that the observed similarity is\naccidental.\nThe process of testing for difference is not so easy as the foregoing\ntest for similarity ; nor is it so easy to describe or explain.\nWe will start by saying, very colloquially, that \" Error is the\nextent to which the same things don't happen under (apparently)\nthe same conditions \", and will add that, if there is no error (as in\nthe idealised examples given above) any difference observed is\nabsolute and cannot be attributed to chance, accident or error at\nall. because there is no error to which to attribute it.\nIn these examples, it will be noted, each personality is shown as\ngiving precisely the same reaction to a given word on every occasion.\nIn practice, this is far from being the case, however carefully we\ntry to ensure that experimental conditions are the same. The\nresult is that, instead of such figures as\n19 19 19 19 19 and 17 17 17 17 17\nfor personalities X and Y respectively, we get something like\n19 23 15 18 20 and 16 18 15 21 15\nThe point to notice here is that although each entry for X in the\nfijst case differs from the corresponding entry for Y, this difference\nis constant, namely 2 ; whereas in the second case the differences\nvary being, in fact,\n3 5 0 -3 5\nIn the first case, the constant difference is due to the fact that the\nword has a different exciting power on the two personalities ; in\nthe second, the varying difference is due to the distortion of this\neffect (if any) by error and whatever systematic difference of effect\nmay be produced on the personalities by the fact that the occasion,\nas such, is different for the several pairs of observations.\nIt is, therefore, the magnitude of this variation in difference\nbetween corresponding pairs of entries that interests us when we are\ntrying to determine whether the difference between personalities\n(indicated by the magnitude of the Mean Square for WP calculated\nabove) is attributable to Error or not.\nIn principle, then, the first step of the procedure is to take the\ncorresponding pairs of entries for each word, subtract (algebraically)\nthe one from the other, as just shown, and calculate the sum of\nsquares of deviations from their mean of these differences. This\nsum of squares must then be divided by 2, because two entries\ncontribute to each variate\u2014just as in calculating W and WP we\ndivided by 2n' . Thus in the case just indicated, the (algebraic)\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 217\nmean of the differences obtained by subtraction is 2 and the sum of\nthe squares of their differences from it is 48, which divided by 2\ngives 24. This is the contribution, so to speak, made by this word\nto the total variation due to change of occasion and personality\ntogether with error.\nWe must therefore repeat the process with each word, when, by\nsumming all these contributions we shall obtain the total variation\ndue to these causes.\nIn practice this is intolerably laborious and very liable to error ;\nthe following is the best procedure I have been able to devise.\nTaking the analogue of Table III (in which, of course, the entries\nfor each word for either personality will, in general, vary), write\ndown the algebraic differences between corresponding pairs for the\nvarious occasions by inspection as we did in the elementary example\njust worked. We thus obtain figures such as these (taken from\nactual work) :\nSitting\n:\nI II Ill IV V Total\nWord\n1 -92 -53 -9 -77 59 -172\n2 26 -82 38 -41 -19 - 78\n3 111 0 -65 -62 -41 - 57\n4 -43 55 3 69 61 + 145\netc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.\nThe totals on the right should agree with the corresponding\nentries in the \" Difference \" column (see Table III) which were\nused in computing WP, and this fact? affords a most valuable check\nboth on the subtractions by inspection here involved and the\noriginal summing of the data for W and WP working.\nWhen these figures have been written down for all words, find the\nsum of the squares of the lot. This is best done by columns direct\non the machine, either using it to do the squaring for one (in the case\nof heavy figures) or working by a mixture of tables and memory for\nsmaller figures.\nFrom the sum of squares thus obtained subtract the value of\nS{x'^) which was used in computing WP, divided by the number of\noccasions [sittings) used {yi'). Divide the result by 2. Application\nof elementary algebra will show that this gives precisely the same\nanswer as the formal ritual previously described where the sum\nof squares of differences from the mean is computed for each\nword separately. It is incomparably quicker and less liable to\nmistakes.\nWe thus obtain a new S{x -x)- to the treatment of which we will\nreturn after a short digression.\n\f218 Whately Gariyigton, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nAs already indicated, the variations we have just been considering\ninchide any systematic variations due to the differential effects of\noccasion on personality. For example, a warmer day might\nstimulate one personality with respect to all words and depress the\nother. The variation thus introduced must be subtracted from the\nquantity which we have just found before we can decide how much\nof the latter consists of true Error of the kind that interests us.\nThe occasion-cum-personality contribution in question may be\ndenoted by OP and calculated as follows :\nSum the columns headed I, II, III, etc. (that is to say, the \" occa-\nsion columns \") for each personality and subtract the corresponding\ntotals one from another, just as we did for the corresponding pairs\nof entries in the case of the individual words. Thus we might have :\nX Y\nOccasion: I II III IV V I II III IV V\nTotal: 257 129 365 238 164 264 132 368 246 180\nand the differences between corresponding totals would be\n-7 -3 -3 -8 -16.\nWork the sum of the squares of the differences of these from their\nmean, which here comes to 113-2. But to the formation of each\ndifference there contribute 2n entries, where n is the number\nof words as before. Consequently we must divide by 2n in order\nto get the proper value of OP. If, as was often the case in my work,\nwe are using 75 words, we divide by 150 and in this case we should\nobtain for OP the fantastically low value of 113-2\/150 or -7547.\nThis quantity, then, whatever it may be, represents the contribu-\ntion made by occasion-cum-personality to the total discrepancies\nbetween corresponding pairs of entries. We therefore subtract it\nfrom the S{x-x) last calculated (from the differences of correspond-\ning pairs), thus obtaining a new quantity, called OWP (occasion-\ncum-word-cum-personality) which is Error for our purpose.\nBut in order to obtain from this a quantity comparable with WP\n(which, it will be remembered, is our index to the extent to which\nthe personalities differ) we must again divide by the appropriate\nnumber of degrees of freedom so as to obtain a Mean Square for\nOWP for comparison with MS.WP.\nThis number is given by {n-l){n' -1) where n and n', as pre-\nviously, are the numbers of words and occasions respectively. Thus,\nif there are 75 words and 6 sittings we divide by 370. This division\ngives MS.OWP. We divide MS.WP by it, just as we divided (in the\nstrict procedure) MS.W by MS.WP, and derive a z and a P in\nprecisely the same manner as before.\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 219\nThe following is an example from actual work :\nCase : F and J (Reaction Times) : 75 words ; six sittings.\nWP OWP\nS{x)= -525 S(x2) = 1,581,419\nS(a;2) = 2,273,241 divided by six = 378,873-5\nxS{x) = __3fiT5 S(x-j;)2 = 1,202,545-5\nS(x-:c)2 = 2,269,566 Do\/2= 601,272-7\nDo\/12 = 189,130 =WP 0P= 226-3\nDo\/74 = 2,555-8 = MS.WP OWP= 601,046-4\nDo\/370 = 1.624-4\nMS.WP\/MS.OWP= 1-5734\nz= -2266\n= -09 very nearly.\nz\/(T,= 2-5188\nWhence P is found to be -005, very nearly.\n{Note.

Unless it is actively\ndesired to qualify for the sweet security of a mad-house, it is futile\nto attempt such computations on any considerable scale w^ithout\na suitable calculating machine.\nI did about two-thirds or more of my own work on a hand-driven\nmachine and would never do so again. An electrically driven model\nis virtually essential.\nIt is hopelessly slow and very error-liable to look up large squares\nin tables and add them on the machine ; the big summings of\nsquares for W (and usually for WP also) should be done direct on the\nmachine, which must accordingly accumulate products\u2014as practi-\ncally all do. The machine should also \" accumulate multipliers \",\nso that at the end of such a summation of squares the sum of one\nset of factors is available as a check against omissions. This, how-\never, necessitates double dials (as in the Monroe KA 163 or MA. 3. 173)\nbecause without them the individual squarings cannot be safely done.\nBest of all is a machine such as the Rheinmetal SA. lie with full\nautomatic multiplication in addition to accumulation of multipliers.\nThis greatly reduces the strain on the operator and correspondingly\nminimizes liability to error and necessity of repeated checking.\n\fAPPENDIX III\nTECHNICAL NOTES\nN.B. It would be almost miraculous if, in the single-handed computa-\ntion of so formidable a mass of material, offering many thousands of\nopportunities for error, no minor slips should remain undetected.\nI have, however, applied the ordinary checks to all calculations and\nspecial checks to those of critical importance ; and I am confident that,\nalthough a complete and faultless re-working might possibly lead to\nalterations in, say, the second or third place of decimals in some of the\nvalues given, no substantial change in the results would be found\nnecessary. W. W. C.\n1. This is not to say that no work has been done on the psycho-\nlogical characteristics of trance personalities ; Mrs Sidgwick's\nmonumental study of the psychology of Mrs Piper's Trance {Proc.\nS.P.R., xxviii.) is an outstanding example, while the particular\nobservation that \" Phinuit \", though claiming to be a French doctor,\nhad a negligible knowledge of either French or Medicine, belongs to\nthe same category. But no such work, that I know of, contains the\nall-important quantitative element.\n2. The proper word is clearly \" psychometrical \" ; but this has\nunfortunately long been used to refer to a class of paragnostic\nphenomena into which no metrical element enters. It is for con-\nsideration whether it would not be well boldly to adopt the term for\nthe kind of method here discussed, which does consist in obtaining\nmetrical attributes of the \" psyche \", and to find a more appropriate\nterm for the variety of paragnosis concerned.\n3. Cf. Jung, Studies in Word Association, 1918.\n4. \"... subconscious or unconscious. ...\" I use the words\ninterchangeably except that \" unconscious \" indicates a lesser\naccessibility and a greater difficulty of exhumation.

This may reinforce or diminish the\neffect of the resistance change proper, but we cannot tell this\nby looking at the galvanometer. Hence the use of the word\n\" apparent \".\n8. We may take the deflexions as being proportional to the\nvoltage on the bridge, for any given change of resistance, and correct\nby dividing the deflexion observed by the quotient of the voltage\nused by that at which the bridge was calibrated\u2014in this case 3 volts.\nThe sensitivity correction depends on the actual construction of the\napparatus ; see Appendix I.\n9. Actually the same kind of consideration does apply to some\nextent to psychogalvanic reflexes.\nThis is not due, as might at first be supposed, to the deflexion\nbeing an \" unknown function \" of the magnitude of psychical\ndisturbance in which we are interested ; for it does not seem\npossible to define the extent of the disturbance except in terms of the\nmeasurements we make on it\u2014any more than we can define physical\nobjects in any terms other than those of the measurements which,\ndirectly or indirectly, we make on them.\nBut introspection shows that the psychogalvanic reflex may be\nmisleadingly increased by a process best described as regeneration,\ne.g. the subject may first be embarrassed (say) by the word and then\nmuch more so by his own embarrassment. This latter effect may\nbe determined by local circumstances, such as the person of the\nexperimenter, and is not therefore necessarily a measure of the\nintrinsic excitingness of the word.\nSpecial research on the optimum \" cut off point \" for psycho-\ngalvanic reflexes is accordingly needed ; but fortunately no sig-\nnificant difference dependent on them arises in the course of this\nwork.\n10. The \" median \" is that value of the variate above and below\nwhich values occur in equal numbers. It is identical with the mean\nonly in symmetrical distributions. Thus in the distribution\nM, 11, 8, 12, 10, 9, 13, the value 11 is both mean and median ; while\nfor the series 4, 12, 11, 12, 14, 9, 13, 10, 6, the median is 11, but the\nmean 10-101 . . . etc. The median is also known as the \" probable\nmean \".\n11.

I also counted the corre-\nsponding frequencies for the first and last fifty words in each case.\nThe correlation between the frequencies for the whole of G with\nthe whole of U was -7309 ; and for G (1-50) with G (51-100) it was\n\u20227158. But this high correlation between G and U is largely due\nto the restrictions imposed by the numbers of words available\nbeginning with the different letters. I accordingly took the average\nfrequencies of these as indicated by three different dictionaries and\nobtained correlations with these dictionary values of -6434 for\nG (1-50), -7764 for G (51-100), -6807 for G and -8467 for U. Elimi-\nnating the \" dictionary effect \" by the usual method of partial\ncorrelation, I obtained a figure of -4482 for G (1-50) and G (51-100)\nand one of -3955 for all G with all U. The former represents the\nconsistency of Garrett in this matter, apart from the influence of the\nlanguage, and the latter the agreement of G with U. Neither is\nhighly significant, while the difference between them is neghgibly\nso. The test accordingly fails, but seems worthy of a mention on\ngrounds of general interest.\n13. It seems convenient to interpolate here a note of warning\nagainst a mistake to which some might be liable and a fallacy in\nwhich many frequently indulge.\nFirst : Any test which does, in fact, significantly distinguish\npersonalities, is ipso facto a valid test, and over-rides any number\nwhich fail to do so. The test of counting legs, for example, would\nseldom enable us to distinguish normal persons, though it might\nwork for senile millipedes ; and the same applies (with reservations)\nto the teeth of young healthy persons, as also to fingers and toes.\nBut if these tests failed we should none the less accept the results\ngiven by comparing Bertillon measurements, supposing these to\nindicate difference.\nSecond : It is commonly but erroneously maintained that \" no\nnumber of negative results can outweigh one positive result.\" This\nis not true. When I say that the chance of a phenomenon occurring\naccidentally is p, this is equivalent to saying that ^\/pure chance alone\nis at work the phenomenon will occur, on the average, once in p\ntrials. And it may be that we have, to speak colloquially, struck\njust that pth occasion at the first shot. Hence the importance of\nknowing the value of p ;\nfor, if this is fairly large, such as -2 for\nexample, our assurance that we have not done so is correspondingly\nslight.\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 223\n14.

If this precaution is omitted the\nearly words of the list are apt to give unduly large effects, notably\nas regards psychogalvanic reflexes. The mere fact of being\ntested renders the subject especially susceptible until he gets used\nto it.\nIt was presumably a failure to realise this fact and to allow for it\nthat led Wechsler and Jones {cf. Psychological Bulletin, 1927,\npp. 173-4), using eight of the most exciting and eight of the least\nexciting words taken from my own earlier results, to conclude\nthat position in the list was of great importance. As the starting\neffect, so to speak, may well continue for just about six or eight\nwords, it is not surprising that working with a list of only 16\nwords, without preliminaries, they should have reached this con-\nclusion.\n\f224 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nIn these early experiments I used only five preliminary words\n(c\/. The Measurement of Emotion, p. 31, which. Wechsler and Jones\npresumably have not read) ; but that these were enough for\nmy contemporary purpose is shown by the fact that if the order in\nwhich the words were given is correlated with the order of mag-\nnitude of the mean corrected deflexion for my whole 50 sub-\njects (which Wechsler and Jones clearly did not trouble to do),\nwe obtain a coefficient of only - -08, which shows that order\nhad, on the whole, an utterly insignificant effect on the results\nobtained.\nThe value of the criticism may be estimated from the following\nflat contradiction (Psy. Bull., loc. cit.) :\n\" The difi^erence between earlier and later position is much\ngreater in the case of emotionally toned (critical) than in the non-\nemotionally toned (non-critical) words. For example, when the\nword '\ntable '\noccurs at the head of the list, the deflexion it elicits\nis on the average eight times that when placed at the end ; but the\nword '\nkiss '\nhas a deflexion only 20 per cent, greater when placed\nat the beginning than when placed at the end.\" (My italics.\nW.

In order to localise, so far as possible, the effect of any\nbreakdowns in the trance or the experimental technique, the words\nwere handled in blocks of 25 as above and the changes of order were\nmade within the block. Six orders determined by a simple plan\nwere used. No personality received the words in the same order\ntwice ; but each received them in each of the orders once. The\nsame order was not used twice at a double sitting.\nThe object of this varying of the order was primarily to prevent\nsubjects getting warning from one word of which was coming next,\nbut also to minimise the effects of \" perseveration \" where the effect\nproduced by one word \" carries over \" to the word or words\nfollowing.\n16. I conducted, however, a short ad hoc study of these negative\ndeflexions in connection with a point which arose in preparing my\nreview (q.v.) of Mr Hereward Carrington's work on this medium.\nI should like to emphasise here that the occurrence of these numerous\nnegative deflexions is no kind of reflection on Mrs Garrett's bona\nfides.\n17.

It will be noticed that although the consistencies of the two\npersonalities fluctuate violently we never get anything approaching\na noteworthy agreement between them.)\n19. To test the difference between any two of the above co-\nefficients for significance w^e may proceed as follows [cf. Fisher,\nStatistical Methods for Research Workers, p. 182).\nConvert the coefficients into the quantities called \" z \"s by the\nformula\n2 = i{log,(l+r)-log,(l-r)}\nwhere r is the coefficient of correlation concerned and e the base of\nnatural logarithms, as usual. Find the standard error of each z by\ntakmg the reciprocal of three less than the number of pairs of\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 227\nvariates concerned. Subtract the lesser from the greater z and\nfind the standard error of this difference by summing the two\nreciprocals just obtained and taking the square root of this sum.\nDivide the difference of the z's by this and look up the chance of\ngetting such a result by accident in a suitable table, e.g. loc. cit.,\nTable I.\nExample : Take GG and GU for the second entry in the left hand\nhalf of Table II above.\nApplying the above formula we get\nr z n - 3 Reciprocal\nGG 4198 44735 76 -01316\nGU --0279 --02785 92 -01087\nDifference -47520 Sum -02403\nSq. Root -155\nDiff Sq. Root 3-065\nWhence the chance of this being accidental is found to be less\nthan one in a hundred though greater than one in a thousand. We\nshould take this to be significant and conclude that G and U are\n\" different \" were it not for the very low self-consistency of Uvani,\ni.e. the low value of the coefficient for UU.\nWhen we take the mean value of the z's derived from GG and UU\nas a measure of the total self-consistency, so to speak, and a corre-\nsponding value for the standard error of this, we obtain a probability\nof accidental occurrence of just about 1 in fifty. It needs a certain\namount of optimism to regard this as significant.\nThe figures obtained by the method of ranks gives much better\nresults, namely a chance of no more than about 1 in 600. But\nthe method of ranks is itself somewhat discredited and the pro-\ncess of \" stepping up \" from the value p first calculated to the cor-\nresponding r involves assumptions which may not be warranted\nhere.\nConsequently, though I have little personal doubt that the result\nis genuine, I do not care to claim it as such.\n20. Correction of Garrett-Uvani Psychogalvanic reflex data :\nThe data actually entered on the working sheets were the scale\nreadings of the galvanometer at the beginning and end of each\ndeflexion, together with the relevant balancing resistance, sensitivity\nadjustment and the voltage actually applied to the bridge.\nThe first step in reducing these data to the form required was the\nconstruction of a tripartite Reduction Factor, consisting of (a) the\nsensitivity factor, (6) the voltage factor and (c) the resistance\nfactor.\nThe first of these was obtained from a table (see Appendix I)\ngiving the true change in sensitivity at any setting of the sensitivity\n\f228 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\ncontrol for a given external resistance. The second was the quotient\nof the voltage at which the bridge was calibrated (3-0 v.) by that\nactually in use. The third was derived from calibration curves\nshowing the change in resistance necessary to produce a deflexion\nof 100 scale divisions, at full sensitivity and with three volts on the\nbridge, for any given external resistance.\nThe next step was to multiply each of the two scale readings just\nmentioned by this composite Reduction Factor, thus obtaining the\namounts (in ohms) by which the external resistance had changed,\nfrom the value to which the bridge was balanced, at the beginning\nand end respectively of the reaction.\nThe difference between these quantities is evidently the actual\nohms change constituting the reaction.\nThe resistance to which the bridge was balanced, less the first of\nthe two ohmic changes just mentioned, is the true external resistance\nat the beginning of the reaction, and I expressed, in all cases, the\nactual-ohms-change calculated as a percentage of this \" initial\nresistance \" ; for I argued that a change of, say, 10 ohms in 10,000\ncould not reasonably be regarded as equivalent to one of 10 ohms in\n5,000 or 20,000.\nThe percentages thus obtained were further corrected for the\npossible effects of fatigue, or like secular changes within the period\nof the sitting, as follows :\nAssuming the change to be linear in time, I grouped the per-\ncentages, for each sitting, by tens of words (1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30,\netc.) and calculated (by the usual method of least squares) the\nequation to the straight line most nearly passing the points whose\ncoordinates were the means of these groups of percentages and the\nnumbers 5-5, 15-5, 25-5, etc.^\nFrom this equation I derived a new factor for each percentage\nchange, such that, dividing by it, I turned each into a percentage of\nthe mean (percentage) change for the sitting concerned.\nThese were the figures used in the correlations.\nIt appears, however, in the light of further study, that much of\nthis very laborious technique is redundant, although I think it the\nnearest practicable approach to a truly rigid treatment.\nIn the first place, the use of the \" resistance factor \" (c) mentioned\nabove is largely nullified by the subsequent expression of the actual\nohms change as a percentage of the \" initial resistance \" ; for the\nfirst process consists in multiplying by a quantity which, for high\nresistances at any rate, is very nearly a linear function of the initial\nresistance, and the second consists of dividing by the initial resistance\nitself ; so that the relative values of the figures ultimately obtained\n^N.B. This saves much labour, but introduces a small error, negligible in\nall ordinary cases.\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 229\nfor the various words (in which alone we are interested in this\nwork) are little altered from those of the deflexions corrected for\nvoltage and sensitivity only.\nSecondly, the use of the \" initial resistance \" instead of the\n\" balanced resistance \" is a minor refinement which could be\nomitted without serious results.\nThirdly and most importantly, in comparing two personalities,\nit is clear that whatever error is allowed to reniain by omitting\nthese correctional procedures applies to both ; so that the final error\naffecting the results is no more than differential.\nGiven reasonably good raw material, I should only use this very\nelaborate technique in cases where (a) the issue was of the first\nimportance and (6) the less elaborate treatment yielded ambiguous\nresults ; or (c) where it was desired to obtain the nicest quantitative\ninformation possible.\nThe same applies to the correction for fatigue, etc., which seems\nseldom if ever necessary. Its desirability in any particular case can\nbe judged by inspection or by some simple test such as that indicated\nin Note 29 below.\n21. The reason is as follows : Despite what I said above (Note 9)\nabout the impossibility of defining the disturbance in which we are\ninterested except in terms of the measurements we make, it seems\nnone the less true that it is absurd to allow a whole set of reactions\nto be dominated by one or two \" freak \" words. Frog, for example,\nin the case of Garrett, gave a change of 1,084% (10-84 times) the\nmean change on one occasion and 1,018% on another, while Dog\nin the case of Uvani went as high as 1,178%. The method of ranlis,\nwhatever its limitations, does at least obviate absurdities of this\nkind ; and I think it worthy of consideration for very erratic\nmaterial although, of course, it wastes whatever niceties of gradation\nthere may be. The point, however, has no importance for the\nresults described in this paper.\n22. See note above. I am inclined to think that these two words\nhave a genuine significance for the two personalities respectively,\nbut that the effects produced by them have been greatly exaggerated.\nThis may be due to the regenerative effect mentioned in Note 9,\nbut also\u2014I am inclined to suspect\u2014to the personalities half-\nwittingly \" playing up \" to what they knew was expected of them.\n{N.B. The word Frog occurred in Mr Hereward Carrington's list\nand the marked effect received comment.) It is not so easy as\nit sounds to be a good test subject and so to adjust one's mind\nthat each word comes freshly and without reference to previous\ntests.\n\fi\n230 Whatehj Carington, M.A., M.Sc.

Given the number of disturbances in reproduction for the two\npersonalities at a given sitting, it is easy to work out the expectation\nof coincidences between these if chance alone is at work. The\nnumber of actual coincidences is counted and compared with the\nexpectation. The chance that the difference between the expected\nand observed number is fortuitous is calculated by the usual method.\n{Cf. Fisher, loc. cit., p. 80 et seq.)\nThe same procedure can be apphed to two successive sittings of\nthe same personality. As a result of five such tests of each kind\nI get a mean value for [cf- ^oc. cit.) of 0-355 for comparisons of\nG with U and the chance of this being accidental is between -5\nand -7. For comparisons of G with G, and U with U, at different\nsittings, I get a mean value of 11-613 with a corresponding chance of\nabout -0005 (by extrapolation from the table given). This result,\nsupporting that obtained by analysis of the 26 unbroken words,\nappears to justify the statement that the chance of the difference\nbetween G and U being accidental is probably much less than\n1 in 100.\n26. This figure (though of no real interest\n\u2014\nvide supra, p. 187) is\njustifiable even if the contention of Note 25 is refuted, because the\nmost conservative reasonable estimate from the reaction times is\nless than 1 in 1,000,000, and Note 24 shows a chance of 1 in 120,\nwhile the reflexes are certainly good for one of 1 in 10.\n27.

Each deflexion was multiplied only by the\nsensitivity factor and the voltage factor, thus giving what it would\nhave been at full sensitivity and w^ith three volts on the bridge.\nAs an indicative test of the adequacy of this procedure I worked\nthe figures given in Table V above for the Rudi material for the first\nsitting. {N.B. The first ten words give an abnormally high mean\ndue to insufficient preliminary words having been given, but this .\n\f136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 235\ndoes not affect the issue here.

The fact that they differ very slightly shows that the more\nelaborate treatment makes little difference as compared with the\nless.\n{N.B.

New York : 20 West\n58th Street.)\nThe Bulletin in which this paper appears is the first issued by the\nrecently formed American Psychical Institute, of which jMr Here-\nward Carrington is Director, and we may feel confident that if the\nspirit of objective enquiry which has inspired the work reported is\nmaintained, the Institute will make many notable contributions to\npsychical research in the future.\nIn addition to the strictly instrumental tests, the Bulletin contains\na few pages dealing with the formation of the Institute, accounts of\na variety of collateral experiments of various kinds, and discussions\nDf the results. I shall, however, confine myself almost exclusively\nto the quantitative work with the psychogalvanic reflex and reaction\ntimes, considering this to a great extent in the light of my own recent\nstudies in the same field, which are described elsewhere in this\nissue.\nInasmuch as I was the first to suggest the method used (as Mr\nCarrington handsomely acknowledges) the task of reviewing this\nfirst attempt to apply it places me in a peculiarly invidious position.\nFor if I praise (and much praise is merited) I shall be suspect of\nvrishing to exalt my own offspring ; while if I criticise (and many\n3riticisms leap to the instructed eye) I shall be thought envious of\nMr Carrington for being before me in applying my suggestion. And\nthe worst of it is that both accusations will be true ! Between this\nScylla of jealousy and Charybdis of opportunism I must steer as best\nI can, but the difiiculties are doubled by the fact that although Mr\nCarrington has given, in effect, what appears to be the right answer,\nit is the easiest thing in the world to drive the proverbial coach and\nfour through the procedure whereby he arrived at it. And it is\naecessary to point out the joints in the methodological harness lest\nprospective workers in this field should be misled, or the uncritical\ninduced to mistake a valuable reconnaissance for a sweeping\nvictory.\nIn briefest outhne, what Mr Hereward Carrington did was this :\ntie applied a word association test to the well-known medium, Mrs\nEileen Garrett, and to her \" Control \" known as \" Uvani \" (purport-\ning to function through her body, of course) on various occasions ;\n241\n\fI\n242 Review [paet\nthe measured reflexes and times corresponding to the words usedj fl\nin the test were then compared by correlation, and the conclusion \u00bb\nwas drawn that those from Mrs Garrett and Uvani respectively\n\"\u00b0\nshowed much less agreement than those from Mrs Garrett on\ndifferent groups of occasions. From this conclusion Mr Carrington,\nvery reasonably, felt himself entitled to infer that the two per-\nsonalities do not share a common subconscious mental content and\nshould therefore be regarded as \" different \" individuals. This\nargument is perfectly sound ;\nbecause, without begging the whole! uf\nquestion at issue, there seems to be no other way of defining what\n\"\u2122\nwe mean by \" same \" or \" different \" in this context. But the\nvalidity of the inference, like that of any other argument, depends\non that of the data to which it is applied, so that, if these are\nunreliable, the inference is equally so.\nNow, the conclusion that the Garrett and Uvani deflexions (oi\ntimes) differ significantly, which is the starting point of Mr Carring-\nton's argument, is itself the end product of a complex process ir\nwhich three sciences, namely psychology, physics (in the case oi\npsychogalvanic reflex) and mathematics play a part. These thre(\naspects will be considered seriatim below.\nBut Mr Hereward Carrington, although he has spent many years\nin the active pursuit of psychical research, is not and does not profess\nto be a trained psychologist, physicist or mathematician. H(\ntherefore had recourse (in principle very wisely) to those who did\nUnfortunately, with one or two honourable exceptions, these co-\nadjutors did not serve him well, but omitted almost every pre-\ncaution and committed almost every error that could find place ir\nthe work.\nTo account for this fall from grace we may charitably invoke th(\ntheory of the Enchanted Boundary\u2014so trenchantly developec\nby Dr Franklin Prince ^\n\u2014which separates psychical research fron\nother sciences and is such that so soon as the sceptical ''\nscientist\n'\ncrosses it\n\" his weapons become like rotten wood, the joints of hii\narmour begin to gape widely, and his proud steed alters to a sorrj\njade, stumbling at every pebble in the way \". Otherwise we shoulc\nbe compelled to infer a degree of levity and incompetence which r\nwould be distressing to associate with Transatlantic science.\nI will now discuss various specific points which have occurred t(\nme in the course of reading the Bulletin : .\n- \u2022 .\n\u2022\nPsychological.\n(1) To anyone accustomed to using the word-association test\nMr Carrington's psychological advisers brand themselves witl\namateurishness by permitting the use of the infinitive forms \" t<\n1 Cf. Psyche, iii. 298, and his book of that name.\n\f136] Review 243\nsing \", \" to die \", etc.,. instead of simply \" sing \", \" die \", etc.\nThe use of these forms is, in principle, objectionable because the\nessence of the test is that it should be conducted crisply, so that the\nsubject receives in a clear-cut manner the unheralded impact of the\nstimulus word. Imagine\u2014to take the extreme case\u2014an experi-\nmenter saying, \" Now I wonder whether you would be so kind as to\ngive me the pleasure of hearing your reaction to the interesting\nlittle word '\npusillanimously '\n^\n\" This is ridiculous, of course, but\nany premonitory irrelevance is apt to take the edge off the word\ngiven.\nBut the reason why these forms were used is simple. Most of the\noriginal work on the word-association test was done in German,\nnotably by Jung and his co-workers and in their lists we naturally\nfind the infinitives \" singew \", \" sterhen \", etc. When such lists\nare translated into English, the translator rightly indicates that an\n,\ninfinitive was used ; but no man familiar with either the theory or\npractice of the test would dream of using such infinitives in English\nworking.\nI am well aware that these forms are given in the supposedly\nauthoritative work of a well-known American psychoanalyst ; but\n: this merely shows that he inserted the matter concerned more \" for\nthe sake of completeness \" than because he knew anything about\nthe subject.\nI do not say that the use of these forms made the slightest differ-\nence to the result : I do not for a moment suppose they did. But\nI do say that their use indicates that Mr Carrington's psychological\nadvisers were unfamiliar with the practice and ignorant of the\ntheory of the word-association test.\n(2) Conformably with this conclusion, I find no indication that\nthe order of the words was varied as between one experiment and\nanother (c\/. supra, p. 224, note 15). This precaution is desirable\nbecause every word should be presented to the subject so far as\npossible de novo, whereas, if the order be not altered, some words\nwill soon give warning of those that follow them and the effect of\n1 these latter will be altered.\n(3) No account seems to have been taken of the possible effect\nof fatigue in producing spurious resemblances or differences, by\nprolonging unnaturally the reaction times towards the end of a\nsitting or increasing or diminishing reflexes. These effects seem to\nbe negligible, but the possibility should have been noted, if only to\nbe dismissed. To allow it to go by default, so to speak, suggests\nthat it has not been grasped at all.-\"-\n(4) Similarly, the likelihood of over-long reaction times engender-\nIn ing artificial differences ^ has been overlooked, and the same applies\n1 Cf. supra, pp. 228, 234. - , - ..^ \u00ab Supra, p. 181.\n\f244 Review [par\nto reflexes, thougli here the oversight is more pardonable, for onl\nan intimate personal experience with the method would lead on\nto realise how the effect can come about here.^\n(5) When correlational methods are to be used, faute de mieux, it\nis important that allowance should be made for the fact that the\npsychological or physiological \" mood \" of the subject may vary\nfrom one occasion to another ; for otherwise a sitting conspicuous\nfor very long times or very large deflexions may dominate the\nothers and distort the result. This may best be done by expressing\neach time or deflexion as a percentage of the mean for the sitting to\nwhich it belongs. But this was not done, leaving room for un-\nnecessary error, though inspection does not suggest that this was\nserious.\nThese last three points are admittedly semi-mathematical,\ninasmuch as some notion of how figures are compared is needed for\ntheir apprehension. But it is the business of the psychologist to\nsupply his statistical colleague with figures from which systematic\nerrors have been eliminated, or to collaborate with him in their\nremoval ; and every competent experimental psychologist possesses\n(or should possess) at least a smattering of statistical theory, which\nseems to have been lacking here.\nIn this connection I may point out that the figure of minus -4 given\nfor the coefficient of correlation between G and U for the first series\nof experiments conducted in 1932 (p. 32) indicates just as close a\nrelationship between them, though inverted, as would plus -4 ;\neither figure is highly significant when 100 pairs are concerned. I\nam told that this is a misprint for - -04, but it has strangely escaped\nthe notice of the enthusiastic \" critics \" who have hailed the work\nas conclusive.\nPhysical.\nReverting to the experiments themselves the following points\nare noticeable in connection with the psychogalvanic reflex tech-\nnique.\n(1) No circuit diagram or equivalent account of the electrical\narrangements is given, nor can I find any details regarding sensitivity\nof galvanometer, average resistance of the subject, average change\nof resistance per stimulus, etc.\n(2) So far as I can ascertain by personal enquiry, the ordinary\nWheatstone's bridge method was used in the second series of tests\n(1933) and the Godefroy transformer technique in the first. Now\nthe latter procedure, while possessing the advantage of an invariable\nzero point for the galvanometer, does not give a measure of the\n. .\n1 Supra, p. 221, note 9. , . . A.: -\n\f136] Review 245\nresistance change in the skin but of the first differential of this with\nrespect to time. One might fairly say that the \" bridge \" method\nmeasures the effect produced by the stimulus and the \" transformer\n\"\nmethod the rapidity of its onset. It was rash to assume that\nthese two are even qualitatively\u2014much less quantitatively\u2014equi-\nvalent.\n(3) No allowance is made for, nor any relevant data given con-\ncerning, the possibly great effect on deflexions of changes in the\nsubject's resistance during the experiment apart from the transient\neffects of the stimuli {supra, p. 228). This, again, is a point which\n(it would seem) may, in fact, be legitimately ignored. But in pioneer\nwork of this kind, where technique is not yet standardised, every\nsuch point should be considered and the reasons (if any) for ignoring\nit should be given. Otherwise, the suspicion that it has merely not\nbeen thought of, with the corollary that the work is superficial, is\nalmost irresistible.\n(4) Much more serious than any of these is the failure to under-\nstand what is involved in the production of \" negative deflexions\n\"\n{supra, p. 179) indicating an increase as opposed to the normal\ndecrease of resistance on stimulation. These (as I think that every-\none who has worked at all extensively with the reflex will ao-ree)\nare almost invariably due to mechanical movement between^ the\nhand and the electrodes. {N.B. It is theoretically possible that they\nmight be generated by a back e.m.f. induced by the stimulus ; if so,\nreversal of the electrode leads would abolish them.) As such, they\nmay indicate the kind of psychic disturbance which it is desired to\nmeasure ;\nbut this needs demonstration before they can be used as\nindicators with safety. Using my own material (Garrett-Uvani)\nI obtained a positive correlation of -17 for Garrett and of -28 for\nUvani between the positive and negative correlations observed\n(neglecting the sign of the latter). This is about what one would\nexpect ;\nbut it means that, in general, to treat negative deflexions\nas if they were positive is to dilute informative material with much\nless informative and thus obscure the answer.\nYet this was done, I understand, in computing the results of the\n1932 experiments\u2014and that without (presumably) such feeble\njustification as I have just given.\n(5) No account seems to have been taken of day-to-day variation\nof resistance. See Psychological (5) above.\nStatistical.\n(1) Mr Carrington would have done better to have sought the\nadvice of a competent statistician, if possible, before planning his\nexperiments. He would then have been told that to base a research\nof this kind on no more than two sets of readings from one of the\n\f246 Review [part\npersonalities (Uvani) is asking for trouble. It is true that to liave\narranged for more Uvani sittings would have necessitated abandon-\ning others of considerable intrinsic interest. Possibly Mr Carrington\nwas wise in adopting the policy he did\u2014on the whole, I think he was\n\u2014but it should have been made clear to him that this policy was\nalmost certain to preclude the obtaining of statistically significant\nresults.\n(2) The plan adopted for comparing individual words (p. 33) is\nantiquated and tells us nothing reliable when it has been applied ;\nfor who shall estimate the chance of the medians of pairs of variates\ndiffering significantly from those of octets eleven times in a hundred 1\nMoreover, although it may still be \" customary to consider differ-\nences as large as four times their probable error ... as significant \",\nthis is a matter of pious homage to tradition rather than modern\nstatistical practice.^ The proper way of treating such problems is\nby using the sums of squares of their deviations from their means\nas described by Professor Fisher.^\n(3) The use of the Spearman-Brown formula (p. 34, lines 9 and 36,\nlines 1 and 2) is at least equally archaic. When first devised it often\nserved a useful purpose (though not wholly reliably) in enabling one\nto pass, as we should now say, from an inter-clsiss to an intm-class\ncorrelation. It would be better, now that we know how to do it,\nto calculate an intra-class correlation straight away.^\n(4) Mutatis mutandis, the above criticisms apply to the reaction\ntime data.\n(5) It would have been better to compare the odd-numbered\nGarrett sittings with the even-numbered, rather than the first four\nwith the last four, in order to compensate for any systematic change\nwith time in Mrs Garrett's reactions to the words.\n(6) On the all-important question of the significance of the differ-\nence in the correlation coeffi^cients for G compared with U, as against\nG with G and U with U, the method adopted is not satisfactory.\nThe proper procedure is to convert the coefficients into \" z's \" by\nthe formula z=i(log^ (1 +r) -log^ (1 -r), take the mean of the z's\nfor the GG and UU correlations, subtract that for the GU correlation\nand divide the difference by its standard error, which is the square\nroot of the sum of the reciprocals of the number of pairs of variates\nrespectively concerned less three.\nThis procedure gives a value of 1-88, in the case of the reaction\ntimes (see top of page 36) corresponding to a chance of accidental\noccurrence of about 1 in 16. This cannot be judged significant,\napart from the reservations made under the heading Psychological\n^\nCf. Fisher, Statistical Methods for Research Workers, 4th Edn., p. 46.\n2 Loc. cit., 114-115. 3 chap. vii.\n\f136] Review 247\nabove and from the fact that the two correlations are of very unequal\nvalue.\n^\nThe corresponding result from the reflex data is, as will be seen\nby inspection, quite insignificant.\nThus it will be seen that from the total experiments emerges but\none promising result and that of very dubious significance\u2014dubious\nin the sense that unless it were confirmed (as I am happy to say that\nit amply is by my later work ^) no statistician would accept it as\nconvincing, though actually it happens to be the right answer.\nFor this comparative failure Mr Carrington himself is in no sense\nresponsible ; for there can be no doubt that the care he expended\non the work would have led to results as convincing as my own if he\nhad not been misdirected on so many points.\nHe may well feel inclined to echo Mr Chesterton's lines :\n\" The New World's wisest did surround\nMe, and I'm sorry to record\n-:; I did not find their views profound,\n. . .. Or their conclusions well assured.\"\nFor the credit of American Science it is to be hoped that more\neffective help for him will be forthcoming next time he undertakes\nexperiments on these lines. And the sooner the better ;\nfor, in my\npartial judgment at least, we need an immense amount of such work\nat the present stage of the science.\nI am not quite clear whether Mr Carrington supposes that a\nmarked difference in the mean reaction time or deflexion indicates\na difl^erence of personality of the kind he is seeking. On p. 38 he\nrightly discounts the value of this and insists on the paramount\nimportance of the differential reaction as between individual words ;\nbut in his footnote to p. 34 and his textual note on p. 36 he appears\nto take it seriously, for otherwise his disagreement with the '\"\nfair-\nness \" of Dr Zubin's comparisons lacks motive. Actually, difference\nin the values of the means is of no importance, for such an overall\nchange could easily be brought about by drugs, by fatigue, or even\n^ The immediately preceding comments were made on the assunijJtion that\nthe correlation coeificients given are correct ; but they do not appear to be so.\nMaking allowance for the fact that the figures given in the published sheet\nfor the 193.3 sittings awkwardly show .], .2 . . . etc., where one fifth, two fifths\n. . . etc., are intended, I obtain for the UU correlation the value .3283 instead\nof .4565, for the 59 pairs of variates available. This is derived from the use\nof the full Bravais-Pearson Product Moment Formula. Dr Zubin seems to\nhave worked with a Correlation Table, grouping all values greater than\n6.0 sees, together in the 6 sec. class. This may account for the discrepancy\nand the procedure seems to counteract the misleading effects of \" too long\n\"\ntimes. But, again, it should have been mentioned and justified.\n^ Supra, p. 186. .\ni\n.\n;\n\f248 Review [part\nby a heavy meal. Atropine, for example, properly applied,\nabolished the psychogalvanic reflex, while a large lunch would, I\nthinJv, appreciably slow the reaction time. These are all-round\nphysiological changes having nothing to do with psychical individua-\nlity, and if anyone likes to maintain that they are \" really \" psycho-\nlogical, he will have to prove it first and find that it makes no\ndifference afterwards. At best, a change of mean time or of mean\nreflex would indicate a change from, say, an excitable to a sluggish\ntype and this seems just the kind of thing\u2014no more than an exagge-\nrated change of mood\u2014which a true secondary personality could\ncompass.\nThe test of individuality depends on the transvaluation, so to\nspeak, of associations revealed by the differential response to words.\nTurning to the brighter aspects of the paper, there can be no doubt\nthat what Mr Carringtou has lost on the swings of significance he\nhas gained on the roundabouts of variety.\nParticularly interesting, for example, are some of the personality\ntests (Bernreuter, Page, Thurstone, etc.) applied by Miss Frances\nStrakosch, and the Rorschach test given by Dr Levy. Some of\nthese (attitude towards the Church, attitude towards Birth Control)\nmay not be worth very much, but the general method ought to prove\nextremely fruitful in this field and is very well worth develop-\nment.\nMost of all I like, in idea though not in its particular application,\nthe test on what might be called \" interference of learning \" carried\nout by Miss Strakosch and Dr Shipley. Briefly : Mrs Garrett and\nUvani were caused to learn lists of paired numbers in such a way that,\nif there were any connection between the personalities, the learning\nby one might be expected to facilitate learning by the other in one\nset of circumstances and to retard in another. Indications of such\nan interconnection were found ; but this is exactly the kind of test,\nas Mr Hereward Carrington points out, which would show it on\nany hypothesis, for any kind of learning by verbal repetition is\nbound to establish nerve paths of lowered resistance in Mrs Garrett's\nbody, which is involved in each case. Such learning leads to an\nautomatism, so to speak, in which the higher centres or \" pure\nmind \"\u2014if this means anything\u2014are not involved, as anyone can\ntestify who has learned a poem well enough to recite it while reading\na newspaper understandingly, or to work a calculating machine\nwhile thinking of something else.\nBut the general plan of applying \" mental tests \" is excellent\nand should be followed up. The right kind of test will not be easy\nto select ; but from the hundreds available it should be possible to\nchoose a dozen or so which would enable quantitative methods to be\napphed to the comparison of the results.\n\f136] Review 249\nAnother very striking part of the work is to be found in the highly\nidentificatory repHes sometimes given by \" third entities \" (supposed\ncommunicating controls other than Uvani) of whom several were\ntested. For example, the associations \" Glass\u2014Alaska \" and\n\" Needle\u2014Niagara \" given by \" Will \" are superficially extremely\nfar-fetched, but apparently quite relevant to the supposed com-\nmunicator. Our own experience with Mrs Leonard and her controls\nsuggests strongly that this method of \" free association \" is likely\nto prove a far quicker way of eliciting evidential reminiscences\n(especially if the subject is not required to answer against time) than\ndirect questioning or urging the communicator to think of something\nevidential. This line of research should also be further developed.\nTo sum up : Taking the paper as a whole, Mr Hereward Carrington\nis to be congratulated not only on his courage and enterprise in\nundertaking so formidable a research under so heavy a handicap in\nrespect of material resources, and on his determination to import\nthe essential element of quantitative measurement into the cloudy\nwaste of psychical speculation, but on ha\\ang produced a very\nnotable contribution to the subject\u2014perhaps the most important\nsingle contribution ever made.\nBut will scientists in other fields please note, for their future\nguidance, that nothing short of a little better than their best is good\nenough for psychical research ?\nW.

As the resources of the Instilut Metapsychique\nhad been strained by the earlier investigations, the Council made a\ngrant and an offer of collaboration to the Institut, which was\naccepted. One of us (Th. B.) accordingly proceeded to Paris and\ntook part in seventeen sittings at the Institut during February-\nMarch 1933. These were totally negative (except for a very slight\ncurtain movement during an informal sitting at a moment when\nTh. B. was not present). Rudi accordingly returned to his home at\nBraunau, where Th. B. followed him in the hope that the atmosphere\nof the medium's home might be conducive to the production of para-\nnormal phenomena. The four sittings at which he was present there\nwere negative, except for two very slight curtain movements under\nconditions making a judgment impossible.\nAt this stage it was arranged that the medium should have a long\nrest before attempting to give further formal sittings, and that, after\nan interval, a party of members of the Society should go out to\nWeyer, in Upper Austria, where the medium now lives since his\nmarriage with Fraulein Mitzi Mangl. Miss Reutiner, Lord Charles\nHope, Mr Evelyn, Captain Cochrane-Baillie and Th. B. accordingly\nwent to Weyer in September 1933 and took part in several sittings\n(Th. B. in three). Seemingly paranormal phenomena, in the form\nof considerable telekineses and curtain movements, were observed,\nbut under non-evidential conditions. As a consequence Rudi was\ninvited to the S.P.R. He gave a series of sittings in the Society's\ns^ance-ioom. between October 1933 and March 1934 inclusive.\nThe sittings were organised with a fourfold objective in view.\n(1) To look for confirmation of the infra-red phenomena previously\nreported, (2) to test the alleged telekinetic powers of the medium,\n(3) to record any phenomena observed instrumentally, excluding\nhuman testimony so far as possible, and (4) to make the conditions\nof the sittings such as to inspire confidence in any results that might\nbe obtained.\nIn the event no phenomena clearly of a paranormal kiiad were\nobtained. Nevertheless sufficient experimental details will be given\nto enable the reader to judge of the methods employed.\nThe Seance-room\nThe Society's smnce-room was specially built for the purpose of\nmediumistic investigations. It is supported on pillars, the space\nbelow being used as a storeroom. On its south and east side the\n^ Les pouvoirs inconnus de Vesprit sur la m.aticre (1932) ;\nSupernormal Aspects\nof Energy and Matter (1933).\n\f137] The Mediumship of Rucli Schneider 253\nroom projects freely, the south wall being pierced by a large window,\nsupplied with a pair of solid sliding shutters which are completely\nlight-tight.

It contained a shelf, later\ntwo shelves, stretching from wall to partition, on which stood a\n\f254 Report of an Investigation into [part\nMoll galvanometer, with its lamp and scale, a cardiograph embody-\ning an Einthoven string galvanometer, a voltmeter and a switch-\nboard. This apparatus was observed by 0. G., who had to crawl\nunder the lower shelf in order to get to and from his chair. The\napparatus enclosure was for all practical purposes light-tight.\nThe Cabinet\nThe larger enclosure formed the so-called cabinet, into which the\nmediumistic \" force \" is said to enter, there concentrating itself and\nissuing through the opening to produce phenomena. This cabinet\ncontained, at the request of OJga, the medium's control, a bowl of\nwater (on one occasion of ice), a lead box, and other things detailed\nbelow. The history of this box is as follows. In sitting No. 20 Olga\nalleged that the force was harmed by counter-vibrations. An in-\nverted tin box was therefore introduced as a temporary measure, and\nit was proposed to Olga that a permanent box impervious to all\nradiation i\nshould be made into which the \" force \" could enter and\ncollect itself. Olga agreed with enthusiasm, and accordingly a box\nwas made (at the expense of one of the sitters, who wishes to remain\nanonymous) of 2-inch chemical lead. The overall dimensions are\n12\" X 12\" X 15\". At the side nearest to the medium is a circular hole\nof diameter 3\", into which the force could enter, and on the side\nfacing the cabinet curtains was an oval of size 6\" x 9\", through which\nthe force was to issue. The justification for using this box is clear, for\nOlgas statement, though improbable, might have been true. If, on\nthe other hand, Olga's notion about harmful radiations were purely\nsubjective, then the suggestive effect of accepting it and taking\nappropriate steps could presumably only be beneficial to the pro-\nduction of paranormal phenomena.\nCurtain Movements\nA phenomenon alleged to occur in sittings with Rudi Schneider is\nthe movement of the curtains forming the cabinet. These curtains\nusually bear vertical strips of luminous ribbon, and in the present\nsittings there were placed, in addition, luminous spots in four places\nnear the bottom edges of the curtains. Thus if a decided movement\noccurred it was unmistakable, particularly as a record was always\ndictated as to the spots visible to each sitter. Smaller movements,\nhowever, would necessarily be uncertain, owing to the optical and\npsychological difiiculties of accurately perceiving and locaUsmg\nsmall luminous areas in the dark. Moreover, it was obviously desir-\n1\nActually of course, it is impervious to all Iciiown forms of radiation except\ncosmic rays, at all points of its surface other than the holes left as an entrance\nand exit for the force.\n\f137] The Medmmship of Rudi Schneider 255\nable that the exact extent of such curtain movements, together with\nthe amount of energy exerted to produce them, should be measured.\nA simple method of achieving this was accordingly devised. A strip\nof leather was wound on a roller operating on an adjustable ratchet,\nthe roller being fixed against the wall forming the back of the cabinet,\nand the farther end of the strip to the curtain. Hence a movement\nof the curtain towards the sitters (the usual direction), at the point\nwhere it was attached to the dynamometer, would force the attached\nstrip to turn the roller, which w'ould then remain in the position of\nfurthest extension, thus enabling the distance pulled to be measured.\nThe force exerted could be tested with an ordinary spring balance.\nActually the most sensitive adjustment of the ratchet enabled a\nforce of about 3 oz. to be measured.\nA-\n(a)\n1\u00b1\n^^^^^\nT\nc\nFigure 2.\n(a) The circuit and section of apparatus.

E = connecting tube. rF = cotton\nwool lagging.\nNo movement was ever recorded by this appliance and it was\naccordingly dropped in favour of another and still simpler device of\na nature likely, if successful, to be more stimulating psychologically\nto the medium. Nevertheless no response was obtained, and finally,\nshortly before the end of the sittings, a still more sensitive arrange-\nment was installed. From the ceiling of a cardboard box measuring\n8\" X 8\" X 18\", were suspended a strip of brass and a strip of tinfoil 13^\"\nin effective length, and separated at the top by an insulating block\nof ebonite, |\" in thickness (see Fig. 2). The two strips were placed\nin a bell circuit in such a way that if they were brought into contact\na bell was rung. On the tinfoil side of the box containing this\narrangement there was made an oval hole, which was connected by\nmeans of a light tube to the oval hole of the lead box, into which,\nafter being lagged with cotton wool, it exactly fitted. Thus, the\n\" force \" on leaving the lead box would be obliged to enter the con-\n\f256 Report of an Investigation into [part\ntact box and could hardly help exerting pressure on the tinfoil and\nthus ringing the bell, for the tinfoil was so sensitively hung that the\nslightest puff brought it into contact with the metal. At the same\ntime even vigorous blowing at the entrance of the lead box could not\naffect the tinfoil. Under these conditions no response was obtained,\nalthough the bottom of the curtain continued to move slightly.^\nThese circumstances do not completely dispose of all the curtain\nmovements, some of which seemed to extend to as much as 25 cms.\nThe need for further investigation of these movements was con-\nstantly in mind, but it could not be done in a conclusive manner\nwithout interfering with the more important tasks in hand. The\ninvestigation of these movements was therefore limited to the\nmethods described, which at least make it probable that all the\ncurtain movements were due to stray draughts which were from\ntime to time stronger than usual. This can hardly be said to be\nproved, but six or more people talking and singing in a room, com-\nbined with an entry of cold air tlirough a grid, may be capable of\nproducing considerable effects now and again d uring a period of some\n200 hours.\nCine Camera, Lighting, etc.\nOn occasion the cabinet also contained other things which will be\ndescribed below in connection with the temperature and mitogenetic\ntests.\nIn front of the cabinet stood the box containing the thermopile,\netc., details of which will be given below in the section devoted to the\ninfra-red investigation.\nOn the thermopile box stood an inverted waste-paper basket,\nunder the edge of which was caught the corner of a handkerchief\nnhich hung down the side of the box nearest to the cabinet curtains.\nOn the basket stood a small luminous hand-bell. Other objects on\nthe box were, at various times, a small celluloid ball, a black ruler,\nand a partly luminous xylophone. These things were intended to\nbe the objects of the medium's telekinetic forces. In the hope of\nphotographing these objects in paranormal movement a cinemato-\ngraphic camera was installed with a film sensitive to the infra-red,\nsupplied by Messrs Ilford, and it was eventually found possible to\nobtain sharply defined moving pictures in a feeble red light. By in-\ncreasing the infra-red flood lighting, and using horn or ebonite filters,\nit is confidently expected that cinema films could be taken in total\n1 The siini^le expedient of excluding the draughts could not be adopted, for\nthis would have made the room uninhabitable during the long sittings. The\nsource of the draughts is a small ventilation grating in the ceiling, through\nwhich fresh air is pumped into the room through a conduit, by a motor-\ndriven fan in the ante-room. It is certainly a pity that a more convenient\nsystem of ventilation was not adopted when the seance-room was built.\n\f137] The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider 257\nabsence of visible light. By this meaus motion pictures could be\nobtained of telekinetic phenomena in a light that is innocuous to the\nmedium. No telekineses of the obj ects provided for the purpose were,\nhowever, obtained, and consequently the camera was not used during\nthe actual sittings.\nOver the table hung a lamp, the position of which was adjustable\nvertically and laterally. This lamp was specially designed and made\nfor these sittings. It consists of a hood of black-painted metal 12>\\\"\nlong, with a diameter of 12\", inside which hung eight small electric\nlamps, each in its own compartment and controlled by its own switch,\nand each supplied with a red filter of different thickness. In this\nway it was possible to obtain a large range of intensities of red light\nand to know what amount of light was in use at any given moment,\nfor any change was at once recorded. The lamp as a whole was also\ncontrolled by a rheostat, but the use of this was avoided.\nThe Control of the Medium\nThe method of controlling the medium is simple and effective.\nHe is seated in position H (Fig. 1), facing in the direction of the\narrow. Directly in front of him sits the first controller, who takes\nthe medium's hands in his own and puts his knees and the lower\npart of his legs firmly against and outside the medium's. Moreover,\nfrequently tliroughout the sitting Olga requests the sitters to \" hold\ntight \", that is, to make sure that the circle is completely formed.\nThis request has the natural consequence of making the sitters, in-\ncluding the controllers, hand-conscious, and thus serves to prevent\nany lack of continuity in the control of the medium. Next to the\nfirst controller sits the second controller, who is nearly always a\nwoman. She places her right hand round the medium's right wrist,\nthus supplementing the first controller's guard of that side of the\nmedium nearest to the apparatus.\nA detailed account of the method of control and of the precautions\ntaken to preclude fraud is on record, but in view of the negative\nresults it does not seem necessary to give this account in full. It\nshould be stated that luminous strips ^ were sewn to the sleeves of\nthe medium's pyjamas, which were provided by the Society.\nGeneral Arrangements\nThere was no notetaker in the seance-TOom. The records were\ndictated by Th. B. into a telephone suspended round his neck, to the\nsecretary, who was seated in the Society's office, some distance from\nthe seance-room. In this way a complete record (extending in all to\nsome 400 typewritten pages) was made of all conversation with Olga\n1 The luminous paint used did not require to be refreshed, being made on a\nmesothorium basis, and heuce being relatively long-lived.\n\f258 Report of an Investigation into [part\n(except occasional trivial remarks), all observations made in the\nroom (the instrumental ones being called out by 0. G-.). Needless to\nsay, the task of the secretary, Mrs C. Wright, was an arduous one, and\nwe take this opportunity of expressing our cordial thanks to her for\nthe efficient way in which she carried out her work. Occasionally,\nwhen the sitting was particularly long, the secretary left a little\nbefore the end, and the last few minutes were taken down by the\nmedium's wife, Mitzi Schneider. Throughout every sitting held in\nthe seance-TOom, Frau Schneider was in the Society's office with Mrs\nWright or at the telephone in the manner described.\nSuch were the personal precautions taken to prevent fraud on the\npart of the medium (apart, of course, from the direct precautions\ntaken to prevent interference with the apparatus). . These precau-\ntions were all of a simple kind, which were not in the least trouble-\nsome to the medium, who, indeed, welcomed them. Naturally, if\nparanormal phenomena had been forthcoming these precautions\nwould have been tightened up and elaborated ; as described they\nwere merely a first step.\nWhen the sitters had taken their seats and the controllers had\ntaken charge of the medium, which was always done, at the begin-\nning of each sitting, in a bright white light, the light was extinguished,\ngenerally by means of a rheostat placed in the observation corner.\nThe required amount of red light had already been switched on and\nthen remained. After an interval of about fom- to seven minutes,\nthe medium's hands and arms usually begin to tremble, this being\nregarded, for purposes of record, as the beginning of the trance.\nThese tremblings fairly rapidly increase in strength until they are\ninterrupted by several violent clonic spasms ;\nusually the medium\nsuddenly falls quite limp for a moment or two during these prelimin-\nary efforts. Then, after one of the clonic spasms, the medium relaxes\na little, though persisting in a moderately violent, jerky movement of\nhis trunk, and begins to change the rate and depth of his respiration.\nUntil this moment his breathing is more or less normal, allowing for\nhis violent movements. Now, however, the medium half opens his\nmouth, and begins to breathe rapidly, noisily and wetly. This goes\non, interrupted by frequent clonic spasms, moments during which\nthe medium falls quite limp and does not breathe at all, brief com-\nmands and jerky fragmentary conversation, until Olcja asks for an\ninterval. The process of coming out of trance is an almost exact in-\nversion of that of falling into trance. These processes are gone\nthrough at the beginning and end of each part of the sitting.\nThe Trance and Respiration\nThe object of the present research as a whole was primarily to in-\nvestigate the problem whether Rudi Schneider possesses paranormal\n\f137] The Mediumship of Rucli Schneider 259\npowers, and, if so, to iiiquii'e into the nature and capacities of those\npowers. Other problems arising incidentally, however interesting in\nthemselves, had to be subordinated to this primary aim, at any rate\nso long as the main question remained open. Consequently no steps\ncould be taken to study the psychological aspects of the medium's\nI trance which might have adversely affected the subject's mediumis-\ntic activities. Hence we restricted deliberate experiments on these\nlines to word-association and psychogalvanic reflex sittings, the\nresults of which must now be set out.\nAs we have seen, when Rudi goes into trance his personality\nchanges. A strictly objective account of the change would be : when\nin trance Rudi behaves as if he were a woman answering to the name\nof Olga, who declares herself to be the surviving spirit of Lola\nMontez.\nBefore we turn to the consideration, so far as our fragmentary\nmaterial permits, of the nature of Olga, a few words ought to be said\nabout the trance itself. On this subject we have little of value to\noffer. We are unable to offer definite evidence as to the genuineness\nof the trance, for the not inadequate reason that no conclusive\nI\nmethods of determining this point exist. The method, quite in-\ni\nadequate moreover, of testing the subject's anaesthesia, could not be\ntried without greatly endangering the object of the sittings. So far\nas it goes evidence of this kind incidentally obtained tends to suggest\nthat the trance is genuine. During the violent movements in which\nthe subject indulges in his trance he frequently administered toler-\nably severe blows on various parts of his anatomy, without ever\ngiving much sign that he was even conscious of pain. But as the\nsubject in his normal state (as when playing football), has been seen\nto experience without complaint even harder blows, this evidence is\nnot particularly convincing.\nThere remains the problem of the subject's abnormal breathing\nwhen in trance. Tliis breathing is an invariable concomitant of the\ntrance, and has the appearance of beginning quite suddenly at a\nrate of about 60 to 100 cycles per minute. Our impression is, how-\never, that this sudden beginning is an illusion due to the noisiness of\nthe breathing when it reaches this point. What actually happens\nappears to be this : the subject settles down and puts himself into a\nfavourable attitude ^ of body and mind ; after about four to seven\nminutes, tremors begin in his extremities ; at the same time the\nrate of breathing slowly increases with the increasing violence of his\nmuscular movements ; at a given moment the rate of breathing\nbecomes too great to be conveniently carried out by normal means ;\nand at this moment the subject opens his mouth and begins the noisy\nbreathing so characteristic of his trance.\n^ What this is is not known, as the medium is unable to say.\n\f260 Report of an Investigation into [part\nFrom this point the rate of respiration increases and varies up to a\nmaximum of 240 cycles per minute in the present sittings, though\nhigher rates have been recorded elsewhere. The question therefore\narises whether this breathing is in itself an indication of the genuine-\nness of the trance, on the ground that it is impossible to breathe nor-\nmally at this rate without losing consciousness. This statement, at\nleast, can be answered definitely in the negative.\nDr C. G. Douglas kindly assisted in the collecting of samples of the\nmedium's breath in Douglas bags and their subsequent analysis.\nFour samples of expired air were collected as follows :\nCase I. 15-5\u00b0C. and barometer at 751 mm. The medium sitting\nresting in light and out of trance. This was three-quarters of\nan hour before Case II.\nCase II. 15\u00b0C. and 756 mm.

Case III shows a moderately\nlarge rate of oxygen consumption if the time 0'46\" instead of 1'46\"\nis correct. This figure corresponds to a man walking at some 4 miles\nper hour, and since the medium was in fairly violent motion at the\ntime this high figure is in no way excessive.\nTable I\nCase\nVol. in\nlitres\nVol. at\nS.T.P. in\nlitres\nTime\nNo. of\nBreaths\nBreaths\nper\nminute\ncc. of\nroom air\nper\nbreath\nccOj at\nS.T.P.\nper min.\nCO,\nat S.T.P.\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\n48-5\n55-35\n52-92\n71-74\n44-9\n51-3\n49-9\n66-5\n7'33\"\n2'8\"\nj\n0'46\"\nur46\"\n4' 34\"\n111\n1\n215\n215\n831\n14-7\n?\n?280\n^122\n182\n436-9\n246-2\n246-2\n86-32\n274\n340\n?1410\n?611-9\n223\n0-80\n1- 14\n0-87\n0-87\n0-93\nCase IV is normal for ordinary mild exercise as far as the respira-\ntory coeflficient is concerned and the breathing is definitely shallow.\nNo measurements were ever secured while the \" force \" was doing\nwork because it never was observed to do work. The above figures\nsuggest that the medium's breathing is one that gets shallower as the\n\f137] The Mediumshij) of Rudi Schneider 261\nrate of respiration increases. During a sitting short periods of apnoea\nare observed, but these do not alternate regularly with, the breathing\nand so there is no Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Moreover, the medium\nshows no signs of distress at the end of a sitting.\nA still more conclusive proof of the normal natm-e of the subject's\nbreathing in trance is the fact that we have both succeeded in pro-,\nducing exactly similar elfects during similar periods of time.\nThe figures for the total quantity of air breathed may be slightly\ntoo small since there may be some leakage of the valves at the more\nrapid rates of respiration recorded. This error, however, would not\naifect the composition of the exlialed gases. Even a 50% leakage\nthrough the valves would still leave the figm^es at perfectly normal\nvalues, so it must be concluded that there is notliing paranormal\nabout the respiration of the medium in trance.\nThis is a convenient point at which to insert a medical report\nkindly made for us by Dr Maurice B. Wright\n:\nAge : 26.

This is the question of memory : are\nthe memories of Kudi and Olga co-extensive ? Obviously a definite\nanswer is impossible, since, as Mrs Salter has well said in a somewhat\nsimilar context, \" It is very much easier to discover that a man does\nnot know a language when he is pretending he does, than to discover\nthat he does know it when he is pretending he does not.\" ^ kt the\nsame time we believe that Eudi's amnesia in regard to Olga is com-\nplete. This belief is based on Rudi's behaviour when in his normal\nstate, in which he never gives the shghtest indication of any direct\nknowledge of what goes on when he is in trance. This being so we are\nalso incUned to believe that the subject's trance represents a genuine\nloss of normal consciousness ; but we are neither able nor do we\nwish to put this any higher than a mere belief, though it is admittedly\na strong one.\nWe do not, however, feel confident of Olgas amnesia in regard to\nRudi's experiences. Olga herself, to say nothing of Rudi, behaves as\nif there were no \" correspondence \" between them. This is mani-\nfestly illogical, for if Olga is a spirit who knows what is going on in\nthe physical world, as she claims, why should she not be aware of, at\nleast, the subject's physical activities 1 The same difficulty applies\nto Olga's alleged ignorance of Rudi's mental activity, since she fre-\nquently claims to know what others are thinking of. Nor is evidence\nwanting that Olga does in fact know of Rudi's doings and thoughts.\nThus, to take only one example, Olga sent messages to Rudi not to\nbe unhappy at the death of his father. Again, it is frequently notice-\nable that Olga insists on asking for special sittings when these will\ninterfere with arrangements already made by Rudi ; this is less direct\nevidence, but none the less convincing.^ In short, we have little\ndoubt that there is no amnesia by Olga regarding Rudi.\nThis kind of one-sided amnesia is by no means uncommon, and it\nunfortunately solves no problem. For Rudi's amnesia may be, and\nvery probably is, no more than the expression of a belief. If Rudi\nbelieves that he cannot or ought not to remember Olga's experiences,\nthis belief is quite sufficient to account for the fact that in effect he\ndoes not remember them. This naive causality of the mental life\nincreases by a hundred-fold the difficulty of most of the tasks of\npsychical research.\nWe then arrive at the heart of our present problem, the true nature\nof Olga. If Rudi loses consciousness on going into trance and if he\ndoes not afterwards remember what he did in trance, then clearly\nOlga and Rudi cannot be regarded as the same personality unless we\ngive a quite unjustified extension to our terms. There are thus two\n1 Mrs W. H. Salter, \" The History of George VaHantine,\" Proc. 8.P.R. (1932),\nxl. 404.\n2 This kind of antagonism is fairly characteristic of dual personalities.\n\f137] The MecUumsM]) of Rudi Schneider 263\nmain possibilities : (1) that Olga is, as she claims to be, the spirit of\nLola Montez ; (2) that she is a more or less discrete part of the total\nRudi personality.\n(1) The first of these possibilities it is difficult not to dismiss out of\nhand. The full spiritualistic theory of the survival of the \" whole\n\"\npersonality is certainly not acceptable, for Olga clearly does not\nbehave in a manner characteristic of Lola Montez. Thus, to take\nonly one minor example, she does not speak English although the\nMontez did so. Even if we hold a minimum theory of survival, e.g.\nthe persistence of a small number of characteristic memories, it would\nbe hardly possible to accept Olga as Lola Montez, for she never in our\npresence gave the slightest indication of the possession of any such\nmemory.\n(2) Thus we can only inquire whether Olga is different from Rudi,\nor at any rate more different than a mere secondary personality can\nbe expected to be. This point, obviously, can only be settled by the\ninspection of various kinds of behaviour, and this we have done by\napplying the word-association and the psychogalvanic reflex tests to\neach personality separately and by comparing the results.\nThe psychogalvanic reflex portion of this experiment has already\nbeen reported on by Mr Carington {Proc. S.P.R., xlii.), who shows\nthat Rudi and Olga are similar to such a degree that they must be\nregarded as being the \" same \". As Mr Carington also points out, it\nseems that Rudi did not frankly co-operate in regard to the word-\nassociations. There is evidence to show that he systematically pre-\npared responses instead of uttering the first word that came into his\nhead. This strongly suggests that he was afraid that free responses\nmight betray something he wanted to keep to himself. A clue to the\nnature of this \" something \" is possibly to be found in the stimulus-\nresponse Schwindel-schon (Fraud-good) which occurred about half-\nway through the first session ; too much weight miist not, however,\nbe placed on a single response of this kind, nor should it be forgotten\nthat this response may have been motivated by an old and super-\nseded state of mind. At any rate, after this point there is practically\nnothing in the nature of a genuine response. It is with regret that\nwe are obliged to draw attention to this fact, for it is impossible to\npraise too highly Rudi's straightforward behaviour throughout the\nordinary sittings and his willingness to submit to every suggested test.\nIn these circumstances the word-association test is almost useless\nfor our present purpose, and there only remains one feature of the\nOlga responses to be discussed. In the ordinary sittings Olga does\nnot speak much ;\nindeed, the medium's rapid breathing makes nor-\nmal conversation impossible. Her remarks are limited to instruc-\ntions regarding the conduct of the sittings, and the vocabulary used\nfor this purpose is naturally limited. Now from the word-association\n\f264 Report of an Investigation into [part\nsessions with. Olga the curious fact emerged that Olga's vocabulary\nseems to be wholly limited to the words used by her in the ordinary sit-\ntings (her responses, like Rudi's, had no relevance to the stimuli). The\nextent of her vocabulary is only a little more than half the normal.^\nFrom the presence of such frequent repetitions of particular\nresponses as 14 (Acht, Achtung), 25 (alle), 18 (Freund, etc.), 14\n(Licht), 11 (lustig), 19 (nicht), 15 (schliessen), 25 (sprechen), 13\n(Strahlen), 15 (zahlen), and from the large number (70) of words\noccurring only once, it may reasonably be inferred that there is no\nconsistency or definiteness in the word-responses. For such con-\nsistency would produce results showing a few words occurring only\nonce or twice, very few, if any, occurring as often as those enumer-\nated above, and a large number occurring between three and six\ntimes. Analysis of the lists confirms this inference, for the fact\nemerges that there is no correlation between given stimuli and given\nresponses. This must necessarily be the case for the words that occur\nmost frequently ; but the following table shows that it is equally true\nof the few words occurring between three and six times.\nTable II\nOlgas responses given between 3 and 6 times.\nResponse Stimuli\nBeriihrung wahlen, Bngel, bringen, Kopf\nBcwcgung Spott, richtig, Icochen, Kopf, Schifl:\nEnde neu, Automobil, Spott\ngut Knochen, stolz, bos, Hund, Licht\nlielfen lang, vornehm, Kuss, Wasser\nHimmel Berg, Gebirge, Gebirge\nkabinett Ture, Blume, waschen, Strasse\nKreis Schiff, kochen, malen, kochen, kochen\nNahe Strasse, Angst, falsch, drehen, Frau\nrot drohen, Brot, drehen, Brot, Lampe\nschwarz weiss, schwarz, Frau\nStreifen Nadel, Buch, hell, Teil, Tiire, knochen\ntief spiclen, Teil, Ptlaume\nviel Frau, schlafen, Vorsicht, trilb\nVorhang Baum, Pflicht, krank, Schwindel, Tinte, Monat\nzeigen wahlen, Sclilange, krank, Apfel\nIt is thus clear that the limited vocabulary produced by Olga in her\nresponses is not due to her possession of a consistent personality, that\nis, one frequently giving the same or similar responses to given\nstimuli. The responses to only two of the above words, indeed,\nHimmel and Kreis, show any signs of consistency. Berg and Gebirge\n(the use of these synonyms was due to an oversight in the compilation\n^ A complete table of the words used by Olga in her responses is on record at\nthe Society's rooms.\n\f137] The Mednimship of Rudi Schneider 265\nI\nof the lists), elicited the following responses in addition to Himniel\n:\nhell, frei, laut, besser, Hohe. It is thus a reasonable inference that\nthe notion of mountains produces a pleasurable reaction in Olga.\nKochen, which three times elicited Kreis, was also duplicated by\naccident in drawing up the lists, and produced the following re-\nsponses : zergangen, Abteilung, bewegen, bisjen sprechen, ja,\nFreund. Hence the recurrence of Kreis may be simply due to the\nfact that kochen was presented twelve times instead of six. If there\nis any significance it is possibly due to a mishearing of Kreis as Eeis\n(rice), a favourite dish of the medium's.\nBerg-Gebirge, then, being the only stimulus-word which elicited a\ncharacteristic response from Olga, it is interesting to compare the\nresults obtained with Rudi. These were as follows : Garten, Kopf,\nbewegen, weinen, halt, Himmel, grausam, fein, Glaube, Bild, Baum,\nHimmel. These responses are about equally similar and dissimilar\nto Olgct's, the two occm-rences of Himmel being particularly notable.\nHowever, as we have already decided that the Rudi responses cannot\nbe taken too seriously it will be wiser not to press this point.\nAll these facts, fragmentary as they are, point to the conclusion\nthat the trance is genuine and that Olga is a personality artificially\ninduced or suggested for the purpose of the sittings and hence\nUrmted in its scope to its function as a trance-personality.\nThe Information available to Olga\nIt has been alleged that the trance personality is aware of what\ngoes on in the dark seance-ioom.. In these sittings the medium in\ntrance still claimed these powers and was put to the following test.\nOne of the sitters (0. G.) put his hand in one of three positions, \"Up,\"\n\" Forward,\" or \" Down \", these positions being checked by the\n:\ntouch of the sitter next to him. The medium in trance in the dark-\nened room made twelve guesses at the 38th sitting on 6 February\n1934 at this one in three chance and scored four successes. The\nresult was not considered good enough to make it worth a more de-\ntailed investigation. As recorded below Olga was entirely unaware\nof the strength of the infra-red beam in the thermopile apparatus.\nOn the other hand she said when first questioned about Feda, who\nwas asked, at a sitting with Mrs Leonard, to get in touch with Olga,\n\" She has been here tonight.\" This tallied with what Feda had said.\nAll attempts at a cross-correspondence, however, failed.\nThe Infra-Red Investigation\nNo evidence of absorptions of a beam of infra-red light of the type\nrecorded by Osty ^ and Herbert ^ could be obtained, notwithstanding\n^ E. and M.

The former were used to detect\npossible absorptions in the far infra-red beyond the range of the\nphoto-cell and the latter was used in order to look for absorptions of\nshort period. Since no effects were observed the instruments were\nnot calibrated and their exact sensitivity is therefore unknown. Two\nthermopiles were used, [a) a Moll linear thermopile of approximate\nresistance 22 ohms which is advertised to give an electromotive force\nof 24 microvolts to a candle placed 50 centimetres from the plane of\n.<:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ w wwwATT\n\\\n^\\ \\ \\ \\l\nThe wires are\nFiGUKE 3.\nA.

(6) A large surface Moll thermopile of approximate resistancf\n50 ohms which operated without a slit and is advertised as giving\nunder the above conditions 2200 microvolts to the candle and 200(\nmicrovolts to the black surface. The instruments were connected ir\nseries to a Moll galvanometer of undamped period of 1-3 sec, whicl\ngave approximate deflections at one metre of 200 mm. per micro\nampere and 4 mm. per microvolt, having an approximate resistant\nof 50 ohms and a factor of merit of 2,500.\n1 This statement rests on the unsupported statement of 0. G., who visual!\nobserved the recording apparatus.\n\f137] The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider 267\nOne of the tliermopiles (A, Fig. 3) was placed inside a double-\nwalled tin box (B) whicli was filled with water, so as to constitute a\nwater-jacket, and was lagged on the inside with a layer of felt padding\n2 cms. thick. The radiation was allowed to enter this box by a red\ngelatin window (C). In this way the thermopile was protected from\nstray heating effects and draughts and its two brass terminals were\n'\ngiven a maximum opportunity of coming to the same temperature\nor to a steady difference of temperature. The latter condition is\nimportant to minimise stray thermo-electromotive forces due to\ninequalities in their temperature. The thermopiles stood on a plate\n!\nof glass, coated with paraffin wax to prevent the appearance of a\nconducting film of moisture ; and the latter stood on an earthed\nsheet of metal. The water-jacketing box (B) was also connected to\nearth. The leads from the thermopile were all single strands of\ncopper wire from double cotton insulation and these were encased\nin rubber tubing. They entered the box B by two special holes\n(D D^) which were plugged with cotton wool to prevent the entry of\ndraughts and the wires were firmly spliced to the tin tube filling\nthese holes. This precaution was to make it impossible to move the\nthermopile by pulling on these wires since they were not strong\nenough to move the whole box B. This procedure ensured that any\nstray vibrations in the room set up by the medium's breathing or\nfor other reasons could not produce deflections in the galvanometer.\nThis precaution was not sufficient, however, to render the galvano-\nmeter reading insensible to someone deliberately pulling the leads.\nSince the wires were on the far side of the apparatus to the medium\nthis was deemed adequate as a preliminary precaution, and the\nmaximum effect observed during control experiments when the leads\nwere pulled deliberately was only 4 mm. on the galvanometer\nscale.\nThe leads were carried on an equipotential railway, of the type\nadvocated by White ^ and by Maass,^ so that they came in contact\nonly with glass rods which were supported on bits of metal that were\nall connected to earth. As a further precaution the rods were fitted\nwith a solution of rubber and paraffin wax in carbon tetrachloride to\nprevent a conducting film of moisture appearing on them. The leads\nwere twisted round several of the glass rods so as to prevent mechan-\nical shocks to the wires from transmitting forces to the galvanometer\nwhich was directly attached to one lead. The other lead came to an\nanti-thermo-electric switch of the type used by one of us (0. G.) ^ in\nwork on adiabatic calorimetry.\nThe principle is to make contact by dipping two spirals of copper\n1 White, Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1914, 36, 1862.\n2 Lipsett, Johnson and Maass, Jour. Amer. Chem Soc, 1917, 49, 935, 1940.\n^ Gatty, Wolfenden and others. Jour. Chem. Soc, 1934, 561.\n\f268 Report of an Investigation into [part\nwire into a cup containing mercury. The cup is drilled in a sheet of\nebonite that stood upon an earthed sheet of metal, the metaUic ends\nof the spirals were amalgamated by dipping into a saturated solution\nof mercury chloride to ensure a contact where the mercury wetted the\ncopper, and the upper ends of the spirals were shellaced over thin\ncotton insulation so as to ensure thermal equilibrium with the mer-\ncury before electrical contact was made. A finger inserted into one\nof these mercury cups produced a deflection of 1 cm. disappearing\nin 10 seconds to zero, so they can be said to be adequately immune\nfrom stray heating eifects and also from bad contacts. At the other\nside of this switch the lead was carried on an equipotential railway\nand inside its rubber tube to the galvanometer.\nThe galvanometer box was a double box packed with cotton wool\nbetween its two walls and the leads were led into it through glass\ntubes shut in with sealing wax and so forming a draught-proof entry.\nThe front of the box was a plain sheet of glass. The two brass\nterminals of the galvanometer were therefore in a box that was\nthoroughly well shielded, and so stray thermo-electric effects were\nreduced. The galvanometer itself stood on a 10 cm. pile of alternate\nsheets of glass (2 mm.) and layers of paper approximately 1 cm.\nthick. In this way insulation and freedom from vibration was\nsecured. The whole box was placed on a sheet of earthed metal and\nthe two were nailed to the table in the observer's cabinet. In this way\ndeflections due to a person jumping in the smj?-ce-room were found\nto be dead-beat and of the order of 8 mm., falling in 2 seconds to\nzero. The galvanometer reading was observed on a scale at approxi-\nmately 1 metre, the exact position being adjusted each time the\nobserver (0. G.) set the apparatus going. This procedure was neces-\nsary in order to allow room for the observer to enter the observation\ncabinet, which had to occupy a minimum space in order to allow the\ntrance personahty to have her cabinet of suitable shape and sufficient\nsize.\nThe source of light used in the thermopile system was a 240 watt\nlamp run through a rheostat off the 100 volt direct current mains.\nThis powerful source was put in Avith a view to a possibility of wishing\nto do spectrographic work with the linear thermopile. It was en-\nclosed in a double-walled water-jacketed copper oven which was\nconnected to earth. In the second series of experiments the voltage\nacross this lamp was read on a Cambridge Paul Universal Unipivot\ngalvanometer and by use of a calibration curve all readings could be\ncorrected for the voltage across the lamp. The energy falhng on the\nthermopile after passing through the filters was found to vary\napproximately as the square of the voltage. Data for one calibration\ncurve are given in Table III.\n\f137] The MetUumsJiip of Rudi Schneider 269\nTable III\nCalibration of Ray against Voltage\nThermopile\nReading Voltmeter\n172 100-2\n148 90\n122-5 80\n97 70\n76 60\n55 50\n38 40\nAll visible light was excluded from the beam by a sheet of ebonite of\nthickness 0-005 cm. or by a filter of 1 cm. of a saturated solution of\niodine in carbon disulphide in a glass vessel, or by both. The latter\nfilter was used because the photographic work of Rayleigh ^ and\nHerbert ^ indicated that absorptions, unless of extreme rapidity, did\nnot occur at wave lengths shorter than 1\/x while Herbert and Osty\nusing photo-cells both recorded absorptions. No alternating current\ncircuits ran close to the thermopile system, and therefore screening\nof the circuit was unnecessary. The same holds also for the Moll\ngalvanometer, as it is a moving coil instrument.\nOsty, doubtless relying on the early work of Lange on copper oxide\nphoto-electric cells, claimed that his cells were sensitive up to 6\/x and\nthe iodine solution was therefore selected because Coblenz gives for\nit the following transmissions :\nTable IV\nWave Length Transmission per cent.\n0- 75^^ 0\n1- Ofi 80\n1-2-5\/t 90\n3fi 60\n4\/i 10\n5^ 0\nSince only the ebonite filter was used, the range of incident radiation\nmust have been extended much farther into the infra-red.\nIt is evident, however, that the range up to 5\/x given with the solu-\ntion filter alone is adequate, since a careful calibration at the National\nPhysical Laboratory of one of Osty's cells taken over by one of us\n(Th. B.) from Paris gave the following figures.

Full\nrecords of the actual results obtained at all the sittings are available\nat the Society and specimen records are given below. In certain\ncases the fact that all possibility of absorption was less than 2% has\nto be left to the second by second observations by one of us (0. G.).\nIn some cases the force is said to enter the ray and the observations\ngiven whenever the spot moved by 1 mm. are such, as to show the\nreader that on that occasion any deflection corresponded to less than\nj%. In one case and only one case there appeared to be a genuine\nabsorption > 3% and it seemed to amount to a 16% absorption.\nOn this occasion it was subsequently discovered (1) that water was\nleaking out of the water-jacketed box surrounding the thermopile,\n(2) that one of the thermopile terminals was touching a moist piece of\nfelt inside the box. In view of the failure to repeat this one \" absorp-\ntion \" on any other occasion throughout the whole series of sittings\nthis one result is attributed to experimental error. Thus the result\nwhen contrasted with 80% absorptions alleged to occur during 10\nminute intervals ^ are seen to be definitely negative. In view of the\nabsence of positive results and the trouble of simultaneously record-\ning the voltage of the mains and the galvanometer readings on a\nphotographic plate all these observations were dictated through to\nthe secretary in the oliice. Whenever the spot shifted across one of\nthe millimetre lines on the scale the change if observed was recorded,\nthough occasional exceptions were made to this rule when the read-\nings seemed of trivial importance as compared with alleged move-\nments of curtains.\n^ E.

G. to Th. B. and\nthen, at once, by the latter to the olB.ce by telephone. Movements\nsuch as were obtained on this evening were never observed at any of\nthe other sittings. It is concluded that they are due to faulty insu-\nlating owing to water escaping into the thermopile box and one of\nthe terminals of the latter touching a moist piece of felt that was\nglued to the metal box. This source of error was due to faulty\nsoldering of the walls of the box, which was moved during the week\nby the caretaker. The error, however, was detected and corrected\nbefore the 30th sitting in January. Owing to the results of this\nevening a voltmeter to measure the voltage of the mains was in-\nstalled for the next series of sittings to check independently the\nenergy being emitted by the source. The observed fluctuations of\nvoltage in the next series of sittings were neither large enough nor\nrapid enough to account for the results of the 29th sitting. These\nare therefore attributed to faulty insulation and are highly significant\nin showing the errors liable to arise from minor flaws in the set up of\nthe apparatus.\n\fI\n278 Report of an Investigation into [part\nThe actual arrangement of the beam, which was entirely un-\nfocussed, is illustrated in Figure 3. The whole apparatus including\nthe source and the thermopile was enclosed by placing a wooden\nbox E over it. This box and the stand supporting the thermopile\nand the source were nailed to the floor. They were both covered\nwith a black cloth that was screwed to the floor by pegs through\nwhich was run a fine steel cable that was also earthed. In this way\nthe only access to the ray was a hole opposite the opening between\nthe two portions of the cabinet curtain. The diameter of their aper-\nture, which was loosely closed with a piece of muslin cut into four\npieces that could each be moved back with the lightest pressure, was\nvaried from 20 cms. to about 5. At times the muslin was completely\nremoved and in all cases the medium in trance announced that the\n\" force \" had no difficulty in getting into the ray. The ray itself was\nfeeble enough to be suitable, according to the trance personality,\nwhich however was found to be in error when tested on one occasion,\nto see if it was aware of the relative strength of the beam at two\ndifferent sittings (see the '20th sitting above). An electric stove\nplaced near the thermopile outfit but unable to shine directly in\nthrough the window of the thermopile box produced no appreciable\ndeflection of the galvanometer in a period of two minutes.\nThe photo-electric cell used was a copper-copper oxide cell of\ntype PAj as sold by the Westinghouse Brake and Saxby Signal Co.,\ngenerating a current that is given in milliamperes per Watt of inci-\ndent radiation in Table X.\nTable X\nWave length Short circuit, milliamperes\nper Watt of radiation\n(in \/i)\n0-6\n0-625\n0-635\n0-65\n0-70\n0-75\n0-80\n0-85\n0-90\n0- 95\n1- 0\n1-1\n1-2\n1-3\n1-4\n1-5\n1-6\n1-7\n0-04\n0-55\n1- 36\n0-91\n0-77\n0-73\n0-73\n0-71\n0-66\n0-60\n0-53\n0-39\n0-27\n0-18\n0-10\n0-05\n0-02\n0-005\n\f137] The Mediumship of Rucli Schneider 279\nThe cell has an approximate resistance of 1800 ohms and was con-\nnected in series to a Cambridge Instrument Co. portable electro-\ncardiograph Einthoven galvanometer having a 1400 ohms gilt glass\nfibre. With this external resistance the cell should be working near\nits maximum efficiency, since 1400 is not very different from 1800\nohms. The source of light was a torch bulb run off a 6 volt accumu-\nlator and the filter used was a 1 cm. saturated solution of iodine in\ncarbon disulphide in a glass vessel. The cell was rested on glass and\npaper to insulate it and free it from vibrations, and was only some\n15-20 cms. from the source of light. Both were enclosed in a rec-\ntangular muslin box whose edges were ribs of wood. The box was\nnailed to the floor and a hole 10 cms. in diameter in the muslin was\nmade on the side of the box next to the cabinet. This box was close\nto the medium's chair, which was also screwed to the floor, and only\nrose some 10 cms. from the floor. The force apparently had no\ndifficulty in entering this ray either, if the words of the medium in\ntrance are to be beheved. Photographic records were not taken since\nnothing was seen when the naked eye of the observer watched the\nshadow of the fibre. It is estimated that an absorption lasting only\nsome 0-04 seconds would have been observed however in this way.\nThe string galvanometer cannot be kept as steady as the Moll gal-\nvanometer spot because the tension of the fibre is a function of the\ntemperature of the fibre and its carrier. If used for long periods at\na time the instrument warms up and the tension of the fibre varies\nand has constantly to be readjusted. The total deflections amounted\nin some cases to 81 mm. and an absorption of 1% should have been\ndetected with certainty by this method. The precision and the\nsteadiness could have been increased by being more careful to\nprotect the Einthoven galvanometer from vibrations. The latter\nfrom time to time caused small deflections which occurred when the\nforce was not in the ray according to the trance personality. A\nnumber of figures are given below to show that no absorptions were\nobserved in this ray.\nCell Readings for the second part of 34:th Sitting on Friday, 26 January\nTable XI\n1934.\nCell zero -26\n8.53 p.m. ceU\n8.54 cell\n8.541 ceU still\n8.55 cell\n8.56 01 ga \" I have been in twice\n\"\nin\n17 Olga \" Now I am going in again\n\"\n18 \" Look out\n\"\n18\n18\n18J and \" Force is about to go into ray\n8.57 cell\n9.01 cell\n9.1* cell 17\n\f280 Report of an Investigation into [part\nTable XII\nCell Readings, 3Qth Sitting, 30 January 1934\nCell zero\u2014plus 1\n8.22 \" The force is coming out to move the curtain and to enter\nthe new ray\n\"\n8.24 Cell steady at 22\n8.25 Cell steady at 22\n8.29 Cell steady at 23\nSimilar results occurred on the other occasions when the \" force\n\"\nwas said to enter the ray, and occasionally a kick Avhen the observer\nsaid fiinf owing to the vibrations he himself set up. These kicks\ncould be set up without the presence of the medium. One observed\nin the 36th sitting was :\nTable XIII\n9.32 cell =111\n9.331 cell =12\n9.35\" cell =12\n9.351 \"Count to 5\"\nAt the word a kick from 12-13\nEveryone said together without Olgas instructions\nThe reading kicked from 12-13 1\/4\nThe maximum deflection ever obtained with the cell was 81 units\ndifferent from its zero. Thus a deflection of 1% should have been\ndetectable but was never observed in conditions that made the\ndeflection seem to have its origin with an absorption owing to the\n\" force \" from the medium.\nTemperature Tests\nTwo small wooden boxes were fixed to the wall of the cabinet\nwhere Olga collected the \" force \" and an ordinary glass drinking\ntumbler was put into each of them and was tightly packed into the\nbox with cotton wool. A piece of 32 gauge constantan wire was\nsoldered to the ends of two copper leads and one junction was put m\none tumbler and the other junction in the other tumbler. The leads\nand also the constantan wire were encased in rubber tubing except\nat the thermo-j unctions. They were carried on an cquipotential to an\nantithermo-electric switch of the type described before and thence\nto the same Moll galvanometer as was used in the thermopile circuit.\nThe circuit contained only three single strands of copper wire, the\nswitch, the galvanometer, and the constantan wire. The insertion of\na hand into the upper part of either tumbler rapidly produced a\ndeflection of three or four centimetres on the galvanometer scale.\n\f137] The MedmmsMp of Rucli Schneider 281\nThe sensitivity of the apparatus was calculated from the thermo-\nelectric force per degree centigrade of a copper constantan thermo-\njunction which is about 38 x 10\"^ volts per degree centigrade and\nthe resistance of the circuit which was roughly 80 ohms. In con-\nsequence 1 mm. on the galvanometer scale should correspond to\nsome 0-01\u00b0C. During a sitting the lower box slowly became cooler,\nbut this occurred during control experiments as well. The force on\nseveral occasions was announced by the medium in trance to have\ngone into the lower box and it stayed there for several periods of\n20 minutes. On no occasion was any change of temperature detected.\nThese results, some of which are given below, agree with the fact that\nmeasurements with the thermopile when the source of infra-red light\nwas turned off also showed no heating or coohng effect when the\n\" force \" was said to be where the beam of infra-red light usually was.\nTemperature Effects.

This is also so on the many other occasions\nthat this apparatus was used.\nA search of mitogenetic properties of the \"force \". \u2014It was thought\nthat the \" force \", though unable to affect the ray, might conceivably\nhave a mitogenic power owing to some telepathic mechanism. _\nEe-\ncent work by Gray and Ouillet ^ shows, for instance, that even if the\nbiological evidence of Gurwitsch ^ for mitogenic rays is accepted they\ncannot be supposed to be ultra-violet radiation. The actual experi-\nments were performed on two strains of Bacillus fluorescens and on\nsamples of dormant yeast. No result of the action of the force was\nobserved, but none of the experiments were of a high order of\naccuracy. Thus, on 10 November 1933, eight tubes of Bacillus\nfluorescens were taken into the seance-room in two different boxes.\nAt each stage of their history the tubes were redistributed in a ran-\ndom manner between two boxes so that the controls should be\nadequate. The force was said by the medium in trance to have been\nin the box containing tubes A, C, F and H from 9.34^ till 9.56 and\nagain from 11.46-11.57, making 32| minutes in all. The bacteria\nwere then counted in a sample, the count extending over ten cells.\nThe results given are the mean of ten such counts and the results\nare as follows :\nTable XV\nForce\n\"\nby the tubes Control tubes\nA - - 14-7 B - 18-9\nC - 17-1 D - 19-2\nF - - 18-1 B - 21-5\nH - - 16-4 G - 13-2\nMean = 16-6 Mean = 18-2\n1\nProc.

The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider :>83\nThe ten counts for A gave values that varied from 10-18 with a\nstandard deviation of 2-35. For the mean of four tubes would there-\n9.35\nfore expect a standard error of \" and a difference of 2-35 between\nthe means would be regarded as worthy of inspection by the t-\ndistribution formula of \"Student\". Since 18-2 - 16-6 = 1-6, the\ndifference is not significant. A more careful test is to calculate\n1\n^~%TT2^'- (meanof \u00ab2 + l observations)\n~m _Li yi^'r (mean of + 1 observations)\n1 f\u00abl +l \u00ab2+l\nx-o^ I\n(n^+l) (ng + l\nand look up in Student's tables of t for n = n^ +^^2.\nThis procedure gives t = 0-34 for n = 6. There is thus approximately\na chance of 0-75 that a homogeneous population Avould be found to\nexhibit the observed discrepancy owing to pure chance. The results\nare not significant.\nOn 12 December 1933 a larger number of tubes containing cultures\nof Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens was put into each of the two\ntemperature-measuring tumblers and the \" force \" was announced\nto have gone into the lower box from 8.31-9.5, which amounts to\n34 minutes in all. Two counts, each in 10 cells, was made on five\ntubes from each box. The remaining tubes were not counted since\nthey would not have produced a great increase in accuracy. The\nresults were :\nTable XVI\nLower box 16 and 20\n16 and 17\n12 and 15\n31 and 28\n13 and 18\n88 95\nUpper Ijox 30 and 30\n23 and 16\n17 and 15\n12 and 17 The results give =18-6\n26 and 17\n108 95\nX -\n^ = 0-6 and \/t = 18\n\f284 Report of ait In-vestigcdion into [part\nFor n,= lS there i>s a probability of about 0-65 that t should exceed\n0-G, so that the observed discrepancy between the upper and lower\nboxes probably arose from errors of random sampling. _\nA t = 2 would be regarded as significant, so that if a:\u201e - a\\ which\n20\nequals 1-7 or 8-5% had been -g- times as great the result would have\nbeen significant. Thus this method would have detected a 28%\ndifference in the counts of the two series. Alternatively the number\nof counts should have been multiplied by ten and refer to 100 tubes\nin all in order to achieve an accuracy of 8%.\nOn Tuesday, 4 November 19:33, three tubes of dormant yeast were\nput in one temperature box and three in the other. The force was\natinoiinced to have gone into the box containing tubes 3, 4 and 5,\nwhile the controls 2, 6 and 7 were not influenced by it. The force\nwas in the box from J 1.12 to 11.20. making 8 minutes in all. The\nC0.2 evolved by these tubes was subsequently measured for If hours.\nThe results for the COg evolved in the last 1| hours were as follows :\nTable XVII\n111 t lie joice Not in. the force\nTube 4 = 4-18 Tube 2 = 4-06\nTube 3 = 4-46 Tube 6 = 4-77\nTube 5 = 4-20 Tube 7 = 4-49\nMean = 4-28 Mean = 4-44\nStandard error = 0-158 Standard error = 0-358\nFor the standard error of the mean divide by ^3 and obtain Sin =0-09\nand Sout = 0-21.\nSince 4-44 - 4-28 = 0-10, the difference between the two samples is\nnot significant. It is therefore concluded that no significant difference\nin the rate of growth of two strains of Bacillus fluorescens or in the\nfermenting power of yeast was observed owing to the alleged presence\nof the force.\nSurvey of the Sittings\nNundjer of sittings : 55, of which 38 were full-dress sittings in the\nSociety's seance-room (type A) ; four were informal sittings, three\nheld in 0.

Man in Search of a Soul, translated by W. S.\nDell and Gary F. Baynes. London : Ke^an Paul, Trench,\nTrubner and Co., 1933. Pp. ix+282. iOs. 6d.\nThis book is not the systematic examination of contemporary\nspiritual adventures which its English title might suggest ; nor on\nthe other hand is it, like so much psycho-analytic literature, a mere\ndigest of clinical material. Of the eleven lectures which compose it,\nthe majority were first published in German in 1931, as part of a\nvolume entitled Seelenprobleme der Gegenwart ; the remainder are\nnow collected for the first time from scattered publications. They\ndeal discursively with various wider aspects and implications of\n\" analytical psychology \"\n\u2014its postulates and aims, its bearing upon\nliterature, anthropology, religion and ethics, above all its thera-\npeutic value in the disordered world of to-day. They are addressed\nin the main to that section of the educated lay public which looks\nto the psychologist for the sort of practical guidance that was once\nexpected of the clergy. While they are less systematic than, for\nexample, Freud's New Introductory Lectures, they are also much less\ntechnical ;\nthey are refreshingly free from vanity and dogmatism ;\nand they raise questions which are of fundamental importance for\nwestern civilisation. Jung has here left the consulting room for the\nmarket place\u2014one might almost say, for the pulpit.\nAlthough the book contains one or two references to parapsycho-\nlogy, its interest for the psychical researcher is marginal rather than\ndirect. Jung's Weltanschauung is much more favourable to \" oc-\ncultism \" in general than is Freud's :. in the growth of spiritualism,\ntheosophy, and even astrology, he sees a necessary reassertion of the\nintuitive or religious side of man's life against the dominance of the\nconceptual thinking associated with modern science. This necessity\nis not, however, the same thing as validity : he quotes spiritualism,\nalong with the hallucinations of the insane and certain experiences\nof primitive man, as an example of the law that relatively indepen-\ndent psychic contents always tend to be personified. His own view\nis that \" we cannot know whether anything happens to a person after\nhe is dead.\" But the idea of life after death is for him one of the\n\" primordial thoughts \", which though \" incommensurable \" with\nscience are \" indispensable conditions of the imagination \" and may\nhave to be revived and encouraged for therapeutic purposes. The\nphysician's ultimate task, he says elsewhere, is to convey to the\n28\n\fReview 287\npatient \" the healing fiction, the meaning that quickens\u2014for it is\nthis that the patient longs for, over and above all that reason and\nscience can give him.\" This of course raises two issues, one ethical,\nthe other practical : is it intellectually honest to \" convey \" opinions\nwhich one does not share ; and how can such a procedure be success-\nful with educated patients who are capable of distinguishing the\ntruth of a belief from its usefulness and are on their guard against\nsuggestion ? To neither question does Jung give a satisfactory\nanswer. When he falls back, as he does, upon the statement that\n\" all psychic happenings are real it is difficult not to suspect him\nof an elementary confusion. For the reality which belongs to every\njudgement qua \" psychic happening \" is not, even for a pragmatist,\nthe same thing as its truth. And while the psychologist as physician\nmay plead that questions of truth are irrelevant to his work, if he\naspires to be a teacher he can no longer equate \" this judgement is\ntrue \" either with \" this judgement is made \" or with \" this judge-\nment is mentally hygienic.\"\nJung remarks that \" every psychology\u2014my own included\u2014 has\nthe character of a subjective confession.\" And it is extremely inter-\nesting to observe how widely the path of analytical psychology as\noutlined by Jung has diverged from the psycho-analysis which the\nFreudian school, using the same fundamental concepts and faced\nwith the same fundamental problems, has developed under the\ninfluence of a very different temperament. While rightly recognising\nin Freud \" a great idealist \", and paying generous tribute to the im-\nportance of his discoveries, Jung mocks (not without justification)\nat the Freudian \" nursery-tales about the terrible old man of the\ntribe \" ;\nhe also (more questionably) regards Freud's teaching as\n\" hostile to spiritual values \", since it is a psychology without the\nsoul. In contrast, Jung's system might be described as a religion\nwithout a creed (he himself compares it with the discipline of Yoga).\nIt has a minister, a ritual, a sacrament of confession and absolution ;\nabove all, it has as its central mystery a process of conversion or re-\nbirth which \" cannot be compassed by the rational concepts of con-\nsciousness,\" because it is no mere re-education of wayward instincts\nbut \" the bringing into being of a new centre of equilibrium.\"\n\" The archetypes come to independent life and serve as spiritual\nguides for the personality. . . . This spontaneous activity of the\npsyche often becomes so intense that visionary pictures are seen or\ninner voices heard.\" These are the classical symptoms of religious\nconversion. But to what is the patient converted 'I His spiritual\ndirector does not know or (apparently) very much care. The psycho-\ntherapist \" must have no fixed ideas as to what is right, nor must he\npretend to know what is right and what not\u2014otherwise he takes\nsomething from the richness of the experience.\" \" Whether energy\n\f288 Review\nis God, or God is energy, concerns me very little, for how, in any\ncase, can I know such things ?\n\" It is as though the psychological\nmachinery of conversion were set working in vacuo, as a wholesome\nspiritixal exercise with no purpose beyond itself. What sets it work-\ning seems to be in the end simply the powerful and sympathetic\npersonality of the spiritual healer. That is why \" the attitude of the\npsychotherapist is infinitely more important than the theories and\nmethods of psychotherapy.\" And that is also why Jung, with all\nhis imaginative insight and breadth of vision, is unlikely to leave\nbehind him any such school of scientific therapists as that founded\nby his master and rival. Jung is a great personality and a pene-\ntrating observer ; he is not a great scientific or philosophical thinker.\nE. R.

It was not till 1909, when he was already middle-aged, that\nhe was first brought in touch with the subject through his position\nas clergyman of an Episcopalian Chiirch in New York. One day\nthere walked into his church a young woman, whose obvious mental\nand physical ill-health made demands on his sympathy. She was\nthe \" Doris Fischer \" of the now famous case of multiple personality,\nand later on was adopted by Dr and Mrs Prince, and as Miss Theo-\ndosia Prince looked after Dr Prince during his latter years.\nConsidering the nature of his previous training, Dr Prince's treat-\nment of the Doris Fischer case and his presentation of it in vols.\nLx.-xi. of the Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical\nResearch must be reckoned among the most remarkable feats in\nmodern psychology. Some of the incidents arising in the treatment\nof the case turned Dr Prince's ever alert mind towards a closer study\nof supernormal phenomena, and he rapidly became known as one of\nthe leading figures in the psychical research of our generation. His\ndeafness prevented him, as he was fully aware, from ever becoming\na first-rate observer of the physical phenomena of the seance room,\nbut except in that limited field, his critical ability, open-mindedness\nand philosophic grasp enabled him to make contributions to psy-\nchical research of very great importance. Besides the Doris Fischer\ncase one may mention his report on Senora Maria Reyes de Z.,\nwhich together with the earlier investigations of the same medium\nby Dr Pagenstecher, constitutes the most important evidence on the\ndebated subject of psychometry ; his examination of the automatic\nwritings of Patience Worth, and various spirited but fruitless\nattempts to reduce to order the chaotic condition of the terminology\nof psychical research.\nDr Prince had been Research Ofiicer of the American S.P.R. for\nseveral years before the disruption in that Society in 1925, which led\nto the formation of the Boston S.P.R. Of the new Society he was\nat once appointed Research Ofiicer and held that post till his death,\nu 289\n\f290 Dr Walter Franklin Prince [part\nHe was elected a Corresponding Member of our own Society in 1921,\nand was President for the years 1930, 1931.\nOur Society was privileged to hear him deliver two papers of out-\nstanding interest. His Presidential Address to the S.P.E. is an im-\nportant pronouncement, by one fully qualified by experience to make\nit, on the progress made and the degree of certainty attained in\ndifferent branches of psychical research, and the factors which\nconduce to or hinder further development. The other paper was\nan account (afterwards printed by the Boston S.P.R.) of a tour of\ninvestigation on the Continent. For substance and style this paper\nwould on its own lines be hard to beat.\nAttention should also be drawn to the short but valuable summary\nprinted in the Transactions of the Congress at Copenhagen of the\nbearing of the evidence for telepathy on the problem of survival.\nCertain phenomena since reported would very likely have induced\nDr Prince to modify his statement in detail, though not the general\ntenor of his argument.\nDr Prince held the view, and stated it frequently and with great\nemphasis, that the evidence of psychical research supported a belief\nin survival, but his keen criticism of certain of the phenomena upon\nwhich the case for spiritualism is often based, prevented his ever\nbecoming a champion entirely acceptable to the spiritualists. It is\na position that is very well understood in this country.\nBut it would not be proper to conclude an obituary notice of Dr\nPrince without laying emphatic stress on the degree to which quali-\nties not only of intellect, but of personal character\u2014his friendly\ncandour and his absolute trustworthiness\u2014contributed to the im-\nportance and permanent value of his work.\nIN MEMORY OF WALTER FRANKLIN PRINCE\nWith the death of Walter Franklin Prince, which occurred on 7th\nAugust, 1934, Psychical Research has lost one of its outstanding\nfigures.\nBorn at Detroit on 22nd April, 1863, Mr Prince graduated in 1881,\ntaking his A.B. at Yale in 1896 and his Ph.D. a few years later.\nAttracted to the religious life, he became a B.D. of Drew Theologi-\ncal Seminary and then followed a number of Church appointments\nin Brooklyn and elsewhere.\nAs early as 1900, Dr Prince exhibited characteristic traits which\nwere afterwards to dominate his whole life. He became an Assistant\nSecretary to the Law and Order League of Connecticut and his\ninterest in legal methods were shown by his papers on the First\nCriminal Code of Virginia, on the Blue Laws, and above all by his\npaper on the \" Great Slave Conspiracy Delusion,\" wliich he pub-\nlished in the Saturday Chronicle of New Haven, Conn, in 1902. In\n\f138] Obituary 291\n;\nthis paper he examined the evidence as seen in the documents and\nsuumied up his findings in the way so familiar to readers of his later\n: papers on psychical research. It was, he wrote, \" the crowning\njudicial atrocity of American History.\" On 25th May, 1934, in a\n,\nletter to the present writer, he described another worlc which had\nI\njust been published as \" the worst printed crime in the history of\nPsychic Research.\"\nIt was in dealing with documentary material that Dr Prince ex-\ni\nhibited his greatest powers. During his work with the American\nSociety for Psychical Research (1917-1920) and latterly with the\nBoston Society his principal achievements have been in his analyses\n[\nof various cases, although in practical work the investigation of the\nDoris Fischer Case will always be remembered. Although he fully\nrecognized the importance of skilled field work and did his utmost\nto acquire knowledge of the psychological and mechanical aids to\nfraud he was never entirely at home in the laboratory, for he was\ngreat enough to know that without a long and laborious training it\nwould be impossible for him to observe in the way that he knew was\nnecessary.\nDuring the tenure of office of the writer with the American\nSociety, at the time that Dr Prince was still with it, we were in\nalmost daily consultation. A deep friendship and rare under-\nstanding grew up between us, which was never marred even by later\ndifferences of opinion. We continued a long and confidential corre-\nspondence almost to the day of his death. In his last letter he ex-\npressed the wish that \" so many miles did not intervene, so that we\nmight often meet face to face.\" Had he not left us we should have\nmet this autumn in his beloved home at Hingham, Mass.\nE. J. D.\n\fTHE FIRE WALK\nBy E. S. Thomas\n\" Mr Frazer \", says Mx Andrew Lang (in Magic and Religion) \" is\ninterested mainly in the religious, magical, or ritual significance of\n(the fire walk) which varies in different places. To me on the other\nhand the immunity of the performers appears a subject worthy of |\nphysiological enquiry.\" Sir James Frazer on his side notes that\n\" eyewitnesses who have described the rite in Oceania have said\nlittle or nothing as to its meaning and purpose : their whole attention\nhaving been apparently concentrated on the heat of the furnace and j|\nthe state of the performers' legs before and after passing through it.\"\n'\nIn preparing this paper I have studied some 27 cases of what I\nshall call the ember walk as practised by Asiatics, and 10 of the stone\nwalk of Oceania, and my verdict would be that Mr Andrew Lang has\nthe better claim on our sympathy. For the purposes of this paper\nthe object of the rite or ceremony has been of secondary importance.\nYet a few words regarding the antiquity, significance and geo-\ngraphical distribution of the performance will not be out of place.\nThe oldest reference to it comes from India, ^ in the story of a\ncontest as to which of two priests was the better Brahmin. It was\ndecided by walking a fire of red-hot embers. The story is as old as\n800 B.C., but it is referred to in one of the Samhitas of the Taittiriyas\n400 years before this. About 300 B.C. it was enacted that the fire-\nwalk or the holding of red-hot iron should be the test of the veracity\nof a witness. Its connection with the story of Sita, wife of Rama,\nwho proved her innocence and virginity by walking the fire, is too\nwell known to be more than referred to. In modern times it is\nperformed by Hindus as an expiation for sin, as a demonstration of\nthe power of mind over matter, in fulfilment of a vow-bargain made\nin illness or misfortune, and as an obligation for the tenure of a post\nin the temple. In the background there is in some cases the sug-\ngestion that it is also implicitly a vernal or fertility rite, with a\ndominant idea of its purificatory power. In China it is certainly a\nsolar or vernal fete, and it is probably the same in Japan, where it is\nalso performed as a sign of spiritual power, and with a purificatory\nobject. In the South Seas on the other hand, only members of a\ncertain family are said to have the power to walk the hot stones,\ndecendants of a man upon whom it was bestowed by a mythological\neel in return for its life, although as the huge oven is also used to\nroast the first fruits and early fruits of the Ti or Dracaena root-\n^ Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics.\n292\n\fPART 138] The Fire Walk 293\nharvest, a vernal sionificance seems to be present both in this part\nof the ceremony and the season of year when it is usually performed.\nThe famous classical examples of the ember walli:,! at Mount\nSoracte, near Rome, practised, it is interesting to note, by a member\nof a particular family, and at Castabala in S. Cappadocia, are well\nauthenticated as to the fact by Virgil, Strabo, and Pliny. lambli-\nchus 2 the Philosopher mentions the piercing of the bodies of walkers\nwith skewers, a practice followed, as we shall see, by Hindu walkers\nto-day.\nAn arresting sentence in Ezekiel 28, 14 describing the King of\nTyre walking up and down amidst the stones of fire, which Sir James\nFrazer accepts as evidence for the stone-walk in antiquity, appears,\nunfortunately, to be a corrupt passage misconstrued ; Dr Moffat's\ntranslation has \" flashing jewels \" in place of \" stones of fii-e\n\"\n; so\nthat we are left with the story of the Three Children as the sole\npossible reference to an analogous experience in the Bible.\nAndrew Lang ^ quotes the Berseker's boast from the Icelandic\n\" Flatey Book \" \u2014\" I can walk through the burning fire with my\nbare feet \" as a possible reference to the practice. In a legend of a\npupil of St Brigid, who filled her shoes with cinders to purge her soul\nof fleshly desires, Professor R. A. S. MacAllister * sees a tradition of it\nalso in pre-Christian Ireland. But Spain and Bulgaria are the only\ntwo regions in Europe where the ember-walk is definitely recorded.\nThe antiquity of the records of the ember walk point to a source\namong Aryan peoples. Its present distribution is as follows :\nHindus and Hindu emigrants practise it to-day in India, the Straits\nSettlements, Mauritius, Trinidad and S. Africa. Hindu influence in\nChina and Japan in the past is very evident in the Buddhism of both\ncountries and the practice may well have reached them therefore\nfrom India. Although in India Moslems walk the fire, particularly\nat the Moharrem festival, no cases appear to be reported from other\nIslamic countries. In North America frenzied Cheyenne ^ Indians\nused to rush into fires and trample them out, in Yucatan ^ men walk\nor rush over red-hot cinders to avert expected calamity, and in\nAustralia treading out or treading on fire is practised in initiation\nceremonies. We are told that in Yucatan they are sometimes un-\nscathed, but it is clearly not done in any of these cases as a demon-\nstration of immunity from burns.\nIn Oceania alone are hot stones walked, and the distribution there\n' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, and Lang, Modern Mythology.\n- Frazer, The Golden Bough, vol. vi.\n2 Lang, Modern Mythology. * Man, 1919, 63.\n^ Handbook of American Indians (Smithsonian Inst.), i. 495.\n8 Mackenzie, D. A., Mijths and Traditions of the South Sea Islands.\n' Mathew, J., Eagle Hawk and Crow.\n\f294 E. S. Tliomas [part\ncoincides with the peregrinations of the hereditary Fijian fire-\nwalkers. The ceremony may well have reached them through\nIndian traders and have been transferred from the bed of hot embers\nto the dracaena oven.\nIn Spain and Bulgaria it is singular that, like the classical fire\nwalkers of Mt Soracte, some cases in India, and as generally reported\nin the South Sea Islands, the fire walkers should belong to a parti-\ncular family or caste. In Spain they were reported in the nineteenth\ncentury to have the hereditary power of going into the flames and,\nby dint of charms, permitted by the Inquisition, of extinguishing\nfires. ^ In Bulgaria the family are called Nistinares and the power is\nattributed to Sts Constantine and Helena. About 21st May, the day\nof these Saints, the desire to walk the fire comes upon them, especi-\nally when certain music is made. After processions and sacrifices of\noxen and rams, fires are lit, and, filled with ecstasy by the music,\nthey dance in the flame in turn until, the power leaving them, they\nfeel the heat and withdraw.^ No details are given as to the state of\ntheir feet before or afterwards.\nI now turn to the evidence proper, beginning with China. The only\ndetailed report ^ of the ceremony is 73 years old. It took place amidst\nscenes of frenzied excitement. Round an area of red-hot charcoal,\n20 feet in diameter, a Taoist priest walked, throwing on rice and salt\nto conjure the flames and assure a propitious year. Two exorcists\nfacing one another across the area then beat the surface with whips\nrepresenting snakes. Then they walked across and two of the\npeasant performers, who had practised fasting and continence for a\nweek, crossed and recrossed until it was trodden down. The Great\nCrod's image was then carried across and back three times by twenty\nsimilarly trained peasants. The witness, Herr Schlegel, a German,\nwas not impressed. He attributed their immunity from burns to\ntheir horny foot-soles placed flat. He had seen the protagonists of\none of these ceremonies flogged as impostors next day by Govern-\nment officials. The salt and beating of the embers would certainly\ntend to lower the temperature and hasten the production of ash. It\nwill be remembered that the men with the whips faced each other\nand we may guess that the path followed was this beaten one.\nIn Japan the throwing on of salt is also recorded, and the feet are\ndipped in salt before walking. The surface too is beaten and to\ngreater efl^ect, with long poles. Mr H. G. Pouting, one of the re-\ncorders of the Japanese ceremony,^ walked the 20 foot length after\ndipping liis feet in salt, and feeling only a comfortable warmth, re-\npeated it at a slower pace. He halted, moreover, in the middle and\ntrod on the hottest ember he could see (the only indication he gives\n^ Lang, Magic and Religion. ^ Lang, Modern Mythology.\n^ Internal. Archiv. f. Ethnog., 1896, x. (supplement).\n4 London Times, 23.2.34.\n\f138] The Fire Walk 295\nof the state of the furnace) and kept his foot there for a second.\nHe felt a slight sensation of a burn, and a blister formed which gave\nno trouble. It seems clear from this very summary account, in\nwhich the details relate to the frenzied excitement into which the\npriests worked themselves and the cult accessories, that the coals\nwere not very hot when Mr Ponting wallied. The embers were of\ncharcoal which had been brought to a glow with long fans over an\narea 20 ft. x 12 x 1 ft. deep, and they had clearly cooled and probably\ndeposited a good thick coating of ash. He considers that the beating\nsmooth of the embers had much to do with it, the ostensible effect\nof which was doubtless, as in the Chinese rite, to drive out the\ninimical spirit of fire.\nIn a case reported to Sir James Frazer by two eye-witnesses, how-\never, the conditions seem to have been more severe. One of them,\nMr Foxwell, said \" the sweat ran down him \" as he stood near the\nfurnace and he was unable to explain the immunity of the per-\nformers. Perceval Lowell, the American writer, was, he said, laid up\nfor three weeks with burns after walking, while a Scottish engineer\nnamed Hillhouse was unscathed. The probable reason for the im-\nmunity of the engineer, his hardened foot-soles, does not seem to have\noccurred to this observer, and this weakens our faith in the value of\nhis impressions.\nIn a third case from Japan, reported in 1903 by the wife of an\nAmerican naval officer,^ salt was rubbed on the legs before walking.\nThe heat appears to have been intense as the lady spectators held\nup fans to screen their faces from it, and an English lady shrieked\nwith alarm ^ when the first of the walkers entered the furnace, of\nwhom one is reported to have strolled over the 18 feet distance with\nno apparent discomfort. The furnace was 18 ft. x 6 x 2 ft. deep.\nStraw was laid on charcoal and ignited and the charcoal fanned into\na glow. The ceremony took place at 6 o'clock, when nearly dark,\nwith a full moon. No details of time intervals are given. The great\nheat of the furnace is not incompatible with a good covering of ash,\ninvisible in the moonlight, to which the bm'nt straw would contri-\nbute. Many people followed the protagonists, including boys and a\nwoman carrying a babe, but we are not told after what interval of\ntime.\nLastly, in an ember-walk witnessed at Tokio in 1899 by Mr Andrew\nHaggard,^ those who were to walk sat stripped in a room by big tubs\nof cold water, with which they frequently drenched themselves, work-\ning themselves into excitement meanwhile with long prayers, chants\nand gesticulations. He too records that the fire was beaten with long\npoles before the walk. Before passing on to the Indian cases two\nobservations may be made. First, that we are not justified in\n^ Frazer, Golden Bough, vol. vii. -A merican Anthropologist, v. 1903, 377.\n3 Lang (9) and The Field, 1899.\n\f296 E. S. Thomas [part\nassuming, if there is no reference to beating the surface in such |i\nsunuuary accounts from China and Japan as those we have to be |t\nsatisfied with, or to douching with cold water, that these incidents |[\ndid not take place. The second observation is that nothing is said, j\nin any of the above accounts, of the ash which must have formed on\nj\nthe surface. Ash is such a bad conductor of heat that even a thin j\nlayer would effectively shield a calloused foot from the red-hot i\n[\nembers during a short contact. |\n(\nIn two cases of the Indian walk the ash is specially mentioned, f\nMr W. E. Beeching ^ witnessed the ceremony in 1933, a Moslem |\nperformance which took place on a dark night about 3.30 a.m. The j\nfire was lit at midnight and contained a good deal of cork. It was ,\nspread out with iron rakes which were cooled with water. This t\nformed puddles round the embers which lay about 12 inches thick\nover an area, one gathers, about 9 feet in diameter. The priest came I\n\\\ndecked with garlands from the bath and, after gyrating round the '\nj\nedge, pranced into the glowing mass. His feet covered to the f\naiikles were slowly withdrawn and as he moved forward the hlach \/ ,\nimpresses filled in as the embers slipped into place. He turned and :\nf\nreturned several times. Mr Beeching who desired to walk was told \\\n\\\nto wait until he could do so with priestly blessing. He entered in\ndue course with bare feet, turning up his trousers, and dashed to the j f\nother side and back unhurt. He attributes the priest's immunity to j\nthe ash, his calloused feet, and the mud with which he cleverly coated ;\nj\nhis legs when gyrating through the puddles, and his own to the fresh j\nash which formed during the 15 minutes he was kept waiting. )\nMr R. U. Sayce - has described an ember-walk by Indians in 1926 \\\nat Pieterniaritzburg, S. Africa, with a wealth of anthropological j\ndetail covering the daily life and food for ten days prior to the f\nceremony of the performers, upon whom strict sexual abstinence and j\nthought-control were enjoined, as well as the ritual perambulations (\nof a procession with the image of the goddess Draupadi about the ,\nfurnace, the slaughter of a goat and other matters which are not of j,\nmuch concern to us here. The pit was 30 feet long x 12 feet wide {\nand the walkers came up from the river, many with silver hooks in\np\ntheir backs and skewers through tongue and cheeks. They dipped |,\ntheir feet in turmeric water before, and milk and water after, the j\nwalk. [\nMany of the ritual details were obtained three years later from j\nprominent local Hindus and not from Mr Sayce's personal observa- ^\ntion. He was good enough to write to me on some doubtful points :\nj\nnamely the nature of the \" ashes \" over which they walked and the j,\nmethod of their preparation. The furnace was a mixture of ash and j\nembers some 9 inches thick, prepared by raking bonfires as the fuel ^\nwas consumed. This implies iron rakes and puddles from their cool- :\nj,\n1 Chambers'' Journal, March 1934. Man, 1933, 33.\n\f138] The Fire Walk 297\ning as ill Mr Beeching's case. The walkers are stated in his account\nto have been summoned from the river }vhen all was ready. There is\ninternal evidence that this was at least 200 yards away, but he does\nnot remember the distance. He did not apparently witness the\nperambulations of the idol (2| times round the furnace) which, with\nthe sacrifice, are said to have taken place after the return from the\nriver, all of which would have given time for a considerable deposit\nof ash. Most of the performers appeared to collapse after the walk,\nfor reasons which are obvious enough\u2014the long period of training on\nlight food, the walk to and from the river, and emotion. A number\nof them were accustomed to wear boots, he says ; their immunity\nwas not due to thick foot-soles. But it is clear that the thickness of\nthe ash may have compensated for this.\nAn interesting performance of the ember-walk at Suva in the Fiji\nIslands was witnessed by Mr S. M. White ^ in 1932. The performers\napproached the furnace (45 ft. x 15 ft.) of wood ashes (presumably\nembers and ash) from which all burning sticks had been carefully\nremoved, supported in a state of prostration by friends after fasting\nfor fourteen clays and a three mile walk from the sea. Continence\nhad also been observed. Headed by the priest they walked the\nlength quite slowly, some three or four times, with no sign of dis-\ncomfort, their feet sinking in the ashes, and one ploughing his feet\ndeep on the return journey. Many had skewers through their cheeks\nand fleshy parts of their bodies. The surface was white with ash\nafter tlie walk, but the lieat up wind was too great for the hand to\nbear for long at a height of nearly 6 feet. Paper thrown on burst\ninto flame at once. The heat down wind was like a furnace. The\nsingle crossing, he says, took at least half a minute, the longest time\nrecorded. This suggests a short (probably dancing) step of 18 inches\nevery second. There was no sign of blistering or burning even on\nthe delicate upper surface between the toes, and the soles were\nwhitish and soft after walking a distance through rivers and (an\nimportant point when coupled with a reference to washing after the\nfire walk) along muddy tracks. Their legs were therefore in all\nprobability coated with wet mud and their feet soft, which would not\nlessen the protective virtue of the callus. The ash was clearly deep\nat the start of the walk ; while porous it would let the heat radiate\nthrough ; when compacted by the foot it would, as before stated, act\nas a shield to the heat. It is clearly the \" premier pas qui coute \" :\nthe return journey along the compacted path would be far cooler. I\ndefer consideration of the great heat of the furnace in this and other\ncases until the whole evidence is before us, noting however that we\nare not told in what direction they walked as regards the wind. I\nwould call attention to the common tendency in these accounts to\nignore details (the wind, the tracks, and the mud, for instance)\n1 Jo\u00ab\/7(a\/ <S'.i*.i?., Jan. 1934.\n\f298 E. S. Thomas [part\nwhich while of great scientific importa.n.ce are not realised to be so\nby the observer.\nA simple case described by Capt. G. R. Hearn^ in which the panda\nor priest of a small temple had to plunge knee-deep through burn-\ning cowdung at the Holy festival as a duty attached to his office,\nis interesting from the fact that the secret of its successful per-\nformance is said only to be revealed by the priest to his successor on\nhis deathbed, and because having duly prepared himself by fasting\nand prayer, he is said to know when he is ready for the ceremony by\nthe insensibility of his fingers to the flames of a candle. In any case\nCapt. Hearn says, the flames are not very severe and he does not\nseem surprised to have found his legs unhurt and apparently the\nhairs thereon unsinged. The cowdung cakes covered apparently an\narea of 10 ft. x 8 ft. and were three feet deep, so that the ash was\nprobably very thick. In a case witnessed by Mr H. K. Beauchamp ^\nnear Madras in 1901, water was sprinkled all round the area of\nembers, 15 feet square and 3 or 4 inches deep, and we are at liberty\nto assume that the walkers gyrated in it as in the observant Mr\nBeeching's account. The walk took place at 6 p.m., i.e. after dark,\nthe fire of a ton of jungle wood and two cartloads of charcoal having\nbeen lit at noon. It is not surprising therefore to read that their feet\nsank into the loose bed of fire, as it would have looked and is des-\ncribed. And the apparent wading rather than walking was a variant\nwhich was probably introduced with impunity. A glutinous decoc-\ntion of aloe was reported to produce immunity to burns, but the\nperformers rejected the suggestion with indignation. Other decoc-\ntions are variously reported but without verification.\nIn Mr J. G. D. Partridge's ^ account of the ceremony performed in\n1902 in India, the priest after frenzied dancing sat in a swing-seat\nfull of 3 inch thorns without relieving his weight on the ropes. The\nthorns pierced his clothes but did not seem to hurt him and there\nwas no blood on his body. He constantly inhaled incense fumes.\nThere were two 9-foot pits, one filled with embers and the other with\nashes from a wood-fire. He took four steps in four seconds in each\npit, but this part of the performance did not impress Mr Partridge.\nThe case I reserve to the last ^ is the most arresting : a Moslem\nperformance in which some supernormal influence of the fakir or\ndervish seems to operate and wane at intervals. It was described by\nMr V. B. Stowell in a letter to his father which the latter sent to Sir\nOliver Lodge. The case was corroborated by his older friend Mr\nQuinn. The account was published in the Journal for June 1928.\nIt apparently took place on 22nd November, 1927. The performance\n1 Man, 1905, 83. - Thurston, E., Ethnog. Notes in S.

The fire trench full of embers was 12 feet\nlong, narrow and shallow. The writer and Quinn were told they\ncould walk without getting burned. They did so in their socks and\nfelt nothing. Afterwards they walked again, through, in addition,\nflames two or three feet high of rushes thrown on and ignited,\napparently with paraffin oil. After stepping out, an adhering cinder\nburnt a hole in Stowell's sock. While people walked, he says, the fakir\nwas \" worked up into a terrific state of excitement \". At intervals\nI\nof about a minute the power seemed to leave him and he shouted,\n''\n\" Bass, bass !\n\" (Enough !). Once Quinn failed to hop out at the cry\nand one of his feet was slightly scorched, but without burning his\nsock, which, he says, showed it was genuine. (But in this Stowell\nwas mistaken : Quinn states in a letter to Mrs Salter that his foot\nwas blistered and his sock scorched). The fire, Quinn states, (pro-\n'\nbably meaning the heat), was fierce and the embers red hot. Stowell\nsays the fire was too hot to sit close to. His woollen socks were \" not\neven frizzled \".\nA native friend told Quinn that this fakir alone had this power\nand that it was hereditary. He had fasted all day and collapsed\nrolling his eyes at the end. Many people walked, including cliildren\ni\nled by the hand, and finally the band with their instruments. An\nI\nIndian friend's account was also sent to Mrs Salter. He had walked\nI\nin his socks and only felt warmth. He related that the loin-cloth of\na Hindu caught fire as he stepped out of the trench and that he was\nnot even scorched, although a doctor present said he should have\nbeen severely burned. Many people of note attested to the walk\nover glowing embers and through flames under the aegis of this\nfakir Syed Hussein Atashi, including Lord Sydenham.^\nIn order to come to some decision regarding the hypernormality\nI or otherwise of this account I made a shallow trench 9 feet long and\n12 inches wide and filled it with hay. On this I laid folded sheets of\nnewspaper and a dozen bundles of fire sticks evenly spread, which\njust filled it. I lit the hay quickly ail along and as soon as the wood\nflames died down I walked across in thin slippers, taking five steps\non the embers. My shoes were quite unscorched, and here I may say\nthat for this reason I have omitted from this paper all accounts of\nwalking the fire in shoes,\ni\nI then walked in my socks, treading five times with four steps as\nin ordinary walking, taking three seconds in the process. I did this\nfour times, making the return journey at once the last time. By then\nthe glow was deeper in colour, probably due in part to deposit of\nash. I could feel it warm under my feet but there was no discomfort.\nMy socks were not even singed except where small embers clung to\nthem, and I felt these burn through the holes they made as I brushed\nthem off on the bank. (My sock soles (an old pair) were very thin,\n1 Journal S.P.R., October 1928.\n\f300 E. 8. Thomas\nnot to say threadbare in places). This was the cause of ray delay. 1\n\"\nClearly then the foot leaves the embers before they have time to\nburn. Yet my feet tingled and burned, but not painfully, for\nseveral hours afterwards. If the attention of the walker is dis-\ntracted by a call or startling sound, the distraction would lead\nprobably to a momentary halt upon one foot with consequent burn-\ning. In a large furnace, too, it is not surprising that a fall should, as\nin an early case in India related by Mr Stokes,^ lead to such severe\nburns on the body as to cause death : although the walkers passed\nthrough unscathed.\nAs regards Mr StowelFs immunity from flames knee-high, experi-\nmenting with a 6 foot stretch of blazing hay with flames more than\nknee-high I found I could walk it comfortably as before in four\nseconds without feeling any heat whatever. I did it three times, but\ndid not turn in the flames. I waved a piece of cotton cloth to and\nfro in the flames, and it caught fixe in from 3 to 4 seconds.\nMy small experiments then lead me to the conviction that there\nis nothing supernormal, as far as the evidence goes, in the immunity\nof persons who do the fire-walk in shoes or socks alone, with their\nlegs protected by clothing. And calloused foot-soles are thicker than\nsocks. I defer, as I have said, consideration of the possibly para-\nnormal aspects of the performance until we have considered the\nother fire-walk, over heated stones in Oceania (which I call the\nstone-walk), and to this I now turn.\nThe stone-walk in the South Seas presents us at first sight with\nseveral new and baffling factors. It is clear from many of the\naccounts that the dramatic and picturesque aspects of the perform-\nance greatly impressed the witnesses, and had inevitably impaired\ntheir critical faculties. The walkers are primarily members of a\nfamily, the Nga Ngalita tribe of Fiji who, they say, inherit the gift\nfrom an ancestor who received it from a deity in eel form. They and\ntheir assistants are arrayed for the ceremony in their picturesque\nnative costume of garlands and coloured dried leaf-strip skirts and\nother ornaments. The ceremony usually takes place close to the\nseashore in a coconut-grove, and all is animation and excitement.\nThe furnace is a pit 2 to 4 or more feet deep, and from 9 to 15 or\n20 to 30 feet in diameter. In it poles are sometimes, if not always,\nset radially to hold a pile of some 200 stones from 40 to 80 lbs. in\nweight, according to one observant witness. These are always of\nthe same rock, a very vesicular augite-audesite basalt. The fire is I\nlit and blazes 4 to 8 hours or more, but usually 36 to 48 hours. Un-\nfortunately no account tells us how the fire is fed : one can only\nsurmise that fresh wood is thrown on, which obviously would not i\nimpart anything like as much heat to the stones as the logs below, j\nWhen the .spectators gather, the stones glow white and red hot and\n1 Indian Antiquary, ii. 1873, 190.\n\f138] The Fire Walk 301\nare exploding and firing off flakes. Then with loud yells the pic-\nturesquely garbed assistants rush in with long green poles having\ntourniquet loops of creeper at the end and haul out the blazing logs.\nThe butts of the poles are next set in line along the surface and\nhauled like a rake this way and that with long creeper stems until the\nwhole is fairly levelled, and sometimes, if not always, a surface is\narranged of fire-split stones turned flat side uppermost. When all is\nready the leader emerges from the grove, usually in deep silence (in\ncontrast with the Indian ceremony), tall and dignified, garlanded\nwith flowers, carrying a branch of the Ti plant (the dracaena, whose\nroot is afterwards cooked in the oven), and walks across or round the\nfurnace or both. Others may follow, and finally the dracaena roots,\nwrapped in succulent hibiscus or other leaves, are laid on with a\nquantity of leaves over them. Clouds of steam rise as they pile\nearth on the top. Then it is left for four days, by which time it is\ncooked. The walk is thus a manifestation of inherited power, as\nwell apparently as a prelude to the dracaena season, and so a vernal\nceremony.\nTwo observers have attempted a scientific account of the stone-\nwalk and these I will consider first.\nDr Robert Fulton, M.B.^ observed it in June 1902 at Bega Island\nin the Fiji Group, where it is usually held. The fire, lit 48 hours\nbefore, was glowing fiercely on his arrival, and there was discomfort\nat a distance of 10 feet. The oven (lovo) was 20 feet in diameter and\n2 feet deep. The stones, he says, fairly glowed and there was little\nsmoke when after a further two hours the burning embers were re-\nmoved and the stones turned over and levelled. By this time, he\nsays, they had undoubtedly cooled, turning from white to red, then\n\\;\nto grey and black. The whole process of preparation, he thinks, took\nnearer two hours than one. The heat at the centre was still very\ngreat. The chief walker appeared from the grove and was examined\nby Dr Fulton and Dr Smith. His pulse was just over 90, his hands\nwere cool, his feet cold, perceptibly cooler than the rest of the body,\nclean and odourless. The soles were yellow-white, smooth like soft\nkid, as in fact they would be after the customary bathe, which is not\nmentioned. In addition to the native skirt he wore anl^lets of dry\nbracken. There were black hairs on his legs. He then, followed by\nsome twelve others, walked deliberately across and twice round the\nstones : Dr Fulton thought they walked round only, but he was\nassured by others that they crossed the centre. One of the men was\nexamined by Dr Duncan after the walk. His feet, the hairs on his\nlegs, and the dry fern anklet showed no signs of scorching or burning.\nHis pulse was 120, and (an interesting point) his feet still cool, if not\ncold, although the temperature of his legs was that of a person in high\nfever. People with cameras, accustomed to timing, said the walk\n1 Transactions of the N.Z. Institute, xxxv. 187.\n\f302 E. S. Thomas [part\nlasted 15 seconds : 25 to 30 steps were taken, so that the soles were\nnot in contact with the stones for more than half a second at a time.\nA stone 10 inches by 5 by 2 was removed for him from the centre\nof the oven. It was carried in a leaf basket to the shore, where it\nsteamed and fizzled for several minutes in water : even then it was\ntoo hot to hold. He lost it going on board when it slipped from its\nbasket and he found it too hot to save from falling into the sea.\nDr Fulton thinks the secret lies not in the calloused feet of the\nwalker but in the peculiar properties of the rock, which has a very\nlow specific heat and very slow conductivity. He does not think\n(but he offers no evidence for this) that the stones were heated\nthrough, and concludes therefore that the split surfaces were com-\nparatively cool. Unfortunately, he does not say whether the surface\nstones Avere glowing hot on his arrival. The walk, he further says,\ndid not begin till most of the stones were split, and he noted the pile\nhad not collapsed, inferring that the logs had not burned through.\nHe contends finally that the heat imparted to a foot in contact\nwould be a fraction of that given out by many other rocks in the\nsame time, and that in spite of the high temperature the heat given\noff would not burn the feet.\nIncidentally it should be observed that if 25 to 30 steps measure\ncircumference and diameter, then the diameter of the prepared\nsurface must have been about seven steps. In a case to be considered\npresently the step appears to have been about 12 inches.\nMr S. P. Langley ^ witnessed the stone-walk in Tahiti in 1901 and\nwas the first to give scientific attention to it. The pit was 9x21x2\nfeet deep. He ascertained the composition of the rock, weighed an\naverage stone, and estimated the number at 200, with an average\nweight at 40 to 80 lbs. The fire was lit at midday and burned till\n4.40, when the logs were removed. After such a short period it is\nnot surprising that the outer stones did not burn his hands, although\nthe lowest layers of stones, which lay four deep in the middle, were\nred hot. The upper central stones also gave out considerable heat.\nThe upper stones looked unsafe for naked feet, but an engineer told\nhim he had seen natives standing on steam pipes at 300\u00b0 F. The\nchief walker, Papa Ita, said he was able to walk through spells and\nthe aid of a goddess, after two or three days spent in prayer. He\nand two disciples in native dress walked when all was ready, the\nformer over the centre with hirrried steps, the latter half-way to the\nedge. He turned and walked back with deliberate confidence\naccompanied by new disciples who clearly picked a cooler path.\nAfter a third and fourth passage Europeans accompanied him in\nthin shoes which were not burnt, but the trousers of one were\nscorched, doubtless by the flames which were still occasionally licking\nup between the stones. He was now allowed to remove a stone from\n1 Nature, 22nd August, 1901.\n\f138] The Fire Walk 303\nthe centre of the pile upon which, he says, somewhat inconsistently,\nevery foot had rested. It was ovoid and the large end had been in\nthe hottest part of the fire.\nHe attempted to estimate its temperature in a bucket, but the\nebullition was so violent that a great deal boiled over. It continued\nto boil for ten minutes. The stone weighed 65 lbs., and the esti-\nmated temperature (for what it is worth) was 1200\u00b0. This rock, it\nwas found, glowed red hot between 1300\u00b0 and 1400\u00b0, but the tem-\nperature on the surface, he says, must have been indefinitely lower.\nHe found that after standing 8 to 10 seconds in his shoes on the\nhottest part of the pile the heat became unpleasant. He could there-\nfore have walked in his shoes for 16 to 20 paces. It is unfortunate\nthat he did not note the time taken on the walk by the performers,\nor spent by the assistants in preparing the surface.\nOne can hardly agree with Mr Langley when, while regretfully\ndeciding that there was nothing abnormal in the performance he\nwitnessed, he says he is convinced that he witnessed a typical stone\nwalk. The difference between his 4| hours and the 36 to 48 hours\nrecorded by others for the heating process, is considerable. His\ninformation regarding the physical and petrological characters of\nthe rock used is of great value, but his suspicion based on the use of\nthis stone and the reported refusal of Papa Ita to use a marble is ill-\nfounded. A siliceous rock of high specific heat would certainly slag\nand marble be calcined in the oven.\nI obtained a piece of olivine basalt about 4 inches square and about\n3 inches at its thickest, weighing nearly 4 lbs., of much the same\nspecific gravity (2-5 instead of 2-4), but not so vesicular, and I\nheated it in a coal fire all over for 3 hours and then removed it to the\nside of the grate. In three minutes it had lost its red glow. On\nanother occasion I left it on the coals in an anthracite stove for\n5 hours and then cracked off an inch-wide piece in the dark. It was\nonly red hot half through. The small piece I heated all day on a gas\nring and it was only red hot underneath. The rest of the stone I\nsubsequently heated all over with red coals for 4 hours. On removing\nthe covering coals and turning it over hottest side up, on the fire, it\nagain lost its glow in about three minutes.\nIt is possible to calculate that a spherical stone of 60 lbs. weight\nof the same unit weight (specific gravity) as mine would take about\nthrice the time to cool ; other shapes, such as oval, not so long. So\nwe may, I think, feel fairly sure that in 15 minutes any red-hot\nstones on the surface would have lost their glow, that is, would have\ncooled below red heat. Although I found, like Mr Langley, that the\nrock retains its heat afterwards for a very long time, from my experi-\nment it seems probable that after the logs are removed, the tops of\nthe upper stones would cool as fast or as slowly near the edge of the\nfurnace as in the hotter middle region. If so, it may be worth\n\f304 E. S. Thomas [part\nnoting, although we have no information as to the probable internal\nstate of the hot stones, that I was satisfied by experiment with my\nstone that I could have taken three steps barefooted with each (un-\ncalloused) foot on such rocks, heated all over and cooled in the hearth\nfor an hour and a quarter, which is about the time taken to prepare\nthe arena in Dr Fulton's case. After the same period of time I could\nhave taken 18 steps on the stone heated on the underside only and\ncooled outside the grate. Mr Langley thought the upper stones were\nnot heated through and were therefore much cooler on the flat sur-\nfaces when they were split, and this may well have been true in his\ncase at any rate.\nIf the stone Dr Fulton experimented with, which was about the\nthickness of mine, was a typical specimen, then the surface stones\nin his furnace would have cooled at about the same rate as my stone.\nIn spite of the 48 hours heating a great deal of heat must have radi-\nated away in the (say) Ih hours spent in the preparation. In the one\nof these two cases, then, we have a short period of heating and an\nunknown time spent in preparation ; in the other a long period of\nheating (but no information as to how the fire is fed) and a long time\nspent in making ready for the walk\u2014which may well have been\nintentionally protracted.\nBefore passing to further cases the probability should be borne in\nmind that when the logs burn at the inner end and drop, the cooler\nperipheral stones would tend to roll over the hotter inner stones. It\nis these that would be raked to and fro and form the upper layer. If\nthis does not happen the levelling would bring hotter stones to the\nsurface in the centre, which several observers have noticed to be the\nhottest part, avoided or hurried over by the walkers.\nBut in the absence of details regarding the fuelling of the pile and\nits behaviour during the long hours of heating, speculation about\nthese points, important as they are, cannot be very fruitful.\nPassing on to consider further cases, in one that took place in\n1904, witnessed by Mr W. L. Allardyce ^ at Bega Island, Fiji, the pit\nwas 30 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep, filled with stones and wood\nin alternate layers. The fire burned for 12 hours before being\ncleared of logs and levelled in the usual way. The heat, he says,\nwas considerable. A handkerchief laid on the stones (he does not\nsay ivhere in the pit) was charred. Twelve or fourteen men walked\nround and across, taking not more than a minute walking quite\nslowly. This pace suggests short quick steps of a foot in half a\nsecond. He examined the feet of the performers and there was, he\nfelt sure, no preparation applied before and no sign of burning after.\nHe attributes their immunity to walking barefooted on the very hot\nwind-sheltered sunbaked rocks. In this case we have clear indica-\ntion, I think, that the stones walked on were not red hot, but the\n1 Man, 1904, 45.\n\f138] The Fire Walk 305\nimportant detail of the time taken for the preparation is not\ngiven.\nIn 1933 Mr Kingsley Roth i\nsaw the ceremony at the same island\nwith a smaller pit 15 feet across and 3 feet deep. He tells us the\nstones were laid on logs which in his photograph are set radially.\nHe does not say how long they were left to burn, but there was\ndefinite discomfort 6 feet away. The clearing and levelling only took\n20 minutes. From a second photograph the stones seem to have all\ncollapsed into the pit and are shown covered with logs. The clearing,\nhe says, goes on until the stones are completely uncovered. A special\nlog was laid on the top during the clearing and left until the walkers\narrived. This was the path of the Power and no one might cross\nbetween it and the path by which the walkers were to arrive. Con-\ntinence was observed beforehand. They walked deliberately over\nthe stones with a firm tread, gripping them with the feet, and there\nwas no sign of burning afterwards.\nMr Basil Thomson's ^ experience at Bega is undated. The pit was\n19 feet wide and the fire had burned 48 hours. It was, he says, a\nwhite-hot mass shooting out little tongues of flame. The flattening\n(and presumably clearing of embers) took half an hour, and tongues\nof flame still played among the stones. Then with cries of \" Vutu,\nVutu fifteen men rushed out of the grove in pairs, and with appre-\nhensive looks stepped on to the stones, led by one Jonathan. But it\nis important and instructive to notice that, in this case, planting\ntheir feet firmly and squarely (the best way, incidentally, to distri-\nbute the heat over calloused foot-soles), they walked round the pit\nand not across it.\nA handkerchief was dropped on a large stone from the pit as\nJonathan stepped down, and what remained was picked up as the\nlast man left. In the 15 or 20 seconds [sic] which elapsed it was\ncharred where it touched the stone and scorched elsewhere ; clear\nevidence that it was not red hot or near it. A more instructive test\nwould have been to lower and raise a handkerchief on to and off the\nstone in time to the steps of one foot of one of the walkers. The fact\nthat the dried fern anklets of the walkers were not burnt, which Mr\nThomson notes, is not so significant as it would be had they crossed\na diameter of the oven. Mr Thomson is surprised that their insteps\nwere not burnt, but an instep which touched the ground would be\ncalloused to some extent, and not as soft as Mr Thomson thinks. He\nalso noticed the interesting point that their feet were cool after the\nwalk.\nDr Hocken's ^ account of the stone-walk witnessed at the same\nisland in 1898 is one of the best known and is interesting for\ndetailed observations of doubtful accuracy in places, as well as for\n1 Man, 1933, 49. - Lang, Modern Mijthology.\n2 Transactions of the N.Z. Institute, xxxi. 67.\nX\n\f306 E. S. Thomas [part\nunwarranted inferences. The stones were heated from 36 to 48 hours,\nthe pit was 25 to 30 feet in diameter and 8 feet deep at the deepest,\nfilled, he says, with white-hot stones. The temperature was 114\ndegrees on the windward side at the edge. When the pit was pre-\npared\u2014the time taken is not given\u2014the area of stones was only\n15 feet across. The walkers were greeted with yells from the crowd\n(in most accounts they approach in silence) and marched, as he\nthought, leisurely, but others thought quickly, across and around the\nstones, leaving where they entered. The leader was just 30 seconds\nin it, a rate of 2 feet a second as in Mr Allardyce's case ;\nshort quick\nsteps would account for the difference of opinion as to their manner\nof walking. ,\nDr Hocken had examined one of the walkers with the leader s\n(Jonathan's) permission and satisfied himself by touch, smell and\ntaste that their legs and feet had not been treated with any applica-\ntion. The soles were soft and flexible. He says nothing of the tem-\nperature of the feet. The same examination followed the walk.\nJonathan said he felt no heat or other sensation when walking.\n\" The stones \", Dr Hocken writes, \" must have been white hot \",\nbut not visibly so, owing, he suggests, to the brilliance of the day.\nHypnotism and anaesthersia may produce insensibility, he concludes,\nbut do not interfere with cautery.\nIt is clear, I think, that this account is not a very reliable one.\nThe pit could not have been full of white-hot stones, if they only\ncovered an area of about half the diameter of the pit after clearing.\nThe probability also is, for reasons shown above, that the stones were\nas they looked, neither white nor red hot on the surface.\nMr Haswell's ^ account refers to a ceremony at Kaiatea in 1885.\nThe fire burned for a day, the furnace was 30 feet across and 3 to\n4 feet deep. The flames poured up between the stones which were\nred and white hot. When all was ready and the furnace, he says,\nstill pouring out its intense heat, the natives marched up and walked\nleisurely across, repeating it five times. Here the strategic part of\nthe performance is dismissed with the words \" when all was ready\n\"\nand the general reader would assume that they walked over red and\nwhite-hot stones, blazing logs and all.\nI give this account as a good example of bad reporting. Also the\nfollowing :\nA Boston journalist, Mr Gorten ^ saw the performance at Honolulu,\narranged by Papa Ita, in 1895. All day the fire burned until the\nstones were white hot. \" Then \", he says (outdoing Mr Haswell)\nafter reference to incantations and gestures, \" the Tahitian calmly\nand deliberately walked the length of the pit \". On his return he\nstopped in the middle to be photographed. Mr Gorten, however,\nafter speaking of the fiery path, and white-hot stones, remembers the\n1\nLang, Modern Mythology. -Lang, Magic and Religion.\n\f138] The Fire Walk 307\npreparations, but explains tlieir object in unexpected fashion : in\nfact it is something of an anticlimax to read, \" The stones were un-\ndoubtedly hot and were turned by long poles just before walking to\nhave the hottest side up.\"\nAt the end of it we are told that Papa Ita was touring the Islands\nin the hands of a manager who, it was rumoured, was going to take\nhim to the Pan-American Exhibition at Buffalo. With that we take\nleave of Papa Ita and Jonathan (who may be the same person),\nunless one of them figures anonymously in the last and most sen-\nsational case I shall describe, namely that witnessed at Rarotonga\nin 1899 by Col. Gudgeon,^ who walked the hot stones with three other\nEnglishmen barefooted. It is a full account, but I only give the\nsalient details.\nThe oven was lit at dawn and his party went to the scene at 2 p.m.,\nwhen things were being got ready and the stones levelled. The\nTohunga and his pupil, after striking the oven in the customary way\nwith their bunches of ti leaves and muttering spells, walked slowly\nand deliberately over the 12 feet of hot stones. The Tohunga then\nhanded his bunch to Mr Godwin (who owned the site) with the words,\n\" I hand my ?mna to you : lead your friends across !\n\" They\nstarted, and \" I can only say \", he writes, \" we stepped out boldly.\nI got across unscathed ;\nonly one of the party was badly burned, and\nhe, it is said, was spoken to and looked behind, a thing against the\nrules I knew quite well \", he continues, \" that Twas walking\nover red-hot stones and could feel the heat, yet I was not burned \".\nHe \" felt something like electric shocks then and afterwards for\nabout 7 hours. ... A man must have niana to do it : if he has not,\nit will be too late when he is on the hot stones of Taira-ahi-roa.\"\nHalf an hour later the priest threw his green branch on the stones\nand in 15 seconds it was blazing. Col. Gudgeon's feet being natur-\nally tender, he walked slowly for fear of tripping. His soles did not\npeel and were not hardened. A troupe of 200 Maoris followed, of\nwhom \" many thought they were burnt but none were severely\nIn this dramatic description several useful details are lacking\n:\nthe rate of walking, the number of steps, the shape of the oven and\nits size, whether they walked across the centre or near the edge over\nthe 12 feet of hot stones, and how long the clearing took. If dawn\nis at 5 o'clock the fire had burned only 9 hours, and it is unlikely that\nthe upper stones would be heated red hot through in that time.\nOther accounts also speak of small flames licking up between the\nstones, as one might expect, after the large burning logs were with-\ndrawn. These, with a hot region selected by the Tohunga from\nexperience, would suffice to parch and ignite the green leaves very\nrapidly, and give quite a mistaken idea of the heat of the stones they\nhad walked on.\n1 Lang, Magic and Religion.\n\f308 E. S. Thomas [part\nIt is clear from his account that CoL Gudgeon was greatly im-\npressed by the scene and elated by his experience. The heat radi-\nating from between the stones gave him the impression that the\nstones he trod were of the same heat. If he took 12 steps over the\n12 feet distance, stepping 12 inches in half a second, each foot would\nhave touched the hot stones 6 times for half a second. How hot\nwere they ? In default of necessary details the presumption must\nbe that there was nothing abnormal in the immunity of Col. Gudgeon\nin his courageous performance.\nClearly the subject cannot be left without considering the great\nheat of the furnace both in the ember- and the stone-walk, as distinct\nfrom the temperature and nature of the surface trodden. We are,\nI think, justified in assuming the following points, except in the\nmore trivial examples of the ember-walk :\n1 . That there was more or less severe psycho-physical preparation\ncalculated to train the performer in auto-hypnosis, which would not\nonly give him faith, but render him more resistant and insensible\nthan ordinarily to the heat, and as well-known experiments with\nhypnotised subjects have shown, even to burning.^ We have\nevidence of its actual operation in the self-torture inflicted on them-\nselves by Indian walkers, as well as in the test, described by Captain\nHearn, in which the performer passed his fingers to and from a lamp\nflame until they were insensible and he felt ready for the ordeal. Col.\nGudgeon was clearly in a state of exaltation which would in some\ndegree have conduced to the same result.\n2. That a bath was taken before the walk which, cooling the limbs,\nwould contract the blood vessels and reinforce the effect produced\nby auto-hypnosis, supplemented in the Asiatic performances by the\nexcitement into which they worked themselves. ^ The coldness of\nthe feet after as well as before the walk, reported in two of the cases\nfrom Oceania, is of very great interest, and deserves scientific in-\nvestigation. In Mr Haggard's Japanese case alone do we hear of\nrepeated applications of cold water indoors as distinct from the\nbathe. The softening and soaking of the calloused foot-sole by\nwater would rather be an advantage than otherwise to the walker.\nIt is highly probable, I think, that Col. Gudgeon would have had a\ncustomary afternoon bathe not long before the walk. As the\nTohunga knew he was going to walk, it is not unlikely that he pre-\nscribed it.\n3. In some other Indian cases observers have noted the muddy\nstate of the legs of the walkers, others have referred to the water used\nto cool the rakes, or splashed about,^ and others again to small tanks\ninto which the walkers stepped before walking.\n4.

Walking sun-baked stones in the sheltered island\nof Bega may well have inured the soles and legs to heat, as Mr\nAllardyce suggests.\nThe heat endurable by a hardened foot-sole is greater than many\npeople reahse. We have Mr Langley's instance of natives standing\nbarefoot on superheated steam pipes. The Editor of Man speaks\n''-\nof a young acquaintance, a ship's engineer accustomed to walking\nbarefoot, who could hold a lighted match under his heel until it\nburned out, feeling nothing and showing no signs of burning.\nAs far as the e^ddence goes, then, the quick formation of protective\nash in the ember-walk, and the low conductivity of the basaltic rock\nin the stone-walk, the time taken to prepare the oven in both respects,\nthe effects of exaltation and self-suggestion, strengthened by ascetic\ntraining, in reducing the temperature and increasing the insensi-\nbility of the body, aided by cold bathing, and lastly the calloused\nfoot-soles of the walkers and their short quick steps, seem to relegate\nthe fire-walk to the class of phenomena whose abnormal element does\nnot transcend that of cases reported as of ordinary occurrence with\ngood hypnotic subjects. The cases where the abnormal element\nseems strongest suffer evidentially through the omission of im-\nportant details, and, apparently, malobservation of a serious kind.\nOne cannot conclude a study of the fire-walk without reference to\nthe striking classical examples in fairly recent times of immunity to\nfire, namely the experiences of Sir Wilham Crookes and others with\nD. D. Home,^ too well known to relate, which seem to rest on such\nexcellent testimony. But until more crucial evidence of the super-\nnormal in the fire-walk is forthcoming there is, I think, little justifi-\ncation for corroborating the evidence for the supernormal in the\nfire-walk by reference to them, and still less their cases by reference\nto the fire-walk.\n1 Man, 1904, 3Ia.\n2\n1 am indebted to Father Thurston for drawing my attention to his article\non Human Salamanders in The Month (Feb.-March 1932), in which these and\nother cases of similar imnmnity are described in detail.

Great emphasis is laid\non the tremendous heat of the furnace (c. 13 x 16 x 1 ft.) on which several\ncartloads of dry jDalm-leaves were thrown, through which people walked\nquietly.\n\fA NOTE ON THE RECENT EXPERIMENTS WITH\nRUDI SCHNEIDER\nBy Lord Charles Hope\nI HAVE read with much interest the report written by Mr. Th.\nBesterman and Mr 0.

The series of\nsittings were all held in London, April 1929 ; Oct. 1929 to Jan. 1930 ;\nFeb. 1932 to May 1932 ; Oct. to Dec. 1932 ;\nOct. 1933 to April 1934.\nThe first three series were held at the National Laboratory of\nPsychical Research under the direction of Mr Harry Price,i the\nfourth was arranged privately by me and some friends of mine {Proc.\nS.P.R., xli.) ; the fifth being his recent visit to the S.P.R.\nWhile in no way wishing to criticise the patient and conscientious\nexperiments conducted by Messrs. Besterman and Gatty during the\nrecent sittings with Rudi Schneider, I consider that there are several\npoints raised by this report and by their letter to Nature (14th April),\nwhich should be elucidated ;\notherwise, I fear, such readers as have\nnot closely followed the whole case and read the reports issued after\nformer series of sittings might, inadvertently, be misled as to the sum\ntotal of available evidence for the production of paranormal pheno-\nmena by this medium.\nFirstly, while it is nowhere stated in the Besterman-Gatty report\nthat these experiments with infra-red light apparatus disprove the\nresults reported by Dr Osty (\" Les Pouvoirs Inconnus de I'Esprit sur\nla Matiere, by E. and M. Osty), or those reported by Mr Herbert\n(Proc. S.P.R., xli.), it is possible that some readers might come to\nthat conclusion.\nIt should be noted that absorptions of an infra-red light beam\nhave been reported only at those series of sittings in which the tele-\nkinetic phenomena noted have at times been of considerable range\n' Harry Price, Eudi Schneider.\nBulletin IV. \"An Account of Further Experiments with Rudi Schneider \",\nby Harry Price.\nLord Charles Hope, and others, Proc. S.P.B., xli.\n310\n\fPART 138] Note on Recent Experiments with Rudi Schneider 311\nand frequency. In other words, although at sittings when absorp-\ntions have been noted there have often been no other phenomena,\nyet the two kinds of phenomena have alternated at fairly frequent\nintervals and on many occasions both kinds of phenomena have\nbeen reported as happening at the same sitting.\nIt is true that at only seven out of the seventy-seven sittings, con-\nducted by Dr Osty in 1931, were any telekinetic phenomena noted\n(whereas at the majority of the sittings absorptions were observed),\nbut it must be remembered that Dr Osty, for the greater part of his\nexperiments, concentrated on trying to obtain absorptions of infra-\nred beams rather than telekinetic movement of material objects.\nAlso, it is worth noting that during the majority of sittings Dr Osty\ndispensed with the usual \"cabinet \", and so the movement of the\ncurtains, which is much the most frequent and nearly always the\ninitial telekinetic phenomenon with this medium, was rendered\nimpossible.\nIt would seem to be a significant fact that at both those series of\nsittings at which no absorptions were reported (see Th. Besterman's\nreport, Proc. S.P.R., xl. 428-436, on sittings in Paris, Feb.-March\n1933, and the recent S.P.R. sittings, Proc. S.P.R., xlii.), no tele-\nkinetic movements of any importance were observed either. This\nwould seem to show that although it may be, as conjectui'ed by Dr\nOsty, usually easier for the medium to effect with his \" force \" an\nabsorption of an infra-red beam rather than to move a material\nobject by telekinetic means, yet when telekinetic movements are\nabsent from many consecutive sittings there is no reason either to\nexpect absorptions.\nUnfortunately, with the possible exception of some small curtain\nmovements and some rather indefinite \" touches \", no phenomenon\nof any kind was reported during the recent series of sittings at the\nS.P.R.\nIn Messrs. Besterman and Gatty's letter to Nature, and also in\ntheir full Report in Proceedings, the point is somewhat stressed that\nsmall curtain movements, such as had already been noted from time\nto time, continued after a \" check \" apparatus had been devised\nwhich registered nothing paranormal. \" In order to determine \",\nruns this letter, \" whether these (movements of curtains) were due\nto draughts, a strip of tinfoil about a foot in length was so hung\nabout 5 mm. from a vertical metal plate that a slight draught\nbrought them into contact and rang an electric bell. The whole was\nso placed that the '\nforce '\nhad ready access to it and that draughts\ncould not affect it. Under these conditions the bell did not ring,\nthough the curtain continued to move.\"\nIt seems to be quite probable that these small curtain movements\nwere indeed caused by draughts. It was not, however, made clear\nin the above letter or, I consider, in the full Report, that the \" force \",\n\f312 Lord Charles Bojm [part\nto effect the desired contact, would first have had to get behind the\ncurtains, enter a circular hole of '6\"\ndiameter in the lead box, and\nthen turn at right-angles and advance about 8\" before impinging on\nthe tinfoil which was only about 4\" in width.\nIt has frequently been noticed at former series of sittings with\nRudi, when really impressive phenomena have occurred, that it has,\nalmost without exception, been at the sittings at which the pheno-\nmena have been both frequent and varied that any degree of deli-\ncacy of aim or accomplishment has been achieved by \" Olga \". To\nmove a curtain even violently indicates no very great sense of\ndirection. To pick up objects, tie knots in handkerchiefs, touch\nsitters with the edge of a curtain after a warning to that effect has\nbeen already given by \" Olga \" and occasionally to place small\nobjects into or take them away from the hands of sitters, does need\na very considerable accuracy of aim and control of the \" force \".\nThe alternative theory, that when such movements have been\nnoted they have been achieved by means of the medium freeing a\nhand or foot, must of course be duly considered, but those who have\nhad the experience of controlling this medium while successful sit-\ntings have been held are almost unanimous in thinking that theory\nuntenable owing to the variety and continuity of the phenomena\nobserved while the controllers were satisfied tlie control of the\nmedium was perfect.\nAlthough to effect the desired contact in Mr Gatty's above-\nmentioned apparatus might have required even less strength than\nto move the curtains ever so slightly, yet it would certainly have\nneeded a much more complicated use of the \" force \".\nIn their letter to Nature, Messrs. Besterman and Gatty say, \" It\nhas been alleged that the trance personality is aware of what goes\non in the dark seance-ioom ; in these sittings this was not found to\nbe the case.\" In their full Report [Proc. S.P.R., xlii.) they give\ndetails of unsuccessful attempts made by \" Olga \" to describe the\nposition of a sitter's hand. This might be read as constituting a\nrefutation of the observations made by sitters at previous series of\nsittings, whereas in point of fact no such disproof was obtained.\nPersonally I have always doubted the supposed ability of \" Olga\n\"\nto \" see \" in the dark what the sitters are doing, although I think\n\" she \" has shown, on occasions, a certain hypersensitiveness of\nhearing and awareness to any unheralded experiment on the part\nof any of the sitters. But it is true that during the more successful\nsittings at which I have been present \" Olga \" has on several\noccasions displayed a very accurate idea of where such objects as\nhave been seen or heard by the sitters to move during the sitting\nwould be found when the white light was turned on at the end.\nThe red light used at the sittings was usually too faint and too\nrestricted in its area of illumination to explain how this could have\n\f138] Note on Recent Experiments with Rudi Schneider 313\nbeen achieved by \" Olga \", but a careful record of \" Olga's\n\"\nsuccesses and failui-es in that dii-ection would have to be kept over\na long series of successful sittings before any conclusion could be\ncome to. The experiment done in conjunction with Dr C. G.\nDouglas of Oxford, described in the Report and also in the letter to\nNature, in connection with the fast trance breathing hitherto so\nmuch conimented on, is of great interest. If this single experiment\ncan be relied on, and no doubt it was carried out with care, and we\nare assured the breathing of the medium while undergoing the tests\nwas typical of his trance breathing during ordinary sittings, then it\nwould certainly seem to disprove the result of Dr Osty's experiment\n(\" Les Pouvoirs Inconnus de I'Esprit sur la Matiere, p. 117) done by\nmeans of external measurements of the medium's chest while the\ntrance breathing was in progress. Dr Osty's experiment had seemed\nto show that the volume of air breathed by the medium in trance\nwas greatly above the normal.\nThe medium's brother, Willi Schneider, also a noted medium,\nwhen he was in a similar trance state, is said to have breathed in\nalmost as rapid a manner as Rudi. This rapid breathing of the\nSchneider brothers has been held to be unique among physical\nmediums, and the discovery that Rudi after all only inhales about a\nnormal amount of air into his lungs, brings their case more into line\nwith other impressive cases of physical mediumship, and supports\nthe theory that the fast breathing is an acquired habit and is not\nreally necessary for the production of paranormal phenomena.\nBoth authors of the Report claim to have duplicated Rudi's fast\nbreathing for considerable periods of time. I myself heard Mr\nGatty do a successful imitation of Rudi's trance breathing for over\nhalf an hour at a time during a sitting ; an excellent method of\ncomparison although one, perhaps, unlilcely to appeal to \" Olga's\n\"\nsense of uniqueness.\nThe result of the word-association and psychogalvanic reflex tests\nwith_ Rudi and \" Olga \" is of great interest and will strengthen the\nopinion of those observers of the mediumship (and they form a\nmajority) who had already come to the conclusion that \" Olga \" is\na secondary personality of the medium's. It is indeed unfortunate\nthat so much careful work and such a large financial outlav should\nhave gone unrewarded by conclusive results as to the chief pheno-\nmena associated with this mediumship, and disappointing to all\nconcerned that Messrs. Besterman and Gatty, after all their trouble,\nshould not have had an opportunity of judging of the value of the\nphenomena in question such as a single good sitting would have\ngiven them.\nAt the end of March 1934, thinking it would be of considerable\ninterest from a psychological point of view if the medium were asked\nto sit in a room in which he had previously produced impressive\n\f314 Lord Charles Hope [part\nphenomena (in 1929 and in Nov.-Dec. 1932), and to restrict the ,\nsitters as much as possible to those in whose presence he had given ,\nreally successful sittings, I invited Rudi to stay on in London for an\n|\nextra fortnight after completing his visit to the S.P.R. As pheno- ,\nmena were observed at the second and third of these extra sittings,\nhe eventually remained for three weeks, and gave in all seven\nsittings from April 4th to 20th. No apparatus to detect the presence\nof the \" force \" was employed, as there was not sufficient time m\nwhich to arrange this, and in any case the medium appears to think ,\nthat when his \" force \" is weak the use of such apparatus tends to\n|\ninhibit his powers. . .\nOwing to illness I was myself only able to attend the first sittmg,\nwhich was a blank. Fortunately, however, among the sitters who\nattended most of these sittings were Professor A. F. C. Pollard,\nProfessor D. F. Fraser-Harris, Mr C. C. L. Gregory and Captam the\nHon. Victor Cochrane-Baillie, all of whom had had considerable \\\nexperience with the medium during at least two of his former\nsuccessful series of sittings, and the last named had also attended\na large number of the S.P.R. series of sittings.\n|\nOut of the seven sittings held, four at least were positive (at a\nfifth one sitter thought there had been a small movement of the\ncurtain, but this was not corroborated by the other sitters and there-\nj\nfore was discounted). The phenomena observed consisted chiefly i\nof movements of the cabinet curtain, which was not hung with such\ndelicate adjustment as those at the S.P.R. had been, and therefore\nrequired more \" force \" to move them. While these movements\nwere at no time as large as have been reported at former sittings,\nthey were large enough on occasions to be seen by all the sitters and\nthe small bells attached to one curtain were fairly frequently heard\nto ring.\nThe sixth sitting was the best, and the movements of the curtains\nwere quite frequent and considerable. Mr Gregory was asked by\n\" Olga \" to hold a waste-paper basket near to the centre of the two\ncurtains. Accordingly, keeping contact with his neighbours, he\nbalanced the basket on his hands. He felt several tugs on the end\nof the basket nearest to the curtains and eventually it was pulled off\nhis hand on to the floor.\nA technique, new as far as I know, was developed by \" Olga \" at\nthese sittings. At the first sitting I was asked to hold the centre edge\nof the curtain nearest to the medium. I was subsequently asked by\n\" Olga \" if I could feel \" her \" puUing at it. I did not feel anything,\nbut at later sittings Professor Fraser-Harris, Mr Gregory and Mr\nC. W. Fisk all had the experience of feehng the curtain tugged and\nwhen held somewhat lightly it was several times pulled out of the\nsitter's hand.\nWhile in no way equal in variety or strength to the phenomena\n\f138] Note on Recent Experiments with Rudi Schneider 315\ndisplayed at earlier sittings in 1929 and 1932, the result of these\nextra sittings tend to show that Rudi Schneider has not lost his\npower of producing paranormal phenomena, and it is to be hoped\nthat either in Austria or elsewhere it will be found possible to con-\ntinue to experiment with him and see if the reported absorptions of\ninfra-red light beams can be repeated and more closely examined\nand the production of telekinetic phenomena proved to the satis-\nfaction of all.\nA Comment on the above Note by Mr Oliver Gatty\nI HAVE read with great interest Lord Charles Hope's \" Note on the\nrecent experiments with Rudi Schneider,\" and am very grateful to\nhim for elucidating a number of potential misunderstandings.\nThe report on the recent investigations of Rudi Schneider at the\nSociety for Psychical Research was confined almost exclusively to\nfacts observed during those sittings, both for the sake of brevity\nand in the interest of impartiality. If this has led to any misunder-\nstandings, I should like to apologise.\nLord Charles Hope raises the question as to the accuracy of the\nsingle experiment carried out on the respiration of the medium in\ntrance. Four samples were taken and also one of the medium in a\nnormal resting state. All five sets gave figures of substantially the\nsame order of magnitude, and this may be said to be a sort of check\non the figures. Further, the values for the respiratory coefficient\ndepend only on the composition and not on the bulk of the exhaled\ngases. Thus the possibility of error due to leakage of the valves at\nhigh speeds is not likely seriously to affect the conclusions drawn\n(see Proc. S.P.R., xlii. p. 261) from the data. The method of\nmeasuring total exhaled gases in a Douglas bag is superior to\nmeasurements of chest expansion (used by Dr Osty), since it also\nincludes the respiration due to movements of the diaphragm. It\ntherefore seems safe to conclude that there is nothing necessarily\nparanormal in the breathing of the medium, as it was also found\npossible to reproduce it at will.\n\fREVIEW\nThe Case for Faith-Healing, by J. D. Beresford. With a Preface\nby tbe Very Reverend H. R. L. Slieppard. London : G-eorge\nAllen and Unwin. Pp. 186. Price 5s. net.\nThe case for faith-healing can be made incontrovertible if care be\ntaken to indicate quite clearly the kinds of illness than can be cured\nby faith. It may be necessary to say what we mean by faith, what\nwe mean by illness and what we mean by cm-e, but in the everyday\nmeaning of these words it may be readily admitted that many con-\nditions which are obvious departures from health may be relieved\nif the sick person has a deep-seated conviction, however achieved,\nthat such relief will take place. The truth of this is most apparent\nwhen we are dealing with those forms of illness which are sometimes\nreferred to as functional nervous disorders. When, however, we\nhave to deal with illness due to or accompanied by gross organic\nchanges the effects of faith as a healing agent are much more obscure.\nWe are not justified in denying that physical changes may gradually\nbe brought about by mental influences, but all our knowledge of the\nphysical universe makes us sceptical when we are told that gross\nphysical changes, such as the lengthening of a bone, may take place\ninstantaneously as a result of faith.\nYet it is faith-healing of this kind which Mr. Beresford defends\nin this book, and it is because he accepts as already proven cures of\nthis kind that his work is of little interest to men of science. For\nexample, he says :\n\" I have good authority for the instantaneous\nhealing in February this year of a boy, with a retracted Achilles\ntendon and a malformation of the foot, due to infantile paralysis at\nthe age of nineteen months.\" Yet he very rightly adds :\n\" We can\nimagine a malignant growth changing its nature, dying out and be-\ncoming finally absorbed by healthy tissue. In such cases we can\npostulate a conceivable process that does not too greatly shock our\nsense of causation. But there is no conceivable natural process\nknown to us that will account for the instantaneous creation of\nmaterial necessary to lengthen the muscles, tendons and, in all pro-\nbability, bone of that child's leg by nearly two inches.\" Neverthe-\nless he believes in the truth of this story, for which he says he has good\nauthority, and he believes in the miracles of Lourdes\n\u2014\" cures\nvouched for by medical and ecclesiastical authority \". Being con-\n316\n\fPART 138j Revieiv 317\nvinced he says :\n\" I . . . am now content to try and find some more\nor less rational justification for the facts, rather than to spend my\nenergies in obstinate and unreasoning denial.\"\nThe aim of his book is the somewhat ambitious one of framing \" a\ncosmology that would admit the possibility of miracles \". He seeks\na rational justification of the facts, although he realises that there is\nno conceivable natural process known to us that will account for\nthem. For the production of miracles of healing he does not invoke\nany external power. The power that acts in faith-healing is a power\nwithin the self, and it is merely because we do not know all the laws\nof nature that we regard '\nmiracles '\nas a contravention of natural\nlaw. This power is attributed to a deeply hidden element of the self\nwhich is \" able to influence the rhythm of the organism, even to\nupset and rebuild the arrangement of the body cells \".\nMr Beresford's conception of the nature of this element of the self\nis not easily grasped, and in some ways his different accounts of it\nseem contradictory. He begins by insisting that man is not a single\nbut a multiple personality. He takes up the point of view adopted\nby Professor McDougall in his presidential address to our society and\nmaintains that \" the thinldng '\nI '\nof Descartes is the indiiferently\ncapable leader of a mixed and at times unmanageable team of other\n'I's ', some of which may remain throughout life beyond the reach\nof our conscious understanding \". He records that he came under\nthe influence of Myers' teaching on the subliminal self and he quotes\na passage from Maeterlinck about the \" Unknown Guest \". He gets\nthe impression from both these writers that the subconscious self is\na separate entity, and he repudiates this suggestion of duality\nalthough he admits that \" man is not a single but a multiple per-\nsonality \". In the end he says there is no such separate entity as a\nsubconscious self and no separated strata or levels of consciousness.\nRather is he inclined to assume that consciousness is present in every\nceU of the body ; and the totality of consciousness is the sum of the\nconsciousnesses of all the individual cells. Any group of cells that,\nas it were, think alike create a small superconsciousness within the\nconfederation that we know as the personality ; and to bring about\nany faith-cure of the kind that works apparent miracles, every\nelement of the consciousness must be temporarily in harmony. To\nbring this about there must be \"a complete submission of the\nintellect and critical judgment \". Only thus can the integration of\nthe personality necessary for faith-healing be achieved.\nBut, even with such complete integration of the personality as is\nimplied in the \" thinking alike \" of all the individual cells, we have\nno grounds for supposing that such integration carries with it the\npower to work miracles of healing. Behind the psychological\nchanges underlying integration of the whole personality Mr Beres-\nford is forced to postulate some spiritual immortal principle in man,\n\f318 Review [part 138\nwhich is developed by persistent effort through many incarnations\nand is related to that universal spirit which is the source of all life.\n\" AD matter is a temporal spatial expression of spirit \", and \" this\nbook is addressed without prejudice to all those who, however for-\nmally, subscribe to the idealistic account of the universe \".\nT.
