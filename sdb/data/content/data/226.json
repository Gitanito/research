He is a founding member and current director of research at the&nbsp;HeartMath Institute, a research and educational facility dedicated to researching the science of the heart since the 1990s.\n\nHe has appeared in numerous documentary films, such as&nbsp;The Joy of Sox,&nbsp;The Power of the Heart,&nbsp;Solar Revolution and&nbsp;The Living Matrix.  Research  Presentiment\n\nIn studies reported in 2004, McCraty and co-workers at Heartmath describe a conceptual replication of previous experiments1&nbsp;that suggested human physiology can respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced.\n\nParticipants\u2019 skin conductance levels and heart-rates were measured while they were shown images, during either a normal state of consciousness or a state of coherence associated with positive emotions. There was no change in skin conductance; however, a statistically significant change was noted in heart-rate (p&nbsp;= 0.001). Gender differences were noted in EEG data in the way individuals processed pre-stimulus information.2  Entrepreneurial Intuition\n\nIn a paper published 2007, McCraty, Bradley and Atkinson tested eight entrepreneurs for intuition in a roulette style game, the outcomes being determined by a random number generator. Skin conductance and heart rates were measured while participants made their guesses. Scoring was at chance, but both measures showed marked differences before winning and losing bets (p&nbsp;= 0.01).\n\nA second stage sought physiological evidence of intuition while individuals were making investment choices,3 but no evidence of this appeared.\n\nA follow-up study found emotional regulation training was effective in cultivating presentiment in heart rate variability responses for non-entrepreneurs.4  Energetics\n\nMcCraty has carried out studies on energetics, an energy transfer which it is proposed occurs between people or between people and living systems and objects (also referred to as \u2018bioenergy\u2019, \u2018subtle energy\u2019, \u2018biofield\u2019&nbsp;and \u2018bioelectromagnetic\u2019). These overlap with psychokinesis (PK) experiments carried out by parapsychologists. &nbsp;\n\nIn a study published in 1994, McCraty and Glen Rein, founder of the Quantum Biology Institute, tested the PK ability of participants schooled in an \u2018entrained\u2019 mindfulness technique, in which attention is shifted towards the heart and positive emotions. Participants were encouraged to enter this \u2018entrained\u2019 state \u2013 which was confirmed by electrocardiography \u2013 and attempt to change the molecular structure of water samples. UV spectroscopy revealed significant changes (p&nbsp;= 0.01) around 200 nm absorbance line, as compared to control water samples left in another room.\n\nOther experiments showed that DNA molecules unwound faster when in contact with the treated water than with the untreated water, at a marginally significant level (p&nbsp;= 0.05).5\n\nSimilar research by Tomasino indicated water sourced from the Catholic pilgrimage site of Mediugorje produced significant spectroscopic changes in DNA samples compared to untreated distilled water.6  Heart to Heart Communication\n\nIn a chapter in&nbsp;Clinical Applications of Bioelectromagnetic Medicine, in 2015, McCraty outlines an electromagnetic basis for heart communication within and without the body. Electromagnetic fields that are generated by the heart reach throughout the body and act to synchronize various physiological processes. McCraty highlights evidence demonstrating that the heart\u2019s electromagnetic energy is detectable by others up to several meters radius, providing a mechanistic basis for group coherence effects seen by Heartmath7&nbsp;and other groups.8  Geomagnetic Coupling\n\nIn experiments reported in 2017, McCraty and co-workers examined the possibility of a link between human physiology and geomagnetic fluctuations. Ten individuals going about their normal lives had their heart rate variability (HRV) continuously monitored during daytime for 31 days. HRV synchronized across the group after two days, giving evidence of the effect of environmental variables on collective cardiac function.9\n\nSimilar research in collaboration with Lithuanian scientists found significant correlations between local geomagnetic field fluctuations and the heart\u2019s electrical activity.&nbsp; Correlations changed from negative to positive during the work week, indicating the influence of fatigue on sensitivity to local geomagnetic fields.10\n\nMichael Duggan  Literature\n\nBradley, R., Gillin, L., McCraty, R.,&nbsp; &amp; Atkinson, M.
