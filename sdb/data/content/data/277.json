He was best known for his \u2018Million Dollar Challenge,\u2019 an offer to pay $1 million to anyone claiming miraculous abilities who could pass his test.\n\nParapsychologists disputed Randi\u2019s self-description as a paranormal investigator, viewing him rather as a crusading sceptic who employed polemics and dishonest practice to discredit scientific psi research. Some admirers were aware of his flaws, while defending his goals and motives. &nbsp;   Contents   \tLife \tSceptical Activism \tPeter Popoff \tPublic Hoaxes  \tProject Alpha \tCarlos   \tMillion Dollar Paranormal Challenge  \tTesting Dowsers \tPatricia Putt \tDerek Ogilvie   \tControversial Claims  \tUri Geller \tTed Serios \tTina Resch \tJacques Benveniste \tRupert Sheldrake \tGary Schwartz   \tParapsychology \tRecent Commentary  \tMainstream Obituaries \tCriticism and Support   \tBooks on Parapsychological and Paranormal Topics \tLectures, Television, Film and Video \tAwards \tLiterature \tEndnotes     Life\n\nJames Randi was born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge on 7 August 1928, in Toronto, Canada, to George Randall and Marie Alice Zwinge, n\u00e9e Paradis. He showed an early aptitude for magic, studying conjuring as a teenager after being inspired by seeing magician Harry Blackstone Sr perform. He dropped out of high school at age seventeen to join a carnival, working as a magician and mind-reader.1&nbsp;\n\nTaking the stage name James Randi, and later The Amazing Randi, Randi was inspired by the legendary escape artist Harry Houdini, of whom he later wrote a biography. Randi became famous for Houdini-type stunts such as freeing himself from an underwater coffin, or a straitjacket suspended over Niagara Falls. He went on to perform live worldwide and appeared frequently on television and radio shows, from children\u2019s programs to Johnny Carson\u2019s The Tonight Show. He once toured with the horror-inspired rock musician Alice Cooper, playing an executioner who appeared to behead Cooper with a guillotine.2\n\nRandi met his life partner Deyvi Orangel Pe\u00f1a Arteag (also known as Jos\u00e9 Alvarez) in 1986 when Pe\u00f1a was a 24-year-old art student. Pe\u00f1a became Randi\u2019s assistant. In 2011 Pe\u00f1a was arrested, having been revealed to be a stealth refugee from homophobia in Venezuela rather than an American as he pretended, and falsely using the name \u2018Jos\u00e9 Alvarez\u2019. Charged with aggravated identity theft, Pe\u00f1a faced a six-figure fine, ten years in jail and deportation to his homeland. However, a letter campaign launched by his and Randi\u2019s many friends in the art and sceptical worlds, along with charities to which they had donated, persuaded the court to lessen the charge and allow Pe\u00f1a to stay in the US. It is unclear whether Randi was aware of Pe\u00f1a\u2019s ruse. He and Randi were married in 2013.3\n\nRandi retired in 2015 and until his death in 2020 continued to live with Pe\u00f1a in Florida, giving occasional appearances and lectures.  Sceptical Activism\n\nRandi rejected religion from early childhood, saying \u2018I have always been an atheist; I think that religion is a very damaging philosophy&nbsp;\u2013 because it\u2019s such a retreat from reality\u2019,4 and, \u2018a belief in a god is one of the most damaging things that infests humanity at this particular moment in history\u2019.5 He began sceptical activism aged fifteen, attempting to publicly expose fraudulent s\u00e9ance activity being carried out in a church. For the disruption he was arrested and briefly jailed. The incident caused him to yearn for more of a position of authority from which to carry out debunking activity.6\n\nRandi gained fame as a debunker after appearing on The Tonight Show in 1973 together with Uri Geller, where he was later credited with having contributed to Geller\u2019s failure to perform his psychic feats. He continued to publicly denounce Geller as a faker. In 1976, he co-founded the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), together with Paul Kurtz, Ray Hyman, Martin Gardner, Carl Sagan and others, becoming the organization\u2019s executive director and public face.\n\nIn the 1980s, Geller launched libel actions against Randi and CSICOP. These were eventually dismissed, but the burden of legal fees on CSICOP led to Randi\u2019s acrimonious departure.7 Randi started his own debunking membership organization, the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF), in 1996, and later returned to the CSICOP as a Fellow.8 In 2015, JREF transformed itself into a granting body, providing about US$100,000 per year of funding to non-profit groups whose activities were aligned with its mission. It also ceased accepting memberships and donations.9\n\nRandi became a leading figure in the sceptic movement, through books, television programmes and other media appearances disputing the claims of psychics, parapsychologists and alternative medicine practitioners and carrying out media stunts to expose charlatans. He was known in particular for his Million Dollar Challenge, a monetary prize offered to anyone who could convince him they possessed psychic powers (see below).\n\nRandi stressed that he created illusions through tricks that can be explained logically rather than by psychic or paranormal powers. He had no educational or work background in science, stating, \u2018I am a professional conjurer and I have followed the minor music of Magic for more than four decades. As a conjurer, I possess a narrow but rather strong expertise: I know what fakery looks like\u2019.10\n\nRandi said in an interview he disliked being called a debunker \u2013 \u2018because that implies someone who says, \u201cThis isn\u2019t so, and I\u2019m going to prove it\u201d \u2019 \u2013 and that he preferred the term \u2018psychic investigator\u2019.11  Peter Popoff\n\nIn 1986 Peter Popoff, a televangelist and self-described faith healer, was definitively exposed by Randi and others by means of a radio scanner at a public event. This revealed that the information about audience members which he appeared miraculously to know was being fed to him by his wife through an earpiece. Recordings of the deception were played by Johnny Carson on his The Tonight Show, leading to Popoff\u2019s (temporary) disgrace and bankruptcy.12  Public Hoaxes\n\nSuccessful stunts created by Randi to fool investigators and the media are often cited by admirers.  Project Alpha\n\nIn 1980, Randi persuaded two teenagers interested in stage magic, Michael Edwards and Steven Shaw, to pose as metal-bending subjects for an experimental program on psychokinesis being conducted at the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research at Washington University.13 The eventual aim was for the pair to be tested by parapsychological labs throughout the world, as a means to discredit parapsychology as a scientific endeavor. The pair succeeded in fooling investigators during early experiments, but their ability waned as the protocols were tightened. No academic papers claiming positive results were ever published.  Carlos\n\nIn 1987, Randi persuaded his partner Pe\u00f1a to play the main role in a hoax in collaboration with Australia\u2019s 60 Minutes TV show, posing as a psychic channeler for a 2,000-year-old entity named \u2018Carlos\u2019. Randi primed Australia\u2019s media with press releases describing the (non-existent) channeling activities of \u2018Carlos\u2019 in the US, gaining bookings for him to perform on television across the country. During his appearances, Pe\u00f1a acted the role with Randi feeding him lines through an earpiece. Following a climactic appearance at the Sydney Opera House, fans proved willing to buy \u2018Carlos\u2019s Tears\u2019 for $500 each and an \u2018Atlantis Crystal\u2019 for $14,000 (no payment was accepted). The hoax was revealed a few days later on 60 Minutes.14  Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge\n\nIn 1964, Randi began offering a $1,000 cash prize to any psychic who could pass tests devised by himself. The sum on offer was increased to $10,000 for some years and eventually grew to $1 million, managed by JREF. It would be handed to any claimant who could successfully demonstrate any psychic, supernatural or paranormal ability under testing conditions agreed to by both the tester and JREF. The prize was never claimed and the offer was terminated in 2015. (A similar monetary award, for $250,000, is currently being offered by the&nbsp;Center for Inquiry Investigations Group.)\n\nJREF promoted the Challenge as \u2018a tool that people everywhere can use to evaluate paranormal and pseudoscientific claims, by asking, \u201cif this claim were true, why hasn\u2019t someone proven it and won the million?\u201d \u201915 It continues to be cited by scientists as a main reason for disbelieving the claims of psychics and parapsychologists.16\n\nCritics noted that its p-value requirements were far stricter than those generally used in science, and that since it ignored the standard scientific requirement for replication, its results are meaningless, a point made even by sceptic psychologist Ray Hyman. He wrote: \u2018Scientists don\u2019t settle issues with a single test, so even if someone does win a big cash prize in a demonstration, this isn\u2019t going to convince anyone. Proof in science happens through replication, not through single experiments.\u201917\n\nRandi has been quoted as saying, with respect to the possibility that someone might succeed at the challenge, \u2018I always have an out.\u2019 He later asserted that the full quote was, \u2018Concerning the challenge, I always have an out: I\u2019m right!\u201918  Testing Dowsers\n\nIn an investigation filmed in March 1979 by an Italian TV company, Randi tested the ability of four dowsers to detect water flowing in underground pipes set up in a field near Rome. A successful demonstration would win $10,000, the size of Randi\u2019s cash award at the time. Dowsers indicated the position of underground pipes by placing pegs in the ground: a demonstration would be considered successful if two-thirds of the pegs were within eight inches of a pipe. In an account published Skeptical Inquirer, Randi describes the failed attempts of all four.19  Patricia Putt\n\nIn 2009, a preliminary test was carried out into claims by a British professional spirit medium Patricia Putt. Ten subjects were each given a reading, with the aim that five or more would later identify which of the ten was accurate for them. None of the matches was accurate.20 &nbsp;  Derek Ogilvie\n\nIn May 2008, JREF tested British psychic Derek Ogilvie, who claimed to be able to read the minds of babies, as an episode of Channel 5\u2019s \u2018Extraordinary People\u2019 series.21 Infants picked a numbered ball out of a bag, which indicated a certain object that they were then given to hold. Ogilvie, isolated in a sound-proof room, tried to identify the object, but scored at chance levels.  Controversial Claims\n\nMany claims by Randi to have exposed paranormal claimants, accepted as definitive by many sceptics, are considered by critics to be weakly evidenced, speculative or invented (Randi agreed in an interview that he sometimes lied for effect, whether consciously or unconsciously he was not always sure).22  Uri Geller\n\nRandi\u2019s exposure of Hungarian-Israeli psychic Uri Geller rested on his claim that he could duplicate his tricks by sleight-of-hand and his description of how this is done. Many other stage magicians who observed Geller expressed doubts that what they witnessed could be achieved by trickery, notably the effect of a key or spoon&nbsp;continuing to bend when he had stopped touching it, and sometimes when he was no longer present.23\n\nRandi's 1973 appearance with Geller on The Tonight Show boosted his profile as a paranormal debunker and started a long-running public feud between the two. Randi advised the producers beforehand to ensure that any props such as metal cutlery be provided by them rather than by Geller, to guard against trickery.24 On the show, Geller was asked to identify which of a set of nine canisters contained water, but failed and complained of being pressured. He was somewhat more successful when attempting to exert psychic force on a spoon held by a fellow guest, which showed a slight bend, but the dominant impression was negative, and the incident is widely cited as evidence against Geller\u2019s claims. However, some viewers were impressed, and his appearance led to him being booked for the Merv Griffin Show, effectively launching his career in the US.25\n\nIn 1975, Randi published The Magic of Uri Geller (later retitled The Truth About Uri Geller) claiming to expose Geller as a faker, and continued to attack him publicly. Although Geller\u2019s legal suits failed, he has credited Randi\u2019s pursuit of him with helping him to achieve stardom, calling him \u2018my most influential and important publicist\u2019.26  Ted Serios\n\nIn 1967, Denver psychiatrist Jule Eisenbud published an account of his detailed investigations of demonstrations of \u2018thoughtography\u2019 by Ted Serios.27 Randi claimed on the Today morning television program that he could reproduce these feats by sleight-of-hand, and under the same conditions that Serios had been subjected to in controlled conditions. It is not clear whether Randi understood that this would have meant being strip searched, including a thorough examination of body orifices, then clad in a monkey suit and sealed in a steel-walled, lead-lined sound-proof chamber. Pressed to make good on his claim, Randi subsequently declined to be tested, as correspondence \u2013 suppressed by Randi at the time \u2013 now clearly shows (see here).28  Tina Resch\n\nIn March 1984, media attention on poltergeist activity associated with Tina Resch, an American teenager, attracted the attention of CSICOP. Randi and two colleagues went to investigate, accompanied by reporters and TV crews.29 However, on the advice of parapsychologist William Roll, who was himself investigating the incident, the Resch family refused to meet with Randi or admit him into their home (they were prepared to admit his two colleagues but they declined). Randi\u2019s subsequent claim that Tina faked the phenomena, largely based on his analysis of photographs,30 was disputed by Roll and others.31  Jacques Benveniste\n\nIn 1988, Randi took part in an intervention to discredit claims by Jacques Benveniste, a French immunologist, to have demonstrated that water can retain a biologically active memory of a substance that it no longer contains (a principle underlying homeopathy). Randi accompanied science magazine editor John Maddox and scientific fraud investigator Walter W Stewart to Benveniste\u2019s laboratory, where they claimed to have conducted failed replications and uncovered experimental flaws.32 Benveniste and his supporters disputed their findings.33  Rupert Sheldrake\n\nIn 1998, biologist Rupert Sheldrake published a study suggesting the existence of a telepathic bond between a dog and its owner. Sheldrake later came across an article in which Randi was quoted saying in relation to canine ESP, \u2018We at the JREF [James Randi Educational Foundation] have tested these claims. They fail.\u2019 In an email replying to Sheldrake\u2019s request for clarification, Randi indicated that these tests were not done at the JREF, but were \u2018informal\u2019 tests of dogs belonging to a friend and done some years ago. According to Sheldrake, Randi added: \u2018I overstated my case for doubting the reality of dog ESP based on the small amount of data I obtained. It was rash and improper of me to do so.\u2019  Gary Schwartz\n\nIn 2001, scientist Gary Schwartz\u2019s mediumship research attracted a critical response from Randi titled, \u2018May the Schwartz Be with You, the Tooth Fairy's Existence Proven by Science!\u2019, dismissing&nbsp;it&nbsp;as \u2018games and amateur probes\u2019.34 In a response published online, Schwartz asserted that Randi\u2019s criticisms \u2018lack understanding and integrity\u2019 and answered them point by point.35 More substantive criticisms were made by sceptic psychologists.36 &nbsp;  Parapsychology\n\nRandi expressed contempt for parapsychologists, whom he called by such names as \u2018psi-nuts\u2019 and \u2018wide-eyed nincompoops\u2019.37 But he seldom criticized laboratory-based psi testing in any detail and appeared to lack substantive knowledge of what it involves. In 1982 he published an eight-page pamphlet, Test Your ESP Potential: A Complete Kit with Instructions, Scorecards and Apparatus, describing how ESP-tests are administered and how to avoid pitfalls. According to a reviewer, parapsychologist Ramakrishna Rao, Randi seemed not to not know how to design and conduct an ESP test, and lacked understanding either of double-blinding or the problems involved in recording errors. Furthermore, the statistical table he provided appeared to have been produced by an amateur, while the test cards were of such poor quality, the symbols were visible from the back.38\n\nAbout Randi\u2019s 1995 book An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural (published in the UK as The Supernatural A-Z), fellow sceptic Susan Blackmore wrote that it \u2018might have served as a useful entry into the whole subject but I am sorry to say that it has too many errors to be recommended in this way\u2019.39\n\nA representation of parapsychologists\u2019 views on Randi\u2019s work can be found here.  Recent Commentary\n\nRandi\u2019s death in October 2020 was extensively reported.  Mainstream Obituaries\n\nObituaries in mainstream outlets were generally laudatory. The Guardian described his paranormal \u2018debunking\u2019 in positive terms referring to the Million Dollar Challenge and lamenting the death of an \u2018effective sceptic\u2019 in the age of anti-vaxx, anti-5G and anti-Covid-19 conspiracy theories. CNN, New York Times and Daily Mail&nbsp;made similar assessments, citing his role in the founding of CSICOP&nbsp;and his \u2018debunking\u2019 of Uri Geller on The Tonight Show in 1973. Rolling Stone Magazinequoted science populariser Bill Nye: \u2018He left the world better than he found it. He will be missed.\u2019  Criticism and Support\n\nA critical article in Boing Boing by Mitch Horowitz characterized Randi as \u2018the man who destroyed skepticism\u2019.&nbsp;Expressing views commonly held by the targets of his attacks, Horowitz compared him to Joseph McCarthy as \u2018a showman, a bully, and, ultimately, the very thing he claimed to fight against: a fraud.\u2019 He charged that Randi smeared serious researchers like JB Rhine and Dean Radin and made claims that he could not back up, for instance citing the claim of failed replications of pet telepathy.\n\nHorowitz also queried what the JREF does with its considerable monetary resources, and the level of executive compensation at JREF, which at an average $197,000 is nearly three times the compensation of nonprofit CEOs in its revenue class.40\n\nResponding to Horowitz in his blog, David Gorski conceded that Randi was a \u2018complicated\u2019 and \u2018polarizing\u2019 figure, whose \u2018flaws\u2019 included an early scepticism of climate science, which he later reversed; a \u2018tendency to say stupid things on occasion\u2019, for instance comments that appeared to support eugenics, for which he later apologized; and a failure to the combat the \u2018tolerance for misogyny and sexual harassment at TAM\u2019. However, he went on to defend Randi, calling Horowitz\u2019s article a \u2018hit piece\u2019 that uses \u2018the sorts of rhetorical devices that skeptics have seen many times before from believers in woo\u2019.41\n\nIn an article in Slate Magazine, Skepchick&nbsp;founder Rebecca Watson detailed her personal journey with Randi and the sceptic community from the late 1990s. She writes:  \n\nI got to know him as a sweet, kind, and complicated person. He treated everyone he met as the most important audience he\u2019d ever have. He would randomly perform sleight of hand to the delight of everyone around him and needed no encouragement to launch into fascinating stories from his long and weird life. I saw him perform the same magic tricks dozens of times, and even well into his 80s I never saw his wrinkled hands slip up. I heard him tell the same stories dozens of times, and, as a true performer does, he only made the details more interesting and engaging each time.\n\nAs Watson relates, from 2010 she began to complain of sexism in the sceptical movement, campaigning for the male majority to be \u2018more accepting of (or at least to stop randomly groping and awkwardly propositioning) women\u2019. She complained that she got no help from Randi, who she said criticized her to others about trying to change the culture of the movement he founded.\n\nShe concludes:  \n\nI mourn for Randi, but I also mourn for what could have become of the movement he fathered. His undeniable charisma and showmanship motivated thousands to care about skepticism, but his stubbornness and inability to adapt may have doomed the skeptic movement to extinction.42\n\nIn a separate piece responding to Horowitz, Watson poured scorn on his defense of parapsychologists, but conceded that some of his criticisms were justified, for instance that Randi exaggerated feats such as Project Alpha.  \n\nDecades later, the story Randi would tell was that these researchers were completely fooled, refused several of Randi\u2019s offers to help them detect fakes, and published several papers about the \u201cpsychic\u201d boys. In fact, the researchers were sort of fooled, eventually did ask for Randi\u2019s help, and never published any peer-reviewed papers (though they did give one credulous talk at a conference).43\n\nWatson adds that Randi similarly exaggerated the effect of his&nbsp;\u2018Carlos\u2019 hoax, pointing out that \u2018the Australian media&nbsp;was pretty sceptical of Carlos, and the theater that Randi claimed had been \u201cpacked\u201d to see him was about half empty according to the Australian Skeptics organization\u2019.
