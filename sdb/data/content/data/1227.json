I have alfo expunged much ex-\ntraneous matter inftrted in the firft impref-\nfion. I fhall briefly obferve to my candid\nReaders the antiquity of this fcience : Jo-\nfephus mentions that the Patriarchs practifed\nit j after that the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and\nArabians: and it is certain it is in prefent\nule among thePerfians ; the modern hiftory\nof which informs us, that the chief Aftro-\nloger to the Perfian monarch has a penfion\nof io,oocl. per ann. They term*A\u2018ftrology\nthe\n\f1\nxli INTRODUCTION,\nthe Revelation of the Stars ; and Aftronomy\nis ftudied in Perfia purely for the fake of it.\nThe King and great Men will not undertake\neither pleafure or bufinefs, without firft con^\nfulting an Aftrologer; the bulk of whom\nreceive from the King gifts to the amount\nof 100,000 1 .\nper ann. They give judge-\nment principally from the Moon, and feem\nmuch to regard the tarth. The reafon that\nthe Aftrologers have more (kill here than\nelfewhere, is, we are told, becaufe the Air\nis drier, and purer; by which means they j\nhave a better opportunity of obferving the\nmotions and afpedls of the Stars. This i\nfcience is the principal end of all their du-\ndies; and a perfon is looked upon to the ,\nlaft degree fbiipid and ignorant, who fpeaks.\nfiightly of it. Indeed, I perceive that ini|\nall things relative to it they are too fiiper- i\nftitious. Entering into a detail of the*\nj\nenfuingWork I fliall omit; as the Contentsj |\nat the end, and Title, amply Hiew it.\nWithout troubling my Readers with a:\nj\ntedious Preface, I think the beft and fureft ^\nmode of conquering the prejudices of every\nperfon, is to furnilh them with materials to i|\njudge for themfelves, that they may fee on\nwhat foundation this Science reds.\nI fliall next proceed to make the Reader\nacquainted with the Signs of the Zodiac. ^\nand their charaders,\nA S T R O.\n\fThe Explanation i$ the Frontispiece.\nAccording to the definition of the Twelve Houfc*\nof Heaven, delcribed by that mod learned and excellent\nphilolbpher MorinuSy the Life of Man may be- divided into\nfour didinit periods, or ages, in f\u00abmc meafure agreeable to\nthe Plate ;\nnjinr,.

The Signs are emblematically placed on the\nCufps or Lines of the Houfes. In the conftruftion of Maa\nwe difeover four Affeclions, vii. Life, Antony Marriage, and\nPaJJion ;\ntht-fe agiec with the Rife, Perfeilion, Declination,\nand Termination, of all Things, and comprife the whole\nEtfecl* and Operations of Nature. But to be brief ; Life,\nin the Syftem of Nature, is regulated by the Eall angle of\nthe Heavens, called the Afcendant ;\nAction, by the South\nangle, or Mid Heaven; Marriagey by the Weft angle; and\nPajfxon, by the North angle of the Heavenly Frame : And\nhence aiife four Triplicities of the fame genus or gcnerical\nnature, and twelve Houfes. The firft Triplicity is of the\nEaftern angle, attributed to Infancy, called the Triplicity of\nLife, and includes the ift, 9tb, and 5th Houfes, which behold\neach other in a partile Trine. The fecund Triplicity conlifts\nof the angle of the Mid Heaver, 6th and 2d Houfes; this\nappertains to Vigour and AiSfion. The third Triplicity has\nthe government of the yth, 3d, and nth Koufes ;\nin this\ndstage of Life, Man is joined in a Tie or Obligation, inBodv,\nin Blood, and in Friendjhip. The foin tli and laft Triplicity\nis that of Palfion, and includes In it the 4.th, 12th, and 8ih\nffoufes ;\nand thefe conftitute, as well as the reft, a p^itlle\nBrine in the Equator: it comprehends the three clatTes of\nhuman afflictions; Decay ot Life, Sonow, and Death.\nWherefore, according to the fecond motion of tlie Planets,\nfrom Weft to Eaft, an entrance is made out of the 8th into\nthe 9th Houfe, which it the Houfe of Life in GOD, where\n(the imiuona!

But the reafoni\nwhy the Sun s courfe begins, and is reckoned frorni\nAries, as tiadiiion infornit. us, is, the Sun, w'heni\nbrought into exigence, was placed in thisfign::\nand this is a very rational conjeaure, fince'the\n\u2018 quarter begins when the Sun enters Aries,,\nand brings with it increafe and length of days ;;\nall\n\f[ 3 ]\nall Nature then begins to multiply and flourifh,\nand alTumcs, as it were, a new refurrcdlion.\nThefe fix northern fip-ns terminate with V^irf^'o;\nand the fix fouthern commence with Libra.

This planet Ij:\nfurrounded by a thin, broad ring, fomewhat re-;\nfembling the horizon of an artificial globe ;\nanc.\nit appears double, when feen through a gooe,\ntelefcope.

Hence ihe difappears when\nfhe comes between us and the Sun , becaufe her\ndark fide is then towards us. When Hie is orone\nO\na little way forward, we fee a little of her en-\nlightened fide, which Hill increafes to our view\nas fhe advances forward, until Hic comes to be\noppofite the Sun; and then her whole enlightened\nfide is, towards the Earth, and Hic appears with\na round, illumined orb, which we call the Full\nMoon; her dark Hde being then turned away\nfrom the Earth.

It may be thought fur-\nprifing, atftrft, that Venus fhould continue longer\non the eaft or weft fide of the Sun, than the whole\ntime of her period round him. This difficulty\nwill vanilli when we confidcr the Earth is all the\n,\nwhile\n\f[ 32 ]\nwliile going round the Sun, tlie lame way, though\nnot lb quick, as Venus ;\nand therefore, her rela-\ntive motion to the Earth mul>, in every period,,\nbe as much llowcr than her abfolute motion in;\nher orbit, as the Earth, during that time, ad--\nvances forward in tlie Ecliptic, which is 220 de--\ngrees.

He com-\npletes his revolution in 87 days and 23 hours of\nour time, nearly, which is the length of his year j\nbut beingfeldom feen, on account of his proximity\nto the Sun, and having no vifible fpots on his\nfuiface or diflc, the time of his rotation upon his\nown axis, and the length of his days and nights,\nare yet unknown to us. His diftance from the\nSun is computed to be 32 millions of miles; and\nhis diameter 2600; he moves round the Sun\n95^000 miles every hour, and receives from that\nluminary a proportion of light and hear, near\nfeven\n\f[ 34 I\nleven times as great as that of the Earth. At\nthe time he becomes vifible, he appears of a bright, J\nlilver colour, though generally faint and dulklihrt\nto the naked eye; and is never more than 27J\u2019\ndegrees from Sol.\nMercury is the leaft of all the planets ;\nir\nnature cold, dry, and melancholy ; he is either,\nmafeuline or feminine, lucky or unlucky, as his\npofition in the heavens happens to be ;\nor he is Ir 1\nafpeft with other planets evil and mifchievouSr,|\nwhen in conjundlion with.

His diameter is com-\n>uted to be 76,300 miles; and by the various\nttraftions of the circumvolving planets, he is\ngitated by a fmall motion round the centre of\n;ravity in the fyllem. He pafles through the\nwelve figns of the Zodiac in 365 days, 5 hours,\n\u20228 minutes, 57 feconds ; which forms the tropi-\n|al or folar year ;\nby which fiandard all our pe-\n5ods of time are meafured.

The folar man is not of man\nwords ;\nbut when he fpeaks, it is with confidenc(\nand to the purpofe : he is ufually thoughtfu\nfccret, and referved : his deportment is ftaiel\nand majeftie ;\na lover ot fumptuoufnefs and mac.\nnificence ; and pofTefles a mind far Superior 1\nany lordid, bafe, or difltonourablc pradlices.\n\f[ 37 ]\nIf the Sun be ill dignified, then will the native\nbe born of a mean, loquacious difpofition ; proud,\nand arrogant; difdaining all his fuperiors, though\na fycophant to them ; of a fhallow ui^derflanding\nand judgement; reftlefs, troublefome, and domi-\nneering; of no gravity in his condu\u00ab5l; prone to\ncruelty, mifchief, and ill-nature. <\nDifeafes of the Sun ; all palpitations and\ntremblings of the heart; fainting and fwodning;\nweaknefs of fight; violent fevers; choler ; dif-\norders of the brain ; cramp; foul breath; difor-\nders of the mouth and throat ; catarrhs ; and\nking\u2019s evil.

Thefe are\nneither figns nor conftellations, but are qnly the\n.nodes or points wherein the Ecliptic is interfeaed\n.by the orbits of the planets, and particularly that\n\u2022of the Moon ; making with it angles of 5 degrees,\n18 minutes. One of thefe points looks northward,\nT the\n\f[ 38 ]\nthe Moon beginning then to have northern lati-\ntude j and the other points louthward, where fh\u00a9\ncommences her fouth latitude.

But the j\nDragon\u2019s Tail we have always found pf an evil }\ntendency; whenever joined with evil planets,\ntheir malevolence is doubled; when joined with\ngood, their beneficial influence is much abated. j,\nPART OF FORTUNE \u00ae. 1,\nNext to the Nodes, the Part of Fortune has ,!\nIts operations upon the twelve houfes.

This done, I refer to the next column in\nrotation on the left hand, and in the fame line\nwith the 2 degrees of Leo 1 find 6, and looking\nto the top of the column find it to be 6 degrees of\nj\nthe fign WR, with iith Houfe over it; and there-\nfore 1 place 6 degrees of Virgo upon the Cufp of\nthe nth Houfe. I follow the fame rule with the\nnext column, where I find 3 in the 3d line ;\nat\nthe top I fee 12 rO: ;\nand accordingly place 3 de-\nI\ngrees of Libra on the Cufp of the 12th Houfe,\n;\nThen I refer to the next column, where I find\nj\n24 . 3, and at the top the word Afccn. with the\nfign prefixed, which fignifies that 24 deg. 3 m.\n, occupy the ift Houfe or Afcendant, w'hich I place\n'\naccordingly, leaving out the 3 minutes, v\/hich\n'\nare immaterial. I then refer to the next column ;\nand even with the preceding figures Hands 21 ;\nwhen looking up the column, I obferve the fign ni,\nand 2 at the top, w'hich fhews that 2 1 degrees of\nScorpio are to be placed on the Cufp of the 2d\nHoufe.

Thus the;\nfix oriental Houfes, namely, loth, nth, 12th,,\nift, 2d, 3d, are furnifhed with the degrees of eachi\nfign then rifing upon them; and the other ffx, or-\noccidental Houfes, being oppofite to the former,,\nare always furnifhed with the fame degrees of the*\n'\noppofite figns ; thus; \u2022\n'\n4th Houfe is oppofite loth\n5fh\n6th\nift\n2d\n3^5\nnth\n12 th\n7th\nSth\n9th\nifi: 'Y' is oppofit\n2d \u00ab\n3d li\n4th 05\n5th a\n'6 th\ne rOr 7th\n- nj. 8th\n- 4'\n9 th\n- kf loth\n- xcr nth\n' X 1 2th-;\nt:\n(\ni\n5\nSo that the loth Houfe is oppofite to the 4th. i\"\n\u00abnd the 4th to the 10th; the nth to the 5th: t\na^d the 5th to the nth; and fo through th(\nwhole\n\f[ 59 ]\nwhole : the ufc of which is, that if on the Cufp\nof the lOth Houfe you find the fign Aries, then\non the Cufp of the 4th you mufi: place the fign\nLibra; and whatever degree of Aries pofl'effes the\nCufp of the loth Houfe, the fame degree mufi: be\nplaced on the 4th. For example: In the prefent\nfigure we have placed 2 degrees of SI on the Cufp\nof the loth Houfe ;\nnov\/ being oppofite to Leo,\nand the 4th Houfe to the loth, we therefore place\n2 degrees of on the Cufp of the 4th Houfe\n:\nupon the Cufp of the nth nji is already placed;\nand the 5th Houfe being oppofite to the I ith, and\nuji oppofite to K , I place 6 degrees of X on the\nCufp of the 5th Hpufe : the Cufp of the 6th Houfe\nbeing vacant, I place.\n3 degrees of fy, the 6th be-\ning facing the 12th, upon the Cufp of the- id\nHoufe orAfcendant. There are 24degrees of Libra\n;\nand the yth Houfe being oppofite to the ift, and\nthe fign =2: to T, I therefore again place on the\nCufp of the 1 2th Hoiife, with 24 degrees on the\nline of it; fo that there is ty on the Cufp of the\n5th and 6th Houfes, which denotes that there is a\nfign intercepted, which I place in the 3d and 9th\nHoufes, viz. 25 and Pf. Upon the Cufp of the\n8th Houfe I place 21 deg. b j\nbecaufe the 8th is\noppofite to the 2d 1 then refer to the 3d Houfe,\nwhich is : oppofite to the 9th n 24, I place\n24 degrees upon the Cufp of the 9th Houfe; and\nK 2 thus\n\f[ 100 ]\nthus the 12 Houfes are completely furnlflied with\nthe 12 Signs of the Zodiac, and the degrees afcend-\ning at the precife time of ereding the figure.\nXhis rule mull ever he obferved ftriclly, as it is\nuniverfal, and always holds true.\nHaving To far fucceeded, the next thing is to\nplace the Sun, Moon, and Planets, in the figure,\naccording to their pofition at that time in the\nHeavens; and this is alfo to be done by the help\nof the left-hand page of Partridge\u2019s Ephemeris,\nwhich may be had in Pater-nofter-Row, or at Sta-\ntioners-Hall, printed for the Company of Sta-\ntioners.

As the Part of Portune is of the ut-\nmoft confequence where property is concerned,,\ntherefore we fliall be the more particular, efpeci-\nally as there is no book extant but what is ambi-\nguous on this head*. The Part of Fortune 0 is.\ntaken either by day or night, by fubtradling the*\nplace of the Sun from the place of the Moon ini\nfigns and degrees, remembering to add 12 figns tO)\nthe Moon s place if lubtra\u00a3lion cannot be made:\nwithout,,\nNor any modern Bosk of this Science but what Is exceedingly\/\n\u2022\u00ab0D\u00ab0U$ JU tbtit TabUs, which ought to be the moft ascuratc.\n\f[ 103 ]\nwitho\u00ab^, and to the remainder add the fign and?\ndegree of the Afcendant ;\nwhich will give tho\nexacfi place of the Part of Fortune 0.\nFor example: fuppofe we are required\nto find the Part of Fortune for the fol-\nlowing figure, eredled for Aug. 20, 1785 :\nI fip-d the place of Luna 5 to be in A-\nquarius 28 deg. which you muft reckon\nas in the margin, counting from begin-\nning of Aries to the beginning of b one\nv\/hole fign, &c.

[Ob-\nferve this proof, That fo far as Sol is diftant from\nLuna, fo far is the Part of Tcriune diftant frona\nthe Afcendant; fo that if you take it upon a new\nMoon, the Part of Fortune is in the Afcendant\nupon the firft quarter in the 4th Houfe, upon a\nfull Moon in the 7th Houfe, upon the laft quarter\nin the icth Houfe.]\nA Celcjlial Figure^ ereSied 1 Minutes paji lO in-\nthe Morrduig.\n\f[ 105 ]\nThis figure includes all that is required for the\npurpofe of judging horary queftions ; and thus^\nby proper attention and diligence,, may any perfon\nof ordinary talents eredl the Horolcope, and in-\ntroduce the planets.

To avoid which, let the\nfollowing Qiteries be attended to.\nThe confideration of the matter propofed is\ntaken from that houfe which has relation to and\nSignification of the fame; and this fignification is\neither fmple or compound. Thefimple fignification\nof the houfes is that which hath relation fingly to\nthe perfon of the querent. Compound fignification\nis that which hath relation to the matter, or que-\nfited. The ^icrent is he or fhe that afks the\n\u2022queftion. The matter, or quefited, is that about\nwhich the queftion is propofed. The fimple fio--\ntiification of the houfes is as follows The ift\nhoufe fignifies the querent\u2019s life and perfon; the\n2d houfe his fubftance ; the 3d his kindred, neigh-\n\u2022bours, and fhort journies ; the 4th his grave, fa-\nther, and lands; the 5th his plcafures and ofF-\nfpring; the 6th his ficknefs, Servants, and fmall\ncattle ;\nthe 7th his wife, public enemies, and law-\nfuits; the 8th his death and legacies; the 9th his\nreligion, long voyages, and learning; the loth\nhis mother, trade, and honour; the l ith his friends\n\u2022and hopes; the 12th bis private enemies, great\ncattle, imprifonment, and croiTes. The compound\nfignification is derived from the fmple^ by con\u2014\nfidering what houfe, that is, which fimiifies the\nI\nO\nmatter\n\f[ io8 ]\nmatter or quefited, and accounting that, be It\nwhatfoever it may, the ift houfe or Afcendant;\nand fo afcribing the ilgnlficatlon of the ift hoiilb\nof the figure to It ;\ndoing in like manner to all '\nthe other houfes in order : fo that, if a queftion\nrelate to a brother or relation, the ^d houfe is then I\nhis Afcendant or ill houfe, and fignifies his rifc:j\nand perfon ;\nthe 4th houfe (which in this cafe is.\nhis 2d) his fubllance or eflate ; the 5th houfe hisij\n3d, his relations and fhort journies ; the 6th his.\n4th houfe, his father; the 7th, his children; the-\n8th, his ficknefs ; the 9th, his wife, &c. and thc:j\nfame of all others. Thefe things being laid as ai|\nfoundation, we come now to fhew the perfe\u00a3lioni\nof the matter by the different affedlions of the*\nAfpefts.\n^^ERY I. Js the fubjeSt of enquiry Xo be qv'\nNot to be ?\nThe firft thing to be attended to, is the deftruc-\ntion orperfeftion of every matter under confidera\u2014\ntion. The completion or perfeaion of the fubjeft'\nof enquiry may be affefted feveral ways, viz. by\nthe application^ iranjlation^ reception^ and pejition^.\nof the planets; and thclc are determined by the\nrefpeaive fignificators of the fubjea of enquiry;;\nwhich aie, ill, the Lords of thole Houfes w'hich\nrclatci\n\f[ 1C9 ]\nrelate to the matter In hand ; adly, planets near\nthe culps of thofe houfes ;\n3dly, planets exalted\nor dignified therein ;\nand, 4thly, the confignifi-\ncators of thofe houfes ;\nwhich we have deferibed\nbefore, in the fignificators of the Twelve Houfes.\n'I'he Lords of the Houfes are thofe planets which\nare Lords of the figns that happen to fall on the\ncufps of the houfes, as fhewn before, and may be\nfeen in the Table of the Planets Houfes. From\nhence it appears, that each houfe has a primary\nand fecondary confignificator ;\nthe firft whereof\narifes from the order of the planets, the other\n'from the order of the figns; as the ill houfe or\nafeendant, Saturn and Mars; that is, Saturn and\nAries; and fo on, &c.\n'\nThe Afeendant, his Lord, and the Moon, arc\nto fignify the querent ;\nand that houfe and his\nlord to which ihe queftion belongs, to fignify the\nquefired : then confider what application is be-\ntween the ftgnijicators\n:\nif they apply to a con-\njunflion, in angles, fwift in motion in any of\ntheir cflential dignities, it fhews the matter en-\nquired after will be brought to perfedion fpeedily ;\nif in fuccedent houfes, not fo foon ;\nif in cadent\nhoufes, with much lofs of time.\nWhen the fignificators apply by fextile or trine,\nfrom good houfes, and they in any of their efi'en-\nL tial\n\f[\nno j\ntial dignities, and free from the evil rays of thes\nInfortunes, it is an argument the matter will fooni\nbe completed. If the lignificators apply by ai\nquartile afpeft, in good houfes, and they be ini\ntheir eflential dignities, it fhews the thingenquired\nafter will be brought to perfeftion, although not.\nlb feafily, nor io fuccefsfully. Things arc brought\nto perfebtion fometimes when the lignificators arc\nin oppefttion^ but this happens when the figmfica-\ntors are in mutual reception by houfes ;\nbut if it is\ncompleted, it is with much trouble and anxiety,\nand the querent will be forry he fought after it.\nMatters are brought to perfeSlion by iravjlation of\nlight and virtue, when the lignificators do not be-\nhold each other, but fome lighter planet feparateth\nhimfelf from the one fignificator which he was in\nmutual reception with, and then applies to the other\nfignificator before he comes to the body or afpe\u00a3t\nof another planet ;\nand you may judge the thing\nenquired after will be brought to perfe\u00a3lion by\nfuch a planet as that planet fignifies which thus\ntranllates the light and virtue of one fignificator\nto the other.\nThe fubjeft of enquiry may be brought to per-\nfection by pofition ;\nthat is, when the fignificator\nof the thing is pofited in tlrc Afcendant, or if the\nI.ord of the Afcendant be pofited in the houfe of\nthe quefited ; but this fingle tellimony fcldom per-\nfects\n\f[ 111 ]\nfefts the bufinefs, without feme of the aforefaid\narguments happen, or the two figniiicators caft\ntheir leveral alpefts to feme more weighty planet\nthan themfelves, whom they are both in recep-\ntion with, and then the perfon fignified by that\nplanet who colkas boih their lights may bring '\nit to perfeaion.\nQuer-Y 2. Whaf\/hall le the deJlrnSlion cr hituli wtce\nof a matter enquired after ?\nThe thing enquired after is deftroyed by Pro^\nhibition, Fruftration, Refranation, Afped, Sepa-\nration, Tranflation, and Combnflion ;\nfor which\npleafe to refer to the Technical terms ufecl in Ai-\ntrology, where a full definition is given of them.\nAny of thefe are fufiicient to deftroy the matter,\nmore efpecially if fome or all of thele fignificators\nhappen to be in fixed figns, and in a cadent or\nfuccedent houfe.\nFor inflance ;\nwhen you find the {igni^?ators\napplying to conjunflion or alpeiSf, and before\nthey come to their partile afpedf fome other planet\ncomes to the conjunftion or afpe\u00a3t of one of the\nfignificators, and that planet hinders the thing\nfrom being brought to perfeftion ;\nconfider the\nnature of that planet ;\nallb what houfe he is lord\nof ; from hence you may know what perfon will\nL 2 be\n\f[ 112 ]\nbe the hiiidrancc. If it be the Lord of the third,\nit flicws feme neighbour, brother, &c. if it be\nthe Lord of the 4th, the querent\u2019i father, 8cc. will\nbe the hindrance, or iinpediting planet.

I\nThe diftance is difeovered from the proximity\nof the fignificators to body or afpedf, confidered\nas they may happen to be either angular^ fucceder.ty I\nor cadent \\\nrefpeCl being had to their iaiitudc,\nwhether little or great, North or South. Great\nlatitude fhews obfeurity and great difficulty in I\nfinding what is fought for; if North latitude,\ndifficulty only, not impoffibility; but if South,\nthen all the labour c.f fecking is in vain, unlefs the\nfignificators be angular, and near in afped. Angles\n|\nfignify nearneis ; farther off; cadents^\nbeyond all imagination. The fignificator\nand without latitude, fhews fome paces ; if North\nlatitude, fome furlongs ; if South, fome miles di-\nfiant. The fignificator yzra^r\/tw\/, and without lati-\ntude, fhews fome furlongs ; if it hath North lati-\ntude, fome miles ; if South, fome leagues. If\nsadent^ and without latitude, fhews fome miles j\nNorth latitude, fome leagues; South, fome de-\n\\\ngrees.\n\f[ II5 3\ngrees. Thefe rules are to be confidered chiefly in\nthings that have life. If it be required to know\nthe true number of paces, furlongs, miles, leagues,\nor degrees diftance, confider the number of degrees\nand minutes between the body or afpe6l of the\nfignificator ;\nand according to the number of de-\ngrees which are between the conjundion, fextile,\nquartile, trine, or oppolition, fo many paces, fur-\nlongs, miles, leagues, or degrees, is the thing\nfought after diftant from the place from whence\nit was loft, or from the perfon making enquiry\n;\nand fo many minutes as adhere to the degrees, fo\nmany both parts of the fame denomination of the\nmeafurc which one degree fignifieth is to be ac-\ncounted and added to the former number.\nQuery 6. When or in tvhat time ?\nThe limitation of time is taken either by houfe\nor fign, or by afpebl. If the fignificator hath la-\ntitude, the meafure of time hath its limitation\nfrom houfe and fign. Whether things are to be\nbrought to pafs or deftroyed, the time, if it be\nfignified by houfe and fign, muft be confidered,\nas the fignificator is angular, fuccedent, or cadent\nhaving moveable, Jixed^ or common figns. Angles\nftgnify fuddenly j\nfuccedents, long time, and with\nmuch difficulty ;\ncadents, fcarcely at all, or with\nvexation. Angles fignify, if they have moveable\n\fI\n[ ]\nfigns, fome days ;\nif common figns, fome weeks\nand if fixed figns, fome months. Succedent fig-\nnify, if moveable, fome months ;\ncommon figns,\nfome years ;\nand if fixed figns, when all hopes are '\npafi, if at all. If you defire to know the number\nof days, weeks, months, or years, ccnfider the\ndegrees and minutes between the body or afpetfl of\nthe fignificator j\nand according to the number of\ndecrees which are between their conjundlion, fex-\ntile, quartile, trine, oroppofitien, fo many days,\nweeks, months, or years, fhall it be before the\nmatter is accompliflied or deftroyed. Great S. la-\ntitude often prolongs the time; N. latitude often\ncuts it off fhorter ;\nbut if the fignificators have\nno latitude, the exaft time is made fimply by the\nafpedls. The time fignificators meet is found out.\nin the Ephemeris.\nQuery 7.

If you find the Lord of the Houfe and\nLord of the Afcendant of one and the fame Tri-\nplicity, or when the Lord of the hour and the\nlign afeending fliall be of one triplicity, thequef-\ntion is then radical, and fit to be judged.\nIf the fign afeending and the planet in the\nafcendant deferibe the perfon of the querent, the\nqueftion is radical, and fit to be judged; but if\neither the very beginning or extreme end only of\na fign afeend, it will not be proper to give judge-\nment ;\nit denotes the queftion has been propofed\nmerely out of ridicule. This rule I have often\nverified in practice. The fame thing is indicated\nby the quartile or oppofition of the Aloon with\nthe Lord of the yth, or by the Moon being void\nof courfe, or combuft ; which pofition denotes\nthe queftion improperly ftated. Saturn In the\nAfcendant,\n\f[ uS ]\nAfcendant, impedited or affll(5led, fliews the que-\nftion propofed either falfc, or the fu bjecl part hope;\nand whenever the Lord of the Afcendant is com-\nbuft, or retrograde, it implies the fame tiling.\nThe Artill muft always judge by the greater tefti-\nmonies ;\nbut if the fignificators are found equally\nffrong for and againft the matter, it is better to\ndefer judgement to a future time.\nIt is an aftonilhing faft, that moles^ or marhs^\nare all diflinguiiOied by the figns and planets which\nprevail at the time of birth, notwithftanding all\nendeavours to refute the idea of planetary influence.\nThis truth is annually recorded in every almanack.\nObferve what fign is upon the Cufp of the\nAfcendant, when you have erected your figure ;\nand in that part of the body the fign governs, the\nquerent will have a mole, if the quefiion be radi-\ncal. For inftance ; if Aries afeend, the mole will\nbe on the head or face ; if Taurus, on the neck\nand throat, &c. and fo upon any other part of the\nbody the fign afeending governs.

Next,\nobferve the fign defeending on the Cufp of the 6th\nHoufe,\n\f[ II9 ]\nHoufe, and in wliateyer part of the body that figti\ngoverns the querent will find another mole. Allb,\nby the Lord of the 6th, in what houfe he is in,\nas before, obferve what fign the Moon is in ;\nand\nthe querent will find another mole, as aforefaid.\nIf the planet Saturn be fignificator of the mole,\nit is black or dark colour ;\nif Mars, and in a fiery\nlign, it refembles a cut, fear, or dent, in the flefli;\nbut in any other fign, a red mole. If Jupiter, the\nmole is purple or blue ; if the Sun, olive or chef-\nnut; if Venus, yellow; if Mercury, pale lead\ncolour; if the Moon, a whitifli colour : but here-\nin you are to mix her figniflcation according to\nthe planet Ibe is in afpeft with. The fignificators\nmafculine, or in mafeuline figns, fignify the mark\n\u2022or mole on the right fide of the body ; if feminine,\non the left. If the fignificator of the mole be\nabove the horizon, the mole, &c, is vifible to the\neye, and on the fore part of the body ;\nbut if un-\nder the earth, then on the back part of the body.\nAs thefe Rules will hold good upon the body of\nthe querent, fo will they agree upon the body of\nthe quefited.

The\nLord of the Afcendant in the Afcendant, or iov-'\ntunate planets in yi-Art\/yi? ov trine to tht J\/cendani,\nhis Lord, or the Moon, is an argument that your\nquerent is of a long life ; but if you find the\nMoon, or Lord of the Afcendant, peregrine or\ncombuft in the 8th, or the Lord of the 8th unfor-\ntunate in the Afcendant, or in quartile or oppo-\nfuion to the Moon, or Lord of the Afcendant, it\nis a very great indicatioii of a fliort life to the\nquerent.\nIf you find the Dragon\u2019s-tail, Saturn, or Mars,\nin the Afcendant, or with the Moon, or Lord of\nthe Afcendant, peregrine or retrograde, and be\nLord of the 6th or 8th houfes, or having dignities\ntherein, you may judge the querent\u2019s life to he\n(hort, or that fome ficknefs or misfortune is ap-\nproaching.\nM 2.7\/\n\f[\n122 1\n2.

If it be a brother, the 3d Houfe\nand its Lord ;\nand if the party enquired after be\nno relation, take the Afccndant, his Lord, and the\nJ\\'Ioon, to be the fignificator of the abfent party.\nIf the Lord of the ,\nAfccndant, or Luna, be in\nconjundlion with the Lord of the 8th, and no\ngood configurations of the benevolent planets, the\nabfent party is certainly dead.\nOr when tbe Moon and Lord of the Afcendant\nare in oppofition to the Lord of the 8th, from the\n2d or 8th houfes, or from the 6th or 12th houfes,\nthe abfent party is dead. If the Lord of the A-\nfeendant be in the 4th, and the Moon in the yth,\nin quartile to hinr, it fnews great danger, if not:\nabfolnte death. When an evil planetfhall tranflate?\nthe light of the Lord of the 8th unto the Lord of\nthe Afcendant, or of the Lord of the Afcendant:\n\u00abo the Lord of the 8th, it is moft probable the ab--\ntent perfon is dead.

When a good planet is in the Afcendant,\nand the Lord of the ift beholds the ciifp of the\n3d, or applies friendly to the Lord of the 3d; it is\nan argument of a good difpobtion in the cjuerent,\nand indicates he is defirous of agreeing with his\nbrothers, neighbours, kc. and if a Fortune be in\nthe 3d, and the Lord of the 3d apply in harmony\nto the Lord of the ift, the brothers, &c. are moft\nindulging. Thofe perfons whofe fignificators do not\napply, are moft imperious, and apt to difagree ; and\nthofe perfons whofe fignificators make application,\nare flexible, willing and defirous of peace and\nconcord. When Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon\u2019s-\ntail, in fuch a queftion, (hall be in the Afcendant,\nit denotes the enquirer to be obftinate, and averfe\nto a friendly agreement; but if any of them are\npofited in the 3d, the brothers, &c. are of a ma-\nlicious difpofition : and if it happens that Saturn,\nor Mars are peregrine, retrograde, or combuft,\nthe malice or mifehief they threaten will be the\nmore hurtful. When Saturn or Dragon s-tail are\nin the 3d, the neighbours are clownifti, obftinate,\nand the kindred covetous and fparing: if Mars,\nthe kindred are treacherous, and <he neighbours\ndlfhoneft: and this is certain when they are out\nof their dignities.\n2.

Know-\ning the queftion tq be perfedfly radical, I credfed\nthe following figure, and gave him my opinion\njudicially. This queftion properly belongs to the\n8th Houfe.\nMercury\n\fC 173 ] .\n\u2022\nMercury is Lord of the Afcendant, and fignifi-\ncator of tlie querent ; he is fituated in the 7th\nHoufe, and difpofes of Jupiter, the ftgnificator of\nhis wife, who is pofited in the 4th, his own Houfe,\nftrong, and in trine afpeA to the Sun : the Dra-\ngon\u2019s-head, or Moon\u2019s fortunate node, falls in his\nwife s 2d ; all which ftrongly predict the querent\u2019s\nwife would not lofe her inheritance. 7'his telli-\nmony is corroborated by the pofition of Jupiter,\nwho is Lord of Pifees, or his wife\u2019s Houfe, and\nalfo his wife\u2019s lOth fignificator of the mother, viz.\nthe 4th Houfe in the figure, and loth from the\n7th. This indicated much love between mother\nand daughter.
