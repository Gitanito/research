Editor: Prof. Allen Haddock, Phrenologist, editor and proprietor; C.P. Holt, associate editor; Edwin S. Fyfe.\r\n 1\/1, 1890-1906(?)  8-16 pp.  Illustrated.  Fifty cents a year.\n\n  Professor Haddock also offered phrenological examinations: oral ($1.00), \"recorded on chart\" ($2.00), and \"recorded with typewritten analysis\" ($5.00).  Noted in \"List of Advance Thought Publications,\" The New Cycle, March 1900, 159-60, and advertised in The Oracle, April 1900.  The Occult and Biological Journal, 1902, describes it as a \"monthly magazine, now in its eleventh year of publication.  It treats of Phrenology, Physiognomy, Psychology, Health, Sociology, and all subjects which pertain to the welfare of humanity.\"  The advertisement in Coming Light, January 1899, says that the journal was \"earnest in its advocacy of human liberty and abreast of the age in progressive thought.\"  The journal's own proclamation in its first issue promised::  \" Our columns will be devoted to the unfoldment of man's inner nature, as revealed by his head, face and body; in his form and features, color, texture and quality of organization and temperament. We shall embrace the entire study of man, for that is the full meaning of the word Phrenology, as the science is not confined to the head, or to \"bumps,\" as some suppose. We shall endeavor to explain why men are thus and so, and hope to prove by actual demonstration why this one is so kind and liberal, why another is so unkind and selfish, why one is so open, candid and honest, another mysterious and cunning, why one is weak, vain and foolish, another so strong, sensible and wise. Why some boys, girls, men and women are better adapted for one calling in life, others to different occupations altogether; why this one succeeds, why that one fails in his attempt to reach the goal of his ambition. We shall strive to inculcate a spirit of purity and love of home in our readers Our sole object is not dollars, although we do hope our work will be deemed worthy of financial support, and thus enable us to carry on the journal, with the motto: \u2018upward and onward' toward moral and intellectual improvement.\"  The principals also ran the Haddock & Holt Institute in San Francisco that bestowed degrees on those worthy to receive them: V.G. Rocine boasted of a Ph.D. in Mental Science from the school.
