If fuc-\ncefsful in bufinefs they appear as gentlemen, and\nRet acquainted with the hoftlers on the road, and\nfome landlords, to obtain intelligence.

For thefe reafons\ngentlemen are pnrfued on the road, though,\nare met by chauce. Highwaymen generally\nyou before they falute; but I advife ail gent!\ntravellers not to divulge what fubftance they\nwith them to any landlord or hoftler, efpe\nwithin forty milis of London? as they gen\ndifeover all the information they can get, <\nthrough ignorance or defign.\nS H A R P E R S .\nT H E SE are the more delufive, as molt of\nare men of reputable extra&ion, tole\neducation, and decent appearance; but thr\n. vicious purfuits have fquandered their for\nand loft their reputation.

So fallacious are\nthey, they will, even under the maik of friend-\nfhip, draw an unguarded, generous man into the\nmoft deftruftive meafures, and (hare vith their\nbale confederates the produtt of their treachery.\nIf'you hazard your money in betts with a (harper,\nas cheating is bis infeparable qualification, you\nhave not only blind chance to deal with, but fuch\nacombination of deceit, and fuch a train of tricks\nand flights linked together, that even good fortune\nisnot fufficient to guard and fecure you againft\nthem. Nay, if you could arife to a degree of\neminence in any particular game, he would even\nthen devile means, either by working up your\npaffion, or eluding your infpe&ion, to fruftratc\nyonr point and carry bis own.\nHe will inveigle you, from time to time, into\npnefport or another, amongft others of his dan,\nvho are adepts in diffimulation, till they have\ngenteelly fleeced you of perhaps your all, and treat\nyou afterwards with as much indifference, as he\nat firft affe&ed refpett. When you can no longer\nadminifter to bis iniquitous purpofes, he will not\nPnly defert you, but make a feoff of your inex\u00ad\nperience and credulity.

If you are accoiled in the ftreet, parks\nany place of public refort in the ordinary w*jr\nconverfe, concerning the topic of the time, or\u00ab\nincidental fuhje&s, affeft cither not to heart\nturn afide.

They haunt night-houfes, petty ale-n\u00f4t\nand the fkirts of the toivn.

Thus the poor,\nharmlefs honeft man is trepanned either Into a\nftate of flavery (for in many cafes it is no better)\nor obliged to purchafe his deliverance at an ex\u00ad\ntortionate rate.

But what I have urged concerning the\ngames of Tennis and Bowls, I mean not to dif-\niuadc any perfon from the practice of them, as\nthey are both of them manly and innocent amufe~\nments of themfelves; but to caution the unwary\n(iony the fnajes of gamblers, who proftitule tliem\nto their fraudulent purpofes, by picking the poc\u00ad\nkets of the honeft, but unguarded country gen\u00ad\ntlemen.\nTo avoid thefe, never vifit a Tennis Court or\nBowLng Green, without ftricfl enquiry into the\nCompany, who ordinarily frequent them; and then\nit wou> .i be beft to take a friend with you, who is\naccuftomei to the ways of the town.\nCOCK FIGHTING, though an ancient cuftom,\nand pradlifed c-v the nobility and gentry of this\nkingdom, is a ic-nd-dqus and barbarous diverlion,\nand rehe<5to a difgt-ce on human nature; permit\nme, thereroie, to ddfiiade my readers in general\nfrom even appearing in fuch icenes of cruelty,\nwhich . re e'er pi \u00bfhied to moft notations villain\u00ad\nies, and \\viiic.i are lit for the attendance of Gafli-\nMen a-one.\n( *3 )\n\fHORSE-RACING may at firft view be fop*\n-nofed within the compafe o\u00a3 the country-naan's\nKnowledge, but I apprehend I can difcover many\ntricks in that diverfion, to which the greater part\nare utter grangers. jU is pertain, thefe are all\nfrequented by a number of London Gamblers,\nwho take the rout from one courfe to another\nthroughout the kingdom; and have iludied the\nvarious means of fraud in this branch of fport, as\na tradcfman does his art of profellion c It is often\nin thefe matches pre-concerted who is to be the\n.winner, by which means thoufands are taken in.\nGamblers getting together, pretend to make a\ngreat buftle, and to be very ianguine for this or\nthe other horfe, by which means byrftepder$ ate\noften induced to bet and lofe their money, as they\n1cnow the winner before they come into the .courfe.\n{Sometimes at a fair match, when judgment can\nonly decide the wagers, o.ne of the .clan having\nmade a bet, another fleps up, and the money fry\ncontent of parties is depofited in his hands, if\nthe match goes in favour of the fair fportfman,\n\u00bfway pikes the kiddy with the money. The ftran-\nger flares, the gambler fwears, but all to no pur-\npofe; the former mull put up with the lofs, and\nthe latter flinks off with a hypocritical concern for\nbeing acceflary to the money\u2019s being depofited in\nflie hands of a rogue; having taken down the re\u00ad\nsidence of the deluded men, and promifed, on\ndete&ion of the bilk, to give him immediate no\u00ad\ntice. To infure yourfejf from this kind of cheat,\nit is bcft not make any kind of bets; or only tri\u00ad\nfling ones with thofe of your acquaintance.\nBILLIARDS is a genteel ingenious game, and\nrequires much dexterity and *\n, \\j\\ax\n( \u00bb4 )\n\ftthers is perverted with gamblers. 1 venture t#\niffirm, there are more idle fellows live by this\nkind of diverfion in London, than by any other,\nand the reafon is evident; becaufe it is more prac\u00ad\nticed. Thefe by hovering over tables from morn\u00ad\ning to night, acquire in time a tolerable proficien\u00ad\ncy in the game; as well as a knowledge of the\nvarious frauds pra&ifed in it. When a ftranger\nenters the room, they all, tb ufe their own phnde,\nAagbim, and can foon, if he fpeaks concerning\nthe fubjedt, difcem if he is a pigeon. By a pigeon*\nI mean a perfon, who is either a novice at the\ngame, or an obftinate conceited fool, who will\nplay with a fuperior to gratify his own vanity. If\nthey cannot by propofing great odds get the no\u00ad\nvice to play, they will draw him on to bet, and\nasat Tennis, let him win three or four times, till\nat length the tables turn upon, him, and he is de\u00ad\ncently fleeced of his cafh. The obftinate, vain\nman, generally ferves their turn better than even\nthe novice. He thinks, becaufe he has been\ndeemed ah adept, at a table reforted to by gentle\u00ad\nmen and tradefmen for their diverfion only, he it\na match for any player, and therefore to ipread\nhis fame, vifits different tables. But fuch a one\ncaunot but be a dupe to his own vanity, and a\npigeon to the Gambler; becaufe the (kill of the\nformer is only the refult of playing occafionally\nfor his amufement, while that of the latter is the\neffedt of daily pradtice and itudy as his foie liveli\u00ad\nhood. The country gentleman, when in town,\nmay avoid the fnares of Gamblers at the game of\nBilliards, by declining all bets, andaU ^asj viltk\nhangers.\n( *5 )\n\u00bb\nV\n\f( .\u00ab )\nftA\u00ed\u00dcNG HOUSES: Befide* the varloiis fpor\n\u00cd\nirbftituted to the fraudulent purpofes o\u00ed tins i\nambus clan, there are hoiifes \u00a1u th.s \u00a1own :\napart for that vile ufe.

I ihall therefore\nwave thofe already mentioned, and offer him a\nfew admonitions, whfch I hope will aeitber .be op-\nacceptable or unprofitable.

Add to this,\nthat all the pleafures of the town may be run\nthrough in the narrow fpace of two or three days;\nwhich done, you do but traverfe the fame fooliih\nroad, and tread the lame ilage over and over\nagain,\u2019 and what can be more ungrateful to ah in\u00ad\ngenious, enquiring mind, than the dull repetition\nof the fame fcenes.
