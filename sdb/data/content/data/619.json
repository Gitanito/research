Matthews, D.D., Dean of St. Paul\u2019s\nThe subject which I propose to discuss in this lecture is a large one\nand I must apologise at the beginning for the superficiality of what\nI have to say on many topics which need prolonged and profound\ndiscussion. My excuse is that I believe it may be useful to take a\nrapid survey of a territory which has been but little explored and\ntry to gain some conception of the work which needs to be done.\nOne limitation I must insist upon in order to avoid misunder-\nstanding. My title is \u201c Psychical Research and Theology \u201d\u2014not\nReligion. Though it is impossible to draw a clear line of distinction\nbetween religion and theology, or indeed between theory and\npractice in general, in a rough way we can distinguish the experience\nof religion from the intellectual activity of the formulation of\nreligious doctrines and concepts. In this lecture I shall have\nnothing to say, either in criticism or approval, of Spiritualism in so\nfar as that is a religion and I shall confine myself to Christian\ntheology, partly because it is the only one about which I am com-\npetent to speak and partly because it is the only one with which\npsychical research in this country comes into contact.\nThe attitude of the Christian Church to psychical research in the\npast has been, on the whole, one of antagonism, or at least of\nsuspicion. This has not been, in the main, due to scepticism con-\ncerning the phenomena which are the subject-matter of the enquiry,\n^ This lecture, being the Sixth Myers Memorial Lecture, was delivered at\na General Meeting of the Society on 17 January 1940.\nA 1\n\fo W. R. MaUhews, D.D. [PAKT\nbut rather to a conviction that they were real and that they came\nfrom a source only too well known. Though at least one of the\nHebrew prophets regarded the idols of the heathen as simply\nillusions and some of the Christian Fathers held the same view, the\ngeneral opinion has been that abnormal and supernatural pheno-\nmena could be produced by evil spirits and that the pagan altars\nwere erected to devils not too deeply disguised. Only in the eigh-\nteenth and nineteenth centuries did any considerable number of\nChristians adopt a sceptical position with regard to the possibility\nof witchcraft and commerce with the devil.\nIn recent times the reluctance of Christians to see any good in\npsychical research has, I suppose, arisen from two different causes.\nOn the one hand, there remained the traditional feeling that such\ninvestigations were dangerous and partook of the nature of com-\nmunicating with \u201c familiar spirits \u201d ;\non the other hand, there was\nthe attitude of disdain commonly adopted by the scientific world\ntowards psychical research. The two orthodoxies, religious and\nscientific, so different in other respects, concurred in regarding\npsychical research as disreputable. It would, of course, be both\ninaccurate and ungrateful to forget that this general attitude of\nsuspicion has had notable exceptions. Christian divines have con-\ntributed to the study of paranormal phenomena and that eminent\nVictorian ecclesiastic. Bishop Boyd Carpenter, held the presidency\nof our Society. In very recent years a notal)le change may be\nobserved. The spread of interest in the subject, sometimes in\nquestionable forms, led the Archbishops to appoint a Commission\nto consider the question of the relation of psychical research and of\nspiritualism to the Christian faith. This Commission reported some\ntime ago and the delay in the publication of its findings suggests\nthat they may have found their final resting place in the archiepis-\ncopal pigeon holes, if not in the archiepiscopal mind. In these cir-\ncumstances I feel myself at liberty to disclose only two facts about\nthe work of that Commission. No one will be surprised to hear that\nstrong difference of opinion was manifested in the Commission.\nThat might have been predicted. What was perhaps miexpected\nby many members of the Commission was the evidence that a\nnumber of people had found in psychical research a confirmation\nof their Christian faith and even a way from agnosticism to belief.\nThis has received a very limited support from Professor Broad who,\nin a recent essay on the future of Christianity, mainly pessimistic\nin tone, expresses surprise that theologians do not pay more atten-\ntion to the implications of the results of ]jsychical research. In\nattempting to contribute something to this enterprise I feel that I\n\f161 ]\nPsychical Research and Theology 3\nshall be acting in the spirit of the great man whose name this lecture\ncommemorates, for Frederic Myers never concealed the fact that he\nhoped to gain from psychical research new light on the mystery of\nman\u2019s life and destiny.\nThe area in which there seems to be some contact between\ntheology and psychical research is far wider than the one question\nwhich occupies the horizon of many\u2014that of survival of bodily\ndeath. The problem of survival is, in some respects, the most im-\nportant and the most controversial and I propose to leave it to the\nend, first making some remarks upon some topics which are, from\nthe theological point of view, prior to that of personal immortality.\nThe scope of theology in modern times is larger than is suspected\nby those who have not studied the subject. The growth of scientific\nknowledge has presented it with new problems and new tasks.\nAmong these is that of the nature and development of religion in\ngeneral. For theologians of an earlier time these problems scarcely\nexisted, or, if they were admitted at all, seemed capable of finding\na summary solution. The development of the study of Anthropology\nand Comparative Keligions has changed the situation profoundly.\nThere are still Christian theologians who think it not only possible\nbut essential to treat Christianity as a revelation so distinctive and\nunique that it has no significant relations with other religions, and\nof late, under the influence of Karl Barth, they have become both\nnumerous and influential ;\nbut, on the whole, it remains true that\nthe modern theologian, while holding that in Christianity is con-\ntained a miique revelation, recognises that it has a place in the\ngeneral development of the religious experience and of religious\nideas.\nA great deal of importance has been attached to the definition of\nreligion and the fact that among the hundred or more suggested\ndefinitions not one has secured general acceptance does not indicate\nthat the whole discussion has been futile. There would be no great\nvalue in possessing a logical definition of religion ;\na formula which\nwould cover the beliefs and experience of all religious persons from\nthe fetish worshipper to the philosopher-saint would tell us little\nabout the significance of religion. The real interest in the discussion\nis the enquiry into the nature and significance of religion as an\naspect of the continuing and developing life of humanity, to decide\nhow it can be distinguished from magic and, at a later stage of its\nevolution, how it differs from and how it is related to other modes of\nspiritual activity, such as morafity and art.\nIn my opinion this question of the nature of religion and its\nstatus as a \u201c moment \u201d in the fife of spirit cannot be decided by any\n\f4 W. E. Matthews, D.D. [part\nempirical method, but is one of the central problems of metaphysics. 1\nNevertheless, within limits, assistance has been gained from psy- I\nchology\u2014though not I think so much assistance as some psycholo- |\ngists would allege. It is difficult to say whether psychical research\ncan help us much in this department of theology, but there is one\nspecial aspect of the general problem of the nature of religion where\nit is conceivable some important contribution might come from\nresearches such as this Society is concerned with. It has been held\nby some distinguished writers that mysticism is the essence of I\nreligion or, alternatively, that in the mystical experience we have\nreligion in its most concentrated form. Others have held, on the\ncontrary, that mysticism is a form of religious experience which is\ndoubtfully Christian and certainly not the highest. It is a well-\nknown fact that some of the physical phenomena related on good\nauthority as happening in connection with saints of the mystical\ntype have also occurred in connection wdth mediums\u2014this at least\nis alleged on equally good authority. The most notable example is\nlevitation. This obviously suggests some relation between the\nmystical and the mediumistic trance. But this remark does not take\nus very far, for clearly the two types of experience might have this\ncharacteristic in common and yet be, in all important respects, quite\ndifferent. It appears to me that many writers on religion assume\ntoo readily that mysticism, as such, is good and that, when once we\nhave described a man as a mystic, we are absolved from the duty\nenjoined on us by the Apostle to \u201c try the spirits whether they be\nof God.\u201d I am inclined to think that there are mystical states which\nare morally and spiritually either indifferent or evil. There are\npersons who have what we can only call \u201c spiritual power \u201d, who |\nare apparently in contact with some source of energy which rein-\nforces their natural endowments and gives them a unification of\npurpose which makes them most formidable, but these persons are\noften evil and their mystical experience is a heightening of their will\nand their capacity for destruction. In other words, I believe that\nthere is meaning in the word \u201c demonic \u201d. We should not have to\nlook very far for an example of a mystic of this type or for the\nevidence of his power for evil. It occurs to me that some light on\nthis question might be gained by a study of the effect of mediumship\non the personality and character of the medium. Probably some-\nthing has already been done on these lines, but if so I am not\nacquainted with it and there are obvious reasons why a publication\nof results would be difficult. I should expect to find that, in cases\nwhere there was already a formed character, that character would\nbe enhanced by the mediumistic experience.\n\f161 ]\nPsychical Research and Theology 5\nThere is another element in the problem of religion\u2014its develop-\nment. The theologian of the liberal type has generally held that\nthe history of religion, in spite of its very questionable pages, has\nbeen, on the whole, a progress in the apprehension of Reality. He\nhas contended that the crudest creed had some scintilla of truth and\nthat the development of the idea of God, culminating in the Christian\nrevelation, was the evolution not of an illusion but of a concept\nwhich is, in Leibniz\u2019s phrase, be^ie fundatum. The theologian\nhas not found it an easy task to interpret the story of religion as one\nwhich has a denouement, though Ido not think he has been defending\na hopeless cause even on the assumption that the commonly accepted\npresuppositions of Anthropology are correct. He may at least claim\nthe support of Dr Whitehead, who has said that religion is the one\nsphere of human activity in which progress is undeniable. But\nthere has been one formidable difficulty. Religion has been associ-\nated with beliefs and practices which, from the standpoint of modern\nscientific common sense, are illusions and superstitions. It has\nbelieved that it had experiences which in fact it could not have had.\nThe question is obvious : Where so much is admittedly superstition\nand error may we not infer that the central belief, that in God, and\nall the experience associated with it are infected with the same\nillusiveness? The inference is natural enough, though illogical.\nThere would be a gain, if not from the standpoint of pure reason at\nleast for the imagination, if we could push back the frontiers of mere\nphantasy in the history of religion.\nProfessor Price in his Presidential Address expressed the hope\nthat anthropologists would learn something of psychical research\nand psychical researchers something of Anthropology. It is indeed\nmuch to be wished. Scientific research on the history of religion has\ntaken for granted that nothing can happen which is undreamed of\nin Herbert Spencer\u2019s philosophy. It is often said that spiritualism\nis the revival of ancient superstitions and there is obvious truth in\nthe remark, but it may be that the revival is due not only to the\npersistent needs of the human mind and its readiness to be deceived,\nbut also to the fact that there was some basis in genuine experience\nfor these ancient beliefs. Certainly the phenomena of the medium\u2019s\ntrance, clairvoyance, and haunting, which have been the subject of\ncareful study, seem to be analogous to what we hear of oracles and\nof the sacred places. We must add that the mixture of fraud with\nauthentic paranormal phenomena seems to be testified both in\nancient and modern times. There is good evidence that pious de-\nception played a part in the temple-worship of more than one\nancient religion. It is, I understand, the opinion of experienced\n\f6 W. R. Mattheivs, D.D. [part\ninvestigators that mediums who have been detected in trickery have\nsometimes been possessed of genuine powers of producing para-\nnormal phenomena.\nThough it is evident enough that these observations are strictly\nrelevant to one branch of theological study, it is exceedingly difficult\nto say precisely what consequences they might be expected to have.\nI have suggested that psychical research may throw light on the\ndevelopment of religion and perhaps do something to remove the\nimpression that, at least in its earlier stages, it consists entirely of\nillusions, but evidently the theologian will be left with a new\nproblem on his hands. What relation have these psychic experi-\nences with the growth of the knowledge of God and how are they\nto be connected with the idea of revelation? I certainly have no\nsolution to this problem and I suggest that the theologian cannot\nreally make mucb progress in its solution until there is some measure\nof agreement among investigators concerning the causes of the\nphenomena. If the spiritistic hypothesis should eventually be\naccepted as the most likely one, we should be back at a position very\nmuch like that of the primitive Church, which, while repudiating\nthe whole of pagan religion, did not question the existence of the\nheathen deities or the reality of their influence. St. Paul, at least in\none phase of his thought, seems to have regarded the whole of the\nreligion of the world prior to the advent of Christ as partly the work\nof evil spirits and partly due to the mediation of spirits which were\nnot evil but certainly lower than God. Christ, according to this\nview, triumphed over all these \u201c powers and principalities \u201d not by\nshowing that they did not exist but by making them unnecessary,\nby opening direct access to God. The horror of falling away from\nChrist to pay honour to spiritual powers was not that they did not\nexist but that they did, and the backslider was to be reprehended,\nnot because he was superstitious but because he was under the\ninfluence of spiritual forces which were either evil or at least lower\nthan the highest. It seems not impossible that a conception of this\nkind may once again appear as worthy of the consideration of\nphilosophers.\nThe central question for theology is the reality of God and His\nnature. Every other problem is subordinate to this and must be\ntreated in relation to it. Though there are undoubtedly persons, as\nI have remarked, who have had their faith in God increased and\nenlarged by their study of psychic phenomena, I do not see how\nTheology can gain any direct assistance from this source. No one\nwho understands what he is about would suppose that there could\nbe a purely empirical argument for Theism or that God could be the\n\f161 ]\nPsychical Research and Theology 7\nconclusion of an investigation by scientific methods. This does not\nmean that empirical data do not play a necessary part in the\nargument for Theism ;\nthey are the starting point, for example, of\nthe famous Cosmological and Teleological proofs. The most which\nwe can expect from psychical research is some significant addition\nto the data. The alleged communications of departed spirits deal\nfrequently with this central problem of theology, but I must confess\nthat, with few exceptions, the sermons of the departed seem worse\neven than those of preachers still in the flesh\u2014more dogmatic and\nless coherent. That some personality purporting to be the spirit of\na great man or of a friend should believe in God is not necessarily\nmore convincing than the fact that Mr H. G. Wells does not believe\nin God. We do not know what opportunities the alleged communi-\ncator has for arriving at a rational conclusion. Nor again, so far as\nI have been able to judge, is there any unanimity in the utterances\nof \u201c spirits \u201d, either on the nature of God or even on His reality.\nEven if we accept the spiritistic hypothesis, there is nothing of any\nimportance to be gained with respect to belief in God from the\ntestimony of the departed.\nNevertheless I think the results of psychical research have a\ncertain indirect value for the theologian in his unending debate on\nthe question An Deus sit. The great enemy of theistic belief is\nmaterialism in the wider sense\u2014that naive philosophy which is the\nnatural initial assumption of both common sense and science. We\nneed not define materialism further than by saying that it covers\nany philosophy which seeks to explain the higher in terms of the\nlower and, more specifically, regards mind as wholly dependent upon\nthe physical order or even as a kind of shadow cast by it. I do not\nsay that a refutation of this theory is equivalent to a demonstration\nof Theism, for there are other views which escape the absurdities\nof materialism, but I suggest that to expose its inadequacy is an\nimportant element in the case for Theism.\nI do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not hold that psychical\nresearch has provided us with a disproof of materialism nor that it\ncan do so ;\nthe claim which I would make is more modest. It seems\nto me that a survey of the evidence, on the whole, suggests that\nmaterialism will not do. It makes the hypothesis not more plausible\nbut less.\nLet us glance briefly at the data. I suppose that the fact of tele-\npathic communication is about as widely accepted as anything in\nthis highly controversial field. It would, of course, be absurd to\nallege that no explanation is conceivable which would not harmonise\nwith a materialistic philosophy, but the facts as we have them seem\n\f8 W. R. Mattheivs, D.D. [part\nhighly recalcitrant to such treatment. On the surface, what we i\nhave is a direct communication between mind and mind, in some |\ninstances at least, apparently instantaneous over long distances. So !\nfar as I know, no physical hypothesis which even pretends to explain J\nthe phenomena has ever been put forward. The general statement\n'\nthat it is \u201c all done by waves \u201d seems about as enlightening as the\nexplanation that the vanishing trick by conjurers is \u201c all done by\nmirrors \u201d, for even if there were a vibration detected, which seems\nunlikely, a vibration is not a thought or a feeling.\nIn the present circumstances it seems wise to say nothing about\n\u201c extra-sensory perception \u201d, because the experiments in this\ncountry have failed to confirm Dr Rhine\u2019s results, and it would seem\nunlikely that the atmosphere of Duke University is specially favour-\nable for the development of this faculty. It is sufficient to observe\nthat, if the existence of this power should be proved, even in one\ninstance, it would be very difficult to fit in with any materialistic\nphilosophy.\nThe phenomena of prediction, in the various forms in which they\nare alleged to occur, are admittedly perplexing, but so far as my\nreading goes it is difficult to doubt that authenticated cases are not\nvery uncommon. Assuming that there are experiences which seem\nto presuppose acquaintance with events which have not yet occurred,\nthey would have indirectly an important bearing on belief in God.\nIn the first place, they may be said to lend some support to the belief\nitself. Personally, I do not see that theories about the nature of\ntime, interesting and important as they are, can clear up the mystery.\nThere may be many time-series, but the event which is foreseen or\npredicted is an event which will happen in the time-series of the\nj\npersons concerned, the one in which they are now and which will ;\ncontinue until the predicted event comes to pass. The problem is,\nhow can an event, which has not yet happened, be an object of\nknowledge, not by inference, but by acquaintance ? Probably there\nare several philosophies which could incorporate this alleged fact,\nbut at least it may be said for Theism that it has a ready explanation.\nEvents may exist before they happen in the mind of God. But this i\nbrings us to the second theological implication of prediction. Must\nwe not hold, if we adopt the theistic explanation, that all events\nare necessary, that the divine Providence orders all things in such\na way that nothing is really contingent and freedom of choice is an\nillusion? Some Christian theologians have not shrunk from these\nconclusions, but whatever may be said for them on other grounds,\nI do not think they are necessary consequences of prediction. It !\nwould be equally plausible to conceive that all the possible courses\n\f161 ] Psychical Research and Theology 0\nof events are present to the divine Mind and that the one predicted\nis only one of the events which may occur. Most of us know of\ninstances where an apparently predictive experience has indicated\nan event which might have happened and which nearly happened\nbut which did not happen. Possibly the prediction hindered its\nown fulfilment. The theologian would have no difficulty in sup-\nposing that some predictive experiences are warnings which may or\nmay not be heeded.\nI shall have to refer to the problem of survival later in the lecture,\nbut it is obviously relevant to this question which I am at present\ndiscussing. It would, I suppose, be accepted by all psychical re-\nsearchers that the hypothesis of survival is one of the \u201c live options \u201d,\nto use a phrase invented by one of our most eminent Presidents.\nNothing has emerged which rules out the hypothesis, and I think we\nmay go further and say that several facts have been established\nwhich would certainly not have been anticipated by one who holds\nthat consciousness is a function of the body. The persistence of the\npersonality after the dissolution of the physical organism not only\nremains a possibility but there are indications that the purely\nempirical investigation renders it more plausible than it was when\nthese super-normal phenomena were regarded as nothing but\nillusion. That I believe to be a cautious statement of the position\nand, if it is correct, we may say that psychical research has here\nagain failed to confirm materialism and has, within limits, afforded\nsome support to a contrary theory ;\nfor it seems to me to be beyond\nquestion that the establishment of survival would be a fatal blow\nto every type of materialist hypothesis.\nIf I had milimited time at my disposal I should now proceed to\ndiscuss the bearing of physical phenomena, such as telekinesis, on\nthe question before us, but the facts are so perplexing that I have\nnothing of any importance to contribute to their explanation. On\nthe whole, they seem to suggest once more the existence of force\nwhich is not, in any ordinary sense of the word, physical.\nI do not doubt that hypotheses of a materialistic kind can be\nframed to cover all these phenomena which I have briefly touched\nupon, but they become so complex that they lack persuasiveness.\nThe general impression, I suggest, which an unprejudiced observer\nwould gain from a survey of the various classes of well-authenticated\nsuper-normal phenomena would be unfavourable to a materialist\nphilosophy and thus, up to a point, favourable to the theistic\nconception, but, I must repeat, I do not think for a moment\nthat any direct support for belief in God can be gained from them.\nPerhaps we might put it roughly in this way : the phenomena\n\f10 W. R. Matthews, D.D. [part\nin question are much less surprising and disconcerting to one who\nholds a theistic philosophy than to one whose presuppositions are\nmaterialistic.\nThe plan of my lecture obliges me to pass rapidly from one subject\nto another and I must now make some remarks on a matter which\nhas great importance for Christians\u2014the reliability of the New\nTestament narratives as a whole. I believe that one of the indirect\neffects of psychical research has been to encourage a new attitude\non the part of critical scholars to the so-called \u201c miraculous\n\u201d\nelement in the Gospels and Acts. In this field, as in the wider field\nof the history of religion, we have been under the domination of a\nnarrow rationalism which assumed in advance that \u201c miracles do\nnot happen \u201d ;\nby this is meant that no event could possibly have\noccurred which transcended commonplace experience. Thus it\nbecame necessary to relegate all the supernatural incidents of the\nNew Testament to the category of mistake, illusion or legend. The\nconsequences of this supposed scientific necessity were embarrassing,\nbecause the earliest sources for the life of Christ plainly represent\nHim as the possessor of abnormal powers and, if the whole of this\nelement in the Gospels must be rejected, we are left with a residuum\nwhich must itself be suspect by reason of its association with such\nquestionable matter. A great accumulation of knowledge, not all\nof it derived from psychical research, has altered the situation.\nSpiritual and mental healing, the study of divided personahties,\nclairvoyance, telekinesis, all these have suggested very forcibly that\nthe limits of the credible were too narrowly drawn by the older\nrationalists. It appears to me that the Society for Psychical\nResearch is a standing refutation of Hume\u2019s famous argument\nagainst miracles. You remember that, taking a miracle to be an\nevent contrary to common experience, he urged that it is more\nprobable that testimony should be false or mistaken than that a\nmiracle should happen. But all the phenomena w'hich our Society\ninvestigates are contrary to common experience, yet we are per-\nsuaded that some at least of them occur. In view of these facts\nI do not believe that any reasonable person would be inclined to\nassign limits to what phenomena might accompany the appearance\nof a personality which, in any view, was among the most potent\ninfluences which history records. Professor Saurat has recently\nillustrated the vision of St. Peter which revealed to him the necessity\nof admitting Gentiles into the Church by analogies with modern\ninstances of telepathy and no doubt other detailed applications to\nNew Testament narratives have been made. But the chief interest\nof all this to the theologian, apart from its bearing on the reliability\n\f161 ] Psychical Research and Theology 11\nof the records, is the light which may be thrown on the significance\nof the supernatural in the life of Christ.\nThe attitude of Jesus towards His own \u201c mighty works \u201d is not\neasy to determine. On the one hand, when confronted by the\nmessengers of John the Baptist with the question :\n\u201c Art thou he\nthat should come? \u201d He points to works of healing culminating in\nthe raising of the dead and puts along with them the fact that \u201c the\npoor have the good news proclaimed to them \u201d. It may be that\nthese \u201c mighty works \u201d are to be understood in a fignrative sense,\nthat the lame in spirit walk, the spiritually blind see and the spiri-\ntually dead are raised up, but I think this is unlikely and that the\nEvangelist at least meant the words to be taken literally. On the\nother hand, Jesus says that it is an evil generation which seeks for\na sign. We may perhaps conclude that He attached a quite second-\nary importance to the supernatural powers which He exercised, but\nthat He considered them to have value as arresting attention and\ngiving confirmation of his unique character and mission. The result\nof a fresh consideration of the miraculous narratives in the light of\nmodern psychical research would go some way to confirm this point\nof view. Obviously the old-fashioned \u201c argument from miracles\n\u201d\nreceives no support. That depended on the assumption that the\nmiracles of the Gospels were unique, and evidently we shall not help\nthat assumption by finding analogies to them. But the occurrence\nof these remarkable phenomena is at least congruous with the belief\nthat the Person who caused them was unique. Spiritual power\nmight be expected to manifest itself, not only in teaching and heroic\naction, but by the use of psychic capacities for spiritual purposes.\nI now turn to the subject which to many appears the only im-\nportant one\u2014that of survival. Among those who are convinced\nthat psychical research establishes, or goes near to establish, survival\nof bodily death there is much natural impatience with theologians,\nbecause they have been so slow to avail themselves of the help which\nwas at hand. I have already said that I admit the theologians have\nbeen excessively timid on the whole in this matter, but I must add\nthey have reasons for hesitation which are worthy of respect. The\nmost important reason is that they are not sure of the ground ;\nthey do not know whether the belief in survival, which might be\nsupported by psychical research, is really a spiritual behef at all.\nChristian thinkers of many different schools have expressed this\ndoubt. They would say, the belief that human personality survives\ndeath is not, as such, a rehgious belief, nor has it any spiritual value.\nThe only immortality which is worth having and which forms a\npart of the Christian hope is life in the presence of God. That this\n\f12 W. JR. Mattheivs, D.D. [part\npersonality just as it is will go on after the dissolution of the body\nis not necessarily good news\u2014it may be very bad news. The\nreligious man should desire a future life only in so far as it offers\nnew opportunities of spiritual progress and closer communion with\nGod. Some of these theologians lay stress upon the distinction\nbetween the future life and eternal life, by which they mean life\ninterpenetrated by the eternal values. Some, it seems, regard the\nquestion of a future life almost with indifference on the ground that\nthe eternal life which is not subject to the limitations of time may\nbe oiirs here and now.\nWe must admit that there is some ground for the suspicion with\nwhich many theologians regard the empirical proof of survival.\nHeine said that most believers would be perfectly happy without\nGod if they could be sure of their own immortality ;\nthey needed\nHim only as a guarantee that they would not perish. No one would\ndoubt that Christians of this kind exist and no one would doubt that\nthey are very bad Christians. History and modern experience show\nthat excessive concern with the question of one\u2019s own survival and\nthat of one\u2019s friends may have a deleterious effect on the life of the\nspirit. Historians of Hebrew religion have pointed out the para-\ndoxical fact that it was partly because the Hebrews had no belief\nfor a long time in personal survival that their conception of God\nwas able to develop along lines quite different from those of the\nother Semites.\nBut when all this is said, I cannot agree that Theology may safely\nignore the empirical evidence. In my opinion, the only arguments\nfor personal immortality which have any value depend upon the\nbelief in the existence of God ;\nand further no conceivable accumu-\nlation of evidence could prove the reality of everlasting life.\nPlainly the evidence could, at the most, show that some persons\nsurvived bodily death, but it could not show that all persons did,\nnor could it show that any persons triumphed over death so that it\nhad no more dominion over them. The possibility would remain\nthat extinction overtook them in the end. Nevertheless, within\nthese limits, the existence of empirical evidence for survival would,\nI think, have important religious and theological consequences.\nThere are some minds which are wellnigh impervious to philosophical\nand theological reasoning, but which capitulate to facts. I do not\ndoubt that a demonstration, if such a thing could be imagined,\nwhich convinced everyone that a particular individual who had\ndied was communicating with his friends would have a profound\neffect on the outlook of the majority of people and that this effect\nwould be to incline them to a religious view of life. But I would go\n\f161 ]\nPsychical Research and Theology 13\nfurther. It seems to me that, however firmly persuaded a man\nmight be on other grounds that the soul is immortal, he ought to\nwelcome facts which tend to confirm belief that death is not final.\nFor the standing difficulty is this, that death appears indeed to be\nthe \u201c bourne from which no traveller returns \u201d. Beyond there is\nsilence. The voice which we once heard we hear no more, the\nthoughts which we once shared we share no longer. However great\nour faith or our reliance on arguments of reason, we cannot stifle the\nconjecture that there \u201c all their thoughts perish \u201d. To me at least\nit would be a momentous thing if I could be sure that a thought had\ncome to me from one whom I had known on earth and was now no\nlonger among those we call \u201c the living \u201d.\nHas this happened? or to ask a more modest question. Has\npsychical research produced any evidence which makes belief in\nsurvival more probable, from a strictly scientific point of view?\nYou will not expect me to sum up at the end of a lecture a complex\nand controversial problem, nor do I imagine that my personal\nviews are likely to have any considerable value, but since the\nrelation of psychical research to Theology does depend, to some\nextent, on the question of what hopes of a positive result from these\nenquiries may be entertained, I feel that I should be shirking an\nimportant issue if I did not give my opinion for what it is worth.\nOne is sometimes tempted to believe that some power\u2014whether\nbeneficent or malevolent I do not know\u2014has determined that we\nshall never reach certainty on the subject of the life beyond and that\nto secure this it has sent a lying spirit into the prophets. The\nrecords of psychical research are full of deceit, fraud and illusion.\nBut when one has discounted all this there remains a residuum of\nestablished facts which, prima facie, suggest the hypothesis of\nsurvival ;\nthat at least is my opinion. I am confirmed in this con-\nclusion by observing that several eminent philosophers, who for\nvarious reasons are reluctant to accept the survival theory, have\nrecently been led to put forward alternative theories which, in effect,\nadmit some kind of persistence after death, though not personal\n,\npersistence. I refer, of course, to the various forms of the \u201c psychic\nfactor \u201d hypothesis. I suppose that these philosophers have con-\nvinced themselves that telepathy between the living does not\naccount for all the phenomena, and in this they are surely right.\nProfessor H. H. Price, in his Presidential Address, developed a\ntheory on the lines of the psychic factor to explain certain types of\nhaunting in which he used the conception of an \u201c aether of images \u201d.\nWith modesty as rare in a philosopher as it is praiseworthy, he con-\nI\nceded that his theory might turn out to be \u201c nonsense \u201d and that\n\f14 W. K. Matthews, D.D. [part\nit could be torn in pieces by a competent second-year student of ;\nphilosophy. I am certainly very far from thinking that the theory\nis nonsense and I have had enough experience to know that many\nideas which suffer annihilating dissection at the hands of second-\nyear students survive as useful guides along the path to truth in the\nminds of wiser men. No doubt this is the case with the President\u2019s\nfascinating hypothesis, but I confess I found myself saying, \u201c How\nmuch simpler to believe in ghosts! \u201d Of course, the reflection was\nstupid, because it is by no means simple to believe in ghosts or i\nindeed to say what believing in ghosts means. Nevertheless there\nwas perhaps a serious thought behind the frivolous exclamation.\nI think it was this. Unless I am mistaken, every theory which i\nemploys the concept of a \u201c psychic factor \u201d existing apart from a i\npsyche must hold the possibility of what Mr Bradley used to call\n\u201c floating ideas \u201d. The word \u201c factor \u201d is a vague one and I confess !|\nI do not know what it means in this connection. The word I\n\u201c psychic \u201d is not vague. It means, I suppose, anything that may i\nbe an element in the experience of a psyche, such as thoughts, ,\nemotions, feelings, conation and acts of choice. The phrase \u201c psychic :\nfactor \u201d seems to be a rather confusing way of saying that thoughts, ^\nemotions, feelings and all the rest have a kind of independent exist- ^\nence, so much so that they may persist when there is no longer any [j\nconsciousness which possesses them. The theory is generally\ndeveloped on the basis of the persistence of images, and here perhaps i\nit offers least difficulty, but, to confine ourselves to the subject of\nhaunting, these images seem, in some cases, to be charged with !i\nemotion, and a feeling which is no longer felt has a mode of existence i\nwhich baffles me. !i\nOne is left with the question whether the idea of thoughts which |i\nare not thought, of images which are not conceived and of experience i\nwhich is not experienced is really an intelligible one. There is at j\nleast no evidence of the existence of such \u201c floating ideas \u201d. If the i\nbeliever in survival is confronted with the alleged fact that we have\nno knowledge of any consciousness which is not associated with an\norganism, he may reply, with even greater force, that we have no\nj\nknowledge of psychic factors except in relation with a psyche. In\nj\nview of the perplexities which arise when we try to make clear the\nmeaning of a \u201c psychic factor \u201d I should be inclined to expect that\nthis very limited advance towards the hypothesis of survival will\nhave to be amended and that any amendment will bring it nearer\nto the ordinary conception of the survival of the self.\nSince in this part of my lecture I am perforce giving simply my\nown opinions, I may be allowed to add a comment on the idea of\n\f161 ]\nPsychical Research and Theology 15\nsurvival. One of the objections made against it as an explanatory\nhypothesis is that it is vague, indefinite and obscure, that its meaning\nneeds to be defined. After grappling with some of the alternative\nhypotheses, I confess that this particular objection strikes me as\nodd. Indeed I should have said that one of its chief virtues is its\nsimplicity and intelligibility compared with the com2Jlexity and\nabstruseness of its rivals. No one questions that the application of\nthe hjqiothesis to the facts offers many problems, but the hypo-\nthesis itself could be stated, I should have thought, in words to\nwhich everyone attaches a meaning. Personal survival is the hypo-\nI thesis that the centre of consciousness which was in existence before\n. death does not cease to be in existence after death and that the\ni experience of this centre after death has the same kind of continuity\nI\nwith its experience before death as that of a man who sleeps for a\nwhile and wakes again. The difficulty that our experience is largely\nthat of states and changes of our bodies is certainly formidable but\nnot, I think, decisive. We have at least in Professor Price\u2019s Pre-\nsidential Address some valuable suggestions towards the conception\nof a \u201c spiritual body \u201d which has a real continuity with the body of\nflesh. I repeat, the survival hypothesis may be hard to accept, but\nI cannot think it is hard to understand.\nThis lecture has, I fear, been rather of the nature of observations\non several topics and I should be the last to claim that it has estab-\nhshed any conclusions. It is no excuse to say that I have laboured\nat it, for I fear in the result I have been hke the poet spoken of by\nAlexander Pope, \u201c sleepless myself to give my hearers sleep I\nmust plead that the subject is new and very large. It may have\nbeen worth while to try to map out the country which, as I think,\nwaits for theologians to explore.\n\u00ab\nk'JinGO\n\f16 Alice Johnson [PAET\nOBITUARY\nAlice Johnson\nAlice Johnson was a member of a large family well known in\nCambridge, and entered Newnbam College in 1878. She became a\nscholar of the College in 1 880, gained a First Class in Natural Science\nin 1881, and was elected Bathurst Student in 1882. Shortly after\nthis the Balfour Laboratory, founded to commemorate the work of\nProfessor Francis Balfour, was inaugurated as part of Newnham\nmainly through the efforts and generosity of Mrs Sidgwick, and\nAlice Johnson was appointed in 1884 the first Demonstrator in\nAnimal Morphology there, a post which she held until 1890.\nIt was natural that anyone brought closely into touch with Prof,\nand Mrs Sidgwick should develop an interest in psychical research.\nIn 1889 she took part as a sitter in the first series of sittings given\nby Mrs Piper in England, and in the following year she assisted Mrs\nSidgwick in carrying out the well-known \u201c Brighton experiments in\nthought-transference \u201d recorded in Proceedings Vol. VIII.\nAbout this time the Society took in hand one of its most important\npieces of work, the Census of Hallucinations, the report on which,\njnibli.shed in 1894 in Vol. X of Proceedings, is one of the recognised\nclassics of psychical research. Alice Johnson was a memher of the\nCommittee which took the Census and presented the report, her\ncolleagues being Prof, and Mrs Henry Sidgwick, Frederic Myers and\nFrank Podmore. Her work on the Census gave her invaluable ex-\nperience in the critical analysis and valuation of evidence in \u201c spon-\ntaneous cases \u201d.\nAfter being for several years private secretary to Mrs Sidgwick,\n.she became in 1899 Editor of the Society\u2019s Proceedings, the proposal\nfor her appointment being made by Frederic Myers. In 1903 she\nwas appointed Organising Secretary of the Society, and at the end\nof 1908 Research Officer, a post she held until her retirement owing\nto ill health in 1916. How large a part she played in the Society\u2019s\nwork during those years may be gauged from the fact that in the\nCombined Index for the Proceedings and Journal, covering the years\n1901 to 1913, the entries under her name occupy more than four\npages.\n\f161 ]\nObituary 17\nOf any period in the Society\u2019s history it may be said that it was a\nperiod of great difficulty. The particular difficulties confronting the\nSociety during Alice Johnson\u2019s tenure of office arose largely through\nthe death of Henry Sidgwick in 1900 and of Frederic Myers in 1901\n.\nThe loss in rapid succession of two of the principal founders and\nleaders of a still young society might easily, but for the energy of\nthose on whom the guidance of affairs then devolved, have led\neither to a decline in the quantity and quality of the Society\u2019s work,\nor to the Society developing tendencies in a direction contrary to\nthe founders\u2019 intentions. To Alice Johnson belongs no small\nshare of the credit for preserving the S.P.E. from either of these\ndisasters.\nFrederic Myers did not live to complete Human Personality, and\nthe work of preparing the book for the press was entrusted to\nRichard Hodgson and Alice Johnson, the latter having already been\noccupied with the general supervision of the press work and the\nmarshalling of the Appendices, which were a most important part\nof the book.\nMost of Alice Johnson\u2019s research work related to the \u201c mental\nphenomena \u201d, as her grasp of the problems of evidence can have\nleft her in little doubt that progress was most likely to be made in\nthat direction. But two papers by her in Vol. XXI of Proceedings,\nwritten shortly after a visit to the United States to investigate\n\u201c physical \u201d phenomena there, contain valuable discussions as to\nthe possible hallucination of sitters under the conditions of the\nseance room.\nSpontaneous cases of \u201c mental \u201d phenomena were at that time\nreported to the S.P.R. in a profusion that the present officers can\nonly envy. The persons concerned in these cases are often in a\nhighly emotional state, and need to be handled with tactful sym-\npathy. Alice Johnson possessed this quality in a high degree, but\nshe was able to combine with it a strict adherence to the evidential\nstandards on which the Society has always insisted. Carelessly\nreported and badly documented cases met with a polite but firm\nrejection at her hands.\nThe automatic writings of the \u201c S.P.R. group of automatists \u201d,\n: which began shortly after Myers\u2019s death, presented entirely new\n!\nproblems of investigation. Nothing could have been made of them\ni without most careful and systematic documentation on the one\nI\nhand, and on the other great enterprise as regards interpretation\ni\nand theory. Subsequent developments have shown how well and\nj\ntruly were laid the foundations of this novel and difficult study,\nthe importance of which was on the increase throughout Alice\n\f18 Alice Johnson [part\nJohnson\u2019s tenure of office. With this study she was from the first\nintimately associated, and several of her most important papers in\nProceedings deal with automatic scripts, particularly Mrs Holland\u2019s,\nand the theory of cross-correspondences : see Proceedings Vols.\nXXI, XXIV and XXV.\nAfter her retirement through ill-health in 1916 she retained the\nliveliest interest in psychical research, and gladly allowed herself\nto be consulted on matters of interest to the Society. It is appro-\njDriate that her last paper in Proceedings (Vol. XLIV) should have\nbeen a tribute to Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s work in psychical research.\nBelow are printed contributions from two former colleagues of\nAlice Johnson, Mrs W. H. Salter and Miss Isabel Newton.\nI first came to know Alice Johnson well in 1909, when I was\nappointed as her Assistant in the Society\u2019s Research Department.\nI found her daunting in the early months of my apprenticeship. I\nhad a fair general knowledge of psychical research but little previous\nexperience in research. Miss Johnson was a stern exponent of the\nSociety\u2019s most rigorous traditions in exactitude ;\na fault or omission\nnever escaped her eagle eye and the most one seemed to get in praise\nwas \u201cYes, that will do \u201d. But I realised after a time that it was only\na matter of adjusting oneself to a rather low scale in the expression\nof approval. A good piece of work would always find recognition\n(though the words might be few and the manner dry), and when I\nwas criticised, I was bound to admit on reflection that criticism was\ndeserved.\nMiss Johnson was (as every scientific worker should be) meticu-\nlously accurate in ascertaining and recording all relevant facts ;\nshe was never satisfied with anything less than the whole truth, so\nfar as it was discoverable, and she expected others to conform to her\nown high standard. To work with her was an admirable training in\n.scientific method.\nI also came to realise very soon the human sympathy and under-\nstanding that underlay that dry manner. It fell to Miss Johnson\u2019s\nlot (and to mine as her Assistant) to interview many of those who\ncame to the Society either to report personal experiences or to seek\nadvice. She was impatient of pretentious claims and a good judge\nof character, not easily deceived, but where she felt that there was\na prospect of getting good material for the Society, or a need of\nhelp that she could give, she never grudged time or trouble. She\nhad also in dealing with the human side of the Society\u2019s work a\ndelightful sense of humour, which must often have stood her in good\nstead.\n\f161 ]\nObituary 19\nI cannot imagine any one being associated with Alice Johnson\nwithout coming to feel for her not only great respect, but also great\naffection. I shall always keep a very pleasant memory of the years\nwe worked together, and I feel that whatever value my own work\nmay have for psychical research it owes largely to her teaching.\nHklen de G. Salter.\nMrs Salter has asked me to add to the Obituary of Miss Alice\nJohnson a note on some of my own personal impressions concerning\nher. These were formed during the years 1903-1916, when I worked\nwith her, first as an Assistant in the office, and later as Secretary\nof the Society. At this distance of time the characteristics that\nstand out most clearly in my memory are her courtesy, her con-\nsideration for all who worked with her, her absorption in the work\nof the Society, her sympathy, her sensitiveness and her integrity.\nTo a complete and very unsophisticated novice\u2014as I was in 1903\n\u2014who dreaded the expected brusqueness of office manners. Miss\nJohnson\u2019s gentle courtesy was not only a thing of beauty, but it\nj\nwas to me an incentive to put forth my best efforts. It conveyed\nencouragement and confidence, and it never failed, notwithstanding\nmistakes and ignorance on my part. Looking back, I see myself\nas ever conscious and appreciative of it.\nIt had certain modulations, however, and by these she expressed\ndispleasure. Here I am reminded of her dislike of pretensions, and\n:\nof every form of overstatement. Her reaction to these not uncom-\ni nion weaknesses was immediate ; her manner would stiffen, her\ncourtesy become chilling, and a faint air of hostility would spring\nI up l:)etween herself and the offender. I have a vivid recollection of\ni\nan occasion when, describing an interview she had just had with\none of the most persistent offenders in this respect, she confessed to\nhaving been \u201c quite rude \u201d. This being my one and only association\n: of \u201c rudeness \u201d with her is probably the reason why this trivial\nincident was not forgotten years ago.\n.\nMy earliest memory of the office is of being asked by Miss Johnson\nto write more clearly, so that the postmen should be able to see at\na glance the destination of the letters and so be spared unnecessary\ntrouble. I was to find later that this was typical of the consideration\nshe showed for everyone with whom she was in contact, directly or\nindirectly. I remember her impressing upon me that, in replying\nto correspondents, it was our duty to help them to understand, and\n!\ntelling me that she found it helpful to assume, for that purpose,\n; that they were ignorant and rather stupid. With this in mind she\n\f20 Alice Johnson [part\ntook particular pains to cover every point in the enquiries and to\nmake her meaning clear. Her letters were singularly free from\nambiguities.\nWhen I joined the office staff in October 1903, it was obvious that\nher advent as Secretary the previous March had opened a new era\nin the routine work. We generally found it difficult to trace refer-\nences l)efore that time, but with those of a later date it was a simple\nmatter. In a few months she had gathered the loose ends together\nand had welded them into a system in which there was no confusion\nand no uncertainty. The contrast gave meaning to her almost\nmeticulous insistency on accuracy. I remember that when, moved\nby her disinterestedness and earnestness of purpose, I resolved quite\ndefinitely to \u201c support \u201d her, my part in the co-operation seemed to\nme to consist in nothing more nor less than to be accurate in every\nparticular\n!\nIn the office her manner was gentle and rather shy. But her rule\nwas absolute. She was exacting to a degree in the matter of accu-\nracy and thoroughness. Her displeasure was expressed by the\nslight but unmistakable coldness of manner to which I have alluded ;\nnever by words of blame. She was invariably reasonable and just.\nShe showed thoughtful consideration for her staff in every possible\nway. And she created, probably quite unconsciously, a strong\nl)ond of unity between herself and her colleagues. There was never\nany friction. I cannot recall one instance of a member of the staff\nuttering a word of complaint against her.\nHer devotion to the interests of the Society impressed me greatly.\nI thought she sacrificed much for it, as it absorbed all her energy.\nShe was a slow worker ;\nthis, I think, was owing to the pains she\ntook to perceive clearly, and to impart her knowledge clearly. She\nworked quietly and steadily, and was never hurried. Pictures of\nher slip in and out of my mind as I write, but there is one that pre-\ndominates. It is as I saw her evening after evening, when at six\no\u2019clock I closed the office and went to her rooms for her letters. She\nwas seated at her desk writing, her grey head bent low under the\nlight of an electric lamp at her elbow, her short-sighted eyes close to\nthe ]iaper. She was always intent. I got the impression then that\nher mind was never in flight : that she held it captive, forcing it to\nrecord with exactitude what she wished to imjjart.\nLunching recently with Mrs Thatcher, a former Assistant-\nSecretary of the Society, I asked her what stood out most in her\nmemory of Miss Johnson, and she answered at once, \u201c Her shyness,\nand her absorption in the work of the Society.\u201d \u201c I have a mental\nimage of her,\u201d she added, and went on to describe it. It was of\n\f161] Obituary 21\nMiss Johnson writing at her desk, and it tallied with mine in almost\nevery detail.\nWhen the Rooms of the Society were closed during August and\nSeptember for the vacation, we understood that Miss Johnson did\nnot wish to be approached on S.P.R. matters. She attached great\nimportance to good holidays, and 1 took it for granted that she then\nrelaxed. She always came back looking refreshed, but she did not\ntalk about her holiday. She rarely spoke about herself. It was our\ncustom to have tea together every afternoon, Imt even then we\ngenerally discussed the affairs of the Society, and were more or less\nimpersonal. (It is odd, but I cannot remember ever having heard\nMiss Johnson\u2019s \u201c voice in laughter \u201d.) I think that this lack of\nsocial intimacy was due partly to her inherent shyness, and partly\nto a kind of mental decorum on my side, imposed by her seriousness\nand by the fact that I felt, rightly or wrongly, that she invested the\noffice of Secretary (which I then held) with the dignity of a high\ncalling. I think now that we probably might have had more fun.\nShe belonged to the academic world, and her knowledge of life and\nhuman nature outside it was limited, but I remember several\nincidents which suggest that she enjoyed seeing other outlooks,\nwhen they were sincere and natural.\nShe had a great capacity for sympathy, and a gift for expressing\nit in letters simply and sincerely. But it was shown mostly in deeds.\nI received so many kindnesses from her that, looking back, I see them\nrather as evidence of an attitude to life than as detached actions. It\nwas as if she had assumed a certain moral responsibility for my\nwelfare as a colleague. Her kindness was sjiontaneous, and always\npractical. In various ways she greatly added to my comfort and\nwell-being, and it was not until I enjoyed the benefits of her fore-\nthought that I realised my former need. In particular, I can never\nforget her great kindness during a long and serious illness I had in\n1912. She thought of everything to help me. Again when I was\nlaid up the following year, she visited the Nursing Home and assured\nherself that the best arrangements were made for me. I can say\nwithout being guilty of an overstatement that, outside my own\nfamily, no one showed so much solicitude for my well-being. She\ncontinued to show it after she left the Society, until a comparatively\nshort time before her death ;\nfearing that this or that arrangement\nmight \u201c fall heavily upon \u201d me, reminding me to take a \u201c good\nholiday \u201d, and \u201c not to overwork \u201d. \u201c And try not to be anxious\nas to how things go.\u201d I think that this extract from one of her\nletters not only shows sympathy, but suggests that things were not\nalways easy for her.\n\f22 Alice Johnson [part\nFew members of the Society knew her as we knew her in the\noffice. Some saw her as a ratlier austere little hgure, with an academic\nmanner which alarmed them. Some in closer contact accused her\nof a love of power and resented her authority. This was inevitable,\nfor where there are two diametrically opposed approaches to a sub-\nject, the personal and the scientific, as in psychical research, there\nmust be conflict. Here I see her with a firm grip upon the affairs\nand the policy of the Society, o^iposing tooth and nail everything\nthat threatened to weaken its scientihc character or lower its\nscientific ])restige. She was a formidable foe, with an indomitalde\nwill. She had no vulnerable spots which might have deceived and\ndiverted her. She held herself intact, and subordinate to her\nincorruptible integrity.\nSensitiveness and incorruptible integrity combined often lead to\nunhappy hours and a continual bracing up of courage. I thought\non some occasions that this was Miss Johnson\u2019s experience, and\nseveral memories spring up which support the impression. The\ncontrast between her weakness and her strength inspired in me a\nstrong partisanship. Even now I am touched by her heroic qualities\nand frail physique. I count it a great privilege to have worked with\nher.\nIsabel Newton.\n\f161 ]\nPerrotf Studentship in Psychical Research 23\n[We print beloiv a notice of the Studentship recently established at\nTrinity College, Cambridge, out of Mr F.

D. Broad, Litt.D.\n:\nThe Editor has asked me to write a brief introduction to the two\ni papers, by Mr Whately Carington and Mr Soal, which form the main\n1 contents of the present number of the S.P.R. Proceedings. I am\nI very glad to do so. Mr Ayhately Carington\u2019s work has been done in\nCambridge in consultation with a committee composed of himself,\nI Mr Gatty, Dr Irwin, Dr Thouless, and the present writer. This\ncommittee has held its meetings in my rooms in Trinity ;\nso,\nalthough my lack of expert knowledge and practical experience in\n! statistical method has prevented me from contributing anytliing of\nimportance to their debates, I have at least been in constant touch\nwith this investigation from the outset. I have had no such direct\ncontact with Mr Soaks work. But I have read all that he has pub-\nhshed on the subject with great interest, and I have always admired\nthe patience, thoroughness, and accuracy of all his many-sided con-\ntributions to psychical research. It is an ill war that blows no one\nany good, and the disaster that has befallen Europe has at least had\nthe good result of making Mr Soal a temporary resident in Cam-\nI\nbridge, 'where the members of our committee hve.\nI suspect that the first reaction of many members of the Society\non opening this nmnber of the Proceedings will be to cry \u201c Another\nmass of boring statistical stuff! \u201d, and that the second reaction of\nsome of these will be to leave the contents unread. This Idnd of\nbehaviour may be natural, but it is foolish on general grounds and\nit would be most unfortunate in this particular case. I will now\ngive my reasons for these two assertions.\n\f26 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nIn almost every branch of psychical research the first questioni\nthat arises is this :\n\u2014Have coincidences of a certain kind happened\nmuch more often than they might reasonably be expected to do by\nchance? This question crops up in investigating mediumistic com-\nmunications which purport to give information about a dead person,\nand in investigating the claim that a house is haunted, just as much\nas it does in experimental researches on alleged para-normal\ncognition, such as are reported in the present number of Pro-\nceedings. In the first case we want to know, before going any\nfurther, whether considerably more of the medium\u2019s statements\nabout the alleged communicator agree with the facts about him than\nmight reasonably have been expected by chance. In the second\ncase we want to know whether coincidences between staying in this\nhouse and having sensory hallucinations of a certain kind are more\nnumerous than we might reasonably have anticipated if chance alone\nwere operating. It is only when tliese questions have been answered\nin the afiirmative that there is anything worth investigating further.\nBut, although this kind of question arises everywhere, and al-\nthough in many cases we under.stand vaguely what it means and we\nhave a stronger or weaker personal conviction as to the answer, it\nis only where statistical methods can be applied that the question\nliecomes precise and that a completely definite and objective answer\nbecomes po.ssilde. What exactly is a \u201ccoincidence\u201d? What is\nmeant by a coincidence \u201chappening by chance\u201d? How often\nmight coincidences of a given kind be reasonably expected to happen\nby chance? What amount of deviation from the most probable\nchance-frequency would it be reasonable to ascribe to chance?\nThere is one field of human activity in which precise answers can\nbe given to all these questions, and it is one that is perfectly familiar\nto all of us, viz. what we call \u201c games of chance \u201d, such as are\nplayed with cards, dice, roulette-boards, and so on. These answers\ncan be carried over into other fields without loss of relevance or\nintelligibility just in proportion as those other fields are analogous\nin all relevant respects to actual or conceivable games of chance.\nLet us take an example from ordinary playing-cards. No one\ncompetent to exjiress an ojiinion would question, e.g., any of the\nfollowing statements, except on the ground that a mistake might\nhave been made in the calculations which led to them. The most\nlikely number of hearts in a whist-hand properly dealt from a\nproperly constructed and shufiled pack of ordinary playing cards\nis 3. rile probability that such a hand will contain exactly that\nnumber of hearts is about -286. The probabihty that it will contain\nexactly 4 is only shghtly less, viz. -238. The probabihty that it will\n\fRT 162]\nIntroduction 27\nOD contain more than 6 hearts is -0112. Suppose that 1000 hands were\nei dealt. Then the number of them which contain more than 6 hearts\nI'J apiece is more likely to be 11 than any other number. The proba-\na- .bility that it will be exactly 11 is not great ;\nbut the probability\nIthat it will be less than 16 is -9332, and the probability that it will\nbe less than 20 is -9965. Therefore, if in a thousand hands there\nal were considerably more than 20 which contained more than 6 hearts\n0-\napiece, it would be reasonable to feel almost certain that there was\nly something wrong with the pack or the shuffling or the dealing.\nt! Now contrast this example with cases where statistical methods\nIE cannot be applied, and one can only make such remarks as \u201cIt is\n'incredible to me that Mrs X, that simple and ignorant woman,\nis should by chance have made so many true and striking statements\nre about the deceased Mr Y\u201d. Possibly one\u2019s incredulity may be quite\nle justified, and possibly the situation may have been such that a\nmajority of fair-minded readers with no strong prejudices against\nt, mediumistic communications will come to share it. But it is all\n1- terribly personal and subjective, and experience shows that it leaves\ne most plain men and scientists comj3letely unmoved.\nFor such reasons as these I believe that experiments in psychical\na research which are capable of precise statistical treatment are of the\nr utmost importance. I do not think that we shall ever get orthodox\n3 experimental psychologists to attend to our work unless and until\n1 we can produce results of this kind. We must remember that\n1 experimental psychology is very much in the position of a woman\ne with a shady past who has at length, after a hard struggle, settled\n!\nI\ndown to a respectable life and got on visiting terms with the doctor\u2019s,\n1 the solicitor\u2019s, the vicar\u2019s, and even the squire\u2019s wife. (The scientific\nt equivalent of this apotheosis is being admitted to form a section at\n! the British Association.) She is fanatically determined to keep her\ni\nhard-won respectability unsullied by the slightest breath of scandal.\n'\nPhysics, which has been honoured for centuries, can afford, like the\nscion of some noble house, to throw her cap over the mills ;\nbut poor\ndear psychology feels that she dare not take risks. Now the work\nof contemporary orthodox experimental psychologists is very\nlargely statistical, as anyone can see who looks at their journals.\nSince this ground is so very familiar to them, there is a hope that a\nfew of those extremely shy birds may be tempted to hop over the\nwall which separates them from us, if we can offer them some\nstatistical crumbs, of unimpeachable wholesomeness, to peck at.\nThey certainly ought to be investigating the problems which interest\nus, instead of ignoring them or unhelpfully nagging at us for the\ncrudity and amateurishness of the methods which we have to use\n\f28 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nin default of their advice and assistance. But I am sure that they\nwill continue to neglect that duty until we can bring to their notice\nproperly conducted researches of a statistical kind, such as those of\nMr Whately Carington and Mr Soak\nThere are two remarks of an historical kind which it may be worth\nwhile to make before we leave generalities. The first is this. Some\nreaders may be tempted to complain that such researches as these\ncan at best lead only to trivial and pedestrian results. What inter-\nests them, and what induced them to join the S.P.R., was the hope\nof finding answers to questions of fundamental human importance,\nsuch as the survival or extinction of the individual and the destiny\nof the race. Investigation of trance-mediumship, they will say, has\nat least a chance of throwing light on these important questions ;\nbut these experiments on drawing jiictures and guessing cards are at\nbest difficiles nugae.\nI tlihik that the history of science shows tins attitude to be\nentirely mistaken. It is precisely the attitude against which\nGalileo, Descartes, Bacon, and other great men who assisted at the\nbirth of modern science, constantly and energetically protested.\nWhat could seem more trivial than Galileo dropping balls down\ninclined planes and noting the times of their descent? Yet those\nexperiments are the basis of the science of dynamics, and without\nthem Newton s all-embracing theory of the planetary system would\nhave been impossible. Similarly, if we could establish the fact and\ndisentangle the laws of extra-sensory perception by experiments on\nordinary persons in artificially simplihed situations, we might hope\neventually to form comprehensive and satisfactory theories about\nmediumistic communications. But, if we insist on dehvering blind\nfrontal attacks on unanalysed problems of immense complexity, we\nare likely to share the fate of the scholastic physicists.\nThe second point is this. Any science starts by consisting mainly\nof natural history \u201d. If it develops, the proportion of natural\nhistory becomes smaller and the proportion of theory and deduction\nbecomes greater. As this happens, the science grows more technical,\nand it becomes more and more difficult for the interested amateur\nto contribute anything of value to it, or even to understand the\ncontributions of experts. Just contrast, e.g., the early meetings\nand the early Transactions of the Royal Society with those of the\njiresent day. If we may compare small things with great, we must\nexpect that something of this kind will hajijien with the S.P.R.\nunless it be engaged on a wild-goose chase. Undoubtedly there is\nstill an immense held for natural history \u201d in our subject, and for\nmany years to come the intelligent ami curious amateur will be able\n\f162]\nIntroduction 29\nto make most valuable factual contributions to psychical research.\nBut already, in my opinion, the investigation of alleged physical\nphenomena in the seance-room has ceased to be a job for anyone\nbut a trained specialist with an elaborate knowledge of electrical and\nphotographic technique. I am equally convinced that we have now\nreached a stage in the study of para-normal cognition under experi-\nmental conditions at which statistical methods must be constantly\nand increasingly used. Members of the S.P.R. would do well to recon-\ncile themselves to this inevitable tendency, and to prepare them-\nselves for it by making that quite moderate study of the elements\nof statistics which would enable them to follow intelligently the\nreasoning contained in such papers as Mr Whately Carington's and\nMr Soaks. They would find that the effort was rewarded, not only\nin connexion with psychical research, l)ut also in the many other\ndepartments of life in which statistical concepts and methods are\nnow appfied.\nI hope that I have now shown adequate cause why the two papers\nwhich follow should not be ignored off-hand on the general ground\nthat they contain a good deal of statistics and that the results which\nthey establish make h'ttle direct appeal to our higher emotions and\naspirations. It remains for me to state some positive reasons why\nthey deserve to be read with special care and attention.\nIn the first place, both sets of experiments have been conducted\nwith a degree of care and thoroughness which has probably not been\nequalled and has certainly not been surpassed in any previous work\non the subject. The writers have been at pains to exclude every\npossible kind of normal \u201c leakage \u201d. They have stated exactly what\nprecautions they took, and have given so clear and full an account\nof the conditions under which the experiments were performed that\nanyone who chooses can repeat them exactly. A critic who wishes\nto show that there was opportunity for normal leakage will have to\nindicate some specific defect in some recorded detail of the tech-\nnique ;\nhe will not be able to base his criticisms (as in many cases he\nquite justifiably can) on the negative ground that \u201c we are not told\nwhether the percipient had such and such chances of acquiring know-\nledge normally \u201d. There may have been other experiments on para-\nnormal cognition in which the conditions were in fact as rigid as\nthey were in these ;\nbut I do not think that there have been any\nin which we know them to have been so rigid as we know them to have\nbeen here.\nIt is important to notice that Mr Whately Carington has devised\na kind of experiment which ought to give positive results, if repeated,\nin a fair proportion of the repetitions. Of course something may\n\f30 Professor G. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\ndepend on the mental attitude of the agent or transmitter, but'\nthere should be no insuperable difficulty in finding suitable agents\nwho are sufficiently interested and sympathetic. To have achieved\nthis result is a real step forward. Provided that later reflexion and\ndiscussion do not reveal unforeseen sources of error, Mr Carington\nhas (probably for the first tune m the history of the subject) produced\na repeatable experiment.\nSecondly, it is most unlikely that there is any flaw in the statistical\ntechnique. Objections on this ground have been brought by certain\nstatistical pundits in America against Dr Ehine\u2019s results, though Mr\nSoal and Dr Thouless have shown that these objections are in the\nmam captious and nugatory. In the present case it is doubtful\nwhether even the most captious statistical critic can have much to\nsay. in Mr Soaks experiments the statistical problem is perfectly\nsinijile and straightforward, and it does not differ essentially from\nthat of Dr Rhine\u2019s experiments. By carefully randomising the\ncards in the way which he describes,' and by using Mr Stevens\u2019s\nformula, which allows for the actual preferences of the guessers\namong the five kinds of Zener cards, Mr Soal has obviated the only\ncriticisms on Dr Rhine\u2019s statistical assumptions which ever had any\nsubstance.\nA careless reader, on a first hasty reading, might be inclined to\nthink that Mr Whately Carington\u2019s \u201c method of palpable hits \u201d is\nopen to criticism because it makes use of the opinion of a certain\nindividual judge as to whether such and such a drawing does or\ndoes iiot resemble such and such an original enough to be counted\nas a^ palpable hit \u201d on the latter. This criticism is fallacious, as\nMr Caiington has most carefully, lucidly, and conclusively shown in\nhis pajier. I will not discuss the matter further here, because I have\ntried to explain the statistical situation by means of an analogy\nwhich Mr Carington has embodied in an appendix. It will suffice to\nsay that, if there be any statistical fallacy in Mr Whately Carington\u2019s\npaper, it has eluded, not only myself (a very feeble defence), and not\nonly Dr Thouless and Mr Gatty (who have constantly to use and to\napjiraise statistical reasoning in the course of their psychological and\nbiological work), but also Dr Irwin, who is an expert professional\nstatistician.\nA third merit of these experiments is that we know that we have\nall the results, good, bad, and mdifterent, before us. There is no\nroom for the suspicion which attaches, rightly or wrongly, to some\nlong series of experiments on para-normal cognition, viz. that the\nexperimenter began to record his results only after they began to be\nexciting, that he stopped recording them when they ceased to be so.\n\f162]\nIntroduction 31\nI\nand that he discarded results which were got when the subject was\n\u201c off-colour\n'\nThe fourth reason for attending carefully to these two sets of\nexperiments is that they led to positive results of a high degree of\n|; statistical significance. Consider, e.g., Mr AVhately Carington\u2019s\nanswer to the question whether or not his percipients tend, to a\ni\nsignificant extent, to score relatively more hits on the originals of\n1 the experiment in which they are engaged than they do on those of\n,\nexperiments in which they are not engaged. He finds, on the most\n! conservative method of scoring, that the actual deviation from the\nmost probable number of successes on the hypothesis of chance is\npositive and is 3-572 times the standard deviation. What precisely\nI does this mean? Suppose we compare the whole of Mr Carington\u2019s\n;\nmaterial in all these experiments to a single \u201c deal \u201d or \u201c throw \u201d in\nI a game of chance which is fairly played with properly constructed\napparatus. Suppose we imagine a similar set of experiments to be\ni, repeated, with the same amount of material on each occasion ;\n'\nand suppose we compare each such repetition to a new \u201c deal\n\u201d\nJ\nor \u201c throw \u201d in the same game of chance. Suppose that the positive\nresults which Mr Carington actually got were like some big chance\n.1\ndeviation from the normal in a single deal, e.g. holding 10 or more\nI,\nhearts in a fairly dealt bridge hand. Then one could not reasonably\nexpect to get so great a deviation more than once in 1000 such\nI\n\u201c deals \u201d, i.e. in 1000 repetitions of such an experiment as is here\ni' described.\nNow take, e.g., Mr Soaks figures for the successes scored by his\nsubject Mrs S. on the actual card, the one inunediately before it, and\nthe one immediately after it. The divergences of these from the\nmost probable numbers were all positive, and were respectively\n2-627, 3-309, and 4-164 times the relevant standard deviations.\nThe meaning of these statements can be interpreted as above. The\nI actual numbers concerned will be different ;\nin the first case some-\n\u2018\nwhat less than 1000, and in the third case very much more than\n1000, repetitions of the experiment would be needed before it would\nbe reasonable to expect so great a deviation. Moreover we have to\ni\ntake into account the further fact that all these large deviations are\npositive, whereas in a game of chance, they might just as well have\nbeen negative ;\nand that they are clustered about the card actually\nI\naimed at by the percipient.\ni I will now say something about the connexions and the dis-\nconnexions between the two papers. The two investigations began\nand contmued for a long time in complete independence of each\nother. Mr Soal worked for five years with Zener cards and individual\n\f32 Professor C. I). Broad, Litt.D. [part\n}\nercij^ients in London. Mr \\\\ Lately Carington has been working\nfor about a year and a lialf with drawings and groups of percipients.\nThe drawings have been exhiliited in Cambridge, the groups of per-\ncipients have been in various places. It was not until November\n1939 that the two sets of experiments converged. Mr Carington had\nfound a highly significant degree of post-cognitive and pre-cognitive\nsuccess among his subjects, and he suggested to Mr Soal that the\nlatter should look through his results and compare the guesses made\nby his subjects with the cards exposed immediately before and\nimmediately after the card at which the guess was deliberately\naimed. The remarkable outcome of this comparison, in the case of\ntwo of his subjects, forms the content of Part II of Mr Soaks paper.\nIt certainly adds to the dramatic interest of these two investigations\nthat a suggestion, based on the results of one of them, should have\nrevealed that the other had led to a highly significant positive result\nwhich would otherwise have been overlooked.\nThe following two points of difference should be noted, (i) Mr\nWhately Carington is led by his experiments to conclude that the\npower of para-normal cognition is tvidely distrtbuted but iiery iveak,\nso far as concerns the subjects whom he has tested and the tasks\nwliich he has assigned to them. Among Mr Soaks subjects, who are\nengaged in a very different kind of activity, the situation seems to be\nquite different. U hen the scores were re-investigated for signs of\npre-cognitive and ]iost-cognitive knowledge only two of his subjects\nwere found to have shown it to any appreciable extent. These two\nseem to possess it strongly ;\nand they are also outstanding, at any\nrate in their earlier scores, at guessing contemporarily exposed cards.\n(M e must not, at this stage, ignore the possibility that, if the guesses\nmade by the other siilijects were tested for successes on more\nremote cards than the three central ones, they might be found to\nhave scored significantly.) (ii) As Mr Soal has pointed out, the\nguesses wliich he has called \u201c pre-cognitive \u201d need not have been\nso in the sense of involving present knowledge of a future event.\nThe cards which will be turned up after a given guess has been\nmade already exist and are already on the table covered up by other\ncards. If the subject can clairvoyantly cognise cards which have\nnot yet been exposed in the course of the experiment but are already\nin the pack, he will be able to make guesses which are \u201c pre-\ncognitive \u201d in the sense required by Mr Soaks results. Now this is\nnot so with the pre-cognitive knowledge which appears to be\nmanifested in Mr \\\\ Lately Carington\u2019s exjieriments. This is know-\nledge of a drawing which has not yet been made, a drawing whose\nsubject has not yet been chosen.\n\fIntroduction 33\n162 ]\nIn this connexion the two following remarks are worth making,\n(i) Dr Thouless, who had done a number of experiments on guessing\nZener cards with students at Glasgow and had got entirely chance\nresults, was encouraged to look over his records for post-cognitive\nand pre-cognitive successes. He found that there was no trace in\nthem of significantly non-chance scores. This is exactly what Mr\nSoal would have found if he had not been lucky enough to include\namong his 160 subjects those two white blackbirds Mrs S. and Mr B.\nS. (ii) Mr Soal found no significant evidence for pure clairvoyance,\neither of the card at which the subject was aiming or of cards which\ncame immediately above or below it in the pack, in the experiments\nwhich were specially directed to this question. He has not as yet\nhad time to make elaborate counts for more remotely displaced\nsuccesses. Of course it is possible that Mrs S. and Mr B. S. would\nhave been exceptions, for in fact they tried only undifferentiated\nextra-sensory perception. If we suppose that they would have\nfailed at pure clairvoyance, as did all the subjects who tried it,\nwe shall have to hold that their pre-cognitive successes really did\ninvolve foreseeing what the agent was going to see when he after-\nwards turned up the next card, and that they did not just clair-\nvoyantly perceive that card while it was still lying covered on the\ntable. In that case their pre-cognitive results would be in line with\nthose of Mr Whately Carington\u2019s subjects.\n\fEXPERIMENTS ON THE PARANORMAL COGNITION\nOF DRAAVINGS\nI.

I to IV B) have\nbeen carried out, using simple drawings as test material. About\n250 percipients took part. In no case was any percipient in the same\nroom with the drawing he was required to reproduce, and careful\nprecautions were taken to prevent knowledge being obtained by\nsensory means or by rational inference. Marking was done by an\nindependent judge, who was not given sufficient information to\nenable him to produce a spurious positive result.\nIt was found that percipients tended, to a highly significant extent,\nto score relatively more \u2018\nhits \u2019\non the drawings (originals) used in\ntheir own experiment than on those used in other experiments.\nIt was also found that hits were not by any means always scored\non the occasions on which the originals to which they referred were\ndisplayed, but tended to be displaced to an earlier or later occasion.\nBoth these tendencies appear to be significant, indicating the\noccurrence of precognitive and retrocognitive effects.\nA control scoring of the same drawings against a set of randomised\n\u2018\ndummy \u2019\noriginals gave nuU results.\nSECTION I\nIntroductory\n1 . Genesis of the Experiments : The experiments described below\narose almost inevitably oiit of my re-examination of various earlier\nresearches, which I described in a Paper read to the Society in\nJune 1938, and was summarised in the Journal for December of that\nyear. These studies convinced me that, despite the machinations\nof the malevolent hoodoo which apparently dominates the subject,\nthe case for supposing that significant and genuine positive results\nhad been obtained in the past from experiments of this kind was very\nstrong. On the other hand, there seemed to be a general rule that\nthe more carefully experiments were carried out, the less \u2018\nsuccessfid\n\u2019\nthey were likely to be. Still, if the main conclusion were correct,\nthere should be no reason inherent in the nature of the phenomena\nwhy, given a modicum of good fortune, results satisfying the\nnecessary criteria should not be obtained again.\nI accordingly decided to undertake as soon as practicable a new\nseries of experiments which shoidd at least be free from the weak-\nnesses noted by myself and others in earlier work, and to press the\nattack home to a point at which it would be possible to give a\ndefinite answer one way or the other.\n35\n\f36 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\n2. Objects ofthe Exj?ennmits and Choice of Technique : There are four\ncriteria to which any successful experiment in this field must conform\nIn approximate order of importance these are; (1) The conditions\nmust be rigid (2) The scoring must be unbiassed, (3) The results must\nbe statistically significant, (\n4) The experiment must be repeatable ^\nIn all cases the general situation is essentially the same. That is\nto say, someone or other is required to display knowledge of some\nobject or event, which he could not have obtained by normal sensory\nmeans or by rational inference from normally perceived facts ;\nthe\naccuracy or frequency of the knowledge is then assessed by some\nmethod of marking, scoring, judging or the like ;\nand finally an\nestimate is made, l>y one means or another, of whether the extent\nof the knowledge shown is greater than can reasonably be attributed\nto chance or luck.\nIt IS evident that if the knowledge displayed could, by any\nreasonable stretch of imagination, have been obtained by the normal\nprocesses of perception and inference, the experiment has been just\nso much waste of time, at least so far as establishing the reality of\nthe phenomena is concerned ;\nfor those who are unwilling to accept\nthem wil not unnaturally, maintain that a known cause, even if\n^ unlikely, is to be preferred to an unknown. And it is\nc iftcult to say at what point this attitude becomes unreasonable.\nimilarly, if the process of assessment is in any way subject to the\nprepossessions of the assessor, the results, though not necessarily\ninvalid, are bound to be suspect ; indeed, a very conscientious\nJ\n_\nge might well bias the outcome against his own views, just as a\nishtul enthusiast might bias it in favour of them. It is in fact\nessential that the judge should be as incapable of influencing the\noutcome in either direction, however strong his prejudices, as the\npercipients ot obtaining knowledge of the material by normal ineans.^\nonseqiiently, although it would be an overstatement to say that\nwatertightness of conditions was the primary object of the experi-\nments, It was certainly my chief preoccupation, in the sense that\nI was complete y determined from the start that, whatever else\nmight happen, there should be no room for argument as to whether\n1 It might well be argued that, since the repeatable experiment is the very\nfoundation of science, the last criterion is the most important of all \u2022\nbut the\nSisfied\ndoes not arise till the other criteria have been\nsatisfied, so I make no excuse for putting it last.\ninl?rcieT^-'\u2019L1?isTff\u2019\nnecessarily possible of attainment\nin all cases tor it is often possible for a judge to \u2018\nsabotage \u2019\nan experiment\nhL \"\"^i\nof. irrationality. Such extremes need not be considered\nhere ; for the remedy is simple-discard the judge-while, under a nroner\nprocedure it is never possible for a judge to generate a falsely significant Effect.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Di\u2019awings 37\nthe percipients could have obtained by normal means any knowledge\nof the material they might display. It has all too often happened\nthat someone has carried out experiments with an enthusiasm and\ndiligence amounting to devotion, and has obtained results which he\nreasonably believed to be convincing, only to have some critic point\nout that there might have been a leakage of information through\nsome normal, if unlikely, channel which he had omitted to block.\nI viewed with great distaste the prospect of having months of work\nnullified in some such way as this, and with not less the alternative\nof being dragged into interminable and inconclusive arguments as to\nwhether the observed results might or might not be due to involun-\ntary whispering, olfactory h}TDeraesthesia, the subconscious inter-\npretation of subaudible pencil scratchings, the purloining of cards\nby corrupted housemaids, and all the rest of it.\nI accordingly laid it down as a first principle that, until after\na percipient had done his work and had duly handed in his efforts,\nhe should in no case be in the same room with the material he was\nrequired to \u2018 guess \u2019. In the experiments here discussed this\ncondition has been rigidly adhered to throughout. With the\nexception of the second experiment, q.v., no percipient, to the best\nof my knowledge and belief, has so much as been in the same building\nduring the preparation or use of any of the material ;\nand even in\nthe \u2018\nIndividual Experiments which are not discussed here but\nmay be reported later, percipients never entered the experimenter\u2019s\nroom, or even that adjoining it, until after the experiment was over.\nI was well aware that, in insisting on this extreme rigidity of\nconditions, I should, in the opinion of some students, be running\nthe risk of inhibiting altogether the effects I was interested in\nestablishing. But against this two considerations weighed. In\nthe first place, the whole contextual evidence of the sul^ject suggests\nthat such factors as distance and brick walls are no impediment to\nthe occurrence of the phenomena in question, if they are going to\noccur at all ;\nin the second, I think I would much prefer to do a\nnull-resulting experiment under rigid conditions than one which\nyielded exciting results under conditions which were sloppy\u2014one\nwould not merely have the satisfaction of knowing that one had\ndone the job properly, but might fairly hope to be spared the\nindignities of controversial disputation.\nHaving settled this point, two further decisions had to be made,\nnamely as to the type of percipient and the kind of material to be used.\nAs regards the first, beggars cannot be choosers ;\nbut there is\nalways the question of whether to attempt to find and concentrate\non a few specially gifted performers, or to rely on the \u2018\nrandom\n\f38 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nlikely to be met with in the course of mass exireriments.\nIhe first plan has obvious labour-saving potentialities and may well\nprove the best when it comes to examining the effect of particular\nchanges of conditions, etc., after the reality of the phenomena has\nbeen established, always assuming that specially gifted performers\nexist ,\nbut at the present stage, when that reality is still gravely in\nquestion, I have no doubt at all that the second is not only preferable\n)ut almost obligatory. Certainly from the point of view of repeat-\nability there can be no two opinions about it ;\nfor history indicates\nthat so soon as an investigator has obtained magnificently successful\nresults from some specially gifted sensitive, she either developes\nmoral scruples or some similarly fell disease, or \u2018\ndisappears into the\nMiddle W est \u2019, or gets married, or just loses her powers, and we are\neft to sjieculate as to whether the results were genuine or whether,\nafter all, the experimenter had left some loophole unguarded. It\nt erefore seemed to me that, if I could get significant results from\ninore or less randomly selected people under rigid conditions, I should\nlie putting the phenomena on a very much wider and firmer basis\nthan by obtaining perhaps more spectacular performances from one\nor two special sensitives who might easily become inaccessible for\nfuture work. It will be seen from what follows that at the time of\nwriting (Dec., 1939) about 250 different percipients have taken part\nm the experiments, none of them having, so far as I am aware, any\nspecial antecedent claims to being abnormally \u2018\npsychic \u2019.\nAs regards the second question, the decision is not so easy to\nmake. Broadly, the choice is between \u2018\nrestricted \u2019\nand \u2018\nfree\n\u2019\ntypes of material. In the first case the percipient knows in advance\nthat the object he is required to \u2018\nguess \u2019\nwill be one of a limited\nrange such as a two figure number, or a card from a particular sort\nof pack m the second, the problem is more in the nature of \u2018\nWhat? \u2019\nt an of A\\hich? ,\nfor he may be asked to record his impressions of\nwhat IS in the experimenter\u2019s mind, or what is the subject matter of\na book or a drawing, which leaves a field of almost boundless extent\nopen to him.\nIt goes without saying that the restricted type of material is, on\nthe face of it, very much the easier to deal with from the point of\nview of assessment ;\nin fact relatively few attempts have been made\nto treat free material m a quantitative manner at all.i But this seems\nto be 111 reality something of a delusion, for the method of assessment\ndescribed below appears to be, in some respects, actually easier to ap-\n])fy tlian the very error-liable scoring of successes with cards or the like.\n1 But see such contributions as J. G. Pratt, Jour. Paravsu. I,\n[\u2022\nSaltraarsh and Soal, Proc. S.P.R., XXXIX, p. 260 seq.\n4, p. 248 seq..\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 39\nAs a matter of fact, my first intention was to use standard 5x5\npacks of Zener cards. I had the idea of placing ten such shuffled\npacks face downwards on some suitable shelf in my study every\nevening, asking my percipients, working in their own homes, to\nguess all ten \u2018\ndown through \u2019\nfor, say, ten successive evenings in\neach case, and to go on doing this until either a statistically signi-\nficant overall result emerged or we all gave up in despair.\nFortunately, however, it was strongly represented to me (as,\nindeed, I had realised for myself ) that this would be a procedure\nsingularly lacking in human interest\u2014in fact, about as tedious as\ncould be devised ;\nwhereas it is not unreasonable to suppose that,\nif such phenomena occur at all, they may well be to some consider-\nable extent influenced by the degree of interest, emotion or the like\nassociated with the material used. I was accordingly very ready\nto adopt the view that it would be better to use a type of material a\ntrifle livelier than the somewhat arid austerity of Dr Zener\u2019s\nsymbols.\nThe use of drawings in one form or another at once suggested\nitself, partly on account of the considerable degree of success which,\nby inspection and assuming conditions to have been as rigid as\ndescribed, appears to have attended many attempts on these linesd\npartly because I felt that, in any event, a good deal more fun would\nbe had by all than with the dreary task of guessing and scoring\ncards ;\nwhile, if the worst were to come to the very worst, I should\nat least salvage from failure a good collection of free drawings which\ncould hardly fail to be of some general psychological interest.\nMoreover, this sort of material promised to allow subjects a degree\nof latitude impossible with the restricted type, and this might, it\nseemed to me, prove of decisive importance in enabling any real\neffect there might be to show itself. It might well happen, I\nreflected, that, with many people if not with all, an impression might\nhave difficulty in reaching consciousness in its original and un-\ndistorted form but might readily appear in a disguised or symbohc\nshape. If this were so, it would presumably lead to null results\nin the case of cards, particularly perhaps Zener cards with which\nguesses cannot be partially right, whereas with drawings some\nelement might be recognisable, or the reproduction might represent\nsomething more or less closely associated with the original ;\nthus,\ngiven a method of assessment which could take account of such\nmodifications without abandoning impartiality, it might be possible\nto detect genuine cognitions which would otherwise escape\nnotice.\n^ E.g. jVIr and IVIrs Upton Sinclair, Warcollier, and others.\n\f40 Whately Garington, M.A., M.8c. [pabt\nFinally,\nthe decision to insist on the utmost severity of conditions\nas regards the possibility of \u2018\nleakage by not having the percipients\non the premises at all, in most cases, enabled me to introduce what\nI believe may have been a valuable relaxation by allowing them to\nmake their attempts in the familiar surroundings of their own\nhomes, instead of coming to a laboratory or to a stranger\u2019s house,\nand to do so, within fairly wide limits, whenever they felt most\ninclined.\nThus the final plan, which was followed in all experiments except\nthe second {q.v.), may be summarised as follows :\nEach experiment lasted ten nights ;\non each night a fresh drawing,\nmade by either myself or my wife, was put up at 7.0 p.m. in my\nsuitably curtained, etc., study, and left there till 9.30 a.ni. the next\nmorning ;\nthe subjects of the drawings were determined immediately\nliefore their production by a substantially random method ;\nthe\npercipients were allowed to make their attempts at \u2018\nreproduction\n\u2019\nwherever they happened to be and at any convenient time within\nthe indicated limits.\nThis procedure, which appears to combine the maximum of\nfreedom for the percipient with the utmost rigidity of experimental\nconditions has yielded results which I cannot regard as other than\nextremely satisfactory.\n3. Arrangement of Discussion : In dealing with these experiments,\nI shall first give, in the next main Section, a detailed account of the\nexperimental procedure with especial reference to the precautions\ntaken to ensure that no knowledge of the drawings could be ob-\ntained by normal means. In Section III, I shall discuss the question\nof assessment generally, and shall describe the three methods, of\nwhich the first two were abandoned after trial, which were actually\nused. In Section IV, I shall first present the results of the Main\nCalculations, by which the success or otherwise of the experiments\nmust be chiefly judged ;\nand shall then go on to discuss such other\npoints of interest and importance as have been investigated at the\ntime of writing (Dec. 1939). In Section V, I shall give some account\nof a kind of dummy experiment intended to serve as a control of\nthe outcome of the experiments proper. Next, I propose to try to\nsave time and trouble all round by anticipating some of the more\nobvious criticisms ;\nand I shall conclude by discussing in a tentative\nmanner the conclusions which it seems legitimate to draw from the\nresults so far obtained.\n4. Two categorical Statements : Remembering how often I have\nbeen distressed by the omission of other workers to give essential\nfacts, and the allegations of improper selection that have not\n\f62] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 41\ninfrequently been made against them, I wish to make the two\ncategorical affirmations following ;\nA. The whole of the work of all the percipients who took part\nin Experiments I to IV B here discussed has been included, except\n(a) two sets eliminated by Dr Thouless from Expt. I because they\ncontained clues which might have been helpful to the judge, and\n(b) the masterpieces of two persons who sent in ten completely blank\nsheets each in Expt. IV. As none of my original drawings was\nintended to represent the Bellman\u2019s Chart, I had no scruples about\nconsigning these, unhonoured and unsung, to my wastepaper\nbasket. The Private Experiments, not reported here, consisted of\neight ten-drawing tests, each conducted in a single evening, with\nfive percipients selected on account of their success in one or other\nof the main experiments. My wife (six times) and I (twice) also\nacted as percipients in these, as a matter of interest, and the results\nwill be discussed in due course. In addition, a fortuitous visitor\nwas on one occasion invited to participate ; but his results will not\nbe counted. Thus we have a maximum of 170 drawings not here\ndiscussed, as compared with 2,193 which are. This is a negligible\nproportion anyway ;\nbut as a matter of fact, the 170 are, by\ninspection,^ quite up to the general standard, if not better.\nB. To the best of my knowledge and belief (and, as will be seen,\nit would be very strange if I were in error) only two persons other\nthan my wife and myself have ever entered my study while an\noriginal drawing was displayed. One was the occupant of the\nflat below ;\nhe was present for only a few seconds and declares\n(I have no doubt correctly) that he did not notice the drawing at all.\nThe other was the lady who attends to our domestic needs ;\nshe, on\ntwo occasions during Expt. IV, came into the room before I had\ntaken the drawing down in the morning. It is not, of course,\nmathematically excluded from possibility that she may represent\nan extensive system of espionage, and some people would have us\nbeheve scarcely less fantastic propositions ;\nbut I do not think the\nsuggestion need be taken very seriously.\n5. Acknoioledgements : The reader will soon see for himself how\ndeep and extensive is my indebtedness to others. I believe that I\nhave duly acknowledged (in the appropriate passages of the text)\nthe many particular acts of help received ;\nif anywhere I have\ninadvertently omitted to do so, I can only extend here my regretful\napologies to whoever may have been so neglected.\nBut in addition to these specific acknowledgements, I must\n1\n1.e. without applying formal tests of significance. The words \u2018\nby ui-\nspection \u2019\nare used in this sense throughout.\nc\n\f42 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [PART^\nexpress my more general though not less sincere gratitude to the|\nmembers of the Cambridge Committee, Professor Broad, Dr Thouless'\nand Mr Oliver Gatty, who have aided, abetted and supervised my\nlal)ours ;\nto the first named in particular I am especially indebted,\nnot merely for the several long and tedious tasks he has undertaken,\nbut for much personal as well as ofhcial encouragement and support.\nI am also very deeply obliged to Dr J. 0. Irwin, who kindly con-\nsented to join the Committee in October, 1939, for invaluable\nguidance and help, which it has been impossilde adequately to\nacknowledge in the text, in the matter of statistical treatment. I\nam also much indebted to Dr E. J. Dingwall, not only for constant\nand stimulating criticism, but for moral support and practical help\nat many stages of the work. To Mr M. T. Hindson, whose per-\nspicacious judging has been a factor of prime inq^ortance in the\nsuccess of the work, I must pay a very special tribute, and similar\nacknowledgements are due to Mr H. F. Saltmarsh, who undertook\nthe equally laborious task of \u2018\ncontrol marking \u2019.\nLast, but scarcely least, my thanks are due to the percipients,\nwitliout whose disinterested co-operation nothing could have been\ndone at all. Theirs has been the somewhat thankless task of doing\na not very interesting job for the benefit of someone whom they\nusually had never so much as heard of, and without even having,\nin most cases, the trifling satisfaction of knowing what degree of\nsuccess had attended their efforts. 1 hope that any of them who\nmay read this wall realise that it has been quite impracticable to\nrender individual reports, or evezi thanks, except in a very few special\ncases, but that their good offices have been none the less appreciated.\nSECTION II\nExperimental Procedure\nPreliminary : I have found it a good deal more difficult to write\nthis Section in anything like a coherent form than might be expected.\nIt is of course easy enough to describe factually what I did, and\nwhat precautions I took to avoid this pitfall or that ;\nbut it is not\nnearly so easy to make clear why I did it, without entering upon\na variety of clipessions which are now irrelevant and out of date.\nThe trouble is that, in order to keep things moving at a reasonable\nspeed, it has usually been necessary to plan experiments in advance\nbefore the outcome of those already performed was fully known or\nadequately digested. If I had not done this, which involved a\ncertain amount of would-be intelligent anticipation, I should pro-\n\f162] Exjiervments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 43\nbably still be trying to squeeze the last drop of juice from Expt. I,\nand still not quite sure that there was any juice to squeeze.\nOn the other hand, the procedure had the drawback that probably\nno experiment would have been planned quite as I did plan it, if I\nhad known at the time what I knew later. Consequently, although\ncertain features, notably that of preserving completely watertight\nconditions, are common to all, the policy behind them has had to be\nto some extent modified as the work progressed and as the nature of\nwhat appeared to be happening was more fully appreciated.\nIn particular, I originally intended to assess my results by the\nmethod of matching the drawings made by the percipients in any\nexperiment against the originals used in that experiment. This\nmethod, which is discussed at some length below, is based on the\nassumption that if a percipient, as the result of a \u2018 ])aranormal\n\u2019\ncognitive process obtains a correct impression of an original which\nhe cannot see, he will do so (or at least is most likely to do so) on the\nsame occasion as that on which the said original is displayed. This\nassumption is now known to be untrue, at any rate so far as the\nmaterial and percipients involved in these experiments are con-\ncerned ;\nbut realisation of this was delayed by the fact that the first\nten sets of drawings examined were exceptional in showing a signi-\nficant positive result ^ when this method was used. Naturally\nenough, therefore, the second and third ex])eriments were designed\nprimarily with a view to continuing with this technique ;\nand Imth\nparts of the fourth were arranged so as to permit of it, though the\nexperiment as a whole was intended to be based on a comparison\nbetween the two parts, each taken en bloc, rather than on the\nmatching of drawings against originals within the parts.\nIn these circumstances, I have decided that the best plan will be\nas follows : In the present section I shall describe the experiments,\nmainly from the point of view of procedure and precautions against\nleakage, adding only a few notes on the outcome by way of a kind\nof running commentary. In Section III I shall deal with the three\nmethods of assessment which were tried out at different stages,\ngiving fairly full results for the first two, as a matter of interest.\nOnly after this shall I embark on a discussion of the results obtained\nby the third method, which alone are submitted as positive evidence\nfor the occurrence of paranormal cognition.\nExperiment I ; 1, General\n:\nSo far as the points of procedure and\ntechnique here considered are concerned, this first experiment is so\nmuch the prototype of all others except the second that it will be\nnecessary and sufficient to describe it in detail, indicating only where\n^ Cf. |). 72 Ijelow.\n\f44 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nnecessary the details in which Expts. Ill, IV A and IV B differ\nfrom it.\nThe general procedure has already been outlined and may be\nsummarised as follows :\nOn each of ten successive evenings, beginning on that of Feb. 1st,\n1939, a different simple drawing, made by either my wife or myself,\nwas exposed at 7.0 p.m. in my study (suitably curtained and\nguarded) at 5 Idtzwilliam Road, Cambridge, and was left in position\ntill 9.30 a.m. the next morning. Percipients were asked to draw, in\nbooks provided for the purpose and at any time within the period\nof exposure convenient to themselves, the best \u2018\nreproduction \u2019\nthey\ncould manage of what they thought each drawing represented, or\n(which probably came to much the same thing) whatever came into\ntheir minds when they made the attempts.\nInasmuch as it was at this time intended to assess the degree\nof success achieved by the method of Forced Matching^ it was\nvitally important that the judge, in this case myself, should have\nno normal knowledge of which drawing by any percipient was\nintended to represent which original. Accordingly, the books were\nhantled in by the percipients at the end of the experimental period\nto Dr Thouless, who detached the sheets from them, assigned to each\nsheet a suitable code \u2019\nnumber, and shutHed them before passing\nthem to me.\nIhe results of the matching, which started by appearing very\npromising Imt ended by giving no significant result, will be discussed\nin the next Section. At present we are concerned only with those\npoints of experimental technique which are of fundamental import-\nance irrespective of what method of assessing the results is finally\nused. The following details should be carefully noted and should\nserve to make all clear.\n2. Percipients Books and Instructions : Each percipient was\njirovided with a specially printed book consisting of a cover and ten\njiages measuring 13\" by about 8|\". These pages were perforated\nabout ;l from the left margin, so that when they were torn off at\nthe ]ierforation they were just foolscap size, viz. 13\" x 8\". Suitable\nspaces were provided at the top of each sheet for the percipient\u2019s\nname, the hour of making the attemjff., the code number to be\ninserted by Dr Thouless, and for notes by the percipient as to his\ndegree of confidence and the occurrence of visual imagery. Another\nspace for general notes and impressions was ruled off at the bottom,\nleaving an area of about 7\" x 8\" for the actual drawing. The\nordinal number of each sheet was printed on it to the left of the\n^ Cf. Section III, 2.\n\f162] Experimenfs on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 45\nI\nperforations. Full instructions for the percipient were printed on\n( the cover ;\nthese are reproduced in Appendix I. To guard against\n1 the possibility that some percipients might press so heavily on the\npaper as to indent the sheet below, and thus give some clue to the\n:\norder in which the attempts were made which would vitiate the\n\u00bb\nprocess of matching, a sheet of stiff card, about -5 mm. thick, was\nprovided with each book, and percipients were instructed to insert\nthis between the sheet they were using and the next. No such\nindentations were in fact noticed, but I think the precaution was\nworth taking.\n3. Photograph of the \u2018\nsetting \u2019 ; In order to give the percipients\nI some idea of the setting of the experiment, and to form some kind\nof a link between them and the location of the drawing to be repro-\nduced, photographs were also distributed showing the relevant parts\nof my study with a blank sheet of paper pinned in the position to\nbe occupied by the drawings in the course of the experiment. I am\nmuch indebted to my friend Mrs Ramsey, of Ramsey and Muspratt,\nfor the trouble she took in this matter. In the later experiments it\n^\nwas not always possible, owing to irregularities of supply, to ensure\nthat every percipient had a photograph to himself ;\nbut most had,\nand I think there were very few, if any, who had no opportunity of\nlooking at one.\n4. Percipients : A total of 37 percipients took part in this experi-\nment, and the number was made up as follows :\n(a) The bulk of the group was formed by 27 students from Dr\nThouless\u2019s lecture class, all of whom were training for the teaching\n.\nprofession. Of these 19 were women and 8 were men, and their\nages ranged from about 22 to 25, though no exact data were sought\n;\nthe other participants were appreciably older than this.\nI am particularly obliged to Dr Thouless for setting the ball\n'\nrolling by obtaining the co-operation of these percipients, as well as\nfor undertaking the work of randomisation already mentioned.\n(b) The S.P.R. was represented by Mr and Mrs Salter, Dr and\nMrs Thouless, Mr and Mrs Tyrrell, Professor Broad, and Dr E. J.\nDingwall.\n(c) In addition, two ladies resident in Cambridge, friends of my\nown, were induced to take part.\n5. Production of the Originals : To determine the subject matter\nof each drawing I opened a copy of Chambers\u2019s Mathematical\nTables at random, noted the last digits of the first three or four\nentries encountered,^ turned to the corresponding page of Webster\u2019s\n^ \u2018\nThree or four \u2019\nbecause the terminal digits of the first four entries met\nwith might form a number greater than the number of pages in Webster.\n\f46 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [PARTii\nDictionary, and took as the subject for the drawing the first reason-\nably drawable word found on or after that page.\nTliis method was by no means perfect ;\nin particular, it led to >\nthe use of certain originals which I later came to regard as unsuitable\nfor the purpose, on account of their vagueness or unfaniiliarity.\nBut it served the purpose for which it was intended, namely that\nof ensuring that no percipient could possibly forecast by rational\nmeans wliat the nature of the drawing would be, and of guarding\nagainst the effects of possible coincidental thinking prompted by\ncontemporary events.\nIn general, the drawings were made between 6.30 p.m. and 7.0\np.m. on the evening each was to be used ;\nbut on one occasion\n(Feb. 9, 1939) the necessary absence of both my wife and myself ^\nduring the afternoon and evening led to the drawing being prepared\nat about 1.30 p.m. The room was, of course, carefully curtained\nand locked (see below) from that time onward.\n6.\nNature of the Originals : The pages in Webster found by the\nabove described procedure and the words selected for illustration,\ntogether with notes on the choosing, are given below :\n1. p. 323 :\n\u2018\nBracken sickness \u2019\nwas rejected, a Bracket,\nillustrated in the dictionary, was drawn.\n2. p. 2886 : The first word on the page is Water Ox or Water\nBuffalo ;\na picture of a horned bovine animal (not conspicuously\nof the genus Bnhalus) was drawn and labelled Buffallo (stc).\n3. p. 385 : Various words such as Embalm, Embank, Embark,\nEmbarrass and Embassy were rejected, and an illustration of an\nEmbattled Fess (heraldic) was clrawn.\n4. p. 1496 ; A considerable number of words such as Maniac,\nand others beginning with Mani- were rejected ;\nbut Manicure\nsuggested hands, and a left Hand was drawn with fingers sjrread.\n5. p. 632 : A great number of compound words beginning with\nCross was passed over, and an illustration of Cross Stitch was\ncopied.\n6. p. 2811 : Vacillator, vacillatory, vacoa, and a number of words\nbeginning with Vacu- were rejected ;\nthe illustration given of a\nVacuum Bottle was judged too complicated for the purpose, and an\nordinary Bottle was drawn, with a label marked Vino, by way\nof preserving the V.\n7. p. 969 : Elite (Miss) and various words in Flit- were passed over.\nFlittermouse was illustrated by a Bat with outstretched wings.\n8. p. 1644 ; The first word was Net Blotch. H.S.C. decided to\nillustrate a Net and, to make it more interesting, drew a sketch of\na man pulling a net with fish in it out of water.\n^ Hereinafter referred to as H.S.C. and W.W.C., respectively, when con-\nvenient.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 47\n(This subsequently proved to be a somewhat unfortunate\noriginal, for opinion was considerably divided as to whether the\nman, the fish, the waves, the net or the beach should be regarded\nas the principal feature.)\n9. p. 1519 : Two earlier pages were rejected as providing nothing\nsuitable. On this page, the illustration of a Meal Moth was\nrejected as being too like the Bat already drawn, and finally an\nillustration of a Meal Worm Beetle was approximately copied.\n10. p. 97 : The word Anghok was the first suitable for representa-\ntion, and a picture of an Anchor was drawn.\nThe drawings illustrating these words were drawn by W.W.C.\nand H.S.C. alternately, the former starting with No._ 1. They were\ndone on sheets of white paper substantially identical ^with those\nissued to the percipients and were of a size to fill the 7\" x 8 ' space\nmore or less completely. All except the last were line drawings m\nIndian ink made with a broad nib ;\nin the case of the Anchor, the\nouthnes were filled in with ink, thus producing the effect of a\nsilhouette 'with shaft and limbs about 10 mm. broad.\n^\nWhatever objections may be made either to the objects finally\nselected or to the method of selecting them, and I have already said\nthat I do not consider either to have been ideal, I trust that all wall\nagree that there was no possible means whereby the percipients\ncould possibly have inferred what the originals were, or even what\nclass of object they were most likely to represent. This is all that\nmatters from the evidential point of view,\nand such questions as\nwhether the process of selection was truly random\n^\nin a strict\nmathematical sense are irrelevant from tliis point of view.\nPersonally, I do not now consider the method to be a very good\none. I think it would be much better to use an artificial dictionary\nconsisting of words specially picked for their suitability, and to\napply, perhaps, a more convenient and more truly random method\nin selecting from it. In Expt. VI, for example, which will be reported\nlater, I have used a list of 216 \u2018\nsuitable \u2019\nwords, arranged m six\nblocks, six rows and six columns, so tliat selection can be made y\nthrowing three dice.\nAs regards \u2018\nsuitability \u2019\n: Speaking quite provisionally and from\ninspection only, I am now fairly sure that there is usually no\nquestion at all of percipients in any sense copying the original ,\nand\nit seems as if it is the \u2018\nidea \u2019\nrather than the form of the drawing\nthat is cognised\u2014though admittedly the word \u2018\nidea \u2019\nis unpleasantly\nvague, ff this is so, then the first criterion of suitability is that the\nidea should be reasonably familiar, for otherwise it will not be\nrecognised and cannot be reproduced ;\nwhile the second, I thii\nis that it should be unambiguous. But this is a digression.\n\f48 Whately Carington, M.A., 31. Sc. [part\n7. Location, etc., of the Originals\n:\nThe room in which the originals ^\nwere exposed is a kind of stndy-hed-sitting-room on the first floor\nof a lionse looking south over a relatively unfrequented road. There\nare no houses immediately opposite, and the nearest that could be\nsaid to \u2018\noverlook \u2019\nthe room is at a distance of, I suppose, about\nhalf a mile. In addition to the ordinary defences of the house, the\nouter door of which is always locked in winter, a Yale type lock was\nspecially fitted to the door of the study at the beginning of the\nexperimental period, and the keys did not leave the possession of\nmy wife and myself. The precaution was highly supererogatory,\nbut I made a practice of always locking the door whenever I left\nthe room for more than a very few minutes, and even after retiring\nfor the night. The chance of anyone making an unauthorised entry\nduring any period of exposure may be regarded as completely\nnegligible.\nllie curtains with which the room is normally provided are\nsufliciently opaque, as I have tested by careful observation, to\nprevent anyone seeing from the road outside so much as whether\nthere is a sheet of paper in the position where the originals were\nplaced\u2014 let alone distinguishing any design there might be on it.\nAs a further precaution, however, an additional thickness of fairly\nheavy rep was drawing-pinned over the lower half of the window,\nthrough which alone a glimpse of the drawing might be supposed\nto be obtained, during the exposure periods. This was always put\nin position, and the ordinary curtains drawn and secured over it,\nbefore the original was displayed.\nEach original was pinned in turn to tlie centre of the top shelf of\na bookcase which stood against the wall to the west of the window ;\nthis brought the upper edge of the paper to a height of about 5' 8\"\nabove the floor. The room was not prepared in any way, except by\ntaking down two or three portraits from the wall near the bookcase\nand removing (subject to the one exception noted below) a calendar\nwhich normally hung just below the position selected. ^ The\nportraits were not removed for the later experiments, though the\ncalendar was.\nIn the case of this experiment only, intending percipients from\nDr Thouless\u2019 class were invited to visit the room before the experi-\nment started ;\nbut only two did so.\nIt is not uninteresting to note that on one occasion I rehung this calendar\nfor reference during the day and inadvertently omitted to remove it in the\nevening. On the night in question, and on no other, an excellent picture of\na calendar of the same general type and proportions as mine was drawn by\none of the percipients.\n\f162]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 49\nAt the end of each exposure period, namely at 9.30 a.m. on the\nmorning after exposure, or a little later, I was careful to remove the\ndrawing and lock it away in a steel box before any \u2018\noutsider \u2019\nhad\naccess to the room or the curtains were drawn back. With the\ntrivial exceptions noted in the Introduction above, I can say with\ncomplete confidence that no one except my wife and myself saw, or\ncould have seen, any of the originals during the course of the experi-\nment or before the great bulk of the books had been received by Dr\nThouless.i\nFinally it may be just worth noting that the lights were not left on\nin the study if no one was in it.\nI need hardly say that both my wife and I were scrupulously\ncareful not to mention or hint at the nature of the originals to anyone\nat all during the course of the experiment, or to make any remark\nthat mi ght give a clue to their nature. This was easy enough, for\nwe were not at that time acquainted with any of Dr Thouless\nstudents, while our contacts with the other percipients were very\nslight.\n8. Concentration, etc. : No special effort was made by us to\n\u2018\nconcentrate \u2019\non the originals during exposure, nor were any\ninstructions to this effect given to the percipients. But the original\nfor each evening woifid naturally be more or less in the minds of my\nwife and myself, while the position selected ensured that I at least\nwould be fairly often reminded of it.\nWhile on this topic, I may record the wholly provisional and\npersonal impression that attempts at \u2018\nconcentration \u2019\nby percipients\nare likely to do more harm than good, except in so far as they denote\nno more than trying to free the mind from thoughts of which the\norigin can be identified. In the fourth experiment, for example,\nmore than one percipient reported in such terms as Complete\nblank, even after fifteen minutes Intense Concentration .\n9. Results : As I have already indicated, and shall be obliged to\nemphasise almost ad nauseam later, significant positive results have\nonly been obtained by inter- as opposed to intra-experiment com-\nparisons. These will be fully described and discussed in due course,\nwhile some account of the results of the matching technique will be\ngiven in the next Section. There is accordingly not very much to\nbe said here, particularly as we cannot say whether an experiment\n^\nThe slight reservation implied in the last sentence is necessitated by the\nfact that three sets of drawings came in very late, and a few people, not in\ntouch with the percipients concerned so far as I am aware, were shown the\noriginals before these sets arrived. I mention the point only for the sake of\nmeticulousness, for it certainly has no bearing on the results.\n\f50 Whafely Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nof this tyj3e is successful or not, taken as a whole, until we have j\nsomething to compare it with. But a few first impressions may be\n'\nworth recording, if only as a matter of historical interest.\nSpeaking personally, I shall not easily forget the thrill I received\nwhen I opened the very first set of the first batch of randomised\ndrawings passed to me by Dr Thouless and found a fine sketch of a\nHand (Original No. 4) l)acked up by an unmistakeable Fisherman ,\nand a kind of slender Jug, which were pretty good shots, in the\ncircumstances, at Net and Bottle respectively ;\nand the next set\ncontained a iDattlemented archway, which was by no means bad for\nEmbattled Fess. Nor were these mere isolated examples, for\nthroughout the 37 sets of the experiment H.S.C. and I kept on\nfinding unmistakeable \u2018\nwinners \u2019\nof one kind and another, which\nsoon made us feel that there was something going on which \u2018\nmere\nchance \u2019\nwoxdd be unlikely to account for. Of coiirse we knew very\nwell that these impressions were purely subjective, quite likely to\nbe due to wishful thinking, and in no sense evidential. It was only\na matter of personal judgement that made us think it unlilcely that\npeople would have drawn as many Hands, Cows (for Buffalo) and\nso forth as we found, if there had l^een no Hand or Buffalo among\nthe originals ;\nbut it is perhaps just worth recording the fact that\nour immediate reaction to the drawings, before we in any way\n\u2018\nknew the answer \u2019, was that the experiment had been very definitely\na success.^ This feeling was confirmed and enhanced when we\nlearned the result of our matching of the first ten sets ;\nit dwindled\nto little more than a conviction based on a belief in the soundness\nof our own judgement as that result was gradually whittled away to\nnullity l:iy the outcome of subsequent matchings ;\nbut it has been\nmore than justified l)y the application of the method of \u2018\npalpable\nhits \u2019\nand inter-experiment comparison.\nExperiment H ; 1, General\n:\nAt a very early stage of the\ninvestigation it liad been suggested that percipients might be able to\nmatch their drawings for themselves against the originals they were\nintended to represent, or which had in some measure influenced\ntheir production, a good deal better than any outsider could do.\nThis seemed reasonable enough, for it might very well happen that\nthe person who produced the drawing might recognise some element\nin the original which had formed part of his inqires.sion, but had been\nimpertectly portrayed ;\nor he might have personal associations,\nunknown to the exjierimenter, which would lead him to connect one\nof his drawings with an original in a way which no one else could do.\nAt this stage, it will be understood, we had no information as to which\ndrawing of any set was intended for which original.\n\f162] Experiments on Pamnor)nal Cognition of Drawings 51\nSince at this time (Feb. 1939) I was still proposing to rely on the\nmethod of matching for the assessment of results, I was naturally\nanxious to see whether this was the case.\nIt was accordingly arranged, by the courtesy of Professor Bart-\nlett, to carry out an experiment on Feb. 11th, 1939, in the Cam-\nbridge Psychological Laboratory, with the contemporary Part II\nPsychology class. I am very particularly indebted to Mr Grindley\nfor organising this experiment, as well as to others mentioned below\nfor the parts they played.\n2. Procedure : Although, in this experiment, the percipients were\nin the same building as the experimenter during the production and\n\u2018\nexposure \u2019\nof the drawings, the conditions were not less rigid than\nthose for the other experiments. The class, numbering 7 women\nand 13 men,i was assembled in the practical class room on the second\nfloor of the building, and Professor Broad and Dr Banister kindly\nconsented to invigilate it. The originals were produced by me in a\nsmall room on the ground floor and the opposite side of the building\n(which, it may be noted, is unusually well insulated acoustically) and\nwere done under the supervision of Dr Rawdon Smith and IMr R. C\u2019.\nOldfleld. Conimiinication between the two rooms was maintained\nby Mr Grindley with the aid of a buzzer and telephone, and the\nrelevant corridors were patrolled by two of the laboratory assistants.\nAVhen the time came for the originals to be taken upstairs to be\nmatched by the percipients, as explained below, this was done by\nMr J. C. W. Craik, who had not been in either room during the\nprogress of the experiment. Even Mr Grindley, who informed the\ninvigilators, and through them the percipients, when to start and\nstop attempts to reproduce each original, was not actually in the\nsame room as myself but in a partitioned recess, and could not see\nwhat I drew. So the possibility of leakage from experimenter to\npercipients may be regarded as completely excluded.\nEach percipient was supphed with a pad of ten 6\" x 4 cards,\nnumbered 1 to 10. Each card had spaces in which the percipient\nwas to enter his name, the identifying letter of the original to which\nhe would eventually match his drawing, and the degree of confldence\nof the matching.\nI began by briefly explaining the nature of the experiment to the\nclass, and at once retired to the room downstairs in which the\noriginals were to be produced. Since at this time I had no idea of\nwhat these originals would represent, it was impossible for me to\nindicate their nature to the percipients, even inadvertently.\n^This included one percipient who had taken part in the first experiment.\n\f52 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nThe subjects for the originals were determined as follows : A\nset of cards, numbered 1 to 10, was randomised by Mr Oldfield and\nDr Rawdon Smith, using log tables, and were then inserted by Mr\nGrindley, face downwards and in a haphazard manner, between the\npages of a copy of the Concise Oxford Dictionary, wliich was also\nheld face downwards. Care was taken to ensure that Mr Grindley\ndid not see between what pages the cards were inserted, and, as\nalready mentioned, he was not in a position to see what I was\ndrawing or had drawn until after I had finished all drawings. More-\nover, to make assurance doubly sure, I was careful not to mention\nthe subject of any original aloud or to make any remarks concerning\nit, though I occasionally wrote down some explanatory comment and\nshowed it silently to Dr Rawdon Smith.\nTo select the subjects for the various originals, I turned the\ndictionary right way up, opened it successively at the cards numbered\n1, 2, 3 . . . etc., and took the first reasonably drawable or \u2018\nillustrable\u2019\nword that came in each case.\nThe words found and drawings made to illustrate them were as\nfollows :\n1. Spinning : I drew a Spinning Top.\n2 Parnassus : Illustrated by a roughly outlined Mountain at\ntJic toot of which was drawn a Greek Temple with iiillars, steps and\npediment.\n3. Jennet or small Spanish Horse ; A Horse was drawn.\n4. Exfoliate : I drew some Leaves.\no. Brim . Illustrated by a sort of Goblet or Chalice with a heavy\nbrnn or Ipi.\n6. Shooting ; I thought of drawing a field gun on wheels, and\nmade a note to this effect on the liottom of the sheet ;\nbut finally\ndrew a Sporting Gun with indications of a puff of smoke.\n7. Ancestor : Illustrated by an Old Man, with a bald head and\nlong beard, leaning on a stick.\n8. PRA\\yN : I drew as good a Prawn as I could, but it might\ne(]ually well have been a shrimp.\n4. Standard ; I tried to draw the Royal Standard, and produced\nan unmistakeable flag ;\nbut the Lion rampant was more suggestive\not a demented monkey.\n10. Throne ; I drew a kind of wooden Arm-chair with upright\nback and a very bad indication of a Crown on the top.\nThese originals were then randomised by Mr Grindley and Dr\nawulon Smith, were lettered A to J for purposes of identification,\nand were taken up to the class room by Mr Craik. They were there\npinned up in view of the percipients, who were asked to write on\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 53\neach of their cards the letter of the original which they thought it\nmost closely resembled and to grade this assignment a, j3, or y,\naccording to the degree of confidence they felt in it. When they had\ndone this, they noted their matchings on a separate slip of paper and\nhanded in their pads to Professor Broad. Meanwhile, Dr Rawdon\nSmith, Mr Oldfield, Mr Grindley and I remained incommunicados in\nthe downstairs room ;\nbut so soon as w^e had been informed, by\ntelephone, that all pads had been duly handed in, we went up and\nthe true order in which the originals had been produced was dis-\nclosed.\n3. Results : From the point of view of assessment by matching,\nand particularly as regards the question of whether the percipients\ncould match their own drawings better than an outsider could, this\nexperiment was a most discouraging failure ;\nfor the percipients\ncontrived to make only 17 correct matchings between them, which is\nthree below expectation.\n^\nOn the other hand, when I come to view this experiment in retro-\nspect, it is clear to me that it was of \\dtal importance, and marked\nthe turning point of the whole investigation.\nTo start with, of course, I consoled myself for the apparent failure\nby reflecting that the conditions under which the percipients\u2014and,\nindeed, the experimenter\u2014worked were so dilferent from those ot\nthe first experiment as amply to account for any deterioration of\nresults. 2 In the first place, the elaborate precautions taken to\nexclude leakage, admirable and necessary as they were, inevitably\nproduced an atmosphere of bustle and strain likely to be much\nmore inimical to success than that prevailing in percipients\u2019\nown homes ;\nin the second, a number of persons forming a group\nmight not behave in the same way as they would if they were\nfunctioning independently ;\nin the third, there might be a big\ndifference between producing a drawing at one\u2019s own time and\ninclination, and doing it to order whether one felt like it or not\n;\nfinally, whereas the trials of the first experiment were spaced at\nintervals of a day, those of the second were separated by no\nmore than some five minutes. Any of these factors, or jrerhaps\nothers not enumerated, might easily be held to have militated\nagainst success.\nBut as soon as I began to examine the drawings themselves at all\n^ For slightly greater detail, see Appendix II, p. 138.\n^ As it happened, the first ten sets of Expt. I, which gave a significant\nresult, were matched and the outcome was kno'wri, before the second experi-\nment was carried out ;\nthus the drop to a null result appeared a sad contrast\nto what had gone before.\n\f54 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nclosely, I received the impression that the appearance of failure was\nillusory and due to the breakdown of the matching technique rather\nthan to the percipients not receiving satisfactory impressions. So\nfar as siqjerficial indications went, indeed, they seemed to have done\nrather better than those of the first experiment. As a rough and\nready test, we find that they themselves assessed 31 drawings as\n\u2018\nalpha \u2019 grade resemblances to originals\u2014an average of 1-5 per set\n\u2014which was confirmed by H.S.C. working independently, who\ngave 30 ;\nwhereas, in the first experiment, H.S.C. and I working\ntogether gave 39 \u2018\nalphas \u2019\nin 37 sets, an average of only just\nover 1-0 per set. Since the assignment of \u2018\nal])has \u2019\ndepends solely\non the ])ersonal opinion of the judge, this is far from being con-\nclusive ;\nbut there is certainly a strong suggestion that, so far\nas intrinsic resemblance to the originals was concerned, the per-\ncipients of the second experiment were not inferior to those of the\nfirst.\nBut there was very much more to it than that, for inspection left\nlittle doubt that the drawings which \u2018\ncaught the eye \u2019\nas manifest\nsuccesses in the second experiment were not of objects commonly\ndrawn in the first, and vice versa. Among the second experiment\ndrawings, for example, was a really beautiful Spinning Top\u2014almost\na point to point replica of my original\u2014but there was nothing of the\nkind in those of Expt. I. Again, there were some five or six guns of\nsorts, or mention thereof, in the second experiment drawings, but\nnothing at all definite in the first. Again, whereas the first experi-\nment drawings showed about as many hands and cows as there were\nguns in those of tlie second, the latter produced no more than a\nglove and a finger-nail in the one case and two cows in the\nother.\n1 am deliberately using indefinite language here, corresponding to\nthe qualitative impressions obtained from inspection ;\nbut the\nconclusion was very strongly indicated that, if the order of the drawings\nwere ignored and the various sets considered as wholes regardless of\nthe positions oj their constituents, the drawings oj the second experiment\nresembled the originals of the second experiment, which they were\nintended to resemble, much 'more closely than they resembled the originals\noj the first experiment, which they were not intended to resemble ;\nand\nthat the drawings of the first experiment resembled their own originals\nmuch more closely than they did those of the second.\nThis was an enormous and vital step forward, though it took\nme some little time to realise its full implications ;\nfor it\ninvolved jettisoning altogether the natural assumption that suc-\ncess would necessarily take the form of good resemblances being\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 55\nproduced synchronously ^ with the originals which they resemble.\nIf I had not performed this experiment and been impressed by the\nSpinning Top and the relative profusion of \u2018\nShootings coupled\nwith the paucity of Hands, and similar observations, I might well\ni\nhave gone on for an indefinite period vainly trying to repeat the\ni\nremarkable \u2018\nflash in the pan \u2019\nmatching success obtained with the\nfirst ten sets of the first experiment. ^ But as soon as I realised that\n'\nthe basis of enquiry had to be shifted from comparisons within an\nindividual experiment to comparisons between different experiments,\nprogress became possible ;\nand as soon as I began to study seriously\nthe displacement of drawings from their expected positions, results\nof major importance began to emerge.\nExperiment III ; 1, General\n:\nThis was the smallest of the\n\u2018\nmass \u2019\nexperiments so far conducted and, as will be seen later,\nconspicuously the least successful. Only eleven percipients (4\nwomen, 7 men) took part. These were members of Mr 0. L. Zang-\nwill\u2019s AVorkers Educational Association psychology class, to whom\nhe was so kind as to introduce me. I was glad to take an oppor-\ntunity of having a few minutes\u2019 talk with this class on the evening\n'\nbefore the experiment started, for I thought that the personal\ncontact so obtained might increase the chances of success ;\nthe results\nsuggest, however, that its effects, if any, were in the opposite sense.\n2. Procedure : The procedure adopted was precisely that of the\nfirst experiment, with the trifling exception that H.S.C. did the odd-\nnumbered drawings in this case, and I the even, instead of the other\nway round. That is to say, ten originals were exposed in my study,\nin the same position as before, from 7.0 p.m. till 9.30 the next\nmorning on each of ten successive evenings, starting with that of\nWednesday, March 8th.^ Exactly the same precautions as regards\ncurtains and door-locking were taken as before. The books used\nwere some that had been left over from the first experiment, so I\nneed not describe them again ;\nand they carried, of course, the same\ninstructions of which only the dates needed alteration. At the end\nof the experiment they were handed in to Mr Zangwill, who very\nkindly carried out the necessary randomisation and numbering of\nI the sheets before passing them on to me.\n1 That is to say, within the same period of time as that during which the\n. original concerned was displayed; or alternatively, showing a one to one\nj' correspondence as to order with the original concerned,\nj\n2 Cf. pp. 72 below.\n\u00ae In the interests of strict accuracy it may be noted that these periods of\nexposure were twice interrupted for an hour or so while I carried out two\n\u2018\nindividual \u2019\nexperiments. Percij)ients were warned not to make attempts\nduring the periods of these inteiTuptions.\n\f6t) Whately Carmgton, M.A., M.Sc. [part\n3. Originals : The originals were selected by precisely the same\nprocess, using Chambers\u2019s Tables and Webster\u2019s Dictionary, as was\nused in Expt. I. The subjects thus chosen and illustrated were :\n1 Violin; 2. A Bird (supposed to be a \u2018Corn Bunting\u2019, but \/\nactually of a non-specific passerine appearance) ;\n3. A Fish ;\n4. Cleo- j\npatra\u2019s Needle ;\n5. A Skull ;\n6. The Planet Saturn ;\n7. A )\nFrog; 8. Fleur-de-Lys ;\n9. Cotton Aphid (this was blacked in\nby H.S.C.) ;\n10. A pair of Spectacles.\n4. Results : The matching was done by H.S.C. and myself,\njointly, as before. I had hoped that we might be able to repeat the\nsuccess of the early sets of the first experiment ;\nbut, as will be seen\non reference to p. 138, this hope was sharply disappointed.\nNone the less, the drawings sent in were far from lacking in J\ninterest. For example, there was one out and out success for the 1\nSpectacles, whereas I had found only one pair of spectacles in the\n57 sets of the first and second experiments and the 12 sets which,\nup to this time, had been produced in the Individual experiments not\nreported here. Again, the association between Saturn and Rings\nis, in my mind at least, extraordinarily close ;\nand in these 11 sets\nthere w'ere three instances of rings being drawn, though not on the\nright day, two being of the jeweller\u2019s variety and one a very solid-\nlooking annulus, as compared with only one\u2014and that as a quite\nsecondary ornament on one of the Hands\u2014in all other sets ;\nthat\nis to say, rings w'ere about 19 times as frequent in these sets as in\nthose among the originals for which Saturn did not figure. Fur-\n|\nther, there were three pyramids, which may be regarded as pretty |\nclosely associated to Cleopatra\u2019s Needle, as compared with one\nrather doubtful example in the other 59 sets mentioned. No one\nknows better than I that this sort of thing is not coercive evidence ;\nbut it served to support to some extent the view to which the\noutcome of the second experiment was leading me. I\nIn view of this, and of the fact tliat three of these percipients I\nshowed great promise (one was of outstanding interest) when subse-\nquently tried out under the conditions of the Individual Experiments,\nit is not at all easy to understand why this experiment should have\n|\nbeen so very unsuccessful, not only alisolutely but relatively as will\nbe seen in due course. So far as I can judge, the percipients were\nabove rather than below the average in intelligence and good will,\nwhile my personal contact with them, if this be supposed potentially\ndeleterious, was scarcely greater than that with the class of Expt. II.\nOn the whole, while content to leave the point for the present as a\nminor mystery, I am inclined to suspect over-conscientiousness\noperating by way of a kind of \u2018\nreversed effort \u2019.\n\f162] Experiments 07i Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 57\nExperiment IV, A and B : 1. General\n:\nThe results of these\nfirst three experiments left certain quite clear and definite impres-\nsions on my mind. These were, first, that although I was not yet\nin a position to prove it formally, successes were being obtained\nwhich could not plausibly be attributed to chance ;\nsecond, that the\nmatching technique was no good for the purpose, because most of\nthe best \u2018\nhits \u2019\nwere made on the wrong occasion ;\nthird, that the\nonly way to bring out the effect I was sure was there was to adopt\nsome quantitative plan for comparing experiments as wholes, so as to\nsee whether there was, as seemed plainly visible to me, a significant\ntendency for drawings to resemble their own rather than other originals,\nwhen sets of the one and series of the other were considered as wholes.\nI also had to face the difficulty, which is likely always to be\nembarrassing, that I could not decently rely to an indefinite extent\non the good offices of other people for scoring results. I accordingly\nplanned a large scale experiment in two parts, A and B, each forming\nas it were an experiment in itself, and arranged it in such a way that,\nafter suitable randomisation, I could score each set of drawings sent\nin against both series of originals used, without knowing to which it\nwas supposed to correspond. The plan did not work very well,\nbecause, although I used different percipients in the two parts (only\none worked in both), which I imagined would keep them satisfactorily\ndistinct, displacement appears to have taken place between the two\nparts just about as freely as it had previously done within the\nprevious separate experiments, though the double experiment as a\nwhole was highly successful. But we shall consider all this in full\nat a later stage and need say no more about it here.\n2. Percipients : This experiment was on a very much bigger scale\nthan any that had preceded it. About 370 books were sent out to\nvarious people whom I thought might be willing to participate, and\n183 came back.^ These 183 percipients were made up as shown in\nthe following Table ;\nTable 1\nPart A\nGroup Women Men Total\n1.

This is because a con-\nsiderable number of percipients, despite explicit instructions,\nomitted to write their full names on the cover of the book ;\nconse-\nC{uently,\nas I had not asked them to state their sex in so many words,\nI was often left in doubt on this j^oint. Provisionally, I have\ncounted all such delinquents as men, on the assumption\u2014which has\nat least the merit of gallantry\u2014that no woman would be so negligent\nas not to read the instructions.\nMy thanks are due to Dr Thouless in securing the participation of\nmost of the Cambridge Students, to Mr Fraser Nicol for the Edin-\nburgh Ptesidents, and especially to Dr Mary Collins for the handsome\ncontribution of 26 Edinburgh Students.\nThe outstanding features are, of course, the splendid effort of the\nDutch participants, and the Duke University Group arranged by\nDr Phine. 1 am particularly grateful to Mr J. J. Poortman for the\nimmense amount of trouble he took over the Dutch S.P.P. perci-\npients, not merely in circularising his members and in translating\nmy instructions into Dutch, but in translating all the key words in\nthe Notes and Impressions \u2019\nsubjoined to the various drawings,\nso that theie should be the minimum of difficulty m judging. I am\nalso much indebted to Mr H. Nout, of the Nederlandsch Spirituahs-\ntiscli Genootschaqi, for analogous good offices in respect of his\nAssociation.\n3. Bools, etc. : The drawing books used in this experiment were\nsubstantially identical in form and arrangement with those used in\nExpt. I. A few trivial alterations were made in the instructions\nwith a view to extra clarity, but the only important difference lay 1\nin shifting the spaces for Name and Age to the outer cover instead 1\nof the inner sheets, so that I should have no clues from these sources\n*\nas to wdiether the book 1 was scoring was an \u2018\nA \u2019\nor a \u2018\nB For the\nsame reason 1 resisted tlie temptation to use two different colours\nfor the covers, for I feared tliat in the jirocess of trimming or the like\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 59\nparticles of cover might be transferred to the pages and thus give an\nindication of which kind of book it was.\n4. Originals : The subjects for the originals were selected by the\nsame substantially random method as was used in the first and third\nexpermients. They were :\nFor Part .4:1. Dodo. 2. Flag (This was drawn as a hlach Flag\nwith a conspicuous white Latin Cross). 3. Castle (very \u2018\nschematic\nand toyshop-like). 4. Moustache. 5. Stop-cock or water tap.\n6. Butterfly. 7. Boot (The dictionary word was Shoe, but this\nwas illustrated by what is commonly known as a Boot in England,\nso a Boot w-as drawm). 8. Fan. 9. Balance (A Chemical Balance\nwas drawn). 10. Scissors.\nFor Part B : 1. Tree (Illustrated by a solitary Tree of indeter-\nminate species). 2. Fish-spear (Commonly known and thought\nof as Trident). 3. Bench (A kind of Garden Seat was drawm).\n4. Geissler Potash Bulbs (Commonly knowm as Bulbs, tout\ncourt). 5. Hammer. 6. Ew\u2019er, illustrated by a single-handed Jug\nwith a constricted neck. 7. Boat (The dictionary word was Ship,\nillustrated by a drawing of a full-rigged Ship ;\nbut H.S.C., whose\nturn it was, thought this too difficult to draw and drew a fore-and-\naft rigged sailing boat instead. This was shown in silhouette).\n8. Windmill. 9. Arrow. lU. Shell (A more or less Whelk-like\nShell was drawn.)\nThese originals were drawn, as before, by W.W.C. and H.S.C. in\nturn, the former starting, except that external circumstances made\nit impossible for H.S.C. to take her turn on the sixth occasion ;\nW.W.C. accordingly dre\\v both Stop-cock and Butterfly, and\nH.S.C. did Boot and Fan.\nThese twenty originals w'ere drawn and put up (from 7.0 p.m. till\n9.30 a.m. as before) in two sequences of ten consecutive evenings\neach, from Wednesclay, April 26th to Friday, May 5th, and W ednes-\nday. May 10th, to Friday, May 19th, 1939, inclusive, respectively.\nI hope I need hardly say, except as a matter of form, that the same\nprecautions w'ere maintained, as regards locking of doors and cur-\ntaining of window^s, as were used in the previous experiments.\n5. Randomisation : Despite the failure of the Method of Direct\nMatching used in Expts. 1, II and III, it was decided to persevere\nwith this, in the hope that H.S.C. or I might recapture her or my\ninitial virtuosity. It was accordingly necessary to effect a double\nrandomisation, first of the books themselves, so that I should\nnot be able to tell which was intended for A and which for B ;\nand\nsecond of the sheets in each book, as was done for the books of\nExpts. I & III.\n\f60 Whately Garington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nI\nThis very considerable labour was most kindly undertaken by 'I\nProfessor Broad, to whom I am greatly indebted for carrying out i\nthe work. Each book was identified by means of a pair of letters, '!\nsuch\nA\nas Em or Ft,\nor B character\ntaken from a suital^le key table, in which the\nof the book was entered. These letters were\nwritten on the original cover of the l)Ook, which was detached, and\non a temporary paper folder in which the torn out sheets were placed.\nAnother key table, giving a large clioice of random sequences of the\nnumerals 1 to 10, suitably prepared from logaritlim tables, was also\nsupplied, and the slieets of each book were numbered in accordance\nwitli one of these sequences before they were torn out ;\nthey were\nthen re-arranged in the order 1, 2, 3, . . . 10, which constitutes\neffective randomisation for this purpose. Identification was ensured\nby writing the appropriate two letters in the margin of the table,\nand the serial manlier of the sequence used on the cover of the book.\nAs a final precaution against tlie matching judge being able to draw\nany rational inferences as to the most probable true order of the\nsheets from a study of tlie distribution of digits in the logarithm\ntables, approximately half the liooks were numbered backwards\ninstead of forwards, suitable indications being given in the key table.\nSince none of this is relevant to the results later presented as\nevidence, though some of the matching work may be usefully\ninformative, 1 shall not go into further detail here.\n6. Results : It seems worth recording that during the period of\ntins large double experiment, extending over more than three weeks,\nboth H.S.C. and I were extremely \u2018\nstale \u2019\nand\u2014not to put too tine\na jiomt on it more than a little bored with experimenting in general\nand with the necessity of being on the spot to jiroduce an original\nevery evening in particular. Several times we nearly forgot ;\nonce\nwe were twenty minutes late (Windmill), and I fear that our\nthoughts throughout were more on an approaching trip abroad than\non paranormal cognition. I accordingly half expected that the\nexperiment Mmuld be a failure, or at least comparatively so ;\nand if\nsuccess or failure dejiended on the conscious mind of the experi-\nmenter, I do not see how it could have failed to be affected, even\nthough I was no less anxious than before that it should succeed.\nBut, as will be seen, it was at least as successful as the others, at\nany rate in the sense that it played its full share m producing the j\nhigh signiticant result obtained from the work as a whole.\nProbably the most notable features by inspection were : A fine\ncroji of Scissors (9 in the whole experiment, and none previously) ;\nlive Balances (incliRling Scales and Steelyards) also unprecedented ;\nFive Boots (only two or three slippers before this) ;\nEleven Shells\n\f!162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition, of Drawings 61\ni\n(counting Snails) as compared with two in earlier experiments ,\nand\nia relatively great number of Trees, Boats and Jugs (Lwers),\nthough all these had been fairly common.\nThese features will, of course, be incorporated in the calculation\nof the main over-all results and there is nothing to l\u201d)e added by\n[gloating over them here, striking as they were when first observed.\nOn the other hand, there was another feature, of a different kind,\nwhich appears to me of such outstanding general interest as to\n'\ndeserve a section to itself.\n'\n7. Special Note on Dr Rhine's Group : In due course I hope to\nmake a complete comparative study of the various groups who have\nengaged in these experiments, but I have not been able to undertake\nthis as yet. I feel it incumbent on me, however, to put on record\nhere the extremely striking results obtained by the group of 12 per-\n: cipients from Duke University.\nI\nBy inspection this group is outstandingly good ;\nin fact I have\nb no doubt at all that it will be found to be easily the best of all which\n<1 have taken part. At the moment I can say dehnitely :\ni\n1. When tested in a 2 x 2 table against all percipients who did\n:\nnot take part in Expt. IV A, viz., the percipients of Expts. I, II,\nIII and IV B, it yields an intrinsically significant positive result,\nfor we have\nDuke\nGroup Others Totals\nHits on Originals of IV A - 18 94 112\nHits on other Originals 60 729 789\nTotals 78 823 901\nwhence is found to be 7-853 with P less than -01.\n2. When tested against all other percipients who did take part\nin Expt. IV A, it yields a significantly better result, for we here have\nDuke\nGroup Others Totals\nHits on Originals of IV A - 18 40 58\nHits on other Originals - 60 268 328\nTotals - - - 78 308 386\ngiving 4-204 with P less than -05.\n{N .B. In so far as the above calculations are not self-explanatory,\nthe reader must wait for full enlightenment till we have discussed\nJlethods of Assessment and the calculation of results ;\nthey may,\nhowever, be taken as correct pending explanation of these matters.)\n3. It is better, though not significantly better (P~-09) than the\nother percipients of Expt. IV A at discriminating between the\nPart A and Part B originals.\n\f62 Whately Carivgton, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nIn view of the great amount and intensity of criticism\u2014mostly\nsttipid\u2014to which Dr Rhine\u2019s work has been subjected, I think it is\nonly fair that these very remarkable facts should be noted at the\nearliest jmacticable moment. They in no way invalidate, of course,\nthe consideralile legitimate criticisms which might be, but usually\nhave not been, brought against the work in question ;\nstill less do\nthey guarantee that all the results reported by Dr Rhine and his\ncolleagues or followers, or even any particular examples thereof, are\nveri(lical. But they do go a very long way towards substantiating Dr\nRhine s mam contentions in a general fashion. It will lie seen later\nthat the results of my experiments taken as a whole are very signi-\nhcantly ]iositive ; and in so far as they may be accepted they\nindicate the occurrence of a \u2018\nparanormal \u2019\nmode of cognition. But\nthis might perfectly well be true and Dr Rhine\u2019s results still due to\na mixture of carelessness, practical joking and so forth. On the\nother hand, the fact that members of the Duke Group did so well in\nthis exjieriment suggests to the point of demonstration that they\npossess 111 good measure the ability revealed by the investigation as\na V lole , and if this is so it seems to provide circumstantial evidence\nlor supposing that they may also possess the presumably closely\nallied abilities claimed for some of them hy Dr Rhine.\nSummary : The important points to note in this Section are not\nthe trivial details, which I record only for the sake of completeness,\nbut the following ;\n1. In all Experiments, the possibility of any percipient seeing\nany original, or of his hearing anything, such as pencil scratchings\ninvoluntary whisperings or the like, was completely excluded.\n2. In no Experiment was it possilde for any percipient to forecast\nor inter the nature of any original by any process of rational in-\nterence.\n3. The process of random selection which assures the second point\nalso assures the elimination of coincidental thinking prompted by\ncontemporary events.\n4. If anyone can show that, despite the precautions described,\nacre was, in fact, scope for the operation of sensory clues, rational\ninterence, or coincidental thinking, to any appreciable, extent, the\nexperiments are automatically suspect ;\nand if anyone can show\nthat any of these things did in fact take place to a material extent,\ntiien tlie experiments are inyalidated. But, if not, then not ;\nand\nm such circumstances, critics must transfer their attentions either\nto the Method of Assessment employed or to the statistical treat-\nment.\n\f162]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 63\nSECTION III\nMethods of Assessment\n1 . General\n:\nFrom various comments I have made in the preceding\npages it will have been gathered that I had substantially no difficulty\nin obtaining what appeared to be genuine positive results when\njudged by inspection and assessed by the persuasive if intangible\ncriteria of common sense. Fortunately or unfortunately, however,\nthe findings of \u2018\ncommon sense like the sayings of the immortal\nparrot, are not evidence ;\nand I found it by no means so easy to\ndevise a satisfactory method of assessment which should not only be\ncompletely free from any suspicion of bias and proof against all\nmanner of wish-thinking, but also sufficiently sensitive and capable\nof doing justice to the material.\nSomewhat correspondingly, I find that whereas most people with\nwhom I have discussed the matter have httle difficulty in under-\nstanding the necessity for the precautions taken against leakage,\nand their efficacy, they tend to go astray so soon as questions of\njudging and scoring arise. I shall deal faithfully with some of the\ncommoner pitfalls and fallacies at a later stage, but it will be desirable\nhere, as a preliminary to what follows in this Section, to consider the\nproblem in general terms.\nThe difficulty arises, both technically and in the mind of enquirers,\nwith the transition from the restricted to the free type of material.\nAlmost anyone can understand that there is just one chance in 52\nof guessing correctly a playing card drawn from a normal shuffled\npack ;\nor that, if a pack of 25 Zener cards contains 5 specimens of\neach of five varieties, the chance of any guess being right is one fifth,\nand five the most probable number of successes in 25 trials. iVnd\nmost people can at least grasp the idea that it is possible to calculate\nthe probabihty of any given number of successes arising, in these\ncircumstances, by \u2018\nchance alone \u2019\nor \u2018 pure guesswork \u2019, even\nthough they may be incapable of performing or even following the\nrequisite calculations themselves. But so soon as we begin to deal\nwith drawings, which may be of anything under the sun, where\nthere are no such convenient antecedent probabilities to guide us,\nand where opinions may very well differ widely as to what con-\nstitutes a \u2018\nsuccess \u2019, they seem to imagine that the whole business\nmust necessarily degenerate into a mere matter of opinion to which\nthe application of precise methods is impossible.\nThis is very far from being the case, and the various methods\ndescribed below, though of widely differing practical value, are all as\n\f64 Whately Carington, 31.A., 31. Sc. [part\nlogic nlly impeccable as any that have been used in the assessment of I\nrestricted material. Indeed, the boot is, if anything, rather on the !\nother leg ;\nfor the antecedent probabilities mentioned above are (\nnot, as is commonly but erroneously supposed, god-given a priori '\ncertainties : they are hypotheses basecl on assumptions (usually 1\njustifiable in the circumstances) to the effect that the packs of cards, j\netc., which are used ap])roximate very closely to ideal packs and :\nsuffer negligilfiy from defects, such as differences of stickiness, I\nwhich might cause their behaviour to diverge from the ideal pattern.\n1 think 1 am right in saying that all cases where these facts do not,\nin principle, need to be taken into account are special cases\u2014e.g.,\nthat of guessing all the cards in a pack of known composition.\nIn practice, however, scoring situations are pretty sharply divided\ninto two tvjres, in the first of which there can be no doubt as to what '\nconstitutes a success, while in the second there may be. In the\nfirst, the scoring is truly objective, so that it does not matter \\\nwhether the judge or scorer \u2018\nknows the answer provided he is\naccurate and honest ;\nwhereas in the second it is imperative, as a\nrule, that he should not know, lest his personal prepossessions\nshould Inas the outcome. All experiments with playing cards or\nZener cards fall into the first class, and all experiments with free\ndrawings into the second. There can, for example, be no doubt\nthat a success has been scored if the Queen of Hearts is guessed when\nthe (^ueen of Hearts is drawn, or that a guess is a failure if the '\npercipient says \u2018\nSquare \u2019\nwhen the card in question showed a Star.\nEven if we take partial successes into account, giving so many points\nfor rightness of suit, colour, number, and so forth, the procedure\nremains ])erfectly objective, for there can be no reasonable doubt\nthat a percipient who guesses Nine of Diamonds is thinking of a red\ncard, so that there can be no question, once the system of scoring\nhas been settled, as to how many marks he should be given in any\nparticular case.\nBut the moment we turn to unrestricted material, such as\nDrawings where the percipient is not asked to say Which of a number\nof known things the object to be cognised is, but What it is, the\nsituation beco!ues very different, and is still more so if the percipient\nis required to draw what he thinks it is instead of stating its nature\nin a word or two. For in these circumstances the question of whether\na success has l)een scored or not may easily be a matter of opinion\nor even of acute controversy. Is it to be counted a success, for\nexample, if the original is an Arch Bridge and the drawing is a\nSuspension Bridge ;\nor if the original is a Monkey and the drawing\na Gorilla, or a Lemur or a Baboon? Sceptical 2\n)urists might say No,\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 65\nwishful enthusiasts would say Yes ;\nand the only thing certain is\nthat, regardless of winch might be the more reasonable view, no\nassured conclusion could be reached.\nIt is accordingly clear that, unless our efforts are to be stultified\nbefore we start, we must base our enquiry on a somewhat wider\nconception than that of the simple \u2018\nright or wrong \u2019\nantithesis\napplicable to restricted material. This, of course, most emphati-\ncally does not mean that we are to allow any one-sided relaxation\nof standards such as would allow the wishful to claim mediocre\nresemblances as successes and to discard others as failures, just as\nit suited their purpose. On the other hand, it would evidently be\nabsurd to demand an exact point to point correspondence between\nOriginal and Drawing before conceding a \u2018\nhit \u2019, for this would merely\nensure that we should never record a \u2018\nhit \u2019\nat all, either in the right\nplace or the wrong.\nClearly, our proj^er plan will be to allow whatever latitude we see\nfit as regards what shall constitute a resemblance, or \u2018\nhit \u2019, but to\narrange our procedure in such a manner that this will cut equally\nboth ways and be as likely, if chance alone is operative, to increase\nthe number of hits in the wrong places as in the right. The first\nis necessary in order to secure any material to work on ;\nthe second\nis not only necessary but also sufficient to guard against warping the\noutcome in one direction or the other.\nIt is important to get this last j:)oint clear, for one of the commonest\ndelusions in this context is that lowering the standard of acceptance\n(i.e., the closeness of resemblance demanded before a hit is scored)\nmust ipso facto favour the production of spurious positive results.\nI do not know what the origin of this belief may be, biit I suspect\nthat it is based partly on a false analogy with experiments using\nrestricted material, and j^artly on a failure to realise that hits in the\nwrong place as well as in the right are, and must be, taken into\naccount in the assessment of any material of the type we are discuss-\ning. Obviously, for example, in an experiment with playing cards,\nwe should soon generate spurious results if we counted a guess of\nKnave or Queen as a full success when the card drawn was a King,\non the ground that these were court cards and \u2018\nvery like \u2019\nthe King.\nNo sane person would do this, of course, without taking into account\nthe fact that the antecedent probability of success has been materi-\nally increased ;\nthough it would be perfectly legitimate to do so if\nappropriate adjustment were made. I suspect that some people\ncannot get away from the idea that analogous antecedent pro-\nbabilities must be used in assessing free material and that lowering\nthe standard must be equivalent to the kind of thing just indicated.\n\f66 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part |\nwithout the possibility of applying the corresponding correction ; ]\nbut this, as will be seen, is not the case. Alternatively or addition-\nally, persons unfamiliar with this class of work are apt to think only I\nof one side of the situation and to forget that although lowering the i\nstandard is likely to increase the number of hits in the right places, '\nit is also likely correspondingly to increase the number in the wrong\u2019 I\njust as raising it will diminish the number in the wrong as well as in\nthe right. |\nPerhajis the point at issue may best be clarified by reflecting that\nthe relation between the original and the drawing, or the card and\nthe guess, etc., is always of a two-fold character ;\nthere is not only\na relation of likeness but also a relation of position. That is to say,\n|\nwe not only demand of a \u2018\nsuccessful \u2019\nguess or drawing that it shall I\nbe \u2018\nlike \u2019\nsome card or original used by the experimenter ;\nwe I\nrecpiire also that it shall occur in a position related in some definite\nway to that in which its prototype occurs. This may, at first sight,\nappear too vague ;\nactually it is no more than stating our second\nrecpuremcnt in accurate if general terms. Usually, of course, we\nrequire that the positional relationshij) shall be one of identity ;\nthat\nis to say, just as we demand that the percipient shall guess Square\nand not Circle when a Square is concerned, so we insist that he shall\ndo so on the 10th occasion, say, if that is the occasion on which a\nSquare is drawn, and not on the 11th or the 9th or any other. But\nthere is no kind of theoretical necessity for doing this, as regards\neither part of the relationship. In practice we usually do it because\nit seems to us more likely on common sense grounds (not always an\ninfallible guide) that if paranormal cognition occurs at all it is most\nlikely to do so in a certain particular form, namely that which will\nproduce a strong jiositive relation of likeness and an identity of\nordinal position between the \u2018\nprototype \u2019\n(original, card, etc.) and\nthe \u2018\nreproduction \u2019\n(drawing, guess, etc.). But this is based on a\njudgement, not necessarily correct, as to what is likely to happen,\nand we are perfectly entitled to modify either part of the relation-\nship, or both, in any way that seems good to us, as by enquiring\nwhether there is a significant tendency to guess black cards when\nred are diawii, and vice versa, or whether correct guesses tend to\noccur seven places later than, or within a range of three places before\nor after, the prototype. I am not suggesting that it would often\nbe w ise or profitable to go out of our way to hunt for peculiar \u2018\ncon-\nfigurations ,\nto adojit a convenient term, such as these or others\nmore fantastic ;\nbut it would, in princijile, bo perfectly legitimate to\ninvestigate the frequency of their occurrence, if there seemed any\nobject in doing so, provided always that we make the necessary\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 67\nallowances and apply the appropriate safeguards in estimating the\nprobability of their happening by chance.\nMy purpose in the preceding remarks was to introduce and\nemphasise the notion that there are more places (positions) than one\nin which a \u2018\nhit \u2019\nmay occur. Colloquially speaking, there are\n\u2018right\u2019 places and \u2018wrong\u2019 places; the right places are those\nspecified by the positional part of the compound relationship de-\nfining the configuration we are considering, siich^ as the same\nordinal position \u2019, or \u2018\nwithin the same experiment \u2019, and all other\nplaces are wrong. Once this idea is grasped, it is easy to see that\nwhat interests us in the general case is not the absolute number of hits\nscored, which may vary greatly according to the intrinsic popularity\n,\nso to say, of the prototype and the strictness or otherwise of the\nscoring, but the question of whether relatively ^ more hits are scored\nin the \u2018\nright \u2019 places than in the \u2018\nwrong \u2019. Further, it should be\nclear that, provided the process of scoring or marking is applied\nimpartially, that is to say without any systematic bias in one sense\nor the other, any increase or diminution in the total number of hits\nscored, as produced by lowering or raising the standard, will corre-\nspondingly inflate or diminish the numbers of hits in the right and\nwrong places indiscriminately.\u2019\nIn dealing with restricted material there is, of course, no difficulty\nabout ensuring impartiality, because there can be no difference of\nopinion about whether a hit has been scored or not ;\nbut as soon as\nwe begin to consider Drawings, where acute and perfectly legitimate\ndifferences may easily arise, the position is quite otherwise. Cases\nabout which there can really be no two opinions are the exception\nrather than the rule, and it would be no more than a time-wasting\nengenderment of controversy if we were to conduct our process of\nassessment in such a way that any positive results which might\nemerge could legitimately be attributed to bias on the part of the\njudge.\nThere is only one way of ensuring absolute impartiality in these\ncircumstances, and that is by arranging that the judge is wholly\n1 The word \u2018\nrelatively \u2019\nis necessary because, as a rule, there will be more\nwrong places available than right ;\nso that if chance only is at work, the\nabsolute number of hits in the vTong places will be greater than that in the\nright. What we want to know is whether the right places get more than their\nchance -indicated share of the hits recorded.\n2 In what follows, I shall frequently use the term \u2018\nwinners \u2019\nfor hits in the\n\u2018\nright \u2019 places, and \u2018\nlosers \u2019\nfor hits m the \u2018\n^vrong the words \u2018\nright \u2019\nand\n\u2018\nwrong \u2019\nhaving the meaning given above ;\nI shall reserve the word \u2018\nsuccess\n\u2019\nfor the particular case in which the ordinal position of the reproduction in the\nseries considered is the same as that of its prototype.\n\f08 Whafely Carmglon, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nignorant of which places are '\nright \u2019\nand which are \u2018\nwrong\u2019, so that\nhe cannot possilily favour the one category at the expense of the\nother in his allocation of hits. Under these conditions, the most\nthat wickedness or stupidity can achieve is a voluntary or involun-\ntary sabotaging of the experiment, either by recording so many\nhits as to swamp any real effect there may be, or so few as to prevent I\nits emergence.\n'\nFor this reason, no less care has been taken throughout this work I\nto prevent leakage of the relevant information to judges than to\nprevent leakage of sensory and inferential clues to tlie percipients.\nIn the following sections I describe three methods of assessment\nwhich have been tried. Only the third has proved satisfactory, but\nI have thought it worth while to give some account of the other two, |\npartly for the sake of completeness, and partly in order to emphasise\nthe imjiortance of not deciding too rigidly m advance the form which\na real effect, if any \u2018\nmust \u2019\ntake. The third method is neither more\nnor less theoretically valid than the first, but it revealed the signi-\nficance of previously unsuspected facts indicated by inspection of\nthe material ;\nthe first was just as good a w^ay of tackling the job\nin the light of antecedent ignorance, but since the effect it was\ndesigned to bring out was not detectably present it led to null\nresults.\n2. The Method of Forced Matching : The matching technique\ndiscussed below is not new to psychological practice, for it has been\nfairly freely used in cases such as the connection of character with\nhandwriting where ordinary quantitative methods cannot readily\nbe apjihed. The principles involved are likely to be more easily\ngrasped liy some readers if we begin by considering an illustrative\nexample of this kind.\nWe will suppose that we want to know whether a graphologist\ncan form, from specimens of handwriting, estimates of the writers\u2019\nc aracters which cannot plausibly lie discounted as no more than\nlucky shots ;\nand we will suppose that we are rightly anxious to\nehimnate any bias due to our own preconceptions as to the possibility\nof doing so. We select, say, ten subjects. A, B, C . . . I, J, for\nexperiment and obtain from each a sjiecimen of handwriting which\nwe siilmiit to the graphologist, asking him to make out the best\ncharacter sketch he can of each person concerned and to give us the\nten sketches shuffled up so that we cannot tell wliich is meant for\nwhich person, but so numbered that they can later be identified. At\nour end, we may either rely on our personal knowledge of Messrs\nA, B, C, etc., or we induce some competent observer acquainted\nwith them all to prepare ten other character sketches based on\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawhigs 69\nordinary experience ;\nthese may either be randomised or not, but\nwe will suppose they are not. When the graphologist\u2019s versions\narrive, we compare them with those of the competent observer or\nwith our own knowledge, and try to pair the two sets olf grapholo-\ngist\u2019s A against observer\u2019s A, graphologist\u2019s B against observer s B,\nand so forth ;\nbut of course, as I have just said, we do not know\nwhich of the graphologist\u2019s sketches is meant for A and which for B,\nso that we are forced to rely exclusively on the resemblances, if any,\nbetween his version and that of the other observer. When we have\npaired oft\u2019 the two sets to the best of our abihty, we ask the grapholo-\ngist for the key to his numbering, and thus ascertain how many\ncorrect pairings we have made. We might find this sort of thing\nfor example :\nGraphologist\u2019s estimate of: .TCHDEAGBIF\nis paired with\nObserver\u2019s estimate of: ABCDEFGHIJ\nHere there are four correct pairings, namely those of D, E, Gr\nand I, wdiich is a good deal more impressive than it looks, for we\nshould obtain four or more coincidences only once in fifty such trials,\non the average, if chance alone were operative\u2014if, for example, we\nhad simply drawn the two sets of sketches at random out of two hats.\nThe point to grasp here is that, if character and handwriting\n(strictly speaking, as estimated ))y the particular observer and\ngraphologist concerned) have no systematic connection with each\nother, and the graphologist has no other source of information than\nthe specimens submitted to him, then the matching procedure is\nprecisely equivalent to the hat drawing ritual so far as the chances\nand expectations of finding coincidences are concerned. For, ex\nhypothesi, there is no more than a random relation between the\ngraphologist\u2019s only guide and the characters he is trying to assess ;\nand even if the observer\u2019s estimates were perfect, the relation of the\ngraphologist\u2019s versions to these could still be no more than random.\nIt is very important to note here that we are not concerned in a\nsituation of this type with the question of how good the grapholo-\ngist\u2019s estimates are, in any absolute sense, but only with whether\nthey are good enough to enable us to identify each as more like some\none of the other sketches than it is like the rest.\nNow let us replace the known estimates of character, as made by\nthe observer or ourselves, by the Originals in one of our experiments,\nand the graphologist\u2019s efforts by the Drawings of one of the per-\ncipients suitably shuffled and code numbered so that we do not know\nwhich is which. Then the situation as regards matching the\n\f70 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nDrawings to the Originals is fornially the same as that of matching\nthe graphologist\u2019s character sketches to the observer\u2019s estimates.\nMost peojile seem to have no difficulty in understanding the grapho-\nlogical parallel, but many come to grief when they try to think of\nthe drawing-original situation. This appears to be mainly due to\nan insistent confusion between the prol)ability of the j\nudge correctly\nmatching the nth drawing to the \/(,th original by chance alone, when\nhe has nothing but the intrinsic resemblance to rely on, and the\nprobabihty of the percipient drawing an \u2018\nX \u2019, or an \u2018\nX-like \u2019\nobject,\non the same occasion as an \u2018\nX \u2019\nis represented by the original.\nHowever, since the method is well established, and I am not\nrelying on its results for evidential purposes here, there is no need\nto s])end more time on demonstrating its validity.\nThe procedure itself is simj^le enough. The judge (in these cases\nusually H.S.C. or W.W.C.), with the originals of the experiment\nconcerned before him and knowing, as a rule, the order in which\nthey were used, receives the drawings of each percijjient arranged in\na random order by some third party {vide supra) and code-numbered\nfor subsequent identification. He accordingly has no external clue\nto guide him in deciding which drawing was intended for which\noriginal and must rely solely on such intrinsic resemblances as he can\ndetect. His task, of course, in respect of every percipient, is to\nassign each of the (normally) ten drawings to whichever of the\noriginals he considers it most closely resembles, or is least unlike.\nSometimes this is easy enough, as with the Hands and Cows of\nExpt. 1, which could be assigned to Hand and Buffalo without\nhesitation, or with the Tops and Guns of Expt. II and Scissors and\nBalances of IV A ;\nbut more often it is necessary to look for some\nmore or less recondite similarity of form, or for associations of greater\nor less remoteness, in order to come to a decision ;\nfor example, in\nExpt. I, we frecpiently assigned drawings of Boats to the original\nAnchor, on the ground that both were \u2018\nnautical \u2019, or vases, etc., to\nBottle, as being \u2018\ncontainers \u2019.\nThe judge is obliged, it will be\nunderstood, to assign every drawing to some original (hence the\nname \u2018\nForced \u2019\nMatching) and it not infrequently happens that the\nutmost ingenuity fails to discern any plausible resemblance at all,\nso that one or more drawings are finally placed by elimination or\nsimply at random. After all the assignments have been made, on\none basis or another, and duly noted, the occasion on which each\ndrawing was actually produced is ascertained by reference to the\nkey held by the third party aforesaid, and the number of correct\nmatchings made in the case of each percipient is counted. It is then\nonly a matter of some not very advanced mathematics to determine\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 71\nthe probability of the observed number in each case being due to\nchance alone. I need not i nfl ict these on the reader here, but the\nfollowing Table, for which I am indebted to Dr Thouless, shows\nthe probabilities of making the various possible numbers of correct\nmatchings for series of ten originals and ten drawings, such as we\nare concerned with here. The column headed R gives the number\ncorrect, which may have any value from 0 to 10 inclusive, except 9.\nUnder N is shown the number of ways in which 10 drawings can be\narranged so that R are rightly matched ^\n;\ncolumn P gives the\nprobability of getting exactly R right by chance alone, while P'\nshows that of obtaining R or more right by chance, which is what\ninterests us here.\nTable 2\nR N P P'\n0 1,334,961 \u2022367,9 1-0\n1 1,334,960 \u2022367,9 \u2022632,1\n2 667,485 \u2022183,9 \u2022264,2\n3 222,480 \u2022061,31 \u2022080,3\n4 55,650 \u2022015,34 \u2022019,0\n5 11,088 \u2022003,056 \u2022003,66\n6 1,890 \u2022000,520,8 \u2022000,600\n7 240 \u2022000,066,1 \u2022000,079\n8 45 \u2022000,012,4 \u2022000,013\n9 0 0 \u2014\n10\nTotal\n:\n1\n3,628,800\n\u2022000,000,276 \u2022000,000,3\nThese figures apply to any single set of ten matchings ;\nwhen,\nas in any of these experiments, we wish to combine the results from\na plurality of percipients, it is more convenient to apply the Stevens\nmatching formula (Cf. pp. 83-84 below), from which it is easily seen\nthat the expected number of correct matchings is equal to the number\nof percipients, with variance the same ;\nfor in each case the expecta-\ntion is 1 with variance 1 ;\nand the expectation and variance for the\nwhole group are equal respectively to sum of the expectations and\nthe smn of the variances of the constituents.\nThe actual residts of matching the first three experiments in this\nway are summarised in Appendix II, from which it will be seen that,\nwhen all results are taken together, no conclusion of serious evidential\nvalue in favour of a cognitive elfect can be drawn. There are, how-\never, one or two points of interest which are worth mentioning.\n^ These necessarily add up to 3,628,800, or \u2018\nfactorial ten \u2019, which is the total\nnumber of different ways m which ten things can be arranged.\n\f72\nI\nWhately Garington, M.A., M.Sc. [pabt\nChief of these is the very remarkable score of no fewer than six\ncorrect matchings obtained with one of the percipients of the first k\nexperiment. Reference to the Table just given will show that such m\na result, or better, could be expected, on the average, only about six\ntimes in 10,000 such trials, or once in about 1,600 attempts. This,\nof course, would be highly significant if it were the only observatiori\nto be considered, ami the probability of its occurring by chance\neven as the best among the 68 sets of the first three experiments\nis no more than 1 in 25, which would itself be considered tolerably\nsignificant in normal contexts.\nBut the attendant circumstances rendered this result even more\nremarkable than it ajijiears at first sight. The jiercipient was the\nfourth whose drawings were matched by H.S.C. and myself, and it so\nhappened that we completed a batch of ten, and ascertained the\nnumber of matchings correctly made, before going on to deal with the |\nremaining sets. In this first batch of ten, we scored as many as\n20 successes, which is an excess of 10 over expectation with standard \u00ae\nerror 3-162. Such an excess or greater would occur only once in i'.\nabout 660 such groups of 10 by chance alone, and no more than once\n'\nin almost exactly 100 times as the best of 6-8 such groups (i.e., in\nthe whole of the material so far dealt with by matching). It is quite f\nlegitimate to single out this group for special consideration, because\nit is, so to say, isolated from the rest by considerations other than\nits high score ; it was the first we matched ;\nwe stopped when we\nhad done it ;\nand we did not resume the work till after we were\naware of the success of our efforts ;\nthus the group is sharply\n'\ndistinguished from all others on both chronological and psychological\nj\ngrounds. The success achieved may, of course, have been no more '\nthan a fiuke, either in its entirety or as regards the six-success set\nonly, and if anyone wishes to write it off as such on the ground that\n'\nwe failed to repeat it, I cannot reasonably object ;\nbut it will be his\nloss, not mine. I might have felt constrained to do so myself if the I\nMethod of Palpable Hits had not yielded the very much more\nsignificant results reported below. As it is, I think it much more (\nprobable that it is genuine, and represents an unrepeated (though I\n\u2018\nhope not unrepeatable) display of what I can only call \u201c insight \u201d ,\nby H.S.C., who was almost wholly responsible for the matching at\n'\nthis stage. Certainly it was not due to these ten percipients having\ndrawn things more clearly lilve the originals than others did ;\nin\nparticular, the hero of the six successes produced no unmistakeable\nresemblance at all, and H.S.C. \u2019s assignments in this case appeared to\n'\nme (I must confess) to border on the far-fetched and unconvincing.\nThis, however, does not alter the facts or the probabilities, which\nj.Jj\nUli\nLia\n\f162]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 73\nclearly suggest that the achievement was more in the nature of a\ntour deforce than a stroke of luck. If this is so, the implications are\nof very great psychological interest from two points of view : in\nthe first place it is suggested that a genuine cognitive process may\nbe subject to such distortion as leads to expression in almost\nunrecognisable form ;\nin the second, it would appear that to detect\nthe relation between drawing and original in such cases calls for\nsomething more or other than rational perspicacity can provide ;\npresumably it involves a kind of intuitional process at the same\nmental level as that at which the distortion or transformation took\nplace.\nAs a matter of fact, we shall later find evidence for supposing\n(p. 95) that drawings having no more than a very feeble resemblance\nto their originals are yet to some extent determined by them, which\ntends to support this view ;\nand it is greatly to be hoped that\nH.S.C. may succeed in recapturing her initial virtuosity, the loss of\nwhich (if real) is probably accounted for by the feeling that the\nsuccess achieved settled the question at issue beyond need of further\neffort.\nThe other point that requires mentioning is the remarkable\ntendency we noticed for the best aiid most convincing resemblances\nto occur on the wrong occasions. We made it a practice to grade\nour matchings as a, \/?, or y according to the degree of confidence\nwe felt in them, which very approximately corresponded to the\ndegree of resemblance discernible, and the Table below shows the\nnumbers of a\u2019s given in each of the first three experiments and how\nmany of them were displaced early, late, or not at all.\nTable 3\nDisplacement\nEarly Zero Late Total\nExpt. I 9 2 28 39\n\u201e II 11 3 17 31\n\u201e III 9 1 9 19\nTotal 29 6 54 89\nWe should of course expect about 9 zero displacements out of\n89 awards if chance only were operative, and the difference is not\nsignificant. On the other hand the excess of Late over Early\ndisplacements is quite definitely so, both for the first experiment\n(P<-01) and for the Totals (P<-()2). This might be due, on the\nchance-only hypothesis, to the more popular originals (i.e., those\n\f74 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nmore commonly drawn under truly random conditions) happening\nto have come early in the series. I did a considerable amount of\nwork, by control matchings and otherwise, to investigate this\npossibility ;\nbut concluded that though the effect was probably a |\nreal one, it was to some extent due to this cause, while the data !\navailable were insufficient to settle the matter decisively. But we |\nshall be dealing with the whole question of Displacement, which is i\nextremely important, at a later stage and by rigid methods, so that\nI need not go into details of these early explorations here, beyond\nremarking that these ol)servations went far to support the belief\nengendered by the success of the first batch of matchings that\nsomething other than chance was at work.\nFor similar reasons I need not describe here the investigations I\nundertook to test sundry hypotheses, of varying degrees of far-\nfetchedness, advanced by assorted critics to account for our initial\nsuccess on normal grounds ;\nfor example, the suggestion that '\npercijnents might tend to do their drawings later and later as the\nexperiment progressed, and that we might have been unwittingly !\nguided in our assignments by the time data recorded on the sheets. I\nAll these yielded null results.\nOn the whole, I think there is very little to be said for the Method |\nof Forced Matching for this purpose, or probably for any other. i\nApart from the fact that it is liable to be completely wrecked by '\nthe ])henomenon of disjilacement, it does not seem to yield any\ninformation that woidd not l )e given by a suitable system of marking,\nwhile it automatically precludes the possil)ility of giving recognition\nto the influence of more than one original on the same drawing,\nj\nand is hopeless for dealing with multi])le or composite drawings.\nThe chief advantage gained is that the assessment of each experi-\n|\nment, and indeed of each percipient, is self-contained, and does not\n|\nrequire reference to any other drawings ;\nand it would be of out- |\nstanding value for cases, if ever they occur, in which very faint I\nresemblances, such as would probably be ignored in any ordinary\nsystem of marking, preponderantly appear on the correct occasions. |\n2. The Method of Decimal Scoring.\nThe results of tlie first ex])erinient suggested, and those of the\nsecond and third confirmed, that the Method of Forced Matching was\nnot likely to be successful. This was not because the drawings pro-\nduced by the perci])ients bore no discernible resemblance to the\noriginals at which the set as a whole was aimed, or only resemblances\nso infrequent or so feeble as to be of insignificant importance ; on\nthe contrary, so far as common sense inspection and estimation of\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 75\nprol.>al)ilities could tell, they seemed to be representing at any rate\nthe general idea, if not the exact form, of the originals a good deal\nmore successfully than was likely to be due to chance alone for\nexample, by the appearance of Hands and Cows in Expt. I and of\nShootings and Tops in Expt. II. The trouble, as already indicated,\nwas that the most successful reproductions tended to come in the\nwrong place, so that the Hand displayed as an original on Saturday,\nsay, would appear as a percipient\u2019s drawing on Sunday or Monday\ninstead of on its proper day. Since the whole Method of Matching\ndepends on the assumption that there will be preponderantly a\none to one correspondence of occasion between an original and the\ndrawing most closely resembling it, it is pretty well bound to be\ndefeated by displacements of this kind ;\nat the very least, its utility\nis likely to be seriously impaired. On the other hand, it is far from\nunreasonable to suppose that an impression subconsciomsly received\nmight remain latent for some little time until either an internal\nprocess of gestation, or the incidence of some extraneous stimulus\nbrought it into the conscious field ;\nalternatively, a process of\ngestation in the mind of the agent might be necessary prior to\ntransmission, if the cognition were dependent on telej^athic\nfactors.\nI accordingly sought for a method which should enable us to\nanswer the broader question of whether the sets of drawings pro-\nduced by the percipients, taking each set as a whole, significantly\ntended to resemble the series of originals at which they were aimed\n[i.e., the series of originals used in the experiment in which those\npercipients were concerned) more closely than they resemljled series\nof originals at which they were not aimed. The idea, in other words,\nwas to match each set of drawings, as a whole, against two or more\nseries of originals, as wholes (one of them being that at which the\ndrawings were aimed) instead of matching individual drawings\nagainst individual originals.\nThere is, of course, no theoretical reason why this should not\nbe done in the literal manner suggested by the words used above.\nWe might, that is to say, present the judge with the originals of\nperhaps half a dozen experiments, divided into the six series in\nwhich they were actually used, together with all the sets of drawings\nproduced in those experiments, suitably randomised and coded, and\nask him to assign each set to the series which, on the whole, he thinks\nit most closely resembles, working by inspection and qualitative\njudgement alone. But the practical difficulties of such a procedure\nare great, as was discovered when Prof. Broad kindly attempted to\napply this plan to six sets of drawings and originals produced in the\n\f'6 Whatehj Oariugion, M.A., M.Sc. [part\ncourse of the Ihivate or Individual Experiments. Apart from the\ndifficulty of bearing a large number of originals in mind at a time,\nthere is that presented by the conflicting claims of drawings in the\nsame set, of which some may resemble originals in one series, while\nothers resemble originals in other series ;\nand it may become neces-\nsary to decide whether the strong resemblance of a certain drawing\nto originals in series A should or should not outweigh the fainter\nresemblances of two or more other drawings to originals in series B.\nConsiderations of this kind necessitated the introduction of some\nquantitative method of expressing estimated degrees of resemblance,\nas opposed to making a purely qualitative decision to the effect that\none drawing, or set, was more like one original, or series, than the\nothers with which it was compared.\nThe plan I thought most promising was as follows : J udges were\nto be given a collection of shuffied and coded sets of drawings taken\nfrom two (or possibly more) experiments together with the originals,\nalso shuffled, belonging to those experiments, and were to be asked\nto assign to each drawing as many points, from 0 to 10 inclusive,^\nas they thought it deserved for its resemblance to any original or\noriginals. In cases where two or more objects appeared in the\nsame drawing the marks which Avould have been given to any of\nthem if shown singly were to lie reduced to an extent corresponding\nto the relative importance of the object in que.stion in the drawing\nin which it appeared ; To quote from the instructions \u201c If the\nrelevant object shares the drawing more or less equally with one, two,\nthree, etc., other objects of apparently equal imjiortance, it should\nlie given a half, a third, a quarter, etc., of the points it would have\nbeen given if it had appeared alone \u201d. This regulation was probably\nunwise, and was discarded in the Method of Palpable Hits finally\nadopted ;\nfor further reflection suggested that the important point\nis not likely to be that of whether the idea depicted in the original\nis the only impression received by or present to the mind of the\npercijiient, but of whether the draw'ing jirovides good evidence for\nsupposing that the idea wuis prominently present in his mind at all.\nIt we add up the ]ioints allotted in this way to the originals of each\nseries concerned, for each set so scored, we shall obtain totals which\nwill, in general, be unequal ;\nand if the total for the series at which\nany particular set was aimed is greater than for that or those at\nwhich it w^as not aimed, we may say that the set has been correctly\nmatched to its owm series.\nThus, to take an imaginary example, a jiarticular set from Expt. I,\n^ Hence the name given to the method.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 77\nsay, scored against the originals of Expts. 1 and II, might yield\nresults like this :\nwing No. Original Point.s\n1.

I, while Parnassus, Horse and Throne,\nscoring only 15 between them, belong to Expt. II, we conclude that\nin the opinion of the judge the set, taken as a whole, resembles the\noriginals of Expt. I, at which it was aimed, more closely than it\nresembles those of Expt. II at which it was not aimed. If we have\na number of sets scored in this way, we can calculate the ])robability\nthat any observed proportion of them should be correctly allocated\nto their own originals as the result of chance alone.\nIt is clear that the process of allotting points to the originals of\nthe various series concerned according to the degree of resemblance,\nif any, that each drawing of a set is judged to show to them, and\nthen adding the scores so obtained by each series, is only a\nroundabout way of \u2018\nmatching \u2019\nsets as wholes to series as wholes,\nwhich is what we set out to do.\nA rough and ready trial of the method yielded promising results ;\nbut exploration soon showed that it had serious disadvantages.\nThe chief of these may be summarised by saying that it proved\nextremely difficult to frame instructions elastic enough to give room\nfor the exercise of common sense and at the same time sufficiently\nprecise to avoid lea\\dng the result too much at the mercy of the\nindi\\ddual caprices of the jiidge. Such idiosyncrasies could not, of\ncourse, systematically falsify the outcome, nor would they be likely\naltogether to obscure a genuine positive result in the long run ;\nbut,\nby introducing factors other than the straightforward resemblance\nor close association of drawing to original, they in effect increase the\nvariance, and may thus inordinately lengthen the \u2018\nrun \u2019\nnecessary\nto secure a definite answer to the questions studied . As an example\nof the kind of thing I have in mind, one potential judge of whom I\nhad great hopes, insisted, in flagrant violation of the instructions,\n\f78 Whafely Caringto)i, 31. A., M.Sc. [part\non giving the maximum of 10 marks to Hand for a drawing expressly\ndescribed by the percipient as representing a fingernail ;\ntwo others\nseemed to think that they were engaged in a puzzle picture com-\npetition, on the lines of \u2018\nIn this drawing of a bird\u2019s nest find five\nhidden pirates \u2019\n;\nwhile in another instance it was seriously contended\nthat a drawing of a girl on a surfl)oard should be given points for\nIncubator, on the ground that the words \u2018\npoule \u2019\nin French and\n\u2018\nchicken \u2019\nin American are colloquially used to refer to the female\nyoung of the human species. This kind of thing might be of interest\nin pursuing the more abstruse ramifications of the subject, but so\nlong as we are in doubt as to whether any paranormal cognition\ntakes place at all it can only obscure the issue.\nAnother and sometimes more serious trouble is that if the objects\ndepicted in one series of originals are appreciably more popular, in\nthe sense of being more frequently drawn under chance conditions,\nthan those of the other series they will tend to attract, as it were, an\nundue proportion of points, so that only sets resembling the other\nseries so strongly as to outweigh this difference will escape the\nattraction and have a chance of being allocated to the less popular\nseries. This effect is very marked in the case of Expt. IV B, which\ncontains some highly popular originals, notably Tree and Boat\n;\nreference to Ajjpendix III will show how it ruins my scoring of 80 sets\nfrom Expt. IV.\nFinally, if the method is applied, as I applied it, to drawings and\noriginals taken from only two experiments at a time, it is liable to be\nextremely insensitive, because so high a jmoportion as 50% correct\nassignments might be expected to result from guesswork alone ;\nwhile, on the other hand, the task of attempting to decide what\nfraction of a maximum of 10 points should be allotted to which, or\nperhaps each of several, of more than twenty originals is too difficult\nto expect any ordinary person to attempt with success.\nIn view of these handicaps it is hardly surprising that application\nof the method was next door to being a failure. Mr and Mrs Oliver\nGatty, to whom I am very much indelfied in this matter, working\non the suitably grouped, randomised and camouflaged drawings of\nthe first three experiments, obtained a result slightly beyond the\n\u202207 level of significance, which looked reasonably promising, though\nhardly a rich reward for the examination of over 650 drawings. But\neven this was reduced to no better than -12 when my own scoring\nof 80 sets from Expt. IV, A & B, was included, and was only raised\nto a level a little better than -03 by the incorporation of the 16 sets\nof the Individual Experiments. Details are given in Appendix III.\nThese results were disappointing, especially in view of the amount\n1\n1\ni\n!\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 79\nof labour involved, and by contrast with the degree of success\napparently visible to the naked eye. It seemed clear to me that the\nmethod was at once too delicate and too cumbrous, too elaborate and\ntoo insensitive, to be of permanent utility, and that something\nconsiderably better would have to be devised.\n3. The Method of Palpable Hits.\nGeneral\n:\nThis, the third and (so far) last method adopted was\ndesigned to overcome the difficulty of Displacement which stultified\nthe first, while avoiding the defects of vagueness and insensitivity\nwhich, so far as I could judge, were chiefly responsible for the poor\nresults obtained from the second.\nIt must be realised that all the time the collection of material\nand attempts at assessment described above were going on I was\ncontinually impressed by the plain, commonsense evidence that the\nexperiments seemed to thrust upon my notice. For example : The\noriginals of the first experiment contained a Hand, and the 37 sets\nof the first experiment showed at least six obvious drawings of hands,\napart from several with plausible claims as partial successes ;\nin\ncontrast, the 31 sets of Expts. II & III produced no more than\none glove and one finger-nail, which might j^erhaps count as one\nsuccess for Hand between them. For Buffalo, I found five obvious\ncows in the first experiment, but only two in the second and third\ntogether. Similarly, I found five unmistakeable guns, cannon, etc.,\nfor Shooting among the drawings of the 20 sets of Expt. II, and\nonly one very doubtful candidate in the 48 sets of Expts. I & III.\nAgain, when I began to examine the drawings of Expt. IV, I found\na very satisfactory number of Scissors and Balances, neither of\nwhich had appeared at all in the drawings of the first three experi-\nments, together with an apparently undue proportion of Ewers (or\nsimilar vessels) and isolated Trees. It seemed to me almost\nincredible, on conunon sense grounds, that these effects were solely\ndue either to chance or to the wishful selectivity of my own mind, or\nthat, if they were genuine, it should be impracticable to demonstrate\nthem significantly by some tolerably simple method.\nI accordingly determined to abandon, for the time being at any\nrate, my ideas on giving full scope to possible associations, distortions\nof form, symbohsms, etc., and to concentrate on the simplest and\nmost straight-forward method of assessment possilile. I similarly\nresolved to discard the niceties of gradation afforded by giving\nanything from 0 to 10 points to a resemblance, together with the\nsystem of scoring in proportion to the importance of the object in\nthe drawing, and to base the assessment as nearly as possible on the\n\f80 Whately Caringfon, 31.A., 31. Sc. [part\nj\nsimple principle Do this drawing and that original plainly and \u00bb\nunmistakeably portray the same thing? If they do, give one mark ;\nI\nif they do not, give nothing.\u201d In other words, only \u2018\"palpable hits \u2019\n\u00ab\nwere to be counted.\nThis sounds simple enough on ])aper, but in practice it is not d\nnearly so easy as might be supposed, and I found it quite impracti-\ncable (somewhat fortunately, as it proved) to induce others con- i\ncerned to adopt and maintain the high standard I originally en-\nvisaged, and extremely difficult to adhere to it myself.\nIn the first place, I realised even before I started, that it would be i\nnecessary,\nto modify the basic rule, so as to cover composite drawings i\ncontaining more than one object, by adding \u201c or does the drawing i\nprovide plain and unmistakeable evidence that the object portrayed\nin the original was prominently in the mind of the percipient when I\nhe made the drawing \u201d, or words to that effect ;\nand the introduction :\nof the word prominently \u2019\nat once opens the door to a certain !\namount of difference of opinion and ambiguity ;\nyet without this |\nmodification a number of drawings which common sense would i\nindicate as cleanly hits \u2019, such as horses in carts, or cows standing 1\nunder trees, might be rejected by too literal a follower of instruc-\ntions.\nIn the second place, even the words \u201c the same object \u201d cannot\nbe wholly unamliiguous ;\nfor example, a drawing of a child might\nbe helcl to represent Ancestor just as well as the old man I actually\nc rew, for very many children have descendants and all ancestors\nwere }-oung once. In cases such as this it seems necessary to keep\npretty closely to the actual drawing ;\nwhereas with an original like\n(\nJNet (Dxpt. I, 8) it is more important to consider what was in the\n'\nagent s mind (namely, illustrating a net) rather than all of what was (\ndrawn (namely, a man pulling a net with little fish in it out of the\nsea) for It would be obviously absurd, or so I think, to give a mark to\nevery drawing which shows a man, a fish or the sea, without any I\nindication of the net. On points such as these opinions may well '\ndiffer, and it does not very much matter what we decide to do, pro-\nvided our decision is not manifestly nonsensical and that we hold\nto It with reasonable consistency ; indeed, failure to conform to even\nthese conditions would not necessarily prove fatal. It will be\nunderstood, or so I hope, that no convention of a general kind can i\npossibly produce a spurious positive result ;\nthis could only be done |\n:\u00bby orcing upon the marker some arbitrary specijic convention\nbased on a preliminary study of the material. For example, I might\nnotice that there was a large number of keys drawn among the sets\n0 Fxpt. IV, as was the case, and then suggest or insist that keys\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 81\nI\nshould be given a point for, let us say, Castle ;\nthis, if followed,\nI\nwould lead to a number of unjustifiable winning hits being recorded ;\nbut a general instruction such as \u2018\nclearly identifiable parts of objects\nshould be treated as if the whole object were drawn \u2019\ncould do no\nharm ;\nfor there is evidently no reason why such a riile should\nI\nincrease the proportion of hits registered on originals in the series at\nwhich percipients were aiming {i.e. \u2018\nwinning hits \u2019\nor \u2018\nwinners \u2019)\ncompared with those on series at which they were not aiming\n(\u2018 losing hits \u2019\nor \u2018\nlosers \u2019), and it is by the relative frequencies of\nthese, not by the total number of hits of all kinds, that the issue\nmust be judged.\nOn the other hand, it behoves us to frame our rules with intelli-\ngence, because, if we make them too lax, we shall tend to blur\nwhatever pattern the data might otherwise reveal, while, if we make\nthem too stringent, we shall risk having no pattern to blur. Thus,\nif we gave a mark to Arrow for every drawing with a straight line in\nit (\u2018 straight as an arrow \u2019), and one to Shell for every drawing with\na curly line in it, we should be likely so to overweight these two\noriginals with marks as completely to swamp out the kind of thing\nwe are looking for ;\nwhile if we insisted on a drawing being an exact\npoint to point counterpart of the original before giving it a mark,\nwe should ensui'e a perfectly null residt by being unable to award any\nmarks at all.\nOur business, clearly, is to steer between the two extremes by\nframing the simplest set of common-sense rules we can, and to leave\nthe doubtful cases to the discretion of the marker aided by whatever\nsuggestions of a general or non-tendentious character we can supply.\nI shall refer again shortly to the instructions and guidance actually\nused, but the underlying principle remained substantially that given\nabove, namely :\n\u2018\nStick to the obvious ;\navoid the recondite ;\ngive\none mark for a palpable hit, nothing for a miss, and half a point if\nthere is real doubt \u2019. Thus three degrees of resemblance were\nrecognised\u2014hit, miss and doubtful\u2014compared with the eleven\npermitted in the method of decimal scoring.\nIn the interests of sensitivity I also decided that all drawings must\nbe marked against all originals, within any self-contained group of\nexperiments,^ as opposed to working by pairs of series of originals\nas I did with the preceding method. This involved trying to bear the\nfifty originals in mind at once, or else adopting the terribly tedious\n1 1 shall discuss elsewhere the question of what is to be done when we are\nlealing with isolated experiments, or small groups ;\none cannot go on marking\nall drawings against all originals indefinitely, nor can one be sure of always\nhaving a suitably sized group within which to work.\n\f82 Whately Carington, 31.

For a statistical test we must\ntake accoimt of all hits, whether \u2018\nwinners \u2019\nor \u2018\nlosers \u2019, within the\ngroup concerned, before we can decide on the likelihood of the\nobserved pro])ortion of winners being the result of chance alone.\n31afheniatical Treatment. Tlie statistical treatment necessitated\nby the method does not, fortunately, involve any very recondite\nprocess : indeed, the hrst stage is a matter of no more than common i\nsense arithmetic. VVe will suppose that an unbiassed judge has\n'\ngiven us the number of hits scored by all the percipients of each\nexperiment on the originals of tliat experiment and of all others in\nthe group considered ;\nthat is to say, the number of hits scored by\nall drawings on all originals, suitably subdivided under experiments.\nA certain numljer of these will be \u2018\nwinners \u2019, namely those scored by\nthe percipients of any particular experiment on the originals used in\nthat experiment, and the remainder will l)e \u2018\nlosers \u2019. Our task is\nfirst to calculate, from the empirical data provided, how many\nwinners we should expect, and then to apply a test of significance to\nshow how likely it is that the observed number differs from the\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 83\nexpected number as much as it actually does (or more) if this\ndifference were the result of chance alone.\n^\nIn dealing with the first of these stages we ignore \u2018\nmisses\n\u2019\naltogether ;\nfor these are of no more interest to us than would be\ncalls of \u2018\nspade \u2019\nor \u2018\nclub \u2019\nby a percipient trying to guess cards in a\npack consisting (unknown to him) solely of hearts and diamonds.\nAll we are interested in is the question of whether percipients tend\nto draw Hands, Horses, Violins, Scissors, Trees, etc., significantly\nmore often when these objects are represented among the originals\nused in the course of an experiment than when they are not, and the\nfrequency with which they draw armadillos, razors, kite-balloons,\nor other objects which have not been presented at all, can throw no\nlight on the problem.\nNow suppose, for the sake of illustration, that our judge has given\na grand total of 1,000 hits by all drawings on all originals, and that\nthese include 25 hits on Boat ;\nand suppose also that 400 hits of one\nkind or another were scored by the percipients aiming at the series\nof originals in which Boat appeared. It is clearly no more than a\nmatter of the simplest sort of proportion sum to ascertain how many\nof these 400 hits may be expected to be Boats, if chance alone is\noperative. For we have just found that boats make up twenty-five\nthousandths of all hits, or 2-5%, and on the chance hypothesis there\nis no reason for supposing that this proportion will be greater or less\nin any particular sample we may happen to choose ;\nso we should\nexpect to find 2-5% of 400, namely 10 Boats, appearing among the\ndrawings of the percipients in question. But precisely the same\nreasoning will apply to the series of originals used in any experiment,\ntaken as a whole, as applies to any particular original within it,\nexcept that we shall use the attribute of \u2018\nbeing like one of the\noriginals of such-and-such an experiment \u2019\ninstead of the attribute\nof \u2018\nbeing like the original Boat \u2019\nin making our calculation. For\nexample, if 280, or 28%, of the total hits recorded were on the\noriginals of Expt. I, and the percipients of that experiment scored,\nas before, 400 hits on the originals of all experiments together, we\nshould expect 28% of 400, or 112, to be the number of hits scored\nby these percipients on their own originals, if there were no factor\nother than chance tending to make them score more. Repetition\nof the process for all experiments gives us the total expected number\nof \u2018\nwinners \u2019.\nIf we find that the observed number of winners is considerably in\nexcess of the expected number, we shall have grounds for suspecting\nthat the chance hypothesis is insufficient to account for the facts,\nand that the frequency with which drawings representing the various\n\f84 Whately Carmgfon, M.A., M.Sc. [part\noriginals appear is not independent of whether these originals\noccurred in the series at which the percipients were aiming. But\nwe cannot form an accurate j\nudgement until we have determined the\n\u2018\nvariance \u2019\nof the expected number, that is to say, a quantity which\nserves as a measure of the extent to which the theoretically calculated\nexpectation is likely to vary under chance conditions, and accord-\ningly affords a means of judging whether any actually observed\ndeviation therefrom is likely to be due to chance alone.\nThis is not such a simple matter as that of determining the\nexpectation, and the interested reader should refer to Mr Stevens\u2019\npaper, \u201c Tests of Significance for Extra Sensory Perception Data,\u201d\nPsychol. Rev., Vol. 46, No. 2, March 1939, where it is shown that the\nvalue of the variance, a\u201c, is given by an expression of the form\nl\u2018l\n6\ni I\n.\nI\n+ N2 . S {a,hj) - N . S {np,) {a^ -f h,-),\n}\nwhich is not, in practice, nearly so formidable to deal with as it\nappears. From this quantity we derive the Standard Error (cr) of\nthe Expectation, by taking the square root ;\ndividing this into the\nobserved excess of winners we obtain the value of the \u2018\nnormal\ndeviate \u2019, whence, by reference to the appropriate Tables in the usual\nway, we find the probability of such an excess, or a greater, arising\nas a result of chance alone. An example will be shown worked in\nfull when I come to discuss the outcome of the experiments as a\nwhole. A discussion of the applicability of Mr Stevens\u2019 method to\nthe present problem, by Dr Trwin and Mr Glatty, together with a\nphysical analogy due to Professor Broad, will be found in Appen-\ndix V.\nMarlxing the Drawings. Meanwhile we must consider the very '\nimportant matter of how the drawings were in fact marked, and the\nprecautions taken to ensure that the data to be used in subsequent\ncalculations were wholly or substantially unbiassed.\nTo start with, all drawings were marked against all 50 originals\nl)y myself. This was done partly as a matter of exploration, in\norder to see whether the method seemed promising, and partly to\nfind out at first hand what sort of difficulties or ambiguities were\nlikely to be encountered. I did this work as carefully and con-\nscientiously as I could ;\nbut, since I knew which drawings were\naimed at which originals, the highly significant result I obtained\ncannot be accepted as reliable evidence. I do not think I erred in\nthe direction of giving winning points where none were deserved\n\u2014\nthat, I found, was fairly easy to avoid ;\nbut it was only natural that,\nknowing a given batch of drawings to have been aimed at a particular\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 85\nseries of originals, I should have other series less prominently in\nmind than this, and should thus tend to miss a certain number of\n\u2018\nlosers \u2019\nwhich a wholly uninformed judge might find. On the other\nhand, since I had drawn 30 of the 50 originals myself, and had\nassisted H.S.C. in the preparation of the remainder, it is reasonable\nto suppose that I was in a better position than any outsider to know\nwhat the agent actually had in mind at the time, and thus whether\nany particular drawing successfully reproduced it ;\nand this might\nwell be of importance from certain points of view. Be this as it\nmay, however, my own markings must evidently be ruled hors\nconcours : they are given below as a matter of comparative interest\nonly and no conclusions are based on them.\nFor the next, and alkimportant, stage I was so exceptionally\nfortunate as to secure the help of Mr M. T. Hindson, the value of\nwhose contribution to the work cannot be overestimated. Mr\nHindson not only had the leisure and critical interest necessary for\nundertaking the task of marking, but had pursued until recently the\ncareer of Bank Inspector\u2014a vocation well calculated, one may\nsuppose, to promote just those qualities of objective judgement and\nindifference to tedium wdiich are most necessary here. To say that\nI am very deeply indebted to him is seriously to understate the case,\nfor without his aid the work might well have come virtually to a\nstandstill for lack of a suitable judge. As it was, his marking,\ncarried out under carefully planned and maintained conditions of ig-\nnorance, yielded a highly significant result of the utmost importance.\nThe 50 originals were given to Mr Hindson arranged in alphabetical\norder, that is to say randomised or shuffled from the point of view' of\ndeciding wdiich belonged to wdiich experiment ;\nand I was careful\nto remove completely, by cutting off the tops of the sheets, such\nnumbers or letters as had been used at earlier stages, which might\npossibly have identified certain originals as belonging to the same\nexperiment.\nInstructions w'ere contained in a \u2018\nGuide to Scoring Hits \u2019, whicli\nseems of sufficient importance, in the circumstances, to be w'orth\nreproducing as Appendix IV. This \u2018\nGuide \u2019\nw'as supplemented by\na number of \u2018\nNotes on Originals \u2019, which was intended to draw'\nattention to various points I had noticed in the course of my owui\nmarking. The idea, which Mr Hindson adopted, was that the judge\nshould go through the Notes first, before tackling the work of\nmarking, and make up his mind w\u2019hat policy he would adopt with\nregard to each of the points indicated, before actually meeting with\nthem, so as to reduce the risk of varying his standard in the course\nof the w'ork.\n\f86 Whafehj Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nIn })reparing these notes, I was careful always to use either an\ninterrogative or an imj)erative form, in drawing attention to the\npoints raised, in order to avoid giving any suggestion as to how I\nthought they ought to be dealt with.

These Notes are given in full in Appendix IV.\nI hope I need hardly add that, when I discussed the matter with\nMr Hindson, I was most scrupulously careful not to say anything\nthat could possibly be interpreted as a specific recommendation, in\nrespect of any original or type of drawing, one way or the other.\nI must add that Mr Hindson specifically authorises me to say,\nwhich is imjmrtant, that he had no clue, at any time during the\nmarking, as to which Originals corresponded to the various batches\nof drawings submitted to him, and that neither my written instruc-\ntions or verbal comments influenced him in any way towards\nassigning marks to drawings in respect of one Original rather than\nanother.\nIn other words, he did the marking completely \u2018\nblind \u2019\nin every\nrelevant sense, so that his results may be accepted as wholly without\nbias, and I venture to assert without much fear of contradiction that\ndata obtained under these conditions cannot plausibly be assailed\neven by the most exacting criticism. I accordingly take Mr\nHindson\u2019s figures as fundamental in the whole of the investigation\nof this group of exjieriments that follows. Only these figures, be it\n\f162]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 87\nnoted, and such others as may be derived from them by rigidly\nobjective processes, are eligible for consideration from the strictly\nevidential point of view ;\nand only results obtained from them will\nbe claimed as evidence : though, as we shall see later, figures\nderived from other judgements, into which subjective factors might\ntheoretically be supposed to have entered to some extent, if in\npractice they probably or apparently did not, may be of considerable\ninterest from the standpoint of information as opposed to evidence.\nAlternative Markings : The next points I wish to discuss will be\nbest understood if I describe the circumstances which gave rise to\nthem.\nWhen the drawings of the first experiment, with their assigned\npoints, were returned to me by Mr Hindson, I found that he was\nmarking on a very much more generous scale than I myself had done ;\nfor on these 37 sets he had given a total of 272-5 points where 1 had\ngiven only 93-0\u2014a ratio of almost exactly 3 to 1. This meant that\nhe had been using a very much lower standard, or \u2018\nlevel of accept-\nance \u2019, than I had used ;\nbut it did not, of course, mean that his\nmarking was necessarily in any sense \u2018\nworse \u2019\n(or \u2018\nbetter \u2019) than\nmine, for the optimum standard to adopt for detecting a real effect,\nif there is one, can clearly only be found by experiment. It might\nquite well happen, indeed\u2014and apparently does\u2014that many\nresemblances much less noticeable than those which I myself would\nreckon as \u2018 palpable hits \u2019\nare yet to some extent inspired, so to say,\nby the originals and, if this were so, a standard of marking which\ncounted them would be preferable to one that did not. But at the\ntime in question I was full, to the point of obsession, with the idea\nthat it was very important to keep the standard as high as possible ;\nthis was partly in reaction from the disaj)pointing results of the\nMethod of Decimal Scoring, in which marks so low as one tenth of\nthe maximum could be given for faint resemblances and associations,\nand partly because I knew from my own marking that the use of a\nlugh standard would lead to significant results.^ It was not\nunnatural, therefore, that I became apprehensive lest the adoption\nof so much lower a standard might result in a serious and possibly\nfatal dilution of the effect I had good reason to suppose was there.\n^ I suppose I must point out here that the fact of my own marking being\ninadmissible as strict evidence in favoiu\u2019 of the occurrence of a real effect,\ndoes not render it useless as a guide ; on the contrary, the fact that it was\nvery carefully and conscientiously done by the person who knew more than\nanyone else about the originals might well compensate for the possibilities\nof unwitting bias already mentioned. I knew very well that though I could\nnot claim it as evidentially rigid, there was uncommon little wrong with it.\nw.w.c.\n\f88 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nI accordingly asked Mr Hindsoii to raise his standard somewhat 1\n1\nin future, and at the same time I cast about in my mind for some ,\nmethod of eliminating the feebler resemblances, if need be, on as\nobjective a basis as possible.^ I\nAs regards the first, I may say that Mr Hindson adjusted himself !\nto my demands with great success ;\nin marking Expts. II to IV B, !\nhe gave 57(b0 points as compared with my 466 -0, which is a ratio of i\nonly about 1-25 to 1.\n*\nAs for the second, I finally decided on the plan of picking out all\nthe drawings on the marking of which Mr Hindson and I did not\nexactly agree ^ and submitting them to independent arbitration. ;\nThis seemed the best practicable expedient in the circumstances,\nwhich were intrinsically somewhat difficult (August 1939), even '\nthough it was not absolutely rigid evidentially, for reasons which I i\nshall discuss in a moment. I wanted, first of all, to be quite satisfied\nin my own mind that the residts of the marking I had done were not\ndue to pathological aberrations on my part ;\nso that in the event of\nMr Hindson\u2019s nrarking yielding null results I could be reasonably |\nsure that this was due to his employing too generous a standard and |\nnot to there being notliing to detect. If, on the other hand, Mr\nHindson\u2019s unarbitrated marking were to lead to a significant positive 1\nresult (as it did) no harm would be done ;\non the contrary, a very\napproximately rigid alternative assessment of this kind, using an\napjireciably higher standard than Mr Hindson\u2019s, could hardly fail\n|\nto be of considerable interest from the comparative point of view.^\nThere are two reasons why these arbitrated figures may not be\nperfectly rigid. First : It might be suggested that I myself, wittingly\nor unwittingly, had marked potential winners with generosity and\npotential losers with meanness. If this were so. and if, as was the\ncase, Mr Hindson marked much more generously all round, the result\nwould be that relatively few potential winners would come up for\narbitration, because he would have passed most of my judgements ;\nbut there would be many potential losers, because I should have\ndisagreed in advance with his losing selections. If then, as was also\nThis raising of the standard could not affect the evidential value of the\nresults obtained, hut it was unquestionably an error as regards extracting the\nmaxiniura of information from the material.\n- I.e. including those to which one of us gave a full mark and the other a\nhalf, as well as those to which one gave a full or half mark and the other\nnothing.\n3 External circumstances, I may remark, made it imjrracticable to postpone\naction until after all Mr Hindson's figures had been received, collated and\ncomputed.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Dratvings 89\nthe case, the arbitrators were urged to adopt a high standard, these\nlosers would be extensively rejected. As a result, the j^roportion\nof winners would be unfairly inflated. This supposition is contra-\nindicated by the evidence. Mr Hindson\u2019s 1,209 original entries\ncontain 280 or 23T6% potential winners, while the 934 entries sub-\nmitted for arbitration contain 213, or 22-81 ;\nthe difference is\ntrivial by inspection.\nSecond : Professor C. D. Broad and Professor H. H. Price very\nkindly consented to do the arbitrating. Of these, the former had\nconsiderable knowledge of the originals, though the latter had not,\nand it is not altogether impossible that this knowledge might have\nintroduced some slight measure of unconscious bias into some of the\njudgements. But this also lacks material support. If such a\ntendency were appreciably operative, we should expect to And\nProfessor Broad giving considerably more points to winners and\nfewer to losers as compared with Professor Price. There is a very\nslight tendency to this effect to be observed in the 586 cases in\nwhich independent judgements from both are available ;\n^ but when\nthe figures are tested for significance by the ordinary 2x2 method,\nwe And that a discrejiancy as large as that observed, or larger,\nwould occur a shade more often than not by the operation of chance\nalone.\nWe may accordingly conclude that, although the arbitrated\nfigures are not evidentially impeccable, they are none the less\nentirely satisfactory for all practical purposes, and may be safely\nused wherever information rather than the highest grade of evidence\nis in question ;\nfor the latter, we may rely on the unarbitrated\nHindson figures and their derivatives.\nDerived Figures : I have already pointed out that a genuine effect,\nif present, might be obscured by either too generous or too strict a\nstandard of marking, and a moment\u2019s reflection will show that there\nmust be some optimum standard which will bring out to the best\nadvantage whatever effect there may be. It is clearly of consider-\nable practical interest to ascertain, if we can, whether we are\napproximating to this optimum, or whether, in future work, we\nshould do better to employ appreciably higher or lower standards.\nThis can, of course, only be done by varying the standard in both\ndirections and seeing whether the best result (after making due\nallowance for differences in the size of the sample) lies between these\nlimits. It is fortunately possible to do this very easily, and perfectly\n^ Professor Price was unfortunately unable to complete the whole of the\nwork. For the latter part of Expt. IV A and the whole of IV B, the onus of\narbitration fell on Professor Broad alone.\nF\n\f90 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nobjectively, in the case of any set of data scored on the full mark,\nhalf mark, or zero method ;\nfor changing all half marks into full\nmarks will give us the effect of using a lower standard, while changing\nthem into zeros will be equivalent to raising the standard. In the\none case we treat all doubtful assessments as full fledged winners,\nwhich may weil be over-generous ;\nin the other we treat them all as\nmisses, which is likely to err on the side of strictness.^ These\nfigures, which will be discussed in due course, were easily obtained\nfrom the original Hindson data, but to obtain the arbitrated figures\nand their derivatives called for considerable care and labour in\ntabulation and checking.\nTabulation, etc. : I began, as already implied, by preparing lists\nof all drawings about which Mr Hindson and I did not exactly agree ;\nbut to these I added a considerable number about which we did\nagree, either because I was not altogether confident that even our\nagreed judgement was sound, or because it seemed to me that our\npolicy had not been wholly consistent. From these lists, after the\narbitrators had recorded their judgements on them, I prepared\nSummaries of Arbitration \u2019\nfor the drawings of each experiment\nin turn. Each such summary show'ed, for the drawings of the\nexperiment concerned as compared with each of the 50 originals,\n(a) the number of hits on the origitial as agreed by Mr Hindson and\nmyself and not submitted to arbitration, (b) the number of drawings\nsubmitted which were unanimously discarded by the arbitrators,\n(c) in detail, the mark given by each arbitrator to those drawings\nthey did not unanimously discard, and (d) the lower of these two\nmarks, if different. This last was because it was agreed at the time\nthat, in the interests of conservatism \u2019\nand to maintain a high\nstandard, the lower of the two arbitrations should be taken ;\nbut\nthere was, of course, nothing binding or sacrosanct about this\ndecision, and I shall also give the results obtained by taking the\nhigher of the two : note that, since there was only one arbitrator\nfor the latter part of IV A and the whole of IV B, the \u2018\nhigh \u2019\nand\nlow arbitrations are identical in this region. From these Sum-\nmaries it was easy enough to extract the requisite information,\nnamely the number of hits scored by the drawings of each experiment\non the originals of their own and of the other exjieriments.\nW hen I had done this, I retabulated the wdiole of the data de novo,\non a larger and more elaborate scale, in a kind of Master Table\narranged by Originals in alphabetical order instead of by Experi-\nments in chronological order, and showing every entry made by\n* Mutatis mutandis, a similar procedure may be applied to all data obtained\nfrom a graduated system of marking.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 91\nMr Hindson or myself and the j\nudgements of both arbitrators whether\nunanimous or not. By collecting the same figures from this Table\nas from the Summaries and comparing the two, I was able to detect\nany discrepancies there might be and to track them to their origin.\nAt the same time I checked through all the arbitrators\u2019 decisions\n(and a great many of Mr Hindson\u2019s and my own) with a view to\ndetecting inconsistencies of marking. A few instances were found\nand submitted to Professor Broad for a ruling, which was then\napphed to all relevant cases. A few more drawings were discovered\nwhich had somehow managed to slip through the net, e.g. had\ninadvertently been omitted from arbitration ;\nthere were not more\nthan ten or a dozen of these, and nearly all could be conhdently\nmarked by analogy with others of the same kind on which the\narbitrators had given decisions ;\nin only some three or four cases\nwas I obliged to rely on my own judgement, and in these I was\ncareful, so far as was compatible with common sense, to weight the\nmarking against rather than in favour of the effect looked for.\nThus the arbitrated figures, while lacking the perfect evidential\nrigidity of the Hindson unarbitrated, represent the product of an\nextremely careful and conscientious attempt to form considered\ncomposite judgements, using a somewhat higher standard than\nMr Hindson, on the part of judges who, where they had knowledge\nthat might bias the result, did their best to discount it. For certain\npurposes, such as determining the magnitude of the effect at the\nlevel of acceptance adopted, these figures, despite their lack of\ncomplete rigidity, are preferable to any single judgement however\n\u2018\nblind \u2019\nit may have been.\nTo Sum up : The Method is based on the very simple plan of\nmarking all drawings against all originals, giving a full mark if a\ndrawing plainly resembles any original, nothing if it does not, and\na half mark if there is real doubt. Mr Hindson had no kind of clue\nas to which drawings were aimed at which originals, so that his\nfigures and their derivatives may be taken as completely rigid. The\narbitrated figures, though theoretically less perfect, are practically\nreliable and amply good enough for informative purposes.\nSECTION IV\nResults\nA. Main Results\nla. Calculation of the Main Results from the Hindson original\nFigures : We are now in a position to approach the central and\n\f92 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\ncrucial point of the whole enquiry, namely the question of whether\nor not percipients tend, to a significant extent, to score relatively\nmore \u2018\nhits \u2019\non the originals of the experiment in which they are\nengaged than they do on those of experiments in which they are not\nengaged.\nThe simple mathematical technique necessary for this purpose\nhas been discussed above, and we will start by applying it to Mr\nHindson\u2019s unarbitrated and unmodified figures. These are shown\ntabulated in the appropriate manner at the top of Example I, p. 132,\nwhere the whole calculation is given in full.\nThis Table should be interpreted as follows : When the originals\nwere removed from the alphabetical sequence in which they had\nbeen given to Mr Hindson and were regrouped according to the\nexperiments in which they were used, it was found that the drawings\ndone by the percipients of Expt. I had been credited with 5T5 hits\non the originals used in Expt. I, with 77-5 on those used in Expt. II,\nwith 36-5 on those of Expt. Ill, with 25-0 on those of Expt. IV A,\nand with 82-0 on those of Ex])t. IV B, making a total of 272-5\nassorted liits by these percipients. Similarly the percipients of\nExpt. II scored 7-0 hits on the originals of Expt. I, 18-0 on those of\ntheir own experiment, 12-5 on the originals of Expt. Ill, and so on\nthroughout the Table, which shows a grand total of 848-5 hits scored\non all originals l)y all percipients put together. Alternatively, we\nmay read along the lines instead of down the columns to the effect\nthat the originals of Expt. I had 51-5 hits scored on them by the\npercipients of Expt. I, 7-0 by the percipients of Expt. II, 5-5 by those\nof Expt. Ill, and so forth, showing a total of 127-5 scored on them\naltogether. Either w'ay, it is clear that the figures in the diagonally\nplaced cells, set in heavy type, are the \u2018\nwinners \u2019\nin which we are\ninterested, while all the others are \u2018\nlosers \u2019. Summing the figures\nin the diagonal cells, we find 201-5 as the total number of winners\nscored ;\nbut this is of no use to us unless we also know (a) how many\nwinners we should expect to find, given the known number of hits\nby each group of percipients and on each series of originals, if chance\nalone were operative, and (6) the extent to which this expected\nnumber is likely to vary under these conditions.\nRecapitulating an earlier passage, we know that 127-5 hits out\nof a grand total of 848-5 are scored on the originals of Expt. I\n;\nthat is to say, the fraction\n127-5\n848-5\nof all hits. Since, on the null\nhypothesis, there is no reason to suppose that one group of perci-\npients would score relatively more or less on these originals than\nany other, we should expect this fraction of the total hits scored by\nI\nI\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 93\nany group of percipients to be hits on the originals of Expt. I.\nparticular, we should expect\n127-5\n848-5\nof 272-5 to be the number\nIn\nof\nhits scored on the originals of Expt. I by the percipients of Expt. I.\nThis comes to about 41 hits expected, so it is clear that, in this case,\nexpectation has been handsomely exceeded. Thus, to find the\nexpected number of winners in any case, we multiply the appropriate\ncol umn total by the corresponding row total and divide the product\nby the Grand Total. ^ But since we are only interested here in the\ntotal expected number of winners, and not in the expectation in\neach experiment separately, it is quicker to multiply the column and\nrow totals in pairs, sum the products, and divide the sum by 848-5.\nThis is shown in the first step of the Example, where it will be seen\nthat the sum of the products concerned amounts to 138,545-25\n;\ndividing this by 848-5 we find the total expected number of winners,\nE\u201e\u201e to be 163-28. Subtracting this from 0\u201e\u201e the observed number,\nwhich we have already found to be 201-50, we obtain for D, the\ndifference between them, a value of 38-22. That is to say, according\nto Mr Hindson\u2019s marking, the percipients have succeeded in obtain-\ning between them some 38 more hits, or 23%, on the originals at\nwhich they were aiming than we should expect them to do if chance\nalone were responsible. This sounds very fairly impressive, but\nwhether it really is so, or whether it is the kind of fluctuation\nwe might reasonably expect under chance conditions, cannot be\ndecided until we have found the appropriate measure of chance\nfluctuation, namely the variance, in the manner already indicated.\nWe start by summing the corresponding column and row totals\nin pairs and then multiply each of these sums, a + b, by the pre-\nviously determined product ah, thus obtaining a new series of\nproducts ah{a + h), which are listed in the Example and have a total\nvalue of 57,863,437-000. The work of calculating the variance is\nthen more or less self-explanatory. We write down the square of\nthe sum of the ah products and add to it the result of multiplying\nthe sum of those products by the square of the total number of hits ;\nfrom this we subtract the sum of the compound products ab{a -f h)\nmultiplied by the total number of hits. Dividing this by N^(N - 1)\n1 It should be noted that this procedure automatically allows for the\nvarying \u2018 popularity \u2019\nof the originals of the different experiments ;\nfor this\nis measured empirically by the total number of hits scored on the originals\nconcerned by all the percipients taken together, i.e. by the marginal totals\n127-5, 181-0, etc., and the expected numbers calculated are proportional to\nthese. Mutatis mutandis, the same is true of the differing numbers, or\nactivity, of the percipients in the various exjjeriments.\n\f94 Whately Carington, M.A., M.8c. [part\ngives us the variance, n-, whicli we find comes to 114-468. Taking\nthe square root of this gives the Standard Error, a, of 10-699, and\nwlien we divide this into the value of 38-22 already determined for D,\nwe obtain a \u2018\nnormal deviate \u2019, D\/n, of 3-572 ;\nthat is to say, the i\nobserved deviation of 38-22 hits in excess of expectation is more (\nthan three and a lialf times its standard error. Reference to the\nappropriate Tal)les, and interpolation, shows that a deviation of this\nmagnitude or greater mag be expected less than once in a thousand such\ncases, or about once in 2,944, as the result of chance alone.\nThe result is highly .significant, and the chance hypothesis would be\nregarded as disjjroved in any normal context. I\n16. Main Results from Ilindson 'derived' figures: We may\nnext ap]dy precisely the same method to the figures derived from I\nMr Hindson\u2019s original data (a) by turning all his half points into i\nfull points, that is, by treating all his entries as of equal value,\n(6) by counting all his half points as zeros {i.e.\n'\nmisses \u2019) and using j\nonly those entries to which he gave a full point in the first instance.\nAs already observed, these figures are every whit as rigid evidentially i\nas the unmodified version, but correspond to a lowering and raising 1\nof the standard in the two cases respectively. For comparison, we\nwill also work two results of some interest from the half points taken ;\nby themselves and treated simply as \u2018\nentries \u2019. There is no need\nto tabulate these data in full, or to reproduce the calculations, which\nexactly follow the jmocedure of Example I. ;\nThe results are of consideralde interest, particularly when com- i\npared with that already olitained, which is included in Talde 4 below\nfor ease of reference. The successive lines of the Table show :\nThe total number of points given, the expected number of \u2018\nwinners \u2019,\nthe observed number, the difference between these, the value of\nthe normal deviate, the proliability of such a difference (or a greater)\n|\narising liy chance alone, and the difference expressed as a percentage i\nof the total number of points, the use of which I shall explain later. !\nTable 4\nHalf and Full Points Half Points only\nHalves Halves\nas As as All Rejected\nWholes ^\nMarked Misses Halves Halves\nN 1209 848-5 488 721 546\n227-01 1 63-28 100-62 128-90 93-76\n280 201-5 123 157 110\n1) 52-99 38-22 22-38 28-10 16-24\nD\/o- 4-166 3-572 2-772 2-924 2-043\nP< -000,1 -001 -01 -01 -05\n1()()D\/N 4-383 1-501 4-586 3-897 2-974\n1 These are laiowa as the \u2018\nAll Entries \u2019\nfigures and arc extensively used\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 95\nIt wll be seen that all the first four results are handsomely\nsignificant, and that the effect of lowering the standard is to push\nthe value of P beyond the one in ten thousand point. No one can\nreasonably ask more from a test of significance than this, and the\nsupposition that the observed excess of winning over losing hits is\ndue to chance may be dismissed with considerable assurance.\nI hope no one will imagine that the foregoing treatment of the\nmaterial is no more than an illegitimate monkeying with the data\nundertaken with a view to extracting a more impressive significance\nfrom them than they properly contain. My object is, rather, to\nthrow light on the method of assessment adopted, both intrinsically\nand as handled by Mr Hindson ;\nand this, I think, the figures given\nsucceed in doing with some success.\nIt is at once evident from an inspection of the Table that I\nmaligned Mr Hindson in suspecting that he w^as using too low a\nstandard, and that I was wrong in supposing that a very high\nstandard was necessary or even desirable ;\non the contrary, as will\nbe seen, the improbability of the result being due to chance alone\nis raised more than ten-fold by ignoring the difference between half\nand whole points and treating all entries as of equal importance, as\nis done in the first column of the Table.^ If, on the other hand, we\nthrow the half points out altogether, as under \u2018\nHalves as Misses \u2019,\nthe significance is greatly diminished. So it is clear that the halves\nmake a very useful contribution to the result instead of being, as I\nhad feared, a dangerous diluent. Moreover, if we separate out the\nhalf points and treat them simply as \u2018\nentries \u2019, by themselves, as is\ndone under \u2018\nHalf Points Only : All Halves \u2019, we find that they yield\na strongly significant result. Finally, even those half points which\nwere rejected by myself and at least one arbitrator as not up to so\nmuch aiS \u2018\ndoubtful \u2019\nby our standard (\u2018 Rejected Halves \u2019\nin the\nTable) give a result just better than the conventional level of\nsignificance.\nWe are accordingly led towards the very interesting conclusion\nthat the process of cognition involved is not an all or none affair,\nbut that, on the contrary, the more remote resemblances may often\nrepresent just as genuine an effect as the closer, even if it be more\ndifficult to detect. But before accepting this conclusion, even\nprovisionally, there are two possibihties which must be considered.\nFirst : May it be that the drawings receiving half points are\nlargely those which are badly drawn? I am fairly sure that this is\nbelow. For this reason, and as a matter of interest, details of the data,\nwith the various expectations and differences, are given in full in Table I,\np. 134, q.v.\n\f96 Whately Carington, 31. A., 31.Sc. [part\nnot the case, though I do not see how I could easily justify my\nbelief. But it is scarcely more than a matter of common sense to\nrealise that the veriest scrawl of a Tree, a Boat, a Jug, an Anchor,\na Balance, a Cow, a Butterfly, and so forth, will be unmistakeably\nrecognisable, which is all that is necessary to gain a full point.\nMoreover, the instructions (q.v.) were explicit as to disregarding\nlack of skill in draughtsmanship and, I am confident, were duly\nfollowed. The situations which led to the giving of half points were\nrather those in which it Avas necessary to decide whether the clearly\ndepicted object was near enough to the original in nature to justify\na point being given. For examples : Is the outline of a Latin\nCross to be given anything for Flag, in which a cross is the most\nconspicuous feature? Should a snail have a point for Shell?\nShould a steamer, or a roAving boat, or a gondola, have one for Boat?\nWhat sort of leaves are like enough to those in Exfoliate to justify\na point? In very many cases such as these the judge would end by\ngiving a half point ;\nand it is they, together with a certain number\nof vague, as opposed to ill-executed, drawings which are mainly\nresponsible for the large number of half-point entries.\nSecond, there is the possibility that Mr Hindson may have been\nexceptionally chary of giving full points at all, and may have\ndiffidently given half points where a less cautious marker would have\ngiven Avholes. I think I am prepared to go so far as to say that this\nis quite definitely not the case. Mr Hindson gives a total of 488 full\npoints ;\nI ap])ear to have given 453, so that he is slightly more lavish\nthan I am\u2014not less\u2014though only by about 7-1%. On the other\nhand, only 175 of his 721 half points surAuve arbitration at all, and\nonly 5 are converted by the arl)itrators into full points ;\nso he clearly\nhas not marked a large number of \u2018 palpable hits \u2019\ntoo low. What\nhe has done is to be appreciably more generous in the mattw of full\npoints than I, and to give no fewer than 721 half points to my 212.\nThis is in no sense a reflection on his marking, which, in my opinion,\nwould be difficult to improve upon. On the contrary, because he\nAA^as quite free from bias, as no one AA\u2019ho \u2018\nkneAv the answer \u2019\ncould\npossibly be, and could approach the AA\u2019ork Avith a free and open mind\ndevoid of guess-foTinded obsessions, he was able to recognise a large\nnumber of resemblances AAdfich I aa^us afraid to admit for fear of\n\u2018\ndilution \u2019, though they were in fact to an important extent non-\nfortuitous.\nOn the other hand, his half-point entries are of a lower quality,\nas is to lie expected, than his full-point ;\nand it Avill be well to devote\na few paragra])hs to this question of \u2018\nquality \u2019\nbefore we go on to\ndiscuss the arbitrated data.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 97\n2. Measures of Quality : At the beginning of an investigation of\nthis kind we are, very properly, chiefly interested in deciding whether\nany real effect occurs at all ;\nbut as soon as our basic experiments\nhave given a sufficiently significant result to satisfy us, even\nprovisionally, that this is the case and that there is something worth\nstudying in our material\u2014and we may certainly claim to have\nachieved this here\u2014we shall want to answer questions of a much less\nsimple character. For example, we shall want to know whether\none group of percipients is relatively more successful than another,\nwhether women do better than men, and so forth. In all such cases\nit will often be necessary to use some measure of success which is\nindependent of the total number of hits recorded, for in general this\nwill merely be proportional to the number of percipients concerned.\nAt the moment, it would be of interest to know whether some stan-\ndards, or methods of judging, are more efficient than others, in the\nsense of enabling us to select from the raw material a group of\ndramngs containing a higher ratio of genuinely cognised specimens\nto fortuitous resemblances, as opposed to being merely more effective,\nin the sense of yielding a higher level of significance.\nFor it is not to be imagined that all \u2018\nwinner \u2019\nresemblances,\nhowever close, in a sample showing a significant result, however\nhigh, are necessarily the result of genuine cognition ;\nsome are, we\nmay be sure, for otherwise the significant result woidd not be\nobtained, but others will be purely fortuitous, and I see no means at\npresent of telling which are which with any kind of assurance. And\nit might well be of importance, for some pur])oses, to employ\nmaterial having the highest possible ratio of genuine to fortuitous\nhits.\nNow it is easy to see that, if there is a real effect, then of two\nsamples of different sizes but identical constitution the larger will\nshow the higher significance, simply because it is larger ;\nindeed, a\nlarge sample of low quality may even prove more significant than a\nsmall sample of higher quality. To a close approximation, if there\nis a real effect and N is large, the effect of multiplying the size of the\nsample by n, will be to multiply the value of the normal deviate by\nJn ;\nthus, we may reduce two samples of different sizes to level\nterms by dividing the normal deviate in each case by ,yN. But\nthis gives a result approximately proportional to D\/N. It is for\nthis reason that I have here adopted the percentage of excess\nwinners, lOOD\/N, as the most appropriate criterion of quality to\nuse here.\nReferring now to Table 4, let us see what light this throws on what\nhas been going on. In the first place, we see that, although the\n\f98 Whately Garingion, M.A., M.Sc. [pabt\nsigniHcance falls as the standard is raised, the quality rises ;\nbut the\nrise over the first three columns is very small, and some way from\nsignificance, fliough in the expected sense. This would appear to\nimply that the full ])oints given are not worth very much more than\nthe half points, and to a certain extent I think this is true ;\nfor I\nhave the im])ression that some of Mr Hindson\u2019s full-point markings\nwere a trifle optimistic, and we shall see later that a considerably\nhigher value of Q (as I may conveniently call all such measures of\nquality) is obtained from those full-point entries of which no one\nconcerned had any doubts. On the other hand, we find a noticeable\ndrop in quality, as we should expect, when the half points are\nisolated and treated by themselves, and this is still more marked\nwhen we consider only the halves rejected by the arbitrators.\nFrom these facts we may fairly confidently draw the following\nconclusions, which are not without importance :\n1 . 1 he cognitive process involved is not of an all or none character.\nThat is to say, it may manifest itself in the production of drawings\nwhich are by no means umnistakeable likenesses of the originals\n(witness : All Halves \u2019) and even in such as bear what many people\nwould consider no more than faint resemblances to them (witness ;\n\u2018\nRejected Halves \u2019).\n2. The lower limit of useful resemblance, if I may put it so, is\nprobably being approached by Mr Hindson\u2019s more optimistic half-\n])oint markings ;\nfor the Rejected Halves, of which we have the very\nconsiderable number of 54(1, only just creej) over the conventional\nsignificance level. If the standard were to be made much lower, it\nseems probable that either there would be no effect at all, or at best\nthat serious dilution \u2019\nwould begin to set in. I may easily be wrong\nhere, and further work alone can show where, if anywhere, the\nidtiniate effective hmit lies ;\nbut at present it looks as if the mesh of\nMr Hindson\u2019s net had been cunningly chosen so as to bring in pretty\nwell all the worth-while fi.sh.\n3. The fact that the values of Q vary just about as we should\nexpect them to do goes some way towards assuring us that the effect\nis a well-behaved citizen of the scientific world ; it would have been\nvery disconcerting if we had found, for example, that the fainter\nresemblances were of higher quality than the stronger!\n3. Main Results from Arbitrated Figures : As I have emphasised\nabove, results obtained from the Hindson unarbitrated figures are\nalone to be regarded as completely rigid from the strictest point of\nview ;\nbut, for reasons explained, the arbitrated figures have certain\nmerits of their own. Since the process of arbitration has already\nbeen fully described, we may proceed at once to the results, which\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognitiori of Drawings 99\nare given in Table 5 below. To the arlhtrated results proper I have\nadded, as a matter of interest, those obtained from my own mark-\ning and by treating all entries, whether by Mr Hindson or myself,\non the same lines as in the first column of Table 4 : these must be\ntreated as suspect, and no conclusions are based on them. The\ncalculations were, of course, as shown in Example I.\nTable 5\nW.W.C. and Arbiti\u2022ated Full\ntv.w.c.

But note also\nthat these values are fractionally exceeded l)y the \u2018\nHigh \u2019\narbitrated\nfigures ;\nas there is no real reason for suspecting these at all seriously,\nit looks as if my efforts to discount my own bias had been reasonably\nsuccessful and that the second alternative exerted (as I personally\nbelieve) an appreciable influence on the outcome.\nSince there is nothing to choose so far as I can see, between the\nHigh and the Low versions of the arbitrated figures, except that the\nlatter is the more \u2018\nconservative \u2019\n\u2014which is not necessarily a virtue\n\u2014I have given, at the bottom of the Table, values of P and Q\nobtained from the means of the two sets of figures. It will be\nnoticed that they closely agree with the unmodified Hindson figures\nas regards significance, but achieve this result with the use of only\n\f100 Whntely Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\n522 points (mean) instead of 848-5 ;\nthat is to say, the quality of\nthe sample obtained by the exercise of collective judgement is better\nthan that from a single marker. This is only what one would expect,\non the general ground that two heads are better than one ;\nbut it\nmay be of some practical importance. It suggests the possibility\nthat the best way to extract tlie most significant result from a given\nnumber of drawings may be to employ a plurality of judges working\nto a low standard rather than a single judge working to a high\nstandard, and to test successively the data on which they all, all\nbut one, all but two, etc., agree\u2014thus finding empirically the\noptimum cut-off point, which is presumably that at which good\nresemblances begin to pass into fanciful.\n4. Summary : The results just discussed, above all those of\nTable 1 ,\nare of fundamental importance to the whole enquiry. They\nshow clearly that it is in a very high degree improbable that the\nobserved excesses of winning over losing hits are due to chance alone.\nIf chance alone were operative, we should expect to find such a\nresult as that of the Hindson \u2018\nAll Entries \u2019\noccurring on the average\nonly once in some thirty-three thousand similar groups of experi-\nments. It is accordingly very unlikely that we are being led astray\nby fortuitous resemblances. Sceptics must either find a flaw in the\nexperimental procedure or conditions of marking, or show (which\nseems to me an impossible task) that the antecedent improbability\nof such a phenomenon is at least comparable with the figure just\ngiven, or take refuge in avowed intransigeance. Meanwhile, we may\nregard the occurrence of a genuine cognitive process under the\nconditions described as provisionally demonstrated, to a point\nwhich amply justifies continued study and repetition by others of\nexperiments of the kind described.\n\\\\ e also conclude that the cognitive process is not of an all or none\ncharacter, so that comparatively remote resemblances may be\ngenuine in the sense of being non-fortuitous ;\nand that, consequently,\nthe use of a very high standard is not necessarily the best way of\nseparating the wheat from the chaff.\nB. Displacement\n1. General\n:\nThe apparent tendency for an original to be repro-\nduced by the percipient on some occasion other than that on which\nit was exposed was noted in the first experiment and has already\nbeen mentioned. If this apparent tendency is real (as we shall see\nthat it is) there can be no doubt that it is a matter of the first im-\nportance. If it occurs in one direction only, namely that of making\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 101\nthe reproduction appear after the occasion of exposure of the\noriginal, there would be a suggestion that the impression received\nmay require some period of gestation in the subconscious before it\ncan emerge into consciousness and be recorded, or perhaps that it\nonly emerges when some relevant extraneous stimulus gives it the\nnecessary fillip ;\nand either of these or similar conclusions would\nbe of appreciable psychological interest. But if it occurs in the\nopposite sense, so that reproductions tend to appear before the\nexposure of the originals which they resemble we should be con-\nfronted (in so far as the effect was significant) with empirical evidence\nof a new type for the occurrence of a phenomenon of a precognitive\ncharacter ;\nand this would be of the very greatest interest from all\nmanner of viewpoints beside the purely psychological.\nThe matter is accordingly one which must be investigated with\nthe utmost care and rigour, and it will be well to begin by clearing\nthe air of one or two potential misconceptions.\nThe one thing we must not do, of course, is to claim as precognitive\nevery resemblance ^ that occurs before its original and as retro-\ncognitive every one that occurs after it ;\nfor this would be merely\nbegging the question. In other words, we must decide before we\nstart on what the words precognitive and retrocognitive may\nreasonably and usefully be supposed to mean.\nIt is, as usual, a matter of observed as compared with expected\noccurrences. We can usefully and validly speak of retrocognitions\nonly if we find a number of resemblances, significantly greater than\nthe hypothesis of chance would lead us to expect, on some date or\ndates later than the relevant event ;\nand vice versa for precognitions.\nBeyond this we cannot safely go before we have studied the facts,\nthough our general experience might lead us to expect a continuous\nfalhng off in the frequency of the resemblances as the remoteness\nfrom the event increases. And we should have no right to complain,\nif some to be surprised, if it were found that the falhng off were of a\nperiodic or fluctuating character. But our general knowledge of\nthe way in which all kinds of phenomena occur suggests that, if\npre- and retro- cognition be both phenomena of nature, the relative\nfrequency of hits on a given original is likely to increase as the\noccasion on which a drawing was made approaches that on which the\noriginal was displayed, to reach a maximum at or near the coincidence\nof the two, and to fall off again as the former recedes from the latter.\n^ The words \u2018\nresemblance \u2018\nreproduction \u2019\nand \u2018\nhit \u2019\nmay be regarded as\ninterchangeable and as denoting a drawing sufficiently like an original to have\nbeen scored by the judge. The degree of resemblance does not concern us\nat this stage.\n\f102 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part N\nOur business therefore is to calculate from the observed data the 1\n1\nnumber of hits expected to occur on occasions one, two, three, etc.,\nplaces before, and one, two, three, etc., places after, the event\n1\n1\nconcerned, namely the exposure of an original, and to compare these l\ncalculated values with the numbers actually observed.\n2. Illustration of Procedure : To illustrate the procedure, which |\nbecomes lal)orious when large numbers of occasions and originals\nj\nare involved, we will take the relatively simple case, of no special \\\nimportance intrinsically, of the originals and occasions of the first\nexperiment.^\nThe tabulated data and the results of the calculations are shown in\nExample II, p. 13.3, the first part of which should be read as follows :\nOn the first occasion one hit was scored on the first original (Bracket),\non the second and third occasions no hits, on the fourth occasion one\nhit, on the fifth two hits, etc., ... a total of 7 \u2018\nhits \u2019\nor resemblances <\nto the original Bracket being found among the drawings of the first\nexperiment percipients. Or alternatively : Among the drawings\ndone on the first occasion there were found one resembling Bracket,\none resembling Buffalo, none resembling Fess or Hand, two resem-\nbling Cross-stitch, etc., etc., ... a total of .5 hits on one or other of\nthe originals of Expt. 1 being found among the drawings done on\nthe first occasion.\nIt will at once be realised that the figures in the \u2018\nleading diagonal\n\u2019\nshown in heavy type, represent the numbers of hits scored on the\nseveral originals on the occasions on which they were exposed ;\nthat\nis to say, liits not dis])laced in either direction but coinciding with\nthe event\u2014or, more accurately, occurring within the period of\nexposure, which constitutes coincidence for our purpose. It is also\neasy to see that the next diagonal upwards and to the right, parallel\nto the leading diagonal, contains the numbers of hits scored on the\noccasion immediately after the event, of which there were one for\nBuffalo, one for Hand, two for Cross-stitch, two for Bottle, etc. ;\nwhereas the diagonal l)elow and to the left of the leading diagonal\nshows the numbers of hits scored on the occasion immediately before\nthe event, of which there were only one for Buffalo, one for Bat and\ntwo for Net. Similarly, as we proceed outward from the leading\ndiagonal, we find diagonals containing the numbers of hits scored\non the second, third, fourth, etc., occasions before or after, as the\ncase may be, that on which the original they resemble was exposed.\nOur task is to determine whether there is any significant tendency\nfor the observed numbers in these diagonals to exceed their\n* I again use the Hindsoii \u2018\nAll Ihitries \u2019\ndata, and shall do so henceforward\nunless otherwise expressly stated.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 103\nexpected values as we approach the leading diagonal from either\ndirection, or both.\nThe procedure is simple enough in principle, and is basically the\nsame as that which we adopted for obtaining the expected numbers\nof hits on the originals of a particular experiment by the drawings\nof that experiment when we were calculating the main results, q.v.\nThe number of hits to be expected in any \u2018\ncell \u2019\nor compartment\nof the 10 X 10 Table of Example II is obtained by multiplying\ntogether the two marginal totals concerned and dividing the product\nby the total number of hits. Taking the extreme bottom left-hand\ncorner as an example, we note that only one hit was scored by these\npercipients on the original Anchor, being 1\/81 of the total ;\nalto-\ngether, five hits were scored on these ten originals on the first\noccasion ;\nso, if no cause other than chance is operative, we should\nexpect the same proportion of Anchors among these first occasion\nhits as in the total, viz. 1\/81, from which it follows that the actual\nexpected number of hits will be 5\/81, or -062. In practice, of\ncourse, one cannot have -U62 of a hit, and the expectations in\nindividual cells are far too small to be useful or interesting, but this\ndoes not affect the principle involved. Eor the next diagonal nearer\nthe centre, the expectation vdll be (3 x 5)\/81 for the Beetle cell, and\n(1 X 7)\/81 for the Anchor cell, making a total of 22\/81, or -272. In\nshort, to determine the expected number of hits in any diagonal we\nsum the products of the successive pairs of marginal totals concerned\nand divide by the total number of hits in the Table. When we do\nthis, we obtain the figures given under E in the lower part of the\nexample, where \u2018\nDiagonal - 9 \u2019\nmeans the diagonal containing the\nhits made nine places before the original to which they refer, and so\nforth. 0 is the observed nimiber of hits in these diagonals, as may\nbe verified from the Table, while the quantity (0-E)\/ .yE gives a\nmeasure of the deviation from expectation, reduced to a standard\nlevel, on the hypothesis that chance alone is responsible for the\ndistribution in the various diagonals.\nThe Example, as I have said, is only illustrative of procedure\nand I do not propose to discuss the not very interesting results in\ndetail here. The only points worth noting are, first, that the\nobserved number of hits of zero displacement, i.e., made on the same\noccasion as that on which the origmal was exposed, is fractionally\nbelow expectation, instead of being handsomely above as we might\nperhaps have expected from the fact that the experiment as a whole\nscores 16-54 hits above the expected value ;\nsecond, that, although\nthe quantities (0-E)\/\\\/E are distressingly ragged and not very\ninformative as they stand, they do contrive to show a noticeable\n\f104 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [PAET\n\u2018 peak \u2019\nat diagonal 2, while the observed numbers are greater than j |\nexpectation in the positive (retrocognitive) part of the Table and less\nin the negative (precognitive part) ;\nthese last two facts accord,\nthough somewhat feebly, with the qualitative impression first\nformed to the effect that hits tended to be deferred. The difference i\nmay be attributed to the fact that the impression was formed on\nthe basis of the stronger resemblances only, whereas the data of\nExample IV include the feebler.\n3. Compilation of the 50 x 50 Table : As a matter of historical fact,\nI first satisfied myself that there was a displacement effect worth\ninvestigating by a study, on the lines indicated above, of the inter-\nexperiment data given in Table I, p. 134, but it will be more con-\nvenient to defer consideration of these for the present and to pro-\nceed at once to the crucial large-scale investigation of all occasions\nand all originals taken together.\nThis involved the preparation of a 50 x 50 Table, a task which\nwas complicated by the fact that in all cases except Expt. II it was\nnecessary first to \u2018\ndecode \u2019\nthe random numbers which had been\ngiven to the 1,209 drawings involved for use in connection with the\nmatching technique. In this Table the cross-headings of the rows\nfrom top to bottom were the fifty originals in the order in which they\nwere exposed in the five successive experiments, and the headings\nof the columns from left to right were the fifty successive occasions\non which drawings were made in these experiments. In each cell,\nformed by the intersection of a row with a column, was entered the\nnumber of drawings, made on a certain occasion, which the judge\nhad assigned to a certain original. Nothing would be gained by\npresenting the full Table here, particularly as we are not interested\nin individual cells, the expectations for which I have not calculated,\nbut oidy in the total numbers expected and observed in the diagonals.\nNor do I think it would be worth while to give full details for all the\n99 diagonals ;\nbut Table II shows an illustrative sample consisting\nof three groups (the second, central and last but one, counting from\nthe extreme bottom left-hand corner of the 50 x 50 Table) of nine\ndiagonals each, and the sub-totals for the remaining eight groups of\nnine into which the 99 diagonals may conveniently be divided.\nThis will be sufiicient to show the procedure adopted and the kind\nof results obtained. It should be noted that the values of\n(0- E)\/.,yE and of given in the lines for Sub-totals are obtained\nfrom the sub-total values of 0 and E, and not by summing the\nresults for individual diagonals ;\nthat is to say, in computing these\nquantities, the data are pooled for each group of diagonals.\nIt will be seen that the individual values of (0- E)\/.^E, in which\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 105\nwe are chiefly interested, are distinctly irregular ;\nbut the sub-totals\nleave Uttle doubt as to what is going on.\nNote, however, before we pass on to discuss these, the very\nremarkable \u2018\ndip \u2019\nat the centre (diagonal 0), with \u2018\ntwin peaks\n\u2019\neither side of it at - 2 and 2. We will discuss the significance and\ninterpretation of this at a later stage, but we may note here that the\npeak at diagonal 2, where there is an excess of no fewer than 19-384\nhits over expectation, is very definitely significant even in the\ncontext of 98 other diagonals, for the value 4-269 gives P less than\n-000,02, and even the symmetrically placed peak at - 2 passes the 1\nin 4,000 mark.\nTo bring out the salient features to better advantage, I retabulate\nthe Group Sub-totals in Table 6 below, and show the values of\n(0-E)\/^E plotted in Figure I.\nTable 6\nGroup (0-E)\/VE\n-5 -1-031\n-4 -1-973\n-3 -1-678\n_ 2 \u2022524\n-1 1-186.\n0 3-873\n1 \u2022760\n2 - -922\n3 -1-262\n4 - 2-083\n5 - -542.\nPrecognitive Groups.\nRetrocognitive Groups.\nThe null hypothesis is, of course, to the effect that no diagonal or\ngroup of diagonals is more likely than another to show an excess\nor deficit of hits as compared with expectation. According to this,\nthe values of (0 - E)\/ ^\/E should be randomly distributed about a\nmean of zero with unit standard deviation. This, by inspection,\n1 The quantity sJE is, of course, only an approximation to the standard\nerror of (0 \u2014E). For the extreme case of a diagonal containing only a single\ncell, it is clearly very nearly true, since the probability of a hit falling in it\nis so small ;\nfor the leading diagonal of the whole 50 x 50 Table it is 4-883,\nwhile the exact value of the standard error, calculated by Mr Stevens\u2019 formula\nis 4-764. The discrepancy is negligible, but on the safe side in the sense of\ntending to make the values of (0 - E)j>JE, and consequently of somewhat\ntoo small. On the other hand, it should be noted that the values of are\nnot necessarily strictly additive, since the distributions in the various diagonals\nmay not be independent. This, however, will not affect the implications of\nthe highly systematic arrangement of the points in Fig. I.\n\f106 Whately Garington, M.A., M.Sc. [part ^\nthey quite evidently are not, so that we hardly need the value of \u2018\nI\n32-09 for S(y^), which gives P just beyond the -001 level of signi- <\nficance, to tell us that the hypothesis is untenable. Moreover, j\ndeviations from expectation are very fairly symmetrical, as may be\nseen at a glance from Figure I, so we may conclude that the pre-\ncognitive effect is just about as strongly indicated as the retro-\ncognitive.\nj\nIf we wish to satisfy ourselves as to the significance of the two |\nsides separately, we may conveniently group the diagonals in seven\ngroups of seven on each side of the leading diagonal and find the\nvalue of tS(y^) with 7 degrees of freedoni in each case. This gives\nCuriously enough, the precognitive effect, which most people\nwould consider the less probable antecedently, appears to be the\nmore strongly marked, or at least soniewdiat the better substantiated.\n4. Introduction of the Quantity A : The quantity (0-E)\/^E is\nadmirable for testing significance, but has certain disadvantages\nfrom other points of view. Since, from the nature of the calcula-\ntions, the total observed and expected frequencies must be equal,\nit follows that any excess of the first over the second in one region\nmust be balanced by a deficiency in another. Thus the fact that\nthe line in Fig. I goes iq) to a ]:>eak in the middle necessitates a\ndepression or depressions at one end or both ends ;\nconsequently\nthe line is unlikely to represent to the best advantage the true\nrelation between displacement and incidence of hits.\nIt would clearly be a matter of the greatest general interest if\nwe could estaljlish this relation definitely ;\nif, that is to say, we\ncould determine the \u2018\nlaw \u2019\nconnecting the magnitude of the real\neffect with disjilacement. This might well throw light on the\nnature of the process involved, or at least enable us to say that the\nfacts are inconq^atible wdth certain hypotheses. But before we\nmake even the most tentative steps in this direction we must be\nclear in our minds as to the senses in which we are using the terms\n\u2018\nmagnitude of effect \u2019\nand \u2018\ndisplacement \u2019.\nIf we were dealing, let us say, with magnetic phenomena, there\nwould be little room for ambiguity ;\nthe \u2018\nmagnitude of effect\n\u2019\nwould be measured by the pull in dynes exerted by one magnetic\npole on another or on a piece of iron, and \u2018\ndisplacement \u2019\nwould be\nthe distance in centimetres lietween the two, and we should have\nlittle dilficulty in ascertaining that the one varied inversely as the\nPrecognitive side\nRetrocognitive ,,\nS (x\")\n20-979\nJ 4-481\nP\n\u202201\n\u202205\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 107\nsquare of the other. In this case there is no \u2018\nmagnitude \u2019\nof this\nnature that we can measure ;\nthe phenomenon is a matter of the\nrelative frequencies with which hits occur in different positions with\nrespect to the originals on which they are made, and it is in terms\nof such frequencies, therefore, that we must conduct our study.\nThe question of \u2018\ndisplacement \u2019\nis not quite so simple, for we may\neither consider order alone, without reference to time, as we have\ndone hitherto ;\nor we might transform the horizontal scale of Fig. I\ninto a true time scale {e.g. astronomical time) and work in terms of\nthat. For the present, I shall continue to use the bare order, mainly\nbecause it is simplest and has yielded a reasonable looking arrange-\nment of points ;\nbut it will be necessary, sooner or later, to substitute\nthe mean values of the astronomical time intervals as abscissae, and\nto try to determine whether these, or order alone, are most relevant\nto the facts. ^\nIn these circumstances, the ideal would be an empirically deter-\nmined measure of the probability of a hit occurring on an occasion\nat any given distance (measured in terms of order) from the original\nconcerned ;\nwe could then test various hypotheses regarding the\nnature of the phenomenon, leading to correspondingly different\ntheoretical relations between probability and displacement, and see\nwhether some were signihcantly more compatible with the facts than\nothers.\nAnother way of approaching the point is to suppose that, in\ngeneral, it is easier for the percipient to score hits on the originals\nnearer to the occasion on which he is working than on those more\nremote, and to enquire how \u2018\neasiness \u2019\nvaries with \u2018\nremoteness \u2019\n;\nfrom this point of view it should at once be clear that the only\npossible measure of \u2018\neasiness \u2019\nis the relative frequency with which\npercipients do in fact, on the average, score hits at different remote-\nnesses, other things being equal.\nThe sting of this is found in its tail, for our chief difficulty lies in\nthe fact that other things are very far from being equal. In the first\nplace, of course, the numbers of occasions of different type vary\ngreatly ;\nthat is to say, with fifty originals, there are fifty occasions\nof zero displacement, 49 each with displacement plus one or minus\none, 48 of displacement plus or minus two, and so on down to only\none each with a displacement of plus or minus 49 positions. This\nwould not matter particidarly if equal numbers of liits were scored\non all occasions and on all originals ;\nall we should have to do would\n^ At a guess, and as a matter of rash prophecy, I have little doubt that it\nwill not be astronomical time that will be found most relevant ;\nbut I do not\nwish to embark on an examination of this point at the present stage.\n\f108 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nbe to divide the number of hits occurring on each class of occasion\nby the number of occasions in that class (i.e. by the number of cells i\nin the appropriate diagonal of the 50 x 50 Table), and this would i\ngive us a series of numbers representing the relative frequencies of\nhits with respect to displacement, whicli is what we want.\nUnfortunately, from this point of view, originals differ very\nwidely in po^iularity, in the empirical sense that some are drawn very\nmuch more often than others. Moreover, the number of percipients\nworking on different occasions may also vary between wide limits\nwhile neither the \u2018\nmarkability \u2019\nof their attempts nor the generosity\nof the judge can be assumed constant. Clearly, we shall have to\nmake allowance for all these factors in attempting to estimate the\nquantity in which we are interested.\nNote before we go on that any diagonal, e.g. of the 50 x 50 Table, i\nor of Example II, is built up, so to say, of the hits scored on a\nnumber of different occasions and on an equal number of different\noriginals ;\nthe common feature is that all the occasions are displaced\nto the same extent from the original on which the hits are scored.\nConsider in Example II, for instance, the \u2018 plus 2 \u2019\ndiagonal,\n|\nwhich is that starting in the top line and the third colmnn, running\ndownward and to the right, terminating opposite Net, and reading\n.4 2 1 1 3 3 2. Each of these entries represents the number of\nhits scored two occasions later than the original concerned ;\nbut\nboth the occasion and the original necessarily vary from entry to\nentry. Thus, no hits are scored on Bracket on the third occasion,\nwhich is two occasions later than that on which Bracket was used\nas an original, while 4 were scored on Buffalo on the fourth occasion,\nwhich is two occasions after that on which Buffalo was used. But\nBuffalo was much more popular than Bracket (15 hits altogether as\ncompared with 7), while the percijhents of the experiment scored\naltogether 10 hits of sorts, on the originals of the experiment, on the\nfourth occasion as compared with five on the third. This should\nserve to make it clear why, in considering the relative merits of\ndifferent positions considered qua displacement, we must correct the\nobserved absolute number of hits, not only for the number of\noccasions of each type considered but also for the \u2018\npopularity \u2019\nof\nthe originals and the \u2018\nactivity \u2019\nof the percipients concerned. The\nfirst of these terms is self-explanatory, and is measured by the total\nnumber of hits made on the relevant original ;\nby the second I refer\nto the combined effect of all those factors mentioned above which\ntend to increase or diminish the total number of hits scored by the\npercipients of that occasion on all originals, and is measured by that\nnumber.\n\f162] Experimeiits on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 109\nNow it is evident that any increase in these numbers is likely to\nresult in a proportionate increase of hits in the \u2018\ncell \u2019\nor diagonal\nconcerned, quite apart from its displacement ;\nhence, as we are here\nonly interested in the last named variable, the sensible thing to do\nis clearly to divide the observed number of hits in any cell by the\nappropriate \u2018\nactivity \u2019\nand \u2018\npopularity \u2019, or the number of hits in\nany diagonal or group of diagonals by the mean values of these, as\nwell as by the number of cells. This will give us an estimate of what\nthe number of hits per cell would have been if all the originals\nconcerned had been of equal popularity and all the occasions pro-\nductive of equal activity. For any diagonal, then, our estimate\nwill be\nObserved number of hits\n(Number of cells) x (Mean Activity) x (Mean Popularity)\nand since Mean Activity and Mean Popularity are found by dividing\nTotal Activity and Total Popularity by the number of relevant\nOccasions and Originals respectively, each of which is equal to the\nnumber of cells, this reduces to\n(Observed number of hits) x (Number of cells)\n(Total Activity) x (Total Popularity)\nThe terms in the numerator need no expansion ;\nthose in the\ndenominator are obtained by summing the relevant marginal totals\nof the Table concerned, for relevant Occasions and Originals\nrespectively. Thus for the -f2 diagonal of Example II, we have\n8 cells and 16 hits ;\nthe relevant occasion totals are 5, 10, 10, 7, 10,\n6, 9, 12, giving a Total Activity of 69 ;\nand the relevant original\ntotals are 7, 15, 4, 9, 16, 9, 9, 8, showing a Total Popularity of 77.\nHence the value of our estimate. A, is (8 x 16)\/(69 x 77) or -024.\nThe values so obtained are not probabilities ;\nbut they may be\nregarded without much risk of being misled as measures of or indices\nto them, so that we may conveniently regard as proportional\nto the frequency of hits that would have occurred on an occasion r\nplaces distant from that on which the original concerned was used\nif all originals had been equally popular and all occasions equally\nactive.\nIn Figure II, I show the values of A corresponding to those of\n(0-E)\/,yE in Fig. I, for the eleven groups of nine diagonals each.\nIt wall be seen that, as we should expect, the general tendencies are\nvery similar to those of Fig. I ;\nbut we can now say definitely that,\nignoring for the moment the upward twists at the ends, the pro-\nbability of scoring a hit on any original, other things being equal.\n\fWhately Caringfoti, M.A., M.Sc.\n1 10 [part\nincreases as the occasion of display ap])roaches, reaches a maximum i J\nin the near neighbourhood of that occasion, and diminishes as it '\nrecedes.

Summary and Comments : I fear I cannot claim that the\nforegoing has done more than scratch the surface of the enormously\nimportant subject of Dis])lacement. We have, to be sure, esta-\nblished beyond any reasonal)le doubt (if the authenticity of the data\nbe accepted) that displacement does occur in both the precognitive\nand retrocognitive senses, and this is a far from trivial conclusion.\nNot oidy is it likely to have interesting repercussions in the cosmo-\nlogical held and for ])sychology generally, but it affords a basis for\na plausilde explanation (other than fraud, mal-observation, etc.) of\nwhy there has been such difficulty in securing reliable repetition of\ncard-guessing experiments. Displacement is easy enough to detect\nby inspection when we are dealing with drawings of Buffaloes, Hands,\nGuns or Windmills, which cannot well be intended for anything\nelse ;\nbut the successes of a percipient guessing Zener cards, for\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawmgs 111\nexample, who consistently scored high, but a place or two early or\nlate, might easily escape notice unless specially searched ford\nOn the other hand, the number of questions we are not yet able\nto answer is legion. For example : Is the \u2018\ncentral dip \u2019, referred\nto on p. 105, genuine or chance determined? (Probably genuine.)\nAre the upward twists at the ends of the (0 \u2014 E)\/.yE and A\ncurves genuine, and do they foreshadow lateral maxima? (With\nconsiderably less assurance, I think they probably are and do ;\nbut this is almost entirely based on inspection.) Is the asymmetry\nof these curves genuine? Does the retrocognitive side decline to\na higher \u2018\nfixed value \u2019\nthan the precognitive? (Probably \u2018\nYes\n\u2019\nto both these.) Is the peak for the whole curve, neglecting any\nlocal disturbance due to the central dip, significantly displaced in\neither direction? (Probably not.) Have the curves substantially\nthe same shapes for strong and weak resemblances? And for near\nand distant percipients? Is bare order, or astronomical time, or\nsomething that we might describe as \u2018\nrelevant psychological time\u2019\nthe proper basis for the horizontal scale?\nProbably in all these cases, and undoubtedly in some, we could\nobtain a certain amount of information by an intensive analysis of\nthe existing data ;\nbut I think it will be better to defer the investiga-\ntion of these questions until more material is available, or iintil\nfurther consideration of other points has suggested the most profit-\nable lines of attack.\nSECTION V\nKesults of Control Marking\n1. General\n:\nWhen the results described in the preceding Section\nbegan to emerge\u2014particularly, of course, the Main Results of\nTable 4 and those for Displacement embodied in Fig. I\u2014it was\nsuggested that it might be of considerable interest, as a matter of\ncomparison, if a \u2018\ncontrol \u2019\nmarking of the same drawings against\ndifferent originals could be arranged, and this suggestion was\napproved by those most closely associated wdth the work. This\n^ It is very gratifying to find that a scrutiny of some of Mr Soal\u2019s results\nfrom this point of view shows clearly that such an effect was very significantly\npresent in some of his subjects. Such confirmation of the effect, coming from\na completely independent worker, using entirely different material, a different\nmethod, and different percipients, constitutes as strong supporting evidence\nas could well be desired ;\nand, of course, reciprocally.\nFor these results, see Mr Seal\u2019s paper in this number of Proceedings.\n\f112 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nwas not because any of those concerned had detected, or thought , ij\nlie had detected, any flaw in the procedure adopted, which is, *\nindeed, logically impeccable. But it was felt that logical impecca-\nbility is not the only means, or even always the best means, of I\ncommanding assent and allaying doubts ;\nand there was also, of l\ncourse, the theoretical possibility that the combined intelligences\nof Professor Broad, Dr Thouless, I)r Irwin, Mr Gatty and myself, not\nto mention others who had considered the problem, had failed to\nnotice some serious methodological fallacy. This did not seem very\nprobable ;\non the other hand many people would consider the\nresults obtained to be also not very probable, and I think we were\nall agreed that we should feel easier in our minds\u2014even though we\nmight not be able to give logical iustiticatioii for it^\u2014if a control\nmarking were to be carried out and were to yield null results.\nFor this pur])ose we were so fortunate as to secure the co-operation\nof Mr H. F. Saltmarsh, to whom I am very much indebted for his\nlabours in this connection.\n2. Procedure : For the purpose of this control a fresh series of\nfifty originals (or perhaps I should say \u2018\npseudo-originals \u2019) was I\nused. These were drawn by my friend Mrs Aletta Lewis, to whom\nI am very much obliged for undertaking the work, and were primarily I\nintended for use in the next experiment of the series, which lies i\noutside the scope of this report. Inasmuch as some of them have I\nbeen and others may be used for experimental purposes it would be\nundesirable to mention their nature here ;\nit is sufticient to say that\nthey were drawn in Indian ink on white paper in the same general\nstyle as the true originals, that they did not duplicate any of these\nused in Expts. I to IV B, that their subjects were selected by a\nstrictly random method from a list of 216 possibilities submitted by\nme to the artist, and that they represented on the whole, rather\nmore everyday objects than did those already described. The\nfollowing are the points relevant to the present issue.\nAs received from the artist, each original was enclosed, in accord-\nance with my instructions, in a separate envelope and further\nprotected Ijy a sheet of j3aper against its nature being inadvertently\nascertained in the course of ordinary handling. The envelopes\nwere shuffled by Dr Dingwall and myself, and ten of them were\ndrawn at random for use in the further experiment mentioned above.\nThese w'ere later returned to the pack, so to say, and the whole 50\nwere re-shuffled by Dr Dingwall, who then opened them one by one,\ncalling out the title of each to me as he did so. It was agreed that\nthe first ten thus arbitrarily selected should be deemed to be the\noriginals of the first experiment for the purpose of the control\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 113\nmarking ;\nsimilarly, the second ten were allocated to the second\nexperiment, the third ten to the third, and so forth. The allocations\nthus determined were listed by me at the time of selection under the\nheads of Expt. I, Expt. II, etc., in Dr Dingwall\u2019s presence, and\ninitialled by us both. All this was to guard against the possibility\nthat, in the event of the control yielding a null result, as I confidently\nand rightly expected that it would, someone might suggest that I\nhad arranged the pseudo-originals so as to secure it. As a matter\nof fact, it would be extraordinarily difficult to devise a better\nmethod of arrangement from this point of view than the shuffling\nprocedure actually adopted, as a moment\u2019s reflection should show,\nbut there seemed no harm in adopting a full precautionary ritual.\nThe pseudo-originals were then re-arranged in the alphabetical\norder of their titles, just as had been done with the true originals\nsubmitted to Mr Hindson, and were sent to Mr Saltmarsh in this\norder. I also sent him, by instalments, the same 2,193 drawings\nwhich Mr Hindson had marked against the real originals ;\nthat is to\nsay all the drawings of Expts. I to IV B.\nAs regards instructions, these were substantially identical with\nthose given to Mr Hindson ;\nand the reservation \u2018\nsubstantially \u2019\nis\nmade only because, as reference to Appendix IV will show, it was\nnecessary to alter or delete a few words here and there, in the \u2018\nGuide\nto Scoring Hits \u2019, which would otherwise have indicated that it\nreferred to originals other than those submitted. Apart from these\ntrifling alterations, which were made in consultation with Dr\nDingwall, the instructions issued were identically similar in the two\ncases ;\nbut the \u2018\nNotes on Originals \u2019\nwere naturally not sent, nor\nwas it thought necessary to fabricate a corresponding document.\nNeedless to say, Mr Saltmarsh was not told that he was engaged\non a control or dummy experiment ;\non the contrary, by a piece of\ninnocently ambiguous verbiage such as is frequently necessary in\nthis class of work, I was at pains to convey the impression that he\nwas repeating rather than paralleling the work of an earlier marker.\nThe scoring sheets, showing half and whole points awarded to the\nvarious originals in respect of the drawings, were sent direct to\nDr Dingwall, and the data necessary for working the \u2018\nAll Entries\n\u2019\nfigures, corresponding to the most important main result obtained\nfrom Mr Hindson\u2019s marking, were extracted by us together. The\nremainder of the work was done by myself alone ;\nbut the original\nscoring sheets and the relevant calculations are, of course, available\nfor inspection if desired.\n3. Results : As was expected, the results were, if not quite \u2018\nicily\nregular \u2019, at any rate \u2018\nsplendidly null \u2019. In Table 8 below I give\n\f114 Whafely Caringfon, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nthe values of D\/ct and of P for what 1 may term the four main modes\nof scoring, together with the corresponding figures for Mr Hindson\u2019s\nmarking against the true originals, taken from Table 4 for ease of\ncomparison.\nTable 8\nMr Hhidson Mr Saltmarsh\n(Experiments) (Control)\nD\/(7 P D\/o- P\nFull points only 2-772 <-01 - -613~-54\nHalf \u201e \u201e\n\u2018\n2-924 <-01 -1-699 \u2014-09\nAll Entries 4-166 <-000,1 -1-.318--19\nScore ^ 3-,572 <-001 - -984- -33\nThere is evidently nothing at all significant about the control\nfigures.

Testing in the usual way, I\nfind an initial variance of 8-1210 ;\nreduction of variance associated\nwith the first two parameters of the regression line, 3-8610 with\nmean 1-9305 ;\nresidual variance 4-2600 with mean 0-5325 ;\nvariance\nratio 3-622 (n^ = 2, ^2 = 8) ;\nP>-05 or about -1.\nThat is to say, the Displacement results, like the Main results,\nshow nothing at all that is not quite easily explicable on the hypo-\nthesis of chance.\n4. Comments : Some readers may be inclined to think that this\nprocess of control marking was no more than a gratuitous waste of\nMr Saltmarsh\u2019s time and my own ;\nthat it did no more than\nexemplify the obvious by showing that if you carry out a random\nprocess properly you will obtain a random result ;\nand that it no\nmore illumines the questions at issue than making ten thousand\nthrows with a substantially true die would illumine the question of\nwhether another was loaded. Math such critics I have the liveliest\nsvmpathy, for these were precisely my own reactions when the\nproject was first mooted. But I am now inclined to think that these\nreactions, though natural, were wrong, and that the procedure,\nthough emphatically a psychological luxury rather than a methodo-\nlogical necessity, has a rational justification and a positive value\ngreater than meet the superficial eye. Here are my reasons.\nI implied just now that it would be waste of time to do a long\nseries of throws with a substantially true die as a check on one which\nhad shown significant bias. That is true, l)ut it is only true because\nwe know a great deal from practical experience about the behaviour\nof dice ;\nit would emphatically not be true if no one had ever thrown\na die before, and if all we had to go upon were an \u2018\nintuitive \u2019\ncon-\nviction that because the thing was a cube it \u2018\nmust\u2019, ipso facto,\nbehave in a particular way ;\nthis would be just as rash, in principle,\nas to conclude that because a steel needle is symmetrically suspended\nin a mechanical sense it \u2018\nmust \u2019\nbe indifferent to its orientation ;\nwhich is false if it happens to be magnetised.\nNow the application of statistical methods {i.e. of probability\ntheory) to any experimental data is no more and no less than the\ntransference to one type of empirical situation of systematised\nknowledge gained originally from experience of other empirical\nsituations ;\nfor there are no such things, as was once erroneously\nsupposed, as god-given a priori probabilities. And if the situation\n\f116 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nto which the methods are applied is not strictly analogous in its\nrelevant features to those on which our theory was based, the\ntransfer may be illegitimate, things may go wrong, and invalid\nconclusions be drawn. In most cases we are on reasonably safe\nground, for common experience tells us that the behaviour of, for\nexample, properly made cards or dice, approximates sufficiently\nclosely for all practical purposes to that of the idealised versions\nusually postulated by theory. But it is not the less important to\nrealise, as a matter of principle, that the assumptions we may then,\nquite legitimately, proceed to make are ultimately based on practical\nexperience and reasoning therefrom by analogy, not on any kind\nof divine right. Usually, of course, our \u2018\nintuitive \u2019 judgements, to\nthe effect that in the absence of some systematic cause one thing is\nas likely to happen as another, will be reliable ;\nat any rate in so far\nas they are expressions of properly assimilated if previously unfor-\nnndated experience. But it would clearly be imprudent to rely on\nthem too implicitly, or to pursue the chain of analogical reasoning\ntoo far ;\nconsequently, there is nothing to be lost and a certain\nassurance rightly to be gained by making fresh contact every now\nand then with the real world of empirically observable facts.\nIn this particular case, I have no doubt at all that we were\ncompletely within our logical rights in assuming that, in the absence\nof any systematic cause, the distribution of marks by an unbiassed\njudge would be in accordance with the terms of the postulates\nunderlying the statistical treatment, or that it would be possible to\njustify this assumption with virtual rigidity. But I am also pretty\nsure that no one has hitherto taken the trouble to mark two thousand\nodd drawings against hfty thoroughly randomised and arbitrarily\ngroiq^ed pseudo-originals ;\nso that the control marking has certainly\nestablished a much closer link between empirical experience and the\nassumptions of the experiment than could otherwise have been held\nto exist.\nIt seems to me, therefore, that although the work may well be\ndeemed to have approximated to supererogation, it cannot possibly\nbe considered to have been waste of time.\nSECTION VI\nAnticipation of Criticism\n1. General\n:\nIt is very meet, right and our bounden duty that we\nshould subject experiments of this kind to the utmost rigour of all\nreasonable criticism. On the other hand, life is short and the\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 117\namount of work to be done in the subject prodigious, so that it is to\nnobody\u2019s advantage to replicate controversy or to waste valuable\ntime in arguing about matters which ought not, ]:>roperly speaking,\nto come into dispute at all. I have accordingly thought it expedient\nto deal here with some of the types of criticism which private\ndiscussion has shown to be most likely to be raised, and to attempt\nsome kind of logical analysis of the various ways in which an\nexperiment of this general character might fail to satisfy scientific\nand evidential criteria. It is hoped that prophylactic treatment on\nthese lines may prevent subsequent discussion from drifting into\nirrelevant backwaters. I need hardly say, I hope, that there is not,\nin my opinion, any valid criticism of a fundamental character which\ncan be brought against the work\u2014otherwise I should not be pub-\nlishing it ;\nbut there seems to be quite a number of points which\npeople find it difficult to grasp and these may better be dealt with in\nadvance than in arrear. This is not intended to imply that the\nexperiments could not have been better carried out ;\non the con-\ntrary, there are many details which I think I could now improve\nupon in the light of experience. But I do not believe there is any\nweakness either of theoretical method or practical procedure which\nis competent to invalidate, or even appreciably to weaken, the main\nconclusions reached.\nBroadly speaking, we may expect to find critics divided into two\nmain classes. First, there will be a few who, while admitting that\nthere is nothing wrong with the experimental evidence, will contend\nthat the existence of a cognitive relation between any person and a\ndrawing the nature of which he cannot determine by any sensory\nprocess or by rational inference is impossible, or at least so ante-\ncedently improbable that no evidence could be considered convinc-\ning. Second, there will be a much larger class who will suggest that\nthere is some flaw or weakness either in the general method adopted\nor in the manner in which it was carried out.\nThe first class are presumably of greater interest to the pathologist\nthan they are ever likely to be to me ;\nbut for the benefit of the small\nand reasonable sub-class who are genuinely and semi-rationally\ntroubled about antecedent probabilities two or three points are\nworth briefly noting which I do not think have hitherto been made.\nFirst, it seems quite clear that all estimates of probability are\neither based on empirical experience or are worthless ;\nhence there\ncan be no such thing as a truly a priori probability, though there\nmay be well-founded estimates of probability formed antecedent\nto the undertaking of any particular piece of investigation. Second,\nany empirical estimate of a probability must be deduced from the\n\f118 Whalely Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nstudy of a suffi ciently large aggregate of comparable instances, e.g.\nthrows of a die or drawings from a pack, to enable a reasonably\naccurate estimate to be formed of the limiting ratio of the relative\nfrequencies of the occurrences and non-occurrences of the event in\nquestion ;\nit follows that the \u2018\nantecedent improbabilitist \u2019\nhas the\nunenviable negative task of showing that the many indications of\nparanormal cognition which have from time to time been obtained\nare not in excess of what can reasonably be attributed to chance,\nfraud and the like ;\nat the very best he must show (a) that so many\ncases are ex]dicable in these terms that there is a strong probability\nthat any new and similar case is thus explicable, and {b) that this\ncase is similar. Third, if he declares that the occurrence of a faint\nbut widely diffused power of ])aranormal cognition, such as I have\nfound in the course of this work, is contrary to common experience,\none can only rejdy tliat it is not ;\non the contrary, every second\nperson one meets has a story suggestive of paranormal cognition in\nsome form or other, either at hrst or second hand, while the whole\nliterature, not merely of Psychical Research, but of History,\nAnthro])ology and Biography, is crammed with instances of varying\ndegrees of authenticity. Fourth and finally, what would be contrary\nto common experience, to the point of incredibility, wmuld be if no\nconcatenation of circumstances had ever resulted in the kind and\ndegree of alnlity 1 have found ever resulting in an incident sufficiently\nstriking to be put on record.\nIn short, criticism on these lines, even in its most reasonable form,\ndoes not seem to me to have a leg to stand upon ;\nfor the whole of\nthe antecedent and contextual evidence appears far more consonant\nwith the supposition that what we now call \u2018\nparanormal \u2019\nmodes\nof cognition constitute a fact in Nature, often enough \u201c twisted by\nknaves to make a trap for fools \u201d but none the less real for that, while\nattempts to explain them away may l)e due to a wide range of\nmotives\u2014from a laudable desire to discourage superstition, through\na vague dread of their ill-deduced inqdications, to a petty dislike\nof anything not smugly subsumable under the critic\u2019s own conception\nof how Nature ought to behave.\nTurning to the second class of critics, with whom I liave every\nsympathy (for have I not been of their conp^any where much other\nwork has been concerned?) it seems to me that not-obviously-stupid\ncriticism can again be flivided into two main types, of which one is\nconcerned with what I will call Real Possibilities of Error, while the\nother arises solely from misapju\u2019ehensions of the logical basis of the\nwork. The possibility of sensory ])erception would be a perfect\nexample of the first, while the delusion that the use of originals\n\f162] Experinmits on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 119\ndepicting common objects might possibly foster a spurious positive\nresult would typically represent the second.\n2. Real Possibilities of Error : Using the term \u2018\nerror \u2019\nin a some-\nwhat wider sense than usual, these possibilities may conveniently\nbe dealt with under the heads of Fraud, Misreporting, Sensory\nleakage. Inference, Marking and Statistical Treatment.\nAs regards Fraud, it is entirely proper that, in the present state\nof the art and in view of the unfortunate history of much of our\nsubject, the possibility of deception should be seriously considered,\nwithout any regard at all to personal feelings, wherever it seems\nplausibly applicable ;\nbut I do not think that this is a case where it\nis. It certainly would have been if I had been working with\nprofessional music-hall telepathists, or if H.S.C. and I had set up as\na pair of modern Zancigs, or if I had relied wholly or mainly on the\nperformance of some one especially gifted percipient, or even on\nthose of a very few ;\nwhereas none of these circumstances obtain.\nApart from this, I very much doubt whether I could have put\nthrough so monumental a deception without arousing the suspicions\nof some at least of my various colleagues and consultants ;\nand even\nif I could, it would still have been necessary either to consj^ire with\na large number of my percipients, or else to fabricate drawings on\na fairly extensive scale. The last would probably have been the\nbest plan, and a skilled forger could presumably manage it. On the\nother hand, all drawings, markings, tables and calculations are, of\ncourse, available for inspection by any interested and responsible\nperson.\nBut considerations of this kind do not constitute the jDroper\nrebuttal of any such suggestions. As I indicated at the very outset\nof this paper, the development of a repeatable experiment\u2014the\nmost urgent desideratum in the subject\u2014has been one of my most\nimportant objectives throughout. I believe I have succeeded in\ndoing so ;\nconsequently, I am in the position of being able to make\nthe only completely satisfactory reply (even better than pistols for\ntwo and coffee for one before breakfast), namely, \u201c If you don\u2019t\nbelieve me, go and try for yourself.\u201d\nGreat stress has often been laid on the importance of predictability\nas the acid test of genuine phenomena. No sane person, of course,\nwould agree with the pronouncement \u201c Only when conditions can\nbe so controlled that, e.g., a teacher can announce beforehand that,\non such a day, hour, and place he will demonstrate these things\n\u201d\n[viz., telepathy or clairvoyance] \u201c can they or will they be accepted\nby any sound scientific mind \u201d, but the general principle is sound\nenough.\n\f120 Wkately Carington, M.A., M.8c. [part\nI accordingly venture to ])redict to the following extent : Take\na group of about 30 or more university students of mixed sexes and\nperform a ten day experiment as descriljed in my account of Expt. I :\nbe scrupuloiisly careful to exclude all sensory clues : Select the\nsubjects of originals from some much larger list of reasonably\ncommon objects, avoiding ambiguity, by any substantially random\nmethod : repeat the experiment, preferably with different perci-\npients, two or three months later, using different originals : have the\ndrawings scored \u2018\nblind \u2019\nagainst the 20 shuffled originals, by groups\nas described above, using a rather generous standard of scoring :\nif necessary repeat the experiment a third time. I am fairly con-\nfident that at least promising results will be obtained, though I\nwould not care to guarantee significance ;\nand when I say \u2018 pro-\nmising \u2019\nI mean sufficiently good to justify any reasonable person in\ncontinuing the work. Naturally, a dozen small points come to\nmind, which can be gathered from the details given in the preceding\npages ;\nbut there is one possibly important reservation which I\nthink it fair to make. Inasmuch as the process may be and probably\nis of a \u2018\ntelepathic \u2019\ncharacter it might very well be upset by a\nhostile attitude on the part of the exj^erimenter, so I think it legiti-\nmate to insist that such an experiment should be undertaken with a\nreasonable amount of good will. That is to say, I doubt whether\nan experimenter would be likely to obtain good results if he started\nwith the attitude \u201c This man is an adjectival charlatan, but I\nsuppose it\u2019s my duty to show that there is nothing in it \u201d. Subject\nto this reservation, T fail to see why anyone should not repeat the\nexperiments with success, substantially at any time and in any place\nand with any percipients he pleases\u2014unless, of course, I happen to\nbe an exceptionally good telepathic agent, which there is no reason\nfor supposing and would be a singularly harsh piece of misfortune.\nThe possibility of Misreporting, though one of the most important\nin some branches of our subject, is hardly one that is likely to be\napplicable here. There is no question of whether I did or did not\nhold hands in the dark, or of the squirmings of ectoplasmic pseudo-\npodia in a tlim light ;\nnor even, to come a little nearer home, of\nmaking statements of the type \u201c The percipient was seated so that\nshe could not see the cards \u201d, which would need very careful expan-\nsion before acce]ffance. I think I am right in saying that all\nevidentially important statements made are of such a nature that\nthey must be either lies or substantially accurate ;\nbut I shall be\nvery pleased to elucidate any ambiguity which has escaped my\nnotice.\nThe likelihood of percipients having obtained knowledge of the\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 121\ndrawings by sensory means ^ may, I believe, be dismissed with even\ngreater brevity. Not even Sam Weller\u2019s million magnifpng power\ntelescopes would enable people to see through brick walls, hundreds\nof intervening objects, or even curtains\u2014let alone three thousand\nmiles of bulging Earth between here and North Carolina. I don\u2019t\nknow whether anyone will be so rash as to try to attack on this\nfront ;\nbut I\u2019m afraid he will meet with but little success if he does.\nSimilarly, I find it hard to imagine that anyone will suggest that\nthe percipients were able to infer by any rational process what the\nnature of the originals was hkely to be, either in respect of any\nparticular occasion or of any experiment taken as a whole. If a\npercipient had known (as none did) the precise method of selection\nwe were using in the first, third and fourth experiments, and what\ndictionary was employed, he might have successfully inferred that\noriginals as a whole were somewhat more likely to be drawn from one\nsection of the dictionary than from another ;\nbut this would not have\nhelped him to decide which page was most likely to be used on a\ngiven occasion or in a given experiment.\nPersonally, if I were coerced into leading a forlorn hope against\nan impregnable position of this kind, I should concentrate on the\nMarking, and should try to make out that the Instructions and\nNotes provided, wittingly or unwittingly, clues and guidances\ncalculated to ensure an undue assignment of \u2018\nwinning \u2019 points. It\nis to forestall attempts of this kind that I have published the relevant\nmaterial in full in Appendix IV, and I do not think that any plausible\ncase can be made out on these lines. ^ In the very unlikely event of\nthis occurring, we can always fall back on the results of the Arbi-\ntrated marking, or on the 314 drawings dealt with in the fifth colu m n\nof Table 5 on page 99. In principle, I should be only too pleased to\nsee these 314 drawings scored blind by any reasonable panel of\nunbiassed [i.e. ignorant) judges ;\nthough in practice I should suggest\nthat their time would be far better spent in repeating the exj^eri-\nment.\u00ae\nWe are left with the question of Statistical Treatment, and here.\nBy \u2018\nsensory means \u2019\nI refer to any physiological process involving the\nstimulation of a peripheral receptor and the transmission of an impulse along\nan afferent nerve fibre to the central nervous system.\n^ In case anyone wishes to make such an attempt, I hasten to point out that\nit must be completely specific ;\nthat is to say, expressions of opinion are not\nenough ; it must be explicitly stated which Instruction or Note is thought\nlikely to generate a spurious positive result, and how.\n\u00ae I have said \u201c these 314 drawings \u201d, but strictly it should be the w'hole\n2,193 unless the critic concerned is prepared to accept my assurances as to\nwhich the 314 were, and on other relevant points.\nH\n\f122 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nI think, I am on ground no less firm than elsewhere. The procedure\nwhereby we calculate the expected number of Winners, explained\non p. 83 above, is no more than the simplest rule-of-three arithmetic ;\nthe method of obtaining the variance is due to Mr W. L. Stevens and\nhas not been challenged ^\n;\nor alternatively, where the numbers are\nas large as they are here, we may use a simple method familiar\nnowadays to almost every scientific worker. The only point I can\nimagine being raised in this connection is the very silly and trivial\none that my first method of assessment did not work, so that I was\nforced to shift the basis of the enquiry from particular occasions to\nexperiments as wholes ;\non this ground, in a narrowly literal sense,\nI might be accused of having \u2018\nselected my test of significance after\nI had seen the data \u2019\n. The answer to this is \u201c So then what ? Do you\nsuggest that the results are due to chance, or are you merely indulg-\ning a taste for dogmatic psittacism? \u201d However, we need not worry\nabout this unless someone is unwise enough to start it.\n3. Misapprehensions : As will have been gathered from the fore-\ngoing I feel I have nothing to fear from attacks directed on legitimate\nobjectives, that is to say on any feature of the work which is, in fact,\nrelevant to its outcome. If there was no malajides or gross mis-\nreporting, if the percipients could not obtain knowledge of the\ndrawings by sensory means or by rational inference, if the marking\nwas truly unbiassed, and if the statistical treatment was correct, then\nthe experiments stand and the results must either be attributed to\nsome mode of cognition not covered by the above, or to chance : and\nchance aloiie would yield such results only once, on the average, in\nsome tens of thousands of such investigations.\nOn the other hand, I am very frightened indeed of the much more\ndangerous type of critic who does not (or sometimes will not) fully\ngrasp what has been going on, but none the less avers, with much\ngrave and pseudo-judgmatic head-wagging, that he is \u201c not alto-\ngether satisfied \u201d about something or other\u2014which usually he is\nincajjable of stating clearly. To describe this kind of thing as\n\u2018\nirresponsible \u2019\nis to carry courtesy to the point of fulsomeness ;\nfor\nit is not, in other contexts, considered honest to make disparaging\nallegations without being able at least to define even if not to\nsubstantiate them.\nA typical example is to be found among those whose resistance\nto accepting the plain implications of the work is expressed by a\nmelancholy mewing to the effect that \u201c it may be chance \u201d. Of\ncourse they may be chance ;\nanything may be chance ;\nthe behaviour\nof such persons themselves nmy be chance\u2014in fact this is often the\n* Cf. Appendix V.\n\f162] Experhnents on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 123\nmost charitable interpretation of it. But some things are very\nmuch more likely to be due to chance than others, and events of the\n\u2018\nonce in ten thousand trials \u2019\norder are not strong candidates for the\nformer class. This kind of thing is exasperating, but I believe that\nbehind it there is often a genuine bepuzzlement which deserves a few\nhues of consideration. It arises, I beheve, from a failure, or refusal,\nto understand the kind of thing we are trying to do and the object\nof the tests of significance we apply. Let me try to explain.\nCommon experience tells us, before we start any experiments of\nthis kind, that innumerable and unspecifiable factors of varying\npotency will be at work in the percipients\u2019 minds and may cause them\nto draw anjfihing whatever, including some of the objects depicted\nin the originals we use. We may accordingly expect with some\nconfidence that we shall obtain a certain number of apparent\n\u2018\nsuccesses \u2019\n{i.e. resemblances between drawings and originals) which\nwill actually be due to these factors and not to any true cognitive\nrelation between percipient and original. If we do not fully realise\nthis we are very hable to be led by enthusiasm into over-rating what\nhappens and attributing to \u2018 paranormal \u2019\ncognition effects which\nare really due to these other factors. The object, and strictly the\nonly object, of a test of significance is to tell us whether this is likely\nto have happened\u2014and about how likely. When the level of\nsignificance is found to be high, as in these experiments, we conclude\nthat the effects observed are not likely\u2014indeed, are very unlikely\n\u2014\nto be due to such causes ;\nthough, of course, it is always open to\nanyone to contend that, in his opinion, they are even less likely to\nbe due to any alternative cause. This last, however, is of no\nimportance ;\nit would be of interest only if we were attempting to\n\u2018 prove \u2019\nthe occurrence of the phenomena once and for all by means\nof a single experiment or group of experiments. But this is not, or\nshould not be, the case. Rare and obscure phenomena are not\n\u2018 proved \u2019\nin this sort of way ;\nthey gradually become established\nand accepted through familiarity and through a gradual elucidation\nof the conditions of their occurrence and the way in which they\nwork. If experiments of the kind here described are never success-\nfully repeated, if we never succeed in discovering the \u2018\nlaws \u2019\ncon-\ncerned, then the critical historian of the future will be perfectly\ncorrect in writing them off as some kind of a lusiis naturae. But in\nthe meantime we are perfectly entitled to say that the likehhood\nof their outcome being a chance effect is so remote that no one need\nfear wasting his time in pushing the investigation further.\nOf the more specific misapprehensions that I have encountered\nthere are two which seem to me to merit fairly detailed discussion\n\f124 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nhere. Of these, the first is concerned with the desirability of\nemploying a plurality of judges, the second with the question of\nwhether the result can be swayed in one direction or the other by\nthe use of common or rare originals.\nThe first can be made to sound extremely plausible, if it is put in\nsome such form as \u201c Surely you will not allow results of such\nimportance to rest on the opinion of a single judge? \u201d ;\nbut none\nthe less it arises solely from confusion of thought as to the issues\ninvolved. It is true that I am relying, and am perfectly content to\nrely, on the markings of a single judge, but I am not relying at all\non his opinion in any sense that would make this type of criticism\nvalid. Yet, in another sense, I am relying on his opinions to such\nan extent that if they were usually ill-founded no significant effect\nwould be likely to emerge. If we can clear up this apparent\nparadox, we shall not only settle the particular point at issue but a\nnumber of others also of a somewhat similar nature. We can put\nit very briefly by saying that the kind of opinion on which we do\nrely, and which is of great importance, is a judgement to the effect\nthat \u201c This drawing is sufficiently like that original to be worth\ngiving it a mark (or half a mark) \u201d ;\nand that the kind of opinion\non which we do not rely is a judgement to the effect that \u201c This\ndrawing is a winner (i.e. a hit in the right place) \u201d. But this is unduly\ncryptic and calls for careful elucidation.\nI think I can best clarify the issues, which are exceedingly im-\nportant, by considering two apparently contradictory statements,\nboth of which are true. The first may be put in the form \u201c It makes\nno difference what the judge does \u201d, and the second as \u201c A good\njudge makes all the difference \u201d. The catch here is this, that the\nfirst statement is true and the secoiid false if there is no real cognitive\neffect, but only chance, at work ;\nwhile the second is true and the\nfirst false, if there is. The point will become clearer if we expand\nthe first to the form \u201c If there is no real effect, a judge who does not\nknow the answer ^ cannot generate a spurious one by any kind of\nwishful or misguided marking \u201d, and the second to the form \u201c If\nthere is a real effect, a judge who is intelligent and discriminating\nwill bring it out better than one who is neither \u201d.\nEven these expanded forms need further consideration, and I\nthink the best way to ensure it is to invite the critic to imagine\nhimself in the position of a judge intensely anxious to secure (or\nprevent) the obtaining of a spurious positive result. How is he\nI I use tlie phrase \u2018\nknow the answer \u2019\nas a convenient condensation of \u2018\nImow\nwhich originals belong to which experiment or, more generally, \u2018\nknow what\nallocations or markings will favour a positive result.\u2019\n\f162]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 125\ngoing to set about it ? He is given one batch of drawings which he\nknows to be those of the percipients of Expt. I, another of Expt. II,\nand so on : he is also given 50 originals arranged in alphabetical\norder\u2014Apple, Beaver, Cat, Cormorant, Distaff, etc., down to\nXylophone, Yoke and Zeppelin, or whatever they may be. But\n(and this is vital) he does not know which of these originals were\nused in Expt. I, which in Expt. II, etc., nor has he any clue to guide\nhim. He starts work on the first batch of drawings and soon comes\nacross, we will suppose, a number of rather indeterminate birds.\nIs he to reckon these as hits on Cormorant, or as half hits, or as not\nworth a mark at all? Which policy will best serve his ends? If\nCormorant is one of the originals of Expt. I, then reckoning all these\nas full hits will tend to produce a positive result ;\nImt if it happens\nnot to be, then the reverse. But this is exactly what he does not\nknow, so that he will be quite unable to decide whether generosity\nor strictness will pay him best. And the same applies to every\norigmal of the 50 and to every batch of drawings. Thus it is literally\nimpossible for any degree of fancifulness, of prejudice in either\ndirection, or of eccentricity on the part of the judge to generate\nanything but a chance effect if there is no non-chance relationship\nbetween the drawings and the originals.\nThe same apphes, though not quite so obviously, to capriciousness\nor lack of consistency. I have heard it asked \u201c Suppose it just\nhappens that ^ the judge is feeling generous when he is considering\na drawing of Expt. I and looking at an original of Expt. I, and strict\nwhen he is considering a drawing of Expt. I but looking at an\noriginal of Expt. II? \u201d. The answer is \u201c Suppose it \u2018\njust happens\n\u2019\nthe other way round, the effect will be reversed. Have you any\nreason for supposing that the one situation will arise appreciably\nmore often than the other (if so, state it) ;\nand are not these fluctua-\ntions of the standard exactly what we refer to, among other things,\nwhen we use the word \u2018\nchance \u2019? \u201d. It goes without saying that\nfluctuations of this kind will frequently occur and that they may\noften be the deciding factor in cases of doubt ;\nbut unless we\npostulate relevant knowledge on the part of the judge (excluded by\nhypothesis), or suppose him endowed with paranormal powers\n(which would be begging the question) they can have no more\nsystematic influence on the outcome than would decisions obtained\nby tossing a halfpenny or throwing a die.\nNow turn to the other side of the question, and suppose that there\nis a real effect to which we are anxious to do justice. In these circum-\n1 This is a common involuntary trick whereby the notion of chance is\nsmuggled incognito into a sentence ostensibly not containing it.\n\f126 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part j\n^\nstances the intelligence and ability of the judge is likely to be of the I]\nvery greatest importance. The material, on this hypothesis, will be -\nmade up of three types of drawing ;\nthere will be some which have |\nno resemblance or connection with the originals at all ;\nthere will i*i\nbe some which show resemblances or associations determined by\n'\nchance alone ;\nand there will be a certain proportion of which the I\nnature or form has been to some greater or less extent influenced by\nthe cognitive process postulated. Now, unless we can hit on some ({\ninfallible sign whereby we can distinguish lucky shots from genuine\ncognitions, we shall never be able to eliminate the second class of\nresemblances, which wdll always be present to dilute the real effect\nin some degree. The ideal judge would therefore be he who would\nreject all specimens of the first class, but successfully detect and\ncorrectly mark all members of the third ;\nthis would bring out to\nthe fullest possible advantage whatever real effect the material\nmight contain. At the other extreme, even if the material consisted\nwholly of genuine cognitions (class three) it could scarcely survive\nmarking at the hands of a blind imbecile, who would presumably\nallot points in a completely haphazard manner having no reference\nto the resemblances actually observable.\nIt is in this sense, and in this only, that what the judge does is of\nimportance ;\njust as it is in the other sense, and in that only, that\nwhat he does can make no difference. If this is not now clear, I\nfear I must despair of ever making it so, and must be content to\nwait for the spontaneous growth of comprehension in the minds of\nthose concerned.\nIt is worth noting in passing, however, that the evidence suggests\nthat Mr Hindson was a singularly \u2018 good \u2019 judge in the sense just\ndiscussed ;\nfor it will be remembered that even those of his half-\npoints which the arbitrators rejected as implausible resemblances\nshowed a just significant result when treated alone. This is very\nremarkable and strongly suggests that Mr Hindson has a definite\n\u2018\nflair \u2019\nfor detecting the kind of remote resemblance which results\nfrom a very imperfect cognition. I shall always regret that I asked\nhim, as recorded on p. 88, to raise his standard after scoring the\ndrawings of the first experiment ;\nif I had not done so, we might\nwell have obtained much more information about what kind of\ndistortion takes place and what the limit of \u2018 genuine \u2019\nresemblance is.\nThis brings us back to the question of the plurality of judges from\na fresh angle. I greatly fear that, in spite of all that I have said\nabove, I shall l)e urged to have the marking repeated by an inde-\npendent judge or judges with a view to strengthening the validity\nof the results obtaizied ;\nand if I decline to do so (as I shall) I am\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 127\nlikely to be told that I am afraid of such a re-marking giving a null,\nor much less significant, result. This, of course, is rubbish, for a\nmuch less significant result by another judge would no more\ninvalidate that already obtained than a much more significant result\nwould strengthen it ;\nit would only show the second judge to be\ninferior (in the sense discussed above) to Mr Hindson, or vice versa.\nChance, as an explanation of the effects observed is already out of\ncourt, except from the apriorist standpoint dealt with earlier, and\nno reduplication of marking will bring it in again. Nothing is to be\ngained by wasting the time of judges in doing what we know to be\nunnecessary, when they might be doing something useful ;\nor by\nbowing oneself in the house of unreason when one\u2019s logical position\nis impregnable.\nThe position would be very different, and re-marking desirable to\nthe point of necessity, if it could be shown that the Instructions,\netc., gave biassing guidance to the judge, or if it could be plausibly\nmaintained, in face of his testimony and my own, that Mr Hindson\nhad, in fact, any notion of which originals were used in which\nexperiment, or even any clues by which he might have known.\nApart from this, re-marking in this case, or plurality of markings in\ngeneral, will only throw light on the relative merits of the judges,\nnot on the validity of results.^ Such questions as the extent to\nwhich judges differ, and why, or of what principles of judging are\nbest ealculated to bring out real effects in varying types of material,\nare of no small intrinsic interest, and will undoubtedly demand\ninvestigation in due course. But they have nothing whatever to\ndo with whether the results of these or similar experiments are valid,\nand it is wholly illegitimate to contend that they have.\nA great deal of what has just been said is applicable, mutatis\nmutandis, to the cognate suggestion that the outcome of the experi-\nment may be influenced by the kind of originals used. If we\nsubstitute \u2018\nignorance of percipients \u2019\nfor \u2018\nignorance of the judge \u2019,\nwe shall find a close parallel between the two situations, the second\nof which accordingly does not need detailed discussion here. Just\nas, in one sense, it makes no difference what the judge does, so, in\nthe corresponding sense, it makes no difference what originals are\nused ;\nand just as, in the other sense, some judges are better than\n1 To cover a point whicli might be raised : If we were to submit to a judge,\nunder the conditions described, material which we believed to embody a\nsignificant real effect, and were to obtain a null result, we should be perfectly\nentitled to re-submit to another or others in the hope that the first was incom-\npetent\u2014always provided that we made due allowance, in the usual way, for the\nnumber of judges so employed when making our final estimate of probability.\n\f128 Whately Carington, 31.A., 31.

And just as it is impossible to show how a judge\nwho does not know the answer can fabricate a spurious result by any\nprocess of mis-marking, so it is impossible to show how an experi-\nmenter can fabricate a spurious result, through the use of one sort\nof original rather than another, provided the percipients have no\n]:) 0ssibility of telling, by sensory means or rational inference, what\noriginals are likely to be used on wdiich occasions. Finally, again\nas in the preceding case, the best way of convincing oneself that this\nis true is to try to work out a plan for generating a spurious effect,\nby the use of any type of originals whatever, subject to the restric-\ntions that the original to be used on any occasion is selected by a\nrandom method, and that the percipients are given no clue as to\nwhat it is.\n4. Summing-up : I have no desire to appoint myself dictator-like,\nas judge in my own cause, though it seems fair enough to insist, as\nI have just been doing, that criticism should be directed towards\npoints which might, in principle, be vulnerable rather than against\nthose which could never be. It is true that my most anxious\nscrutiny has failed hitherto to find any source of systematic error\nin either the method or procedure adopted, and that I do not believe\nthat there is one. But it is not by my ojfinion, or even by that of\nothers however eminent, that the work must be judged as successful\nor otherwise ;\nit is by the test of repeatability alone that it must\nultimately stand or fall. If properly conducted attempts to repeat\nmy results consistently fail to do so, no amount of argument on my\npart will off-set the fact ;\nand if, in a fair proportion of such cases,\nsimilar results are obtained, argument will be superfluous.\nSo wo may end this Section very much as we began it ; I have\ntried to produce a repeatable experiment ;\nI believe that I have\nsucceeded ;\nif, for whatever reason, you distrust the conclusions\nreached\u2014Try it yourselves.\nSECTION VII\nSummary .and Conclusion\nThis paper is already depressingly lengthy, though I doubt whether\n1 could have shortened it appreciably without damaging omissions\nof important details. I will accordingly do no more by way of\nbringing it to an end than run over the essential features of the work\nin briefest summary and add a very few comments of general interest\nfor which no appropriate place has been found elsewhere.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 129\nFive experiments ^ in the \u2018 paranormal \u2019\ncognition of distant\ndrawings have been conducted. In each of these, ten different\noriginals were used, and ten fresh originals were used in each\nexperiment. All originals were selected by a substantially random\nmethod. About 250 percipients of both sexes, producing about\n2,200 drawings, took part. AAry few percipients, probably not\nmore than ten or twelve, took part in more than one experiment.\nIn no experiment was there the smallest possibility, humanly\nspeaking, of any percipient obtaining any clue to the nature of any\noriginal by normal sensory means or by rational inference. The\ndrawings were marked against the whole fifty originals by a judge\nwho had no clue or information as to which originals w^ere used in\nwhich experiment. A total of 1,209 drawings were found which\nwere judged to be sufficiently like one or other of the originals to\ndeserve mention. From the data it is possible to calculate how\nmany of these resemblances or \u2018\nhits \u2019\nwould be \u2018\nwinners \u2019, i.e. liits\non originals used in their own experiment, if chance alone were\noperative, and how often this value would be exceeded by any given\namount. It is found that the excess is such as would be equalled\nor surpassed only about once in some thirty thousand such investiga-\ntions if chance alone were responsible. In other words, percipients\u2019\ndrawings resemble the originals (considered as a group) at which they\nare aiming more closely than they resemble originals at which they\nwere not aiming to an extent which cannot plausibly be attributed\nto chance.\nExamination of the data from another point of view shows that\nthese resemblances do not occur exclusively, or even most often, at\nthe same time as the display of the origmal concerned. But there is\na fairly regular tendency for drawings which resemble a given\noriginal to occur relatively more frequently on occasions which are\nnear to that on which it was dis^olayed than on others which are\nmore remote. This effect is observable to a significant extent in\nboth directions.\nThe main conclusions indicated by the facts are, first that there\nis a real cognitive relation of some kind (direct or indirect) between\npercipients and originals, second that this may be either of pre-\ncognitive or retrocognitive form.\nThe above simimary, if somewhat arid, appears to cover ade-\n^ I say \u2018\nfive \u2019\nhere because it will be more convenient henceforward to\nthink of the experiments here described as Experiments I to V, rather than\nI to IV B ; otherwise we may find ourselves getting confused at some later\nstage by having, say, seven experiments with eighty originals. The next\nexperiment will be numbered VI.\n\f130 Whafely Cnrinqton, M.A., WI.8c. [part\nqiiately the essential facts and inferences therefrom, but I may be\npermitted a few comments of a slightly more speculative nature. ]\nI suppose most readers will want to ask \u201c What kind of a process\n^\ndo you think is involved? I do not think the time is ripe for\nsaying, or even suggesting, what the process is ;\nbut I am prepared\nto record a few quite tentative impressions which suggest fairly\nstrongly what it is 7iot. First and foremost, I am as confident as I\ncould be without special experimentation that it is in no sense a\nmatter of the percipient copying or in any way \u2018seeing\u2019 the drawing, n\nIn contrast to M. Warcollier\u2019s recently published views, I have the '\nstrong impression that it is the \u2018\nidea \u2019\nrather than the form that is !\ncognised. For example, it is as if the percipient were told \u2018\nDraw a i\nHand \u2019\nrather than \u2018\nCopy this Hand \u2019, for we get left hands and\nright hands, open hands and closed hands, a])parently quite indis-\ncriminately, which we surely would not do if it were a matter of\ncopying something seen. Very seldom indeed have I received the |\nimpression that it is the uninter])reted form itself that has \u2018\ngot )\nacross \u2019, and even then I fancy that it has been the \u2018\nidea of the form\n\u2019\nrather than the lines themselves that have been concerned. In fact,\non the strict understanding that this is entirely conjectural and \u2018\nfor\npurposes of entertainment only \u2019, I increasingly incline to the view\nthat the lines on the paper have nothing to do with it at all, except\nperha])s as a focus for the thought or attention of the experimenter.\nThe astute reader will correctly deduce from this that my im-\npression at present is one of a \u2018\ntelepathic \u2019\nrather than a \u2018\nclair-\nvoyant \u2019 phenomenon. This is true as far as it goes, but only subject\nto the very important reservation that I am not at all sure that the\ncurrent conceptions of either the one or the other will necessarily\nfit the facts. The truth of the matter is that we do not know what\nkind of a process is involved, and it would be a mistake to handicap\nourselves by trying to tie it up prematurely with any preconceived\nnotions.\nIt seems pretty clear that the percipients show a cognitive relation\nto the originals which cannot be attributed to any \u2018\nnormal \u2019\ncause ;\nand I have no doubt at all that the experimenter\u2019s mind (H.S.C.\u2019s\nor mine) plays an im])ortant part in establishing that relation.\nIndeed, certain work now in progress suggests on inspection (I will\nnot say more) that the mind of a third party, neither experimenter\nnor percipient but still connected with the experiment in certain\nrespects, may significantly influence the results ;\nand the bare\nsuspicion that such an effect may be exercised in a manner deter-\nminable by experiment shoidd make us very cautious about foi mu-\nlating even the most tentative explanations.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 131\nI will end by drawing attention to the fact that the effect found,\nthough highly significant, is intrinsically very faint. On the basis\nof the Hindson \u2018\nAll Entries \u2019\ndata, which I have so extensively\nused, a total of rather more than 2,000 drawings yields a crop of just\nover fifty hits above chance expectation ;\nso we may reasonably\nspeak of a 2^% effect. Presumably this is an underestimate, partly\nbecause I artificially restricted Mr Hindson\u2019s natural judgement,\npartly because it may fairly be supposed that a perfect marker would\nhave done a little better. But I should be inclined to doubt whether\nany marking however perfect would raise the figure much above 5%.\nThis, to my mind, is a very gratifying order of result. It is\nadmittedly small, but so is the amount of radium in pitchblende\nwhich no one on that account denies is important and interesting.\nOn the other hand, if I had found an effect of some ten times the\nsize, I should have felt it too good to be true and have suspected the\npresence of many large flies in the ointment. As it is, it seems to\nme that what I have found (especially when we add the complica-\ntions due to displacement) is eminently compatible with both sides\nof common experience\u2014with the knowledge that on the whole\npeople very seldom show signs of paranormal cognition, and with\nthe knowledge that none the less they occasionally do. Finally, the\nfact that, so far as I can judge by inspection, the ability concerned\nis pretty widely distributed, or at least not concentrated to any\nstartling degree among a very few specially gifted persons, suggests\nthat it is likely to prove an attribute common to all humanity, with\nnothing alarmingly magical about it ;\nso that perhaps the adjective\n\u2018 paranormal \u2019\nis something of a misnomer after all.\n\f132 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc.

I were matched, set by set, against the originals\nby H.S.C. and myself, and the number of correct matchings ascer-\ntained as described in the text, it was found that in If cases we had\nfailed to match any drawing successfully against the original used\non the corresponding occasion ;\nin 12 cases we made one correct\nassignment, in six cases we made two, in four cases three, and in one\ncase six.\nSince the expected number of successes is in all cases equal to the\nnumber of percipients, there is evidently nothing of interest here\nexcept the solitary score of six in the first line, which is fully dealt\nwith in the text.\nAPPENDIX III\nApplication of the Method of Decimal Scoring\n1. Scoring of Experiments I, II and 111.\nThis was done by Mr and Mrs Oliver Gatty in two batches. The\nfirst consisted of the eleven sets of Expt. Ill mixed with eleven sets\n(Nos. 1-10 & 12) taken from Expt. I ;\nthe second included the\nremaining 26 sets of Expt. I and the 20 sets of Expt. II. Since I am\nrelying for my conclusions solely on the results of the third method\nof assessment, I need not detail here the innocent subterfuges I\nadopted to prevent the scorers wittingly applying processes of\nrational inference to the work. I am, however, satisfied, and the\ninternal evidence suggested, that these were sulficient even if they\nmay not have been necessary.\nWhen the points were separated and added in the way illustrated\nin the text (p. 77) the results were found to be\n(a) Experiments I & III :\nJudged\nI\nto resemble\nIII Total\nSets of Experiment I 10-0 1-0 11-0\n\u201e III 6-5 4-5 11-0\nTotal 16-5 5-5 22-0\nUsing the general matching formulae (pp. 83-4) this gives\nEll-0; 0 14-5; D 3-5 ;\na2 4-321 ;\na 2-079\nwhich is not intrinsically significant, for D\/cr = 1-684 with P-~-09.\n\f140 Whately Carmgton, M.A., M.Sc.

A set is counted as half right and half wrong when the\npoints awarded to the two series of originals are equal.)\nThis leads to\nE 22-02 ;\n0 25-50 ;\nD 3-48 ;\n10-327.\nFor the two hatches taken together we have\nE 33-02 ;\n0 40-00 ;\nD 6-98 ;\n14-648\nwhence we find Dja \u2014 1 -824 with P~-07, which is still not significant.\n2. Scoring oj 80 sets from Experiment IVA and IV B :\nAs explained in the text, the procedure of this experiment was\nspecially devised to enable the somewhat onerous task of scoring\nthe three hundred odd sets which it was hoped to obtain to be under-\ntaken by myself, and special precautions were adopted, as there\ndescribed, to ensure that I could have no normal knowledge of\nwhether any particular set was aimed at the A or B originals. As it\nturned out, however, many fewer sets were obtained than had been\nexpected, while of those that were sent in a considerable number\nshowed internal evidence which, as it happened, would have enabled\nme to judge that they were \u2018\nA \u2019\nsets apart from any intrinsic re-\nsemblances of the drawings. However, when these had been weeded\nout by Prof. Broad, there remained 80 sets on which I cmdd safely\nwork. I again abstain from detailed discussion of the points in-\nvolved on the ground that, although these results are perfectly\nreliable, I am not depending on them for my conclusions, and\ntherefore need not estaldish every point meticulously here.\nThese 80 sets were given me in two groups, the first consisting of\n20 \u2018\nA \u2019\nand 20 \u2018\nB \u2019\nsets, the second of 10 \u2018\nA \u2019\nand 30 \u2018\nB \u2019\n;\nbut, by\na not unfortunate misunderstanding, I received the impression that\nthe composition of the second group was the same as that of the first.\nJ hus any bias I may have had in dealing with it was liable to mislead\nrather than to help ; actually, it could hardly do either, for know-\nledge of the relative numbers of A and B sets in the grouj) could not\nenable me to decide which were which.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 141\nThe results obtained were\nJudged to resemble\nA B Total\nSets of Experiment IV A 9-0 21-0 30-0\nIV B 13-0 37-0 50-0\nTotal 22-0 58-0 80-0\nApplying the same methods. we obtain\nE 44-50 ;\n0 46-00 ;\nD 1-50; G- 15-142\nwhich is very nearly as bad as it could be, for D\/cr is only 0-386 with\nP as large as -7. The result must be incorporated, but it is only of\ninterest as showing the difficulty of separating the A and B portions\nof Experiment TV, which we shall find persisting even with the much\nmore successful third method of assessment.\n3. Scoring o\/ 16 sets from, the Individ.ual Experiments :\nIn each of these eight experiments which I do not propose to\ndescribe in detail here, a \u2018\nselected \u2019 percipient was tested, together\nwith either H.S.C. (first six experiments) or W.W.C. (last two). All\nH.S.C.\u2019s drawings were scored by Dr E. J. Dingwall, the six sets\nof the selected percipients in the first six experiments by ]\\Ir B. E.\nParr (to whom I should like to take this opportunity of expressing\nmy gratitude), and the remainder by myself. All judges were kept\nin appropriate ignorance either as to which originals were which or\nas to which drawings were aimed at them, or both, as the circum-\nstances required and permitted.\nThe scoring was done by pairs of experiments and need not be\ngiven in detail here. Combining the returns from the three judges\nE 8-0 ;\n0 12-0 ;\nD 4-0 ;\n2-667\nwhence we find D\/ct 2-449 with P<-02, which is significant.\nAdding these quantities to those obtained in 1 and 2 above gives\nD 12-48 ;\n32-456 ;\nD\/o- 2-192 ;\nP<-03.\nwhich is just decently significant but no more. The substantially\nnull residts obtained from the 80 sets of Expt. IV evidently vitiate\nan otherwise not mipromising method, but the final outcome is poor\ncompared with that yielded by the more sensitive method used\nlater.\n\f142 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nAPPENDIX IV\nA. Copy of Instructions, etc., supplied to Mr Hindson for\nTHE Application of the Method of Palpable Hits\nGuide to Scoring Hits\n] . The general idea is to compare every drawing with each of the\n(50) originals. If any drawing plainly represents the same object\nor activity as that depicted in one of the originals, a \u2018\nhit \u2019\nis\nrecorded ;\nif not, not.\n2. Scoring of hits should be done on the simplest common-sense\nprinciples.\nI he primary question to be asked in respect of any drawing is\nDoes this drawing represent the same object or activity, or the\nsame sort of object, etc., as one of the originals\u2014or at least some-\nthing extremely like it? \u201d In other words \u201cDoes the drawing\nindicate that the percipient had \u2018\nX \u2019\nprominently in mind at some\ntime while he was doing the drawing (\u2018 X \u2019\nbeing the subject of an\noriginal) ?\n\u201d If the answer to these is \u2018\nYes score a hit ;\nif \u2018\nNo \u2019\ndon\u2019t.\n\u2019 \u2019\npie second question, the answer to which may qualify the above,\nis Does this drawing indicate that the percipient was thinking of\nthe same pnd of thing as was the agent when he produced \"the\noriginal ?\n\u201d Notes on what the agent actually had in mind when he\ndre\\v the originals will be found in \u2018\nNotes on Originals\n3. Pay no attention to the skill of drawing displayed. A badly\ndrawn^ Horse, say, is still a horse, provided it is clearly nothing else.\n4. Pay as much attention to the written remarks as to the draw-\nings , a niention of an X is just as good as a drawing of an X. One\nor two \u2018\nscorers \u2019\nhave missed very jialpable hits here ;\nplease be\ncareful.\n5. Eschew far-fetched resemblances, \u2018\npuzzle-picture \u2019\nmethods,\nand all but the plainest and most universal associations, like the\nplague. Be very chary even of these last.\n6. Half hits (but no other fractions) may be given in cases of\ndoubt.\nt\n.\nThe greatest difficulty will probably be found in connection\nwith composite drawings containing several elements. Sometimes\nit IS easy enough ;\nfor example, if a drawing shows prominently both\na Tree and a Horse, a hit should be recorded on Tree and on Horse\n(Jennet). But one is often in doubt as to whether the X deiucted\nwas \u2018\nprominently \u2019\nin the mind of the percipient at the time of\nmaking the drawing (Cf. first question in 2 above).\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 143\nIt will probably be convenient to recognise four grades of \u2018 pro-\nminence \u2019\nas follows : 1. The X is the sole, or virtually sole object\ndepicted in the picture ;\n2. It is \u2018\nco-equal \u2019\nwith other objects ;\n3. It is \u2018\nsecondary \u2019\nbut must none the less have required attention,\nor \u2018\nthinking of \u2019, for it to have been drawn ;\n4. It is purely inci-\ndental \u2019, i.e. jotted in. so to say, as a kind of \u2018\ntrimming\nGive hits for the first three categories, but not for the 4th.\n8. In general, a part of an object may be taken as equivalent to\nthe whole. E.g. It is unlikely that anyone would draw a horse s\nhead without having a whole horse more or less in mind ;\nby con-\ntrast, someone might well draw a hand without having a whole man\nin mind, so a certain amount of common sense must be used m such\n9. Some objects, such as Trees, Boats, Chairs, are very commonly\ndrawn. In certain cases a hit must obviously be recorded, e.g. Tree\nbut if the correspondence is doubtful caution should be exercised\nand points sparingly given ;\notherwise any real effect is hable to be\nmasked or \u2018\ndiluted \u2019\nby points needlessly given to objects drawn\nonly because they happen to be very familiar.\n10. On the other hand, some originals are very difhciilt and are\nseldom if ever drawn unmistakeably, e.g. Cross-stitch, Embattled\nFess, Stop-cock. Perhaps it would be legitimate to relax the usual\nstandard to some extent in such cases ;\nbut this must be for t le\njudgement of the marker. .\n11. General ; Although a high standard should be maintained, so\nthat, as a rule, there can be no reasonable doubt as to the correctness\nof the hits recorded (and only a half point given when there is doubt),\nit will be understood that we cannot rationally demand exact repro-\nductions of the originals ;\ndrawings \u2018\nas good as can be expected\nfrom a percipient who perhaps cannot draw well and may be\nsupposed to have imperfectly cognised the original may be taken\nas acceptable. ,\nIn this connection it seems not unreasonable to suppose tnat\nwhereas some subjects {e.g. Anchor, Buffalo, Frog, Hammer Prawn,\nViolin, Tree) will \u2018 get across \u2019\nin their entirety or not at all, othnrs,\nwhich\u2019 are built up of constituent parts\u2014e.^r. Embattled Fess\n(Shield plus Fess), Flag (plain flag plus cross). Royal Standard\n(plain flag plus lion rampant). Windmill (building jilus sails), etc.,\nmight appear only partially ;\nthat is to say, one of the constituents\nmight appear without the other. It may be worth while bearing this\nin mind in connection with awarding half points.\n(Signed) W.W.C.\n(Dated) 2.viii.39\n\f144 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [PAET\nB. Notes on First 50 Originals\nThe following notes are intended to indicate what was actually in\nthe inind(s) of the agent(s) when the originals were drawn, and to\ndraw the attention of scorers to certain doubtful points which have\narisen. The latter are mostly dealt with in the form of questions so\nas to minimise the risk of unduly influencing an otherwise indepen-\ndent scorer.\n1. Ancestor : The idea in the agent\u2019s mind was that of an old\nman, hence the beard and the staff. Should a point or half point\nbe given to any \u2018\nman \u2019\ndrawn regardless of whether he has a beard,\nis leaning on a staff,- or shows other signs of age?\n2. Anchor : Straightforward ;\nno comments.\n3. Arrow : Straightforward ;\nas an example (which has not yet\nbeen observed) of \u2018\nthe plainest and most universal associations \u2019\nit\nis suggested that it would be legitimate to give at least half a point\nto a drawing of a Bow, even if the Arrow were not drawn.\n4. Balance : Fairly straightforward ;\nbut what do you propose\nto do about (if any) Steelyards, similar balanced mechanisms, see-\nsaws, tight-rope walkers?\n5. Bat : Drawn and thought of as Bat, though the word found in\nthe dictionary was Flittermouse. What, if anything, will you give\nfor a Mouse or mouse-like creature\u2014birds, beetle, butterflies?\n6. Beetle : No comments.\n7. Bench : What about Chairs? Sofas?\n8. Bird : The dictionary word was \u2018\nCorn Bunting \u2019, but the\noriginal was thought of as Bird, and the picture is not specifically\nof a Corn Bunting. The latter is a passerine bird and the picture\nagrees with this. How are you going to distinguish between this and\nDodo (q.v.) which was thought of as a \u2018\nduck-like \u2019\nbird? Do you\npropose to give full or half hit for Eagles, Peacocks, Ostriches, Sea\nGulls, etc., or only for birds of passerine appearance?\n9. Boat ; The dictionary word was Ship and was illustrated by a\nfull-rigged sailing ship, but the agent thought this too difficult to\ndraw and drew the fore-and-aft rigged sailing boat shown. Always\nthought of as Boat rather than Ship. What do you propose to do\nabout Full-rigged ships. Steamers, Battleships, Boats with masts but\nno sails. Rowing Boats, Canoes, Racing eights?\n10. Boot ; Dictionary word was Shoe, but agent drew a Boot.\nM hat are you going to give to Shoes, Horseshoes, Feet?\n11. Bottle: This was based on dictionary word Vacuum\nBottle, which w^as rejected as too difficult. As indicated, the agent\nthought of a glass wine bottle. What will you give to Carafes,\nMedicine bottles. Rubber hot water bottles. Jars, Vases, etc., etc.?\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 145\n12. Bracket : An unsatisfactory original, because something\nangular and structural can be found in very many drawings {e.g.\nchairs, houses, bridges, etc., etc.). Cf. paragraph 9 of Guide and\nkeep the standard high to avoid dilution.\n13. Brim : The word was Brim, understood in the sense of the\nrim of a vessel, etc., not a hat-brim. While drawing, attention was\nfocussed on a Chalice or Goblet-shaped vessel as shown.\n^\nDo you propose to give full or half hits to all containers\nremembering that Bottle and Ewer [g.v.) must be di.stinguished, or\nto Goblet-shaped cups only? What about vases, bowls, plates,\nteacups, saucepans, eggcups, teapots, etc.?\n14. Buffalo : It is generally agreed that all Cows, Bulls, etc.,\nshould count as hits on this original. What about Deer, Rhinoceri\nor animals with tusks resembling the B\u2019s horns?\n15. Bulbs : Geissler potash bulbs were illustrated in the dic-\ntionary and copied. Agent unfamiliar with these. Proliably chief\nidea in his mind was \u2018 glass bulbs \u2019. A hat about Electric light\nbulbs. Hourglasses, Bulbs of the horticultural variety ?\n16. Butterfly : No comment except that as an example (not\nyet observed) of ^\nextremely like \u2019\nit would be considered correct to\ngive a full hit on this for a Moth.\n17. Castle : Battlements (castellations) were chief feature in\nagent\u2019s mind.\n18. Cleopatra\u2019s Needle ; No special comments. Common\nsense must be used in respect of drawings or mentions of Obelisks,\nPyramids, Memorials, Monoliths, Church steeples, etc. Ask yourself\nwhether these are in fact visually or functionally similar to C s\nNeedle.\n19. Cotton Aphid ; No comments.\n20. Cross-stitch : Cf. Guide 10. Consider whether it is lilcely\nthat a percipient imperfectly cognising this original would produce\na St Andrew\u2019s Cross, a Latin Cross, a mention of sewing or of\nembroidery. In re Crosses, cf. Flag.\n21. Dodo ; Thought of by the agent (wrongly as it happens) as\na duck-like bird. Known to be flightless. Must be distinguished\nfrom Bird (Corn Bunting), q.v. Consider what, if anything, you\nwill give for Ducks, geese, swans, etc.. Passerine birds. Nondescript\nbirds. Eagles, Gulls, Peacocks, Ostriches, etc.\n22. Embattled Fess : An unfortunate original. Agent thought\nprimarily of the Fess, not of the shield ;\nbut should anything be\ngiven for shields without fesses ?\n23. Ewer : In the agent\u2019s mind the distinguishing features were\nthe handle and the constricted neck. Should full or half hits be\n\f146 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part !\ngiven for two-handled vases? For watering cans, teapots, etc., with ,\n|\nhandles but also spouts? For teacups, etc., with handles but no ii\nconstriction? For saucepans, etc., with a different sort of handle? I\nFor vases, etc., with constriction but no handle?\nCf. Bottle and Brim.\n24. Exfoliate ; The agent was thinking of Leaves, not Trees.\nShould anything be given for these, or for leaves attached to i.\nFlowers, Fruit, etc.?\n25. Fan : No comments.\n26. Fish : No special sort of fish was intended.\n27. Flag; It will be necessary to distinguish this from Royal\nStandard (44). The flag drawn is a black flag with a strongly\nmarked White Latin Cross. Consider Black Flags (without crosses),\nPlain Flags, Striped Flags, Union Jacks ;\nLatin Crosses without |\nflags. Other sorts of cross ;\nalso pennants, burgees, etc.\n'\n28. Fleur-de-Lys : No comments.\n29. Frog : No comments.\n30. HaxMMEr : Presumably a Mallet would deserve a point, but !\nwhat about axes and picks? I\n31. Hand: It is agreed that a hand is a hand regardless of\nwhether it is right or left, open or closed ;\nalso that nothing should\nbe given to human figures merely because they may be presumed to\nhave hands. Consider (a) figures with hands prominently out-\nstretched or displayed, (b) hands without bodies holding things,\n(c) gloves.\n32. Horse (Jennet) : The dictionary word was Jennet, but the\noriginal was drawn and thought of as Horse.\n33. Moustache : An unlikely original for anyone to draw quite\ncorrectly. Should faces with prominent Moustaches be given a\nwhole point, half a point, or nothing?\n34. Net ; The dictionary word was Net Blotch. This was\nrejected and the agent decided to illustrate Net. The man, beach\nand waves form a setting for the illustration ;\nthe little fish are\nincidental.\n35. Parnassus : The agent was more interested in the Temple\nthan in the Mountain. Consider Greek-type temples (criteria. Pillars,\nSteps, Pediment) with and without Mountains, Mountains in con-\njunction with other types of building. Mountains without buildings.\n36. Praivn : Must be sharply distinguished from Fish. What\nabout Lobsters, Crayfish, Crabs, etc.?\n37. Saturn : Combination of Sphere and Rings, the last being\nmost in agent\u2019s mind on account of difficulty of drawing ellipses\nfreehand.\n\f162] ExpeTiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 147\n38.

Shooting : See contemporary note on original.\n41. Skull : No comments.\n42. Spectacles : No comments, except that as examples (not yet\nobserved) it would be proper to give a hit for pince-nez, but not for\ntwo tumblers (\u2018 a pair of glasses \u2019).\n43. Spinning Top : No comments.\n44. Standard (Royal Standard) : the dictionary word was\nStandard, the agent thought of doing Royal Standard and was\nconcerned to make it other than an ordinary sort of flag ;\nhence the\nrampant beast intended for a lion.\n45. Stop-cock ; No comments.\n46. Violin : No comments.\n47. Throne ; The object at the top is supposed to represent a\ncrown. Consider whether you will give full or half points to Easy\nchairs. Ordinary wooden chairs. Wooden chairs with arms. Chairs\nof definitely ceremonial appearance.\n48. Tree : Trees are drawn with very great frequency and m\nevery degree of prominence, which makes hits on this original\ndifficult to assess. Single trees, wRether sole ,\nco-equal or\nsecondary (Cf. Guide, 7) must clearly be given hits ;\nbut it is not\nalways easy to decide where \u2018\nsecondary \u2019 passes into incidental\ntrimming \u2019.\nIt is also for consideration whether Forests, Woods, Avenues,\nRows of Trees, etc., indicate that the percipient had the idea of \u2018\na\ntree \u2019\nin his mind ;\nalso whether two, three, four ... or how many\ntrees should be given half or full hit.\n49. Trident : The dictionary word was Spear and an illustration\nof \u2018\nHead of Fishing Spear \u2019\nwas copied. Trident was introduced\nby the agent.\nConsider pitchforks with two prongs, Garden forks with more than\nthree prongs. Table forks, Rakes.\n50. WTndmill ; No comments.\nAPPENDIX V\nTwo Notes on the Statistical Methods used\nA. General Comments : by Dr J. 0. Irwdn and Mr Oliver Gatty.\nThe experimental precautions taken should successfully have\n\f148 Whafely Caringtoyi, 31. A., M.Sc. [part, r\neliminated all possibility of the percipients obtaining knowledge of |\u00bb\nthe originals by ordinary sensory processes. Similarly, the random J\u00ae\nprocess by which the originals were chosen should have eliminated #\n( 1 )\nthe use of rational inference as a means of obtaining information\nabout them, (2) effects due to the ideas and associations of experi-\nmenter and percipients running in similar cycles, (3) the possible\neffects of external circumstances causing the experimenter to draw ]\nand the percipients to think of the same idea.\n|\nBut these exj^erimental precautions could not prevent some t\nexperiments having a more popular set of originals than others, !\nparticularly because there were only ten originals in each experi-\nment. Again, more percipients took part in some experiments than\nin others, and these might be expected to be more active than smaller ,\ngroups. 1 A similar effect is to be expected if the generosity of\nmarking varied from one experiment to another, and in fact Mr i\nHindson did mark Expt. I more generously than the others. But \\\nhis ignorance of which drawings belonged to which experiment still '\nqualifies him as a judge, even though he marked the drawings of\nthe first experiment before those of the others.\n'\nThe factors ju.st discussed may be grouped together under the\nheads of varying mean popularity of originals \u2019\nand \u2018\nvarying mean\nactivity of percipients \u2019\nrespectively. The statistical method used\nmakes allowance for the effects of both these groups of factors.\nThere remain specific resemblances between the drawings of the\npercij)ients of a particular experiment and the originals used in a\nparticular experiment (not necessarily the same).\nThus, for example, a Shi]) might be chosen as an original in some\none exj)eriment, and it might happen that the j>eriod of some )\nexperiment (not necessarily the same) might include that during ||\nwhich the Graf Spee was fought and scuttled ;\nor it might be sup- '\nposed that the American ])ercipients of one experiment (IVa,W.W.C.) ;\nwere more prone to draw negroes than were other percipients, and t\nthat a Negro was chosen as an original in some experiment (not !\nnecessarily the same). The effect of this kind of thing would be i)\nartificially to increase the number of hits in the appropriate cell of\nthe 5 X 5 Table namely that corresponding to the experiment con- i\ntaining the original concerned and to the group of percipients I\naffected. Such effects, due to chance, would tend to be eliminated\nj\nas the number of originals used in each experiment was increased ;\n!\nbut we cannot say a priori how strong they would be likely to be,\nActivity is not necessarily ]jroportional to the number of pereipients, since\nsome will have a greater tendency than others to return blank sheets, etc.\n2 E.g. the Table given at the top of Example I, or Table II. W.W.C.\n\f162] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 149\nand it is correspondingly impossible to say how large a nmnber of\noriginals would be necessary to eliminate them or whether ten is\nsufficient for the purpose. But, if they were to occur to any appreci-\nable extent, they could be detected by inspection and their\ngenuineness tested by appropriate tests of significance ; further, it\nis important to note that, owing to the substantially random method\nadopted in choosing the originals, we should expect cells alfected\nin this way to be distributed at random over the 5x5 table, and\nnot merely along its prmcipal diagonal.\nThe probability of a \u2018\nhit \u2019\nbeing scored in the cell corresponding\nto row i and column j is taken to be afifN^, where a^ is the total\nnumber of hits in row i, 6,- the total number of hits in column b,\nand N the grand total number of hits. From this it follows that\nthe expected number of hits in this cell is One may first\nexamine, by means of a test applied to the whole table, whether\nthere are any significant departures from expectation at all, and, if\nthere are, particular cells may then be examined. An approximate\ntest is obtained by calculating the standard error of the number of\nhits in any cell as jNpq, where p is the proportion of the total\nnumber of hits expected to fall in it and q is (1 -p), and using this\nstandard error in conjunction with a table of the normal deviate,\nto find the probability of the observed deviations or greater arising\nas the result of chance alone.\nThe actual statistical test employed was to decide whether the\nnumber of hits scored in the principal diagonal of the 5x5 table\nwas significantly in excess of that expected. For this case the exact\nstandard error has been calculated by Stevens, who treats the\nproblem by considering two packs of N cards each In the first\npack there are cards of a first type, a.^ of a second type . . . and\na\u201e of a last type {n types altogether). In the second pack there are\nof the first type, of a second type . . . of a last type (also n\ntypes altogether). The packs are supposed to be separately shuffled\nand dealt out. If the rth card of the first pack is found to be of the\nsame type as the rth card of the second pack, Stevens calls this a\n\u2018\nhit \u2019\n(he might have called it a \u2018\nsuccess \u2019). He then determines\nthe mean {i.e. expectation) and variance of the number of hits. It\nis important to note that, if two cards which occur in the same {e.g.\nrth) place are called a pair, Stevens\u2019 result is independent of the\norder in which the pairs occirr.\nThe analogy between the drawing experiments and Stevens\u2019\nexample may now be made clear. Any hit in the drawing experi-\n* Loc. cif. Cf. p. 84.\n\f150 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc.

Corresponding to j\nthe fact that one card in each pair belongs to each pack is the fact\nthat every hit is a hit on some original and is made during some\nexperimental period. For mathematical details, Stevens\u2019 paper\nshould be consulted.\n^\nIt is evident from the foregoing that any strongly significant I\nexcess of hits in the principal diagonal of the 5x5 table is prima i\nfacie evidence of the percipients possessing knowledge of some sort i\nabout the originals. :\nIf a significant excess of hits above expectation is found to I\noccur in the principal diagonal, it is possible to recalculate the |\nexpectations in all the cells of the table on the hypothesis that a\ncertain proportion of the drawings made in each experiment is in\nsome way definitely directed on to the originals of that experiment\nwhile the rest are made at random.

G. Soal\nIntroduction\nUntil the autumn of 1939 I still helieved that it was practically\nimjiossible\u2014at any rate in England\u2014to find subjects who could\ndemonstrate Extra-Sensory Cognition by guessing at the geometrical\nfigures on Zener cards. This scepticism was not perhaps without\nits justification since during the past five years I had, without any\napparent success, tested 160 persons and recorded 128,350 guesses.\nI drew attention to this record of persistent failure by articles in the\nPress and by lectures given to the British Psychological Society in\nLondon, to the Scottish branch in Glasgow, to the Society for\nPsychical Research and to the Ghost Club. At a meeting of the\nGhost Club in March 1938 I read a paper on the snags and pitfalls\nwhich beset the path of the inexpert investigator. I pointed out\nthat many of Dr Rhine s experiments had been inadequately\nreported and that some of his earlier successes might be accounted\nfor by the guessers gaining clues from the backs of the cards. A\nlittle later m h.P.R. Proceedings, Part 154, pp. 86-96, I defended\nRhine against the attacks of an American psychologist Professor\nKellogg whose remarks revealed an ignorance of statistical method\nas amazing as it was lamentable.\nIn fairness I must add that though Dr Rhine\u2019s early work was\nopen to criticism this no longer ajiplies to many of the investigations\nwhich are now being reported in the Journal of Parapsychology.\nIndeed, the sources of error in the card-guessing techniques have\nnow been thoroughly ex]dored and there is no excuse if the experi-\nmenters of today make the same mistakes as the pioneers of five or\nten years ago.\nLast November my growing scepticism received a shock. The\nremarkable results obtained by Mr Vv hately Carington in experi-\nments carried out under rigorous comlitions and with methods and\nmaterial differing from my own were brought to my notice. With\nremarkable jiertinacity Mr Carington insisted that I should re-\nexamine my experimental data. He suggested that I should com-\npare eacli guess, not with the card for which it was originally\n152\n\f153\n[PAKT 162]\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing\nintended, l)ut with the immediately preceding and the immediately\nfollowing card and count up the hits. For, according to Mr Caring-\nton, the faculty of extra-sensory cognition might not always succeed\nin hitting the object at which it was aimed. Just as a rifleman\nmay show a personal bias which causes him persistently to strike\nthe target at a point to the left or right of the bull\u2019s eye, so it might\nhappen that the guesser at Zener cards all unwittingly was guessing\ncorrectly\u2014not the card the experimenter was looking at\u2014but a\ncard which was one or two places earlier or later in the sequence.\nCarington even suggested that this \u201c wobbly \u201d type of perception\nmight prove eventually to be more widespread than the exact type\nof cognition which so many experimenters have searched for in vain.\nAnd indeed, there is a vast amount of experience drawn from sittings\nwith psychometrists and other psychical sensitives which goes to\nsuggest that these sid^jects can seldom divine those thoughts which\nare in the focus of attention. They will refer to some trifling event\nknown to the sitter, which happened last week or yesterday or a\nyear ago, and make no mention at all of what is occupying their\nchent\u2019s mind at the moment.\nIt was, however, in no very hopeful spirit that I began the task of\nsearching my records for this \u2018\u2018displacement\u201d effect. And yet\nwithin a few weeks I had made two quite remarkable finds, which\nfully confirmed Carington\u2019s conjectures. From my records of the\nguesses of 160 persons I had discovered two whose results exhibited\nthe kind of effect anticipated by Carington.\nIn Part I of this paper I shall describe the methods employed and\nmake a general statistical analysis of the background of the experi-\nment since it is a cardinal principle that any selected batch of results\nwhich appears significant must be estimated in its relation to the\ntotal amount of material which has been collected. Part I, therefore,\nmay read like a dreary tale of negative results, and though it is\nreally an essential preparation for the study of Mrs S. and Mr B. S.\nin Part II, the ordinary reader may skip it if he so prefers and pass\non to the more important pages of Part II.\nAcknowledgements\nTo mention by name the many scores of persons who have\nassisted me in the present investigation by acting either as per-\ncipients or witnesses would be clearly impossible even if it were\ndesirable. Nevertheless I offer them all my hearty thanks for their\nco-operation and there are a lesser number of individuals whom I\nfeel I must thank personally for the part they have played. Mr\nK\n\f154 S. G. Soal [part\nW'liately Carington is the ])rime instigator of all that this paper\ncontains of value and, besides insjriring it, he has been ever ready\nto work out tiresome computations. For instance, he made an\nelaborate analysis of the distribution for the Pure Clairvoyance\nexperiments, and if I am not able to publish it in full, this is merely\nfor reasons of space. To Dr R. H. Thouless I am indebted for\nmuch acute criticism and many valuable suggestions at different\nstages of the work. He also saw the experiments in progress in\nMarch 1935 and made suggestions which 1 adopted. My thanks\nare due to Professor Burt and Professor Fliigel for their interest and\nfor kindly putting the Psychological Laboratory at University\nCollege at my disposal. Professor E. S. Pearson gave me valuable\nhelp with tlie statistics of the sul^ject, and devoted much time to\nthe elucidation of knotty points. I must thank Mr Harry Price\nfor the cards and other material and for the use of the quiet room\nat 13d Roland Gardens. Mr H. S. Collins assisted me as a witness\nfor several months. Miss Rita Elliott has made a large number\nof very tedious \u201c counts \u201d extending over a year. These have all\nbeen checked by me and it was seldom that 1 discovered a mistake.\nMrs Goldney very kindly organised the investigation of Mrs Eileen\nGarrett, one of Dr Rhine\u2019s subjects. (Cf. Proceedings, Part 154.)\nMrs Johnstone, a member of the Society, and her daughter Miss\nV. Johnstone, undertook many journeys to Richmond to assist me\nin the investigation of Mrs S. described in Part II.\nPART I\nThe General Background\n]. The Cards.\nThe Zener cards used throughout this investigation were made\nunder the direction of Mr Harry Price by a firm of playing-card\nmanufacturers, and the backs were similar to those of the firm\u2019s\nordinary playing cards. It will not be necessary to describe the\nbacks of the cards in detail, since they were never exposed to the\ngaze of the subjects while the latter were making their guesses.\nThe card to be guessed was either covered by a rectangle of white\ncardboard, or completely hidden by a screen, or, in a few cases, sealed\nin an opaque envelope.\nOn the faces of the cards the five symbols -f , 0, Star, Rectangle\nand Wavy Lines were printed in thin red lines. From the outset\nI have rendered it impossible for the guessers to \u201c learn \u201d the cards\n\f162]\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing 155\nfrom specks, etc., on their backs or to recognise them from impres-\nsions showing faintly through the backs. This was done by (i) never\nallowing the subjects to guess at the cards with their backs exposed,\nand (ii) by never using the same pack twice, for the same guesser,\nin an afternoon\u2019s work.\nIf one uses a single pack or two and shuffles the pack perfunctorily\nafter each set of 25 guesses, there is a possibility that successive sets\nof 25 card symbols may be correlated and, though the effect of this\non the expectation of successes may be only slight, I determined\nto avoid this possibility by compiling by the use of Mathematical\nTables a random sequence of 1000 card symbols. This series was\nthen split up into 40 consecutive blocks of 25 cards. The 40 sets\nof 25 were put into 40 envelopes which were numbered 1-40 and kept\nin two cardboard boxes, each containing 20 envelopes. Originally\nthe 40 blocks were in the order of the random series, and the envelopes\nstood in their numerical order in the boxes. The first time after\nsuch a new random series had been compiled the percipients worked\nthrough the envelopes in the order in which they stood in the boxes.\nBut when the thousand cards had been guessed the envelopes were\nshuffled in the boxes and before each pack was used the cards were\nthemselves shuffled out of the subjects\u2019 sight. The greatest care\nwas taken in clairvoyance experiments to prevent the subject from\ncatching a glimpse of the bottom card of the pack.\nAt the beginning of each week\u2019s work the packs were taken out\nof the envelopes and the envelopes shuffled among themselves and\nthe packs replaced so that the pack which was, say, in envelope 19\nwas now to be found in, say, number 12. This was to prevent\nsubjects who came week after week from learning the composition\nof the packs in any of the envelopes.\nA fresh random distribution of 1000 cards was compiled on an\naverage after every 4000 guesses, and 31 such distributions were\ncompiled from the tables during the five years\u2019 investigation. To\nbe strictly accurate, the first random distribution by means of tables\nwas made in January 1935 after about 1700 guesses had been\nrecorded. The cards arrived at 13d Roland Gardens in November\n1934 and were contained in 240 envelopes. Each envelope held\nfive cards, one of each symbol, and 200 of these envelopes were\nemptied on to a large table, so that all the cards were face down-\nwards. The cards were thoroughly mixed by Mr Price, Miss\nBeenhan and myself and then picked up into packs of 25 by the\nthree of us, consecutive cards being chosen at random from different\nparts of the pile.\nOne distinct advantage of a random distribution is to be found\n\f156 S. G. Soal [part\nin the fact that the binomial distribution can be applied to any\nlarge group of cards and guesses even if this is not composed of\nexact multiples of 25. This is of importance when, as in Part II,\nthe groups may consist of 22, 23 or 24 cards.\nThis random sequence was compiled as follows. I had at my\ndisposal exactly 1200 cards, there being 240 of each symbol. I first\nassociated with each of the symbols + , 0, Star, Rectangle, Wave\nthe respective numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I then provided myself with\nChambers\u2019 Seven-figure Mathematical Tables, and read from them\nthe last digits of the logarithms of the following numbers :\n10078, 10178, 10278, . . . 99978.\nThe numbers chosen were thus taken at intervals of 100, so as to\nensure that the last digits in the logarithms should be independent.\nIf the digit happened to be one of the numbers 1 to 5 the digit was\nentered on the list, or more exactly the corresjionding symbol was\nwritten. If the digit happened to be 0 or 6, 7, 8, 9, it was not entered.\nFrom this sequence I thus obtained a random series of about 450\ncards. The process was then rej^eated with, say, the following\nnumbers :\n10043, 10143, 10243, . . . 99943,\nand so on until a list of 1000 cards had been compiled. The actual\ncards were then chosen one by one according to the above list from\nthe 1200 cards in my possession.\nIn the end there were of course not exactly 200 cards of each\nsymbol, and up to January 1937 I made the mistake of adding or\nremoving a few cards in sTich a way as to disturb the distribution\nas little as possible until I had exactly 200 cards of each symbol.\nThis, however, is of small importance since few of the subjects did\nas many as 1000 guesses at a sitting, and when they arrived the\nfollowing week, the packs of cards had been reshuffled in the 40\nenvelopes. After January 1937 I made random distributions\nwithout the above adjustment.\n2. The Subjects.\nIn the summer of 1934 we circularised more than a hundred\npersons living in or around London who had taken part in my long-\ndistance experiments of the years 1928-1929. Between 40 and 50\npeople responded, and ultimately some 23 ofthese came to 13d Roland\nGardens to take part in the new experiments. Several of these\npersons claimed to have had psychic experiences of various kinds.\nThe experi'nents began on 28 November 1934, and all the subjects\n\f162]\n157\nFresh Light on Card-Chnessing\nwho came to be tested were started in the (P.C.A.) techniqiied\nSome dropped out after doing no more than 50 or 100 guesses but a\ngood many completed 500 (or in some cases 450) (P.C.A.) guesses\nand then went on to do another 500 (or 550) using the (P.C.B.)\ntechnique. As the weeks went by other subjects were obtained,\nsome through the kindness of Professor Burt at University College,\nLondon. The summer and autimm terms of 1935 were devoted\nchiefly to undifferentiated experiments in telepathy-cum-clair-\nvoyance (U.T.). In November 1935 in the hope of providing a\nstimulus we offered valualile money prizes for persons who were\nable to score 12 or more hits in 25 guesses under controlled condi-\ntions. Though we gave publicity to these offers the response was\nvery disappointing. Probably most people thought there was a\n\u201c catch \u201d in it, or that the prizes were offered for humanly impossible\nfeats. Nevertheless it is worth noting that as a result of reading\nan article on the experiments in which the challenge to score more\nthan twelve hits was displayed we secured the services of Mr B. S.,\none of our two principal subjects. Mr B. S. came to 13d Boland\nGardens in the early part of 1936, not to win the prize, but l)ecause\nhe felt confident he could accept the challenge.\nIn the autumn of 1936 I circularised about fifty spiritualist\nmediums whose names were in a book of reference just published.\nAs a result one well-known automatic writer, one fairly well-known\ntrance medium and four lesser known clairvoyantes came to be\ntested at Roland Gardens or elsewhere. All the results were\nnegative. In November 1936 in the hope of finding fresh and\nyounger subjects I removed the experiment to the Psychological\nLaboratory at University College. Here through the interest of\nProfessors Burt and Pliigel, my colleagues on the University of\nLondon Council for Psychical Investigation, I was accommodated\nin a cubicle, and the work in (U.T.) was continued with young\nstudents taking the courses in Psychology, while several of the\npost-graduate students rendered material assistance by acting as\nwitnesses or agents. Here I was able to examine students of varied\nnationalities including over a dozen Indians, two Chinese, two\nEgyptians, one American, one Greek and several from the nearer\nparts of Europe. In the summer vacation of 1936 I tested four\nmembers of a Welsh family at their home in North Mnles using\nthe (P.C.B.) technique. One of these, a young man of 21, was a\nhypnotic subject in whom I was able to induce sensory anaesthesia\nto deep pricking with a needle. He was unsuccessful, however,\n^ The precise meanings of the terms (P.C.A.), (P.C.B.), and (U.T.) will be\nexplained shortly (pp. 158-163).\n\f158 S. G. Soal [part\nwhen tested in the liypnotic state with 500 (P.C.B.) guesses, obtaining\nonly 105 correct hits. Another professional hypnotic subject was\ntested with both (U.T.) and (P.C.B.) at University College. This\nsubject, a man of about 45, showed very marked ability to recognise\na playing card by minute specks on the back when the card was\nmixed with five others. He was not allowed to touch any of the\ncards, and the recognition was shown to be purely visual. In the\nnormal state he obtained no more than chance results in experiments\nof this kind, while in the hy[motic state he succeeded in the experi-\nment ten times out of ten. When, however, he was tested with\nthe (P.C.B.) and (U.T.) techniques, he failed completely, obtaining\nonly 105 correct hits in .500 (P.C.B.) experiments and 63 correct\nhits in 3-50 (U.T.) experiments.\nOne blind Indian subject was tested for (P.C.B.) at University\nCollege. As I lifted off each card he was allowed to lay his finger\non its edge only. However, he scored only 94 successes in 500\nguesses.\nIn the summer term of 1937 Mrs Garrett was investigated with\n12,425 guesses. She is the only one of Dr Rhine\u2019s subjects I have\nbeen able to test, and the results have been already published.\nDuring the summer and autumn of the same year twelve other\npersons were tested by the \u201c screened matching \u201d (U.T.M.) tech-\nnique. The si)ring and summer of 1938 were devoted mainly to\nfurther experiments in Pure Clairvoyance using the (P.C.B.) method\nonly. In the autumn of the same year and winter of the next more\nUniversity College students were tested for clairvoyance by the\n(P.C.S.) method, an opaque screen being placed between the guesser\nand the cards.\nThe Techniques Employed\n1 . Pure Clairvoyance.\nFive distinct methods were used which I shall denote by (P C A )\n(P.C.B.), (P.C.S.), (P.C.D.), and (P.C.M.).\n\/ v\n\u2022\n\u2022\no,\n(i) {P.C.A.) and {P.C.B.).\nThe only essential difference between the (P.C.A.) and (P.C.B.)\nmethods is that with the former the checking up was done after\nevery five guesses with the guesser looking on, while in the latter\nthe checking was not done until the 25 guesses were complete and\nthe guesser was not allowed to watch the checking. If it is possible\nfor card-guessers to improve by practice it is clearly necessary as\nin any other kind of skill that they should know exactly where they\n\f159\n162] Fresh Light on Card-Guessing\nhave made mistakes and so learn what introspective feeling is\nassociated with a correct guess, and the (P.C.A.) method to some\nextent provided for this. No serious objection attaches to the\nmethod provided that a mathematically random series of card\nsymbols is used. It would, for imstance, be a fatal procedure if Dr\nRhine\u2019s packs were used containing exactly live of each symbol,\nbut with a random sequence, by noting what has already turned up\none learns nothing about what is to come since the chance of each\nsymbol appearing at any stage is always exactly one fifth.\nIt was my original intention to make each subject perform 500\ntests by the (P.C.A.) method and then proceed to another 500 using\nthe (P.C.B.) method. Until the year 1936 this plan was as a rule\nadhered to, but after that year I dispensed with the (P.C.A.) method\naltogether and allowed new percipients to start at once with (P.C.B.).\nIn fact, I had found that the subjects did not improve as they went\non with the (P.C.A.) method.\nThree persons are, as a general rule, present at the experiments.\nThey are the guesser or subject (S), the experimenter (E), (myself\nwith few exceptions), and the witness (W). They are seated as\nshown in the figure, the experimenter and subject facing one\nanother and about three feet apart. The witness sits\nat the end of the table as shown. The experimenter S\nis the person who deals out the cards and generally\nsupervises the procedure. The witness, who must be W\nan intelligent and observant person, is present to keep\na duplicate record of guesses and cards and to watch E\nevery detail of recording and procedure. The experi-\nmenter and witness are each provided with a scoring sheet foolscap\nsize and designed to accommodate two sets of 25 guesses. For each\nset of 25 there are two columns, the one on the left headed (G)\n(guesses) and the one on the right headed (A) (actual cards). The\ntwo columns are divided into 25 rectangular cells. There are also\nspaces on the record sheet for Name of Subject, Date, Number of\nPack, Time of first and last guesses for each 25, Remarks, Totals\nCorrect, and a statement at the bottom of each sheet which reads ;\n\u201c This independent record has been checked with the duplicate and\nfound to agreeC\u2014Signed .\nThe experimenter is also provided with a clean white rectangle\nof cardboard, just a little larger than a Zener card, and cut from a\npostcard. As has been described on p. 155, the random series of\n1000 cards is ready for use in 40 envelopes each containing 25 cards,\nthe envelopes being in a determined order in two cardboard boxes\non the table.\n\f160 S. G. Soal [PAET\nIn the (P.C.A.) technique the experimenter takes the proper |\nenvelope from the box and, holding it below the level of the table,\nremoves the pack of 25 cards which he shuffles (unless a new random !\ndistribution has just been made) beneath the table. He next rests |\nthe ]iack face downwards on the palm of his left hand and covers\nit with the rectangle of white card. He now raises the palm of his\nleft hand until the white card just reaches the level of the table.\n'With the thuml) and forefinger of his right hand he slides off the\ntop card on to the table, covered by the rectangle of white card.\nHe then immediately lowers the pack again below the level of the table.\nThe guesser or subject (S) now calls aloud his guess for the covered\ncard lying on the table. Both experimenter and witness record the\nguess in the appropriate cells of their scoring sheets in the (G) column.\nThe experimenter then removes with his right hand the covering\ncard, puts it over the pack which still rests on his left palm beneath\nthe table, raises the pack and slides off the next card and so on.\nThe \u201c guessed \u201d cards are placed in a pile, or sometimes in rows, with\ntheir faces downward, care being taken not to disturb the original I\norder. In the (P.C.A.) technique, after five cards have been guessed,\nthey are turned over l;)y the witness and he and the experimenter\nrecord them in the A columns of their sheets. The subject takes\nnote of his successes, watching the checking. When the column\nof 25 cards is complete\u2014after 5 such checkings have taken place\n\u2014\nthe experimenter and witness tick off the correct hits and enter the\ntotals, time of last guess, etc., at the foot of the column. They\nthen compare scoring sheets card by card and guess by guess to see\nthat they tally. In j^oint of fact, errors are very rarely found, but\nthey can usually lie rectified liy a reference to the pack whose cards\nstill retain their original order. Both witness and experimenter\nsign the statement referred to above when the two sets of 25 are\ncomplete, each person signing on both sheets. The next envelope\nm order is then taken out of the box and the work proceeds.\nIn the (P.C.B.) technique the cards are not checked until the tale\nof 25 guesses are complete. The subject (S) then waffls away to a\nremote part of the room, or sits behind the screen if one is on the\ntable, and in his alisence E and W check up and fill in the blank A\ncolumns of their sheets.\nThe average \\m\\% for guessing 25 cards was nearly I minutes with\n(P.C.B. ), but in rapid work it may be reduced to 11-2 minutes.\nSlow guessers took from 5-7 minutes. The sulijects as\" a rule were\nallowed to choose their own tempo. Usually a subject guessed\nfrom 200-250 cards in an afternoon, but certain rapid guessers did\n500 or more guesses in an afternoon. After the visit of Professor\n\fFresh Light 07i Card-Chiessing 161\n162]\nThouless to 13d Koland Gardens on March 28, 1935, I did not,\nexcept under special circumstances, allow any other persons than\nE, W and S to be in the room during the guessing, but as a rule two\nor three subjects were examined consecutively in the same after-\nnoon, appointments being made for them to come at specified times.\nx\\t the end of each afternoon\u2019s work, the last witness placed the\nduplicate scoring sheets in an envelope, sealed it in my presence\nand posted it as soon as possible to Dr Joad. The other copies were\nretained by me.\nI consider that the keeping of independent records by both witness\nand experimenter during the guessing practically eliminates errors\narising from the mishearing of calls, from slips in entry, etc. The\nabbreviations used for recording are (plus sign), 0 (circle),\nS (five pointed star), | |\n(rectangle), and W (W avy Lines).\n(ii) [P.C.S.). 26 persons took jiart in this technique between\nJanuary 1938 and January 1939. None of these except Miss E. S.\nhad taken part in any of the previous experiments. The subject (S)\nand the witness C\\\u00a5) sat at the ends of a deal table facing each other\nand at about 4 feet apart. Between them was an opaque light\nwooden screen measuring about 3' broad by 2' 6\" high. The screen\nrested on the table, there being no gap between the screen and table.\nThe experimenter (E) sat on the same side of\nthe screen as (W), but at the side of the table\nclose to the screen as shown in the figure.\nThe pack of cards rested face downwards on\ng\nthe table close to the screen on the same side\n\u2019\nas the witness. The experimenter, having\nshuffled the pack behind the screen, laid it face\ndownwards on the table near the centre of the\nscreen. He then enquired if the subject was ready, lifted off the\ntop card and laid it face downwards on the table without looking\nat it. At the same time he called out \u201c First guess \u2019\nor \u201c Next\n\u201d\nas the case might be. The subject on the other side of the screen\ncalled aloud his guess which was recorded by both witness and\nexperimenter. The subject was not allowed to move from his seat\nbehind the screen during the checking which was done at the end\nof each 25 guesses. He was told, however, how many correct\nguesses he had made at the end of each 25 and given encouragement\nfor a good score.\n(iii) {P.C.M.). The only subjects who used this technique were\nMrs Garrett and Miss E. S. It is the \u201c screen and pointer \u201d method\nfully described in my paper on Mrs Garrett in S.P.R. Proceedings,\nPart 154, p. 74. I shall therefore refer the reader to this report.\n\f162 S. G. Soal [part\n(iv) (P.C.D.). This is the \u201c Down Through \u201d method often used\nby Dr Rhine. I have only employed it with three subjects one of j\nwhom was \u201c Marion \u201d (Josef Kraus), the well-known vaudeville\ntelepathist. The method was as follows. In the case of \u201c Marion \u201d j\nthe experimenter (myself), the witness (Miss Elliott or Mrs Goldney) !\nand the guesser sat at a table, Marion being provided with a scoring\nsheet. I took one of the envelopes from the box and holding it\nunder the table shuffled the cards and replaced them in the envelope.\nI then placed the envelope on the table with the flap closed and a\nrubber band round the envelope to keep it closed. \\\\Jiile the cards\nwere under the table and before they were shuffled, Marion was\nallowed to touch them once as he claimed that this was essential if\nhenvas to succeed. The envelope containing the cards was placed\nin front of Marion on the table flap downwards. He now wrote\ndown on his scoring sheet with extreme rapidity a series of 25 card\nsymbols. When he had finished I ran through the list asking him\nto say cpiite definitely what any carelessly drawn symbol was\nintended to represent. This was essential as Marion sometimes\nmade his rectangles very like his circles. I was also particularly\ncareful to see that Marion did not get a glance at the last card in the\npack, since some records which he showed me of solo ex]:)eriments\nproved that he had been scoring significantly by unwittingly getting\na glimpse of the last card as he laid the envelope on the table, no\nrubber band having been used. After we were satisfied about the\nentries in the guess column we took the carrls out of the envelope\nand checked up with Marion watching. Under these more rigorous\nconditions Marion failed to score above chance expectation, though he\nstill continued to produce for our inspection highly significant scores\nthat he had made while working alone. These amounted to tens\nof thousands of guesses, and the high scores were to be partly\naccounted for by the fact that Marion managed to glimpse the last\ncard in the pack, probably without being aware of it.\nAs regards the other two D.T. subjects who only did 100 guesses\neach, the method in each case was as follows. The sul)ject sat in a\nfar corner of the room and callefl aloud a series of 25 symbols which\nwere recorded by both exj)erimenter and witness. I had previously\nshuffled a pack of cards under the table and replaced them in an\nenvelope which rested on the tal)le during the calling. No extra-\nchance results were obtained.\n2. Undifferentialed Extra-Sensori\/ Perception. [(U.T.) and (U.T.M.)]\nExperiments in which the telepathic possibility was included, as\nwell as the possibility of clairvoyance, were commenced at 13d Roland\n\f163\n102] Fresh Light on Card-Guessing\nGardens shortly after Easter 1935. We have made no experiments\nin Pure Telepathy. I thought it best to try each subject with\nseveral different agents in turn, since success might conceivably\ndepend upon some quality inherent in the subconscious mind of the\ntransmitter no less than upon powers possessed by the percipient\nhimself. The experiments were continued at University College\nbetween November 1936 and September 1937 . In all the telepathy\nexperiments the subject was separated from the agent and experi-\nmenter by a screen.\nAs in my paper on Mrs Garrett, I shall refer to the two techniques\nemployed as (U.T.) and (U.T.M.). At 13d Roland Gardens the\nagent and subject who worked together were practically strangers\nto each other, and generally met at the laboratory for the first time.\nBut in one case a mother and daughter played the parts of subject\nand agent, in another a father and daughter, in a third two lirothers\nand in two other cases pairs of close friends. At University College\nthe agent and subject were often friends or at least acquainted.\nIf any code was used to convey the card symbols to the subject\non the other side of the screen, such a code would have to be (i) a\n\u201c timing \u201d code or (ii) an auditory code consisting of such sounds as\ncoughs, scraping or tapping of feet, sounds of hand-movements on\ntable or of pencil, blowing and so on. The possibility of (i) is ruled\nout by the fact that I dealt out the cards in my own time and gave\nthe signal \u201c Next \u201d at my own pleasure. The agent, who was not\nallowed to speak during the guessing, sat close to me and a vertical\nboard fixed lieneath the talile prevented the giiesser from seeing his\nfeet or legs or making contact with them. As a result of special\ntests we found that if this precaution is omitted, it is easily possible\nfor the agent to use a code consisting of such movements as opening\nand closing the heels, crossing the toe of one boot over the other, all\nof which motions are so slight that they cannot be detected unless\nthe experimenter is looking under the table.\nAs regards possibihty (ii) (of auditory codes), whenever I heard the\nagent make any unusual noise I made a secret mark opposite tlie\nguess on my scoring sheet and waited to see if the noise were repeated\nwhen the same card-symbol was turned up again. I never, however,\nsucceeded in detecting any auditory code.\nI have taken no special precautions to obviate the possibility of the\nso-called \u201c involuntary whispering \u201d by the agent or normal leakage\nthrough involuntary changes in breathing. Had I discovered\nany subjects who scored positive results over any considerable\nperiod I should have tried the effect of distance on the results. But\nI think the very fact that 82 subjects who tried the telepathy experi-\n\f164 S. G. Soal [part\nments obtained no apparent success of any kind strongly indicates\nthat if \u201c involuntary whispering \u201d ever helps persons to score\nbeyond chance this effect must be an excessively rare one.\nA certain subject, Mr H.\u2014a Chinese student at University College,\nwho had been credited by an investigator (who was testing the ability\nof students to interpret correctly subliminal auditory impressions)\nwith the power of discriminating faintly whispered words that were\nbelow his normal threshold of recognition\u2014s'ubmitted to 800\n(U.T.M.) experiments but obtained only 171 correct hits as against the\n160 expected by chance. After completing this series he did another\n200 tests one day when he was fresh with Miss Elliott acting as\nagent. I asked Miss Elliott to whisper very faintly the name of\neach card wliile she looked at it. Mr H. who was sitting 4' away\nfrom the agent\u2014the normal distance\u2014scored only 36 correct hits. I\nI then let him do another 200 guesses with Miss Elliott now whisper-\ning repeatedly the name of each card far more loudly than before.\nHe scored 47 successes, a result which is again without significance.\nThe other conditions were exactly the same as in the (U.T.) experi-\nments.\nIt will be obvious that the (U.T.) results scored by the two subjects\nMrs &. and Mr B. S. in Bart II could not reasonably be attributed\nto involuntary whispering \u201d or even to the use of a code between\nsubject and agent.\n(i) The {U.T.) technique.\nThe room at 13d Roland Gardens was first systematically exa-\nmined for the possibility of reflecting surfaces that might enable the\nguesser to see the exposed card even while sitting behind the screen.\nAs a result of a great many experiments carried out by Mr H. S.\nCollins and myself it was found that the only source of reflection that\nmight give any assistance to a guesser was the sliding glass lid of a\nbookcase. At the commencement of each afternoon\u2019s work this\nwas adjusted by sliding it up. In the cubicle at University College,\nI satisfied myself that wdien the screen was in use, there were no\nreflecting surfaces that would give the suljject any assistance.\nAt Roland Gardens the subject and agent (who also acts as\nwitness) w'ere seated at each end of a table about 5\u2019 apart and, resting\non the centre of the table, w'as a plywmod screen, measuring 3\u2019 by 3\u2019\nand suspended by cords from the ceiling. There was no crevice\nbetween the bottom of the screen and the table. The experimenter\n(myself) sat on the same side of the screen as the agent but at the\nside of the table and close to the screen. The experimenter and the\nsubject (unless the latter was in trance) w'ere each provided with a\n\f162]\n165\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing\nscoring sheet identical with that used in the (P.C.) experiments.\nBeneath the table a vertical board was fixed which prevented the\nsubject from seeing the agent\u2019s feet or legs. Thus every part of the\nagent\u2019s body was screened from the guesser\u2019s view.\nThe experimenter was also provided with five rubber stamps of\nsimilar make and weight together with a red or green ink-pad.\nThe impressions produced by the stamps on the scoring sheet\nmeasured about by\nTo have used a pen or pencil for recording the actual card syinbols\nwould have been fatal, since a number of tests showed that if the\nexperimenter recorded his card before the subject had made his\nguess, the latter was able to recognise the -h by the lifting of the\npencil, the rectangle | ]\nby the time taken to draw it, and so on,\nand most of the symbols could be identified by the sound of the pencil\nstrokes. It might of course be suggested that as the rubber parts\nof the five stamps were slightly different in size or shape, this might\nlead to auditory discrimination of the symbols. But this rather\nfar-fetched hypothesis is refuted by the fact that 84 people did the\nexperiment and all failed at such delicate discrimination both\nindividually and in the mass.\nAt University College the same screen was used, being fixed in a\nvertical position by wooden guides attached to the wall, but the\ndistance between guesser (S) and agent (W) was only about four feet.\nThe same or precisely similar rubber stamps were used of which I\nhad three sets.\nThe pack rested on the table near the centre of the screen face\ndownwards. The experimenter closed his eyes, lifted off the top\ncard and held it close to the screen its face towards the agent. With\nclosed eyes the experimenter called out \u201c First guess \u2019\nor Next\nas the case might be. This was the signal to the subject that the\nagent had begun to look at the card. The experimenter then\nquickly opened his eyes and recorded the card-symbol in the\nA column of his scoring sheet by means of the appropriate rubber\nstamp. Meanwhile the subject behind the screen recorded his guess\nin pencil in the G column without calling it aloud. As a signal that\nhe had made his guess the subject tapped twice on the table with\nhis pencil. By this method the experimenter, who did not know\nwhat card he had lifted from the pack until he had opened his eyes,\ncould give nothing away by the inflections of his voice. No words\nwere spoken during the guessing except the words of the signal.\nThe guessed cards were placed face downwards on the table in a\npile, care being taken not to disturb the order. W hen the\ncolumn of 25 guesses was complete the subject without leaving his\n\f166 S. G. Soal [PABT I\nse.at behind the screen handed his scoring sheet, with the G column ;\nfilled in to the experimenter. The latter with the agent watching 1\nclosely copied the subject\u2019s G column on to his own scoring sheet and\nfilled in the sul)ject\u2019s enij^ty A column from the record of his own i\nscoring sheet. The agents were all specially instructed to watch\nevery step of the checking and a comparison was made of the two\nsheets guess by guess. The agent and experimenter each signed\nboth records, the successful guesses having ticks placed opposite\nthem and tlie totals for each 25 being entered at the bottom of the\ncolumn. The subject remained behind the screen during the\nchecking. He was informed of his score after each 25 guesses and\npraised when he made seven or more correct hits.\nBefore starting work with a fresh subject or agent, we usually\nheld a preliminary consultation as to tlie nature of the imagery to\nj\nbe em])loyed by the agent. For instance, if the agent claimed to be\nj\na good visualiser, it woidd be agreed that he should glance at the |\nexposed card, shut his eyes and imagine the symbol drawn in red j\npaint on a white canvas or with chalk on a blackboard. In other\ncases it was decided that the agent should represent to himself the\n\u201c ^Vave \u201d by an image of waves breaking on a beach, the cross by\na cluster of wooden crosses in a war cemetery, etc. In a few cases\nthe agent employed either visual or auditory verbal imagery. But\nin every case it was firmly impressed on the agent that during the\nguessing he must keep his lips firndg closed.\nA hen one kind of imagery failed we sometimes changed it for\nanother. In certain cases it was agreed that the agent should\nglance once at the card ,\nshut his eyes and dismiss it from his mind\nl)y thinking of something quite different.\nIn the case of eight of the subjects they were asked to grade each\nguess according to their introspective feeling of certainty or un-\ncertainty, the four grades being A, B, C anti D. After each guess\nthe subject wrote opposite the guess one of these letters. They\nwere understood to signify\nA = Very certain the guess is right.\nB = Only moderately certain.\nC = Not very certain.\nD = Feel it is a mere shot in the dark.\nBut an analysis of the scores of these eight subjects shows that\nneither individually nor in the mass are the guesses marked A and B\nany more successful than those marked 0 and D. Many subjects\nbelieved that introspection interfered with the spontaneity of their\n\f167\n162] Fresh Light on Card-Guessing\n^uessing and for this reason I did not care to burden the majority\nwith this extra task.\nThree subjects whose scores in (U.T.) had been hitherto un-\nsuccessful were each dosed with caffeine citrate to see if any improve-\nment would result. Each subject on three different days was made\nto swallow doses varying from 6-10 grains of the drug about twenty\nminutes before commencing work. No effect was noted in any\ncase.\n(ii) {U.T.M.). {Screened-Matching Technique.)\nThirteen subjects including Mrs Garrett were tested by this\nmethod in the summer and autumn of 1937. The technique is not\na very rigorous one, but even so, no significant degree of success\nwas scored by its use.\nThe subject sat behind a black metal screen measuring two feet\nbroad by one foot 6 inches high which stood on the table. Between\nthe bottom edge of the screen and the table was a gap | inch high\nthrough which the subject could push a hght metal pointer. The\nscreen stood over the centre line of a row of five \u201c target \u201d cards\nbearing in order the symbols, -f-, 0, btar. Rectangle, M ave and\nfixed faces upwards to tbe table by means of drawing pins. Between\neach pair of cards was a gap of about J inch.\nThe agent and subject faced each other on opposite sides of the\nscreen, while the experimenter sat at the side of the table close to\nthe screen and on the same side as the agent. The experimenter\nheld the pack of 25 cards close to the centre of the screen with the\nbacks of the cards towards the agent\u2019s face. Having enquired if\nthe subject was ready to begin the experimenter closed his eyes and\nhfted off the top card of the pack for the agent to visualise. ^With\nclosed eyes the experimenter called out \u201c First Guess \u201d or \u201c Next\n\u201d\nas the case might be. Immediately the card was exposed the agent\nlooked at it and then formed a visual image in his mind or sometimes\na verbal image of the name of the card. The agent remained\nsilent throughout. When the subject\u2019s pointer had come quite\ndefinitely to rest on one of the five target \u201d cards the experimenter\nwho had opened his eyes immediately after giving the signal placed\nthe exposed card face downwards opposite the target card\nchosen by the subject. At the end of 25 guesses the 25 cards thus\nfound themselves arranged in five piles, all the cards being face\ndownwards.\nTo prevent confusion by mixing, the five piles were planted at\nconsiderably wider intervals than were the target cards but in\nthe same order as the latter. A count was then made of the successes\n\f168 S. G. Soal [part\nunder each symbol, and these were recorded on tlie scoring sheet by\nthe experimenter thus ;\n(+ 1\n0 0\nS 2\nR 1\n[W 1\nThe count was caretully checked by the agent. In these experiments\nthe distance between subject and agent was about 4 feet.\nThe chief danger of this method lies in the possibility that the\nagent or experimenter watching the motion of the pointer along the\nrow of cards may make some involuntary audible movement that\nwill cause the guesser to stop the pointer opposite the correct card\nwhich of course is known to both agent and experimenter. The\noljjection does not apply to the similar (P.C.M.) technique in which\nneither agent nor experimenter know the symbol on the exposed\ncard.\nAn even more serious disadvantage is that this method does not\nreadily permit of the experimenter obtaining an exact record of\neach card opposite its corresponding guess. It is therefore quite\nunsuited for the study of such \u201c displacement \u201d effects as those\ndescribed in Part II, and it is a matter of some regret that I allowed\nMrs S., one of the principal percipients, to waste as many as 925\ntrials on this technique.\nFormulae and Methods\nFor the (P.C.A.) and (P.C.B.) experiments I have calculated the\nexpectation of correct hits in three ways and the variance by two\ndifferent methods.\nMethod {i). In a series of n guesses the expectation of hits is hi\n4n\nand the variance is \u2014. These are the binomial formulae and are\nvalid for such a distribution as I have employed, unless it happens\nto be a very improbable one.\nMethod {ii). The expectation and variance can be worked out\nfor each 25 guesses by formulae due to Mr W. L. Stevens and the\nresults summed for all groups of 25 to find the total expectation and\ntotal variance.\nIf rtj, (t^, U3 ,\nr\/\n4 ,\nO 5 are the actual numbers of cards of each symbol\nin a pack of 25, and g^, g^, g^, g^ the numbers of times respectively\n\f169\n162] Fresh Light on Card-Guessing\nthat these symbols are guessed by the subject, then the expectation\n5\nof hits for the 25 guesses is ( Zargr)''25.\nr = l\nTo find the variance we calculate the sums\n5\nEi= L Ur\nr = l\n5\n\u00a32\n= L Uj.g^{a^-\\- gj'),\nr = l\nand the variance can be shown to be\n\u2014i\u2014 [625Ei-25E2+Ef^].\n24 X 625\nThis method, though exceedingly laborious when it had to be\napphed as in our case to 2003 sets of 25 and the results suriimed,\nis somewhat safer than Method (i) since it allows for the possibility\nof improbable distributions existing within the individual sets of 25.\nMethod [Hi). The expectation of hits may be calculated by the\nformula\n1 h A,G\u201e\nA r = l\nwhere N is the total number of guesses, A^, Aj, . . . A5 ,\nthe total\nnumbers of times each of the five card symbols occur, and G^, G2 . \u2022 .\nG5 ,\nthe total numbers of times these same symbols were guessed by\nthe percipients.\nAnalysis of Data\n(i) Pure Clairvoyance.\nIn all, 108 persons took part in the Pure Clairvoyance tests, and\nof these a few worked with more than one technique. I have paid\nspecial attention to the .50,075 guesses recorded by the (P.C.A.) and\n(P.C.B.) techniques because of a certain mass tendency which this\nbatch shows to register scores shghtly below chance expectation,\nand this is one of the effects Dr Rhine claims to have noted in his\nwork in cases where physical or psychological conditions were un-\nfavourable. It seemed therefore worth while to compare the\nestimates obtained from several statistical methods. On the\nwhole 70,900 guesses recorded under all the techniques there is no\nsignificant tendency to score above or below chance. The results\nare given in Table 1.\n\f170 S. G.

I have called a Major set, and a set of\nless than 450 guesses a minor set.\nIn the (P.C.A.) work there are 30 major sets, and of these three\nwere sets of 550 guesses each, the remainder being sets of 500. In\n\f173\n162] Fresh Light on Card-Guessing\naddition there are in (P.C.A.) 17 minor sets ranging from 50 to 400\nguesses each. In the (P.C.B.) work there are 52 major sets, all these\nbeing sets of 500 guesses except for 4 sets of 450 and one of 600.\nThere are also 29 minor sets ranging from 50 to 400 guesses.\nFor the whole 128 sets (P.C.A.) and (P.C.B.) we have S(f)\n= 144-385 which with w = 128 gives P=^^0-33 which is not abnormal.\nFor the 81 (P.C.B.) sets S(;^2)^io6-928 which with 7^ = 81 gives\np\u2014-055, which again is not significant.\n...\nMr Carington also made an analysis of the distribution of the\n128 values of f according to Dr Fisher\u2019s method of 25% groups\nbut the results were not abnormal. (All individuals were scored\nby Stevens\u2019 method.)\nExceptional Individual Scores.\nThe highest \u201c positive \u201d score was made by a young man at\nU C London, who, in a set of 500 (P.C.B.) guesses, obtained 128\ncorrect hits\u2014equivalent to +3-13 times S.D. by Stevens\u2019 method\nBut when the same subject was tested with another (P.C.B.) set of\n500 he scored only 102 successes, and I could not get into touch\nwith him for further work.\nThe next highest score was a (P.C.B.) set of 500 with 125 correct\nhits, but in this case I was unable to arrange another test.\nThe lowest score was a (P.C.A.) set of 500 with only 77 correct\nhits, this being equivalent to -2-67 x S.D. ;\nbut when the subject\ndid another 500 guesses under similar conditions she obtained the\nnormal score of 103 correct hits.\nThe Displacement Test.\nIn order to test further the random nature of the card distribution\nthe 50,075 actual card symbols and the 50,075 guesses were written\nin two concentric endless rings and then the guesses were all shifted\ntwo places forward so that each guess was now opposite a card\n2 places ahead of the card for which it was originally intended.\nThus the experiment became a (-2) experiment. The \u201chits\u201d\nwere counted, and it was now found that the negative deviation had\ndisappeared there being on the 50,075 guesses a small positive\ndeviation of only + 16 compared with an S.D. of 89-51 by Method (i).\nSimilarly we find that the 128 Major and Minor sets mentioned above\nyield after the ( - 2) displacement exactly 59 sets with a positive\ndeviation, 59 with negative deviations and 10 with zero deviation,\na result in accordance with chance. This is an argument in favour\nof the genuine nature of the negative effect.\n\f174 S. G.

However, on a second thousand his score\nrose to 193, a result which though still negative, has no significance.\nI have also made a Binomial Analysis by sets of 25, but the results\nagree closely with expectation and the work is not worth setting out\nin detail.\n(iii) Singletons and Success Groups.\nIn both (P.C.A.) and (P.C.B.) and for (U.T.) we have counted the\nnumbers of singletons (i.e. isolated successes), doubles {i.e. runs\nof 2 successes), \u201c triples \u201d, etc., in order to see if there was any\nevidence for short bursts of intermittent extra-sensory cognition.\nThe expected numbers of \u201c singletons \u201d, \u201c doubles ,\netc., have been\ncomputed from a jniori expectation and the singletons have also\nbeen computed on the basis of the actual number of successful hits\nby a formula due to Mr W.

The results were negative in both cases.\nConclusion to Part I.\nIn the case of one group of persons, a significant tendency to score\nshghtly below chance expectation has been noted in the Pure\nClairvoyance work which is absent in the telepathic experiments,\nbut the degree of significance (odds of about 50 to 1 )\nis not such as\nto inspire us with much confidence in the reahty of this effect. If,\nindeed, this meagre result was all we had to show for the labour of\nfive years we should have felt justified in regarding the outcome of\nthe whole investigation as purely negative. Fortunately this is not\nthe case.\n\f178 S. G. Soal [part\nPART II\nI wo Cases of Apparent Extra-Sensory Cognition\nIn May 1936 I was introduced by Mr Harry Price to a Mr D. A. S.,\na young consulting engineer who visited 13d Roland Gardens. He\nacted as subject for 1000 (U.T.) experiments with either Mrs John-\nstone or her daughter acting as agent. Mr S., who met Mrs and\nMiss Johnstone for the first time at 13d Roland Gardens, scored\nonly chance results, but told us that his wife believed herself to be\nthe possessor of psychic gifts. She was unfortunately occupied in\nthe afternoons and unable to visit Roland Gardens. Mr S., however,\nsuggested that Mrs and Miss Johnstone and I should visit his home\nin an outer suburb and try some experiments there in the evening.\nThis we did on .5th June 1936 at about 8.30 p.m. I had brought\nwith me the packs of cards, scoring sheets and rubber stamps. We\nfirst rigged up a very efficient screen by suspending a thick doubled\nblanket from a line stretched across the room, so that the free ends\nof tlie blanket rested over the centre of a small talJe. Mr S. fixed\na vertical drawing board beneath the table to prevent any contact\nof feet. I next arranged that Mr S. should sit in a line at right-angles\nto the screen through its centre, and about 12 feet away on the side\nopposite to the agents and the cards. Miss Johnstone and I sat at\nthe table on one side of the screen with Mrs S. on the other side.\nMrs Johnstone sat close behind her daughter. Having made these\ndispositions, we carefully examined the room for the possibility of\n^\nreflections but found that no adjustments were necessary. The\ncartls to be guessed were held by me one by one parallel to the screen i\nand with their backs an inch or so away but without touching \u2019\nThe procedure then followed strictly that described under (U.T.) I\n(p. 163) with Miss Johnstone acting as agent and witness. As we *\nwere late in starting, only four sets of 25 were guessed, the scores for\nthese being 7, 8, 7, 8 and the average time for guessing 2.5 cards\nbeing about 4 minutes. No sjieaking was allowed while the guessing\nwas in progress.\n\u00b0\nThe result w\u2019as encouraging, and we arranged to meet again in\nthe same room at 8 p.m. on 17 June. The same persons were\npresent anrl precisely similar arrangements were made with regard\nto seating, etc. The same screen also was used. This time Miss\nJohnstone was again the agent, except for one set of 25, during which\nher mother took her place at the request of Mrs S.\n\f162]\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing 179\nOn this occasion six sets of 25 were guessed, giving the scores\n7, 5, 9, 5, 6, 3, \u2014a result which was not so promising.\nAt our next sitting on 24 June, Mr S. was absent, there being in\nthe room only Mrs and Miss Johnstone, Mrs S. and myself. The\nscores were 5, 6, 2, 8, 4, 5\u2014a chance result. Miss Johnstone was\nagent for the first three sets and Mrs .Johnstone for the last three.\nMiss J. now sitting exactly where her mother had sat.\nOn 1st July Mr S. was again present, and during the experiments\nsat working at the far side of the room in a line at right angles to the\nscreen and on the opposite side to the cards. The scores were\n3, 3, 7, 9, 8, 7, 3, 9.\nOn 8th July Miss Johnstone and Mr S. were both absent, there\nbeing present only Mrs S., Mrs Johnstone and myself, Mrs J. acting\nas agent. The scores were 8, 9, 2, 8, 4, 3, 8, 4.\nOn 22 July Mrs J., Miss J., Mr S., Mrs S., and I were present.\ni\\Ir S. sat in the same position relative to the screen as on 8 July,\nand Mrs J. sat close behind her daughter when the latter was acting\nas agent. Miss J. acted as agent for the first 6 sets of 25 and Mrs -T.\nfor the last 2 sets. The scores were 5, 6, 4, 8, 8, 5, 7, 5.\nThis concluded the first 1000 guesses with Mrs S. as subject\nfor (U.T.).\nNone of the scores are sensational, but on the 1000 guesses she\nwins 238 successes which is just above 3-OxS.D. As an isolated\nresult the odds against this set being due to chance are about\n370 to 1, but at that stage some 18 other persons had already\ncompleted sets of 1000 guesses in (U.T.) and in addition about\n25,000 guesses at (P.C.) had also been recorded. When considered\nagainst this background, therefore, Mrs S.\u2019 result has little or no\nsignificance. M e are not, however, on that account justified in\nascribing it to chance, and subsequent developments suggest that\nthe chance explanation is a very improbable one.\nMrs S. now began her second thousand (U.T.) guesses under\nsimilar conditions, but unfortunately the work was interrupted by\nthe summer vacation and was not resumed till November. It\nsoon became clear that chance scores only were being produced,\nand I felt I could not afford the time wasted on the journeys to\nRichmond. From now onwards only occasional sittings were held\nand the second thousand was not completed till .Tune 4, 1937. The\nsame agents. Miss and IMrs Johnstone, were employed throughout\nuntil the final 100 guesses which were witnessed by Miss Rita Elhott.\nOn her second thousand Mrs S. scored only 209 successes, a purely\nchance result. Now and then hope flickered for an instant during\nthis series, as for instance when on 28 May, 1937, the subject began\n\f180 S. G. Soal [part\na set of 25 with a run of 6 correct guesses, Mrs J. acting as\nagent.\nIn the summer of 1938 Mrs S. did 925 (U.T.M.) experiments, using\nthe pointer and the same screen with the ^ inch gap which I had\nused at University College. She scored 191 hits, which is only 6\nabove chance expectation. After this I felt it useless to continue\nwith the experiments.\nNow as Mrs S. was the oidy (U.T.) subject who had shown any\npromise at all, I decided to re-exainme her 2000 (U.T.) guesses when\nMr Carington asked me to look for \u201c displacement \u201d effects.\nI began by counting hits obtained by comparing each guess (i)\nwith the card immediately preceding the actual card for which the\nguess V as intended, and (n) with the card immediately following the\nactual card for which the guess was intended. This will be clear\nfrom the examples given below.\n(i) Actual Card\n-f\nw \\\nGuess\n0\n4-\n(ii) Actual Card\n0\ns\nu\nGuess\ns -\nw\nExample (i) shows a po.st.-cognitive effect, for the successful hit is,\nas it were, delayed by one place, while example (ii) shows a pre-\ncognitive effect, for the percipient scores a successful hit one place\nbefore the card is actually lifted from the pack for the agent to look\nat. Perhaps a better word than \u201c precognitive \u201d woidd be \u201c antici-\npatory \u201d because \u201c precognitive \u201d is usually associated with the idea\nof seeing a future event which apparently is non-existent at the\nmoment when it is cognised. But the 25 card images already exist\nobjectively as a definite sequence in present time, and, for all we\n^now, the guesser may gain his knowledge of the card one or more\np aces ahead liy exercising a faculty of clairvoyance in the present,\nt, however, it should ultimately be jiroved that the giiesser\u2019s\nsource of information is the ininfl of tlie person who looks at the\ncards, then the guesser is precognising a future mental state of this\nperson which does not exist at the moment of guessing. It is\ntherefore an ojien question whether or not time enters into these\nanticipatory effects ;\nthe present data do not permit us to settle\nme question one way or the other. However, we can agree to call\nExample (n) a i)re-cognitive guess if we abstract from the term\nprecognitive its purely temporal implications.\n\f162 ]\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing 181\nIt is obvious that in a set of 25 guesses the maximum of possible\n( + 1) and (-1) hits corresponding to Examples (i) and (ii) will be\n24 of each, since the first guess cannot give rise to a \u201c postcognitive\n\u201d\nhit nor the last guess to a \u201c precognitive \u201d hit as the 25 guesses\nconstitute a closed experiment.\nBefore I had finished scoring the first thousand guesses of Mrs S.\u2019s\nfor ( + 1 )\nand ( - 1 )\neffects I saw that I had made a remarkable\ndiscovery. I found there were 221 postcognitive successes as\ncompared with an expectation of 192, and 225 pre-cognitive successes\nas against the same expectation of 192. These correspond to\npositive deviations equivalent to 2-34 and 2-72 times the standard\ndeviation. But I asked myself ;\n\u201c Would these postcognitive and\nprecognitive effects disappear in the second thousand guesses just\nas the success on the \u2018actual\u2019 card had petered out?\u201d To my\namazement the ( - 1\n)\naird ( + 1\n)\neffects on the second thousand\ncontinued unabated ! There were in fact 232 precognitive successes\nand 221 postcognitive successes. These correspond to positive\ndeviations which are equivalent respectively to 3-23 and 2-34 times\nthe standard deviation.\nSo that on the whole 2000 guesses we have the following results :\nTABLE 9\nHits DEV. S.D. X\nOn Actual Card 447 + 47 17-89 + 2-627\nPostcognitive (\n+ 1 )\n- 442 + 58 17-53 + 3-309\nPrecognitive (\n- 1\n)\n457 + 73 17-53 + 4-164\nThus on the three \u201ccentral\u201d counts (-1), (0), ( + 1) taken\ntogether we have 1,346 hits with a positive deviation from expecta-\ntion of -t-178 which is equivalent to -t 5-822 times the standard\ndeviation.\nThe chance of getting such a deviation on an isolated set of\n2,000 guesses is less than 10^\u00ae. But if we divide the whole of our\n128,350 guesses into batches of 2000 we should have about 64 such\nbatches. Very approximately, therefore, the chance of finding one\nor more batches with a deviation as high as 178 is about 64 x 10~\u00ae,\ni.e. the odds are of the order of a million to one against the result\nbeing due to pure chance. Even if we multiply 10~\u00ae by 160,\nthe total number of percipients, the result is still highly signifi-\ncant.\n\f182 S. G.

S., a well-known London photo-\ngrapher, called at 1 3d Roland Gardens and asked if he might try\nsome telepathic experiments with cards. He had read an article\nin the Sunday press dealing with my investigation, but hastened to\nadd that the prizes mentioned for high scoring were of no interest\nto him. He had come, he said, \u201c not to be tested \u201d, but \u201c to demon-\nstrate to us the reality of telepathy \u201d. He told us that often of\nan evening he had amazed his friends by \u201c guessing through a pack\nof playing cards from top to bottom \u201d and getting \u201c most of them\nright \u201d. That afternoon there happened to be present in the\nroom Mr J. Aldred, whom I have known since the year 1922, and\nMrs Crane who took part in the 1928-29 long distance tests. Mr\nAldred had kindly come at my request to assist me as a witness\nfor Mrs Crane who had come by appointment, but who kindly con-\nsented to wait till Mr B. S. had finished, since he had to leave early.\nI am reasonably certain that neither Mrs Crane nor IMr Aldred\n\f184 S. G. Soal [part\n(wlio is a friend of mine) had ever met Mr B. S. before, and he\na])])eared to be a stranger to everybody at Roland Gardens. We\nwere not actually expecting him this afternoon though he had\ntelc])honed to say he would call one day that week. His manner\nwas extremely assured and confident, and we were didy impressed.\nAfter I had explained the technicpie to him we began with (U.T.)\nex])eriments, using the 3' by 3' plywood screen which was ordinarily\nin ]iosition above the table. I placed Mrs Crane on the same side\nof tlie screen as Mr B. S. and directly behind him so that she could\nwatch him. Mr Aldred acted as agent, with myself as experimenter.\nM e sat m the usual ])ositions described under (U.T.). I was especi-\nally on my mettle as I stood to lose a large sum of money should\nMr B. S. score a 15. 1 therefore earnestly exhorted Mr Aldred to\nkeep his lips firmly closed during the perioils of guessing. In other\nrespects the method did not deviate in any way from that described\nunder the general technique for (U.T.). The ]iercipient began by\nscoring a 10 and then a 7. We all thought this an excellent start,\nbut Mr B. S. said the scores were \u201c very ]ioor \u201d and asked if \u201c this\nlady meaning Mrs Crane, could take Mr Aldred\u2019s place as agent.\nM'hereu])on Mv Aldred rose ai\\d sat beside Mr B. S. on the other\nside of the screen while Mrs Crane took his jilace. Mr B. S. now\nscored 7, G, G, 3. After the last set he saitl it was useless for him\nto continue. He was best at this kind of thing in the evening\nespecially after he luul had a drink or two. He ])romised, however,\nto visit us again in a fortnight\u2019s time when he was less busy. Actu-\nally we did not see him again until the afternoon of March 27, 193G,\nwhen the only jierson available as a witness and agent was Mrs\nDwyer who had ]u-eviously assisted me in the same capacity on\nseveral occasions, and who had taken ])art in the 1928-29 experi-\nments. \\ isual imagery was emjdoyed by Mrs Dwyer, and the\nscores were 1, G, G, 7, 3, 4, 4, 3, which is just slightly below chance\nexpectation. No one entereil the room during the series, there\nbeing ])resent only Mr B. S., Mrs Dwyer and myself.\nOn April 3, 193(i, Mr B. S. came again to 13d Roland Gardens\nand did 2()() guesses with Mr H. Heckle acting as agent and witness.\nNo one was in the room except the agent, the experimenter and\nMr B. (S. the scores were 8, G, 5, G, 4, 5, G, 8, a result which is a\nlittle above chance expectation but not significantly so.\nMr B. 8. now said tliat he would like to try the experiments in the\nL'vening at his own studio in the West Eiul. After some telephonin.\nI ultimately arranged for 7 p.m. on June 25, 193G. I asked him if\ni\\lr Aldred might act as agent and he agreed as I said I could not\nbe sure of getting anyone else. J\\lr Aldred and I went together to\n\f102]\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing 185\nthe studio, and after chatting for a few minutes Mr B. 8. said tliat\nbefore starting he must luive a drink. We all three adjourned to\na public house nearby where Mr Aldred and I had one lager eacli\nand Mr B. S. consumed a libation of brandy and soda. We then\nreturned to the studio and rigged u]) a (|uite efiicient screen,\nmeasuring about 3' x 3', from several very large sheets of stiff card-\nboard pinned together with drawing pins. I had lirought in my\ncase one of the two boxes of cards and the rubber stamps and\nscoring sheets. A large sheet of stiff cardboard was also fastened\nin a vertical position beneath the table. The scores were agcain\ndisappointing, being 6, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 6, 6, 5, 4. Mr B. S. attributed\nhis failure this time to the noise ol traffic which was certainly\ndisturbing. He invited me to dine with him \u201c some time in the\nautumn \u201d and try some more tests in his ])iivate flat, but the ])lan\ndid not materialise.\nIn all Mr B. 8. did 800 guesses with 105 correct hits, which is\najiparently a chance result.\nAfter having worked out the dis])lacement effects of Mrs 8.\u2019s\n2000 guesses, I examined for (\n-1-\n1) and (\n- 1) effects a good many of\nmy (U.T.) records but did not go beyond ( \u00b1 1 )\u2022 My natural interest\nin Mr B. 8.\u2019s personality led me to look into his record, and once\nagain 1 made an astonishing discovery. Not only did 1 find v(>ry\npronounced ( + 1) and (\n- 1) effects but the negative deviation on the\n(-(-2) scores, which I had noted in the case of the other percipient\nMrs 8., were also very marked. 1 scored Mr B. 8.\u2019 32 sets of 25 as\nfar as ( \u00b18) displacements, and the results are set out in Table\n11 .\nOn the three central values (\u20141), (!\u2022)) ( + ^) seen that\nwe have 554 hits as com])ared with an expectation of !b7-2. ffffiis\ndenotes a positive excess of successful hits equivalent to 4'4!J x 8.D.\nwith P<1()\u201c\u2018' for an isolated set of 800 guesses. But the whoh\u2018\nmaterial could be divided into about IfiO consecutive blocks of\n800 guesses, and very approximately the chance of finding one or\nmore blocks with the above excess of hits is of the order 1 in 000.\nM\n\f186 S.

Mrs S., on the other hand, kept intermittently to\nthe mark for a thousand guesses and then lost it almost com-\npletely.\nIt is instructive to see how the performance of Mr B. S. varied\nwith the agent, although of course no satisfactory conclusions can\nbe drawn as to whether any particular person favoured successful\nguessing.\nThe results appear in Table 12. It would appear that the only\noccasion on which Mr B.

We have evidently found two persons who score\n\u00b11 successes much more easily than they score successes on the\nactual card that is being looked at by the agent. If tliey score\nsignificantly on the actual card it is only for a short time and then\ntheir aim becomes biassed so as to hit the card before or the card\nafter. Presently, as is the case with both percipients, they fail to\nscore significantly on the actual card itself but continue to score\n\u00b1\\ hits. I do not think it likely that I have any more (U.T.)\nrecords which show the \u00b11 span of cognition since I have (at least\nsummarily) gone through all my (U.T.) records with a view to finding\n\u00b1 1 cases. But it is conceivable that there may be persons with a\n( \u00b12) span of cognition.\nNow it seems plausible to assume that in the cases of Mrs S. and\nMr B. S. two images are present in the subconscious, the + 1 image\nand the - 1 image, both struggling to emerge into consciousness.\nJudging from the results, these appear to be of about equal dynamic\n\f188 S. G. Goal [part\nenergy, and when these two images are of different symbols one\nmight assume it was about e(|iially likely whether one or the other\nsucceeded in pushing its way above the conscious threshold. But\nif the \u00b11 images ivere of the same symbol, it might be reasonable to\nassume that one image, reinforced the other, and that the percipient\nwas more likely to score a correct hit in such a case.\nI shall call a guess \u201c multiply determined \u201d if it belongs to one of\nthe four following types :\nTijjje 1 Type II\nActual Card Sequence\n+\nActual Card Sequence\n+\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0\n8\nType III Type IV\nArtnal (Jard Seqiieure\n+\n0\n-t-\nArinal fUnxl Sequence\n+\n+ <\n+\nIn each exanpile the arrow points to the actual card for which the\npresent guess is intended.\nThus 111 Type I we might suppose that the actual card image is\npossibly reinforced by the ( - 1) image, and in Type II by the ( + 1)\nimage, while in lype III it might be that the. (\nil) images reinforce\neach other. Possibly in Type IV all three images might assist the\nguesser in getting the actual card correct.\nAny guess which does not lielong to one of the four types illustrated\nby the above examples we sliall call \u201c non-multiply-deterniined\n\u201d\n(N.M.D.).\nNow it is easy to see that multiple-determination of Types I, II\nand IV does not apparently assist the guesser in getting the\nactual card correct.\nFor instance, in the case of the first thousand guesses of Mrs 8.,\nwe have\n\u2019\nNo. of guesses M.D. of Types 1, II, IV =341.\n,, successes on Actual Card == 78.\n\f162] Fresh Light on Card-Guessing\nExpected No. of successes on Actual Card\n341\n189\n1000\n341 X 238\n1000\nX Total No. of Successes\n= 81-1.\nThe difference is so small that we need not trouble about examin-\ning the second thousand since it was only on her first thousand\nguesses that the subject scored significantly on the actual\nAgain in the case of Mr B. S., the number of M.D. guesses of\nTypes I and II is 272 and the number of successes on the actual card\nis 64.\nBut the expected number of successes on the actual card on these\n272 M.D. guesses is x 272 = 56T.\nHere although there is a slight excess of successes on M.D. guesses\nit is not significant.\nMultiple-determination of Type III is far more interesting.\nFor the 2,000 guesses of Mrs S. (equivalent to 3,840 ( \u00b11) guesses\ncombined) I have made out the following contingency table .\nTABLE 13\nMrs S.\nShowing Effect of M.D. 3 on \u00b11 Guesses\nS = No. of Correct Hits, (either \u00b11).\nF = \u201e Incorrect Hits, (whether \u00b11).\nM.D.3 = .,,\nMultiply-Determined Guesses, Type HI.\nN.MD.3 = \u201e Guesses not Multiply-Determined of Type III.\nS F Totals\nM.D.3 164 340 .504\nN.M.D.3 - 735 2,601 3,336\nTotals 899 2,941 3,840\nm2\n\f190 S. G. Soal [part\nFor this table we find = so that the odds against the\nexcess of ( \u00b11) hits on M.D.3 guesses being due to chance are many\nmillions to 1. It is clearly not worth while applying Yates\u2019s correc-\ntion in such a case.\nIn the case of Mr B. S., the effect of M.D.3 on ( \u00b1 1 )\nsuccesses is\neven more striking. The results are set out in the following con-\ntingency table ;\nTABLE 14\nMr B.

On the other hand, the -|- 1 and \u2014 1 images, being\nboth outside the conscious field of the agent, are capable of acting\nin conjunction.\nThe Nef\/afive Deviation on ( + 2) Guesses.\nIn the case of both sulijects we have noted very significant\nneuahve deviations on the ( + 2) guesses. It is difiicult to suppose\nthat these deviations\u2014which amount to 3-089 xS.D. in the case\nol Mrs S. and 2-97 x S.I). in the case of Mr B. S. \u2014are the work of\nchance. At first sight it seemed possible that the tendency to get\nthe (-1-2) guess wrong might be a mere logical consequence of\ngetting a large excess of ( -r 1\n)\nguesses right. For it is a fact that the\nmajority of guessers show a tendency to change from one symbol to\nanother more frerpiently than happens in a purely random sequence\n\f162] Fresh Light on Card-Guessing 191\nof card-symbols. In other words, most people\u2019s records show a\nlesser number of \u201c repeats \u201d than occur in a random series. If\ntherefore the guesser gets a ( + 1 )\nguess right and changes his guess\nfor the following card he automatically gets his ( -I- 2) guess wrong.\nBut if this is the whole explanation of the matter we ought to find\nthat those sets of 25 which contain a large number of ( -}-\n1) successes\ncontain a small number of (4-2) successes. In other w^ords, the\n( + 1) and ( -I- 2) scores ought to show a significant negative correla-\ntion. But this does not appear to be the case. In fact, for the\nfirst 1,000 guesses of Mrs S. (40 sets of 25) there is a small positive\ncorrelation of 0-113 which is not significant, and in the case of\ni\\Ir B. S., with 800 guesses (32 sets of 25) there is a small negative\ncorrelation of - 0-287 between the ( -I- 1) and the (\n-1-\n2) scores which\nis again without significance.\nThe next question to be decided was : Does the guesser tend to\nchange his guess more frequently immediately following a (-1-1)\nsuccess than in the case immediately following a (\n-\n1\n-\n1 )\nfailure ?\nTo attempt to answer this I made out the following contingency\ntables for Mrs S. and Mr B. S. respectively.\nTABLE 15\nMrs S.\n1840 (4-2) Guesses\nNo. of( + l)\nGuesses correct\nNo. o\/( + l)\nGuesses Incorrect\nTotals\nCases with next guess\nchanged -\n372 1,175 1,547\nCases with no change in\nnext guess 54 239 293\nTotals 426 1,414 1,840\nAfter making Yates\u2019s correction we find ;<^ = 4-058 giving ;^\n=2-01.\nThus there is a slight but not marked tendency for the subject to\nchange his guess after getting a (4- 1) success more frequently than\nafter a (4-1) failure.\nBut in the case of Mr B. S. there is apparently no such tendency,\nthe changes of guess being proportionately distributed on (4-1)\ncorrect and ( -r 1) incorrect guesses.\n\f192 S. G. Soal [part\nTABLE 16\nMr B.

S., there are 115 ( + 2) successes, and an\ninspection of Table IG shows that he obtained 32 ( + 2) hits which\nimmediately follow ( + 1) successes. Hence on the 546 ( ^- 2) guesses\nwhich immediately follow (-fl) failures we might expect, on the\nassumption that successes on these 546 guesses are due to chance\nalone, just 109-2 correct hits, whereas actually there are 115- 32 = 83\ncorrect hits. This is a deficiency equivalent to 2-8xS.D., and is\ncertainly significant.\nEvidently, therefore, with Mr B. S. there is a marked tendency\nto score heloiv chance exjrectation on those (\n+ 2) guesses which\nfollow mcorrect ( + 1) guesses.\nIn fact, since he changes his guess 616 times in 736 guesses, we\nshould, on the assumption that the ( + 2) successes on guesses which\nfollow correct ( + 1) guesses are a mere consequence of the subject\u2019s\nycneral tendency to change his guess, expect that in the 190 cases\nwhich follow ( + 1) successes he would score\n616\n190--\u2014 X 190=31 correct hits.\n736\nHe actually scores 32. It will now be quite clear that, with Mr\nB. S., no psychological explanation is required to account for the\nscores which follow ( + 1) successes ;\nit is the deficiency of correct\nhits which follow ( + 1 )\nfailures that requires elucidation. I would\nsuggest the following hypothesis. When the subject scores a ( + 1)\nsuccess with a certain card image, this image having fomid expression\nin consciousness ceases to worry the subject any longer, and his next\n\f162 ]\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing 193\nguess is not influenced by it. In cases when the subject has called\na ivro7ig ( + 1 )\nguess, the correct card image corresponding to this\nguess is, however, present in his subconscious mind and continues\nto worry him because it ha?s not succeeded in emerging correctly\nabove the threshold. In order to exorcise this disturbing image\nat the iiext guess, the subject pointedly ignores it by choosing one\nof the other four symbols. It was Dr Thouless who first suggested\nto me the idea of mental \u201c exorcism \u201d by thinking of something\ndifferent, and in ordinary life we are constantly making use of this\nsubconscious mechanism in order to rid ourselves of painful experi-\nences.\nOur hypothesis is, therefore, that subconsciously the guesser knows\nthat he has the correct ( + 1) image in his mind, but knows also that\nhe failed to get it over the threshold. Probably, therefore, at his\nnext guess, he knows that this image is now \u201c out of the running\n\u201d\nand to get rid of it he chooses anything but this particular symbol.\nHence the tendency to get the (4-2) guess ivrong.\nBut the theory does not perhaps apply quite so well to the case\nof Mrs S. In her case we should\u2014on the assumption that the\ndeficiency of (4-2) liits following on (-bl) successes is a logical\nconsequence of a ge?ieral tendency for the subject to change her\nguess\u2014expect to find on the 426 cases following (-41) successes\nwhereas there are actually 54.\nThis is a deficiency of 13-8 with S.D. = 7-55, so that there is still\nno reason to assume that (4-2) failures following (4-1) successes\nare due to anything beyond the general tendency of the subject\nto change her guess.\nAgain on the 1,414 (4-2) guesses of IVIrs S. which immediately\nfollow (4-1) failures we should, on the assumption of chance, expect\nto find 282-8 correct hits whereas there are actually 315-54 = 261.\nThis is a deficit of 21-8 with S.D. = 15-04, but this deficit is only\nequivalent to 1-45 xS.D. compared with the corresponding deficit\nof 2-8 X S.D. in the case of Mr B. S.\nIn fact, in the case of Mrs S., the total expectation\u2014allowing for\ndeficit due to general tendency to change guess\u2014is 282-84-67-8\n= 350-6 correct (4-2) hits on the 1,840 (4-2) guesses, and the actual\ntotal of correct hits is 315 showing a deficit of 35-6 which is only just\nover 2 x S.D. In the case of Mrs S., therefore, the psychological\nhypothesis is not so necessary to account for the deficit as it is in the\n- =67-8 correct hits.\ncase of Mr B. S.\n\f194 S. G. Soal [part\nI need hardly point out that in a random \u201d series of n ^nesses\nthe expected number of \u201cchanges of guess\u201d is obviously fxn,\nand hence that if the subject\u2019s tendency to change guess did not\nexceed f-w, his ( + 2) scores would not be affected nornially by ( + 1)\nsuccesses.\nCan the results he ex-plained normally?\n1\n.\nIt does not seem reasonable to try to explain the i 1 successes\non the hypothesis of involuntary whispering, or sensory cues derived\nthrough noting changes of breathing, etc. In the case of Mrs S.,\nfor instance, the (\n- 1) or effect of precognition is much the strongest\nof the three effects (0), (\n\u2014 1), ( + 1). But, on the assumption of\nnormal leakage, this is precisely the effect that ought to be the\nweakest! It is possible (though improbable) that the agent might\nwhisper the name of the card he was looking at, and it is conceivable\nthat this whisper might influence the trend of Mrs S.\u2019 thought\nwithout her lieing conscious of the stimulus. It is even con-\nceivable that the stimulus might require some time for it to emerge\nin her consciousness and so produce a pos<-cognitive effect (-1-1).\nBut how is the (-1) effect to be explained on this hypothesis?\nWe should have to suppose that, through long experience with the\n40 packs of cards, the agent Mrs J. or Miss J. had learned to recognise\ncertain of the cards by noting small specks on their backs, and so\nhad become aware of the denomination of the card which was resting\nface downwards on top of the pack ready to be lifted off for the\nnext guess. We might suppose that the image was then transferred\nby involuntary whisj^ering. But even if this far-fetched hypothesis\nhad any truth in it, the giiesser would surely win the Inilk of his\nsuccesses on the card whose face the agent was gazing at, and not\non the card ivhose hack only was visible to him.\n2. Iiecisely similar objections apply to the hypothesis of an\nauditory or other code deliberately arranged between Mrs S. and\none of the agents. How could such a code enable Mrs S. to obtain\n(\u20141) hits equivalent to 4-16 times the standard deviation? More-\nover, how could the very definite effect of Type III multiple deter-\nmination be accounted for on the hypothesis of a code?\n3. Even if we assume (and extensive experiment shows this is -not\nthe case) that the slight differences in the shape of the rubber\nstamps can be discriminated liy slight differences of the sound they\ncause on impact with the paper, this would not enable the guesser\nto get tlie card one j:)lace ahead correct.\n4. If we make tlie quite absurd assumption that there was a small\n10 e in the screen through which Mrs S. was able to peer, it could\n\f162]\n195\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing\nscarcely assist her except to enable her to get the exposed card\ncorrect, and she failed to get this card correct after the first 1000\nguesses. \u2022\n\u2022\ni j-\n5. Let us now consider possible objections of a statistical nature.\nIn the first place it will be as well to observe that we do not claim\nto \u201c prove \u201d telepathy or precognition by means of statistics in the\nsense that one sets out to prove the validity of a theorem in mathe-\ninstics\nThese phenomena will be established in a scientific sense when we\nunderstand enough about them to be able to ensure their occurrence\nwith reasonable frequency by experimental means. All that statis-\ntical methods can do is to tell us how hkely it is that the effects we\nobserve are fortuitous. In some cases the probability that the\nresults are not due to chance may be so great as to amount to moral\ncertitude, but, however careful the exjierimentation may have been,\nand however great the odds against the hypothesis of chance, we\ncannot hope to furnish the absolute proof of a mathematical pro-\nposition, or even the empirical proof of an experiment in physics\nwhich can be repeated at will. All we venture to claim is that\nthe present investigation is a definite contribution to that rapidly\ngrowing mass of experimental evidence which is in favour of the\nreality of the phenomena of extra-sensory cognition. We believe\nthat the odds against chance are sufficiently high and the experi-\nmental precautions sufficiently careful to merit the most serious\nattention.\nNow it might be urged that the present investigation was^ not\noriginally intended as an enquiry into precognitive or post-cognitive\neffects but was, in the first instance, a straightforward attempt to\ndiscover if there was any truth in I)r Rhine s claim that certain\npersons were able to divine correctly the figure on a card which was\nbeing looked at by an experimenter. Hence it might be argued that\nI ought to have confined myself to the task in hand and have left\nprecognitive effects severely alone. Against this I would point out\nthat Dr Rhine himself claimed that precognitive effects could be\ndemonstrated by the use of Zener cards, and Mr &. N. M. Tyrrell\nclaims to have obtained precognitive results by the use of a s])ecial\napparatus which involved the choice by the subject of one of five\noperations. In my study of precognition I was testing a pheno-\nmenon for which there is a good deal of very impressive evidence\nboth of a spontaneous and an experimental kind. I was not merely\nforming an irresponsible conjecture and then seeking statistical\nevidence with which to support it. The a priori evidence for pre-\ncognition has been very ably analysed by Mr H. F. Saltmarsh in a\n\f196 S. O. Soal [part\nlong and important paper [Proceedings, Part 134, pp. 49-103], and\nI have yet to meet with any serious refutation of his conclusions,\nwhich are entirely favourable to the reality of precognition as a\nspontaneous mental phenomenon. I find invariably that the persons\nwho maintain that there is no serious evidence for telepathy or pre-\ncognition are those who have not taken the trouble to study the\nProceedings of the Society. Until they have made this study they\nare not competent to air their negative ojrinions. I need hardly\nmention that posi-cognitive effects of a spontaneous kind permeate\nthe whole of the records of psychical research, or that Frederic Myers\nmade a special study of them.\nNow it is worth noting that my own technique\u2014on the statistical\nside at least\u2014is as well adapted for testing (\nil) effects as for\ntesting successes on the actual card itself, and the investigation of\nsuch effects might well have formed a part of my original programme.\nIn fact, as far back as 1935, I scored about 20,000 of the Pure Clair-\nvoyance (P.C.B.) guesses for po6f-cognitive (-tl) successes, on the\nsuggestion of Professor Thouless, without, however, discovering any\nevidence of a deferred effect.\nIt cannot be argued that I applied statistical tests to a large\nnumber of features of my data and then chose the one feature,\ni.e. (\u00b11) effects, which happened to give high odds against the\nhypothesis of chance. Nothing, indeed, would be further from the\ntruth. It was at Mr Carington\u2019s suggestion that I examined my\nrecords for displacement effects, and in selecting the records of Mrs S.\nand of Mr B. S. I was guided entirely by my belief that these two\nsubjects were psychical sensitives. The first of all the records to\nbe examined was that of Mrs S., and the successes in the three\ncentral positions yielded odds against chance of the order of a\nmillion to one even when estimated against the background of\n128,350 guesses.\nSome critic may question my right to select the three central\nvalues for separate statistical evaluation. My answer is : (a) Any\nsane person testing the results for precognitive and postcognitive\neffects would be naturally interested in testing the actual card, the\nimmediately preceding card and the one immediately following, and\n{h) that with such material as the Zener cards, where the same five\nsymbols occur over and over again, it is very difficult to imagine\nhow large displacement effects could be detected, even if they\noccurred, since successes spread out over a number of displace-\nments would be very diluted. It was entirely to be expected that\nif any displacement effect existed this would be most easily detected\nin positions close to the actual card.\n\f162]\n197\nFresh Light on Card-Guessing\nBut we have seen that in the case of both percipients if the\nseventeen values of {f) are summed corresponding to the displace-\nments up to ( \u00b18),\nthe values of S(z^) obtained are so large that the>\nlie right outside Fisher's tables. This in itself should be a siilhcient\nanswer to those who would question the propriety of choosing the\nthree central values for special evaluation.\nOne could, of course, apply statistical tests to attempt to discover\nall kinds of bizarre relations among different features of the data,\nbut if the effects sought for were sijsteniatic effects extending over\n\u20222000 guesses (as with Mrs S.), it would be a remarkable miracle\nindeed if the odds against chance turned out to be of the order of a\nmillion to one. And it would be an asto^onding coinbination of\nmiracles if each of the cases which exhibited the hrst effect showed\nalso a confirmatory effect with odds again of the order of millions to\none. For this is what actually happened. The records of both\nMrs S. and Mr B. S. showed that if the card to be guessed w-as sand-\nwiched between two cards of the same denomination the (\n+ 1 )\nsuccesses were enhanced to an extraordinary degree. In fact we\nfind that Mr B. S. achieves 46\u00b0 o of ( \u00b11) successes on the\n_\nsand-\nwiched \u201d cards and only 22% on the remainder. Mrs b. wms .36 \/o\non the \u201c sandwiched \u201d cards and 22% on the rest. These differences\nare not small discrepancies ;\nthey point to fundamental psycho-\nlogical factors at work. ii\nMoreover I did not discover this effect by trying out statiMically\na large number of fantastic hypotheses until I succeeded in fine ing\none which gave odds of millions to one against chance. If such had\nbeen my method I might have gone on testing hypotheses till the\nend of my days. I discovered the effect by the perfectly natural and\ncommm-sense argument that if the ( \u00b1 1 )\neffects were genuine they ought\nto reinforce each, other when the card lay between two cards of the seme\nsymbol. In fact I actually suggested the probability of the effect\nto Dr Thoiiless one evening on a visit to his house and before I ac\nmade any counts whatever. i i 4. 1,\nIn conclusion, all the experiments have been witnessed and the\nrecords checked at the time by another inteUigent person in addition\nto the experimenter. They have not been \u201c hole in the corner\naffairs Can the same be said for a great many of the orthodox\ninvestigations of experimental psychology?\nIf the conclusions of Mr Carington and myself put into question\ncertain cherished dogmas of psychology such, for instance as the\ndogma which states pompously that \u201c nothing can enter the mind\nexcept by wav of the five senses \u201d, then we say boldly, bo much\nthe worse for the dogma! \u201d Indeed, the truth is that experimental\n\f198 S. G. Soal [part 162\npsychology is still so far from being an exact science that from its j\nown house of glass it can scarcely afford to throw stones at psychical i\nresearch. Orthodox experimental psychology today consists largely '\n;\nof a number of disconnected and relatively unimportant \u201cre-\nsearches \u201d ;\nit has no comprehensive theory by which to account for\nthe phenomena of mental life. Psychical Research offers it some-\nthing of real importance, and of real interest to humanity.\nAs for those narrow and limited specialists of science, who, devoid\nof philosophic outlook, label such careful investigations as those\nwhich Mr Carington and I have conducted with the generic name of i\n\u201c spooks \u201d, and pass on, we may safely leave them to the contempt I\nof future generations. i\n\fREVIEWS\nI\nInfinite Traveller. By Charlotte Bacon. Williams & Norgate.\n7s. 6d. net.\nThis is a book of considerable interest to those who cannot, or at\nall events do not, read the professional philosophers, but are\nanxious to think clearly about the nature and destiny of human life.\nIts mterest for students of psychical research will be the stronger,\nthe more they consider it a mam object of the research to throw\nlight upon the nature of personality. Three main motives for\npsychical research can be traced : scientific curiosity about events\nthat seem to be outside the known, or \u201c normal \u201d, pattern of cause\nand effect ;\ndesire for evidence bearing on the question of survival :\nand mterest in the extended conception of personality which may be\ninferred from evidence of the paranormal. Mrs Bacon touches upon\nsuch evidence only as having relevance to a much wider discussion\nof the meaning of human life. But this wider discussion rejrresents\nthe framework within which all speculation upon the extension of\nhuman personality has to be conducted ;\nand it is a good thing to\nhave the general evidence so well marshalled as in this book for the\nproposition that man is more, and aims at more, than his science\ncan yet descrilre to him.\nMrs Bacon maintains with considerable force that we are in an\nillogical position if we draw a hard and fast line between the reality\nof things perceived and the reality of qualities and values which are\napprehended by other functions of the mmd than perception in its\nnarrower sense. '\nWe must either take man-the-experiencer m his\nentirety or, determined to pick and choose among his news-collecting\npowers, we must decide to trust the rejiorts of his calculating faculty\nalone.\u201d We need some such phrase as \u201c calculating faculty \u201d, here,\nbecause of the often-forgotten fact that our sense-data are not\ndirectly given from the outer world. As Mrs Bacon puts it, \\\\ e do\nnot know and cannot guess how a brain-impress becomes a thought.\nIn short, we cannot detect any news in the act of becoming news.\u201d\nThe mmd cannot apprehend the \u201c news \u201d brought in by the\nsenses without apprehending qualities ;\nit cannot apprehend quali-\nties (nor, we could add, quantities) without making valuations ;\nand it thus applies a discrimination of values which is an essential\n199\n\f200 Reviews [part\npart of its apprehension of reality. But once we admit values into\nour scheme of reality (such as the truth of an impression received,\nor of a logical statement about it, or of a mathematical process for\ntesting it), where is the sharp dividing line between the mind\u2019s report\nof things and its report of their meaning and significance? Actually,\nthe line is drawn by science so as to include just those kinds of\nvaluation which it can usefully emjjloy for its own purposes. It is a\nproblem for psychical research, as also for jrsychology, whether this\nconvenient line is rightly drawn for us who attempt to estimate\nperceptions not hitherto within the range of formal science.\nj\\Irs Bacon devotes several chapters to the demolition of the\nmateriahstic, or mechanistic, view of life. Such argument inevitably\nchases its own tail, since in a mechanistic world ideas can have no\nvalidity, and any theory is as meaningless as another, uicluding the\nmechanistic theory. But the point emerges with increasing urgency\nthat human experience, the very fact that there is such a thing as\nhuman experience, is left entirely unexplained in any world of which\nthe mechanism alone is taken into account. And since human ex-\nperience is our only source of evidence, the materialistic demon-\nstration has the disadvantage of starting nowhere, as in practice it\nends nowhere.\nIn any case, science has increasingly found that the study of\nmaterial objects resolves itself into a study of energy and of the fields\nof influence by which energy is directed. In proceeding to show the\nhighly potent directive power, and the constructive or destructive\neffect, of human values at their different levels of truth or falsity,\nMrs Bacon is putting values in their proper place as subjects of\nscientific discourse. They are facts which direct the energies of\nhumanity, for good or ill. They have produced manifest results in\nthat structure of human life which is our real and intimate environ-\nment. And in this structure, Mrs Bacon argues that it is absurdly\ninconsistent to leave the properties of \u201c spiritual man \u201d out of\naccount. For one thing, \u201c no experience can be left in the air, un-\naccounted for \u201d :\n\u201c either the mystic-saint\u2019s experience must be\ntheoretically fitted in to biological life\u2019s Real, or oirr ideas of Reality\nmust be theoretically enlarged beyond that scene of physical Reality\nwhich biological life occupies, surveys and knows.\u201d\nFor another thing, \u201c If the potentialities of Man are to be ascer-\ntained the search must be conducted to the extremity of his achieve-\nments. Should a moimtain\u2019s height be the object of inquiry, its\nlesser heights and its average height are ignored, for a mountain is\nexactly as high as its highest ])eak, however narrow and cloud-\ncapped that peak may be.\u201d We are here in a region where the\n\fReviews 201\n162]\nphilosophy, however true and important in itself, may be thought\nto chnib higher than psychical research has any business to follow.\nBut it is of considerable value to us to be given a comprehensive\nview of the whole mountain, if we are to have a right and propor-\ntionate idea of the particular ridges and valleys which it is our\nbusiness to explore. This book presents a comprehensive view o\nhuman faculty, actual and potential, which has a certain kins up\nwith the outlook proclaimed by F. W. H. Myers, though Mrs Bacon s\napproach and treatment are widely different from those employed\nby the author of Human Personality. It is an outlook that keeps\nresearch in touch with a wider, philosophical frame of reference, and\nhas its influence in keeping both the theory and the practice of\nresearch from neglect of the climatic conditions which fundamentally\naffect the quality of all psychic events.\nII\nMijthology of the Soul, A Research into the Unconscious from ScJnzo-\nphrenic Dreams and Drawings : H. G. Baynes. Bailliere\nTindall and Cox, 1940 : pp. xii-l-912 ;\n32s. 6d.\nDr Baynes is well known as a leading member of the Jung school\nof psychology, and many of our members will recall the paper he read\nto the Society in 1936 on \u201c The Ghost as a Psychic Phenomenon .\nIn his first chapter he gives a brief account of the development of\nthe psychological conception of mental disorders, as viewed from the\nstandpoint of Jung, whose theories are probably not as well known\nin this country as those of Freud. Dr Baynes describes hov both\nJung and Freud, working independently, arrived by different\nmethods\u2014psychological experiment, particularly association tests,\nand clinical experience\u2014at a more dynamic conception of the un-\nconscious than had till then obtained. \u201c Jung\u2019s conception of the\nautonomous complex became the syncretising basis which united the\nclassical conceptions of the French school with those of Freud, the\ngreat pioneer of psycho-analysis.\u201d\nFor some time complete harmony prevailed between Zurich and\nVienna. But by 1914, w^hen Jung repubhshed his Content of the\nPsychoses, from which Dr Baynes makes several interesting quota-\ntions, a fundamental divergence between the two systems had been\nrevealed. In contrasting the \u201c reductive analysis \u201d of Freud with\nwhat he claims to be his own constructive methods, Jung says :\n\u201c The patient\u2019s unmistakable striving to express something by\n^Reported in S.P.R. Journal for May 1937.\n\f202 Reviews [part\nmeans of his delusion, Freud conceives retrospectively, as the satis-\ntaction of his infantile wishes by means of fantasy. The constructive\nstandpoint is different. Here the delusional system is neither\nmtantde, nor, upon the whole, eo ipso pathological, but subjective\nand hence it is justified within the scope of the subjective.\u201d\nA significant feature of the Jung school is the emphasis laid on the\ncollective unconscious\u201d, which indeed seems to have been a\njirmcipal cause of the split with Freud. The view is that the psychic\nconstitution of man varies as little owing to differences in social\nenvironment as his body does owing to differences of climate, and\nthat there are \u201c primordial images\u201d which have so established\nthemselves m the psyche as to make it impossible to explain any\nmdividual case solely m terms of the patient's personal history.\nThe primordial image \u201c is the figurative expression in dream or\nlantasy ol the living continuity of instinctual experience. It is\nalso conceived as the source or container of that supra-personal\nafflux of energy, winch, when released, either carries the individual\ntowards his goal, or smashes him pitilessly on the rocks \u201d. Dr\nBaynes makes great use of \u201c primordial images \u201d in analysing his\n])atients fantasies, perhaps on occasion riding them too hard.\nThe chapters winch follow set out in detail the cases of two schizo-\nphrenic patients, m whose treatment Dr Baynes relied largely on\nthe ana ysis of drawings embodying their fantasies, a few of their\nf reams^ being also analysed. There are reproductions of a number of\nthese drawings, both in black and white and colours, which add\ngreatly to the interest of the book.\nJung and his school, as is well known, lay great emphasis on\ndiffeientiation of psychological types, e.g. introvert and extravert\nI rom a jiaper recently read by Jung to the Psychiatric Section of\n. le Ivoyal Society of Medicine, Dr Baynes quotes a passage in which\nschizophrenia is distinguished from hysteria and other neuroses \u2022\nl ie fundamental difference which distinguishes hysteria and\nae other neuroses from schizophrenia consists in the maintenance of\nthe potential unity of the personality in the former group. The\ngeneral ]ucture of an association-test of a schizophrenic may be very\nsimilar to the test of a neurotic, but a close examination reveals the\nfact that m a schizophrenic patient the connection lietween the ego\nand certain complexes is more or less completely lost.\u201d\nIhere are two causative factors of schizophrenia, which seem to be\nniainly uKlependent, the weakening of conscious control, and the\nactivation of the unconscious with its atavistic content. Amoim the\nmajor consequences Jung mentions \u201ca decrease in the resp'ons-\nibihty and adequate reaction of the ego : realisation is interfered\n\fReviews 203\n162]\nwith thereby causing insufficient and inadequate emotional re-\nactions\nBoth these symi^toms figure, in varying degrees, in the two cases\nanalysed by Dr Baynes. To all outward appearance there seemed\nlittle ^vrong with either patient. In each case the trouble started\nwith shock in the patient\u2019s early years : in the first case, the death\nof the patient\u2019s mother followed a few years later by the suicide of\nhis sister, in the second the scandalous conduct of the patient\u2019s\nstepfather. To the question ^\\ere the patients cured? Dr\nBaynes in the concluding section of his book replies \u201c Cured of\nwhat?\u201d \u201cThe schizoid individual is rarely, if ever, a disabled\nneurotic ;\nneither does he suffer, as a general rule, from distressing\nbodily symptoms. He is a man who has been singled out by fate to\naccept solitariness as the fundamental condition of his existence.\u201d\nFor such persons \u201c a merely mechanical drainage of the imconscioiis\nby reductive analysis \u201d is insufficient without the sense of renewal of\nlife which is the essence of religion. Given a sufficiently extended\ndefinition of religion, support could be found for Dr Baynes\u2019s state-\nment that, though the two patients were of very different psycho-\nlogical types, \u201c in both cases the flow of unconscious events led\nstraight to the religious problem.\u201d\nThe psychical researcher is frequently invited to consider \u201c auto-\nmatic \u201d, \u201c psychic \u201d or \u201c inspirational \u201d drawings produced when\nthe control of the conscious mind is in abeyance. He will find it\ninteresting to compare the numerous illustrations to this book with\nexamples 'of \u201c automatic \u201d drawings already familiar to him. No\nclaim is or could be made for the drawings in the book that they\ntranscend the normal powers of draughtsmanship of the patients,\nsince those drawn by the first patient, a doctor, touch the extreme\nlimit of crudity, while the second patient was a draughtsman by\nprofession ;\nhis designs are mostly, notwithstanding the frequently\nsinister character of the symbolism, agreeable to study.\nThe drawings of both series in the book give an appearance of\npurposiveness which is not always present in automatic drawings.\nThey show none of that apparently meaningless repetition of\npatterns, especially squirls and scpiiggles, with which the student of\n\u201c automatic \u201d drawings is all too familiar. I do not know whether\nmedical psychologists have attempted by the study of \u201c automatic\ndrawmgs of automatists unknown to them to reconstruct the\npsychological state, and even the emotional history of the automa-\ntists. The results might be interesting, and would, if successful, give\nwelcome support to the objective validity of their theories.\niMuch of the interest of the book derives from the many pleasant\n\f204 Revieivs [part\nexcursions wliicli Dr Baynes makes into the domains of religion,\nmythology, symbolism in art and literature, primitive culture and I\nworld-politics. The psychological school to which he belongs does\nnot regard rehgion as a tedious epiphenomenon on the juicier side\nof existence. Mythology, literature and art are often discussed by\npsychologists, but one cannot always read their comments, as Dr\nBaynes\u2019s may be read, without having one\u2019s teeth set on edge.\nWith great ingenuity he develops the view that many popular\nstories {e.g. the Book of Tobit, Parsifal, Dracula) whatever their\nauthors\u2019 conscious intentions, do in fact symlmlise the schizophrenic\nstate and its treatment. W' hat are usually considered the pseudo-\nsciences of alchemy and astrology were, in his view, largely con-\ncerned with the unconscious mind, so that when they were sup-\njilanted by orthodox chemistry and astronomy, psychology suffered\na temporary set-back.\nDr Baynes follows Jung in attaching great value to what he calls\nthe \u201c concept of cosmic duality of Chinese culture, in which the\ndark, earthy feminme principle of Yin is opposed by the light,\nspiritual, masculine principle of Yang \u201d. (This conjunction of\nepithets is not the reviewer\u2019s.) The temjiorary predominance of\neither principle stimulates the other, till it in turn predominates,\nand a reverse j)rocess sets in. The two jirinciples are roughly equi-\nvalent to reason and instinct, the latter having, according to Jung,\na significance going beyond sexuality and self-preservation. To the\ndisharmony between these two principles, in individuals and in\nnations. Dr Baynes would assign most of the evils of the modern,\nand particularly the western world.\nParallels to the Yin-Yang concept can, as Dr Baynes indicates,\nreadily be found in Blake, notably m The Marnage of Heaven and\nHell, where he asserts that \" without contraries is no jirogression \u201d,\nand instances what the religious call Good and Evil. Good is the\npassive that obeys Reason ; Evil is the active sjiringing from\nEnergy . Dr Baynes, jnishing a jirophetic antinomianism to a\npoint which might have alarmed Blake, says \u201c A stalile and reliable\nsocial order will be found eventually to rest on two recijirocal prin-\nciples. The first is collective authority and discipline in all matters\nwherein conformity is indisjiensalile, the second individual freedom\nof judgment in all matters which concern the life and health of the\nsoul . It is not clear what he means by \" reciprocal \u201d, but unless\nit is intended that the first princijile slioidd circumscribe the opera-\ntion of the second, the suggestion ajipears to be that, provided we all\nobserve the traffic-light rules, we can each do what is right in his\nown eyes without harm to the community.\n\fReviews 205\n162]\nIt niay seem out of place in a publication devoted to psychical\nresearch to labour a point of social ethics, but this and many other\npassages in Dr Baynes\u2019s book seem based on a view of the uncon-\nscious which has a very close bearing on psychical research. It\nappears to be implied that ethical differences, so far as they are not\nmere matters of traffic-light convention, are due to different degrees\nof harmony and dis-harmony between the conscious and uncon-\nscious minds of individuals. This is akin to the proposition, some-\ntimes asserted by medical psychologists, that any form or degree of\ndissociation is pathological. That may possibly be true, liut it is\nnot a conclusion which would naturally be drawn from a study\nconfined to those types of dissociation which come within the specific\npurview of psychical research.\nThe parallehsm between secondary personahties of the Sally\nBeauchamp type and some mediumistic controls is well recognised,\nand where the secondary personality or control is of a tricky, un-\ntrustworthy type, the view attributed above to medical psychology\nwould, so far as a layman can judge, fit the facts. Nor does this view\nappear to be contradicted by the fact that the primary personality\n{e.g. Miss Beauchamp herself) or the medium {e.g. Stainton Moses)\nis extremely conscientious, though both hliss Beauchamp and Stain-\nton Moses were in some degree misfits, who found it difficult to\ndevelop normal reactions to life. The sort of case which the psychical\nresearcher finds it difficult to fit into the picture is that of the med-\nium, whose reactions to life are perfectly normal and show no sign\nof that apathy or desire to evade responsibility which Dr Baynes\u2019s\ntwo patients illustrate, with a trance personality on the same ethical\nlevel. The dissociation, as judged by such tests as amnesia, may be\nprofound, much profounder than with Dr Baynes s patients, but the\nsplit is not on ethical or emotional lines at all, being apparently confined\nto a difference in mental content and, sometimes, in intellectual power.\nIt strikes the lay ])sychical researcher as curious that medical\npsychologists (Dr T. W. Mitchell is of course a notable exception)\nare so little interested in the psychology of mediums and automatists.\nIt might have been supposed that they would have gladly seized\nthe opportimity of widening their experience by the study of\nmaterial of a kind different from that which comes to them in their\nordinary practice. Students of psychical research, who fully realise\nthe complexity of the prol)lems they encounter, would welcome any\nassistance they could obtain from medical psychologists, especially\nfrom any giving proofs of such an open mind and so wide-spread\ninterests as Dr Baynes has shown.\nW. H. S.\n\f206 Mr Oliver Gatty [part\nOBITUARY\nMr Oliver Gatty\nAt tlio moment of going to jjress we learn with the deepest regret of\nthe death at Cambridge of Mr Oliver Gatty as the result of an\naccident occurring while he was conducting an experiment connected\nwith war work for the Government.\nMr Gatty had a brilliant career at Oxford, where he studied\nphysics and became a Fellow of Balliol. But he soon developed an\ninterest in biology, in which subject he did research work first at the\nRothamsted Experimental Station, and later at Cambridge, where\nhe had been living for several years.\nHis work in Cambridge, on the electrical conductivity of the frog\u2019s\nskin, gave full scope to his patience and ingenuity in experimental\ntechnique. Moreover the numerous observations required elaborate\nstatistical treatment ;\nand the knowledge of statistical theory and\npractice which he acquired for his biological work enabled him to\ngive valuable help to the S.P.R.\nHe joined the Society in 1933 and became a Member of Council in\n1934. He did much important research work for the Society, and\nalso made generous gifts both of money and apparatus. He took\npart in the investigation of Rudi Schneider, on which he read the\nSociety a paper, and of Mrs Leonard, and was a Member of the\nCambridge Committee \u2019\n,\nwhich has for some time past been\ninvestigating paranormal cognition. He was the joint author, with\nDr Irwin, of a note (pp. 147-150) aj)pended to Mr Carington\u2019s paper\nin this Bart of Proceedwgs.\nAt the time of his deatli he was also engaged on a study of dowsing\nfrom the standjioint of the {ihysicist, and was intending to give the\nSociety a paper on this subject in the autumn.\nProfessor Broad writes :\nIt was a terril)le blow to the Cambridge Committee, who have\nbeen collaborating with Mr Whately Carington for a long time past\nin his work on extra-sensory perception, to hear of Mr Gatty\u2019s tragic\n(leath. He had been a valued member of our Committee from the\nfirst : he had attended our last meeting on May 27th ;\nand we had\naiianged to meet again on June 18th. His death, which was in every\n\f102]\nObituary \u2018\nway comparable to that of a gallant member of the armed forces in\nthe field of battle, is a severe loss, not only to science and to our\nSociety, but also to those who knew him personally.\nNo one could know Gatty without liking him. To his great\nabilities he added a boyish vigour, enthusiasm, and readiness to\nexplore even fantastic possibilities, for the fun of the game. He was\nalways ready to spend time, labour, thought, and money on any\nproblem of psychical research which seemed_ susceptible of experi-\nmental or statistical treatment. He was patient, kindly, and help-\nful in collaborating with others, and his cheerfulness and enthusiasm\nwere infectious.\nHis colleagues on the Cambridge Committee can understand some-\nthing of what his loss must mean to his wife and family and his\nintimate friends, and their sympathies go out to them m their\nsorrow\u2014a sorrow which is mitigated by pride in his gallant death m\nthe service of his country\n.\nMr Whately Carington sends the following note :\nOliver Gatty\u2019s tragic and untimely death is a serious loss to\nPsychical Research and a great personal blow. The first aspect\nneeds no emphasis by me : as for the second, I shall miss him greatly\nboth as a colleague and a friend. Few men were possessed of so great\na measure of personal charm, and fewer still were so capable of con-\nsolidating immediate liking into lasting affection and regard. On\nthe technical side I owe him much for his enthusiastic and helpful\nmembership of the \u201c Cambridge Committee \u201d. His many interests\nand activities often prevented him from maintaining as close a con-\ntact with the work as we would both have wished ;\nbut his encourage-\nment was invaluable and he had a most unusual facility for grasping\nimplications and for making suggestions of the most ingenious and\nstimulating character.\n, i\n\u2022\nMany kinds of technical ability can be found elsewhere, but his\nespecial gifts I feel to lie irreplaceable.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 163\nOBITUARY\nSir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S.\nSir J. J. Thomson, O.M., F.R.S.\nSince the issue of the last Part of Proceedings the Society has lost\ntwo scientists of the highest distinction, both of whom joined the\nSociety in its very early days and were for many years actively\nassociated with its work.\nJ. J. Thom\u00a7on became a member in 1883, and served on the\nCouncil from 1887 to 1921 ; on his retirement in that year he was\nelected a Vice-President. In 1918 he became Master of Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, which from the days of our founders, Sidgwick,\nMyers and Gurney, has contributed to the Society many of its leading\nmembers, and during his Mastership the connection was strengthened\nby the institution of the Perrott Studentship.\nIt is, however, no disparagement of the great services which\nJ. J. Thomson rendered our Society if Lodge\u2019s work in Psychical\nResearch is treated at greater length. As he has himself recorded in\nPast Years, Lodge\u2019s first acquaintance with Psychical Research was\nthrough Edmund Gurney, who was then collecting and tabulating\nthe material for Phantasms of the Living. The book struck him at\nthe time \u201c as a meaningless collection of ghost stories \u201d, but he was\nimpressed with the energy and seriousness that Gurney devoted\nto his task. Through Gurney he met Myers, and in January 1884,\nwithin two years of the foundation of the Society, he became a\nmember.\nHis first active work is recorded the same year in Vol. II of\nProceedings, in which there appears (page 189) a paper by him\ngiving an account of some \u201c Experiments in Thought Transference \u201d.\nN\n\f210 Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir J. J. Thomson [part\nThis paper is a sliort one ;\nthe experiments took the form mainly of\nasking percipients to reproduce simple diagrams which had been\nexcluded from their normal means of perception. Although these\nparticular experiments were not amenable to statistical analysis,\nLodge from the first recognised the important part that statistics\ncould play in experimental psychical research, for in the same\nvolume of Proceedings is to l)e found a note in the form of a letter\nto Gurney, in which he refers to \u201c the valuable suggestion of M.\nRichet that feeble thought-reading powers or slight mental rever-\nl)erations may be possibly detected in some persons by applying i\nthe laws of probability to a great number of guesses made by them ;\non a limited series of objects \u201d ;\nhe follows this up by suggesting i\nvarious mathematical formulae which could conveniently be used.\nClose association over a long period of years between Richet and\nLodge ripened into the warmest friendship. International co-\noperation is no less necessary in psychical research than in other\nmatters, and no less difficadt to achieve, and the friendship between\nthese two distinguished scientists resulted in much useful collabora-\ntion in our suljject. It is of interest to note that while the French\nphysiologist and the English physicist took much the same view of\nPsychical Research problems regarded in detail, they came to\nfundamentally different conclusions as to their ultimate significance,\nparticularly as bearing on the question of human survival. The\nmeasure of their agreement and their difference appears from two\nshort papers, \u201c For and Against Survival,\u201d which they contributed\nto Vol. XXXIV of Proceedings.\nIt was perhaps natural that, while each of them was aware of the\ndevelopments taking place in the branch of science in which the\nother had specialised, and indeed in scientific thought as a whole,\nhe should have most clearly in his mind the developments taking\nplace within his own province, so that to the physiologist the most\nsignificant development would appear to be the increased knowledge\nof the interconnection of mental and bodily processes, and the\nphysicist would l>e inclined to stress the fact that matter seemed\nto be rapidly shedding many of the concejhions traditionally asso-\nciated with it, physics, as Lodge put it, taking on the character of\nmetaphysics.\nIt was through Richet that Lodge obtained his principal first-hand\nexperience of physical phenomena. In 1894 as Richet\u2019s guest he\nattended sittings with Eusa])ia Paladino in the South of France,\nand formed a favourable opinion of her phenomena, all of which,\nhowever, he agreed could have been simulated, with or without\nprevious preparation, if the control of her head and limbs was\n\f163 ]\nObituary 211\ndefective : in his view, however, the control w^as fully adequate.\nHodgson made various criticisms of the control which were to\nsome extent justified by a later series of sittings held at Cambridge\nin 1895, but Lodge, while admitting the fraud at Cambridge, con-\nsidered that it could not account for the phenomena seen by him\nthe year before, taken as a whole. In this opinion he was con-\nfirmed by the results of other sittings with the same medium, at\nwhich he was not himself present, notably by an incident witnessed\nby his son, Mr Brodie Lodge, at Richet\u2019s house in 1898, when a\nheavy table is reported to have been levitated in broad daylight\nout of doors.\nAn important landmark in Lodge\u2019s career was reached in the\nwinter of 1889, when Mrs Piper, of whom favourable reports had\nbeen received by the Society from America, visited England. She\nwas met on arrival by Lodge, who between November 1889\nand January 1890 had 23 sittings with her, one at Cambridge,\nand the remainder at Liverpool. It is to be observed as an early\nindication of Lodge\u2019s ability as a sitter, subsequently shown on many\nother occasions, that the Liverpool sittings during this visit were\nmuch more successful than those held with other sitters either at\nCambridge or in London. Lodge contributed to Proceedings\n(Vol. VI) a very full account of these sittings, which he prefaced\nwith a formal report in which he said\n\u2014\u201c By introducing anonymous\nstrangers and by catechising her myself in various ways, I have\nsatisfied myself that much of the information she possesses in the\ntrance state is not acquired by Ordinary commonplace methods,\nbut that she has some unusual means of acquiring information.\nThe facts which she discloses are usually within the knowledge of\nsome person present, though they are often entirely out of his\nconscious thought at the time. Occasionally facts have been\nnarrated which have only been verified afterwards, and which are in\ngood faith asserted never to have been known. . . . Concerning\nthe particular means by which she acquires the different kinds of\ninformation, there is no sufficient evidence to make it safe to draw\nany conclusion. I can only say with certainty that it is by none of\nthe ordinary methods known to Physical Science.\u201d\nMrs Piper\u2019s powers were much discussed, inside and outside the\nSociety, during the succeeding years, more especially since, on her\nreturn to the United States, she was for a long time under the\nclose investigation of Hodgson, whose well-known scepticism as\nto many of the phenomena of psychical research did not prevent\nhim publishing, in 1898, a very long report on her {Proceedings,\nYol. XIII), in which he gave emphatic support to the \u201c Spirit\n\f212 Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir .\/. J. Thomson [part\nHypothesis This paper gave rise to much debate, in which\nLodge took a ])rominent part.\nIn 1900, the Society suffered a severe blow by the death of Henry\nSidgwick, one of its founders, and its first President, and this was\nfollowed within a few months, in January 1901, by the death of\nanother of the founders, Frederic Myers. Those who were closely\nassociated with the Society\u2019s work at the time of this double\ndisaster have declared that it was mainly the action of Oliver\nLodge in accepting the Presidency that saved the Society from\nthe apparently imminent danger of collapse. The acceptance of the\nPresidency at that time was a notable act of self-sacrifice as he had\nonly the previous year become Principal of the newly founded\nUniversity of Birmingham. He was re-elected President for the\nyears 1902 and 1903, and the fact that the reins of the Society were\nduring these years in the hands of a man of outstanding distinction\nin science, combined with Lodge\u2019s own personal gifts of tact and\ngeniality, prevailed to set the Society once again on a firm basis,\nand indeed to strengthen it by the attraction of a large number of\nmembers who became actively interested in its work.\nIn his Presidential Address, during his second year of office in\n1902, he said, \u201c If any one cares to hear what sort of conviction has\nbeen borne in upon my own mind as a scientific man, in some 20\nyears familiarity with those questions which concern us, I am very\nwilling to reply as frankly as I can. First, then, I am for all present\npurposes convinced of the persistence of human existence beyond\nbodily death ;\nand though I am unable to justify that belief in a\nfull and complete manner, yet it is a belief which has been produced\nby scientific evidence, that is, it is based upon facts and experience,\nthough I might find it impossible to explain categorically how the\nfacts have produced that conviction.\u201d\nIn view of certain misconceptions which are still current it may not\nbe superfluous to emphasise that as early as 1902, when he was not\nunder any particular emotional stress, he declared himself without\nqualification a l^eliever in survival, the belief being based not upon\nemotion but on \u201c facts and experiences That Lodge only adopted\nthis Ijelief after the death of his son Raymond in the last war is, of\ncourse, an absurdity which has never found acceptance among\nour members.\nIt was, however, not only the evidence obtained throiigh Mrs\nPiper which led Lodge to this position. He had also had successful\nsittings with that very remarkable medium, Mrs Thompson, of\nwhose phenomena, which particularly impressed Myers, regrettably\nfew records survive. He did not make up his mind as to the signi-\n\f163]\nObituary 213\nficance of the Piper and Thompson evidence without giving full\nweight to the complications caused by telepathy, our ignorance of\nthe method by which it works, and our uncertainty as to the limits\nthat can reasonably be attributed to its operation.\nIn the \u201c Cross-Correspondences \u201d which developed shortly after\nMyers\u2019s death, Lodge, like many other close students of the problem,\nthought he saw a prospect of excluding the operation of telepathy\nbetween living minds, and from the very beginning he devoted\nhimself to a study of the complicated evidence resulting.\nMention has already been made of the heavy bereavement he\nsustained in the last war, through the death in action of his son\nEaymond. With great courage he placed before the public the\nevidence he received, before and after his son\u2019s death, which seemed\nto him both to foretell that event\u2014the \u201c Faunus \u201d incident is one\nof the most striking single incidents in the whole of Psychical\nResearch\u2014and also to prove that his son\u2019s personality had survived\ndeath, and coidd and did communicate with those he loved on earth.\nThe frankness of this book provoked in some quarters, as was to be\nexpected, hostility and even ridicule, which Lodge unflinchingly\nmet and answered in a later edition.\nIt was also during the last war that Lodge, whose remarkable\nsuccess with mediums was due less to luck than to his own personal\ngifts of sympathy, made contact with Mrs Leonard. Not the least of\nhis many services to us was to bring the Society into touch with her.\nWhen the Myers Memorial Lectureship was founded the appoint-\nment of Oliver Lodge to deliver the Inaugural Lecture in 1929 was,\nin view of his long and intimate friendship with Myers, and his own\noutstanding position in Psychical Research, inevitable, as was his\nelection as Joint President of Honour with Mrs Sidgwick on the\noccasion of the Society\u2019s Jubilee in 1932.\nIn the many books with which he appealed to a wide audience.\nLodge set out with great lucidity his own philosophy, which found\nnothing incompatible between the conceptions of science, as they\nhad developed during his own lifetime, and those of Psychical\nResearch. On Lodge\u2019s contribution to science, and its connection\nwith Psychical Research, Lord Rayleigh writes as follows :\nSir Oliver Lodge has latterly been known to the general public\neven more as a protagonist of Psychical Research than as a pioneer\nin physical science. Few scientific workers can expect that what\nthey do in their prime will long remain in full view. If it is in the\nmain stream of progress it is almost certain to be overgrown by\nthe work of others who have improved upon it and completed it ;\nand if not in the main stream of progress, it is liable to be pushed\n\f214 Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir J. J. Thomson [part\nout of sight by developments which are more in fashion. It may\nbe suspected that Lodge is no exception to this rule : and it is fitting\nthat his scientific wmrk should be recalled to memory. Only a few\nsalient points can receive notice, and they will be treated in a\ngeneral way. Those who want details will not be at a loss to find\nthem elsewhere.\nComing then to Lodge\u2019s early electrical researches, he began with\nthe investigation of lightning conductors, and this led him to set\nup stationary waves of potential difference along parallel oppositely\nelectrified wires, and he identified the position of nodes and loops.\nWaves of electric force necessarily existed in the intervening space.\nThe velocity of these waves was determined from the measured\nwavelength and calculated frequency, and was shown to agree\napproximately with the velocity of light. All this was concurrent\nwith the work of Hertz on free electric waves, and goes far to estab-\nlish the same general conclusion. Hertz says, in the preface to his\nbook on electric waves :\n\u201cIn the same year that I carried out the above research Professor\nOliver Lodge carried out a series of experiments on the discharge\nof small condensers which led him on to the observation of oscillation\nand waves in wires. . . . There can scarcely be any doubt that if I\nhad not anticipated him he would also have succeeded in observing\nwaves in air, and thus proving the propagation in time of electric\nforces.\u201d\nThe detector of electric waves used in the early wireless telegraphy\nwas Lodge\u2019s \u201c coherer \u201d. As first used by him this took the form\nof two slightly oxidised brass knobs, in contact. When electric\nwaves fell on this arrangement it was found that electrical contact\nwas established between the knobs, which could readily be detected\nby means of a battery and galvanometer. The tube of iron filings\nwhich was used later was due to Branly, and Lodge, with charac-\nteristic fairmindedness, always emphasised the importance of\nBranly\u2019s contribution.\nEveryone is familiar nowadays with \u201c tuning in \u201d to the wireless.\nThis really has no necessary connection with transmission over long\ndistances. It should be emphasised that Lodge was the first person\nto put electrical circuits into and out of resonance. He did this in\nthe experiment called the \u201c Syntonic Leyden jars \u201d. Hertz a little\nearlier had spoken about resonance, but there was no real resonance\nin his experiments, because his sender did not give out persistent\noscillations, and only so can resonance come into evidence. You\ncan have resonance to the note of a tuning fork but not to the crack\nof a whip.\n\f163 ]\nObituary 215\nLodge later applied electrical resonance to the first system of\ntuned wireless telegraphy, of which he was the pioneer. This was\na spark system, which only gave limited trains of oscillations, like\na tuning fork intermittently struck. The modern system uses a\ncontinuous train of oscillations, like an organ pipe continuously\nblown, which of course lends itself to more accurate tuning : but\nLodge made the essential step.\nIt is not always realised that the famous principle of relativity\nhas its origin not in a metaphysical conception about the nature\nof space and time, but in an induction from experience. Nineteenth\ncentury physics had built up the conception that space was tilled\nwith a medium of a r^uasi-material nature (called ether) through\nwhich light was propagated. The earlier, and simpler, view was\nthat this medium carried transverse waves of elastic displacement,\nlike an elastic solid. But when the idea of waves of elastic displace-\nment was superseded by Maxwell\u2019s conception of waves of electrical\ndisjrlacement, the idea of an ether was not abandoned. If there is\na medium, it looked as if we ought to detect our motion through it,\nas for example when the earth on which we are situated moves round\nthe sun at a speed of some 19 miles a second. There should Ire, in\neffect, a wind of ether of 19 miles a second blowing through our\nlaboratories, and it ought to be possible to bring it into evidence\nby a variety of methods. But the result is always negative. The\nwind will not come into evidence. Some people thought that this\nproved that the ether was carried along locally by the earth, as\nwater is to some extent dragged along Iry a ship. This view leads\nus into diliicidties in other directions ;\nfor example, it is not easily\nreconciled with known facts about the aberration of the stars. But\nLodge\u2019s best contribution to this question was in the direction not\nof speculation. He determined to try the difficult experiment of\ndetermining whether in fact the ether was carried along l)y a moving\nbody, using not the earth, but a pair of rapidly rotating steel discs.\nThe question was whether light would travel faster with the discs\nthan against them, when it was sent round the circuit by successive\nreflexions : and the answer which Lodge arrived at was that it did\nnot. If the ether moved, it was with less than of velocity\nof the disc. This experiment then suggested strongly that the ether\nwas not carried along with the earth : and in fact it was one of the\ncontributory causes which led most physicists to abandon the\nattempt to interpret the .optical phenomena of moving bodies in\nterms of ether, and to range themselves with the view of Einstein,\nwho recommended the abandonment of this method of apjjroach\nas unfruitful, and substituted the approach by the principle of\n\f216 Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir J. J. Thomson [part\nrelativity which asserts ah initio that any experiment designed to\ndetect uniform motion relative to the ether is doomed to failure.\nLodge himself, however, oddly enough, could never whole-\n|\nheartedly accept this standpoint. He always wished to retain the i\nearlier and more matter-of-fact point of view, insisting on an ether i\nwith definite quasi-material properties. It was in fact curious to j\ncontrast his rather materialistic point of view about ether with his\nanti-materialistic point of view about other things, and notably '\nabout the subjects with which our Society is mainly concerned.\nLodge attempted to relieve the difficulties attending the concep-\ntion of an afterlife without a material basis by pointing out that the i\nprocesses of the physical world are largely occurring in what may be\ncalled at pleasure ether or simply space. For example, take the i\ntransmission of light from the sun to a terrestrial observer who\nmay be watching solar phenomena. The sun is material, and sends\nout light. The observer\u2019s eye is material, and receives it. But the\ntransmission takes 8 minutes, and is going on in the intervening\nspace. Nothing can be found out about what is going on without\nintroducing a material receiver, such as the eye, a photographic\nplate, or a thermopile. His point was that the material receiver\ngets its inspiration from what goes on in the space outside, and he\nsuggested that the material human organism plays a similar part\nof receiving and making apparent what is going on in a non-material,\ni.e. spiritual world. No doubt the attempt to analyse what is going ;\non in the empty space of physics has proved very difficult, and\nopinion about it has shifted. But, as it seems to the present writer,\nLodge did not attempt to define in detail the processes going on in\nthe spiritual world either ;\nand the rather vague analogy which he\nsuggested will stand equally well whether we attempt to define\nthe properties of the intervening space in terms of an \u201c ether \u201d or\nwhether, as is now more customary, we avoid the word. He did\nnot in fact appeal to any supposed property of the ether, such as,\nfor example, the very high density which he at one time attributed\nto it, in his suggested analogy.\nThe above seems to the writer to express the gist of Lodge\u2019s\nviews. But they have been quite freely restated above, and it is\npossible that he would not have accepted the restatement which is\nhere offered.\nWith the advent of broadcasting. Lodge found himself in touch,\nvery close touch, with an audience even larger than his books had\nreached. The appeal of his thought was reinforced by the charm\nof his voice and manner. Few who heard it are likely to forget the\n\f163]\nObituary 217\nemotion in his voice when he closed his contribution to a series of\ntalks which members of the Society had given over the wireless in\n1934, with these words : \u201cI am grateful to the authorities of the\nB.B.C. for allowing me to express my mature convictions un-\nhindered ill what may possibly prove my last talk to you. If it\nshould happen that my work down here is done, or nearly done, let\nme take an affectionate farewell.\u201d\nBut for the Society the day of farewell was still far distant.\nUntil the date of his death he remained a member of the Council of\nthe S.P.R. and also of the Committee of Reference and Publication,\nand except when prevented by ill-health was very active in both\ncapacities.\nLord Balfour writes :\nTo know Lodge was to love him : to know him better was to love\nhim better. I have some right to speak, for my acquaintance with\nhim, begun more than forty years ago, ripened into close friendship\nfrom the time when we became associated together in the investiga-\ntion of Mrs Willett\u2019s mediumship.\nIn what did this quality of loveableness consist? Perhaps little\nor nothing would be gained by trying to resolve it into its elements.\nSpiritually, and physically, everything about him was beautiful.\nBut in the forefront I should be inclined to place a certain grand\nsimphcity, adorable in a man so richly endowed by nature, and so\nsuccessful in achievement.\nLodge\u2019s share in the practical research work of the Society was\nmainly, if not wholly concerned with his sittings with mediums,\nnotably with Mrs Piper, and Mrs Leonard. The simplicity, of\nwhich I have spoken, was undoubtedly an asset to him as a sitter,\nby creating that atmosphere of sympathy which seems to be essential\nif the best results are to be obtained. It would not have been\nsurprising if at the same time it had tended to detract from the\ncautious attitude which the investigation of mediumship calls for.\nBut I do not think this happened in Lodge\u2019s case. He was fully\nalive to the pitfalls which beset the inquiry, and was a most con-\nscientious recorder. If certain passages in his records were calculated\nto raise a smile, or even to excite ridicule, this is not to be ascribed\nto guileless naivete but to a scrupulous integrity which forbade any\ntampering with the records. What I most admire in him was his\nintellectual honesty, and his courage in standing fast by what he\nbelieved to be truth. Lodge was the one eminent man of science\nwho wholeheartedly accepted the evidence for survival and the\npossibihty of commrmication with the departed. He devoted his\nremarkable gift of exposition to missionary work on behalf of his\n\f218 Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir J. J. Thomson [part\nconvictions, and his scientific reputation probably suffered in\nconsequence. If so, that is all the more reason why members.of the\nS.P.R. should honour his memory. If the convictions which he so\nvaliantly championed continue to make headway, as I believe they\nwill, great will be his vindication. In any case, his name must\nalways rank in the annals of the Society with those of Myers,\nGurney, Mrs Verrall and the Sidgwicks.\nMiss Nea Walker, who for several years had special opportunities\nof seeing Oliver Lodge at work and in his home life, has sent us the\nfollowing memories ;\nI have been asked to write a few personal reminiscences of Sir\nOliver Lodge. In trying to do this I have found it impossible to\ngive the kind of picture of him which I should like to have, were I\nthe reader, without appearing in it myself. And I therefore ask\nforgiveness in advance for the inevitable amount of this intrusion.\nSir Oliver chose me during the summer of 1915 to replace another\nwoman secretary who was getting married, and my work was to\nbegin in October of that year. I well remember the, to me, terrify-\ning interview before my appointment, when he asked me whether\nI \u201c spoke French, German, Italian, and Spanish? \u201d I could only\nclaim the first two. Then,\n\u2014\u201c What about Greek and Latin?\n\u201d\nThe Greek alphabet, and a very shaky acquaintance with Latin,\nwere all I could muster. \u201c Humph,\u2014well, how about Physics and\nMathematics? \u201d These were nil. \u201c What do you know about\npsychical research? \u201d I could not possibly say that I had only\nheard of \u201c Sir Oliver Lodge and his Spooks \u201d. So there was an\nembarrassed pause. Then,\n\u2014\u201c Ever heard of Myers, Gurney,\nSidgwick? \u201d I had not. \u201c Dear, dear, they are household words\nhere. Do you object to psychical research? \u201d I could not say,\n\u2014\nI knew nothing about it. (Sigh) :\n\u2014\u201c Well, let\u2019s go and have tea \u201d,\nand I was led from the summerhouse at Mariemont, through the\nlofty book-lined study, to the dining-room with its long table seating\nten or fifteen people comfortably, and fairly regularly. This tea-\ntime was to be, for the next five years, a very familiar and pleasant\nscene : Lady Lodge\u2019s chair was at the end of the table. Sir Oliver\nsat on her left ;\nany guests near them ;\nthen as many of \u201c The\nFamily \u201d as might be in ;\nand near the doors leading to the study\nand the hall respectively, always room for Mr Briscoe (Sir Oliver\u2019s\nLbiiversity Secretary) and me. Mr Briscoe did not always achieve\ntea ;\nbut I found myself very ready when the five o\u2019clock gong went.\nAnd, though one sat, as it were, \u201c below the salt \u201d, that being con-\nveniently near the door by which one had entered. Sir Oliver had a\n\f163]\nObituary 219\ncharming way, if a distinguished guest were present, of remarking,\n\u2014\n\u201c That is IVIiss Nea Walker, she knows your wife \u201d,\u2014or some\nequivalent description, mostly based upon a very flimsy link. Often\none would much rather not have been noticed in one\u2019s distant corner,\nbut the kindly wsh to put at ease was none the less appreciated.\nAnd, frequently, the interesting conversation tempted me to linger\nhstening when I ought to have been back at work in my room.\nThought for employees did not end with tea, for we all had a glass\nof hot milk at eleven ;\nand Sir Oliver would often, during the\n1914-18 war, ask me if I were \u201c sure I was getting enough to eat at\nhome ?\n\u201d He knew that I lived on my salary, and I wonder now if\nhe was remembering his own early hardships.\nVery occasionally, if tired or worried, he might answer Irritably\nat tea-time about some trifle, and immediately there would be an\nexpression in his eyes so like that of a St. Bernard who has been rude\nto some smaller friend. I cannot think that he ever let the sun go\ndown upon his wrath in things large or small. His attitude towards\nanything frail was always gentle, and it was an unforgettable picture\nto see him carry a baby grandchild firmly cradled in the crook of one\narm\u2014the baby so obviously feeling comfortable and safe that it did\nnot cry.\nMr Briscoe worked in Sir Oliver\u2019s Study, but I had a room near\nthe front door to which Sir Oliver came when he had time for what\nwas the lighter part of his work. I often did not see him of a\nmorning ;\nhe would come in after tea and dictate for a couple of\nhours ;\nor, I should find a note on my table after lunch saying,\n\u2014\n\u201c N. W., come to the summerhouse \u201d. These entries and summonses\nused, for the first six months or so, to cause me to shake at the knees\neach time : it must have been due to his great height and big voice,\nfor I later found that there was nothing to fear, only much to\nlove.\nI sometimes, in early days, incurred his temporary wrath by not\nunderstanding that two minutes after he had left me, he had\nswitched his mind on to another subject, and that, if approached with\na supplementary inquiry about the previous one, he did not know\nwhat I was talking about and, by the time I had begun to remind\nhim, was quite put off his track in the new compartment of his brain\nto which he had switched over. Exit a crestfallen secretary leaving\nan irritated chief. This ability to work in different and, as it were,\nwatertight compartments of the brain must have contributed to his\nability to undertake such an enormous amount of varied work.\nI had been nervously expecting to take up my work with Sir Oliver\non the first of October 1915, but was alarmed by a telegram asking\n\f220 Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir ,J . J . Thomso7i [part\nme to come on the afternoon of September 29th to Mariemont. On\narrival I was asked to \u201c go to the summerhouse with my shorthand\nnotebook \u201d, and there, without further preliminaries. Sir Oliver\nbegan to dictate. It proved to be a report of his first anonymous\nsitting with Mrs Leonard which had taken jfiace on the 27th. I was\nbewildered. I had never done any work like it, and went home\nwondering whether I had been dreaming or was \u201c going mad\nThe next day I tried to transcribe my notes, and left the effort on\nSir Oliver\u2019s desk, to find it the following morning on mine, scored\nand marked and corrected in every direction. I thought,\n\u2014\u201c That\u2019s\nthe end of this post for me! \u201d and waited for the wrath to come.\nBut, to my amazement, when I shakily apologised for having\nevidently made a hojieless muddle of it. Sir Oliver said,\n\u2014\u201c Oh, but\nI made the muddle of your typing\u2014it\u2019s only that I don\u2019t yet know\nmyself how I waiit it set out.\u201d So we settled down to work out the\nmethod, and the rest of that winter went mostly in preparing the\nbook \u201c Raymond \u201d. It was at this time that I learnt always to give\n])rominence to the weaknesses of evidence laboriously gathered, and\nto record at once every tiny item whether it seemed relevant or not.\nAlso to regard oneself as suspect, and, whenever feasible, to get\noutside testimony to the truth of one\u2019s statements.\nThen came the ])ul)lication of \u201c Raymond \u201d, and the terrific\ncorrespondence which resulted, from opponents, from sympathisers,\nand from people bereaved l)y the war. All this correspondence fell\nto my lot, exce])t what Sir Oliver sent on to Mr J. Arthur Hill, after\nalways answering the first letter himself. And Imth J. A. H. and I\nhad as much work as we could manage : the files in my room grew\nand grew.\nSir Oliver was working hard in all kinds of other directions, at\nthe University, and on research connected with the war ;\noften in\nsummer when 1 arrived at nine o\u2019clock, he would say proudly that\nhe had been \u201c rloing mathematics \u201d in the summerhouse since seven.\nAnd I know that his day often ended with reading aloud to The\nFamily for a coujile of hours after an eight o\u2019clock dinner. But he\nalways made time to answer, almost by return, the bereaved people\nwho wrote to him. Sometimes he sat in my room, sometimes, even\nin winter, in the summerhouse, clad in a large fawnish check Inver-\nness coat with a hood, though he always wore a cap, or a panama\nhat. Frequently he nursed one or other of the Mariemont Persian\ncats. I remember his saying one day that he wondered whether the\nprevailing method of destroying domestic animals by using chloro-\nform was as kind as we thought, their noses being so sensitive\n\u2014\n\u201c Perhaps one day we shall find it isn\u2019t.\u201d I think that the best\n\f163]\nObituary 221\nmodern veterinary practice has justified his suspicion ;\nthey cer-\ntainly seem to like to inject morphia first.\nAt these times he allowed himself to smoke\u2014always a cigarette\nin a long holder. One could never forget his hands with their\nlong sensitive fingers\u2014rather like the Dlirer etching, only more\npowerful.\nThe correspondence was so large that he occasionally became\nconfused among the correspondents, and started his letter on the\nwrong track for some one. I had learnt not to interrupt, but he\nwould often stop and say,\n\u2014\u201c Am I telling the truth ?\n\u201d which\nallowed me to disentangle the particular individual for him out of a\ncomposite picture he had evolved for himself. But this was rare,\nand only the slightest reminder was necessary.\nWhen he had been ujr to London for S.P.R. Meetings he would\nimmediately after his return dictate a full account to J. A. H., or\nto Lady Lodge, if she were away from home. And sometimes he\nwould stop and tell me tales of the old days at the S.P.R., elucidating\na reference which he knew I should not understand. Thus, quite\nquickly, Myers, Gurney, Sidgwick, Richet, Mrs Verrall, Eusapia,\nMrs Piper, and many other names became household words to me\nalso ;\nand I now feel astonishment when I realise that, as to me in\n1915, they still have no meaning for the many. At these times I\nlearnt how deep was his affection for Mr Myers ;\nhow much he felt\nMrs Verrall\u2019s death and admired her courage ;\nand how he regarded,\nalmost with awe. Professor Sidgwick\u2019s \u201c shining integrity \u201d.\nSir Oliver\u2019s desk left much to be desired from a secretarial point\nof view, as also from the point of view of a faithful parlourmaid\nwhose duty it was to dust the Study. There Sir Oliver worked\n\u201c in geological strata \u201d, and it was a miracle how he found what he\nrequired. But nothing important went astray.\nHis handwriting was well described by Lady Grey as \u201c the spider\nout of the ink \u201d. He wrote extremely fast, being able to keejr pace\nwhen taking longhand notes at sittings with mediums, recording at\nthe same time anything he might say himself\u2014a feat, as any short-\nhand-writer who has worked with mediums will know. It looked\nillegible but was not really so when one was accustomed to it ;\nand\nI often found that, when he himself was puzzled by a word, I could\nread it by turning it upside down.\nHe always walked to and from the University, and, in addition,\nused to try and get some exercise without going far afield ;\nthis\nmost conveniently took the form of sawing wood, and Lady Lodge\nwas, I fancy, often anxious lest some decorative tree in the Marie-\nmont garden fell a victim to his need.\n\f222 Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir J. J. Thomson [part\nIn 1919 came Sir Oliver\u2019s retirement from the Principalship of\nBirmingham University, and his Lecture Tour in the United States\nwhere Lady Lodge accompanied him. There they made many\nfriends, one of whom at least was closely in touch with him to the\nend. I had commitments in Birmingham then, and could not leave\nto settle with him in Wiltshire when he decided to go there. So,\nrather than let me go back to what he called \u201c the status quo ante \u201d,\nby accepting another clerical post in Birmingham, he decided to\ncarry on his work with me by post. A sudden illness of mine in\n1921 led to the \u201c temporary \u201d appointment of a resident secretary\nat Normanton, Miss Helen Alvey, who was with him when he died\non his wedding day, August 22, 1940. And my work from then on\nevolved into dealing with his bereaved correspondents, and, while\ntrying to help them, carrying out experiments which might be useful\nin psychical research. This work he generously financed, though\nit helped him no whit. I often wonder whether those whom he\nhelped had the faintest idea of his generosity to them, for he was\nnever a rich man. I remember being troubled frequently because\nwhat I was doing was not helping him ;\nbut his answer invariably\nwas : \u201cIf you are doing psychical research work of any sort, you\nare doing my work.\u201d And he always allowed one to express one\u2019s\nown point of view, whether it agreed with his or not. He had a\nknack of acquiring helpers whom he was loth to drop, fortunately\nfor them, even after they had ceased to function in the way he had\nat first intended.\nA last example of kindness occurs to me. On his return from his\nAmerican Lecture Tour, and before it was decided that I was to\ncontinue working with him, I found on my desk an envelope inscribed\nin his own handwriting ;\n\u201c N. W.\nI have been giving a little present to each of my daughters. So\nI hope you will include yourself in that category for the present.\nOliver Lodge.\u201d\nInside was a cheque for twenty-five pounds! I still keep that\nenvelope, and have never had cause to feel that I was outside that\n\u201c category \u201d, even though I saw much less of him in the subsequent\nyears.\nThere are memory pictures of him at Normanton too, where I am\nglad to have stayed. But, though I have a vivid picture of a real\nhome in lovely surroundings, and of evenings spent listening to his\ninimitable play-reading, there are others better fitted to describe\nthat part of his life and work winch still went on. One of those\n\f163]\nObituary 223\nclosely associated in my mind in the picture of his declining years is\nhis chauffeur-valet Walker. I have rarely seen anything as beautiful\nas the way Sir Oliver depended upon Walker, and the unobtrusive-\nness of any necessary help Walker gave. The friendship, and\nmutual respect and affection, were so obvious. One can most\nsafely judge a man or woman by their treatment of subordinates,\nand I think that no one who worked for Sir Oliver Lodge could\nfail to love him for that alone. His body is being buried at Wilsford\nas I write this small account : I chose the time, thinking it would\nperhaps bring back the kind of memories in which his other admirers\nmight like to share.\n22 August 1940.\nN. W.\n\fPSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF TELEPATHY\nBy Hans Ehrenwald, M.D. (Prague).\nSo-called supernormal phenomena\u2014if they are discussed seriously\nat all\u2014are a foreign substance in the body scientific. Academic\nscience even to-day emphatically denies their existence or even their\npossibility. Yet the investigations of the last decades\u2014not only in\nthe line of psychical research but also of clinical psychiatry and\ndeep-psychology\u2014have gathered a great deal of evidence for the\noccasional manifestation of extraordinary phenomena in certain\n\u201c border-line \u201d cases, in hysterical patients and in persons in\nmediumistic trance. To cite exceptional performances during sleep\nand dream, in the psycho-analytical situation, in states of split\npersonality, etc., has become well-nigh a commonplace.\nNot long ago, however, the rationalistic trend of psychopathology\nwas reluctant to acknowledge even the reliability of observations of\nsuch kinds. Henry Maudsley, one of the pioneers of English psy-\nchiatry, insisted on ascribing all these reports to defective observa-\ntion and fallacious interpretation, or even to delusive self-deception\non the part of the observers. The same objection has been put\nforward ever since over and over again\u2014and we must admit, often\nwith good reason\u2014by numerous authors. The criticism of Millais\nCulpin,'^ about twenty years ago, made at least one concession.\nHe pointed to the role of Janet\u2019s mental dissociation in causing the\nalleged supernormal phenomena. This state facilitates, in his view,\nan incidental hyper-sensitiveness of the sensory functions. He refers\nto the well-known observations of Binet, A. Hurst, etc., on hyper-\naesthesia of hearing and of touch, amounting to 16-50 times the\nsharpness of that of the normal individual. Supernormal phenomena,\nparticularly telepathic performances, are based, on this view,\nmainly on uncritical interpretation of hyper-functions of the sense\norgans, such as muscle reading, listening to \u201c unconscious whisper-\ning \u201d, etc.\nYet these hyper-functions, however striking they may appear,\ndo not suffice to explain the occurrence of real \u201c supernormal\n\u201d\nphenomena, in cases where we can accept their existence as estab-\n* Millais Culj^in, Spirihialisjn and the New Psychology. London, 1920.\n224\n\f[PAHT 163] Psychopathological Aspects of Telepathy 225\nlished. A quasi-physiological working hyjjothesis of this kind seems\nto be, nevertheless, an expedient starting point for the approach\nattempted here. It seems to be advisable to make a particular\ninstance of this group of hyper-functions the object of our closer\nconsideration. Experimental psychology has repeatedly dealt with\nthe extraordinary faculty of an accurate time-appreciation during\nsleep and hypnosis. Such observations have been reported by Bern-\nheim, Forel and more recently by Milne Bramwell, T. W. Mitchell,\nL. D. Boring, E. N. Brush and others. The present writer\u2019s ex-\nperiments in the Prague Psychiatric Clinics from the year 1923i\nmay also be mentioned here. These attempted to verify the ob-\nservations in question by means of experiments of unconscious\ntime-estimation during hypnosis. In these tests the subjects were\nfound to be able to perceive times vaguely from some minutes up\nto several hours with considerable exactness, the error scarcely\nexceeding from two to five per cent. Moreover certain individuals\nwere found to commit errors of a constant over- or under-estimation\nof the times tested in the form of a constant quotient. In this way\nthey resulted in giving a significant demonstration of the exactness\nof this group of \u201c unconscious \u201d performances, such as could never\nbe achieved by the waking consciousness. There are moreover a\nnumber of clinical observations which indicate the preservation\nof similar faculties, even where there is a marked impairment of\ncorresponding conscious mental functions. For instance, a further\nseries of experiments with hypnosis has ascertained the function of\nan unconscious, \u201c primitive \u201d time-sense in patients with Kor-\nsakoff s disease, although the complete lack of temporal orientation\nis one of the main features of this syndrome. Experiences in certain\npatients with various aphasic and kindred disorders caused by more\nor less localised bilateral cerebral lesions gave similar results.^\nThus in these cases hypnosis or more or less pronounced organic\nlesion has led to what might here also be called a \u201c dissociation \u201d of\nmental function, and a hyperactivity of a particular faculty, un-\nknown in the normal individual in the waking state, was attained\nin these conditions too. We can even say that this hyper-function\nseems to be particularly marked in the condition of a reduced\nmental level of an \u201c abbaissement general du niveau mental \u201d as\nJanet puts it. The time-estimation of modern man represents a\ndeteriorated atavistic function, and it seems to be just the relapse\nto a primitive functional level during sleep, hypnosis or an organic\n^ \u201c Experiments on Unconscious Time-Appreciation \u201d.

We know that\nanalogous faculties seem to be preserved in certain reactions of the i\ninfant, and in the habits of social insects, particidarly bees. -The\nstriking performances of spatial orientation in migrant birds are\nproverbial, and Professor Culpin refers to analogous powers of\norientation in savages as an example of hyperaesthesia in the sense\nmentioned above.\nAll these observations deserve more than a mere accidental\ninterest. They show that the fundamental biological principle of\ncompensation and over-compensation holds true also in regard to\nthe mental activities of man. It is undoubtedly a lasting merit of\nAlfred Adler, the founder of Individual Psychology, to have made !\nthis principle the chief tenet of his doctrine, even if it has not been :\nentirely a matter of recent psychological discovery. Homer, the \u2022\nblind seer, Demosthenes, the stammering orator, have exemplified\nthe same principle among the ancients, and the case of Helen Keller,\nand some facts revealed by modern sense-physiology, as for instance\nthe marked refinement of the cutaneous sensilulity in congenital\nIdindness, etc., all point in the same direction.\nA corresponding observation of the present writer, ^ concerning the\nconditional improvement of the faculty of \u201c reading \u201d by the skin |\nin a case of word-blindness due to an arterio-sclerotic lesion of the\nlirain, gives a further instance of these correlations. Any temporary\nim])airment of the patient\u2019s residual reading ability (it extended to\na few meaningless letters only) was linked with a temporarily marked\nimprovement of his \u201c skin-reading \u201d, and vice-versa any improve-\nnient of his visual functions led to a transient reduction of his\n\u201c skin-reading \u201d ability. In this case I realised that these alter-\nnative processes were a sign of a counterbalancing transmission of\ncentral energies from one kind of mental activity to another, the\nim])airment of the first appearing to set free a certain amount of\nenergy, thus improving the second, and the improvement of the\nsecond consuming an adequate amount of energy, thus impairing\nthe first.\nThe observations made in this case are significant for our problem\nmainly as a further example of the suggested compensatory cor- i\nrelations in the field of the pathology of the brain. But they reveal i\nat the same time a remarkable counterpart of another observation, I\nleading far beyond the sphere of any merely biological compensatory l\nmechanism, into the sphere of alleged supernormal phenomena.\n1 \u201c Observations in a Case of Word-blindness \u201d {Zsrhr. f. d. Ges. Neur. u.\nPftyrhi(itrie). 1930.\n\f163] Psychopathological Aspects of Telepathy 227\nThe case was examined by the well-known Professor of Forensic\nMedicine in Kiga, F. von Neureiterd and his record is based on\nthorough observation both medical and psychological. As regards\nthe thoroughness and comprehensiveness of these preliminary ex-\naminations the case seems to be unique of its kind and therefore\nparticularly apt for the present purjiose. The experimenter seems\nto have observed every precautionary measure desirable against\nany possible deception or self-deception. Moreover, it is to be em-\nphasised that the subject was more or less an imbecile child so that\nany fraudulent intention, any possibility of collusion could be ruled\nout at the outset. A great part of the examinations took place in\nthe absence of the child\u2019s relatives in Professor Neureiter\u2019s institute\nin Riga, and their authenticity was vouched for by several members\nof the Riga University.\nAs far as I know his small booklet of 56 pages has remained little\nknown to the English public and the great theoretical interest of\nthe facts revealed has been disregarded both by orthodox science\nand psychical research. Thus a short epitome in these pages of\nProfessor Neureiter\u2019s account seems to be justifiable. It was in his\ncapacity as a medical authority that Dr F. Kleinberger, a medical\npractitioner in Trapene, Lithuania, appealed to him in a letter, part\nof which may be reproduced here in my own translation.\n\u201c . . . As I assume that you are interested in things of that kind,\nI should like to report to you a case of outstanding interest, as far\nas I can see. ... It is the case of a nine-year-old girl. Both\nparents are alive and healthy, they are smallholders. The mother,\nwhom I met, makes a thoroughly intelligent impression. No mental\ndisorders or other abnormalities in the rest of the family or in the\nascendants, as far as I can understand. There are two more children,\nan elder and a younger one, both normal. The child in question\nwas normally born, and developed, according to her mother, in a\nnormal way. She played with other children normally, etc., she\nwas rather lively and sociable. The only thing which struck those\nwho knew her was that she remained backward in speaking. When\n7-8 years of age she expressed herself in the manner of a child of 2.\nAt the age of 8 she eventually managed to speak so far as to be able\nto attend an elementary school. Initially, as long as she had to learn\nonly disjointed letters, she was able to foUow the tuition. Later on,\nhowever, when reading syllables was to be taken up, the teacher\nwas startled by her complete incapacity to read even the simplest\ncontext. That was the case when she was sitting in the classroom,\non her form. But if the teacher were standing near the girl, reading\n^ Wissen um Fremdes Wissen, etc. Gotha, 1935.\n\f228 Hans Ehremvald, M.D. [part\ngently or only in iJiought to himself, the child \u201c read \u201d without\nmistake, a text which she had never learned to read before, or even\nany text required, and in any foreign language, though she knew\nonly Lithuanian.\u201d\nDr Kleinberg adds that although the child\u2019s performances in\narithmetic were similarly poor, they became equally amazing when\nthe calculation in question was made by the teacher (or by her\nmother) in thought. The latter also complained that she was unable\nto hide anything from the child\u2014llga knew at once where\nthe object concerned was hidden. Dr Kleinberg, also, had per-\nformed a few tests with llga which fully confirmed the information\nobtained.\nProfessor Neureiter, after some hesitation, consented to see the\nchild in Riga. The first session took place in his consulting room\nwith Ilga\u2019s mother acting as agent. llga was sitting with her back\nturned towards her mother or behind closed doors in a neighbouring\nroom. These preliminary observations confirmed the previous\nreports in every respect. Yet it was only the vivid interest of\nProfessor Neureiter\u2019s colleagues at the University of Riga and an\nencouraging letter from Professor Driesch of Leipzig that induced\nhim to take up the investigations in a more systematic way. The\ntime available for that purpose was somewhat short. Ilga\u2019s home\nvillage was rather far away from Riga and her mother could not\nspare more than two days\u2019 absence from her home. The second\nsession took place next morning, on May 22nd, 1935, with several\nmembers of the University present, the third session on the same\nevening with still more witnesses participating. To begin with, the\nresults were disappointing. The tests proved after a few lucky hits,\na complete failure, leading eventually to Ilga\u2019s starting to cry\nbitterly. Yet after the child had had a little rest and a meal, the\natmosphere became somewhat more cheerful, and llga succeeded\nin producing several of her usual performances. She did still better\nin the third session, after Professor Neureiter had ceased to carry\nout the tests in presence of all the invited witnesses, and instead\nallowed only a couple of them to participate at any one time.\nAll these observations, however, did not fully satisfy Professor\nNeureiter. He therefore decided to see llga in her home village.\nHere he resumed his investigations with his colleague, Professor\nAmsler, the pharmacologist of the University of Riga, and Dr\nKleinl)erger present. The observations gathered on that occasion\nwere so convincing that he could no longer refrain from acknow-\nledging that the jfiienomena were genuine. Prof. Neureiter points\nto the following arguments in favour of this opinion : (1) The\n\f163]\nPsychopathological Aspects of Telepathy 229\nsubject was a feeble-minded child whose reduced mental capacity\nnecessarily ruled out the possibility of using some intricate code,\nthat is, the possibility of collusion. On the other hand, the facts\nto be established required no intricate means of observation. They\ncould be elicited and checked in the most simple way. (2) The\npossibility of deception could be ruled out by placing the agent and\nthe percipient with their backs turned to one another, when sitting\nin the same room, or separated by a curtain. In some of the later\nexperiments they were sitting in two separate rooms. (3) Particular\ncare was taken to notice and avoid the slightest sign of involuntary\nwhispering on the part of the agent. Lip reading was excluded\nbeforehand by the measures mentioned above ;\nProfessor Neureiter\nand his substitutes, when acting as senders, took special care to\navoid giving away clues of any such kind. (4) Professor Neureiter\nconsiders that the fact that any attempt at intentional and deliber-\nate transmission of \u201c thoughts \u201d failed completely was a further\nargument in favour of the genuineness of the phenomena. The\nbest results were to be obtained when the agents refrained from any\nsuch intentional behaviour, e.g. when the child\u2019s attention was\ndiverted from the test by her being absorbed in play.\nThe number of tests performed altogether amounted to 42, all\nof which have been thoroughly recorded. A few are reproduced\nbelow.\nTest 9. One of the participants, Professor Briickmanii, writes\nthis calculation on a sheet of paper :\n4.4 + 5.5 = 41\nand hands it over to llga\u2019s mother who was playing the part of\nagent. She turns to Professor Neureiter stating that she did not\nunderstand the task. Professor Neureiter is just about to explain\nto her that the points mean signs of midtiplication, when the child,\nunexpectedly, utters the number 41. Her mother, obviously,\nfollowing Professor Neureiter\u2019s explanations, was just considering\nthe result of the calculation and the transmission took place in that\nvery moment.\nTest 12. Professor Amsler writes in the adjoining room a list of\nwords and figures on a sheet of paper. Then he enters the room\nwhere, behind a curtain, the mother is situated, while the rest of\nthose present stay with the child in front of the curtain. Ilga,\nwithout being asked to do so and without interrupting her play,\nreproduces the whole list without the slightest mistake.\nTask :\nger, til, tli. Solution :\nger, til, tli,\n123, 213, 312. 123, 213, 312.\n\f230 Hans Ehremvahl, M.D. [part\nHer voice differs on these occasions from her normal way of speaking.\nShe pronounces each syllable more distinctly, in a somewhat ex-\naggerated manner. In another test she reproduces the figure 42 as\n12. From the attached reproduction of Professor Neureiter\u2019s hand-\nwriting the cause of this mistake is clearly to be seen : her mother\nmistook the 1 for a 4, thus revealing unmistakably her exclusive\nrole as an agent in the instance in question.\nWe have already emphasised that in the beginning experiments\nwith persons, other than her mother, acting as agents, proved fail-\nures. Yet the following test gives a very instructive example of\nsuch an initial failure and subsequent success.\nTest 38. \u201c I (Professor Neureiter) take the place of the agent and\ntry to transmit to the child the figures 9 and 2 ;\nthen a sentence,\nprinted in the child\u2019s Lithuanian primer ; Mate gaja uz kleti. I\nconcentrate with exertion upon my task, sharply accentuating every\nsyllable in thought . .\n.\nyet in spite of all effort the percipient\nremains silent. 1 am just about to close the book discontentedly\nand to break up the experiment when my look is caught by the\nword Brute (\n= bride) in the context of the Lithuanian poem, the\nfirst words of which I was trying in vain to transmit. And at that\nvery moment the child, situated in the adjoining room, uttered the\nword. Thus this was the way by which the reception happened\nto work perfectly, although\u2014or better because\u2014I refrained from\nvolitional sending. At the moment when I perceived the word\nBrute I wondered why it was used in a modern Lithuanian first\nspelling book. It was taken from the German Brant, thus it was a\nforeign word, and, moreover, obsolete. There was instead, the\ngenuine Lithuanian Ligava available. Considering all that, I did\nnot, in any case, think any longer of my original task. . .\n.\u201d\nProfessor Neureiter adds that this whole chain of reasoning did\nnot take place in any formulated way of thinking. Accordingly only\nthe word that gave rise to his reflections became transmitted to the\nchild. From that he draws the conclusion that it is not the mental\ncontents pure and simple which are liable to telepathic transmission\nin his case but exclusively words formed in the \u201c inner language\n\u201d\nof the agent. Yet this activity of these formulated thoughts is\nobviously dependent on their remaining in the periphery of con-\nsciousness,\u2014in what W. James has called the fringe of the mind.\nThe more the agent\u2019s attention is attracted by any other mental\ncontents, the better are the conditions for their acting upon the\nmind of the percipient.\nThis is illustrated also by the excellent success of the experiments\nperformed with Ilga\u2019s brother, Victor, a boy 6 years of age, as an\n\f163]\nPsychopathological Asj)ects of Telepathy 231\nagent. He transmitted to his sister simple words read and the names\nof pictures shown to him without her committing the slightest\nmistake. In Professor Neureiter\u2019s view this success is to be attri-\nbuted to the fully candid, unintentional attitude of the boy towards\nhis task, in contradistinction to the often spasmodic efforts of the\nadult.\nIlga\u2019s restriction to reproducing only the literal wording of\nthoughts to be transmitted is shown also by the following test.\nShe is playing with a picture book, while her mother, in the ad-\njoining room is told to \u201c send \u201d her the order to put the book away.\nAt the same moment the child produces the sentence. Yet she keeps\non playing, without the slightest attention to the order received.\nAnother significant clue was given by the following\nTest 20. Dr Kleinberger hides his watch under one of the many\ncushions in the room. Ilga stays in the meantime with her mother\nin the adjoining room. Whilst the mother is informed of the hiding\nplace the child enters the room saying at once :\n\u201c The watch is under\nthe cushion !\n\u201d\nYet she is far from being able to get hold of it at\nthe first attempt. She finds it only after having inspected one\ncushion after the other.\nHowever, the most\" striking of her performances were in \u201c read-\ning \u201d. She managed to read any test offered to her mother, be it\nin Lithuanian, German, French, English or Latin. The mistakes\nshe committed corresponded in every respect with those appropri-\nate to her mother\u2019s degree of education. For instance she spelled\nnumbers she came across in the French context in Lithuanian\nlanguage, she pronounced the French words phonetically in the\nLithuanian way, etc.\nProfessor Neureiter did not restrict himself to these and similar\nexperimental findings. He undertook a thoroiigh ]:>hysical and psy-\nchological examination both of the child and her parents and\nenquiry into the family history. Here he gathered that a brother\nof Ilga\u2019s mother was reported to be feeble-minded. Yet both\nparents were found normal in every respect. The father\u2019s attitude\ntowards Ilga\u2019s extraordinary faculties was rather reserved, whilst\nher mother\u2014more impulsive and ambitious by nature\u2014appeared to\nappreciate them somewhat more. Ilga\u2019s brother Victor is a well-\ndeveloped, intelligent boy, his sister Velta, 14 years, somewhat less\ngifted, pale and thin. She is backward particularly in arithmetic\nand looks embarrassed towards strangers.\nIlga, 10 years and 4 months at the time of examination, had a\nnormal upbringing ;\nno childish ailments, no fits were reported.\nYet she was backward in the control of her sphincters. Her weakest\n\f232 Hans EhremvaM, M.D. [part\npoint, liowever, was in speaking ;\nshe was hardly to be understood\neven by her family up to her eighth year of age. Then she showed a\nmarked improvement and was able to attend school from autumn\n1934 onwards. There she learnt writing fairly well, as can be seen\nfrom a specimen of her handwriting in 1. Yet she remained\ndefinitely incapable of learning to read more than a few meaningless\nletters, as already intimated in Dr Kleinberg\u2019s letter. Her \u201c super-\nnormal \u201d abilities became conspicuous about that time, yet on\nretrospection her mother recalled that as long as twm or three years\nago she became aware that she was hardly able to hide objects from\nher daughter.\nIlga\u2019s photograph as reproduced here {fig. 2) shows a child of\npeasant-like appearance, with a comparatively big skull and some-\nwhat dull facial expression. Her physical condition, particularly\nthe central nervous system, was found completely normal, as were\nthe ocidar fundi, her sight, hearing, etc. Her speech is described as\nsomewhat unwieldy, the phonation of the consonants r and s\ndeficient. Her manual skill and dexterity are fully adequate ;\nshe\nis lively and sociable, good tempered and complaisant. She answers\nquestions readily, yet in short and ]irimitive sentences. She is\nhardly likely to take the initiative in conversation or otherwise,\nher movements are rather clumsy.\nTwo of Professor Neureiter\u2019s collaborators, psychological experts,\naccomplished the child\u2019s examination by testing her by means of\nthe Binet-Bobertag and Biihler-Hetzer methods. These tests re-\nsulted in an IQ of 0.42. Her best performances were in various\nbodily actions, in dealing with materials ;\nthe lowest were in\nspeaking, which was found to correspond to a mental age of a child\nof between 3 and 4 years. (Neurologists would call her mode of\nspeaking a \u201c developmental aphasia of agrammatical type \u201d).\nThese findings led Professor Neureiter to diagnose Ilga K. as a\ncase of feeble-mindedness of considerable degree.\nSo much for his records of the case, the importance of which need\nnot be further emphasised. It is one of the rare thoroughly in-\nvestigated and well confirmed cases of telepathy, examined under\nfavourable circumstances by a trustworthy and critical observer.\nYet there may be added a few more remarks which might possibly\naccentuate still more the interest of the case.\nIn a paper ^ dealing with Neureiter\u2019s publication from a medico-\npsychological point of view I ventured to show that the classification\nof Ilga\u2019s case as a common form of feeble-mindedness needs some\n1 \u201c Brain-pathological Remarks on a Case of \u2018\nSupernormal Phenomena \u2019 \u201d\n{Zeitschrift f. d.

In such persons all intellectual capacities are usually\nfound to be equally defective\u2014although it is well known that one\nor another mental function may happen to be found developed to\nan extraordinary degree. In Ilga\u2019s case, in contrast, there was\npresent a more or less circumscribed intellectual defect, with no\nmarked impairment of the rest of her mental functions. Her com-\nplete inability to read, in contrast with her preserved faculty of\nwriting, completely dominated her picture\u2014at least from the neuro-\nlogical point of view.\nProfessor Neureiter\u2019s report points particularly to her striking\ninability to compose disjointed letters which she succeeded in\ndeciphering into syllables and. words. She was not even able to\nread her own handwriting. On the other hand this handwriting is\nfairly good, at least as far as the how of writing and the forming\nof letters is concerned. It is at any rate little worse than might be\nexpected from her age and the extent of her schooling. On closer\nscrutiny, however, there are to be found tendencies to distort and\nreverse letters, which remind the expert of mistakes characteristic\nof the writing of patients with lesions of their brains in the left\nparietal lobe. Also what we have gathered from Professor\nNeureiter\u2019s report about her speech (her slight aphasic disorders)\npoints to the same direction.\nThese clues, taken together, lead to the classification of the\ndescribed disorder as a case of so-called congenital u'ord-blindness.\nThat is a particular neurological syndrome, as first described by\nDejerine, and specially by Pringle-Morgan, Hinshelwood, and others.\nPatients of this group, althoTigh their faculty of visual recognition is\nscarcely impaired, show just the very defect found in the child.\nBoth acquired and congenital forms of word-blindness have become\nknown, and Ilga K. obviously represents nothing else than a case\nof the latter group. Thus we must realise that the case which, by\nthe routine way of testing had appeared a simple instance of im-\nbecility, is in fact to be regarded as a more or less circumscribed\nintellectual, that is to say, cerebral defect of congenital origin.\nThis suggestion, however, serves to open up a new as^^ect of\nProfessor Neureiter\u2019s observations. The development of Ilga\u2019s\n\u201c supernormal \u201d faculties\u2014her performances in telepathic reading\u2014\nin conjunction with her overriding intellectual defect, seems to be\nmore than mere coincidence.\nThis diagnostic classification of Professor Neureiter\u2019s case attracts\nattention to the striking fact that here again the child\u2019s most out-\nstanding \u201c supernormal \u201d performances seemed to correspond with\njust that order of functions which proved to be impaired by her\n\f234 Hans Ehrenwald, M.D. [part\noverriding congenital defect. On the one hand a more or less cir-\ncumscribed minus-function was present, and, on the other, a par-\nticular \u201c supernormal \u201d function which can, by analogy to the\nprevious cases, be best realised as the product of some unusual\ncompensatory tendency of the affected organism. Even the appar-\nent contradictions to this suggestion seem to point in the same\ndirection. For instance\u2014besides her predominant word-blindness\n\u2014\nthere were observed some less conspicuous aphasic di.sturbances, as\nmentioned above. Accordingly the child\u2019s \u201c supernormal \u201d per-\nformances in the wider domain of \u201c thought-reading \u201d, in the finding\nout of hidden objects without the mediation of the written word,\nremained less conspicuous. Her dexterity in this respect seemed\nto be dependent on how far the tasks were expressly formulated in\nthe experimenter\u2019s inner language, so to speak. Thus the suggested\ncorrespondence between the minus-function on the one hand, and\nthe tendency for its compensation in some \u201c supernormal \u201d way on\nthe other, seems to be indicated here as well, although to a slighter\ndegree, in as much as the child\u2019s speech-disorders were less pro-\nnounced in comparison with her prevailing difficulty in reading.\nSo far this case is yet another illustration of the general biological\nlaw of a compensatory tendency in any defective organic structure\nor mental function, as claimed particularly by Individual Psycho-\nlogy. There is, however, a very great discrepancy, if not a gulf,\nbetween the previous cases and the one under discussion. In the\ncase of dreams, of hypnosis and related states, there are to be ob-\nserved effects which come within the scope of recognised medical\nand psychopathological experience, even when they happen to\nexceed the usual ability of the subject\u2019s faculties. In the case of\nIlga K. the problem is different. There is no doubt that the child\u2019s\nobvious mental insufficiency, her circumscribed intellectual defect,\nfalls within the field of medical psychology. The compensatory\nreaction claimed for it leads on the other hand into a world where\nthere is a complete lack of evidence for any comprehensible organic\nbasis for the alleged supernormal abilities. This difficulty, it is true,\ncannot be eliminated by the present account. Yet that does not\nabsolve the scientist from his obligation to deal with it similarly to\nother problems met with in the course of his experience.\nBut even in this incomplete stage of understanding, new fight\nseems to be thrown upon certain conditions required for the origin\nof the child\u2019s \u201c supernormal \u201d manifestations. One essential con-\ndition seems to be the presence of a more or less circumscribed\nmental defect, combined with some more general lowering of mental\nactivity. On the other hand there seems to be required the presence\n\f163 ]\nPsychopathological As'jyects of Telepathy 235\nof what we might call the reactive powers of the organism, which\ncould hardly be defined more exactly without recourse to philo-\nsophical speculation. The comparison of the case of alexia due to\ncerebral sclerosis with the case of congenital origin illustrates the\nproblem in a very instructive manner. In the first instance the com-\npensatory mechanism involved an alternative weakening or strength-\nening of either tactile or optical central activities. In the second\nexample also, this alternative interaction seems to involve a source\nof energy made accessible by the given cerebral defect. Yet these\nsources are to be located, obviously, in deeper strata of the subject\u2019s\nmental activity. It is a matter of convenience to consider the\nunconscious as being the matrix of these energies. Further specula-\ntions about their mode of action seem to be premature for the time\nbeing. The main point is that such a conception seems to facilitate\nthe first approach to the problem of alleged telepathic phenomena\nfrom a \u201c normal \u201d, that is to say, a biological point of view through-\nout. At the same time it will prove an expedient working hypothesis\nfor the approach to further psychopathological problems, as will be\nshown later on.\nHowever, such a working hypothesis of the origin of telepathic\nphenomena enables us to understand more of their conditions\nonly so far as the part of the percipient is concerned. They throw\nno light upon the conditions on the part of the agent.\u2014for example.\nProfessor Neureiter as the experimenter in the case in question.\nThere is, however, one important remark to be made at this point\nin regard to his observations. At the beginning of his experiments\nhe had great initial difficulties in verifying the phenomena. Eager\nto facilitate and provoke them by his own voluntary effort, he\nsought to concentrate on the context before him, but without\nsuccess. The child remained dumb. Meanwhile, the experimenter\u2019s\nattention became diverted by a certain obsolete word in the passage\nhe was reading. At that very moment the child, unexpectedly,\nuttered the word. We know, as a matter of fact, by a number of\nsimilar experiences that the optimal condition for producing the\nreactions concerned seems to be a relaxed passive mental attitude,\nabandoning as far as possible any purposive intention.\nOn the look-out for further clues so far as the psychological\nconditions on the part of the agent are concerned, we are confronted\nwith a mass of similar observations, particularly in the formidable\nbibhography of psychical literature. It may, however, be per-\nmissible to disregard this material in this article. The present con-\nsiderations propose to deal mainly with the medico-psychological\naspects of telepathic phenomena. Thus it seems to be advisable\n\f236 Hans Ehrenwald, M.D. [part\nto restrict substantial implications to experience in the field of\nmedical and psychological research, contributed by medical and\nmedico-psychological authors.\nThere are two remarkable observations of Sigmund Freud ^ which\nmay be referred to here. The first case he reports is of a lady, 43\nyears of age, undergoing treatment for different neurotic disorders.\nHer psycho-analysis revealed a strong fixation to her father, which\nprevented her finding happiness in her marriage. She was longing\nfor children and hoped to reawaken her love for her husband by the\nroundabout way of identifying him, as the father of her children,\nwith her own father-image. As she understood that she had to\nabandon any lioj)e of having children in consequence of her hus-\nband\u2019s disease, she becanre more deeply entangled in her neurosis.\nShe was 27 years old when she turned to a \u201c fortune-teller \u201d in\nParis who, taking her for unmarried, prophesied that she would\nhave two children at the age of 32. But by the time her psycho-\nanalysis began, this ])rophecy had proved manifestly wrong : the\npatient had remained childless, and there was less hope than before\nof her having children. Yet psycho-analysis resulted, nevertheless,\nin a sur]U'ising revelation of a certain correspondence to reality\nin the fortune-teller\u2019s statement. The patient\u2019s mother was just\n32 years old when, within the shortest jmssible time, she gave birth\nto two children, having almost resigned hope of having children\nat her age. It was clear that the patient in her phantasy took the\nplace of her mother, and the fortune-teller, l)y introducing into the\n\u201c fortune \u201d told to her a circumstance relating to her mother\u2019s life,\nhit upon the daughter\u2019s most ardent secret desire. The wish to have\nchildren governed her imconscious life for years and was certainly the\noriginal cause of her falling ill just at that time. Thus the fortune-\nteller\u2019s prophecy had proved wrong, it is true, but the striking fact\nis that it disclosed precisely and in a fully adequate manner a dis-\ntinct unconscious idea in the ]:>atient\u2019s mind. It is certain that the\nfortune-teller had no normal means of understanding the significance\nto the daughter of either the reference to two children or to the\nage of 32.\nThe second observation of Professor Freud refers again to a\nfortune-teller\u2019s prophecy. This patient, a young man, fell ill at the\ntime of his beloved sister\u2019s wedding. Psycho-analysis revealed here\na strong fixation to his sister. Nevertheless, he encouraged the\nmarriage in spite of the disapproval of their parents. Now, after\nhaving undergone a first analytic treatment, the young man con-\n' Traum und Occultismus. Neve Folge der Voiiesungen iiber Psycho-analyse,\n1933.\n\f163]\nPsychopathological Aspects of Telepathy 237\nsuited a lady astrologer wlio \u201c prophesied \u201d her client\u2019s future by\nmeans of a horoscope, starting from birth-data. The young man\ngave her the birth-data of his brother-in-law, who it was foretold\nwould rlie the next July or August from poisoning l)y raw hsh or\noysters.\nNow, his brother-in-law, certaiidy, did not die at the predicted\ntime. Yet he had fallen ill in the course of the past summer, before\nthe patient consulted the astrologer, and the cause of the illness was\nin fact poisoning from raw fish and oysters. Analysis made it\nobvious that Freud\u2019s patient had not at that time overcome his\nunconscious hatred of the rival who had married his beloved sister.\nHence his repressed wish that he might have died of the poisoning.\nAccording to Freud\u2019s conjecture he might have thought ;\n\u201c The\ninclination to eat such things is a persistent one. . . . Why should\nit not occur again. . . . ?\n\u201d As there was no possibility of the\nastrologer\u2019s knowing about this insignificant detail from the life\nhistory of the brother-in-law, Freud was compelled to suggest that\nthis intelligence was to be attributed to some \u201c supernormal\n\u201d\ntelepathic means of communication with the inquirer\u2019s unconscious.\nIn this way only could the fortune-teller be supposed to have re-\nvealed to her client a certain item in his brother-in-law\u2019s biography,\nrelated in a particular way to his now repressed wishes and ex-\npectations. Thus her statements, though having no value as pro-\nphecy, succeeded in revealing certain elements of his uncon.scious\nmental life which stood in close connection to the precipitating\ncause of his neurosis.\nThere is no reason to call into question the account of such an\nauthoritative and critical investigator as Freud. There are only\ntwo possible courses, either to deny the facts\u2014or to attempt their\nexplanation on the basis of our available knowledge. Freud himself\nhas considered in his cases the possilulity of a particular effectiveness\nof repressed wishes and impulses. This activity, in his view, is wont\nto be emphasised by their particular stage of repression, by their\nobvious tendency to emerge from the unconscious into the stage of\npre-consciousness.\nThis hypothesis, though it ignores the conditions on the part of\nthe fortune-teller\u2014that is, the percipient\u2014elucidates them as they\nare to be realised on the part of the agent (that is of his client) in a\nvery informative way. And it may be added that such a hypothesis\nleads to certain suggestions as to the problem of extra-sensory per-\nception in general, such as are found in para-psychological and\npsychical literature. Similarly Helen Deutsch in a paper on\n* Imago. 1926.\n\f238 Hans Ehremvald, M.D. [part\n\u201c Occult J^Ianifestations during Psycho-analysis \u201d, states that par-\nticularly emotionally stressed processes within her own conscious-\nness appeared to have been \u201c guessed \u201d in a telepathic way by her !\npatients. These experiences, in her view, seem to confirm Freud\u2019s l\nhypothesis. Analogous observations have been published by i\nHollos, and by Dorothy Burlingham in connection with child-\n'\nanalyses, and others.\nFreud himself has pointed to the happy conditions for such j\noccurrences with children as subjects. An observation of this kind i\nwas made by the present writer in his own household. His wife\n'\nwas occupied with house-work, whilst their four and a half year old I\ndaughter Barbara was absorbed in play by her side. A few days i\npreviously his wife had answered a letter received from the U.S.A.\nand she was thinking about her friends over there, Clarence and his j\nwife Matilda. Clarence is her half-cousin, with whom she had spent !\na happy time in America a few years Irefore her wedding. Clarence !\nmarried at about the same time as she did and the letter from\nAmerica announced the birth of his second child. There was a\nphotograph of three ladies attached to the letter, one of them being\nMatilda. As she did not know her personally, she wondered which I\nof them was Clarence\u2019s wife. Just as she was thinking about this j\nphotograph, she was struck l)y the unexpected and apparently\nj\ncompletely unmotivated ejaculation of the name Matilda by the\nchild. It may be added that Barbara used to speak German at\nthat time and that she scarcely had any op]-)ortunity of meeting\nwith the name in any other version than \u201c Tildi \u201d (the name of one\nof her aunts). The child, asked the other day by the writer, whether\nshe remembered having said the name replied, \u201cYes . . . I was\nhaving a game with mummy.\u201d But on further inquiries and re-\nflexion she added that she remembered having heard Matilda as\nthe name of a cat which she had seen with friends a few months ago.\nNo further associations were to be had from her.\nIt is clear that this observation, again, does not exclude the possi-\nbility of a coincidence. Yet it is obvious that the odds for such an\nevent are enormously small, particularly when we consider that from\nBarbara\u2019s ])oint of view the English form of the name was unusual.\nSo much is known of the psychological conditions on the part of\nthe child. They revealed no sensible reason for her unexpectedly\nuttering the word. It may be added here that Barbara has never\nshown any abnormal signs ;\nthe general mental age of a child of four |\nor five years is the only justification for ascribing to her also a\ncondition of \u201c minus-function \u201d similar to that claimed for the\npercipients in the foregoing examples. How far her actual mental\n\f163] Psychopathological Aspects of Telepathy 239\nstate at the moment of transmission affected it cannot be decided\nhere.\nBut her mother gave more information, saying : \u201cNo . . . I do\nnot know Matilda. ... I only know that they have been married\nfor about the same time as we have. They have a child of about\nBarbara\u2019s age . . . and now they have got another . . . these happy\nAmericans. . . . They can afford such a luxury^ ...\u201d It would be\nredundant to continue the chain of her associations, which led to an\nidea whose strong emotional stress need not be particularly ex-\nplained. It is sufficient to intimate that she has had to resign hope\nof having another child for the time being. It is clear that the\nfrustration of this desire was likely to strengthen the emotional\nemphasis of her associations linked to the name of Matilda. This\nparticular emotional emphasis is obviously to be regarded as the\nactivating factor for the telepathic transmission of the name from\nmother to child.\nWe see that the postulate of a certain emotional stress being\nresponsible for the activity of ideas or impulses liable to telepathic\ntransmission holds true for the present case as well. It clearly shows\nthat the activating forces are to be located in the unconscious or\npre-conscious of the agent, as in the preceding instances.\nOn the other hand there are some observations of Dr William\nBrown ^ during the course of psychotherapy which show that it is\njust the attitude, as already emphasised, of a certain mental relaxa-\ntion and passivity which seems to be the psychical state required for\nthe bringing about of these phenomena. He reports the case of a\npatient to whom, during a session of treatment by suggestion, \u201c the\nvivid picture of a page of a scientific journal appeared, with two\ncolumns in the form of a letter, signed at the bottom \u201d. On re-\nflection Professor Brown realised that when glancing at a copy of\nNature his eye had been caught by one of the letters printed. He\nhanded the copy of the journal to his patient, who looked through\nit and found \u201c the identical letter \u201d. Professor Brown felt compelled\nto agree with his patient in regarding this observation as a case of\ntelepathy. He also reports a further analogous case where, in the\ncourse of a discussion of a Greek quotation, something like a tele-\npathic transmission of a distorted word occurred, belonging to a\njocular recollection of his school years, though there was no coirscious\nintention of communicating it to the friend with whom he was\ntalking.\nComparing these reports with the above-mentioned self-observa-\ntion of Professor Neureiter\n\u2014\nviz. the instance when he became an\n' Psychology and Psychotherapy. 1934.\n\f240 Hans Ehrenwald, M.D. [part\ninvoluntary \u201c agent \u201d at the very moment when he was meditating\nabout the meaning of an obsolete word\u2014there seems to be an un-\nmistakable similarity with Dr Brown\u2019s description of his own mental |\nstate during his observations. This mental state implies only ,\nseemingly a certain contradiction to the conditions suggested above\nas responsible for telepathic manifestations, that is a state of a\n'\u2022\ncertain incomplete repression or emotional emphasis of the ideas or\nimpulses concerned. It is obvious that there is one feature, common\nto both apparently contradictory mental conditions, to be taken\ninto consideration : it is the abandonment from the content of\nconscious ideas which makes them liable to extra-sensory com-\nmunication. This condition given, they seem to be particularly\nsusceptible of activity in some way or another, that is, of operating\nupon the mind of another person with a corresponding sensitiveness.\nThus the required condition for telepathic manifestations on the part\nof the agent could be appropriately described as a lack of actual\nconscious control over certain thoughts or impulses\u2014whether due\nto their particular emotional stress, linked up with their repression, ;\nor to an incidental state of jiassivity and absent-mindedness, the ;\ncloser determinants of wliich would obviously be accessible only to Hi\ndeep-psychological analysis. L\nConsidered together, both grou])s of sufficiently confirmed argu-\nments for telepathic manifestations result in the following set of\nconditions : ( 1 )\na more or less circumscribed minus-function on the\npart of the percipient, linked up (2) with an adequately preserved\nfaculty for compensatory reaction of his organism. Where these two\nconditions are sufficiently pronounced, no \u201c supernormal \u201d faculties\nseem to be required on the part of the agent. (As a model case of\nthis kind we may quote the relation Ijetween Professor Neureiter\nand his sul)ject, or Professor Brown and his patient.) (3) In the\ncase of an absent or scarcely discernible minus-function on the part\nof the percipient, a more or less emphasised plus-function on the\npart of the agent seems to be necessary. That is an emotionally\nstressed idea or impulse as in Freud\u2019s two cases\u2014or at least an inci-\ndental lack of conscious control of certain ideas, with their resulting\nunconscious activation.\nThe main instances given, however, represent extreme cases,\nseldom to be met with in practice. In the majority of spontaneous\nor experimental telepathic manifestations all three groups of con-\nditions may be involved with the alternative of either one or another\ngroup of conditions prevailing. Accordingly there may exist a par-\nticular coincidence of conditions, present in both the percipient\nand the agent. This coincidence may represent the most favourable\n\f163] Psychopathological Aspects of Telepathy 241\nconstellation for producing the phenomena, though, of course, it is\nonly rarely to be found in practice. Usually we may have only one\nor the other of the suggested conditions, with, consequently, only\nan occasional occurrence of the phenomena. Further, there may\nexist a minus-function, yet without an appropriate reactive power\nof the organism\u2014as in the case of the patient with cerebral sclerosis\n\u2014moreover with no appropriate \u201c agent \u201d available. Finally there\nmay arise the condition of an adequate mental or bodily reactive\npower and general fitness, yet without the postulated minus-\nfunction\u2014as in the normal individual. Considering the obvious\nrareness of a simultaneous coincidence of all these conditions, the\nrelative rareness of sufficiently well-attested \u201c genuine \u201d obser-\nvations of this kind needs no further explanation. The same re-\nflexions explain the difficulties of deliberately producing them, e.y.\nunder laboratory conditions.\nThese considerations, it is true, suggest a reading only of the\npsychological conditions of the phenomena. They yield no infor-\nmation about the corresponding physiological processes. Yet this\nquestion seems to be in no way more transcendental than the\nquestion of the bodily correlates of \u201c normal \u201d psychical phenomena.\nBut this question falls rather within the province of philosophy,\nand thus there is reason to deal with it in the present connection.\nFrom a merely descriptive, psychological point of view it simply\nconfronts us with a particular issue of psycho-physical correlations,\nviz. with the fact of an immediate \u201c extra-sensory \u201d communication\nbetween two individuals or \u201c minds \u201d\n\u2014as telepathy was originally\ndefined by F. W. H. Myers. The scientist, once convinced of the\nintegrity of the e\\ddence, is simply compelled to acknowledge\nthis group of experiences, to eliminate any quasi-scientific flavour\nas far as possible and to try to reconcile it with his previous\nknowledge.\nYet scarcely have the difficulties of a first scientific approach been\novercome, when a further and no less considerable obstacle seems\nto arise. Both common sense and scientific thinking obstinately\nrefuse to acknowledge facts of this kind. A. Carrel, in his book\nMan the Unknown, is right when he points to the fundamental ten-\ndency of our minds to reject the things that do not fit into the frame\nof the scientific and philosophical beliefs of our time, so that\nscientists are willing to declare that things which cannot be explained\nby current theories do not exist at all. This attitude, well known in\nvarious fields of research, is common to both the general public and\nthe research-worker and seems to be particularly emphasised in the\nfield of so-called supernormal phenomena. It has certainly been the\n\f242 Hans Ehremvald, M.D. [part\nmost serious obstacle up to the present to their systematic explora- !\ntion, and, it may be admitted here, an initial scepticism and distrust ;\nhave for a long time hampered the present author in drawing the\nappropriate conclusions from his own occasional experiences in this\ndirection both in everyday life and in the field of psychotherapy.\nBut he can refer to no less an authority than Sigmund Freud, whose\nreluctance in acknowledging and dealing seriously with his two\nobservations, quoted above, lasted as long as ten years \u201c for fear\nof our scientific world-view being menaced by them \u201d, as he con-\nfessed. This fear may be understood by another statement, reported\nof a no less distinguished scientist, the physicist Helmholtz ;\n\u201c Neither the testimony of all the Fellows of the Boyal Society nor\neven the evidence of my own senses could lead me to believe in the |\ntransmission of thoughts from one person to another independently i\ni\nof the recognised channels of sensation. . .\n.\u201d And Helmholtz has r\nhis counterpart in the late Lord Kelvin, who attributed all such i\naccounts \u201c to bad observation chiefiy, mixed up . . . with the\n^\neffects of wilful imposture.\u201d |\nIn one of his latest papers the well-known German psychiatrist,\nW. Weygandt ^ has advocated a similar ol)stinate attitude. He cites\nNeureitcr\u2019s case in the bibliography of his article, but anxiously\navoids dealing with it in its context\u2014or is his omission only to be\nattributed to a significant faulty action of the well-known kind ?\nPsycho-analysis has coined the term scotoynisation for this attitude.\nScotomisation is the Iminging about of something like a \u201c blind spot\n\u201d\nin the mind\u2019s eye which facilitates the disregarding and repression\nof undesired mental contents l)y the unconscious.\nYet even the psycho-analyst H. Hitschmann^ in his paper\nTelepathy and Psychoanalysis declared some fifteen years ago that\nit is \u201c unpleasant \u201d to see the facts of physics and physiology go\nl)y the l)oard through the evidence for telepathy, which as a matter\nof fact he uncompromisingly reiected. He pointed out how deeply\nthe disposition to primitive ideas is rooted in the human mind, and\nsuggests that the narcissistic teiulency to ascribe to oneself \u201c super-\nnormal \u201d faculties corresponds to the infantile craving to possess\nomnipotence of thought, a faculty of acting at distance, and the\nlike, as found alike in the child, the savage, and the insane. Thus\nall alleged observations in this line are, in his view, purely mental\nsubjective ones, products of man\u2019s wishful thinking, of weakness of i\nintellect, which makes him cling to the mystical interpretation of his jt\n* \u201c Der Occiilti.smus, seine Grundlagen ii.

We have seen that even the expert\nmay be misled by the same, error he is used to revealing by deep-\npsychology. There is no doubt that such an attitude is far from\nbeing merely rational. Here reason seems to be fighting for her own\nsake with forces drawn from deeper levels of mental activity, thus\njeopardising her primordial aims.\nWe have emphasised that a certain impairment of the purely\nrational attitude of consciousness, a certain \u201c minus-function \u201d of\nmind, has been found to be one of the essential conditions for the\norigin of telepathic phenomena. Accordingly any realisation in\npractice of these conditions is diametrically opposed to man\u2019s ele-\nmentary intellectual striving. It implies a relapse to the stage of\nanimism and magic, a regression to a superseded, primitive level\nof our thinking and reasoning, with the interdicted return of and\nreturn to the repressed, in the sense of Freud.\nThus we have good reason for admitting the justification of the\nmodern man\u2019s uncompromising rationalistic and over-rationalistic\nclaims. There is no doubt that the preservation of his present stage\nof mentality, of his recent level of consciousness, so hardly achieved\nin the course of his individual and racial development, is indispen-\nsable to his position in nature and even to his mental normality. Any\nrelapse from this stage means a re-emerging of his prehistorical past,\na menace to all the moral and intellectual achievements of the\npresent. That is the reason why we find both human nature and the\nattitude of community equipped with powerful protective measures\nagainst such an event. It is the natural trend of the individual\u2019s\nmental constitution that works against the occurrence of \u201c super-\nnormal \u201d phenomena. Hence their outlawed position, so to speak,\ntheir comparative rareness, their frequent association with twilight\nstates between normality and mental illness, or even insanity\u2014as I\npropose to show elsewhere. On the other hand it is with a fully\npurposive resolution that human society opposes any acceptance of\ntheir possible occurrence. Society protects itself in case of need by\nallowing them to be explained away by its scientists, or simply by\nmeans of a social act of scotomisation, when facing this special field\nof experience.\n\f244 Hans Ehremvald, 31.D. [part 163]\nThus we become aware that any psychopathological reading of I\ntelepathic phenomena has to reckon not only with the revealed facts i\nbut also with the ambiguous reactions of their observers to the facts\nrevealed. Only after clearing away our deeply rooted prejudices\n\u2014\nafter getting rid of our scientific scotoma\u2014can we begin their truly\nrational psychological exploration, unhampered by unconscious\nmental reservations and inhibitions. It is clear, however, that no\nless care is to be taken to avoid the temptation\u2014a very real one,\nas deep-psychology has revealed\u2014of slipping into the opposite .\nextreme, no less dangerous for any scientific progress.\nThere is no doubt that such a resohite yet cautious approach as\nsuggested here would enable psychopathology to submit the problem\nof the alleged supernormal phenomena to a new critical considera-\ntion and, possibly, to revise to a certain extent its attitude to them.\nThe importance of such an issue for a further advance of the fron-\ntiers of psychology and of our present scientific outlook in general\nneed not be further emphasised.\n\fTHE ISOLATION OF THE PERCIPIENT IN TESTS FOR\nEXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTION\nBy Geoffrey Redmayne\nSalute Parnassus! Let the climber jind\nTrue solitude upon the lonely peak,\nAndfrom his point of isolation seek\nThe ultimate horizons of the mind.\nIntroduction\nIn the recognised tests for extra-sensory perception, such as the\ntests employed by the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory or the in-\ngenious mechanical apparatus devised by Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell, it is\nnecessary that there should be an operator. In the case of tests for\nprecognition and for clairvoyance it is for consideration whether the\nresults obtained by the percipient may not be inadvertently influ-\nenced by that operator\u2014even in cases where the latter may have\nno normal means of acquiring knowledge which might be of use to\nthe percipient. If a test for clairvoyance is in progress, the operator\nmay himself acquire the requisite knowledge by clairvoyance (or by\nnormal means) and then transmit that knowledge telepathically to\nthe percipient, so that it is difficult to claim that the ultimate\nresult is indicative of \u201c pure clairvoyance \u201d ;\nsimilar considerations\napply in the case of tests for precognition, except that the acquisi-\ntion of knowdedge by normal means is excluded. Again, the operator\nmay disturb the course of an experiment by the telepathic trans-\nmission of subconscious preferences\u2014quite independently of whether\nhe has any knowledge of value to the percipient.\nIn order that the percipient may be isolated from the possibility\nof such undue influence, it is suggested that the normal duties of\nthe operator should be undertaken as part of the functions of a form\nof automaton, the actions of which, within the desired limits, are\ndesigned to he incalculable by normal means.\nIf such an automaton is to be effective it must be capable of\nselecting numbers or symbols at intervals in a truly random se-\nquence, and recording all calls and successes made by the percipient.\nFurthermore, as it is to usurp the functions of an operator, it must\n245\n\f246 Geoffrey Redmayne [part\nhold, as it were, a \u201c watching brief\u201d for the operator and give an\nindication if, on any occasion, the chance factor should be altered\nby inadmissible action on the part of the percipient. Apparatus\ndesigned with the above requirements in view, and suitable for tests\nfor clairvoyance and precognition, is here described.\nSpecification of the Mechanism\nThe machine, details of which are shown in the accompanying\nphotograph and diagram, has the following characteristics :\n1. A motor-driven rotary selector, adapted to select one of five\ncircuits, has five vanes mounted at equal intervals on the periphery.\nThis selector can lie locked in one of five positions by a magnetically\noperated brake which will make positive contact with one of the\nfive vanes.\n2. Means for ensuring that the selector will be stopped in an\n\u201c incalculable \u201d ]iosition. This is achieved by the following methods\nwhich are supjilementary to one another in the case of tests for\nclairvoyance ;\nin tests for precognition, the second method only is\nused.\n{a) Variation of the time interval.\nA thermal delay switch is so arranged that it will cause the brake\nto go \u201con\u201d, and then \u201coff\u201d, at uncertain intervals. The switch\nis of the type used for safeguarding smoothing condensers from the\npeak voltages which arise when power is applied to the anodes of\nindirectly-heateil valves before the latter are sufficiently heated to\nhave cathode emission. The normal delay of such switches is gener-\nally over 30 seconds, but the model chosen can be adjusted so that\nthe delay is one of approximately five seconds for each interval. In\npractice it is found that the switch has an erratic action when\nadapted for the present purposes, and on this account it is thought\nto be mechanically suitable for controlling the time interval. While\nsome ])erci])ients will not object to the length of interval, others will\nconsider it to be unduly long, and it is realised that there is likely\nto be adverse criticism on this score. Consequently it would be\nadvantageous if arrangements could be made for the time interval\nto lie varied to suit the percipient, and this is a matter which will\nreceive consideration.\n(b) Variation of the speed of the selector.\nVariation in speed is attained by the use of an automatically\nvariable resistance in the circuit of the electric motor which drives\nthe selector. A rotary switch blade is continuously driven by the\n\fPLATE II\n\f\fPA.NE.\nL\nP\nta.ci\nPie.\nNT's\n&'*mTclH\nboo-a-D\n163]\n247\nThe Isolation of the Percipient (E.S.P.)\nCircuit\nDiagram\nfor\nE.S.P.\nApparatus\n\f248 Geoffrey Redmayne [part\nelectric motor at a speed of approximately 4 r.p.m., and the switch j\nblade, in the course of each revolution, makes four changes in the\nresistance of the motor circuit ; consequently the selector is fre-\nquently in a state of either acceleration or deceleration. I\n(Originally an entirely different method of varying the speed of\n|\nthe selector was employed, the time intervals being constant. Use )\nwas made of the variation in resistance set up between iron filings !\nwlien they are mechanically agitated while retained in a strong |\nmagnetic field. This variation in resistance affected the operation !\nof a supplementary magnetically operated brake which was capable\nof retarding, but not stopping, the selector. For some reason,\nprobably faulty design, the device caused the selector to choose\nnumbers in a sequence which, on analysis, did not prove to be truly\nrandom ;\nit was only with great reluctance that the device was finally i\nabandoned, as it was unusually picturesque in its action and, from\nthe theoretical standpoint, had much to commend it.)\n3. A switch box upon which are mounted five press switches for\nthe use of the percipient, and i\n(rt) for use in tests for claii\u2019voyance, an indicating bulb which\nshows when the machine is ready to receive a call, and i\n(6) for use in tests for precognition, a plunger which the per- !\ncipient mirst press after making each call, and a meter i\nwhich will inform him whether he has manipulated the\nplunger correctly. i\nThe switch box contains suitable devices for the prevention of |\ninadmissible calls ;\nthese are described later. j\n4. An automatic recorder which indicates each call and registers\neach success on a circular paper disc ;\naural indication is given\nwhenever a success is scored. Each disc is designed to register\n50 calls.\nProcedure in Tests for Clairvoyance ;\nt\nThe percipient scores a success if, when the selector has chosen a i\ncircuit, he presses a switch which is connected in that circuit.\nA switch may lie pressed at any time when the bulb on the switch\nbox is glowing. The bulb will be \u201c on \u201d for about five seconds and\nthen go \u201c off \u201d for about five seconds while the selector is choosing\nanother circuit.\n\f163]\nThe lsolatio7i of the Percipie^it {E.S.P.) 249\nProcedure in Tests for Precognition\nA simple system of switches enables the circuit to be altered so\nas to be suitable for testing precognitive faculties. In this case the\nselector is rotating continuously except for a momentary period\nafter the percipient has chosen a circuit. Almost immediately after\na switch has been pressed down to its fullest extent an automatic\nswitch on the call recorder will close the magnetic brake circuit and\nthe selector will suddenly stop ;\nif the percipient had chosen a\ncircuit which the selector was about to choose, a success will be\nrecorded. When a call has been made, a pointer will appear on the\ndial of the meter ;\nthis is a warning that the plunger on the switch\nbox must be pressed for approximately tw'o seconds in order to\nallow the selector to rotate a sufficient number of times before an-\nother call is made. If the plunger is operated correctly the pointer\nwill no longer be in evidence when the plunger is released, but if\nthe plunger is released too soon the pointer will appear again.\nPrevention of Inadmissible Calls\nThe most complicated part of the apparatus is that which is con-\ncerned with the prevention of inadmissible calls. It would seem\nthat there are three types of erroneous calls against which provision\nmust be made :\n(a) The percipient presses two or more switches at the same time,\nand thus increases his chance of a successful score.\n{b) In tests for clairvoyance, the percipient makes more than one\ncall during the period when the selector is stationary.\n(c) In tests for precognition, the percipient makes calls with such\nrapidity that the selector does not rotate sufficiently be-\ntween each call.\nIn order to ensur'e that the percipient cannot score a success if he\npresses two or more switches at the same time, use is made of cer-\ntain trip-mechanism which is capable of preventing any further\nrotation of the selector. All the switches are connected through a\nrelay to the trip-mechanism so that one switch cannot alone operate\nthe trip-mechanism, but so that two or more switches can operate\nit. This has been arranged by coupling all the press switches to a\nrelay through 20 ohm resistances, the relay being adjusted so that it\nwill not operate with 20 ohms resistance in circuit, but will operate\nwith 10 ohms resistance in circuit. Thus, if one switch is pressed.\n\f250 Geoffrey Reclmayne [part\nthe resistance in the relay circuit will be 20 ohms and the relay will i\nnot be affected ;\nbut, if two or more smtches are pressed at the\nsame time, the resistance will be loweretl to 10 ohms or less and the\nrelay will immediately affect the trip-mechanism on the selector :\npanel, with the result that the selector will not be able to rotate\nagain until the trip-mechanism has been re-set.\nThe trip-mechanism will also be affected if, in tests for precogni-\ntion, the percipient should attempt to make calls at intervals of less i\nthan about two seconds. The tri])-mechanism relay is in circuit\nwith a device which is similar in many res]:)ects to the vibrator\nassembly of a full-wave vibrating reed rectifier, but the vibrations\nof the reed are utilised for an entirely different purpose. Details of\nthe device are as follows :\nAn iron reed is suspended between two electro-magnets. One of\nthe magnets is in parallel with the call recorder and so is energised i\ni\nonly at the time during which the percipient presses a switch ;\nthe\nother and less powerful magnet is continuously energised, except at\nthe time when the percipient jjresses the plunger on the switch box.\nThe latter magnet cannot attract the reed unless the reed swings ;\nover to it on being released l)y the more powerful magnet. When\nthe plunger on the switch box is jjressed, the less 2\n)owerful magnet j\nwill release the reed, but the vibrations of the reed will cause it to ,\ncome frequently within the previous sphere of influence of the I\nmagnet for a period which is dejrendent on the fundamental tuning\nof the reed. It will be evident, then, that should the ^hunger be\nreleased before the viI)rations of the reetl have died down the reed\nwill again be attracted to the magnet. If the percipient should\nattempt to make a call at a time when the reed is attracted to the\nmagnet, the tri]i-mechanism on the selector jjanel will operate\nbecause the resistance in the relay circuit will have been lowered to\n10 ohms {i.e. one of the 20 ohm switch resistances, in jrarallel with\nthe 20 ohm resistance in circuit with the vibrator). The meter on '\nthe switch box will inform the jiercipient whether or not he may\nsafely make a call.\nThe same device is also used in tests for clairvoyance for the pur-\n])ose of preventing the percipient from making more than one call\nduring the period when the selector is stationary. In such tests the\nless powerful magnet is connected to an automatic switch on the '\nmagnetically operated brake so that the reed is automatically\nreleased whenever the selector starts to rotate ;\nconsequently the\nvibrations of the reed do not serve any useful purjjose, and the\nperci|)ient is not concerned either with the ^ilunger or with the\nmeter on the switch box.\n\f163]\nThe Isolation of the Percipient (E.S.P.) 251\nIf, in tests for clairvoyance, the percipient should press a switch\nwhile the selector is rotating, the trip-mechanism will terminate the\nexperiment. This, while being desirable, was not intended to be a\nfeature of the design, and the reason for it did not immediately\nbecome apparent. Further study, however, made it clear that the\nmachine had not acquired some of the characteristics of a monster\nof Frankenstein.\nIt is not thought that a percipient could overcome the limitations\nimposed by the above-mentioned devices, as steps have been taken\nto ensure that the percipient cannot usefully interfere with the\nvibrator assembly by magnetic or other means. In the absence of\nany contra-indication, therefore, it will be assumed that adequate\nprecautions have been taken.\nIt will be evident that if the apparatus, with the exception of the\nswitch box, is placed beyond the reach of the percipient, he can be\nleft entirely alone while he makes each series of 50 calls. The\nobjection may be raised, however, that the percipient is not com-\npletely isolated because it is still desirable that there should be an\noperator to exercise a general supervision over the apparatus and\nchange the record disc after each series of 50 calls. The only super-\nvision required, however, is that of the engineer in charge of mach-\ninery whose duties are limited to maintenance ;\nhe is not concerned\nwith the quality of the work which is performed with the aid of that\nmachinery, nor is he indeed cognisant of it during each series of\ncalls. It is claimed, therefore, that the percipient is no longer\nsubject to undue influence and that, from this point of view, he is\nvirtually, in the words of the Ancient Mariner,\n\u201c Alone, alone, all, all alone.\nAlone on a wide, wide sea!\n\u201d\nAnalysis of Alleged Random Numbers\nThe Research Officer has very kindly made an analysis of a series\nof circuits which were chosen by the selector at a time when the\napparatus was adjusted for the testing of the clairvoyant faculty ;\nfor this analysis (and for the photograph) my thanks are due to the\nSociety. The report is as follows :\n\u201c Tests for Randomness applied to 1000 Numbers produced\nBY THE ilpPARATUS WHEN WORKING ON THE PRINCIPLE OF\nThermal Delay\nThe frequencies of the 5 digits are 177, 211, 222, 190 and 200,\nthe expectation being 200. The value of y- is found to be 5-67, with\n\f2.52 Geoffrey Redmayne [part\n4 degrees of freedom. This corresponds to a value of P of more\nthan 0-2, which is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that the\nnumbers are random.\nIf we consider the series to be made up of 1000 pairs of digits,\nthe first pair being the 1st and 2nd digits, the second pair being\nthe 2nd and 3rd digits, and the 1000th pair being the 1000th and 1st\ndigits, we can count the frequencies of the 25 possible pairs and\nenter them in the cells of a table, as follows ;\nFrequencies of the 25 Pairs\nSecond digit of pair Total\n1 2 3 4 5\nu-i\n1 31 45 47 25 29 177\nct\nPh\nO\n2 39 46 13 45 38 211\n*3j 3 35 43 45 43 56 222\nrn\nw.\ns\n4 3f) 41 43 30 40 190\n5 36 36 44 47 37 200\nTotal .\n177 211 222 1 90 200 1000\nThe expectation for each cell is 1000\/25 = 40.

The value of P is about\n0-1, which, though a trifle low, is not inconsistent with the hypo-\nthesis of randomness.\u201d\nPortability of the Apparatus\nCare has been taken to make the apparatus as compact as possible\nin order that it may be readily portable. The whole apparatus,\nincluding accumulators, can be fitted into an attache case measur-\n\f254 Geoffrey Redmayne [part\ning 17i\" X 10\" X 5V, but normally a case with special fittings meas-\nuring 20i\" X 12\" X 6|\" is used. Weight, including larger case and\naccumulators, is 16 lbs.\nProvision for Stimulus\nThe recorder is provided with terminals to which may be attached\na Ruhmkorff Coil for the purpose of giving the percipient a stimulus\nautomatically whenever he scores a success. If the percipient is\nattempting to make a high score, then the coil should be adjusted\nso that the percipient feels no more than a tingling sensation in the\nhands. If the attempt is for a low score, then the shock may be\nincreased, but care has to be taken not to make the shock so great\nthat fear is produced, otherwise the paranormal faculty may be\ninhibited. The coil will probaldy give most assistance in cases where\nit is desired to obtain a significantly low score.\nProposed Developments\nIt is thought that it would materially add to the value of the\napparatus if it were to be provided with certain adaptors which could\nbe plugged into the selector panel. Progress has already been made\nwith designs for ancillary devices which give visual and olfactory\nindications of the circuits chosen by the selector.\nIn the case of visual indication, it is considered that it might be\nhelpful to a percipient if, before making a call, he were able to con-\ncentrate upon the actual surface upon which a symbol is about to\nappear. This is to be arranged by optical means\u2014five miniature\nepidiascopes adapted to throw Zener symbols, in random sequence,\nupon the back of a translucent screen.\nOlfactory indication presents certain difficulties, chief amongst\nwhich is the design of suitable stopcocks which can be operated by\nthe selector through relays. An attempt is being made to adapt\nan Ether-\u201c gas-oxygen \u201d apparatus (as used for general ansesthesia)\nso that various aromas are delivered to the percipient through the\nusual facepiece. Compressed air is to be used both as a vehicle for\nthe aromas and as a scavenger during the intervals. For the purpose\nof loading the vehicle it is proposed to make use of a special device\nwhich has lieen ^^rimarily designed for the effective control of the\nchloroform content of anaesthetizing gases, but which will be par-\nticularly suitable for the present purposes. Details cannot yet be\npublished, as the device in its application to anaesthesia may eventu-\nally form the subject-matter of Letters Patent.\n\f163 ]\nThe Isolation of the Percipient (E.S.P.) 255\nIt would seem that both the above adaptors will be more suitable\nfor experiments in precognition than in pure clairvoyance. Details\nof suitable recorder and associated circuits have not yet been worked\nout, but these are matters which must wait upon the completion of\nthe adaptors.\nThere may be those who think that the proposed adaptors are an\nunnecessary complication and that a solution to the problem of the\nparanormal faculty will be found along more conventional lines.\nBut it may well be that the means whereby we eventually attain\nthis particular Northwest Passage would not readily be accepted as\na reasonable basis for experiment by the orthodox opinion of the\npresent day.\n\fON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA OF CERTAIN\nEXPERIMENTS IN PARANORMAL COGNITION\nBy W. L. Stevens.\nWhately Carington reports in Nature (and later in the S.P.R.\nProceedings) that, in a series of experiments conducted at Cam-\nbridge, \u201c percipients scored significantly more resemblances on\noriginals of experiments in which they were working, as compared\nwith the originals of the experiments in which they were not work-\ning, than would be expected on the null hypothesis that there is only\na chance connection between the originals used and the drawings\nproduced (P<0-0001).\u201d\nThere is no reasonable doubt that the null hypothesis which\nWhately Carington chooses to test (and of which the above is not a\nvery accurate description) has been successfully disproved, but it\nwould be unfortunate if his readers were left under any misappre-\nhension as to the exact nature of the evidence which this supplies for\ntelepathy or clairvoyance.\nThe work consisted of a series of five separate experiments, in each\nof which drawings were \u201c exposed \u201d consecutively while subjects\n(who generally each participated in only one experiment) drew\n\u201c what they liked \u201d. Their drawings were then scored against all\nthe originals, and the 1,209 resemblances recognised by the judges\ncan be distributed in a five-by-five contingency table according to\nthe numbers of the experiments, in which the original was exposed,\nand in which the drawing was made. Table I of Whately Caring-\nton\u2019s Proceedings paper reads :\nHits by Drawings made in Experiment\nOn the\nOriginals I 11 III IV V\nof Expt.\nI 81 10 9 53 33 186\n11 12.5 26 11 76 44 282\nIII 61 15 9 66 52 203\nIV 43 11 7 58 33 1.52\nV 109 24 14 133 106 386\n419\n\u2022\n86 50 386 268 1,209\n256\n\f[part 163] Certain Experiments in Paranormal Cognition 257\nTaking as the null hypothesis that each \u201c hit \u201d enters this table\nindependently, subject only to the restrictions imposed by the fixed\nmarginal totals, Whately Carington tests the total of entries in the\nleading diagonal (Stevens, 1938 or 1939) and shows that it exceeds\nexpectation by an amount which is highly significant. Disproof\nof a null hypothesis does not, however, automatically estabhsh the\ntruth of any other hypothesis which the experimenter might have\nhad in mind when he did the work, and so we must examine more\nclosely the evidence which this supphes for telepathy.\nStated more fully, the null hypothesis is that the probability that\na hit, made in any experiment, is made on an original of any par-\nticular experiment, is independent, not only of the experiment in\nwhich the drawing was made, but also of any other hits scored.\nThis null hypothesis might be wrong for a variety of reasons.\nOne obvious possibility is that subjects may tend to have favourite\ndrawing topics, or, to put it another way, that the things I draw may\ntend to resemble each other more than they resemble the things you\ndraw. To take a very extreme example ;\nsuppose a subject draws\na horse on the ten consecutive nights of his experiment. Then\naccording to whether a drawing of a horse was or was not exposed,\nhe scores zero or ten, and in the latter case\u2014this is the essential\npoint\u2014all ten hits must fall en bloc into the one appropriate cell of\nthe contingency table. This contradicts the null hypothesis that\nhis ten hits distribute themselves, in the appropriate column of the\ntable, independently of each other. Of course, nothing so extreme\nas this happened, nor indeed need one suppose that there was\nexcessive duplication of drawings. The definition of \u201c resemblance\n\u201d\nbeing that used by the judge who scored the drawings, then the null\nhypothesis would be invalidated if two drawings made by the same\nperson are more hkely to \u201c resemble \u201d each other than are two\ndrawings made by different persons.\nTo test whether the contingency table shows deviations from\nindependence, we can follow the usual procedure. For the whole\ntable, of sixteen degrees of freedom, is 41-7, which is less probable\nthan one in a thousand. The hypothesis of independence can\nreasonably be held to be disproved.\nThis leaves open the question of what explanation, if any, we are\nto give. I have already suggested one, without in any sense claiming\nthat this is the true explanation (for I have not seen the original\ndrawings). Whately Carington would say it was due to telepathy.\nOthers might maintain that it was the work of.the devil. The point\nis that, so far, it is purely a matter of personal taste which explana-\nQ\n\fW. L. Stevens\n258 [part\ntion we choose to adopt, if any, since their effects on the criterion\nwe have used are indistinguishable.\nIt is however possible to construct other tests to discriminate 1\nbetween effects of the kind I have suggested and telepathy. If on i,\nthe telepathy hypothesis we thought it likely that the data should :\ndeviate from independence in a particular way, and if in fact we\ncould show that the data did deviate in this way and not in other\ntvmjs, then we should be in possession of good evidence for telepathy.\nNow it is a reasonable supposition that a subject picks up telepathic\nideas of the drawings of the experiment in which he particijDates, and\nnot of the drawings of the four experiments in which he does not\nparticipate. Expectations in the cells of the leading diagonal of\nthe contingency table would thus be enhanced, and it is therefore\npertinent to test whether the total of the entries in the leading\nfliagonal significantly exceed expectation, on the null hypothesis, i\nWhatever his reasons might have been, this is what Whately Caring-\nton does, and he finds a highly significant excess.\nThis does not complete the evidence, for such a significant excess !\nmight well be due to effects of the kind I have suggested. Of |\ncourse, my tentative explanation \\vould not imply increased expecta-\ntions on the leading diagonal ;\nit would however mean that the\ndiagonal total has a bigger variance than that deduced from the\nnull hypothesis, so that \u201c significant \u201d results in either direction\n(in this case it is the right direction for telepathy) would arise more\nfrequently than indicated by their theoretical significance levels.\nTo complete the evidence it is therefore necessary to go further, and\nshow that not only does the contingency table deviate from inde-\npendence in the jjarticular way which would be ascribable to tele-\njiathy, but also that, if we accept the telepathic hyj^othesis as a new\nnull hypothesis, the data become such as could reasonably have i\narisen, i.e. that they no longer show deviations, which require i\nexplanation in terms other than telepathy. j\nThis can be tested. Tele])athy is to account for the excess on\nj\nthe leading diagonal. Let us therefore obliterate from the data ]\nthe 280 hits in the leading diagonal, and test whether the remaining\ndata are independent ;\ni.e. let us distribute the remaining 929 hits\n|\nover the remaining twenty cells so that, if the expectations in any 1\nfour of the twenty cells lying at the corners of a rectangle are '\nm. . . . m.o\nW3. . .\nthen = nio'in^.\n\f163 ]\nCertain Experiments in Paranormal Cognition 259\nWhen this has been done calculated in the usual way from the\ndiscrepancies between data and expectations, yields 24-20 for eleven\ndegrees of freedom, which is practically on the one per cent, signi-\nficance level.\nWhile not a very startling level of significance, it should be enough\nto make any scientist very shy of accepting the telepathy hypothesis.\nOf course, if one takes the \\dew that any explanation other than\ntelepathy is rather fantastic, one could tolerate such an improbable\nresult. Otherwise one is forced to the conclusion that telepathy\ndoes not adequately explain the peculiarities of the data, and that\ntherefore there must be some \u201c natural \u201d explanation of the kind\nI suggest. At this point, I must again stress that my criticism does\nnot rest on the one alternative explanation which I have put forward\nby way of illustration, but on the demonstrated fact that the null\nhypothesis is contradicted even in regions of the contingency table,\nwhere telepathy cannot be, or at least has not yet been, invoked as\nan explanation. There is therefore another explanation, and one\nis obliged to seek it out. This explanation, whatever it may be,\ninvalidates the null hypothesis, and therefore invalidates the test\nof significance for the leading diagonal total.\nWhately Carington may indeed reply that he had no right to\nassume that telepathy should give rise only to the particular effect\nhe was looking for, when he tested the diagonal total. This is\nfair enough, but it means abandoning the diagonal total test,\nand basing conclusions on the result of the comprehensive test of\nindependence of the contingency table. The mode of operation of\ntelepathy or clairvoyance, needed to account for the observed de-\nviations from independence, would then indeed be very curious,\nthough that is beside the point, for the preference for such an\nexplanation over possible alternatives would then, in any case,\nbe arbitrary.\nIn conclusion, I must say that I believe that if I had been per-\nmitted to examine the original material, I should have been able\nto discover the natural explanation of the phenomenon.\nThe Galton Laboratory,\nRothamsted Experimental Station,\nHarpenden, Herts.\nReferences\nW.

The test itself does depend on the kind of independence\nMr Stevens discusses ;\nbut this is not part of the hypothesis, for there\nmight be this independence and yet the effects not due to chance,\nor a measure of dependence and yet no more than chance at work.\nIn developing the argument Mr Stevens goes on to enunciate at\nleast one demonstrably false proposition. He says (para. 5),\n\u201c the\nthings I draw may resemble each other more than they resemble\nthe things you draw,\u201d and later \u201c . . . the null h\\^othesis would be\ninvalidated if two drawings made by the same person are more\nlikely to \u2018\nresemble \u2019\neach other than are two drawings made by\ndifferent persons \u201d. Even allowing for the fact that by \u2018\nnull\nhypothesis \u2019\nMr Stevens means \u201c methodological assumption \u201d, this\nproposition is simply not true. If you make ten drawings,\nA, B . . . I, J very skilfully in red ink and the cubist style, while\nI make ten different drawings Q, R . . . Y, Z very badly in green\nink and the vorticist style, there are at least three respects in which\neach of yours is more like the others of yours than it is like any of\nmine, and vice versa. But, since, ex hypothesi, all 20 drawings are\ndifferent, the hits scored (if any) will all be on different originals\nand will therefore be independent in Mr Stevens\u2019s sense. As a\nmatter of fact, Mr Stevens does not define what he means by\n\u201c dependent \u201d and \u201c independent \u201d in this context ;\nbut I take it\nthat \u201c dependence \u201d involves some factor tending to cause a perci-\npient who has been credited with one hit on a given original to be\nfurther credited with another hit on the same original. The point\n261\n\f262 Wha tely Carington [part\nis of some importance, for whereas there are more ways than one\nin which tins might occur (obsession, practical joking, forgetfulness\non the part of the percipient, or aberrations on the part of the judge)\nthe result would always be the same, namely replication of hits on\nthe same original from a single set of drawings. Thus the somewhat\ndamaging suggestion in the opening sentences of paragraph 5, to\nthe effect that though Mr Stevens has only pointed out one source\nof error there may be others left undetected, is erroneous.\nIn short, the perfectly good point that Mr Stevens is trying to\nmake is that we should not allow any one set of drawings to score\nmore than one hit on the same original. If we do, then the result\nis mathematically indistinguishable from a plurality of percipients\nindependently scoring one hit each ;\nand this, in whichever direction\nit operated, would be misleading.\nThis is 100 per cent, sound criticism, and I wish I had thought of\nit myself. Fortunately, the reniedy is simple\n\u2014\u201c dereplication \u201d, if\nI may coin a word\u2014and the same in all cases regardless of the\nsource of the error, while the effect, as might be expected, is small.\nIn the case of the \u201c Hindson All Entries \u201d data quoted by Mr\nStevens, elimination of replicate hits reduces the value of D\/a only\nfrom 4T66 to 3-803, leaving P a trifle less than 1 in 7,000, which is\nstill highly significant. In fact, this point, though perfectly valid\nand a most acceptable contribution to technique, is in the nature\nof a correction or fine adjustment and in no case invalidatory.\nThis leaves the position substantially unchanged, and we must now\nturn to Mr Stevens\u2019s much more interesting and highly ingenious\nattack from the angle of interpreta tion. This is a minor masterpiece\nof sophistry which both deserves and demands careful analysis.\nIt is not in dispute that even after the data have been duly\ndereplicated the 5x5 table yields a liighly significant result ;\nand\nI should be the first to agree with Mr Stevens in saying that this\ndoes not per se \u201c prove \u201d the occurrence of paranormal cognition.\nNatural phenomena, indeed, are never \u201c proved \u201d to occur in the\nsense that mathematical propositions may be proved to be true ;\nthey become established through familiarity, with greater or lesser\nrapidity according to circumstances, through the devising of repeat-\naide experiments and an increasing understanding of the laws which\ngovern them.\nBut Mr Stevens is not content with anything like this ;\nhe\nproduces a superficially most plausible argument to show that the\nfacts are actually to a significant extent incompatible with the\n\u201c telepathic \u201d hypothesis. He is quite right. They are significantly\n\f163]\nReply to Mr Stevens's Criticism 263\nincompatible with \u201c telepathy \u201d if, but only if, we accept his own\ndefinition of \u201c telepathy Stripped of its obscuring embroideries\nthe argument runs, \u201c If telepathy occurs at all it must be of a\nparticular type, namely a substantially \u2018\nnow or never \u2019\ntype, such\nthat a hit will be scored by its means only on one of the originals\nused in the experiment in which the percipient was engaged and\nnot on one of any other experiment. This would inflate the fre-\nquencies of the leading diagonal only. But other frequencies are\nalso significantly inflated. Therefore it is not this type of telepathy\nthat occurs. Therefore no telepathy occurs.\u201d\nThe falsity of this logic, unless it be conceded that paranormal\ncognition really yymst be of the now or never type if it is to occur\nat all, is manifest as soon as the argument is stated in this form ;\nbut Mr Stevens is naturally not so crude as this. The trick is mainly\nturned in the third sentence of paragraph eight, where he says\n\u201c . . . it is a reasonable supposition that a subject picks up telepathic\nideas of the drawings of the experiment in which he participates,\nand not of the drawings of the four experiments in which he does\nnot participate \u201d. Of course the supposition is reasonable enough,\nand if it read \u201c . . .is more likely to pick up . . . etc.\u201d, it would be\nnot only reasonable but true. But a reasonable supposition is one\nthing and an established fact is quite another. If it were known\nthat paranormal cognition w^as exclusively of the now or never\ntype postulated by Mr Stevens, his inference that what is here\nobserved is due to something other than paranormal cognition would\nbe entirely justifiable ;\nbut as it is the conclusion is no more than\na piece of indifferently rationalised apriorism.\nMr Stevens himself seems to be a trifle uneasy, for in his concluding\nparagraph he admits that there is no necessity for assuming that\nparanormal cognition must give rise only to the particular effect\nI was looking for when testing the leading diagonal. So far so good ;\nbut I think he is wrong in saying that I must abandon the diagonal\ntest and rely on the test of the whole table. I don\u2019t much mind,\nfor this\u2014as he points out\u2014also gives a highly significant result,\nthough I should have thought that in so far as one happens to be\ninterested in the diagonal, the diagonal would be the thing to test.\nBut it is giving the whole argument away in a sad anticlimax to\ncomplain that in that case \u201c the mode of operation of the telepathy\nor clairvoyance . . . would indeed be very curious \u201d. We more\nor less know that before we start, for otherwise there would be little\nmystery by this time about the phenomenon : while there seems\nno coercive reason \"why it should take a form corresponding to\nMr Stevens\u2019s preconceptions. On the other hand, I do not think\n\f264 Whately Carington [part 163]\nthat anyone familiar with the qualitative literature of the subject\nwill be particularly surprised to find a measure of precognitive and\nretrocognitive effects emerging.\nWhat would have been curious, to the point of incredibility,\nwoidd have l)een to find a paranormal effect giving a significant\noverall result for the whole Table, with the high and low cells\nrandomly dotted about the place or alternating like the squares of\na chess board. What we actually obtain, as explained in my\nsection on Displacement, is a straightforward effect with a diminish-\ning probability of occurrence before and after the event. If this\n\u201c spread \u201d and diminishment had been spatial instead of temporal,\nit would ])robably have been hailed as strong confirmatory evidence.\nTo oliject to what has actually been found suggests a somewhat\nnaive, non-relativistic attitude with something of what we might\ncall an Oedipus complex with respect to Father Time.\nMr Stevens\u2019s concluding sentence (added after the above was\nwritten) seems a somewhat unworthy red herring. The method and\nprocedure adopted have been described in great detail : if Mr\nStevens can find a flaw in either, well and good ;\nif not, then differ-\nences of opinion as to particular judgements made by Mr Hindson\n(which is all, so far as I can see, that scrutiny of the actual drawings\ncould lead to) are altogether irrelevant, as I have been at the utmost\npains to show. However, if Mr Stevens can indicate what kind of\nsystematic error he expects to find, compatible with the reported\nfacts, capable of invalidating the conclusions reached, and such as\ncould be made Ijy an uninformed judge, he is very welcome (as,\nindeerl, I have already assured him) to examine the whole or any\npart of the drawings or originals. Failing this, his point remains no\nmore than an unsupported expression of opinion.\nw. w. c.\n\fREVIEW\nExtra-Sensory Perception after Sixty Years. By J. B. Rhine, J.\nG. Pratt, C. E. Stuart and B.

Henry Holt & Co., New York, 1940. $2. 75.\nWith the doubtful exceptions of one or two of the early classics,\nwhich are scarcely comparable, this is unquestionably the most\nimportant book yet published in the field of Psychical Research and\nParapsychology. If it were not for the fact that these earlier works\nto some extent prepared the ground, I would go further and say\nthat it is the only important book of the kind yet published. Cer-\ntainly I know of no other which answers with anything like the\nsame completeness, so far as they can be answered, the manifold\nobjections, some reasonable but mostly not, which have been ad-\nvanced against accepting ESP as a fact in nature. Only one strong-\nhold of the critics is left unchallenged and unreduced, and the\nstrength of this is wholly illusory, as 1 shall indicate below. On the\nother hand, a good deal of space is wasted in pricking bubbles which\nought never to have been blown, but the blame for this lies more with\nthe would-be critics of ESP than with the authors.\nThe book is divided into four Parts : I The (Question of the\nOccurrence of ESP ;\nII The Criticism and the Evidence ;\nIII The\nNature of ESP ;\nIV The Present Situation. The first two and last\ntwo of these naturally fall together, the former pair being the more\nimmediately important, and the latter (for many readers) the more\ninteresting. I shall concern myself mainly with the finst two.\nThe principal items here are a discussion of the mathematical\nmethods used, a survey of all quantitative work published between\n1882 and 1939, a list of no less than thirty-five \u201c counter-hypotheses\u201d\nor possible objections, a more detailed discussion of six \u201c test\n\u201d\ncases believed to meet all these objections, some account of the\ngeneral course of criticism, and the results of submitting the crucial\nchapters to seven of the more eminent or more prominent critics.\nNothing is to be gained by recapitulating mathematical contro-\nversies here. The methods used are now generally accepted, and\nshould never have been challenged except on such points of detail\n26.5\n\f266 Review [part\nas the preferability of the \u201c matching \u201d to the \u201c binomial \u201d hypo-\nthesis, which is of importance only in a few borderline cases and for\nexact work of informative as opj^osed to demonstrative character.\nMost of the objections raised, e.g., Kellogg\u2019s contention that the\nobserved instead of the theoretical variance should be used, seem to\nhave arisen from a failure to understand the nature and purpose of\ntests of significance.\nThe collection of previously published material has been done\nwith very great care and completeness. There are 145 items listed\nin Table 29 of Aj^pendix 17, and many of these are classified under\nvarious headings in other Tables in the Text. I should be surprised\nif anything worth mentioning had been omitted, and this feature\nalone will make the book of great value to students as a work of\nreference. Similarly, the list of counter-hypotheses ranges from the\nfoolish suggestion that the results reported may be due to chance,\nthrough various not unreasonable criticism, to the preposterous\nnotion that ESP is contrary to science and impossible anyway.\nAgain, I think there can be no doubt that every worth-while objec-\ntion has been included together with many that are worthless.\nAll this testifies eloquently to the zeal, sincerity and thoroughness\nof the authors, but I am not sure that they have adopted the best\npolicy in the presenting of their case. It does not seem to me un-\nequivocally clear from the treatment that they have fully grasped\nthe great principle that ten leaky buckets will not hold water longer\nthan one leaky bucket and that this is true even if the leaks are in\ndifferent places. Although the great number of experiments reported\nas favoural^le to ESP may constitute a strong prima facie case for\nfurther investigation, rigid demonstration cannot be advanced by\nclaiming that experiment A excludes counter-hypothesis X, and\nthat experiment B excludes counter-hypothesis Y, if Y is not\nexcluded by A or X by B. It would, of course, be very strange if it\nju.st so happened that whenever an experiment was water-tight in\noire respect it was leaky in another ;\nand this might be made the\nbasis of a special argument of some cogency. In the absence of this,\nI should have preferred to see a few of these early cases {e.g., Usher\nand Burt, Groningen, Estabrooks) picked out and treated in more\ndetail as virtually water-tight, and the others marshalled as no\nmore than a part of a general attack on the apriorist position.\nIt seems to me that the authors, in common with many others\nincluding myself, have all too long and all too tamely submitted to\nthe dogma that ESP is \u201c inherently \u201d or \u201c antecedently \u201d improb-\nable. I doubt whether this dogma is more than a fear-promoted\nbluff, and it is certainly high time that someone led a spirited on-\n\f163 ]\nReview 267\nslaught against it. We might well begin by asking those who pro-\npound it to give us an estimate of the probability of the occurrence\nof ESP and to tell us how they arrived at it : I think it would be\nfound that they are unable to do so and would quickly take refuge\nin evasive ambiguities or ad hominem arguments. If the dogma\nmeans that observations made antecedent to a given experiment\nor situation indicate that the probability of ESP occurring in that\nexperiment or situation is small, the question is begged ;\nfor any\nsuch proposition can only summarise accumulated experience re-\ngarding the relative frequencies of occurrence of ESP in situations\nof that type and in others ;\nand this implies the, at least, occasional\noccurrence of ESP. But if the dogma is intended to assert that\nESP is inherently impossible, then it is not concerned with proba-\nbility at all, except in that purely formal sense in which it may be\nsaid that the probability of anyone drawing a circular square is\nzero, and the word should not be introduced. In this case it is for\nthe critics to show, as they have never attempted to do, that the\nalleged phenomena of ESP either involve a contradiction in terms\nor are formally incompatible with established facts of physical\nscience. But physical science and parapsychology operate in fields\nwhich, though presumably coterminous, are certainly not co-\nextensive, just as is true of the fields of magnetism and mechanics.\nPhysical science has abstracted from the totality of possible ob-\nservables those only which are measurable in terms of the gram,\nthe centimetre and the second ;\nand in thus abstracting it has auto-\nmatically restricted itself to observables of that kind, and its \u201c laws\n\u201d\nconsist of statements of relations between these. It is difficult to\nsee how such statements can jjossibly be formally incompatible with\nstatements about states of mind and cognitive relations of which\nthe subject-matter is largely or wholly different. Finally, if critics\nmean that ESP is contrary to experience, they can only justify their\nallegation by tacitly defining ESP in advance in such a way as to\nmake it so, for example as \u201c a faculty which would enable one to\nread all the books in a library simultaneously and from a distance \u201d ;\nbut this is too base and too feeble to be worth powder and shot.\nThe digression seems justified because failure to realise the ex-\ntreme weakness of the apriorist position is liable to make people\nthink it necessary to produce very high levels of significance in\norder to outweigh the (actually non-existent) \u201c antecedent im-\nprobability\u201d so gratuitously postulated by their opponents. This\ndistracts attention from the only function of tests of significance,\nnamely to tell us whether the effects observed are likely to be due\nto chance deviations from the null hypothesis tested.\n\f268 Review [part !\ni\nWith the ajjriorist and mathematical objections out of the way, j\nthe only alternatives left worth mentioning are those involving the '\nj\nperception of sensory cues ;\nfor hypotheses about rational inference |\nand clerical errors will not bear examination, while that of extensive\nand collusory fraud has yet to be responsibly suggested.\nNow there was a time when many of us were gravely perturbed\nat the discovery that the standard ESP cards, as sold to the public\nand used in most of the reported experiments, could be read from i\nthe back in suitable lights, and this \u201c alarm and despondency\n\u201d\nwas justified by the fact that many of the early experiments of this\nkind were not described in sufficient detail to assure us that this\npossibility had been recognised and eliminated. ^ But such misgivings\nare now altogether out of date, as Dr Lemmon very fairly insists\n(p. 222), for most recent work has been done with the cards so screened\nthat the percipient cannot see them at all. Certainly nothing of the\nkind can have arisen in any of the six selected cases cited.\nThese cases are all of very high quality, particularly\u2014to my own\nmind\u2014the Pratt-Woodruff, Warner, and Pierce-Pratt experiments,\nwhich I shovdd regard as to all intents and purposes flawless ;\nbut :\n1 think it a pity that full experimental details from the original\nreports were not repeated in the text. Not every reader will have\neasy access to the originals, while the form in which they are dealt\nwith makes it very difficult to reconstruct just what happened.\nThe principal fault of the whole work lies in the direction of pro-\ntesting too much\u2014of trying to pile every scrap of evidence and every '\nshred of argument into the scale, instead of cutting out as much i\nrubbish as possible and relying on the high quality of what remains.\nNot all critics are wmrth answering, and to thunder in pursuit of\nevery paltry red herring drawn across the trail does not really\nadd to the strength of the case. In Churchillian phrase, \u201c Why\nshould we stop to hurl a stone at every cur that yaps?\n\u201d\nTurning to the second half of the book, dealing with the nature of\nICSP, future developments, and cognate matters, I have space to\ncomment on only one point. Foster, developing a suggestion due\nto Dr Thouless, has proposed the use of a quantity called the ESP\nQuotient, which is the percentage of hits most probably made by\nESP alone apart from those due to chance ;\nhe also proposes to use\n^ It seems only fair to Dr Rhine and his colleagues to mention here the\ncircumstances described on p. 193, where it is explained that \u201c Careful specifi-\ncations and warnings to the printers resulted in adequate proof sheets. The\nwarping \u201d (be., the shrinkage which makes reading from the back possible)\n\u201c apparently occurred after the cards were cut and stored \u201d. This would\nappear to exonerate those concerned from the otherwise not unreasonable\ncharge of incompetence.\n\f163]\nReview 269\nthis to investigate the kind of psychological process involved in\ncertain ESP situations. In particular ; In the technique known as\nOpen Matching the subject is required to match a pack of ESP\ncards against five \u201c key \u201d cards (one of each type) which are exposed\nface upward in front of him ;\nin Blind Matching, the key cards are\nface down. Thus in the second technique the percipient has to\ncognise by ESP both the key card and the cards to be matched as\ncompared with the latter only, in the first. Quoting from p. 316 :\n\u201c The simplest supposition would be that when confronted with the\ntask in Blind Matching (a) two cards are to be matched ; (6) one\ncard is perceived ;\n(c) the other card is perceived ;\n(d) the two are\nidentified as similar. This is termed by Foster a circumferential func-\ntion, implying a going around the long way. Contrasted to this is the\ndiametric function . . . ,\nwhich assumes that the perceptual act cuts\nacross from (a) to (d) .. . making a single act of the perception of\nlikeness.\u201d It is then shown that, in the first case, the fraction repre-\nsenting the ESP Quotient wmidd have to be squared in order to\ncalculate the expectation of successes due to ESP, while in the\nsecond it would not. This is then used as the basis of an attempt\nto ascertain which hypothesis is correct. It is found (p. 317) that\n\u201c ... on the whole the results clearly fall between the twm extremes\nexpected on the basis of the two hypotheses considered. In no\nseries did [the relevant figures] fall to the level supposed by the\nhypothesis that the elements are separately perceived (circum-\nferential function) and the relations established by a separate act.\u201d\nBut surely Blind Matching is precisely the same as Open Matching,\nfrom this point of view, once the percipient has made up his mind\nwhich key card is which ;\nif so, the circumferential process woidd only\nhave a chance of operating, if at all, during some early period of\nindecision and could scarcely pull the figures down to the required\nlevel. To test the point properly it would, I think, be necessary to\nask the subject to indicate which pairs of cards were similar in two\nface-down packs, or something very like this. But the idea is\npromising and might well repay further research. Incidentally, it\nis interesting to note that the various quotients reported, though\nranging from as high as 17-7 to as low as T3, appear to average at\nmuch the same value (round about 6) as the analogous figures\nderivable from my own experiments with drawings ;\nbut this is\nvery provisional and not to be taken too seriously.\nA few miscellaneous points : The book is well produced, excel-\nlently printed, and provided with a Glossary, two good Indexes and\nan admirable list of 361 References ;\nbut its utility and convenience\n\fReview\n270 [part 163]\nwould be enormously increased by the addition of a list of Tables,\npreferably showing the nature of each.\nThe Appendices, which are mainly mathematical, present a\nvariety of useful formulae, methods and Tables ;\nbut they also\ncontain a few slips. In Ajjpendix 3, it is implied that the best\nestimate, of the variance of N qiiantities is obtained by dividing\nthe sum of the squares of their differences from their mean by N ;\nthe divisor should be N - 1, otherwise the variance of a single quantity\nwould be computed as zero, whereas it is indeterminate for lack of\nsufficient data. Table 25 of App. 4 has three trivial errors in the last\ncolumn ;\nthe figures 9-82, 4-06, 4-06 should read 9-80, 4-05, 4-05, and\nthe total should be 35-80 instead of 35-84. Appendix 7 is jjerfectly\nsound as it stands, but would it not be simpler to compute with\none degree of freedom from a 2 x 2 table of hits and misses under the\ntwo conditions? In Appendix 9 (Stevens\u2019s Matching formulae) the\nextreme case suggested of 25 circles ])resented and 25 circles called\nwould lead to expected and observed numbers of hits both equal to\n25, and thence to D\/s = 0\/0 ;\nso that P is not 1 as stated but indeter-\nminate.\nTo sum u]) : The book, though not wholly free from defects,\nmainly tactical and of no real importance, is a product of which its\nauthors may well be proud. It does not \u201c prove \u201d the occurrence of\nESP as the books of Euclid prove propositions about triangles ;\nbut\nnatural phenomena are insusceptible of that kind of proof. It does\nnot produce evidence overwhelmingly outweighing the antecedent\nimprobabilities of the apriorists ;\nand that is because there are no\nsuch improbabilities to outweigh. But it does state a case enor-\nmoizsly stronger than that on which murderers are usually convicted\nand hanged. All reasonable ]zeople will feel, I think, that ESP is\nnow well rooted and likely to grow apace. Doubtless a few diehards\nwill still hold out ;\nbut who cares about a few diehards more or less\n\u2014\nprovided they die?\nw. w. c.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 164\nHENRI BERGSON\nAlthough M. Bergson died only a few months ago, he will be re-\nmembered as the philosopher of the period 1890-1914. All his main\ncontributions to Philosophy were made during those years. (It is\ntrue that he published a full-length work, Les deux sources de la\nmorale et de la religion, as recently as 1932, but it is no more than\nan interesting afterthought.) Those were also the years of his\ngreatest influence and reputation. That influence extended far\nbeyond the narrow circle of professional philosophers. His doctrine\nof \u201c lived duration \u201d, as op^^osed to the conceptual and spatialised\ntime of Physics, did much to determine the psychological method\nof Proust\u2019s novels ;\nand the very peculiar literary style adopted by\nthat writer\u2014so different from Bergson\u2019s own\u2014was intended, appar-\nently, to reproduce the flowing character of the Bergsonian stream\nof consciousness, in which every part interpenetrates every other.\nBut Bergson\u2019s thought had more imj^ortant repercussions than this.\nHis sharp antithesis between intelligence on the one hand, instinct\nand intuition on the other ;\nhis doctrine that intelligence is only a\npractical tool {homo sapiens, he says, should rather be described\nas homo faber) ;\nwhereas instinct and intuition, which is instinct\nbecome reflective, put us into touch with ultimate reahty ;\nhis\nvitalistic metaphysics, which made the life-force \u201d, Velan vital,\nmore fundamental than either matter or consciousness as we com-\nmonly understand them : all these have played their part in shaping\nthose irrationalist or anti-rationalist movements of our own time\nwhich have exalted action, and even violence, as an end in itself,\nand have overthrown, perhaps for ever, the old bourgeois-liberal\ncivilisation of the European continent. (It is fortunate perhaps\nR\n\f272 H. H. Price [part\nthat the English-speaking peoples do not take Philosophy so \u2019\nseriously.) On the other hand, he also undermined the prestige of i\nMaterialistic Positivism, and so paved the way for that revival of\nIntellectual Catholicism which is so important a feature of contem-\nporary France. It is not for nothing that his disciple, M. Jacques |\nChevalier, holds office in the Vichy government, and was for a time ^\nits Minister of Education.\nBut while these effects of Bergson\u2019s thought have been showing\nthemselves upon the stage of w'orld-history, his reputation among\nprofessional philosophers has steadily declined ;\nand outside his own\ncountry, the works which astonished the Edwardian age are nowa-\ndays rarely opened, and still more rarely discussed. He is classed\nwith \u201c the metaphysicians \u201d, and metaphysics of any sort is now\nvery much under the weather. It seems to me, however, that this\ndechne is quite unjustified. There are fashions in Philosophy, as in :\n'\nother things, and some day he will come into his own again. We\nmust admit, I think, that the astonishing brilliance of his style\u2014 :\n^\nand few, even among French writers, have shown a greater stylistic 1\nmastery\u2014has on occasions betrayed him. It has enabled him, some- i\ntimes, to distract the reader\u2019s attention with a chain of dazzhng\nimages where solid argument is called for, and to \u201c get away with\n\u201d\nthe substitute, where a more humdrum writer would never have\nsucceeded. This applies particularly to the more speculative parts\n'\nof UEvolution Crmtrice, which both for good and for ill is the most !\nmetaphysical of all his writings. It is also true that in the epistemo- i\nlogical parts of his work he insists upon using a peculiarly clumsy i\nand ambiguous technical terminology (inherited from the French\nphilosophers of the nineteenth century), which often obscures his .\nmeaning ;\nthough all the time he is trying to break through the '\nmuddles and false problems which that very terminology had engen- :\ndered. It may well be true, again, that he failed to understand the\nmathematical theory of continuity, as Lord Russell and others have\nargued, and that the antithesis which he sets up between the ;\n\u201c spatialised time \u201d of Physics and the \u201c real duration \u201d characteristic ^\nof life and consciousness is vitiated to some extent by this failure. _=\nBut when all these defects have been duly taken into account, it\n\u2019\nwill be found, I believe, that a very solid residuum remains. Some i\nday the problems which he posed, and the startlingly original solu- i'\ntions he suggested for them, will have to be considered again. The\nrelation of life and consciousness to the physical universe, the main j\ntheme of all his major works, is not a topic which the human mind ;\ncan permanently neglect. *\nIt follows from what I have said that the time for a balanced\n\f164] Henri Bergson 273\nestimate of Bergson's thought has not yet come. But it does not\nfollow that ill the meanwhile we had better refrain from reading\nhim. Certainly we in this Society should not refrain from doing so.\nIt is clear that the main themes of his philosophy lie very near to\nthe sphere of our special interest. Indeed the theme of one of his\nmost unportaut works, Matm'e et Memoire,^ lies right in the centre.\nFor its main purpose is to propound a new and revolutionary theory\nof the relation between mind and brain. We are therefore not sur-\nprised to find that some of the most interesting passages in his\nPresidential Address to the Society in 1913 ^ are concerned with\nrestating the main conclusions of that book, in such a way as to bring\nout their bearings upon the problems of Psychical Research. I will\nnow try to smnmarise liis theory of the relation of mind and brain,\nillustrating my summary by quotations from the Presidential Address.\nBergson\u2019s fundamental idea is that the brain is the organ of actiori.\nThis is its primary function, in relation to which all its activities\nhave to be understood. In perception, for instance, its function is\nto select a certain part of the external world as the object of our\nconsciousness, shutting out all the rest ;\nand this selection is made\nfor rigorously practical ends. The normal healthy man perceives\nso much of the world as he can act uj^on, and he perceives it as a\npossible subject-matter for action ;\nhe imposes upon its \u201c real\nextensity \u201d a framework of homogeneous and infinitely divisible\nspace, so that every object, and even every living being, appears\nto him as something in principle decomposable into separate parts,\nwhich he may re-combine into new forms to suit his practical ends.\nThe mechanistic interpretation of Nature is simply an extension of\nthis instinctive view of homo faber, and so itself has a biological\nbasis. Perception, then, is primarily a practical not a theoretical\nfunction ;\nit exists for the sake of action, not for the sake of know-\nledge. Nevertheless, Bergson holds that the range of unconscious\nperception is probably far wider than this : each of us perceives\n\u201c virtually \u201d far more than he perceives actually. When our \u201c atten-\ntion to life \u201d lapses for any reason, and the barrier imposed by the\nbrain is weakened, some of those \u201c virtual \u201d perceptions may be\nable to pass the threshold of consciousness, and telepathy or clair-\nvoyance may occur. ^\nHis view about memory is similar. He begins by distinguishing\n1 First edition 1896. There is an English translation.

But, equally certainly, (\nit is not in the strict sense memory at all.\nWhen I repeat a stanza of Tennyson by rote, I am not recalling\nanything in my past (for exainple, the first occasion when I read\nthat particular stanza) ;\nI am simply performing an habitual action.\n|\nOn the other hand, memory proper, the retaining and recollecting\n|\nof past experiences, is not dependent on the brain at all. It is a I\npurely psychical frmction ;\nand it is j^robable that the whole of our i\npast is unconsciously retained, though only a small part of it can ;\nnormally be recalled. We must not suppose that cerebral traces, j\ncorresponding somehow to ]?ast experiences, are physically stored '\nup somewhere in our heads. So far is the brain from being the organ i\nof memory, that its function is rather to prevent us from recalling :\ntoo much. Just as it prevents us from perceiving what would be -\nbiologically useless to us, so here ;\nit allows us to recall only that |\nparticular bit of our past which is relevant to our present practical\nsituation, and shuts out all the rest from our consciousness. At ,\nleast, all the rest is shut out from the consciousness of the normal\nhealthy man. But if our bodily mechanism is enfeebled or deranged,\nwe shall find that all sorts of useless memories will come flocking in.\nIndeed, according to Bergson, this is precisely what happens to all\nof us in dreams, when our practical activities are in abeyance. It\nis from this point of view that he approaches certain disorders of\nmemory, notably aphasia and word-blindness. Since such disorders\ncan be correlated with precisely localised injuries to the brain, they\nhave been thought to provide direct evidence for the cerebral trace\ntheory of memory. Bergson exj^lains the facts differently. It is\n,\nnot that the memories themselves have been destroyed. It is merely\nthat the connection between memory and action has been cut at a\ncertain point, and this prevents certain of our memories from\nreaching consciousness. The damage to the brain prevents a certain ,\nclass of actions from occurring ;\nand then the particular memories <\nwhich would have been relevant to those actions cannot rise above\nj\nthe threshold, though they are still retained in the unconscious.\nThe part played by the brain in thinking is explained on sunilar\nlines. According to scientific orthodoxy, every act of thought has\nits corresponding brain-state ;\nand if a sufficiently accomplished ;\nphysiologist could inspect the jjhysico-chemical processes which are\ngoing on in my brain while I am thinking, he would be able to infer\nevery detail of my train of thought. Bergson\u2019s view is very different. !\nHe holds that the role of the brain in thinking is only to produce I\nmovements and bodily attitudes which \u201c act out \u201d what the mind\n\f164] Henri Bergson 275\nthinks\n\u2014\u201c (\\\\iijouent ce que I\u2019esprit pe-nse\n\u201d ^\nThe brain in this con-\nnection is \u201can organ of pantomime \u201d\u2014in the etymological sense of\nthe word \u201c pantomime \u201d (perhaps \u201c dmnb-show \u201d wonld be a better\nrendering). The imaginary physiologist who looked into my brain\ncould infer very little about my train of thought. He could only\ndiscover so much of it as is expressible in gestures, postures, and\nbodily movements, \u201c what the psychical state contains in the way\nof action, either actually in process of accomplishment or merely\nnascent He would be like a man who observes the comings and\ngoings of the players on the stage, without being able to hear a word\nthey say : or like a deaf man at an orchestra who can only see the\ngesticulations of the conductor. \u201c Accordingly an examination of\nthe interior of the brain would reveal nothing of mental processes\nstrictly so called. The sole business of the brain, ajjart from its\nsensory functions, is to mime the mental life.\u201d ^ On the other hand\nthis mimetic function is of the utmost biological importance. With-\nout a brain to ensure that our thoughts are \u201c mimed \u201d by bodily\ndumb-show, we could not \u201c insert ourselves in reality \u201d ;\nwe could\nnot respond to or cope with our physical environment. In short,\nit is this \u201c organ of pantomime \u201d which makes intelligent action\npossible. \u201c Though consciousness is not a function of the brain,\nat any rate the brain keeps our consciousness fixed upon the world\nin which we live ;\nit is the organ of attention to life.\u201d And again :\n\u201c To orientate our thought towards action, to induce it to prepare\nthe act which circumstances require : that is the task for which\nour brain is made.\u201d ^\nBut, as has already been made clear, the very fact that the brain\nis the organ of action also makes it an organ of limitation. By\nkeejring our nose firmly fixed u2\n:\u00bbon the grindstone, it prevents us\nfrom noticing a number of interesting but \u201c useless \u201d things. The\nvast panorama of our past is shut out from our view, except for\nthat little corner which is relevant to our action at the moment\n;\nand for all we can tell, a whole world of extra-sensory perceptions\nis likewise prevented from rising above the threshold of conscious-\nness, though jDresent to the mind in a \u201c virtual \u201d or unconscious\nstate. It is therefore not at all siuq:)rising if some of those extra-\nsensory percej3tions should find their way into our consciousness,\nwhen \u201c attention to fife \u201d is impaired or deliberately suspended.\nSuch is Bergson\u2019s theory of the relation of imnd and brain, in\nvery brief outline. It seems clear that if this theory be true, we\n1 Proceedings, Vol. XXVI, p. 472. Bergson\u2019s italics.\n^ Ibid., p. 472. \u00ae Ibid., p. 473. My italics. * Ibid., jj. 473.\n\f276 H. H.

Experiment VI :\n\u2018\nKnown \u2019\nversus \u2018\nUnknown \u2019\nOriginals\nABSTRACT : Fifty originals, randomly selected from a larger list,\nwere drawn by a third party and enclosed in envelopes. From these\nfifty envelopes ten were taken at random for use in the experiment.\nThese ten, divided into two groups of five each, were put up as\ntargets for the percipients, first in their closed (\u2018 unknown \u2019) state\nand later after they had been opened and copied by the experimenter.\nThe drawings received were suitably randomised and were scored\nby the experimenter against the ten working originals. They were\nlater scored against the whole fifty originals from which these ten\nhad been taken by an independent judge. Neither scoring shows any\nappreciable advantage for the known as compared with the unknown\ncondition.\n1. Introductory : So soon as we have satisfied ourselves to a\nreasonable degree of assurance, such as I venture to believe has\nbeen afforded by the experiments already described,^ that some\nkind of paranormal cognition occurs at all, a number of questions\nimmediafely arise as to the nature and modus operandi of the\nphenomenon.\nOne of the most important of these is whether, or to what extent,\nknowledge of the original (or, more generally, of the object to be\ncognised) in the mind of the experimenter, or of some person con-\nnected with the experiment, is essential to the process involved.\nSomewhat roughly and colloquially speaking, this is equivalent to\nthe question of whether the phenomenon is \u2018\ntelepathic \u2019\nor \u2018\nclair-\nvoyant \u2019\nin character, or perhaps a mixture of both ;\nbut I think\nit would be injudicious to commit ourselves at the present stage to\n^ Proc.

[part\nusing these words as more than temporary conveniences of locution.\nIt is not a question of deciding into which of two known and estab-\nlished categories a newly observed phenomenon falls, as one might\nseek to classify an unfamiliar zoological specimen. Categories can\nonly be established after the examination of a large numlDer of\nspecimens, not before, whereas at present we are barely sure that\nthere are any specimens to be examined at all. Thus, while it is\nlegitimate enough to reflect that paranormal cognition may be of\ntwo types, in one of which there is interaction of two or more minds\n(telejrathy), and in the other between a mind or minds and a material\nobject (clairvoyance), it would be dangerous to allow ourselves to\nsujopose that the fact of a given example of the phenomenon appear- j'\u2019\ning to be of the one type or the other necessarily carries with it any\nimplications l)eyond the liare fact stated.\nThe foregoing, however, in no wise diminishes the importance of\nthe point at issue, and I decided at an early stage to make some\nattempt to throw light upon it so soon as I had completed the pre-\nliminary experiments reported in my first paper.\nI may say at once that the results of this experiment are not in\nthemselves conclusive, though I think we shall be able to form a\nfairly well founded opinion when they have been considered in the |\ncontext of the other work. For the purposes of the present dis- i\ncussion, however, I shall confine myself to the internal evidence\nwhich the experiment was designed to yield. '\nj\n2. General Tecimique: Exceq)t that some of the originals^ used j\nwere in closed envelopes and were unknown to me at the time, the I\ntechnique employed was substantially identical, in its general fea-\ntures, with that of Ex])eriments I to V. That is to say, the originals\nwere, in every case, ]uit up in my study at or before 7.0 p.m. and\nwere taken down at about 9.30 a.m. the next morning. The same\nprecautions as regards curtaining, etc., were taken, and the chance\nof any ])ercipient obtaining knowledge of any original by sensory,\nmeans may be regarded as altogether negligible. <\nThe drawing books issued to percipients were jrrecisely similar to\nthose used in the earlier experiments, so far as their pages were\nconcerned. Ajiart from dates, etc., the only change worth men-\ntioning in the instructions printed on the covers consisted in the\naddition of two items, viz. :\n(i)\n\u201c Do not draw vague scenes, elaborate interiors or geo-\nmetrical diagrams.\u201d\n1 For terminology throughout, unless otherwise indicated, see my first paper 1\nreferred to above.\n\f164]\nExjieriments on Paranormal Cognition of Dratvings 279\nj\n(ii)\n\u201c If your drawing is at all ambiguous, please say what\nI\nit is meant to Ije.\u201d\nThe object of these additions was to avoid ambiguities and to\nincrease the proportion of drawings which could be scored with\nreasonable confidence. I have the very strong imjiression, though\nit is scarcely practicable to demonstrate its correctness rigidly, that\nthe desired effect was produced.\n3. Preparation of the Originals : The object of the experiment, as\nalready implied, was to ascertain v\/hether knowledge of the original\nin the mind of the experimenter (myself) was necessary or advan-\ntageous to the successful functioning of the percipients. It was\ntherefore necessary that I should be ignorant of at least some of the\noriginals during at least part of the experiment. Accordingly, I\nclearly could not j^repare them all myself, and there seemed nothing\nto be gained, but rather the contrary, in preparing some myself and\nI enlisting the services of someone else for the others.\nI also felt it undesirable that originals which had lieen used in\nthe first group of experiments should l:)e used again, and this pre-\ncluded me from giving some third party a free hand in selecting\nI\nsubjects or illustrations at random from a dictionary, as I myself\n1 had done in the first instance.\n,\nMoreover, I had in mind the possibility that knowledge of\n!\noriginals in the mind of anyone connected with the experiment,\neven at one remove, so to speak, might have some influence on the\nresults ;\nand I was accordingly anxious, in order to minimise this,\n(a) that whoever drew the originals should not know what had been\nused in the earlier experiments, and {h) that he or she should not\nknow just which particular originals were lieing used in this.\nTo meet these requirements I adopted the following plan ;\nI made out a list of 216 possible subjects for illustration, arranged\nin six blocks of six columns and six rows, avoiding subjects which\nhad already been used or others very like or closely associated with\nthem, but otherwise selecting in a more or less haphazard manner.^\nThis list I sent to my friend Mrs Aletta Lewis, who is a professional\nartist and had most kindly consented to help in the matter, and\nasked her to select and illustrate fifty of the sid^jects mentioned.\nThe selection was done by throwing three dice fifty times and taking,\n1 It may be worth noting that it is not nearly so easy as most people seem\nto suppose to find a really large number of readily illustrable, clearly dis-\ntinguishable and widely famihar subjects for originals. I went through the\nwhole of a small pocket dictionary fairly systematically and then had to do\nan appreciable amount of thhiking before I found enough words for my\njDurpose which fulfilled all requirements.\n\f280 Whately Carington, M.A., 31. Sc. [part\nI\nin each case, the word appearing in the block, column and row\n|\nof the list indicated by the numbers so obtained, using any suitable 1\nconvention as to which should be associated with which die. I do i\nnot now think that this was any better, but probably somewhat jij\nworse, than the simpler plan of writing some large number of suit-\nj\nable words on separate shps of paper, enclosing these in a like |\nnumber of envelopes, shuffling the envelopes and instructing the\nartist to take out fifty at random.^ However, it served the purpose\nfor wdiich it was intended, namely that of securing a substantially\nrandom sample from the initial list.\nThese fifty words were illustrated by Mrs Lewis, on sheets taken\n|\nfrom surplus drawing books, in precisely the same manner (though '\nnaturally with fax greater technical skill) as had been those selected\nfrom the dictionary by me for use in the first five experiments.\nThat is to say, they were illustrated by simple line drawings executed\nin Indian ink on drawing-book sheets, as descrilied in my first paper,\nand each had the name of the represented object written on it in\nRoman letters about 1\" to f\" high.\nEach of these potential originals was placed by Mrs Lewis between\nthe leaves of an ordinary double sheet of foolscap paper, and enclosed\nin a 14\" by 9\" envelope. It may be noted here that the foolscap\nsheet and the envelope were not, between them, opaque in any\nstrict sense of the term. That is to say, it would have been easy\nenough, as I knew from previous experiment, to determine the\nnature of the enclosed drawing by holding the envelope against a\nstrong light. But I had, of course, no temptation in this direction,\nfor to have done so would have been to risk vitiating the whole\nex])eriment by giving me knowledge of originals which it was\nessential for me not to have. The sheet of foolscap was only an\nadditional, and in practice a superfluous, precaution against my\ninadvertently acquiring knowledge of the originals despite the pro-\ntection of the envelopes.\nThese fifty envelopes were sent by Mrs Lewis direct to Dr E. J.\nDingwall, to whom I must again express my indebtedness, and were\nthoroughly shuffled by us jointly, after which ten were drawn at\nrandom, numbered 1 to 10, and used as originals in this experiment.\nAs explained in my first paper, these ten were later returned to the\nremaining forty, after they had been used, and the whole fifty were\nemployed as pseudo-originals for the Control Marking carried out\nliy Mr SaltUiUrsli.^\nThe result of all this was that I myself knew nothing whatever,\n^ I adopted this latter procedure in Expt. VII, q.v.\n^ Loc. cit. p. 112.\n\f164]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 281\nat this stage, al:>out the selected teu, except that they must be some\nten from my list of 216 possibilities. Sirs Lewis knew, in one sense,\neven less ;\nfor, although she was aware of the general character of\nthe work on which I was engaged, she did not know the precise\nnature of the experiment in which her cbawings were to be employed,\nor just when it would take place, or how many of them would be\nused. And even if she had known all these things, she could not\nhave known which ten originals would be chosen from the fifty she\nhad prepared. Thus the possibility of normal leakage from this\nsource may be wholly disregarded, especially as Mrs Lewis did not\nknow at all what percipients would be taking part. As regards the\npossibility of paranormal influence from her mind, it is to be noted\nthat any effect which this might have would necessarily be spread\nover the whole fifty originals she had prepared and not concentrated\non those actually used, still less on those iised in any particular\nperiod of the experiment. Note also, with a view to possible\ndevelopments to be discussed at a later stage, that she could hardly\nbe regarded as having strongly associated the originals with the\nexperiiy.ent, because she had no direct experience of the latter,\nbut only the sketchiest conversational account from me of the kind\nof work I had been doing.\nThe ten originals actually selected proved to be, in alphabetical\norder : Book, Bow (tie, not archery). Chopper (drawn more as a\nhatchet). Cigar, Coat (no wearer shown). House (conventional).\nLamp (old-fashioned oil table lamp vdth glass chimney, no shade),\nPehcan, Euler (student\u2019s type footrule). Teapot.\nT may say here that the forty envelopes not used, together with\nthe fifty originals of the earlier experiments, and such of the ten\nselected envelopes of this experiment as had not been opened, were\nremoved from my study and placed during the period of the experi-\nment at the bottom of a wardrobe trunk in an adjoining room.\nAfter any one of the ten selected envelopes had been opened and\nits contained original used, the latter was locked up in the steel box\nreferred to in my first paper.\n4. Arrangement of the Experiment\n:\nIt is not nearly so easy as\nmight be imagined to devise a satisfactory experiment of this type.\nOn the face of it, the obvious plan would be to put up the ten\noriginals first in their envelopes (i.e. with their nature unknown to\nthe experimenter) and then again, perhaps in a different order,\nafter they had been opened by him. If we obtained a significantly\nhigher proportion of hits under the second conditions than under\nthe first, we should tend to conclude that the experimenter\u2019s know-\nledge of the originals favoured the process of cognition. But such\n\f282 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\na plau has certain serious defects. In the first place, percipients\nmight become bored or fatigued in the course of the work, and this\nwould tend to mask the. kind of effect just mentioned ;\nor they\nmight, oppositely, improve with practice, which would tend to\nenhance or even spuriously generate it. Apart from this, it is at\nleast possible that many would hesitate to draw the same thing\ntwice ;\nand this, assuming that clairvoyance were operative, would\ntend to favour the \u2018\nclosed \u2019\ncondition as compared with the \u2018\nopen \u2019.\nMoreover, a test consisting of twenty consecutive trials is longer\nthan I should care to ask most percipients to undertake, and longer,\nI fancy, than most would complete even if they consented to start.\nThis ol:)jection also applies to any scheme for alternating the ten\nclosed and unknown originals with ten known originals selected in\nthe same way as those of the earlier experiments. Besides, the two\nseries would be bound to have different popularities, and this would\ngive one of them an advantage over the other of which it would be\nimpossible to determine the magnitude.\nThere is also the point that once an original is known it cannot,\nfor the same experimenter, be made \u2018\nunknown \u2019\nagain, and this fact\nintroduces certain restrictions of its own.\nFinally, l)ut in some ways most important of all, it is imperative\nthat drawings compared from the point of view of whether the\noriginals at which they were aimed were open or closed {i.e. known\nor unknown) should be of equal lateness in the series drawn by the\npercipients. To illustrate simply the point involved, let us suppose\nthat we put up five originals, first in closed envelopes (unknown)\nand then after they have been opened (known) on ten successive\nevenings, and ask a grouj) of percipients to attempt to \u2018\nreproduce\n\u2019\nthem. Suppose also that these five drawings represented Astrolabe,\nOka2:ii, Xylophone, Platypus and Bistoury. I think it will be\ngenerally agreed that, assuming chance alone to be operative, these\nobjects, if drawn at all, would probably be drawn late in the series\nrather than early. If so, examination of the drawings would\nfalsely suggest that the known condition was advantageous ;\nand\nan opposite effect might l)e jwoduced if the originals were, let us say,\nTree, House, Table, Chair and Boat. The point, however, is not\nthat very common or \u2018 popular \u2019\nobjects are necessarily drawn early\nin a series of ten, or vice versa, but that it is quite unsafe to assume\nthat objects are equally likely to be drawn in any position. On the\ncontrary, we may be fairly sure that of any two originals one will\ntend to be drawn on the average earlier than the other ;\nand that\nthe same will be true of any two groups of five originals such as\nwere used, as will be seen below, in this experiment.\n\f164] Exjjemnenf.s on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 283\nTo meet these various considerations I decided that it would be\nnecessary to use ten originals divided into two groups, to divifle\nmy percipients also into two categories, to arrange for each category\nto aim at both groups of originals and for each to aim at one group\nclosed and at the other open. The two groups of five originals are\nreferred to for convenience as X and Y, and the two categories of\npercipients as A and B. It should be noted that although, as in the\nearlier experiments, percipients were necessarily grouped, for the\nmost part, in the geographical sense, nearly all these geographical\ngroups included percipients of both categories, and that there was\nno systematic arrangement as to which should be A and which B.\nThus each category was just as fair a sample as the other and there\nis no reason at all to suppose that either possessed or displayed\nproclivities which the other lacked.\nI am much indebted to Dr R. H. Thouless for helj)\non the final arrangement, which was as follows :\nin decidinj\nPeriod Occasions Percipients Originals Condition\n1 1 to 5 A 1 to 5, alias X Closed\n2 6 \u201e 10 B 1 \u201e 5 \u201e X Open\n3 11 \u201e 15 B 6 \u201e 10 \u201e Y Closed\n4 16 \u201e 20 A 6 \u201e 10 \u201e Y Open\nThe originals actually used on the various evenings of the experi-\nment are given below :\nPeriod Date Original Condition\n1 Xov. 14, 1939 Cigar Closed\n15 Book\n16 Bow J f\n17 Ruler J )\n18 Lamp\n2 19 Book Open\n20 Bow > J\n21 Ruler J >\n22 Cigar 99\n23 Lamp 9 9\n3 24 House Closed\n25 Chopper 9)\n26 Pelican 99\n27 Teapot 99\n28 Coat 99\n4 29 House Open\n30 Pehcan 99\nDec. 1 Teapot 9 9\n2 Coat 99\n3 Chopper 99\n\f284 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that this arrangement involved\na twenty-day experiment for the experimenter, but only ten for\neach percipient. Percipients in category A, however, had to do five\nevenings\u2019 work, then stop for ten evenings, and then do the remaining\nfive. This was an inevitable inconvenience and I am much indebted\nto them for the higli proportion of cases in which they remembered\nto do so.\n5. Procedure\n:\nThere is little to add to what has already been\nsaid, in this paper or my first, on this subject. As explained, the\nclosed envelopes or opened originals, as the case might be, were\npinned up on my study bookcase at or before 7.0 p.m. each eveniirg,\nand were taken down again at or after 9.30 a.m. the next morning.\nAt the end of the, first and third periods, slips of paper were suitably\npasted over the numbers on the envelopes which had been used,\nand they were shufiied out of my sight by my wife and then renum-\nbered. Thus the originals for periods 2 and 4 were, as will be seen\nfrom the list given above, the same as for periods 1 and 3 respec-\ntively, but were used in a different order.\nTo make sure that the experimenters paid due attention to the\noriginals, each was traced in Indian ink on a fresh sheet of paper\nas soon as it w^as oirened and unmediately before it was put up. As\nbefore, my wife and I took turns in doing this, I starting. The\ntracmg and the artist\u2019s original were put u]j together, one behind\nthe other.\n6. Percipients : As the experiment was intended to throw light\non the differe7ice Ijetween two conditions, I felt it desirable to secure\nthe participation of the largest possible number of percipients. I\naccordingly sent out a grand total of 484 books, of which 247 were\nA\u2019s and 237 B\u2019s. Of these, however, only 212 were returned more\nor less completely filled up. In addition, Mr J. J. Poortman, to\nwhom it was impossible to send books in time owing to war restric-\ntions, very kindly organised a group of thirty-four percipients from\nthe Dutch S.P.R., who worked on sheets of ordinary paper under\nthe same instrtictions as were issued to the other percipients. I am\nvery much obhged to Mr Poortman for his continued assistance in\ndifficult circumstances.\nThus a total of 246 complete or partially complete sets was\nreceived, of which 134 were A\u2019s and 112 B\u2019s. I should like to take\nthis opportunity of thanking all those concerned for the troixble they\ntook in enlisting percipients and distributing and collecting the\nbooks, particidarly Dr Thouless, Professor Norrish and Mr C. A.\nMace at Cambridge, Dr Mary Collins at Edinburgh, Dr Thorburn\nat Cardiff, Dr Vernon at Glasgow, Mr Rex Knight at Aberdeen,\n\f164] Experiments on Paranomud Cognition of Drawings 285\nMrs Chance at Alierystwyth, Mr Gibson at Duke University, and\nMiss Wellman of the American Society of Psychical Research.\n7. Randomisation and Scoring : The percijrients\u2019 books were all\nsent, in the first instance, to Professor Broad, who very kindly con-\nsented to randomise them in the same way that he had done for\nExpt. IV A & IV B. In this case, however, the randomisation was\nconfined to the books themselves and was not extended to the\nindividual pages of each book.\nThe books so randomised, with covers detached and each bearing\ntwo identifying letters as before, were next passed to me. I then\nscored all drawings against the ten originals used in just the same\nsort of way as Mr Hindson had scored the drawings of the first group\nof experiments against the fifty originals used in them. I adopted\nthe same plan of assigning 1, ^ or 0 to each drawing ;\nand in view\nof the success of Mr Hindson\u2019s half-point markings ^ I tried to work\non a somewhat more generous scale than I had used in my earlier\ntentative attempts.\nIt is important to note that the randomisation made it imjjossible\nfor me to distinguish between A and B sets ;\nand that consequently\nI could not, even if I had wished, favour open as comjrared with\nclosed originals, for the former came early in B sets but late in A\nsets, and vice versa.\nThe whole of the material (246 sets) was later scored again, but\nthis time against all the fifty originals prepared by Mrs Lewis, by\nmy friend Mr Fraser Nicol of Edinburgh, to whom I am very greatly\nindebted for carrying out this laborious piece of work. In this case\nhe not only did not know which sets of drawings were A\u2019s and w\u2019hich\nwere B\u2019s, because of the randomisation, but was equally ignorant\nas to W'hich of the fifty originals had been used in the experiment.\nThis second scoring not only afforded a check on my own \"work,\nbut, because it used all fifty originals instead of only ten, was capable\nof greater sensitivity, and thus gave a greater chance of detecting\nany effect which might be present. Neither scoring, however,\nyielded anything approaching a significant result.\n8. Results\n:\nIn order to meet the point raised hy IVIr Stevens in\nProc. S.P.R., Part 163, q.v., to the effect that it is illegitimate to\ngive more than one point to any percipient in respect of the same\noriginal, both Mr Fraser Nicol\u2019s markings and my own were care-\nfully \u2018\ndereplicated \u2019\nbefore computation. That is to say, wherever\nmore than one entry had been made for the same original in marking\na single set, I retained only the highest ;\nor, if there were more than\none candidate for retention, decided by a random procedure.\n^ Loc. cit. pp. 94-5.\n\f!\n280 Wlidfely Caringfon, M.A., AI.Sc.

The figures (%X) are\nPeriod ; 1 2 3 4\nW.W.C. : 48-6 45-6 70-0 59-7\nJ.F.N. ; 40-3 40-0 66-7 60-6\nWhen we reflect that the X group of originals was completely\n|\nknown throughout periods 3 and 4, quite unknown in ^Deriod 1, and \u2019\nonly progressively ascertained during period 2, these figures (which\nare easily shown to be significant) strongly suggest that knowledge\nis advantageous.\nI must freely admit that, at one time, I allowed myself to be\nmisled to this effect, and was confident that the experiment had\ndetected a significant difference between the two conditions of\n\u2018\nunknown \u2019\nand \u2018\nknown \u2019. Fortunately, however, the considera-\ntions detailed on page 282 above occurred to me before it was too\nlate ;\nand further consideration of the data convinced me that this i\neffect may be fully explained by sup].)Osing that the X originals ;\n(Book, Bow, Cigar, Lamp, Ruler) happen to be of a kind which |\npeople mostly draw later in a series of ten than they do the Y\noriginals (Chopjjer, Coat, Ffouse, Pelican, Teapot), suj^posing that ;\nthey draw any of these at all.^\n1 Since writing the above, I have had occasion to score the whole of the\nj\nmaterial of Exj^ts. I to V against aU originals used up to date, including those\n\f164] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 287\n111 order to make a valid test we must compare periods of lilie\nlateness, such as 1 and 2 or 3 and 4. Thus, in period 1, both X\nand Y originals are wholly unknown, but in jieriod 2 the X originals\nprogressively become known while the Y\u2019s do not ;\nsimilarly, the\nX\u2019s are fully known throughout periods 3 and 4, but the Y\u2019s become\nknown only in the last. And the periods are comparable, because\n1 and 2 both consist of drawings 1 to 5, for A and B percipients\nrespectively ;\nwhile 3 and 4 both consist of drawings 6 to 10 for\nB and A percipients respectively. Consequently, if there is a real\nadvantage accruing to the more known condition, there should be\na higher proportion of X\u2019s in period 2 than in period 1, and of Y\u2019s\nin period 4 than in period 3. We may examine whether this is the\ncase by means of the familiar \u201c2x2 table \u201d, using ;\nbut when\nwe do so we find a null result in every case. As a matter of fact,\nthe expected proportions are (quite insignificantly) reversed for\nperiods 1 and 2, as reference to the percentages given above will\nshow. This is found whichever figures we use ;\nbut in each case\nalso it is outweighed by a small ^^ositive effect in periods 3 and 4.\nThus, on balance, the evidence is slightly in favour of the knowm\nas compared with the unknown condition ;\nbut no result comes\nan}Twhere near significance,^ so there is nothing to be gained by\ngiving the relevant calculations here.\nWe may therefore conclude, without going into further details,\nthat these data afford no worthw;hile grounds for siqrposing that\ncontemporary knowledge of the original by the experimenter\nenhances the percipient\u2019s prospect of success.\n9. Interim Discussion : The null result reported above does not,\nof course, settle the point at issue one way or the other, for it is\nsusceptible of more interpretations than one. In the first place, it\nhere discussed. Taking the hits on X and Y originals for Early (1 to 5) and\nLate (6 to 10) positions in a 2 x 2 Table, I find\nEarly Late Total\nX Originals 46 37 83\nY \u201e 61 31 92\nTotal - 107 68 175\nThere is clearly a tendency for hits on Y originals to be made relatively\nearly. This is not significant, for the corrected value of X- is only 1-74 with P\nabout -19. On the other hand there are only 175 entries here, compared with\nmy total of 422 in Table I above. If the tendency showed itself in Expt. VI\nI\nwith the same strength as in I to V, the effect would be significant. This\nI caimot be claimed as establishing the truth of the suspicion mentioned ;\nbut\n'\nit is certainly sufficient to warrant our rejecting the prima facie indications of\nTable I.\nI\n1 The best, derived from my own figures, gives P no better than T3.\n\f288 Whafely Carington, M.A., M.Sc. '\n[part\nis ])ossil)le that the experiment simply failed to \u2018\nwork that is to Ij\nsay, that no paranormal cognition occurred nnder either condition ;\nI\nin the second, it might well be that there actually was some difference |l\nbetween the two conditions, but that the experiment was insuffi- Ij\nciently sensitive to demonstrate it. Only alter eliminating these\npossibilities would we be entitled to conclude that unknown originals |\nare as easily cognised as known. )\nIf we had obtained a significant positive result in favour of the\nknown originals, there would, I think, have been no doubt about \u2018\nthe conclusion that knowledge was at least definitely advantageous, ;\nthough we should not have proved that it was indispensable. As i\nit is, we cannot interpret the result with confidence until we have\ncomjDared the exjjeriment as a whole with the preceding experiments,\nso as to ascertain whether the percipients engaged, or either category\nof them, scored relatively more hits on the ten originals used than\non the earlier origmals, and mutatis mutandis. To do this satis-\nfactorily, we need a more detailed and more delicate method of\nmarking than can practicably be obtained from uninformed judges\nusing the roughly graded scale of 1, \\ or 0. I accordingly propose\nto postpone further discussion of this experiment until after I have\ncompleted an imjmoved scoring of Experiments I to VII.\nThe question of sensitivity, however, deserves a note here. The\ntotal number of drawings involved is approximately equal to the\nnumber obtained during the first five experiments ;\nso that it would\nbe not unreasonable to expect a significant result if there were a\nreal difference between the two conditions. On the other hand,\nintervals ranging from five days to about as many weeks were\nallowed to elapse between constituent experiments of the first group,\nwhereas the twenty \u2018\nex|30sures \u2019\nof this experiment were made on\nconsecutive evenings. If precognitive and retrocognitive effects be\nreal, as the results described in my first paper suggest, this is likely\nto lead to a confusion between the two conditions having nothing\nto do with their intrinsic merits. That is to say, percipients of the j\nfirst period might score precognitively on originals known only in\nthe second ;\nor percipients of the third might score precognitively\non the originals of the fourth or retrocognitively on those of the\nsecond. The first two of these effects would tend to obscure any\ndifference between the two conditions that there might be ;\nthe\nthird would tend, per se, spuriously to enhance it, but it must be\nremembered that, from the arrangement of the experiment, the X '\noriginals are known to the experimenter during period 3, quite apart |\nfrom any true retrocognition on the part of the percipients. Thus j\nfactors of this kind, if operative, would tend on balance to obscure\n\f164]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 289\nthe effect we are looking for, and 1 am inclined to attril^nte the\ninconclusive result mainly to this cause. Clertainly, if 1 had reahsed\nthen as clearly as I do now the extreme importance of time as a\nfactor in the process, I should have tried to arrange for intervals\nof at least two weeks between the various experimental periods.\nAs it is, comparisons between the numbers of hits scored on X\nand Y originals in periods 1 and 2, or in 3 and 4, do not properly\ncorrespond to comparisons between hits scored in different experi-\nments separated by an adequate tune interval ;\nthe correspondence\nis rather with comjrarisons between the first and second halves of\nthe same experiment.

Experiment VII : First \u2018\nInter-University \u2019\nExperiment\nABSTEACT : Each of five \u2018 primary \u2019\nExperimenters prepared and\ndisplayed ten randomly selected Originals on ten successive nights,\nat Glasgow, Edinburgh, Oxford, Bristol and Beading. Attempts to\nreproduce these were made by five associated groups of percipients\nand also by five other groups organised by \u2018\nsecondary \u2019\nExperimenters\nat Leeds, Cardiff, Birmingham, London and Cambridge.\nTaken as a whole, the experiment appears to have been intrinsi-\ncally successful, but the percipients of particular groups did not\nsucceed in scoring relatively more hits on the originals intended for\ntheir groups than did the percipients of other groups. That is to\nsay, something in the nature of \u2018\ncross -influence \u2019\nor the equivalent\nseems to have been operative in an important degree.\nSome further evidence of precognitive and retrocognitive effects\nwas also found.\nA tentative theory of paranormal cognition is advanced.\n1 . I'jitroductory : In the present state of our knowledge of Para-\nnormal Cognition there are two main lines along which we must |\ntry to progress. In the first place we must devise and perform I\nexperiments of a specific or ad hoc character with a view to throwing\nlight on the nature of the process involved and the conditions of I\nits occurrence ;\nin the second, we must develop a repeatable tech- i\nnique and do our best to induce independent experimenters, par- |\nticularly psychologists, to apply it. Experiment VI, which I have\njust described, is a not very successful example of the first class,\nwhile Experiment VII, discussed below, was mainly intended as a\npreliminary first steji in the second direction.\nI have long felt strongly that this whole question of repeatability,\nand of actual repetition by others, is of the very greatest importance.\nIn the long run, a subject can no more be firmly established on the ^\nwork of one or two individual experimenters, however fortunate or\ngifted they may be, than on the performances of one or two per-\ncipients of no more than transitory brilliance. I was accordingly\nvery anxious to arrange as soon as possible for experiments to be\ncarried out, on the same general lines as my first five, in which i\neverything of major importance should be done by some person or\npersons other than myself and in such a way that no amount of\nbias, or even malfeasance, on my part could affect the issue. In\nthis way I hoped to obtain independent confirmation of my results, I\nto spread interest in the subject, and to provide for the work a\n\f164]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 291\nsomewhat wider basis than could be afforded by the activities of\na single individual.\nThere were, however, and still are, considerable difficulties in the\nway of reahsing any such project. I had virtually no doubt at the\ntime I first envisaged the plan, and have less now, that anyone who\ncould arrange to conduct five \u2018\nten evening \u2019\nexperiments, spaced\nover as many months and employing about fifty percipients each,\nwould obtain results of the same kind as I had found, but such a\nprogramme involves something very like full time work, as I well\nknow, and is far more than one could possibly expect any profes-\nsional psychologist, already well occupied with his ordinary duties,\nto undertake. Besides, it was by no means certain that there would\nbe many, if any, to be found who would consider the subject suffi-\nciently advanced to warrant the expenditure of so much time and\nenergy, even if they could spare them.\nIt was accordingly clear that the only hope was to arrange some-\nthing on co-operative lines, so that the work could be shared among\nseveral experimenters, each of whom would make some not pro-\nhibitively laborious contribution, and in such a way that by com-\nbining these contributions a significant result might be obtained.\nEven so, and assuming that the requisite co-operation could be\nsecured, I was faced with the difficult question or whether to aim\nat a succession of (say) five experiments well separated in time,\nmore or less as my own five had been, or whether to permit experi-\nmenters to suit their own convenience, with the consequent hkeli-\nhood of some considerable overlap between the periods of the con-\nstituent experiments. I had, of course, no doubt at all that the\nfirst plan would be preferable\u2014^partly because it would reproduce\nmore accurately the procedure of which I hoped to confirm the\nresults, and partly because I was very much alive to the possibility\nthat some kind of cross-influence between experunenters or per-\ncipients or both might tend to obscure the effects sought. Against\nthis, I had considerable doubts as to whether such a plan would be\npracticable, at least within the limits of time I judged it reasonable\nto allot to it. Most, if not all, of those whom I proposed to approach\nwere subject to the limitations of University terms, particularly as\nregards the availability of percipients ;\nconsequently, it would\nprobably have been difficult to arrange for more than one separate\nexperiment in each term time, and this would have meant s^^reading\nthe work over more than a year. Moreover, though I have no wish to\nbe alarmist or despondent, even in retrospect, there was a not wholly\nnegligible risk that if the proceedings were unduly protracted it might\nprove impossible to conclude them without external interference.\n\f292 Whately Carington, 31.A., 31.Sc. [part\nI therefore decided to arrange, if I could, for five independent\nexperiments to be carried out by five different experimenters, but\nto put up with whatever complications might be caused by such\noverlap in time as might be found unavoidable. Apart from the\nuse of a plurality of experimenters instead of one, this would corre-\nspond very fairly closely to the structure of my first group, except\nthat the constituent experiments would be mainly separated in\nspace and not in time. I reflected that, if my misgivings as to cross-\ninfluences were unfounded, I ought to be able, by arranging for all\ndrawings to be scored \u2018\nblind \u2019\nagainst all originals as before, to\nobtain a significant positive result ;\nif they were not, then it should\nbe possible to demonstrate the fact by scoring the whole of the\ndrawings of the fii\u2019st five experiments and of the five sections of\nthis against the hundred originals used in both, and the resulting\nevidence of cross-influence (if any were found) could hardly fail to\nbe of great interest.\nI have little dorrbt that this decision was correct in the circum-\nstances prevailing at the time ;\nand I certainly do not regret it,\neven though I consider that it prevented me from obtaining the\nstraightforward confirmation of my results which I had in some\ndegree allowed myself to hope for. Prophecy is always rash, and\nI should be sorry to commit myself at the present stage ;\nbut I am\nstrongly inclined to suspect that the outcome of this experiment,\nwhich strongly suggests something equivalent to cross-influence,\nwill be found to mark a milestone in our understanding of what is\ngoing on at least comparable to the realisation of the fact of dis-\nplacement forced on our notice by Experiment II.\n^\n2. The Notion of Cross-influence : I think this question of possible\ncross-influence deserves a short digressive section to itself before\nI go on to describe the actual experiment.\nThe first five experiments gave us good grounds for supposing\nthat paranormal cognition occurs, but they told us nothing as to\nhow the percipient contrives to cognise the right drawing out of\nall the millions in the world, or the right element of mental content\nout of the many thousands which must have passed daily through\nthe ex]rerimenters\u2019 minds ; or even how those particular minds were\nselected out of the mass of humanity. I do not suppose that I had\nwittingly so much as set eyes on more than forty or fifty of the 250\nwho took part, and was not on terms approaching intimacy with\nmore than perhaps ten or a dozen : similarly, it is unlikely that\ngreater numbers than these knew where Fitzwilliam Road was or\nhad ever passed along it. Tims it seems out of the question to\n1 Cf. PNC.D. I, p. 54.\n\f164] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 293\npostulate any direct personal rapport ;\non the other hand, the sup-\nposition that adequate jisychological linkage with, for example, the\npercipients of Duke University was provided by my correspondence\nwith Dr Rhine and his personal contact with them appears an\nextremely tenuous and unconvincing hypothesis.\nIt accordingly seemed at least possible that, if two or more experi-\nmenters were working at once, percipients might \u2018\n]hck up \u2019\nimpres-\nsions from any or all of them indiscriminately : alternatively, per-\ncipients might \u2018\nrelay \u2019\nimpressions to each other by what one might\nterm a sort of \u2018\nlateral \u2019\ntelepathy ;\nor both these processes might\noperate together. It was on account of considerations such as these,\nwhich were fully justified by the event, that I should much have\npreferred a succession of experiments separated in time to a group\nof which the constituent members overlapped.\n3. Organisation of the Experiment\n:\nIn the hope of securing the\nrequisite co-operation, I approached a number of psychologists,\nphilosophers, and others of like qualifications and interests, in the\nprincipal universities of the British Isles. The response was most\ngratifying. Three or four, not unnaturally in the circumstances,\npleaded pressure of work and war-time conditions, and begged to\nbe excused ;\nbut I had no great difficulty in finding ten, in ten\ndifferent Universities, who were willing to cooperate in greater or\nless degree according to their opportunities. I should like here to\nexpress my most cordial gratitude for their help and my w'arni\nappreciation of the way in which, at what must often have been\nvery considerable inconvenience to themselves, they supported me\nin this exploratory enterprise into unfamiliar and clebateable terri-\ntory ;\nand my feelings are enhanced by the fact that nearly all\nthose concerned, and one or two newcomers also, have consented to\ncontinue the work with further experiments now in progress.\nIt will readily be understood that it was not until I knew, at\nany rate approximately, the niunber of co-operators available that\nI could finally decide on the form the experiment should take. The\ngeneral plan, of course, was that each of, say, five or six experi-\nmenters should conduct an independent \u2018\nten evening \u2019\nexperiment,\non the lines of my own Expts. I, III, IV & V, wfith his own group\nof percipients ;\nand that the dra\u2019svings of all percipients, suitably\nrandomised, should be scored \u2018\nblind \u2019\nagainst all originals in the\nsame way that Mr Hindson scored the drawings of the first five\nexperiments against the fifty originals used in them. The somewhat\nqualified hope (for the reasons given above it would be incorrect to\nsay \u2018\nexpectation \u2019) was that when these scores were arranged in a\nsuitable 5 x 5 (or 6 x 6) Table, they would show that the percipients\n\f294 Whatehj Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part ii\nused by each experimenter had scored, to a significant extent,\nrelatively more hits on the originals dra^vn by him than on those\nj\ni\ndrawn by the other experimenters. There was, however, the diiii- '\nculty that, if too many experimenters took part in this way, the i\nnumber of originals might easily become unmanageable from the 1\nscorer\u2019s point of view\u2014even though I had been so fortunate as {\nagain to secure the help of Mr. Hindson in this connection ;\nmore- '\nover, not all of those who expressed their willingness to cooperate\nwere able to undertake the full duties of a ten-evening experi-\nmenter.\nI therefore decided to organise the experiment in two ranks, as\njj\nit were, with five \u2018 primary \u2019\nexperimenters each doing a full ten-\n'\nevening experiment on his own and with his owir group of per-\ncij^ients, and five \u2018\nsecondary \u2019\nexperimenters who had the less\nonerous task of enlisting the services of percipients, distributing\nand collecting books, etc., without drawing any originals them-\nselves. Each secondary experimenter and group of percijrients was\nassociated (randomly) with one of the primary experimenters, and\nthe percipients were asked to \u2018\naim at \u2019\nthe drawings produced by\nhim ;\nthey were not told that other experimenters and groups were\nworking at the same time. My idea was that, if knowledge of or\npersonal contact with the experimenter played any part in the pro-\ncess, the secondary groups might reasonably be expected to do less\nwell than the primary, or even to yield a null result while the\nprimary groups yielded a significant one, and that some effect of\nthis kind might throw useful light on what was taking place.\nThe locations and names of the experimenters, their identifying\nletters, and the numbers of percipients taking part (neglecting two\nor three who returned nothing but blank sheets) are given in Table I\nbelow ;\nTable I\nIdentifying No. of\nLetter Place Plxpcrimenter Percipients\nPrimary Experimenters\nA Glasgow Dr P.

Percipients\u2019 Books : The books sent out for distribution to\nthe percipients were identically similar in their main features to\nthose used in earher experiments. The name and address of the\nexperimenter whose originals the percipient was desired to repro-\nduce was printed on the cover of the book in each case ;\nfor\nexample, the books sent to both Edinburgh and Cardiff had the\nwords\nIn your case the arrangements ivill be made by\nDr. Collins,\nPsychological Department,\nThe University,\nEdinburgh.\nand similar wording, mutatis mutandis, appeared on the books sent\nto other groups.\nThe instruction introduced in Expt. VI, viz., \u201c Do not draw\nvague scenes, elaborate interiors, or purely geometrical diagrams\n\u201d\nwas retained with the qualification \u201c unless your impressions are\nparticularly vivid.\u201d\nIn an attempt to help the percipients, the following words were\ninserted, \u201c Do not strain after obtaining \u2018\noccult \u2019\nimpressions\nunless you feel you must. Probably the best plan is to think of\nthe experiment in a general way, to reject images of which you\nclearly recognise the source, and then draw the first thing that\n\f296 Whately Carington, 31.A., 31. Sc. [part\ncomes.\u201d The part of this from \u201c to reject \u201d to \u201c the source \u201d was j\nalmost certainly an error of judgment. Instead of merely eluuin- ,\nating certain kinds of trite and irrelevant drawings, as I had\nhoped, it seems to have embarrassed the percipients and to\nhave led in some cases to earnest introspectionists reporting that\nthey could not think of anything of which the source was not\nrecognisable.\nSince there was no question of \u2018\nmatching \u2019\nin this experiment, ]\nthe ten sheets of each book were numbered, for convenience of later I\nreference, in the toj) right-hand corners instead of beyond the I\nperforations to the left as in previous books.\n*\n5. Selection of Originals : I was anxious that each primary experi-\nmenter should himself carry out as much of the essential procedure\nas possilde, and that I myself should have no means of knowing\nwhat originals were being displayed where and by whom. On the\nother hand, I thought it might lead to confusion if originals\nwhich had been used in the first six experiments were to be used\nagain.\nI accordingly prepared a list of 150 words, mainly but not ex-\nclusively taken from the list of 216 which had been sent to Mrs\nLewis for Expt. VI (vide supra) and not containing any of the fifty\nwhich had been illustrated by her. I wrote each of these Avords on\na separate slip of paper, occasionally with a brief indication of the\nkind of illustration I desired, enclosed each of these slips in a\nseparate envelope, and finally shuffled the lot. These 150 envelopes\nwere then sent to Professor H. H. Price, our President, who very\nkindly reshuffled them and, in due course as notified by me, sent a\nrandojn selection of thirty to each of the five primary experimenters.\nEach of these experimenters was told to draAv one envelope at\nrandom from the thirty supplied, on each evening of his experiment,\nand to illustrate the word therein as his original for that evening.\nExperimenters were told that they might reject the word if they\nwished, e.g., if they thought it too difficult to illustrate ;\nbut\" that,\nif they did so, they were to re])lace the slip in the envelope, mark\nthe latter \u2018\nrejected \u2019\nwith the date of rejection, and return it\nwith the other envelo])es and slips when the experiment was over ;\nthere were, however, only two or three instances of this being\ndone.\n6. Display of Originals, etc. : Originals were actually selected,\nprepared and \u2018\ndisplayed \u2019\nby Primary Experimenters as shown in\nTable 2 below :\n\f164]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 297\nTable II\nDate,\nMay,\n1940 Glasgow Edinburgh Oxford Bristol Reading\n8 Corkscrew\n9 Fireplace\n10 Caterpillar Box\n11 Braces Chimney\n12 Toothbrush Camera\n13 Screwdriver Easel\n14 Crown Knife\n15 Tent Motor Horn Lily Unicorn\n16 Cock Pincers Key Cup\n17 Golf Club Sheep Rake Star\n18 Ladder Thermos Volcano\n19 Spring Catapult Wringer\n20 Carrot Stool\n21 Comb Funnel Harp\n22 Pillar Box Pickaxe Perambulator\n23 Ace of Clubs Elephant Spanner\n24 Church Safety Pin Bowl\n25 Tumbler\n26 Telephone\n27 Pansy\n28 Locomotive\n29 Thermometer\n30 Watering Can\nIt will be seen that there was a very heavy overlap. All fifty\noriginals were drawn and displayed in the course of no more than\ntwenty-three evenings. On tliree evenings there were four originals\ndisplayed at once, on six there were three, on six there were two,\nwhile only on eight had a single original the field to itself.\nThe only points worth noting about the foregoing fist of originals\nare the following : Braces\u2014trousers, not ship ;\nCock\u2014rooster, not\ntap ;\nGolf Club\u2014instrimient, not house ;\nSpring\u2014mechanical\n(hehcal), not vernal ;\nBox\u2014specified to be with lid open ;\nChimney\n\u2014as in factory ;\nKnife\u2014table, not pocket ;\nMotor Horn\u2014old-\nfashioned kind wdth bulb ;\nRake\u2014garden, not profligate ;\nCup\n\u2014\nspecified to be without saucer, see Section 12 below ;\nStar\u2014con-\nventional five-pointed ;\nStool\u2014three-legged, as for milking, not\nfoot ;\nFunnel\u2014as in chemistry, not steamboats.\nAll experimenters had of course been most straitly charged, in\nthe Memorandum of Instructions circulated to them, to take the\nsame rigorous precautions about safeguarding the originals from all\n\f298 Whately Carington, M.A., 31.Sc. [part\npossil)ility of l^eing seen the percipients, or unautliorised persons,\nas I had taken in my first five experiments. I have no doubt at\nall that all concerned fully realised the imjjortance of this, and\nconscientiously carried out the relevant instructions.\n7. Randomisation of Dravings, etc. : Each experimenter collected\nthe completed books from his group of percipients and sent them\nto Professor Price at Oxford, who randomised them in the same\nway that Professor Broad had done with the books of Expts. IV,\nV and VI, before sending them on to the scorer. As in the case\nof Expt. VI, randomisation was confined to the books as wholes\nand was not extended to individual sheets. Each book was given\na pair of identifying letters, which were entered on the outer cover\nand on the first page ;\nthe cover was then torn off and kept by\nProfessor Price, together with the key to the identifying letters, ,\nuntil after the scoring had been done. I am very much indebted\nto Professor Price for the trouble he took in this matter and for\ndealing, as mentioned above, with the shuffling and distribution of\nthe envelopes for. selection of originals.\nPrimary experimenters sent their originals to Dr P. H. Thouless,\nwho kindly arranged them in alphaljetical order and forwarded them\nto Mr Hindson for use in scoring.\nIt will be noticed that this process of randomisation, though\nsimilar in effect, was somewhat different in plan from that adopted\nfor the first five experiments. Arrangement in alphabetical order\nwould not conceal similarities in style or mode of production between\nthe originals drawn by any given experimenter ;\nthus, though the\nscorer woidd have no idea as to which originals were produced by\nwhich experunenter, he might easily be able to form an opinion to\nthe effect that certain originals belonged together, and this might\nconceivably have led to the operation of some measure of bias. It\nwas therefore necessary to rely primarily on the randomisation of\nthe books themselves ;\nthe sending of the originals via Dr Thouless\nwas mainly in order to ensure that I myself had nothing to do with\nthe matter.\n8. Hindson Scoring\n:\nAs already intimated, I was so fortunate\nas again to secure the services of Mr M. T. Hindson as scorer, and\nI must again express my most cordial thanks for his good offices\nin the work.\nI asked him to apply precisely the same principles as before, but\nwith the additional refinement of using three-quarter and quarter\npoints as well as full and half ]>oints. I hoped that this more finely\ngraduated mode of scoring might throw light on the relation (if\nany) between the strength of resemblance of a drawing to an original\n\f164] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 299\nand the likelihood of the former l)eing a \u2018\nwinner \u2019\n;\nthat is to say,\nI thought it possible that the full points might give a stronger result\nthan the three-quarters, the three-quarters than the halves, and the\nhalves than the quarters, or something like this : actually, however,\nall categories gave null results, so that my hopes in this connection\nwere disapjrointed.\n1 have discussed the whole question of scoring so carefully in my\nformer paper that I need not go into it again here, excejrt to remind\nreaders that the essential condition of uninformedness on the part\nof the judge was as well fulfilled in this case as in the earlier.\n9. Results, (a) By Inspection : It needed no more than a rela-\ntively hasty skimming through the drawings received, by anyone\nfamiliar with those of the first five experiments, to create a strong\nimpression that this experiment had been strikingly successful in\nthe sense that the percipients had scored a notable number of hits\non the originals used in it as compared with the percipients of the\nearlier experiments. The following examples show the kind of thing\nI mean. The figure preceding the name of the original indicates\nthe number of hits scored by the 227 percipients of this experunent\nwhile that in brackets gives the number scored by the 251 per-\ncipients of Expts. I to V. Thus, there were umnistakably 5 Tooth-\nbrushes (0), 3 Corkscrews (0), 1 Safety Pin (0), 3 Cameras (0), 5 Pillar\nBoxes (0), 12 Elephants (1), 16 Locomotives (7), 8 Watering Cans (2),\nand so forth : these are the high lights only, and the list is not\nexhaustive.^ This sort of thing is legitimately impressive to the\nexperienced eye, but it is not to be considered as rigid evidence,\nand I shall return below to this question of the success of the\nexperiment as a whole.\n10. Results, Continued, (6) Hindson Scoring : So soon as I had\nreceived the drawings and scoring sheets from Mr Hindson, .and\nthe key to the identifying letters from Professor Price, I set to\nwork to prepare 5x5 Tables, corresponding to Table I of my first\npaper, q.v., showing the hits scored by the percipients of Groups A,\nB, C, etc., and a, b, c, etc., on the originals displayed by the experi-\nmenters of A, B, C, etc. As in Experiment VI, and henceforward\nunless otherwise stated, I used \u2018\nderephcated \u2019\nor \u2018\nnett \u2019\nfigures ;\nthat is to say, no set of drawings was allowed to score more than\none hit on any single original.^\nExamination of these tables made it abundantly clear that, how-\nIt wiU be understood that these figures were the resMt of a relatively\nsuperficial inspection of the two sets of material ;\nthey are given by way of\njustification of the impression received, not as final or authoritative results.\n2 Cf.

As before,\n0 stands for the observed numl)er of hits scored by the percipients\non the originals at which they were supposed to be aiming, i.e.,\nthe number in the leading diagonal ;\nE is the expected number of\nsuch hits obtained from the marginal totals ;\nD is 0 - E ;\n\u2018\nct \u2019\nis\nthe standard error calculated by the method just referred to.\nIt is evident that the only points worthy of mention are the\nnegative deviation shown by the primary groups and the somewhat\nunnaturally close agreement of the Observed with the Exjpected\nnumber of hits in the case of the secondary groups. Both effects,\nhowever, may safely be neglected here. The first is perhaps the\nmore curious, because we should naturally expect some shght\npositive result, however much \u2018\ncross influence \u2019\nmight be going on ;\nbut it is quite trivial. The second effect is intrinsically significant\n;\non the other hand, it is, so to put it, the best of two, so that the value\nof (1 - P), which is what interests us here, must be doubled, leaving\nus with a probability just below the recognised level of significance.\nThe results make it clear that there is no tendency for the per-\ncipients of a given group, whether primary or secondary, to score\nrelatively more hits on the originals displayed by the associated\nexperimenter than on those displayed by others. In other words,\nso far as this, the principal overt objective of the experiment is\nconcerned, the results are completely null.\n1 1 . Results, Continued, (c) Manning-Sanders Scoring\n:\nThe con-\nclusion stated above renders it a matter of no small importance to\nascertain as definitely as possible whether the remarkable successes\nrecorded in Section 9 above were fortuitous, and the whole of the\npercipients\u2019 drawings no more than chance-determined, or whether\nthey were genuine and the failure of the groups to \u2018\nseparate out\n\u2019\nconsequently attributable to the overlap of the experiments or to\nwhat I have referred to as \u2018\ncross influence \u2019. If the former alter-\nnative is true, then something has gone sadly and seriously wwong\nwith the technique ;\nif the latter, then we are hkely to find ourselves\nled to conclusions of very great interest indeed.\nThe only way to do this is to compare the drawings of this experi-\nment, taken together, wdth those of some other experiment or\nexperiments, in respect of the hits scored on their own and each\nother\u2019s originals\u2014in much the same way that we did when we were\nfirst enquiring as to whether there was any paranormal effect at all.\nThe obvious material to use is that of the first five experiments,\nfor it would be scarcely practicable to organise another complete\nexperiment of the type of VII specially as a \u2018\ncontrol \u2019.\nTo do so involves finding a fresh unbiassed {i.e., uninformed)\n\f302 Whafely Carington, M.A., M.Sc.

I\nshould like here to ex])ress my very great indebtedness to him for\nthis most timely assistance.\nThe method of scoring was the 1, .j,\nor 0 point system used by\nMr Hindson in scoring the first five experiments ;\nbut, as before,\nI have found it simpler, and sufficiently effective, to treat all entries\nas of equal value. The 100 originals were arranged in alphabetical\norder (more for convenience of reference than for the sake of ran-\ndomisation), while the drawings bore no indication of the experiment\nto wliich they belonged and were presented in an arbitrary order as\nsuitably code-lettered volumes each containing on the average some\nfifteen to twenty sets. Thus the scorer had no possible means of\nknowing which drawings had been aimed at which originals, and the\nnecessary condition of \u2018\nblindness \u2019\nwas fulfilled.\nMr Manning-Sanders will not, I know, resent my saying that his\nrelevant forte is in the appreciation of form rather than in the\nniceties of clerical meticulosity ;\nmoreover, external circumstances\nprevented hmi from devoting as much time to the task as we could\nboth have wished. It is not surprising, therefore, that his work\nshows a considerable niimber of omissions, with the result that his\nscoring is considerably \u2018\nweaker \u2019, so to say, than Mr Hindson\u2019s. ,\nThus, for Expts. I to V, Mr Hindson recorded a total of 1,069 nett ;\n{i.e.\n\u2018\ndereplicated \u2019) entries, and these led to a value of D\/a of 3-803\nwith P about 1 in 7,000 ;\nMr Manning-Sanders records only 310, )\nwith Djar 2-575 and P -01 . This is definitely significant, though the '\ndebilitating effect of the omis.sions is very marked. The quality\n(100 D\/N) of Mr Manning-Sanders\u2019 result is somewhat higher than\nthat of Mr Hindson\u2019s, the values being 5-61 and 4-30 in the two\ncases respectively, wliich suggests that Mr Manning-Sanders has\nsomewhat hastily skimmed the cream off the milk by picking only\nthe more obvious hits.^ This reduction in significance is, of course,\nmerely the result of relatively bad\n\u2014\ni.e. hurried\u2014scoring ;\nit does\nnot imply that the data are really less significant than Mr Hindson\u2019s\nresults indicated.\nMr Manning-Sanders\u2019 full results for Expts. I to V and VII are\nshown in Table IV :\nI\n1 Compare the figures for the \u2018\nundoubted \u2019\nhits shown in the last column ,\nof Table 5 of my previous paper.\n\f164] Exjjerimenfs on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 303\nTable IV\nHits by the drawings of\nI II III IV V VII Total\nI 10 77\nII 44 72\nOn the III 4 142\nOriginals IV 28 103\nof V 40 237\nVII 248 431\nTotal 72 29 34 216 142 569 1061\n0 is 334 ;\nE is 295-29 ;\n\u2014 D is 38-71 ;\nD\/a is 3-022 ;\nP less than -01\nThis result is significant ;\nbut the contribution made by Expt.\nVII is relatively small, though positive, so that we are not entitled\nto say much more on these grounds than that the figures are con-\nsonant with the supposition that the experiment is of the same\nfamily as its predecessors. This supposition appears reasonable on\ngeneral grounds and is strongly supported by the evidence from\ninspection. I accordingly projjose to adopt it for the purposes of\ndiscussion in Section 13 below ;\nbut it must be regarded as no more\nthan provisional pending the application of more thorough methods\nof scoring.\n12. Various Points of [nterest\n:\nThe first of these is that of the\nLeeds False Starters. It so happened that, through an error on the\npart of a temporary typing assistant, the covering letter of instruc-\ntions was not sent to Professor Price with the 150 envelopes for\ndistribution to the experimenters. The result was that Dr Vernon,\nat Glasgow, did not receive his envelopes when he should have and\ntherefore could not start on 1st May as had been planned. I did\nnot know this, and therefore could not warn Leeds. Consequently,\nthe Leeds percipients started trying to reproduce non-existent\nGlasgow originals, and made some five or six attempts each before\nI discovered what had happened and asked Dr Wynn Jones to stop\nthem. They w^ere afterwards so good as to restart and finish the\ncourse.\nThe \u2018\nfalse start \u2019\ndrawings, however, were of remarkable interest.\nThey contained two Crowns, one Toothbrush, one Church Steeple,\none Ladder, one Easel, two Bowls, one Hen (good enough for Cock),\none W atering Can, one Camera, one Elephant, one Key, one Rake\n\f304 Whately Carmgton, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nand one Knife. All these from sixteen ])ercipients producing sixty- -\none jDages of drawings. These were included incognito in the material i\nsubmitted to Mr Manning-Sanders for scoring. Unfortunately, only\ntwelve of the above-mentioned hits were noted ;\nbut, even so, we\nfind (using Expts. I and II only as a basis of comparison) ^\n:\nTable VI\nHits by the drawings of\nI & II L.F.S. Total\nOn the I & II 28 2 30\nOriginals of VII 30 12 42\nTotal 58 14 72\nUsing the exact method ^ we find P slightly less than -02.\nI have no desire to press this result unduly on those who suffer\nfrom a congenital antipathy to precognition, but it is certainly\ninteresting and, in its owm way, as elegant a piece of evidence in\nfavour of the phenomenon as any I have come across\u2014and all the\nbetter rather than the worse, I think, for its imprevu character.\nSecond : As already noted, I specified (just to make it more\ninteresting) that the Cup should be saucerless. A good number of\nsaucerless cups w'ere drawn, though I am not yet sure whether there\nwere relatively more of these than in earlier experiments. But one\npercipient drew a cup and saucer, crossed it out, and then drew a\nsaucerless Cup ;\nanother drew a saucerless Cup, and added a note\nsaying \u201c wanted to draw a saucer, but this was inhibited \u201d. (My\nitalics.)\nThird ; The Stool was represented as a round-topped, three-\nlegged type ;\none percipient drew, very carefully, a rectangular\nstool, and left out one of the four legs. This may, of course, have\nbeen an accident, despite the evident care of the rest of the drawing ;\nbut it is pleasantly suggestive of the \u2018 psychopathology of error \u2019,\nand suggests that ]jrocesses with which we are familiar in everyday\nlife are operative in this field also.\n13. Discussion ; Tentative Theory of Paranormal Cognition : I am\nall in favour of caution of the right kind and in the proper place ;\n^ I use Expts. I & II only because, if there is a real precognitive effect such\nas we are lookhig for, it is likely that the drawings of IV & V will show an\nunduly high proportion of hits on the originals of VII, and this would tend to\nmask the Leeds precognitions, whereas, if there is none, Expts. I & II are\njust as good a basis for comparison as any other data. The procedure may\nseem a trifle arbitrary, but I think it is legitimate in the circumstances, and\nthe whole matter is raised only as a point of interest.\n\u2018\u2018\u2018\nFisher, Statistical Methods for Research Workers, 21-02.\n\f164] Experiments on Paranonncd Cognition of Drawings 305\nbut we so urgently need some kind of a unifying theory in this\nsubject that I feel it would l)e mere jmsillaniniity, and not true\ncaution at ail, to refrain from describing the conclusions to which\nthese results have led me, just because I may be obliged to revise\nthem later. The true caution will lie in preserving tiie necessary\nreadiness to do so if ever the evidence requires it.\nAcceptmg, then, for the purposes of discussion, the sujDposition\nthat paranormal cognition occurred in Expt. VII, as it did in Expts.\nI to V, if perhaps not to the same degree, its outstanding feature is\nclearly the complete failure of the percipients to distinguish between\nthe originals produced by their \u2018\nown \u2019\nexperimenter and those pro-\nduced by others. Just how strange or how natural this will appear\nto my readers I cannot tell, since it will depend on their precon-\nceptions, with which I am not famihar. But it certainly does not\nseem particularly surprising to me, for I can find no good reason\nfor postulating any kind of \u2018\nrapport \u2019, or any but the most tenuous\n\u2018\npsychological linkage between the great majority of the per-\ncipients of the first five experiments and myself ;\nand at best, it\nseems to me, such terms as \u2018\nrapport \u2019\nand \u2018\npsychological linkage\n\u2019\nare little more than disguises of ignorance. Thus it would be un-\nreasonable to expect that any rapport or linkage there might be\nbetween individual experimenters and the associated percipients\nwould noticeably facilitate the process involved. On the contrary,\nI think that, if the various groups of percipients had succeeded in,\nso to say, identifying their \u2018\nown \u2019\nsets of originals, we should have\nhad the greatest possible difficulty in explaining how they did so.\nAs it is, there seem to me to be three main types of theory worth\nconsidering. I will deal with these briefly in order of inq^lausibility.\nFirst, there is our old enemy the Radiation Hjqjothesis, the\ninadequacy of which I\u2014in common with many other writers\u2014have\ndiscussed elsewhere.^ So far as the j^resent series of experiments\nis concerned I should rule it out of court on the ground that the\nmost spatially remote group of percipients participating were out-\nstandingly successful 2\u2014a fact which it would be extremely difficult\nto reconcile with any radiative theory whatever.\nSecond, we might do something with a kind of Corpuscular\nTheory, in which some hypothetical entity, to be called \u2018\nan Idea \u2019,\nconceived of as in some manner emanating from the mind of the\nexperimenter might be picked up and assimilated by that of the\n1 For the latest contribution, c\/. Professor Price\u2019s excellent paper \u201c Some\nPhilosophical Questions about Telepathy and Clairvoyance \u201d in Philosophy,\nOct. 1940.\n2 PNC.D., I, 61-2.\n\f300 Whatehj Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\njjercipient. 1 should not reject such a theory merely because it ,\nsounded a trifle fantastic\u2014for what could be more fantastic than ;\nthe present-day irreducibles of physics?\u2014and I have no objection\nto postulating strange hypothetical entities provided we are careful\nto define them solely in terms of the observations made upon them.\nIndeed, at one period, I flirted seriously with such conceptions as i\nthese, and thought it jjossible (as indeed I still do) that, given care ;\nand a little judicious juggling with Space and Time\u2014and perhaps\nNumber\u2014one might construct from them a not wholly implausible\ntheory, which might even make some useful contribution to orthodox\npsychology. But I finally discarded them\u2014mainly because I shrink i\nfrom multij^lying irreducibles beyond necessity\u2014in favour of the\nsimpler if perha ps more drastic view which I shall now try to explain.\nThe third type of theory is of a kind which I shall call, tem-\nporarily and for the sake of brevity, the One Mind type. I am\nquite well aware of the sliortcomings of such a name for it, and ;\nparticularly of the fact that, for all purposes of ordinary discussion, j\nwe are dealing with an undoul)ted plurality of what are usually i\ntermed \u2018\nminds \u2019.\nBut the essence of any theory of this type is the\nsupposition that, so far as these pltenornena are concerned, or, if you\nprefer it, at the psychological level on vdrich. they occur, things happen\nas if not many minds were involved, but only one.\nThere is nothing startlingly new in this, for plenty of writers, both\npsychologists and ])hilosophers, have put forward the notion of a\ncommon Subconscious or Unconscious, in one form or another. The\nnovel and possibly revolutionary suggestion I have to make is that\nwe should try the effect of taking such proposals seriously and as\nbeing literally true within their sphere of relevance, instead of\ntreating them as mere exhibitions of intellectual virtuosity and\npassing on our way as if they had never been advanced.\nLet us do this, and let us further, subject always to the reservation\nitalicised above, examine the suggestion that the phenomenon of\nparanormal cognition occurring in the joint mind made up of the\nexperimenters\u2019 and the percipients\u2019 \u2018\nsub-minds \u2019\nis identical with\nthat familiar phenomenon of the single mind known as The Associa-\ntion of Ideas\u2014to use a slightly antiquated but still serviceable\nphrase.\nI do not jRopose to enter upon a detailed logical analysis of what\nthis phrase means or ought to mean ;\nand so far as the term Idea\nis concerned it will be sufficient for the present purpose to say that\nby it I refer to the image or images which occupy or approach the\nfield of consciousness when we think of the entity in question\u2014for\nexample, when we think of Boat we probably have an image of\n\f164] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 307\nsome particular (or may be imaginary) boat, while images of waves,\nbeaches, oars, sails, anchors and what not are \u2018\nnearer \u2019\n{i.e. more\nlikely to appear in) our field of consciousness than at most other\ntimes.\n;\nThe term Association, bn the other hand, demands somewhat\nmore careful discussion. The process which interests us here con-\nsists of not less than two parts ;\nfirst an \u2018\nassociative \u2019\nevent, in\nwhich two ideas, of X and of Y, become as it were linked in our\nminds by virtue of juxtaposition in experience or otherwise ;\nsecond\na \u2018\nrevocative \u2019\nevent in which the re-presentation of the object X,\nsay, or the recurrence of the idea of X, recalls or tends to recall the\nidea of Y. There may, of course, be many associative events, and\nmany more than two ideas may be associated ;\nbut the above\nsufficiently describes, I think, the main outline of what we are\ntalking about. It is important to note, however, that the words\n\u2018\nrecalls or tends to recall \u2019\nmust refer to an increase in a probability.\nWe may put this into something like formal shape as follows : Let\nPi be the probability of the idea of Y succeeding, within a period t,\nthe idea of X (or the presentation of the object X) in the mind\nconcerned, before the occurrence of the associative event ;\nlet be\nthe precisely corresponding probability after the associative event.\nThen X and Y may properly be described as having been associated\nby the associative event if p^ is greater than pj.\nNow, if we consider our experiments in jraranormal cognition, we\nshall see that there is a point to point correspondence between the\nessential events constituting them and those we have just described,\nexcept that the associative and revocative events take place in what\nare commonly termed \u2018\ndifferent \u2019\nminds ;\nbut this difference is\njust what we have decided to ignore for the purposes of this\nhypothesis.\nSubstituting \u2018\nExperiment in paranormal cognition \u2019\nfor X and\n\u2018\nany original \u2019\nfor Y, we clearly have a perfectly good associative\nevent whenever an experimenter selects and draws an original ;\nthat\nis to say, the original (or subject matter thereof) and \u2018\nthe experi-\nment \u2019\nor experimental situation are juxtaposed in his experience in\njust the kind of way we know to be favourable for forming an\n,\nassociation between the two corresponding ideas. Further, when-\never a percipient sits down to try to \u2018\nreproduce \u2019\nan original, we\nhave the elements of a revocative event ;\nthat is to say, he is con-\nfronted with the experimental situation, with \u2018\nthe idea of the\n;\nexperiment \u2019\nin fact, and since his mind is assumed to be identical\nwith that of the experimenter, at the level and for the purposes\nconcerned, it follows from our definition of association that the\n\f308 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\n])rol)ability of tlie idea of Y occurring to him is greater than if the\nassociative event liad not taken place.\nIn other words : Once we have made the fundamental assumption\nabout the essential unity of the different mimls at the relevant level,\nwe need add nothing to what we already Ic.notv about single minds in\norder to account for the main pheno^nenon observed.\nI am not concerned to defend this theory very elaborately, though\nI i^ersonally hajtpen to believe that it is as nearly correct as no\nmatter in its main outline. The question of whether I am \u2018\nright\n\u2019\nor not, whatever that may mean, is of comparatively small import-\nance ;\nwhat is inqxu\u2019tant is whether the theory enables us to form\na tolerably cojuprehensible picture of what is going on with the\nintroduction of the minimum of additional unknowns, and whether\nthe various features of the phenomenon, so far as they are at present\nascertained, fit into that same picture with reasonable neatness and\nwithout undue strain.\nSo far as the second of these points is concerned, I think it is\neasy to see that the theory covers the main facts very comfortably.\nThe associative act of the experimenter takes place in one part, as\nit were, of the joint mind, the revocative act of the percipient in\nanother. Each successive preparation and display of an original\nassociates a fresh \u2018\nY \u2019\nwith the experijnent (\u2018 X \u2019)\n;\nthus, though\nit is natural enough from what we know of single-mind psychology\ntliat the latest Y's should, on the whole, come most easily to the\npercipients, it is also not at all surprising that the earlier should\nalso occur though in diminishing frequency ;\nand this accounts very\npleasantly for the retrocognitive side of the displacement curve.^\nFurther, since we are dealing essentially with one mind at this level\nand not with a plurality, the failure of the ))ercipients of Expt. VII\nto discriminate l)etween their own and other originals follows almost\nas a matter of course, for ex hypothesi there is nothing except the\naliove-menti(med eifect of succession to distinguish them, and the\nseparation in time is small.\nAs regards the hrst point, I do not think anyone will complain\nof the theory on the ground of undue complexity ;\nfor I have intro-\nduced no anatomically invisible transmitters or receivers, no sub-\nconsciously operated tuning appliances, and no automatic decoding\ndevices such as would be necessary on any radiation theory. On\nthe contrary, the objection is more likely to be that, in my desire\nfor simplicity, I have taken too drastic a short cut\n;\nbut, after all,\n^ It will be interesting to see whether this side of the displacement curve\ncorresponds reasonably well, mutatis mutandis if need be, with the curve of\noblivescence for the single mind.\n\f164]\nExperiments on, Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 309\nwe must do something fairly drastic unless we are prepared to reject\nthe facts altogether. Moreover, to say that, at the level concerned,\nall minds (or all relevant minds) are one, is very much the same\nthing as to say that at that level all minds are in free telepathic\ncommunication ;\nand this is just about as drastic\u2014no more and\nno less\u2014as Newton\u2019s supposition that every jjarticle of matter in\nthe universe attracts every other particle, which was the basis of\nhis theory of gravitation.\nI can hardly hope that my theory will enjoy such general accept-\nance and so honourable a career as his ;\nbut at any rate the parallel\nsuggests a good historical precedent for swallowing the camel rather\nthan straining at the gnat.\nC. Ten-Grade Scoring of Experiments I to V\nABSTRACT : The Drawings of Expts. I to V were scored on a scale\nfrom 10 to 1 against (a) the 50 Originals drawn and used for these\nexperiments, (b) the 50 drawn for Expt. VI, of which only ten were\nactually used, (c) the 50 drawn and used by the five experimenters\nof Expt. VII, and (d) 163 words (names of possible originals) which\nmight have been selected for illustration in Expts. VI and VII.\nExamination of the results for the 50 Originals of Expts. I to V\nindicates that markings below three may advantageously be discarded\nif the most informative data be required.\n1. General : Objects of the Work. Readers of my last paper will\nrecollect that it was necessary to arrange for the drawings of Expts.\nI to V and of VII to be scored together against all the relevant\noriginals before we could be sure that Expt. VII was intrinsically\nsuccessful ;\neven then, the comparative casualness of the scoring\nled to a result much less emphatic than might have been obtained\nwith more thorough methods. Somewhat similarly, we cannot be\nsure of properly interpreting Expt. VI until it also has been scored\nas a whole against other material. A comprehensive set of markings\ncovering all work done up to the present time (about 7,000 drawings)\nis accordingly highly desirable, and might well prove valuable as a\nstandard of comparison for future experiments.\n\f310 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nBut, as will 1)6 readily understood, the difficulty of finding scorers 1\nable and willing to undertake tasks of this magnitude is consider- |\nable, and necessarily increases as material accumulates. Moreover, !\nit is easy to see that anyone who has scored any given batch of\ndrawings is ipso facto disqualified, so far as \u2018\nuninformedness \u2019\nand\nconsequent absence of bias is concerned, from scoring any other\ncollection of which the first batch forms a. part ;\nand this a1)sence\nof bias is the only reason, of course, for employing an external scorer\nat all. Thus it is clear that the policy of inducing some kindly out-\nsider to score all drawings against all originals every time a fresh\nexperiment is performed or whenever additional information is\nwanted, is not one which can in practice be pursued indefinitely.\nFortunately, however, there is no particular reason why it should\nbe. Absence of bias is important in the early stages of the work,\nwhen the crucial question of whether the phenomena occur at all\nis still in doubt ;\nl)ut once this has been settled there is, in general,\nno greater need for adopting such methods than in any other class\n'\nof scientific work\u2014and 1 know of none in which ignorance and\ninexperience are regarded as desirable qualities.\nj\nI do not mean by the foregoing to belittle the great and vital\nservice rendered l>y Mr Hindson in connection with the first five\nexperiments, or to suggest that the possibility of bias will never j\nagain be important, or to contend that my first five experiments ;\nhave necessarily established the occurrence of ];>aranormal cognition\nin all minds l)eyond any peradventure. The point is rather that,\nif and in so far as they fail to carry conviction, it cannot be on\naccount of l)ias in the assessment ;\nand that, having eliminated\nbias in the case in which it would be most likely to produce a serious\neffect, there is no special need to do so in resjiect of routine matters\nwhere it could hardly be supposed operative at all. In the second\npa.rt (B) of this paper, for example, I propose to examine the\nquestion of whether such factors as Sex, Age, Imagery and Con-\nfidence exert any appreciable influence on the degree of success\nachieved ;\nl)ut such questions, though of some general interest, are\ninsignificant comjiared with that of whether the phenomena occur\nat all, and not of a kind to jmompt l)ias in either direction in any\nordinary mind. And the same applies to the determination of the\nquantitative features of the process, such as the rate at which the\n]u'obability of a non-chance hit being scored falls off with lapse of .\ntime after the exposure of an original.\nFor all ]uirposes such as these, which are matters of information\nrather than of test, into which bias could hardly enter, we need the\nhighest quality of data that experience and thorouglmess can pro-\n\f164] Exijeriments on Paranormal Cognition of Draivings 311\nduce. Above all, we need data scored as nearly as possible on a\nconsistent plan throughout the work, and this requirement at once\nrules out any idea of having part of the material scored by one judge\nand part by another.\nIn the circumstances there was clearly no practicable alternative\nto doing the work myself ;\nnor, indeed, any reason why I should\nnot do so. On the contrary, although I have tried to make the\njjrocess as objective as possible, cases of doubt inevitably arise from\ntime to time in which a relatively intimate acquaintance with the\nmaterial and the course of the experiments is likely to promote a\njudicious decision.\nSuperficially, of course, it might be urged that almost anyone\u2019s\nopinion as to the resemblance between a drawing and an original\nis as good as mine, or anyone else\u2019s ;\nbut I do not think this is\naltogether true. Other things lieing substantially equal, it seems\nnot unreasonable to suppose that prolonged first-hand study of the\nmaterial is lil:ely to facilitate the formation of an approximately\ncorrect theory as to the nature of the process involved. And any\npolicy of scoring that may be adopted necessarily rests logically (if\nit be logical at all) on the nature of the theory adopted, just as two\ndifferent opinions will necessarily represent two different theories\neven though they may not be specifically formulated. Thus the\nman who w'ould credit a drawing of two tumblers with a full hit\non Spectacles, on the ground that it represents A Pair of Glasses,^\nhas obviously adopted a different theoretical approach from one\nwho would prefer two adjacent circles because of their likeness of\nShape. I myself would reject both, for neither seems to me to\nafford good reason for supposing that the percipient was thinking\nof Spectacles at the time of making the drawing.\nIt will be necessary to discuss the policy and principles of scoring\nin some detail below ;\nbut I think it will be convenient to make\nfirst a short digression dealing with the more mechanical aspects\nof classification and marking.\n2. Classification of \u2018 hits \u2019, etc. In the interests of completeness\nand with a view to various investigations which I hope to undertake\nin due course, I decided to make a \u2022 substantially exhaustive cata-\nlogue of all objects, etc., represented in the drawings and to extend\nthe scoring to cover \u2018\nhits \u2019\nnot merely on the originals which had\nactually been used up to date but also on those which, if I may\nput it so, might have been used but were not. For example, 50\noriginals, randomly selected from a list of 216 words, were drawn\n1 Acknowledgments are due to Dr E. J. Dingwall for this ingenious sugges-\ntion.\n\f312 Whately Carington, M.A., 31. Sc. [part\nl:)y Mrs Lewis for the purposes of Expt. VI, but only ten of these\nwere actually used ;\nand I wished to be in a position to enquire\nwhether the 40 drawn but not used, which were to some extent\nassociated with the experiment in Mrs Lewis\u2019 mind and to a pre-\nsumably lesser degree in my own, had relatively more hits scored\non them Ijy the percipients of this experiment than by those of\nothers. Similar considerations applied to the 166 words listed by\nme but not selected for illustration by Mrs Lewis, and to the words\nenclosed by me in envelopes and sent to the five experimenters of\nExpt. VII but not drawn by them.\nIn addition to drawings corresponding more or less closely to these\noriginals and words, totalling 313, I had naturally to deal also with\na considerable number representing clearly identifiable objects,\netc., of other kinds. Finally, there were those geometrical figures\nand indefinite scrawls, vague lines, and the like, which some per-\ncipients seem to delight in prodiicing in face of the most explicit\ndiscouragement.\nConsideration finally led to the institution of fifteen classes, as\ngiven below :\nKnown Constitution Number of\nNo. as Originals, etc.\n1 1 Originals drawn and used in Experiment I - 10\n2 2 )j ?j )) jj jj\nn 10\n3 3 j; J5 )) J) )5 55 III \"\n10\n4 4 IV -\n5? 5) )) J) \u2019 10\n5 5 V -\n5> JJ ?)

Of the 216 words drawn up\nin the first instance for the purposes of Expt. VI, 50 were selected\nand illustrated by Mrs Lewis, ten being actually used (Glass 6) and\n40 not (Class 6*) : Of the remaining 166, I discarded, so to say,\n63 (Class 10), but retained 103 for possible use in Expt. VII ;\nall\nthese went mto the envelopes, but only 32 were actually used by the\nexperimenters (Class 7a) while the remaining 71 rank as potential\nfor VI and VII but not used in either (Class 12) : In preparing the\nmaterial for Expt. VII, I used 47 fresh words in addition to the\n103 taken over from the initial hst of Expt. VI ;\nof these, 18 were\nused by the experimenters (Class 7) and 29 w\u2019^ere not (Class 11).\nThus all varieties of actual and potential originals are suitably\nsegregated into separate classes, so that, if ever we wish, we can\neasily study the relative frequencies of hits made on them by different\ncategories of percipients. This may be of interest if we have occasion\nand opportunity to study the effect of varying degrees of association\nbetw^een originals and the experimental situation in the Experi-\nmenter\u2019s or other minds. Only the first five classes will be discussed\nhere.\nThis paper contaius little but a tedious account of a tedious piece\nof work, so I will pass lightly over the mechanical details ;\nall the\nsame, it will be desirable to make the essentials of the procedure clear.\nFor each set of drawings by any percipient I used a Catalogue\nSheet. These sheets were printed on foolscap paper and each was\nprovided wdth suitable headings for recording the percipient\u2019s name,\naddress, age, sex and so forth. In addition, vertical columns were\nprovided for recording the ordinal number of the drawing in the\nset, the degree of Imagery and Confidence reported by the per-\ncipient, the nature of the object, etc., depicted, and the name of\nthe original or potential original which it was judged to resemble.\nThese were followed by fifteen others, headed to correspond with\nthe fifteen classes just described, and two more for recording the\ntotal number of entries and the score in any line. Thus, if the third\nNo.\n13\n14\n15\n\f314 Whately Carington, M.A., M.8c.

The only point that\nmatters is that I specificalhj wrote dmvn in the \u2018\nItem \u2019\ncolumn the\nname of each object depicted, or of every worthwhile constituent of\nthe drawing if the drawing was composite. It would be an exaggera-\ntion\u2014but quite a small one\u2014to say that I listed every blade of\ngrass or squiggle of smoke jotted in as trimmings to sylvan or urban\nscenes ;\nand I did not, of course, list component parts of wholes\n(eyes, nose, mouth, hands, feet ;\ndoors, windows, chimney pots, etc.)\nunless there were some special reason of emj:)hasis or the like for\ndoing so. Apart from the most incidental trivialities, I doubt\nwhether anything at all escaped listing, and I am quite sure that\nnothing of consec[uence has as yet slipped through the net.\nThis procedure is somewhat laborious, but it has the advantage\nof making it almost impossible to miss straightforward hits, even\nwhen so large a number as 313 possible originals has to be con-\nsidered. Moreover, up to a point, the procedure is highly objective.\nThe drawing represents an \u2018\nX \u2019\n;\nwe write down \u2018\nX \u2019\nin the appro-\npriate column and, if in do\\d)t, look at the list of 313 possibilities\nto see whether it contains an \u2018\nX \u2019\n;\nif it does, then an entry of some\nkind must be made in the jnoper place, and the only question is\nthat of how many points are to be given. Of course, one has to be\non one\u2019s guard. For example, a percipient might draw a saurian\nreptile and label it Alligator ;\nreference to the list would show no\nAlligator, whereas there is a Crocodile (Class 11) to which it wmild\nbe unreasonable not to assign marks. However, I do not think\nI have missed many jjoints of this kind, and am virtually certain\n(which is much more important) that if I missed them at all I did\nso quite indiscriminately and not in any preferential manner.\nThe main features of the entries on these Catalogue sheets were\nalso entered on Index cards which had been suitably printed to\nreceive them. These were arranged by Subjects {i.e. names of actual\nor potential originals) such as Hand, Boat, Tree, etc., so that par-\nticulars of all the drawings depicting these are assembled together\n\f164] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 315\nby experiments under the appropriate heads. From these cards it\nis easy to read oft' the number of Boats, say, drawn by the per-\ncipients of Expts. I, II, III, etc., or the total score allotted to them,\nor the number of entries reported as Confident, and so forth ;\nother-\nwise, of course, it would be necessary to search through the whole\nof the Catalogue sheets every time one wanted information of this\ncharacter, and this would be quite impracticable. The system of\ndual entry also provided means for applying extremely error-proof\nchecks on the figures.\n3. Policy and Principles of Scoring. Among other reasons which\nprompted the undertaking of the work was the desire to apply a\nmore finely graded system of marking than that of giving only 1,\n-J- or 0 points, as had been done by Mr Hindson, Mr Saltmarsh,\nMr Fraser Nicol and Mr Manning-Sanders in the cases in which\nthey had severally cooperated. It will be remembered that I tried\nthe effect of introducing quarter and three-quarter points in Mr\nHindson\u2019s scoring of Expt. VII ;\nbut it so happened that all the\nresults were null, so that there was no opportunity of studying the\ndifferences between the various grades of markings.\nThere is, of course, no a priori reason for adopting any particular\nnumber of grades ;\nfor example, the grades a, \/3, y are frequently\nused for certain purposes, and are sometimes elaborated by the use\nof plus and minus signs. But the decimal system is so familiar as\nto be preferable to any other in the absence of strong positive reasons\nagainst it, and I accordingly decided to adopt it for this purpose.\nMy only misgiving in doing so was to the effect that it might ])rove\ntoo finely graded for convenient use ;\nbut I reflected that it would\nalways be easy enough to convert the results into, say, a five-grade\nscale, by pooling the lO\u2019s with the 9\u2019s, the 8\u2019s with the 7\u2019s, and so\non, whereas, if one started with too coarse a gradation, one\nwould have to work through the whole of the material again if one\nwanted anything finer. Actually, I experienced little difficult in\nusing it.\nThe important point to note in this connection is that the process\nis not strictly one of measurement but rather of ranking or grading.\nI do not think that one can measure resemblance, in the sense that\none can measure length or weight, very much better than one\ncan measure beauty or tactfulness ;\nbut one can grade resemblances\nin the sense of being able to say that drawing A is more like original\nX than is drawing B, and B than C, and so forth. In general, if\nwe had an original and ten drawings, we could arrange the dravfings\nin order of merit, each in the series having less resemblance to the\noriginal than the one preceding it but more than the one following ;\n\fWhately Carington, 31. A., 31.Sc.\n316 [part\nbut this would not necessarily ini|)ly that the best was ten times\nas good as the worst.\nThe analogy of tenij^erature is useful here. We could very likely\narrange ten jugs of water in the order of their temperatures by sense\nalone, but no one would contend that the hottest was ten times as\nhot as tlie coolest ;\nand even if one measured their temperatures\nwith, say, a Fahrenheit thermometer and found them to be equally\nspaced at ten-degree intervals from 150\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, it would still be\nincorrect to say that the hottest is 2| times as hot as the coolest,\nbecause the Fahrenheit scale is not based on absolute zero.\nIn tlie case of resemblances we are a good deal better off, for it\nis easy to define the upper and lower limits of our scale in the shape\nof a \u2018\nsubstantially perfect \u2019\nresemblance in the first case and \u2018\nno\nresemblance at all \u2019\nin the second. If between these two limits we\ncould insert nine drawings at equal intervals of resemblance to the\noriginal, and could match all subsequent candidates to one or other\nof these, qua resemblance, we should be achieving something practi-\ncally indistinguishable from true measurement. This, unfortunately,\nis impracticable ;\nbut what 1 have said should serve to indicate the\nkind of process to which the scorer must try to approximate men-\ntally as he does his work. In so far as he succeeds, the \u2018\nscores\n\u2019\nwill approximate to true measurements, but it should not be for-\ngotten that they are primarily indications of rank and not of quan-\ntity. Thus, when we speak of giving 10 points (or \u2018\na full mark \u2019,\nor the equivalent) to a drawing, we mean that we regard it as being\nof the highest grade in its resemblance to the original ;\nwhen we\ngive 7 points (or 7\/10 of a full mark), we imply that we can imagine\nat least three degrees of resemblance intermediate between it and\na \u2018\nsubstantially perfect \u2019\nresemblance and seven between it and \u2018\nno\nresendjlance at all \u2019\n;\nif we give only one point (or 1\/10 of a full mark)\nthe suggestion is that the drawing could hardly be less like the\noriginal and still retain any claim to resemblance whatever.\nThis all sounds rather elaborate and formidable, but I imagine\nthat something of the kind, even if- scarcely formulated, must be at\nthe back of the mind of everyone who undertakes any kind of task\ninvolving the grading or ranking of material. The real trouble starts\nwhen we begin to consider what quality is to be the basis of our\niudgments, and how much weight is to be allowed to each if we\ndecide on more than one. In grading fruit, for example, one might,\nI suppose, base one\u2019s judgments on size, colour, firmness, ripeness,\nor smell, or perhaps on other qualities, while in practice one would\npresumably use some scarcely formulated combination of all these.\nSomewhat similarly, in judging resemblances, there are various con-\n\f164] Experimenis on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 317\nsiderations which might be taken into account, each of which, as\nI have observed above, depends for its validity on some kind of a\ntheory as to what is likely to occur if paranormal cognition be a\nfact in nature.\nThus, if we regard Form as all imjrortant, we are tacitly assuming\nthat the percipient in some sense sees and copies the original ;\nif we\nreckon a drawing of a Bow (archery) as a high grade hit on Bow\n(ribbon), we suggest that it may be the ivord that is in some manner\n\u2018\ntransmitted \u2019\n;\nif we pay attention to relationships of the \u2018\nTwo\nTumblers for Spectacles \u2019\nvariety, we clearly entertain the possi-\nbility of subconscious punning ;\nand if we were to recognise Bow\n(archery) as a hit on Arrow' w'e should be regarding association as\nlikely to play an important part. Other possibilities could no doubt\nbe thought of, while various combinations and elaborations of those\njust mentioned would be tolerably plausible.\nI can perhaps best lead up to the principles which I myself adopted\nby saying that, to the best of my ability, 1 paid negligible attention\nto any of the foregoing. This is not to say that I deny, or even\nseriously doubt, the occasional occurrence of any of the processes\nconcerned, except the \u2018\nseeing \u2019\nmentioned in the first ;\non the con-\ntrary, I should not be surprised to learn that all of them, and perhaps\nothers also, play a part from time to time. But at present I know\nof no reason whatever for supposing that they do so more than\noccasionally and to a secondary extent ;\non the contrary, the funda-\nmental principle of scoring hitherto\u2014wdiich has led to highly signifi-\ncant positive results\u2014has been \u201c Stick to the obvious ;\navoid the\nrecondite ;\ngive one mark for a palpable hit, nothing for a miss . .\n.\u201d ^\nor \u201cIf any draw'ing plainly represents the same object or activity\nas that depicted in one of the originals, a \u2018\nhit \u2019\nis recorded ;\nif not\nnot.\u201d ^ It may very well be, of course, that j^rocesses of the kind\nI have mentioned above come into operation much more often and\nmore importantly than I at present suspect ;\nbut successes based\non instructions of the kind just quoted do nothing to encourage us\nto rely on relationships of the more fanciful t}q>es for routine and\ninformative purposes.\nReliance on Form is, of course, entirely a matter of degree, for\nit is evident that; in general, it is by its form alone that we recognise\nwhat a drawing is intended to rejiresent ;\nexceptions occur when\nthe drawuig is unrecognisably bad or non-existent and the per-\ncipient wTites something like \u201c This is intended to be an X \u201d or\n\u201c Thought of an X, but could not draw it\n\u201d\u2014X standing for any\nobject.

I have given a very few low grade (1 or 2) markings in\ncases where the resemblance forced itself on me\u2014probably not more\nthan six or eight altogether, if so many ;\nbut that is all.\nTo pure homonyms I have paid no attention whatsoever ;\nthat\nis to say, 1 have never given anything to Bow (archery) for Bow\n(ribbon), or in similar cases. The same applies to pimimig, of which\nno instance has attracted my notice.\nThe only case I can remember in which I succumbed to tempta-\ntion in the matter of association was a drawing of Cross-bones which\nI graded as 4 for Skull ;\nbut there may have been a very few others\nwhich escape my present recollection.\nThere have, of course, been a number of borderline cases in respect i\nof which a severe critic might attempt to convict me of misstatement I\nin what I have just said. For example, when I drew the Spinning ||\nTop of Expt. II, 1 was trying to illustrate the word Spinning which\nhas various applications, so I thought it right to give one or two\npoints to such things as the word Swirl (almost a synonym of Spin)\nor a drawing of a Spinning-wheel, which would have done just as\nwell as a Top to illustrate the word Spinning.^ No doubt a few i\nother instances of the same kind of thing could be found ;\nbut\nmy statement to the effect that 1 have used such relationships\nto a negligible extent is, I believe, substantially correct, and I have\nadded these explanatory cpialifications partly as a j)recaution and I\npartly on the chance that someone else may wish to score draw-\nings, for comparative purposes, on lines as close to my own as\npossible.\nTurning to the more positive aspects of the matter, the funda-\nmental principle I tried to bear in mind for my guidance throughout\nmay be formulated somewhat as follows : Given that this drawing\nhas a jjrima facie claim to be given points for a certain original, i\nwhat degree of plain and straightforward evidence does it afford for\nsupposing that the |jercipient at the time of making it had the same\n^ It is of some interest to record that the percipient of Expt. II who drew\na substantially perfect picture of the Spinning Top also produced, in the\ncourse of the same experiment, the only examjDle of a Spinning-wheel hitherto\nnoted. This, superimijosed on a Flag, curiously enough, was not so good as\nthe Top, but scarcely mistakable. In practice, it is stricken out of the record\nas a \u2018\nreplicate as explained below.\n\f164]\nEx2Jeriment.s on Paranormal Cognitio)i of Drawings 319\nsort of \u2018\nidea \u2019\nin bis mind, or was thinking of the same kind of\nthing, as the experimenter when he drew the original? This, or\nsomething very like it, should be graven on the heart of every scorer,\nfor I can think of no other which both goes to the root of the matter\nand can be relied upon in all circumstances.\nThe words \u201c plain and straightforward \u201d are important ;\nwithout\nthem, the door is left open for the use of every kind of fanciful\nrelationship that the whim or prejudice of the scorer may suggest\n;\nnone the less, I think it reasonable to enter the proviso that a\nstriking degree of what I may term indirect evidence, as in the\nexamples given above, may be regarded as equivalent to a small\ndegree of \u201c plain and straightforward \u201d evidence. Even so, such\nindirect evidence, involving relationships of the kind discussed above,\nshould be very sparingly used pending ad hoc research as to their\ngenuineness.\nAt first sight, this rule seems very easy enough to apply, and so\nit is\u2014up to a point\u2014in the case of single-item drawings, though\neven here comphcations soon arise. Let me illustrate from the\nexample of the original Horse (Expt. II). ^ I drew as best I could\na Horse standing in side elevation and facing to the left. Now,\nconfining ourselves to single-item drawings only, are we to give full\nmarks (highest grade) to all drawings of a horse, regardless of whether\nthe animal is represented as in side view or facing the observer,\nstanding or galloping, etc. ? I think that if we were concerned with\nan \u2018\nall or none \u2019\nsystem of marking, or with the 1, or 0 method\nused by Mr Hindson, the answer should unquestionably be \u2018\nYes\non the ground that \u201c A man\u2019s a man for a\u2019 that \u201d. But when we\nhave plenty of grades to play with, I think not ;\nand my general\nrule has been never to give 10 points (highest grade) unless there\nwas no reasonable respect (other than skill in draughtsmanship, in\nwhich we are not interested) in which the drawing could be improved\nupon. I found it useful always to bear in mind the possibility that\nI might come upon another drawing later on which would be more\nlike the original (point-to-point correspondence apart) than that\nwhich I was considering. Thus I would not give 10 points to a\ngalloping horse, because I could give no more to one that was\nstanding, though the latter would be more like the original than\nthe former. In general, I deducted one point only, or maybe two,\nfor each difference of this kind between the original and the drawing,\n_so that a single-item drawing, recognisably representing the same\n1 As a matter of accuracy, the word actually turned up in the dictionary\nwas Jennet, there defined as \u201c Small Spanish Horse \u201d, but the Small Spanish\npart was ignored,\nu\n\f320 Whately Caringlon, M.A., 31.Sc. [part\nobject as an original, would usually score not less than 7 pointsd\nJust what differences should be recognised as warranting deduction,\nand whether two points should be deducted instead of one, are neces- !\nsarily matters for personal judgment in particular cases ;\nbut there\nis little room for serious error.\nAnother \u2018\ndimension \u2019\nof difference, if I may borrow a term,\nusually quite independent of what I have just discussed, is that of\nthe kwd of object represented. For example, the Tree drawn as an\noriginal in Expt. V was a somewhat \u2018\ncabbagy \u2019\nsort of thing, of more\nor less deciduous appearance ;\nwhereas percipients drew quite a\nnumber of palm trees, fir trees, Christmas trees in pots, and other\nvarieties. Deductions were made for differences of this sort on much\nthe same lines as those just discussed.\nAnother dimension of difference is found in the varying numbers\nof objects represented. A single Tree is drawn as original : What\nare we go give for Two Trees? For Three Trees, or Four? For\nAvenues, Woods, Groves, Spinneys, etc.? The proper answer is,\nI think, much as before ;\nthat is to say, deduct points for each\nstep, so to say, by which the drawing differs from the original ;\nbut\nin this case 1 should cut the points pretty rapidly so as soon to reach\nvanishing point, for I find it hard to suppose that an impression\nwhich starts as a single deciduous Tree would end up as a forest\nof conifers.\nThis is closely akin to the very trying matter of composite draw-\nings. Broadly speaking, I treated these as follows : If the object in\nquestion (a Tree, say) was Primary in the drawing, i.e. manifestly\nthe principal item of interest and attended only by incidental trim-\nmings {e.g. grass jotted in in the foreground, a cloud indicated in\nthe background, etc.), it was treated as if it were a single-item\ndrawing ;\nif it appeared as Co-equal with some other object, it would\nbe docked of a point or two on this account ;\nif it was definitely\nSecondary, another point or so would be deducted ;\nand if it were\nclearly no more than Incidental, it would only be given one or two\npoints \u2018\nfor charity \u2019.\nThis brings us to the lower end of the scale, where the same sort\nof plan was adopted as at the higher end, but naturally inverted.\nThat is to say, just as I did not give 10 points if I could reasonably\nexpect a stronger claimant, so here I tried not to give so low as\none point if I could imagine a worse claimant still having some sort\nof a claim.\n1 Perhaps I ought to say explicitly here, in case it is not already clear, that the\nphrases \u201c give (or score) 7 points \u201d, etc., are precisely synonymous with \u201c place\n(or be placed in) the seventh grade \u201d, etc.\u2014the tenth grade being the highest.\n\f164] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 321\nThe foregoing prol)al)ly sounds complicated enough, and I could\neasily make it worse by citing the complications peculiar to certain\nparticular originals ;\nbut in jDractice the task is not really so bad\nas it sounds, for it really reduces to applying the ruling principle\nabout \u201c plain straightforward evidence \u201d with the aid of what I can\nonly call common sense and no more than a minimal modicum of\nimagination. The \u2018\nrules \u2019, if I may term them so, about deducting\npoints and the like, cannot be applied in a too rigidly mechanical\nfashion ;\nbut if one keeps them in the back of one\u2019s mind for guid-\nance in cases of doubt, and modifies them with one or two more\n\u2014\nsuch as tending to be a trifle more generous with unpopular\noriginals than with popular and a trifle more severe with hits which\none knows to be \u2018\nwinners \u2019\nthan with others, both of which seem\nsensible principles\u2014one soon finds that one is seldom in doubt as\nto what points to give.\nI need hardly say that I do not regard this as an exhaustive or\nparticularly satisfying exposition of the subject, still less as a com-\nprehensive manual for the guidance of would-be scorers ;\nand I\nshould be sorry to have to stand up to hostile cross-examination as\nto just why I made every decision. But I felt it necessary to give\nsome indication of the general principles underlying my efforts, of\nthe kind of problems which demand solution in work of this kind,\nand of the kind of way in which I have tried to deal with them ;\notherwise my readers might think that I had been guided by nothing\nbut an injuclicious mixture of wish-thinking and guesswork\nIt is perhaps just worth mentioning that, almost from the start,\nI had in my mind the idea that the four top grades of 10, 9, 8 and 7\nshould comprise all the really first-class hits, and that the I\u2019s and\n2\u2019s should form a kind of rubbish bin for charity and duty points\n\u2014\nthat is to say, for drawings which one regarded as thoroughly bad\ncandidates {e.g. the forests and palm groves) but which coukl not\nbe discarded altogether with a clear conscience. In view of the\nresults, it may be desirable to repeat that this notion began to take\nshape almost as soon as I started work and certainly long before\nI had any notion what the results would be like.\n4. Results: {a) Introductory\n.\nBefore I discuss the results obtained\nI think we should spend a moment in considering why it is worth\nwhile working out results at all ;\nor why, alternatively, we should\nnot just treat the grade numbers as decimals of a hit, tot up the\nscores, and leave it at that. After all, it might well be suggested,\nwe already know that these five experiments have led to a highly\nsignificant positive result when scored under \u2018\ntest \u2019\nconditions, and\nwhatever we find now can neither add to nor detract from it.\n\f322 Wliately Carivglon, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nThis is true eiiougii ;\nl)ut we are not liere concerned, as we were\npreviously, with the question of whether paranormal cognition occurs\nat all. Our purpose here is to extract from the raw material the\nset of data best calculated to throw light on various points relevant\nto the manner and laws of its occurrence and to serve as a tolerably\nreUable standard for future reference. If there were any infallible\nmethod for distinguishing genuinely paracognitive hits from those\ndue to chance, we should naturally (for many purposes, at any rate)\npick out the former and study them intensively. But at present\nthere is not, so the best we can do is to select, as objectively as\npossible, the data containing the highest proportion of genuine hits\nand the lowest of irrelevant and merely diluent material.\nOne reservation must be made here, namely that it might happen\nthat the body of data containing the highest jwojmrtion of hits was\ntoo small, absolutely, to yield significant results in the kind of cases\nwe shall be considering ;\nthat is to say, we must effect the best\ncompromise we can between quality and quantity.\nNow it should be evident that if we had adopted criteria for scoring\nother than those which I have tried to describe we might have col-\nlected a far larger proportion of irrelevant \u2018\nhits \u2019\nthan we are\nactually likely to have done ;\nfor the recognition of sufficiently far-\nfetched relationships would enable us to claim a \u2018\nresemblance \u2019\nof\nsome kind 1)etween almost anything and anything else. The ques-\ntion is whether we have carried generosity too far, and whether, in\norder to obtain the best material for our purpose, we may profitably\neliminate some of the lower grades of hits.\nI shall deal with this very shortly, but before doing so one brief\ndigression must be made.\n[h) Dereplicalion. It was pointed out (in effect) by Mr W. L.\nStevens ^ that the method iise for testing significance depends for\nits validity on the assumption that the entries in the 5 x 5 (or similar)\ntable used are independently distributed, and that this is untrue if\nany percipient is allowed to score more than a single hit on any\ngiven original ;\nconsequently, surplus or \u2018\nreplicate \u2019\nhits must be\neliminated before computation of the data.\nThis might be done by simply not entering replicate hits on the\ncatalogue sheets at all, i.e. by making up our minds by inspec-\ntion which of a plurality of Trees, say, was the best reproduction\nof the original and entering that only ;\nbut I thought it better\nto enter every such hit, with its appropriate marking, as if the\nothers were not there, and then strike out those which were not\nwanted.\n1 Proc.

It might, for example, represent the sym-\nbolic fulfilment of some pent up wish ;\nor the object depicted might\nmerely be one of great normal interest to the percipient, which he\ncould not \u2018 get out of his mind \u2019. But it might also be in some\nmeasure a sign of a genuine paracognitive impression. If so, we\nshould expect to find replicated hits (counted, of course, only once\neach) to show a better result than non-replicated. The fact that\nthey form a significantly positive 5x5 table, when collected and\ntested in the usual way, does not help us ;\nfor we may reasonably\nexpect any large enough sample drawn from significant material to\nbe itself significant. But when we examine the j>roportion of genuine\nhits (see below, and Appendix I) we find it is so high as 16-09% for\nthe rephcated hits, but only 8-80% for the non-replicated\u2014that is\nto say, almost twice as great. The difference, however, is not sig-\nnificant, for P is almost exactly -10. But the suggestion that the\ntendency to repeat is an index of genuineness is fairly strong and\nvery well worth bearing in mind.\n(c) Results for different Grades. We start by collecting all the hits\ngraded 10 (highest grade) into a 5 x 5 table and testing them for\nsignificance in precisely the same manner as described in my first\npaper ;\n^ then we do the same for all the hits graded 9 ;\nthe same\nfor all the 8\u2019s ;\nand so on down to the I\u2019s. Next we take the lO\u2019s\nand 9\u2019s together ;\nthen lO\u2019s, 9\u2019s and 8\u2019s ;\nthen lO\u2019s, 9\u2019s, 8\u2019s and 7\u2019s ;\nand continue the ])rocess, adding in the data for the next lower\ngrade at each step, till all entries are included. The first set of\nresults is shown in the left-hand half of Table I below under \u2018\nSepar-\nately \u2019, and the second set in the right-hand half under \u2018\nCumula-\ntively \u2019.\n1 It would be improper systematically to retain the first, say, or the last,\nfor this might affect any investigation we might wish to make of Displacement\nwithin the experiment.\n2 Also in my preceding paper dealing with Expts.

It is evident by\ninspection that the cream of the milk is to be found, as we should\nexpect, in the highest grades\u2014particularly in 8 and 7, which is\nrather more surprising. Grade 6 shows a terrible slump right down\nto chance values ; 5, 4, and 3 do nearly as well on the average as\n10 and 9, by whatever standard they are judged, while my \u2018\nrubbish\nbin \u2019\nof 2 and 1 plainly contains nothing but rubbish.\n^ Loc. cit, p. 97.\n\f164]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 325\nSuperficially, I suppose the most striking feature is the violent\ncontrast between grades 7 and 6. I decline to believe that this\nremarkable superiority of grade 7 is due to a superstitious veneration\nfor the magic number on my part ;\neven if it were, one would expect\ngrade 8 to be depleted about as badly as grade 6, which it is not.\nI have no doubt at all that it is due to the fact mentioned at the end\nof section 3 above, namely that I had the idea in mind that grade 7\nshould represent the lower limit for first-class hits ;\nthis is likely to\nresult in my grading as 7 instead of as 6 a certain number of hits\n(apparently about 16) which I regarded as unmistakable, but which\nmight otherwise have suffered a sufficient deduction of points to\nbring them down to grade 6. I am quite sure that I did not tend\nto reduce hits to grade 7 which ought to have been graded 10, 9\nor 8. If this be the case, it is odd that there should be such a marked\nrise in the values of D\/cr, Q and G from 10 to 7 ;\nand doubly so\nwhen we reflect that, on general grounds, we would rather expect\na falling off.\nClearly we must not attach much importance to this ;\nbut it does\nlook rather as if the most perfect resemblances contained a lower\nproportion of genuine hits than the slightly less perfect. Very tenta-\ntively, I suggest the following explanation, purely as a matter of\ninterest, and on the strict understanding that it is not a matter of\ndemonstrating an effect but of picking up such crumbs of informa-\ntion as the facts seem to suggest.\nIn many cases the originals drawn were highly conventionalised.\nIf the percipient, for reasons other than that of receiving a genuine\nimpression, thinks \u201c Let\u2019s draw an X \u201d, he is likely, I suggest, to\ndraw an \u2018\nimpersonal \u2019, i.e. a conventional X ;\nbut if he does receive\na genuine impression, it seems not unreasonable to think of it\ncoming up, so to say, through his subconscious and being subjected\nto a certain amount of modification or embroidery on the way ;\nand\nthis might well involve just the kind of differences from the original\nwhich would lead me to deduct a few points from the maximum\ngrading of 10. The point is interesting, but should not be taken\ntoo seriously.\nReverting to Table I, I think there can be no doubt as to what\npolicy we should adopt in the matter of selecting material for future\nuse. Ignoring, for the moment, the anomalous values for grade 6,\nwe see that the cumulative figures reach maximum significance with\nthe inclusion of grade 3 hits. Grades 2 and 1 are virtually worthless,\nso we shall certainly discard these as merely tending to ol^scure any\neffect we may be looking for. That is to say, when studying par-\nticular points of interest, such as sex and age differences, we will\n\f326 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nuse only those liits which have been graded 3 or higher. As a matter\nof fact, I have no doubt that it would be perfectly legitimate to\ndiscard grade 6 also ;\nfor its worthlessness has been empirically\ndiscovered by a process which is entirely independent of the points\nwe shall wish to investigate. This would leave us with the extremely\nhigh quality data referred to in the Supplementary Results as\n\u2018\nGrades 10 to 3, omitting 6 \u2019. However, I prefer to keep to wind-\nward of criticism, so I propose to retain them. Moreover, as shown\nin the lower part of the Table, Grades 6 to 3 show a decently signifi-\ncant result, so that the 5\u2019s, 4\u2019s and 3\u2019s must be making quite a useful\ncontribution, and it would be a pity to discard this for no special\nreason.\nThe only reasonable alternative would be to use the top four\ngrades only ;\nbut these, though of very high quality (G=1T58) are\nrather small in number\u2014only about half as many as for 10 to 3\n\u2014\nso that we should run the risk of missing points of importance\nthrough lack of sufficient material to bring out significance.\nAt this point it might not unreasonal)ly be asked why, having\ntaken all the trouble to separate out the hits into 10 different grades\n(or 11, counting comj^lete misses) I should now propose to lump\neight of them together and treat them all as of equal value. It\nmight seem more sensible to utilise the grading by reckoning the\nlO\u2019s as full hits, the 9\u2019s as 0-9 of a hit, the 8\u2019s as 0-8, and so on. This\nmay be regarded as equivalent to treating them all as full hits and\nthen weighting them according to their grading. The results of\ndoing this are given in the Supplementary part of the Table opposite\n\u2018\nScore \u2019.\nI think the answer is twofold. First : In the present state of the\nsubject we are inevitably more interested in the fact of a hit occurring\nthan in its quality ;\nand I had little or nothing to guide me in form-\ning an opinion as to where on my mental scale of resemblances (if\nI may use so formal a term to refer to the various considerations\ndiscussed earlier in this j^aper) the frequency of genuine hits was\nlikely to drop to a negligible proportion of the total. Thus it would\nhave been quite impracticable to fix some arbitrary level of resemb-\nlance in my mind and then give a full mark to every resemblance\nabove it and nothing to all below ;\nfor if I had fixed the level too\nhigh I should have wasted valuable material, but if too low there\nwould have been an equally pernicious dilution. The matter was\none which had to be dealt with empirically by grading all plausibly\n])Ossible resemblances as intelligently as I could and seeing where-\nabouts the critical level did in fact occur. Second : The policy to\nbe pursued will depend on the nature of the problem under investi-\n\f164] Experiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 327\ngation. If we are interested in the simple question of, say, whether\nwomen are more successful than men, and define a success as the\nscoring of a hit on one of the originals in the experiment in which\nthe percipient is working, then it would he a mere gratuitous sacrifice\nof sensitivity not to treat all hits as of equal value. We might also\nbe interested to know whether women score more \u2018 good \u2019\nhits than\nmen, defining \u2018 good \u2019\nas \u2018 graded higher than 6 \u2019\n;\nhere we should\nstill treat all hits as of equal value. But in other circumstances it\nmight be desirable to weight the hits according to their merits ;\nthen we might use the score down to 3\u2019s inclusive, or preferably,\nI am incbned to think, we might weight the hits according to the\nprobability of their being genuine, i.e. proportionally to G. For\nboth the last two purposes, prior grading of the hits is indis-\npensable.\nThis seems as convenient a point as any to insert two notes\nalmost by way of apology to the reader : (1) In dealing with the\nnon-random distribution of instances of replication, I actually used\nin the calculation only hits which had been graded higher than 2 ;\nbut I did not mention this because I had not then shown the reason\nfor discarding lower gradings : (2) Throughout, I have written as\nif the phrases \u2018 genuine impression \u2019\nand \u2018\na hit due to paranormal\ncognition, on one of the originals of the experiment in which the\npercipient is working \u2019\nwere synonymous ;\nbut this is not true unless\nwe choose to make it so by definition, for the percipient might, by\ngenuine paranormal cognition experience a precognitive or retro-\ncognitive impression of an original in some other experiment ;\nthis,\nhowever, does not affect any issue discussed here.\n[d] Comparison with Hindson Pesidts : There is very httle to be\ndiscussed under this heading. If we compare results for my gradings\nfrom 10 to 3 with Mr Hindson\u2019s dereplicated \u2018\nAll Entries \u2019\nfigures,\nwhich seems to be the most approjjriate comparison, we find that\nI have attained an appreciably higher level of significance with the\nuse of appreciably fewer entries. The figures are D\/ct = 3-803 and\n4-82, N=1071 and 779, for Mr Hindson and myself respectively.\nThat is to say, my procedure appears to have picked out a higher\nproportion of genuine hits than his ;\nand this is confirmed by the\nvalues of G, which are 6-093% for him and 9-217% for me. Since\nwe do not know the variance of G, we cannot test this conclusion\ndirectly ;\nbut it is easy enough to show that the 10-grade pro-\ncedm-e has picked out a higher proportion of \u2018\nwinners \u2019\nthan Mr\nHindson ;\nfor in a 2 x 2 table we have\n\f328 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nWinners Losers Total\nTen-grade, 10-3 220 559 779\nHinelson All entries 251 820 1071\nTotal 471 1379 1860\nwhich gives 2-289 for the corrected value of x^, with P less than -03.\nNow, apart from the fact that he was only using the grades 1\nand while I worked from 10 to 1 (or to 3 for the figures now con-\nsidered), there seems to have been only one considerable difference\nin our methods, as judged by examination of a good number of his\nmarkings and confirmed in conversation. This is that he paid much\nmore attention than I did to what I may call \u2018\nmere form \u2019\n;\nin\nother words, he was much more likely than I to give a mark to a\ndrawing which was more or less the shape of an \u2018\nX \u2019\nas opposed to\none plainly representing an \u2018\nX If this be true, as I have little\ndoubt that it is, then we have here a fairly strong suggestion that\nmere resemblances of shape are not, in general, likely to be genuine\nhits, or at any rate a good deal less likely than are unmistakable\nrepresentations. This, for what it is worth, would seem to tell\nagainst the view tliat any jrrocess analogous to seeing is involved ;\nif one were, we should rather expect that the general form of the\noriginal would sometimes be imjrerfectly \u2018\nseen \u2019\nand reproduced,\nwithoiit being recognised ;\nand, if such quasi-seeing were the rule\nrather than the exception, resemblances of mere shape should, I\nthink, tend to enhance and not to diminish the effect. The indica-\ntion is feeble, though worth bearing in mind ;\nbut it seems to be\nsupported by the rise in the value in G from grade 10 to grade 7.\nIf quasi-seeing were involved, then surely the highest proportion\nof genuine hits would fall to those having the clearest \u2018 quasi-\neyesight \u2019, and these would presumably produce the most faithful\nreproductions ;\nbut this is contrary to the facts.\n5. Smmnary and Conclusion. The perpetration of so dull a paper\nrequires some apology. I can only plead necessity. It is not a\npractical proposition to go on indefinitely invoking the aid of\nexternal scorers, however benevolent ;\nnor is it at all certain that\neven the most careful instructions would always overcome their pre-\npossessions or imbue them with a reasonable attitude.\nIt was therefore necessary to undertake a comprehensive and\nsystematic scoring of the whole of the available material, partly in\norder to ])rovide the l)est jiossible data for the investigation of par-\nticular points of interest, partly for the jjurposes of future reference.\nI did not feel justified in taking the line \u2018\nThese are my scores ;\n\fi 164]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 329\n:\nI have had great experience of these drawings ;\ntlierefore these scores\ni are perfect or in just dumping them on the reader without com-\nment. I was therefore forced to explain as carefully as I could, and\nas fully as the limitations of time and space allow, the basic prin-\nciples which guided me, the collateral considerations which con-\ntributed to judgments, and the kind of way in which a scale of\ngrading was formed.\nExamination of the results for the 10 grades used shows (a) that\nthere is a rise in quality from the 10th to the 7th grade, (6) that\nhits graded less than 2 may profitably be discarded. Data con-\nsisting of hits graded 10 to 3, inclusive, \\yill accordingly be used for\nfuture work imless otherwise stated.\nOnly three small points of direct technical interest have been\nincidentally encountered. 1. There is a certain suggestion that\nsome degree of individual modification accompanies genuine im-\npressions. 2. The ten-grade figures show a higher proportion of\ngenuine hits than the Hindson figures ;\nthe latter rely more on\nresemblances of mere shape than do the former ;\nthis indicates that\nquasi-seeing of the original is not likely to play a major part in the\nprocess. 3. There is some indication that the tendency to repeat a\ndrawing is a sign of genuineness of impression.\nIt is hoped to extend the work to Expts. VI and VII.\n\f330 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nAPPENDIX I\nIt seems to be often insufiiciently realised that not every \u2018\nwin-\nning \u2019\nhit, or successful guess, in experiments in this subject is\nnecessarily due to paranormal cognition. This is fairly easily realised\nin the case of guessing Zener cards, for example ;\nfor it is easy to\nsee that chance alone vdll tend to give an average of one success in\nevery five trials, or five in the standard pack of 25 cards. But, if\nthe percipient gets ten right out of 25, it is not correct to conclude,\nas might appear at first sight, that five of these ten are due to\nparanormal cognition. The most probable number is given by the\nrelation w4-(25-w?)\/5 = n, where ni is the number paranormally\ncognised and n is the number of correct guesses, as was first shown\n(I believe) by Dr Thouless in his review of Rhine\u2019s early work.^\nSomewhat similarly in the case of drawings we know that people\nmay very well produce drawings more or less closely resembhng\noriginals for all kinds of extraneous reasons ;\nand it is incorrect to\nsuppose that the number due to paranormal cognition is given by the\nexcess of observed over expected hits falling in the leading diagonal.\nAnd it should never be forgotten, in this or similar work, that we\nhave no means of telling (at present) which of the resemblances\nobserved are \u2018 genuine \u2019\nand which are fortuitous.\nIn any table of the kind we have been using, an estimate (on cer-\ntain assumptions) of the mean proportion of \u2018\nwinning \u2019\nhits due to\nparanormal cognition as opjDOsed to chance maybe obtained asfollows.\nUsing a 3 X 3 table as an example, let us suppose that in each\nexperiment the percipients obtain a certain proportion g of winning\nhits [i.e. hits on the originals of the experiment in which they are\nworldng) by virtue of j^aranormal cognition ;\nlet the remaining,\nchance-determined, hits be distributed between the originals of the\nthree experiments in proportions of which the mean values are Ic,\nm and n for Expts. I, II and III respectively. Let a^, a^, be the\ntotal numbers of hits scored by the percipients of the three experi-\nments, and let 6j, 6.,, be the total numbers of hits scored on the\noriginals of the three experiments. This conforms to the previous\nnotation in Avhich the u\u2019s and 6\u2019s are respectively the column and\nrow totals of the table.\nThen the number of hits, due to paranormal cognition, made by\nthe percipients of Expt. I on the originals of Expt. I will be by\nthe above definitions of a and g. This leaves a remainder of udl -g)\n1 Proc.

Association of Paracognitive Ability with Sex,\nAge, Imagery and Confidence\nABSTRACT : The figures obtained in the course of C above are\nused to investigate the question of vrhether success in the paranormal\ncognition of drawings is associated with differences of Sex, Age,\nImagery or Confidence. No evidence of significant association is\nfound.\n1. General\n:\nThe questions of whether Women are more successful\nat paranormal cognition than Men, A^oung persons better than\nOlder, those who form visual Images than those who do not, or those\nwho have Confidence in their drawings than those who lack it, are of\nsome general psychological interest. Personally, I do not regard\nthem as of primary importance from the point of view of enlarging\nour knowledge of the phenomenon as such. If we were to find, for\ninstance, that Women were markedly superior to Men, this would\nadd, I feel, more to our knowledge of Women than to our knowledge\nof paranormal cognition ;\nfor I do not see what inference regarding\nthe nature of the phenomenon could safely be drawn from the fact.\nOn the other hand, if marked differences between any or all of\nthese categories were to be found, the discovery might be of con-\nsiderable practical value. One of our great dilficulties in pursuing\nthe subject further is the fact that the effect is very small in the\ncase of ordinary people ;\nanother that we can never be sure that\nany particular hit is due to paranormal cognition and not to chance,\neven when we have ample grounds for supposing that a good pro-\nportion of the observed hits are not chance-determined. If we knew\nthat some particular quality favoured success, we could choose our\npercipients accordingly and might reasonably expect to reduce these\ndilficulties by securing a higher proportion of genuine hits.\nIn any event, if only as a matter of routine, points such as these\nought to receive some measure of attention before we pass on to\nmore interesting problems.\nIn what follows, I have, in effect, taken the proportion of \u2018\nwin-\nners \u2019\n{i.e., hits on originals used in the experiment in which the\npercipient was working) as the measure of \u2018\nability \u2019. This is\narbitrary, for we might equally well take the proportion of \u2018\ndirect\nhits \u2019\n{i.e., hits made on the original used on the same occasion as\nthat on which the drawing was made) as our criterion, or indeed hits\nfalling within any chosen range of occasions ;\nand it may well be\nthat at some future stage it will be worth while to enquire whether\n\f334 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nvariations in tlie difi\u2019erent sorts of ability thus definable are asso-\nciated with factors in which we are interested. But this would\ntake us too far at present, while the criterion adopted conforms with\nthe general method of the first five experiments.\nThe figures used are those decided on in the earlier part of this\npaper, namely all hits (treated as of equal value) to which, in my\nown scoring there reported, I assigned a grade not lower than three.\nOn general principles, a note of caution should be soimded here.\nI happen to have taken particulars (in most cases) of four factors\nwhich it seemed likely, on general grounds, might be associated with\nsuccess ;\nbut I might have noted innumerable others, from weight\nor eye colour to knowledge of French or hiving for oysters. If we\nwere to test a large number of such factors for association with\nsuccess, we should expect to find, on the average, that one in twenty\nattained the -05 level of significance, one in a hundred the -01 level,\nand so on, even if there were nothing but chance at -work. Con-\nsequently, if we find apparently real associations among those we\nactually do test, we must be on our guard against the possibility of\ntheir being due to chance effects of this kind. I shall return to this\npoint again at a later stage.\n2. Methods : At first sight, the obvious plan would appear to be\nto form a simple 2x2 table showing the numbers of Winning and\nLosing hits scored by Women and Men respectively, say, and calcu-\nlate hi fhe usual way. But this will not do, because it might well\nhappen that there were more Women than Men (or vice versa) in an\nexperiment of which the originals happened to be particularly\npoj)ular, i.e. more likely to be drawn by chance alone ;\nand, if this\nwere so, it would tend unduly to favour in the final result which-\never sex was preponderant in that experiment ;\nand similarly for\nother factors.\nAlternatively, we might form a separate 2x2 table for each\nexperiment. This would overcome the trouble just mentioned, but\nwould have two disadvantages ;\nfirst, if Women did better than Men\nin some experiments but worse in others, the result would be\nawkward to combine ;\nsecond, if there were no appreciable differ-\nence between experiments, in this respect, we should be wasting\nsensitivity in allowing for it.\nA more promising scheme would be to work separate calculations\nfor Women and Men, following the procedure of my first paper in\neach case, and to compare the differences between the observed and\nexpected numbers of Winners in the two cases. This will tell us\ncorrectly whether Women do better than Men, Old persons than\n\f164]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 335\nYoung, etc. ;\nbut not whether the superiority is signihcant. The\nreason is that Stevens\u2019 formula for the variance of the difference is\ncomputed on the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct,\nand that there is no paranormal cognition, whereas we have every\nreason to believe this to be false, and we do not know what it is\nwhen there is a real effect.\nThe only proper procedure is to analyse the variance in the\nrecognised way. This is a matter of three factors in each case,\nnamely, differences between Experiments, E, differences of \u2018\nright-\nness R, i.e., whether the hit is a winner or loser, and differences\ndue to the factor, F, with which we are dealing, such as Sex, Age, etc.\nThere are also the interactions between these ;\nthat is to say, there\nwill be a higher proportion of winners in some experiments than in\nothers, represented by the contribution of ER, or the interaction\nof experiment with rightness ;\nthere will be a higher proportion of\nhits (regardless of type) by Women, say, in some experiments,\nrepresented by the interaction EF of experiment and sex ;\nand\nthere will be some difference between the proportion of winners\nscored by women and by men, when everything else has been allowed\nfor, and this, in which we are primarily interested, is represented by\nthe interaction FR of sex and rightness. Finally, there is the\nsecond order interaction ERF of all three factors, which consti-\ntutes \u2018\nerror \u2019\nfor our purpose.\nThese are the simplest analyses possible which are capable of\nthrowing light on the points at issue, and I shall give the figures in\neach case below. But it is worth noting that a much more elaborate\ninvestigation could, in principle, be undertaken if it were thought\ndesirable. We could, indeed, form a six-dimensional table embodying\ncross-classifications under Experiment, Rightness, Sex, Age, Imagery\nand Confidence, and investigate not merely the first order inter-\nactions mentioned above, but those of higher orders also, such as,\nsay, Sex-cum-Imagery-cum-Rightness. But apart from the fact\nthat this would be extremely laborious, and would involve dis-\ncarding Expt. II altogether, because no data for Imagery or Con-\nfidence were collected, it would hardly be worth while undertaking\nunless the first order interactions showed significant results, which\nthey do not.\n3. Sex : Among the 251 sets of drawings dealt with in the first\nfive experiments, 120 were from Y omen, 106 from Men, while in\n25 cases the sex of the percipient was unknown. These were omitted\naltogether, and this accounts for the discrepancy between the total\nnumber of hits recorded here and that given in the first part of the\nX\n\f336 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc.

The data accordingly furnish no groiuids\nfor concluding that there is any appreciable association between\nsuccess and Confidence.\n7. Disenssion : The position at which we iinally arrive is, so to\nsay, doubly null and correspondingly unsatisfactory. We have\nfailed to detect evidence of signiticant superiority in respect of any\nof the factors examined ;\nl)ut 1 do not think that we are entitled\nto conclude with assurance that, individually or collectively, they\nmake no difference, for our failure might be due either to insuffi-\nciency of data or in.sensitivity of method. Moreover, owing to the\nsomewhat complicated method of investigation forced upon us l)y\ndata being drawn from several different experiments, it is impracti-\ncable even to estimate how great a difference the methofl would have\ndetected in any given case ;\nthus we cannot, strictly, even say that\nthe difference, if any, must be very small. On the other hand, I think\nwe may reasonably conclude, speaking provisionally and with all\n\f340 Whaldy Cariwjlon, M.A., M.Sc. [part\ndue reservation, that the differences are unlikely to be very large or\nvery important.\nFrom the purely practical })oint of view we should probably do\nwell (since any evidence is a l)etter guide than none) to select\n})ercipients from among Elderly Confident Image-forming Women\nrather than from Imageless and Diffident Young Men, if we had\nan unlimited choice ;\nbut there is certainly no warrant for\nexcluding from our experiments any type of percipient so far\ninvestigated.\nThe question of whether we shall regard the provisional mdlity\nof these results as disappointing or otherwise will depend on personal\nteni])erament and on the views we hold regarding the kind of way in\nwhich paranormal cognition ought to behave. Personally, I do not\nffnd them so, because my own impression, for what it is worth, is\nthat paranormal cognition\u2014or at any rate that variety of it with\nwhich we are concerned here\u2014is an extremely deep-seated pheno-\nmenon, lying at the very foundations of human nature, so that I\ndo not tiiifl it surprising that differences of the kind we have been\nexamining here have a. negligible effect on its operation. Or we may\nput it the other way round, if preferred, and ])rovisionally conclude\nfrom these null results that, since these differences have no appre-\nciable effect, it must be a very deep-seated ]>rocess.\nApart from this, the ap])arent lack of association between success\nand Vhsual Imagery deserves, 1 think a special word of comment.\n1 find it almost imj)0ssible to su|)pose that such association should\nbe lacking if anything at all resembling seeiiiy were involved\u2014if,\nthat is to say, the process were in any reasonalde sense ciairvoyavt.\nSo far as it goes, then, I am inclined to note this fact as evidence\nagainst the '\nclain oyant \u2019\nand therefore in favour of the \u2018\ntele-\npathic \u2019\nor '\njnirely mental '\nview of the phenomena.\nE. T\\\\'(j l\u2019i:on\u00bbsEi) Kkeinements in 'rjOOIINIVlMO\nI. Acicctinii (if Orlyitial'^ : It will be rememl)ered that, in all tin'\nfirst five experiments exce])t the second, the words selected for illus-\ntration as originals were determined by taking a, nund)er at random\nfrom mathematical tables, turning up the corresponding ])age in a\ndictionary and illustrating the \u201c first reasonably drawable word\nfound on or after that page \u201d. In the second experiment, numbered\nand shuffled cards were randomly inserted between the leaves of a\ndictionary and a similar procedure then followed. In Expt. VI,\nI conq)iled a kind of artificial dictionary from which words were\n\fI64j Experimenis un Earanonnal Cognition of Drawings 341\nselected by throwing dice ;\nand in Expt. VII I wrote suitable words\non slips of paper which were placed in separate envelopes and twdcc\nshuttled before being picked out by the experimenters.\nFor the sake of saving trouble and similar reasons I also pre-\nscribed a dictionary method, iising cards, for ii.se in the indepen-\ndently conducted experiments now being carried out by various\nexperimenters ^\n;\nbut it has two disadvantages and I propose to\nchange it, so far as practicable, in future work.\nIn the first place, it allows a certain small latitude to the experi-\nmenter as regards deciding whether a word is \u2018\nreasonably drawable\n\u2019\nor not\n;\nand this might, theoretically speaking, lead to more or less\ntopical words being chosen in preference to others. I regard this\npossibility as in the highest degree academic and there is certainly\nno evidence for its ever having occurred ;\non the contrary, per-\ncipients\u2019 drawings show a surprisingly small number of liombs, guns,\naeroplanes, fire-engines and the like such as one might expect to find\nat the present time. And 1 do not think anyone is likely to suggest,\nin the case of my own five experiments, that Cows and Bottles,\nHorses, Spectacles, Fans, Scis.sors, Jugs, Trees or Boats, etc., were\nmore topical in the periods in which they were used than in others.\nStill, even such remote po.ssibilities may as well be elimiziated.\nMuch more serious from the jzractical point of view is the fact\nthat meticulously conscientious exjzerimenters are apt to avail\nthemselves too Uttlc of the latitude conveyed by the words \u201c reason-\nably drawable \u201d or the equivalent, and so to attempt the illustration\nof unsuitable words. Experience tends to confirm the view pro-\nvi.sionaIly exjzressed on page 47 of my first ])aper to the ettect that\nthe originals should reqzresent reasonably familiar olzjects and should\nlie unambiguous. Too close an adherence to the rules of the dic-\ntionary procedure might result in the use of originals rejiresenting,\nsay, Orrery, Autoclave, Arvbalus or the like, which few percipients\nwould recognise or be able to name even if they saw them ;\nor again,\nwe might have two or more illustrations of virtual .synonyms, such\nas Bull, Ox, Steer, Bullock, etc., and this also would handicap\nthe technique. This kind of thing has already shown itself in the\ncourse of the independently conducted experiments referred to above.\n\u2018 As an informal note of intore.st in jjassing, 1 may say that the.se indejiendent\nexperiments are shaping very well. Of .seven so far received, of slightly\ndifferent types, which have been scored \u2018\nblind \u2019\ncither by the percipients\nthemselves, my wife or myself, all have given positive resnlts. One or two of\nthese strike me as having been somew'hat lucky, and I do not expect this rate\nof success to continue ;\nbut unless something goes seriously wrong, it looks\nas if we have a reasonable prospect of developing a strictly repeatable ex-\nperiment in tlue course.\n\f342 Whalely Caringion, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nFrom every point of view, therefore, the plan of using selected\nwords randomised Iry shuttling in envelopes before use, is to be\njjreferred wherever circumstances ])ermit. It may even prove i\ndesiral)le, for routine experiments, to adopt a standard list of, say .\n100 or 200 words from which the number rec[uired would be ran-\ndomly selected for each exj^eriment or part thereof.\n2. R(ni(lomiii(ttio)i, of Drawings : In that section of my hrst paper\nwhich was devoted to \u2018\nAnticijjation of Criticism \u2019\n1 was at great\npains to demonstrate (])]>. 124-5) that \u201c If tliere is no real effect, a\njudge who does not know the answer cannot generate a spurious\none by any kind of wishful or misguided marking \u201d, and I con-\ncluded that \u201d . . . it is literally impossible for any degree of fanciful-\nness, of prejudice ... or of eccentricity on the part of the judge to\ngenerate anything Init a. chance effect if there is no non-chance\nrelationship Ijetween the drawings and the originals.\u201d\nThe argument is souml, and the conclusion correct so long as we\nmean that it is im])Ossil>le for the judge to adopt a ]jolicy which is\ncniain to tend towards a siuirious positive result. On the other hand,\n1 have recently discovered that there is a kind of mis-scoring which\ncould tend to ])roduce signiiicant positive results spuriously too often.\nIn principle, this is akin to the \u2018\nreplication \u2019\neffect to which Mr\nStevens drew attention,^ and I am again indebted to him for his\nshare in a stimulating correspondence, Init for which 1 should\nprobably not have pursued the (piestion furtlier.\nThe gist of Mr Stevens\u2019 criticism then was that if a j:>ercipicnt\ndraws the same olpect (resembling some original) more than once\nin the course of an experiment, and each drawing is credited with\na hit on the original it resembles, then the effect, mathematically\nj\nspeaking, is the same as if nujre than one percij)icnt had inde-\npendently scored a hit ;\nand this is not true. Consequently, the\nassumptions on whicli tlie matliematical treatment is based are\ninvalidafed, and it can l)c shown tliaf the result will l)e to reduce\nthe variance relatively to the tliiference l)otween the observed and I\nexjx'cted nunil)ers of winners, and thus to magnify the apparent\nsigniticance of wliatever result, whether positive or negative, may\nbe obtained. This is dealt with by striking out the rejilicate hits. ;\nThe ])oint to which 1 wisli to draw attention here is that, if the !\njudge wrongfully {i.c., without there being a real re.semblance) j\ncredits a drawing by percipient 15 with a hit on original X because\npercipient A, working in the same exjreriment, has scored a hit on\noriginal X, then the same situation will arise ;\nthat is to say, it will\n^ Proc. y.P.Jv., Part 1G3, Nov. Pj4t\u00bb, pp. 256 sqq.\n|\n\f164]\nExperiments on Paranormal Cognition of Drawings 343\nappear as if more percipients have independently scored hits on X\nthan have actually done so, and the effect will be the same as that\ndescribed above. It is, of course, not easy to see how such a ten-\ndency could arise, unless we postulate a (piite remarkable degree of\niniquity or feeble-mindedness on the part of the judge ;\nbut to make\nthe point clear T will illustrate with a somewhat fantastic example.\nPerhaps the most striking hit in my first five experiments was that\nl)y a percipient of Expt. II on the original Spinning Top used in that\nexperiment. Now suppose the judge had been so im])ressed I)y this\nas immediately to form the conclusion that Spinning Top must be\none of the originals at which the percipients of that experiment\nwere aiming ;\nhe might then go on to back his opinion (in the ho])e\nof generating a positive result) by crediting with a hit on Spinning\nTop every drawing of Expt. II which coukl conceivably be thought\neven remotely to resemble it (or, indeed, others that could not).\nThis would have the desired effect, for it would mean the crediting\nof the percipients of Expt. II with a number of undeserved hits in\nthe right place, and if it were done on a l)ig enough scale it would\nensure that the result was not only positive but significant.\nIf on the other hand he were to put his money, so to say, on the\nequally unmistakeable if less well-drawn Anchor, which one of these\npercipients drew, he would produce or tend to produce a negative\nresult, for the Anchor was an original of Expt. I, not of II. And, in\ngeneral, any such attempt will produce a negative rather than a\npositive result four times out of five, if there is no real effect\n\u2014\ni.e.,\nif a striking resemblance is no true indication that the original is\none of those aimed at by the percipient. In fact we have the\napparent paradox that a good way of faking a positive result is to\ndo something which you know will produce the required effect only\nonce on the average in every five attenqffs ! The solution is, of\ncourse, that the procedure in question gives you a one in five chance\nof pulling off, what may appear to be a thousand to one (say) shot ;\nbut it is hardly likely to commend itself in practice to anyone\nwishing to fabricate spurious results.\nThe remedy would be to randomise the sets of drawings as well\nas the originals ;\nfor, in this case, even if the hypothetically unjust\njudge were right in his assuni])tion that percipient A\u2019s drawing of\noriginal X was a winning hit, he would not know which were A\u2019s\nco-percipients and so could not apply his assumed knowledge ;\nand\na fortiori the effect could not arise unwittingly.\nAgain, this possibility appears to me to be more of academic than\nof practical interest, though I think it would be wise to randomise\ndrawings as well as originals before scoring whenever practicable,\n\f344 Whately Carmgfon, M.A., M.Sc. [part 164]\nAs regards my first five experiments, the supposition in question\nis certainly not applicable at all to the 314 \u2018\nunmistakeables \u2019\nfor\nwhich (lata are given in the last column of Table 5 (p. 99 of my\nfirst paper) unless either Mr Hindson or I, or both, is to be regarded\nas grossly misrepresenting facts or as pathologically stu])id ;\nand I\nam confident that the same applies to the hits placed in the top\nfour grades of my own scoring descrilied in III A above. On the\nother hand, I think it would be unreasonable to deny altogether the\npossibility that, where less palpable hits are concerned, the judge\nmight 1)6 in some minor degree influenced 1)y what has gone before ;\nin ))articular, it seems to me, some original might be kept near the\nforefront of his mind, so to speak, by the fact that a good hit had\njust lieen scored on it; so that, though he would not mark an\nobvious Tree for Fleur-de-Lys, say, or vice versa, he might be\nfractionally swayed in favour of one or the other if it were a matter\nof marking a vague scrawl which miglit equally well be either. Of\ncourse, under the instructions issued, the judge has no business to\nmark such far from pal])able hits at all, and the evidence indicates\nthat Mr Hindson did not in fact do so ;\nfor, even after the cream\nhas been skimmed from the milk l)y sulfiracting the 314 unmistake-\nables, the mean arbitrated figures, in which every item represents\nat least two independent opinions given under different conditions,\nstill show a significant result.\nBut although one may argue on these lines, it is not really of\nimportance or of interest to do so, unless we consider, as 1 do not,\nthat the occurrence of paranormal cognition must forever stand or\nfall by these experiments alone. My own view is that, while they\nprovide extremely .strong immediate evidence in favour of such\noccurrence and a great deal of useful information, their more impor-\ntant long term value is as experience in the light of which we can\ndevise a sound repeatable technique for routine use by others. On\nthis view, the discovery of minor imperfections such as this, which\ncannot plausibly be held to invalidate the main results, is a .source\nof satisfaction rather than otherwise.\nMy most grateful acknowledgments are due to Professor Cf D.\nBroad, Mr E.

Thouless, M.A., Ph.D.\nPresidential Address delivered at a General Meeting of the Society on\n1st May 1942.\nMay I begin by saying how very deeply I feel the honour which this\nsociety has done me in electing me as its President. It is impossible to\nconsider the long line of distinguished past presidents of the Society for\nPsychical Research without a reasonable fear that any address I may make\nwill appear a ragged intruder in such a distinguished series. I think it\nsafest not to attempt to compete with those whose addresses have made\nimportant general contributions to thought about psychical phenomena,\nbut rather to limit myself to that part of the field of psychical research\nand to those methods of study with which I happen to be familiar. The\nonly part of the field with which I can claim more intimate knowledge\nthan acquaintance through books is that generally known as \u201c extra-\nsensory perception \u201d, and the only part of the study of extra-sensory\nperception with which I can claim familiarity is its study by experimental\nmethods.\nIf, as an experimental psychologist, I limit myself in my present address\nto the experimental study of extra-sensorj^ perception, this is not intended\nto imply that I think that other methods of studying extra-sensory per-\nception, or that fields of study in psychical research other than extra-\nsensorj' perception, are unprofitable or unimportant. There seems always\nin our society a certain measure ol disagreement between those whose\ninterests lie in the study of spontaneous cases and those who prefer\nstatistical and experimental methods of investigation. I do not think that\nthere should be any disagreement ;\nthe difference is rather a division of\ninterests between two methods of pursuing the same end. In all psycho-\nlogical research the two methods of study are complementary to one\nanother, and neither can be pursued with maximum profit if the other\nis neglected.\nThe special function of the study of spontaneous cases is to serve as a\nguide to the problems to be investigated by experimental methods. It is\nthe clinical experience of disease in the world outside that guides research\nin the bacteriological laboratory ;\nit is experience of how dogs, cats, and\nA\n\f2 Robert H. Thouless, M.A., Ph.D. [part\nrats behave in our houses and fields that guides (or should guide) research\nin animal psychology. Neglect of this guidance may lead to sterility and\neven to absurdity in laboratory experimentation. The worst experi-\nmenters in animal psychology are those who seem never to have made the\nacquaintance of a dog outside their laboratory, and whose work lacks the\nguidance which would have been given by having a pet dog of their own\nwho could have shown them what were the sensible questions for the\nexperimenter to ask.\nSo in psychical research, the choice is not between statistics and experi-\nment on the one hand and observation of spontaneous cases on the other.\nLet us have much more of both. No one would have thought of asking a\nsubject to guess what card has been turned up in a pack, if someone else\nhad not reported spontaneous observations of telepathy or clairvoyance.\nNew problems for experimental investigation may be suggested* by new\nobservations of spontaneously occurring phenomena, although also, of\ncourse, new problems for experimental investigation may be suggested by\nexperiments themselves.\nStill less reason has the student of the experimental approach to extra-\nsensory perception for throwing doubt on the relative importance of other\nquestions for psychical research, such as that of personal survival after\ndeath. I think that few questions can be more important than that of\nwhether we survive the death of our bodies. On the other hand, the\nexperimental techniques acquired in a psychological laboratory do not\nseem at present to provide a useful way of studying that question. Even\nif in itself relatively unimportant, the study of extra-sensory perception\nmay have an added importance as a preliminary to the solution of the\nmore difficult question of the evidence for personal survival.\nIt is generally agreed in discussion of psychical research that if any\nperson can produce correct information on any topic there are three\npossible explanations in order of increasing intrinsic improbability :\n(rt) the information has been gained by normal sensory channels or by\nrational inference, {b) it has been gained by extra-sensory perception, and\n(r) It has been communicated by some discarnate intelligence. It is also\ngenerally agreed that evidence for any of these explanations can only be\nregarded as sufficient if the possibility of the preceding ones (presumed to\nbe less intrinsically improbable) has been excluded. It is obvious that,\nwherever one adopts such a scale of explanation and such a principle of\nexclusion, no explanation higher in the scale can ever be established unless\nthe limits of all those lower in the scale are already known. The proof\nof extra-sensory perception has thus been doubted by those who preferred\nto suppose that there was an indefinite upward extension of the powers of\nnormal sensory perception (the so-called \u201c sensory hyperaesthesia \u201d).\nFormally this is obviously correct. If we agree not to regard as evidence\nfor extra-sensory perception any fact that can be explained by normal\nsensory perception, then it is only by our knowledge of some limits to\nthe possibility of obtaining information by sensory perception that any\nevidence for extra-sensory perception can be obtained. Explanations of\nthe phenomena of extra-sensory perception by sensory hyperaesthesia have\nne\\er been generally accepted by psychologists (however sceptical they\nmay have been of the E.S.P. explanation on other grounds) because it has\nIWI\nlie\n!\npe:\ntar\niiW\n\fi66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 3\nseemed to them that the limits of sensory perception were sufficiently well\nknown, and that in some cases, as, for example, the eye, the limits of\npossible perception were clearly set by well-known physical factors and\nthat explanations by hyperaesthesia went beyond these limits. Since there\nis no good evidence for sensory hyperaesthesia in any case, and since, m\n^some cases, well attested facts of extra-sensory perception (such as\nsuccessful card guessing experiments over long distances) cannot be\nexplained by any extension of hyperaesthesia, the possibility of sensory\nhyperaesthesia is no longer felt to be a serious obstacle to the acceptance\nof evidence for extra-sensory perception.\nThere seems to be no corresponding certainty that we know the limits\nof extra-sensory perception sufficiently well for it to be possible to regard\nany evidence for spirit communications as sufficient if we admit the prin-\nciple that nothing is to be regarded as evidence that might be explained as\nan effect of extra-sensory perception. The evidence, for example, of the\n\u201c Lethe \u201d scripts for a communication from Dr Verrall depends on the\nsupposition that the fact that Mrs Willett possessed but had not read the\nbook by Dr Verrall containing the relevant information could not enable\nher to produce that information by extra-sensory perception.^ Any\nargument for accepting such a supposition must remain unconvincing in\nthe absence of any exact knowledge as to what are the limits of extra-\nsensory perception. It is extremely likely that the possibilities of obtaining\ninformation by extra-sensory perception have their own definite limits\nalthough these limits are obviously very different from those of sensory\nperception or rational inference. There also seems every reason to hope\nthat experimental study may one day give us a clear idea of what those\nlimits are. Certainly we do not know yet, but the experimental discovery\nof the limits of extra-sensory perception has, amongst other things, the\nvalue that it may be a necessary preliminary to a satisfactory assessment of\nthe evidence for survival.\nI have so far used the term \u201c extra-sensory perception \u201d because that\nis a name now generally understood. It is not with any enthusiasm for\nintroducing novelties in terminology that I propose now to drop that\nterm and to suggest a new one. The objection to the term extra-\nsensory perception \u201d is that it suggests a theory of the nature of the\nphenomenon in question, and I see no reason to suppose that this is a true\ntheory and some reason for suspecting that it is false. There is sorne\nambiguity in the exact implication of the term (particularly when it is\nwritten in the shortened form E.S.P.) since it might be given two very\ndifferent meanings by the interchange of the hyphen and the space.\nThus we might mean \u201c extra sensory-perception \u201d or \u201c extra-sensory\nperception \u201d.\nThe first of these is, I think, unobjectionable ;\nit implies something of\na kind not further specified than that it lies outside sensory-perception.\nThis seems to indicate exactly the first objective of experiments on this\ntopic. The experimental subject is asked to give a report on something,\nsuch as the turning up of cards, and the set-up of the experiment is directed\ntowards making it certain that he cannot perform the task by means of any\n^ \u201c Some recent scripts affording evidence of personal survival, Rt.

If he succeeds in th^\ntask, we are doing no more than giving an operational definition of th\ncapacity he has displayed if we say that he has succeeded by \u201c extra\nsensory-perception \u201d, that is, by some means other than sensory perception\nThis, however, is not how Rhine (who invented the term) hyphens it,\nand it is not what he means by it. Rhine\u2019s term is \u201c extra-sensory per-i\u201c\nception \u201d, not \u201c extra sensory-perception \u201d, and that has implications much'\nmore questionable. It seems to imply a kind of perception which is out-j\nside sensation, that is, which is not occasioned by the operation of sensory\ny\ncues. That the effects we are speaking of are not occasioned by sensory*\ncues seems clear enough, but are we so sure that it is a kind of perception?\nUnder experimental conditions, a successful subject reports correctly the\ncard turned up more often than he should if his correct answers were\nmerely random. But it appears that he does not know when he is guessing\nright. That fact alone suggests a wholly different kind of mental operation\nfrom that of perception. Can we then accept Osty\u2019s term \u201c metagnomy \u201d?\nI think not for the same reason ;\nit does not seem to be a kind of knowing.\nA mere successful reaction not accompanied by any awareness of being\nright or wrong is not \u201d knowledge \u201d any more than it is \u201c perception \u201d.\nIt must, I think, be admitted that many cases of spontaneously reported\ntelepathy take the form of a mental presentation apparently telepathically\ndetermined and that they might, therefore, be considered to he mental\nevents of the same kind as perceptions, but this does not alter the fact that\nso-called extra-sensory perception need not have this character and that it\napparently does not in such cases as card-guessing experiments.\nIt would be pedantic to object to a misleading terminology unless it,\nin fact, misleads. I think that this term may be seriously misleading since\nit leads us to put these effects within a framework of expectations in which\nordinary perception is placed. They may belong to a totally different\nframework, requiring quite different expectations and quite different\nmodes of thought to deal with. Perception lies, for example, within the\nsystem of scientific causation, but it may be necessary for our thought to\nabandon this system of expectations if we are to understand paranormal\ndetermination of correct responses.\nThe same objection may be urged against the earlier terms :\n\u201c tele-\npathy \u201d, \u201c clairvoyance \u201d, and \u201c precognition \u201d. In Greek, French and\nLatin respectively, these terms imply that the effects dealt with belong to\nthe class of feeling, of seeing, and of knowing. I do not suppose that the\nchoice of these three different generic terms for these three phenomena\nwas anything but accidental, or that the fact that all three were different\nmeant anything except that those who devised these names felt confusion\nand uncertainty as to what class of mental fact the phenomena belonged to.\nThere is, of course, the further objection to these terms that they imply\nthat we have here three different kinds of phenomenon, whereas there may\nbe only one phenomenon in which neither the presence of knowledge in\nany other person\u2019s mind nor restriction of response to the present time is\nessential. That clairvoyance and telepathy are not separate phenomena\nis suggested by Rhine\u2019s observation that his subjects score about the same\nwhether the experimenter turns up a card and looks at it or simply slips\nit off the pack without looking at it. Dr Soal has worked with a subject\nfif\nI\n\f*66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 5\n\u2022\n\/hose hits were not on the card turned up but on the card one ahead of the\nne turned up. In recent experiments I have found a significant excess\nf hits on the card two ahead. This seems inexplicable on the hypo-\nhesis of simple telepathy since the next card but one is no more known\ny normal means to the agent than it is to the subject. If we use the\nraditional terms we might call it either \u201c precognitive telepathy \u201d {i.e.\njreknowledge of something that will be known to the agent in a short\nme) or \u201c clairvoyance \u201d (of the fact of the card being next but one in the\nlack although this is not known to the agent), or we might assume tele-\nathic knowledge by the subject of something known by precognition or\nlairvoyance to the agent.\nAlternatively we may adopt the hypothesis that there are not three pro-\nesses, but one process, which does not show that restriction to present time\nnd to present sensory stimulation that is characteristic of the determina-\non of right reactions by ordinary sense perception, and which may be\nifluenced in some way by knowledge in another person\u2019s mind, but which\noes not require this as an essential condition for its occurrence. If we\ndopt this as a working hypothesis, I think we should, for the reasons\niven above, avoid the term \u201c extra-sensory perception \u201d, and use some\n;rm that implies no theory as to the kind of mental process this is. I\naggest that we should use a term proposed by Dr Wiesner, and call this\nroup of effects the \u201c psi phenomena \u201d, a term which has the important\negative merit that it implies no theory as to their nature.\nIf experimental psychologists have, on the whole, been slow to accept\nle reality of the psi phenomena, this is to be explained partly by the\nifficulty of repeating at will the successful results which others have\nsported, partly by the intrinsic improbability of the phenomena themselves,\nt is to be hoped that the first of these difficulties will be got over by\njrther experimentation on the conditions favourable to the appearance of\nae phenomena. The literature of the subject contains many hints as to\nivourable conditions, but these seem generally to be based on the im-\nressions gathered by experimenters in the course of their work rather than\nn exactly controlled experiments establishing significant differences in\nsores obtained under one condition and another. Although gathered in\nle course of experiments, this evidence is, therefore, largely anecdotal,\nt is reported, for example, that bodily relaxation and the taking of alcohol\nre favourable to positive results, while fatigue and illness of the subject\n,\nre unfavourable. This situation poses, as an important problem to be\n1 etermined by experimental methods, the finding by exact methods of the\ni ptimal conditions for the appearance of the psi phenomena. When we\n'\nnow this, it is possible that we shall no longer be dependent on occasional\nabjects or on large scale experiments for successful results. It ought\n) be possible by suitable training of our subjects and by suitably arranged\nonditions to produce successful results anywhere. When this is possible,\nle main rational defence for rejection of the experimental evidence for the\nhenomena will disappear. Anyone will be able to produce the evidence\n)r himself by carrying out the experiments in the right way.\nOn the intrinsic improbability of the psi phenomena, there seems to be\name difference of opinion. Against those who think the intrinsic im-\nrobability so great that they find themselves unable to be convinced by\n\fRobert H. Thouless, M.A., Ph.D. [pap\nIS)':\nipli)\nISO\nI'C\na weight of evidence far in excess of what would be regarded as decisiv\nin any other field of research, there are others who seem to find nothin\nintrinsically unlikely in the facts reported. I should like to suggest th:\nthere is a real intrinsic improbability in the psi phenomena, and it ma\nperhaps be worth while to consider for a few moments what this assertio\nof intrinsic improbability means.\nThe psi phenomena are, I think, improbable because they are oppose\nto an important and well-founded system of expectations, that based o\nnatural science. Scientists occasionally say that the basic principle c\nscience is to follow the evidence wherever it may lead. Undoubtedly\nthere is much to be said for being prepared to be convinced of anythin\nwhatever if there is sufficient evidence for it, but I do not think that it i\npeculiar to the scientific habit of mind or even particularly characteristi\nof it. If science had claimed no more than this for itself, I do not think i\nwould have gained the tremendous prestige which it has accumulate\nduring the last three hundred years. I suggest rather that the real strengt\nof science is that it has claimed to be a method of deciding what kinds ci\n,\nthings can happen and what can not. That is how the advance of scienc\nduring the last few hundred years has eliminated belief in magic, i:\nastrology, and all the other things commonly classed as superstitions, no\nby disproving their reality separately by experimental investigation, but b\nbuilding up an experimentally based system of expectations which has le(\nmen to feel convinced that these are the kind of things that do not happen\nIf, for example, the scientifically educated man finds himself withou\nany apparent cause becoming weak or ill, he is not ready to accept tb\nexplanation (which he might have accepted if he had lived in the Middl\nAges or if he lived in a pre-scientific culture at the present day) that ai\nenemy w'as working magic against him and had perhaps made a wax imag\nof him into which he was sticking pins or which he was melting before ;\nslow fire. On the other hand, he is ready to accept the scientific explana\ntion that he is suffering from pernicious anaemia. The remedy he wil\nexpect to be effective is not that somebody should be burned at the staki\nbut that he himself should drink large doses of liver extract.\nYet it is probable that no-one has ever done a properly controllec\nexperiment which has proved that making a wax image of a person anc\nmelting it in front of a fire does not cause that person to fall ill and die\nTo anyone who has within himself the scientific system of expectations\nsuch an experiment would be felt to be unnecessary because this is th(\nkind of thing that the scientific system of expectations would lead him tc\nsay cannot happen. This system of expectations leads to acceptance o\nsome kinds of alleged causes of illness as effective (such as infections .\n\u2018\nchanges in bodily organs, etc.) and others, such as charms and magica (\npractices, as not effective.\nIf we ask what sort of causes were accepted and what rejected by th(l|,;_\nscientific system of expectations, the answer in its broad outlines is suffi-\nciently obvious. The essential characteristic of the scientific type ol\nexplanation was that one thing could only cause another if there were af\ncontinuous chain of physical events between the two. There is the neces-jj\nsary physical continuity between the failure of one\u2019s bodily organs tc'\nproduce a sufficient number of red corpuscles and a wasting disease, bul\"\n\fNi\ntm\nJatt\ndsi\nit(\n66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 7\none between the melting of a wax image unknown to the patient and a\nimilar illness. The essential principle is m no wise changed by the tact\nlhat a more modern scientist may say that if an Australian aborigine knows\nhat a wax image of himeslf is being melted before a fire, he may produce\nhe symptoms of a wasting disease by suggestion. The chain of continuity\nf physical causation is then complete, from the tact of the wax image, to\nhe sound waves of a verbal report, to the events m the ear and nervous\nVstem of the patient when he hears the report, to the reaction ot his bodily\n.rganism to that report. The scientist is inclined to welconie such an\n:xplanation ;\nit brings the fact alleged within the system of scientific\nIn the same way the facts of ordinary perception, although they may be\n^\u2022alled wonderful and mysterious, fit very well within the system o\nxpectations of physical science. In visual perception, electro-magnetic\n'vaves come from the object to the eye, on the surface of the retina they\nProduce chemical changes which start an impulse along a nerve hbre to\ni\nhe visual area of the cerebral cortex. If we ignore the problem of how a\nmaterial change in the cerebral cortex is related to the conscious process of\nperception, and confine ourselves to the physical processes between e\njmission of rays from a material object and the completion of a muscular\npr glandular response on the part of the organism, the continuity ot the\n:hain of physical events is complete. , ..u i r\nIf anywhere the chain appears incomplete, it is an accepted method o\nscience to postulate a material event where there appears to be a gap. I.et\nus suppose, for example, that a scientifically educated burglar tries to\n'steal a gold cup protected by a burglar alarm operated by mtra-red light.\nAs his hand approaches the cup, a bell rings. His first reaction may be\n^bewilderment ;\nsomething has happened which his system of expctations\ngave him no ground to foresee. If he had touched a wire or a thread, the\nmatter would be simple ;\nhe would suppose that he had established\n''continuity in some way with the bell. But, if he is scientifically educated, e\nwill not fall back on the pre-scientific explanation that might satisfy a\nsavage. He will suppose there is something there, which he cannot see or\nfeel, but which is just as real as a wire or string. Quite likely, remembering\nfcwhat he knows of wireless, he will hit on the correct explanation that his\n\u2018\nhand has interrupted an invisible series of waves. Then the event will no\n^longer be mysterious ;\nhe will have postulated continuity where a gap\nappeared in the chain of physical events, and the ringing of the bell will\nfall within the system of causation to which his scientific education has\nmade him accustomed. .\nIf ordinary visual perception falls within the system of scientihc expec-\ntations because it preserves the principle of continuity of material causa-\ntion, the psi phenomenon does not. It is, therefore, inevitable that the\nfirst reaction of the scientific mind should be to relegate it to the class o\nthings which science teaches us do not happen. I think it does belong\nto that class. If so, there are three things to be done about it ;\n(i) to say\nthat the psi effects do not take place and that those who report them are\neither incompetent experimenters, or frauds, or the unfortunate vicUms o\n*\na vast system of chance coincidences ; (2) to postulate some unknown\ncause which would reduce the phenomena to a kind admitted by science.\n\f8 Robert H. Thotiless, M.A., Ph.D. [PAE\nwsii\nca?i\nas, for example, by postulating some unknown form of radiation ;\nor (;\nto accept the phenomena as genuine and as not fitting into the system (\nscientific expectations, and as requiring, therefore, a modification of on\nsystem of expectations.\nBefore this audience, it is not necessary to argue the impossibility c\naccepting the first alternative. Even before the laborious and extensiv\ninvestigations of Rhine, Soal, and Tyrrel, had produced experimental an\nstatistical evidence of an overwhelming character, it was arguable tha\nthe case was sufficiently proved by sporadic evidence alone. Our distin\nguished former president, Bergson, in his address to this society, state(\nthat he was convinced by evidence of this kind, and Rhine has state(\nthat he considered the evidence conclusive for the reality of telepath;\nbefore his own laborious researches added fresh evidence. There is\nhowever, one important advantage for proving the reality of psi tha\nexperimental evidence controlled by a proper use of statistical methods ha;\nover the observation of spontaneous cases and over experimentation t(\nwhich statistical checks can be less easily applied. This advantage lie;\nin the fact that it is possible to give a figure indicating how unlikely it is\nthat we are being misled by chance coincidences. We may say that eIT\nspontaneous case or a series of spontaneous cases shows too many details hi\nof correspondence to be explicable by chance. If, however, a sceptic says l\"\n^\nthat he tfiinks nevertheless that it is due to chance coincidence, we have no :\n|\nreply except to reassert our own interpretation. It is more satisfactory ! .\nto be able to reply that the odds against a result having occurred by chance\n0[iH\nis some definite figure\u2014a thousand to one, a million to one, or more.\nIt remains true that some sceptics do say that the odds of billions to one\nagainst a chance interpretation of modern experimental results are merelyi\na lucky accident. I do not think that this should be found surprising or\nparticularly disturbing ;\nno evidence can compel belief in those who are\nsufficiently determined not to believe. It is still satisfactory to the experi-\nmenter that he can produce a figure which is a measure of his opponent\u2019s\nwill not to believe.\nOdds of more than millions to one against a chance interpretation of\nresults are not particularly interesting since, by the time that limit is\nreached, the explanation that the whole thing is a conspiracy of fraud be-\ncomes at least as likely. That all of the successful experimenters on this\nsubject are deceiving us as to their results or are deceiving themselves is\nobviously very unlikely, but that too is a possible explanation if we are\nwilling to admit extreme improbabilities rather than the reality of the psi\nphenomenon. Empirical methods of research can never give certainty ;\nwildly improbable coincidences are a possibility, and human fallibility is\nalso a possible source of error. All that we can reasonably demand is that\nevidence for the psi phenomena should be strong enough for reasonable\nconviction even for an intrinsically unlikely effect. That point has, I\nthink, been passed, and the reality of the phenomena must be regarded as\nproved as certainly as anything in scientific research can be proved.\nAccepting the reality of psi, we may seek to fit it into the existing\nframework of scientific explanations in the same sort of way as we sup-\nposed the burglar fitted in the operation of the infra-red burglar alarm.\nWe may postulate some form of unknown radiation received by some\nk\nsie\n\f>tu\n:ls\ni66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 9\nunknown sense organ. Such explanations have had the support of great\nnames in the past (such as Crookes and Ostwald). Against them, we must\nconsider a respect in which the case is not altogether parallel to that of our\nimagined infra-red burglar alarm. The initial reason for the burglar\npostulating some unknown form of radiation was to fill in a gap in the chain\nof physical causation, but, if he stops to experiment, he may find a better\nreason for confirming this guess. He may find some independent way of\nshowing that there is some radiation occupying the path in which his\nhand was when the bell rang. If he happened to have a blackened thermo-\npile in his kit, he might, for example, trace the path of the radiation by\nobserving its heating effects. The reason for our confidence in the scien-\ntific type of explanation is that the entities we postulate to fill such gaps\ncan be shown to have other properties by which their reality can be\nconfirmed. We do not know light waves only by their action on the eye ;\nif we did there might still be reason for doubting their reality. We know\nthem also by their action on photo-chemical substances, by their heating\neffects, and so on. An unknown form of radiation of which we have no\nknowledge except its action in the psi effect and an unknown sense organ\nsimilarly known only in this way and undetected by anatomical investi-\ngation, lack plausibility as scientific hypotheses and can only be regarded as\ndesperate expedients to save the system of scientific expectations.\nThere is, of course, also the argument which has often been urged that\nwe know of no kind of radiation which does not lose its effect with distance,\nand that even if we explain such facts as the success of Rhine\u2019s subjects in\nreading packs of Zener cards \u201c down through \u201d by supposing that some\nform of radiation proceeded from the cards, it is impossible to see how any\nform of radiation could enable the subject separately to perceive the cards\nlow down in the pack. Still less is it possible to conceive how any form of\nradiation could enable a subject to discriminate at a great distance a\nparticular pack from all other packs and all other objects which must be\nsupposed to be sending out similar radiations.\nWe seem then to be forced to accept the third possibility\u2014that the psi\nphenomena are real and that they are not explicable in terms of the\nscientific expectations based on the necessity for physical continuity in\nchains of cause and effect. This would not, of course, mean that we\nsuppose that the system of scientific expectations is wholly mistaken.\nThat would be absurd in view of the remarkable success which has been\nachieved in building up a means of controlling the outside world by\nfollowing that system of expectations. The refinement of optical instru-\nments, the construction and improvement of various types of engines, the\n!|\ncontrol of disease by processes of immunisation and by surgery, are a few\n('I\nonly of the practical triumphs of the scientific point of view. They have\nbeen attained by attributing to effects the kind of causes which science\nleads us to expect and by rejecting the kinds of causes that science rejects.\nIt is clear that over a very large field of phenomena, this system of expec-\ntations has proved a trustworthy guide. It remains possible that there is\nalso a field in which it is not a trustworthy guide. The psi phenomena\nappear to be such a field. There may be others. Possibly the human\nwill is one. The denial of the freedom of the human will has been general\namongst those accepting the scientific point of view for the last few cen-\n\flO Robert H. Thouless, M.A., Ph.D. [pari\n'tti\nifti\n::jn\nTb\n,aMs\naid\nSOS\nItp!\nturies. But if the principle of continuity as accepted in natural science\ndoes not hold for any field, however limited, there remains the possibilitji\nthat it does not hold in some other field. This opens up disturbing\npossibilities. Perhaps many would welcome the undermining of an\nargument against human freedom, but the denial of the universal applica-\nbility of scientific expectations seems to open the door to other discarded\nbeliefs, such as the belief in magic, astrology, the evil eye, and other\nthings condemned as superstitions by science. The worst that can happen,\nhowever, is that one barrier against these beliefs may go ;\nthere may\nremain other reasons for rejecting them. If we can no longer accept the\nscientific system of expectations as an infallible guide, many things\nbecome possible that would previously have been regarded as impossible.\nBut not all things become true, and we may still reasonably believe that the\nthings I have mentioned are superstitions without rational foundations ;\nthe only change is that our reasons for rejecting them are somewhat\ndifferent than they were before.\nThere is also the very difficult question of how we are to think of psi\nphenomena if we are not to try to fit them into the framework of the |isu\nscientific system of expectations. Are we to postulate a type of continuity\nbetween cause and effect different from that in the kind of causation\nrecognised by natural science, and if so how are we to think of this con-\ntinuity? I do not think we are in a position yet to answer these questions.\nIf the way of thinking appropriate to the psi phenomena is to become clear,\nit must be by more research and by new ranges of speculative thinking. I\ndo not feel myself competent in the field of speculative thinking, and I have\nno positive suggestions to offer. I have only the negative suggestion to\nmake that the first step is to eradicate from our minds the influence of the\ndeeply ingrained habits of thought which make up the scientific system of\nexpectations. These are deeply ingrained, and they are influencing us\nwhen we start thinking in terms of unknown radiations- I think we un-\nnecessarily tempt them to exert their influence when we talk of these\nphenomena as if they were a kind of perception. It is as part of this nega-\ntive process of preparation for new ways of thinking that I have suggested\nthe rejection of the term \u201c extra-sensory perception \u201d. As to what are the\nItie-\ntn\nappropriate ways of thinking about these phenomena, I have no idea. I jai\ntorr\n|Mni\ndo not think that we have them yet.\nAlready I think there are indications in the results of experiments which\nwould guide us in our thinking if we knew how to interpret them. One of\nthe most encouraging signs in the experimental research on this subject\nat the present time is that we have not merely shown that psi phenomena\ncan be demonstrated under experimental conditions, but that our results\nare showing odd, unexpected and (at present) inexplicable uniformities\nwhich are cropping up independently in different laboratories. No\nscientific research worker can feel quite so well satisfied with results that\ncome out exactly as he expected them to, as with results which persistently\ncome out as he had no previous reason to expect. Here he feels he is |lai\nagainst the hard rock of a reality independent of his expectations ;\nhere jud\nis a challenge to his powers of constructive speculation. Jloe\nFor example, Rhine found that if he made his subjects continue their\nexperiments beyond the point at which they were thoroughly bored with\n|tsp-\nj*c\ntli\n\f66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 1\n1\nhem, they began to score persistently below mean chance expectation.\nit least two other investigators working independently of Rhine have\neported the same result. A drop to mean chance expectation would be\n:asy to understand, but a drop that is significantly below mean chance\nixpectation is entirely unexpected. Rhine explains it as an inhibition of\nhe psi function. It may be so ;\nI shall suggest later that there may be\nmother explanation. In any case, we have here a point at which the\nixperimental facts challenge us to answer the question \u201c Why ?\u201d and\n- vhen we can answer it we shall be a step nearer to understanding psi.\nllf There is also the discovery, originally made by Mr Whately Carington,\n)f what may be called \u201c temporal dislocation \u201d of responses. He found\nin his experiments on pictures exposed on successive nights that subjects\nnight not draw a picture resembling the one exposed during the night on\nwhich they made the reproduction but one resembling some picture\nixposed on some other night, or even in some other series of experiments,\n;he probability of such a hit decreasing with the remoteness of the original\npi'rom the occasion of the reproduction. This observation was not in itself\n*of sufficient statistical significance to carry overwhelming conviction to\nhose who would regard such temporal dislocation as too improbable for\noelief without coercive evidence. It led, however, to Mr Soal\u2019s re-\nisxamination of the results he had obtained in his repetition of Rhine s\nixperiments, and, although his intervals were so different from those of\nWhately Carington (a second or so instead of a day), he found, with some\nsubjects, evidence of correct guessing with temporal dislocation that was of\nunquestionable significance.\n'\nI think that Whately Carington\u2019s discovery is of the greatest importance.\nOn the theoretical side, it shows that psi reactions (already proved to be\nrelatively independent of space by Rhine and other experimenters who\nffiave obtained successful results over great distances), show also an\n'indefiniteness with respect to time, and that successful psi results may be\ndetermined by a future event even when the intention of the experimental\n[Subject is to make them refer to the present time.\nThis discovery also seems to have important consequences for experi-\nmental practice. In the past, it has been usual, as in the work of Rhine\nand Tyrrell, to regard as evidence of psi functioning, the ability to guess\ncorrectly the card turned up. Now we can consider that as only a special\ncase of psi activity, and it seems likely that success in psi experiments is\neven more widespread than is indicated by Rhine\u2019s e.xperiments since\nmany people doing a card guessing test may not get appreciably more\nright than mean chance expectation on the card turned up, but may be\nconsistently getting hits on some other card. Traditional methods of\nexperimenting would erroneously class these as showing no psi success.\nAlso it is possible that differences between the results of different\nexperimenters may be due to differences between those who get hits on\nthe card turned up and those who do not. For example, Rhine reports\nthat his subjects score equally well under pure clairvoyance conditions\nand under conditions in which the agent sees the card turned up. Soal\ndoes not get success in pure clairvoyance conditions, and I do not. But\nwe were working with subjects showing temporal dislocation and Rhine\nwas working with subjects guessing on the card turned up, and this may\n\f12 Robert H. Thotiless, M.A., Ph.D. [par\nfiJi\nsin\nisper\nbe the reason for the difference between our results. The so-callei\ninhibition of psi observed by Rhine and others when subjects have gone oi\ntoo long at one sitting must also be reconsidered in the light of the fact\nof temporal dislocation. Suppose that there is no inhibition, but that th\nresult of the continuation of the experiment is that subjects tend to star\ngetting hits one or two ahead of or behind the card turned up. Sucl\ntemporal dislocation would cause a decrease of score in a pack limited tf\nfive cards of each kind such as Rhine uses (though not in a pack of randon\nconstitution such as that used by Soal) since a guess determined by somt\nother card would be less likely to be right as judged by the card turned up\nAn examination of Rhine\u2019s score sheets would show whether this was, if\nfact, taking place. If so, the explanation is quite a different one from thai\nof inhibition.\nAnother practical point is the desirability, if temporal localisation is\npossible, of adopting some system of regional scoring, as, for example, b}'\n\u00ae\ncounting hits, not on the card turned up, but on any card within a region oli\nfive about the one turned up. This is the scoring method that I am nowj\u2018\u201cf\nusing. The Zener pack with five cards each of five different kinds is,|\n\u201c\nhowever, quite unsuitable for such a method of scoring since the rnean*'^\nchance expectation of hits becomes so high as to make the test unworkably\ninsensitive. For this method of scoring, it is desirable to have a larger\nnumber of individuals in the pack and consequently a lower mean chancel\u00ae'\nexpectation of success. I have, therefore, now returned to the old method\nof using playing cards, so having fifty-two different individuals in the pack\"!-\u2019-;'\ninstead of five. Unfortunately it appears as if the rate of psi scoring is'\u2122\ndecreased as the number of alternative responses is increased, so the greater '\u201cJ\nsensitivity of the playing card pack is partly counterbalanced by a lowered\nrate of scoring. For many purposes, fifty-two individuals is not enough,\nand for exact study of temporal displacement, it would be better to have\nthe number of chance determined successes very small compared with\nthose indicating genuine psi success. I am, therefore, experimenting with\nmethods in which the chance expectation is very much smaller than with\na pack of playing cards, so far without success.\nAnother unexpected feature of experimental results is the tendency of\ntemporal dislocation, on the whole, to be in the direction of guessing\nahead. I understand that Soal in his latest work has found his subject\nguessing ahead. In my own experiments, that also is the tendency. If\nthis is general, we must again ask \u201cWhy?\u201d Still odder was Seal\u2019s\nfinding of a tendency for the guesses just before the card turned up to be\nbelow mean chance expectation. I have found indications of the same\ntendency, although my minimum is not itself significant, and I should\nattach no importance to it if it had not been more adequately shown by\nSoal. It looks as if the probability of the response to a card increased to a\nmaximum some seconds before it was turned up, then declined to a point j\u00ae**\nat which it was less likely that that response was given than any other F\u00ae\nresponse, as if the subject at the minimum point both knew the card and i\n^\nalso knew that it was not a correct response but belonged to the past.\nAgain if we could explain why this is so, we might hope to advance in I\u00ae\u00ae\nunderstanding of the phenomena. die\nEven the experimental results achieved so far have given us many\nmen\n\fCall\nffiei\n:fas\nlattl\n\u00bbstai\nSlit\ntedi\nndd\nSOB\n:du|\nDtk\ni66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 13\nunsolved problems which give hope of future more complete under-\nstanding.\nI wish now to turn to another question\u2014that of the aims which experi-\nmentalists should now set themselves in studying the psi phenomena.\nRhine complained in his first book that, in this field, every experimenter\nregards it as his task to prove the reality of the phenomena all over again\nias if it had never been done before. If it was arguably necessary when\nRhine started his work, it surely is so no longer. By different methods, a\nnumber of workers have obtained under stringent experimental conditions\npositive results which cannot reasonably be attributed to chance or to\nexperimental error. The work of obtaining these results has been labor-\nious, and great credit is due to those who have undertaken it. A mere\nrepetition of that work now would be a great waste of time. Let us get on\nto other problems, to be solved by other methods. If we meet with sceptics\njj\ni, as to the reality of the phenomena we are studying, let us refer them to the\n'j. researches of Rhine, of Soal, and of Tyrrell and not succumb to the\nID\ntemptation of trying to satisfy them ourselves.\nThe reason for calling this a temptation is that the methods appropriate\n^j!to a research intended to establish the reality of the phenomena are not\ngenerally appropriate to a research intended to elucidate the character and\nthe conditions of the phenomena. The investigator seeking to establish\nthe reality of the phenomenon repeats his experiments a large number of\ntimes under identical conditions. He aims at getting enormous odds\nagainst a chance explanation of his results and .is unwilling to introduce\nvariations in method which may be unfavourable to positive results and\n,'may therefore reduce the' significance of his total score. He also feels it\nnecessary to safeguard himself against critics who will attribute his results\nto dishonesty or incompetence, so he has one or more impartial witnesses\nas observers of his experiments whose testimony can establish that he\nhas obtained the results he says he has under the conditions he has\ndescribed.\nIndefinite reduplication of witnessed experiments has been valuable in\nthe past when the primary object of experimenters was to establish the\nreality of the phenomena. If we agree that this reality has now been\nsufficiently established, the need for these methods has passed and they\n'should not be allowed to become standardised methods for future experi-\nments. When experimenters have as their primary purpose the under-\nstanding and control of the phenomena, frequent variation of conditions\nis necessary, and those variations will be most fruitful of results which\nlead to reduction or extinction of the phenomena. Workers must be\ncontent with such moderate standards of significance as are used in other\nbranches of scientific research, since the time available for any course of\nexperiments is limited, and time spent in reduplication of experiments\nunder identical conditions is time lost for the more important task of\nworking under variable conditions.\nEven the provision of witnesses, valuable for the establishment of the\nreality of the occurrence of an unlikely phenomenon, may be an impedi-\nment to research once that reality has been established. The work of\na research worker in any other field (let us say on the psychology of colour\n[\nvision) would be badly held up if all his experiments had to be witnessed.\nlira\nha\u00ab\netk\n:pai\ninji\nreal\nffli\nki\nml\nml\nmil\n\fRobert H. Thouless, M.A., Ph.D. [part;\nTime is limited and possible witnesses with expert knowledge of experi-\nmental methods are busy with their own tasks. Insistence on the presence\nof witnesses must have the effect of reducing frequency of experiment and\nfreedom of variation of condition. Once the reality of the phenomena is\ntaken as established, witnessing is no more necessary than in any otheri\nbranch of scientific investigation. Undoubtedly there will be error and\nincompetence in experimental research in this as in all other topics. It\nwill be subjected to the usual check that an erroneous finding by one,\nworker will be corrected by the confirmatory work of others. It is true\nthat not every laboratory has a successful experimental subject available, but\nalready there are probably more independent workers on the psi pheno-\nmena than on any other psychological topic, and it is an encouraging fact\nthat even odd and unexpected results are being confirmed by independent\nworkers. The check of independent confirmation is working to a very\nconsiderable extent.\nIt may be objected that although we think the reality of the phenomena\nis sufficiently established, future ages may not. The early experimentalists\nwere satisfied with results which are now generally regarded as incon-\nclusive. May not future workers adopt more stringent criteria of reality\nand find our experiments also inconclusive ? Certainly they may, and if they\ndo, let them do their own more stringent experiments of verification.\nFurther repetition of the type of experiments for proving the reality of;\nthe psi phenomena which we have been doing will not convince future\ngenerations if they are not convinced by what has already been done. I wish\nonly to argue that the question of reality has been settled for the present\nand so far as we can settle it. We must leave to the future the problem\nof what criteria would satisfy the future.\nIf we agree that the type of experimental research in the psi phenomena\nnow necessary is one in which we try to find out as much as we can about\nthe phenomena by experiments in which conditions of working are varied\nas much as possible, we are immediately faced by the practical difficulty\nwhich is perhaps the principal obstacle at present to fruitful research along\nthese lines. In any experimental research, mere random variation of\nconditions of experiment is not enough. We must vary our conditions in\nsuch a way as to try to obtain answers to definite questions. The most\npressing need to further fruitful research is that we should know what\nquestions to ask. The questions partly arise out of the research itself\n;\nthey are partly initiated by the propounding of suitable hypotheses.\nThus research on colour vision has been largely directed by the three-\ncolour hypothesis put forward by Young and elaborated by Helmholtz.\nThis hypothesis may be right or wrong, but there can be no question as to\nits fruitfulness. Researches directed by it have solved many more problems\nthan could have been solved by random or undirected research, although it\nhappens that the problem of whether or not there are three primary colour\nprocesses has not yet been solved. It does not matter much now if this\nhypothesis proves to be wrong. The positive results of investigations\ninspired by it would remain as evidence of the fruitfulness of the hypo-\nthesis.\nI think it is a misfortune of our subject that speculation about the psi\nprocesses has not been fruitful of problems for research. Speculation there\niatl\nifat\nmay\nstha\nBpet\npvf\nmdi\ni(s[\n|U!\n'T(\n\fi66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 15\nhas been in plenty, but not of the kind required by the experimental worker.\n\u00b0fiSpeculations, for example, about the psi processes as products of a\n\u201c subliminal self \u201d may be of genuine value, but they have not this value\nthat they set problems for experimental investigation. It is speculations\nof a different type that we still need. The test of the speculation which\nmay be expected to be fruitful for the direction of experimental research\nis that it should lead to clearly defined expectations which may be tested\nexperimentally. Our problem then is to devise an experiment which can\nprove whether these expectations are fulfilled. If we find they are not,\nthen the hypothesis is proved to be wrong and a step forward has been\ntaken. If they are fulfilled then the hypothesis may be right, and we must\nfind more expectations to test. The fruitful hypothesis is not necessarily\nthe true one. Indeed any hypothesis we think of in our arm-chairs is\nlikely to turn out to be not wholly adequate to the facts. But in the testing\nof it and the finding out of where it is inadequate, we are achieving our\ngoal of advancing our understanding of the phenomena in question.\nIt is my impression that we have been lacking in such hypotheses and\nthat consequently much of the research in the psi phenomena has been\nundirected and unfruitful. It is probably a much more difficult subject\nto speculate on than is colour vision, and it may demand new and un-\nfamiliar ways of thinking. But let us not forget that it is a need no less\nurgent than that of continued experimental research. The only limitation\nof speculation useful in this way is that it should pose definite problems\nfor experimental investigation, that it should lead to experimentally\nverifiable expectations which we can clearly state.\nLet us not be deterred from bold speculation by the fear lest our specu-\nlations should be wrong. The process of speculation and experimental\ntesting is a self-correcting one. It does not matter if a specula,tion is\nwrong ;\nif so if will be proved wrong by experiment, and that will be a\nstep forward. The caution which we properly observe in drawing con-\nclusions from our experiments is out of place in the preliminary task of\ndevising hypotheses to be tested.\nI cannot, of course, suggest what these fruitful hypotheses may be ,\n1\ncan only state what has been the hypothesis that has guided nay own\nresearches in the psi phenomenon. This is a point of view which has\nbeen reached in discussion between Dr. Wiesner and myself and, in wMt\nfollows, it would be impossible to disentangle the contributions made by\nus both. JUT}\nThe essential point from which we start is that expressed by bergson\nin his Presidential address to this Society. To Bergson, the brain was not\nan organ whose function is that of transforming material vibrations into\nmental states but an \u201c instrument of selection charged with choosing, m\nthe immense field of our virtual perceptions, those which are to be actual-\nised \u201d. \u201c I think \u201d, he says, \u201d that we perceive virtually many more things\n, \u2022 11 1.1 . 1 _ 4-U^ r\\nr Knn\\r\nthan we perceive actually, and that here once more the part that our body\nplays is that of shutting out from our field of consciousness all that is of\nno practical interest to us, all that does not lend itself to our action.\nTelepathy is the only aspect of the psi function which Bergson considers,\nand he suggests that this is an action between personalities analogous to\nthe phenomena of endosmosis, and he continues : If such endosmosis\n\fi6 Robert H. Thouless, M.A., Ph.D. [part'\nft\u00a3\n(lt(\nliltC\nila\nli\nexists, we can foresee that nature will have taken every precaution toi\nneutralise its effect, and that certain mechanisms must be specially charged'\nwith the duty of throwing back into the unconscious the presentations so'\nprovoked, for they would be very embarrassing in everyday life One or|\nanother of these presentations might yet, however, at times pass through\nas contraband, especially if the inhibiting mechanisms were functioning\nbadly.\u201d In other words, Bergson thought of the psi function (or rather\nthe only aspect of it which he considered) as a possible kind of reaction\nnormally suppressed because unserviceable for the demands of practical\nlife, and kept suppressed so long as the organism maintained the attitude\nof attention to life, but liable to manifest itself under conditions in which\nthat controlling mechanism was thrown out of action by the development\nof an attitude of inattention to life. It is curious that, having put forward a\npoint of view which seems so suggestive of possibilities for experimental\nresearch, Bergson should have shown no interest in this aspect of his\nhypothesis, but argued instead that it was necessary to start the study of\ntelepathy by the historical and not the experimental method.\nLet us adopt Bergson\u2019s speculation as a starting point and consider its\ngeneral plausibility, how we may profitably amplify it, and how it may be\nused as a guiding hypothesis for experimental research.\nFirst, the plausibility of the point of view must be considered as much\ngreater now than when Bergson put it forward since we are much more\ninclined to the explanation of mental functions as controlling and limiting\nmore general behaviour possibilities than we were a quarter of a century\nu\nconception is, however, still generally an unfamiliar one, and\nthe habit of our minds makes us prone to regard higher mental functions\nas always extending rather than limiting the possibilities of behaviour and\nperception. It may, therefore, be worth while to illustrate what is meant\nby an example drawn from the field of visual perception which is strictly\nanalogous to the relation which Bergson suggests between telepathy and\nthe normal perceptual and intellectual activity of the brain.\nIf we ask anyone what are the advantages of binocular vision in the\nhigher vertebrates, the answer given in the vast majority of cases is that\nthe use of two eyes with a common field of vision enables its possessor to\nsee depth or distance, and that, without binocular vision, the world would\nbe seen as fiat. Yet both common observation and laboratory experiment\nshow that this answer must be wrong. If we close one eye, the world does\nnot look fiat ;\nobjects still appear to be at different distances from us. In\nsome cases, the impression of depth is enhanced by using one eye only, as,\nor example, in looking at pictures which, if they appear flat to two-eyed\nvision, may appear three-dimensional when looked at with one eye.\nMoreover, under the simplest conditions of stimulation when the retina\nof one eye is uniformly illuminated, the impression gained is not that of a\nat lighted surface but of looking at a luminous mist with an indeterminate\nquality of depth. Also, when the efficiency of our visual perception is\nimpaired by brain injury although visual sensations remain, it is not found\nworld becomes flat. On the contrary, what is lost is the\nability to see things as surfaces ; everything appears to have a spongy,\nindeterminate depth. These facts are inexplicable on the idea that binoc-\nular vision causes perception of depth ;\nthey become clear if we adopt the\nfief\ni\nA\n\f'.\u00abI\n66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 17\nipposite view and suppose that perception of depth is primitive and that\nhe function of the two eyes and of the perceptual process which they\nerve is to limit the appearance of depth. The idea can be roughly\nxpressed by saying that the two eyes serve not to enable us to see depth\nlut to see flatness. The visual perceptual field thus limited is, of course,\nf more value to the organism possessing it than the original indeterminate\nepth perception. The limitation of depth perception also means that it\necomes more closely related to real distances in the outside world. There\n> less depth in a picture looked at with two eyes, but its appearance,\nkerefore, corresponds more closely with the real external fact that it is\nainted on a plane surface. By limiting its depth perception by the use\nf its two eyes, the organism has made its depth perception more useful\n3 it.\nNow let us apply this kind of thought to the psi phenomena, acting on\nle hints given by Bergson. Let us consider a hypothetical primitive\nrganism possessing the psi capacity in its most extreme imaginable form,\nke Leibniz\u2019s monads mirroring all facts in the universe without any\nmitation with respect to space or time. It would possess a capacity of no\nossible biological value to it, since acquaintance with facts is only service-\nble so far as it discriminates between near and distant facts and between\nresent and past or future ones. Also it would be a psi capacity quite\nndetectable by any experiment. If we had a subject whose guesses were\netermined by the orders of all packs of cards in the universe, past, present\nnd future, no method of experiment could distinguish his condition\n\u2022om that of a subject with no psi capacity whatever. The possibility of\netection of psi determined reactions depends on their being limited in\n3me degree to a particular pack of cards which is used for scoring. They\nlay not be completely limited to that pack, but some degree of limitation\n1\n1 necessary to make detection possible.\nOur imagination of an organism with completely unlimited psi is, of\n3urse, purely fantastic. We can suppose that such an organism never\ndsted, but that any primitive psi function always possessed some degree\nf limitation. On the other hand, observation and experiment both seem\n) make it clear that the psi function is less limited in these respects than is\ninsory perception.\nLet us now take a step not taken by Bergson, although it seems to be a\natural extension of his thought, and suppose that psi is the primitive way\n1\ny which organisms oriented themselves to the outside world and that the\nTOlution of the sense organs and of sensory perception was a later acquired\n. leans, of greater biological usefulness because more limited. Perhaps we\nlay take a simple example of what is meant by saying that the more strict\n1 mitation in space and time of sensory perception makes it more bio-\n}\u2022 Igically useful than the relatively unlimited psi function. Let us suppose\nlat a deer had to rely on its psi function (clairvoyance) to make it aware of\nle danger from a tiger. If this psi function worked as it appears to in\niperiment, it would combine the advantage of giving warning before the\nger came within visual range, with the grave disadvantage of leaving the\nser uncertain whether its indications referred to a tiger near by, or to one\nlat was two hundred and fifty miles away, and of whether its danger\njferred to a tiger in the vicinity now, or to one that would be there\ni\n\fi8 Robert H. Thouless, M.A., Ph.D. [par\nstljl\nrices\nncsr\nce;\ntomorrow. The deer would be incomparably better off if he trusted to th\nstrictly limited sense of vision and hearing, when it would be left peacefull\nfeeding until a tiger was near enough for it to be necessary to do somethin^ is'\nabout it. The risk that sometimes the tiger would be too near for escap\nbefore it was seen would be a small price to pay for the relief from\ntendency to react which might in the majority of cases be set off by\nsituation in which the danger was remote in space or time.\nOr, to take an example nearer home, let us suppose that each one of u\npresent here were so open to psi influences that his thoughts were effec\ntively determined by those of everyone else in the room. One is perhap\nwondering whether his clothing coupons will be sufficient for a new suit\nanother is thinking that the speaker is going on too long and that she wil\nbe too late to cook the fish for supper, and so on. If we had such capacity\nit would not be a wonderfully effective e.xtension of our powers ;\nit would\non the contrary, produce a very ineffective confusion. We are clearH*\nbetter off if our knowledge of the thoughts of others is limited to th|.~^\nthoughts of the one person who is speaking and so is in auditory communilSM\ncation with us. As compared with the possibility of unlimited telepathii j\nP\npowers, this restriction of knowledge of the thoughts of others to thosi i\nwho are producing the sound waves of speech in our immediate vicinip i\nis a limitation, but clearly a limitation which increases efficiency of interiwc\ncommunication. If we had to choose between the obtaining of informatioi ip\nby psi and obtaining it through our senses, we should unhesitatingly choos( jffio\nthe latter. >\nThis leads us to consider the possibility that the psi function is th( I T1\nearlier in evolutionary history and that it may have been suppressed bv|ij*ci\nthe development of the special senses which, with their limitation to what ii\nhere and now, serve much more efficiently the biological end of securing\nthe survival and efficient adaptation of the organism. The view herf\nsuggested is, of course, radically different from that of F. W. H. Myers\nwho regarded psi as a newly developing human function which woulc\nenormously enhance our range of knowledge and bring us in contact witF r\nthe spiritual world. The difference between his view and this may perhaps i a\nbe expressed roughly by saying that he regarded the psi function as if 'in\nhuman power stretching forward to the angels ;\nthe view that I an]\nsuggesting is that it is going back to the amoeba. Rhine too has suggestec\nthat it is a late acquisition in evolution, rather surprisingly, since Rhine is one *\nof the few investigators who has studied the psi function in an animal, iai\niisc\nThe view that I am suggesting may, of course, not be right ;\nit is pu1\nforward as an example of a speculation which imposes a number of cleai |kl\nproblems for experimental research. So far the expectations it raises seen :\nto be fulfilled. If psi is a more primitive function, normally suppressed bj :\nthe higher mental activities of perception and reasoning, we should expect ,\njc\non the whole, that conditions favourable to the higher mental activities jie\nwould be unfavourable to psi and vice versa. Alcohol is known to be Pii\nunfavourable to the efficient activity of the higher mental functions ;\nit is pvv\nreported to be favourable to psi. The attitude of inattention to the prac- f\n'\ntical demands of life induced by muscular relaxation is reported to favour\npsi, although most people find muscular tension favourable to ordinary |le\ncerebral activities. I also have the impression (although I have no experi-J\"-\ni\n\fP.(i|66] Present Position of Experimental Research into Telepathy, etc. 19\nof nental proof) that the absence of any effort to guess right is also favourable\nhi ,0 psi, although efficiency in any intellectual or perceptual activity requires\nlii justained conation. The standard conditions I have adopted in my own\ncjj uccessful psi experiments include a moderate dose of alcohol, muscular\niffl elaxation, and absence of any effort towards guessing right. The testi-\nbr nony of other workers confirms the effectiveness of the first and second\nondition, and I think the third is favourable too, but other investigators\nifi feem to give no clear indications on the subject.\n\u2122 Clarification of the conditions for psi success is of considerable practical\na mportance since a knowledge of them may enable us to train subjects to\na ;ive successful results and, therefore, make psi experiments possible to\n51 iivery research worker who wants to investigate them without it being\nat lecessary for him to wait for the lucky chance of finding a suitable subject.\nThe suggestion I am making is that the favourable conditions are those\n'i iiummed up in Bergson\u2019s phrase \u201c inattention to life ,\nbecause these con-\ni ditions are those in which the higher mental functions are reduced in\nlit .jfficiency so that the more primitive psi function is no longer effectively\n4 suppressed. The spontaneously successful psi subjects seem often to be\nmore or less dissociated, and, therefore, to have a pathological attitude of\nik i\nnattention to life. The non-pathological psi subjects may be those who\nI'jfiiave the power of voluntarily adopting an attitude of inattention to life,\ntJ 1 power which probably most people could acquire although we should\nJi'easonably expect more difficulty in those subjects who are habitually\n;ense.\nt\n^\nThere seems to be another indication for experiment in this system of\n.1 speculations ;\nthe possibility that the place to look for psi is amongst the\nJ animals low in the evolutionary scale. I know of few researches on this\nnjisubject, and these are confined to the higher vertebrates. Experiments on\nisv' invertebrates would be difficult and I do not see how the difficulties can\nbe overcome. I have tried to think of an experiment on a hive of bees (a\nhopeful place for finding psi phenomena) but the practical difficulties are\nenormous. Particularly there is the obvious difficulty that we have in-\n^ sufficiently accurate knowledge of the limits of the sensory capacities of\n^\nanimals very remote from ourselves.\nMay I repeat that the speculations contained in the later part of this\nJ\naddress are not to be taken as claimed by me to be true. Perhaps they\n( ;are flights of fancy with no foundation. Primarily they are intended as\nguides to the sort of questions we may submit to the test of experimental\n\u2022\nresearch. They can be proved to be well or ill founded, not by argument,\ni but by the results of such research.\nI Finally I should like to suggest that the general result of our survey is\n)\nthat the present position of experimental research in these topics is a\nf hopeful one. Existing researches have not merely proved the existence of\n'\nthe psi phenomena ;\nthey have also found out some odd and unexplained\nthings about them that are a challenge to further research. Let us now\ngive up the task of trjnng to prove again to the satisfaction of the sceptical\nthat the psi effect really exists, and try instead to devote ourselves to the\ntask of finding out all we can about it. With fuller knowledge of its nature,\nthe difficulties of believing in its existence may appear less formidable than\nthey do now.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nPART 167\nEXPERIMENTS IN PRECOGNITIVE TELEPATHY\nBy S.

Oscar Wilde.\nIn:\naf:\nT\nThe experiments we are about to describe were conducted over a periods\nof two and a quarter years with a Sensitive who cumulatively demon- I\nstrated striking powers of extra sensory perception to an extent which we |\nconsider admits of no reasonable denial, and in watertight conditions !\nwhich we claim admit of no alternative hypothesis.\nIt was not without considerable discussion that we decided on the bold\nphrase \u201c Precognitive Telepathy \u201d by which to describe our experiments.\nSuch a title would seem to imply that the authors subscribe to some more\nor less well-defined theory as to the essential nature of the phenomena\nthey attempt to elucidate. This is true in a limited sense, but such theories\nas we have suggested are lightly held and we realise that, like most hypo-\ntheses in this difficult field, they may have to suffer extensive revision in\nthe light of future knowledge.\nWe are reasonably convinced, however, that the phenomena belong to\nthat class of unusual mental happenings generally described as \u201c tele-\npathic \u201d inasmuch as they seem to demand the presence of a suitable\nAgent as well as that of a sensitive Subject ; we have found indeed that\nwhen some persons try to take the part of Agent the phenomena apparently\ndisappear, and that in one case a change of Agent was followed by a striking\nvariation in the results. And the description \u201c precognitive \u201d telepathy\n;%it\n|res\n)tui\niiir\n!'\n30\n|\n\fP,4I\n167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 25\nalone indicates the salient feature of the results obtained. We have\nperforce had to use such terms as are most readily understood to convey\nthe desired meaning, though we are well aware that it is illogical to apply\nthe word \u201c guess \u201d as we have done, for example, to our Subject\u2019s powers\nof card-cognition that we claim show extra sensory perception ;\nand that\nthis word \u201c perception \u201d itself, as Dr R. H. Thouless, our President,\npointed out in his Presidential Address,^ ill describes the operation in-\nvolved. Such terms serve their purpose well enough until greater know-\nledge of the phenomena demands a more exact terminology.\nAll our results were obtained through the medium of one gifted Sensi-\ntive, a gentleman who will be referred to as B.S. ;\nand the experiments\nare experiments in guessing cards with a chance of success equal to one in\nfive.\nIt is well known to most readers that cards bearing five distinct geo-\nmetrical symbols, commonly called Zener cards, have been in use for\nmany years in investigations of telepathy and clairvoyance carried out by\nDr Rhine and others in America in the psychology departments of Duke\nand Columbia universities. In many of these experiments a Subject\nendeavoured to guess the symbol on a card that was being looked at by an\nexperimenter seated behind a screen or in an adjoining room. In some\nj eases it was established beyond reasonable doubt that certain Subjects\nt ivere able to score over a considerable period many more correct hits than\n: the theory of probability would predict. In these experiments it was the\neard that was contemporaneously gazed at by the Agent that was, as a\n.\ngeneral rule, the card on which the Percipient scored his successes. But\n)ur own Subject, B.S., possesses the striking idiosyncrasy that it is\n) ipparently more natural for him to score a hit, not on the card that the\nAgent is looking at, but on the cards which immediately precede or follow\nj.t in the sequence.\nTo many readers this may seem strange and improbable, but this\nstrangeness arises in part, we think, from the fact that at the back of our\nminds we tend to regard extra sensory cognition as only a more mysterious\ncind of sensory perception.\nVisual perception takes place in the \u201c present \u201d moment, or more\n1 strictly in a short slab of duration which embraces the \u201c present \u201d moment.\nIxi^Living organisms, as Bergson points out, are supremely interested in the\nS\n; present moment because it is in that moment alone that they react with\n:heir material environment by means of their sensory and motor apparatus.\nOur brains are instruments of action, and normal perception is, according\nI\no Bergson, a virtual or incipient action directed towards external bodies.\nVhen we look at any object we are exploring the possibilities of action of\n)ur bodies upon that object. Thus our normal consciousness is primarily\nV ;oncerned not with the past, or the future, but with the present,\npjij But we have no right to suppose that the extra sensory faculty (or psi\nt('J, unction as Dr Thouless calls it), operating from a subliminal level, is\n^ :\nprimarily concerned with the present moment in time or focussed upon\n>ur actions and reactions with our material environment. It may have\njjJ 10 particular preference for the present moment over other moments past\njjj'. \u00bbr future. We know that mediums will often correctly give incidents\nr ! ^ Proc. xlvii, i ff.\n\f26 5. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [PARTi 167]\nconnected with the Sitter\u2019s past, and often enough such incidents will bei\ntrivial and of no practical importance, indicating perhaps a subliminal\nfunctioning very different from the purposeful processes of the conscious:\nmind. If the above surmise as to the nature of the psi faculty is correct,\nit is really rather surprising that Dr Rhine discovered so many Subjects\nwho tended to cognise the card actually in focus at the moment.\nIt is possible that powers of card cognition are more widespread than\nhas been hitherto supposed and that many persons who fail to score on\nthe actual card are yet successful in cognising certain other cards in the\nsequence. Such a displacement effect, if it were spread out over a great\nmany positions in the sequence, might easily escape detection by an\nexperimenter who employed cards bearing only five distinct symbols.\nOn the other hand, for Subjects such as B.S., whose faculty of extra\nsensory cognition seems to be concentrated mainly on positions one or\ntwo behind or ahead of the card which is actually in the focus of attention,\nthe use of a random distribution of five cards with five distinct symbols is\nquite suitable.\nThe main difficulty that has to be faced in these experiments is not the\nphenomenon of displacement, but the fact that this displacement is\nusually towards the future. Moreover it appears to be a real displacement\nin future time. The simplest hypothesis which will cover the facts is the\nhypothesis that B.S. somehow becomes cognisant of what is going to be\nin the Agent\u2019s mind about two and a half seconds later. There are\npossibly other more complicated hypotheses that might be advanced, but\nnone of them has either the clarity or the economy of the one we have\njust stated.\nIn many of our experiments the card looked at by the Agent was\ngoverned by another experimenter, who drew (by touch) counters from a\nbag or bowl whose colour determined the card to be looked at. To a\nsmall extent, therefore, human volition as well as accident determined the\nchoice of the card which was \u201c foreseen \u201d by the Sensitive [see argument\nP- 53 )-\nNow, many people will be reluctant to admit the possibility of pre-\ndicting events\u2014or at least certain kinds of events\u2014to whose fulfilment the\nfree-will of human beings is a contributing factor. We can of course\nmake prophecies about the future conduct of a given person upon a basis\nof our present knowledge of that person\u2019s character and habits, and such\nprophecies may have a high probability of being realised. Today is\n21 October 1942 and it would be fairly safe for anyone to predict that\n9 a.m. Monday 26 October will find S.G.S. in the Mill Lane lecture rooms\nat Cambridge. It would be sufficient for the prophet to know (a) that\nS.G.S. is scheduled to lecture at this particular time and place during the\npresent session and (b) that he enjoys good health and has not missed a\nlecture since he came to Cambridge three years ago. But if a clairvoyante\nwere to prediet that in the year following the end of the present war\nK.M.G. would be killed by a falling tile while crossing a street in a storm,\nand if the prediction were duly fulfilled, it w'ould scarcely be plausible to\nargue that the prophecy was a deduction based upon the clairvoyante \u2019s\nknowledge of the present state of the universe at the time of the sitting.\nThe concatenation of causes that culminated in the fatal event might\n:r.vo\njir.i\nami\n>iri:\naral\n'!ici\nWe\nJ\u2019e\nme\n(jUf\nles\npre\nsell\nwa\nexi\nVO\nk'\nthi\nof\nno\nmi\nde\nof\nin\ntil\ntf\nat\npi\nC(\nIf\nCl\nif\n\f27\nI\n167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy\ni' involve factors which ranged from an alteration in the courses of the\n'\nwinds produced by the melting of ice in the polar seas, to the vic-\nI\ntim\u2019s decision to shelter for a moment in a doorway and her consequent\narrival on the scene of the accident at the precise instant when the tile\nfell.\nHowever, many well-attested cases have been recorded in which a\ndreamer foresees an unpredictable future event in his own life in minute\nand vivid detail as though he were present as an actor or spectator. In\nsuch cases the dream seems to be a sort of duplication of a future scene.\nWe need only refer the reader to that admirable collection of first-class\ncases of \u201c duplicating \u201d prevision made by Mr Saltmarsh from records\npublished in the Proceedings and Journal of this Society over a period\n'\nof many years.^ There are also numerous cases described by Dunne,\nOsty, Richet and others.\nReferring to this kind of precognition Osty writes \u201c :\n\u201c Douze annees\n'\nd\u2019experiences personelles avec un grand nombre de sujets metagnomes et\nsur un nombre important de personnes, m\u2019ont donne la certitude absolue\nqu\u2019il est des etres humains capables de preconnaitre le devenir des hom-\nmes. De cela j\u2019ai le meme degre de certitude que de I\u2019existence de ce\nque nous appelons la terre, le soleil, les etoiles, les mineraux, les vegetaux,\nles animaux. C\u2019est un fait verifiable par I\u2019experience et contre lequel ne\nprevaudront pas longtemps nos prejuges maintenant que des hommes de\nscience ont le courage et la curiosite de se rendre compte.\u201d\nIf future events in the lives of human beings can be foreseen in this\nway, we can only conclude that in some form or other the future already\nexists ;\nand to what extent \u201c free-will \u201d can at the same time remain a\nreality is indeed a tremendous question.\nBut for Bergson there can be no prevision of events in which human\nvolitions are involved. The future of a living being cannot be foreseen\nbecause it is being created at every instant. Real Time, for Bergson, is not\nthe pseudo time which science invented for the measurement of the motion\nof material bodies, but is the indivisible flow of consciousness itself. It is\nperpetual change or \u201c becoming \u201d, without any underlying substance\nthat suffers change, since all substance is change. On this view time is\nnon-spatial and the Space-Time of Minkowski and Einstein is nothing\nmore than a convenient fiction created by the intellect for the purpose of\ndescribing the motions of the celestial bodies.\nThe well-attested facts of \u201c duplicating \u201d precognition cut at the roots\nof Bergson\u2019s theory of time. His theory of memory has great significance\nin its bearing on the phenomenon of telepathy, but his philosophy of\ntime affords us no help in the study of precognition. Perhaps it was for\nthis reason that Bergson, although once President of this Society, never\nattempted to work out in detail the application of his philosophy to\npsychical research and thereby encounter the stumbling block of pre-\ncognitive phenomena.\nMore promising for the study of precognition are those theories which\nregard time as a space-like dimension. Bergson may be right in his\ncontention that the time of experience cannot be truly represented as\nspace, but such descriptive hypotheses may be useful even if they are\n^ Proc. xlii, 49 ff. \u2018\u2018La Connaissance Supra-normale, p. 177.\n\f28 iS. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\n|\nfundamentally untrue. The well-known theory of J. W. Dunne is based !\nessentially on the ideas of Hinton, who regarded time as a fourth dimension\nin which bodies have extension as well as in the three dimensions of space. ,\nBut Dunne\u2019s theory, built up on the conception of an infinite regress of\ntime dimensions, has been criticised by Professor Broad and others.\nProfessors C. D. Broad and H. Habberley Price have put forward a hypo- i\nthesis to account for the fact of prevision which postulates a second ji\ndimension of time at right angles to the first. But we have not the space f\nat our disposal to discuss these theories.\nOf the various hypotheses which have been advanced to throw light\non the phenomenon of precognition, perhaps that of Mr Saltmarsh has\nmost significance for our experiments. It is expounded by him in his\nimportant Paper already cited,^ and has for its starting point what is\nknown in psychology as the \u201c specious present \u201d. The \u201c present moment \u201d\nhas a definite duration, and an act of perception is not instantaneous but\noccupies a small slab of duration which includes a bit of the \u201c past \u201d and I\na bit of the \u201c future \u201d. This interval of duration is known as the \u201c specious 1\npresent \u201d. Now Mr Saltmarsh supposes that this span of perception is I\ngreatly extended at subconscious levels below the threshold of normal I\nconsciousness. Thus a future event which is outside the \u201c specious s\npresent \u201d of consciousness at the normal level, may yet lie well within j\nthe \u201c specious present \u201d of consciousness at a subliminal level. That is I\nto say, an event which is still in the \u201c future \u201d for the normal consciousness I\nis already a \u201c present \u201d event for some stratum of the subliminal mind.\nIn normal persons there may be no mechanism whereby this knowledge\nat the subliminal level can pass into the normal consciousness, but in the\ncase of psychical Sensitives there may be a kind of osmosis which allows\nthe subliminal content to infiltrate into the normal \u201c specious present \u201d.\nIf this takes place, it will appear as though the Sensitive has precognised\na future event. This of course is no more than a skeleton outline of Mr\nSaltmarsh\u2019s conception and does no sort of justice to it. In his Paper he\nworks out the theory in great detail and with much ingenuity.\nYet it is not easy to apply Mr Saltmarsh\u2019s theory to the kind of pre-\ncognition exhibited by B.S. For our Sensitive does not obtain pre-\ncognitive knowledge of what he is going to see through his own eyes in,\nsay, a couple of seconds\u2019 time. What he apparently precognises is what\nis going to be in the mind of another person in two seconds\u2019 time. The\nphenomenon is not one of simple precognitive perception ;\nit is enormously\ncomplicated by the addition of telepathy. But there does seem to be an j\nintimate connection between the results of our experiments and Mr |\nSaltmarsh\u2019s theory of an extension of the specious present.\nWe have alluded to Bergson\u2019s theory of memory. We cannot elaborate\nthis here but, in brief, he postulates two types of memory embodying our I\nindividual past : one, the habit or bodily memory which is simply the\ncapacity of our physical body and brain to reproduce certain organised\nmovements by means of motor mechanisms which have been built up\nwithin the nervous system ;\nand the other, what Bergson names the Pure\nMemory, a psychical memory which represents the conservation of all\nour past mental states. The Pure Memory must not however be regarded\n^ Proc. xlii, 49 ff.\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 29\nas a mere lifeless and inert record of such past mental states. It must be\nconsidered rather as something essentially dynamic and fluid, constantly\nadded to at every moment of our lives, being created at each act of per-\nception, and capable of transmuting itself into a thousand mental images\nin the present moment. Our past does not survive in the form of mental\nimages : the mental image is a materialisation, an intellectualisation of an\nunconscious mental state which is nevertheless in a sense its equivalent.\nTelepathy, we suggest, is essentially a case of the influence of one Pure\nMemory by another. It is not, we postulate, the propagation of a mental\nimage from one brain to another, but the development into imagery by a\nmind (P) of some unconscious equivalent which is in the Pure Memory\nof a mind (A). The Pure Memory does not occupy space, and the meta-\nphor of \u201c transferring \u201d or \u201c transmitting \u201d an idea is probably an entirely\nmisleading one. If we adopt Bergson\u2019s theory of memory we shall never\nattempt to visualise the telepathic process as a transmission from one\nbrain to another, after physical models like radiation or electric waves.\nAnd with the abandonment of these spatial metaphors we shall cease to\nthink of the Agent as an active sender and the Percipient as a passive\nreceiver. It may indeed be the Percipient who is the more active partner\nin the transaction, since it is he who has to materialise the unconscious\nmemory-states of another. We say \u201c the memory-states of another \u201d,\nbut it may, again, be that memory in the unconscious state is not such a\nprivate thing as we are wont to suppose. It may be, as William James\nhas suggested, that our memory states pass into a great dynamic reservoir\nof unconscious mental life. No doubt our individual memories carry\nwith them a seal of personality, and our attention to life and action generally\nprevents us from materialising the memories of other people ;\nbut in\nconditions not as yet understood it may well be that a Sensitive can\nmaterialise the memories of another\u2014much in the same way as he nor-\nmally materialises his own (however that may be).\nThe above remarks refer to telepathy in general. But just as there are\ndifferent varieties of normal mental activity, so research may reveal several\nwidely differing types of telepathic functioning. The processes which\ntake place, for instance, in a case of spontaneous telepathy are probably\nj\nvery different from those brought into play by experiments in card-\nI cognition.\nOur experiments, it may be feared, will raise problems rather than\nI\nsolve them. The problem of their interpretation bristles with difficulties.\n1\nBut if it be admitted that we have demonstrated the existence of pre-\ncognitive powers in our Sensitive, we shall at least have contributed\nvaluable experimental data bearing upon the problem of psychological\nTime. It is but a beginning. We trust that our report may stimulate\nI\nothers to prosecute similar enquiries. The way is long and tedious, but\nI the prize is the adventure of climbing a new peak in Darien and scanning\na fresh horizon.\n\f3\u00b0 S. G. Soal and K. M.

There seemed indeed\nlittle evidence of a direct kind that the persons tested, whether considered\nas individuals or in the mass, possessed any faculty for either clairvoyance\nor telepathy.\nHowever, in the autumn of 1939, at the suggestion of Mr Whately\nCarington who was carrying out experiments in telepathy, I re-examined\na large number of my records in order to ascertain whether any of the\nguessers had scored hits, not on the cards focussed by the Agent, but on\nthe immediately preceding or following cards. The two examples given\nbelow illustrate the sort of effect I was trying to discover.\n(i) Actual Card\n+\nGuess\nO\n+\n(ii) Actual Card\n0<-\ns^'\nGuess\n\/S\nw\n(In the above examples the horizontal arrows point to the card which was being\nlooked at by the Agent while the Percipient was making his guess.) ^\nN.B. Example (i) shows a post-cognitive effect, for the successful hit is, as it\nwere, delayed by one place; while example (ii) shows a pre-cognitive effect, for the\nPercipient scores a successful hit before the card is actually lifted from the pack\nfor the Agent to look at.\nIn my previous Paper I called example (i) a ( + i) hit and example (ii)\na (\n- i) hit. But in order to conform with the notation adopted by Dr\nThouless, who is himself experimenting along these lines, I now propose\nto call the postcognitive hits with displacement of one card backwards\n\u2019Proc. xlvi, 152 ff. ^ The symbols used in this diagram are Zener symbols.\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 31\n(-1) hits, and the precognitive hits with displacement of one card\nforwards ( + 1) hits. This reverses the notation employed in my first\nPaper. Similarly when the successful hit refers to the card two places\nahead, I shall call it a precognitive ( + 2) hit, and when it is made on the\ncard two places behind the \u201c actual \u201d card, I shall call it a postcognitive\n(\n- 2) hit ;\nthus again reversing the custom of my previous Paper. If we\nconsider time as a linear dimension, it seems more natural to refer to the\npast as minus and the future as plus than vice versa.\nAmong the records of the 160 persons previously tested, two persons\nwere found whose results showed highly significant successes on both\n(\n+ 1) and (-1) displacements. One of these, referred to as Mrs S.,\nobtained in addition a lesser degree of success on the \u201c actual \u201d card\nlooked at by the Agent. Her success on the actual card, however, petered\nout after the first 1,000 trials while the postcognitive (-1) and pre-\ncognitive ( + 1) successes continued to be highly significant over a series\nof 2,000 guesses. The second person, Mr B.S., the Subject of the present\nexperiments, obtained on the whole no success on the \u201c actual \u201d card\n\u2014\nthough the first few runs at least suggested that he began by scoring on the\nactual card but soon switched off to ( \u00b11) hits. B.S. scored about equally\nwell on both precognitive ( + i) and postcognitive (\n- i) guesses. In fact,\nin a series of 768 ( + i) trials he obtained 194 hits, and in the same number\nof (-1) trials he won 195 hits. These correspond to 3-65 and to 3-74\nStandard Deviations respectively.\nIt will be understood that both Percipients as well as myself (the\nExperimenter) were totally unaware that any success was being obtained\non precognitive or postcognitive hits at the time when the experiments\nwere carried out (1936), for these effects were not even suspected till three\nyears later.\nAnother extremely interesting effect was observed in the records of\nboth Percipients. It was found that when the card to be guessed\n\u2014\ni.e.,\nthe \u201c actual \u201d card\u2014^was sandwiched between two cards of the same\ndenomination, a greater proportion of (\u00b11) hits was noted than the\ntheory of probability would predict. In fact it appeared that in cases\nwhere both a ( + i\n)\nsuccess and a (\n- i\n)\nsuccess were simultaneously possible,\nthe two effects seemed in some degree to reinforce one another. In my\nprevious Paper I called such guesses \u201c multiply-determined \u201d (MD)\nguesses. These are illustrated by the following examples :\n(I) o- (II)\n+ 4-\nIn each case the arrow points to the card actually looked at by the\nAgent, before and after which come cards of the same denomination.\nPreviously I counted only the MD guesses as in example (I), but in the\npresent Report we have included both examples (I) and (II) in the same\ncount, since there seems little reason for making a distinction between the\ntwo types.\nI should like to mention before proceeding that neither of these success-\nful Sensitives was discovered by the blind method of applving routine\ntests indiscriminately to a large number of persons in the hope that a\n\f32 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part |\ngenuine telepathic Percipient would soon appear. I am convinced now t\nthat this is a forlorn hope and that other methods should be adopted in\nthe search for Sensitives. I visited Mrs S. at her house in Richmond only\nafter hearing from her husband that she possessed undoubted psychical\ngifts. B.S. came to the Laboratory where I was carrying out the tests,\nafter reading an article on the experiments which appeared in a Sunday\nnewspaper. He came because he had been successfully amusing his\nfriends for years by his card-cognition feats and because he felt confident\nhe could demonstrate telepathy. Applying tests at random to all and\nsundry is, I now believe, wasteful of both time and energy. It is far better\nto seek out those persons who are reputed among their friends to possess\nparanormal powers.\nNor do I think\u2014in spite of Rhine\u2019s experience to the contrary with his i\nown students\u2014that the English University student is promising material \u2019\nfor psychical investigation. Of the 8o odd students tested at University\nCollege, there was not one who provided even reasonable evidence that\nhe or she possessed any gift for extra sensory perception, and I believe\nDr Thouless\u2019s experience agrees with mine. It is among those who\ncultivate intuition and feeling rather than intellect that we should\nprosecute our enquiries. I offer these observations since it appears to be\nthe rule that whenever a Professor of psychology takes up psychical\nresearch he almost always experiments with students. The mind of the\naverage British student is a more or less logical fact-assimilating machine,\nwhich is at opposite poles to the mind of the intuitive Sensitive. And I\nshould like to add that many psychological laboratories are ill-adapted to\nthe study of extra sensory cognition. Too often they are noisy places with\nstudents scurrying along the corridors to their class-rooms. The Sensitive\ndemands freedom from distraction, the presence of friendly people who\nare prepared to adapt themselves to his mental idiosyncrasies, and, above\nall, the absence of formality or fuss. Neglect of these conditions, which\nexperience has shown to be essential, will lead inevitably to frustration, to\nthe accumulation of negative results and, in the end, to the psychologist\nabandoning the study of a delicate faculty the laws of whose emergence\nhave not been properly understood.\nThe experiments of 1936 with B.S., described in Part II of my previous\nReport,^ left many questions unanswered. It will be remembered that\nthe Zener cards were lifted one by one from a pack of 25 cards in random\norder, each card being exposed for a few seconds to the gaze of an Agent\nwho sat with the experimenter on one side of an opaque screen while the\nSensitive, B.S., sat on the other side. When B.S. had recorded his guess,\nhe tapped on the table with his pencil and the next card was then exposed.\nNow when B.S. scored a ( -f-\n1) precognitive success, it was not clear from\nwhat source he was obtaining his knowledge of the card which was one\nplace ahead. At the moment when he made his guess this card was\nresting face downwards on top of the pack. Was he cognising clair-\nvoyantly the symbol inscribed on this top card, or was he foreseeing what\nwould be in the Agent\u2019s (or Experimenter\u2019s) mind in a few seconds\u2019 time?\nIn the former case future time would play no part in the affair and the\nPercipient\u2019s success could be ascribed to an act of clairvoyant cognition\n* Proc. xlvi, 178 ff.\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 33\nof an event in the present. In the latter case the Sensitive would be truly\nprecognising a future mental event which did not \u201c exist \u201d (in common\nparlance) at the moment when he wrote down his guess. The 1936\nexperiments with B.S. or Mrs S. did not allow me to decide between\nthese two alternatives.\nAgain, was it necessary for anyone to look at the cards for the experiment\nto succeed, or would it have worked equally well if the Experimenter or\nAgent had merely lifted them one by one from the pack without anyone\nseeing the symbols on their faces?\nIn December 1940, having discovered in his previous records the dis-\nplacement effects described, I sought out B.S. with a view to further\nexperiments. Fortunately I found him reinstated in his Studio after being\ndischarged from the Army owing to ill-health. I thought it advisable to\ntell him something about the interesting effects we had discovered, but I\ndid not go into much detail as he made no objection to my trying some\nfresh experiments. He suggested that as he was a busy man the new\nexperiments should take place in his Studio. With the precautions I\nintended to adopt, there was no objection to this suggestion ;\nand my\nearlier records had shown that he obtained positive results when the\nexperiments were carried out away from his own premises.\nThe question I now had to decide was whether the experiments were\nto be again carried out with Zener cards inscribed with the five geo-\nmetrical symbols, or whether to substitute a different sort. The Zener\ncards had the obvious advantage of a clear-cut one in five chance of\nsuccess, but on the other hand I had, after having used them for five years,\nbecome sick of the very sight of the Zener symbols. I decided eventually\nto effect a compromise by substituting for the Zener cards others bearing\nfive pictures of different animals. I thus retained the great advantage of\na one in five chance of success. In war-time, however, it was not easy to\nobtain large quantities of cards with identical backs, such as I had used\npreviously, and I therefore modified the technique of the experiment so\nthat five cards only would be required instead of the 40 packs used in the\nearlier experiments.\nMy colleague, Mrs Goldney (K.M.G.), scarcely needs any introduction\nto members of this Society, of which she herself has been a member for\n16 years. She has travelled widely, has had great practical experience in\nmany branches of psychical research, and is expert in the detection of\nfraud. We have worked together on many occasions in the past. For\nmore than a year she collaborated with me in the investigation of \u201c Mar-\nion \u201d, the well-known vaudeville telepathist. Shq also organised the\nphysiological experiments carried out in connection with our joint work\nwith the medium Eileen Garrett and contributed a Paper on this subject\nto Proceedings.^ Owing to her medical experience she has been specially\nselected to take a leading part in investigations of physical mediums.\nSince February 1939 she has held the post of Assistant Regional Admini-\nstrator at W.V.S. Headquarters in London, covering Region 10 with its\n4 counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, Cumberland, and Westmorland.\nNo one who knows K.M.G. will question either her great ability or\nher integrity. It was to her that I turned again when seeking a collaborator\n^ Proc. xlv, 43 ff.\n\f34 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part '\nfor the present series of experiments, with the request that she would\nco-operate with me not only in the conduct of the experiments, but in this i\nReport on them. It is however at her own request that I record that :!\nshe has not the mathematical qualifications necessary for handling or i\ncriticising the statistical methods employed here, and to that extent she |\nhas played a subsidiary part in the work entailed. She asks me to say that\nj\nshe would prefer to be considered as my Assistant rather than as a partner, j\nbut I am happy to record that I do not share her views on this point.\nWith this much as my own account of the events leading to the present I\nexperiments, we will now resume our joint report.\nB.S., our Sensitive, is a photographer, an artist in his profession, with\nan arresting style and original conception of treatment, well-known for\nhis striking portrait studies. A man in perhaps the late thirties, he has a\nlarge Studio in the west end of London. He passed the early part of his\nlife in South Africa with which country his family has connections. Not\nuntil he was about 23 years of age did he become aware that he possessed\nunusual psychical gifts. So far as we can ascertain, he has no particular\ninterest in Spiritualism ;\nnor does he practise automatic writing. He\ntells us he has on various occasions applied his faculty of intuition to the\nforecasting of winners in a horse race with much profit to himself. None\nof his relatives appears to possess a similar paranormal faculty.\nB.S. claims to be able to sum up a person\u2019s character by a flash of\nintuition, and his thumb-nail sketches are often very amusing and accurate.\nB.S., unfortunately, does not enjoy good health, and suffers from\nduodenal trouble and the loss of one kidney.\nWhen we gave an account of our experiments with him at a Meeting\nof the Society on 2 October 1942, the President, Dr Thouless, asked us to\nconvey the best thanks of the Society to B.S. for the splendid way in\nwhich he has put both his time and his great gift at our service. It is no\nsmall thing that he has been willing over a period of more than two years\nto persevere in the monotonous task of guessing at the names of five\nanimals and to suffer our intrusions into his Studio. We extend to him\nour very heartiest thanks.\nWe have obtained highly significant results with three different Agents,\nnone of w\u2019hom was a friend of B.S. These we shall refer to as Miss R.E.,\nMrs G.A., and Mr J.Al. None of the Agents has received any remun-\neration for his or her assistance and neither has B.S.\nWe owe a special debt of gratitude to Miss R.E., who worked with us\nregularly for a whole year. R.E. had previously given valuable assistance\nwith the 1934-1939 experiments after these had been transferred to the\npsychological laboratory at University College, London. She also under-\ntook an immense amount of work in making various counts in connection\nwith the 1934-1939 experiments\u2014work which she carried out with\nscrupulous care. All observers who have watched her at work in the\npresent experiments testify to her reliability and accuracy. In addition\nto acting as Agent, R.E. assisted in the making of the duplicate records\nwhich were sent to Professor Broad in Cambridge at the conclusion of\neach day\u2019s work.\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 35\nOur thanks are also due to the other two Agents, Mrs G.A. and Mr\nJ.Al. Mr J.Al. in particular, though a busy man, made many journeys\nfrom South London in order to assist at the experiments.\nOur thanks are extended to the numerous persons who often travelled\nlong distances to witness and assist at the experiments. Their names will\nappear in the course of the Report. Our special thanks are due to Dr E.\nJ. Dingwall for his advice and help ;\nand to Miss Jephson, Mrs John-\nstone, Mrs Woollard, Mr Chibbett, Mr Medhurst, Mr Redmayne, Mr\nRichmond, and Mr Rozelaar, who carried out the complete re-check of\nall original and duplicate scoring sheets. Mr Gerhard Wassermann, B.Sc.,\na young mathematician, bn some occasions compiled lists of random\nnumbers for use in the experiments, as did also Mr C. U. Blascheck, of\nClare College, Cambridge.\nAnd finally we wish to record our appreciation of the interest\ntaken in the experiments by Dr Thouless, who has been ever ready to\nassist us with his statistical experience and knowledge of experimental\npsychology.\nREPORT ON EXPERIMENTS IN PRECOGNITIVE TELEPATHY\n1941\u20141943\nABSTRACT\nIn the present Report the authors describe experiments in card-cognition\ncarried out during the years 1941 -1943 with a Sensitive, Mr B.S., whose\nwork in 1936 with Zener cards had shown evidence of precognitive and post-\ncognitive effects.\nThe bulk of the experiments took place in 1941, mostly at weekly inter-\nvals; they were resumed, after a 4 months\u2019 gap, in 1942; and after August\n1942 three isolated experiments were carried out in the early months of 1943.\nAll experiments to date are included in this Report.\nThroughout the present series the Agent and Percipient were in separate\nrooms, and stringent precautions were taken to eliminate the possibilities\nof normal leakage, fraud, and collusion.\nThe material for transmission consisted of five animal pictures, but the\nexperiments were equally successful when, in place of the pictures, cards\nwere substituted inscribed with the initial letters of the animals\u2019 names or\nwith \u201c associated \u201d words.\nIt is shown that the precognitive and postcognitive effects obtained were\nalmost certainly of a telepathic (rather than clairvoyant) character.\u2019-\nB.S. scored highly significant results with three Agents. Superficial tests\nwith ten other Agents were negative. (Some of these were for a few calls\nonly.)\nSuccessful results were obtained using (i) the method of selecting the\ncard to be looked at by lists of random digits (1-5) prepared before the\nexperiment, and (2) the method of selecting the card to be looked at by\ndrawing coloured counters one by one by touch from a bag w'hile the\nexperiment was in progress.\nInteresting results were also obtained by the use of non-random lists of\ndigits.\nWith two of the three successful Agents it was found that, when the time\ninterval betw'een successive card presentations varied from 2-i to 3 3 seconds\n(the \u201cnormal\u201d rate), significant precognitive ( + 1) successes were scored;\n\u2019 See Glossary, p. 22.\n\f36 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nwhile with the third Agent both significant precognitive ( + i) and significant\npostcognitive (-1) hits were obtained. The direct hits on the whole\nseries show no significance.\nIt was also found that when the rate of calling was speeded up so that the\ninterval between successive calls was reduced to 1-5 seconds (the \u201c rapid\u201d\nrate), the ( + 1) cognitions disappeared and were replaced by (+2) pre-\ncognitive successes.\nWhen on the other hand the rate of calling was slowed down to an interval\nof five seconds between successive presentations (the \u201c slow \u201d rate), no\n\u201c beyond chance \u201d results of any kind were obtained.\nIn so-called \u201c clairvoyance \u201d experiments in which the Agent touched\nbut did not look at the card to be guessed, no significant results of any kind\nwere obtained, and this irrespective of whether B.S. knew or did not know\nwhether the experiment was one of \u201c clairvoyance \u201d or of \u201c telepathy \u201d\n(in which the Agent looked at the cards).\nThe effects of \u201c sandwiching \u201d ^ noted during the work of 1936 are fully\nconfirmed in the present series, and there is strong evidence of a similar\neffect in connection with ( \u00b12) guesses at the \u201c rapid \u201d rate of calling.\nB.S.\u2019s impressions or pre-judgments as to whether his guessing was\nsuccessful or not appeared to bear no relation to the actual results obtained.\nScoring w'as not equally successful on each of the five animal picture\ncards. Most success was scored with the Elephant and least with the Lion.\nA number of persons witnessed the successful scoring and all testified\nto the fraud-proof character of the methods employed.\nStatistically the precognitive ( + 1) results on the whole seides are highly\nsignificant. Including every single experiment between the dates 24.1.41\nand 6.1.43 3t which an Agent was present, we have a total of 11,378 ( + 1)\nprecognitive trials.^ This total includes tests in both \u201c telepathy \u201d and\n\u201c clairvoyance \u201d and tests at all rates of calling and with all Agents;\ni.e., we include those conditions which consistently led to negative results\nas well as conditions which conduced to success. The number of ( + 1)\nsuccesses on this grand total is 2,890 compared with an expectation of\n2,308- 17 by Stevens\u2019 method.^ We have thus an excess of ( + i) hits amount-\ning to 581-83 and equivalent to 13-6 Standard Deviations, with odds of more\nthan 10^^ to I against chance.\nPART ONE*\nACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPERIMENT\nWITH DESCRIPTION OF THE TECFINIQUES EMPLOYED\nAND EVALUATION OF TFIE RESULTS\nN.B.\u2014Owing to her war work, which entailed travelling to the north of\nEngland, K.M.G. was unable to be present at a few of the experiments.\nS.G.S. attended every experiment except one held on 16 January 1942 when,\nhowever, K.M.G. was present.

No experiment held in the presence of either S.G.S.\nor K.M.G. at any time has been omitted. Two preliminary experiments\ncarried out by S.G.S. on first contacting B.S. are recorded in Appendix H.\nTypes of Experiment. There were two main types of experiment.\nIn the first the card to be looked at by the Agent was chosen by means of\na list of random numbers (i to 5) prepared beforehand by S.G.S., or in a\nfew cases by another person. This type of experiment will be referred to\nas a PRN (Prepared Random Numbers) experiment. In the second type\nof experiment, the card to be looked at was chosen by one of the experi-\nmenters selecting by touch a counter from a bag or bowl which contained\nequal numbers of counters in five different colours. This will be called a\nCounters experiment.\nWe shall begin with a description of the PRN experiments. The\ntechnique which we shall describe was for all practical purposes standard-\nised by 7 March 1941 in the seventh sitting of the series. A screen was in\nuse on the card-table from Sitting i on 24 January 1941, but the additional\nprecaution of enclosing and screening the five cards inside a box was\nadopted on and after 7 March 1941. The introduction of a second experi-\nmenter whose function was to control B.S., the Percipient, first took place\non 7 February 1941 at Sitting No. 3.\nPersonnel. In general four persons take part in the experiments.\nThey are\n(1) The Percipient (B.S.) referred to as - - - - (P)\n(2) The Agent referred to a^ - - - - - - (A)\n(3) The Experimenter controlling Agent referred to as - - (EA)\n(4) The Experimenter controlling Percipient referred to as - (EP)\nIn addition a fifth person is present on most occasions,\nwho is called the Observer ----- (O)\nFrom January 1941 till June 1941 the role of (EA) was assumed by\nS.G.S., and that of (EP) by K.M.G. and various other persons. On and\nafter 14 August 1941, K.M.G. usually played the part of (EA) while\nS.G.S. acted as (EP). This change-over gave to each experimenter\nexperience of the different roles. (See Part 2, List of Scores, for personnel\nat each experiment.)\nThe Studio and Ante-Room.^ Our experiments are conducted in\nB.S.\u2019s Studio. This is below the level of the street and none of the rooms\nhas any windows. The rooms consist in the main of a large Studio and an\nante-room. There are, in addition, some small private apartments which\nare reached from the ante-room through a curtained archway and from\nthe Studio through the door 03.'^ The ordinary entrance to the Studio\nfrom the ante-room is by door D2. The folding entrance-doors, Di,\nlead to a short passage from which stairs ascend to the outer door of\nthe building which opens on the street. The shaded area in Plan between\nante-room and Studio is intra-mural and hollow, and the walls are not\nsolid but built-up with plywood, plaster-covered, as are also the doors.\nThe screened-off portion shown in the right hand corner of the Studio is\na temporary plywood platform (for photographic purposes).\n1\nCf. Plate I. 2 sgg piatg j\n\f38 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part ,\nLf\nCard Table and Cards.^ The card table (size 24 in. square and 25 in. L|\nhigh) is situated in the Studio at a distance of about 9 feet from the i\nL|\ndividing wall between Studio and ante-room. It is lighted by a powerful Li\nphotographer\u2019s lamp, L. Standing on this card table is a screen (size ; |a\n31 in. wide by 26 in. high) with a square aperture (3 inches square) in its\np\ncentre. The Agent is seated on that side of the screen remote from the \u00a7\nante-room and the experimenter (EA) sits or stands on the side nearest d\nto the ante-room. The plane of the screen is about parallel to that of the\ndividing wall. Resting on the table on the Agent\u2019s side of the screen is a\np\nrectangular box with its open face towards the Agent.^ Inside this, on j\nthe floor of the box and entirely screened by it, are five cards with backs\nlike those of playing cards and bearing on their faces pictures of the five j\nanimals\nLion (L) I\nElephant (E)\nZebra (Z)\nGiraffe (G)\nPelican (P)\nThe pictures are in appropriate colours. On the table in front of (EA)\nare five cards on which are printed in large bold type the numbers\nL2, 3,4, 5.\nPosition of Percipient. The Percipient, B.S., sits in the ante-room j\nwhile he is guessing the cards, in one of the following positions. For the\nfirst 18 sittings, between 24 January 1941 and 13 June 1941, he sat on\none of the chairs (C) with the experimenter (EP) beside him in front of\nthe fireplace. On and after 14 August 1941 and until 21 December 1941,\nB.S. and (EP) sat at a small table nearly towards the far end of the ante-\nroom. On and after 15 May 1942 B.S. and (EP) sat at a desk (V).^\nScoring Sheets.^ S.G.S. brings to each sitting scoring sheets,\nfoolscap size, each designed to accommodate two columns. For each\ncolumn there are two divisions : the one on the left headed G (for\nGuesses) and the one on the right headed A (for Actual cards). The two\ndivisions are divided into 25 rectangular cells, and for convenience in\nkeeping count these cells are numbered at intervals of five. The left hand\ncolumn with its two divisions of 25 cells is referred to as the {a) column\nand the right hand one with its two divisions of 25 cells as the {b) column.\nThus sheet 4(a) means the left-hand column (with its two divisions of\n25 cells) on the fourth sheet ;\nsheet ^{b), the right-hand column (with its\ntwo divisions of 25 cells) on the fourth sheet.\nS.G.S., before coming to the sitting, fills in the A divisions on all the\nsheets to be used by (EA) with a random sequence of the digits i, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nIn general S.G.S. prepares these lists from the last digits of the seven-\nfigure logarithms of numbers selected at intervals of 100 from Chambers\u2019\nTables.^ In some cases, however, Tippets\u2019 random numbers were used.\nThese lists are compiled by S.G.S. at his lodgings in Cambridge with no-one\n1 See Plate III. See Plate IV. = See Plate I.\n^ See Plate II. \u2018 See Proc. xlvi, 1^6.\n\f167] Experiments in Precogmtive Telepathy 39\npresent but himself, and they are kept under lock and key until the day\nof the sitting. They are then brought to London in a suit-case which is\nnever out of S.G.S.\u2019s sight till the experiment is about to start. At the\nlast moment S.G.S. takes the suit-case into the Studio, extracts the com-\npiled lists, and hands them to (EA). (P), therefore, who never enters the\nStudio till the experiments are finished, has no opportunity of seeing\nthese sheets at any time.\nS.G.S. also hands (P) some empty scoring sheets similar to those in the\npossession of (EA) and both (EA) and (P) number the first sheet they are\nabout to use \u201c i \u201d. (P) records his guesses in the G divisions on each sheet.\nThe lists of random numbers are made out in blue-black ink, but (P)\nfinds it more convenient to use a pencil in recording his guesses.\n(P) and (EP) now seat themselves in the ante-room. The door D3 is\nkept closed.^ In the earlier experiments, till sitting No. 10, the door Da\nwas completely closed also. After sitting No. 9 however, it was left an\ninch or two ajar in order to facilitate hearing. From where he sits (P)\nis quite unable to see either (EA) or the screen. Still less is he able to\nsee the box on the far side of the screen or the Agent (A). The purpose\nof the box is to screen the five cards from the view of any person who\nmight by hypothesis be concealed in the Studio or who might be gazing\ndowm into the Studio through some hypothetical hole in the ceiling. In\nfact, with the cards inside the box, no-one could see them unless he were\nstanding directly behind (A), in which case his presence would be apparent\nat once.\nThe five cards are now shuffled by either the Agent (A) or the observer\n(O), if an observer is present. Throughout the experiments we have\nadopted as a cardinal principle the rule that neither (EA) nor (EP) shall\nshuffle the five cards nor witness the shuffling. Hence, since (EA) does\nnot know the order of the cards inside the box he can give nothing away\nto (P) by any inflections of the voice when he calls (see ff)\n;\nand since (EP)\nis also unaware of the order, he cannot help (P) in any way when the latter\nrecords his guesses. If (EA) looks through the square aperture in the\nscreen, he can see only (A) and the top of the box.\nThe Call. The experiment begins with (A) and sometimes (O)\nshuffling the cards out of sight of (EA) and laying them face downwards\nin a row on the floor of the box. (EA) then shouts \u201c Are you ready?\n\u201d\nand on receiving the answer \u201c Yes \u201d from (EP) in the ante-room, lifts to\nthe aperture in the screen the printed card bearing the number which\ncomes first in the (a) column of the first sheet. He pauses for the merest\nfraction of a second and calls \u201c One \u201d. On seeing, say, the number\n4 at the aperture, (A) lifts up slightly the fourth card from left to right\nand having noted the picture on its face lets the card fall back face down-\nwards on the floor of the box, without of course disturbing the order of\nthe five cards. On hearing the word \u201c One \u201d, (P) writes down in the first\ncell of the G division of the (a) column of his first scoring sheet the initial\nletter of one of the animals : L, E, Z, G, or P. The momentary pause\nby the experimenter (EA) is to ensure that (A) has lifted the card at the\ninstant (P) hears the call. (EP) verifies that (P) synchronises his recording\n^ See Plate I.\n\f40 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part |J]1\nwith (EA)\u2019s calls. While the guessing is in progress (A) remains absol-|\nutely silent. To summarise :\n(A) or (O), the only persons who know the\norder of the cards, never speak at all ;\n(EA), the only person who speaks,\ndoes not know the order of the cards. The possibility of a code being\nconveyed by the voice is therefore precluded.\nUntil sitting No. 9 (21 March 1941), (P) used to shout \u201c Right\n\u201d\nimmediately he had recorded his guess ;\nbut after a time this became un-\nnecessary since (P) got into the habit of writing down his guess at the\ninstant he heard (EA)\u2019s call or at an interval scarcely ever exceeding -4 of\na second after the call (timed by S.G.S. with a stop-watch).\n(EA) now exhibits the next random number at the aperture and calls\n\u201c Two \u201d after a fraction of a second\u2019s pause. On seeing the number card\nat the aperture, (A) lifts the appropriate animal card and lets it fall back\nin its place. (P) on hearing \u201c Two \u201d immediately records his guess in the\nsecond cell of his G division, and so the guessing continues. (EA) calls\nthe numbers 2, 3, 4, up to 25 at a rhythmical rate, keeping the intervals\nas constant as possible.^ At guess number one (EA) starts a stop-clock\nwhich is stopped at guess number twenty-five. At the end of the (a)\nor left hand column of 25 guesses, there is a pause of at least six or seven\nseconds, after which (EA) shouts \u201c Next column \u201d, and on hearing\n(EP)\u2019s \u201c Right \u201d begins again with \u201c One \u201d, \u201c two \u201d, \u201c three \u201d, etc. until\nthe right hand or (b) column of the sheet is run through.\nTaking Down the Code. When the sheet of 50 calls is completed,\nthere is a break of perhaps a couple of minutes for \u201c taking down the\ncode \u201d. (EA) goes round to the other side of the screen, and, watched by\n(O), turns over the five cards without disturbing their order. He records\nthe code at the bottom of the scoring sheet thus :\nIta\nItcc\nW\niftfsi\n\u2122t\nare\n||to:\nta'\njas\n;as\nitl\n0(\nal\ne:\nri\nn\nE L G P Z t\n12345 \"\nr\nThis, say, is the order of the five cards as seen and lifted by the Agent from j\nleft to right. (P) in the meantime remains with (EP) in the ante-room.\nBefore commencing their second sheet (which both (EA) and (P) now ,\nnumber \u201c 2 \u201d), the five cards are re-shuffied by (A) or (O) out of sight\nj\nof both (EA) and (EP), and this is done each time before starting on a new ,\nsheet.\nDecoding and Checking-Up. The decoding and counting of success-\nful hits is carried out by (EA), (EP), and (O), with (A) looking on.\n(EA) first brings the random number sheets into the ante-room (or\n(P)\u2019s sheets into the Studio) and lays sheet No. i on a table by the side of\n(P)\u2019s \u201c guess \u201d sheet No. i. One of the experimenters reads aloud (P)\u2019s\nguesses and as he does so (O) or the other experimenter copies down in the\nappropriate cell of (EA)\u2019s G column the code-number for each of (P)\u2019s\nletters, which he obtains by referring to the code at the bottom of (EA)\u2019s\nsheet. As this number is entered, either (O) or the other experimenter\n^ In the earliest experiments the word \u201c next \u201d was called instead of the serial\nnumber (see p. 44).\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 41\n;hecks it, while (A) checks the letter read out by the first experimenter.\n\"Thus each member of the active pair is checked by a looker-on. All\ndecoded numbers are entered in ink.\nWhen a column of 25 guesses is filled in on (EA)\u2019s sheet, the numbers\naf successes are counted in the order\n! {a) direct hits\n{b) precognitive ( + i) hits\n^\n(c) postcognitive (\n- i )\nhits\n^\nwith, as a rule, at least three people checking the counts. These numbers\nI\nare then entered in ink at the top of (EA)\u2019s sheet thus :\n(\n+ 1) \/\n(o)\n\/\n(-1)\n6\/4\/3\nI\nTicks are entered opposite the direct hits.\nI\nThe checking-up is usually done immediately the experiments are\ncompleted, though in some of the earlier sittings it was done at the end of\n'\neach sheet, and later on at the end of three sheets. The two experimenters\nas well as (O) append their signatures at the bottom of each scoring sheet.\nIn the earlier sittings B.S. often watched the decoding and checking-up\nas a passive observer, but after June 1941 he w'as seldom present at the\n, checking-up, having left the Studio. (The exact procedure on each\n* occasion is noted in Part III : The Chronicle). He would usually return\nafter we had finished, but as a rule he was (after June 1941) not told his\nexact scores. After a successful sitting we would remark to him \u201c The\nresults were first-rate today \u201d or something of that sort. If the results\nwere poor we would tell him \u201c Not so good today \u201d. He was never much\ndepressed by poor scores, but neither was he unduly elated by good scores.\nHis general attitude was one of detachment and often he seemed quite\nindifferent as to the outcome of his performance. Certainly there was\nnone of that emotional stress which some experimenters have described\n1 as existing in their Subjects.\nIn connection with the above method of decoding and checking-up, it\nmust be understood that we have made many variations and changes of\n\u2019 personnel in order to discount the criticism that the same two persons\nplaying the same roles might be in collusion to falsify the records. All the\nindependent observers were satisfied that the task of checking-up was\nperformed in a straightforward manner, and many have testified to this\n^ in writing. The experimenters frequently asked the Observer if he would\n(\nlike to re-check independently some of the higher scores. Professor H.\nHabberley Price, for instance, himself selected three columns of high\nscores and re-checked independently both the decoding and the counting\nof hits. No errors were found.\nWe may cite one or two examples of variation :\n(i) On 21 December 1941 Mr C. A. Mace stood between K.M.G. and\nJ: S.G.S. so that he could check both the letter read out by S.G.S. and the\nI\ncorrectness of the number entered (in ink) by K.M.G. who did the\ndecoding. He reported no errors and highly significant (\n+ i) scores were\nrecorded. (See List of Scores, p. 114 and The Chronicle.)\n\f42 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\n(2) On 5 December 1941, Sir Ernest Bennett read aloud B.S.\u2019s guesses\nwhile K.M.G. decoded and entered the numbers (in ink) with S.G.S.\nlooking on and checking her. R.E. also watching. Results highly signi-\nficant. (See List of Scores, p. 113 and The Chronicle.)\n(3) On 24 October 1941, Dr C.E.M. Joad decoded the first three\nj\nsheets entirely alone. The numbers were entered (in ink) by Mrs Wool-\nlard, and Joad was checked by S.G.S. while R.E. checked Mrs Woollard.\nAt the end of Sheet 3, Joad had to leave for a lecture and the remaining\nsheets were decoded by Mrs Woollard with R.E. and S.G.S. checking\nher. Scores significant. (See p. 109 and The Chronicle.)\n(4) At the four sittings on 8, 15, and 22 May 1942, and 8 April 1943, ^\nMr R. G. Medhurst, B.Sc., at the request of S.G.S., carried out entirely\nalone the whole of the decoding, entering (in ink) and counting of scores.\nThis was confirmed by Medhurst in writing. Scores highly significant\non these occasions. (See List of Scores, pp. 117, 118, 119, 125 ;\nand The\nChronicle.)\nAt the end of the decoding and the counting of hits, the totals for\neach of the classes ( + 1), (o), and (-1), and the corresponding chance\nexpectations, are reckoned by S.G.S. and re-checked independently by -\nK.M.G. with (O) usually looking on. The Standard Deviation and ,\nCritical Ratios are approximately estimated before the experimenters\nleave the premises.\nDuplicate Records. The final task consists of making duplicates in I\nink of all the completed scoring sheets. This work is usually shared be- f\ntween K.M.G., S.G.S. and R.E. After being signed by both experi- |\nmenters, the duplicates are, in full view of all present, placed in an ;\nenvelope that is stamped and addressed to Professor C. D. Broad, Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge. The envelope is posted in the presence of not less than [;\nthree people in the post-box in the street a few yards from B.S.\u2019s Studio. f\nBy this time the Observer, if any, has usually departed. K.M.G. and i\nS.G.S. now adjourn to a restaurant where scores are re-checked, results j\ndiscussed, and plans made for future experiments.\nS.G.S. takes the record sheets back with him to Cambridge or to his\nhome in Essex as the case may be, and there proceeds to make a complete ^\nre-check of both the decoding and counts of successes, and also counts all\n(+2) (precognitive) and all (-2) (postcognitive) hits and records the |\ntotals for each column. No error in the whole period was ever discovered\nj\nin the decoding, but on one occasion it was found that a single pre- i\ncognitive (\n+ 1) hit had been overlooked in a count. This is testimony\nto the accuracy of those concerned in the decoding and counting.^\nThe Statistical Method. The statistical methods employed in the\n|\nstraightforward evaluation of the results of experiments in card-cognition i\nare now so well established, and have been the subject of such thorough |\ndiscussion since the year 1937, that no-one, we think, will any longer\nquestion their validity. The statistical battle was fought and won by the |\nDuke University experimenters and since 1938 no further opposition has\nbeen encountered on this score.\n' For results of independent re-check of all scoring sheets, see pp. 86-87. l|\n\f43\ni6y] Experiments in Precogniiive Telepathy\nIn the present investigation the results obtained are so manifestly above\nchance expectation that any critic would be simply wasting his time if he\nventured to attack them on statistical grounds. The use of prepared lists\nof random digits (1-5) removes the last objection based on the suppo-\nsition that the shuffling of packs of cards may not result in ideal random\ndistributions. It also renders ineffective those objections to the use of the\nbinomial formulae which were urged so persistently and (from a practical\nstandpoint) with such lack of success against the work of Rhine.\nThe reader who desires to know something of the history of these\nstatistical controversies will find a summary of them in Extra Sensory\nPerception After Sixty Years (New York, Henry Holt & Co. 1940). In a\nseries of admirable appendices to the same book is given a collection of\nstatistical formulae which are of use in card-cognition tests. The\nformulae referred to as \u201c Stevens \u201d formulae were first established by\nW. L. Stevens in 1938 and his Paper appeared in the Annals of Eugenics,\nVol. VHI, Part HI, pp. 208-44.\nMethods of Evaluation.^ Throughout this investigation we have\nmade no attempts to count beyond ( \u00b1 2) displacements. The five scores\n(\n- i), (o), ( + i), ( -2), ( -1-2) only are considered. As our (PRN) distri-\nbution of card presentations is a random series, the expectations on these\nfive scores are theoretically independent of each other. Since there seems\nto be some misapprehension on this point, we shall illustrate the\nindependence of (\n+ i) and (\n\u2014 i) scores by taking an extreme case.\nEach column of 25 calls provides 24 (\n+ 1) trials and 24 (-1) trials.\nThe expected number of ( + i) hits is clearly (on an average) i of 24 = 4'8\nand there is the same expectation of ( - i) hits. Let us suppose that by\nan extraordinary fluke a Percipient got all the 24 (\n+ 1) (precognitive)\nguesses right. Then, with the exception of a possible success on the last\nor twenty-fifth presentation, his only (\n- i) (postcognitive) successes would\narise from multiply-determined presentations of the form\nL L\nE or L etc. (cf. p. 31)\nL L\nand on these and similar types he would score certain hits. But in a\nrandom distribution there would be a mean expectation of i x 23 such\ntypes. Hence his total mean expectation for (\n\u2014 i) successes would be\ni+ix 23=4'8\n(since his expectation on the last presentation would be ^). Thus his high\n(\n+ 1) score has not affected his (\n- i) expectation.\nWe should point out that throughout this report the probability corre-\nsponding to a deviation X from mean chance expectation is understood\nto be the probability of a deviation lying outside the range - X to 4- X.\nIn other words, we estimate our probability on the assumption that we\nare just as interested in negative deviations as in positive deviations.\n(I) In a series of N trials the mean expectation of successes is N\/5\nand the standard error is These formulae of course apply when\nwe are dealing with any of the five types (o) ( \u00b1 i) ( \u00b1 2).\n1\nCf. Pioc. xlvi, pp. 168-9.\n\f44 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\n(II) The expectation and variance can be found for each set of, say,\n24 (\n+ i) trials by Stevens\u2019 method and the results summed for all setsd\nIt was shown in the 1934-1939 experiments that the variances obtained by\nStevens\u2019 method are almost without exception very slightly less than those\ngiven by the formula This was confirmed by scpring a large\nbatch of the present results by both methods (I) and (II). We are there-\nfore on the safe side if we use as the theoretical Standard Error\ninstead of that given by Stevens\u2019 formula which is tedious to evaluate.\nThe expectations have been found from Stevens\u2019 formula.\n(III) An empirical \u201c cross-check \u201d for each sheet in the case of the\n(\n+ i) scores was made by scoring column (a)G against column (b)A and\ncolumn (b)G against column (a)A. That is to say, the \u201c guesses \u201d (G)\ndivision of the left hand half of the sheet was scored against the \u201c actual\ncard \u201d (A) division of the right hand half, and vice versa.\nThe \u201c Normal \u201d Rate of Guessing. A fairly rapid speed of guessing\nseems essential if B.S. is to obtain significant results, and in this respect\nhe resembles G.N.M.Tyrrell\u2019s Sensitive ^ and differs from many of the\nSensitives studied by Dr Rhine.\nIf the interval between successive card presentations is increased beyond\n4 seconds, B.S. grows unhappy, restive, and irritable. At an interval of as\nmuch as 5 seconds, he does not seem to be able to score any kind of success.\nWe made no systematic attempts at timing the guessing till 21 March 1941,\nas we did not at first realise the effects the varying rates had upon the\nresults.\nAs already recorded, in the experiments previous to sitting 9 (21 March\n^94^ )> (EA) on showing each number at the aperture in the screen called\n\u201c Next \u201d, and immediately he had recorded his guess B.S. shouted\n\u201c Right \u201d. This was a signal for (EA) to exhibit the next number at the\naperture. Until 21 March 1941, therefore, the rate of calling was deter-\nmined by B.S. himself. He adapted himself to a rate that was fairly\nquick but comfortable for both himself and the experimenters. In order\nto reassure us that he was keeping in step with (EA) he would call out at\nthe end of every 5 guesses \u201c Five \u201d, \u201d Ten \u201d, \u201c Fifteen \u201d, \u201c Twenty \u201d,\n\u201c Twentyfive \u201d. But on and after 21 March 1941 (P) dispensed with\ncalling \u201c Right \u201d after each guess and (EA) no longer shouted \u201c Next \u201d\nbut called out instead the serial numbers \u201c One \u201d, \u201c two \u201d, \u201c three \u201d...\n\u201c twentyfour \u201d, \u201c twentyfive \u201d, to facilitate and ensure the synchronisation\nof (P)\u2019s recording with (EA)\u2019s calling.\nObviously synchronisation is of primary importance for any evaluation of\nthe results. It was noted by several Observers who acted as (EP) in the\nearlier experiments, that on occasion B.S. wrote down his eighteenth guess,\nsay, the merest fraction of a second before (EA) called \u201c eighteen \u201d. When\nwe discovered this tendency, we were constantly warning him against it\nand by 16 May 1941 he was writing down his guesses almost simul-\ntaneously with or about -4 of a second after the call from (EA). During\nthe six months that S.G.S. acted as (EP), he frequently timed the intervals\nbetween (EA)\u2019s calls and (P)\u2019s recording of his guess ;\nand during the\n^\nCf. Proc. xlvi, pp. 168-9.\n^ See Proc. vol. xliv, Part 147.\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 45\nwhole of this period S.G.S. noted that on no occasion did (P) record his\nguess before (EA)\u2019s call. It was as a rule recorded at about -2 to -4 seconds\nafter the call.\nWe had hoped to use a metronome to keep the intervals between\nsuccessive calls constant, but (P) said it was quite impossible for him to\nwork with \u201c that confounded thing ticking away in the other room \u201d.\nSo we had to abandon this plan. Nor, in fact, would it be an easy thing\nfor (EA) to regulate with completely accurate timing to the split second,\nand at the required rate, the difficult task of reading off accurately the\nlist of figures, quickly picking up the correct card, and presenting it neatly\nat the small aperture in the screen. This is a task which requires consider-\nable dexterity and concentration at the best!\nB.S.\u2019s comfortable rate of guessing varies between limits of about 50\nseconds and 80 seconds for a column of 25 calls, and we entitle it the\n\u201c Normal Rate \u201d. Throughout a single sitting it remains fairly constant\nbut varies somewhat with the person who plays the part of (EA). Of 255\ncolumns of 25 calls timed at \u201c normal rate \u201d, the average time for 25 calls\nis 62-33 seconds, which corresponds to an average inten^al of 2-60 seconds\nbetween successive calls. The standard error for a column is 11-38\nseconds (observ^ed value).\nAn inspection of Table XXXV Appendix (F), shows that it is safe to\nconclude that significant successes on ( + i\n)\nguesses have been obtained\nat practically all rates between 50 and 80 seconds for a column of 25 calls.\nWe shall later discuss the effects of more rapid calling.\nExplanation of Table I (p. 46). This Table records all the pre-\ncognitive ( + 1) guesses and hits made by B.S. over the total period when\nworking with Prepared Random Numbers at the \u201c normal rate \u201d in con-\njunction with our first Agent, R.E. It will be seen that the cumulative\nresults over eleven months amount to over 13 times the Standard Devia-\ntion. The odds against such a result being due to chance are, on a con-\nservative estimate, indicated by a figure consisting of 10 with 35 noughts\nadded, to one.\nAll the experiments recorded in Table I are \u201c telepathy \u201d experiments,\nbut on some occasions sheets of \u201c clairvoyance \u201d experiments were inter-\nspersed among, or regularly alternated with the telepathic tests (see\np. 49 ff). Except on the dates 14 and 25 August 1941, the material for\ntelepathic transmission consisted of pictures of the five animals. On the\ndates mentioned, experiments with the animal pictures were alternated\nwith experiments in which cards inscribed with the associated words\nTrunk, Mane, Beak, Stripes, and Neck were substituted for the corre-\nsponding animal pictures (see pp. 71-72). These latter experiments are of\ncourse included in Table I, but all \u201c clairvoyance \u201d experiments are\nexcluded and evaluated separately (Tables II, III, IV and V, pp. 49-51).\nOn 24 September 1941 and 14 November 1941 the sheets for experi-\nments at \u201c normal \u201d speed were alternated with sheets for experiments\nin which the interv'al between successive card presentations was increased\nto 5 seconds. These \u201c Slow Rate \u201d experiments are of course not included\nin Table I, which is confined to experiments at \u201c Normal Rate \u201d. Table X\ngives the results for all calls at \u201c Slow Rate \u201d (see p. 54).\n\f46 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nThe second column (Average Interval) gives the average interval in\nseconds between successive card presentations. The third column gives\nthe total numbers of ( + i) trials on each date. It will be seen that these\nnumbers are multiples of 24 except on 23.5. 1941 when the total is 189\ninstead of 192, owing to the fact that Dr Wiesner, acting as (EP), reported\nthat B.S. missed the last four calls in one column. Columns four and five\ngive, respectively, the actual number of ( + i) hits scored on each date and\nthe expected number (E) computed by Stevens\u2019 method.

(A) It will be noted that the total expectation\nof (\n+ 1) precognitive hits as evaluated by Stevens\u2019 method (775-82), is\nsomewhat higher than N\/5 = 3789\/5 = 757-8. The reason for this is not\nfar to seek. Since there is a high degree of paranormal cognition, it is\nseen that when a column contains an excess of presentations of some partic-\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy \\~]\nular symbol, (P) tends to guess that particular symbol more times than if\nit were not present in excess. This is confirmed by some later experi-\nments. Hence in Stevens\u2019 formula (E= T a,g,\/N), if a high value of a,\nr \u2014 1\nis associated with a high value of g,. and vice versa, the expectation is\nincreased as a general rule. Thus in our experiments the use of Stexens\nformula instead of N\/5 is on the safe side. The difference between the\ntwo expectations is very small where there is no extra sensory cognition.\n(B) The totals of Table I give\n( + 1) Trials ( + i)Hits (E) Dev. St. Dev. x\n3789 iioi 775'82 325 \u2019i8 24-62 132\nIt follows that the chance of getting a ( ^ )\ndeviation of this magnitude\nor greater is certainly less than lo-^^. Since, however, our score was\nchosen as the best out of five scores (\ni2)(o) (\nTi), the chance of getting at\nleast one of the five scores with a deviation as large as the above will\n(approximately) be less than 5 x The factor 5 of course scarcely\naffects the order of the result. The probabilities which correspond to\nthe values of x given under different dates in Table I should of course all\nbe multiplied by 5.\n(C) As the total scores on (\u00b12) and (o) and (-1) are not significant,\nwe have not evaluated their expectations by Stevens\u2019 method. These\ntotals are given in Table ia below.\n(D) The cross-check total under (CC + i) is in close agreement with\nexpectation.\nTABLE Ia (Appendix to Table I)\n(PRN) (Tel.)

At the close of the experiments on\nthis date, S.G.S. asked B.S. to keep reminding himself during the follow-\ning week that at the next sitting on 31 January he was going to score\ndirect hits and not precognitive hits. Each day during the week^ S.G.S.\nkept repeating aloud \u201c B.S. will score direct hits next Friday . The\nexperiment was a striking success. On 31 January B.S. scored an almost\n\f48 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nsignificant negative deviation on ( + i\n)\nguesses but on the actual card\nitself he won 76 hits in 200 trials : an excess of +36 above chance ex-\npectation, and equivalent to 6-36 times the Standard Deviation with\nP<io\u201c* (For the actual scores see Part II, List of Scores, p. 89, Sitting\nNo. 2).\nAt the end of the experiment on 31 January, S.G.S. asked B.S. to con-\ncentrate during the following week on the idea of scoring ( + 1) precog-\nnitive successes. S.G.S. during the week preceding the next experiment\nagain repeated aloud several times a day \u201c B.S. will score precognitive\nhits next week \u201d. The results were disappointing, but this may have\nbeen due to the presence of K.M.G. and Mr H. Chibbett, both of whom\nB.S. was meeting for the first time. It has been noted by Rhine, Tyrrell,\nand others, that the effect of introducing a new personality on the scene\nis sometimes a temporary lowering of the score. On 150 \u201c direct \u201d trials\nB.S. scored 43 hits, which is an excess of + 13 above expectation and equi-\nvalent to 2-65 times the Standard Deviation ;\nwhile on 144 ( + 1) trials he\nwon 39 (\n+ 1) hits, equivalent (on Stevens\u2019 scoring) to 2-18 times the\nStandard Deviation. The chance of getting at least two of the five scores\n(o), ( \u00b11), ( \u00b12), with a deviation as high as 2-18 Standard Deviations is\napproximately 10 x (-0293)2 = o-oo86, which corresponds to odds of the\norder 100 : i. But contrary to the suggestion given, the \u201c direct \u201d score\nis a little higher than the ( + i) score (see p. 90, Sitting No. 3).\nAfter this we did not continue with the method of suggestion described\nabove. During the succeeding weeks, in which there was an influx of\nfresh visitors, the interest of everyone became centred on the precognitive\nscores. We talked to B.S. only of \u201c precognition \u201d. All this may have\nhad the effect of directing his faculty into the precognitive channel from\nwhich it scarcely ever strayed for a whole year.\nAs certain people seem afraid of experiments in which the odds against\nchance are clear and decisive, and apparently prefer results of dubious\nsignificance, a few words may not be out of place on the question of high\nscores. Odds of millions to one against chance are the inevitable conse-\nquence of the consistent operation of a real psi faculty. Odds of only\nseventy or a hundred to one soon give rise, if repeated for a few weeks, to\nodds of astronomical magnitude : since probabilities are combined by the\nlaw of multiplication and not of addition. ConsisteJicy is the real test. Are\npositive results obtained week after week under first-class experimental\nconditions and in the presence of intelligent observers.? If so, it is a proof\nthat we are investigating a real faculty and not dealing with a few vagaries\nof chance-coincidence.\nIf, say, an experimenter makes his Subject do a thousand guesses and\nobtains a positive deviation from chance expectation of only 2-8 times the\nStandard Deviation, and then goes on to put the Subject through another\nten thousand trials with only chance results\u2014it is open to the experimenter\nto claim that the Sensitive showed extra sensory cognition for the first\nthousand trials but that the faculty then petered out. It is however\nequally open to another to maintain, with a much greater show of reason,\nthat there never was any faculty in operation and that all that happened\nwas that the Subject had an initial run of luck. But if we, in these experi-\nments with our Sensitive, go on getting (as we do) odds of hundreds or\n\f49\n167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy\nthousands to one time after time over a period of two years, and if, more-\nover, we find (as we do) that when the experimental conditions are varied\nin the same fashion the results exhibit consistent changes in character\nthen we are in a strong position which is proof against the theory of mere\nflukes of chance.\n\u201cClairvoyance\u201d Experiments. Our first variation with the (PRN)\nmethod was to introduce, unknown to B.S., sheets of 50 calls during which\nthe Agent did not know the order of the five cards in the box but merely\ntouched their backs at each call without turning them up. A couple of\nsheets of these \u201c clairvoyance \u201d tests were interspersed each week more or\nless randomly among the ordinary \u201c telepathy \u201d tests. Before commenc-\ning on a \u201c clairvoyance \u201d sheet, the Agent, R.E., w'ould shuffle the five\ncards with her eyes shut and lay them on the floor of the box without\nhaving seen their faces. On a good many occasions the five cards were\nshuffled by an Observer (O) out of sight of the Agent or of anyone else\nin the room.^ When (EA) showed the random number card at the aperture\nin the screen, the Agent, R.E., touched the corresponding card without\nlifting it to look at it. But as there was no other difference in procedure,\nB.S. was kept in ignorance that any variation had been introduced.\nConsidered as an experiment in Pure Clairvoyance the test was far from\nsatisfactory. It could, for instance, have been suggested that the Agent\nmight succeed in recognising the five cards by noting specks etc. on their\nbacks (though probably the light inside the box was not good enough to\nmake this possible.) Had (P) obtained any significant degree of success\nin this admittedly defective test, we should have gone on to perfect it and\nseal the cards up in opaque envelopes etc. But these refinements proved\nunnecessary since the \u201c clairvoyance \u201d experiments invariably failed.\nBetween 24 January 1941 and 28 February 1941, ten sheets of \u201c clair-\nvoyance \u201d experiments were completed, and the results\u2014completely\nnegative on all five scores\u2014are given in Table II.\nTABLE II\n(PRN) (Clairvoyance) (First Series) (Normal Rate)\n(Results ; completely negative)\n\u2014 2 \u20142 \u2014I \u2014I o o +i +iE( + i) CC +2 +2\nDate Trials Hits Trials Hits Trials Hits Trials Hits Stevens ( + i) Trials Hits\n24. 1.41 92 22 96 20 100 21 96 21 19-17 22 92 13\n31.1.41 92 19 96 21 100 20 96 20 19-33 18 92 12\n7.2.41 92 15 96 29 100 19 96 19 18-79 27 92 16\nI4.2.4I 92 17 96 20 100 13 96 20 19-37 17 92 27\n28.2.41 92 21 96 16 100 25 96 18 19-37 17 92 20\nTotals 460 94 480 106 500 98 480 98 96-03 lOI 460 88\nAn inspection of this Table shows that all scores are close to the expected\nvalues.

Goldney [part;\nClairvoyance Experiments, Second Series. A further series of\nexperiments was carried out in which sheets of \u201c clairvoyance \u201d were i\nalternated not randomly but rigorously with sheets of \u201c telepathy In\n'\nthis second series B.S. was told that the sheet was for \u201c clairvoyance \u201d on\n\u201c telepathy\u201d as the case might be.

The rest of the procedure was the same as in the ,\n1\nfirst series. The regular alternation of the two categories would tend to\neliminate any differences due to fatigue and show up clearly B.S.\u2019s re-\naction to the two types of experiment. While the \u201c telepathy \u201d sheets\n^\nproduced highly significant scores, the \u201c clairvoyance \u201d results were again ,\nonly what chance might be expected to produce.\nTABLE III\n(PRN) (Clairvoyance, Second Series, alternated with Telepathy in sheets\nof 50 calls), (Normal Rate) (Clairvoyance results completely negative)\nExtracted \u201c Clairvoyance \u201d Sheets\n- 2 \u2014 2 - I \u201c I 0 0 +\n1\n+\n1\nE( + i) CC + 2 + 2\nDate Trials Hits Trials Hits Trials Hits Trials Hits Stevens ( + i) Trials Hits\n24. 10.41 138 26 144 32 150 32 144 29 30-21 27 138 25\n7.

The experiments described in the pre-\nceding sections made it highly probable that B.S. succeeds only when the\nAgent knows the order of the five pictures in the box. Our next step was\nto discover whether the experiment would succeed if, instead of using\nprepared lists of random numbers, the experimenter (EA) determined the\nAgent\u2019s selection of cards by drawing counters from a bag or bowl at\nrandom. This would produce durmg the process of the experiment the\n\u201c number factor \u201d governing the cards, in place of a series of prepared\nrandom numbers already in existence before the experim.ent began.\nFor this purpose 200 bone counters of the same make and size but in\nfive different colours were thoroughly mixed inside a cloth bag, there being\nequal numbers of each colour. The five colours stood for the digits 1-5\nin the following order ;\nWhite = i; Yellow = 2 ;\nGreen = 3 ;\nRed = 4; and Blue = 5.\nIn order to assist the Agent, five counters with colours in the above\norder from left to right were placed in a row on top of the box, so that\nwhen (EA) showed, say, a red counter at the aperture in the screen,\n(A) would merely have to lift up the card directly beneath the red counter\nbefore her. In actual practice the association between the card positions\nand colours is rapidly memorised, so that the appearance of a colour at\nthe aperture results in the Agent\u2019s almost automatic selection of the\ncorrect card.\nAfter an abortive attempt by S.G.S. who proved to be far too slow in\nextracting the counters at the required speed (by no means easy), this\njob was relegated to K.M.G. who was much more successful in presenting\nthe counters at a constant and \u201c normal \u201d rate. On 14 March 1941, how-\never, in K.M.G. \u2019s absence Miss Ina Jephson selected the counters. In\nthe first two experiments, 7 March and 14 March, (EA) drew the counters\nfrom a cloth bag, replacing each counter in the bag after it had been\n\f5 ^ S. G. Soul and K. M. Goldney ~\n[part Ij\nexposed at the aperture in the screen. After the sitting on 7 March,\nK.M.G. wrote a short report in which she described her method of l\nextracting the counters at the required speed. She writes ;\n'\n\u201cI arranged the bag so that the counters were easily accessible. I then ;j\ndipped each hand in alternately and showed a counter at the screen-aperture j\nwith one hand while the other hand was already delving in the bag for the\nnext counter. At intervals I hesitated just long enough to give the bag a j\nquick shake, and always picked out counters from all corners, and above \u2019\nand below, in order to avoid picking the same counters up twice so far as\npossible.\u201d\nOn and after 21 March, K.M.G. found it more practicable to\nplace all the counters in an open bowl. In order to avoid conscious\nselection, which would destroy the desired random character of the\npresentations, she stood up, looking straight over the top of the screen,\nand selected the counters with alternate hands, letting them fall back into\nthe bowl, and extracting them by touch alone and without looking towards\nthe bowl.\nNow, although this method of selection appears to give approximately\nequal numbers of each of the five colours when the extraction is done at\nnormal speed, this is certainly no longer the case when the speed of\ncalling is doubled, as it subsequently was. Even at a comfortable \u201c nor- 1\nmal rate we doubt if the distribution is \u201c random \u201d in the sense that a\nseries of numbers taken from logarithmic tables (with due precautions) is\na random sequence. But when the rate of selection of the counters is\nj\nincreased to, say, 35 seconds for a run of 25, the numbers become very\nunequal. This, we think, is probably due to the fact that at this increased\nspeed there is not sufficient time for the experimenter\u2019s hand to delve into I\nall parts of the bowl as described in K.M.G. \u2019s note quoted above. If,\ntherefore, there happens to be, say, an excess of white counters on the\nsurface of the bowl, the white counters may be picked up more frequently\nthan those of the other colours.\nIn their Introducttoji to the Theory of Statistics (p. 339), the authors i\nYule and Kendal say :\nSight is not the only sense which may bias a sampling method. In ;\ncertain experiments counters of the same shape but of different colours were\nput into a bag and chosen one at a time, the counter chosen being put back\nand the bag thoroughly shaken before the next trial. On the face of it this 1\nappears to be a purely random method of drawing the counters. Neverthe- j\nless there emerged a persistent bias against counters of one particular colour.\nAfter a careful investigation the only explanation seemed to be that these\nparticular counters were slightly more greasy than the others owing to\npeculiarities of the pigment, and hence slipped through the sampler\u2019s ?\nfingers.\u201d\nWe cannot comment here on their explanation, but quote it as somewhat\nrelevant to the point we are discussing.\nA machine which produced a random sequence of presentations at the i\nrequired rapid rates would of course have served our purpose better than\nthe bag or bowl. The ingenious machine designed by Mr Geoffrey\nRedmayne, based essentially on the principle of the roulette wheel.\nI\n\fPLATE\nIII\n\fPLATE\nIV\nI\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 53\nseemed at first sight to meet all our requirements. It could be used to\ngenerate a random series of 5 numbers, or pictures, or symbols of any sort.\nBut unfortunately, owing to the time taken for the wheel to come to rest,\nthe interval between successive presentations would have exceeded five\nseconds whereas, as we have already stated, this rate is too slow if B.S. is\nto score significant results.\nMoreover, human volition would not enter into the working of a\nmachine in the same way as it is manifest when a person draws counters\nfrom a bag or bowl. The sampler can, for instance, exercise choice as to\nthe corner of the bag in which he feels for his counter. If he has merely to\npress a button which sets a machine in motion (as in G. Redmayne\u2019s\nmachine), he does not possess the same degree of freedom. Had a mechani-\ncal selector been available, we should certainly have made use of it, since\na random sequence was desirable for our immediate purpose ;\nthough, as\nsuggested earlier, the introduction of an element of choice into experi-\nments resulting in precognition on the part of (P), raises a far more\nextensive and intriguing problem.\nAs K.M.G. showed the counters at the aperture and called to (P),\nS.G.S., sitting beside (A) and acting as Recorder, recorded the cor-\nresponding numbers in the (A) column of the empty scoring sheets. In\nsittings 7-10, S.G.S., while recording, sat by the side of the box in such\na position that he could not see the cards. But in subsequent sittings at\nwhich counters were used he sat behind the Agent in such a position that\nhe could not only record the counters but was able at the same time to\ncheck the cards selected by the Agent. As in all experiments [cf. p. 40),\nthe only person to speak a single word was (EA) who did not know and could\nnot possibly see the order of the cards. While K.M.G. and S.G.S. were\noccupied with the counters in the Studio, an observer (O) acted as (EP) in\nthe ante-room. The new method did not affect the successful scoring.\nVariation of Experiments with Animal Picture Cards. On 28\nMarch 1941, instead of using pictures of animals, white cards were used\non which had been printed in block letters the initials of the five -animals\nL, E, G, P, Z. The backs of the cards were blank. In order that the Agent\nshould be able to recognise immediately the letter on the card even if the\nlatter were only raised slightly, the initial was repeated three times in\nminiature at the top and bottom.\nB.S. was not told of this change in presentation material until four\nsheets at \u201c normal rate \u201d had been completed. The results show that the\nsubstitution of initial letters for pictures of the animals did not materially\naffect the successful scoring.^\nIn the next two e.xperiments of this sort on 18 April and 6 June\n1941, \u201cInitial Letters\u201d and \u201c Pictures of Animals \u201d were alternated in\nsheets of 50 at the beginning of the experiment (B.S. being informed of\nthe change). On 13 June 1941 pictures were used for the first sheet only.\nThe pictures were then removed and replaced by white cards on which\nhad been written in block letters the \u201c Associated Words \u201d Trunk, Mane,\nBeak, Stripes, and Neck.

This was the first\noccasion on which the \u201c Associated Words \u201d were employed. The experi-\nment on this occasion showed a negative result, but it was resumed in\nAugust with a better technique and with positive results.^\nIt is interesting to note that B.S. explained to Mr. Richmond (at sitting\nNo. 6 on 28 February 1941) that he seldom gets a mental picture of the\nanimal, but writes down the initial letter \u201c almost automatically \u201d.

Dr. Wiesner, who was acting as (EP) on this occasion,\nreported that at call No. 20 on sheet 3a, B.S. hesitated and got completely\nout of step. The last six (\n+ i) trials were therefore not taken into account.\n(D) The failure with TA (Telepathy with Associated Words) on\n13 June 1941 may have arisen from our having started the experiment\nwith pictures and having then made the sudden change, without giving\nB.S. the slightest warning.

At a later date,\ng as stated above, this same experiment succeeded.\n(E) Some remarks are offered on the failure of experiments on 3 Jan-\nj,\nuary 1942. After B.S. had completed the first two sheets, the experimen-\nters made the suggestion to B.S. that he should now re-orient his mind\nand try only for \u201c direct \u201d hits on sheets 3 and 4. He made the effort but\nI ^said it caused mental confusion. At the end of sheet 4 we suggested that\nlu\nhe should try for ( + i\n)\nhits throughout sheets 5 and 6. Finally he was urged\nj(\nto try for \u201c direct \u201d hits in sheets 7 and 8. It will be seen on referring to\nthe List of Scores (p. 115) that during the first two sheets, before any\n1' disturbing suggestion had been made, the ( + 1) scores ran : 5, 7, 8, 8,\n[k which is quite a good beginning. Immediately after the suggestion was\nn given to \u201c re-orient \u201d and try for \u201c direct \u201d hits, the ( + i) scores fell to\n2, 3, in the next sheet and never recovered. Nor was there any significant\n; success on \u201c direct \u201d hits in sheets 3, 4, 7 and 8. This sort of suggestion\n\u2014\nforced on to (P) in the middle of an experiment\u2014may well upset the\nworking of the psi faculty, and is, of course, very different from that\nmentioned in connection with the experiment of 31 January 1941 (see\npp. 47-48) in which the suggestion of scoring on \u201c direct \u201d hits was main-\n\u2018I\ntained over a whole week preceding the experiment.\nExperiments with Counters at Rapid Rate. On 21 March 1941\nwhen Mr Kenneth Richmond (Editor, S.P.R. Journal) acted as (EP),\nwe made an important discovery. After completing three sheets at the\n\u201c normal \u201d speed (av. int : = 2'77 secs, between successive card presenta-\ntions), it was suggested that the experiment should be speeded up so that\nthe interval between each call was halved, if this proved to be practicable.\nIn order to facilitate this rapid rate of presentation, K.M.G., who had been\ndrawing counters from a cloth bag, now emptied them into a bowl, and\nused the technique already described on p. 52.\nRichmond sat with B.S. to see that he kept in step, noting hesitations\nand gaps, if any, and using a stop-watch. S.G.S. sat next the Agent by the\nside of the box, so that he could not see the cards, and recorded the\ncounters. It was impressed on B.S. that he must keep in step at all costs.\nIf, on hearing the call for a certain cell, B.S. found that his response did\nnot arrive quickly enough, he was instructed to leave that cell a blank\nso that he would be ready to fill in the next cell the instant its serial\nnumber was called.\nThe new experiment was a strain on all concerned. After three sheets\n(Nos. 4, 5, 6) were completed, we checked up the results. We all expected\nthe experiment would be a failure, and we found in fact no significant\nresults on the categories (o), ( + i) or (\n- i) although the preceding experi-\nments at \u201c normal \u201d rate had yielded significant scores on ( + 1) trials.\nThen the suggestion was made\u2014whether by K. Richmond or S.G.S. or\nK.M.G. we cannot now recall\u2014that a count should be made of the ( + 2)\nprecognitive hits. When this was done, it was at once obvious that B.S.\nhad been scoring significantly on (\n+ 2) presentations instead of ( + i ).\n(See List of Scores, p. 95). In other words, when the speed of the calling\nwas approximately doubled, his precognitive faculty skipped the ( + 1)\npresentation and pounced upon the one which immediately followed it.\n\f56 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\niU'4\n'-,re\nTs\nIn order to make sure of our discovery, three more sheets (after a fifteen\nminutes\u2019 rest) were done at the same rapid speed. These were sheets\nNos. 7, 8, 9. The results confirmed our previous observation.\nIn sheets 4, 5, 6, B.S. had left no gaps and had kept perfectly in step|^\nwith the calling. But at column 7a, B.S. shouted \u201c Stop \u201d after recording\nhis entry for call No. 13. After a few seconds\u2019 pause he shouted \u201c Con-\ntinue No. 14 \u201d. K.M.G. then continued \u201c\n14 \u201d, \u201c\n15 \u201d, etc. at the rapid\nrate till the end of the column. During column 7b, B.S. left three blanks\nspaces after call No. 5, but did not get out of step. He left another blank\n'\nspace at call No. 15, and completed the column.\nFor the total six sheets at rapid rate, the average interval between\nsuccessive calls was 1-44 seconds, equivalent to an average time of 34\u20186\nseconds for 25 calls. With our present methods we have not found it\nhumanly possible to work at any substantially higher speed than that! Total\nrecorded in this experiment.\nAll trials at the \u201c rapid \u201d rate with the Agent R.E. are included in\u201e^'\nTables VII and Vila (below). The first Table is devoted to (\n+ 1)\n\u2019\nscores and the second to ( + 2) scores. The results should be compared\nand show that at the \u201c rapid rate\u201d the ( + 1) successes disappear but\nthat the ( +2) scores become highly significant. i! Co\nAs already reported on p. 52, it was discovered later that when counters\nare selected by touch at the \u201c rapid \u201d speed and dropped back into the\nbowl, the distribution so obtained is not strictly random and the numbers j a\nof the different colours are somewhat unequal. Stevens\u2019 method of (B\nevaluating the expectation of hits allows of course for the inequality of thelfi\nnumbers, but at the same time it requires that the presentation objects. .p;\nare randomly mixed. It would perhaps have been better if instead of\nreturning the counters to the bowl we had used a much larger number ofjiionj\nthem and had let each counter fall on the floor after being exposed.\nHowever, with our third Agent, Mr J. Ah, we have obtained abundant\nconfirmation of the reality of the (+2) displacement when the speed is\ndoubled, by using prepared random numbers instead of counters. Hence npi;\nwe have no hesitation in asserting that the effect is a genuine effect. More- ;;\np,.\nover it will be seen (Table VHa) that in the above counters experiments ii).;\na cross-check (CC+2) for (\n+ 2) trials produced 148 hits, which agrees perr\nexcellently with the ( + 2) expectation obtained from Stevens\u2019 method,\nThis is an additional confirmation.\nItc!\"\nTABLE VII\n(Counters) (Tel.)

(A) Even when the ( + 2) score\nI'll )f 6-79 X St. Dev. is considered as the best of the five scores ( iri), ( \u00b12),\n\u2018\"jo), the odds against chance are more than one hundred millions to i, and\nherefore highly conclusive.\n(B) The simplest hypothesis by wEich to account for this conversion\n)f\n(\n+ i) precognitive hits into ( + 2) hits is to suppose that B.S. possesses a\npan of telepathic precognition which ranges between 2 and 3^ seconds into\nhe future, or possibly between 2 and 4 seconds. If the object of presenta-\nion is closer to his \u201c present instant \u201d than, say, two seconds, it is perhaps\n00 near in time for him to perceive it and so he cognises the next object\nvhich is within his span. We cannot of course attempt to fix too accur-\nitely the upper and lower limits of this supposed span of precognition,\n)ut the fact that B.S. invariably fails to cognise telepathic presentations at\n;\nseconds ahead of his \u201c present instant \u201d (see ff p. 58) strongly suggests\nhat the upper limit is somewhere around 3i-4 seconds. All that it is\npermissible to affirm is the possible existence of upper and lower limits.\niVhat these exact limits are could only be determined, if at all, by more\niccurate kinds of experiment. With our present rough methods it is\nmpossible to do more than to suggest lines for future research.\nAn alternative hypothesis is to postulate that B.S. developed a fixed\nprecognitive time-habit engendered by the \u201c normal \u201d rate of calling to\nvhich he had become accustomed during the earlier experiments. If his\n'.pan into the future remained fixed while we doubled the rate of calling,\nlis successes would fall on ( + 2) guesses instead of on ( + i). The fact\nhat he fails entirely to precognise presentations at 5 seconds ahead, might\npe due to the fact that at this slow rate of calling the activity permitted\ni\nI\no his conscious mind militates against the emergence of the psi faculty\ny\nrom the subliminal level. The conception of a \u201c censor \u201d at the turnstile\njpetween conscious and subconscious levels, opposing the emergence of\n_|i|he psi faculty into our everj'day lives, is a hypothesis suggesting further\n|:ypes of experiment.\n\f58 S.

Between 6 June 1941 and\n14 November 1941 we carried out experiments in which successive calls\nwere separated by an interval of just five seconds as timed by a stop-clock.\nCounters were used in the first test of this kind but in subsequent tests\nprepared random numbers were employed. On each occasion that this\nslow rate was employed, B.S. grew very irritable, saying it was useless for\nhim to continue and that \u201c it was enough to drive him mad \u201d. He in-\nvariably failed to score significantly at the five seconds rate. Suggestions\nthat he would eventually succeed appeared to have no effect.\nIn the experiments of 24 September 1941 and 14 November 1941, the five\nseconds rate tests were regularly alternated with experiments at \u201c normal\n\u201d\nrate in batches of 50 calls (See Table X, TPS\/TPN). The results of all\n( + 1) scores at 5 seconds rate with R.E. as Agent are shown in Table X.\nThe numbers of ( + 2) and (\n- 2) trials are not precisely equal owing to the\neffects produced by P.\u2019s losing step and to occasional gaps, as described.\nC\nlO.Ii\nip\nToti\nSloi\nNoi\n1\nat\"\nerei\nthe;\node\nthe\nI\nR,I\nwit\nMt\nliis\nres\nfor\n(\nk;\nfee\nin\nR.I\nsh(\nXI\n\fExperiments in Precognitive Telepathy 59\n167]\nTABLE X\n(Counters or PRN) (Tel.)

In other words, in\nthese two experiments the results on (\n+ i) scores at \u201c normal \u201d rate show\nodds against chance of about 5,000 to one, whereas at the \u201c slow \u201d rate\nthe results are consistent with chance. No further comparison is required.\nExperiments with Other Agents. Twelve other persons besides\nR.E. have at various times endeavoured to act as Agent in conjunction\nwith B.S. (two for only a few calls). W\u2019ith two of these, Mrs G.A. and\nMr J.Al., the results were quite as brilliant as those obtained with our\nfirst Agent, R.E. Quite early on in the investigation B.S. tried to obtain\nresults with his wife as Agent, but was unsuccessful. None of the scores\nwas significant and the reader is referred to List of Scores, pp. 90, 93,\nfor the details.\nOn 21 February 1941, after R.E. had acted as Agent for four sheets,\nK.M.G. took her place, while R.E. watched K.M.G. R.E. sat about three\nfeet away but in a position where she could certainly have seen the cards,\nin the box if she had chosen to do so. It is quite possible therefore that\nR.E. was the unconscious Agent on this occasion, though she reports that\nshe was watching K.M.G. the whole while and did not loqk at the cards.\nBut there is an interesting difference between the results scored with\nK.M.G. as Agent and those previously obtained earlier in the sitting with\nR.E. as Agent. This will be apparent from the following Tables, XI and\nXiA..\n\f6o S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part i\nTABLE XI\n(PRN) (C.

It may be therefore that K.M.G. did have some\ninfluence on the results even if R.E. was the unconscious Agent : though\nperhaps one should hardly suggest conclusions on so limited a number of\nguesses with a new Agent. K.M.G. acted as Agent again on 25 April\n1941 when R.E. was absent. Three sheets only of (PRN) were completed,\nbut the results were not significant.\nResults with Mrs G.A. as Agent. Mrs G.A., who is a friend of\nK.M.G., visited the Studio on 16 May 1941 and 23 May 1941 and acted\nas Agent on both occasions. On the first of these dates R.E. was absent,\nbut on the second she was present and advantage was taken of the fact that\nMrs G.A. had proved herself a good Agent to carry out a special experi-\nment in which two Agents worked together.\nThe results which B.S. obtained when working with Mrs G.A. appear\nto be similar in character to those obtained with R.E. That is to say, at\nthe \u201c normal \u201d rate he scored significantly on (\n+ i) guesses, but not on\nany of the other categories.\nOn 16 May 1941, on 288 ( + i) trials B.S. scored 82 ( + i) hits as against\nan expectation (by Stevens) of 57'79- This is equivalent to 3-56 x Standard\nDeviation (P'~5 x -0004 = 002).\nSpecial Experiment with Two Agents :\n23 May 1941. During the\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 61\nfirst part of this sitting, R.E. acted as Agent for 200 (PRN) calls. This\nwas R.E.\u2019s first reappearance at the Studio since 18 April, her absence\nhaving been necessitated by her mother\u2019s illness and death. K.M.G.\nwas unavoidably absent on this date. Throughout these 200 calls. Dr\nWiesner acted as (EP) and S.G.S. as (EA) while Mrs G.A. sat by the side\nof the box in a position from which she could not see the five cards. As\nmay be seen from Table I (p. 46) B.S.\u2019s score on ( + 1) trials reached\n4-03 X Standard Dev. After these results had been decoded and checked,\nwe commenced on the special experiment. R.E. and Mrs G.A. were each\nhanded four small cards on which were inscribed the following choices of\ncodes\nR.E.\nG L E P Z\nP E Z G L\nP E L G Z\nG E L P Z\nMrs G.A.\nL G P Z E\nL Z P E G\nZ G P L E\nZ P G L E\nThese are arranged so that no letter in any one of R.E.\u2019s four codes is\nthe same as the letter of the corresponding position in any one of Mrs\nG.A.\u2019s four codes. The two Agents were asked to select any three from\ntheir four codes in any order, unknown both to S.G.S. and to Dr Wiesner.\nB.S., who remained in the ante-room and knew nothing whatever of the\nproposed special experiment and the arrangements being made in the\nStudio, was merely told that for the next three sheets Mrs G.A. would be\nthe Agent. He was given no hint that while Mrs G.A. sat behind the screen\nR.E. would be seated a few feet farther back with a second set of five\nanimal picture cards in front of her. The two Agents were asked to select\ntheir codes privately in any order, and to change from one code to another\nat the end of each sheet of 50 calls. The two sets of codes being mutually\nexclusive, it followed that at each call the two Agents were looking at\ndifferent animal pictures. Mrs G.A. sat in front of the box in the usual\nposition, while R.E. sat at a small table some six feet behind her and so\nthat she also could see the random numbers as they appeared at the aper-\nture in the screen. S.G.S. acted as (EA) while Dr Wiesner sat with B.S.\nin the ante-room acting as (EP).\nThe two Agents having each selected a code from the four available\non their cards, arranged their five picture-cards in the order indicated by\nthe code ; the cards being as usual laid face downwards on the floor of the\nbox or table. The experiment then proceeded in the ordinary way and the\nresults were decoded and checked at the end of the third sheet. At every\ncall the two Agents were competing in opposition. The result was that\nR.E. failed absolutely to influence B.S., although she had succeeded\nearlier in the afternoon when working alone as Agent. B.S. had been told\nthat Mrs G.A. was the Agent, and things happened just as if R.E. had\nnot been present.\nA similar phenomenon is often observed when two persons sit in the\nsame room with a medium. If the medium is told at the beginning of a\nsuccessful sitting that visitor (A) is the sitter, and visitor (B) the note-taker,\nthe medium makes contact with (A) and not with (B), and the information\nw'hich is forthcoming generally applies to the circumstances of (A) and\nnot to those of (B).\n\f62 5.

In addition to\nthe three principal Agents (R.E., Mrs G.A., and Mr J.Al.) more or less\nsuperficial tests were made with ten other persons with whom the results\nwere negative. These trials, except in the case of Mrs B.S., seldom\nexceeded 150 calls, and it is quite possible that had we gone on with some\nof these people significant results would have ultimately appeared. These\ntests with other Agents were mostly carried out while R.E. was absent\nowing to her mother\u2019s illness (25 April\u201416 May 1941).

An inspection of Table XIV shows that\nneither individually nor collectively did these 8 Agents score any success\non ( + 1) guesses. Nor are any of the other categories significant. On\nthe other hand, the examination of these eight Agents was a superficial one.\nWith our access to such first-class Agents as R.E., Mrs G.A. and J.AL,\nthere was no need for us to waste time putting B.S. through long series of\ntests with inferior Agents.\nIt may be asked \u201c Do the three good Agents possess any common\nmental characteristic? \u201d We think that two of them (R.E. and J.Al.)\ndisplay great passivity of temperament. Both are very intelligent and at\nthe same time very quiet. B.S., on the other hand, is a nervous type,\nassertive, and a good talker, and has the quick temperament associated with\nartists. But whether this contrast in psychological type between Agent\nand Percipient is important, we do not know. The contrast in type\nbetween B.S. and Mrs G.A. is not so marked.\nExperiments with Mr J.Al. (Group 3). At the end of December 1941,\nR.E. took up a full-time war job which left her with little leisure for helping\nwith the experiments. During the early winter months of 1942 B.S.\nconsidered that his Studio was too cold for us to continue with the experi-\nments in the evenings, especially as his health was not so good as usual.\nWe therefore abandoned the investigation until the beginning of May 1942.\nK.M.G. visited B.S. on a single occasion during this period (16 January\n1942) and conducted some experiments which have been included for the\nsake of completeness. (See The Chronicle, sitting No. 30, and List of\nScores, p. 116.)\nIn the meantime S.G.S. got into touch with Mr J.Al., who had been\none of the principal Agents in the 1936 experiments. S.G.S. has known\nJ.Al. for a good many years and can vouch for his integrity. When working\nwith this Agent in 1936, B.S. scored about equally well on both ( + 1)\nguesses and on (\n- i) guesses.^ We had been puzzled by the fact that with\nboth R.E. and Mrs G.A. he had scored significant results on (\n+ i) guesses\nonly. We were therefore interested to discover whether B.S. would\ncontinue to score only (-Hi) successes with J.Al. or whether the (-1)\nscores would now become significant as well.\nThroughout the work with J.Al. as Agent (9 sittings), the Initial Letters\nwere used instead of the Animal Pictures, but before commencing the\nexperiments J.Al. was shown the five animal pictures and it was explained\nto him that the letters were the initials of the five names of the animals. A\nweek before the first resumed sitting, S.G.S. told B.S. that a new Agent\nwas coming the following week, but he was not told that this was J.Al.\nwhom he had not seen since June 1936. To the best of S.G.S. \u2019s knowledge\nB.S. is unaware of J.Al\u2019s address. K.M.G. was absent from the first\nthree sittings (May 8, 15, 22) and her place was taken by R. G.\nMedhurst, 5B.Sc. As already recorded, Medhurst himself carried out\nthe whole of the work of decoding and counting of hits on each of these\nthree dates.\nIt will be seen by reference to Table XV that significant( - i) postcognitive\nresults were in evidence at the first two sittings while the ( + i) precognitive\n^ See Proc. xlvi, 186.\n\fi6y] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 65\n\u2022scores were barely significant. This was a great surprise. However, at two\nsubsequent sittings on 12 and 26 August, the ( + 1) precognitive results\ngrew much stronger while significant (\n- i) postcognitive effects were still\nbeing produced. As is evident from Table XV, B.S. on the four sittings\ntaken together scored equally well on ( + i) and (\n- i) trials.\nTABLE XV\n(PRN) (Tel.)

(A) It is clear that B.S. has obtained highly\nsignificant scores on both ( + 1) and (-1) guesses. If p is the (small)\nchance of getting a deviation as high as 5-42 x St. Dev., it is easily seen\nthat the chance of getting at least two of the five scores (\u00b11), (o), (\u00b12)\nwith deviations as high as 5-42 x St. Dev., is approximately lop'^.\nBut for X = 5'42 \/><6xio-'\nHence P<io x 36 x io~^^\n= 3-6 X 10\u201c^^\n(B) In 1936 with J.Al. as Agent, B.S. working on Zener cards obtained\n5-38% of \u201c true cognitions \u201d {i.e. successful hits not due to chance) on\n(\u00b1 i) guesses taken together. It can be shown from the results of Table\nXV that in the present (1942) series with J.Al. he scored 10-59% of \u201c true\ncognitions\u201d on (\u00b11) trials taken together. Surprisingly however this\ndifference is not significant, even though one percentage is almost double\nthe other. For discussion see Appendix A, p. 13 1.\n(C) In the present series of experiments with J.Al. as Agent at \u201c normal\u201d\nrate there is, as in the 1936 series, plenty of evidence that the (\n+ 1) and\nthe (\n- i) effects tend to reinforce each other in the case of the multiply-\ndetermined presentations {cf. Introduction, p. 31). This reinforcing\neffect is entirely absent throughout the work with R.E. and Mrs G.A. as\nAgent, as might perhaps be expected, since in the presence of these Agents\nonly ( -f i) cognitions were registered. For a full discussion of the statistical\nproblems involved and the experimental data, see Appendix B, p. 134 ff.\n(PRN) Experiments at Rapid Rate. On 22 May 1942, 5 June 1942,\nand 6 January 1943, we carried out \u201c rapid \u201d rate experiments using\nprepared random numbers instead of counters. The modified procedure\non all three occasions was as follows ;\nThe screen which stood on the card-table was removed, and the five\n\f66 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\ncards which bore the numerals 1-5 were arranged in order on the top of\nthe box which was in its ordinary place on the table. The Agent, J.Al.,\nsat in the usual position, and having shuffled the five \u201c Letter \u201d cards out\nof sight of (EA) and (EP), laid them face downwards in a row inside the\nbox. (EP) sat with B.S. at his desk in the ante-room and the latter had\nbefore him five \u201c Letter \u201d cards similar to those in front of the Agent.\n(EA) stood facing J.Al. on the near side of the box, with his prepared lists 1\nof random numbers. He called i \u20142\n\u20143\u201425 at a rapid rate, and as he 1\ncalled each serial number he touched with a pencil the number card on top\nof the box corresponding to the figure on his prepared list. As J.Al.\nsaw the numeral touched with (EA)\u2019s pencil, he instantly jerked up the\ncorresponding card inside the box and dropped it down into its place\nagain. As B.S. heard the serial number of the call, he instantly touched I\nwith a pencil one of the five letters L, E, G, P, Z, in front of him. (EP)\n'\nrecorded the letter touched in the appropriate cell of the G column.\nThe experiment went without a hitch on all three occasions ;\nthere\nwere no gaps and B.S. was never out of step. It should be noted that as\nJ.Al. was new to the technique, on each of the first two occasions the real\nexperiment was preceded by a rehearsal in which (EA) and J.Al. took part\nusing the previous week\u2019s lists of random numbers. During this try-out\nS.G.S. sat by the box to verify that J.Al. was able to synchronise the\nlifting of the cards with (EA)\u2019s calls at the required rapid rate.\nThe results are recorded in Tables XVI and XVIa.\nTABLE XVI\n(PRN) (TL) (Rapid Rate) (Agent : J.Al.)\n( + i) and (\n- i) Scores\nPoSTCOGNITIVE PrECOGNITIVE\nAv.

(A) The results of the three\n(PRN) experiments at \u201c rapid \u201d rate with J.AI. as Agent appear to confirm\nthe discovery made in the counters experiments when R.E. was Agent\n(see pp. 55-56). In the present series not only do the ( + i\n)\nprecognitive hits\ntend to be replaced by ( + 2) hits, but on two of the three occasions the\npostcognitive (-1) hits appear to undergo a temporal shift and become\n(\n- 2) hits.\nOn the occasion of the first experiment (22 May 1942) these two effects\nseem to proceed simultaneously, but in the second experiment (5 June\n1942) it is only the precognitive hits that are affected and neither the\n( - i) nor the ( -2) effects are significant. The third experiment (6 Jan-\nuary 1943) was carried out after B.S. had had about 17 weeks\u2019 rest and the\nresults are very remarkable. Apparently there were no precognitive effects\nat all, but instead a violent switch over to ( - 2) postcognitive effects is\nnoted.\n(B) An analysis of the sitting on 6 January 1943 from the standpoint\nof multiple-determination reveals a very curious result. There are in all\n23 cases of ( \u00b1 2) multiple-determination\u2014equivalent to 46 ( \u00b1 2) trials.\nOn these 46 trials there are no less than 32 ( \u00b12) successes as compared\nwith an expectation of i8-8o. (This expectation is computed on the\nmutually exclusive hypothesis, see Appendix B, p. 1341!).\nHence we have the following Table showing the successes (S) and\nfailures (F) in the expected (E) and observed (O) classes.\n6 January 1943.

A. Rozelaar, M.A. (Lecturer in French at Queen Mary College,\nLondon University) who acted as (EA) on this occasion wrote :\n\u201c I carried out every step of decoding and checking-up, with Mr S.G.\nSoal (EP) checking every step of the process. The Agent did not speak\nduring the guessing nor did I notice any signs of his signalling by shuffling\nof feet, coughing or in any other manner. I inspected and recorded the\ncode at the end of every 50 guesses.\u201d\nMr Rozelaar took away with him a list of the totals in each of the\nfive categories (o), (ii), (in 2). He also compared each original scoring\nsheet carefully with the corresponding duplicate and himself posted the\nduplicates to Professor Broad.\n\f68 S. G. Soal and K. M.

Mace, M.A., who\nwitnessed our experiments on 21 Dec., 1941, made the suggestion that it\nwould be of great interest to discover whether B.S. would succeed with a i I\nseries of number presentations chosen not at random but pre-arranged in n i;\nsome improbable order. 22\nOn the three dates 15 May 1942, 22 May 1942 and 12 August 1942, i\n>-\nit was arranged that among the (PRN) sheets should come a single column i\nq\nof 25 calls in which the first twelve numbers were all the same digit, ^\nand the last thirteen the same (different) digit. B.S. was given no hint \u00a3;\nthat the \u201c doctored \u201d column differed in any way from the others. The\nresults of the first experiment of this kind are not so striking as those of\nthe other two.\nTABLE XVII e:\nt\nExperiments with Non-random Series ;\n(i)\n15 May 1942 (Tel.)

It will be seen that the total\nnumbers of \u201c direct \u201d hits are :\n7 (first occasion)\n12 (second occasion)\n(13) third occasion)\nIn example (i) the Percipient does not seem to respond to the experi-\nment until the second half of the column.\nWe may examine the question statistically as follows ; the \u201c relevant\n\u201d\ndigits are 5 and 3 in example (i). We may count how many 5\u2019s and 3\u2019s\nthere are in the \u201c correct \u201d part of the column and how many in the\n\u201c wrong \u201d.

From the\ntotals given for each of the 5 digits in the G columns of the scoring sheet,\nwe may, on the assumption that B.S.\u2019s guesses are fairly randomly mixed,\nestimate the number of 5\u2019s that would be expected to appear in a column\nof 25 calls and similarly in the case of all the other \u201c relevant \u201d digits.\nWe thus obtain :\nTABLE XVI IB\nRelevant Digits Non-Relevant Total\nObserved Number - - 32 43 '\n75\nExpected Number - - i4'873 60127 75\nThis gives =2319\n;\nx =4'8\u2014with Yates\u2019s correction, a highly significant\nresult.\nAn e.xamination of B.S.\u2019s calls shows that the assumption of random\nmixing is very well justified. There seems therefore to be a decided\ntendency for B.S. to guess a given digit more frequently when that digit\nis presented in excess in a set of 25 calls than when its frequency is\nnormal.\nThe results of the three \u201c non-random \u201d columns which had of set\npurpose been mixed among the (PRN) columns are of course not included\nin Tables XV and XVI which record the (PRN) experiments of these\ndates.\nSpecial Experiment of 26 August 1942 (\u201c Lift and Touch \u201d Ex-\nperiment). It was explained to B.S. before we began that we wished to\ncompare results obtained with the Agent J.Al.\n{a) having sensation (sight) of the letter at each call, and\n{b) the Agent having only memory content without sensation at each\ncall.\nThe experiment was carried out as follows ; During the {a) column of\neach sheet, J.Al. lifted the cards and looked at them as usual, thus getting\nto know their order ;\nbut during the succeeding {b) column, the Agent\nmerely touched the backs of the cards without lifting them or looking at\nthe faces. The order of the five cards in the box remained the same until\nE\n\f70 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nthe end of the whole sheet, when the cards were as usual re-shulBed by\n(A). We designate the two types of test as \u201c Lift \u201d and \u201c Touch \u201d\nrespectively.\nThere appears to be no significant difference between the two methods.\nApparently, so far as the limited data indicate, experiments with \u201c memory\ncontent \u201d only seem to be as successful as those where there is \u201c sensation\ncontent \u201d as well. The experiments were all at \u201c normal \u201d rate. Taking\n(\n\u00b1i) guesses together, the results for \u201c Lift \u201d and \u201c Touch \u201d are given\nin Table XVIII.

The Percipient, B.S., was never shown\nthese cards, which S.G.S. took home with him at the end of each sitting.\nOn 14 and 25 August 1941 we regularly alternated the ordinary\n\u201c picture cards \u201d with those bearing the \u201c associated words \u201d in batches\nof 50 calls. Thus on 14 August during Sheets i, 3, 5, 7 the Agent (R.E.)\nlooked at pictures of animals, while on sheets 2, 4, 6, 8 she looked at the\nassociated words. (EA) would call out \u201c First Sheet\u2014Pictures \u201d ;\n\u201c Second Sheet\u2014White Cards \u201d ;\netc., so that while B.S. knew that there\nwas some change, he was unaware of its nature. The experiment was\ncontinued at the next sitting on 25 August. At B.S.\u2019s own request on\nthese two occasions five cards bearing the pictures of the animals were\nlaid on the table in front of him and instead of B.S. himself writing down\nhis guess he merely touched one of the five pictures with a pencil and the\nguess was recorded by S.G.S., acting as (EP). S.G.S. noted that B.S.\nalways touched the card from -2 to -4 of a second after the call. The delay\nwas never more than -4 of a second as timed with a stop-watch, but more\noften it was about -2 of a second. B.S. used this method of touching a card\ninstead of writing his guess because he felt it involved less conscious effort.\nWe employed it on several subsequent occasions. The combined results\nfor these two Sittings are given in Table XIX.\nTABLE XIX\n(PRN) (Tel.)

We have also seen that it\nsucceeds when the Initial Letters of the animal names are used.^ We\nthink it very probable that any symbols which the Agent interpreted as\nmeaning Lion, Elephant, etc. would serve just as well.\nExperiment with Zener Cards. We have carried out only one\nexperiment during the present series with Zener cards. This test was\ncarried out at the end of the highly successful \u201c Lift and Touch \u201d experi-\nment on 26 August 1942. The technique was the same, except that the\nfive Zener symbols were substituted for the Initial Letters of animals as\nused in the \u201c Lift and Touch \u201d experiment. B.S. made his guess each\ntime by touching one of the five Zener cards laid on the table in front of\nhim, his guesses being recorded by S.G.S. Three sheets were completed\nbut none of the five scores (o), ( \u00b11), (\u00b12) was significant.\nThe results are given below :\nTABLE XXI\n(-2) (-1) (0) ( + 1) ( +2)\nTrials - - 138 144 150 144 138\nHits - - 27 32 30 36 27\nExpected - 27-6 288 30 28-8 27-6\nX - < I < I 0 + 1-5 < I\nThe result was a failure, but coming as it did at the end of more than\neighteen months\u2019 work with the animal symbols, we may conjecture that\na considerable re-education would be necessary before B.S. became\nhabituated to the use of the Zener symbols again.\nSpecial Experiment with Counters (Influence of (P) on (EA)). Two\nspecial experiments were carried out on 9 May 1941 and 7 August 1942,\nin the absence of the ordinary Agent, in order to discover whether B.S.\ncould influence K.M.G.\u2019s selection by touch of counters from a bowl.\nIt had been suggested by someone that the apparent precognitive successes\nin the counters experiments {cf. p. 51 ff.) might in part be attributed\nto some influence exerted by the mind of B.S. (the Percipient) on the\nmind of K.M.G. (acting as (EA) ), which caused her to select as her next\nchoice the counter corresponding to the animal just recorded by B.S.\nin his preceding guess. Such an hypothesis would of course suppose\ntelepathic rapport between B.S. and K.M.G. and the possession of clair-\nvoyance on the part of K.M.G., unless we assume that she sees normally\nthe counters she draws from the bowl in spite of conscious effort to the\ncontrary. It would require, further, that B.S. was aware of the order of\nthe five cards in the box either by telepathy from (A) or by clairvoyance.\n' See p. S3, Table VI (p. 54), Table XV (p. 65), Table XVI and XVIa (p. 66).\n\f74 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nThe hypothesis seemed to us complicated and improbable in view of the\nfact that the experiment succeeds when prepared random numbers are used\ninstead of counters ;\nbut we thought it worth while to see if any results\ncould be obtained.\nThe experiment of 9 May 1941 was conducted as follows : I\nDr Wiesner (EP) sat in the ante-room with B.S. who had in front of\nhim the five differently coloured counters. B.S. was also given a number\nof scoring sheets whose \u201cA\u201d columns had been previously filled in by\nS.G.S. with random digits 1-5. Dr Wiesner shuffled the five counters\nso that they stood in a row in any order, the order being changed after the\ncompletion of each sheet. B.S. touched the counter whose position in the\nrow corresponded to the random number on his sheet. He was checked by\nDr Wiesner. As he touched each counter, B.S. called out \u201c Right \u201d. On\nhearing this signal, K.M.G. in the Studio immediately chose a counter\nfrom the bowl while looking straight over the top of the screen as she did\non ordinary occasions in the counters experiments. K.M.G. let the\ncounters drop back into the bowl, the contents of which she stirred up at\nfrequent intervals as usual. S.G.S., seated on the other side of the screen\nin the place normally occupied by (A), recorded the numbers standing\nfor the five colours as they appeared at the aperture. After four sheets\nhad been completed, the sheets of random numbers were decoded into\ncolours according to the code records kept by Dr Wiesner. The sheets\nfilled in by S.G.S. were similarly decoded and successes in the five\ncategories counted.\nNone of the scores was significant. The totals are given below.\nTABLE XXII\n( -2) (-1) (0) ( + 1) (+2)\nTrials - -\n184 192 200 192 184\nHits - - 38 46 37 41 32\nExpected - 36-8 38-4 40 38-4 36-8\nX - < I -*-\n1-4 < I < I < I\nIn the experiment on 7 August 1942, no lists of random numbers were\nused. B.S. sat at his desk in the ante-room with five coloured counters in\nfront of him arranged in the order\nW Y G R Bi\nS.G.S. sat opposite B.S. and recorded the ordinal numbers from left to\nright as (P) chose and touched the counters. K.M.G. sat in the Studio\nat the card table with a friend, Mrs Wykeham-Martin. In front of\nK.M.G. was a bowl containing 245 counters, there being equal numbers of\neach of the five colours. B.S. touched the counters one by one with a\npencil at \u201c normal \u201d speed, and as he touched them called aloud the serial\nnumbers i, 2, 3. . . .25. On hearing the serial number K.M.G., who sat\nthroughout with her eyes closed, drew out a counter, letting it fall back\nin the bowl. The corresponding number (in the order W.Y.G.R.B.) was\n^The capitals denote the initals of the five colours.\nA]]\ntecc\nAt!\nim\nb\nT\nDIOS\nproi\nTni\nHits\nExp\nJ\n1\noft\nI\nSTO\nexp\nrat\nvah\npre\nlol\ntoo\nEy\np!c\nin;\nLis\nin\nas;\nby\nor\nsin\naiK\nS:\nMl\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 75\nrecorded in the A column of a scoring sheet by Mrs Wykeham-Martin.\nAt the end of each column of 25 calls there was a pause of 30 seconds\n\u2014\nI minute, during which K.M.G. thoroughly re-shuffled the counters in the\nbowl. Then the work was resumed until 10 sheets were completed.\nThe sequence of 500 counters drawn by K.M.G. appears to satisfy\nmost of the tests of a random distribution, but B.S.\u2019s selections do not\nproduce a random distribution.

Although nobody who witnessed our\nexperiments suggested at any time that the conditions were not entirely\nwatertight, it was suggested by one critic at a later date that it might be of\n,\nvalue to hold a couple of additional sittings away from the Subject\u2019s own\npremises, to see whether this affected the results. B.S. was quite ready\nto fall in with this suggestion and two sittings were held at the Society\u2019s\nrooms in April 1943. Both occasions yielded highly successful results.\nBy this time all calculations on the experiments to date had been com-\npleted, and the results of these two experiments are therefore not included\nin any of the Tables in this Report. The scores however are given in the\nLists of Scores (sittings 39 and 40) and the procedure is described in detail\nin The Chronicle, under dates 8 and 15 April 1943.\nOn each occasion B.S. was taken from his Studio to 31 Tavistock Square\nby taxi, accompanied by S.G.S. and the Agent, J.Al. (K.M.G. being\naway on war work). There they were met by independent persons invited\nby S.G.S. to assist in the experiments. B.S. brought no personal friend\nor Assistant with him.\nAgent and Percipient sat in separate rooms, and the conditions were\nsimilar to those in force at B.S.\u2019s Studio.\nExperiment on 8 April 1943. The experiments on this date were \u201c Lift\nand Touch \u201d experiments (as already described on p. 69). Three persons\nwere present assisting with the experiments : Mr R. G.

This\nconfirms the results obtained on 26 August 1942 {cf. pp. 69-71).\nExperimefit on 15 April 1943. J.Al. was again Agent and Mr D. J. West\nwas invited to assist at the experiment. The experiment was a variation\nof the \u201c Lift and Touch \u201d method used on 8 April. Before each sheet\nwas called, the Agent shuffled the five cards and laid them face upwards\non the floor of the box. He then gazed at the cards for about 15 seconds,\nstudying their order. The cards were then turned face downwards\nwithout changing their order, and as each random number was shown at\nthe aperture in the screen by (EA), (A) merely touched the corresponding\ncard without lifting it to look at its face. Throughout the guessing there-\nfore (A) had no sensation content of the faces of the cards, but memory\ncontent only. (P) recorded his own guesses in pencil.

Owing to the rapid rate at which\nall guessing was done, it would have been quite impracticable for B.S.\nto have graded his guesses A, B, C, D according as he felt them to be\n\u201c very good \u201d, \u201c good \u201d, \u201c indifferent \u201d or \u2018\nbad \u201d. Any attempt to\nimpose such a grading would certainly have ruined the experiments.\nHowever, as he went along, B.S. from time to time volunteered comments\nand marked a sequence of, say, five guesses as being probably better than\nthe rest. Sometimes he would mark a whole column of 24 as \u201c jolly\ngood \u201d ;\nor \u201c this felt good \u201d ;\nor \u201c this felt better than the rest \u201d etc.\nSuch marked groups occur on most dates between 24 January- 1941 and\n14 August 1941. After the latter date he ceased to mark his guesses or\nexpress verbal opinions about special groups. We have therefore counted\nall such marked (\n+ 1) guesses at \u201c normal \u201d rate which were registered\nbetween 24 January 1941 and 14 August 1941 w'hether these occurred\nduring telepathy tests or clairvoyance tests, and irrespective of the person\nacting as Agent {i.e. all Agents are included in the counts). In the absence\nof proper grading of all guesses, the method can only be regarded as a\nvery rough one, but it affords no evidence that B.S. is able to pre-judge\nsuccessful hits.\nThe following contingency table for ( + 1\n)\nguesses shows totals of\nsuccesses on all\n\u2018\u2018\nmarked \u201d guesses and corresponding totals for the\n\u201c unmarked \u201d guesses on the same dates.\n\f78 S.

Does B.S.\u2019s health affect\nhis scoring.? As was mentioned on p. 34, B.S. seldom enjoys good health\nand on account of this fact we made no systematic records of his state of\nhealth at each sitting. On certain occasions however he did complain of\nfeeling exceptionally unwell and a special note was made at the time. The\nfollowing Table sums up the scanty information in our possession.\nTABLE XXIX\nScoring in Relation to Health Etc.\n(N.B.\u2014By the term \u201c True Cognition \u201d is meant successful hits not\ndue to chance.)\nDate\n7. 2.41\nB.S.\u2019s Remarks\nB.S. complained at start of a \u201c bad\nhangover\u201d from the previous night\nwhen he had been to a party.\n% of True Cognitions\n8-85%\n14- 3-41 Before commencing the experi-\nments B.S. complained of feeling\nunwell and advised that if results\nwere not good after first tw'o sheets\nwe ought to stop the experiment.\ni7'53\u00b0o\n18. 4.41 B.S. reported that he didn\u2019t feel\nlike getting good results as he felt\ntired after the very bad \u201c blitz \u201d of\ntwo days earlier\n\u2014\u201c but of course\none can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d\n8-51%\n(Normal rate)\n10-96%\n(Rapid rate)\n23 - 541 Before the experiment B.S. re-\nported \u201c kidney trouble \u201d had been\nbad during the past few days and\nthat he was still in pain.\n1\n5\n'34% with Agent R.E.\n24-48% with Agent G.A.\n10. 10.41 B.S. was in a bad humour from the\nstart.

She made and filed this note :\n\u201c During today\u2019s experiments, I had a feeling of \u2018\nHow absurd this is.\nThere is nothing happening at all. There will be nil results I\u2019m certain.\u2019\nCommenting on this feeling and intending my remarks to be merely con-\nversationally descriptive of it, I remarked to R.E., acting as Agent, \u2018\nI\u2019m\nsure today will be an absolute blank.\u2019 R.E. remarked \u2018\nWhy do you say that?\u2019\nand I rejoined \u2018\nI just feel it in my bones ;\nit feels as flat as flat can be.\u2019\nResults however were good (3\u20194i x St. Deviation).\u201d\n\f8o 5. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nThe note indicates well enough the fact that even our most successful\ndays produced no \u201c atmosphere \u201d of attainment during the process of the\nexperiments, though naturally enough we experienced feelings of elation\non some occasions when particularly good or interesting results were\nbrought to light during the later analysis of the scoring sheets.\nDiscussion of the Experimental Methods Employed\nWe gave much thought and discussion throughout to the question of\nrendering the conditions in which these experiments took place proof,\nso far as was humanly possible, against even the possibility of fraud, on\nthe part of Percipient and experimenters alike. In this we were helped\nby the nature of the psi function displayed by B.S., since any form of\nfraud or collusion which would cover precognitive telepathic cognition\nwould obviously be extremely difficult, if not impossible.\nAs we have recorded, we invited at intervals independent persons to\ncome and witness the experiments. Appendix I gives the names of all\nsuch persons who attended the sittings as Observers or otherwise assisted\nus in the experiments. Invitations were issued to several more people,\nbut their war-work and difficulties of war-time travel prevented their\naccepting. Only those who have had practical experience of organising\nregular experiments and meetings will appreciate the difficulty of getting\nfive and six persons gathered together week after week, some travelling\nconsiderable distances\u2014a difficulty enormously increased in war-time.\nS.G.S. was himself evacuated to Cambridge and had to travel to London\nfor the experiments. This made it impossible to hold them normally more\noften than once a week at week-ends. On no occasion was a request to us\nto attend and witness the experiments refused ;\nindeed, we should have\nmore than welcomed it had some of the Observers found themselves able\nto come more often. At a first visit the experiments were fully explained,\nand Observers were given complete freedom to do what they pleased\nand were asked to furnish us subsequently with their criticisms and\nsuggestions. Many of their observations are quoted in the following\npages, and no single unfavourable comment has been withheld.\n(i) Signalling. All the Observers testified that they considered the\nresults were not due to any kind of signalling, direct or indirect, between\nAgent and Percipient. In the first place the rapid and uniform rate of the\ncalling in itself precludes the successful use of such signals. Visual signals\nare clearly impossible. Even if anyone were concealed in the Studio in\nsuch a position that he could see the cards inside the box (which is not\nconsidered possible by anyone who has seen the Studio), this person\nwould be unable to convey the information so acquired in time for it to\nbe of any use to B.S. If B.S. were receiving visual signals it would soon\nbe obvious to the person sitting next to him, for he would have to keep\nlooking up from his scoring sheet. Further, it is not the card being turned\nup by (A) that would have to be signalled, but the card that is one card\nahead. B.S. cannot leave any gaps in his scoring column to be filled in\nlater, since (EP)\u2014who is frequently the independent Observer\u2014is watch-\ning him all the time. He must fill in cell No. ii immediately after call\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 81\nNo. II. Mr Kenneth Richmond, Editor, S.P.R. Journal, has perhaps\nsaid the last word on the impossibility of any visual aid reaching B.S. He\nwrote ;\n\u201c It is obvious that even if he had had a television screen before him\ngiving a plain view of each card as it was selected, he would have been no\nbetter able to note the succeeding cards before they were selected.\u201d\nDr B. P. Wiesner, consulting biologist, wrote :\n\u201c It seems to me that the obvious explanations (signals) are fully excluded\nboth by the set-up and by the consistent manner in which the experiment\nwas performed.\u201d\nBut what of auditory signals? The Agent sitting on the far side of the\nscreen could not (unless she were in collusion with (EA) )\nsignal by any\nsound the tiext card, because she has no means of knowing what this card\nwill be. She is unable to see the sheets of random numbers from her side\nof the screen. But suppose she is in collusion with (EA), it might be\nasked : Is this credible when we remember that (EA) has been S.G.S.,\nK.M.G., Aliss Jephson, Mrs Woollard, R. G. Medhurst, L. A. Rozelaar,\nand D. J. West ;\nand that (A) has been R.E., Airs G.A., and J.Al. ?\nAgain, all the OlDserv\u2019ers who have sat next to (A) while she is turning up\nthe cards, testify most emphatically to the fact that she never speaks,\nwhispers, coughs, scrapes her feet, moves her chair, or acts in any way\nwhich even the most suspicious could look at askance, or which could\nconvey any code information. PI. Chibbett, a most sceptical observer,\nwrote :\n\u201c Aliss E. kept silent during the whole of each experiment. There was\nno whispering or muttering on her or anybody else\u2019s part.\u201d\nAliss Ina Jephson, a pioneer in card-cognition experiments and S.P.R.\nCouncil member, wrote :\n\u201c I saw no sign of a code between any of the people involved, heard no\nunnecessary talking, coughing or whispering.\u201d\nProfessor H. Habberley Price, Wykeham Professor of Logic in the\nUniversity of Oxford and ex-President of the S.P.R., wrote :\n\u201c I should like to say that, so far as I can judge, the methods you have\nadopted are perfectly watertight and fool-proof. It seems to me impossible\nthat the Percipient should obtain knowledge of the card that is being shown,\nin any \u2018\nnormal \u2019\nmanner; still less of the card which is going to be shown\na few seconds later.\u201d\nSir Ernest Bennett, M.P., member of the S.P.R. Council, wrote :\n\u201c I am convinced that no exchange of signals, audible or visual, was\npossible between Agent and Percipient, and that under the conditions which\nprevailed any form of collusion was ruled out.\u201d\nMr C. A. Alace, Reader in Psychology, University of London, wrote :\n\u201c In general the precautions against fraud seemed to me to be very\nthorough. My previous acquaintance with (EP) [S.G.S.] was sufficient to\n\f82 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\ndispel suspicion in that direction and (EA) [K.M.G.], previously a stranger\nto me, seem.ed to be adequately guaranteed by (EP). (P) and (A) were in a\ndifferent position. In their case I could certainly observe nothing to suggest\nthe possibility of deceitful collusion, but everything here depends upon the\nconditions of the test making collusion impossible. Visual and auditory\nsignals were, I think, adequately precluded, but to meet any suspicion of\nother kinds of signal it would perhaps be advisable to conduct a series of\ntests in another environment.\u201d ^\n\\\\n-iat other kind of signal Mr Mace had in mind besides visual and\nauditory signals we do not know, but we should perhaps point out that a\n\u201c timing code \u201d (i.e., a code conveyed by varying the interval between\ncalls, or similar device) is not possible, since (EA) who calls the serial\nnumbers is unaware of the order of the cards in the box. Neither can\n(EA) give anything away by the inflections of her voice for the same\nreason. As stated previously, (A) or (O), the only persons who know the\norder of the cards, never speak at all ;\n(EA), the only person who speaks,\ndoes not know the order of the cards ;\nand the attention of (O) is particu- :\nlarly put on guard to safeguard this very point. The supposition that\nK.M.G. acting as (EA) is the signaller and that she is in collusion with\n(A) or (P) is not credible, since the same highly significant scores achieved\nwith our chief Agent and K.M.G. are continued with Miss Jephson, Mr\nMedhurst, Mrs Woollard, and Mr Rozelaar acting the part of (EA) and\nwith two other persons playing the part of (A). It is not plausible to\nassume that outside visitors of the highest character would immediately\nenter into collusion with someone they had met for the first time.\nIt should be added that with all the Observers cited above significant\nprecognitive results were obtained. They are none of them describing *\nwatertight conditions on occasions when nothing happened. They took I\npart in the checking and decoding, and watched the evaluation of the\n'\nresults. They all carried away with them impressions of high scoring. [\nPersons like Miss Jephson, Mr Mace, Professor Price, Dr Wiesner, are all\n'\nsufficiently acquainted with Rhine\u2019s work to know that the average score\nfor 25 calls is 5, and that when they witness long series of sevens, eights,\ntens etc. with scarcely a single score below 5, they have witnessed some-\nthing that is out of the ordinary. Mrs Woollard, a member of the S.P.R.,\nwho had assisted Mr Herbert, Research Officer, in his experiments with\nZener cards on many occasions, remarked that our scores were \u201c thrilling \u201d j\nand quite different from any she had seen with Mr Herbert.\nOn some occasions (noted on each occasion in The Chronicle), Mr i\nB.S.\u2019s Assistant, Miss Jervaise, sat at the work-table (B)2 in the far\nj\ncorner of the ante-room, continuing her normal photographic work ;\nbut j\nshe did not enter the Studio while the guessing was in progress and it was\nimpossible for her or anyone else in the ante-room to see the card-table.\nBut we have frequently obtained high significant results on occasions\nwhen no-one was present on the premises except (EA), (EP), (A), (P),\nand (O).\n* To meet Mr Mace\u2019s suggestion two additional experiments were subsequently\ncarried out at the rooms of the Society for Psychical Research. (See pp. 75-\n77 )-\n\u201c See Plan, Plate I.\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 83\n(2) Collusion. Let us suppose that everj'thing is pre-arranged between\nB.S., the experimenters, and the Agent before the sitting. This pre-\narrangement would be upset by the fact that on many occasions it was\n(O), the outside observer, who shuffled the five cards at the commencement\nof each sheet of 50 calls. Moreover, on such occasions (O) sat by the side\nof (A) and had the cards in view from the moment of shuffling till the\nend of the series of, say, 150 calls. Highly significant results were obtained\nunder such conditions. Mr Chibbett wrote :\n\u201c I shuffled the cards face downwards for each experiment in such a way\nthat neither S.G.S. nor Miss E. nor myself (being the only persons in the\nroom at the time) could have any knowledge of their code-order on the\ntable.\u201d\nActually, during this shuffling (A) and (EA) moved away to a remote\npart of the Studio and only returned when (O), who retained his seat at\nthe card-table, intimated that the cards were ready.\nMiss Jephson wrote :\nI\n\u201cI am satisfied that when I shuffled the cards at the beginning of each\nseries it was done out of sight of both S.G.S. and Miss E. (and of course\nof Mr B.S. in the other room). I am quite satisfied that the cards could not\nhave been seen by anyone not standing immediately behind Miss E. I am also\nsatisfied that Miss E. turned up the correct card indicated by the printed\nrandom-number held at the little opening by S.G.S. (acting as (EA) ). I\nvery carelessly did not notice whether foot-shuffling or signalling took place\nunder the table, but my impression is that this did not happen. I was\nsatisfied that the lay-out of the five cards, the decoding, the checking of\nscore-sheets was allowed thorough supervision and that I was allowed to re-\ncheck any series I chose. When at the end of the experiments I had to leave\nthe Studio to go and turn on my car lights, S.G.S. gave me all the records of\nthat afternoon\u2019s work to take with me, so that there should be no opportunity\nof their being tampered with before they were posted to Dr Broad. I brought\nthe records back, copies were made, and the records posted by me at once.\u201d\nMr Richmond wrote :\n\u201c On the occasions when I was witness of the procedure at the experimen-\nI\nters\u2019 table, I myself shuffled the cards before each experiment out of sight\n) of the experimenter who thus had no opportunity till the experiment was\ni ended of knowing in what order they were placed before the Agent.\u201d\nIn order to meet the possible suggestion that S.G.S., who prepared the\nsheets of random numbers, might be in collusion with (P) and (A), it was\narranged that on three occasions these sheets should be compiled by\nI\nanother person who posted them direct either to K.M.G. or to Mrs\n'1\nW\u2019oollard.\n'\nFor the experiment on 5 December 1941, at which Sir Ernest Bennett\n'\nwas present, Mr Gerhard Wassermann, B.Sc., compiled eight sheets of\n1: random digits (1-5) in his lodgings at Cambridge with no-one present\nI but himself. He posted these sheets, which S.G.S. had no opportunity of\nseeing, to K.M.G. at her home in London, 153 Rivermead Court, Hurling-\nj\nham, S.W. 6. On each sheet G.W. had written in his own handwriting\nj\n\u201c Prepared by Gerhard W^assermann \u201d. K.M.G. brought the envelope\n\f84 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nunopened to the sitting on 5 December, and immediately before the\nexperiments started it was opened by Sir Ernest Bennett in the Studio.\nS.G.S., who was (EP), remained in the ante-room till the experiment was\nfinished.\nFor the experiment on 21 December 1941, at which Mr Mace was\npresent, eight sheets of random numbers were prepared by Mr C. U.\nBlascheck, of Clare College, Cambridge, in his rooms and posted by him\nto Mrs Woollard at 7 North Hill, Highgate, N. 6 on 3 December. Mrs\nWoollard had instructions to receive this envelope (marked \u201c Not to be\nopened till immediately before the experiment \u201d) and to keep it unopened\nin safe custody. When it was known definitely that Mr Mace was coming\nto see the experiment on 21 December, S.G.S. wrote to Mrs Woollard\ninstructing her to seal up the envelope in a larger one and post it to Mr\nC. A. Mace at Vale Farm, Hobbesley, Woodbridge, Suffolk. Mr Mace\nbrought the envelope to the sitting unopened, and only opened it in the\nStudio immediately before the experiment began. He handed the sheets\nto K.M.G., who was acting as (EA), one at a time as required, keeping\ncharge of the others. On each sheet Mr Blascheck had written \u201c Prepared\nby C. U. Blascheck \u201d.\nFor the sitting on 5 June 1942, Mr Wassermann again prepared in\nCambridge four sheets of random numbers from logarithmic tables, and\nafter sealing the envelope containing them with three large seals, posted it\nto K.M.G. in London. K.M.G. brought the envelope unopened to the\nsitting on 5 June and immediately before the experiment started she\nopened it in the Studio in the presence of Mr J.Al. alone. On inspection\nthe seals showed no signs of tampering.\nOn each of these occasions the independent compiler signed a statement\nmade out in his own handwriting. We will merely quote that by G. D.\nWassermann written on 2 June 1942.\nI hereby certify that on Saturday May 30th 1942 I prepared from\nlogarithmic tables four sheets of random numbers i to 5 at my lodgings 15\nVictoria Park, Cambridge, nobody but myself being present. Subsequently\non the same day I sealed the envelope with three seals and posted it to Mrs\nGoldney, 153 Rivermead Court, S.W. 6. Mr Soal could have had no\nopportunity of seeing the sheets, and till the time of posting I had constant\ncontrol of the envelope. On each of the four sheets I had written \u2018\nPrepared\nby (signature).\u2019\nSigned\n(Gerhard Wassermann)\n2.6.42.\u201d\nUnless of course it is assumed that Mr Wassermann and Mr Blascheck\nwere in collusion with S.G.S., it is difficult to see how on these three\noccasions the latter could influence the results in any way. On all these\nthree occasions highly significant results were scored by B.S. (see Part 2,\nList of Scores, under appropriate dates).\n(3) Statistical. On his visit to the Studio on 21 December 1941, Mr\nMace asked this pertinent question :\n\u201c How are you going to prove to a\nsceptic that the results with high scores are not the most striking results\nselected from a much larger quantity of data? \u201d In other words, would it\nnot have been possible for us to carry out an enormous number of real\n1^;\n01\ncai\nitif\nu\nan\n56:\nta\nk\ni\u00abi\npe\nH\nsir\ntl;\nsit\nI'l\nsir\nfr(\ni\n'S\nla\nan\nwi\njt\non\n(tl\n0\ncc\nIt\nal\nR.\nai\nar\n*'\nt(\nlo\n\fi6y] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 85\n(or fictitious) experiments, select from them the scores of highest signifi-\ni cance, and say nothing about the remainder?\nWe at once told Mace that we had an adequate reply. It is as follows :\nAn inspection of Appendix I and List of Scores (Part 2) shows that\nthere are 13 sittings at each of which there was present an outside observer\n:\nwell-known to the S.P.R. and at which the value of x (critical ratio) for at\nleast one of the five categories (o), (\u00b11), (\u00b12), exceeds 3. Now the\nchance of getting one at least of the five scores with a deviation numerically\ngreater than 3 x Standard Deviation is nearly 5 x Hence (on an\naverage) to get 13 such deviations we should have required about 74 x 13 =\n962 sittings at the majority of which observers known to the S.P.R. would\nhave had to be present. Let us however suppose that in reality we\nhad managed to crowd this number of sittings into years, always invit-\ning a person known to the S.P.R. When this Report appears, some 900\npersons (or at any rate several hundred) would be asking why their sitting\nwas not mentioned in it.\nBut in point of fact this estimate of 962 sittings is a gross underestimation,\nsince the values of x obtained at the 13 sittings are usually much higher\nthan 3 and often rise to 4, 5, or even 6. A hundred thousand unrecorded\nsittings in the z\\ years would be a truer estimate, but it is clearly not worth\nwhile pursuing the argument further. We state emphatically that every\nsingle sitting and every single experiment has been recorded in this report\nfrom beginning to end of our experiments to date.\nIn his comments, Mr Mace (who apparently was unaware of Mr Rich-\nmond\u2019s account of his two visits to the Studio in the Journal for June-July\n1941), suggested the use of counters instead of random numbers (which\nhad already been done) and the substitution of other persons for (A), (EA),\nand (EP)\u2014variations which had also been previously effected. S.G.S.\nwrote to Mr Mace pointing out that a good many of his suggestions had\nin fact already been adopted and he replied ;\n\u201c Dear Soal,\nThank you for writing so fully in reply to my observations. You\nwere, as I anticipated, in a position to meet fully nearly all, if not quite all\nmy points. I cannot find time just at present to write anything further\n\u2014\nnor I imagine is it necessary. But some time we might meet and discuss\noutstanding points of interest and possible variations of the experiments . .\n.\u201d\n(the rest of letter irrelevant to matter in hand.)\nChecking up of Results. We have already mentioned that none of the\nObservers has made any adverse criticism of the methods of decoding and\ncounting of hits. It may perhaps not be out of place to quote the com-\nments of Observers who made written allusion to the question. We have\nalready given Miss Tephson\u2019s remarks (p. 83) and the comments of Mr\nRozelaar (p. 67).\nSir Ernest Bennett wrote : \u201cI took part personally with Mrs Goldney\nand Mr Soal in the final checking-up of results and can testify to the\naccuracy of the record.\u201d\nMr Richmond wrote :\n\u201c Mr Soal\u2019s habitual exactitude in method is\nwell-known, but I may note for completeness that I observed all the pro-\ncesses of checking-up results in detail on the record sheets, and saw no\nloopholes for error.\u201d\n\f86 \u2018l\nS. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nThe only Observer who was unlucky enough to witness only negative\nresults was Dr H. G. Baynes, the well-known psycho-therapeutist. The\nreason was possibly that we were on this occasion using \u201c Associated\nWords \u201d for the first time, without giving B.S. any warning of a change\nin thi\" cards. Dr Baynes wrote :\n\u201c I am not skilled at all in appraising the\napparatus and methods used in these experiments. But the method I\nwitnessed the other night is certainly proof against any interference other\nthan that of infernal powers.\u201d\nThe Record Sheets. Professor Sidgwick, in his first Presidential address\nto this Society, said \u201c We have done all that we can when the critic has\nnothing left to allege except that the investigator is in the trick. But when\nhe has nothing else left to allege he will allege that So perhaps the last\nresort of the sceptic will be to suggest that the record sheets were tampered\nwith by the experimenters themselves at the conclusion of the sittings.\nBoth experimenters would need to have been in collusion : it would not\nhave been possible for one to have tampered with the figures without the\nconnivance of the other, since both experimenters checked the results\ntogether and affixed their signatures to each sheet, and the duplicates were\nposted to Professor Broad immediately on leaving the Studio, in full sight\nof both experimenters and the Agent, R.E.\nWe cannot deny that if it is assumed that both K.M.G. and S.G.S. were\nbent on trickery, it would have been possible, on those occasions when no\nObserver was present, to have made out false record sheets and duplicates\nto agree with them. Many Observers were unable to stay long enough to\nwatch the lengthy business of re-checking and duplicating the scoring\nsheets : they had trains to catch, other appointments, etc. But this was\nnot the fault of the experimenters, who expected and asked them to remain.\nOn the other hand, many Observers, such as Mr Chibbett, Miss Jephson,\nMr Medhurst, Sir Ernest Bennett, Mr. Rozelaar, Mr West, did stay on\nto the end (see Chronicle), and on these occasions the original scoring sheets\nwere directly under their observation from the time of the first checking-up\nto the final posting of the duplicates to Prof. Broad (posted on such occa-\nsions by the Observer himself). An inspection of the List of Scores\n(Part 2) on occasions when Observers were present, reveals long runs of\nhighly significant ( + i\n)\nscores in which scarcely a single column shows a\nfigure lower than 5 correct hits.\nThe experimenters themselves, however, were anxious to have a check\nnot on their honesty but on their accuracy. Each separate sheet of figures\nhad involved checking 240 pairs of figures for the five counts ( - 2) to\n( + 2), making the duplicates was a boring business which might easily\nhave led to carelessness, and all this had had to be done at the end of a\nlong day\u2019s work and before a late supper. Still further copying of the\ntotals had had to be done for the typing of the List of Scores. We therefore\ndistributed all the original scoring sheets and a carbon copy of the typed\nList of Scores (Part 2) among the following persons : Mr Richmond, Miss\nJephson, Mr Redmayne, Mrs Woollard, Mr Medhurst, Mr Chibbett,\nMrs Johnstone, and Mr Rozelaar. The first five of these are members of\n16\ntliii\ntk\nrec\n(\u00b1\nact\nalsi\n(i,\nini:\nwo\nWT\npal\neac\nori\n01\nT1\nSo\nOVi\ntill\not!\nvei\nret\neni\nlos\nfin\nPn\nam\nLi:\nhu\nSC(\nsi:\nIci\nOIJ\nnc\nas\n3r\np'\n\u2019 Proc. 1 ,\n12 .\n\fi6y] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 87\nthis Society. At the same time Professor Broad was asked to post them\n'\nthe corresponding duplicate record sheets in his possession. Each\nrecipient was asked to check up all scores in the five categories ( \u00b11)1 (o).\n(\u00b12) on the typewritten List of Scores against the results obtained by\nI\nactual recounting of the hits on the original scoring sheets. They were\n! also asked to check the totals written in ink at the top of each column\n^\nagainst the results obtained by direct counting. This was\nimportant since any tampering with the figures in the column itself\nwould have involved a corresponding alteration in these totals, which were\nwritten at the actual time of the sitting in the presence of both the experi-\nmenters and any Observer present. The checker was also asked to com-\npare the original records with Professor Broad\u2019s duplicates, and to sign\neach of the typewritten Lists of Scores as being in agreement with the\noriginal and duplicate. In cases where the checker himself had acted as the\nObserver at any of the experiments, he was asked to examine his signature.\nThe originals were returned to S.G.S. together with the signed Lists of\nScores, and the duplicates were returned direct to Professor Broad.\nIn all the original scoring sheets so checked, covering the experiments\nover the total period, less than a dozen isolated errors were found, none of\n;\nthem being in the precognitive groups. They practically cancel each\n;\nother out and are of no significance whatsoever. There were similarly a\nj\nvery few unimportant copying errors in the duplicate scoring sheets\nI\nreturned to Professor Broad. The List of Scores, Part 2, as now published\nI\nincludes the corrections made as the result of this independent re-checking.\nThere were six occasions on which the whole of the checking up and\nentering of figures was carried out by the Observer himself, who never\nlost control of the original scoring sheets from the instant when they were\nfirst handed to him to the moment when he posted the duplicates to\nI\nProfessor Broad {cf. The Chronicle, under dates 8, 15, 22 May 1942\n!\nand 6 January and 8 and 15 April 1943). Statistically these six occasions\nalone would be sufficient to establish the paranormal faculty of B.S. {cf.\nList of Scores for these dates).\nOn some occasions the Observers (including Mrs Woollard, Mr Med-\nhurst, Mr West and Mr Rozelaar) copied out the totals from the original\nscoring sheets and took them home for retention. This was an additional\nsafeguard.\nThis carries the description of experiments up to April 1943. When\nleisure and other favourable circumstances permit, we hope to continue\nour investigation of B.S.\u2019s remarkable powers. Many questions are\nnecessarily left unanswered. For instance :\n\u201c What happens at rates of calling which range between 80 and 120\nseconds for a column of 25 calls? Is there a gradual falling off of significance\nas we slow down the tempo, or does some other remarkable effect make its\nappearance? \u201d\n\u201c Could B.S. be trained to succeed at the 120 seconds tempo by the aid of\npersistent suggestion carried out over a long period?\n\u201d\n\u201c Would the experiment succeed if carried out at a great distance by\nmeans of the telephone?\n\u201d\niCf. Plate II.\n\f88 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\n\u201c Does B.S. succeed only with Agents who possess a peculiar psycho-\nlogical make-up, and if so what are the distinguishing characteristics of the\nsuccessful Agent? \u201d\n\u201c Do the onlookers or experimenters have any influence upon the results?\u201d\n\u201c Would the experiment he successful if the random digits were selected\nmechanically and not by human agency?\n\u201d\n\u201c Would B.S. continue to score precognitively in the counters experi-\nments if the counters were selected by sight (conscious choice) instead of by\ntouch alone?\n\u201d\nB.S. has obtained successful precognitive results over a period of years.\n\u201c Will his powers decline gradually, or cease suddenly as happened in the\ncase of the Subjects investigated by Rhine, Reiss, Pratt and other experi-\nmenters; or will he continue in possession of his remarkable powers?\u201d\nWe do not know. Whatever the future may have in store we may\nsafely hazard the opinion that B.S. has made psychological history and\nthat his name will rank among those whose gifts have added to our know-\nledge of that \u201c final mystery\u2014oneself \u201d.\nNote.\n\u2014Students of the subject are referred to the private files of the\nSociety for Psychical Research for the duplicate scoring sheets which were\nsent during the progress of the experiments to Professor Broad in Cambridge,\nand for certain correspondence of interest in connection with the case\n;\nand to S.

Owning\nto war-time necessity for paper economy, it has been decided to omit this\nlengthy record. For those who wish to make a study of the Chronicle,\nduplicated copies can be obtained on application from the Society for\nPsychical Research, and references to the Chronicle in the text have, there-\nfore, been left intact.\nThe Chronicle for three sittings only is given below, to indicate the\nconditions in force.\nSITTING No. 8. 14 March \u201941 (5 p.m.)\n\u201c Telepathy \u201d experiments, with prepared random numbers and with\ncounters drawn from bag governing selection of cards {cf. p. 51, and List of\nScores, p. 94).\nItems\n1.

During sheets 1-3 (PRN), Miss Jephson sat at the experimenters\u2019 table\nand shuffled the cards before each 50 calls out of sight of both (A) and\n(EA). She also checked (A\u2019)s selection of the cards and the taking down\nof the code. During sheets 4-6, Miss Jephson drew counters from the\nbag for the (Counters) experiments and showed them at the aperture\nin screen. S.G.S. acted as Recorder, sitting to the side of the box so\nthat he could not see the cards inside it.\nMrs Gatty had to leave at the end of sheet 3, after taking part in the\nchecking-up of results with Miss Jephson, S.G.S., and R.E.\nDuring sheets 4-6, B.S. sat alone in the ante-room.\nCards for sheets 4-6 shuffled by (A) out of sight of (EA) and Recorder.\n8.

She took with her all the original scoring\nsheets.\nOn her return she assisted S.G.S. and R.E. in making out the duplicates\nand posted them herself to Professor Broad in Cambridge.\nRemarks. \u2014Mrs Gatty reported in writing :\n(1)\n\u201c Mr B.S. filled in all his spaces in strict order one after the other,\nleaving no gaps to return to afterwards.\n(2) He wrote down his first guess at once on hearing the first call from\nS.G.S.\u201d\nFor B.S.\u2019s comments see Report, p. 78.\nSITTING No. 28. 21 December '41 (12.30 p.m.)\n\u201c Telepathy \u201d experiments alternated with \u201c Clairvoyance \u201d (cf. p. 50 ff.)\nin sheets of 50 guesses, with prepared random numbers governing selection\nof animal picture cards. \u201c Normal \u201d rate.

Mirror in Studio covered by large cloth\u2014away from card-table.\n6. (EA) calls serial numbers 1-25; B.S., (P), keeps in step with these\nnumbers for his guesses.\nN.B.\u2014At B.S.\u2019s own request an innovation was made in the method\nof recording guesses. B.S. and (EP) sat facing each other on opposite\nsides of the table. In front of (P) were five cards bearing pictures of the\nfive animals and placed faces upwards. When (P) heard the serial\nnumber of the call, he spoke his guesses in a low tone and S.G.S.\nrecorded the initial letter of the animal\u2019s name in the appropriate cell\nof the G column. The interval between (EA)\u2019s call and (P)\u2019s guess was\nalways less than half a second. (P) was told that the sheet was for\n\u201c telepathy \u201d or \u201c clairvoyance \u201d as the case might be, this being called\nout by (EA).\nAs described on pp. 83-84, the envelope containing lists of random\ndigits which Mr Mace brought with him to the sitting was opened by\nhim inside the Studio. The sheets were handed to K.M.G., (EA), one\nby one as required. They were never seen by S.G.S. or by B.S. until\nthe end of the sitting.\nDuring sheet i, Mr Mace sat near (P) in ante-room. During the\nremaining sheets he was in the Studio except during sheet 3, when he\nreturned to the ante-room and sat near (P).\nCards shuffled by (A) out of sight of (EA).\nCode recorded by (EA).\n7 -\n8 .\n167]\n^ See Plate I.\n\fi6y] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 129\n9. At the end of sheet 7, Mr Mace returned to the ante-room and collected\n(P)\u2019s sheets which he took into the Studio. They were laid on the table\nfor decoding etc. S.G.S. read out (P)\u2019s guesses which were decoded\nand entered by K.M.G. with Mr Mace checking both. Mr Mace\nwatched the counting of hits and the evaluation of the critical ratio for\n( + 1) hits. Before he left, Mr Mace said he thought the experiment\ncould hardly have been done better. The rate of calling was a little\nquicker than usual.\n10. Mr Mace signed the record sheets but was unable to stay to watch the\nmaking of duplicates. These were done as usual by K.M.G., S.G.S.,\nand R.E., and posted immediately in the box outside the Studio to\nProfessor Broad in Cambridge.\nRemarks.\n\u2014As this experiment was done on a Sunday morning,\nB.S.\u2019s Lady-Assistant was not present at work. Before Mr Mace\u2019s\narrival, K.M.G. tried calling in time to a metronome (practice only),\nbut B.S. declared that it would be hopeless to expect him to get results\n\u201c with that confounded thing ticking away in the other room \u201d, so the\nidea was abandoned.\nDuring sheet 3, while Mace was in the ante-room, B.S. declared that\nhe was \u201c getting more vibrations from Mr Mace than from the Agent \u201d.\nSo at the end of this sheet [Mr Mace] returned to the Studio, as described\nabove.\nSITTING No. 59. 8 April \u201943 {6.10 p.ni.)\nHeld at the rooms of the Society for Psychical Research, 31 Tavistock\nSquare, London, W.C. i.

Parsons were seated in the Society\u2019s seance room at\nor near a small table. From his position here, (P) was quite unable to\nsee into the next room in which the Agent sat. (EP) recorded (P)\u2019s\nguesses.\n3. (A) and (EA), as well as Miss Fairbairn, sat in the ante-room adjoining\nseance room, at a table on which were the screen and box enclosing\ncards (as used in B.S.\u2019s Studio and brought here). (A) and (EA)\nseparated by screen : cards inside box in front of (A).\n4. Door between seance room and ante-room left very slightly ajar to\nfacilitate hearing of (EA)\u2019s call.\n5.

When four sheets were completed, Medhurst and Miss Fairbairn,\nworking together, decoded (P)\u2019s guesses and entered the numbers in the\nG. column; counted the hits for the three categories ( + 1), (o), and\n(\n- i); and watched S.G.S. evaluate the critical ratio. They then made\n\f130 S. G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nduplicate records and these were checked against the original sheets by\nMedhurst and Parsons. Medhurst took charge of the duplicates (after ol\nthe originals had been signed by all four experimenters) and posted b\nthem to Professor Broad.

That\nis to say, in cases where it is possible for both a ( -1-\n1) cognition and a (\n- i)\ncognition to occur at the same guess, only one of these and not both can\noccur.\n{b) That ( + i) and (\n- i) true cognitions are independent of each other.\nThat is to say, when a guess is sandwiched between two cards of the same\nsymbol, there may occur a ( + i) cognition only or a ( - i) cognition only\nor both a ( -I-\n1) and a (\n- i) cognition.\n(r) That in the case of the guess sandwiched between two cards of the ;\nsame symbol, the ( -)-\n1) and (\n- i) presentations may tend to reinforce each\nother : so that the chance of (say) a ( + i\n)\ncognition is higher in this case\nthan it would be where the guess lay between two cards of different\nsymbols.\n\f167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 135\nOf the two hypotheses [a) and [b), the second {b) is the more natural,\nbut on the other hand hypothesis (a) leads to the greater theoretical\nexpectation of (\u00b11) hits.\nTake first hypothesis [a).\nIn the case of the m multiply-determined guesses, the expectation of\n(\n+ i) true cognitions will be p7n and the expectation of (\n- i) true cogni-\ntions is qm. Hence the expected number of (\u00b11) hits taken together\ncorresponding to these true cognitions will be 2 (p + q)m. Of the remainder\nthe number of ( \u00b1 i )\nhits due to chance will be f {m -pm - qm).\nHence the total expectation of hits ( \u00b11) on the m multiply-determined\nguesses is\n2{p + q)m + |(w -pm + qm)= \u2014 [i + 4^{p + 9)].\nNow take hypothesis {b).\nIn the case of a multiply-determined guess, the chance of a ( + 1)\ncognition is p and that of a (\n\u2014 1) cognition is q. Hence the chance that\nneithei' a ( + i) nor a (\n- i) cognition will occur is (i -p){i -q) since the\nchances are independent.\nClearly then the expected number of (\u00b11) hits corresponding to true\ncognitions will be\n2m[i-{i -p){i -q)]= 27n[p + q-pq].\nOn the remaining guesses the number of (\nl i) hits arising from chance\nOffL\nwill be \u2014 [i ^ +pq]-\nHence the total expectation of ( \u00b11) hits on the rn multiply-determined\n2,Ttl\nguesses will be 2m[p + q-pq]+ \u2014 [i -p-q-^pq)_\nim\nHence hypothesis {a) leads to the greater expectation though in practice\nthe term fg usually small, and the difference between the two\nexpectations is not very important.\nHypothesis (c).\nIn order to test whether hypothesis (c) is probable, we shall choose the\nhigher of the two expectations to be on the safe side.\n[\nThe above analysis is more accurate than the method of treatment\n!\nadopted in the previous paper by S.G.S.^ but the conclusions arrived at\nin that paper are quite unaffected.\nWe shall first apply the method to the work of B.S. with the Agent\n: J.Al. with whom, it will be remembered, (\n- i) as well as ( + i) cognitions\n\u2018\nwere scored.\nThere were 1440 (\u00b11) trials.

(See Table XV, p. 65.)\nIt follows that there are 7375 ( + 1) true cognitions and 78-75 (-1)\ntrue cognitions.\nHence ^ = 73-75-^720 = 0-10243\n9 = 7875^720 = 0-10937.\nHence taking hypothesis {a) (mutually exclusive case) we find the\nfollowing expectations and observed values for successful hits (S) and\nfailures (F).\nS F Total ( \u00b1 i) (M.D. trials)\nE . - - 106-31 181-69 288\nO - - . 142 146 288\nWhence, with Yates\u2019 correction = 18-36 and = 4-28, a highly significant\nresult (P<3 x io~\u00ae).\nTaking hypothesis {b) we have F= 103-82 instead of 106-31 and the\nresult would be still more significant (^=4-62).\nOn the other hand the Group i Agents ^ with whom B.S. obtained only\n( -f i) cognitions do not produce any M.D. effect on ( \u00b11) guesses.\nFor these Agents we have 12,077 ( \u00b1t) trials at \u201c normal \u201d rate.

As the distri-\nbution is random we should expect to find 23x2x21x^ = 193-2 (\u00b12)\nguesses of the multiply-determined type, since the maximum number for\na single column is 2x21.\nThe actual observed number of such M.D. trials is 204, which is in\ngood agreement with expectation.\nNow on the 529 ( + 2) trials (P) scores 149 ( + 2) hits\nOn,, 529 (-2) \u201e \u201e \u201e i5i(-2)hits.\nWhence, proceeding as in the previous section, we obtain on hypothesis\n(a) (mutually exclusive case) the following expectations (P), and observed\nvalues (O), for ( \u00b12) successful hits (S) and ( \u00b12) failures (F).\nS F Total (\u00b12) (M.D. trials)\nE _ - - 74'89 1291 1 204\nO - - . 104 100 204\nWhence with Yates\u2019 correction = 17-27 or x = 4\u2018i,\u2014a highly signifi-\ncant result in favour of the hypothesis of reinforcement (P<4 x io\u201c\u00ae).\nAPPENDIX C\nSingle Successes and Success Groups\nIt was the impression of both experimenters while the work was in\nprogress that the successful hits were not randomly distributed in the\nseries but tended to crowd together into runs, as though extra-sensory\ncognition occurred in short spasms.

As a matter of fact the\nhigher times [i.e. slower rates) occur for the most part in the earlier\nexperiments with R.E. as Agent while S.G.S. w'as (EA), whereas the\nrates round about 50-60 seconds occur as a rule after K.M.G. became (EA).\nAll that can be inferred safely is that varying the rate between 50 and 80\nseconds does not appear to inhibit significant scoring of (\n+ 1) hits.\n\f[part\n142 S.

That is to say the material is not homogeneous.\nThe difference between the two variances 8-0278 (Counters) and\n; 5-462 (PRN) is just (dubiously) significant. With the usual notation we\nhave\n\u20223^ = 1-1513 (logio 8-028 -logio 5-462) = 0-1925\nWith = 64-75 ;\n\u201d2= \u2019'84-875. we find by the Interpolation method\n{cf.

G. Soal and K. M. Goldney [part\nAPPENDIX H\nTwo Preliminary Experiments\nTwo experiments were carried out on first contacting B.S. again, before\nthe commencement of the series proper. The conditions were far from\nideal, the sittings being merely for the sake of preliminary exploration.\nWe record them however in this Appendix, in order that no single experi-\nment, from first to last, should be left unrecorded. We shall refer to\nthem as Experiment A and Experiment B.\nExperiment A\nExperiment B\n31 Dec. 1940; S.G.S.=(EA); R.E.=(A);\n17 Jan. 1941; S.G.S.=(EA); R.E.-(A);\nB.S.-(P).\nB.S.=(P).\nConditiom.\u2014These were to all intents and purposes identical at each\nsitting. Doors D2 and Da^ were kept closed during progress of experiments.\nB.S. sat alone in ante-room in front of fireplace recording his guesses. His\nLady-Assistant was also in ante-room at work at work-table (B)^ and did\nnot enter Studio while experiments were in progress. (EA) and (A) sat\nat card-table in Studio. Five plain white cards, shuffled by (A), were spread\nout, face downwards, in front of the Agent, on the faces of which had been\npasted strips of differently coloured paper\u2014brown, blue, green, yellow,\nred\u2014the other sides of the cards remaining blank. S.G.S. referred to\npreviously prepared sheets of random digits i -5 ;\nhe pointed with a pencil\nto the card before Agent corresponding in turn to the figures on his list;\nthe card was lifted and looked at by (A) and dropped back into place. (EA)\ncalled \u201c Are you ready? \u201d\u2014\u201c First Card \u201d\u2014\u201c Next \u201d\u2014\u201c Next \u201d to (P) in\nthe next room, who recorded his guess on the sheets with which he had\nbeen provided and called back \u201c Right \u201d each time after doing so. At the\nend of every 5 guesses he added \u201c 5 \u201d, \u201c 10 \u201d, \u201c 15 \u201d, \u201c 20 \u201d, as the case\nmight be, to ensure that he was keeping in step with (EA). At the twenty-\nfifth call (EA) shouted \u201c Last guess \u201d. There was then an interval of six or\nseven seconds before (EA) called \u201c Second column. Are you ready? First\ncard\u2014Next\u2014Next \u201d etc. The code for (A)\u2019s cards was recorded at end of\n50 guesses, and checking up of B.S.\u2019s guesses was also carried out after each\nsheet of 50 guesses. The cards were then re-shuffled by (A) and the next\nsheet proceeded with in the same way. At the end of the fifth and last\nsheet, signatures of S.G.S., B.S. and R.E. were entered on each sheet.\nNo duplicate records were made on either of these first two occasions.\nScoring sheets were taken home by S.G.S. and re-checked.\nRESULTS OF EXPERIMENT A\nSheet la ib 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b 5a 5b\n(Precog.)

As there are 10 columns, the number of precognitive\ntrials is 10 x 24 =240, and the expected number of precognitive ( + i) hits\nis i of 240 =48. The actual number of ( + i) hits in experiment A being 62,\n^ See Plate I.\n\f:\n167] Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy 145\nwe have a positive deviation of + 14 which, compared with a Standard Error\n!\nof 6-197, gives x= 2'26 withP= 02. As however this result is chosen as\nthe best of the three scores ( + i), (o), and (\n- i), the chance of getting at\nleast one of the three scores with a deviation (either + or -) of this magni-\ntude is approximately 3 x-o2= o6. The result therefore can scarcely be\nregarded as significant.\nRESULTS OF EXPERIMENT B\nSheet la ib 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b 5a 5b Totals X\n(Precog.)

As has been recorded in the Report, B.S. has never been able\nto score any significant postcognitive successes while working with R.E.\nas Agent.\nTimes were not recorded for either experiment A or B, but the average\ninterval between successive calls was probably within the limits of the\n\u201c normal \u201d rate : i.e. between 2 and 4 seconds.\nThe defects of the above-mentioned technique are obvious. No screen\nseparated (A) from (EA) ;\n(EA) might catch a glimpse of the cards as\nthey were lifted by (A) and therefore act as unconscious Agent in addition\nto (A) ;\nhaving seen the card, it would become possible for him to convey\na code to (P) by inflection of the voice in making the calls. (P) was not\ncontrolled in any way and his recording of guesses was not checked.\nAfter these two preliminary experiments and at the commencement of the\nseries proper, due precautions were taken to eliminate all such obvious\nobjections. As recorded, animal picture cards were used in future and\nthe colour-cards discarded, B.S. having told us he found colours confusing\nand that he felt he would do better with pictures of concrete objects.\nAPPENDIX I\nPersons who witnessed and took part in the experiments\n(see The Chronicle)\nDr H.

Saltmarsh 151\nOBITUARY\nMr H. F. Saltmarsh\nThe death of Mr H. F. Saltmarsh on 24 February 1943, deprived the\nS.P.R. of a most loyal and valuable member who had not only made\nimportant contributions to the Proceedings but had also devoted much\ntime and trouble and business ability to the financial affairs of the\nSociety.\nSaltmarsh was born at Highgate on 16 July 1881. As a young man he\nwas engaged in a business connected with the shipping of cargoes to and\nfrom the Baltic, South American and other ports. He was compelled by\nill-health to retire at an early age, and he was a semi-invalid for the rest of\nhis life ;\nbut he derived considerable benefit from the treatment of an\nunorthodox medical practitioner whose death some few years ago was a\nserious misfortune for him. Saltmarsh married in 1904, and he and his\nwife lived for many years at Lynton. Mrs Saltmarsh is a keen musician,\nwhilst Saltmarsh, to his great regret, had little natural ear for music ;\nbut\nhe learned through her to love the works of certain composers, in particular\nher own favourites, Beethoven, Chopin and Grieg. He had a strong love\nof nature, for wild flowers and for birds and their song ;\nand he and his\nwife were able to indulge this freely by driving about the beautiful country\nnear Lynton in their little car. Before the war it was an annual pleasure\nof the present writer, when visiting Mr and Mrs Hugo Mallet at their\nhouse near Lynton, to meet the Saltmarshes and to exchange ideas with\nthem on congenial topics.\nSaltmarsh was a man of wide interests and varied accomplishments,\nboth mental and bodily ;\nand this, combined with his training in business\nand his experience of men and things, made him an exceptionally complete\nand balanced person. He was a skilful worker with his hands, constructing\nin his workshop all kinds of useful and ingenious articles for the house\nand doing most of the repairs which lesser men have to employ tradesmen\nto do for them. He was a skilled and courageous sailor and an enthusiastic\nfisherman, and it was remarkable that a man of his delicate health could\nbear the hardships and dangers to which he freely exposed himself. He\nnot only sailed boats, but also built them ;\nand the last of three little\ndinghies which he constructed is still in use in Lynmouth harbour.\nSaltmarsh had a high sense of his duty towards his neighbour. He\nmight have been excused if he had made his ill-health a pretext for\nretiring into his armchair, but instead he gave unstintingly his time and\nhis financial experience to the service of the public and of individuals in\nLynton and the neighbourhood. In one case, which happened to come\nto the present writer\u2019s notice, Saltmarsh took great pains to extricate from\nits difficulties and to set upon its legs a tea-shop which had good possi-\nbilities but was in a poor way when he took charge. Anyone who worked\nwith Saltmarsh soon recognised his business acumen, his thoroughness, and\nhis extreme conscientiousness and high standards of rectitude.\nIn Psychical Research he showed all the qualities which marked his\npractical activities. But here there entered another factor also, viz., his\n\f152 Obituary [part\ninterest in philosophical questions. As a young man he had made a\nconsiderable study of theosophical literature, and in later life he studied\nand enjoyed the more austere reflexions of contemporary critical philoso-\nphers. Two philosophical problems interested him particularly and were\nclosely connected with his work in Psychical Research, viz., the nature of\nthe human self and personal identity, and the nature of time and causation.\nThe former led him to ask insistently :\n\u201c What precisely is meant by the\nproposition that so-and-so has survived the death of his body ?\n\u201d The\nlatter became pressing in reference to his studies in the evidence for Pre-\ncognition. On both topics he made suggestions which were ingenious\nand stimulating, even if they cannot be accepted in the precise form in\n'\nwhich they are offered.\nSaltmarsh\u2019s two most important contributions to Psychical Research are\nhis Report on the Investigation of some Sittings with Mrs Warren Elliott\n{Proceedings, Vol. XXXIX) and Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition\n{Proceedings, Vol. XLII). Both are models of their kind. In the Mrs\nWarren Elliott investigation two classes of sitting were held, viz., those at\nwhich the sitter was present in person (\u201c Present Sitter \u201d) and those in\nwhich he was represented only by a \u201c relic \u201d sent long beforehand in a\nsealed package to the S.P.R. rooms and chosen at random by the note-\ntaker on the day of the sitting (\u201cAbsent Sitter \u201d). The records of each\nsitting were annotated both by the sitter or the owner of the relic, as the\ncase might be, and by strangers who were asked to treat them as if they\nthemselves had been the sitters or the relic-owners (\u201c Pseudo-Sitters \u201d).\nSaltmarsh then scored, in accordance with a system which he explains,\neach record (i) as annotated by the real sitter, present or absent, and (ii)\n'\nthe same record as annotated by one or more pseudo-sitters. In this way [\nhe tried to test whether the scores where significantly higher in the real ;\nsittings than in the pseudo-sittings. Then he considered whether there\nwas any significant difference between the scores of real present-sitter and\nreal absent-sitter sittings ;\nbetween the amount of correct post-mortem\nand ante-mortem statements ;\nand so on. Lastly, on the basis of his\nfindings, he draws some tentative conclusions about the psychological\nmechanism of the mediumistic trance, about the functions of \u201c relics \u201d,\nand about various alternative theories which have been proposed to account\nfor ostensible communications from the dead.\nIn the same volume (XXXIX) of the Proceedings there is a short but\nimportant joint paper by Saltmarsh and Mr Soal, entitled A Method of\nEstimating the Supernormal Content of Mediumistic Communications. The\nessential problem is to devise a method of scoring such that true state-\nments shall get positive marks which increase with the improbability of\ntheir being true by chance and false statements get negative marks which\nincrease with the improbability of their being false by chance ;\nsuch that\nthe marks for a number of statements are additive ;\nsuch that the most\nprobable aggregate score for a large number of purely random statements\nis zero ;\nand such that the standard deviation of various possible aggregate\nscores about the most probable value is calculable. Mr Soal devised such\na method and it was submitted to Professor Fisher, who introduced certain\nmodifications. Saltmarsh applied it to score the results of certain of the\nWarren Elliott sittings. Saltmarsh had to make assumptions about the\n\fH. F. Saltmarsh\n167] 153\nantecedent probabilities of statements of various kinds being true. Since\nthen attempts have been made on a large scale to determine empirical\nfrequencies and substitute them for such conjectural antecedent proba-\nbilities.\nThe Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition in Vol. XL1\n1\nis much the\nbest survey of the material which exists in English. It is admirably\narranged, subdivided, and classified. Saltmarsh was compelled to recog-\nnise the occurrence of non-inferential precognition, and he propounds a\ntheory of an extended sub-liminal specious present to account for it. He\nalso considers in some detail the question whether the occurrence of veri-\ndical non-inferential precognition is compatible with free-will. In this\nconnexion he uses a number of ingenious mechanical analogies. If, as\nappears to the present writer, Saltmarsh did not carry heavy enough\nmetaphysical guns to attack with much hope of success the hardest of all\nphilosophical problems, he made a gallant attempt and he failed where\nno-one else has come within sight of victory.\nThe cream of this paper is skimmed and served up in the very useful\nlittle book on Precognition which Saltmarsh contributed to Messrs. Bell\u2019s\nadmirable series of monographs on Psychical Research. He is responsible\nfor another book in this series, viz., that on Cross-Correspondence. This\nis a triumphant exhibition of Saltmarsh\u2019s powers of extracting the essence\nof a complicated mass of material and presenting it in a clear and agreeable\nform to the intelligent layman.\nThe three remaining papers in the Proceedings are of slighter importance\nand all bear on the same topic. They are Is Proof of Survival possible?\n(Vol. XL) ;\nSome Comments on Mr Tyrrell's Paper on Individuality (Vol.\nXLIV) ;\nand Ambiguity in the Question of Survival (Vol. XLVI). These\nare all theoretical papers, dealing with the vital question of what is meant\nby the survival of a personality and what are the criteria by which to judge\nwhether such and such empirical facts are evidence for survival.\nThe above account of his life and work should suffice to show how\nmuch the S.P.R. and Psychical Research have lost by Saltmarsh\u2019s death.\nThose who had the privilege of knowing him personally will feel that they\nhave lost a friend who was a firm rock of courage and honour and good\nsense, and they will be inspired and somewhat abashed at the thought of\nwhat he accomplished in the face of constant ill-health and frequent\nsevere discomfort. C. D. Broad.\nMr Saltmarsh joined the Society in 1921 and lost little time in taking an\nactive part in our work. 'In 1931 he became a member of Council and in\nFebruary, 1939, on the retirement of Mr Piddington, he was appointed a\ntrustee of the Research Endowment Fund, and kindly consented to serve\nas the \u201cActing Trustee\u201d, making himself specially responsible for looking\nafter the investments of the Fund and keeping the Fund accounts. When\non the outbreak of War our Hon. Treasurer, Admiral Strutt, went on\nactive service, Mr Saltmarsh also took over the work of acting Treasurer\nof the Society. In both capacities his business training, his exact habit\nof mind, and his keen and prompt attention to detail were of the greatest\nservice to the Society. He was, in fact, from 1939 until his death the key\nman of the Society\u2019s administration. All who have been during these\n\f154 Obituary [part 167]\nyears concerned with the administrative side of the Society\u2019s work have\nvery special reasons for feeling the loss of so highly endowed a colleague.\nProfessor Broad has referred to his high sense of duty towards his\nneighbour and his unsparing efforts to be of practical help. He found\nopportunities to help in many directions, not least in drawing on his great\nexperience in psychical research for the benefit of those who through\nbereavement or other causes stood in need of sympathetic advice. When\ndiscussing in our Journal and Proceedings the question of human survival\nhe very properly wrote with the detachment of a philosopher and scientific\ninquirer, but this was not in any degree incompatible with a sympathetic\nunderstanding of the personal side of the problems he had constantly in\nmind.\nI take the liberty of quoting from two very sympathetic letters which he\nwrote to a friend bereaved by the war. \u201c I suggest that we are wrong in\nidentifying the \u2018\nme which I now recognise as myself \u2019\nas the total true\nme. The first of these two \u2018\nme\u2019s \u2019\n\u2014call it for brevity, the superficial\nme\u2014is a composite being, largely composed of elements derived from the\nphysical body ;\nit is ephemeral seeing that the compound will be broken\nup at death and one set of elements, viz., the physical, dispersed. ... I do\nnot believe in the survival of the superficial me, nor do I desire it. . . . In\nhonesty, I must confess that I am not completely convinced that there is\nany survival at all. I am inclined to think there is, but am not quite sure.\u201d\n\u201c If by what little I have been able to contribute to psychical research |\nI have added anything towards arriving at a solution\u2014and by solution I\nmean not only the optimistic but also the pessimistic view\u2014I am satisfied, J\nbut it is necessary to the value of any contribution to knowledge that it I\nshould be unbiassed. j\n\u201c I hate dogmatism but I am so uncertain of the correctness of my j\nopinions that I would never seek to persuade where I cannot convince.\u201d 1\nW.
