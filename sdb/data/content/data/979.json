That this Church is but One,\nthat there is not Another. And,\n3. That we muft be of that\nChurch to be fav'd.\nThe Difficulty is, What this\nChurch is ? A Difficulty found out\nby the Genius of evil Men, who\nbeing not contented with what is\nreveaPd in God's own Book, have\nfought out many Inventions, and\nwritten Cart-loads of Books, more\ncapable of diftraclipg Thoufands,\nthan of direfling One Man in the\nRight Way to Heaven.\nAs for my Part, I think to fee\nplainly (and without much to do)\nthis Churchy in God's Holy and In-\nfallible Wordy that Word, to tphichy\nvphojoe-ver dddeth any things andfrom\nwhichy whojoever tak^th any things\nis\n\fThe Preface.^ v\nis curfed. For believing ftedfaftly\nthat Jefus Chrifly and Jefus Chrifi\nAlone, is the Way^ the Truths and.\nthe Life: I fee there a Society of\nMen profefling to Believe in Him,\nhaving Communion together in the\nUfe and Participation of\" all and\nevery one of the Ordinances which\nHimfelf hath Inftituted to thatPur-\npofe : And thefe Ordinances, ac-\ncording to the Letter of their In-\nftitution, are adminiftred by Hands\nrightly Ordained thereunto ; For\nno Man taketh upon him this Of*\nficCy but he that is Called^ as Aaron\nwas. So that this Church is One, be-\ncaufe the Members thereofhave One\nand the fame Faith in the Holy Je-\nfus, and their Communion is in\ntht Partaking of thefame Ordinances^\nwhich are all of his Inftitution,\nattfl of no Body elfe\u00bb This is the\nOne Holy Catholick and Apoftolick\n[ a 2 ] Church,\n\fvi The Preface.\nI^hurch, which hath its Orthodox\nMiniftry of Bifliops, Pdefts, and\nDeacons untainted with Schifhij,\nfjerefy, or Apoftacy- who minifter\nduly the undefiled Service of the\nChtirch without Superftition, or I-\ndoHzing any Creature, whethei^\nPead Men, or Men Alive, or any\npther Material or Image j for our\nGod is a Spirit^ that will bcWor^\nJhi^p^d in Spirit and in Truth\nlerefore, that God may be\nrightly Served and truly Glorified\nupon Earth by this holy Congre-\ngation, let him be the fole Obje<3:\nof ail Religious Worfliip.

Secondly,,\nLet all Chriffians purify themfelves-\nfor the pure Worlhip oi that God,\nrpbofe Eyes are fo ptire^ that he cannot\nbehold Iniquity^ And\n\fThe Preface, vii\nAnd above all Things, Let us be\nwell fatisfied, that the God with\nwhom we have to do, is not only\nthe Eternal God, without Begin-\nning or End; not only the Al-\nmighty God, who doth whatfoever\npleafes him, and hath made all\nThings ; not only the infinitely\nwife God, who ordereth all things\nrightly and juftly, and hath creat-i\ned nothing with a Capacity to op-\npofe his Will. But let us alfo con-\nJider well, and never forget, that\nour God is Ens perfe ExiflmSy a\nSpirit who hath his Being from,\nHimfelf, and is All-fufficient to\nHimfelf ; who as he hath created\nAll Things of Nothing, fb he can\nreduce them to Nothing when he\nwill, and his Hand can never be\nIhortned j he can create Thdufands\nof Worlds, and govern them with-\nout Help, or even the Concurrence\nof\n\fviii The Preface.\nof any Creature, leaft of all of Sa-\ntan, or of thofe devililli Spirits,\nfuppofed to be fo bufy about the\nAffairs of this World, and fuch\npowerful Inftruments in G o d's\nHands to vex and punifh Men\n;\nwhereas we cannot but know and\nacknowledge that our Sins are Pro-\nvocations enough, and our felves\nfufficient Inftruments for all the\nJudgments he thinks fit to inflift\nupon us.\nAnother Thing is abfolutely ne-\nceliary. That our God may have\nbis Due, and be truly glorified by\nus, tho' his unworthy Servants, and\nthat is, that we hold faft and perfe-\nvere in the Profeffion of our holy\nChriftian Faith, and be well forti-\nfied againft all ArIan and. Socinian\nHerefies,that we may own and pub-\nlilh that the firft Foumlation of this\n- . Chriftian\n\fThe Preface, ix\nChriftian Religion is, that Jeftts\nChrifiy the Eternal Son of God is the\nOnly Mediator and Redeemer promifed\nby the Prophets ; which is not proved\nby a ftronger Argument, than that\nwhich is formed from the Meffage\nfent by St. John the Baptift to our\nSaviour by two of his Difciples^\nand Christ's Anfwer to him,\nLuke vii. 19, 20, 21, 22. For now\nMen do not make fufficient Reflec-\ntion upon that Place, as this Book\ndoth ; that our Saviour takes no\nNotice of his calling out Dxraons,\nwhich St. John^s Difciples had feea\nhim do ; for by this it is evident,\nthat this Cafting-out, was the Cur-\ning one fort of thofe Difeafes,\nwhich the Prophets had faid the\nChrift fhould heal, as an infalli-\nble JProof that he was the Mef-\nliah promifed.

Finally\nhe tells us, that he hath taken away the\n4^rt of Divination from the Gods, to\nappropriate it abfolutely to the Djsmons.\nIt is alfo the Opinion of Afuleius^ in the\nfore-cited Place, wherein he attributes\nto Dssmons all the Miracles that are\nwrought, all the Prophefies of Things to\ncome, and all Sacrifices.\nThat if the People oflyjlra cryed out,\nfeeing a Miracle done by the Apoftles,\nthat the Gods become like.

It may be faid, that the\nApdftles Miracle feemed {6 great to the\nPeople of hjpa^ that it rnade them raife\nup their Thoughts immediately to the\nCeleftial Gods, and to call for Sacrifices,\nwhich the Prieft did not oppofe ; their\nBufmefs 5 being to keep the People in\ntheir blind Devotion ; but from thence\nno Conclufion can be drawn againft\nwhat we read of the Doftrine com-^\nmonly held among the Heathen.\nCeljus fpeaks not what is afcribed to\nMm; and what is truly quoted of him^\nfhews plainly that he believ'd a Sovereign\nC 2\n\f20 y^TREATlSE\nDivinity, above all the reft ; and Daemons,\nthat were his Lieutenants, Satrapes^ and\nGenerals of his Armies.

And for this\n\" Reafon, we are to receive with Faith\n^*\nthe divers Obfervations of Reiip;ion,\n^' the Devotions of facred Ceremonies\n^^ and Sacrifices. The Meaning is^ that\nif Men had refpefl: only to the Ce-\nleftial Gods, who can be fenfible of\nnothing, there would be no need of all\nthe Ceremonies of Religion ; they fliould\nbe honoured, according to TrifmeoiRuis\nOpinion^ by pure Obedience andThankf-\ngiving : But that by reafon of the Varie-\nty, which the Demons are capable ofi\nall thofe Religious Ceremonies mail: be\nobferved, whereby Men do endeavour,\neither to appeafe them, or to get Fa-\nvours from them. Whereupon it iTiOuld\nbe noted, that the Celeftial Gods, who\nwere Da^m.ons before, having not quite\nH put\n\f98 ^^ Treatise\nput off their Nature and former Af-\nfecVions, were, according to PhtarcVs\nOpinion, to be ferved both as Gods and\nas Daemons, that is >^'ith a mixt Wor-\nfhip, honouring them with Hymn^\nand Praifes, as PUto teaches ; it is like^\nwife requifite tt) build them Temples,\nto offer Sacrifices to them to pleafe\nthenij to keep clofe to the Ceremonial Ob-\nfervations of Religion, as it is prafti-\nfed in the Wordiip of Demons. Seeing\nthererore, that the Multitude of Gods\nwhich the Keatben worfhip'd in their\nImages, with Sacrifices and other Rehgi-\nous Services, were either Dixmons Me-\ndiators, or Demons raifed up to Hea-\nven, and all fuch Gods as had been Men,\nas appears, by the Hiliories oftheir Lives,\nand of theh' Tranflations : It follov\/s,\nthat all the Religion of the Heathen\nconfifted in the Worfliip of Dead Men;\nand that St. Paul was in the right\nwhen he faid, That what th.e Heathen\noftered, they offered it to D^-mons ;\nfor thus It iliould be trandatcd, and\nnot to Devils,\nOi\n\fof spirits.

By this St. Faul\nhath taught us thefe two Things in\ngeneral, i. That the Heathen com.\nmitted Sin in offering Sacrifices to any\nbut God. 2. That Chriilians fliould have\nnothing to do widi any religious Wor-\nJhip, which does not direfliy and imme-\ndiately relate to God, and to him alone,\nnotwithftanding all the Reafons which\nMen may pretend to the contrary, and\nthe fine Names they will give to thofe\nObjefts which they -worDiip after this\nmanner\nOf the firft CommancU\nmerit of the Lavj.,\n''\nI\n\"^\nH E foregoing Doftrine is taught\ni us by the firft Commandment of\nthe Law ; Thou \/Jjall have nof7e other God^\ncr Gods befort^ cr uPon Viy Face, Two\nthings mould here be taken notice of i.\nI'hat\n\fof spirits. 6^\nThat tlio' there is no other God but\none, and that an Idol is nothing in\nWorld ;\nyet whatfoever Men fee up\nas an Obje\u00a3t of rehgious Worfliip, is\ntermed God in holy Script ure^ becaufe\nit is fubftituted and placed in the room\nofthe true and only God, who ought to\nbe the fole Objefl: ofReligion. 2. The other\nis, that in this Precept God fpeaks to\nMen that own him as God, and pro-\nfefs to worfloip him: lie doth not\nforbid they fhould deny him, that they\niliould go and ferve other Gods ; but\nhe forbids particularly, they fhould\nferve any other in his Prefence, or with\nhim ; thofe that are guilty of the for-\nmer do call: God behind their Backs,\nRor\/^. 14. 9. but they than commie the\nthe latter Crime, do ftill pretend to\nftand in God's Prefence; their Sin is,\nthat they will have other Ob-\njects of their Devotion, before, befides\nand with him, Ezek. 23, Sec. The Terms\nof the Commandment feems to point\nat thofe who place certain Objed's of\ntheir Devotion betwixt God and them-\nfelves, and as before, or upon God's\nFace\n\fA Treatise\nFace, to cover the dreadful Majefiy\nthereof, that they may approach it with\nleis Fear. It may be faid here^ that as un.\nder the Lav\/ the FarCe of God was the\nArk towards v\/hich they worfliip d, was\nthe only Symbole of God's Prefence, and\nas a Means to draw near unto him: and\nthat as under the Law God would not that\nhis People [hould have any other Objeft of\ntheir Devotion, but Hiriifelf, who fpake\nto them out of the Ark, nor contrive\nany other Way of drawing nigh\nto him., nor fancy any other Token of\nhis Pretence with them.- So under the\nGofpel he witl have no Chriftians to ac-\nknowledge none other ObjeQ: of their\nrehmous Services, than the God who\nmanifelted himfelf in Jefus Chrij}^ the\nonly Mediator betwiKt God and Men,\nRor feek after any other Means of ob-\ntainins; his Grace and Favours, than the\nfame ^efus Cbrift, Difobedience to this\nLav\/, is the Error whicii St. Vml pro-\npheficd fiiould prove the great Unhap-\npinefsof the Chriftian Church, when he\nfaith, Ihdt Jome fljall fall av^ay from the\nFahhf g^vi\/j'g up themfelves to feducinc^\nSpirits anii Dccfrines of Demons, Of\n\fof spiritf. 6^\nOf the Words Daemon and\nDevil^ and of the re-\nmarkahle Difference he-\ntm!>ct thofe two Names\n;\nand of Sepulchres and\nRelicks.\nWHY IS it fayM that the Mamd\nof Ddmon is lefs fearful than\nthat of Devil^ feeing that Mr. Ddlle\nobferves, that it is always iifed to fig-\nniff an evil Thing in the Tranflatioa\nof the Septuagints ;and that in the Book\nof the Acts it is ufed otherwife but in\none Place, and that with refpeO: to the\nwrong Judgment which the Heathen\nmade of it? To this will be anfwer'djf\nthat the Word Damon hath always form-\ned in the Mind of Chriftians the Idea\nof an Evil Thing, as reprefenting to\nthem either the ObjeO: of abominable\nI Idolatryj\n\f6^ ^Treatise\nIdolatry, or thofe Evil Spirits that are\nconftantly called by this Name, as Origen\nobferves, Lib. 5. ag. Celfus. It fignifies\nalways the oae or the other of thefe\nThings in the New Teftament, even\nActs 17. 18. In the Tranflation of the\nSeventy, it is ufed fix or feven times\nto the fame Purpofe : we have already\nfeen two Places where it expounds a\nWord fignifying a forbidden Worfhip,\nP\/I 96. 5. It ihews the Signification of\nthe Word Elilimj which we tranflate\nJdols^ and Ifa.^6, 11. to expound the\nWord Gady which we tender the Hofl:\nof Heaven ; in both which Places, men-\ntion is made of falfe Divinities. Be-\nfide thefe, the Seventy likewife ufed\nthe Word Damon^ to explain the Hebrew\nWord Sehhirim, Ija. ijo 21. which we\ntranflate Bugbears^ and it fignifies a kind\nof Wild Beait or Night Bird, apt to^\nfright Folks, and which were to flielter\nthemfelves in the P^^ains of Babjlo^^\nafter it was defl:royM ; and i\/i. 54. 14.\nto expound the Word Tftjmy which figni-\nfies the Wild Beafi:s which were to\nlepair to iliQ.

Chriftians have called Evil\nAngels DamonSj and to the good they\nhave given the Name of Jngels only.\nThofe among the Heathen, who ac-\nknowledged EvWD^mom^ called tliem-\nfelves C^codAtT\/ionas^ and mifchievous An-\ngels ; but with them the Name of D^-\nmon was conftantly an honourable\nName, which they gave to the Noblefl\nDbjecis of their religious Worfhip\n:\nwhenfoever the Scripture makes ufe of\nit to exprefs an Oh]eci of Religion, it\nalways intimates a falfe ObjeQ:, and\nChriftians look upon it with Abhor-\nrence; but the Heathen notv\/ithftanding,\nhave taken this Name, in their Senfe,\nfor the Name of a Thing worthy of\ntheir Veneration, fo that when in\nScripture it fignifies an Objed of A-\ndoration, it is taken in honum fartem^\nfor a Venerable Name, with refpecl\nto the Judgment that the Heathen\nI 2 made\n\f<?8 Lr^ Treatise\nmade of it 5 but it founds ill in the\nEars of Chriftians. It is not only A\"?^\n17. that it is ufed to fignify a good\nThing, but alfo 1 Cor. 10. and it\ncannot be taken in another, Rev. 9.\n20. according to the Notion of the\nrWorfliippers there fpoken of, tho' we\ntranflate it by the Word Devils^ ac-\ncording to our Notion. I fay therefore,\nthat the Word D^moj^ doth reprefent\nto Chriftians none but odious Objefts ;\nyet it could not, at leaft in St, PauPs\nTime, infpire fo great an Horror as that\nof Devils \\ for,obferve in the firft Place,\nthat in the Greek Tongue, then fpoken\nevery where, and underftood by every\nBody, the Word. D.emon fignifies L^^r-\nftedy whereas Devil fignifies a falfe Jc\ntufer. Secondly, none ever imagined\nthat the Word Devil fignified any thing\nthat vi^as good : but the Name D^mon\nwas efteem'd by moft as very Venerable,\nin a conftant Converfatibn among Men ;\nand uring,asthey do, fome Words which\nthey diflike not, lelfens very much\nthe Averfion we might otherwife have\nfor them, tho' u this tim^e we do nop\n; . di-\n\fof Spiritsl 6^\ndiftinguifli them, and we look upon the\nNames of Devils and Damons to be\nSynonymous^ tho' the one comes out eafier\nthan the other : we obferve likewife in\nreading the Holy Scripture, that the\nWord Devil is always without any Ti-\ntle or Adjunft, which can intimate any\ndifference between the Things to which\nthis Name is given 5 but the Name D^-\nmon is fometimes ufed with Diftinflion,\nwhich implies that this Name may be\ngiven as well to good as to Evil Things^\ndiS Luke 4. J 3. The Spirit of an unclean\nD^mon^ or as it is in fome Copies, Kxx\nimpure Damon.\nTwo notable Differences there are h^^\ntwixt thefe two, firfi: that the Holy\nScripture applies the Word Damon both\nin the Singular and in the Plural Num-\nber, to the fame Things : But tho' the\nWord Devih is three times ufed in the\nPlural Number, to fignify fuch Perfons\nas are given to flandeiing, yet never\nbut in the Singular to fignify the\nEvil Spirit : This fbews that the Scrip-\nture \\yill not confound thefe two Names\nas\n\f7b ^A TreaTis\nas we do, and the Things which are\nreprefented by them. The firii Place\nwhere we meet with the Word ^ia^o7.<^^\nDevil, according to the Sepuagmfs\nTranflation, is in the beginning of the\nBook of '^ob^ where we find it tvv^elve\ntimes in two Chapters, and always to\nexpound the 'WovdSatm^ which is the\nName of that wicked Spirit that ilander'd\n\"^oby and would deftroy him. The firil:\nplace in the New Teftament is in St.\nMatthew^ when he tempted our Saviour ?\nSt.-^yLf^e calls the Tempter the Devd-^\nand St. M^rk names him Satan \\ which\nclearly fhews that he who tempted\nChriji^ is the fame that accuied \"^ok The\nfame doubtlefs who defired to fift the\nApoftles as Wheat, who infpirM \"Judas\nto be a Traitor, that filled Ananias\nand SapifhiraVs Heart, this is the\ngreat Draoon, the old Serpent^ called\nthe Dex\/z\/t and Satan the Accufer of\nthe Brethren, the fame that fed need Eve\n:\nthe fame Satan in Hebrew, and Devit\naccording to the Seventy, who with-\nflood the High-Prieft Jehijhuah, and who\nis reprefented contending for the Body\nV of\n\fof spirits] 71\nof MofeSj Jude. 9. from whofe Power\nMen are delivered by the Preaching\nof the Gofpel ; in one Word, who had\nthe Empire of Death, and whom Chriji\nhath overcome by his Death.

I aiitrm\ntherefore, that the Torments from which\nour Saviour delivered Men, were the\nEfFc^s of bodily Difeafes,or Diftradions\nof Spirit, and wherein the Devil afts\nhone otherwife than he did in thofe\ngrievous Difterhpers wherewith ^oh was\naffliSed. This further appears hy what\nour Saviour faith, Luke i}\u201e i6, eoncern-\ning the Woman that had the Spirit of\nInfirmity, which kept her bow'd down\neighteen Years. It was doubtlefs a\nbodily Diftemper^ proceeding from na-\ntural Caufes ; for our Saviour in curing\nher faid no more than this, Thou art\nloofed from thine Infirmity ;\nyet he faith\nlikevvife, that Satan had kept her bound\neighteen Tears : So that if any evil Spirit\nhad a Hand in thefe, k was but oney\n^iz.

But the Truth is, that this\npoor Man was troubled with a fore Di-\nftemper ; and the Hogs, by God's Pro-\nvidence, might be ftruck with the fame-^\nor with fome other, more natural and\npecuhar to them : And it is no more\nincredible that the Diftemper of this\nMadman fhould pafs into the Hogs^\nthan that NaamarPs Leprofy did ftick\nto Gehazf.\nBut this Story of the Gofpel is too^\nremarkable to be difmifs'd without far*\nther\n\f^^^cf spirits. 107\n;%er Reflexion.

As St. Miirk is moft exaft in re-\nlating this Cafe, let us take notice of\nhis Words concerning this Madman ;\n\fio8 A Trea'Iise\nind our bleffed Saviour tells us^\nthat feeing Jefm Chriji afar off, he ra^\nmd Worjhipved him ; tliat in the Greek\nDialeft, ahd he fell down before him\nto the Ground, ^s ^ Token of great\nHumility, a thing common enough to\n'tliat fort of People, when they meet\nwith great or learned Men, or Men in\nAuthority. That if ourSaviour faid imme-\ndiately, Thou unclean Spirit get out of this\nMans it was an A\u00a3t of his Wifdom tof.\n^ive into the Madman's Sence, to com^'\nply with his Imagina.tion, viz. to cure\nliini ; he complies with his Imagination!\nthat there was fome great Thing which\ntroubled him, either from within, or\nfrpi0 without, for fuch is the ftrong PrcM\njudice of fome of them, that the more\nyou crofs or contradi(ft them, the worfe\nthey ^rie, and prove the more incuraNi\nble. It may be faid alfo, that the Lord:\nproceeded in this manner, to manifeft\nhis Power and Authority in command-\ning the UiicleanSpirits, and making them\nobedientto his Word ^ ^bhe otherwife\nthan if he had faid, Thou foul Difeafe\n^r unlucky Iiffiniiity,; I egpimand thee\n^>'\" -'''\n. - .* ta\n\fif spirits^ 10^\nto depart from this Man, and afBift\nhim no more; or as he faid to the ficfc\nof the Palfey, Stmd uf md vpdky and {o\nin this Place; Be thou healed of thin#\nInfirmity^ and delivei'd of thy tormwt**\nIng Pain;\n3.

This hatli\nbeen fufficiently expl^in'd : But it (hould\nbe obferved that whenMen have once pet\na thing in their Heads, asweeommonly\nfpeak, they fancy that all they fee or\nhear agreeth thereunto. The Author\nof tiiQ World BemtccVd^ tells Us of a\nWoman of Fr\/?;^^\/&^r in the Low Goun-\ntries, who believ'd herfelf to be irre-\ncoverably damned, and did not fpeak\nat all^ becaufe file imagined that tlie\ndamned did fpeak. The fame muft be\nfaid 6f the Man's Anfwer, My Name h\nLegion^ for rve are many.

And\nthis\n\fno y^ Treatise:\nthis proves, that it was the Man him-\nfelf who fpoke, and not the Spirits with-\nin him; for our Saviour did not ask.What\nare your Names ; hut what is thy Name ?\nin the Angular Number : and fqch was\nthe Anfwer, Not our Names, hut my\nName is Legion \\ but it will be objefted\nthat it is faid, v. 15.

They that relate a Story, as^\nthe Evangelifts do this, relate Things*\nas they appear outwardly, without en-\nquiring into the Caufes; we do the fame\nevery Day, when we meet with fuch\nHypocoftdriack Fancies, as to have fuch -a\nliving Thing within him as a Snake\nera Wolf.

A fubtil Way of Reafoning\nindeed ! which fuppofes that God may\npermit the Devil to be God, for he\ninuft be no lefs, and Almighty Crea-\ntor Ukewife, if he doth all thofe Things\nthat he is faid to do. And who can ima-\nEine that Satan being a vile and wicked\nCreature, fallen from God, and his grea-\nieft Enemy, fhould be permitted to\ndo more and greater Things than\never he fufferM to be done by his beft\nServants? But this ftands for nothing,\nthey will go on and difpute ftill: For\nthey fay, That God premits the Devil\nto work Miracles, tho' it be to conform\na falfe DoQrine ^nd feduce Men.

Mofes fup-\npofes that a Sign or a Wonder may hap-\npen, which is defign'd only to tare a-\nway Men from the Worihip of the\ntrue God. But in all this, no mention\nis made of the Devil ; and furely the\nWickednefs of Man is fiiiBcient to make\nhim fall into Idolatry, yea and to draw\nothers after him and feduee them by\npretended Signs and Miracles, Every\none is willing to make Profelytes, and\nzealous to bring ovar others to their O-\n% pinion*\n\f144 ^Treatise\npinion. Idolatrous Popery did conftanly\nproduce fuch Miracles to the famepur-\npofe : The Prophets fpaken of by Mofef\nYreve falfe Prophets, and Dreamers of\nDreams, pretended to have feen and\nheard, and their Miracles were the fame\npretended and falfe Miracles; and if\nany thing was done, yet nothing above\nNature, tho' the Beholders comprehend-\ned it not.\n'\n2. I reckon this among inexcufable\nAbfurdities, that Conjurers, Witches, or\nthe Devil himfelf can do all that God\npermits them to do. Can Men in their\nSenfes conclude, that a mere PermiCfion\ncan enable for A\u00a3tion ? Chrift permitted\nSt. Peter to walk upon . the Sea, but\nenabled him not to do it ;as he did to heal\nthe impotent Man at the beautiful Gate\nof the Temple. I ask therefore, whether\nk was fimpie Permiffion that made B\/^.\nUam'^s Afs to fpeak, and the Iron to\nfwim ? Permiffion alone will never pro-\nduce Things above Nature, nor work\nMiracles. And if Satan and his Imps do\nif what\n\f.f\\, ,of spirits. 14C\nwhat is beyond their Nature, they muii\ntiave the Power and Strength given then!\nto do ic\/and that from God ;\nand fo God\nIS the Doer of what is done : That if\nthe Devil doth of himfelf what Men fay-\nhe doth above his JSfature, he muft be\nowh'd to do greater. Things than Goci\never did: Yet 5^ oh Horror! there is\nnothing more common than Chriftians\nyea Proteftants, to impute to S^taa the\nivorking the fame Things or more: As\nfor Example 5 was God the Ruler and\nCommander of the Air, when hecaufed\nThunder, Fire and Hail in the Land of\nEgyft^ 1^-hQ DeviLis thought to have\nhad the fame Ppwei;^ -when .the Houfes\nof '^obh Children \\ were overthrown,;\nand now,! that he hath whole Kations\nof Laplmdtrs ^nA finlanders^ who are a-\nble to raife, turn, and fell the Wind,\nand, by; untying; a 'Knot made in the\nCorner of a Handkerchief, raife a Storm,\nand lay it again. And is it not now a\ncommon Saying, when confiderable Mif-\nchief is done by a Storm, that feme\nBod^ is conjuring.

Thefe\nare but few of innumerable Inftances\nthat may be produc'd, to prove that\nMen do allow the Devil a Power and\nOperations above Nature ; and if that\nis true, then he is a God. Every Crea-\nture is confined by God himfelf to^the\nProperties of it$ own Nature, and fp\nare the AGtions proceeding from thefe\nProperties; So that we muft fay that\nwhen a Creature a\u00a3bs contrary to:,\nor above its Nature, it is God's own\nAft, either by his own immediate O-\nperation, as when St. Peter cured the\nimpotent Man with pne Word fpeaking,\nas he faid to the People, r^'hy do you lock\non usJ\nAS if by our oven Power rve had made\nthis Man to walk? or by giving extra-\nordinary Abilities to the Means, beyond\ntheir Nature, as after the troubling of\nthe Water o^BetheJda ^ and to theWaters\nof Jordan, to cure the Leprojjo As for\nmy part, I will never enquire what the\nDevil can do, when I fee any thing done^\nthat is above Nature ; for then I arri\n|arehe cannot be the Doer of it : ye\u20ac\n\f148 A TRI^T ISE\nnot only old Women and Idiots among\nthe Vulgar, but even learned and emi-\nnent Men will afBrni the fame^ and ^\ngreat deal more inconfiftent, not only\nwith the Principles of Chriftian Reli-r\ngion, But alfo contradiftory to the\nTruth of the Creation, which hath fet;\nfuch Bounds to all Creatures which\nthey cannot pafs ; not only without\nGod's Permiflion, but alfo without his\ngiving theni Fo'wer and Strength, be-\nyond what he firft imprinted m their\nNature ; and therefore what is faid of\nSpirits afling corporally upon Bodies,\nor of Bodies afting as Spirits, muft ei-\nther be falfe, or the Work of him^ who\nis the Author of Nature, and is able\nto alter it when, and as he plcafeth : So\nthe Opinion of any Creature having g^\nPower of working Things above its\nNature, cannot b^ maintained to the\nGlory of Qod,\n5. I fay again, that the commonly\nTeceiv'd Ppinioa is a great fturnbling\nBlock\n\fof spirits. 14P\nBlock unto Man, even in the Way of\nhis Salvation : For, firft of all, it fur-\nnifhes the Atheift with an unanfwerable\nArgument againft the Truth of our Ho-\nly Religion ; for we pretend this to be\nundeniably eftablilh'd by it, that the\nWriters of the Bible did thofe Things^\nwhich were infipoflible to be done with-\nout the Finger of God : This was the\nCafe of the Law, Deut. 4. 42. God hath\ntaken to himfelf a.

But if what is conceived of th^\nDevil tzkQs Place, Conjurers and Witch*\nes go beyond Mofes and the Prophets,\nand Chrtjl himfelf; for the Devil daily\nfets forth Prophecies, and doth Won*\nders beyond Vrim and Thummim.

I can do nothing of ^yfe^f' BewarQ\nniaking Comparifons, which this new\nreceiv'd Opinion is But too apt to do,\nto the great Scandal and Prejudice of\nthe Chriftian Religion 3 and hinders Mer|\nfrom knowing and ferving God as they\n9Ught to do. St. James tells US, That if\nany lacketh Wifdom^ he mufi beg it of God^ _\nwho alone is able to give it. But thi$\nppinion tells us, that Satany out of his\n- sr\u20ac:ai\n\fhf Sprntl i^i\ngreat Capacity, and long Experience^'\ncan reveal all Things to Men. The Prtf-\npher Jmos puts this Queftion, Is rherp\nany Evil m the Citj^ and the Lord hath ndt\ndone it ? JBat what anfwers this Conceit,\nAll Evil i^ frdm the Devil. If wfe^ftfe\naflaulted with any fad or troublefom^\nThoughts, 6'r feel in our Confciences\nfome Checks or Difturbances for thfe\nEvil that we have done, we complain\nthat we are purfued by 'an evil Spirit.\nAnd do we difcourfe of another World,\nwe hear of nothing oftner than the\nDeviPs dragging and hauling Souls in-\nto He-\/\/ : So that however we are taught\nto honour and love God, we are alfo in-\nftrufled to fear the DeviI,contrary to the\nScripture, which informs us, that Godj\nand he done^ is to be fear d\\ and that it iS\na fearful Thing to fall into the Hand^\nof the Living God ; not of a Devil itt\nChains.\nAnd will not our pure and Holy Re-\nligion fuffer much, by thus making\nGod the Author of thefe Errors and\nCheats^\n\fi^z ^Treatise\nCheats, which are fet on work to fe-\n^uce Men ; for the Devil hath no Share\nin Omnipotencev and God muft be the\nJDoer of all thofe Things that exceed\nNature, and yet are made tJfe of to\nturn away Men from God, to look up-\non Satan as the Engineer ofthefe furpri-f\n'Zing Things. Let our Hearts abhor fuch\nConceits, for they will keep us from the\nright Sentiments we fhouldjiave of the\nDivinity, and^ by Confequence, make\nus incapable of rendering to our God\nthat Honour, Reverence, and Service^\nwhich are due to him.
