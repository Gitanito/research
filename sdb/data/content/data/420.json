Sidgwick.\nThe Chairman, before calling on Professor Barrett to read his\npaper, \"On some Physical Phenomena commonly called 'Spiritualistic'\nwitnessed by the author,\" thought it desirable to state that the\npaper was intended to initiate a discussion which might be continued\nat future meetings; and in which it was hoped that the evidence\na.lready accumulated on this branch of the Society's inquiry, might\nreceive full consideration.\nAs the commencement of this discussion was to a. certain extent II.\nnew departure, he might perhaps offer 0. few words of explanation to\ntiliow why this new departure was taken now, a.nd also why it was not\ntaken before. It would be remembered that the Society was originally\nformed by a. combination of two elements occupying distinct positions\non this subject,-those whom he might call broadly believers in the\nphenomena of \"Spiritualism,\" and those who merely thought that the\nevidence for these phenomena was, in quantity and quality, BUch as to\ndeserve serious and systematic investigation. These two portions of\nthe Society, disagreeing as theydid as to the exact weight of the evidence\nDigitized by Google\n\fllarcJa, l886.] Journal fit &Ciet!1 for P'JlMical Re,earcA. 219\nalready collected, were thoroughly agreed on what then seemed the most\nimportant point, viz., the desirability of further experiment.\nAt the outset of the Society's work it seemed in the interests of\nharmony desirable to prosecute the new investigation in which both\nparties were prepared to co-operate, rather than to raise discussion-\nwhich, from the delicate natura of the arguments that must inevit-\nably be introduced, was liable to become acrimonious-on the\nquestion on which the two parties were disa.greed. Accordingly, a\nCommittee \\\\\"&8 formed for experimental investigation of the physical\nphenomena of Spiritualism. Experiments were made both by the\nCommittee and by private individuals belonging to the more sceptical\nelement of the Society outside the Committee. Unfortunately, these\nexperiments have so far led to no positive result. The Committee\nexpired without seeing their.way to present a report, and-speaking as\nODe member of the sceptical party-he was obliged to say that he had\nnot advanced beyond the position he occupied when the Society was\nfounded, viz., that of holding that there was a prim.a \/atM case for\n&erious investigation.\nIn the meantime he thought that, in the period that had elapsed\n.moe the Society's foundation, it had acquired a tolerably established\nposition, and that, consequently, the dangers involved in a public\ndiscussion between its two somewhat heterogeneous elements were by\nDO means so great now &8 they would have been four years ago. It\nappeared also that a prolonged exclusion of this subject from the\npublished records of the Society's work would be liable to be misunder-\nstood, and would probably be attributed to a disinclination to face\nuupala~ble facts, or to a desire to avoid the expression of unpopular\nopinion. He therefore had much pleasuro in calling on Professor\nBarrett to read his paper.\nProfessor Barrett began by pointing eut that whether Spiritualism\nwere regarded as worthy or unworthy of serious inquiry depended\ncbiefly upon the place where each person drew the boundary line that,\nin his own mind, divided the possible from the impossible. It would\nbe folly to waste time upon such things &8 circle-squaring, or a search\nfor perpetual motion. These are placed beyond the pale of\ninvestigation, from already existing knowledge. But there a.re other\nthingswhich involve no contradictionof whatis a.lready well established,\nbut only an enlargement of our knowledge in certain directions; e.g.,\nthe aea-serpent, thought-transference, clairvoyance, the phenomena of\nSpiritualism, and only a few years ago we should bave said the\ntelephone and the phonograph. There were some wbo regarded\nII Spiritualism\" as so intrinsically impossible that its investigation\n_hould not ba.ve formed one of the objects of the Society, while others\nthought it should have been in the forefront of the Society's programme.\no 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f220 Journal 01 Societ!llor Psychical ResearCh. [March. 18S6.\nProfessor Barrett regretted that no report ho.d been published by\nthe Committee originally organised to investigate the subject, although\nthis omission no doubt arose from their being unable to obtain any\nconclusive evidence. A record of the conditions a.nd results of experi-\nments WI\\S desirable. The instruments necessary for the inquiry into\nSpiritualism were living beings, and comparatively few in number, and\nif, after an o.dequate examination, no phenomena new to science should\nbe exhibited, we should publish the negative evidence, and pass on to\nmore profitable fields of inquiry. But such an o.dequo.te examination\nbad not yet been made. The real difficulty was in arriving at ccmclu-\n6ive evidence pointing one way or the other. Non-professional mediums\nwere difficult of access, and professional mediums were opea to the\ncharge of being conjurers. Nevertheless, he thought that teats might\nbe employed which would exclude the hypothesis of conjuring, and that\nthe difficulty of arriving at conclusive evidence ho.d been exaggerated.\nIn this connection he referred to the evidence of the late Professor de\nMorgan, and Professor Zollner, and also that of Mr. Crookes, and stated\nhis own conviction that at any rate some of the simpler phenomena of\nSpiritualism were inexplicable by any causes at present recognised by\nscience. He then proceeded to refer to phenomena witnessed by him-\nself. Mostof these were of no evidential value in favour of Spiritualism.\nBut four or five cases stood out as exceptions; they occurred in the years\n1875 and 1876, and full notes of each were taken at the time.\nIn the first two cases the sittings were with private mediums; in\nthe last case the sitting was with 0. professional medium.\nIn the first case he would describe he had every opportunity of\nclose and frequent investigation, and he had the records of numerous\nsittings extending through the months of August and September, 18i5.\nAt one sitting there were present besides himself, Mr. and Mrs. C.\nand their young daughter F.-the medium-ft. bright, frank, and intel-\nligent child, then about ten years old. Time, 10 l1.m. They sat at a\nlarge dining-room table facing the French windows, which let in a flood\nof sunlight, so that the sitters' feet as well as hands could be perfectly\nseen. Shortly, a sort of scraping sound was heard on the surface of the\ntable; the sound moved about, but was loudest when near the medium,\nF. Raps were also heard sometimes on the table, sometimes on the\nback of the chairs on which they sat. F.'s hands and feet were closely\nwatChed; they were absolutely motionless when the sounds were heanL\nAfter 0. few sittings the sounds grew in loudness, often being as loud\nas, and very much resembling, the hammering of nails into a floor.\nThey came more readily and more loudly when music was played, or a\nmerry song struck up, and invariably they kept time with the music.\nSometimes a loud rhythmic scraping, as of a violoncello bow on a piece\nof wood, would accompany the music. Again and again he placed his\ngitized by (.oogI\n\fKarch, 1886.) Journal of 80cietU lor PS!lcllical Research. 221\near on the very spot on the table whence this rough fiddling appeared\nto proceed, and felt distinctly the rhythmic vibration of the table, but\nno tangible cause was visible either above or below the table. Experi-\nm!!nta were made on the possibility of localising sollnds such 1109 were\nheard; and so far as his experiments went he fOlllld that he could tell,\nwithin six inches, the position on a large table, when a knock W&ll made\nby a friend beneath the table, and out of sight. The ability to loca.liae\na sound depended very much on the nature of the sOllnd; the sounds\nmade by a. siren or by a singing flame were extremely difficult to localise.\nBut he felt pretty confident that the knocks and scraping sounds pro-\nceeded from a source certainly within a foot of the position a.ssigned;\nand he noticed particularly that the sounds, though feebler tha.n when\nnear, were sometimes heard ten or twelve feet away from the medium.\nOn one occasion, when no one else was in the room, and it W&ll broad\ndaylight as usual, he &liked the medium to put her hands against the\nwall and see how far she could stretch her feet back from the wall\nwithout tumbling down. This she did, and whilst she W&II in this\nconstrained position, he &liked for the knocks to come. Immediately a.\nbrisk pattering of raps followed, the child remaining quite motionless\nthe whole time. Professor Barrett ga.ve further details concerning the\nsollnds occurring in connection with F., mentioning that on one occasion\na word was misapelt by raps exactly as the child misapelt that word, as\nhe afterwards ascertained; but that a long and careful examination\nconvinced him that trickery on the part of the child W&ll a more im-\nprobable hypothesis than that the sounds proceeded from an unknown\nagency. After some three months, the sounds disappeared &II unex-\npecte<lly as they had arisen. In reviewing the evidence, Professor\nBarrett said that we must take into account the \u00b7hypothesis that some\nchildren exhibit an amazing passion for deceiving their elders, and some\npossess an extraordinary love of notoriety, but he confessed that in this\ncase he could come to no other conclusion than that we had there a\nclass of phenomena wholly new to science.\nHe then gave some of the details of phenomena occurring in con-\nnection with a middle-a.ged lady in priva.te life, who had found this\nabnormal \"mediumistic\" power gradually develop in her presence,\nand he said that in this co.se also he could not avoid the conclusion\nthat the phenomena described were inexplicable by any known\nhypothesis. He considered this case, however, to be of less evidential\nvalue than the previous one, where his opportunities 'were greater for\ntesting the phenomena under varying conditions.\nThe third case described by Professor Barrett was, he said, exactly\nof the sort he would wish to ha.ve a. conjurer's opinion upon before\naffirming that it could not\u00b7be produced by trickery. The sitting\nhe would describe W&ll with the professional medium, Mr. Eglinton.\nDiQitizedbyGoogle ~\n\f222 Journal fl.'Soc\"ctg for P81\/clu'cal Be_rch. [Haroh, 1881.\nOn January 5th, 1878, Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood arranged for a\nsitting at his own house at Queen Anne-street. The observers present,\nbesides Professor Barrett, were Mr. Wedgwood. his sister, 'Mr. A. R.\nWallace, and Mr. F. W. H. Myers. The seance was h\"ld in Mr.\nWedgwood's library at 4 p.m. When the medium arrived, Professor\nBarrett was permitted to take whatever precautions he thought\nnecessary to prevent fraud on his part. Professor Barrett then\ndescribed the fastenings to which he submitted the medium, so that,\nalthough the medium (who was placed sitting on a chair in the corner\nof the room, with his hands together behind him) could, if he chose,\nmove his legs freely and also tum or nod his head, he could not move\nthe trunk of h~1I body nor his hands nor arms without breaking the\nfo.stenings. A couple of small curtains, running on a rail over the\nmedium's head, were then drawn nearly together in front of the\nmedium, leaving a space of from four to six inches exactly opposite the\ncentral line of his body. Through this space his face and front of his\nbody could be seen. The curtains hung down on each side of the\nchair on which the medium sat, so that his legs, from the waist down-\nward were entirely in front of the curtain. A gas jet, which was\nthe principal light in the room (the window curtains having been\ndrawn), was then lowered, but there was plenty of light to allow of\nthe observers' seeing one another. They seated themselves\nclose to the medium, Professor Barrett being so close that Dot\na foot inten-ened between himself and the medium. Professor Barrett\ncould see that the medium's hea.cl presently drooped, and that he\nwent into a sort of trance, whether real or assumed Professor Barrett.\ncould not say. Knockings were then heard, and upon repeating the\nalphabet slowly a message was spelt out. Professor Barrett asked.\n\" Oan you move anything in the room t\" It said by knocks it would\ntry, but nothing was moved. Either one of the observers or else the\nknocks suggested putting some objects near the medium. Professor\nBarrett got up and took out three or four books at random, and placed\nthem in a pile on the lap of the medium, alld catching sight of a BDlall\nhandbell, added this on the top of all Upon seating himself by the\nmedium's side, he noticed there WAS enough light in the room to read\nthe time by his watch true to a second. In a few minutes after this,\nwhilst closely watching the motionless figure of the medium, he\ndistinctly saw the upper half of\u00b7,the pilo of books move, the cover of\nthe middle book opening, and allowing the Olles above it and the bell\nto incline to an angle of at least 45\", which he subsequently found was\nconsiderably beyond the angle of repose for the bell on a cloth-bound\nbook. The bell did not fall oft', did not stir, in fact, in the least\nrelatively to the cover of the book; the leaves of the book were then\ndropped after one another, and then opened up again. Then the lower\nDigitized by Google\n\fJlarcb, 1886.J Journal qf Societylor P'!Jclaical ResearclJ. 223\nbook opened, and its leaves were deliberately let fall. The whole\nproceeding was exactly such as would occur if two hands were placed\non each side of the volumes, and thei!\u00b7 leaves slowly run over by first\nlifting up the body of the book, and then allowing the leaves to drop\npast, the fingers rubbing against them as they fell. During this process\na third hand would seem to be required to keep the bell in its place.\nHe brought his eyes to within 12 inches of the books whilst they were\nmoving, and certainly no human hands were there. Professor Barrett\ngave other details, and stated that at the end of the sitting tho medium\nwas found fast asleep, and the fastenings intact. He then discussed\nthe hypotheses of hallucination and fraud, and said that if the medium\nwas the operator he could not conjecture how the performance was\naccomplished. The most plausible explanation, he thought, was mis-\ndescription on his part, a clever bit of juggling in moving books being\nmistaken for a larger movement, and ultimately exaggerated into the\neffect described. But he had quoted from his notes taken at the time,\nand was not conscious of any exaggeration. Nor did he think it\nlegitimate to apply this exaggeration hypothesis to each case as it arose,\nand so dispose of an army of observers in detail. When the first\nobservers of a slowly-moving electric fireball recounted what they had\nseen, they were naturally suspected of exaggerdion, or as the victims\nof some illusion. But as concordant testimony from other independent\nobservers came in, disbelief had been given up, and electric firebo.1ls\nwere now accepted as an enigmatic freak of that inexplicable agency\nelectricity. Similarly, physical phenomena., such as he had described,\nmight be regarded as unaccountable freaks of that mysterious agency\nwe called mind.\nHe thought there was enough evidence from trustworthy inde-\npendent observers, to outweigh the antecedent improbability of the\nalleged facts, and e,\u00b7en to establish a strong presumption in their\nfavour, and was of opinion that the most hopeful advance on the\nsubject would be made by daring hypotheses based upon the study of\nexisting evidence. We must clear the ground first by the theories of\nimposture, unconscious muscular action, hallucination, exaggeration,\nand telepathic action, but these hypotheses did not, in his opinion,\nexhaust all the evidence that exists. Nothing that he had seen or read\nhad given him any adequate proof of extra-human intelligence, but he\nhad been led to conjecture that under conditions which are so restricted\nthat we are not put to intellectual confusion by frequent interruptions\nof the ordinary course of material la.ws, mind could ace upon 1IUJUer\ndirectly. Upon the organised matter of the brain, mind could and did\nact, i.e., if we admitted mind apart from matter. He then referred\nto conditions of success in experimenters, and urged that sympathy, or\nat any rate the absence of mental antagonism, might possibly be one\ngitized by (.oogI\n\f224 Journal qf BoNtN\/or P'!lcllical &lIMrch. [Marcb.l8IIIL\nof these conditions, and just as neceaaary in the psychological world\nas certain material conditions in the physical world. This sympathy\nwas quite compatible with calm judgment and a clear and accurate\nobservation. Illustrating these remarks by an analogy, he then said\nthat it was because all theories on thi. subject were 10 unrelated to our\nexisting knowledge of the physical world that the psychological\nproblems before us received such scant recognition at the hands of\nscientific men; but he had good hope that \"Spiritualistic phenomena \"\nwould eventually be accepted as an integral part of the dual world of\nmatter and mind in which we live, and that a reverent, hopeful, &lid\nwithal more humble attitude would prevail towards the infinite\npossibilities that are in each of us.\nAs no one offered any remarks upon Professor Barrett's paper, the\nChairman called upon Mr. F. W. H. Myers, who desired to make &\ncommunication upon a cognate subject.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers made lOme remarks, of which the following\nis a modified abstract :-1 have been asked to reply to a question which\nhas been sent to the editor of the Journal, namely, whether we ll&ve\nas yet obtained satisfactory evidence of the communication through\nplanchette of facts unknown to any of the sitters. Since the publication\nof a paper in Proceeding. VIII. (May, 1885), I have received about a\ndozen cases more or less valuable, and the editor of LigTII. haa published\nlOme cases, and informs me that he has received lOme others yet unpub-\nlished. I have also several other cases still in view. I have not as yetgot\nenough evidence to justify a positive assertion that unknown facts are\ngiven through planchette, except, perhaps, as regards one special kind of\ninformation, nn.mely, the details ofobjects present in the room, but unseen\nby the sitters. Professor-Barrett's paper has contained lOme similar cases,\nwhere raps formed the medium of information instead of writing. But if\n:we accept the phenomenon, we ought surely first to consider whether the\nnarrowly-defined knowledge thus communicated may not be gained by\nunconscious clainooyance on the part of the sitters.\nAgain, I have good evidence of the production of handwriting re-\nsembling that of deceased persons-a better imitation than the writer\ncan normally produce. It is, however, quite in accordance with analogy\nto suppose that our unconscious selves may be more skilful in mimicry\nthan our conscious selves. This is the case with the subjects of\nhypnotic suggestion of \\'8.rious kinds; and M. Richet has lately made\nsome. interesting experiments (which I have repeated on a subject of my\nown) on the handwriting of a hypnotised person when told that he is\nNapoleon\" or a young child, kc. The results present a pretty close\nparallel to my planchette eases; and I think that we must not take\nthe reproduction of known handwritings as a proof of anything beyond\nlOme supernormality in the writer's state.\nDigitized by Google\n\flhreb, l8II6.] Journal qf 8oc~tu for P'gclli\u00abll &wire\". 225\nI earnestly wish that the example of diligence and care set by Mr.\nand Mrs. Newnham in the persistent continuance and immediate record\nof these planchette experiments might induce other persons to do the\nlike. Here is a form of experiment which lies within the power of many\npeople, and which may in anyone'. handa lead to moat valuable results\nIt has been practised, more or leas, for thirty years or so j yet what\npublished records have we of any prolonged trials except \"M.A. (Oxon)'s'\u00b7\nand Mr. Newnha.m's1 We have some good accounts of single sittings,\nbut of course one desires that anyone obtaining success in one sitting\nmould keep a record extending over weeks or months, so as to repeat\nthat success, if possible, and to exclude the possibility of chance. I\nwould venture to ask those who are convinced that these writings do\ncome from extraneous intelligences to make a far more persistent and\ncareful effort to prove this than anyone except\" M.A. (Oxon)\" has yet\n&iven to the world.\nThe moat remarkable fact, perhaps, bearing on automatic writing,\nwhich has c~me to light since I last reported to you on the subject,\nconsistsof certain details in the later life-history of LouisV--:-, the man\nof many personalities, of whom I have repeatedly spoken. An account\nof his present state, by Dr. Myers, will be found in the Journal qf\nJlffllal8cienu for January, and no doubt our Society will conc~rn itself\nfurther with some of the phenomena involved. For the present I will\ntake one point alone. Louis V-- is now in the asylum at La Rochelle,\nand has six personalities. I speak here only of the trallSition from\nState L to State II. In what is now classed as State I. (though it was\nnot the patient's earliest condition), he is pa.ralysed and insensible on\nthe right side. He is talkative, violent, and arrogant. His language is\ncoarse, and he addresses everyone with gross and impudent familiarity,\n. giving nicknames, and making bad jokes. He is a Radical in politics,\nand an atheist in religion. He is extremely fond of holding forth on\nthese topics, but his speech is indistinct and defective. Of his past life\nhe remembers only certain portions, more or less akin to his present\natate. Among the six states this is the only one in which there is\nright hemiplegia; and it is also the only one in which the character\nis violent and bad. Whenever -the left brain dominates, Louis V--'s\ndisposition is good, though there are many variations in hia intelli.\ngence and his memory, linked with variations in his motor and sensory\nsystems.\nNow let a bar of steel be placed on his right arm. His respiration\nbecomes quick, his expression anxious; in about a minute the paralysis\nand the aOleSthesia are transferred from the right side to the left. At\nthe same time the difficulty of speech disappears, and the patient's pro-\nIlunciation becomes easy and clear. TllUS far, though the case is\nremarkahle, it is not quit:e unique. But now comes the unique point.\nDigitized by Google\n\f226 JOfJrnol qf Society\/or Pagc\"icalReaearc\/I. [Marcb, 1886.\nTogether with the sensory and motor changes there is a change in\nmemory and a change in character. He is now gentle, well-mannered.\nand modest. He speaks respectfully to the physicians whom a couple\nof minutes before he has been calling by abusive nicknaInes. Asked\nhis opinion on politios or religion, he prefers to leave those matters to\nwiser heads tlw.n his own. He is obedient to discipline, and his ex-\npression of countenance is gentle and sympathetic. His memory\nembraces part of his stay at Sainte Anne, and at Bicetre, at which\nlatter asylum he imagines himself still to be.\nAnd now for the connection of this case with our present subject.\nIt will be remembered that Mr. Newnlw.m, puzzled to account for the\nfreakish and non-moral charo.cter of some of the replies written by\nMrs. Newnham's hand, suggested, as a possible hypothesis,\" that \"if the\n\u2022\nuntrained side of the brain be suddenly stimulated to action, ita\nbehaviour is apt to resemble that of a child whose education has not\nbeen properly attended to.\" In commenting on this and other cases, I\nendeavoured to show that there was reason to suppose that the riglal,\nor less-used, hemisphere was concerned in supernormal mentation; and\nI traced especially analogies between aphasia and cerebral automatismj\nthe inference being tlw.t in each case work was thrown on dextro-\ncerebral centres which was habitually performed by sinistro-cerebral\nI summed up (p. 60) by saying that \"although I hold that the right\nhemisphere had much to do with Mrs. Newnham's replies, \u2022 \u2022 . I\ncannot find any well-recognised doctrine of cerebral loca.lisation which\nauthorises us to draw any conclusion as to the way in which &\ntemporary predominance of dextrcH:erebral centres might affect the\nmanifestation of moral character; \u2022 \u2022 and I should of course be\nunwilling in such a matter to go a step beyond the consensus of the\nbest scientific opinion. So far as the questions at issue are purely\nphysiological, I can aim at nothing more than attentive study of the\nlabours of others.\" I do not regret the caution of the tone here used.\nFor I hold it eminently important tbat we who are thus speculating in\na novel realm should not improvise a fancy physiology to suit our own\nideas-that we should cite chapter and verse for any physiological fact\nor theory on which we base further deductions. But now I find that\nthe suggestion which I hesitated to accept in full, although all my own\narguments pointed directly that way, simply for la.;:k of a recorded\ncue where right hemiplegia had inIVolved a moral tone different from\nthat involved in left hemiplegia in the same subject,-I find, I say,\nthis very suggestion of the moral difference of the two hemispheres\nput forth and endorsed by physicians of eminence, apropol of a\n\u2022 PI'OCeedi'tgl, Vol. III., p. 22-\nDigitized by Google\n\fMarch, 1886.) Journal of Society for P8!Jcllical &I\/cnrch. 227\ncase* on which no theory of the kind hod been foundtld at the time when\nmypaper was written. Corroborativeillstances, of course, are stilIneeded,\nfor the coarse organic injuries of the brain which are most commonly met\nwith do not show themselves in nuances of character.\nBut it is to be observed that the most crucial test which could\nhave been devised for the theory in question would have been one\nwhere (as in Louis V--'s casc) the functions of the two hemispheres\nwere subject to so profound a disassociation that there was actually a\n~xclusive alternation of memories according as one or the other hemi-\nsphere assumed the predominance. Suppose that in an ordina.ry case\nof hysterical hemiplegia the hemiplegia is transferred by metallic\nCOlltact, suggestion, or otherwise, from the right side to the left.\nSuppose, further, that the patient exhibits more irritability, &c., when\nparalysed on the right than on the left side. Such a case would hardly\nafford a presumption that the highest ideational and emotional centres\nwere directly affected by the transfer of the paralysis; the change in\ntemper might merely depend on the greater or less malaise caused by\nsome change in the affection of lower centres; for, of course, we can-\nnot assume that 0. hysterical hemiplegia, whose external signs may be\nsymmetrical whether it affects the right or left side, is in reality\nsymmetrical in its interna.l or subjective manifestation.\nBut in Louis V--'s case the character, as it were, startsIresl, with\nthe transfer of the hemiplegia.; it can exhibit itself untrammelled by a.ny\ncontinuity of memory with the previous state; we can judge it de\nfW!1O, and, so to say, from top to bottom. And we find that the pre-\ndominance of the righthemisphere comports a marked reversionto savage\ncharacteristics, a marked emotional explosiveness and ideational crudity.\nLet us see how this view coheres with what we already know of the\ndifference between the two hemispheres. We start, of course, from the\nnotorious fact that our right hands are more .. dexterous\" than our left;\nthat is, that the sinistro-cerebral hand-governing centres are superior\nin development to the dextro-cerebral hand-governing centres. There\nhas been som~ controversy as to how far this is the result of education\nin the individual, or how far it depends on some asymmetry of the\ncirculatory system. I cannot, of course, give any opinion as to the\noriginal anatomical reason for the selection of the right as the dominant\nhand, but I can hardly doubt that the superiority in the sinistro-\ncerebral centres concerned is now & hereditary thing,-does not depend\nmerely on the education of the individual child.\n\u2022 M. Jules Voisin writes in the A rcliives de N ~Itrologie, September, 1885. The\nopinion of MM. Bourrn and Burot is given (with complete adhesion)by Dr. Ber-\njon in his tractate .. LaGrande Hy.Une chez l'Homme \"(Paris: Uailliere, 1886),\npage 53. I need hardly say that the transfer of activity between the two hemi\u00b7\nIIplieres is alm08tcertainly not the only alteration of cerebral action which occura\nin these changes of state.

[March, l886.\nGoing one step higher, it is now pretty generally admitted toot the\nl!Iinistro-cerebral speech-centres are more evolved than the dext.a.\ncerebral. And here we come \"ery near to an actual difference in the\npower of summoning up ideas or emotions. For .igm are so closely\nconnected. with thinking that it would surprise us to see an aphasic\npatient retaining for long the same mental clearness as before his\naffliction. And our emotions themselves are greatly modified by the\nexpression whicb we give to them. An aphasic (for instance) who can\nexpress disagreement only by an oath is likely to lose bis sense of COD-\ntroversial deference and courtesy. Well, what is now contended is,\nthat just as there may be a right hemiplegia which does not involve\nr..pbasia, and, again, a right hemiplegia so far involving the higher centres\nthat aphasia accompanies it, so also, in this case of a diBBOOiation almost\nunique in its profundity between the activities of the two hemispherei,\nthere was made manifest a difference in stage of evolution between the\n\/,ig\/,flJII, sinistro-cerebraland dextro-cerebral centres-those which preside\nover emotion and ideation. And I go fa.rther, and conjecture that this\ndifference may exist in all of us, and that just as certain of our visceral\narrangements retain the traces of our pre-human ancestry, and just as\nour dextro-cerebral speech-centres are often stammering, childish, or\nwholly inefficient, so also our dextro-cerebral \"character-forming\"\ncentres-the centres wbich on tbat side of the brain sum up or represent\nour highest activities-may retain, in tbeir inferior evolution, tracesof\nthat savage ancestry which forms the sombre background of the refine-\nments and felicities of clvilised man.\nAnd, furthermore, I suggest tbat while we babitually use our\nsinistro-cerebral cOOracter-centres with the same nnconscious choice as\nleads us, for instance, to catch at a rope flung at us with our right\nhand and not with our left, there a.re nevertheless certain states-\nsupernormal !IS well as a.bnormal-in which our Ego (whatever that\nmay be) expresses itself more \"readily through the dextro-cerebral\ncentres, and assumes, therefore, 0. comparatively savage character.\nIf this be so, much light will be thrown on almost all that class of\nSpiritualistic manifestations which OOve bet'.D ascribed to diaholic\nagency. Anti-Spiritua1ists and Spiritualists ba\\'e combined, I think,\nto exaggerate the alarming character of these occasional displays of\nwaywardness and anger. Anti-Spiritualists have, so to say, tied two\nincompatible sticks together to beat the dog with, and have exclaimed,\n\"It is all your own imagination, and the de\"n is at the bottom of it!\"\nAnd certain Spiritualists who decorate their strings of sermonising\nplatitudes with the imagined authorship of Abraham, or Abraham\nLincoln, or Isaac, or Isaac Newton, or Isaac Comnenus, or J &COb, or\nJacob Bohme, according to fa.ncy-as readily as the street-seller labels\nhis penny ices \"pineapple\" or \"vanilla \"-are\" strongly inclined, on\nDigitized by Google\n\fKarch, 1886.] Jorwllnl q,f Society \/01' Pal\/Mical Re88a1\u00b7cll. 229\nthe other IJI~nd, to think that if planchette says, \"I like to be bad,\nand I wish I was worse,\" the very Prince of Darkness must needs have\ndictated the appalling sentiment.\nPerhaps beneath these radiant or sombre trappings there may lurk\nnothing worse nor better than our own small selves;and these oscillations\nmay have no greater amplitude than between one and another centre of\nour own irregularly-developed brains. And if we are not ashamed of\npossessing a digestive system which includes the rudimentary \"vermi-\nform appendix,\"-a motor system which includes the comparatively\ndefective motor innervation of our left hands,-then surely we need not\nbe ashamed of possessing an emotional and ideational system which\nincludes dextro-cerebral elements some twenty generations or so in\narrear of the epoch to which our brain, taken as a whole, entitles us to\nbelong. For those who believe that our evolution has no assignable\nlimit, there may even be something pleasing in such a token lUI this of\nthe rapidity with which we are mounting on the endless way.\nThis theory of the moral duality of the brain is, of course, still on\nits trial. And even if it should be found to be a true theory, and to\ncover some part of the facts of automatic writing, that would not prove\nthat it covered them all. It is for those who deem it insufficient to test\nand, if they can, to support their own ,opinion by carefully-made and\ncandidly-recorded experiments.\nThe l\\leeting then assumed n conversational character.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT ON SPIRITUALISM.\nProfessor Barrett has requested us to reprint the following ex-\ntract-I! from lettE'rs written by bim to Light, in reply to an inquiry\nmade by Mr. Dawson Roge.rs:-\n\" I do not know that my own attitude of mind towards Spiritualistic\nphenomena is of milch intl'rest to anyone, but as Mr. Rogen refen to it I\nmay 8&y it has not clumged ; on the contrary, wider experience has only\nadded to the conviction of the mingl8'i causes which are at work in producin~\nthe phenomena, and tbe mingled feelings with which I regard the whole sub-\nject.

They may be obtained, we may\nadd, at Redway's, 15, York-street, Covent Garden. The magazine is\npublished at Leipzig, and the editor is Dr. Hiibl\u00bbSchleiden, well-known\nin Germany as a publicist, and author of \"Ethiopien\" and other\nworks which ha.ve had an important induence on German colonisation.\nA leading contributor is Baron du Prel, whose interesting work\n\"Die Philosophie der Mystik\" will, we hope, soon appear in an\nEnglish tnmslation of Mr. Massey's. A larger part of the contents\nof these two numbers consists of literary than of experimental\nmatter; but the editor is doubtless the best judge as b the means\nof attracting a.nd increasing the German public interested in these\ndiscussions. There are various articles on which we should have\nbeen glad to dwell, but lack of space compels us to select one only,\ncontaining an account of experiments which, if confirmed and\nrepeated, promise to be of high importance.\nThis is a letter from Herr W. Zenker, of SchOningen (a town be-\ntween Magdeburg and Brunswick), detailing certain experiments with\na tilting table, which, if correctly reported, show at least thought-\ntransference from persons not touching the tahle, 1)robably the attain-\nment through the tilts of facts not known to anyone present, and\npouibly something like identification of the communicating intelligence.\nReduced to their briefest expression the experiments were as\nfollows:-\nI. Frau }[arkworth is said to be communicating. Herr Markworth\ntakes six photographs from his deceased wife's album and holds them at\ngitized by (.oogI\n\f232 Jot,,.,,al qf &Cist'!!lor P,ycAieal Re,en,-cl,.

Herr Markworth, without touching the table, holds a photograph,\nwhich he knows, underneath the table, and asks for the name, \"mit\nihrem Vaternamen also Zunamen.\" He expected the name \"Graftau,\"\nwhich was his wife's maiden name, for the picture was of Frau Mark-\nworth; but \" Markworth It was tilted out and defended by the \" spirit\"\nas correct.\nIII. Frau B. and two children sit at the table. Herr Fr. and Herr\nZenker look on. Table tilts out \"Zimmermann It as communicating\nspirit. This is the name of a telegraphist, known to Herr Fr. alone.\nThey ask him to answer by Morse alphabet. No response_ They ex-\nplain that a long tilt is to stand for a dash, a short one for a dot. The\ntable then answers by Morse alphabet questions of which the answers\nare known to Herr Fr_ only. None of the persons at the table know\nthe Morse code. Of this Herr Zenker is quite certain.\nVarious details show that the answtlrs are not reflections of thoughts\nconsciously in the minds of persons present. This, however, is not (in\nthe present writer's view, at least,) conclusive as to the presence of an\nintelligence separate from theirs; since it is possible that such mani-\nfestations may reflect an uncomct0u8 part of our minds in preference to\nthe conscious stream of thought. The experiment with the }tnknown\nphotographs (itself possibly suggesting clairvoyance rather than an\nextraneous mind) should be varied and repeated as often as possible.\nAnd we should be glad to know more about Herr W. Zenker and his\ngroup. Herr Zenker writes clearly and with moderation, but cannot\nDr. Hiibbe-Schleiden,' or Baron du Pre!, or Professor Sellin gain\npersonal admittance to the circle, and report his experience' Herr\nZenker MyS that this is the only occasion on which he has got pheno-\nmena which exclude thought-transference.
