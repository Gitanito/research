It is hoped that\nthe full Report will be published later in the Proceedings.\nA METHOD OF INVESTIGATION INTO THOUGHT-\nTRANSFERENCE.\nBy F. H. VAN LOON, M.D., O.B.E., and A. A.\n[EDITORIAL NOTE. The authors of the following report,\nDr. F. H. van Loon and Dr. Weinberg, have been members\nof the\" S.P.R. for just over a year. We understand from Dr.\nWeinberg that since this report was sent to us he has, in Dr. van\nLoon's absence, continued his experiments with other collaborators\nand obtained interesting results, which are to be published in\nthe Proceedings of the Dutch Society for Psychical Research.\nThe experiments carried out by other investigators have perhaps\nbeen rather more numerous and more systematic than the Intro-\nduction to the present report suggests. But no one will deny\nthe importance at the present time of conducting carefully devised\nexperiments on as large a scale as possible with a view to deter-\nmining the laws of telepathic communication, concerning which\nwe are at present almost entirely ignorant. We hope that others\nof our members who are qualified for the task, may be moved\nto follow the good example of Dr. van Loon and Dr. Weinberg.\nIt is suggestive to compare the positive results which they\nobtained with the negative results obtained by Dr. Troland (see\nProc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXI., p. 218), in which the emotional element\nto which the present writers attach considerable importance, was\nnoticeably absent.]\nINTRODUCTION.\nIT is a well-known fact nowadays that especially during\n1\nConservator of the Psychiatrical Laboratory of the University of Groningen.\n\fJAN., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought- Transference. 5\nthe last two or three decennia, since several scientific men,\ninterested in the problems of psychical research, have tried\nto unveil the hidden truth they suspected in so many false\nstatements concerning psychical phenomena, real cases of\ntelepathy and thought-transference have been observed. It\nseems to us, however, that it will be necessary for building\nup the higher and loftier storeys of our so eagerly longed-for\nPalace\n\"\nPsyche,\" to try and make more solid foundations\nin order to prevent it from becoming top heavy or a\n\"\nchateau\nen Espagne.\" . . .\nOn this account we had better apply our general methods\nof investigation to this special branch of psychology and\ntry and find out the laws under which the simpler phenomena\noccur. Till now many descriptions, sometimes of real literary\nvalue, of these and other (also\n\"\nspiritistic \") manifestations\nhave been given but there has never been published a\nsystem, nor has a scheme been laid out that could be followed\nby any scientifically trained man who concerned himself\nwith this matter. For here we do not agree with others\nwho think one person is as good as another when investi-\ngating psychical phenomena. Sir Oliver Lodge in The\nSurvival of Man writes : \"It is often cursorily imagined\nthat an adequate supply of the critical and cautious spirit\nnecessary in this investigation is a monopoly of professed\nmen of science. It is not so. Trained students of literature\nnot to mention experts in philosophy have shown them-\nselves as careful, as exact, as critical, and as cautious, as\nany professed student of science.\" This may have been\ntrue during the first years of the existence of the Society for\nPsychical Kesearch but it will not be this type of investigator\nwho will find the psychical laws and rules by which\n\"\nthought\n\"\nand other psychical processes can be transferred from man\nto man, when not by speech or other\n\"\nindirect\n\"\nmeans.\nFor in this matter, as much as in any branch of science,\nwe now not only want good and accurate observers and\nwitnesses of apparitions and seances and phenomena, but\nscientifically trained and scientifically thinking men, who\nnot only are able to exclude fraud conscious or unconscious,\nbut who are able to find other and better experiments, which\nare necessary if ever we are to be able to proceed on our\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.\nlong and difficult way to truth and evidence about Psychical\nPhenomena.\nNow it became clear to us, as soon as we had studied\nthe\n\"\ntelepathic\n\"\nexperiments as described by former investi-\ngators, that ^nearly\nall of them followed the same way\na way lacking in scientific method.\nFor most of them experimented in thought-transference\non this principle only, of taking due precaution against any\npossible fraud, muscle-reading, etc. ;\nas a rule they only\nmade one sort of experiment trying to transfer visual im-\npressions from an\n\"\nagent\n\"\nto a\n\"\npercipient.\"\nWe thought it very probable that not all the contents of\nconsciousness could be transferred with equal ease, considering\nthe fact that the various processes of consciousness make\na very different impression on the human mind. Starting\nfrom this idea we formed the following scheme, which\nin our opinion ought to be followed in further researches into\nthought-transference.\nScheme.\nIt has to be made out : 4\n1. Whether thought-transference, that is to say, the\nactive part of the\n\"\nagent\n\"\nas well as the passive\none of the percipient, is a faculty only of some\npersons, or whether this is a latent power inherent in\nevery human being, which may be developed more or\nless in at least the majority of men.\n2. Whether there are conditions, as differences in sur-\nroundings, in distance between experimenters, in the\ntime of the day, etc., as well as those (probably\nmore important), in the characters of the agents or\npercipients, which are favourable or unfavourable\nto experiments in thought-transference.\n3. In what way and by what means thought-trans-\nference takes place, and whether there is any difference\nin the manner and the degree of the transference\nof the various mental processes or impressions.\nIn this direction an enormous field of future exploration\nlies open and only by minute and systematic experiments\n\fJAN., 1921. Method of \/\/>.W ',<]{ Inn info thought-Transference. 7\nshall we be able to enlarge and improve our knowledge about\nthe big question :\n\"\nWhat is Psyche ?\n\"\nWhen we started with our own experiments we had an idea\nthat one kind of mental process especially would be trans-\nmitted more easily than others ;\ni.e. impressions of an emotional\ncharacter. This idea arose in our minds after seeing the perform-\nance of a professional\n\"\ntelepathist,\" who, under the pseudonym\n\"\nEugen de Rubini,\" had a great success all through Holland\nwith his well-known thought-reading seances ;\nwhen we were\ntalking with Mr. de .Rubini he told us he wanted as\n\"\nleaders\n\"\npeople who could\n\"\nthink\n\"\nstrongly, that\n\"\nin-\ndifferently \"-thinking people were no use, etc. We saw (and\nfelt) that the experiment succeeded extremely well as soon\nas the\n\"\nleader\n\"\nbecame emotional ;\nand afterwards, when we\nourselves were occupied with these well-known\n\"\nhide-and-\nseek \"-experiments, we found our first impression right: the\nemotionality both of\n\"\nleader\n\"\nand telepathist was absolutely\nnecessary for success.\nFor the rest it may be expected that emotionally-coloured\nprocesses of consciousness will be transferred more easily than\nothers, because the former make the deepest impression on\nthe human mind, succeed in drawing all its attention, and\nremain longer close under the threshold of consciousness.\nThis idea is in accordance with other well-known facts ;\nwe know that there are many tales, and also some well-\nobserved facts, *of clairvoyance, real long-distance telepathy,\netc. ;\nand that in nearly all these cases the transferred facts\nor feelings were of a highly emotional character such as\nsudden death, or illness, etc. ;\nand that these phenomena\nnearly always occurred between close relations, intimate friends,\nor husband and wife that there was usually an emotional tie\nbetween the two parties concerned.\nFor this reason we changed the old experiments in this\nrespect that we tried to give them all an emotional feature ;\ninstead of the more or less indifferent visual impressions of\nshape in the experiments Myers, Lodge, Barrett, etc., tell\nus of, we tried to transfer :\n1. colours ; 2. tastes ;\n3. feelings ;\n4. moods.\nWe were so lucky as to find two absolutely trustworthy\nyoung men who had discovered in themselves a telepathic\nA3\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research.

Both are\nvery intellectual, and strongly interested in the problem, and\nwe are greatly obliged to both of them for their disinterested\nhelp.\nIn addition, we had the pleasure of trying two other experi-\nments with Miss Anny Fekken, twenty-one years old. a pro-\nfessional telepathist in this part of the country with whom\nremarkable results, different 'from those obtained with the\nother percipients, were acquired. She too is\nhighly intellectual\nvery sensitive and emotional, just as the two other telepathistsr\nand at our request she was at once ready to put herself\nat our disposal.\nWe will now give the reports made during the seances\nby one of us, while the other one was the agent. Occasionally,\nhowever, the two of us were acting as agents ; but during\nthese experiments Dr. v. L. took down the remarks without\ndelay, whereas Dr. W. went on concentrating his thoughts\nwithout interruption. Most questions to the percipient were\nasked by Dr. v. L. in an absolutely indifferent form and\nvoice ;\nas a rule these questions are between round\nbrackets. We began at first by thinking of sensations and\nemotions till they were projected by us as hallucinations.\nOwing to the subjective character of these experiments and\nthe consequent difficulty of ascertaining whether the experiment\nwas reliable or not, we resolved to arrange matters differently\non the next evening. We then started by making use of real\nstimuli, and moods were only chosen for transmission if the\nagent felt predisposed. The experiments were always preceded\nby a few performances of the\n\"\nWilling-game,\" after which\nthe telepathist felt more disposed to the other experiments,,\nand so a distinctly perceptible mental contact was brought\nabout between percipient and agent.\nWe are sorry to state that we were unable to hold more\nthan nine seances on account of the departure for the East\nIndies of one of us. Both of us intend, however, to continue\nthe experiments as soon as possible.\n\fJAW., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 9\nDETAILED REPORT.\nI.

H. van Loon,\nDr. Weinberg.\nSome experiments of the\n\"\nWilling-game\n''\nare tried, first with\nand then without contact ;\nthey are perfectly successful ; especi-\nally with Dr. W., who had repeatedly conducted the percipient\nbefore ;\nthere is a very strong\n\"\ncontact,\" which is perceived\nby both parties.\nAfter this the percipient is told that we will try to transfer\na thought ;\nthis makes the percipient feel a little nervous, he\nhas some doubts about the results of this kind of experiment.\n1. The percipient is sitting on a chair, blindfolded ;\nDr. van L.\nand Dr. W. are sitting behind him. They hold a playing-card\nbehind his back, and concentrate their thoughts on it (queen of\nhearts) ;\nP. says that he does not feel anything, and guesses\nwrongly (clubs).\n2. A similar experiment (knave of spades) failure (diamonds\nguessed).\n[Note. The failure of the experiments is ascribed to the non-\nemotional character of the\n\"\nthoughts,\" and on this account it\nis decided that the next experiment shall be on colours.\nP. doubts of the good result ;\nhe says he will only mention\na colour if he sees it distinctly.]\n3. The room is darkened (i.e. there is no light at all) ; Dr. W.\nis seated behind P., at the same time holding P.'s left hand.\nDr. W. tries to fix his thoughts on light red so strongly that\nhe has an hallucination of it.\nAfter 2 or 3 minutes P. suddenly exclaims decidedly :\n\"\nRed\"\nHe tells us that he saw it clearly in the shape of a rectangle\nlying flat. Dr. W. declares that he saw it in the same shape.\n4.

L. had been fixing his thoughts on blue, the\ncolour we had wished to take before we had decided to take\nwhite. Dr. W. had not succeeded in getting an image of whiter\nbut had only had a vision of red tinged with violet. Both\nDr. W. and P. saw the colour like a large arc.\nHypothesis.

On inquiry P. says\nhe had a strong sensation of cold, especially in his left hand\nand in the left part of his body. He describes the shiverings\nand the cramp in his hand as similar to those felt on\n1\ncoming\nashore after a bathe when the air is cold. Dr. W. remarks that\nhe felt the auto-suggested cold very strongly, and suffered from\nshivering.\n6. Same conditions.\nImpression to be conveyed : an emotional mood ;\nterror.\nAfter about 3 minutes P. exclaims decidedly : \"A wretched\nmood ! A wretched feeling !\n\"\nHe could not define it more\naccurately. After 6 minutes :\n\"\nSadness\n\"\n;\nafter 7 minutes :\n\"\nNot pure sadness but mixed with vexation.\" This last sensation\nwas not felt very distinctly ;\nbut it was evident that it was\nof an unpleasant nature ;\nhe says that he has even got into a\nsad mood. Dr. W.'s auto-suggestion of terror had been far\nfrom perfect, as in reality he had never come across anything\nthat had given him a sensation of terror.\n7. Same conditions.\nWe try to make the following experiment (a number) emotional\ntoo.\nDr. W. is to think of ten, as the highest mark for a trial-paper.\nAfter some minutes P. observes : \"I cannot see anything\ndistinctly.

November 27, 1919. 3.50 p.m. A room of the Psychiatrical-\nNeurological Hospital at Groningen.\nThe general conditions of the following experiments are as noted\nabove on p. 15.\nPresent : Mr. A.

Impression to be conveyed : the sensation of a galvanic\ncurrent.\nConditions of the experiment. Dr. W. puts the index and the\nmiddle-finger of his right hand in a bath of 2 cells, which are\nconnected with a battery of 5 accumulators, placed in a corner\nof the room behind a screen, which is in its usual place. In the\ncircuit has been placed a push-interruptor, which works without\nnoise ;\nthe cells and the interrupter are taken away from behind\nthe screen after P. has sat down. When the circuit is closed\nDr. W. feels a little, very slightly painful shock springing from\nthe knuckle of the index to the knuckle of the middle-finger.\nHe (Dr. W.) closes the circuit about once in a second.\nAfter 1 minute P. says :\n\"\nI see an object ;\nit is not an\nordinary colour, it has a shape ;\nI saw it only for one single\nmoment it had the shape of a ring now everything is gone.\"\nDr. v. L. says :\n\"\nIt is a feeling.\"\n\"\nThat is\nstrange. I saw a ring.\"\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research.

L. :\n\"\nHow quickly ?\n\"\n\"\nPerhaps one in a second,\" he replies. Dr. v. L. :\n\"\nHave you\nany idea what it is ?\n\" \"\nNo, no pin-prick, but something far\nweaker, as the prickling of soda-water on your tongue an electric\ncurrent, but that gives its pricks stronger and more quickly ;\nit\nis most like an electric current, only there are not nearly so many\npricks,\"\nAfter the experiment P. says he had thought it much weaker\nthan a faradic current as indeed it was !\n2. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.\nImpression to be conveyed : a colour, dark violet.\nThe agent looks at a piece of dark violet paper in the shape\nof an hour-glass on a white ground :\nAfter half a minute P. says : \"I have already seen something\nfor a moment, a black cross with light round it ;\nit looked like\nthis (draws :\n)\nlike the old iron cross on the German flying-machines.\" He\ndraws the same figure in the air. After 3 minutes :\n\"\nEver\nand again I see flashes, but I do not know what it is.\" (\" Try\nagain.\") After 4 minutes :\n\"\nFor a short moment I get an\nimpression of red, but without any shape.\" After 4| minutes :\n\fJAN., 1921.

Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.\nImpression to be conveyed :\nfatigue.\nDr. W. holds a heavy book in his extended right arm.\nAfter 2 minutes P. says : \"I again and again get a sensation\nin the neighbourhood of my mouth : to the left ; in gums and\nlip ;\nI do not know exactly what ; but I hurt my mouth there\na little this afternoon.\" (\"Try to feel it accurately.\") \"Yes,\nbut it is annoying, 1 cannot get rid of that feeling.\" (\" Do you\nfeel anything else ? \") \"No strong feeling ;\nof course all sorts of\nsuggestions of itching, but those I do not take notice of any\nlonger. I do not feel anything positive.\"\n[To be concluded in the next number of the Journal.]\nREVIEWS.\nI. Spiritualism : its Present-day Meaning. A Symposium. Edited\nby HUNTLY CARTER. (Unwin. 8vo. 18s.)\nTHIS is a collection of thirty-nine essays which set forth the\nextremely conflicting views of the authors on what is called by\nthe popular but unsatisfactory term\n\"\nspiritualism,\" and are\nanswers to the following questionnaire sent out by the editor :\n1. What, in your opinion, is the situation as regards the renewed\ninterest in psychic phenomena ?\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1021.\n2. In your view does this psychic renewal denote\n(a) A passing from a logical and scientific (deductive) to a\nspiritual and mystic (inductive) conception of life ?\nor\n(6) A reconciliation between the two, that is, between\nscience and faith ?\n3. What, in your opinion, is the most powerful argument\n(a) For, or\n(6) Against, human survival ?\n, 4. What, in your opinion, is the best means of organizing this\nmovement in the highest interest, philosophical, religious,\nand scientific, of the nation, especially as a factor of durable\npeace ?\nThese questions open a very wide field, and the writers of the\narticles have taken full advantage of the latitude of choice per-\nmitted to them. Thus 188 pages of the 287 of which the volume\nconsists are occupied with the subject from a philosophical and\ntheoretical point of view, and some fifty with the opinions which\nwriters representing various religious organisations have formed on\nthe subject, while the remainder deal with it from a more or\nless but rather less than more scientific standpoint. The con-\ntributions are of very various merit, and though several of the\npapers are good and interesting, the actual amount of information\nto be obtained from the whole is comparatively small. Few of\nthe authors have distinguished psychical research, as such, from a\nnumber of other things, and the failure to do this is especially\nunfortunate in the case of those who write (all, I think, with\nhostility) from the Christian point of view. Never defining what\nthey mean by\n\"\nspiritualism,\" they appear to deprecate psychical\ninvestigation altogether, from a mistaken notion, arising surely\nfrom want of knowledge, that it is anti-Christian because some\nhave sought to construct upon it a sort of new religion. This is\nplainly obscurantism of a disastrous kind. Moreover, while people\nwill probably continue to make so-called religions out of anything,\nthere is no fear that any but the flimsiest can be built up on the\nascertained facts discovered by psychical research. If I may\nspeak for myself, so far as I can see, Christianity has found in it\nnot an enemy but an ally. The materialistic papers are as\ninnocent of argument as might be expected.\n\fJAN., 1921. Reviews. 25\nII. The Foundations of Spiritualism. By W. WHATELY SMITH.\n(Kegan Paul. Post 8vo. 3s. 6d.)\nTHIS little book furnishes an excellent introduction to the subject\nof psychical research and, despite its size, is of far more sub-\nstantial value than the one just- noticed. Lucidly and tem-\nperately written its form is that of a judicial summing-up it\ngives succinctly the results which have been achieved up to the\npresent. If it has a fault, it is that it is too brief ;\nbut it\nshould leave the inquirer eager to learn more, and that is an\nunquestionable merit. It is plain that the author is master of his\nsubject, so that one receives the impression that what he writes is\ndeserving of attention. It is to be hoped that the book is\nhaving a large sale, for what the public needs more than anything\nat this time, in this connexion, is just that simple positive in-\nstruction which is here given.\nIII. The Fellowship of the Picture. Edited by PERCY DEARMER.\n(Nisbet. Sm. 8vo. Paper covers. 3s. 6d.)\nTHIS is a series of automatic scripts written by Mrs. Percy\nDearmer, the wife of Dr. Percy Dearmer, Professor of Ecclesiastical\nArt at King's College, London. The scripts may be described as\na number of short papers having for their theme though this is\nnot stated in so many words- the petition which the war brought\ninto special prominence,\n\"\nThy kingdom come ... on earth even\nas in heaven.\" They contain much that is wise and true and\nbeautiful, and I have noticed nothing which, allowing for some\nadmixture from the writer's subliminal, might not have come from\na discarnate spirit. On the other hand, I am told by those who\nknow Mrs. Dearmer that there is ample reason for believing her\nsubliminal to be quite capable of producing all that we have here.\nThere is not a scrap of positive evidence for spirit intervention;\nthe whole subject is, as I hear, one that she has much at heart,\nand the spiritual atmosphere which pervades the book cannot be\nsaid to be purer than her own may well be. Readers will form\ntheir own opinion on the interesting and tantalising problem\nwhich the scripts present. M. A. BAYFIELD.\nIV. In Search of the Soul and the Mechanism of Thought, Emotion,\nand Conduct. A Treatise containing a Brief but Comprehensive\nHistory of the Philosophical Speculations and Scientific Re-\nsearches from Ancient Times to the Present Day, as well as,\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.\nan Original Attempt to Account for the Mind and Character\nof Man and establish the Principles of a Science of Ethology.\nBy BERNARD HOLLANDER, M.D. (London :\nKegan Paul,\nTrench, Trubner & Co. New York: E. P. Button & Co.\n2 vols. Pp. v. i., 576 ; v. ii., 361. Price 2 2s. net.)\nIT is not easy to discern for whom this very extensive com-\npendium is intended. Its first volume is a compilation of opinions\nabout the\n'\nsoul\n'\nand its relations to the body from the Baby-\nlonians to the present day, giving nearly 200 pages to Gall and\nthe controversy about\n'\nphrenology.' The second volume deals\nwith psychology (which Dr. Hollander restricts to intellectual\nprocesses and distinguishes from\n'\nethology\n'\nin order to emphasize the\nimportance of the emotions and feelings), the localization of mental\nfunctions in the brain, genius, insanity and crime (with a rejection\nof eugenics), the unexplored\n'\nPowers of the Mind,' including\nhypnotism, subconsciousness, suggestibility, hyperaesthesia, dissocia-\ntion, telepathy, the\n'\nspiritual nature\n'\nof man and immortality.\nIt is evident that from the point of view of a psychical re-\nsearcher the interest of the work is largely concentrated in this\nlast section, though it may well be that the author's conclusions\nare consequential on the attitudes he has taken up before. And\nthese do not always seem to rest on a psychological analysis that\ncan be regarded as philosophically adequate. For example, the\nenumeration of the theories about the relations of mind and brain\nis seriously incomplete. It entirely omits the very important\n*\ntransmission\n'\ntheory of James, which, while not denying the\ndependence of psychic states on brain functioning, has the advan-\ntage of conceiving an alternative to the materialistic interpretation\nof this dependence. In consequence of this omission Dr. Hol-\nlander does not see that the evidence he adduces for the localiza-\ntion of mental functions in the brain may not prove what he\ndesires, and entirely fails to see the significance of the considerable\nbody of evidence which shows that in brain lesions the functions\ninterrupted by the damage to their habitual paths of expression\nmay after a time learn to express themselves vicariously through\nother channels.\nAgain, it hardly seems possible to give an adequate, or even a\ncoherent, account of the\n'\ndissociations\n'\nof personality, without\nhaving something like a consistent philosophy about the nature of\n'\nsouls,'\n'\nsubstances\n'\nand\n'\nentities,' and the way in which they\ncan combine unity and variety.- The same lack is felt when one\n\fJAN., 1921. Reviews. 27\nreads that\n\"\nall men must grant that there must be a Power in the\nuniverse from which all life and energy proceed or originally have\nproceeded, a Power which cannot be comprehended or controlled by\nhuman thought and will\n\"\n(ii., p. 335). A critical philosopher will\nobject that, as stated, this postulate is self-frustrating, because a\n'\nPower '\nthat is not comprehended can explain nothing and so\ncannot be a genuine necessity of thought unless necessities of\nthought may be unsound delusions : he will note also that the\nnotions concerned,\n'\npower,'\n'\nuniverse,'\n'\nlife,'\n'\nenergy,' and\n'\npro-\nduction\n'\n(cause) are all human devices (more or less successful)\nfor comprehending and controlling human experience.\nComing finally to Dr. Hollander's conclusions, it may be noted\nthat he declares that\n\"\na ghost is nothing more or less than an\nintensified telepathic vision\n\"\n(p. 316), and is (too) positive that\n\"\nScience has never touched the psychical ;\nit is bound to be\nmaterial to be limited to phenomena which can be verified by\nthe senses\n\"\n(p. 335). Here\n\"\nverified by the senses\n\"\nis surely\nambiguous. In one sense the sciences push far beyond the limits\nof the senses : the ultimates, e.g. of physics,\n'\natoms,'\n'\nelectrons,'\netc., have long been such as not to be perceivable by the senses.\nBut they are believed in because there are ascribed to them\nsensible effects, which they enable us to\n'\nexplain\n'\nand control ;\nhence they may be said to be indirectly\n\"\nverified by the senses.'\n'\nThe existence of\n'\nmind '\nor\n'\nsoul\n'\nor\n'\nspirit\n'\nis attested similarly.\nWe may bring this out by putting a test question to Dr. Hol-\nlander. Would he deny or assert the existence of other minds\nbesides his own ? And would he claim that it was\n\"\nverified by\nthe senses\n\"\n?\nAgain, it is logically quite false that science is materialistic :\n'\nscience\n'\nis essentially a method, and scientific method is as\napplicable to conceptions about the psychical as to conceptions\nabout the material. Moreover, Dr. Hollander himself argues\nforcibly in favour of scientific exploration of\n'\nextraordinary\nphenomena\n'\nelsewhere (cf. ii., 316, 336), and rightly concludes that\n\"\ninstead of saying\n'\nman has a soul,' it would be more correct to\n:say that\n'\nman himself is a soul.' He is not a conscious machine,\nbut a spiritual being.\" Certainly ;\nbut what is implied in being\na\n'\nspiritual being\n'\nis one of the things that science has to find\nout. And psychical research, if not the only, is distinctly the\nmost promising of the scientific ways of finding out.\nF. C. S. SCHILLER.\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The income of the Society was barely\nsufficient to cover the ordinary expenditure, the most serious\nitem of which was the printers' bill, 824 having been paid\nunder this head in 1920, exclusive of a further bill for 475\nfor printing done in that year which had just been received.\nThe current expenditure left no surplus which could be applied\nto special research work, such as the Society had undertaken\nin the past year with regard to\n\"\nEva C.\" If, however,\nthe Society omitted, on the ground of expense, to do work\nof this kind whenever a suitable opportunity occurred, it\nwould inevitably go backwards. It was therefore essential\nthat every effort should be made to increase the Society's\nincome, by enlarging the membership and otherwise.\nTHE CHAIRMAN, rising to move the adoption of the Report\nand the Financial Statement, said that it was evident that\nthe work of the Society was going on in a satisfactory way.\nReferring to the experiments with\n\"\nEva C.\" he was glad\nthat the Society had taken up this branch of research in\nconjunction with qualified medical assistance. He also wel-\ncomed the attention paid to the phenomenon of\n\"\nbook-\n\fFKB., 1921.

He moved that the Keport and\nFinancial Statement be adopted. The resolution, which was\nsupported by Mr. Piddington and Dr. Woolley, was carried\nunanimously.\nThe Chairman announced that four of the retiring Members\nof the Council offered themselves for re-election, and that\nto fill the vacancies caused by the retirement of Mr. H.

For that purpose we shall each time put\ntogether the results obtained by the same percipient and divide them\ninto two groups : one of emotional and one of non-emotional sensations.\nWe remark, however, beforehand, that quite clearly neither the primitive\narrangement of the first experiments nor the systematic arrangement\nof the others offers any opportunity for fraud from the side of the\npercipient. It has besides proved to be of essential value for the\nreliability and easy observation of the experiments, that one of\nthe observers is at the same time an \"\nagent.\" By this measure\nfraud from that side is quite excluded, and one has all the factors in\none's power that may influence the result of the experiment from the\n\fFEB., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 39\nagent's side. One can now get a clear idea of the sensations which\nthe various subjects chosen for transmission give to the agent, and\nthis enables him to find out the truth at once, if the telepathist tries\nto explain away an unsuccessful result, when the experiment is over.\nFarther on we shall have an opportunity of demonstrating this by\nexamples. It seems most desirable to us to criticize the experiments\nin the following way :\n(1) The parts of the experiments; and then\n(2) The total result of the experiments.\nAs a rule the total result is formed by the sum of the results of\nthe parts of the experiment.\nWe have adopted three valuations :\nGood which we denote by +\nWrong by -\nHalf good by\nExperiments that cannot be counted, on account of a failure on\nthe side of the agent to perform his part, are denoted by 0.\nThe experiments are grouped in various classes under the dates upon\nwhich they took place.

Method of Investigation into Thought- Transference. 47\none of our least developed organs of sense has proved to be the one\nthat is least fit. Owing to this fact, no doubt, former experimentalists\nin thought-transference mostly occupied themselves with the transmission\nof visual perceptions.\nWe also see in this result our opinion confirmed that the strongest\nsensations are most adapted for extra-sensorial transmission. For this\nreason it does not surprise us in the least, that the six\n\"\nmood-experi-\nments\n\"\nwere, with the exception of one, all positive ones. Our hypo-\nthesis is further supported by the fact that some negative results are\nowing to the less emotional character of the experiments.\nOf three experiments on sweet taste two (18, 54) were negative and\none (15) suffered from the after-effect of the preceding experiment on\nsour taste, whereas on the other hand the four experiments on sour\ntaste (14, 23, 37, 55) were all positive. The negative result of Experi-\nment 27 must be ascribed to the fact that the sol. chinini was diluted\ntoo much, owing to which the bitter taste was weak ;\nin the experiment\n(41) (mustard), which was considered to be negative, the disagreeable\nsour quality of the taste was all right, but the experiment was very\nlikely too complicated. Of the sensations of feeling: warmth (19, 42),\nfatigue (28), itching (8) were negative, whereas the pre-eminently emo-\ntional feelings of pain (9, 12, 13, 22, 32, 38, 45, 51) were all positive.\nThe contents of consciousness that have to be transferred must be\nable to excite all the interest, to draw all the attention of the agent ;\nif they succeed in doing so a good result ceteris paribus is almost\ncertain, as is distinctly shown by Experiment 25. The strong impression\nthat a transmitted \"\nthought\n\"\nmakes on the percipient, owing to which\na following similar sort of experiment generally fails, also speaks for\nour opinion.\nThe fact that shapes are transferred better than shades of colour\ndoes not confute this ; our sense of colour is far less developed than\nour faculty to distinguish shapes. In continuing these experiments\nwe shall accordingly have to take care that we take for the objects\nof our experiments clearly distinguishable spectral colours.\nFurther, it is urgently necessary for the success of the experiment\nthat the percipient should detach himself entirely from his own thoughts ;\nhe must be \"\npassive,\" as it is usually termed. Only if he is quite\nwithout thoughts will the transferred contents of consciousness be able\nto come above the threshold of P.'s consciousness. Various failures\nmust be ascribed to the percipient's active thinking (see 19, 28, second\nparts of 23 and 34, 46).\nThe less good results Miss Fekken obtained, as compared with the\nother percipients, may partly be ascribed to her inferior\n\"\npassivity.'*\nMiss Fekken is accustomed to give\n\"\npublic seances,\" and owing to the\nlack of phantasy in the public she is obliged to perform the same\nexperiments again and again. Thanks to this she gets a certain routine ;\nshe need not make herself very\n\"\npassive,\" but has to act with wisdom\ninstead. This is evident from the fact that at her seances she never\nfailed, whereas all the \"\nRubini-experiments\n\"\nshe performed at ours\nwere more or less unsuccessful, because she did not make herself sum-\n\f4S Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1921.\nciently passive, but tried to carry out her charge by active thinking.\nShe herself agreed with our opinion of her way of working.\nTo the difficulty this percipient had in detaching herself from her\nthoughts is also to be ascribed the fact that the experiments took so\nmuch time (generally 5-10 minutes), and especially the latent stadium\nthat preceded P.'s perceptions. (Note Expt. 31.)\nIt seems that P. gradually learns to distinguish the transferred stimuli\nfrom the sensorial ones (cf. Expermient 28) ; at least Miss Fekken told\nus that she succeeded in distinguishing the \"\nstrange moods \"\nfrom\nher own.\nIn two experiments visual impressions have been transmitted in a\ndouble shape (e.g. Expts. 26 and 48) ; this may probably have something\nto do with inversion and perversion of transferred sensations, which,\nwe too, often observed in our experiments.\nFinally, we call attention to the interesting particularity that the\ndifferent telepathists do not get the same impressions of the various\nsensations. This is especially proved by the experiments on colours.\nMiss Fekken, as is also evident from experiments not yet published,\nhas not got the faculty of distinguishing transferred colours ;\nshe can\nsee white and she also gets impressions of light, but transmitted colours\nare all alike to her :\nthey are all grey.\nMr. van Dam, on the contrary, is very sensitive to colours, in spite\nof his being less able to distinguish blue from green, whereas Mr. Sriiit\nis a better percipient in this respect than Miss Fekken, though he is\ninferior to Mr. van Dam.\nAs for transferred shapes, Miss Fekken sees those as well as the other\ntelepathists.\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.\nIt has been pointed out that to get some knowledge of the latent\nqualities of the human mind it is first of all necessary that systematic\nresearches should be made. A scheme for these researches has been\nproposed, and we have urged the necessity of these investigations being\nmade, if possible, by scientific people only, one of the investigators\nacting as an agent and another one as an observer.\nA first attempt to examine a certain subject systematically has been\nmade, and we have drawn the following conclusions :\n1. An extra-sensorial perception of contents of consciousness is\npossible.\n2. Emotional processes of consciousness are more easily transmitted\nthan others, for :\n3. Those sensations that make the strongest impression on the\nagent are most easily transferred.\n4. In accordance with this, the impressions received by the best\ndeveloped organs of sense are very likely transmitted most\neasily.\n5. Visual impressions may be seen double.\n\fFEB., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 49\n6. It is necessary for the transference of thoughts that the con.\nsciousness of the percipient be as diffuse as possible.\n7.

ON \"\nTHE FAITH OF A QUAKER.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, I am greatly indebted to your reviewer for his\nfriendly review of my book, The Faith of a Quaker. But his\ncomments on my use of the Subliminal as the vehicle of Divine\ninfluence, which is my central idea, raise a subject which, I think,\nis of sufficient interest to us psychical researchers to merit a\nfurther letter.\nHe agrees, I am glad to see, with my view of the continuity\nof the human and divine consciousness. But he goes on :\n\"\nThat\nthe subliminal influx into the individual mind is the current of\ndivine inspiration more than of mundane monitions or even of\nevil suggestions is rendered most unlikely by the fact that a\nman's individuality is the highest and most fateful self of him,\nwhile the subliminal consciousness is that part of his self which\nis least his own and is shared with his fellows.\"\nI would not myself use the word\n\"\nmore\n\"\nin this connection.\nThe great unmapped subliminal region doubtless contains all the\nabove. I only hold that among it's\nmany paths, the path to\nGod is there. Readers of Myers need not be reminded of the\npurple end of his spectrum, and of his chapters on the Daimon\nof Socrates and the Voices of Joan of Arc. I am with him\nthere.\nIt is actually because the man's\n\"\nindividuality,\" by which\nyour reviewer evidently means his supraliminal self, is the latest\nproduct of his evolution, the most elaborate, the most individually\ncharacteristic (I doubt the usefulness of the word\n\"\nhighest \")\nthat I turn to the subliminal as the organ of his Religion. For\nReligion is primitive, like hunger and sex ;\nit must have been\nthere since man could be called human. One would not look\nfor it among the pinnacles, but among the foundations, among\nwhat is common to men. Qualities are not retrograde or evil\nbecause they are primitive.

To work\nthis idea out in detail was one purpose of my book, a purpose\nwhich has no denominational significance.\nWhilst writing may I briefly add that your reviewer has not caught\nmy view on non-resistance quite correctly. I should resist both\n\"\na wild beast and a murderous fellow man.\" But it is a far\ncry from that to a war for the balance of power and for com-\nmercial expansion ;\nand there are sundry milestones on the way\nwhere consciences may halt.

ON \"\nPSYCHICAL RESEARCH FOR THE PLAIN MAN.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, Will you permit me to thank the reviewer of Psychical\nResearch for the Plain Man for his words of commendation ;\nand, at the same time, to comment on some of his criticisms ?\n(See pages 259, 260, Journal, December, 1920.)\nG. E. W. regrets my omission to deal with\n\"\nthe investigation\nof sensitives purporting to produce\n'\nphysical\n'\nor\n'\nmaterialization\n'\nphenomena.\" I made the omission because I did not find in the\nProceedings or Journal cases sufficiently evidential to be set before\na plain man. But I considered the chapter on Poltergeists\nafforded evidences that physical phenomena are produced ; and I\nsuggested that they are produced by semi-physical emanations\nfrom the young mediums ;\nand that this same semi-physical\npower is the means by which Miss Goligher moved tables, etc.,\nin co-operation with Dr. Crawford. (Psychical Research for the\nPlain Man, pages 265, 266.) G. E. W. gives no reason for\nconsidering the reference to Miss Goligher in this connection\n\"\ninappropriate.\"\nAs regards my omission to make reference to Mrs. Piper and\nMrs. Leonard, I would say the Piper-phenomena literature is so\nvast, that to deal with it in a short chapter appeared to me to\nbe absolutely impossible.

Correspondence. 51\nrule against cases connected with mediums who receive payment,\nas I consider it has important bearings on two of the few original\ntheories I have ventured to set forth in my book. I have\nsuggested that mediums are able to describe in minute detail\nthe bodily appearance and gestures of deceased persons, by seeing\nvisions of such persons in their former earthly environment,\ntogether possibly with relatives still surviving ;\nand that this\nwould account for the fact that mediums often profess uncertainty\nwhether the person seen is alive or dead. (See pages 98 and 99\nof Psychical Research for the Plain Man.) To this theory the\nreport on Mrs. Leonard's seances lends some support, as Feda\nconstantly says of the communicator\n\"\nShe is showing Feda some-\nthing like a wall . . . there looks to Feda to be a kind of valley\n. . . Feda thinks she shows the left side . . .\nyou see its like a\nnegative to Feda what she shows,\" etc. etc. etc.\nAnother theory I have ventured to set forth in the book is that\nNelly, Mrs. Thompson's\n'\ncontrol,' was a resuscitation of Mrs.\nThompson herself as a child. Now I believe\n\"\nFeda\n\"\nMrs.\nLeonard's\n\"\ncontrol\n\"\nis .supposed to be an adult Eastern. But\nthe impression I gain of her is that she might be a little English\ngirl a possible resuscitation of Mrs. Leonard as a child. It\nwould be very interesting if Mr. Piddington, who seems to have\nknown and appreciated Nelly better than anyone else, would\ngive us his views on this suggestion which will be found worked\nout rather more fully on page 110 of Psychical Research for the\nPlain Man.\nS.

MARCH, 1921.\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1920.\nTHE principal piece of research work carried out by the Society\nduring the past year has been an enquiry into the phenomena\nof the medium \"\nEva C.\" In the Annual Report for the\nyear 1919 reference was made to this intended enquiry, which\nwas carried out during the spring and early summer of 1920,\na special committee having been appointed by the Council for\nthis purpose. The medium and her friend Madame Bisson spent a\nlittle over two months in this country at the invitation of the\nSociety and during that time 40 sittings were held, of which\n27 were negative. At the remaining 13 sittings phenomena\nwere observed of the type usually associated with Eva C.'s\nmediumship. The phenomena, however, even at the best sittings\nwere small and scanty compared with those observed elsewhere,\ne.g., by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, and described in his book,\nof which an English translation has recently appeared.\nA report of these observations has been drawn up by the\nCommittee, part of which was read at a Private Meeting of\nthe Society on December 9th last. It is hoped that the\nfull report will be published later in Proceedings.\nThe Committee were fortunate enough to secure the assistance of\nMr. E. J. Dingwall, a Member of the Society, both in observing the\nphenomena and in drafting the report upon them. Mr. Dingwall\nhas contributed to this report a chapter entitled\n\"\nThe Hypothesis\nof Fraud,\" in which he discusses the question of what assumptions\nthis hypothesis entails and to what extent it can reasonably be\nsupposed to account for the phenomena observed. For this\ntask Mr. Dingwall is especially fitted by his wide knowledge\n(based on practical experience) of the various tricks to which\nillusionists have recourse. Mr. Dingwall is shortly proceeding to\nAmerica as Research Officer on Physical Phenomena to the\nAmerican S.P.R., so that we shall lose his services here for the\npresent.\nAlthough\n\" Eva C.\" does not make any charge for her sittings,\nan investigation of this sort necessarily entails heavy expendi-\nture. As is mentioned above, Madame Bisson and\n\"\nEva\nC.\" were the guests of the Society for several weeks, and\nthere were various other expenses also. The enquiry has cost\n\fMARCH, 1921. Report of the Council for the Year. 55\nthe Society in all about 247, exclusive of the further cost\nto be entailed in publishing the Committee's Report.\nThe cost of printing continues to be very heavy and there\nappears to be no prospect at present of any diminution. The\npayments for printing during 1920 amounted, as is shown in the\nStatement of Accounts, to 824, as compared with 633 in 1919\nand 378 in 1918. Some idea of the increase in the relative\ncost of printing can be derived from the fact that whereas the\naverage cost per page of the Proceedings was about 13s. during\nthe five years preceding the War, 1909-1913, the average\ncost per page in 1920 was about 1 6s. Od., that is to say,\ntwice as much.\nA considerable number of new books have been added to\nthe Library during the year. The Council feel it to be of\nmuch importance that so far as possible the Library should\nbe kept up to date, and Members are asked to send to the\nSecretary any suggestions they may wish to make with regard\nto the purchase of books. Since, however, the number of\nbooks published upon subjects which have a bearing upon\npsychical research is now very large, it is evidently impossible\nto purchase all of them, and therefore only those can be\nchosen which seem likely to be of permanent value, or for*\nwhich there appears to be a considerable demand amongst our\nmembers.\nAmong minor experiments conducted at the Rooms of the\nSociety during 1920, were two Sittings with the professional\nclairvoyant, Mr. Sutton. Some thirty or forty members\nattended one or other of these Sittings, but the results obtained\nat them were unfortunately of no evidential value.\nWe have endeavoured during the past year to enquire into\nthe phenomena of Mr. Hope, the well-known\n\"\nspirit -photo-\ngrapher.\" But although two or three individual Members of\nCouncil have been able to obtain a sitting, Mr. Hope does\nnot seem willing to take part in an official enquiry by the\nSociety under test conditions.\nThe President of the Society during the past year has been\nDr. W. M'Dougall, who gave his Presidential Address in July.\nAs he pointed out on that occasion, although the Society has\nboasted many leading men of science among its Members,\nfew of them have been psychologists ;\nand we are the more\nA2\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.\nfortunate in having had the active co-operation of so dis-\ntinguished a psychologist as Dr. M'Dougall. Although he is\nnow resident in America, having been appointed as Head of\nthe Psychological Department at Harvard, a position once\noccupied by William James, Dr. M'Dougall has not lost his\ninterest in our work and has consented to accept nomination\nfor the Presidency during the current year. It is to be\nhoped that his presence at Harvard may stimulate a further\ninterest there in psychical research.\nThe Council have to record with great regret that Mr.\nJ. G. Piddington has resigned the honorary treasurership. He\nonly undertook the post temporarily on the resignation of\nMr. H. Arthur Smith in 1917, so that we have been fortunate\nin his retaining the office so long. The Council feel they may\nalso congratulate the Society on having secured Mr. W. H.\nSalter as his successor.\nA welcome addition to the Officers of the Society is Dr.\nV. J. Woolley who has consented to be Joint Honorary\nSecretary with Mrs. Sidgwick.\nMr. Piddington has been appointed a Vice-President of\nthe Society. Sir J. J. Thomson, who retires in rotation\n'from the Council and does not offer himself for re-election\nbecause he is unable to attend its Meetings, has also con-\nsented to be nominated as a Vice-President.\nThe Society has during the year suffered the loss through\ndeath of one of its Vice-Presidents who had held the office\nfor more than twenty years Professor J. H. Hyslop, who was\nalso President of the American Society for Psychical Research.\nProfessor Hyslop was one of the most zealous and industrious\nworkers engaged in Psychical Eesearch and was for many\nyears not only the President and Secretary, but in fact\nthe mainstay of the American Society. He contributed to\nour own Proceedings, before the American Branch became\nan independent society, a volume (Vol. XVI.) on Mrs. Piper\nwhich contains careful observation and, in an appendix, an\naccount of some interesting experiments on the \"\nIdentification\nof Personality\n\"\nover a telephone.\nDeath has also deprived us of a Corresponding Member\nProfessor Flournoy of Geneva, who carried through the long\nseries of observations and experiments on Helene Smith\n\fMARCH, 1921.\nReport of the Council for the Year. 57\nchiefly upon her impersonations in the hypnotic state, but\nalso upon her automatic writing and published the results\nin his book Des Indes a la Planete Mars.\nThe present Report is the first which has been drawn up\nby the Council since there has been any opportunity of\nobserving the effect upon the Society's membership and\nfinancial position of the decision, come to in January 1920,\nto suspend the election of new Associates. In view of this\ndecision, and in view also of the fact that many people are\nnow finding it necessary to exercise a more strict economy,\nan increase in the membership was not to be expected.\nThe actual result, which shows a net decrease of only twelve,\nas may be seen from the table given below, must be regarded as\nsatisfactory :\nLOSS IN MEMBERSHIP.\nMembers. Associates.\nResignations\n-\nDeaths -\nRemoved (for non-pay-\nment of subscription)\n-\n26 Resignations\n- -\n46\n10 Deaths - 5\nRemoved (for non-payment\n5 of subscription)\n- - 21\nTotal loss -\nNumber of new Members elected\nNet loss\n72\n41\n-\n113\n-\n101\n- 12\nThe loss during the past year from resignations and failure\nto renew subscriptions is unusually large, 98, as compared\nwith 62 in 1919. But in very few cases, so far as we have\nbeen informed, has resignation been due to a diminution of\ninterest in the work of the Society, and in many instances\nMembers have explained that the need for retrenchment in\npersonal expenditure is their reason for resigning.\nAs regards the amount received in subscriptions, the position\nof the Society has been strengthened ;\nfor whereas the majority\nof those who for one reason or another have ceased to sub-\nscribe were Associates, paying one guinea a year, all those\nwho have been elected are Members, paying two guineas.\nAnd, moreover, in the course of the past year 24 Associates\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.\nhave become Members. The Council take this opportunity\nof again expressing their thanks to these Members for their\nwelcome support.\nThe total membership of the Society now stands at 1302,\nof whom 463 are Members and 839 Associates.\nThe amount received from the sale of publications at half\nprice to Members and Associates has been smaller than last\nyear, mainly owing to a decrease in the sale of complete sets\nof Proceedings. On the other hand the amount received from\nsales to the general public has been unusually large, 108 13s.\n8d. as compared with 49 16s. Od. in 1919. This increase is\npartly accounted for by the increase in prices, but it is also\ndue to larger sales. There continues to be a steady demand\nfor Part LXXIII. (Mr. G. W. Balfour's paper on\n\"\nThe Ear\nof Dionysius \"), and we have further evidence of the interest\nwhich this paper has aroused in the fact that Mr. Henry Holt,\nthe well-known New York publisher, has, with the permission\nof the Council, published it in book-form in America.\nWe welcome the formation of the Glasgow Society for\nPsychical Research under the Presidency of Mr. A. J. Balfour,\nO.M., F.R.S., and having upon its Council one of our own\nCouncil-Members, Sir George Beilby, F.R.S., and Professor\nW. Macneile Dixon.\nWe understand that a Dutch Society for Psychical Research has\nrecently been formed, two members of which, Dr. van Loon,\nO.B.E., and Dr. Weinberg, are members of our own Society\nalso, and have sent us a report of some experiments in thought\ntransference, which is printed in the last two Journals (January\nand February, 1921). We welcome their co-operation and\nwe hope that they and other members of the Dutch Society\nwill be able to continue their researches.\nPublic interest in psychical research in this country continues\nto be manifested in various ways. It not infrequently happens\nthat the Secretary is asked by local clubs and debating\nSocieties to provide a lecturer, and a rather unusually large\nnumber of such requests have been received during the past\nyear. Whenever it was possible the request has been complied\nwith, in order to stimulate a scientific interest in the subject,\nand the Council feel that the Society is indebted to those of\nits Members who have consented to address Meetings.\n\fMARCH, 1921. Report of the Council for the Year. 59\nAt the Conference of Bishops, held at Lambeth Palace in\nJuly 1920, a discussion on spiritualism took place. In the\nreport of the Conference, subsequently published, a sharp\ndistinction was drawn between \"\nSpiritualism\n\"\nregarded as a\nreligion on the one hand, and on the other, scientific research\ninto psychical problems, such as the Society undertakes. As\nregards scientific research the report of the Conference is\nsympathetic, and we are glad to find ourselves on this point\nat one with its Members.\nA new publication, entitled The Psychic Research Quarterly,\nmade its first appearance in July, 1920, under the editorship\nof Mr. Whately Smith. Its purpose is to set forth and\ndiscuss the problems of psychical research in a scientific spirit,\nbut in a more popular form than is possible in our Proceedings.\nWe believe that this publication is likely to do useful work,\nand we wish it all success.\nThe output of Proceedings during 1920 has been rather\nsmall owing to the unavoidable delay in publishing certain\npapers which have been read at Meetings. It is hoped that\ntwo of these papers will appear shortly.\nThe number of Meetings held during the year for the reading\nof papers has been six.\nJanuary 28th, 1920.\n\"\nA Report on some 'Book-Tests'\nobtained through Mrs. Leonard.\" By Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nApril 13th, 1920.\n\"\nSome Impressions of a New Associate.\"\nBy Mr. G.

MARCH, 1921.\nNOTICE CONCERNING THE BELFAST CIRCLE.\nIT is probably known to many members of the Society for\nPsychical Research that the prolonged experiments conducted\nby the late Dr. W. J. Crawford on the mediumship of Miss\nK.. Golligher of Belfast were supported financially by a gentle-\nman who wishes to remain anonymous and whom I will\nallude to as Mr. X.\nSince Dr. Crawford's lamented death, Mr. X. has been\nanxious that his work should be continued by some suitable\ninvestigator, and several months ago invited through me the\nco-operation of the Council of the Society in finding such a\nresearcher, but up to the present without success. Mr. X..\ndid not wish any general announcement of the vacancy to be\nmade, so that I have not been able to go outside the small\ncircle of those known personally to the members of the Council.\nHe has now decided to make his offer public, and some\nmembers may have seen the concluding paragraph of the\narticle by Mr. F. M'C. Stephenson in the issue of Light for\nMarch 5th in which the position is offered . For the sake of\nthose members who may not see it, and in view of the im-\nportance of the investigation, I think that the offer should\nnow be brought to the notice of all members of the\nSociety.\nThe essential conditions and qualifications are as follows :\n1. The person appointed must reside in Belfast for at\nleast a year.\n2. He or she must have an adequate knowledge of chemical\nand physical science. No definite standard has been\nformulated, but I should estimate that the standard\nof the medical curriculum would be an absolute\nminimum, and a higher one would be extremely\ndesirable.\n3. He or she must have an aptitude for original investi-\ngation, and must also possess the social qualities\nwhich are necessary to maintain harmony and good\nfeeling in the circle.\nThere are other conditions as to the conduct of seances and\npublication of results which I need not enter into here. It-\nwill readily be seen that the position is . not an easy one to-\n\fMARCH, 1921. Notice concerning the Belfast Circle. 63\nfill, but there should be in the Society some one or more\nsuitable candidates. The work will be paid, and anyone who\nundertakes it will have ample leisure to pursue other studies\nif (as is very desirable) they should care to do so.

WOOLLEY.\nTESTIMONY TO A CHILD'S IMPRESSION OF FAIRIES.\nBY SIR OLIVER LODGE.\nSOME months ago I was privately shown a pair of incredible\nphotographs supposed to be taken by children in Yorkshire.1\nAbout the same time a lady well known to us, and called\nby my children\n\"\nWoodie,\" was on a visit, and told me that\na friend of hers, who was apparently possessed of psychic\nfaculties, had a vivid recollection of having been able as a\nchild to\n\"\nsee\n\"\nsomething of the same kind, and gave me\nthis lady's name and address. Whatever may be the psychical\nsignificance of so curious an impression, I thought it desirable\nto get her testimony recorded in detail before any publication,\nof the photographs, and before she had heard anything about\nthem. So I wrote an enquiry to this lady, whom I will here\ncall Mrs. Alleyne a stranger to me but well known to my\nfriend and she was good enough to reply promptly and\nfully as follows :\nLetter from Mrs. Alleyne to Sir Oliver Lodge.\nAugust IQth, 1920.\nYou ask me to tell you about the\n\"\nFairies\n\"\nI saw in my\nchildhood.\nI have always been conscious of other forms of spirit life\nbesides our own. I can remember when I was five years of age\nbefore I could read fairy tales (and we were not told any) slipping\nout of bed at dawn and going into the garden to talk with the\nfairies, it was when I could be alone and away from my brothers\n1\nSee supplementary note below.\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.\nand sisters that I felt and saw them. They were always beautiful,\nnever old, not very young, just without age.\nSometimes as a child I would at night suddenly awake feeling\nrigid with fright, and I used at once to send a call to the fairies\nto come to me, and first I would hear faint music growing louder\nand louder till my room was filled with music and from every\nside little fairies came and glided along the coverlet of my bed\nand all my fear was turned to joy, and they put me to sleep\nagain. They have nearly always been accompanied by music.\nSince I have grown up I have still seen the Fairies, but the\nconditions must be right. A short time ago I was on the Downs\nnear here in the morning and it was very still and quiet and\nno one about, and as I sat in the grass I felt the conditions\nchange I became aware of faculties which normally I have not\nat all. I could hear each little blade of grass vibrating and\nthere was harmony in every note, I could see an aura to every\nflower and the fairies were there in colours like the auras. I\nseemed to be conscious of being in quite a new world, my material\nbody was forgotten. I felt in an inner world of colour, music,\nand scent, and perfect peace and happiness. I do not know\nhow long I felt and saw this, as the approach of a shepherd\nbroke the spell, and all was just the Downs again.\nAs a child I did not talk much about the Fairies, but I never\nrealised that other people didn't see them. I thought my own\nbrothers and sisters too noisy to see them.\nI have often known them to come to my aid when in childish\ndifficulties, but I never mixed the Fairies up with the human\nspirits which I often saw.\nAnother thing which may interest you is that as a child I\ncould see in the dark ;\nI used to think the Fairies gave me a\nblue light because there was no darkness for me, I could see\na blue light which showed things to me, not a diffused light,\nbut a guiding light which I thought the Fairies brought for me,\nbut when awake at night in bed the blue light grew more general\nand I saw them in it. I was always conscious of each Fairy\nvibrating and the music coming from them.\nI have also seen in the woodlands\n\"\nBrownies,\" but strange\nto say I have never got in touch with them, they have taken no\nnotice of me and I have not known how to attract them. These\nBrownies are much bigger than Fairies and denser. I have\n\fMARCH, 1921.\nTestimony to a Child's Impression of Fairies. G5\nnever seen them in open spaces, only in Woodlands, and I have\nheard no music those times.\n[CELIA ALLEYNE].\nI then wrote again a letter of which the following is a\ncopy :\nCopy of further enquiry from 0. J. L. to Mrs. Alleyne.\nAugust 20th, 1920.\nIt is very good of you to have taken the trouble to answer\nmy question so clearly and explicitly, especially as I understand\nthat at the present time you are very busy. If you are still\noccupied, pray do not answer this further enquiry until it is\nquite convenient. I hardly expect that you will be able to\nanswer it in a manner satisfactory to sceptics :\namong which\ngroup I must include myself.\nIt is obvious that if your experiences correspond with objective\nreality they are most important, but on the other hand it is very\ndifficult to discriminate between objective and subjective impres-\nsions ;\nhence I must tell you what impression your letter would\nmake upon a sceptic. He would say that at the time of those\nexperiences you were dreaming, and probably either asleep or\ndozing. For instance, you speak of\n\"\nslipping out of bed at\ndawn and going into the garden\n\"\n: is there any guarantee or\nproof that you actually did that ? Was not the house locked\nup ? Did you undo the bolts ? Were you ever discovered in\nthese nocturnal excursions ? And can you adduce any outward\nand visible sign that they really occurred ?\nYou know how many people have an impression that they are\nable to float or fly or soar or hover over the ground without\nmuch muscular exertion ;\nand some people have imagined this so\nvividly that it is difficult to convince them indeed they find it\ndifficult to convince themselves that they have not really done so.\nIn recounting your second kind of experience you speak of\nawaking at night in a state of fright and soothing yourself asleep\nagain by your visions : the sceptic would certainly say that you\nwere in all probability only dreaming that you wakened and\ngot to sleep again.\nYour third class of experience, lying in the grass when it was\nstill and quiet, and becoming aware of extra faculties until dis-\nturbed by a shepherd, reads strongly as if you had been dozing.\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.\nI rather think that the blue light of which you also speak would\nbe accounted for in the same way.\nNow my question is, what answer could you make to these\ncontentions, beyond mere assertion of their falsity ? And can\nyou adduce any actual proof of reality underlying your undoubted\nmental states ?\nI am told that you can still see what may be called spirits\nor phantasms, and have in fact the clairvoyant faculty fairly well\ndeveloped. I am far from denying the existence of this faculty,\nbut it is a phenomenon that requires careful study and much\nelucidation. Hence anything that throws light upon it is of value.\nReturning now to the beginning, and writing as if I had\nadmitted that the creatures you saw and called Fairies have a\nreal existence, can you remember what kind of size they were ?\nWhat they wore ? And what they were doing ? Were they>\nfor instance, winged creatures ? or had they any other peculiar-\nities to which you can testify ? I ask this because I am in\ntouch with other evidence in favour of certain children to-day\nseeing what they call Fairies, and likewise Brownies. If they\nare real beings the visions of them by different people ought to\ncorrespond ; whereas, if they are creatures of the imagination,,\neach person would be able to create a world of his or her own.\nLet me make it clear that I do not for a moment question\nyour possession of unusual psychic faculties ;\nit seems to me\nquite likely that you are occasionally in touch with other intelli-\ngences, and can be made the channel for genuine information\nderived from them, either telepathically or in some other way.\nBut these intelligences will not usually be bodily dwellers on this,\nplanet. Scepticism becomes pronounced when the existence of a\nrace of creatures living on this planet but quite unknown to\nbiology, are asserted to have a real and not a visionary existence.\nPlease understand that I am not denying the fact (for in that\nI hold my judgment in suspense), but I am pointing out to you.\nthe urgent need for strong and convincing evidence before asser-\ntions of that kind can be assimilated or even contemplated by\nScience. OLIVER LODGE.\nMrs. Alleyne's second letter, in reply, ran thus :\nAugust 2lst, 1920.\nMany thanks for your letter, I am only too pleased to give you.\nany little personal information that is within my power to do.\n\fMARCH, 1921.\nTestimony to a Child's Impression of Fairies. 67\nReferring to my being asleep as a child and dreaming\n\"\nFairies.\"\nI must tell you that I have been found in the garden in the\nearly morning wet through with the dew, and severely scolded\nby my mother for slipping out. I can well remember standing\non a hall chair to unfasten the bolt and the ugly squeak it made,\nwhich I hated so much, not for fear of waking up the household\nbut because\n\"\nugly noises frightened away the fairies\n\"\nand I\nthought they would hear. It had to be still and quiet or I\ncould not see them.\nAs to when I woke at night in a state of fright I used some-\ntimes to get out of bed, and not having a key to my door,\nfix a piece of string from the handle to a nail in the framework\nof the door, so that anyone opening it to enter would only push\nit open a few inches. I think I was afraid of something coming\nthrough the door, but I don't know what. (The nursemaid in\nthe morning used to tease me about the string.) When I re-\nturned to bed I was full of expectancy for the coming of the\n\"\nfairies,\" not asleep at all, I only went to sleep after they came\nto soothe me.\nYou ask about size. My impression is from four to six inches ;\nthey vary, never beyond six inches.\nConcerning clothing not any they appeared to me iridescent,\nlike a dragon-fly's wing, many colours, only instead of being a\nsolid whole like the fly's wing, they were visible vibrating\nparticles, which gave out a musical sound, and took shape and\nform, but without the appearance of any actual sex.\nI have seen a\n\"\nfairy\n\"\nwhen I have been walking with my\nhusband, but this was only once, it was in a meadow field in\nspring, and it was gliding just above the flowers. I have never\nnoticed any wings, and you can see through them, there is no\nbodily, substance.\nThe\n\"\nBrownies\n\"\nI also saw when I was with a friend, and\ntried to point them out, but he could not see them ; they appeared\nquite a foot in height, and had clothed bodies and were very\nbusy talking to each other, though I could not hear them.\nI think perhaps I am inclined to have an extra vision to\nmost people. I will relate a small incident in connection with\n\"\nWoodie,\" as she will be able to speak of it for herself. About\na month ago a Miss [Moore] (pseudonym) and myself were\ntalking in the sitting room, which looks on to a path leading\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921,\nfrom the garden gate to a porch. I was expecting\n\"\nWoodie\n\" L\nto come to dinner in about an hour's time, and had just remarked\nto my friends, that \"we should be quite undisturbed until then\n' y\nwhen on looking out of the window (it was a bright sunny\nevening), I saw\n'\"'\nWoodie\n\"\nopen the garden gate and come up\nto the porch, and I remarked to Miss Moore,\n\"\nWhy, here is\nWoodie !\n\"\nShe heard the gate latch 2\nbut did not see her, being away from\nthe window ;\nI also remarked,\n\"\nWoodie has a new coat on,\"\nand we went out into the hall to meet her. Not finding her\nthere we looked all over for her, convinced that she had come\nin. We had gone into the garden to look there, when \"\nWoodie\n''\ndid arrive and we exclaimed\n\"\nWhy did you go out again ?\n' r\nTo which she replied that she had only just come ;\nbut she was\nwearing what was a new coat to me, for I had not seen it before,\nand it was the one I saw her enter the gate in.\nI find this kind of thing is very often happening. I see people\ndistinctly just before meeting them.\nI only mention this because my friend Miss Moore felt sure\ntoo that \"Woodie \"\nhad come in.\nDr. Vanstone was lecturing down here some few months ago\nhe is quite a stranger to me, but as I sat amongst the audience\nI told my husband that I could see an old lady standing by\nDr. Vanstone, with a white cap on and an ebony stick in her\nhand. My husband suggested that after the lecture, we should\nwait and ask Dr. Vanstone if he knew anyone answering the\ndescription. Dr. Vanstone at once replied,\n\"\nYou have described\nmy Mother, whom I felt was near me throughout the lecture.\nShe always wore a cap and carried that stick.\"\nThese are two very small incidents but as each has a tangible\n\"\nsomething\n\"\nat the back of it, I can't help thinking that the\n\"\nfairies\n\"\nare not little creatures of the imagination only.\nI am very ignorant, but could they possibly be\n\"\nmusical\nvibrations\n\"\nwhich I see and which my mind gives form to ?\nI really do not know what I am talking about when I suggest\nthis, but I am sure there is something there with movement,\ncolour, and sound, which gives happiness.\n1\nThe real names of these ladies and of Mrs. Alleyne are known to the\nS.P.R.\n2\nSee Miss Moore's statement below.\n\fMARCH, 1921, Testimony to a Child's Impression of Fairies. 69\nI have had remarkable (to me) experience in other spheres at\nnight, when my spirit travels forth, but I find it so extremely\ndifficult to put the experiences into mere words, and as they are\nentirely without proof they will not be of the same interest to\nthe investigator.\nI am afraid I have not been of much use to you in this letter,,\nbut I have just stated things as I see them.\nI am really rather an active sort of person and not in the\nleast inclined to sleep or doze during the daytime, I have never\nknown myself do it. All my friends call me extremely practical f\nBelieve me I am only too pleased to do any little thing I\ncan. [CELIA ALLEYNE].\nI have received the two following statements confirming\none of the episodes related by Mrs. Alleyne in the above\nletter :\nI. Confirmatory Statement from Miss Moore.\nI was talking to Mrs. A. in her drawing room one evening,\nWe expected to be alone for some time. When I had been there\nabout five minutes, she heard the gate click and looking round\nsaw W. walking up the path to the front door. (I do not re-\nmember hearing the gate click and from where I was sitting\nI could not see the path.) Mrs. A. jumped up saying\n\"\nHere\nconies W.,\" and mentioned that she was wearing a new coat.\nWe went to the front door to meet her and found no one there.\nWe called her and after looking for her in the house and garden\nwe sat down again wondering what had become of her, and\nMrs. A. again mentioned the clothes she was wearing. About\nfive minutes after Mrs. A. had seen her W. arrived, wearing a\ncoat that was new to Mrs. A. She greeted her with,\n\"\nWhy did\nyou run away ?\n\"\nW. said,\n\"\nWhat do you mean ? I have walked\nstraight here.\" M. D. [MOORE].\nII. Confirmatory Statement from\n\"\nWoodie.\"\nI remember the incident referred to. C. A. was expecting me\nup to dinner, but when I arrived I was greeted by :\n\"\nWhy did\nyou go away again just now ? I saw you come in at the gate\nfive minutes ago.\" I had to say that that was my first appear-\nance. She seemed surprised, and said,\n\"\nI felt so sure you had\ncome that I went to the door to meet you, you were wearing\nthat new coat. When I saw you come in at the gate, not\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.\nfinding you, M. and I went into the garden (which is at the\nback) calling for you.\"\nShe must have been seeing me psychically ;\nshe certainly\nseems to have this faculty, for she has told me several times\nof events happening before they\n\"\nactually\n\"\noccur.\nWOODIE.\nNOTE BY SIR OLIVER LODGE IN SUPPLEMENT\nTO THE ABOVE COMMUNICATION.\nPhotographs alleged to be of fairies have been published, with the\napparent sanction of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in the Strand Magazine\nfor December, 1920, and March, 1921. Also an admittedly faked\nphotograph has appeared in the Yorkshire Observer for Thursday,\nMarch 10th, 1921.\nPhotographic evidence always seems to me particularly unsatisfactory,\nbecause methods of faking are numerous. Many people imagine that\nthey saw fairies in childhood, without any question or thought of\nphotography ;\nand to explain Sir Arthur's photographs in a rational\nmanner, without accusation of fraud, the simplest hypothesis would\nseem to be that an imaginative child, playing the game of make-\nbelieve, might sometimes innocently assist the imagination of her\nplaymates by figures designed by herself, if she had the skill, and\nthat these figures might subsequently get photographed. Without\nclosing our minds, this is the present position of myself and my\ncollaborator, Mr. J. Arthur Hill, in connexion with this matter.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF PSYCHO-\nDYNAMIC PHENOMENA.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, The letter contributed by Mr. G. E. Wright to the\nDecember issue of the Journal on the subject of the experimental\ninvestigation of psycho-dynamic phenomena is indeed a welcome\nindication of the interest that is taken by members and associates\nof the Society in the somewhat dry technicalities involved in\ntelekinetic experiments.\nMr. Wright appears to me to lay greater stress upon the\nopinions of critics than is justified by their remarks. It is true\n\fMARCH, 1921.\nCorrespondence. 71\nthat Poolmore said that Eusapia could have done everything at\nthe Naples sittings if she could have freed an arm or a leg, but\nhe does not explain how, for instance, the curtain could have\nbeen blown out if those limbs had been free. When Mr. Wright\nsays that even under unsatisfactory conditions of control we may\nsurely assume that there could be no doubt as to whether the\nsensitive was seated or not, I cannot agree with him. I do\nnot know what he means by\n\"\nunsatisfactory,\" but in absolute\ndarkness it seems sometimes quite impossible to know what the\nmedium is doing even when being held. Mr. Wright will call\nto mind the extremely important case of Miss Burton who was\nable to move different parts of her body and lean far over the\ntable in trance in a way which was apparently quite impossible\nfor her to do in her normal condition. Your correspondent\nrather glosses over the difficulty when he says,\n\"\nthe Control\napart from initial and final examinations need not go beyond\nthe assurance that the sensitive does not move, or move from,\nher chair, an assurance easily obtained even in darkness.\"\nWith regard to his second point I agree that the position of\nevery article used should be accurately recorded before and after\neach seance. As to the imitation seance, little could, I think,\nbe gained from such a procedure, since how could the experi-\nmenters duplicate exactly the stretchings and muscular con-\ntortions of the medium ? Of course if an object was found to\nhave been moved at about eight feet off, then perhaps it would\nbe safe to assume that the medium's limbs had not produced the\nphenomenon unaided, and some other hypothesis might have to\nbe adopted. Generally speaking, if the light is good enough to\nsee the hands and feet of the medium, then the genuine or\nfraudulent character of these phenomena can be determined by\ncompetent investigators without very great difficulty. In a dim\nlight the difficulty naturally increases, and in complete darkness\nlittle certainty can ever be attained unless the objects moved are\nsome considerable distance from the medium. As Mr. Wright\npoints out, if telekinetic extensions exist, they probably do not\nextend more than a short distance beyond the extremities from\nthe sensitive and in darkness it is impossible to say how far\nabnormal stretchings and movements on the part of the medium\nmay be responsible for the shifting of objects occurring at a\ndistance which, under normal conditions, would be out of reach\nof the sensitive. The experiments with Miss Burton (which I\nrecommend Mr. Wright to read over again carefully) have put\ninvestigators on their guard when dealing with these phenomena,\nand the results obtained have added further difficulties to a\nsubject already strewn with many a pitfall.\nE. J. DlNGWALL.\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.\nREVIEW.\nStudies in Dreams. By Mrs. H. 0. ARNOLD FORSTER. Geo. Allen &\nUnwin Ltd. 8s. 6d. net.\nThis book is an account of the dreams experienced by the\nwriter who claims to have developed by practice a notable degree\nof dream-control, as well as a remarkably complete memory\nof her dream-experiences. The dream-control, however, is chiefly\nof a negative kind. By repeating to herself while awake the\nformula\n\"\nRemember this is a dream. You are to dream no\nlonger,\" she is able to cut short any dream which causes her\ndistress, since these words return to her mind even while dreaming.\nShe does not at present seem able to control her dreams to the\nextent of bringing about a pleasurable dream-experience, though in\nthe case of flying dreams she is able to prolong her flight by\nthe use of a similar formula about the law of gravitation.\nAs regards the causation of dreams, she rejects Freud's view\nthat every dream represents symbolically the fulfilment of a\nrepressed desire, though it is not very clear what she would put\nin place of it, and the fact that she finds that certain simple\ndreams give her on waking a quite disproportionate feeling of\nhappiness and contentment seems to show that her dreams arise\nfrom deeper strata of her mind than she has at present succeeded\nin probing. From the point of view of the Society, the most\nimportant chapters are those dealing with the\n\"\nBorderland\nState\n\"\nbetween sleeping and waking. This is divided into two\nstages, an earlier and a later, and it is in the earlier stage alone\nthat she considers that genuinely supernormal experiences may\noccur, as well as a great increase in the power of certain normal\nmental faculties.\n\"\nAt such moments,\" she writes,\n\"\nthe answer\nto some difficult question which has baffled our intelligence by\nday may flash into the mind, appearing to come to us from\nwithout rather than from within,\" and she compares this state\nwith the ecstasy of mystics and with the early stage of hypnosis.\nThe later stage of the borderland state is not associated with\nincreased mental faculties but with an apparent hyperaesthesia\nof certain senses, including curiously enough the sense of smell.\nThis hyperaesthesia is accompanied or followed by the so-called\nhypnagogic hallucinations which have been so often described,\nand consist of pictures or faces which appear just before con-\nsciousness is lost. These visions the writer considers are of the\nsame nature as dreams and like dreams are not related to any\nexternal source, while the experiences of the early borderland\nstate convey a\n\"\ncertainty that they come from without, not\nfrom within.\"\nThe clearness of the author's memory of her dreams and\nborderland states makes the book a very valuable contribution to\nour knowledge, while the style of her writing makes it an\nunusual delight to read.

A TELEPATHIC DREAM.\nTHE following case of a dream which appears to have had a\ntelepathic origin has reached us through Sir Oliver Lodge.\nThe names and addresses of the persons concerned are known\nto the Society, but pseudonyms are used here.\nThe original statement made by the dreamer ran thus :\nJanuary 14, 1921.\nOn Saturday night, January 8, 1921, I slept at N Rectory,\nBedfordshire, and some time before 7.15 a.m. the time when\nI was awakened on Sunday morning I had the following dream.\nI saw a piece of water near a wood and standing near the\nedge looking in was Miss [Colman] of Oxford. On one of the\nfingers of her right hand was a signet ring engraved with her\nmonogram. She was holding this hand over the water when\nI noticed a small white spider which bit it causing her so much\npain that she shook her hand violently, so that the ring dropped\noff her finger into the water. Looking down into the water,\nwhere the ring had disappeared, I noticed that it was so trans-\nparent that I could see to the bottom. At the bottom were\nseveral large square blocks of hewn stone and it looked as if the\nring were concealed under one of them. Miss [Colman] and\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1021.\nI seemed to be standing side by side looking down into the\nwater and talking with much energy when I awoke suddenly\nwith words still on my lips. I cannot remember what we were\ntalking about. The three things which the dream impressed\nmost vividly on my mind were (1) a spider of extreme whiteness,\n(2) Miss [Colmanj's signet ring, (3) the great square blocks of\nhewn stone at the bottom of the water. R. [DRAPER].\nWe have also received statements from Mr. Draper's mother\nand from Miss Colman, thus :\n1. Mrs. Draper's Statement.\nJanuary 14, 1921.\nOn January 12, 1921, I was lunching at my house [in] Oxford\nwith my son the Rev. R. [Draper] and Miss L. [Colman]. In\nthe course of conversation my son remarked that he had had\na curious dream on the previous Saturday night while sleeping\nat - -\nRectory, Bedfordshire. I can remember the following\nparticulars which he gave of his dream. He saw Miss [Colman]\nstanding by side of a piece of water which he thought bore a\ndistant resemblance to an extremely pretty spot on the Aber-\ngavenny Canal in Monmouthshire. He saw a white spider bite\nher finger. She shook her hand in pain so that her ring dropped\ninto the water ; looking in he saw some square blocks of hewn\nstone at the bottom of the stream. He could not see the ring\nwhich had apparently disappeared under one of them.\nThereupon Miss [Colman] remarked that she had read something\nlike that in a paper at the reading-room on the previous Saturday\nafternoon immediately after leaving my son, who was on his way\nto the station. A. S. [DRAPER].\n2. Miss Colman's Statement.\nJanuary 14, 1921.\nOn Saturday, January 8, [1921] I accompanied the Rev.

[COLMAN].\nIt will be observed that the points in Mr. Draper's dream\nwhich appear to show a connexion with the story of St.\nBride, read by Miss Colman immediately after she parted\nfrom him on the day before the dream are :\n(1) the blocks\nof stone, (2) the presence of a woman by a pool of water,\nand (3) the idea of a ring being lost by falling into the water.\nA point in Mr. Draper's dream for which telepathy from\nMiss Colman does not appear to account is the white spider\nwhich in his dream bit Miss Colman's hand, thus causing\nher to lose the ring. The analogy with the story of the\nfishes putting their faces against St. Bride's fingers is slight,\nand the spider is left quite unaccounted for. We therefore\nwrote to Mr. Draper to ask whether he could suggest anything\nin his own experience which would throw light on this point.\nWe asked whether he had had any quite recent experience\nwhich might have a bearing on the matter and whether\nhe was aware of having any particular feeling either of interest\nin or dislike of spiders, especially white spiders, since the\ncolour of the spider appears to have been insisted on in his\ndream.\nHe replied thus :\nFebruary 4, 1921.\nI have been thinking very carefully about possible sources for\nthe appearance of the small white spider in my dream, but\nhave been utterly unable to find any clue.

A VERIDICAL APPARITION.\nTHE following report of a hallucination, which appears to\nhave been telepathically induced, has been sent to us by\nUna, Lady Troubridge, the percipient, and Miss Radclyffe-Hall,\nwho was with Lady Troubridge at the time of the occurrence.\nThe name of the lady referred to here as Miss X. is known to\nthe Society.\nI.\nSTATEMENT BY LADY TROUBRIDGE.\nPRINCES HOTEL, BRIGHTON,\nAugust 23rd, 1920.\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall and I left this hotel at 10.45 this morning,\nhaving arranged yesterday to meet our friend Miss X. at a\nneighbouring garage at 11 o clock with a view to availing ourselves\nof her technical knowledge in the inspection of a car which Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall desired to purchase. As we were walking up the\nmews containing the garage, a long uphill road with garages all\nthe way up on both sides, and were within about thirty feet\napproximately of our destination I could see two cars one a\nblack touring and one a dark red touring car standing outside\nthe garage to which we were bound, and between the red car\nand the entrance of the garage I distinctly saw Miss X. standing\nin profile facing towards the left. She was standing in an\nattitude very familiar to me feet slightly apart, and the associa-\ntion awoke in me that she was rocking slightly backwards and\nforwards on her feet as she often does her head was thrust\nrather forward and with a walking stick she was pointing and\n\fLPRIL, 1921 Case : A Veridical Apparition. 79\ngesticulating in front of her low down I took her to be indicating\nthe engines of some car standing out of my line of vision within\nthe garage. She was wearing a thin dark navy blue suit familiar\nto me, and a black felt man's hat which I knew to be one I\nhad only seen her wear recently when staying at our house.\nI said to Miss Radclyffe-Hall,\n\"\nOh, there is X., what a baby,\nshe is already there, she has got there before us to look at the\nengine,\" thinking that the fascination of inspecting an engine\nlad been too much for our friend, who had hurried to be previous\nat the rendezvous. She seemed to be standing either against\nthe open glass door of the garage, or, it crossed my mind\nwithout at the moment striking me as illogical, that I might-\nbe seeing her reflected in a glass, as her figure appeared as I\nmight say dark against a background of glass and yet as will\nbe seen by the sequel I not only saw her with normal distinct-\nness, but in a way too detailed in my opinion to be possible for\nnormal vision at some thirty feet away and I am very short\nsighted and was only wearing a monocle, which assists my sight\nless than the spectacles I sometimes wear, and although it did not\nstrike me at the time, when I described what I had seen to Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall, prior to our joining Miss X., I realised that I had\nnoticed details in a manner which I thought, and still think, exceeded\nmy normal visual powers at that distance. I must have taken my\neyes off her as I spoke to Miss Radclyffe-Hall, because when the\nlatter in reply to my saying\n\"\nThere's X., etc.\" replied, \".Where\nis she ?\n\"\nI answered,\n\"\nIn the shop,\" the fact being that I no\nlonger saw her and assumed she had gone into the garage or\nshow-room. As we came up to it and entered the doors, I said\nto the engineer who came forward,\n\"\nWhere is Miss X. ?\n\"\nand\nlooked round surprised at not seeing her in fact I was walking\nround a car that stood in the show-room expecting to find her,\nwhen the man replied,\n\"\nI haven't seen her this morning, she\nhasn't arrived yet.\" In view of something which Miss X. had\ntold me not long ago regarding a supposed hallucination of her\nseen by a friend, I then understood that something of this nature\nhad occurred and had the presence of mind not to exclaim aloud\nthat I had seen her but having walked all round the show-room\nand ascertained that she was not there I remarked in an under-\ntone in French to Miss Radclyffe-Hall,\n\"\nAll the same I saw her.\"\nBy this time I was awake to the possible importance of the\nhappening and also both Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I began to fear\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.\nthat the phenomenon might be associated with some mishap to\nMiss X., so Miss Radclyffe-Hall told the engineer that we would\nreturn later and we walked towards Miss X.'s house this was in\na neighbouring square some five minutes' walk from the garage.\nAs we went I described to Miss Radclyffe-Hall my vision, and I\nsaid,\n\"\nWhen we see her we must note how she is dressed and\nwe shall see whether she is wearing the suit I saw or another\"\nI told Miss Radclyffe-Hall that I felt sure I had seen her wrong\nthat what must have occurred was that Miss X. had sent out\na strong telepathic impression towards the place where we were to\nmeet and that I had caught it and externalised it, clothed\n(simply because I personally liked and admired Miss X.) in\nthe hat and clothes which I thought most becoming to her. I\nadded and Miss Radclyffe-Hall agreed that it was very unlikely\nshe would be wearing the thin navy blue suit, as she had com-\nplained to us that she felt cold in it had worn a thick tweed\non the previous day and would be sure to wear the same tweed\non this day, as it was a very cold morning and Miss Radclyffe-\nHall and I had put on thick tweeds and winter overcoats. When\nwe reached Miss X.'s house we enquired for her and were told\nshe had not yet gone out. We walked up and down and in a\nfew moments she came out of the house carrying a walking stick\nand clad in the exact suit and hat that she had worn in my\nvision. When I told her in Miss Radclyffe-Hall's presence how I\nhad seen her about ten minutes previously she replied that at\nthat time she was worried at the fear of being late for our\nappointment, that the navy suit was lying, prepared for her to\nput on, on her bed and that she had already decided to wear\nthe new black hat because she had since yesterday taken a violent\ndislike to the other hat, a navy blue one she had been habitually\nwearing but that she had never worn that black hat with that\nnavy suit before. UNA VINCENZO TROUBRIDGE. ^\nII.\nORIGINAL REPORT BY M. RADCLYFFE-HALL REGARDING LADY\nTROUBRIDGE'S TELEPATHIC VISION OF Miss X.\nPRINCES HOTEL, BRIGHTON,\nAugust 23rd, 1920.\nUna, Lady Troubridge and I were to meet Miss X. at a certain\nmotor garage this morning, the time fixed being 11 a.m. Miss\n\fAPRIL, 15>2\nX. had\nIL, 1921. Case : A Veridical Apparition. 81\nX. had promised to try a new car for me. Lady Troubridge\nand I walked up the mews to the garage, it was about ten\nminutes to eleven o'clock. As we neared the entrance Lady\nTroubridge exclaimed,\n\"\nOh, there's X., what a baby ! She's\ngot here before us to look at the engine.\" I could not see our\nfriend; so enquired where she was. Lady Troubridge replied,\n\"\nShe's in the shop.\" (She meant in the show-room of the garage.)\nWe entered the garage together and looked about for Miss X.\nand I noticed that Lady Troubridge seemed taken aback at not\nseeing her at once. She spoke to a salesman saying,\n\"\nWhere is\nMiss X. ?\n\"\nhe replied,\n\"\nI haven't seen her this morning ;\nMiss\nX. has not arrived.\" Lady Troubridge seemed unconvinced and\nlooked behind a large car, she also glanced towards the back\ngarage as if expecting to see our friend, then she turned to me\nand said in French,\n\"\nAll the same I saw her.\" We then left\nthe garage and I suggested going at once to our friend's house\nto make enquiries. As we walked there Lady Troubridge told me\nthat\n'\nshe thought she had experienced a telepathic hallucination\nand wished to describe to me the clothes in which Miss X. had\nappeared to her, before we knew what Miss X. would wear that\nmorning ;\nthis detail was important as Miss X. was not staying\nat our hotel and could not have been seen by us prior to the\nvision.\nThis is what Lady Troubridge described ;\nshe said that Miss\nX. was wearing her dark blue suiting coat and skirt, carrying her\nstick and wearing a particular new black felt hat that both\nLady Troubridge and I liked. Lady Troubridge said that it\nwould be interesting to see what clothes Miss X. was really\nwearing, but for her part she felt certain that they would be\ndifferent, the reason she gave for this was that on the previous\nday our friend had worn a thick pale blue tweed because it\nwas cold, and that as it was just as cold to-day, so cold that\nwe were wearing thick tweeds and heavy overcoats, it would\ndoubtless transpire that Miss X. would be wearing her heavy\nsuit and not the dark blue suiting, which she told us a few days\nago was too light in weight for such cold weather. Lady Trou-\nbridge went on to speculate as to the causes which might have\ncontributed to her seeing our friend dressed in clothes other than\nthose which she felt sure she would find her actually wearing,\nand we concluded that if this turned out to be the case it should\nbe attributed to mediumistic colouring on Lady Troubridge's part,.\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.\nshe having seen the vision clothed in the suit in which she liked\nto see our friend. Nevertheless we attributed the origin of the\ntelepathic vision to Miss X. in the first instance.\nArrived at Miss X.'s house we asked whether she had already\nleft home and were informed that she had not done so ;\nwe said\nthat we would wait for her outside the house. In a few minutes\nMiss X. joined us. She was wearing the very suit in which Lady\nTroubridge had seen her and also the new black felt hat, she\nwas carrying her walking stick. We told her what had happened ;\n.she expressed interest and seemed startled. We questioned her\n.and she stated that she was thinking of us and of the garage at\nabout ten minutes to eleven, having realised as she dressed that\nshe would be late for the appointment, she had looked at her\nwatch and had felt fussed and worried. She stated that the suit\nshe was wearing was lying ready for her on the bed at that time\nand that she had already decided to wear the black felt hat,\nhaving taken a sudden dislike to the dark blue hat which she\nalways wore with this dark blue suit ;\nshe had taken a dislike\nto the hat on the previous day. This dark blue hat was the one\nwhich Miss X. had worn with the pale blue tweed suit yesterday,\nand which we had hitherto seen her wear with the dark blue\nsuiting coat and skirt. We had never previously heard Miss\nX. express a dislike for the dark blue hat. Miss X. volunteered\nthe information that she had never before this occasion worn\nthat particular black felt hat with the dark blue suit.\nAfter describing to me Miss X.'s clothes on the way to her\nhouse, Lady Troubridge described to me in the presence of Miss\nX. the exact position by the entrance to the garage in which\nshe had seen the vision, also the characteristic pose in which\nshe had seen our friend, who, she said, appeared to be rocking\nslightly backwards and forwards on her feet, her head thrust a\nlittle forward while she gesticulated and pointed with her walking\nstick ;\nshe said that she supposed her to be talking to a salesman\nand pointing at some motor with her stick.\nIII.\nM. KADCLYFFE-HALL'S AMPLIFICATION OF ORIGINAL STATEMENT.\nSeptember 20th, 1920.\nLady Troubridge and I were staying at Princes Hotel, Hove,\nBrighton ;\nwe had gone there on August 20th, 1920, with a view\n\fAPRIL, 1921. Case : A Veridical Apparition. 83\nto being near Miss X., a friend of ours who was staying with\nher mother at Hove. We have recently seen a great deal of\nMiss X. in London, and she has stayed with us at Chip Chase,\nHadley Wood. With regard to the amount of rapport likely\nto exist between Miss X. and ourselves, a rapport which it might\nbe thought would facilitate the occurrence which I am about to\nrelate, it may be as well to state that Miss X. and I have known\neach other for many years but have only recently known each\nother at all well, while on the other hand Lady Troubridge has\nonly known Miss X. during the past few months, during which\nperiod, however, we three have become intimate friends.\nWe have discussed Psychical Kesearch with Miss X. on many\noccasions, and on two or three occasions have been told by her\nthat, as she describes it, she has been said to appear to people\nin her astral ;\nshe has assured us that these people have de-\nscribed her appearance accurately afterwards, and that on one\noccasion a friend of hers declared that she had spoken to the\nvision and had been answered by it, and this in broad daylight\nand in a most public place. Now with regard to the impression\nthat these statements made on us, I think I am safe in saying\nthat neither Lady Troubridge nor I myself took them very\nseriously at the time ;\nand Miss X. herself, having no knowledge\nof her own exteriorizations, being conscious of no peculiar sensa-\ntion and of no circumstances which would in her opinion have\nbeen likely to cause such a thing, told us quite frankly that she\nwas relying entirely upon what her friends had told her. We\ngathered that she neither believed nor disbelieved, that she\nthought a certain amount of imagination might have played a\npart in the statements made to her by her friends, but that,\nnevertheless, the fact that this exteriorization had been reported\nfrom several independent sources had, as was only natural, im-\npressed her. The exteriorization had been going on for years, the\nfirst instance of it having occurred when Miss X. was at school.\nI am quite certain, and so is Lady Troubridge, that when we\nwent to Hove we were not expecting to have this fact demon-\nstrated for ourselves, we were not thinking about Psychical\nResearch, from which we were purposely enjoying a complete\nrest ;\nhad we been asked I think that we would have both said\nthat we wished to avoid the supernormal in all its aspects ;\nwe\nwere in a festive, holiday mood.\nOn August 23rd, 1920, that is to say on the third day after\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.\nour arrival at Hove, Lady Troubridge and I had arranged to\nmeet Miss X. at a certain garage in Hove at 11 a.m. in order\nthat Miss X. might try a new motor for me. It happened\nthat Lady Troubridge and I were too early for the appointment\nand that at ten minutes to eleven we were walking up the mews\nin which the garage is situated. As we neared the entrance of\nthe garage, being approximately thirty feet away from the door,\nLady Troubridge exclaimed;\n\"\nOh! there's X., what a baby! She's\ngot here before us to look at the engines,\" or words to that\neffect. I looked but could not see our friend, so enquired of\nLady Troubridge where she was, she replied\n\"\nShe's in the shop.\"\nNow, as will be seen from Lady Troubridge's original report which\nshe made on the day of the occurrence, she told me that Miss\nX. was in the shop ;\nshe explained to me afterwards that she\nhad not seen Miss X. walk into the shop, but had taken her\neyes off Miss X. in order to speak to me and not seeing her when\nshe again looked up, she naturally concluded that our friend had\ngone into the show-room. We entered the garage together\nexpecting to see Miss X., and I noticed that Lady Troubridge\nseemed taken aback to find that she was apparently not there ;\nshe spoke to a salesman who came forward, saying,\n\"\nWhere is\nMiss X. ?\n\"\nand he replied,\n\"\nI haven't seen her this morning,\nshe has not arrived yet,\" or words to that effect. Lady Trou-\nbridge did not seem convinced and I saw her glance around the\nback of a large car, and look enquiringly towards an inner\ngarage as if expecting to see our friend. Apparently, however, she\nsaw nothing, because her astonishment appeared to me to grow\nand she turned to me and said in a very emphatic undertone\nin French,\n\"\nAll the same I saw her.\"\nI was struck by the incident and naturally was reminded of\nthe stories Miss X. herself had told me regarding her curious\nfaculty for exteriorization. Lady Troubridge and I left the\ngarage, and as we felt a little uncomfortable, wondering if our\nfriend was well, I suggested going at once to her house to make\nenquiries. This we did, the house being only a few minutes away\nfrom the garage. As we walked away from the garage Lady\nTroubridge told me that she thought she had experienced some\nsort of telepathic hallucination, and that in view of its possible\nimportance she wished to describe to me the clothes in which\nshe had seen Miss X. before it w&s possible for us to know what\nclothes our friend would be wearing that morning. I realised\n\fAPRIL, 1921. Case : A Veridical Apparition. 85\nthe importance of this, the more so because, as I have already\nstated, Miss X. was not staying in our hotel or anywhere within\nsight of it or of the garage, so that we could not possibly have\nseen her on the morning of the vision.\nThis is the description of Miss X.'s appearance as given to me\nby Lady Troubridge on our way to Miss X.'s house. She said\nthat she had seen Miss X. dressed in a dark blue suiting coat and\nskirt, carrying her usual walking stick and wearing a particular\nnew black felt hat which we especially liked. Lady Troubridge\nsaid that it would be extremely interesting to see what clothes\nMiss X. was really wearing, because for her part she felt quite\ncertain that they would be different to those seen in the vision.\nHer reason for this supposition, she told me, was that on the\nprevious day our friend had worn a light coloured blue tweed\nsuit because it was cold, and that as it was just as cold on the\nmorning of the vision, so much so that we were dressed in heavy\ntweeds and overcoats, it was ten to one that Miss X. would wear\nher heavy tweed suit and not the dark blue suiting coat and\nskirt, which she had told us a few days ago was too light in\nweight for cold weather. And here, I would say in parenthesis,\nthat no two suits could be more dissimilar than Miss X.'s pale\nblue tweed and her dark blue suiting coat and skirt ;\nthe former\nis made of an Irish homespun in a very light nattier blue largely\nused for ladies' and children's dresses; the jacket is short, roughly\ntailored and has large leather buttons. The dark blue coating,\non the other hand, is of a navy that is almost black, with a\nlounge coat very well fitted to the figure and giving an appearance\nof extreme slimness and smartness which can certainly not be\nsaid of the tweed. Lady Troubridge seemed convinced in her\nown mind that she had clothed the vision to suit herself, and in\nview of the biting wind I thought she was probably right. She\nbegan to speculate as to the causes which might have contributed\nto her seeing our friend in clothes quite other than those which\nwe both felt sure we would find her actually wearing, and we\nconcluded that if, as we thought, Miss X. should be found to be\nwearing her warm coat and skirt, which was the only one that\nseemed appropriate to the weather, we would be forced to con-\nclude that Lady Troubridge had indulged in mediumistic colouring,\nand had clothed the vision in the particular suit which in our\nopinion was the most becoming to Miss X. I cannot say, how-\never, that we hesitated to attribute the origin of the telepathic\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.\nvision to Miss X. in the first place ;\nI do not think that it ever\nentered our minds to suppose that Lady Troubridge had imagined\nwhat she saw, I know that I personally was absolutely convinced\nthat she had actually seen Miss X., or rather some part of Miss\nX., or some vision of Miss X. as we approached that garage,\nbecause the whole thing seemed so spontaneous and so natural\nwhen Lady Troubridge first drew my attention to Miss X.'s pres-\nence, as did her astonishment and incredulity when she found\nno Miss X. on entering the garage. It was not until a little\nlater that Lady Troubridge described to me in the presence of\nMiss X. the exact spot just in front of the garage doorway,\nwhere she had seen our friend standing pointing with her walking\nstick at something, a gesture which was very characteristic of\nMiss X. During the short walk from the garage to Miss X.'s\nhouse Lady Troubridge had only time to describe the clothes in\ndetail and to speculate regarding their accuracy ;\nthis appeared to\nher to be the only matter of importance, and I think she was right.\nArrived at Miss X.'s house we enquired whether she had already\nleft home that morning and the servant informed us that she had\nnot done so ;\nwe told him that we would wait for her outside\nthe house. In a few minutes Miss X. joined us on the pavement,\nand to our great interest we found that she was dressed precisely\nas she had been dressed in the telepathic vision. Miss X. was\nwearing her dark blue suiting coat and skirt, in spite of the cold\nshe had not put on an overcoat or her heavier suit, and it must\nbe carefully remarked that she was wearing the particular new\nblack felt hat which Lady Troubridge had described to me. Miss\nX. carried her walking stick, but this latter point is not im-\nportant because we had never seen her without it at Hove.\nWe hastened to tell Miss X. what had happened and she seemed\ninterested and a little startled ;\nwe naturally questioned her\nclosely regarding her frame of mind at the time when Lady\nTroubridge had seen the vision, wishing to know if she had been\nthinking of us, etc., we learnt from her that she had been thinking\nof us and of the motor garage at about ten minutes to eleven\no'clock, approximately the time when the vision was seen. She\ntold us that as she was dressing she realisejd that she would be\nlate for the appointment, that she looked at her watch, feeling\nfussed and worried. We asked her at about what hour that\nmorning she had decided to wear her dark blue suiting coat and\nskirt, and although she could not tell us the precise hour when\n\fAPRIL, 1921. Case : A Veridical Apparition. 87\nthis idea occurred to her, she was able to assure us that it must\nhave been prior to ten minutes to eleven since that particular\nsuit was lying ready for her on the bed before that hour. But\nperhaps the most arresting feature in this case is the incident of\nthe new black felt hat. Miss X. told us that she had decided\nthat morning to wear this black felt hat because on the previous\nday she had taken an unaccountable dislike to the navy blue\nhat which it was her custom to wear with that suit, and which\nincidentally we had always seen her wear with it. Miss X. went\non to say that she had never before this occasion worn that\nparticular black felt hat with the dark blue suit, she was perfectly\nclear and emphatic on this point.\nOne may ask why, at the time of the vision, Lady Troubridge\nwas not very much struck by the fact that our friend was wearing\nan unusual hat with that suit. Lady Troubridge says that she\nwas not struck by this fact, she states that she was pleased our\nfriend was wearing this new black felt hat, as although not very\ndissimilar from other country hats worn by Miss X., it was\nnewer, a smarter shape and more becoming. It is difficult, except\nupon the hypothesis of the experience having been that of a\ngenuine telepathic vision, to know why the black hat should\nhave been present ; we had neither of us heard Miss X. express\nthe least dislike of the dark blue hat, which hat, as it happens,\nshe had been wearing on the previous day with her pale blue\ntweed suit ;\nin fact ever since we had arrived at Hove Miss X.\nhad worn either a Panama, a light grey hat, or the dark blue\nfelt hat which she should have been wearing on the morning of\nthe vision ;\nwe had seen the new black hat in the hall of her\nhouse, I think, in any case we knew the hat because she had worn\nit when staying with us at Chip Chase, but, as I have stated,\nwe had not seen her wear it at Hove, which appears to add to\nthe interest of this case.\nIn conclusion I would point out those facts which appear to\nme to render it well-nigh impossible that Lady Troubridge could\nhave imagined the vision, or for perhaps impossible is too strong\na word at least improbable. She had never seen the black\nhat worn at Hove and Miss X. had never before worn it with\nthat particular suit, therefore Lady Troubridge can never have\nseen Miss X. dressed in precisely that manner prior to the vision ;\nagain, Lady Troubridge associated quite a different suit with\ncold weather, not only because she had seen Miss X. wearing a\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.\nheavy tweed suit when it was cold, but because Miss X. had\ncomplained a few days previously of the fact that her suiting\ncoat and skirt were too thin to wear in cold weather ; and,\nyet again, on the previous day Lady Troubridge had seen our\nfriend dressed in a totally different suit because it was cold,\nand wearing, not the black felt hat of the vision, but the dark\nblue felt hat which Miss X. had told us was the only one that\nkept on when it was windy. If an association of ideas had\nplayed any part in the vision seen by Lady Troubridge, then\nsurely she should have seen Miss X. dressed in the pale blue\ntweed suit and wearing the dark blue felt hat ;\nor if she saw her\nin the suiting coat and skirt, then she should also have seen her\nwearing the dark blue felt hat which was the hat associated in\nher mind with that suit.\nIt may be of interest to close with a word or two regarding\nMiss X. and ourselves. Miss X. is about forty-five years old,\nshe is a great athlete, and enjoys exceptionally good health.\nShe is interested in Psychical Research, in Theosophy and kindred\nsubjects, has read a great deal, but is not in the habit of fre-\nquenting mediums or taking an active part in such matters.\nBeyond the fact that she undoubtedly felt flurried and annoyed\nat the idea of being late for her appointment with us on that\nmorning, and that at about the time of the vision she was\nthinking of us and of the garage, we have not been able to trace\nany predisposing factors, such for instance as illness, sleep, or a\nstate of acute agitation. As for ourselves, Lady Troubridge\nand I were feeling unusually well, and beyond the fact that,\nhaving come to Hove in order to be with Miss X., she was\nnaturally much in our minds, not only as we approached the\ngarage to keep the appointment but more or less all the time,\nwe have been unable to discover any predisposing factors in our\nown conditions.\nIV.\nMiss X.'s STATEMENT.\nRegarding the telepathic vision, astral vision, or whatever it\nmay have been, that Lady Troubridge saw of me standing just\noutside the garage at Hove on August 23rd, 1920 : I have read\nthe reports of the occurrence drawn up by Lady Troubridge\nand Miss Radclyffe-Hall, and I certify that these reports of\ntheirs are quite correct regarding all those details that came\nwithin my personal knowledge.

My father\nhad worked in the island, and frequently visited Ventnor on\nprofessional duty.\nHe now said he would make \"\nan attempt at clairvoyance\non the physical plane,\" and proceeded to state that, close\nto our names and the address, there was a word looking like\n\"\nLoos.\" Thinking this too vague I asked if the verb\n\"\nto\nlose\n\"\nor the adjective\n\"\nloose\n\"\nwas meant ? The control\nreplied that it was more the name of a town, or possibly a\nperson. I mentally concluded that if this word were there it\nwould prove to be the French Loos, of which one not in-\nfrequently heard during the war. To my considerable surprise\nI found, in a\n\"\nGolden Wedding\n\"\nnotice immediately following\nour names, that a bridegroom living at Loose Court had been\nmarried at the Church of All Saints, Loose. This was my\nfirst acquaintance with the fact that a Kentish village bears\nthis name. One can scarcely suppose that the appearance\nof such a name in an exact position described on the previous\nday can be attributed to chance.\nOctober 2th, 1919, at 3 p.m.\n\"\nIn The Times for to-morrow, first page, column two, and\nnearer the top than one quarter down, is your uncle Alfred's\n.name.\" I asked if his three names were there and was told\nto look for two of them.\nThree inches from the top of this column was Alfred and\nimmediately beneath it William. Although I knew that\nAlfred's second name commenced with\n\"\nW \"\nI do not think\nI ever knew what it stood for, and had to refer to family\nrecords before discovering that his full name was Alfred\nWilliam Thomas. It became evident that my communicator\nknew more about Alfred than I did, as well as having superior\n\fMAY, 1921. Newspaper Tcul*. 91\nknowledge of what the next morning's paper would contain.\nHe told me that he had just come from the newspaper office\nwhere he had been selecting tests as best he could from\nincomplete preparations for the paper. This is his explanation\nof knowledge in the one direction ;\nthat he is Alfred's brother\nshould sufficiently explain his knowledge in the other.\nSecond statement. I was to look close to Alfred's name for\nthat of a family with which we are connected by marriage.\nAt first sight this seemed to offer a somewhat wide range of\nchoice, but search down the column revealed only one name\nmeeting the case, and this was but two inches from Alfred.\nIn none of the columns could another be found ;\nthere was\nbut one and that one close to Alfred, the name of a family\nwith which we are connected through Alfred's wife.\nThird statement. Not far from Alfred's name he noticed\none announcement which was three or more times longer than\nthe others. Now, the average length was four or five lines,\nbut within four inches of Alfred was the longest of all no\nless than fifteen lines. The above three tests lay close together\nas though a small portion of the paper had been taken and\nsearch made for suitable tests within its narrow limits. Some-\ntimes the tests are scattered but usually there is a clump\nin one spot. A glance at The Times for the previous day\nshows that not a single reference would have been correct\nthen ; they were only right for the day stated.\nI had taken the precaution of calling upon a sceptical friend\nand giving him a copy of the tests on my way home from the\nsittings, thus securing evidence in case my accuracy as to\ndates and hours were challenged. Realising by this time that\nthese tests were likely to be continued I commenced to make\nduplicate copies, sending the second by post the same evening\nto the secretary of the Society for Psychical Research. Thus\ntwo persons have copies of these tests before the next morning's\npapers are issued, and this protects me against slips of memory\nor charges of inaccuracy.\nNovember 7th, 1919, at 3 p.m.\n\"\nIn The Times for to-morrow, about one-third down the second\ncolumn of the first page, is the name of your wife's mother, and\nA2\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

They are Mary and Alice (my wife's\nmother and sister).\n\"\nAbout two inches lower is the name of someone belonging to\nyour wife's mother in South Africa.\"\nThree and a half inches below appears the name Norman,\na grandson then residing in Durban, Natal.\n\"\nThere is also a word or name which suggests an animal to\nhim. This and the first two names are all within the space of\nfive-eighths of an inch.\"\nThe first three letters of Sowerby in the next notice bring\nto mind a familiar quadruped, and this .name and the previous\ntwo are even closer together than stated ;\nfor a square half inch\nof the paper contains all three.\nNovember 21st, 1919, at 3 p.m.\nAfter allusion to something one-third down the second\ncolumn the test continued,\n\"\nAlso in the near vicinity is the\nname of a place in which Mr. Hine resided.\" We had been\nconversing at a previous sitting about this gentleman who,\nforty years ago, was the personal friend of my father and a\nprominent official in his church at Baldock in Hertfordshire.\nAs he had long ago removed to London I was uncertain\nwhat place might be intended and was interested next morning\nto find at the top of the second column the old and familiar\naddress, Baldock, Herts.\n\"\nTo strengthen the test he tells\nyou that something in conjunction with the above made him\nthink of a person's name. It will strike you.\"\n*\nIt did.\nThe next words following Baldock, Herts were Funeral at\nGolder's Green. Here Green is a place-name, but it at once\nbrought to mind the way in which, as a personal name, it\nhad been used from time to -\ntime during my long series of\nsittings. It was the name of a gentleman well known to us\n1\nThis sentence was inadvertently omitted in the copy of my notes sent to\nthe S.P.B.\n\fMAT, 1921. Newspaper Tests. 93\nboth. Baldock and Green absolutely met the requirements of\nthe reference.\nAfter describing where, in column three, my mother's name\nwould be found he continued :\n\"\nVery close to it your uncle Alfred is named, also there is\nthe name of one in whom he is very interested.\"\nOn a parallel line were the names Thomas William, being\ntwo out of the three of my uncle Alfred William Thomas.\nThis is a little way down the first column, while two inches\ndistant in column two is the name of Alfred's eldest daughter\nFlorence. None of these would have been right for the\npaper of the previous day.\nDecember th, 1919, at 12 noon.\nThis sitting was earlier than usual and one of the first\nremarks made respecting the tests was that they had been\nselected when preparations for the next day's issue had not\nprogressed so far as usual. Recollecting this the change in\nposition of the following test-name is specially interesting.\n\"\nOn page one and column one, about two inches from the\nbottom, he thought he saw clairvoyantly the name Hutchinson.\"\nAt first I had written this as Hutchison, but on spelling it\naloud was told to insert an\n\"\nn\n\"\nafter\n\"\ni\n\"\nmaking it Hutchin-\nson. Searching next morning in the spot named I failed to\nfind it, but turning from the bottom of the first to the top\nof the second column discovered it there in the corrected\nform, Hutchinson. A moment's consideration will show how\neasily this notice may have been transferred from the one\nplace to the other after the hour of noon on the day previous\nto publication ; for, as I am informed, alterations may be\nle up to within a short time of printing at 11 p.m., and\nthe insertion of a few more birth and marriage announcements\nwould have been sufficient to account for the changed position\n)f this notice. It is in the third notice from the top.\nIn column two, about two-thirds down the page, he saw the\nle Louisa connected or linked with the name of another\nmember of our family ; he means in the same advertisement.\"\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1021.\nNote here the evident knowledge that Louisa is a member\nof\n\"\nour family\n\"\n;\nthere had been no previous mention of\nthis name in any of my sittings. She is a niece of the\ncommunicator, being another of Alfred's daughters. Slightly\nmore than two-thirds down the first column (not the second\nas stated ;\nthere is again some inaccuracy as to position),\nthe name Louise is found (my cousin's name is spelled Louisa).\nAnd in the same notice appears my father's name, John.\nThus names of niece and uncle are together.\nAfter speaking of something higher up the first column he\nproceeded :\n...\" Close to it is a direct reference to your mother ;\nher\nname is given ;\nbut there is also a further reference to her. It is\ndifficult to express it, say a name linked with her in another\nway.\"\nThe first assertion is especially interesting because the name\nJane is there, a name which my mother only uses in her\nlegal signature, one which only the inner circle would recognise\nas belonging to her. The second part of the test is met by\nthe appearance of the name Mrs. Thomas less than an inch\nbelow, while in the same notice with Jane is John, my father's\nname.\nFebruary 27th, 1920, at 3.30 p.m.\n\"\nAbout the middle of column one there is named a place of\nwhich your mother was very fond in her girlhood.

My wife had an aunt Frances now passed over.\n\"\nFold the page across so as to divide it into equal halves\nright and left, and in the first complete column beyond the crease,\n\fMAY, 1921.\nNewspaper Tests. 95\nto the right, and less than a quarter down, is a message from\nhim to mother.\" (I asked,\n\"\nHow shall I be sure which it is ? \")\n\"\nClose to it is a name or initials which would fit very well.\"\nExactly where stated is an advertisement in which occur\nthe words,\n\"\nPortland . . . Anxious to get in touch,\" and in\nthe adjoining parallel advertisement is the following line twice\nrepeated, \"\/.TF. and D. and I.W.T.\" All this fits peculiarly\nwell. One of my father's early circuits was Portland ;\nwe\nalways think of it in connection with things he told us about\nhis residence there, and we have no associations with it apart\nfrom him. That he is anxious to get in touch with mother\nis clear from his frequent allusions and messages to her in\nthese sittings. The initials are applicable. His name was\nDrayton and when living in the Isle of Wight he married,\nand my mother's maiden name was Dore. Thus the initial\nreference may be interpreted either as\n\"\nIsle of Wight and\nDrayton, and Isle of Wight and Thomas \"\nor, indicating\nmy mother's change of name there,\n\"\nIsle of Wight and Dore,\nand Isle of Wight and Thomas.\"\nMarch Uth, 1920, at 2.48 p.m.\nAt this sitting I was accompanied by a Clergyman who\nwas unknown to Mrs. Leonard and whose name was\nnot mentioned. He came with me because a few weeks\nearlier I had received messages of a fragmentary character\npurporting to come from his wife, and it seemed possible that\nin his presence something more might be forthcoming. The\nfollowing tests were for him and were said to be given by\nhis wife.\n\"\nNear the top of column two, first page of to-morrow's Times,\nthe Christian name of the lady who comes with this gentleman.\"\nFour inches from the top of the column was the name Anne\n(aria. My friend told me during our return journey while\nwere discussing these tests that his wife's name was Annie\n, Mrs. Leonard's Control had more than once remarked\nthe difficulty she experiences in distinguishing between\nm, Anne and Annie, as they sound or seem to her so much\nalike. I have noticed this difficulty with other mediums also.\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1921\n\"\nClose to it is this gentleman's Christian name. These are\nclose together, possibly within half an inch.\" Here I asked my\nfather,\n\"\nHow do you know these names ? I do not know them\nmyself !\n\"\nThe Control replied,\n\"\nHe did not know them, but\nthis lady went with him to look them out. If correct she will\ngo again and look out others. It makes a still better test when\nyou do not know the names.\"\nImmediately following the above two names came The Rev.\nFrederick. My friend's name is Frederic (without the\n\"\nk \").\nThese names appeared upon adjoining lines within half an inch\nas stated.\n\"\nAbout one-third down column two is the name of a place\nat which this lady lived and which she liked.\"\nWishing to be in a position to examine these tests next\nday I asked during our return journey what towns would\nfulfil this assertion. The Rev. Frederic named two which\nwould meet the test. One was the home of her childhood and\nthe other Cambridge. He included the latter because, although\nhis wife had not actually resided there, she had frequently\nstayed on long visits to her uncle, a University Professor,\nand was greatly attached to the place. One-quarter down\nthis column appears Cambridge.\nThese three tests so confirmed were accepted by my friend\nas indications that his wife was in touch with us. She had\ngiven her name and his in an unmistakable way, and named\nthe place which he knew to be associated in her mind with\nmost pleasant recollections. Many other evidences of her\nidentity were given, both then and at a subsequent interview\nwith Mrs. Leonard, but the above may suffice for our immediate\npurpose. They are certainly difficult to explain on any\nsupposition other than that of communication from the spirit\nside of life. None of the facts could have been known to\nMrs. Leonard, who saw my friend for the first time and did\nnot know his name.\nI now proceed to an incident which still further rules out\nany hypothesis of telepathy from minds on earth. When\ncommencing a conversation on March 26th, 1920, I explained\nto my father that owing to absence from home it would be\n\fMAY, 1921. Newspaper Tests. 97\nimpossible to keep my appointment for that day fortnight and\nthat I would send a friend. I gave not the slightest clue\nas to who it would be, but had arranged to let a medical\nman have the interview, hoping that he might get into com-\nmunication with his brother. I was not a little surprised\ntherefore when my father replied that he would be present\nand bring my friend's friend with whom he had already\nattended one sitting. I understood the reference ;\nfifteen\nmonths previously I had accompanied this doctor to a clair-\nvoyante, and although nothing of interest transpired there\nmy father had alluded to the occasion when next I spoke to\nhim at Mrs. Leonard's, saying that he had been present and\nnoticed my friend's friend trying unsuccessfully to impress\nthe clairvoyante with his thoughts. It would therefore seem\nthat my purpose to send this Doctor was already known to\nmy father. By no normal means could Mrs. Leonard have\nbeen aware of it, and the telepathy theory can scarcely be\ninvoked to explain what follows.\nApril 23rd, 1920, at 3 p.m.\nThe first set of tests given me on this date proved to be\nfor my medical friend from his brother, who had successfully\ncommunicated with him through Mrs. Leonard since my\nprevious visit.\n\"\nThe first set of tests are for your friend from his spirit\ncommunicator whose name is about half-way down the first\ncolumn of the first page of The Times for to-morrow.\"\nExactly half-way down that column appears the name\nDyson, which is correct.\n\"\nVery close to it is your friend's name or one almost similar.\"\nTwo and a half inches below Dyson is the name St. Andrew's.\nUntil receiving his comments upon these tests I had been\nunaware that his second name was Andrews.\n\"\nAlmost\nsimilar,\" the apostrophe makes the difference.\n\"\nA little below, say three-quarters down, is the name of a\nplace which they have visited together and much enjoyed.\"\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1921.\nDr. Dyson on inspecting the paper found at this spot a men-\ntion of Filey, a place where he and his brother had frequently\nspent holidays together.\n\"\nA little above is the name of a mutual friend of theirs.\"\nHe writes that almost immediately above the previous names\nappear Jones and Davies, and that either of these might be\nthe mutual friend.\n\"\nNear the top of column one is the name of a great friend\nwho has passed on and is with the spirit young man \"\n(i.e.\nwith the Doctor's brother).\nHis letter continues :\n\"\nThe first notice at the top of\ncolumn one contains the name Jack. This must be Jack\nNancarrow, he is absolutely the only great friend now passed\nover that I have. Moreover in all the first half of column\none there is no other name or surname whatever of any\nfriend of mine.\"\nOf all the above information I knew nothing save the\nfriendship with Nancarrow and the name Dyson. Clearly\ntherefore there had been no reading of my mind. Nor is it\neasy to see how, even had these facts been known to me,\nmind-reading could account for such piecing together and\naccurate selection from The Times as forms the peculiar feature\nof these tests. The information given for my two friends,\nthe Clergyman and the Doctor, was as surprising to them as\nit was unexpected by me.\nThe foregoing have been selected from among earlier tests.\nThe following are from more recent examples.\nDecember 10th, 1920, at 5.57 p.m.\n\"\nIn The Times for to-morrow, column two of front page and\nclose to the top, he thinks within an inch, is the name of a friend,\na man, whom you were helping lately.\"\nThere exactly was Leslie. I had recently been discussing\nbooks and other matters with Mr. Leslie Curnow, and only a\nweek before had spent an evening at his rooms in order to\n\fMAY, 1921.\nNewspaper Tests.\nstudy some psychic problems about which he was good enough\nto desire my opinion.\n\"\nVery close, almost in conjunction with it, is another name\nwhich will be an additional clue to him.\"\nPerpendicularly above the name Leslie, and separated only\nby a single line, was Queen-square. As Mr. Curnow is on the\nstaff of Light, the offices of which are at 6 Queen-square,\nthis is conclusive ; especially as I have rarely met him any-\nwhere else than at this address. But since both the above\nnames were embodied in the section headed\n\"\nIn Memoriam,\"\nit seemed necessary to discover whether they had appeared\nthere on the same date in the previous year. I found that\nwhile Leslie had been there twelve months before, Queen-square\nhad not. Neither had they been inserted on the day when\nthe test was given.\n\"\nAbout three-quarters down column one are the names of two\nrelations of your wife whom he often sees on the other side.\"\nJust above three-quarters down this column appear together\nthe names Emilie Mary. My wife's sister was named Emily,\nand her mother Mary. Both have frequently sent messages\nto her at these sittings.\nJanuary 7th, 1921, at 6.50 p.m.\n\"\nIn The Times for to-morrow, page one and a little above half-\nway down column one, is the name Edward, also very close\nhe thought there was an address of a rectory, or parsonage,\nor place connected with a church.\"\nThis was exact. Less than three inches above the half of\nthe first column appears Edward and in the same advertise-\nment on the next line but one is Scrivelsby Rectory.\nAfter a reference to something in the upper part of column\ntwo he added :\n\"\nQuite close is my name and that of another on my side\nthe family.\"\nOne inch above a quarter down this column, and in the same\nnotice, appear the names John, and Mary (his sister).\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1021.\nJanuary 20th, 1921, at 3.45 p.m.\nAfter an allusion to something four inches down the third\ncolumn of the usual front page of The Times he proceeded :\n\"\nA little above is a name which was well known in the family\nin former days, and just about the same place is a name given\nin abbreviated form, one well known in the family too.\"\nThis is perfectly met by the name Benjamin which appears\none inch from the top, and by the letter\n\"\nC \"\nin the top\nline. It is a capital\n\"\nC \"\nstanding by itself and evidently\nintended by the inserter to represent a person's name. We\nhave long used it thus in our family.\n'\nIn the upper part of column two is named a place in which\nyou lived when you were connected with conditions in which\nMargaret would be specially interested.\"\nTwo inches from the top is \"7. of TF.\" When living there\nI was engaged in the same kind of business as that pursued\nby Margaret's father in his earlier life. There is clear hint\nof identity here, for it was only by referring to family letters\nthat I discovered this fact about my aunt Margaret's father,\nwhereas it would have been well known to my father.\n\"\nVery close is named a second place which you knew well\nwhen living at the first place ; you would go to it, hear of it,\nand think of it.\"\nThe next word was Ventnor and the reference is correct.\n\"\nA little lower something made him think of golf ;\nhe did\nnot look for it, but suddenly found himself so thinking, the\nwords made him do so.\"\nFour inches lower in the parallel column is the phrase,\n\"\nOut of bounds !\n\"\nAlthough my father did not play golf\nhe may have heard the expression from me ;\nI not infrequently\nhave need to make this observation when golfing !\nFebruary tth, 1921, at 6.20 p.m.\nIn The Times for to-morrow, column two, page one and one\nquarter down, there is a saint's name which belongs to a member\n\fMAY, i\n(\n.2i.\nNewspaper Teste. 101\nof my family, not John. Its owner is with me and I often see\nhim.\"\nOne quarter down is James, the name of father's uncle, who\ndied in 1879.\n\"\nVery close are two names strongly suggesting Roman Cath-\nolicism.\"\nLess than two inches above James appear the names, Costa\nRicci and immediately over the Ricci are the letters R.I.P.\nThe name Ricci is closely connected with the Jesuits, Lorenzo\nRicci having been General of the Society in 1759 and promin-\nent in activities which culminated in its expulsion from France.\nMatteo Ricci (1552-1610) was a prominent Jesuit missionary\nto China, and there were others. Costa was the celebrated\nItalian painter whose picture of\n\"\nThe Madonna and Child\nEnthroned\n\"\nis in the National Gallery. The letters R.I.P.\nnext these two names complete the suggestiveness ; probably\nno one conversant with the history of the Roman Church\nwould fail to be reminded of it by such a conjunction. My\nfather had made a careful study of the history of the Jesuits,\n\"\nAt the bottom of column one is Uncle Alfred's name, and\nclose by are certain words which would refer to his niece\n'\nE ',\nnot a name but words.\"\nFour and a half inches from the bottom of this column\nappear the names William Thomas. One inch below is notice\nof a death\n\"\nof heart failure,\" which connects with the recent\ndeath of his niece\n\"\nE \"\nby heart failure after an operation.\nIt will be noticed that while some of the above tests are\nmere statements of what will be in the morrow's Press, others\ngo beyond this, revealing intimate acquaintance with family\nconnections. Telepathy from the living is a theory which\nseems to break down in face of these experiments. Could\nsuch an hypothesis explain the method by which knowledge\nof our family became interwoven with forecasts from the next\nday's newspaper ? It is certain that many of these forecasts\nhave been correct, and whether they were obtained by normal\nor supernormal means is not the chief question ;\nfor a further\nline of information is apparent, information upon family\nmatters which even unimpeded access to the editorial office\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1921.\nof The Times could not give, and which the medium can\nscarcely be supposed to possess. The problem is this : How\ndo these two streams of knowledge become merged ? I have\nno doubt but that the spirit who speaks through Mrs. Leonard\nsucceeds in obtaining items from the preparations for the\nnext day's paper, and, already possessing full knowledge of\nour family circle, composes an amalgam of the two for the\nvery definite purpose of these experiments.\nIt may be said of these newspaper tests, as of the book tests\nwhich preceded them, that they were introduced by intelligence\nother than our own and neither asked for nor anticipated by\nus. They reveal that complete remembrance of family and\nother names which we should expect our friends to retain,\nbut which the limitations of ordinary trance mediumship\nafford them but small opportunity of demonstrating. They\nseem to overthrow the suggestion sometimes put forward of\ntelepathy from the sitter's mind. Stretch that hypothesis as\nwe may it can hardly account for the selection and bringing\ntogether of old memories and the morrow's Press ;\nnor does\nit explain the precise locating of names, and the assertion of\nconnections between these and facts unknown to the sitter.\nQueries as to fraud or collusion would seem to be out of\nplace here. In view of the hour at which the tests were\ngiven, and the kind of knowledge many of them display, we\nare safe in assuming the inadequacy of this supposition.\nIt is otherwise with the question of coincidence. Can\nchance explain ? I will indicate reasons for concluding that\nit does not.\nMany of the family names alluded to in this series of tests\nare sufficiently common to be assured of a place in every\nissue of The Times. Unless their position were somewhat\ndefinitely stated there would be ample room for coincidence.\nIt will have been noticed that the position is usually given\nwithin, at least, the margin of one quarter of a column.\nBut even so, with certain common names and even for the\nconjunction of two such, there might easily be chance cor-\nrespondence. Possibly because of this the communicator usually\nassociates such names with other items. When three or more\nstatements are linked together a coincidence, although still\npossible, is unlikely ;\nand if, over a long series of such linked\n\fMAY, 1921. Newspaper Tests. 103\ntests, verification continues to be steadily maintained, we\ngradually perceive that the happenings are not by chance.\nThis perception is hastened by the evidence that a considerable\nrange of familiarity with family relationships and events of\nlong ago is at the disposal of the communicator.\nIt is an easy matter to take a number of such tests seriatim\nand discover how far they will apply to issues of The Times\nfor other dates than those for which originally given. The\ncarrying out of such a comparison will do more than argument\nto show how small a part is played by chance in producing\nthe results.\nI have done this with the above fifty-three tests, looking\nfor each one in six issues of The Times selected at random.\nIn examining the result given below it will be noticed that,\nalthough considerable latitude as regards position was allowed,\nin no instance did this six-fold chance yield as many successes\nfrom one paper as did the original verification. The greater\npart of the coincidences related to common names, especially\nin such tests as could be met by the presence of any one\nout of some half dozen names ;\nas when searching for,\n\"\nA\nrelative of your wife\n\"\nor\n\"\nOne in whom Alfred is interested.\"\nSince two of the fifty-three tests described in this paper\nwere misplaced we get a total of fifty-one successes. Ex-\namining The Times of other dates for correspondences which\nwould result from chance only twenty-seven are found; and\nthis notwithstanding the fact that no less than six papers\nwere searched for each item. If the total for the six papers\nbe divided by six the result shows a fraction under thirteen\nas the average secured by chance, against the fifty-one obtained\nby my communicator. It is therefore clear that coincidence\ndoes not explain the facts.\nIt should be further noted that these chance correspondences\nare frequently less apt than the original verifications. And\nout of the chance successes about half relate to one or other\nof the common names, Mary, Emily, John, William, Thomas.\nIt seems fairly evident that had such tests been selected as\nexcluded all reference to common names, and had these tests\nalone been used for the comparison, the result would have\nbeen a reduction of the chance successes to near vanishing\npoint.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The first letter is as follows :\nPRINTING HOUSE SQUARE, E.G. 4,\nOctober IQth, 1920.\nThe small advertisements in the Times (which include Births, Deaths\nand Marriages) arrive at all hours of the day, and we commence setting\nthem at 5 p.m. I should think that often quite half of them are\nset before 8 p.m., and sometimes even a larger proportion than this.\nBeyond this, you may notice that many announcements are ordered\nto appear for two or three insertions. Consequently, some of them\nare in type for two days.\nIf you care to give me any particular instances, I will gladly make\nan enquiry.\nIn reply to the invitation contained in the last sentence of\nthe above letter. Sir William Barrett wrote asking for particulars\nconcerning the particular notice referred to above on p. 95, and\ngiven at a sitting when Mr. Drayton Thomas was accompanied\nby a friend the Rev. Frederic .\nThe reply from the manager of the Times ran thus :\nOctober 25th, 1920.\nIn reply to your letter of even date, I had the original copy of\nthe announcement referred to by the Rev. F. brought up to\n\fMAT, 1921. Newspaper Tests. 107\nme, and find that this was in the office by 9.27 a.m. of the morning\nof the 16th March, and was inserted the following day. By the time\nreferred to 4 or 5 o'clock of the 16th March, the copy had been\nset up for some considerable time, and of course had been seen by\nseveral members of our staff.\nMr. Drayton Thomas's sittings were held at various times\nbetween about 11.45 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. So that it would appear\nfrom the statement made in the first letter from the manager\nof the Times that at the time of the sitting the particular notices\nreferred to in the tests might in some cases be already set up\nin type ;\nin other cases they were probably not yet set up ;\nin any case their ultimate position' on the page could not be\nnormally known until late in the afternoon. We may therefore\nconclude that, quite apart from other evidence we have of Mrs.\nLeonard's honesty, the possibility of collusion or fraud may\nbe dismissed as inadequate to explain the facts. As to what\nmethods Mr. Drayton Thomas's\n\"\ncommunicators\n\"\nmay have\nadopted to acquire the knowledge necessary for their purpose,\nwe are unfortunately quite in the dark. These newspaper tests\ndiffer from book tests in this respect, that for some days at\nleast before a book test was given the books were all standing\nready in their shelves and, assuming clairvoyance, might at\n.any moment be clairvoyantly perceived.\nEEVIEW.\nThe Earthen Vessel. By PAMELA GLENCONNER. With a Preface\nby SIR OLIVER LODGE. (John Lane, 7s. 6d.)\nWe have in this book, which gives an account of eighteen\nbook-tests obtained by Lady Glenconner and nine by the Revd.\nCharles Drayton Thomas, at sittings with Mrs. Leonard, a\nvaluable contribution to the literature of psychical research. The\nostensible communicator of the tests is Edward Wyndham Tennant,\na son of Lord and Lady Glenconner. Nearly all of the items are\ngood, and some of a remarkably convincing character, as for\ninstance the following :\nFeda. \" Bim now wants to send a message to his Father. This book is\nparticularly for his Father ; underline that, he says. It is the ninth book\n. . . take the title, and look at p. 37.\"\nWe found the ninth book on the shelf indicated was Trees, by J. Harvey\nKelman. And on p. 36, quite at the bottom and leading on to p. 37, we\nread: \" Sometimes you will see curious marks in the wood; these are caused\nby a tunnelling beetle, very injurious to the trees. ...\"\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1921.\nThe point is that in pre-war days forestry was Lord Glenconner's\nchief interest, and it would have been a surprise to his family,\nwhen taking a walk with him, if he did not call attention to the\nravages made by this particular insect. For aptness and precision\nthe example would be hard to beat.\nThe precautions taken in identification of the books and passages\nare not set out with the particularity with which they are given\nin the Society's publications, but it was hardly necessary, and\nthere is no reason to doubt that all care was taken about this\nimportant detail of the experiments. The book is of great\ninterest, and there can be little doubt that it will do much to\nawaken extended interest in the inquiry ;\nfor the significance of\nthese tests is much more easily grasped by the general public\nthan is the case with cross-correspondences, the records of which,.\nit must be admitted, are sometimes very hard reading.\nIt seems at first blush as though the book-tests, of which we\nhave now a considerable number, made the evidence for survival\nmuch more convincing than it was before. Yet on the other\nhand it may be argued that the extraordinary clairvoyant power\nshown might possibly belong to the medium no less than to a\ndiscarnate spirit. It would be out of place to discuss this\nquestion here, but I will venture to remark that, while the\npossession of the power by a spirit after death is hardly less\nwonderful than its possession by one still in the flesh, the\nevidence at present seems to point to the\n\"\ncommunicators\n\"\nas authors of the tests far more strongly than to the medium.\nSome further light on the point might be obtained, if experiments\nwere made to see whether a medium can produce similar successful\nbook-tests without any suggestion from the sitter of a desire to\ncommunicate with a spirit, and without any claim by the medium\nto assistance from the spirit world. At the same time, it is\nnotoriously difficult to keep out spirits who want to come in,\nand it might be difficult to prove in the case of a successful\nexperiment of this kind that some spirit had not had a hand in\nthe business after all. In past times Hotspur and others have\nbeen sceptical to the point of rudeness about the possibility of\nraising spirits ;\nit may prove that the difficulty is rather in\n\"\nlaying\n\"\nthem, and the Percies may yet have to vail to the\nGlendowers.

JUNE, 1921.\nTHE GENESIS OF APPARITIONS.\nBY SIR W. F. BARRETT, F.R.S.\nIN the February number of the Journal of the American\nSociety for Psychical Research, appears an article by the late\nDr. Hyslop, entitled\n\"\nQuestion begging Explanations,\" in\nwhich he criticizes a suggested explanation of certain veridical\nphantasms which I have given in my book On the Threshold\nof the Unseen. The explanation I gave is not new and is\ncontained in the following words which Dr. Hyslop quotes\nfrom my book :\n\"\nIf we regard apparitions of the dying and\ndead as phantasms projected from the mind of the percipient,\nthe difficulties of clothes and the ghosts of animal pets, which\nsometimes are seen, disappear.\" I go on to explain that there\nis nothing improbable in this, as the appearances of the things\nwe see around us are in like manner phantasms projected by\nour mind into the external world. In the latter case the\ninverted retinal image of the object seen is not viewed by us\nas a photographer looks at the image on his ground glass\nscreen, but is transmitted to the brain, impresses certain\ncells and\n\"\nthen we mentally project outside ourselves a large\nerect phantasm of the retinal image . . . This phantasm is\nno more a real thing than is the visual image of ourselves\nwe see in a looking-glass.\" In like manner we -may conceive\nthat a telepathic impression made on the same brain cells\nmay cause a visual reaction and an image of the telepathic\nimpression\n\"\nwould be projected by our mind into external\nspace.\" In all cases it is not the eye which sees but the\nmind.\nDr. Hyslop remarks that he himself has often described\napparitions as telepathic phantasms produced by the influence\nof an outside mind, but he objects to my use of the word\n\"\nprojected\n\"\nbecause a\n\"\nprojected phantasm could not be\ndistinguished from the external reality, perhaps, unless we\nmeant to invoke internal causes for its nature instead of\nreality outside the subject.\" For a phantasm, he adds,\n\"\nis a\npurely subjective and not an objective phenomenon.\"\nNow an apparition of a distant person appears just as real\nas any external object, so far as the visual sense is concerned ;\n\fJNE, 1921. The Genesis of Apparitions. 113\nle difference being not only its\n\"\ninternal cause,\" but its\nranescent character and that its objectivity is\nusually not con-\nied by our other senses. It is very difficult to grasp what Dr.\n[yslop is driving at in his very long and involved criticism\nmy statement. Apparently it comes to this, that to speak\nthe projection outside ourselves either of the retinal image\nlade by an external object, or a telepathic impact on the\n>rain,\n\"\nis a misleading description of the process.\" \"It is far\nitter,\" Dr. Hyslop says,\n\"\nto use the term reference. We\nfer the cause of the phantasms to a point outside ourselves.\"\nhave not the least objection to this. Dr. Hyslop, however,\ntbours under an amusing and obvious misapprehension when\nsupposes that I used the word\n\"\nproject\n\"\nin the sense,\nquote his words, of flinging a\n\"\nprojectile into the space\noutside the body.\" The projection is of course a purely\nlental process and this requires a brief explanation.\nFew people are aware of the wonderful nature of vision. The\nibres of the optic nerve transmit to a certain part of the brain\nvast number of distinct and almost infinitesimal impressions,\nlade on the rods and cones of the retina of each eye, by\nle minute inverted retinal image of an external object. Here\nir actual knowledge ceases, but we are led to infer that these\nitinal impressions create a multitude of separate molecular\nlisturbances in a certain tract of brain cells, the optic ganglia,\nfothing could be more unlike the external object and yet\nir ego collects all these varied molecular -\nmovements into a\n)herent whole and forthwith projects, or refers according to\nr.\nHyslop, into external space a phantasm, a single erect\nlage of the object seen.\nExperience has taught us to project mentally each point of\nle retinal image along lines passing through and crossing\n3h other at the optical centre, or nodal point, of the eye ;\na point about three-quarters of an inch (16 mm.) from the\nretina. The image is in fact referred back along lines closely\ncorresponding to those which the light rays travelled when\nentering the eye. Hence the image or phantasm appears\nto be erect and of the same size and distance as the object seen.\nThis is the case with external objects, but the shadows on\nthe retina of minute objects within the eyeball, such as the\nmuscae-volitantes, and all entoptic phenomena, are not viewed in\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1021.\nthe place and of the size they really exist, but are seen as external\nobjects. The mind refers the retinal impression not along\nthe paths taken by the light rays, but projects the impression\nthrough the nodal point of the eye. just as if the minute\ninternal object were a large external object. The position\nand size of the image, or phantasm, is determined by the\nratio of the distance of the nodal point from the retina (16\nmm.) to the distance of that point from the surface against\nwhich the entoptic object is seen. For example, looking at\na window 1600 mm. (about 5 ft. 4 in.) from the eye, the\nentoptic object will be seen 100 times enlarged and located on\nthe window.\nThese entoptic phenomena (which are best seen through a fine\npinhole in a card held close to the eye) appear just as real\nand external as if\nthey were objects outside ourselves. A\nphantasm due to a telepathic impression no doubt arises in the\nsame way, and it would be interesting to know what deter-\nmines its size and location. Possibly recollection, and associa-\ntion of ideas, so that the phantasm of a distant person appears\nof the size and in the clothing we are accustomed to.\nThis brings me to the last point in Dr. Hyslop's article\nHe concludes by saying^ that his animadversions\n\"are only qualifications of inferences that might be drawn from his\n[i.e. my] statements and that his [my] idea of projection in visual\nperception has the defence that it describes the apparent nature\nof the facts.\"\nThat is all my statement means. The root of Dr. Hyslop's\ncriticism is the view he expresses at the conclusion of his\narticle, but in this view I entirely share. He remarks :\n\"We may yet ascertain that phantasms [apparitions of the dying\nor dead] have causes similar to the experiences of sense perception.\nIt is possible that the soul is a spiritual body or organism which\nduplicates in a transcendental sense the functions characteristic\nof the bodily senses ;\nand in that case phantasms represent a\nreality, though not a material one. In normal experience reality\nor objects are synthetic. That is, they represent the union of\nproperties that may simultaneously affect different senses. . . .\nIn phantasms this synthetic nature is not so common, and hence\nthey appear to be more closely related to ordinary illusions or\n\fJINK, H2i. The Genesis of Apparitions. 1 I r>\nillucinations, while their more complete development might show\nleni to be a replica in the ethereal world of what takes place\nthe material, and this view would completely remove the\njrplexities of the problem and show analogies between super-\n>rmal and normal perception. 1 am far from supposing there is\nevidence as yet for this.\"\nBut although this view certainly would not remove all\n;rplexities, such as the ghosts of clothes and animal pets,\nlevertheless Dr. Hyslop is mistaken in supposing that there is\nno evidence on its behalf. 1 consider that there is much\nevidence which cannot be explained away on behalf of an\nexcursive action of the soul, whether from a living person,\nin trance or sleep, or from a discarnate spirit. It may be\nthat we shall ultimately extend this latter view of apparitions\nmuch more widely than we do at present.\nL. 1231. CASE.\nA CASE OF INFORMATION CONVEYED BY AUTOMATIC WRITING.\nTHE following case was sent to us by Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson,\nwho has been a member of the Society for many years and\nwas until a few months ago a Member of the Council. The\nautomatist, Mr. King, has been well known to Mr. Dickinson\nand his family for many years.\nMr. King's first statement was made in a letter to Mr.\nDickinson thus :\nFINCHLEY, N.3., December 29, 1920.\nI promised to send you a few lines telling you of my first\nlutomatic writing.\nI was on war work and away from home, but on my visits\n>ut once every month my wife and I usually had a private\nsitting and in that way conversed with my brother (Will) who\nwas posted missing in August 1917.\nOne evening while writing a letter to my wife I was holding\nmy pen on the paper thinking whether there was anything else\nI wanted to say before finishing it, when the pen started to\nmove ; having seen automatic writing once some months before\ndone through a relative I was not surprised and asked if there\nwas anybody there who wished to write and the pen wrote\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1921.\n\"\nyes.\" I asked for a name and it then wrote\n\"\nWill\n\"\n(the\nname of a brother before mentioned). I then asked if he had a\nmessage for me ;\nthe pen then wrote\n\"\ngarden seat at drains,\"\nit seemed a funny message I couldn't make anything of it, but\nsent it on to my wife ;\nshe could not solve it.\nAbout six months later we had a postcard through the post,\nfrom an old friend of my brother's (Mr. U )\nwho had lived\nin the next house to him (on joining the army my brother let\nhis house and stored the furniture at two addresses, that we\nknew of). The card asked if we knew that Willie had asked a\nMr. Drain (who was then in the army and had lived near Will)\nto take care of a seat for him. Mr. U. offered to see Mr. Drain\nwhen he was next home on leave and asked him to look the seat\nout, if we approved.\nWe thanked Mr. U. and felt sure that was the seat my brother\nwished us to know about.\nA few weeks later Mr. U. had reason to send some things by\na cart to an address near to us, and sent the seat along to our\nhouse at the same time.\nThe only error is that it is a heavy mahogany hall seat and not\na garden one, though my brother may have used it as such. It\nis now in my hall and a very substantial piece of evidence of\nhuman survival.\nYours faithfully,\nH. KING.\nI am sorry that I destroyed the original writing, but can\nvouch for the truth of the above. CLARA H. KING.\nOn receiving this communication Mr. Dickinson wrote a\nletter to Mr. King, putting certain questions which are in-\ncorporated in Mr. King's reply, which we quote below :\nFINCHLEY, N.3., January 18, 1921.\nI am sorry for the delay in answering yours of the 5th, but I\nhave not been able yet to get an introduction to Mr. Drain.\nI have never seen him arid do not know his address. So I will\nnow answer your questions.\n(1) Date of your writing ?\nAns. About July 1918.\n(2) Did you know at the time or had you ever known the name\nof Mr. Drain ?\n\f*\n:\n1921. Case. 117\nAns. No, I never heard the name till Mr. U - wrote to say\n[r. Drain had a seat belonging to my brother.\n(3) Did you know anything about the existence of the seat before\nir writing ?\nAns. No, I did not know my brother had it.\nI will try and get in touch with Mr. Drain and if successful\nII write you again.\nI quite understand re subconscious memory, but that was quite\nipossible under the circumstances.\nH. KING.\nOn reading these statements Mrs. Salter wrote to Mr. Dick-\n>n asking him to get further information, if\npossible, which\nkindly did.\nHer] letter to Mr. Dickinson was as follows :\nIt would evidently be impossible to prove that Mr. King's\nbrother had never mentioned Mr. Drain to him, or the fact that\nMr. Drain was keeping one of his things. But if it is a case of\nsubconscious memory, it is curious that no conscious recollection\nwas aroused in Mr. King's mind when he wrote the\n\"\nmessage.\"\nOne would of course like to get a statement from Mr. Drain\nthat (1) he was given the seat to keep by Mr. King's brother,\nand (2) that he had had no communication about it with Mr.\nKing and did not know Mr. King.\nMr. King says in his second letter to you that he did not\nknow his brother had this seat. But I suppose he had been to\nhis brother's house and may have seen it there ? Could you\nuestion him on that point ?\nIt might also be worth asking whether Mr. and Mrs. King\nmentioned the receipt of the automatic writing to any one who\ncould confirm its having been received before they had any\ncommunication with Mr. Drain or Mr. U .\nSubsequently Mr. Dickinson forwarded to us a further\netter received from Mr. King, which ran as follows :\nFINCHLEY, N.3., March, 1921.\nI am sorry to have been so long in replying to yours of the\n2nd which contained a letter from Mrs. Salter asking if I could\nget certain proofs, etc., re automatic writing. I have been able to\nget them, and am enclosing herewith a letter from Mr. Drane J\n1\nNote change in spelling and see postscript to letter. ED.\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1921.\nand also one from some friends who lived near to where Mrs.\nKing was staying in Bucks when I received the writing at Enfield.\nI did not know my brother had the seat as I did not visit\nhim. I did cycle over one Sunday, but they were out and I\nreceived no answer. At that time I was living at Enfield, a cross-\ncountry journey from Finchley, where my brother lived.\nI think this answers all Mrs. Salter's questions, but should\nthere be any further questions I shall be pleased to answer them.\nH. KING.\nP.S. You will note that the spelling in the name of Mr. Drane\nis different from the writing. H. K.\nEnclosed with Mr. King's letter were (a) a letter from\nMr. Drane to Mr. King, (6) a letter from Mr. and Mrs. R\naddressed to Mrs. King, to the effect that she had shown\nthem the automatic writing before she or Mr. King knew\nanything about Mr. Drane. We quote these letters below :\nFINCHLEY, N.3., February 23, 1921.\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th inst., it is the fact that\nbefore he went to the Front, and when he was dismantling his\nhouse, your brother left a mahogany seat in my charge, with\nother articles. Further, it is\nquite true that I never had any\nconversation with you on the subject ; and, indeed, had not the\npleasure of knowing you.\nFRANCIS J. DRANE.\nWINSLOW, February 28, 1921.\nDEAR MRS. KING,\nMy wife and I remember a conversation we had with\nyou on the subject of Spiritualism in the summer of 1918, when\nyou visited us at our cottage in Winslow.\nYou then told us you had had a message from Mr. King's\nbrother (who had previously passed into the\n\"\nbeyond \"), the\npurport of the message being that you were to have a garden-seat\nthat had been his. We are interested to learn of the fulfilment\nof this communication, as at the 'time of the message you were\nquite ignorant that you were to be the recipient of any such\narticle. F. M. R.\nI can also testify as to the foregoing being entirely accurate.\nN R\n(Wife of F. M. R ).\n\ft.1,,\nCoDespondence.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nA REMARKABLE CASE OF PRECOGNITION.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMarch 1, 1921.\nMADAM, Mrs. Chester-Masters, the lady who tells this story,\nlas been a near neighbour of ours now for the best part of a\nyear, and I have had many conversations with her. She is an\nunusually clear and accurate thinker, her memory is excellent,\nand her integrity beyond question. This is what she has written\nfor me :\nAbout thirty-five years ago my little boy George, then five years\nold, ran into my bedroom one morning, at about 8 o'clock, crying\n\"\nMother, mother, I've had such a dream ! Edith [his younger sister]\nand I were out for our walk with Nanny [their nurse]. We had all\nthe four dogs out with us, and one of them killed a duck, and we\nthought it was Frou-frou [the poodle], and the duck came swimming\ndown the brook with its head under water.\"\nThe child was in a state of great excitement, and insisted on telling\nhis dream before saying his prayers, which according to his daily custom\nwas the first thing done on coming into my room. They went out for\ntheir walk at 11 o'clock, and on their return both children came tearing\ninto my boudoir frightfully excited, and called out,\n\"\nMother, it's all\ntrue ! One of the dogs killed a duck, and it was Frou-frou, and the\nduck came swimming down the brook with its head under the water.\nIsn't that wonderful ?\n\"\nTheir story was confirmed by the nurse in every detail.\n(Signed) M. CHESTER-MASTERS.\nMrs. Chester-Master's daughter Edith was asked a few days\n;o whether she remembered the occurrence, and she replied\nthat she remembered it perfectly. The son George is not now,\nI believe, in England. It is unfortunate that no written record\nwas made at the time, but this does not seem to me to impair\nthe evidence in the least. The occurrence has always been\nremembered in the family for its four essential features :\n(1)\nit was pictured in a dream before it took place ; (2) one of the\ndogs killed a duck ; (3) this dog was Frou-frou, the one that\nhad been specified, though doubtfully ; (4) the duck floated down\nstream with its head under water.\nIn reply to an enquiry Mrs. Chester-Masters told me that she\nnever remembers the dog chasing ducks at any other time, and\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1921.\nhad he done so she would be sure to remember as she kept\nducks herself at the time.\nAnother of Mrs. Chester-Masters' daughters has psychic gifts.\nShe writes :\nOn the 7th of March, 1919, I left my home at Berkhampstead just\nafter 8.0 a.m., to go by train to London for a day's shopping. I\nhad a great many things to get, and I did not intend to do anything\nelse but shopping. When I got out of the train on to the platform\nat Euston something almost a voice said to me,\n\" Leave your shop-\nping, and go home (that is, as I understood it, to my father and\nmother) as quickly as possible ; something is wrong.\" For a few\nminutes I walked on and tried to take no notice of it, as I had such\na lot to do, and knew it would take up so much time, going to the\nend of London. But it was no good ; the presentiment that something\nwas wrong became stronger. So I went down to the tube and went\nhome as quickly as I could.

THE CASE OF CHARLEY L .\n(a) Extract from the Rev. W. S. Irving 's\nSitting with\nMrs. Brittain, July 19, 1920.\n[This was the first sitting Mr. Irving had with Mrs. Brittain.\nHe made the appointment under a pseudonym and gave as his\naddress the Rooms of the Society, of which he is a member, so\nthat the medium should have no clue to his identity. The pur-\nporting communicator during the greater part of Mr. Irving's\nsitting was his wife, and a good deal of evidence of identity\nwas obtained. The records in this and in the subsequent sitting\nare quoted from the notes made at the sitting.]\nMRS. BRITTAIN (in trance). Is her [communicator's] sister Lizzie\nor Lily ?\nW. S. I.

BRITTAIN. There is a special boy here passed over in the\nwar, called Charley. He was in the choir. He was not\na tall boy, rather squat, rather delicate. They took\nhim three times to - -\n[no name given], they took him\nfor clerical work and then put him in the trenches.\nW. S. I. In what parish did he work ?\nMRS. B. Sounds like St. Michael's W, Wish Wis it begins\nwith W. He comes to ask Lizzie. Do you know Lizzie,\nLizzie, Lizzie B. ? A relation, a sister-in-law or sister.\nW. S. I. You said that before.\nMRS. B. Her sister. There is a sister Elizabeth, Sister Betsy,\nElizabeth. The boy is connected, or a personal friend\nof Sister Elizabeth.\nW. S. I. Is Sister Elizabeth on their side ?\nMRS. B. On their side, on their side (vaguely muttered). This\nboy used to have a long taper and light the candles in\nchurch. Looked like an angel in white robes, she says,\nbut was not an angel inside. He was white outside,\nshe says, but black inside. He had rough, red hair.\nThe people were in church at the time he used to light\nthe candles. That's not right, must light the candles\nbefore the people come. No, she says, light the candles\nwhen the people were in church. He used to walk up\nlike a little cherub. She says when you remember it\nwill be something to put the cap on.\nIt will be observed that at the first sitting on July 19,\n1920, a reference to a supposed sister of the communicator\ncalled Lizzie or Lily is followed almost immediately by a\nreference to a choir-boy called Charley. Commenting upon\nthese statements in his notes to the sitting Mr. Irving says\nthat of his wife's four sisters none was called Lizzie or Lily\nand that the choir boy Charley is unidentified. At the\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.\nsecond sitting, on September 21, 1920, a good many further\ndetails are given concerning Charley, including a statement that\nhe worked in St. Michael's Parish, and Lizzie, who in the\nfirst sitting appeared as a sister of the communicator, emerges\nas a Sister Elizabeth connected in some way with Charley.\nCommenting upon this Mr. Irving says ;\nWe used to know a Sister Elizabeth. I have not seen her\nfor six years, nor had I heard of her for some time. She was\nconnected with a church, St. Michael's, Wheatcroft. I wrote\nto her asking if she knew a choir boy server at St. Michael's,\ndescribed as above. She answered by post card : \"I do not\nremember anyone of that description, but I am making full\nenquiries and will write.\" A week later she wrote : \"I rather\nthink I have found the clue, Charley L -\n[name of the regi-\nment given]. They heard he was killed, but nothing more. . . .\nHe had the hair you described and, I believe, was threatened\nwith lung trouble.\n[Mr. Irving continues.] The candles at St. Michael's are lit\nas described. Years ago I was connected for a short time with\nthat church myself.\nThis last statement Mr. Irving amplified in a letter to\nMiss Newton, dated September 27, 1920 :\nMy wife and I were associated with that church [St. Michael's,\nWheatcroft] for three months in about 1909, so the boy [Charley]\nmight know us. I was Curate (temporary) there.1\nAs it now appeared that the whole incident might be of\nconsiderable interest and importance, Miss Newton, who had\nbeen in communication with Mr. Irving, urged him to obtain\nfurther corroboration if\npossible. This Mr. Irving proceeded\nto do, giving himself much trouble in the matter, fortunately\nwith satisfactory results.\nA considerable number of letters received by Mr. Irving are\nin our possession, but it does not appear necessary to include\nthem all\nin'Jthis report. An element of confusion was intro-\nduced at one point by the fact that in one letter a description\nof Charley L was given which did not altogether tally\nwith other descriptions, including that which was given at\n1\nIt was subsequently ascertained that Charley L had left Wheatcroft\nbefore Mr. Irving went there (see below).\n\fThe Case of Charley L . 125\n: :\nthe sitting of September 21, 1920. But the writer of this\nletter, according to his own statement, only\n\"\nknew slightly a\nyoung man named Charley L ,\" and it appears to be\nuncertain whether he was describing Charley or one of his\nbrothers. By far the most important and detailed statement\nabout Charley was received from Mr. C. H. Fletcher, a lay reader\nat Scarborough, who was well acquainted with him for many\nyears. Mr. Fletcher's statement, which is quoted in full\nbelow, was written in the form of replies to a series of ques-\ntions put to him by Mr. Irving. His statement was enclosed\nin a letter to Mr. Irving dated November 13, 1920.\nMR. FLETCHER'S STATEMENT.\nNovember 13, 1920.\nDid you know Charley L if\nVery well indeed.\nDid he attend St. Michael's Church, Wheatcroft? Yes.\nWas he in the Choir ? Yes, as boy and young man.\nDid he light the Altar Candles '\/\nVery often on Sunday Evenings.\nAbout how long did you know him for ? From being a boy of\nabout 11 or 12 until he left England for the last time, a\nmonth or two before he was reported missing.\nWas he tall, short, or medium in height? Medium height.\nStrong or delicate ? Not very strong, but could not exactly be\ncalled delicate.\nWhat colour was his hair ? Reddish sandy colour.\nDo you know what date (approx.) he left Scarborough ? Not exactly,\nbut about 14 or 15 years ago for Canada.\nWhere did he go to ? Worked at Calgary as a joiner at first,\njoined the S. Andrew's Brotherhood and was very keen on\nmy starting it at S. Martin's, often writing to me on the\nsubject. Later on did some farm work.\nWas he called up when war broke out ? Joined and came over\nwith a Canadian Regiment (I believe of Engineers).\nDo you know what happened to him? Was, I believe, given some\nkind of office work at intervals, but from what he told me\nhad had a rather rough time altogether.\nWas he killed ? So I was told missing according to W.O. tele-\ngram.\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.\nHave you definite proof of the last point [i.e. of his beiny killed}?\nNo.\nAnything else you may remember about him ? He was always a\nnice lad and when a boy not good looking, just a freckled,\ntousely haired mischievous youth, but thoroughly good and\ndependable, and when he grew up was much the same only\nbroader and more manly. A most kindly affectionate fellow.\n[Signed] C. HARTLEY-FLETCHEK.\nA statement about Charley L was also obtained from\nthe Rev. A. S - thus :\nOctober 26, 1920.\nI knew Charles L --\nvery well, as he was out in Canada,\nat Calgary, when I was in S. Alberta, and he often used to\ncome and see me when I went up to Calgary. He was a thin\nred-faced young fellow with sandy hair and pale eyes and slow\nof speech with a strong E. Riding accent. ... So far as 1\nremember he was never a server at Wheatcroft. Albert F\nwas the only server, though Charley L -\nfrequently went to\nchurch at St. Michael's.\nIt will be seen that Mr. S 's letter corroborates Mr.\nFletcher's in regard to the colour of Charley's hair. As to\nMr. S 's statement that Charley was never a server at\nWheatcroft, i.e. the boy who lit the altar-candles, Mr. Irving\nin his letter\nofj\nOctober 27, 1920, with which he enclosed\nMr. S 's letter, writes :\nAt the time Mr. S was in Scarborough, Charley was at\nthe Parish Church, not Wheatcroft. Fortunately the Lay-Reader\n[Mr. Fletcher] has corroborated the fact that he was a server\nat Wheatcroft, probably after Mr. S 's time. He (Mr.\nS )\nleft Scarborough in 1896. . . . One point in Mr. S- 's\nletter I consider most valuable. He corroborates my statement\n[made in an earlier letter, not quoted here] that there would\nprobably not be more than one server at a time at Wheatcroft,\nlessening chance as being a possibility enormously.\nWith regard to the element of doubt in regard to Charley\nL 's death, it appears to be humanly speaking certain\nthat he was dead at the time of Mr. Irving's first sitting ;\nhe\nhad been reported missing prior to that date. Mr. Irving\n\f{JULY, 1921. Caw: The Case of Charley L . 127\nreceived a letter from the present Vicar of St. Martin's,\nScarborough, stating that\n\"\nC. L.'s name is on (tin- Parish]\nmemorial-list at the request of his sister who is a parishioner.\"\nTo sum up :\nPutting together what was said at Mr. Irving's\ntwo sittings we get the following statement :\nThe purporting communicator is\nrepresented as anxious to\nbring to the sitter's notice a former choir-boy called Charley,\nnow dead. Concerning Charley it is said that\n(1) he was connected with a Sister Elizabeth ;\n(2) he went to the war, was missing and lost ;\n(3) they\n\"\ntook him for clerical work, and then put him\nin the trenches\n\"\n;\n(1) he was not a tall boy, rather squat, rather delicate ;\nhe had rough, red hair ;\n(5) he worked in a parish named St. Michael's connected\nwith a name beginning with the letter W, Wish ,\nWis ;\n(6) he used to have a long taper and light the candles\nin church in the presence of the congregation.\nAll these statements are confirmed more or less exactly by\nthe evidence about Charley L which Mr. Irving has\nbeen able to collect.\nCharley L - was a choir-boy in the Parish of St. Michael's,\nWheatcroft ;\nhe was also a server, i.e. he used to light the\naltar-candles ;\nhe was known to a Sister Elizabeth, who worked\nin the same parish. As to his appearance we are told by Mr.\nFletcher that he was of medium height, not very strong,\nbut could not be called delicate ;\nhis hair was of a reddish,\nsandy colour,\n\"\ntousely.\" According to Mr. S he\na thin young fellow with sandy hair. When the war\nbroke out he joined a Canadian Regiment, and came over\nto England. He \"\nwas given some kind of office work at\nintervals,\" went to the front and a month or two later he\nwas reported missing.\nAs to what part Mr. Irving's normal knowledge may have\nplayed in the matter, it is to be observed that Charley L\nhad gone to Canada some years before Mr. Irving's temporary\nconnection with St. Michael's, ^Wheatcroft, in 1909. Neither\nMr. Irving nor his wife knew anything about him. Mr.\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.\nliving's recollection of Sister Elizabeth was an important\nlink in verifying the various statements made at the sitting,\nbut beyond that it is difficult to see what part his mind\ncan have played. .\/ On the other hand it is extremely difficult\nto suppose that so many correct statements could have been\nmade by chance. If some further explanation than chance\ncoincidence is to be sought, two possible hypotheses present\nthemselves ; (1) that Mrs. Brittain obtained her information\ntelepathically from Mr. Fletcher at one, or perhaps two\nremoves, through the sitter, Mr. Irving, and Sister Elizabeth ;\n(2) that the alleged communicator had in fact got into touch\nwith Charley L - after his death and obtained her informa-\ntion from him.\nIn view of any question that might be raised concerning\nMrs. Brittain's bona fides, it is worth while to point out that\neven if Mr. Irving's anonymity had not been preserved,\na supposition for which we have no evidence at all, there\nwas still nothing to lead Mrs. Brittain to make enquiries\nat Scarborough. Mr. Irving's connexion with Scarborough\nwas short and long past. He now lives in Gloucestershire.\nL. 1233. II. THREE INCIDENTS AT SITTINGS WITH MRS. LEONARD.\nThe sitter on these occasions was a member of the Society\nwho is called here Mrs. Drummond. The records of the\nsittings are taken from Mrs. Drummond's contemporary notes,\nand her verification of the various statements made is corro-\nborated by her daughter and son-in-law (see below). Mrs.\nLeonard was, as usual, in trance and was\n\"\ncontrolled\n\"\nby\nFeda.\n(a) Extract from Mrs. Drummond's Sitting.\nFEDA. There is a brass jug something to do with a room, not\nconnected with that other room [a room in Mrs. Drummond's\nhouse in Edinburgh which had just been spoken of]. A\nbrass jug and something Japanese in that room, Ian [the\ncommunicator] keeps saying it, Ian is most obstinate. Little\npictures, design in this Japanese thing, design in this. He\nis laughing ; you you will see it almost immediately you get\nhome, quite quickly ; yellow stripes against something dark,\nyou'd never think of it, but you will find it. The room has\n\fJCLY, 1921. Case : Incidents at Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 1 20\n;\ntwo doors, not only the one you go in at, another into a\nsmaller room. The room has two windows (to communi-\ncator) sure not three, Ian ? Feda sees three, Feda's right,\nyes, they say three windows now ; they said two and showed\nthree. A good thing they says and shows too, you can see\nwhat they really mean.\nComment by Mrs. Drummond.\nThe day after the sitting I went to London to stay with my\ndaughter in a house which she had taken furnished for six months.\nI had never been in the house, as I had gone straight from\nEdinburgh to Datchet [where Mrs. Leonard was then living].\nWhen the description of the room was given, I thought Feda\nhad not given the message accurately, as she had been discussing\nmy house in Edinburgh and although she said it was\n\"\nnot\nconnected with that other room,\" I still thought of the Edinburgh\nhouse. When I got to my daughter's house in London, I never\nthought of examining any of the rooms till\nmy son-in-law said\nto me :\n\"\nAren't these curious Japanese pictures ?\n\"\nI at once\nthought of the description and examined the pictures. There\nwere two curious needlework pictures, one the figure of a Japanese\nman, the other of a Japanese woman, worked in yellow silk\non dark brown silk, the outlines of the figures worked in yellow\nsilk in large slanting stitches which from a distance looked like\n\"\nyellow stripes.\" The room had two doors, but only one was\nused ;\nthe other\n\"\ninto a smaller room\n\"\nwas blocked up by a\ntable and palm.\nThe\n\"\nbrass jug\n\"\nwas a large pewter jug which stood on the\nfloor almost opposite the door that was used, and would, probably\nbe seen at once by anyone entering the room.\nThe above verification is corroborated by Mrs. Drummond's\ndaughter, thus :\nI guarantee the above to be correct ;\nthe notes were read\nto me at the time. M. L.\nThe above incident had a sequel which is worth recording.\nMrs. Drummond sent her report of it to the Society on\nMarch 14, 1921, and on March 16, 1921, she had another\nsitting with Mrs. Leonard concerning which she wrote to\nMrs. Salter thus :\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.\nHAVANT, March 20 [1921].\nI don't know if the following sequel to the Japanese picture,\netc., will be of any use. I had a table sitting\n1\nwith Mrs. Leonard\non 16th March, 1921, and in the middle of the sitting she said :\n\"I see your son so clearly to-day and he is walking about the\nroom. Now he is going up to that little plant and touching\nit.\" (The\n\"\nplant\n\"\nwas a tiny rock garden or Japanese garden\nwhich stood on the piano.) I said :\n\"\nYes, I understand.\"\n(I have a small Japanese garden which since I left Edinburgh\nin January, 1920, has been kept for me there by an old house-\nmaid. About six weeks ago I sent for it and have it here\nnow.) Then Mrs. Leonard said :\n\"\nNow he is touching the\ncentre figure in the tapestry.\" We both looked at it and she\nsaid :\n\"\nno, it is the figure next the centre figure.\" This was\na figure of a Japanese or Chinese boy, and I said I understood\nwhy this was being pointed out, and the table, without anything\nmore being said about it, spelt out :\n\"\nIt isn't quite the same,\nbut near enough.\"\nMrs. Leonard knows nothing at all of the Japanese picture\ntest being sent to you and I didn't explain why the figure was\npointed out. It was most unexpected and very good. You\nprobably know the tapestry which is on the back of the piano\nin Mrs. Leonard's room. Mrs. Leonard knew nothing at all\nabout my Japanese garden, of course. L. D. [DKUMMOND].\n(b) Extracts from Mrs. Drummond's Sitting, March 9, 1919.\nFEDA. This is some one closely connected with the [Anthony] one\n[Mrs. Drummond's son-in-law], very close relation, order, bank,\nbank, keeps on saying something to do with the [Anthony]\none and the spirit at the sitting [Mrs. Drummond's son-in-law\nhad been at a\n'\ndirect voice\n'\nseance], Feda thinks it is\nthe name of a place, something bank. [Anthony] will help\nyou ;\nbank comes in, the older gentleman told him that.\n[Later in the sitting.] Or, or, or [written as pronounced],\nthis is something to do with a picture of [Anthony]. Noah\n(to communicator) do you mean Noah what was in the ark,\nIan ?) No. The gentleman told Ian about a picture of\n[Anthony] with an oar, taken some time ago, not lately. Ian\nsays it is useful to practise for tests.\n1\nAt a \"table sitting\" messages are received by tilting a table upon Mrs.\nLeonard, and the sitters put their hands ; Mrs. Leonard is not in trance.\n\fJULY, 1D21. Case: Incidents at Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 131\n[Later in the sitting.] A little while ago they were worried\nabout him [Anthony], a change Mrs. [MaryJ [Mrs. Drummond's\ndaughter] might not like. Somebody whose name begins\nwith B will have a good deal to do with the [Anthony] one,\nsomething to do with Russia. I can't get it, Ian says\nhe wants to make an assertion. Russia and [Anthony], some\nwork connected with his work, [Anthony] linked up with Russia.\n(To communicator.) Do you mean now, Ian ? Not at\npresent, may be more in the near future. [Anthony] should\nknow now.\nComment by Mrs. Drummond.\nI read these notes to my son-in-law when I got back to London\nthe day of the sitting. He said his father had been in a bank.\nNeither I nor my daughter knew this. His father, who had\nlived in Australia, died in 1883.\nMy son-in-law at this time was at the Admiralty, the Board\nof Invention and Research, and he had been told he might have\nto go out to Russia with some new mines. The name of the\nofficer associated with him began with B. This was very\n\"\nhush\n\"\nand had never been mentioned either to his wife or to me.\nCommander L. corroborates the above statements, and\nwith regard to the reference to a photograph of himself with\nan oar he writes ;\nI recognised a photoj of myself about 30 years before. Neither\nmy wife nor my mother-in-law had seen it. A. L.\n(c) Extract from Mrs. Drummond's Sitting, September 27, 1920.\nFEDA. This is quite lately, a little round box with something\nred in it. You were looking for it, you wanted it ;\nit was\nin your mind, a small round box and inside something\nred. He [the communicator] says :\n\"\nMum, I could make\nyou know what that is to-night.\" In the latter part of\nthis day Ian is going to remind you of a little round box\nwith red in it.\nComment by Mrs. Drummond.\nI knew the little box spoken of quite well. I thought my\nson had given it to my daughter and I would have liked to\nhave it, and often thought about it, but I couldn't understand\nhow it could have\n\"\nsomething red in it.\" It was a silver and\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.\ntortoise-shell box with no lining. When I got back to Havant,\nI saw the little box on the tea tray where it had never been\nbefore. I opened it and found it full of\n\"\nSargol,\" bright red\ntablets, supposed to fatten people. In my absence my daughter\nhad filled the little box with\n\"\nSargol.\" She had taken\n\"\nSargol\n\"\nbefore I left, so it was in the house but not in the box.\nThe above statement is corroborated by Mrs. Drummond's\ndaughter.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nON THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING NAMES THROUGH IN\nALLEGED SPIRIT COMMUNICATIONS.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, The above difficulty is a striking characteristic of very\nmany alleged spirit communications. The last chapter of Raymond\ntreats of it in an apologetic manner. A passage in Sir Conan\nDoyle's New Revelation suggests it may be purposely introduced by\nhigher intelligences in order to exercise the human faculties.\nWith all due deference I offer the opinion that this very difficulty\nhas, in a way, a certain degree of evidential value. In this\nmanner :\nA meaningless proper name is only a symbolic sound which\ncannot be conveyed by thought transference. Take the case of a\nChinaman who has forgotten his phonetic symbols and tries to\nwrite the sounds of a proper name. His ideographs do not\ndirectly serve the purpose, he has no means of representing sounds,\nand must necessarily go some very roundabout way to get at it.\nHis problem is roughly analogous to that of a mind trying to\nconvey a name without being able to create sounds that will\noperate the mechanism of the human ear.\nForms can be mentally communicated by concentration on mental\npictures. We mostly think in pictures; very often quite uncon-\nsciously. One method therefore for the communicating mind is\nto concentrate on the forms of the letters which serve as symbols\nof the sound. This seems to be often tried. That a high degree\nof concentration is needed seems to be shown by the frequency\nof incomplete names, as if the mind had conveyed only the part\nwithin the focus of concentration. A better way would be to\nconcentrate on one letter at a time. This seems to be sometimes\ndone. C. G. PALMER.\n\fCCCLXXVIIL VOL. XX.

W. dated\n25*7* August, 1919.\n[Were you thinking] of me on Sunday afternoon [24 Aug. 1919]\nI \\vccn 5 and G o'clock? . . . I'll tell you why I ask. I was\nuit at some friends and we were all chatting just the usual\nlalltea table talk when suddenly I distinctly saw you in front\nf mo, just looking at me in a whimsical way that you have,\nid I just got\nRegarding this as, at most, a subjective hallucination, I\ninfortunately kept only the above truncated extract from\n[iss F.'s letter, cutting out a portion in which I vaguely\nicmber she went on to tell me of her sensations and of\nic remarks on her appearance of her friends, who (I think)\nLW nothing. Some weeks later, however, I saw Miss F. in\njondon, and she then gave me, spontaneously, in the course\n)f conversation, an important evidential detail. I afterwards\nsked her to put this into writing, and she did so, in the\nfollowing letter, dated 2nd December, 1919 :\nDEAR MR. WALES, When I saw you in London on the 7th\nFov. last, I told you that, when I saw the apparition of you,\nwere wearing a green tie, that this struck me most of any-\nbhing about you and that I didn't like it.\nYou then told me that you always wore a green tie at home,\nilthough I had never seen you in it, because I only saw you\nLondon.\nI endorsed this on 3rd December, 1919 :\nIt is true that I was wearing daily at home, at the time of\nlisa F.'s experience, and still am, a green tie, and that she had\n10 opportunity of knowing this. The tie is all green and rather\nvivid shade.\nI. had met Miss F. only twice at the date of this incident, as\nlentioned in my contemporary note to the \"Wuthering Heights\"\nof approximately the same date (see Proc., Pt. LXXX.,\n159), both times in London, when I most certainly was\nlot wearing a green tie. I have never, within my recollection,\nrorn such a tie in London,\n\f136 Journal of Society \/or Psychical Research. OCT., 1921.\nII.\nExtract from, letter from, Miss F. to H. W., received\n23rd November, 1919.\nAnd then, strange to say, I got a sudden vision of you, and\nI asked you a question, which you answered rather slowly\n\"\nThat\nyou were worried about some papers that were not yours, but\nhad to do with some money and that you were responsible for.\"\nYou had an old golfing coat on, rather shabby.\nI endorsed this on the date of receipt :\nI have been wearing daily of late a very shabby old coat. It\nis provided with slits behind the shoulders for freedom when\nplaying golf. Some weeks ago I was rather bothered by the\nloss of the receipt for a share certificate, for which I was respon-\nsible as trustee. [Added 3rd December, 1919] I had suggested\nto Miss F. that, if she saw this apparition again, she should try\nto get it to tell her something evidential of identity.\n[Added 3rd May, 1921] My carelessness in losing the receipt\nreferred to caused considerable trouble. The Company required\nindemnities by Bankers and others, as well as by me, before\nthey would issue another certificate.\nI told Miss F. the substance of the above notes and asked\nher for further details of her experience. She replied as\nfollows (28th November, 1919) :\nAbout the old golfing coat, I really didn't like to say how\nit did look to me in the apparition, as I was so afraid of hurting\nyour feelings by even suggesting that it looked almost disreputable,\nbecause you are such a very tidy man ! Now with regard to\nthe time I saw you and noticed the coat as far as I remember\nit was Monday the 17th [Nov. 1919] and I was sitting alone\nin the house in my little sitting room and quietly knitting, and\nI suppose I was thinking about you, because I suddenly spoke\nthe question I told you of in my last letter. [Miss F. had told\nme that she had put a question to me, apparently vocally I\nthink, as to why I had not written and that the phantasm had\n\fr., 1921. Series of Apparent Telepathic Communications. 137\nimmediately supervened.] As usual, I particularly noticed the\ncoat. 1\nMiss F. had certainly never seen this coat.\nIII.\nIn this case, since no precise detail was given, I did not\ntrouble Miss F. to put her oral statement into writing.\nNote by H. W. dated tth February, 1920.\nOn Thursday, 22nd January, 1920, I met Miss F. in London.\nShe asked me, in the course of conversation, if I had a lot of\noak furniture in my house, saying that she had received an\nimpression that I had.\nI told her that I certainly had. I have probably, in fact, a\nconsiderably larger proportion of oak furniture than most people,\nfor an uncle of mine left me specifically all his oak furniture.\nMiss F. then added that she had not felt there was oak in my\nstudy at The Long House (which I left in September, 1919), but\nthat, since I came to Homewood, she had had the impression of\nme sitting in a room with oak furniture in it.\nI told her that this impression also was correct. My study at\nThe Long House was lined on two sides with fitment bookshelves\n. . . and was only lightly furnished otherwise, without any oak.\nMy present study, however, is a larger room, and I have three\nlarge pieces of oak furniture in it.\nIV.\nOn 10th July, 1920, Miss F., who had then left her house\nit Watford and was living near Uckfield, Sussex, said in a\nletter to me ;\n\"I had a curious experience last night. I did\na little with the old tie so that may account for the result.\"\n1\nCompare with these two cases Mr. Piddington's case, Proc., Vol. XVIII.,\np. 182 et seq., also Lady Troubridge's case, Journal, April 1921, p. 78 et seq.\nThe element common to all four cases is the spontaneous apparition of a\nliving person who was not, at the time, in any crisis or unusual emotional\nstate. In Mr. Piddington's case and mine, however, there was probably a sub-\nconscious desire to provide evidential matter, and in Lady Troubridge's the\nagent was almost certainly thinking of the percipient at the time, in connection\nwith the plan when the apparition was seen.\nMiss F. means by her last sentence, I think, that she particularly noticed\nthe detail which proved to be evidential.\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1921.\n(I had given her the old green tie mentioned in Case I., as\na\n\"\nrapport object.\")\nI asked her, in my reply, to give me particulars of the\nexperience to which she had referred. This she did in a\nletter dated, from the same place, 16th July, 1920, as follows :\nBefore I go further in that direction I want to tell you about\nthat sort of waking vision. It seemed to me I was sitting\nout in a lovely garden, in a place I didn't know, on a garden\nseat, when you came up to me. You seemed 'surprised to see\nme, for you said distinctly,\n\"\nWhat are you doing in this garden ''.\n\"\nand I said,\n\"\nOh, I was tired, and a Mr. Simms asked me to\ncome' in and rest, but I don't know where he has gone now.\"\nYou asked me what he was, and I said,\n\"\nDidn't notice him\nmuch, only he was dressed in dark clothes and wore a\n'\ndog\ncollar '.\"... I remember noticing in the garden a very jolly\nhammock. It was so very vivid that I thought it almost real.\nIt [is] rather strange, as I cannot recall anyone of the name of\n\"\nSimms,\" except some people of that name who have a shop,\nand I don't know if there is a Mr. Do you know anyone of that\nname ?\nThe name of the vicar of the parish in which my present\nhouse is situated (Grayshott) is Simms spelt as Miss F.\nspells it, not\n\"\nSims,\" as in the familiar names G. K. Sims,\nSims Reeves and Admiral Sims. I know him well by sight\nand voice, and my wife knows him personally and occasionally\nattends services at his church.\nBefore telling Miss F. that the name conveyed anything to\nme, I asked her two questions ; first, what she knew about\nGrayshott (I knew she was aware that there was a village\nof that name in the Hindhead neighbourhood) ; and, second,\nwhat grounds she had for regarding her experience as a\n\"\nwaking vision\n\"\nrather than a dream. She replied, on\n22nd July, 1920, as follows ;\n(i)\nI've never been in Grayshott in my life. I certainly\nremember asking you some time ago, when in town, if\nyou\nknew it, as by looking at a map I noticed it was somewhere\nin your neighbourhood, and at that time I thought of setting\nup some tea rooms, and I believe I saw in a paper a small\n\fi. Series of Apparent Telepathic Communications. 139\nbage to be had at a place called (Jrayshott. That is all\nknow about the place.\n(ii) About the vision or dream 1 had the other week it was\nnight after 1 had been in bed for some hours probably\nabout 2 A.m. I seemed quite awake, although I couldn't open\nmy eyes, at least I had difficulty in doing so when I was fully\nawake and the \"dream\" had passed. 1 certainly had been\ntrying to get into communication with you, and then, quite\nsuddenly, 1 was in a lovely garden, sitting on a seat, it \\\\a\nfull afternoon, and I could smell roses, and saw a tennis lawn\nand presently I looked up and saw you. You seemed surprised\nto see me and asked how I got there. I said,\n\"\nOh, a Mr. Sim m.,\nasked me to come in, as I was tired \"...\nBut what in the world has Grayshott to do with it ?\nIn a subsequent letter Miss F. added a detail suggesting\nthat she had been somnambulic during the night. It will\nbe noticed, as a somewhat curious feature of her dream or\nvision as to which her two accounts are consistent that\nher interview with the clerical looking Mr. Simms was riot\npart of it, but was merely a recollection. She told me, in\nthe dream, as it seems, something which had occurred before\nthe dream began ; suggesting that the object of the dream\nif one may so put it was the externalizing of this information,\nand the further information that I was connected with it.\nThe case, manifestly, is not evidentially watertight, since\nthe name could have been obtained from a clerical directory,\nor, possibly, from some local publication. It is, perhaps, barely\nnecessary to add that, personally, I have no doubt that\nMiss F. did not deliberately obtain the information in that\nway, and that, if she so obtained it casually, she had not the\nslightest recollection of the fact.\nV.\nIn this case I cannot quote as much of Miss F.'s original\nletter as would be desirable, for it is inextricably entangled\nwith private matter. I must, therefore, preface the extract\nI can give by saying that, on 4th October, 1920, I received\nfrom her a letter, dated 3rd October, in which she told me\nthat she had slept, the previous night, at the house of some\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1021.\nfriends in Watford friends of whose existence I had not\npreviously been aware. She added that her room at this\nhouse had contained two beds, a double and a single one ;\nthat she had got into the single one at night, and had found\nherself in the double one in the morning a circumstance\nmanifestly again suggesting somnambulism.\nThe main object of the letter, however, was to tell me\nthat, in the course of this night, she had had what she\nregarded as a waking sense of my presence auditory and\ntactile, but not, this time, visual. But since, as in the\nprevious case, and in contradistinction to I. and II., the\nexperience took place at night while she was in bed, there is\ndifficulty, to my mind, in distinguishing it from a dream.\nMiss F. does not appear, however, on this occasion, to have\nlost the sense of her actual environment, as she did in the\nSimms case. Her letter proceeds :\nOh, I was quite sure it was you, because I asked you to\nanswer me a question, and you did so. Whether the reply is\ntrue or not you alone can say. I said,\n\"\nI want to have some\nproof that it is you. Please tell me your wife's name ?\n\"\nAnd\nyou said,\n\"\nBeatrice.\"\n\"\nOh,\" I said,\n\"\nher maiden name ?\n\"\nAnd you replied,\n\"\nMac \"\nand I couldn't get any more. But\nplease, when you write, don't tell me the end of it, because\nI want to get it out of you in my own way and time.\nLater in the month of October 1920 Miss F. went to Canada.\nOn 23rd December I received from her the following note,\ndated Toronto, 3rd December :\nI shall get a letter or else you are writing one. The old tie\nhas spoken to me. Can't quite get in touch as I should wish,\nbut you are quite near you are trying to tell me something.\nOn the back of this was the following, dated the next\nday, 4th December,\n\"\nabout 5 p.m.\" :\nHave just come out of a kind of dream trance in which you\nare trying to tell me something. I ask you to finish telling\nme your wife's name. You are standing by a side table, and\nI look through an archway, where I can see a large polished\ntable which appears set out for a gathering of some kind, might\n\fon\nth(\nP., i!>2i. Series of Apparent Telepathic. Communications. 141\nbe a board meeting, but I notice a large bowl of yellow and\nbronze chrysanthemums in the centre, the carpet is a very thick\ne. You come to my side and all you answer me is,\n\"\nBiscuits.''\nam puzzled. You laugh, and I say, \"Oh, McFarlane. I want\ne other Christian names, please.\" [I had asked her to try to\nget other of my family names.] You try to tell, but I can't\nget you. With that I wake.\nMy wife has three Christian names. That by which she\nis always called is Beatrice. Her maiden name was Macfarlane.\nThis is, of course, the name of a very well-known firm of\nbiscuit-makers.\nThis case, striking at the first blush, is, unfortunately,\nevidentially leaky in three places. The first is Who's Who.\nSince (I think) 1919, my wife's Christian and maiden names\nhave appeared in this publication. After the receipt of her\nWatford letter of 3rd October, 1920, I wrote to Miss F.\nsuggesting that the knowledge she had obtained (which I had\npreviously told her was correct, so far as it then went) was\nprobably derived from some forgotten glance at Who's Who,\nand asking her if she could remember any circumstance which\nwould give support to that hypothesis. I tried so to word\nthe question I know not with what success as to convey\nthe impression that, in my opinion, the case would be improved,\nif, happily, it should turn out that she had had an oppor-\ntunity, some time within the previous few years, to glance\ninto the unwieldy pages of the popular biographical dictionary,\nsince we should then have an exceptionally good example\nof the emergence, after a long interval, of a submerged memory !\nShe replied as follows on 6th October, 1920 :\nNow ... to answer your question. I can't ever remember\nseeing a Who's Who, and the houses where I've stayed are not\nthe kind to take an interest in [such a publication]. Of course,\nI've heard people mention it, ... as they might mention Burke's\nPeerage, which would of course have no interest for me.\nThe second leaky spot is this : One day, in the course of\nconversation with Miss F., it came out that her brother had\nmet, in business, a cousin of mine. This is a cousin with\nwhom I have never been intimate, and whom I have not\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1921.\nseen for about fourteen years. It is possible, however, even\nprobable, that he would know my wife's names (I find I can\nremember his wife's Christian name with practical certainty,\nbut not her maiden name, if I ever heard it) though not\nnearly so well as he would know some of the family names\nwhich Miss F. failed to get. And though it is quite likely\nthat Miss F.'s brother might tell him casually that his sister\nknew me, it is a little difficult to imagine him supplying\nhim, in return, with my wife's Christian and maiden names,\nor to suppose that, if he did, Miss F.'s brother would remember\nthe information and find it of sufficient interest to repeat to\nhis sister.\nThe third leaky spot is of a similar kind. Miss F. told\nme one day, early in our acquaintance, that she had a colleague\nat the War Office (where she worked for some months after\nI first met her) who had some distant connection with my\nfamily. It turned out that she was the married daughter\nof the second husband of an old friend of my wife's. What the\nchances are that the latter's two names or either of them\nmay have percolated through to her I cannot say. I think\nit possible that the surname may have done so, but am\nmore doubtful about the Christian name. Miss F. did not\ngive me the impression that she was in any way intimate\nwith her ;\nand the first of her experiences recorded above\ndid not occur until four or five months after she had left\nthe War Office.\nI am sure, as I said in regard to the Simms matter, that\nMiss F. did not, within her recollection, obtain cognizance\nof these names by normal means ;\nbut the possibility that\nshe may, sometime, have seen or heard them, and have\nforgotten, somewhat mars what would otherwise be, I think,\nan unusually clear case indicative of telepathic communication ;\nand the flaw, I feel, is particularly to be regretted, in view\nof the fact that the second part of the surname was obtained\nwhen Miss F. was so far away as Canada.\nOn the other hand, the manner in which the name was\nobtained appears to favour the telepathic hypothesis. It was\nnot, as will have been seen, all plain sailing. The Christian\nand the common prefix of the surname were got without\ntrouble ;\nbut then came the difficulty and the stumbling so\n\f[., i!2i. Series of Apparent Telepathic Communications. 143\nniliar and so exasperating, in similar circumstances, in\nmnection with mediumistic phenomena. This appears to\nive been overcome ultimately by the rather ingenious device,\nipon the part of whatever intelligence was concerned, of\n^pressing the word\n\"\nbiscuits.\" Being familiar, this was\n)parently easy to get through, and by an obvious association\nideas it pointed to the troublesome surname. Compare\nvarious indications of the same artifice in The Ear of Dionysius\n.scripts, e.g.\n\"\nTry her with the David story. She might\nget it that way\" (Proc., Vol. XXIX., p. 216).\n1\nMiss F. married a few days after mailing me the note\nof 4th December, 1920, and has settled permanently in Canada.\nSince that time she has sent me no notes of experiences or\nimpressions suggestive of the acquisition of information super-\nnormally from me. Apparently marriage has broken the\nrapport !\nI may add that I made at no time any conscious effort\nto convey information to Miss F. telepathically.\n1\nSince writing the above I have had an interview with Miss F. (now\nMrs. M.) while on a visit to this country from Canada. She then told\nme, for the first time, that, on the occasion of her experience at Watford,\nafter getting the words\n'\"\nBeatrice\n\"\nand\n\"\nMac,\" she had a vision of a\nlane a long, green, winding lane which puzzled her ; and, oddly enough,\nit continued to puzzle her even at the time when she told me about it,\nthough she then knew my wife's maiden name. It thus appears that the\nintelligence concerned, nearly three months before getting this name under-\nstood by means of the association with the word\n\"\nbiscuits,\" had tried to\ndo so, unsuccessfully, by means of a lane symbol. (Compare the \"Merrifield\"\nincident, Proc., Vol. XVII., p. 208.)\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nON CHANCE COINCIDENCE IN BOOK-TESTS.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nApril 4, 1921.\nMADAM, 1 happened to be discussing\n\"\nbook-tests\n\"\nwith my\nmother yesterday and it occurred to me to try whether a random\nselection would give me anything which could be regarded as\nevidential in connection with my father, who died some years ago.\n1\naccordingly selected, quite arbitrarily,\n\" the seventh book from\nthe left in the third shelf from the top, page 84, about the\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1921.\nmiddle of the page.\" There is only one bookcase in the room\nand the book proved to be Scott's Monastery. On turning up\nthe reference I found, just below the middle of the page, the\nwords Good luck to your fishing, standing in a line by themselves.\nI cannot imagine any reference which would be more perfectly\nappropriate to my father than this. He was a passionately\nenthusiastic fisherman and his devotion to this pursuit was a\nregular family joke. My mother must have used those precise\nwords to him scores of times when seeing him off on his many\nexpeditions. So characteristic was this love of angling that the\nlarge pastel portrait of him which hangs just to the right of this\nbook-case shows him surrounded by fishing tackle.\nEeference to the eighth book (same page and place) gave the\nfollowing :\n\"\nWhere architectural ornaments are introduced into the garden\nabout the house . . . raised terraces . . .\nflights of steps . . .\netc.\"\nThe house in which we lived at the time of my father's death,.\nand in which he died, had a sort of raised verandah at the back,\nwith two flights of steps leading down into the garden.\nExamination of the same page in the succeeding eight books,\nmaking ten in all, gave five complete blanks and three partial\nsuccesses.\nIn view of such coincidences as these, of which the first is\nextremely striking, and in view of various letters which have\nrecently appeared in the Spectator and elsewhere, it seems that the-\npossibilities of chance coincidence in book-tests might easily be-\nunder-estimated.\nA thorough statistical investigation would be valuable if\nanyone\ncould be found willing to undertake it.\nW.

He gave his\nname Abraham Florentine, and he was in the American War of\n1812, died August 5th, 1874, aged 83 years 1 month 17 days,\nat Brooklyn.\nIt was ascertained by enquiry in America that the informa-\ntion given at the sitting of September 1, 1874, was correct\n(op. cit.\npp. 82-86), but apparently no search was made to\nascertain whether any notice of Abraham Florentine's death\nhad appeared in the American papers at the time.\nIn consequence of an enquiry recently received, the Secretary,\nMiss Newton, wrote a few weeks ago to Mr. E. J. Dingwall,\nnow in America, to ask whether he could get any information\non this point. The following reply was received from Mr.\nDingwall :\nTHE ABRAHAM FLORENTINE CASE.\nOn September 8th, 1921, I visited the New York Public\nLibrary for the purpose of consulting back files of journals which\nmight contain an obituary notice of Abraham Florentine.\nThe following journals were consulted : The Brooklyn Daily\nEagle ;\nThe New York Daily Tribune ;\nThe New York Times ;\nThe New York Herald ;\nThe Sun ;\nand the Evening Post. Of these\nthe first two contained notices of the death of Florentine.\nBrooklyn Daily Eagle, Wednesday evening, August 5th, 1874,\nVol. 135, No. 184, p. 3, col. 2.\nThe entry occurs under the paragraph headed DIED.\nFLORENTINE. In Brooklyn, August 5th, after a long, and\npainful illness, ABRAHAM FLORENTINE, aged 83 years, 1 month,\nand 17 days. A veteran of the war of 1812. Notice of\nfuneral hereafter.\nThe New York Daily Tribune, Thursday, August 6th, 1874,\nVol. 34, No. 10,404, p. 5, Col. 6.\nThe entry again occurs under the paragraph headed DIED.\nFLORENTINE. (The entry is the same as in the Brooklyn\nDaily Eagle, with the exception that the name Abraham\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov,. 1921.\nFlorentine in the second line is in lower case and the last\nsentence is omitted.)\nNo entry occurs as far as I can see in the other journals\nconsulted.\nOn September 9th, 1921, I again visited the New York Public\nLibrary for the purpose of discovering if there was any notice\nof the funeral as promised in the obituary notice of the Brooklyn\nDaily Eagle. The following notice appears :\nBrooklyn Daily Eagle, Thursday, August 6th, 1874, Vol. 35,\nNo. 185, p. 3, col 2.\nThe entry again occurs under the column DIED.\nFLORENTINE. On August 5th, after a lingering illness,\nABRAHAM FLORENTINE, in the 84Jh year of his age. Friends\nand relatives invited to attend his funeral Friday afternoon,\nAugust (sic) 7th, at 2.30 o'clock, from Franklin Avenue\nPresbyterian Church, Franklin near Myrtle Avenue.\nFrom the above entries (and I cannot find any account of the\nfuneral itself) it would seem that the information given in the\ntable tipping was contained in the newspapers at the lime.\nSteamers for Europe apparently sailed on the 8th, and so there\nwould have been time for some one to have seen the entry, if\nthey had seen one of the newspapers. Perhaps the unusual\nname Florentine caught the eye and was registered in the sub-\nconscious mind. Modern book tests seem to me to obscure the\nmatter still further, as it is conceivable that such information\nmight be derived through abnormal clairvoyant selective powers\non the part of the medium.\n. ERIC JOHN DINGWALL.\nSeptember 9, 1921.\nFrom the information contained in Mr. Dingwall's statement\nit would appear possible that either Stainton Moses himself,\nor one of the two friends, Dr. and Mrs. Speer, who took part\nin the sitting of September 1, 1874, had actually seen a notice\nof Florentine's death, and that the case is one of cryptomnesia.\nProof of this hypothesis is of course impossible to obtain at\nthe present time. It is, however, possible, to offer some\ncorroboration of the hypothesis that the source of the know-\nledge shown in the table-tilting, whether normally or super-\nnormally acquired, was one of the notices of Florentine's death\n\fNov., 1921. Note on \"\nThe Case of Abraham Florentine\" 151\ngiven in an American paper rather than the dead man himself.\nIt would seem, according to trustworthy information obtained\nfrom various sources in America (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XI.,\npp. 82-86), that the statements contained in the obituary\nnotices were slightly inaccurate upon one point, and this\ninaccuracy is reproduced in the statements obtained at the\nsitting.\nThe age of Abraham Florentine at the time of his death is\ngiven in the obituary notices and also at the sitting as\n83 years, 1 month, and 17 days.\nIn an account of an interview with Florentine's widow\n(op. cit. p. 83) it appears that according to her statement he\nlad been 83 years old on June 8, 1874, and died on the\nfollowing August 5. The interviewer remarks upon this :\nIt will be observed that while the spirit of Mr. Florentine\nstates his age to have been eighty-three years, one month, seven-\nteen days, according to his widow's account it should be twenfcy-\nren days ;\nbut this discrepancy is hardly worthy of notice, as\neither he or she may here be equally mistaken.\nThis discrepancy is, however, decidedly\n\"\nworthy of notice\n\"\nwhen we observe that it is a discrepancy between the actual\nage of the man when he died (according to the statement of\nhis widow) and his age as stated in the m obituary notices (a\ndiscrepancy accounted for by the misprinting of a single\nfigure) ;\nbetween the statement made in the obituary notices\nand the statement made at the sitting of September 1 there\nis^no discrepancy at all.\nAnother point may be mentioned which also suggests that\nthe source of whatever knowledge Stainton Moses had con-\ncerning Abraham Florentine was one of the obituary notices.\nIn a letter to The Spiritualist (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XI., p. 82)\nStainton Moses gives an account of the sitting of September 1,\n1874, in which the following passage occurs:\nIf I may venture a guess, I should say that Abraham Florentine\nwas a good soldier, a fighting man not nice to meet, and that he\nretains enough of his old impetuosity to rejoice at his liberation\nfrom the body, which (if I may guess again) had become a\nburden to him through a painful illness.\nA3\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.\nIn the two obituary notices quoted by Mr. Dingwall occur\nthe words\n\"\nafter a long and painful illness\"\nIt seems worth while to call attention to these facts, even\nafter so long a lapse of time, because the case of Abraham\nFlorentine made some stir when it was first published, and\nhas since then been quoted as good evidence of communication\nfrom the dead,\n1\nand so far as we have been able to ascertain\nthe circumstance of two obituary notices of this man having\nappeared in American papers at the time of his death has\nnever been put on record. It appears evident both from the\narticle quoted above, and also from a further discussion of\nthe case of Stainton Moses in Human Personality (Vol. II.,\np. 230) that Myers knew nothing of these obituary notices.\n2\nSOME INCIDENTS IN SITTINGS WITH TRANCE-\nMEDIUMS.\nIN the Journal for last July (Vol. XX., p. 122 ff.) we printed\nunder the title of\n\"\nThe Case of Charley L ,\" a report of\nan incident which occurred at two sittings taken by the\n1\nSee, e.g. Dr. Maxwell's paper on \"\nCorrespondances Croisees et la methode\nexperimentale\n\"\n(Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXVI., p. 139). In her reply to Dr.\nMaxwell Mrs. Sidgwiek calls attention to the possibility of cryptomnesia\nin the Abraham Florentine case (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXVI., pp. 385, 386).\n2\nIn a footnote to this passage Myers refers to Podmore's Studies in\nPsychical Research. In his discussion of the case of Stainton Moses Podmore\nobserves (p. 131),\n\"\nWe shall find that there is no independent evidence\nthat the communications were ever received until after such an interval\nas would allow of the facts of the death and attendant circumstances being\nascertained from the daily papers. In the case of deaths occurring in\nEngland the interval was usually several days. In the case of Abraham\nFlorentine, who died in America on 5th August, 1874, the seance at which\nthe communication was made is described, in the only account we possess\nan account written in the December of that year as having taken place\n\"\nlast August.\"\nIt would seem that Podmore was mistaken in saying that the only account\nwe have of the incident was written in December, for the extract from\nStainton Moses' note-books, quoted by Myers in his article in our Proceedings\n(Vol. XI.), is dated\n\"\nSeptember 1st,\" and Myers does not suggest any\ndoubt as to the evidence of its having been written on that day. In any\ncase the point is not important, for there would have been time between\nAugust 5th, when the first obituary notice appeared, and September 1st\nfor the paper containing the obituary notice to reach this country.\n\fNov., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 153\nRev. W. S. Irving with Mrs. Brittain. We now print some\nfurther incidents in sittings taken by Mr. Irving with Mrs.\nBrittain and with Mrs. Leonard.\nK\nL\nExtract from the Rev. W. S. Irving's first Sitting with\nMrs. Leonard, January 25, 1921.\n(The contemporary record of the sitting was made by\nOolonel C. E. Baddeley. Mr. Irving made his appointment\nwith Mrs. Leonard anonymously through this Society, and\na communicator purported to be present, whom he identifies as\nhis wife.)\nFEDA.

You will recognise\nit in-stan-taneously.\" Don't think about it any\nmore, or you might miss it. . .\n(NOTE. The following book-test was given about\ntwenty minutes later.)\nF. Something about a book you have been reading, reading\nit quite lately. You put it by another book.\nW. S. I. Yes, I have.\nF. She is afraid you have. A book you have been\nreading.\nW.

Not all the words at the bottom of\nthe page will fit, but certain words will fit very\ndefinitely. She wants to give you the idea of\nspanning something, over-bridging, words that also\nconvey that as well as what she said before. Higher\nup the page something gives her the idea of struggling,\nturmoil. It does not matter to us, she says, only\na test. She thought there was a picture facing the\npage or very near it. She got the idea of the\nOcean, ships, travelling, very close to this too. She\nwants you to find that ; you will recognise it. Look\nfor it, as she told you. She says you have not got\nit here. It is in a room. Feda has not the feeling\nof a proper bookcase. It was put down carelessly,\nnot in order. It is coloured on the back, something\nred on the outside, something making a circular shape.\nIt is not a plain cover, a picture cover which has\ngot red on it. She's laughing, and says :\n\"\nYou\n\fNov., iu2i. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 155\n: :\n~\nwill find it red, red, red.\" Don't forget it is not on\na proper book-shelf.\n(NoTE. Somewhere here, the exact place is not\nrecorded, the sitter asked again if it was a magazine,\nas he remembered reading several just before leaving\nhome.}\nF. It has not got a stiff cover, it has got a paper cover,\ngot red and yellow on the cover. It's the second.\nIf you walked straight to where the books are, it\nwould be the second you would touch. There is\nsomething brass near them, metal.\nWhat have you got in that room ? It isn't a live\nanimal, is it ? Have you an animal in that room ?\nWill he bite ? He's got teeth. Dora says he's got\ntwo good ones, special long ones. Feda don't want\nhim much. Live animals don't like people who have\npassed over. As well as the live one that can bite\nthere is also a representation of one. She says :\n\"\nYes, yes, that is not quite the word I want. It\nis only like an imitated one, so it can't bite. Near\nthis there is some glass.\nIn his notes to this sitting Mr. Irving records that on his\nway to the station immediately afterwards he remarked to\nthe recorder, Colonel Baddeley, that the only book he could\nrecall having read lately with a red cover was The Crimson\nTide by Robert Chambers. Colonel Baddeley recalls this\nremark, a fact to which Mr. Irving draws attention because\nthe friend to whom he had written to come to verify the\nbook test with him did not turn up, and he had to verify\nthe test alone. With reference to the statements made\nas to the position of the book and as to the room in which\nit was said to be, Mr. Irving notes that he returned home\non Saturday, January 29, and at once looked in his dining\nroom for the book.\nThere were a number of books and magazines carelessly laid\non the sofa. On the left-hand side was a pile of about a dozen\nbooks ;\nthe second from the top was The Crimson Tide. No\nother red-covered book which had been lately read was there,\nexcept a volume of sermons under several other books. Beside\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1921.\nthe sofa, two and a half yards away, was a brass bowl. A dog\nis generally in the room, but at the time of the sitting was not\nin the house. A photograph of a house and two people, and\nincluding the same dog's photograph, hangs on the wall. It is\nunder glass.\nSome further details concerning the contents of this room\nwere given at Mr. Irving's second sitting with Mrs. Leonard\n(see below, p. 161). With regard to the clear identification\nof the book, it should be noted that according to Feda's\nstatement there was some yellow as well as red on the cover,\nand also something which is described as\n\"\npart of a circle,\"\n\"\nsomething making a circular shape.\" As Miss Newton noted\nwhen she saw The Crimson Tide on February 1, 1921 (see\nbelow), the book is\n\"\nbound in bright red, with a bar of\ngold, four by one and a half inches, along the top of the\nfront of the cover, and the green shield of Boots' Booklovers'\nLibrary at the bottom on the right.\" This green shield is\nheart-shaped, and may be what Feda has in mind when she\nrefers to something which is\n\"\npart of a circle.\" But apart\nfrom that the reference to red and yellow would seem to\nidentify the book pretty clearly. The statement that the book\nhad a paper cover was incorrect, but, as Mr. Irving\nsuggests, was very probably due to his pressing Feda upon\nthe point whether the volume in question was not a maga-\nzine. It will be noted that the communicator emphasises\nthe redness of the book \"\nyou will find it red, red, red.\"\nNot only had the book a red cover, but it was called The\nCrimson Tide, and dealt with the Red Terror.\nAs to the contents of the book, Mr. Irving could not find\nanything appropriate on page 7, but on p. 8, which is at\nthe back of p. 7, the following passage occurs at the bottom\nof the page :\n\"\nTo meet God unexpectedly is nothing to scare one, is it\nPella ?\n\"\nshe urged coaxingly. The other reddened and her eyes\nflashed :\n\"\nWhat God do you mean ?\n\"\nshe retorted.\n\"\n\/\/ I have\nanything to say about my destination after death I shall go where\nLove is. And it does not dwell with the God or in the Heaven\nthat we have been taught to desire and to hope for.\" The\nSwedish girl patted her shoulder and smiled.\n\fNOV., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. . 157\nThe words which are italicised above are taken, by Mr.\nIrving to be the message to which Feda was referring when\nshe spoke of a message\n\"\nfrom her to you\n\"\nand of\n\"\nthe idea\nof spanning something, over-bridging.\"\nOn the upper part of p. 8 there is no very definite and\nexplicit allusion to struggling and turmoil, but the following\nitence may possibly suggest this :\nWe will show you a monument made of heads and higher\nlan the Kremlin.\"\nThere are on p. 8 and on neighbouring pages several allusions\nrhich might suggest\n\"\nthe Ocean, ships, travelling,\" as, for\nstance :\n(p. 7)\n\"\nDuring several hundreds of miles in sleighs Brisson's\nconstant regret was the absence of ferocious wolves.\"\n(p. 8)\n\"\nIs not America the destination of your long journey ?\"\n(p. 18)\n\"\nBy train, by sleigh, by boat, his quartette floundered\nalong toward safety.\"\nSumming up the evidence so far considered in regard to\nthis book-test we may say that whereas there is\ngood evidence\nof knowledge concerning the outward appearance of the test-\nbook and its position in Mr. Irving's house at the time of\nthe sitting, the evidence in regard to knowledge of the contents\nof the book is marred by the apparent confusion between\npage 7 and page 8 at the back of it.\n1\nWe can now- pass\non to consider the sequel.\n1. Statement by Mr. Irving, February 3, 1921.\nOn Thursday, January 27, I wrote to Miss Newton asking her\ngive us an appointment, for the purpose of going through the\njcords of some\n\"\nLeonard\n\"\nand\n\"\nBrittain\n\"\nsittings. This she\n:indly arranged for Tuesday, February 1st. Half-way through\nre study of the evidence given in the first Leonard sitting I\n[plained that I must, for evidential reasons, omit some para-\niphs, as they seemed to concern the present and were in the\niture of a test. The passages left out contained all references\n1\nIt is not infrequently alleged that communicators have difficulty in\nlistinguishing between the back and front of the same page. See Mrs.\nSidgwick's Report on Book Tests, p. 350.\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.\nto the\n\"\nplace near a square\n\"\nand to our being shown a picture\nthat would seem a link to us. After Miss Newton had com-\npleted her examination of the book test, I began to read to her\nsections of a Brittain sitting. I had gone through a few points\nof interest when Miss Newton, who meanwhile had been turning\nover the pages of the Crimson Tide, asked me to read again\nfrom the Leonard record the reference to turmoil and strife to\nsee if it referred to the picture that had been mentioned later\nas near the page, and also to see if some better solution of the\nbook-test could not be found. I read the words again, and\nthen she said to us : \"I want you to look at this picture. It's\na pity that this was not opposite the page.\" We did so, and\nfound it was the picture forming the frontispiece of the book ;\nit was one of struggling and fighting, and represented a young\ngirl wrenching a flag from a burly Jew, amidst an infuriated\nmob. It flashed, I think, into the minds of Colonel Baddeley\nand myself simultaneously that we were being shown a picture\nthat formed a link in the communicator's book-test, purposely\nwithheld till then, for we exclaimed together :\n\"\nYou've done it ;\nthat's the test !\n\"\nWe recognised it instantaneously.\nMiss Newton's account of the above interview, written partly\non the same day, February 1, and partly on the day after,\nran as follows :\nMr. Irving read to me the notes of several sittings, including\nthe notes of the book-test. He brought with him a book, The\nCrimson Tide, by Robert Chambers, which was bound in bright\nred, with a bar of gold four by one and a half inches along the\ntop of the front of the cover, and the green shield of Boots'\nBooklovers' Library at the bottom on the right. The test referred\nto page 7. At the -place indicated, but on the back of the page,\ni.e. on page 8, there was an appropriate sentence. An allusion\nwas made (at the sitting) to something which suggested\n\"\nstrug-\ngling and turmoil\n\"\non the same page. I was not convinced\nby the paragraph Mr. Irving pointed out to me as fulfilling this\npart of the test. There was no picture facing or near the\ntest page.\nMr. Irving said there was another test, but that he could not\nread it then, as he understood it to mean that it referred to\nsomething that would happen at 20 Hanover Square. I did not\n\fNOV., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 159\nconnect it with myself, and half suggested that he should read it,\nbut he said that it referred to something that I was to show him.\nI regretted having caused him to tell me so much. He said no\nmore about it, and I had not the slightest idea of what it was\nthat I was to show him. I have no recollection of thinking\nabout this test again until just before the end of the interview,\nwhich lasted nearly two hours.\nSome time after Mr. Irving had read the notes of the book-\ntest I reverted to it, and fetched two books (one a novel) from\nthe store-room, to look at the contents on pages 7 and 8, to test\nthe hypothesis of chance-coincidence. I mention this only because\neven then I did not recollect that there was another\n\"\ntest\n\"\nin which I was to show Mr. Irving something.\nLater I picked up The Crimson Tide, and opened it at the\nfrontispiece. I said :\n\"\nWhat a pity it is that this is not the\npicture r< ;ferred to, for it is unmistakeably a picture of\n\"\nstrug-\ngling and turmoil.\"\nShortly before the interview was over I recollected for the first\ntime the test that had not been read and I asked Mr. Irving\nto read it. When he read out that he would be made to look\nat a picture, we instantaneously remembered that I had shown\nhim the picture in The Crimson Tide. I. NEWTON.\nColonel Baddeley was also asked to write out an account\nof the interview on February 1, but unfortunately, when\nhe came to do so, on February 5, his recollection of the\nsequence of events was not clear, and in his first statement\nhe made it appear that Miss Newton had been told that\naccording to the statement made at the sitting of January 25,\nMr. Irving was to be shown a picture at 20 Hanover Square\nbefore she actually showed him the frontispiece to The Crimson\nTide a material point in the evidence. Both Miss Newton\nand Mr. Irving were at variance with Colonel Baddeley upon\nthis point and in agreement with each other. When this\ndiscrepancy was pointed out to Colonel Baddeley, he wrote\nthus in a letter to Miss Newton, dated February 12, 1921 :\nI felt very doubtful about that sequence of events, and thought\nabout it a good deal. My reason for eventually putting down\nthat we had told you about the picture before you found the\npicture in the book, was that I retained the impression that we\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.\nall THREE instantaneously recognised the picture when I exclaimed\n\"\nWhy that is the picture we were to be shown here,\" or words\nto that effect.\nA reference to the last paragraph of Miss Newton's statement\nwill show how Colonel Baddeley's mistake arose :\nShortly before the interview was over I recollected for the first\ntime that the test had not been read and I asked Mr. Irving\nto read it. When he read out that he would be made to look\nat a picture, we instantaneously remembered that I had shown\nhim the picture in The Crimson Tide.\nThis statement shows how it was that when Miss Newton\nwas told that Mr. Irving was to be shown a picture she, as\nwell as Mr. Irving and Colonel Baddeley, at once identified\nthis picture as the frontispiece of The Crimson Tide. Colonel\nBaddeley was right in his impression that Miss Newton had\nshared in the immediate recognition of this point, but according\nto the evidence of Miss Newton herself and of Mr. Irving he\nwas wrong as to the reason why she had shared in it. Miss\nNewton is perfectly clear in her recollection that at the time\nwhen she showed the frontispiece of The Crimson Tide to\nMr. Irving, she had no knowledge of the fact that he was\nexpecting to be shown a picture, and her report of the inter-\nview of February 1, being the most nearly contemporaneous,\nis probably the most accurate.\nIt does, of course, detract something from the evidential\nvalue of the case that in the earlier part of the interview,\nbefore Miss Newton showed Mr. Irving the frontispiece of\nThe Crimson Tide, she had been told that Mr. Irving was\nexpecting to be shown something. But there does not seem\nto be any reason for supposing that Miss Newton's action\narose out of what she had been told. It arose quite naturally\nout of the discussion and Miss Newton's desire to find, if\npossible, a more satisfying solution of a particular point in\nthe test. Indeed, what seems rather curious in this matter,\nfrom an observer's point of view, is not so much that Miss\nNewton should instantly have connected the frontispiece with\nthe allusion in the book-test to\n\"\nstruggling and turmoil,\"\nbut that when Mr. Irving verified the book-test he should\nhimself have overlooked this possible connexion ;\nfor at the\n\fNov., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 161\nsitting of January 25 immediately after the allusion to\nstruggling and turmoil come the words :\n\"\nShe thought there\nwas a picture facing the page or very near it.\" It is true\nthat the picture, being a frontispiece, did not face page 7\n(on which the test message was said to be), and was not very\nnear it (for the book has a long preface), but anything\nlore unmistakeably illustrating\n\"\nstruggling and turmoil\n\"\nit\nrould be hard to find. If the claim of the communicator\nit she can in some way control future action is justified\nit is expressed in the words : \"I am going to make you\nlook at a picture\n\"\nit is just as easy to suppose that she\nLuenced Mr. Irving to overlook the frontispiece when he\nverified the book-test from The Crimson Tide on January 29,\nto suppose that she influenced Miss Newton to show him\nie picture on February 1. In fact, Mr. Irving's action, or\nither inaction, was the real crux of the matter ;\nfrom that\nit may be said that the other events followed in a natural\n[uence, and something of this sort was doubtless what\n[r.\nIrving had in his mind when he wrote in his account\n)f his interview with Miss Newton :\n\"\nWe were being shown\npicture which formed a link in the communicator's book-\nst, purposely withheld till then.\"\nAs has been mentioned above, at Mr. Irving's second sitting\ndth Mrs. Leonard on January 27, 1921, some further knowledge\nras shown concerning the contents of the room in which the\nit-book was lying.\nExtract from the Sitting of January 27, 1921.\nFEDA. You have got a thing like a snake you have nasty\nthings in your room it looks like a snake to Feda,\nbut Dora [the communicator, Mrs. Irving] says it's\nquite nice, so Feda thinks it's all right. Is that\na piece of stone in your room ? It looks like a\nlump of stone, a little one, lying on top of some-\nthing, lower than a shelf (Feda indicates about\n3 feet from the floor), in the same room as the\nwhite snake.\nW. S. I. White snake ?\nF. She says :\n\"\nNot a white snake, a wide snake, not\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1921.\nwhite, it goes fatter in the middle. In the same\nroom as the piece of stone. Will you look ?\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nOn the mantel-shelf [of the room in which the test-book was\nfound] is a large vase of green Leckhampton stone, 8| inches\nin height, by 7 inches in width at the base. Two snakes are\nclimbing the vase, one on each side. Only one can be seen at a\ntime when the vase is on the shelf. Each snake is 14 inches in\nlength, green and black in colour, and rather formidable in appear-\nance ; nearly an inch in diameter at the thickest part.\nThe piece of stone took some rinding. It proved to be in a\ndrawer, about three feet from the ground, and resting on a bit\nof silk. A small stone, If inches by 1| by f deep, a pebble used\nin weighing things in cooking.\nIn subsequent sittings which Mr. Irving had, the medium being\nin some cases Mrs. Leonard and in others Mrs. Brittain,\nfurther statements were made, deriving ostensibly from the\nsame communicator, Mr. Irving's wife, which seem to show\nknowledge of matters unknown to Mr. Irving at the time.\nThere were also some further incidents which fall into line\nwith the picture incident described above, the communicator\nclaiming to have some foreknowledge of, and some control\nover future events, a claim which the events seem to justify.\nA peculiarity which is noteworthy in the results obtained by\nMr. Irving is that on several occasions we find between state-\nments made by Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Brittain respectively just\nthat kind of relation which might be expected if the same\nintelligence were communicating through both mediums and\nendeavouring in this way to give evidence of her identity.\nIn order to make these points clear it will be necessary to\nquote at some length from various sittings at which Mr. Irving\nwas present, and from his notes upon these sittings.\nII.\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs. Brittain, April 14, 1921.\n(The sitter was Mr. Irving, the recorder Colonel Baddeleyf;\nboth were anonymous to Mrs. Brittain. During part of the\n\fNOV., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 1 63\nsitting Mrs. Brittain was in trance, and her usual control\n\"\nBelle\n\"\nwas purporting to speak through her.)\nBELLE When you are reading you pay no attention to what\nyou read, you will glance up at the window, . . . the\nlong window that goes down to the ground. The\nwindow pushes out, it does not open top and bottom.\n. . . There is a path outside that window. . . .\nJust in front of that window there is a bush, like a\nround bush, a hedge or bush, not a wall, a round\nbush like a laurel or a rhododendron bush. ... It\nis in that room where she likes to come. It is\nhome. There is a picture of her in it. ... She is\nmaking my eyes ache giving me a test. Where the\nroom with the window is, there is at the bottom a\nbook, a red one. It isn't a big one, in shape, but\na thick one. Something belonging to her in that\nbook, which she put in, looks like something that\ncrinkled up, a dead rose or a leaf. It does not\nlook as if the book were in a book-case, it is as if\ntaken down and left down. There is something\nspecial about it. I don't think it's a picture. It\nlooks like a flower. There is something else.\n(Now came a long pause, and the medium began to whisper\nindistinctly, it seemed like the beginning of a direct control.\nThen the medium woke up and began to speak clairvoyantly.)\n[RS. BRITTAIN. Somebody has been trying to talk to you instead\nof Belle. Belle is cross. Never mind. Just a\nminute. I don't know what they are trying to do.\nBelle is not content, she is cross with herself. . . .\nShe had gone away to see for herself about the book,\nlike a dictionary, with something in it, and some one\ncame. There was something in it to do with the\nspirit lady connected with you. Something she was\nlooking up when she passed away. Belle says she\ncan see nothing 'herself.\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nThe room is the same as that described through Mrs. Leonard,\n.from which the\n\"\nCrimson Tide\n\"\nbook-test was taken. The\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.\ndetails are correct, a French window opening outward, path outside\nthe window, round evergreen bush, across the lawn, nearly opposite\nthe window. There is a large picture of the communicator in the\nroom, also many smaller ones.\nOn returning home on April 15, 1921, I hunted for the book,\nwhich I had recognised from Mrs. Brittain's clairvoyance as the\ncommunicator's copy of Cassell's Pocket English Dictionary. I first\nlooked on the sofa, where I leave a number of books scattered\nabout, and where The Crimson Tide was found ;\nit was not there.\nThe description of the book's whereabouts\n\"\nat the bottom\n\"\nwas\nrather vague, but the place where I found it answers well to the\ndescription given. As I have no proper book-case in my dining-\nroom, I keep a number of books in a row on the top of my\nwriting-desk. There being more books there than the top of the\ndesk will hold, I have piled some up on the right-hand side, and\nit was near the bottom of the pile that the dictionary proved\nto be. The desk is about 5 feet from the French window.\n(Mr. Irving then gives a drawing to show that the dictionary\nwas the ninth book from the top in a pile of eleven books lying\nhorizontally on the top of the writing-desk.)\nIt is a small red book, only 4f inches by 3J, and f inches\nthick, 452 pages. The book was probably placed by myself some\nweeks before at the top of the pile, and had gradually got into\nthe position in which I found it by other books beneath being\npulled out for use and then placed above it. I do not often\nconsult the dictionary. I found nothing in it, but after carefully\nexamining it found that the bottom leaf of page 62 was turned\nup to mark the place. This cannot, I think, have ever been done\nby me, as when I turn down a leaf in a book I turn down the\ntop right-hand corner. I had not consciously noticed the leaf\nturned up before. It is almost certain .that this had been done\nby the communicator, as few people have access to my books.\nThe dictionary does not open at the place, if picked up and\nopened casually the leaves are so thin.\nWith regard to his statement that the turning down of the\nleaf was probably done by the communicator, Mr. Irving\nsubsequently wrote in a letter dated May 4, 1921, thus :\nI was running through the list of words on page 62 of the\nDictionary this morning to see if I could get any clue as to\n\fNov., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance,-Mediums. 165\nwhat was being looked up, and came to the word\n\"\ncantilever.\"\nThis reminded me that 12 months ago I had a man staying with\nme (Mr. Grundy) who was deeply interested in Dr. Crawford's\nexperiments and his cantilever theory. We discussed it at length,\nand it is\nquite likely that the meaning of the word was looked\nup. He may, for all I know, have turned up the leaf. Had I\nknown this when sending in the record, I should certainly not\nhave worded my note so strongly as to the probability of the\npage having been turned up by my wife.\nLater on it was suggested to Mr. Irving that he should\nwrite to Mr. Grundy and enquire whether the latter could\nthrow any light on the questions whether he had turned up\na leaf in Cassell's Dictionary. Mr. Grundy replied as follows :\nSeptember 30, 1921.\n... It is very hard to recall actions which, as you know, may\nhave been almost automatic at the time.\nI do not often use dictionaries and would not normally look up\nthe word\n\"\ncantilever.\" But it is quite possible that I did so\nwhen staying at your house, especially if the book was in my\nbedroom. [It was not. W. S. I.], to verify the use of the term\nas found in Crawford's book, which I had probably been recently\nreading. . . .\nI do not think I should consciously turn down the leaves of\nanother's book, but I do so invariably with my own books,, on\nthe page which I am actually reading and at the top of the page.\nWith a dictionary I might turn down the bottom corner, but\nprobably only if the word desired were near that corner, i.e. about\none or two inches from the bottom. [The word\n\"\ncantilever\n\"\nis the 4th word from the top in the left-hand column of my\ndictionary. W. S. I.]\nIt would seem from Mr. Grundy's statement that it is\nunlikely he was the person who turned up page 62 of the\nDictionary at the bottom. It is of course impossible to prove\nthat it was turned up by the communicator. The statements\nmade at the sitting with Mrs. Brittain were, however, correct\nin regard to the general appearance of the book, its position\n(approximately) in Mr. Irving's dining-room., and the fact\nof its being a dictionary. The statement that there was a\nrose or leaf crumpled up inside the book was not correct.\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.,1921.\nIt is possible that there was some misinterpretation here on\nthe part of the medium or of her\n\"\ncontrol,\" and that reference\nwas intended to the leaf of the book, not to a leaf enclosed\nin it.\nMr. Irving draws attention in his notes to several points\nof connexion between this book-test and the test concerning\nThe Crimson Tide given through Mrs. Leonard :\n(1) In each case the same room is chosen, Mr. Irving's\ndining-room, but the details given in regard to the\nroom are complementary, there is no repetition.\n(2) In each case the book chosen was a red 1\nbook.\n(3) In each case the book is taken from amongst some\nthat were lying about in the room, not standing in\nbook-shelves.\nIn most houses some books will be found lying about, but\nit would seem from Mr. Irving's notes that it is rather a habit\nof his to keep books in this way, and it is therefore of some\ninterest to find that this habit is apparently taken into account\nat the sittings with both mediums.\nIII.\nThe following incident is a case in which there seems to\nbe evidence of continued memory on the part of the com-\nmunicator. The facts referred to at the sitting were not\nwithin the conscious knowledge of the sitter.\nExtract from Mr. Irving's second Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nJanuary 27, 1921.\nFEDA. Do you know what she [the communicator, Mr. Irving's\nwife] means by the little bag you should have of\nhers ? Not a leather one, she is speaking of a\nstuff one, a material one, and Feda sees that it is\nnarrower at the top than at the bottom. She gets\n1\nAt Mr. Irving's second sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 27, 1921, Feda\nsaid: \"Will you put for her yellow or red, she can see it more easily. She\nwants a red rose. . . . She was very fond of red roses. She can see red\neasily.\"\nAnd at his sitting with Mrs. Brittain on September 11, 1921, it was said:\n\"She [the communicator] has brought you a great lot of crimson roses.\"\n\fNov., 1021. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 167\nthe idea of something weighting it at the bottom a\nlittle. Now she is pretending to open it, it is lighter\ncolour inside than outside. She wants you to put\nyour hand in it, because she thinks there is some-\nthing loose at the bottom of it, as if you could pull\naway a bit of the stuff inside. Now, she says, she\nthought of this bag before any other because she was\nlooking among her things for a receipt. It is not\nin this bag, it is in another one she used more when\nshe went out. The receipt is in a bag of hers, it\nlooks to Feda very small ;\nshe is trying to draw the\nfigure 9 which is on it.\nW. S. I. On the receipt or on the bag ?\nF. On the receipt. She would not have the Vicar's mind\non the bag. Will you please look for that ? It is\non the receipt, she is not sure if it is legible, but\nshe hopes so. It will be sufficient for you to see it.\nIt will remind you of something she was very\nparticular about, and fond of.\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nTo-day, Feb. 7th, 1921, I tried to find the receipt stated in the\nLeonard record to be in a bag belonging to the communicator.\nI found four bags of hers that I still have. One as described\nfirst, a material one, lighter inside than out. It contained\nnothing but a small piece of dark material loose at the bottom\nof the bag. Of the other three, which were of the type ladies\ntake with them out of doors, one was empty, one had a littl?\nlace and other material in, and the last, a little bag, contained\na small notebook, some loose bits of paper with figures on, and\ntwo bills ;\none receipted for various groceries, and one not receipted\nfor an Enamelled Stewpan, 4\/9.\nThe communicator, like most people, called stewpans\n\"\nsauce-\npans.\" She also always called me \"\nthe Vicar\n\"\nwhen speaking\nof me to local people.\nOn January 26, 1921, that is to say, the day before the\nLeonard sitting quoted above, Mr. Irving had his first sitting\nwith Mrs. Brittain, and a statement was made on this occasion\nwhich suggests a rather confused attempt to refer to the\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1921.\nsame matter as was referred to in the Leonard sitting of\nJanuary 27, 1921.\nExtract from Mr. Irving''s\nfirst Sitting with Mrs. Brittain,\nJanuary 26, 1921.\nMRS. BRITTAIN. She [the communicator, Mr. Irving's wife] used\nto come into your room, rush out, spoil more sauce-\npans than she paid for, she did not worry you 'about\nit. ... Don't you wish your sweetheart lady buy\nyou a new pipe ? She just wishes she could wash\nyour old ones, unscrew them and boil them in a\nsaucepan. . . . She would like to wash them. . . .\nShe once spoiled an aluminium saucepan boiling milk.\nIV.\nThe following incident is another case in which statements\nmade by the communicator concerning future events were\nverified.\nExtract from Mr. Irving's Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nJune 8, 1921.\n(1) FEDA. And then she [communicator, Mr. Irving's wife] says :\n\"\nI want you to know you're going to see a picture\nsoon that will remind you of me in my earth life.\nI'll influence matters so that you're sure to see it.\nI did before, you know.\"\nW. S. I. Yes.\nF. Now then, there's something more. This is\nsomething\nlike a book-test too, from a different place. It's\nwhere Mr. Charley [Colonel Baddeley] stays in London .\nIt's like a kind of flat, and she says she doesn't\nthink you go up any stairs to it. You know where\nshe means now ?\nW. S. I. Yes, I do.\n[With regard to this book-test, it will suffice to say\nhere that, when the book to which reference appeared\nto be made had been identified, some appropriate\nsentences were found in the positions indicated. The\ntest is chiefly interesting as having been taken from a\nroom with which the sitter had only a very slight\n\fNov., 1921.

Similar attempts have been made on\noilier occasions, but only occasionally with success.,]\n(2) F. What ? You're going with her where ? To see some\npictures ?\nPerhaps he doesn't like pictures ! She\nsays she's going with you to see some pictures, many\npictures. As if\nyou're going to be in a place soon\nwhere there are a lot of pictures. Not in Psychical\nSearchers' rooms. No ! Different kind of place\naltogether. Because there's something there she\nwants to make you look at there, a picture, that,\nwhen you see it, will remind you of the sitting to-day,\nof the fact of her coming to you. She'll be able\nto impress you immediately to look at the right one.\nThere'll only be one that will fit it.\nNotes by Mr. Irving.\n(1) During my visit to town I stayed with Mr. and Mrs.\nWhitehead, the father and mother of the communicator. On\ncoming down to breakfast on the morning of June 9th, the day\nafter the sitting, I found the breakfast-room empty, and, while\nwaiting for the others to come down, saw a large cabinet photo-\ngraph of my wife on the mantel-shelf. No mention had been\nmade to me of this photograph on this visit, though two months\nbefore Mrs. Whitehead had told me that she believed she had\none somewhere that I might not have seen before. She had\nfound it on the previous day, during my absence at the sitting,\nand placed it where I found it for me to see. It had been taken\nnearly thirty years before.\n(2) On Thursday evening, June 9th, getting back from town\nearlier than I expected, I went into a Cinema, the one almost\nnext door to the\n\"\nHippodrome\n\"\nat Catford. The second film\nshown was\n' '\nThe Devil's Claim,' featuring Sessue Hayakawa.\"\nOne scene was of a man visiting a\n\"\nseer,\" apparently a female\ntrance-medium. The sitting was shown on the film ; medium on\na sofa, apparently in trance, sitter, but no notetaker. There was\nalso what appeared to be a semi-materialisation. I had not looked\nto see what films were being shown before going, nor could\nanything of a spiritualistic nature have been suggested to me by\nthe posters, had I looked at them. I went round next day to\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.\nsee. I had read no review of this film, and believe it was the\nfirst day it was shown there, Thursday. It was apparently\nAmerican in origin. Though frequently I go to Cinemas, I\ncannot recall having seen before any sitting shown so strongly\nresembling in certain points an ordinary trance-sitting.\nMr. Irving has sent us corroborative statements from Mrs.\nWhitehead, and from the Manageress of the Cinema, but it\ndoes not appear necessary to print these statements here.\nThey bear out what Mr. Irving has said in all essentials,\nand in particular the statement from the Manageress confirms\nhis impression that the film in question,\n\"\nThe Devil's Claim,\"\nwas shown at that particular Cinema for the first time on\nJune 9, 1921, the day of Mr. Irving's visit.\nV.\nExtract from Mr. Irving's Sitting with Mrs. Brittain,\nApril 14, 1921.\nBELLE. Have you been a ride in somebody's side-car ? You\ndid not like it at first ; you did not want to trust\nyourself, but after five minutes you did not want to\nget out. She [the communicator, Mrs. Irving] was\nwith you. There was just time to push you in, and\nit was difficult to push you out. The man who\ndrove the car went quick. Was there something\nwrong with the speedgear ? He could not get the\nclutch in, just mounting near the top of the hill.\nW. S. I. Did I get out ?\nB. Yes. He thought he'd have to get out as well as you.\nGlad you did not get in when it was going. It was\ngoing quicker than you thought. You walked up a\nlittle way. It picked up speed.

No.\nYou went along so nice, it created a breeze.\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nSome thirteen days before 1jhe sitting the Rev. D. G. Jones,\nho had been rcently presented by his parishioners with a motor\nrcle and side-car, invited me to go for a long ride in the car.\nWe went nearly sixty miles. It was my first experience of side-\ncars and I was rather nervous for a time owing to the helpless\nposition the passenger is in, and an uncomfortable doubt as to\nle experience of the driver. This proved to be unwarranted.\nPart of the ride was through unknown country. Coming to\nlong hill, Mr. Jones tried to take it on the top gear, as the\nigine was running well. The hill was too long, however, and\ntoo steep. Rather more than half-way up he tried to change to\nlow gear, and missed the clutch, bringing the machine to a halt.\nWe both got out and he tried to start her from the bank beside\nthe road, whilst I ran behind and pushed. After several attempts\nhe succeeded, but as the machine was going too fast, I could\n)t get in. Calling out to me that he would wait at the top\nhe was soon out of sight. I walked about a quarter of a mile\njfore I caught him. It was very hot, a glorious spring day.\n'he machine is not a Douglas or a Chino. A part of the ride\nras through woodland, and Mr. Jones called my attention to the\nipple blossoms by the road, flowers were everywhere, and the\njnery grand. At one point we had to go back half a mile\npick up part of the silencer which had been broken off by a\nstone, and left behind. I take it that knowledge is shown of our\nhaving had to pick up something in the question\n\"\nDid you lose\nyour hat ?\n\"\nI was wearing a cap.\nThe above statement is corroborated by Mr. Jones.\nExtract from Mr. Irving's Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nJune 8, 1921.\nSDA. Oh, about Jones. (Sotto voce. Jones isn't a nice\nname.)\n\"\nIsn't it strange,\" she says,\n\"\nare you\ngoing to see Jones ? He's interested.\" Don't try\nto place it. She was afraid you'd spoil it.\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.\nW. S. I. I've got it ;\nexcellent.\nF. What's he to do with Jones ? She's giving the letter\nL. She says :\n\"\nL isn't Jones, he's somebody else,\nnot you, not Jones, but somebody else, important,\nall mixed up with the same thing.\" Don't think\nof that. L may crop up in a conversation soon.\nLewis. It seemed to Feda like Lewis.\nConcerning the above extract Mr. Irving wrote to Miss Newton,\nthus : June 23, 1921.\nIf you still have the account of the motor-ride given to me\nthrough Mrs. Brittain on April 14 last, and will compare it with\nthe enclosed extract from my last sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nI think you will find it interesting.\nThe one fault in the very correct\n\"\nBrittain\n\"\naccount was\nthe failure to give the name of the man I was with, the\nnearest attempt being H or J. Now, two months later, we get\nthe name given through another medium, and to show that the\n\"\nJones\n\"\nis not a name mentioned at random, it is coupled with\nthe name Lewis.\nMr. Jones and Mr. Lewis are two neighbouring clergy, and\nboth members of the local Clerical Society. A few weeks ago\nI was invited to address the members of this Society on psychical\nmatters. Invited to do so by Mr. Lewis, I was obliged to refuse,\nas the date will clash with a visit to town. . . .\nMr. Jones has been interested since I read him the description\nof our day's outing ; you will recall that he certified my notes\non that record as accurate. I think there is undoubted evidence\nof continuity of thought shown by the communicator through\ntwo mediums, of which I believe we have in the S.P.R. records\nnone too much evidence ;\nso I venture to send it to you.\nIn the\n\"\ndirect\n\"\ncontrol which followed (at the Leonard sitting\nof June 8), there was again an allusion to Mr. Jones, who was\nmentioned by name.\nERRATUM.\nOWING to the misreading of a note in manuscript a misprint\noccurred in the last number of the Journal.

Being a first venture, it made no preten-\nQS to any great formality. The idea of the Danish Society,\nwe were told by their Secretary, Mr. Carl Vett, was merely\ngive a certain number of representatives from different\n>untries the opportunity of meeting one another and establish-\nig a foundation upon which a more systematic scheme for\nle holding of future Congresses might be built, if after a\nirst experiment this seemed desirable.\nIn addition to a considerable number of Danish Members\n)f the Congress about thirty visitors were present, representing\nfourteen different countries, namely, England, America, France,\nrermany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Russia,\nFinland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland. A paper by\nan Indian was read at the Congress, but the author was not\npresent himself. It was generally agreed that the attendance\nat the Congress was quite as large as could be expected\nconsidering the comparatively short notice that was given, and\nthe difficulties of foreign travel at the present time.

DEC., 1921.\nhad no means ready to hand whereby they might get into\ntouch with psychical researchers in different countries. In a\ncountry such as England, where there is a definite and\norganised Society for Psychical Research, the problem was\ncomparatively simple. But there are other countries, such as\nGermany and Italy, where there is a fairly wide-spread interest\nin psychical research, but nothing in the way of a Society on\na large scale.\nWith a view, therefore, to the organisation of the next\nCongress it appeared desirable to establish something in the\nnature of an International Congress Committee, which should\ninclude representatives of as many different countries as\npossible. The principal duty of the Committee as a whole\nwill be to determine the time and place of the next Congress.\nUpon the representatives of each particular country will fall\nthe task of getting into touch with psychical researchers in\ntheir own country, inviting offers of communications to be\nread at the Congress by whatever methods they think best,\nand making a selection amongst those which are offered.\nThe task of organising the detailed arrangements for the\nCongress, the provision of hospitality, lecture-halls, etc., will\nnecessarily fall upon the representatives of the country in\nwhich the Congress is to be held. Upon this point all that\ncan be said at the moment is that at the conclusion of the\nFirst Congress an invitation was received from the repre-\nsentatives of the Institut International de Metapsychique to hold\nthe second in Paris. Cordial thanks were tendered for the\ninvitation, and the matter was referred for decision to the\nInternational Congress Committee as soon as it should be\nformed.\nThe names of the representatives of this Society on the\nInternational Committee are the Hon. Everard Feilding, Sir\nOliver Lodge, F.R.S., Mrs. W. II. Salter, and Dr. V. J.\nWoolley.\nRESOLUTIONS PASSED AT THE CONGRESS.\nAt the Business Meeting held on the last day of the Congress\nthe following Resolutions were passed.\n\fDEC., 1921. International Congress for Psychical Research. 179\nI.\n1\nA Resolution\n\"\nto establish the position of psychical\njsearch in relation to psychology and science in general,\"\nand to affirm in the name of the Congress that\n\"\nso-called\npsychical phenomena ought to be admitted to the domain\nof official science, so that they may be subjected to an\nimpartial scientific criticism aided by all the resources which\nofficial science commands.\"\nThis Resolution was proposed by Dr. Sydney Alrutz,\niconded by Mrs. Salter, and afterwards signed by repre-\nmtatives of fourteen countries.\n2.\n1\nA Resolution to empower the Congress Committee to\nestablish a provisional Secretariat, whose duty it shall be to\nprovide a link between the various national committees with\nview to making arrangements for the next Congress.\nProposed by Monsieur Rene Sudre.\n3. Resolved : that the proposition that a special committee\nbe appointed to consider and if possible prepare a standard\nglossary of technical terms suited to the needs of psychical\nresearch, and to be employed internationally, is referred to\nthe General Committee, with recommendation that they put\nit into effect and that a report be rendered at the Second\nCongress.\nProposed by Dr. Walter Prince.\nCASE.\nM. Cl. 106.\nTHE READING OF CLOSED BOOKS APPARENTLY BY CLAIRVOYANCE.\nWE print below an interesting report on a case in which\npassages from closed books were read apparently by some\nsupernormal means. The names and addresses of the persons\nconcerned are known to the Society, but pseudonyms are\nused here.\nIt will be seen that the case has some analogy with the\nbook-tests obtained through Mrs. Leonard, but whereas in\nthat instance it is only the general sense of a passage which\nis indicated, or at most a word or two of the actual text,\nin the present case considerable passages have been written\n1\nThese resolutions were proposed in French.\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1921.\ndown almost verbatim. Another distinguishing feature of this\ncase as compared with that of Mrs. Leonard is that, ostensibly\nat any rate, there is no question here of any discarnate agent.\nThe percipient inclines to the opinion that she becomes directly\naware of the contents of the books by means of some super-\nnormal power inherent in herself, the exercise of which involves\nsome strain and fatigue.\nIt is to be observed that in two of the instances quoted\nbelow, those of Sidgwick's Methods of Ethics and the A.B.C.\nTime-Table, the book was selected by the observer, whom we\nwill call Mr. Brook, and a fairly long passage from it was\nwritten down by the percipient, whom we will call Mrs.\nJackson, almost immediately afterwards, in the observer's\npresence, neither of them having in the meantime quitted the\nroom. These circumstances appear to rule out both cryptomnesia\nand any opportunity of examining the contents of the book\nconcerned after its selection for the purposes of the test. It\nseems advisable to draw attention to this fact in view of the\nvery remarkable nature of the phenomena involved.\nSince Mrs. Jackson and Mr. Brook prefer to remain\nanonymous, it need only be said that both are known personally\nto several members of the S.P.R. Council, and Mr. Brook, who\nis a man of high professional standing, is a member of the\nSociety. Mrs. Jackson's psychic powers are of comparatively\nrecent development, and she has never made use of them\nprofessionally.\nThe first detailed report we received of this case was con-\ntained in a letter from Mr. Brook to Mrs. Sidgwick, thus :\nMay, 17, 1921.\nAfter reading your most interesting paper in the April Number\nof the Proceedings of the S.P.R. on\n\"\nBook-Tests,\" I venture to\nsend you the results of certain quasi book-tests obtained with or\nthrough my sister-in-law, [Mrs. Jackson], who has for some time\nkept house for me during my wife's last illness, and since my\nwife's death. I may premise that [Mrs. Jackson], who is well\nknown to Sir William Barrett and the Hon. Everard Feilding,\nhas a fair general knowledge of literature, but no specialised\nknowledge of Law or Moral Philosophy ;\nshe has psychic powers,\nwhich have taken various forms, but these, owing to a break-down\nin her health, have for some time ceased.\n\fDEC., 1921. Case. 181\nIn December, 1919, from one or two things which [Mrs. Jackson]\nhad done, it occurred to me that she might possibly have some\nsupernormal knowledge of the contents of a book of which\nnormally she could know nothing. On Dec. 3, 1919, as we were\nsitting alone in my library, I therefore indicated to her a volume\non my shelves Professor Sidgwick's Methods of Ethics, 4th edition\nand asked her to write any passage from that work. Almost\nat once she said,\n\"\nPage 205,\" and commenced to write what\nappears on the document numbered 1, which I enclose. The\npassage is practically word for word the middle paragraph on\npage 205. Very soon afterwards she wrote the few words at the\nend of document 1 which, as slightly expanded, appear on page\n204 of the same volume. I may say that it is\nquite certain\nthat [Mrs. Jackson] has never read the work ;\nI read it once\nmany years ago, after I left Trinity College, Cambridge, but\nnaturally I have retained only a vague knowledge of the general\nprinciples of the subject. My pencil notes on document 1 were\nmade contemporaneously with the writing by [Mrs. Jackson].\nMy note, again contemporaneous with the writing, on the back\nof document 2 explains the circumstances in which it was written.\n[Mrs. Jackson]'s script on the front of the document is the begin-\nning of Chapter I. of the Vicar of Wakefield down to the bottom\nof the page. The edition is one published in Leipsig in 1850\nand intended for German readers. [Mrs. Jackson] had never\nread the Vicar of Wakefield ;\nI had read it very many years\nago, and then, so far as I know, not in that edition.\nThe next document, numbered 3, needs some explanation. On\nDec. 6, 1919, the Railway A. B.C. was in the Library where we\nwere sitting alone. I suggested to [Mrs. Jackson] by way of\nvariant, that she should write down something in the A. B.C.,\nnot suggesting or even thinking of any line of railway. She\nimmediately commenced to write down the trains from Waterloo\nto Leatherhead, herself numbering the page as it appears in her\nwriting. I then checked the writing with the original print, and\nfound only two mistakes, which I have marked in pencil with\na\n\"\ntick.\" Soon afterwards on the same evening I suggested\nthat she should write down the trains from London to Manchester ;\nthis she did, as appears also on document 3. In this I believe\nthere is only one slight error, a\n\"\nd\n\"\nor an\n\"\nr\n\"\nomitted ; un-\nfortunately I did not mark the error at the time. I may say\nthat neither [Mrs. Jackson] nor I ever have occasion to refer to\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1921.\nthe trains between Waterloo and Leatherhead or between Euston\nand Manchester.\nThe next three documents, 4, 5, and 6, pinned together, also\nrequire some explanation. On March llth, 1920, [Mrs. Jackson]\nwas in my Chambers [address given], for about 5 minutes. I\nwas with her all the time. She noticed the title of one of the\nbooks on my shelves Farwell on Powers (3rd edition), and it\nstruck her as a curious title. The book, by the late Lord Justice\nFarwell, is a standard authority on its subject. On the evening\nof the same day she said,\n\"\nI think I could do something from\nFarwell on Powers,\" and immediately wrote the passage on\ndocument 4, pausing long at the words \"as if she were,\" and\nthen giving up for the night. I remember remarking to her\nthat the next words were Norman French, and that I did not\nwonder that she was puzzled : from the subject of the script I\nrecognised it as a quotation from the Married Women's Property\nAct, 1882, and I knew what the next three words must be, viz.\n\"\na feme sole.\" The next morning in the Hampstead Tube [Mrs.\nJackson] wrote the words on document 5, continuing the quota-\ntion omitting the word\n\"\na\n\"\nfrom where she had left off on\nthe previous evening. She had written\n\"\n296\n\"\nat the top of\ndocument 4, so that it was easy to verify the citation, which I\ndid, and found it correct with the exception of only one or two\nwords. The short passage in document 6 is verbatim, I\nbelieve,\nfrom Williams on Bankruptcy (llth edition) at p. 241 ; again the\npage was noted by [Mrs. Jackson] ;\nas my contemporaneous note\nshows, it was written in the Tube on March 15th, 1920. The\nbook was also on the shelves in my Chambers, near Farwell on\nPowers. I cannot now be sure why [Mrs. Jackson] chose a\npassage from Williams on Bankruptcy ;\nbut I am almost certain\nthat it was a random shot on her part, and that it was only\nthe subject matter of the script which gave me the clue to the\nbook.\nSince the date on document 6 we have not attempted any of\nthese quasi book-tests. Having ascertained that [Mrs. Jackson]\ncould reproduce the printed matter in a book with which she was\nentirely unfamiliar for she had never read any of the books\nabove mentioned the mere multiplication of experiments did not\ninterest us, more especially as the concentration on her part was\nvery severe, and involved somewhat acute headache. Moreover,\nshe was much more interested in the production of music, written\n\fDEC., 1921. Case. 183\nout by some form, possibly, of clairvoyance, mixed with clair-\naudience a manifestation of psychic energy which the Hon.\nEverard Feilding has investigated.\nI will not attempt any theory to explain the phenomena of\nthese tests ;\nthis I must leave to those who have had far greater\nexperience in analogous phenomena. I can only suggest that they\nmay perhaps throw some light on the results obtained through\nMrs. Leonard. In [Mrs. JacksonJ's case, verbatim knowledge of\nthe contents of a book was obtained not through the intervention\nof any discarnate entity, but, so far as appears, entirely through\nsome supernormal power which she possessed. She was not in\ntrance when she wrote the passages ;\nshe seemed to be in a\nnormal state, or in only the lightest hypnotic condition : it was\nintense concentration, and nothing else, which, so far as we know,\nproduced the results.\nMay I add that, if our names are suppressed, we are quite\nwilling that you should make any use of this communication\nwhich you may think proper ? . . .\n[T.

Butler\nregards reasonable self love as not merely a normal motive to\nhuman action but as being no less than conscience a chief or\nsuperior principle in the nature of man so that an action becomes\nunsuitable to this nature if the principle of self love be violated.\nAccordingly the aim of his teaching is not to induce men to\nchoose duty rather than interest, but to convince them that there\nis not any inconsistency between the two, that self love and\nconscience lead to one and the same course of life.\n1\nThe original documents were by request returned to Mr. Brook, who has\ncompared them with the proofs of this report, to ensure accuracy.\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

To do her justice, she was a good-natured notable woman,\n& as for breeding there were few country ladies who could show\nmore. She could read any English book without much spelling,\nbut for pickling, preserving, and cookery, none could excel her.\nShe prided herself also upon being an excellent contriver in house-\nkeeping ; though I could never find that we grew richer with all\nher contrivances.

B.].)\nOn receiving Mr. Brook's letter of May 17, 1921, and the\nenclosed documents, Mrs. Sidgwick wrote a letter to Mr.\nBrook in which she put the following questions :\n1. Did the idea of the particular form of experiment occur first\nto you or to [Mrs. Jackson] ? Do you remember what suggested\nit, e.g. was it hearing of the experiments with Mrs. Leonard ?\n2. Are the cases you send all that were tried, or were there\nothers less successful and perhaps not even recorded ?\n3. The page was, I observe, always selected by [Mrs. Jackson],\nexcept in the remarkable instance of the Euston-Manchester\ntrains. The volumes in the December, 1919, experiments were\nselected by you. Do you remember whether your selection was\nat once accepted by [Mrs. Jackson] ? Or did she ever have a\nfeeling that she would be unlikely to succeed with book A, but\nmight succeed with another book, so that it would be more\nworth while to try with the second choice ? And if this ever\nhappened did you change your selection ?\n4. Did [Mrs. Jackson] think her psychical experiences were the\ncause of her break-down in health, and therefore to be avoided\nin future, or did they cease involuntarily owing to the break-\ndown ? You merely state that\n\"\nowing to a break-down in her\nhealth\n\"\nher psychic powers\n\"\nhave for some time ceased.\"\nIn reply to these questions Mr. Brook wrote to Mrs.\nSidgwick, thus : June 6, 1921.\n... I will endeavour to answer your questions.\n1. The particular form of experiment occurred first to me, not\nto [Mrs. Jackson]. We had not heard of the experiments with\nMrs. Leonard. The book-tests seemed to arise naturally from the\n\fDEC., 1921. Case. 187\nmarkable development of [Mrs. JacksonJ's psychic powers in\n;he summer and autumn of 1919 : this development assumed\nvarious forms, e.g. automatic writing, rapid use of the Ouija,\niting music (with correct harmonies), which she had never\nard much of which has not yet been traced etc. By means\nthe Ouija she answered the question :\n\"\nWhat is the name of\n.he spirit [Mrs. Jackson] saw\n\"\non such an occasion ?\nby giving\nthe page and volume of Chambers' Encyclopaedia, on which the\nbiography of Home, the medium, was set out the Ouija answer\nalso stating the name \"\nHome.\" At this time neither of us had\nheard of Home at all ;\nand the reference was quite correct. It\ntherefore occurred to me that she might have clairvoyant power\nas to the contents of a book.\n2. Every case of a book-test was successful, so far as I can\nrecollect. I can only remember two other cases beyond those\nwhich I sent : these are\n(a) a passage from one of Kipling's poems, but in this case\n[Mrs. Jackson] had the book in her hand, open at another\npage, shortly before she wrote the passage ;\nand\n(6) a passage from Dr. Brown's Home Subsecivae. Here, so\nfar as I remember, [Mrs. Jackson] wrote the name of\nthe book and the page, not in the least understanding\nthe title, and having never read the book :\nyou will\nremember it contains that beautiful story,\n\"\nRab and his\nFriends.\" The book was not in the room in which_ she\nwrote, so far as I recollect ; anyhow, I remember very\ndistinctly having great trouble to find it in the drawing-\nroom, where it was tucked away in a niche in a corner\nbook-case.\n3. In every case, except the Manchester-Euston trains, [Mrs.\nickson] named the page. My selection of a volume was always\naccepted by her without demur, and she never wanted a second\nchoice. You will remember, however, that she chose Farwell on\nPowers, and the instances given above (in my answer 2) were\ncases of Tier\nselecting the book.\n4. [Mrs. JacksonJ's psychic experiences were not at all the\ncause of her break-down in health. She is suffering from\nsclerosis of the arteries, which must have been coming on for\nsome time ... I have not thought it wise to attempt any\npsychic work, and her own unaided, or unstimulated power of\nwriting elaborate music seems to have left her. The only psychic\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1921.\nor telepathic experiment we tried at all lately has been\n\"\ntrans-\nference of sensations.\" ... I found that she at once felt a prick\nin any part of the body where I pricked myself, wrist, ankle,\netc. In each case she did not know where I was pricked, as her\neyes were shut. Also, salt in my mouth produced saliva in\nhers, and mustard in mine made her eyes water. The same\ntransference of a prick took place when she did not know that\nI was going to try the experiment, and at a distance of some\nyards. These we regarded as\n\"\npsychic games,\" which could not\naffect her health in any way. [T. BROOK.]\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nBLEEDING STIGMATA.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, In his interesting and fair paper on\n\"\nThe Phenomena\nof Stigmatization,\" Father Thurston lays some stress on the\nclaim that bleeding stigmata have never been experimentally\nproduced ; feeling\n\"\nthat any successful experiment in that\ndirection could not have failed to attract attention and become\nvery widely known.\"\nI find that two or three such cases are mentioned in Human\nPersonality. On p. 497, Vol. I., Myers says, giving references :\n\"\nHaemorrhage and bleeding stigmata were several times produced\nin the famous subject, Louis Vive ... by verbal suggestion\nalone\n\"\n;\non pp. 493-5 of the same volume he quotes at length\na description of the appearance, on Fridays, as a result of hypnotic\nsuggestion, of a cruciform stigma on a woman's chest, accompanied\non one occasion by blood ;\nand on p. 498 he summarises a case\nfrom the Revue de VHypnotisme for February 1892, saying (inter\nalia) :\n\"\nNext it was suggested that instead of the ocular haemor-\nrhage the patient should bleed at the palm of the left hand ;\nthis occurred, the skin, however, remaining intact, and the blood\nappearing to ooze through it like perspiration.\"\nWith regard to the general question of the experimental\nproduction of stigmata, a point to be kept in mind, I think, is\nthat no responsible hypnotist would feel justified (at least, without\nthe full knowledge and consent of the patient and her friends)\nin undertaking experiments with the object of producing such\nextremely painful and distressing symptoms as some of those\ndetailed in Father Thurston's paper.\nThere is also recorded in Human Personality (Vol. I., pp. 456-8)\na case of a man who made a good recovery after being shot\nthrough the heart : not an isolated case, apparently, since it\nwas related in a paper on\n\"\nGunshot Wounds of the Heart,\" read\nbefore the American Surgical Association at New York. This\nbears on another point discussed by Father Thurston in connection\nwith stigmatization. HUBERT WALES.\n\flo. CCCLXXXL VOL.

Of these three Mrs.\nEllis is, according to a statement made b}\n7 Mr. Kimber,\n\"\nundoubtedly the most sensitive.\"\nOur first report of the case was received in June, 1921,\nfrom Colonel C. E. Baddeley, C.M.G., C.B., who is personally\nacquainted with the experimenters, and since that time\nMrs. Sidgwick has also made acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs.\nKimber and with Mrs. Ellis, and has had some correspondence\nwith them. Both Mrs. Sidgwick and Colonel Baddeley have\nformed a high opinion as to the accuracy and good faith\nwith which the experiments have been conducted. In addition\nto the results which we print below, there have been some\nfurther interesting developments in the case on rather different\nlines, and we hope it may be possible to give some report\nof these later.\nWe will first quote an extract from a letter of Colonel\nBaddeley's which gives some account of the way in which the\nexperiments are carried out :\nNow, as to the methods :\nThey use a circular smooth tray with\nraised edge, on the periphery of which the letters of the alphabet\nare pasted. The\n\"\ninstrument\n\"\nused is an inverted glass.\nMr. Kimber puts a pad of cotton wool over the eyes of the\noperators, and a handkerchief bandage over that. He constantly\nmoves the tray around so that the sitters should not know where\nthe letters come. He simply says :\n\"\nyes,\" as the glass points\nto the letters, and does not read out what has come until the\nend of the sentence, when the glass returns to the centre of the\ntray and remains stationary. I need hardly say that all con-\ncerned are intensely in earnest and take the matter very seriously.\nMrs. [Ellis] appears to be the real \"medium,\" although her\nsister appears to have some powers in a lesser degree ;\nshe knew\nnothing about psychic matters until a few months ago when\nMrs. Kimber took her to a sitting with Miss Ortner. On enquiry\nI found that Mrs. [Ellis], when a girl in India, had occasionally\nsat for the Ouija board, and had had results, though at the\ntime it was looked upon as a\n\"\ngame\n\"\nand not taken seriously.\nA statement concerning the blindfolding of the sitters is\n\fj.\\x., v.'j Case. 193\nalso contained in a letter from Mr. Kimber to Mrs. Sidgwick,\nwritten in July, 1921, thus :\nMay I say first of all that at all our sittings we have had test\nconditions so far as we can make them, i.e. careful blindfolding\nof sitters (except myself as note-taker), nothing read out until the\nend of sentence, and the board repeatedly moved round about to\nalter the position of the letters.\nL. 1234.

A friend of theirs, now dead, who is referred to\nbelow as C.D., has apparently been trying to convey messages\nby making audible raps on a jug.

JAN., 1922.\nStatement by Mr. Kimber.\nSeptember Qth-lOth, 1921.\nBetween sleeping and waking on the above date, hearing C.D.\ntap on the jug, I spoke to him, and a few seconds later into\nmy head came the thought of the bookcase in the dining room.\nThen I got the impression top shelf, 14 from left, page 8 line 2.\nThinking I was making this up, I took no heed, but 14-8-2 kept\nringing in my head, so I said :\n\"\nWhat's on that line, please ?\n\"\n\"Cold or snow,\" came into my brain immediately. \"What colour\nis the book ?\n\"\nI asked.\n\"\nRed,\" came at once.\nNext day I forgot all about this until dinner time, when it\ncame again 14-8-2. I wrote down the particulars on an envelope\nand handed this to Mrs. Kimber.\nOn looking we found the fourteenth book from the left, top\nshelf, was\n\"\nField and Hedgerow\n\"\nby Richard Jeffries, and was\nbound in red. The line indicated, taking the last four words of\nline one, reads :\n\"\nIce raining in small shot of frost, howling, sleeting, groaning.\"\nThe sentence before tfyis reads :\n\"\nSnow in broad flakes, snow in semi-flakes, snow raining down\nin frozen specks,\" the word snow occurring three times.\nI have read the book, but certainly not for ten or twelve years,\nprobably more.\nThe books in the bookcase had been dusted and re-arranged\nby the housemaid on September 2nd. Between that date and the\n10th I had been to the bookcase once to fetch a book from the\nbottom shelf, the position of which I knew more or less owing to\nits size, so had not to search for it.\nIn reply to a letter from Mrs. Sidgwick asking whether the\npaper on which Mr. Kimber had written down his impression\nhad been kept, Mrs. Kimber wrote thus :\nNovember 28th, [1921].\nAs regards my husband's\n\"\ndream book-test\n\"\nhe has made a\nthorough search for the envelope that he wrote the book, line,\npage, etc., down on, but is afraid he tore it up, when he was\ntidying his papers. I am, however, witness to the fact that he\ndid write it down at the dinner table and handed it to me before\nhe got up to look for the book.\nGERTRUDE L. KIMBER.\n\fw\na\nThe Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case.\nTHE HOPFGARTEN POLTERGEIST CASE.1\n'he report which we print below is an abstract of the paper read\nin German by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing at the First Inter-\nnational Congress for Psychical Research.]\nthe village of Hopfgarten, near Weimar, there lived a\nock-maker, Ernst Sauerbrey by name, and his second wife,\nMinna. By his first wife he had a son, Otto Sauerbrey, now\n21 years old, and also a clock-maker (in Arnstadt). Since the\nsummer of 1919 the young man had been giving public exhi-\nbitions in hypnotism, spiritism and such things.\nOtto Sauerbrey came to his father's house at Hopfgarten on\nFebruary 10th, 1921, remaining two days, and during that\nperiod he gave an exhibition, and he also hypnotised his\nstepmother. Afterwards, when legal proceedings were taken\nagainst him by the public authorities, he denied this. But\nthere are two witnesses to the fact that he attempted\nsomething in the nature of hypnotic suggestion, and their\nevidence on this point seems quite clear. On February 12th\nOtto Sauerbrey went away.\nFrau Sauerbrey was suffering from an incurable internal com-\nplaint of long standing. She had been bedridden for more\nthan a year, and was in a condition of extreme physical and\nnervous debility. She was at that time using as her bed a\nsofa in the kitchen, and according to the testimony of various\nwitnesses, including the doctor attending her, she was far too\nweak to get up, and could hardly even raise her hand.\nOn the evening of the second day after Otto Sauerbrey's\neparture, according to the evidence of his father, Ernst Sauer-\nbrey, and of his stepsister, Frieda Pappe, who lived in the\nhouse, a sound of loud knocking was heard in the kitchen,\nwhich continued on and off during the whole night. In\nconsequence of the legal proceedings taken against Otto\nSauerbrey some two months later, the evidence of these\ntwo witnesses and of other witnesses also was taken upon\noath, and some extracts from their depositions will presently\n1\nDer Sjmk in ffopfyarten. We have used the word Poltergeist in the title\ngiven because the case is of the type that we usually classify under that\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1022.\nbe quoted. Suffice it at the moment to say that these\nsounds, which are described as resembling blows with the fist\nupon the walls and doors of the room, and upon various\narticles of furniture, were repeated night after night from the\n13th to the 28th of February. There is also some evidence\nfor the movement of objects, such as a jug and water basin,\napparently without any normal cause.\nDuring this period Frau Sauerbrey's physical and mental\ncondition grew noticeably worse. She muttered to herself, her\nmind wandered, and she appeared to be constantly obsessed\nby the idea of her stepson's presence and influence over her.\nIn particular, there was a marked change for the worse on the\n17th of February, and it was observed that on that day at\nabout 11 p.m. the knocking was unusually loud. She spoke\nto her daughter Frieda Pappe of her fear of her stepson ;\nshe\nsaid that she saw his eyes before her during the night, and\nrefused to be argued out of this belief.\nOn the 27th of February the police from Weimar were\ncalled in ; they heard the rapping, and one of them witnessed\nthe movement of an object apparently without any contact.\nOn the 28th of February the police called in a nerve-\nspecialist, Dr. Kahle, and he succeeded by counter-suggestion\nin freeing Frau Sauerbrey from her obsession about her stepson.\nShe called out : \"I am now free.\" From that moment the\nphenomena ceased, and they never occurred again.\nOn the 27th of March, 1921, Frau Sauerbrey died of the\ninternal complaint from which she was suffering.\nThere is no doubt at all in this case that the phenomena\ncentred entirely about Frau Sauerbrey, and were in some cases\nthe result of the curious mental condition into which she fell\nas a result of Otto Sauerbrey's attempt to hypnotise her.\nThe interest of the case from a psychical standpoint turns, in\nthe first instance, upon the question whether it is possible to\nestablish beyond doubt that Frau Sauerbrey could not have\ncaused the phenomena by normal means. Upon this point the\nthree principal witnesses were all in complete agreement, and\ntheir evidence was considered conclusive by the magistrate\nbefore whom the case against Otto Sauerbrey was tried.\n\fAX., 11)22. The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case. 201\nEVIDENCE OF WITNESSES ON OATH.\n1. Dr. Scharff.\nThe evidence of Dr. Scharff, who attended Frau Sauerbrey\nuring the period concerned, is confined to the question of her\n.ental and physical condition. Dr. Scharff testifies that in his\npinion Frau Sauerbrey was physically incapable of producing the\neffects observed owing to her extreme weakness.\n2. Ernst Sauerbrey.\nMy wife lay in the kitchen. Since October, 1919, she had been\ncontinuously in bed, except that once, on New Year's Day, 1920,\nshe left her bed for half an hour. But in consequence of her\nbodily weakness she had to lie down again.\nOn the second day after my son's departure, about February 12,\nI heard in the night a sound of knocking on the table and on\nthe walls. I slept in the room next the kitchen. My wife drew\nmy attention to the knocking and said I should see who it was\nthat knocked. I went into the kitchen, and having observed that\nthe knocking came from there, I made a thorough search, but\nfound nothing. As soon as the light was lit, the knocking stopped.\nI went to bed again. Shortly afterwards the knocking was again\nheard. It was very loud. My wife lay on a sofa in the kitchen,\nand remained quite quiet. As the knocking went on all night,\nI woke my step-daughter, Frieda Pappe, and she remained awake\nthrough the rest of the night. These psychic manifestations began\nagain on the second night. The knocking was heard from six\no'clock in the evening to seven o'clock in the morning. On one\nof the next nights a few objects moved. A coffee-cup, which stood\nupon a chair in the kitchen, fell from the chair which was moving\naway from under it, and was broken to pieces. In the same way\na table moved, and a jug and water basin. It is quite impossible\nthat my wife should have brought these things about herself.\nBecause we could no longer get any sleep at night, my step-\ndaughter went to Weimar and informed the police of what had\noccurred. Next night eight of the police came from Weimar, and\nsurrounded the house. Some of the police came into the house,\nand these witnessed the psychic manifestations, which occurred on\nthat night also. In the presence of Commissioner of Police Pfeil,\nfrom Weimar, some objects were set out in the middle of the\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1922.\nroom at a distance of two metres from my wife's bed. It was\nobserved that these objects also moved from the place where\nthey were standing, without any one coming into contact with\nthem. A sound of knocking was also heard. The next night the\npolice came again, accompanied by Dr. Kahle. That night the\nsound of knocking was again audible. On the night after that\nwe heard nothing more.\n3. Frieda Pappe.\nMy mother spoke much to me of the accused. She told me\nthat she was afraid of him and that when night came on she\nsaw his eyes ;\nit always seemed to her as though the accused\nwere in the kitchen. I argued this with her, and tried to talk\nher out of it. On the second day after the accused went away\nfor the last time, about February 13, we heard a sound of knock-\ning on the kitchen door. On the second night we heard it also\non the table and the chair in the kitchen, where my mother was\nlying. My mother was not responsible for these noises. As soon\nas a light was lit, the noises became less loud.\nIt is quite impossible that my mother should have moved the\narticles or made the knocking herself, because in the presence of\nthe police we made experiments, and moved the objects so far\nfrom my mother's sofa that she could not reach them ;\nand yet\nthey moved from their places. I noticed that the objects, chair,\njug, water-basin and so forth, moved away from my mother.\nWhen there was knocking and my mother answered, the noise\nceased. The knocking could be heard all night long. A chair\nand a jug which stood next to each other knocked loudly together.\n4. Walter DegenMbe, Tailor.\nDuring the time now in question I went to Hopfgarten nearly\nevery Sunday. (He then gives an account of how he saw the\naccused stroke Frau Sauerbrey over the forehead and say a few\nwords to her.) On the second night, after I arrived, I heard\na sound of knocking on the furniture and on the walls. It is\nquite impossible that Frau Sauerbrey should have made these\nnoises. She lay quiet, and I must have seen if she had moved.\nI also saw a chair and a table move from their places, and I saw\na cup fall off a chair and break to pieces.\nOn Monday evening the police came. Frau Sauerbrey was\nhardly aware of the manifestations. She merely said :\n\"\nSome\n\fFAN., 1922. The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case. 203\none's knocking.\" She also told us how she always saw the\naccused in her dreams.\n5. Dr. Kahle.\nHis testimony need not be given here at any length. He gave\nevidence on behalf of the accused, and was mainly concerned\nwith the question of how far Otto Sauerbrey could be held\nresponsible for the harm which his treatment appeared to have\ndone to his stepmother. As regards the physical phenomena\nDr. Kahle only heard a few raps, which in the circumstances in\nwhich he heard them might easily have been caused by the sick\nwoman. He concluded that she had caused them, and drew\nattention to the fact that in an abnormal psychical condition a\nperson may become capable of performing physical feats of which\nthey are not normally capable. As regards the greater part of\nthe physical manifestations, however, Dr. Kahle was not an eye-\nwitness.\nThose are the statements of the witnesses at the trial, made\nupon oath. Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing also obtained a state-\nment from the magistrate who tried the case, which includes\nsome rather important evidence given to him by the police.\nSTATEMENT BY THE MAGISTRATE, Justizrat Thierbach.\nAccording to the statements made to me by Frau Sauerbrey's\nhusband and her daughter, Frieda, who were with her during\nthe whole period in question statements made in a quite unpre-\njudiced manner it is quite impossible that Frau Sauerbrey should\nhave brought about the noises and movements herself. She lay\nupon the sofa in such a condition of weakness that she was no\nlonger capable of lifting her hand.\nEspecially noteworthy are the following points :\nA jug with water in it was set by a police-officer at the kitchen\ndoor, and moved from there towards Frau Sauerbrey.\n1\nThe table\nshook to such an extent that a person had to grip the table-leg\nbetween his knees in order to make writing possible. When the\nhusband was in the next room, there was a sound upon the door\nas though some one had struck it with his fist.\n1\nIt will be observed that according to the testimony of Frieda Pappe\nobjects more frequently moved aicay from Frau Sauerbrey.\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt. JAN., 1022.\nGenerally speaking the movements were more marked in pro-\nportion to their nearness to Frau Sauerbrey.\nThe statements made by Frau Sauerbrey's family were con-\nfirmed to me by other reliable eye-witnesses.\nFURTHER STATEMENT MADE IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS PUT BY\nDR. VON SCHRENCK-NOTZING.\n(1) What was the lighting ?\nAn electric lamp over the table.\n(2) Were there any manifestations by daylight ?\nNo, only by artificial light. The earliest time at which the\nmanifestations began was 5 p.m. The nearer it got to evening,\nthe more restless Frau Sauerbrey became.\n(3) What was the nature of the knocking heard ?\nAs though made by striking with the knuckles or with the\nfist. The knocking moved constantly about, as could be judged\nby the sound. Often knocking was heard in two different places ;\nthere were also knocking and movements of objects simultaneously.\nFrieda Pappe made the following statement : \"I looked to see\nwhether my mother's knuckles were injured, but found nothing.\"\n(4) Detailed statement by Commissioner of Police Pfeil.\nA police-officer set a jug of water two metres away from Frau\nSauerbrey. At the very moment that he turned away, the jug\nwas already in motion. The same thing happened with a water\nbasin. A dog, which at other times was unusually bold, when\nthe manifestations began became unusually timid. The clock\nstopped, although according to the statement of Sauerbrey, who\nis a clock-maker, there was nothing wrong with it. Sometimes a\nnoise was heard as though some one were stroking the furniture\nwith the flat of his hand.\nThese observations were made by some ten or twelve police\nwhom Pfeil had sent out. They saw everything either through\nthe open kitchen door, or through the key-hole.\nEXTRACT FROM DR. VON SCHRENCK-NOTZING's CONCLUSION.\nThe occurrences which were observed in the case of the Hopf-\ngarten poltergeist are consistently simple, and include, so far as\nany evidence before us is concerned, only sounds of knocking and\n\f?., 1922. The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case. 205\nie movements of objects without contact, that is to say, that\nof mediumistic phenomena which are called telekinetic.\n(Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing goes on to point out that there\nbe no question here of hallucination ;\nthe sounds which were\nleard were clearly objective, as indicated by the fact that they\nwere heard by every one who went to the house. After discussing\nthe difficulty of supposing that Frau Sauerbrey in her weak\ncondition could produce the phenomena by normal means, and\nlaying particular stress on the incident when the water-jug moved\nin the police-constable's presence, he goes on :)\nOf the many witnesses of these phenomena only the two mem-\nbers of the family and the tailor Degenkolbe, who was frequently\nin the Sauerbrey house, were called upon to make statements\nupon oath. But amongst other witnesses we may especially\nmake mention here of the police-officers, to say nothing of\nneighbours and inhabitants of the village, whom curiosity brought\ninto the haunted house. Not a single eye or ear-witness was\never able to detect in the sick woman the agent of a deliberately\nfraudulent\n\"\nspirit\n\"\nmanifestation. . . .\nThe peculiarity of the Hopfgarten case in comparison with other\nsimilar occurrences lies in the close connection between the pheno-\nmena and the hypnoidal state of Frau Sauerbrey. It is clear\nthat on February llth, when she was hypnotised by her stepson\nfor it is evident from the statement of witnesses that he did\nattempt to hypnotise her Frau Sauerbrey was not sufficiently\nfreed from his suggestion. She remained for 17 days in a light\ndream or twilight condition, or rather, she constantly fell into it\nagain, until Dr. Kahle freed her from it by a counter-suggestion on\nFebruary 28th. Her whole condition, so far as it can be portrayed\nto us by the observations of laymen, points to this conclusion.\nShe converses with her absent stepson, she sees his eyes turned\nupon her as though he were present . . . she calls out, she is\nrestless, she shows fear of the hypnotiser, she thinks in her\ndelirium that the imaginary tempter is trying to compel her to\nsteal her neighbour's hens [this refers to an incident not quoted\nin this abstract]. During this time she is to a considerable\nextent sleepless, she becomes restless, and gives signs of suffering\npain, when the physical manifestations begin. Her whole manner\nof behaviour reminds one of the trance condition of physical\nmediums (such as Eusapia Palladino and Eva C.) which similarly\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1922.\naccompanies the inception of the phenomena, as a result of a\nstrong psychomotor reaction. . . .\nIt would therefore seem that the psychical manifestations in\nthe case before us are to be interpreted as physical phenomena\nof a mediumistic type, occurring spontaneously and closely con-\nnected with a definite change in the state of consciousness of the\nperson concerned. It will now be rightly asked :\nHad the manifestations of the Hopfgarten poltergeist any in-\ntelligent cause or not ?\nOn this point the material before us leads unfortunately to no\nconclusion. We fincl nothing in the shape of the personification\nof a transcendental agent, as nearly always takes place with\nmediums. The case did not acquire any religious or spiritistic\ncolouring, presumably because those who took part in these\noccurrences never thought of such a thing. If some intelligent\nobserver had been present, the possibility might have arisen of\nsystematising the phenomena and guiding them according to the\nobserver's wish, a suggestion which is supported by Police-Com-\nmissioner Pfeil's experiment with the water-jug.\nBut, on the other hand, just that lack of any religious or super-\nstitious meaning in the case before us is particularly interesting\nand characteristic. For it points to an unregulated exteriorisation\nof vital forces in a person suffering from severe illness, which\nforces, as a result of a peculiar and temporary psychic condition,\nbroke bounds in unruly fashion.\nEDITORIAL NOTE.\nThe above case appears to be of special interest not only\nfor the reasons mentioned by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing in\nhis conclusions, but also because the supernormal character of\nthe physical manifestations is more clearly established than is\ncommon with this type of spontaneous phenomena. It often\nhappens that such cases are observed under very difficult\nconditions. There may be several people whose possible com-\nplicity in producing them has to be taken into account, and\nthe phenomena may occur in a number of different places, so\nthat the observer does not know where to watch.\nIn the case now in question the issue was extremely simple.\nThe manifestations centred entirely about Frau Sauerbrey ;\n\fJAN., i(\nJ22. The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case. 207\nthere is not the slightest reason for supposing that any other\njrson was in any way concerned in producing them, and they\nonly in the one room in which Frau Sauerbrey lay.\n[t is also to be observed that although the phenomena did not\njur by daylight, they did occur by artificial light, and not\nly in the dark. Under these circumstances it seems to be\n[tremely improbable that a considerable number of witnesses,\n>me of whom had very good opportunities for observation\n[tending over a period of more than two weeks, should in no\nstance have detected Frau Sauerbrey's actions, had she been\nlucing the phenomena by normal means.\nNOTE.\nA VERIDICAL IMPRESSION RECEIVED DURING A FATAL\nILLNESS.\nIN the recently published Memoir of the Eight Hon. Sir E.\nFry by his daughter (Oxford University Press, 1921), there\nappears upon page 17 an account of a veridical impression\nconcerning a distant event received by a child during her\nlast illness. The date of the occurrence makes it impossible\nto obtain any corroborative evidence, but it seems worth while\nto quote the passage here for reference.\n(Sir E. Fry's mother in addition to her own large family took\ncharge of four children from Trinidad.)\nIn connexion with these children a curious case of second sight\noccurred. One of the little girls was so ailing in England that\nit was decided to send her home to Trinidad. After her departure\nthe other sister became seriously ill, and in spite of all Mrs. Fry's\ntender care died.\nWhen very ill the child said that she had seen her sister\nlying in a white box, and with a little white thing on her chest.\nThis was reported to the parents, from whom it was afterwards\nlearned that the other daughter had died after her arrival at\nhome, and, as a post-mortem examination had taken place, a\npiece of white plaster had been placed over the wound.\n(See also Spectator, December 29, 1894, contribution\" by Sir\nE.

Cave, Mr. F. C. Con-\nstable, Miss S. M. Kingsford, and Mr. Sydney C. Scott).\nThe Report of the Council for 1921 was read. 1\nTHE HON. TREASURER (Mr. W. H. Salter), in presenting the\nFinancial Statement for the year, said that the Society started\nthe year with a balance in hand of 255 14s. Od., and\nended it with a balance of 57 19s. 5d., but this included a\nloan of 100 which it had been necessary to borrow from the\nEndowment Fund. ... He had recently had the opportunity\nof speaking to one of the principals of our firm of publishers\nand discussing the cost of printing, which, it appeared, had\nreached in April last a figure that it had never reached before ;\nbut since then there had been a steady decline which it was\nthought would be progressive. Provided our Members would\ndo all that they could to help the financial resources of the\nSociety, the outlook for the coming year was, he thought,\nbrighter. But unless the Society's funds could be increased,\nits usefulness as a research society would be severely ham-\npered. The Council had appointed a paid research officer, and\nthis would involve not only his salary, but the incidental\nexpenses of travelling, etc., and there would necessarily be the\nreports which he would furnish for publication, thereby in-\ncreasing our printers' bill ;\nbut he believed that this would\nbring an increased membership to the Society.\nTHE CHAIRMAN, rising to move the adoption of the Report\nand the Financial Statement, said that he thought that the\nSociety was to be congratulated on having found a young\nman a man with some youth still before him as a research\n1\nThis Report, together with the Financial Statement for the year, will be\nprinted in the Journal for March.\n\fFEB., 1922. Annual General Meeting of Members. 213\nofficer. Mr. Gardner Murphy also seemed to be an important\nasset to the Society. He might not be known to many of our\n[embers, being an American, but he was specially learned in\nic subject and very keen to go on with the work. The\nlifficulty that the Treasurer mentioned about the expenses of\niblication was one that all scientific societies had suffered\nmi since the War.\nHe moved that the Keport and Financial Statement be\nlopted. The resolution, which was supported by Mr. Pidding-\nton and Miss Radclyffe-Hall, was carried unanimously.\nThe Chairman announced that five of the retiring Members\nof the Council offered themselves for re-election, and that to\nfill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Dr. C. Lloyd\nTuckey, the Et. Hon. G. W. Balfour proposed, and Mr. J. G.\nPiddington seconded, Mr. W. H. Salter, Hon. Treasurer of the\nSociety, who was a co-opted Member of the Council. No other\nnominations having been received, the following were declared\nto be duly elected Members of the Council : Mr. W. W.\nBaggally, Eev. M. A. Bayfield, Dr. T. W. Mitchell, Mr. W. H.\nSalter, Mr. Sydney C. Scott, and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nThe Minutes of the last Extraordinary General Meeting held\non November llth, 1921, were presented to the Chairman, and\nhe read brief extracts and referred to the full report which\nhad been printed in the Journal for December, 1921.\nCONVERSAZIONE.\nA CONVERSAZIONE was held for Members and Associates and\nfriends in the Council Chamber at 20 Hanover Square, London,\nW., on Tuesday, January 31st, 1922, at 4.30 p.m., when a\nrepresentative collection of automatic drawings and paintings\nwere on view. Some of these, by Mrs. Watts, are in the\npossession of the Society ;\nfor the loan of others we have to\nthank the artists, Miss Bligh Bond, Mrs. Diver, and Mr. C. W.\nHorsfall. There were also on view some reproductions of\nautomatic paintings by Signor Nunes-Vais, which he has kindly\npresented to the Society. Mrs. Diver also has presented to the\nSociety one of the paintings shown at the Conversazione, and\nwe take this opportunity of thanking her.\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.\nMr. Bligh Bond gave an interesting account of the beginning\nand development of his daughter's power, and the way in\nwhich her pictures were produced ;\nand Dr. Woolley gave\nsome interesting details in regard to the work of Mrs. Diver,\nMr. Horsfall, and Signor Nunes-Vais.\nCASE.\nM. Cl. 108.\nWE print below a case in which a veridical impression con-\ncerning an event occurring at a distance was received, either\nelairvoyantly or, perhaps, telepathically, by a subject in hyp-\nnosis. Our first report of the incident was contained in the\nfollowing letter from Captain F. McDermott, I. A., to Mrs. Salter :\nJuly 18, 1921.\nI am sending the following case of apparent clairvoyance for\nthe consideration of the Society :\nWhile at St. Ives, Cornwall, I recently did a series of hypnotic\nexperiments with a friend, Mr. M. C. Naylor. In several of them\nhe claimed to be able to see at a distance, but as in each case\nthe place was verbally suggested by me I placed no importance\non what he said and attributed it merely to auto-suggestion.\nI determined, however, to try a test case, and accordingly\nasked him (while under hypnosis) to tell me what was going on\nin my own home [in Essex]. He replied that he was in the\ndrawing-room (with which he is familiar) and that an old lady\nwith iron grey hair, dressed in black, was sitting in a chair with\nher back to the window. On being questioned he replied that\nhe did not know the lady, but that she was wearing a hat and\nher face appeared to be darkened by something like a veil,\nalthough it might only be shadow, as the light was not on, and\nthe daylight was fading. He said that she was speaking to my\nmother and that the conversation was as follows :\nVisitor. And where is Frank ?\nMy Mother. Away in Cornwall for a holiday.\nVisitor. Where ? At St. Mawes ? [I was at St. Mawes a\nshort time ago.]\nMy Mother. No, not this time. He is at St. Ives with a\nfriend.\n\f-KB., 1922. Case. 215\nDuring the conversation my uncle (my mother's brother) came\nand spoke to both. Shortly after this my mother left the\nm, leaving my uncle and the old lady together.\nThis experiment was performed at 9.30 p.m. on Monday, the\n)th June, 1921. On Tuesday I wrote to my mother (letter\niclosed). I must explain that previous to this I have several\nles tried the well-known experiment of projecting my\n\"\ndouble\n\"\nor\n\"\nastral\n\"\ninto my mother's room, but never with evidential\nsuccess. On receiving my letter, therefore, she imagined I was\nreferring to a similar experiment, and replied that nothing had\noccurred.\nOn returning home, however, I learned that not only had a\nlady answering the description called on that evening, but that\nevery one of the other details given me was absolutely correct,\nincluding the main points of the conversation, although in view\nof the time that had elapsed my mother will not guarantee\nthat the extract given is verbatim. The old lady, who is not a\nregular visitor, was wearing a veil.\nThe events mentioned occurred at about 7.45 p.m., whereas\nour experiment, as previously stated, took place at 9.30 p.m.\nThis does not to my mind detract from the interest of the case,\nas I have observed that many so-called veridical cases bear a\ndiscrepancy as regards time.\nI may add that Mr. Naylor has on occasions, while under\nhypnosis, described rooms with which I am familiar and he is\nnot, with a fair amount of accuracy, but usually with some\nwrong details.\nAmnesia is never present with him after hypnosis, and I am\ntherefore asking him and my mother to attest the above as far\nas each is concerned.\nHe has recently been elected a Member of the Society, and\nalthough I myself am shortly returning to India, I hope a friend\nmay be able to continue the experiments, in which case further\nmatter of interest may be obtained.\nF. McDERMOTT, Capt. LA.\nI hereby certify that all the details in the above are correct\nso far as they concern myself.\nA. McDERMOTT.\nM. C. NAYLOR.\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.\nEnclosed with the above was Captain McDermott's letter\nto Mrs. McDermott (to. which he refers). It ran thus :\nPORTHMINSTER HOTEL,\nST. IVES, CORNWALL,\n21 st June, 1921.\nMY DEAR MOTHER,\n. . .\nBy the way did you have anybody visit you last\nnight (Monday) ? Think it out carefully before you reply, as\nit concerns an experiment Mark and myself did. Don't leave\nanybody out even F ! Let me have a reply as soon as\nyou can . . . FRANK.\n(Note. I purposely made this letter indefinite, as I did not\nwish to mention details which my mother might\n\"\nread back\/'\nI was also careful in this respect when questioning her.\nF. McDERMOTT.)\nIn reply to these communications Mrs. Salter wrote to\nCaptain McDermott asking for additional information on one\nor two points, and for an independent statement from Mrs.\nMcDermott, and from Captain McDermott's uncle, Mr. Peel.\nMrs. Salter pointed out in her letter that as regards the\nhypothesis that Mr. Naylor had derived his impression clair-\nvoyantly, the following point must be considered. It was not\nat all unusual for impressions of a telepathic nature to be\ndeferred, the generally accepted hypothesis being that such\nimpressions had remained latent in the percipient's mind and\nemerged when for some reason or another the percipient's\nmental condition favoured the emergence of sub-conscious\nideas. In the case of clairvoyance it was usually supposed\nthat the percipient became supernormally aware of some\nexternal event actually occurring at the time of the clair-\nvoyance. In the case now in question the event of which\nMr. Naylor became aware had occurred before the beginning\nof the experiment, and if, therefore, it was supposed that\nhe had become aware of it clairvoyantly, it would seem to\nfollow that he had exercised this faculty in his normal state,\nthe only effect of the hypnosis being to bring the submerged\nimpression to the surface.\n\fFEB., 1922. Case. 217\nIn reply to Mrs. Salter's letter Captain McDermott wrote\nas follows :\nJuly 26, 1921.\n... As requested I am enclosing an independent account from\nmy mother and uncle.\nThe point which seems to be doubtful is when the conversation\ntook place (see below). However, I cannot help thinking that\nin any case little evidential value can be placed on the conversa-\ntion, as the subject was a very likely one for discussion between\nany visitor and my mother, and Mr. Naylor, of course, knew\nthat I had visited St. Mawes. He also knew that my uncle\nwas in the house. Two of the details could, therefore, be ex-\nplained by chance, but the remainder is absolutely outside his\nknowledge, and it is an interesting point to note that he had\nnever seen or discussed with me any visitor to my house even\nvaguely resembling the description given.\nAs regards a theory to account for the case, I agree that the\ndiscrepancy in time is against clairvoyance as an explanation.\nHowever, there also seem to be difficulties in the way of putting\nit down to latent telepathy. I am of course familiar with the\nwell-known cases where information has apparently lain dormant\nin a percipient's mind, and afterwards been conveyed to him by\nhallucination, or otherwise. But this case differs therefrom in\nthat the information obtained was consciously selected and asked\nfor by me, without being consciously in my mind.\nThe only theory which prima facie appears to cover it is the\nbewildering one of cosmic consciousness. . . .\nF. McDEEMOTT, Capt. I. A.\nEnclosed with Captain McDermott's letter were the following\nconfirmatory statements from Mrs. McDermott and Mr. Peel\nin the form of a letter to Mrs. Salter :\nJuly 27, 1921.\nMy son has shown me your letter requesting details concerning\nthe visit of an old lady on Monday, the 20th June, 1921.\nThe lady in question came here early in the afternoon, had\ntea with me, and left about 8 p.m. or shortly before. I cannot\nof course remember exactly what conversation took place between\nus, but I do remember her asking after my son, on which I\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.\nreplied that he was in Cornwall. Whereupon she said :\n\"\nOhr\nat St. Mawes,\" (a place he had previously visited several times),\nand I replied :\n\"\nNo, at St. Ives this time\n\"\nor words to that\neffect. I do not, however, think this took place just before\nmy brother came into the room. It was probably some consider-\nable time before. At about 7.45 p.m., shortly before the visitor\nleft, she was sitting dressed in black and wearing a hat and\nveil in a seat with her back to the window.\nMy brother came into the room and I immediately left. I\ndistinctly remember this, because I had been worrying about my\nmother who is an invalid, and was wondering if she required\nanything, but did not wish to leave the visitor alone. I therefore\ntook the opportunity afforded by the entrance of my brother\nof leaving somebody else to carry on the conversation.\nThis particular old lady had not visited me for several months\nprevious to the day mentioned.\nThere is one other lady who visits here and who answers the\ndescription, but I am not sure whether she usually wears a\nveil. She too has not been here for many months now.\nA. McDERMOTT.\nWith reference to the foregoing I beg to certify that about\nthe time mentioned I entered the drawing-room in which my sister\nwas talking to a Mrs. H ,\nan old lady wearing black with\nhat and veil on, and sitting with her back to the window. On\nmy entering my sister left the room. I did not hear the con-\nversation referred to. THOS. E. PEEL.\nWith regard to the question of how Mr. Naylor obtained\nhis information, it is possible to suppose if we take the\ntelepathic hypothesis that Captain McDermott obtained the\nknowledge himself telepathically and transmitted it, again\ntelepathically, to Mr. Naylor at the time of the experiment. If\nthat were so, the fact that this piece of information was lying\ndormant in Captain McDermott's mind might account for the\nparticular question he put to Mr. Naylor. But our knowledge\nas to how such incidents occur is at present so imperfect\nthat there is little use in theorising. It is with a view to\nincreasing our knowledge that it is important to put on record\n\fSB., 1922.\nExperiment in Faking \"Spirit\" Photographs.\nmany instances as possible in which information appears\nhave been supernormally acquired.\nIt is to be noted that Mr. Naylor's allusion to the failing\night made with reference to the shadow on the old lady's\n-appears to be based on the circumstances obtaining\nthe time of the experiment, 9.30 p.m. summer time (8.30\n.m. Greenwich time) rather than on the circumstances obtain-\nig at the time when the actual event in question occurred.\nLccording to Mrs. McDermott's statement the visitor left her\nhouse at 8 p.m. summer time, or a little before. At 7 p.m.\n(Greenwich time) on the 20th of June the sun is still well\nabove the horizon and it is still broad daylight, especially\nin such a cloudless summer as we had last year ;\nthere would\ncertainly be no question of having the light on, as Mr. Naylor\nappears to suggest.\nAN EXPERIMENT IN FAKING \"\nSPIRIT \"\nPHOTOGRAPHS.\nBY THE HON. EVERARD FEILDING.\nMR. JAMES DOUGLAS, of the Sunday Express, having recently\nhad a sitting with Mr. Hope, the\n'\nspirit photographer\n'\nof\nCrewe, at which an extra was successfully introduced, issued\nan invitation to any expert in photography to attempt to\ndo the same under similar conditions by a normal process.\nThis invitation was accepted by Mr. William Marriott, and\nthe experiment was duly carried out at the College of Psychic\nScience on December 5. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Mr.\nJ. Hewat M'Kenzie, Principal of the College, were, with\nMr. Marriott's concurrence, invited to attend by Mr. Douglas,\nand Mr. Dean, Art Editor of Pearson's Magazine, and myself,\nwith Mr. Douglas' concurrence, by Mr. Marriott. The object\nof the experiment was not to create test conditions for Mr.\nMarriott, but to test the value of his expressed opinion that\nthe conditions described by Mr. Douglas in the Sunday Express\nof November 6 as having prevailed at his sitting with Mr.\nHope were not sufficiently strict to prevent trickery, and that\nworking under precisely the same conditions, he would be able\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.\nto imitate Mr. Hope's results. At a preliminary conversation\nit was, at Mr. Douglas' request, agreed that he should be\nregarded as the sole referee, and his decision on any points\nof dispute that might arise be accepted as final. It was also\nagreed that if\nany of the observers noticed any departure from\nthe prescribed conditions they should at once say so, but this,\nI understood, was to be the limit of our functions. As the\nproceedings have been fully described in the issue of the\nSunday Express of December 11, 1921, I need not give a\ndetailed account of them, and limit myself to saying that the\ncamera (Mr. Marriott's, but of the same type as that used by\nMr. Hope) and the slide were examined in all their parts by\nthe committee, that Mr. Douglas brought his own plates, and\nthat a stenographer was present to whom was dictated at the\ntime all that occurred. According to these notes the packet\nremained in full view until the moment when Mr. Douglas, after\nallowing Mr. Marriott to slit it open while he held it, dis-\nappeared with it into the dark room with Mr. Marriott. Mr.\nDouglas then dictated from inside that he had opened the\npacket and asked Mr. Marriott which plates he desired to use.\nMr. Marriott selected the first and third. Mr. Douglas took out\nthe first, inserted it in the carrier, placed the black cardboard\non the top of it, then took out the third plate and placed\nit also in the carrier, closed the carrier, then closed the\npacket of plates and put them in his pocket. Mr. Marriott\ndrew the slide back and Mr. Douglas signed the plates, holding\nthe slide in his hand. On the return of Mr. Marriott and\nMr. Douglas from the dark room, Mr. M'Kenzie on examining\nthe slide said it was not the same as that which he had seen\nbefore they went into the dark room. Mr. Douglas, on the\nother hand, stated it had not left his possession. Mr. M'Kenzie,\nhowever, continued to insist that there had been a mark\non the one slide which he could not find on the other, and\nthere accordingly arose a question as to what should be\ndone. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle expressed the opinion that\nif such an emergency had arisen in a Hope sitting they would\nhave insisted either on an examination of Mr. Hope's person\nto see if he had concealed about him a duplicate slide, or\nelse on his replacing the plates. It was, however, clear that\n\fFEB., 1922.\nExperiment in Faking\n\"\nSpirit\n\"\nPhotographs. 221\nich an emergency had not arisen in Mr. Douglas's sitting\ntith Mr. Hope, and Mr. Marriott pointed out that a search\n)f his person would be a departure from the agreed con-\nlitions and said that on that ground he objected to a search,\n[r. Douglas supported him in this, but suggested that he\nit be allowed to verify if the plates contained in the\nlide were those which he had signed. Mr. Marriott agreeing\nthis, they returned to the dark room and, on emerging,\n:.\nDouglas reported that he had found that by some mistake\nic had signed one plate twice and the other not at all, but\ntat he had rectified this and had now signed the latter\nite also. Mr. M'Kenzie asked if Mr. Marriott would allow\nlimself to be searched after the experiments, and to this\n:. Marriott agreed. Mr. Marriott then focussed the camera\nid placed in it the slide handed to him by Mr. Douglas.\nTwo photographs were then taken, first of Mr. Douglas\nand Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and then of Sir Arthur alone,\nMr. Marriott drawing and reversing the slide and exposing\nthe plate by lifting the black cloth, as is usual in the Hope\nprocedure. Mr. Marriott then said he wished to make two\nmore exposures, Mr. Hope having used four plates. As, how-\never, he said he had only brought one slide, a cardboard box\nhad to be produced by Mr. M'Kenzie to put the already\nexposed plates into. On this occasion Mr. Marriott invited all\nthe committee to go into the dark room to observe how the\nfirst two plates had been loaded and signed by Mr. Douglas ;\nand all went in except myself. Mr. Douglas dictated from\ninside that he took the plates from the carrier and put them\ninto the cardboard box, and put two new plates into the\ncarrier and signed them. Two more exposures were then made\nas before, after which all the committee except myself again\nwent into the dark room to watch the development. Mr.\nDouglas placed all the plates into the developing dish and Mr.\nMarriott poured on the developer and developed. While the\nplates were in the fixing bath Mr. M'Kenzie again raised the\nquestion of the alleged substituted slide and asked if Mr.\nMarriott was prepared to be searched. Mr. Marriott consented,\nand Mr. M'Kenzie proceeded to search him. He found nothing,\nhowever, except a round object in the breast-pocket or lining\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.\nof Mr. Marriott's coat, which he asked to examine. But as\nMr. Marriott pointed out that what he was searching for was\na slide, he did not persist in this. The dark room was also\nsearched for a slide but unsuccessfully. When the plates\nwere examined, the plate which Mr. Douglas had signed twice\nrevealed an\n'\nextra\n'\nin the shape of a young woman with\nup-cast eyes between him and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, while\none of the plates of Sir Arthur alone showed a ring of fairies\ndancing round him.\nIt is evident that no special conclusion on the main question\nof the authenticity of spirit photography in general or of\nMr. Hope's mediumship in particular can be inferred from this\nexperiment, but it at least shows the helplessness of an\nordinary observer in the hands of a skilled operator, even\nwhen he knows that that operator alone is to be the sole\nagent unaided by spirit accomplices, and consequently the\nvaluelessness of the majority of the reports of successes\nobtained in what appear to be test conditions. I have in\nthe above notes given sufficient of the details to show that\nto the best of Mr. Douglas's belief, all the operations in the\ndark room were performed by himself, and it is certain that\nif the operator had been, not Mr. Marriott, but Mr. Hope,\nthe results would by many have been claimed as positive\nproof of spirit agency. It is remarkable that certain corre-\nspondents in the spiritualist press have actually claimed that\nMr. Marriott's success justifies their confidence in Mr. Hope.\nThus Mr. Wake Cook's faith in spirit photography is\n\"\nstreng-\nthened\n\"\nbecause Mr. Hope's extras grow out of a mystic\ncloud while Mr. Marriott's are reproductions of drawings or\npictures. Mr. Marriott, however, can produce just as beautiful\nmystic clouds as Mr. Hope, as I have seen in others of his\nphotographs. The particular photograph published in the\nSunday Express which he set out to imitate on this occasion\nhad no mystic cloud. Would Mr. Wake Cook therefore say it\nwas fraudulent ? Further, what about Mrs. Dean's extras ?\nThey are just as clearly reproductions of pictures as Mr.\nMarriott's, but I have not heard it suggested that they are less\ngenuine than Mr. Hope's on that account. Again, Mr. M'Kenzie\nwrites that the experiment went merely to prove the\n\"\npoverty\n\fFEB., 1922.\nExperiment in Faking\n\"\nSpirit\n\"\nPhotograph*. 223\nof the claim made by Mr. Marriott,\" and this on the ground\nthat Mr. M'Kenzie found out how he did his trick. Now, by\n.Mi. Marriott's courtesy, I have been enlightened as to a good\nmany of his methods, and although he will probably not expect\nme to attach much more credence to his statements than is due\nto other conjurors when, on the stage, they show the audience\n*\nhow they did it,' I think I can fairly confidently say that\nMr. M'Kenzie's explanation is entirely wrong, and that a\nsubstitution of slides was quite unnecessary and did not in\nfact take place. Finally, even Light itself, in an editorial\nparagraph, suggests that anyone who can suppose that what\nis done with so much elaboration by a highly trained conjuror\ncan be done by Mr. Hope and his\n\"\nequally simple and\nunskilled compeers\n\"\nmust be a very credulous person. This\nis not much of a tribute to Mr. Hope, after his many years'\nexperience of specialising in one branch of activity, and he\nmight reasonably say\n\"\nSave me from my friends.\" In any\ncase, is this not merely begging the whole question ?\nWhy\nassume that Mr. Hope, merely because he is Mr. Hope, should\nnecessarily be unskilled ? I can positively assert that Mr.\nMarriott's methods require no special manual dexterity ;\na\nlittle foresight, some luck and more bluff and you get an\nextra.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. A NOTE ON THE \"CASE OF ABRAHAM FLORENTINE.\" 1\n(1) To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, Further discrepancies in this case come to light,\nwhich might well have been noticed by Mr. Myers himself.\n1. In Mrs. Speer's account of these sittings (Proc. S.P.R.,\nVol. XL, p. 53) G (Grocyn) informed the sitters that the spirit\nhad been chosen by Imperator to give them another proof of\nidentity, and that he had been a spiritualist in earth-life. On\np. 85, an interview with the widow is recorded, from which it\nis clear that she at least was not a spiritualist, as the article\na\nCp. JournalS.P.R., November, 1921, p. 148.\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.\nfrom the Banner of Light\n\"\nevidently puzzled, though it interested\nher.\"\n2. Stainton Moses' own account of this sitting (I.e. p. 82) states\nthat he was in deep trance himself, but that the heavy loo\ntable was tilted with violence and the whole message was given\nby tilts. (There is no date given to this letter to the Spiritua-\nlist, but it is after Dec. 11, 1874). Mrs. Speer's own account\n(p. 53), apparently extracted from her diary, states omy that\nthe table was raised several times, and a spirit rapped on it\nwith much energy.\nThere seems to have been some \"writing up\" of the case, both\nhere, where raps become tilts, and in U.S.A., where three months*\nservice in 1814 entitle a man to be called in 1874\n\"\na veteran\nof the war of 1812.\"\nMost persons who have been present at a seance where a table\nhas been violently tilted will be satisfied that the movements of\nthe table were not controlled by the medium or sitters. It is\ntherefore immaterial, to speculate whether Mr. Moses or Mr. or\nMrs. Speer could have seen an American newspaper containing\nthe obituary notice of Abraham Florentine.\nBut the statements now re-examined do suggest that the\nobituary notice was the source of the information given, and that,,\nin short, a deliberate piece of personation was effected by the\nImperator group.\nNor was the subject to be impersonated unwisely chosen, as\nit has taken nearly fifty years to invalidate what was considered\n\"\nthe best evidence ever produced for Spirit Identity\n\"\n(p. 82).\nLAWRENCE J. JONES.\n(2) To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, In the November issue of the Journal attention i&\ndrawn to the fact that particulars of the death of Abraham\nFlorentine who purported to communicate through the Rev. Stainton\nMoses on or before September 1st, 1874 had appeared in two\nAmerican daily newspapers on August 5th and 6th of the same year.\nFrom this the deduction is drawn that these obituary notices\nmay have been seen by Mr. Moses and that the ostensible com-\nmunication may, therefore, be only a case of cryptomnesia.\n\fFKH., 1922. Note on \"\nThe Case of Abraham Florentine.\" '2'2~>\n. _\nThis assumption is hardly justifiable. In 1874 no American daily\npapers circulated in this country^ They would have been found\nonly in newspaper offices as\n\"\nexchanges\n\"\nor in the houses of\nthe few Americans then resident in England.\nMr. Moses could have had no access to these ;\nso the assump-\nion that he could have ever seen the American obituary notices\nmay be dismissed as too wildly improbable for serious notice.\nIf it could be found that these notices were repeated or ab-\nstracted in any British newspaper before September 1st, 1874, the\ncase would be altogether different. GEORGE E. WRIGHT.\n(Editorial Note. It appears to us that in his letter, printed\nabove, Mr. Wright rather underestimates the possibility that a\ncopy of one of the American papers in which the obituary notices\nof Abraham Florentine appeared, may have fallen under Stainton\nMoses' eye. Admittedly it was not very probable that an\nEnglishman at that date should have seen an American paper,,\nbut in weighing evidence of this kind we must surely look beyond\nwhat is\nlikely to have happened and consider what may have\nhappened. But the point to which we wished to call attention\nin our original note was the strong reason we have for thinking\nthat the source of the knowledge shown at the sitting was one\nof the obituary notices rather than the dead man himself. That\nevidence has nothing to do with the question of whether Stainton\nMoses himself had seen the notice.\nIf Sir Lawrence Jones is right in thinking that the movements\nof the table were beyond anything that those present at the\nsitting could themselves have produced, then evidently we must\nlook further afield. But before we can be certain of such a\npoint, do we not need a more accurate and detailed report of\nwhat occurred at the sitting than is available in this instance ?\nWe have had a letter from an American correspondent, Judge\nLloyd, which has some bearing on this point. He observes that\n\"\nthe comment by Moses quoted at the foot of page 151 (of the\nS.P.R. Jour.) strongly suggests that it was Moses' own subliminal\nmind that had observed the obituary notices. The note book\ngives first the information of name, in the American War, died\nAugust 5, 1874, aged 83 years, 1 month, 17 days, at Brooklyn.\nThen in comment Moses guesses that life had become a burden\nthrough a painful illness. It would therefore appear that the\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.\nknowledge of the painful illness did not come from the\n'\nspirit,'\nbut was Moses' own thought. Corresponding as it does with\nthe obituary notice, and taken in conjunction with the purported\n'\nspirit\n'\ncommunication, it clearly points to Moses' own mind\nhaving seen or observed the printed notice.\"\nII. A SUGGESTED METHOD FOR TELEPATHIC EXPERI-\nMENTS.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, Members of the Society may recollect that I recently\nsuggested a method of research into mediumistic and other trance\nstates by means of the psycho-galvanic reflex.\nOwing to the difficulty of securing the services of a suitable\nsubject for these experiments it has not yet been possible to put\nthis suggestion to the test. But it has occurred to me that it\nmight be practicable to employ a similar method for the investiga-\ntion of telepathy in a manner which, if the experiments were\nsuccessful, would possess the same advantages as I ventured to\nclaim for the former technique.\nThere seems to be some reason for thinking that \"ideas'*\naccompanied by relatively intense emotional feeling-tone are\nmore likely to be transmitted and perceived telepathically than\nare \"\nindifferent\n\"\nideas. This being so, it seems not unreasonable\nto suppose that the emotional state or change itself might be\nequally or even more easily transmissible.\nNow the psycho-galvanic reflex is by far the most delicate\nand reliable indicator of emotional change at present known ;\nin\nfact, it is not too much to say that it is the only practicable\nmethod for quantitative work. Furthermore, it has been found\nto indicate with equal success the emotional changes induced\nby any kind of stimulus, whether the words of an association-\ntest or such physical excitations as sudden noises, pricks, pinches,\nburns, smells and the like.\nI suggest, therefore, that two suitable subjects\n\"\nagent\n\"\nand\n\"percipient\" -be placed in adjacent rooms and connected to two\nindependent installations for observing the psycho-galvanic reflex.\nA succession of asserted stimuli would be applied to the \"\nagent\n\"\nand his reflexes recorded. The \"percipient\" would be kept, as\n\fFEB., 1922. A Suggested Method for Telepathic Experiments. 227\nfar as possible, totally quiescent and a similar and synchronised\nrecord of his reactions would be made.\nIf there were any considerable degree of correlation between\nthe two records this would constitute evidence of telepathy of\na, most positive and unambiguous kind.\nI am encouraged to hope that such an experiment would yield\nvaluable results by the fact that previous attempts at the\n'\ntrans-\n;> ivnce of sensations\n'\nseem to have been fairly successful on the\nwhole : and if the sensations can be transferred it seems impossible\nto doubt that the concomitant emotional change would be capable\nof detection.\nIn particular, I notice that in the very interesting\n\"\nCase\n\"\nreported in the Society's Journal for December 1921, it is stated\nthat [Mr. Brook] was able to transfer sensations to [Mrs. Jackson]\nwith considerable success. Even if\nregular experimental work\nis not possible in that particular case it should not be difficult\nto find suitable subjects, for it is quite possible that some effect\ncould be obtained with people who are not known to possess\nany special\n\"\npsychic\n\"\ngifts.\nThe only serious difficulty is the question of apparatus. Two\nWheatstone's bridges and two good galvanometers (preferably\nreflecting, with lamps, scales, etc.) would be required, together\nwith a few secondary cells. It might be possible to borrow\nthem ;\nif not I estimate that the cheapest installation would\ncost about 50. Photographic recording is desirable though not\nessential, but would considerably increase the expense.\nBut I think it possible that Members of the Society would\nbe willing to make a special effort to finance so promising and\nfundamentally important an experiment if\nthey were invited\nto do so.\nW.

Mitchell (M.D. Edinburgh) as President of the\nSociety for the current year.\nDr. Mitchell has been closely connected with the modern\nrevival of psycho-therapeutics in England from the beginning\nin 1906-1907, when \"\nA society for the Study of Suggestive\nTherapeutics\n\"\n(afterwards the Psycho-Medical Society); was\nfounded. Of this Society Dr. Mitchell was President in 1911.\nHe also became at the same time Hon. Secretary of the\nMedical Section of the Society for Psychical Research. After\nthe war when the Medical Section of the British Psychological\nSociety, and the British Psycho-Analytical Society were founded,\nthe Psycho-Medical Society and the Medical Branch of the\nS.P.R. ceased to exist.\nDr. Mitchell is a Member of the Council of the British\nPsychological Society, and the Editor of The British Journal of\nPsychology (Medical Section). He is an Associate Member of\nthe British Psycho-Analytical Society.\nDr. Mitchell has done much valuable work in psychical\nresearch. He has been a Member of the Council sine 3 1909,\nand is the author of numerous articles in Proceedings. He has\nalso published quite recently a book entitled The Psychology\nof Medicine.\nTHE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.\nIN a review of the work of the Society during 1921 no single\npiece of investigation stands out, as did the enquiry into\nA\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922.\nthe phenomena of Eva C. during the early summer of 1920 ;\nbut there has been considerable activity in other directions.\nArising out of the Reports printed in the Proceedings and\nJournal on Book-tests and Newspaper-tests obtained through\nthe mediumship of Mrs. Osborne Leonard, the suggestion has\nbeen put forward in more than one quarter that the question\nof what part chance coincidence could be supposed to play in\nthe observed results was deserving of careful consideration.\nWith the assistance of Colonel C. E. Baddeley, C.M.G., C.B.,\nand the co-operation of some others of our members, an\nenquiry into this point has been recently carried out, a report\nupon which will, it is hoped, be shortly published in Proceedings.\nThe results appear to show that only in a very small per-\ncentage of cases does chance yield any considerable degree\nof success.\nSome experiments are at present in progress for the purpose\nof testing the possibility of detecting supernormally the contents\nof closed envelopes. The percipient believes himself to have\nsome gift of\n'\nthis kind and on occasion obtains results which\nseem considerably better than can be attributable to chance,\nbut the complete failures of other days make the total figures\nrather disappointing.\nIn this connexion attention may be drawn to the com-\nparatively large amount of apparent clairvoyance of which\nthe Society has received evidence recently. Beginning with\nMrs. Osborne Leonard's\n\"\nBook-tests\n\"\nin 1917-1919 (reported\nin the Proceedings, Vol. XXXI.), which have more or less\ncontinued since, we have the further development of\n\"\nNews-\npaper-tests\n\"\nreceived through her by Mr. Drayton Thomas,\nof which an account was printed in the Journal for May.\nThen there are Mr.\n\"\nBrook's\n\"\nbook-test experiments with\nhis sister-in-law described in the December Journal, and\nthe experiments reported by Mr. Kimber in the Journal for\nJanuary, 1922. This little accumulation of cases would be\nless noticeable were it not that cases of clairvoyance super-\nnormal perception of things not, so far as appears, in the mind\nof any human being had previously been rare among the cases\nabout which we have received contemporary information.\nSimilar groups of successful experiments in various departments\nhave occurred before ;\nsuccess in any branch of psychical re-\n\fMAI:., 102-2. Annual Report of the Council. 231\nsearch tending apparently to produce further success, probably\nbecause the interest aroused leads others to try for the phenomena\nto which attention is at the moment directed. Thus in the early\ndays of the Society we received many very interesting accounts\nof telepathic experiments, transference of ideas, diagrams, etc.\nThe importance of experiments of this kind has not diminished,\nbut apparently the interest felt in them by our members has,\nand we hear of but few. Again, when cross-correspondences\nwere first discussed in our Proceedings, others followed, and\nautomatists who had not been in touch with us before pro-\nduced them. Or, to go back to days before the Society was\nfounded, phenomena, possibly telepathic and apparently clair-\nvoyant, in connexion with mesmerism were observed in the\nearlier part of the last century much more frequently than\nthey are now, probably because they were more sought after\nand expected. Physicians practising hypnotism are now\nmore exclusively intent on its therapeutic uses, and lay\npersons are more aware of its possible abuses and less in-\nclined to experiment with it. As an experimental method\nfor psychical research hypnotism has thus suffered some-\nwhat through its recognition by orthodox science. Again,\nin the middle of last century table-turning and rapping\nwere in great vogue stimulated, in the first instance, [by\nthe\nRochester knockings, which may or may not themselves have\nbeen genuine phenomena. Among the extraordinary things\nsaid to have occurred in private circles at that time, very\nfew have been recorded in a way to be of any scientific use ;\nbut some may have been genuine and not attributable to\nunconscious muscular action, and, if so, it is probable that\nexperiments attempted on the same scale now and with the\nsame interest and expectation of success would again yield a\ncrop of interesting phenomena. This all points to the im-\nportant work our members might do. If they all experimented\nin whatever department of our work specially interested them,\na certain number would very likely find they had super-\nnormal faculty of one sort or another, and psychical research\nwould be proportionately advanced.\nThe Society is sometimes accused of neglecting its oppor-\ntunities for investigating the phenomena of well-known mediums,\nand we therefore take this occasion to re-affirm that this\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. -MAR., 1922.\napparent neglect is not due to any indifference on the part\nof the Council, but to the unwillingness of some mediums to\nsubmit to such test-conditions as we consider absolutely\nnecessary for a scientific enquiry. A few months ago, for\nexample, it was suggested through a private source that the\nSociety should undertake an investigation of the phenomena\nsaid to occur in the presence of Miss Bessinet. The officers of\nthe Society expressed willingness to undertake the task and\nsuggested the appointment of a committee of investigation, but\nthe scheme fell through owing to the refusal of the medium to\nsubmit to any test-conditions. Her refusal was said to be in\npart due to an experience she had recently had when giving\na test-sitting elsewhere ; but, however that may be, the Council\ncannot be held to blame in the matter.\nThat remarkable phenomena can be obtained under very\nstringent conditions is proved by the case of Eva C. The\nnature of the phenomena observed in the presence of this\nmedium may still be an open question, but at least she cannot\nbe accused of refusing to lend herself to scientific enquiry ;\nand if other mediums would follow her example, the progress\nof psychical research might be materially assisted.\nMinor experiments carried out during the past year include\nsome in\n\"\npsychometry.\" The results obtained so far, though\nnot without interest, are not sufficiently definite to warrant\npublication.\nMr. Gardner Murphy, Lecturer on Psychology at Columbia\nUniversity, New York, and a member of our Society, has\nbegun a series of long-distance thought-transference experi-\nments between agents and percipients in different parts of the\nworld, and some members of the Society are taking part in\nthese experiments.\nIt was with much interest that we learnt in the summer\nthat our President during 1920 and 1921, Dr. M'Dougall (who\nis now a Professor at Harvard University, U.S.A.), had been\nelected to the Presidency of the American Society for Psychical\nResearch and had accepted the office.\nThe first International Congress for Psychical Research was\nheld at Copenhagen during the last days of August, 1921,\nunder the auspices of the Danish Society for Psychical Research.\nMrs. W. H. Salter attended the Congress as the official repre-\n\f[AH., 1922. Annual Report of the Council. 233\nsentative of our Society, and her report on the Congress was\nprinted in the Journal for December. Several other members\nof the Society were present, some of whom read papers.\nAs regards membership the Society still continues to suffer\nfrom the general necessity for retrenchment resulting from high\nprices and the diminished value of money. In numbers the\nSociety has slightly declined during the past year, but its\nincome from subscriptions has remained almost exactly the\nsame. This is due to the fact that whereas many of those\nwho have resigned were Associates, paying only one guinea a\nyear, no new Associates have been admitted, and only\nMembers, who pay two guineas, have been elected. In only\ntwo cases has any dissatisfaction with the Society's work been\nexpressed by those who have resigned. In one case the\ndissatisfaction appears to be of a vague and general character,\nand in the other an Associate gives as her reasons for resigning,\nfirst, that the Society does not aid\n\"\nthe individual Member\nor Associate to educate himself in matters psychical,\" and,\nsecondly, that she grudges the time taken in attending meetings\n\"\nto hear a read address.\" This lady must apparently have\njoined the Society under a misapprehension as to its objects,\nwhich have never included the training of its members in\nmatters psychical. Its business, like that of other scientific\nsocieties, is the investigation of phenomena of a certain type,\nthe publication of results, and the provision of facilities for\nstudying the literature of the subject. Its officers are, however,\nalways ready, if asked, to give such advice and guidance\nas they can to members engaging in investigations on their\nown account. A considerable number of persons, in tendering\ntheir resignation, have expressly stated that they acted from\nmotives of economy and regretted the necessity ;\nin some\ninstances they have expressed a hope of rejoining later.\nThe total number of resignations received during the past\nyear has been 32 Members and 42 Associates ;\nthe names of\n10 Members and 13 Associates have been removed from the\nlists for non-payment of subscriptions ;\nand 9 Members and\n17 Associates have died. The loss from death has, for the\npast few years, been considerably above the previous yearly\naverage.\nEighty-eight new Members (including two Corresponding\nA2\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922.\nMembers, one of whom was formerly an Associate), and two\nHonorary Associates (one of whom was formerly an Associate)\nhave been elected, and ten Associates have become Members.\nThe total membership of the Society now stands at 1266, of\nwhom 510 are Members and 756 are Associates.\nAmong the losses by death we must specially mention\nProfessor Beaunis of Nancy at the age of 94. He was the\nlast survivor of the original Nancy school of hypnotism which\nplayed so important a part in the development of the treat-\nment of disease by suggestion, and he had been a corre-\nsponding Member of our Society since 1886. The Members of\nthe Nancy group best known in England were probably Pro-\nfessor Bernheim and Dr. Liebeault, and they too and also\nProfessor Liegeois were corresponding Members of our Society.\nProfessor Bernheim lived till 1919, and his death should have\nbeen recorded in a previous report by the Council.\nAn increased use has been made of the Library during the\nyear. In part this is doubtless due to the fact that all persons\nnow admitted to the Society are Members and as such have\nthe right to borrow books. But in part it may be attributed\nto a widespread interest in psychical research and a wish to\nbecome acquainted with recent developments of the subject.\nFrom the financial point of view the past year has not been\nwithout its difficulties. The Society's income from all sources\nwas slightly larger in 1921 than in 1920. Among the causes\nof increase may be mentioned the receipt of royalties on the\nsale of the abridged edition of Phantasms of the Living, and the\nincreased sale of the Society's publications in the United\nStates by the F.

A decrease in cost has however recently taken\nplace, and there is good reason to anticipate further decreases\nthe near future.\nMrs. Salter has resigned her position as Research Officer,\nand while retaining the Editorship of the Proceedings and\nJournal has generously refused to take any salary, thus\nmaterially helping to reduce the financial stress arising from\nthe high cost of printing. She being now an honorary officer of\nthe Society, the Council have co-opted her as a member of their\nbody.\nIt is clear that, unless the Society's income can be substantially\nincreased, lack of funds will seriously limit the research work\nwhich it can undertake. In spite of these difficulties, how-\never, the Society has decided for the present, at any rate,\nto increase its financial liabilities in one respect. Since Miss\nAlice Johnson's resignation in 1916 the Society has had no\npaid Research Officer, and, although much useful unpaid work\nhas been done, it has been felt recently that the Society's\nregular staff was not sufficiently large to cope with all the\nvarious opportunities which arise for experimental work and\nfor enquiry into spontaneous phenomena. The Council have\ndecided to appoint a Research Officer, having been partly\ninfluenced in this decision by the circumstance of a very\nsuitable candidate presenting himself in the person of Mr.\nE. J. Dingwall. Mr. Dingwall, who has a wide knowledge\nof the various branches of psychical research, proved himself a\nvery good observer when he took part in the recent enquiry\ninto the phenomena of Eva C. During the past year he has\nbeen in America as Director of the Department of Physical\nPhenomena in the American Society for Psychical Research,\nin which capacity we understand he has carried out his duties\nvery efficiently. For financial reasons his appointment, which\nis for part time only, has been made provisionally for one\nyear.\nDr. C. Lloyd Tuckey is among those who retire from mem-\nbership of the Council this year in rotation, and as he has\nfor some time past been unable to attend meetings on account\nof ill-health, he has decided not to stand for re-election.

BADDELEY, C.M.G., C.B.\nTHE perusal of (Una) Lady Troubridge's most interesting and\nsuggestive paper made me wonder whether she has read Henry\n1\nProc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIL, p. 344 ff.\n\f[AR., 1922. So-called Afediumistic Trance. 239\n>lt's discussion on the nature of trance personalities, contained\nChapter L., Vol. II., of his book, On the Cosmic Relations,\nige 839 et seq.\nIt is undoubtedly true that some\n\"\ntrance controls\n\"\nexhibit in\nstriking degree the characteristics of certain\n\"\nsecondary per-\nmalities\n\"\nwho have been studied, but it may be argued that\nte resemblance is merely fortuitous. Lady Troubridge cites the\npoints of resemblance between\n\"\nFeda,\"\n\"\nMargaret,\" and\n\"\nNellie,\"\nMrs. Thompson's child control, and Sally Beauchamp No. II., but\nthere are no points of resemblance in this latter personality to\nthe characteristics displayed by other trance controls, such as\n\"\nDr. Phinuit,\"\n\"\nImperator,\"\n\"\nRector,\" or\n\"\nMr. D ,\" another\nof Mrs. Thompson's controls. The pranks played by Feda on her\nmedium, Mrs. Leonard, might, on the assumption that Feda is a\nseparate entity, quite naturally be explained by her rather childish,\nmischievous, and not very highly developed character ; Sally\nBeauchamp No. II. was inspired by quite a different motive in\nthe pranks she played upon Sally Beauchamp No. I. : it was\nresentment against the latter for occupying the human organism\nwhich she considered to be her property, and the acts were\ngenerally malicious and not merely mischievous.\nIn view of Feda's claim to have been an Indian girl it is\ncurious to note that she seems to exhibit many of the char-\nacteristics of a spoilt uneducated young Hindu woman, and many\nof the things done by her to Mrs. Leonard, as related by Lady\nTroubridge, are just the sort of uncouth and unconventional\nacts that might be perpetrated by a young Hindu woman. Some\nof Feda's remarks are put in terms that are strongly reminiscent\nof\n\"\nEnglish, as she is spoke\n\"\nby Indians with an imperfect\nknowledge of English. For instance, Feda was once asked whether\nthe communicator liked the music that was played in the house\nof the sitters. She replied : \"He says he likes the thing that is\nplayed outside better than the\n'\nthing what you tap it's teeth.'\n\"\nThat is purely Hindu-English.\nIt may be explained that the musical instruments referred to\nwere respectively a gramophone and a piano !\nIt would be interesting to know whether her Indian sitters\nconsider that Feda has at all made good her claim to have been\na native of India, but I understand that she is so proud of\nhaving become by marriage a native of Scotland that she will\nnot talk much about India !\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1022.\nIn comparing Feda with Sally Beauchamp No. II., Lady Trou-\nbridge lays stress on Feda's want of sympathy and instances her\ncallousness over the idea of Miss R. H. passing over and com-\nmunicating. The attitude of mind would be callousness in a\nhuman being, even in the guise of a secondary personality, but\nI fail to see that it betrays callousness if Feda is a separate\ndiscarnate entity. In such case she might be expected to take\nquite a different view of the parting by death to that taken by\nhuman beings in the flesh. This would also explain a certain\nwant of sympathy with human bereavement which Lady Trou-\nbridge has noticed, which is perfectly natural if Feda's different\nstandpoint is taken into consideration, combined with the certain\nchildishness of character she displays.\nIn spite of this, 'Feda\" presents a very attractive and even\nlovable personality, and one so marked that I defy anyone who\nhas got to know her well to treat her otherwise than as a distinct\nperson.\nThe fundamental points of difference between\n\"\ntrance controls\n\"\nand\n\"\nsecondary personalities\n\"\nare (1) that the latter have never\nshown any evidence of being able to acquire, information\n\"\nsuper-\nnormally,\" and (2) that they claim to be the rightful\n\"\nowners\n\"\nof the human organism through whom they manifest. Sally\nBeauchamp No. II. considered that she was the true Sally Beau-\nchamp and that the normal Sally Beauchamp was an interloper.\nI have never heard of such a claim being put forward by a\ntrance control ; they may take pleasure in manifesting through\ntheir\n\"\nmedium,\" but\n\"\nDr. Phinuit\n\"\ndid not claim that he was\nthe rightful Mrs. Piper, or\n\"\nNellie\n\"\nthat she was the real Mrs.\nThompson, nor does\n\"\nFeda\n\"\nclaim that she ought to occupy\nMrs. Leonard's organism permanently. They each of them have\na self-imposed\n\"\nmission,\" which is to bring evidence for survival,\nand to form a channel of communication between those who have\ndeparted this life and those still on earth. Feda takes her mission\nvery seriously, and is insistent on accuracy and good evidence, as\nbefits an\n\"\nhonourable (sic) member of the Psychical Society,\"\nwhich she considers herself to be. At the same time she obviously\nenjoys her work, and the faculty of talking through her medium,\nfor as she once said to a sitter :\n' '\nFeda loves chattering, Feda\nwould like to have six mediums !\n\"\nLady Troubridge lays little stress on the nature of the informa-\ntion given by Feda and by other trance controls, and yet to\n\fMAR., 1922. So-called Mediumistic Trance. 241\nomit this point is like leaving out Hamlet in Shakespeare's play\nHamlet.\nApart from the fact that these controls occupy themselves\nalmost exclusively with the affairs of deceased persons, about\nwhom secondary personalities show no concern or interest, no one\nwith any considerable experience of seances can deny that, what-\never the source of the information, it is acquired\n\"\nsupernormally\n\"\n;\nwe may adopt all sorts of theories, such as telepathy, thought-\nreading, exteriorisation of the medium's subconscious, etc., but the\nfact remains that the medium does not acquire the knowledge\nthrough the ordinary sense channels. But secondary personalities\ndo not show any faculty of acquiring information supernormally.\nFinally, there is the question of\n\"\nsex\n\"\n: Mrs. Piper's controls\nwere\n\"\nDr. Phinuit,\"\n\"\nImperator,\" and\n\"\nRector\n\"\n;\nMrs. Thomp-\nson had one man control,\n\"\nMr. D-\n\"\n;\nin other words, the\nsex of a trance control is not necessarily that of the control's\nmedium, whereas I have never heard of the case of an unquestion-\nable secondary personality who professed to be of different sex\nfrom that of the primary personality. Sally Beauchamp No. I.\nbecomes Sally Beauchamp No. II., she does not become\n\"\nJohnny\n\"\nBeauchamp.\n1\nUndoubtedly, the reluctance to accept these trance controls at\ntheir\n\"\nface value\n\"\nis partly due to the dislike of admitting a\nsuper\n\"\nnatural\n\"\nexplanation so long as a\n\"\nnatural\n\"\nexplanation\nis possible, but it is also partly due to their\n\"\nqueerness.\" What\nis one to make of these controls :\nFeda, Nellie, Sunshine, Belle,\nPansy, Topsy, or even of the great\n\"\nImperator\n\"\nhimself ? Dr.\nPhinuit has always seemed to me so much more natural, in spite\nof the fact that his identity was never satisfactorily established.\nIndeed I thought he might have excellent reasons for not wishing\nhis identity to be revealed.\nAnyway, I think I have shown that it is at least quite as\ndifficult to explain away trance controls by saying that they are\nsecondary personalities as it is to accept them as real and\nseparate discarnate intelligences, and for the moment we have to\nleave it at that !\nIt is interesting to compare the methods by which Feda osten-\n1\nThere is a possible exception in the case of William Sharp and \"\nFiona\nMacLeod,\" but a careful study of the biography of William Sharp strongly\ninclines me to the belief that the case is of the\n\"\ncontrol\n\"\ntype rather\nthan of the true secondary personality type.\n\f242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1022.\nsibly gets her information with the methods of a good clairvoyant\nmedium, such as, say, Mrs. Elliott (Violet Ortner).\nThe latter\n\"\nsees\n\"\npersons, who appear, more or less, solid and\nconcrete, and for a greater or less duration of time. They will\noften reappear, wearing some special article of dress or carry-\ning some object, such^\nas a ring, or flowers, to which atten-\ntion may be drawn. Pictures will be seen and described by\nthe medium, shown with the object of illustrating an event\nor a name, or with some symbolic meaning. She will also\noccasionally see a sentence or a word, as if written up, and will\ndecipher it.\nPresumably these visions are internal, and are projected ex-\nternally by the medium's mind. The effect is as if some one\nwere visualising very vividly and were projecting the visualisation\ntelepathically into the medium's brain.\nShe will also get the impression of\n\"\nhearing\/' as if words had\nactually been spoken, although the apparent sound is evident to\nthe medium only. Now all these methods are used by Feda,\nand it certainly tends to support the hypothesis that Feda is a\nsecondary personality of Mrs. Leonard, receptive to impressions\njust as Mrs. Elliott is in her normal personality. Almost the only\ndifference is that one can talk freely to Feda and ask questions,\nwhereas to do this in the case of a clairvoyant medium is to risk\na serious interruption in the flow of communication.\nAt the same time it is just possible to imagine Feda as the\nrecurring possession by a separate entity of Mrs. Leonard, the\nlatter's own personality being temporarily excluded from the use\nof her brain and organism, and the possessing entity receiving\nand giving information in exactly the same way as does the\npersonality of the clairvoyant medium.\nWith regard to the source of the\n\"\ncommunications,\" the repre-\nsentations given, and the events related, are so unexpected that\none feels obliged to rule out telepathy from the conscious mind\nof the sitter, especially as so much that is actively in the thoughts\nof the sitter is never given.\nPure mind-reading by the medium of the contents of the\nsubconscious mind of the sitter is met by the difficulty of account-\ning for the selective agency.\nTo account for the phenomenon by any process of thought-\nreading, one is obliged to enlist the active co-operation of the\nsubconscious mind of the sitter, and to conceive that the whole\n\fMAR., 1922. So-called Mediumistic Trance. 243\nimpersonation is engineered by this subconscious mind, and\nconveyed telepathically to the medium.\nI do not think that this point has been taken sufficiently into\naccount, or rather, I think that there has been confusion of\nthought between telepathy from the mind of the sitter to that\nof the medium, and the reading of the mind of the sitter by\nthe medium.\nSo long as the latter theory was restricted to the reading of\nthe sitter's conscious thoughts, it might be argued that the medium\nfound the conception of a certain personality, with appropriate\nincidents and memories, ready present to hand, but the case\nis different when the hypothesis is used to explain the extraction\nof relevant incidents and memories from among the mass of\nmemories in the subconscious mind of the sitter, and still more\nso from among the memories in the subconscious mind of a third\nparty or parties. Especially in the case of an anonymous sitter,\nthe medium cannot possibly have the equipment, so to speak,\nto enable him to select.\nIt appears to me neither scientific nor legitimate to adopt\ndifferent hypotheses of mind communication to explain different\nportions of a\n\"\nsitting,\" just as may be convenient ;\nto be valid\na hypothesis must cover all the facts.\nThe only hypothesis that seems to cover all the facts is the\nassumption that it is the subconscious mind of the sitter that\ndoes the whole thing ;\non this assumption the subconscious mind\nof the sitter creates the communicating personality with its\ncharacteristics and idiosyncrasies ;\nits dialogue, with appropriate\nexpressions and modes of thought ; groups around it relevant\nincidents and memories ;\nsearches out others from among the\nmass of memories in the subconscious minds of third parties ;\nand even exercises a mysterious power of\n\"\nlucidity\n\"\nin arranging\nsuch tests as\n\"\nbook tests,\" and in relating incidents not known\nto any one person (such as the\n\"\nCharlie L.\" test of Mr. Irving).\nThe whole of this information would then be conveyed in some\ntelepathic manner to the medium, who thus must be looked upon\nmerely as the vehicle through which it is retransmitted back to\nthe astonished conscious mind of the sitter. The only alternative\nto the above theory that to my mind in any way covers all the\nfacts is the\n\"\nspiritistic\n\"\nhypothesis.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922-\nA CASE IN WHICH A FACT, APPARENTLY KNOWN\nTO A DEAD MAN ONLY, WAS COMMUNICATED IN\nA VISION.\n(We give below some extracts (translated] from, the report of an\ninteresting case which appeared in the Revue Spirite for\nApril 1921. The original report ivas by Monsieur Camille\nFlammarion, and we have to thank the editor of the Revue\nSpirite for permission to reprint it\nhere.)\nCASES in which the dead have manifested themselves in such\na way as to compel our attention by reason of the certain\nauthenticity of the manifestations are extremely rare. Gener-\nally speaking, the possibility of some mental action on the\npart of living persons can only be eliminated with great\ndifficulty, and our efforts to reach the truth do not lead to\nany results comparable for precision to the calculation of\nmathematical equations, which proceeds by the sure elimination\nof erroneous numbers and leaves upon the board a figure\nwhich is absolutely definite.\nIn the remarkable case with which we are here concerned,\nwe are really unable to find any other explanation than a\nrecognition of personal action on the part of the dead man, and\nI thank the observer for having kindly allowed me to lay\nbefore all those who desire to solve the greatest of all problems\nthe eloquent report with which she has furnished me.\nThe following, then, was the letter addressed to me from\nParis, under the date of the 7th of last February :\nTo add one more piece of evidence to the important enquiry\nwhich you are carrying out, allow me to give you an account of\nthe two following events of my own experience :\n(The writer then describes how on September 2, 1916, between 10\nand 11 a.m., whilst in her room dressing, she was suddenly seized\nwith a sensation of terrible distress accompanied by a feeling of\nsuffocation. She said to her daughter that some great disaster had\nbefallen her son, Rene. Two days later she was informed by the\nchief of his squadron that her son, a pilot in the flying corps, had\ndisappeared over the German lines near Verdun on the day and at\nthe hour of her distressing experience.)\nIt was only after the armistice that the Germans vouchsafed\nto tell us that our son had been brought down in their lines on\n\fMAH., 1922. Case. 245\nthe 2nd of September, at Dieppe, near Verdun, and that he had\nbeen buried in the military cemetery at Dieppe, grave No. 56.\nWe went to the place four times and searched again and again\nin the cemetery in which there were only two Frenchmen (all\nthe rest were Germans), but we found nothing. The cemetery\nhad been churned up by shells, and most of the crosses were\nbroken. Seeing that we could not find the remains of our dear\nson, we spoke to the officer in command of the section, whose\nduty it was to take up the bodies, and asked him to let us\nknow on what day the bodies in that cemetery were to be taken\nup. . . . This happened last spring.\nOn the 25th of May [1920], at half-past eight [p.m.], I was\nseized with a feeling of intense sadness. I was more sad than\nusual, and without reason, and in order to shake myself out of\nthis state of profound gloom, 1 went to the window, and turned\nmy gaze up the Rue Ribera, which was just over the way. There\nare some trees there, and a little blue sky. Suddenly, in a group\nof trees, \/ saw my son, Rene, appear! His beautiful face was\npale and sad ;\nhe was, as it were, in a great medallion ;\non each\nside of him were two young men, one to the right, one to the\nleft ;\nI did not know them, I had never seen them. Terrified\nby this vision I left the window, and clasped my head in my\nhands, asking myself if I were going mad. I walked about the\nroom a little in this manner, and then returned to the window 5\nthe vision was still there ! There was no doubt ;\nit was Rene.\nHis head was leaning to the left, as was a habit of his. But\nwho could the young men be ? The one on the right appeared\nto be a Russian, the one on the left a German. But then ? . . .\nMy son was not dead, he must be a prisoner somewhere. Still\noverwhelmed with fright, I again left the window, and ran to\ntell my husband, but when I got to the door of his room, I\npulled myself together and thought :\n\"\nNo. I must not tell him,\nhe would think me mad, it would grieve him too much. What\nam I to do ?\n\"\nI returned to the window ;\nthe vision was still\nthere. This time I sat down on the window sill, determined to\nstay there to the end, near him. What happened ? I came to\nmyself again. Had I been asleep ? Or had I lost consciousness ?\nI no longer saw my son. I got up with difficulty, left the window,\nand looked at the time. If was half-past ten. All this had\nlasted two hours. I went to bed, much troubled, broken with\nemotion, but I could not sleep ;\nand I dared not say anything to\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922.\nmy husband. What did the vision mean ? I constantly asked\nmyself this question.\nA few days later I told my whole experience to three of my\nfriends, who can corroborate my statement, if\nyou wish.\nThree months passed. Then, at the end of August, the officer\nin command of the section in reply to a letter from my husband,\nmore pressing than the others, told us that the cemetery at\nDieppe had been taken up, and our boy was not there ;\nthere\nwas no possible doubt about it. We were greatly distressed.\nHow were we ever to know now what had become of our poor\nboy ? For my part, I was in despair. After being for a few\ndays quite overwhelmed, I took courage again and wished to\nreturn to the cemetery at Dieppe ;\nI was absolutely set on this.\nMy husband was opposed to the suggestion, saying, very reason-\nably, that having failed to find anything when there were bodies\nthere, we had nothing whatever to hope for now. Nothing could\nconvince me, and yielding to my absolutely fixed determination,\nmy husband agreed to accompany me. We started in the first\ndays of September.\nWe went straight to the section d'Eix . . . and having obtained\nfrom the officer in command the use of a carriage and some\nmen, I asked him on what day he had taken up the cemetery.\nHe opened his register, and replied :\n\"\nThe operation lasted five\ndays (there were 110 bodies), from the 20th to the 25th of May.\"\nThe last date was precisely that of my vision ! I looked at my\nhusband, for, most fortunately, I had decided to tell him every-\nthing. This coincidence of date had a great effect upon both\nof us. ...\nWhen we reached our destination, I ordered the men to search\nin a big shell hole, thinking that the place was not likely to have\nbeen searched before. They found a pair of aviator's spectacles.\nI felt encouraged ; beyond doubt an airman had been buried\nhere. The men searched further, but found nothing, absolutely\nnothing. At last a young soldier, very intelligent, took the plan\nof the cemetery and followed it letter by letter. We came in\nthis way to an empty ditch in which we found a big piece of\nfur, which I recognised, some gloves, and some fragments of\nbraces made of violet silk. . . . Without a doubt my son had\nbeen there.\n\"\nWhere have you put him ?\n\"\nIn the German\ncemetery, under the title\n\"\nUnknown \"\nand a black cross. . . .\nImmediately I wished to go on to the other cemetery ;\nI would\n\fMAK., 1922. Case. 247\nnot have my son remain there. But the officer refused on the\nground that he had no authority to take up bodies in coffins.\nAnd then, how were we to find the one we sought ? There were\nmore than 2000 graves in this German cemetery. But I was\ndetermined. We returned to Verdun . . . and sought out the\nofficer in command of the graves' commission. After a long\ndiscussion ... he yielded, and gave us authority to make a\nsearch. Next day at 5 in the morning we were at the cemetery.\n... By 12 o'clock 20 coffins had been opened without any\nresult. The men went to dinner, and my husband and I stayed\nthere, greatly depressed ; for we were beginning to lose hope. . . .\nSuddenly, I thought of my vision, and as though a flash of light\nhad passed through my brain, I said :\n\"\nYes, we shall find him ;\nhe is between a Russian and a German. There was a Russian\nin the cemetery at Dieppe ;\nlet us look for him.\" The men\ncame back and resumed their work, whilst we ourselves looked\nfor the Russian. ... At last, at 4 o'clock, I found the Russian.\nTo his left there was an unknown soldier, and to the left of\nthe unknown a German. Beyond all -doubt the unknown is my\nson, I feel it, I am sure of it ! The men proceeded to dig. It\nwas he ! His poor skeleton was in the middle of his fur, very\nwell preserved. There were some more fragments of braces. But\nwhat I particularly recognised was his teeth. Forty-two coffins\nhad been opened ;\nthere were 110 that came from the cemetery\nat Dieppe, and altogether more than 2000 coming from different\nplaces ! Without the help of my vision, we should have had to\ngive it up.\nIs it not wonderful ?\nMy dear boy would not have me leave\nhim in that cemetery, he would not have me suffer that addition\nto my cruel grief ;\nhe came to my aid, he gave me the strength\nof will to go on to the end, to overcome all difficulties, all\nobstacles, and since then I have been calm, I feel that he lives\nand sees me. But what I find most strange of all in my vision\nis the portrait of those two young men ;\nit must have been\ntheir actual features that I saw. . . .\nMy husband and friends will certainly corroborate the scrupulous\naccuracy of this report. . . .\nA. CLARINVAL.\n(There follows a corroborative statement from Madame ClarinvaVs\nhusband, a retired army officer. He bears out Madame ClarinvaVs\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.. MAR., 1922.\nstatement in all particulars, including the fact that she had men-\ntioned her vision to him before the finding of the grave. Only the\nlast paragraphs of his report need be quoted here.)\nThe cemetery at Dieppe was taken up between the 20th and\nthe 25th of May, 1920. Now it was exactly on the 25th of May,\n1920, that my wife had that vision, and, according to the en-\nquiries we made, it was upon that very date, the 25th of May,\nthat the remains of our son were transferred from the cemetery\nat Dieppe to the German cemetery.\nI can therefore corroborate the exact correspondence of this\nevent, and will add that my wife has a clear and well-balanced\nmind, and her mental attitude is always so sane and reasonable\nthat I confess to having been strongly impressed by the account\nshe gave me of this apparition which lasted fully two hours. The\nevent is all the more noteworthy in that she is not in any way\nsubject to hallucination, and that in all her life, that is to say,\nin the course of sixty-three years, she has never had any other\nvision.\n(Monsieur Flammarion then quotes the testimony of a medical man\nto the effect that Madame Clarinval has never suffered from any\nkind of mental trouble, and corroborative statements from three friends\nof Madame Clarinval's to whom she spoke of her experience about\na week after its occurrence, that is to say, some months before her\nvisit to Verdun, and the search for her son's body. Monsieur Flam-\nmarion then proceeds to discuss the case, and we print below some\nextracts from his conclusions.}\nSuch are the irrefutable facts, established by corroborative\nstatements. The manifestation took place long after death, the\ninterval being from September 2, 1916, to May '25, 1920, that\nis to say, three years, eight months, and twenty-six days.\nWhat conclusion can we draw from this case affecting our\nown personal convictions ?\n. . . There is no doubt as to the authenticity of the vision,\nnor as to its connexion with the finding of the young airman's\nbody, and we can all realise what consolation was thus afforded\nto the sorrowing parents ;\nthe body of their beloved boy is\nnow here in this city of Paris, where they live. Nothing, or\nall but nothing, is left of the body ;\nbut this body was only\nthe garment of the soul, and they know that this soul has\nsurvived the catastrophe of death, that it has manifested\n\fMAR., 1922. Case. 249\nitself, and guided them in their vigorous and persevering\nsearch. Doubtless we are not yet entirely satisfied ;\nwe should\nlike to know more, and we ask ourselves what reason there\nwas for the symbolism of the vision, why this enigmatic\napparition between a Russian and a German ? It would seem\nas if it had been simpler for Rene Clarinval to convey to his\nmother the direct information that he had been killed on the\n2nd of September, and buried in such and such a place.\n(We might possibly imagine that Madame Clarinval's mind\nbeing constantly directed towards her son, she had been\nmomentarily endowed with the faculty of seeing at a distance,\nor rather, of apprehending what was happening, and we might\nalso suppose that this apprehension was externalised before her\neyes into a living scene this apparition of her son between a\nRussian and a German. But then why did her vision not\ncorrespond with the reality ? I have published so many\ninstances of exact visions at a distance that this interpretation\nseems very doubtful and less probable than some psychic\naction on the part of the dead.)\nWe must not, we cannot, judge from our own terrestrial\nstandpoint. The invisible world is still entirely to discover ;\nwe know neither its laws nor its conditions.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. ON \"\nTHE READING OF CLOSED BOOKS APPARENTLY\nBY CLAIRVOYANCE.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nDEAR MADAM, I am much struck with the clairvoyant case\nreported in the Journal.1\nThe case has resemblances to the\nmodern Greek writing obtained by Prof. Richet through a Madame\nX. (Proc., Vol. XIX., pp. 162-261) ;\nand Mrs. Sidgwick's questions,\nwhich are (naturally) much to the point, tend to bring this\nsimilarity out.\nThe one thing which is thoroughly excluded is chance coinci-\ndence. The thing which is not excluded, and which was held to\nbe possible in the Greek case, is purposed memorising by Mrs.\n\"Jackson\n\"\nof some accessible book and then leading up to its\nselection, the choice of the page memorised remaining with her.\n1\nJour. S.P.E., Vol. XX., p. 179 (December, 1921).\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 102!\nIt is a far-fetched and difficult hypothesis, and, under the circum-\nstances, I suppose, absurd, but no hypothesis that is not rather\ndifficult can account for the reading of a closed book.\nIt will be remembered that the same thing was done by Stainton\nMoses, who read a long extract from an out-of-the-way book in\nDr. Speer's library a book which he pretty certainly had not\nseen before. 1\nIn that case it was supposed to be done by some\ncommunicating entity with superhuman powers. In the present\ncase the reading is supposed to be done by the superhuman\nfaculty of Mrs. Jackson herself. But both hypotheses are gra-\ntuitous, and the simple fact is that we do not know how it is\ndone. The feeling of the clairvoyant that she is doing it herself\nlacks any force as evidence ;\nand the earlier phenomena, reported\nof Mrs. Jackson's powers, associate her with Home in a way\nwhich may possibly be instructive.\nDirect telepathic receptive faculty seems demonstrated by the\npain and taste experiments.\nMay I congratulate Mr.\n\"\nBrook\n\"\non his important experiences,\nand on the very appropriate time which he has chosen to narrate\nthem. I have long held that book-tests, as such, have no bearing\non human survival, indeed that they rather tend to militate\nagainst the evidence for it, inasmuch as a clairvoyant power of\nreading records complicates the issue by depriving a large number\nof statements about things known to deceased persons of evidential\nvalue. The only way in which book-tests bear upon the question\nof survival is as to the matter selected and the manner in which\nit is introduced and applied to the right people. This part of\nthe evidence remains still strong, in my judgment, quite apart\nfrom the mere power of reading. The power of reading proves\nnothing by itself, one way or the other, except that it establishes\nan unknown faculty without discriminating whether that faculty\nbelongs to an incarnate or a discarnate person.\nOLIVER LODGE.\n(We print below a reply from Mr. Brook in regard to the hypo-\nthesis put forward by Sir Oliver Lodge :)\nI am glad to have an opportunity of clearing up one point in\nthe letter from Sir Oliver Lodge which you have kindly shown\nto me.\nThe hypothesis of\n\"\npurposed memorising by Mrs. Jackson of\nsome accessible book\n\"\nis one which cannot by any stretch be\n1\nCf. Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXI., p. 106,\n\fCorrespondence.\nmade to fit in with the circumstances in which the tests took\nplace. In the cases in which I chose the book the selection was\nmade entirely at random, and there was no\n\"\nleading up\n\"\nto\nsuch selection. Further, the passage was written in such circum-\nstances as to exclude the possibility of memorising between the\ntime of my selection and the time of writing. In the case of\nFarwell on Powers, selected by Mrs. Jackson, she was in my\nchambers, where the book is kept, for only a short time, and\nduring the whole of that time I was in the room with her ;\nshe\ndid not even touch the book, but merely remarked on the title\nas curious ;\nand the writing was done partly the same evening\nat home, and partly in the tube next morning. I may add that\nMrs. Jackson has little or no power of memorising, and that her\ngeneral reading is strictly limited in range ;\nsuch works as Sidg-\nwick's Methods of Ethics lie entirely outside this range.\nThere is one further point. Mrs. Jackson's power of writing\npassages contained in a closed book may, I think, bear some\nanalogy to her power of\n\"\nseeing\n\"\nthe face of a card by looking\nonly at the back of the card. I have observed her go through\na pack in this way ;\non checking the cards afterwards with the\ndescription of them which she had written down, I have found\nthe amount of error to be about 5 per cent.\n\"\nT. BROOK.\"\nII. A NEGLECTED METHOD OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nTHE UNIVERSITY, BRISTOL.\nDEAR MADAM, It has struck me that we might with great\nadvantage supplement our other methods of research by the use\nof the dictaphone in cases of alleged\n\"\ndirect control.\" We are\ntold that in certain cases a medium will claim to be directly\ncontrolled by the spirit of a dead person, and that under these\ncircumstances she will speak in tones and with an accent which\ndistinctly recall those of the alleged communicator. (Cf. the\npaper by Miss RadclynVHall and Lady Troubridge on Mrs.\nLeonard's mediumship in S.P.R. Proceedings, Part 84.)\nIt is clearly very desirable that a permanent record should be\nmade of such voices, so that they may be studied at leisure and\nsubmitted to other friends of the deceased person beside the\nactual sitter, Otherwise it is very difficult to know what weight\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922.\nto attach to the statement that the\n\"\ndirect\n\"\nvoices resemble\nthose of the alleged communicators. Obviously the ideal case\nwould be to have records (a) of a man's voice during his lifetime,\n(6) of the voice of the medium when she claims to be controlled\nby this man, (c) of the voice of the medium when under her\nnormal control, and (d) of the voice of the medium when not\nin trance.\nIt ought not to be impossible for those who sit frequently\n(say) with Mrs. Leonard to arrange some sufch experiment with\n\"\nFeda,\" and thus at least get records of the kinds (&), (c), and\n(d). As regards (a) might it not be worth while for some of us\nto deposit with the Society dictaphone records of our ordinary\nmode of speaking, so that if\nany medium professes to be con-\ntrolled by us after our death a perfectly objective comparison of\nthe voices could be made ? This would at least supplement the\n\"\nsealed letter\n\"\ntests which past members of the Society have\nmade with such lamentably negative results.\nI do not know what conclusion if\nany about survival could be\nbased on the success of a series of such experiments. But it\nwould at least establish definitely a very interesting and possibly\nimportant fact which would be incapable of normal explanation.\nC. D.

It can be\nobtained from the Danish Society for Psychical Research,\n7 Graabrodretorv, Copenhagen.\nIn the brief report of the Congress printed in the Journal\nfor last November, we referred to the Danish Society as newly\nconstituted.

He addressed the\nmeeting thus :\nThis work is an exposition of certain experiences and observa-\ntions which I have tried to classify methodically. It seemed to\nme that the unregulated and strange phenomena observed by\nhonest and careful investigators, some of them well-known men,\nsuch as Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Zollner, and\nWilliam James, ought to be subjected to a thorough enquiry, and\nnot received with sarcasm or disdainful silence.\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1922.\nThe word metapsychic, which I created to designate this science\nof hidden things, a word which now seems to be generally accepted,\nindicates that these phenomena are of a psychological order, but\nthey extend beyond ordinary, classical psychology and immensely\nincrease the field of human intelligence.\n. . .\nStrange as the facts which I describe may seem to be,\nthey do not contradict any accepted scientific truths. They are\nnew ; they are unusual ; they are difficult to classify ;\nbut they\ndo not demolish anything of what has been so laboriously built\nup in our classic edifice. If people dispute them a priori, it is\nbecause they have not sufiiciently reflected on the profound\ndifference which separates the unusual from the contradictory.\nI have therefore the right to ask that people should read my\nbook before they judge it. ...\nThe event recorded above is noteworthy in that this is\nthe first time that the Academic des Sciences has accorded\nofficial recognition to such a book as Professor Kichet's. \"VVe\nhope to review this book shortly in the Proceedings.\nHYPNOPOMPIC PICTURES.\n(EDITORIAL NOTE.

ON \"\nTHE CASE OF ABRAHAM FLORENTINE.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL or THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, For more than two years I have been examining the\nautomatic writing and seance records of Stainton Moses in the\noriginal script and preparing an account of my researches which\nwill soon be published. In this connection I wrote last summer\nto the Secretary of the S.P.R. suggesting that an enquiry should\nbe made in the United States as to whether any obituary notice\nof Abraham Florentine appeared in the American papers and\nmight conceivably have formed the basis of the communications\nascribed to his spirit. The Secretary kindly took steps to carry\nout my suggestion and informed me of the result. I did not\n.\nanticipate the publication of the enquiring officer's report without\nreference to me and the sequel of a correspondence in the Journal\non the merits of the case. As my name was not mentioned\nin the November issue, which contained the report, several persons\nwho know of the researches in which I am engaged have drawn\nmy attention to the correspondence without realising that the\nenquiry was made at my instance. There may be others who\nare surprised at my silence but have not mentioned the subject\nto me. With all due deference I feel that some of the con-\nclusions expressed in the November issue are hardly justified by\nthe ascertained facts, that the views of your correspondents might\nbe modified in the light of a full knowledge of the unpublished\nrecords, and that even if the obituary notice served as the basis\nof the communications the hypothesis of cryptomnesia does not\ncover all the ground. I cannot go further into details without\nforestalling what will soon be published and without requiring\n\f22.\nCorrespondence, -.\">!>\n.\ntoo much space in your columns, for this case cannot be con-\nsidered adequately as a single problem, it must be regarded as\none of a series.

Everard Feilding of the\nrecent experiment in faking\n\"\nspirit\n\"\nphotographs, carried out on\nthe initiative of Mr. James Douglas. We have received two\nletters on the subject, which we print below together with a\nreply from Mr. Feilding. We also print a statement from Mr.\nWilliam Marriott, who, having been shown the letters from our\ntwo correspondents, has kindly consented to disclose the method\nby which the trick was performed. Our thanks are due to Mr.\nMarriott for thus\n\"\ngiving himself away\n\"\nior our benefit.)\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\n(1) MADAM, Mr. Feilding's last sentence l\nis noteworthy :\n\"\na\nlittle foresight, some luck, and more bluff and you get an\nextra.\"\nOne must concede that Mr. Hope must possess these qualities\nto a superlative degree (if one can call\n\"\nluck\n\"\na quality) con-\nsidering that he has never been\n\"\ncaught out,\" in spite of in-\nnumerable tests with persons who were good amateur conjurers\nand expert photographers.\nFor Mr. James Douglas was altogether too easy a prey for a\nskilful conjurer like Mr. Marriott, highly strung, nervous and so\nflustered that he signed the same plate twice, one signature over\nthe other, and packed and stowed away in an inner pocket his\nopened packet of plates without being aware that he had done so.\nI am glad that Mr. Feilding recognises that not much credence\n<jan be attached to Mr. Marriott's statements as to how he\n\"\ndid\nthe trick,\" but I fear he has allowed himself to be bluffed on this\noccasion when he asserts that it was not done either by the\nsubstitution of slides or of plates.\nBut what I want to deprecate is all this attitude of secrecy\nand mystery connected with so-called exposures of the methods\nof faking\n\"\nspirit\n\"\nphotographs.\nMr. Patrick and Mr. Whately Smith recently published a long\naccount of how photographs might be faked, but the only actual\na\nCp.

APRIL, 1922,\nexperiment was carried out under conditions as ludicrously unlike\nconditions one can obtain with Mr. Hope, that it has no value.\nMoreover, in spite of repeated requests, no prints of the results\nhave been published.\nHere again in the Douglas-Marriott experiment, we are left\nquite uncertain as to the real methods employed by Mr. Marriott.\nMr. Feilding states that it is quite easy to produce the\n\"\ncloud\n\"\neffects and clear faces seen in some of Mr. Hope's best\n\"\npsychic\n\"\nphotographs. I have no doubt that this is correct, if a plate is\nprepared beforehand and substituted in the dark room, but can\nthe effect be produced in any other way ? It is loosely stated\nthat it can be, but I have never heard of its being actually done\nbefore competent and credible witnesses.\nWhat seems to be required is that\n\"\nextras,\" comparable to\nMr. Hope's best effects, should actually be produced by each of\nthe alleged processes seriatim, not secretly, but slowly and openly,\nin the presence of a small Committee of expert photographers and\nconjurers, each process being carefully noted and recorded, and\nthe results printed. It should then be considered theoretically\nand practically whether these processes could be carried out\nunder the conditions obtaining at a Hope sitting without being\ndetected by a competent observer.\nThis would be scientific, and would be of great value in enabling\nus to judge better as to the probability of Mr. Hope's phenomena\nbeing genuine, while it would help the experimenter as to what\nparticularly to observe at a Hope sitting, and increase the value\nof his record.\nSurely we all want to get if possible to the truth in the matter\nof so-called psychic photography, and there is more hope of\naccomplishing this end by observation and experiment than by\nslinging accusations against the\n\"\npsychic\n\"\nphotographers.\nC. E. BADDELEY, Colonel.\nWALBOTTLE HALL,\nNEWBURN-ON-TYNE.\n(2) MADAM, May I be permitted to remark upon the article\nin the Journal of the S.P.R. for February, 1922, entitled an\n\"\nExperiment in Faking\n'\nSpirit\n'\nPhotographs,\" as it would seem\nthat there are a few points that are open to criticism.\n(1) In the last line on p. 219, these words occur, . . .\n\"working\nunder precisely the same conditions. . . .\"\n\fAPRIL, ii>22.\nCorrespondence. 261\n(2) In the 5th and 6th lines on p. 220, ...\" that if any of\nthe observers noticed any departure from the prescribed con-\nditions, they should at once say so. . . .\"\n(3) On p. 221, in the 22nd line, ...\" he (Mr. Marriott) said\nhe had only brought one slide. ...\"\nWith reference to (1) it would seem that the conditions were\nnot precisely the same as those followed by Mr. Douglas, when\nexperimenting with Hope at Crewe ;\nas on p. 221, line 24, we\nare informed that at Mr. Marriott's invitation, all the Committee\nwere asked to go into the dark room to witness the method of\"\nfilling the dark slide, etc.\nIt would be of interest to hear Mr. Marriott's real reason for\ngiving this invitation.\nRegarding (2) it is unfortunate that no member of the Committee\nraised the question (as they had authority to), as to whether this\ninvitation on Mr. Marriott's part was in order.\nHad the invitation been refused by all, it seems possible that\nMr. Marriott might have refused to be searched after this visit to\nthe dark room, as he had already done, before the visit took\nplace.\nThe reason he gave in lines 3, 4, p. 221, for not being searched\napplies equally to both periods of the experiment.\nPerhaps Mr. Marriott will explain ! As to (3) it is stated in\nie detail report of the experiment published in the Sunday\nExpress of December llth, 1921, that, when Mr. Marriott was\nasked . . .\n\"\nif he had a second dark slide, he at once took one\nout of his overcoat pocket. ...\" This scarcely confirms his\nstatement, given in the S.P.R. article, on p. 221.\nIt is noticeable that nowhere in any report of the experiment,\nas far as I am aware, does Mr. Marriott definitely state that he\ndid not substitute another dark slide for the original one. We\nknow, of course, that he tricked the Committee somehow but\nit does not seem to me that we are getting one step nearer to\nthe truth, or otherwise, of psychic photography by rather implying\nthat Hope does not change his dark slides, but is still a man\npossessing sufficient skill to hoodwink those who experiment' with\nhim in some other way.\nWill Mr. Marriott certify that he did not change his dark slide\nor bring with him more than one slide ?\nDoes Mr. Feilding mean by the last three lines of his article,\nthat Hope, by\n\"\na little foresight, some luck and more bluff,\" has\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1022.\nobtained the hundreds of supernormal effects on the sensitive plates\nthat have appeared at Crewe and elsewhere, when these plates\nhave been exposed in his presence ?\nThat it is possible to. imitate many of these curious effects on\nplates is of course quite well known to anyone possessing a\nsmall amount of photographic knowledge ;\nthere are, however,\nmany Hope results, that would, I think, baffle the cleverest\nworkers, because microscopic examination fails to find in these,\nthe evidence of the employment of normal human action, that\nwould appear in the imitator's productions.\nIt would be of much interest if Mr. Marriott would be good\nenough to submit some of his\n\"\nmystic cloud\n\"\neffects for such an\nexamination, and comparison with the Hope results which they\nare said to imitate. R. E. E. SPENCER.\n(3) Reply from Mr. Feilding.\nMADAM, I have submitted the letters from Colonel Baddeley\nand Major Spencer, which you sent me, to Mr. Marriott, and I\nnow forward his reply. It will be appreciated that, as the trick\nwas not mine to give away, I could not write more specifically\nin my former communication. As Mr. Marriott has now responded\nso fully to the request made to him, there is little for me to add.\nI must however point out that Colonel Baddeley is wrong in\nsaying that I had ever asserted that the trick was not done by\nthe substitution either of slides or of plates. What I did say\nwas that Mr. M'Kenzie was wrong in his belief that it was done\nby substitution of slides. Concerning the clouds, I am not a\nphotographic expert, but I understand that Colonel Baddeley is\nprobably right in his view that a really good psychic effect can\nonly be got by preparation and subsequent substitution. I do\nnot think therefore the slow and open production of extras before\na Committee a proceeding that should fairly be imposed on those\nwho believe that spirit photography is fraudulent, as a condition\nof the acceptance of their theory. It will be noted that Mr.\nMarriott relies in the first instance on what I assume to be the\nbasic principle of all conjuring, misdirection, in order to gain an\nopportunity to effect substitution, and it would only be where\nthis had failed that any dark-room expedient would at the last\nmoment be resorted to as a pis-aller.\nIn reply to Major Spencer's question, I specifically abstained\nin my paper from drawing any inferences affecting Mr. Hope.\n\fAI-KIL, 11122.\nCorrespondence.\nJ have only had two experiments with that gentleman, one of\nwhich was 9 years ago, and do not consider myself qualified to\nexpress an opinion. But I think myself safe in saying that Mr.\nPatrick and Mr. Marriott have shown that with a suitable admix-\nture of foresight, luck and bluff, very respectable extras can,\nwithout any help from\n\"\nthe other side,\" be concocted in what\nappear to observers to be fraud-proof conditions, until the loop-\nhole is actually revealed to them.\nIt seems to me now to rest with Mr. Hope, Mrs. Dean or\nMr. Vearncombe, to carry the controversy a stage further by\ninviting their spiritual coadjutors to introduce conditions beyond\nthe powers of their earthly rival to imitate.\nEVERARD FP:ILDING.\n(4) Statement by Mr. William Marriott.\nMADAM, Possibly the best reply I can make to Colonel\nBaddeley's and Major Spencer's letters, is to describe as shortly\nas possible some of the various methods which in my opinion are\nemployed by Hope, and then explain how I did the trick on\nMr. Douglas. Conjurers are not usually expected to give away\ntheir tricks, but as my chief purpose is not to advertise myself\nbut seriously to contribute to the demolition of what I am con-\nvinced is a pernicious and growing conspiracy of fraud, I can\noffer no objection to the invitation addressed to me.\nThe chief methods of fraudulent spirit photography may be\nsummarised as follows :\n1. The substitution of a dark slide containing prepared plates\nfor the one loaded by the sitter with his own plates.\n2. The substitution of prepared plates for unprepared ones\nbefore these are loaded in the dark slide.\n3. The use of a pocket flash light apparatus for impressing an\nunprepared plate after it has been placed in the dark slide.\n4. The addition of extraneous chemical during the process of\ndevelopment.\n5. The use of pinholes in the fabric covering the dark-room\nlamp.\n6. The use of similar pinholes on the cloth used for focussing\nthe camera.\n7. The placing of a negative or a positive in the camera in\nfront of the plate in such a position that the light passing through\nit will produce an image more or less blurred.\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1922.\nEach of these methods may be used in a variety of ways.\nIn fact, so subtle is their application that it is almost impossible\nfor any observer not specially trained to prevent one or the\nother of them being employed.\nIt is, no doubt, to this constant change of method that the\nspirit photographers owe their immunity from absolute exposure.\nIf the operator fails to find or to create an opportunity for\nworking one of his dodges, he merely does nothing at all. Th-e\nspiritual\n\"\natmosphere\n\"\nis not right,\n\"\nconditions\n\"\nare unfavour-\nable, the\n\"\nforce\n\"\nis weak ;\nand he hopes for better luck next\ntime, and usually gets it.\nWhich method has been used in any particular case can only\nbe ascertained from a critical examination of the finished negative\n(a print is of no use), and the procedure followed .at that parti-\ncular sitting. It is, however, unfortunately a matter of constant\noccurrence that sitters attach the account of one sitting to the\nresult obtained at another.\nNow a careful examination of the photograph produced by\nHope for Mr. James Douglas convinced me that it was not the\nresult of a pill-box exposure, but due to the deliberate preparation\nof the plate beforehand. This narrowed the reproduction to a\ncase of substitution. Mr. M'Kenzie jumped to the conclusion\nthat I had changed the dark slides. He was wrong as the follow-\ning account will show.\nLet me first describe the dark room. The window at which\nthe slides are loaded is in the main wall of the building. The\nruby fabric is placed at the outside edge of this so that there\nis a ledge some 15 inches in depth between the fabric and the\nback of the bench. This bench is not on a level with the\nwindow but some twelve inches below it. The result of this\narrangement is that the bench is in absolute darkness.\nMr. Douglas and I entered the dark room. He immediately\nopened the packet of plates and placed one in the dark slide.\nIn doing this he quite unwittingly departed from his own pro-\ncedure in his Hope sitting, a repetition of which I had hoped for,\nbut since to have drawn his attention to this would have made\nhim suspicious, I had to let it pass. But that plate had to be\ngot out of the slide. Now, there is in these Lancaster Cameras\na loose piece of blackened card which is used to separate the\nplates. I conveniently lost this. To find it, would require the\nturning up of the light. This necessitated the plate being taken\n\f1922. Correspondence.\nfrom the slide and returned to the packet which was lying on\nthe table outside its box. I apparently went to the other end\nof the room to turn on the light and Mr. Douglas commenced\nfeeling for the card. As soon as his hands were occupied I placed\na packet of prepared plates on the bench and his in my pocket.\nThe cardboard was then conveniently found without it being\nnecessary to turn on the light and my prepared plates were\nloaded by Mr. Douglas himself into the dark slide without\nsuspicion.\nWhen I came out of the dark room my plans were near being\nfrustrated by Mr. M'Kenzie's accusation. I had to get rid of\nthe plates before I could allow myself to be searched. Just to\ntest Mr. M'Kenzie's and Sir Arthur's powers of observation, I\ninvited them all into the dark room. And when Mr. Douglas was\nputting his second plate into the dark slide, I simply placed the\npacket in my pocket into the open box.\nThe sitting over and myself searched without anything being\nfound, it was necessary for me to get hold of the packet which\nMr. Douglas now had in his pocket, as this contained twelve\nplates and not eight as it should have done, four having been\nused. I therefore casually asked him what he was going to do\nwith them. He in all innocence replied that they were of no\nuse to him and gave them to me. Thus all ended well.\nI had a second dark slide with me. The camera was not my\nown, I had hired it for the day and had to return it the same\nevening. The two slides were unfortunately differently marked,\none having the Lancaster metal trade mark on it and the other\nbeing plain. I therefore used the marked slide to hold sundry\nscrews and fittings which I had had to remove to make the\napparatus more manageable for this particular occasion.\nThe pill-box felt in my pocket was a flash-lamp apparatus,\nwhich I had in readiness in case of accident. I had also four\nother dodges ready up my sleeve.\nHad my reading of the Hope method not come off, I should\nstill have been able to produce something, but the fairies would\nhave been lost.\nI hope that this simple and, I trust, clear explanation will set\nall doubts at rest. I can assure my readers that nothing hitherto\ndone by Hope cannot be repeated by myself under the same\nconditions. I can, and will with pleasure give anyone sufficiently\ninterested a set of fool-proof conditions, conditions under which\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 11)22.\nI\nunhesitatingly state I can NOT produce an extra. When Hope\nsucceeds in circumventing these, I will admit that the case demands\nfurther investigation, but not till then.\nColonel Baddeley, I think, undervalues the articles in the\nPsychic Research Quarterly by Mr. Patrick and Mr. Whately\nSmith. It was an account not only of how photographs mifffit\nbe faked, but of how they were faked, and to the satisfaction\nof critical, non-spiritistic, University beholders. Further, he is\nwrong in saying that no prints of the results have been published.\nMr. Patrick has kindly supplied me with a couple of prints which\nI have made into lantern slides and shown publicly in my lectures,\nand I understand that lantern slides have been made and shown\nby him of the rest.\nAs regards Major Spencer's statement that there are many Hope\nresults that would baffle imitation, I can only say that although\nI have examined a large number of these photographs, I have so\nfar seen none that seem to me to carry on their face any evidence\nof supernormal origin. If Major Spencer would be good enough\nto lend me a few which appear to him to be of this character\nI should be very grateful, and would at least do my best to\nsupply him with humanly produced imitations.\nWILLIAM MARRIOTT.\nIII. ON \"\nTHE Modus Operandi IN SO-CALLED MEDIUMISTIC\nTRANCE.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, In Lady Troubridge's interesting and suggestive paper\non\n\"\nThe Modus Operandi in so-called Mediumistic Trance,\" the\ntheory is\ntentatively put forward that the Personal Controls may\nbe a deeper hypnotic level of Mrs. Leonard's trance. If this\nwere so, I gather from the Doris Fischer case, and especially\nfrom Dr. Mitchell's paper on that case, S.P.R. Proceedings, Part 79,\npage 59, that we should expect to find that Feda would know\nnothing about material given through personal control, but that\nthe personal control would know all about the Feda material.\nFrom the notes of my own sittings with Mrs. Leonard, I find\nthat not only are the personal controls aware of things given\nthrough Feda ;\nbut that, on occasion, Feda shows knowledge of\npersonal control material. On September 22nd, 1921, a D.G.I.\npersonal control had been reminding me of a time in our lives\n\f,\nr.i!. Correspondence -!7\nwhen our ordinary home life had been interrupted, spoiled. The\nfact was that we had provided a home, for over a year, for a\nlady mentally afflicted. Feda, returning for a moment to say\ngood-bye, at the conclusion of the personal control, remarked as\nfollows :\n\"\nI've come back, Mr. Bill ... she remembers things\nshe can't get through Feda . . . one or two personal things,\nshops, and things, and noosances about people whom she didn't\nwant.\" Showing, I think, clear knowledge of what had just been\nsaid. May I add my own witness to that of Lady Troubridge,\nas to the striking reproduction of quality and tone of voice, of\npersons no longer in the body, that we get on these occasions.\nW. S. IRVING.\nIV. BLEEDING STIGMATA.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, With reference to Father Thurston's claim that the\nabove have never been experimentally produced reluctant as\nI am to join issue with Father Thurston, especially on a subject\nthat he has given so much more attention to than I have myself,\nI am nevertheless, in the interests of truth, obliged to support\nMr. Hubert Wales in his contrary contention, of which he furnishes\nproof in his letter to the Journal for December, 1921.\nThe late Lord D., a well-known Catholic peer, told a sister\nof mine, who told me, that when he was going over an hypnotic\nhospital somewhere in France, the doctor who showed him over\nstopped at one of the beds, and asked him to watch what would\nhappen. After presumably making some passes over the man\nwho was to be the subject of the experiment, the doctor said :\n\"\nVous etes le Christ\n\"\n; upon which the man instantly assumed\nthe attitude of the Sacred Figure on the Cross and blood flowed\nfrom the wounds as familiarly depicted.\nUnfortunately both my sister and Lord D. have recently\ndied, but this story derives a certain corroboration from the\npresent Lord D., brother of the late peer, to whom I have\nwritten on the subject.\nHe says :\n\"\nMy late brother told my wife many years ago\nthat he saw a patient in a hospital (she thinks in Paris), and\nthat this man when hypnotised stretched himself in the form\nof a cross, but my wife cannot remember anything about the\nblood flowing from wounds being mentioned. I am sorry I cannot\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL. 1922.\ngive you any more information as my brother never mentioned\nthe subject to me.\"\nIt is, I think, evident that if the man had merely stretched\nhimself under hypnosis and assumed the rigid attitude of the\nCrucified, the story would have been hardly worth telling ;\nbut I well remember how impressed my sister seemed to be with\nLord D.'s narrative of the wounds appearing\n\"\nalmost instantly\n\"\nand the blood flowing from them, and how she impressed me.\nFRANCES M.

PRICE'S LIBRARY.\nEARLY in the year Mr. Harry Price, a member of the Society,\noffered to place on permanent loan in the Society's Rooms his\nmagnificent collection of books on magic and witchcraft. The\noffer was gratefully accepted by the Council, and so through\nhis generosity Mr. Price has given the officers of the Society\nthe benefit of being able to consult what is generally considered\nto be the most complete library of magical literature in Great\nBritain, if not in Europe.\nThe library is strictly for reference purposes but, when the\ncatalogue is finished, as many of the volumes as possible will\nbe available for reference by Members and Associates, whilst\nthe rest books printed for restricted circulation only will be\n\fMAT, 1922. Mr. Price's Library. 271\nreserved for the officers of the Society for use in their investi-\ngations.\nIt may be of interest to members to know something of the\ncontents of the collection. The bulk of the volumes consist\nof works on magic in the sense of legerdemain and comprise\nevery well-known book published in this country and abroad.\nMany of the older works are now practically unobtainable,\nand even modern works of this kind are so carefully guarded\nthat they soon go out of print, and not being sold in the\nusual way escape the notice of bibliographers. Among some\nof the rarer books we would mention firstly a fine copy of\nScot's Discoverie of Witchcraft, first edition from the Yatton\nCourt Library together with all the subsequent editions. There\nis also a tall copy of the 1581 edition of Bodin's De Magorum\nDemonomania ;\na complete set of the rare Conjuror's Magazine\nwith all the plates printed in 1792-1793 ;\na number of the\nrare chap-books and small popular volumes published in\nLondon in the eighteenth century ;\na set of pamphlets on the\namazing case of Mary Tofts, the rabbit breeder, and a great\nnumber of similar items on impostors of all ages and all\ntimes. The section on stage telepathy is especially rich,\nand there are works on codes from 1533 to the present day.\nIn MSS. the collection is well known for the inclusion of a\nBurmese MS. on the work of the Indian fakirs which was\ntranscribed by Sir Richard Burton and also for smaller MSS.\non magic and astrology. Taken together, the books number\nabout fifteen hundred items, and when the list is complete\nit will be available for consultation by members on application\nto the Secretary.\nNot content with loaning the above collection to the Society,\n[r. Price has also offered to loan his photographic material\n>r use in experimental work. This comprises about two\nmndred and fifty pounds' worth of photographic apparatus,\nicluding everything necessary for work in this field.\nA CASE OF FEAUD WITH THE CREWE CIRCLE.\nthe last number of the Journal it will be remembered\nit a discussion upon faking spirit photographs was initiated\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1922.\nby Col. Baddeley and Major Spencer, arising out of an experi-\nment conducted by Mr. William Marriott. The controversy\nrevolved around the alleged mediumship of Mr. William Hope\nof Crewe, and in speaking of him Col. Baddeley remarked that\n\"\nhe has never been\n'\ncaught out,' in spite of innumerable tests\nwith persons who were good amateur conjurers and expert\nphotographers.\" It may not be known to members generally,\nthat the officers of the Society have for some considerable\ntime been endeavouring to persuade Mr. Hope to allow his\nmediumship to be tested by a competent committee. The\npresent Research Officer has done his utmost since his appoint-\nment to persuade Mr. Hope and his advisers to allow him to\nhave some sittings under almost any conditions, but without\navail. Fortunately, however, we have been able to avail\nourselves of certain investigations by persons whose qualifi-\ncations were partly unknown to the medium and his advisers.\nWe print below a report from one of these investigators,\ndealing with the medium Hope ;\nthe writer of this report,\nMr. Harry Price, is a Member of the Society, and combines\na wide experience of photographic processes with an extensive\nacquaintance with deceptive methods and contrivances. At one\ntime he was Hon. Librarian of the Magicians' Club, London,\nand is also a member of the Society of American Magicians.\nThe Society possesses two\n\"\nspirit\n\"\nphotographs taken by Mr.\nPrice twenty-two years ago, which indicate that the writer\npossesses some qualifications for the experiment described\nbelow.\nAbout 1915 Mr. Price applied to Mr. William Hope for a\nsitting, but received no reply. On March 10, 1921, he applied\nagain, but met with a similar result. On November 11, 1921,\nhe called at the British College of Psychic Science, with a\nletter of introduction from the Librarian of the London\nSpiritualist Alliance (of which organisation he is a member),\nand saw the Hon. Secretary, Mrs. B. M'Kenzie, who promised\nto try to arrange a sitting.\nOn January 12, 1922, he received the following letter from\nthe College :\nDEAR MR. PRICE, I enclose particulars of an experiment offered\nyou with the\n\"\nCrewe Circle.\"\n\fMAY, 1922. A Case of Fraiid with the Crewe Circle. 273\nIf you decide to take this, kindly confirm as soon as possible.\nThe fee for non-members is 2 2s. Od., to be paid on confirmation.\nYou should provide a half-dozen packet of plates for the experi-\nment, Imperial, or Wellington Wards are considered preferable.\nMr. Hope gives every opportunity to the sitter during the\nexperiment, but he will not undertake tests and will use his own\ncamera.\nNothing is guaranteed but good results can be assisted by\nsitters keeping the plates in their environment for a few days.\nIf you wish you are at liberty to bring a friend to share the\nsitting if they are sympathetic, for the one fee.\nE. FORD,\nAss. Secy.\nAppointment.\nFriday, Jan. 27th, 10.30 a.m.\nOn January 21, 1922, a letter was received from the College,\nsaying that owing to illness the Crewe Circle would have to\ntransfer the appointment to February 3, which date was again\ncancelled in favour of February 24, at 10.30 a.m.\nMeanwhile Mr. Price had been considering what steps were\nadvisable in order to make sure that the results, if\nany,\nshould be genuine. Accordingly, on January 25, he visited the\nworks of the Imperial Dry Plate Co., Ltd., at Cricklewood,\nand discussed the whole matter with the Secretary. In\nwriting to Miss Newton the same night, he says :\nI have spent the morning at the works of the Imperial Dry\nPlate Co., Ltd., Cricklewood, discussing and trying out various\ntests by which we can invisibly mark the plates which will be\nhanded to Hope. We have decided as the best method that the\nplates shall be exposed to the X-rays, with a leaden figure of a\nlion rampant (the trade mark of the Imperial Co.) intervening.\nThe centres of each set of four plates will be treated, so that\nwhen the plates are placed in their proper order, the full design\nwill be seen. This is to safeguard against the allegation that some\nof the plates may have been missed in the marking.\nAny plate developed will reveal a quarter of the design, besides\nany photograph or\n\"\nextra\n\"\nthat may be on the plate. This\nwill show us absolutely whether the plates have been substituted.\nI am also thinking out other safeguards that may help us.\nA2\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.\nThe Imperial Plate Co., writing three days later, confirms\nthe experiments made at their works, and in forwarding a\nbox of six prepared plates writes :\nWe are sending to-day under separate cover the box of our\nFlashlight plates, quarter-plate size, bearing batch No. 14400 G.\nThese 6 plates have been specially dealt with by us, and have\nbeen put through an exposure for a small portion of each under\nour X-ray apparatus, so that when the plates are developed parts\nof the design of our rampant lion trade mark will appear upon\neach of them.\nFour of the plates when put together will complete the whole\ndesign, whilst the other two will only form a portion of the\ndesign, whilst we have the remaining two to complete the figure\nin our possession, which we are retaining until you communicate\nwith us again.\nWe have tested this method and find it to be quite infallible,\nand it is impossible for anyone to have adopted the same steps\nwhich we have with regard to these 6 plates, and therefore it\nwould be quite impossible for anyone to have effected any ex-\nchange of plates for the method you have under consideration.\nIn due course the plates arrived, and Mr. Price immediately\nhanded them in their original postal packings to Mr. H. J.\nMoger of Pulborough, Sussex, who, in turn, sealed them\nprivately and forwarded them to the Secretary of the Society\nfor Psychical Research, for safe keeping. In this condition\nthey were kept until handed to Hope in the seance room at\nthe British College of Psychic Science.\nAnother point which occupied Mr. Price's attention was the\nchoice of a suitable companion to assist him during the sitting.\nActing on the advice of the Research Officer, he asked Mr.\nJames Seymour to accompany him ;\nthis gentleman, by a\nhappy concatenation of circumstances, combining precisely that\nknowledge of photography and trickery so essential for an\nexperiment of this kind. On the morning fixed for the sitting\nthe Research Officer met Mr. Price and his companion at\nHolland Park Station, and handed over the sealed packet of\nplates for use in the experiment. After it was over, both\ninvestigators immediately proceeded to the Rooms of the S.P.R.,\nwhere a report of the sitting was dictated to a stenographer,\n\fMAY, 1922. A Case of Fraud with the Crewe Circle. 275\nin the presence of both the Secretary and the Research Officer.\nThe following is a connected narrative of what occurred during\nthe time that Mr. Price and Mr. Seymour were at the College\nfor the experiment. It is derived entirely from the verbatim\ndictated report taken down within forty-five minutes from the\nconclusion of the sitting.\nMR. PRICE'S REPORT OF HIS SITTING.\nWE got to the B.C.P.S. at 10.25 a.m., and the door was opened\nby a clerk. We took off our coats and walked into the reception\nroom where Mrs. M'Kenzie was waiting for us. We had a very\npleasant conversation with her, and we were very cheerful and\ndid all we could to impress her with the fact that we had come\nto Mr. Hope in a friendly manner and would put no obstacle\nin his way. We were escorted up to the top floor, and walked\ninto the well-lighted studio, when Mrs. Buxton came in and was\nintroduced by Mrs. M'Kenzie. I made myself extremely pleasant ;\nsaid how sorry I was that they had been ill with influenza, and\nasked after the Crewe Circle, saying that my people were natives\nof Shropshire. I ingratiated myself with them in every way.\nAfterwards, Mrs. Buxton seemed particularly friendly. Just at\nthat period Mrs. M'Kenzie left us, and Mr. Hope walked in from\nthe room outside on the left. I repeated my solicitations after\nhis health and made myself extremely affable to him. He also\nseemed very pleasant and friendly. He asked me whether I had\never done any photography. I said I used to do quite a lot\nsome years ago as I did. The plates had been on the table\nduring the whole of the conversation and were in the original\nImperial postal wrappers as sent to me at Pulborough.\nMr. Hope then asked us to sit round the table. We sat at\na small table, Mrs. Buxton facing me, Mr. Seymour on my right,\nand Mr. Hope on my left. I noticed Mrs. Buxton eyeing the\npacket with the outer wrappers very considerably, because appar-\nently she was not used to having plates brought like that. Mr.\nHope then asked me to undo the postal packet, which I did,\nand I cut the string in two places, and threw the postal wrappers\non the floor, placing the unopened packet of plates on the table.\nMr. Hope then picked up the packet of plates and started\nexamining them. Then Mrs. Buxton said,\n\"\nThey are flash-light.\"\nI said,\n\"\nI told the Imperial people that they were for portraiture\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1922.\ninside a London room, and they suggested flash-light.\" Then Mr.\nHope examined the packet and he then handed it to Mrs. Buxton,\nwho again examined the packet very minutely I could see her\neyeing the packet. In my opinion, at that juncture they came\nto the conclusion that the packet had not been tampered with,\nbecause at that momemt Mrs. Buxton asked me whether the\npacket had been opened. I said,\n\"\nIt is exactly as I got it from\nthe makers, outer wrapper and all\n\"\nI was careful to say that.\nMrs. Buxton then examined it to find the speed number, as\nMr. Hope apparently could not see it.\nSuddenly Mrs. Buxton\nsaid,\n\"\nHere is the speed number, it is 400 on the packet,\" and\nMr. Hope said,\n\"\nOh, yes, that will be all right.\"\n[Mr. Seymour here interpolated :\n\"\nMr. Hope said he had not\nworked with flash-light plates before, and thought they would\nbe quite all right and not hamper the experiment. They were\nthoroughly taken in by the packet and were not suspicious of it.\"]\nMr. Hope then pushed the plates into the middle of the table,\nand said,\n\"\nWe will have a hymn,\" and asked me whether I had\nany particular choice of hymns. I said,\n\"\nI know all the old\nones I should like\n'\nOnward Christian Soldiers.'\n\"\nMr. Hope looked at Mrs. Buxton and said,\n\"\nCould you manage\n'\nOnward Christian Soldiers\n'\n?\n\"\nShe hesitated, and so, as I saw\nthe hesitation, I said,\n\"\nAny familiar hymn will do.\" So Mr.\nHope then said,\n\"\nHow about\n'\nNearer my God to Thee\n'\n?\n\"\nI then placed my hands flat on the table; Mr. Hope's right\nhand was on my left, and my other hand was over Mr. Seymour's\non my right, and Mr. Seymour's other hand was on Mrs. Buxton's\nwe were simply linked up. Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton's hands\nwere not linked during the whole of the time. Mrs. Buxton then\nsang several verses six or seven of\n\"\nNearer my God to Thee,\"\nin a tune with which I was unfamiliar and did not recognise.\nI did, however, join in where and how I could.\nAfter the hymn Mr. Hope gave a long impromptu prayer, in\nwhich he thanked God for all our many mercies, and hoped He\nwould continue His blessings up to the present moment. He\nalso craved blessings on our fellow-creatures and friends on the\nother side, and asked assistance in the attempt to link up with\nthem, etc. etc. Then Mrs. Buxton sang another hymn, and then\nMr. Hope picked up the packet of plates from the centre of the\ntable and put them between Mrs. Buxton's hands ;\nthen he put\n\fMAT, 1922. A Case of Fraud with the Crewe Circle. 277\nhis hands on hers, I put my hands on his, and Mr. Seymour came\nlast of all, making a pile of hands with the packet of plates in\nthe centre. Then we had another short impromptu prayer by Mrs.\nBuxton. Then the Lord's Prayer was sung, and a short hymn\nconcluded the service.\nMr. Hope now asked me whether I would like to sit by myself,\nor whether I would like Mr. Seymour to sit with me. Of course\nI said I would like to sit by myself, and Mr. Seymour made the\nremark that as it was my sitting he would prefer that I should\nsit by myself.\n[Mr. Seymour here interpolated : \"It would not have helped\nme to sit with him, and to be alone gave me freer movement.\"]\nThen the plates were left on the table ;\nI stood up, and Mr.\nHope went into the dark-room, and brought his dark-slide to the\ndoor to show me. He opened it out, saying,\n\"\nThese shutters pull\nout like this, etc.\" (it was an ordinary double dark-slide), and\nsaid,\n\"\nThis piece of black card in between is to separate the\nplates.\" He handed the dark-slide to me to examine, and I\nmarked it indelibly twice on both sides (twelve marks in all),\nand then I handed it back to Mr. Hope. He said,\n\"\nYou see\nthere is no film in here ;\nsome people think I put films in and\ndo the trick that way,\" and I said,\n\"\nHowever could they think\nsuch a thing, it is absurd !\n\"\nHe then came into the room,\npicked up the packet of plates, which were then on the table,\nand invited me to go with him into the dark-room. I was\nabout to ask that Mr. Seymour should come with me, when he\ntook the words out of my mouth by asking Mr. Seymour to sit\ndown at the table with Mrs. Buxton, and keep his hands on it\nall the time, so as to\n\"\nmaintain the influence.\" After the\nsitting was over, he said to Mr. Seymour,\n\"\nYou could have come\nin the dark-room, if you had liked.\"\nAt the entrance to the door he asked me whether I would\nopen the packet of plates. While I was feeling for my knife,\nhe pulled out a knife and opened the packet himself. He then\nmade a remark to Mrs. Buxton to look after Mr. Seymour, while\nwe were in the dark-room, after which he closed the dark-room\ndoor. He then handed me the dark-slide again, and also handed\nme the opened packet of plates. He then said,\n\"\nI will not\ntouch the plates, as I don't want you to think there is any\ntrickery. Do exactly as I tell you, I will not put a finger on\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.\nthe plates.\" He then said, \"Now which two will you have, some\ntake one and two, some one and three, some three and four.\nWill you take the 1st and 3rd ?\n\"\nI said,\n\"\nI will take the 1st\nand 2nd.\" He said, \"All right, it does not matter; some have\none and some have the other.\"\nI then opened the packet of plates in the dark-room, and I took\nthe first two out of the original wrapper. They had not left\nmy hands, but he touched my hand and turned it to a certain\nangle, saying,\n\"\nI must see that they go in the right side up\n\"\n(which was quite a natural proceeding). The box containing the\nother plates were in my hand the whole time. He said,\n\"\nNow\ndo exactly as I tell you. Take the first plate and put it in this\nrecess.\" He said,\n\"\nNow I will put the black paper card over\nit,\" which he had retained the whole time.\n\"\nNow will you put\nthe next one on top, exactly coinciding with the other one ?\n\"\nWe had some trouble in closing the dark-slide ;\nat last, with his\nnail, he moved the plate a fraction and so closed the slide, which\nI took. All this was done under the red window, which I noticed,\ndirectly I stepped into the room, was a graduated light, darker\nat the top. We were close up under that window. He then\ntook the dark slide from me, saying at the same time,\n\"\nWill\nyou do up the packet of plates again, as we may want them\nlater ?\n\"\nI said,\n\"\nYes, I will,\" and did so ;\nbut my eyes never\nleft that dark-slide or his hands, although I was doing up the\npacket, and I saw him as he backed, giving a half turn, two or\nthree paces from the light put the dark-slide to his left breast\npocket, and take it out again [another one ?], without any\n\"\ntalking\n\"\nor knocking. He said,\n\"\nHave you finished ?\n\"\nI said,\n\"\nYes.\" He then said,\n\"\nWill you put the packet of plates into\nyour pocket so as I cannot touch them.\" I said,\n\"\nYes.\" We\ngot to the door ;\nhe was just going to open it, when he said :\n\"\nWould you like to mark the plates and write your initials on\nthem ?\n\"\nI said,\n\"\nI don't think it matters ;\nwould you advise\nit ?\n\"\nand he said,\n\"\nOh, well, some do it ;\nsome do not.\" I said,\n\"\nI don't think I will in this case,\" and he said,\n\"\nAll right, if\nyou are satisfied, I am.\" He then handed me back the dark-\nslide, after I said I would not write my initials on the plates,\nand we walked into the studio.\n[Mr. Seymour said he was doing nothing at all while waiting\nwith Mrs. Buxton.]\n\fM,\\Y, 1922. A Case of Fraud with the Crewe Circle. 279\nDirectly we entered the studio, I, thinking he would want the\nslide at once, pulled it out of my pocket. The excuse I made\nwas that I thought he wanted the slide, but in reality it was to\nsee whether my marks were on it. They were not. But Mr.\nHope said,\n\"\nPut them (the plates) back in your pocket, as there\nis such a bright light in here, it will fog the plates.\" He then\n;i*!'d me to sit down on the chair. He then said,\n\"\nThis is an\nold Lancaster camera, given to me by Archdeacon Colley,\" and\nI remarked,\n\"\nIt must be a curio.\" He started focussing the\ncamera, and asked Mr. Seymour to come over and focus it too.\nMrs. Buxton then asked me to get into position and keep still.\nMrs. Buxton then came over and asked for the dark-slide and\nhanded it to Hope. He then drew the shutter of the dark-slide,\nand threw the focussing cloth over it and the lens of the camera,\nmaking a cap of it. He said,\n\"\nPlease be still.\" I was looking\nfull at the camera. Mr. Hope then pulled up the dark cloth\nfrom off the lens, and during the exposure he gave I counted in\nmy mind,\n\"\n1 and 2 and 3 and.\n\"\netc., and counted in that way\nup to nineteen (seconds). It was an abnormally long exposure\nfor plates of 400 H. and D. He then threw the dark cloth over\nthe lens again, and Mrs. Buxton said to Mr. Hope,\n\"\nIs that\nNo. 1 or No. 2 ?\n\"\nHe said,\n\"\nThat is No. 1.\" Mrs. Buxton\nthen said to me,\n\"\nWill you kindly take a slightly different\nposition for No. 2 ?\n\"\nand I turned my head to the right, evidently\ntoo far round for their idea, and they told me to turn it to the\nleft a little, and would I look at Mrs. Buxton. This I did.\nThey changed the dark-slide round and withdrew the second\nshutter and exposed another plate, and gave as long an exposure\nas before I counted up to\n\"\n18 and.\" While the exposures\nwere going on, Mrs. Buxton and Mr. Hope buried their heads in\nthe sides of the focussing cloth, as though in prayer, and kept con-\ntact with the camera.\nThey then closed the dark slide up and took it out of the\ncamera, and immediately handed it to me again. I then put it\nin my pocket. Mr. Hope turned to Mr. Seymour and said,\n\"\nYou\nunderstand photography ?\n\"\nMr. Seymour said,\n\"\nYes.\" Then\nhe turned to me and said,\n\"\nYou can develop it if\nyou like\n(referring to both of us), and I said,\n\"\nI will develop it.\" We\nthree then went into the dark-room with the slide in my pocket.\nMr. Hope then started mixing some developer into a glass measure ;\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.\nbrought me a rather dirty (stained with silver stains at the\nbottom) porcelain dish which just held the two quarter-plates,\nwhich were developed together. Mr. Hope took the dark-slide\nout of my hand and opened it. He then said,\n\"\nHold out your\nhands and I will tip the plates on to your hands so that I do\nnot touch them.\" He did so. I then put the plates in the\nporcelain dish myself, and Mr. Hope poured the developer over\nthem, and to my surprise, instead of the plates flashing up black\nat once, as it seemed they ought to have done had they been\nthose I brought with me, the plates developed slowly (as ordinary\nslow plates would do).\nDuring the period the plates were developing, we were talking\nupon various subjects, about photos Hope had taken ;\nand he\ntold us that last week he had to take ten plates before he got\nan\n\"\nextra\n\"\non one. Naturally, I was very anxious, and I kept\non looking to see the Imperial Co.'s trade mark come up at the\ncorner of the plates ; not a sign of it. On the other hand I\nnoticed that there was an\n\"\nextra\n\"\nforming on one of the nega-\ntives. I then took the dish and examined the plates more\nclosely at the red electric light, and he said,\n\"\nDon't put it too\nnear or you will fog them, as I did so last week,\" and he said\nhe had spoken to Mr. M'Kenzie about this light, and he (Mr.\nM'Kenzie) had not done anything yet. I then looked at the\nplates again, and I saw that the trade mark of the Imperial\nPlate Co. was not coming up on the plates, and that there was\nan \" extra\n\"\non No. 2 negative. I cried out,\n\"\nI am so glad we\nhave an\n'\nextra\n'\non here, thank you very much indeed.\" I\nthen asked him whether they were done, and he then had a look.\nWe waited a few minutes longer and he said,\n\"\nTake them out\nof the developer. Mind the step, and put them in the large\ndish of hypo, which is up there, and do not put them on top\nof each other.\" I took them out of the developer and put\nthem in the hypo. We then went into the studio again\nwhere Mrs. Buxton was awaiting us. I told Mrs. Buxton\nthat what I had come for had been very successful, and\nthanked her very much for her help and that of Mr. Hope.\nThen Mr. Hope went out of the room for a few minutes,\nand I then asked Mrs. Buxton whether I could take the other\nnegative away with me, as I fancied it was a good portrait\nof me. Mrs. Buxton thought they had no objection at all. She\n\fMAY, 1922. A Case of Fraud with the Crewe Circle. 281\nsaid,\n\"\nWhat will you put it in ? I will try and find a box when\nMr. Hope comes in.\" Mrs. Buxton then went into the dark-room\nand had. a look at the negatives, brought out the one I wanted\nnot the one with the\n\"\nextra\n\"\non and gave it to me. I said\nI could take it all right. Then she went into the dark-room\nagain, and brought out the negative with the\n\"\nextra\n\"\non, and\nI was highly delighted to see a charming female form looking\nover one of my shoulders. I said I wondered whether this was\nmy mother, and Mr. Seymour said,\n\"\nSurely your mother would\nbe older than that.\"\n\"\nMy mother died at the age of forty-one,\"\nI said. Mrs. Buxton said,\n\"\nThis is a very good one indeed.\"\nI said,\n\"\nHow many prints can I have ?\n\"\nShe said,\n\"\nMrs.\nM'Kenzie arranges all those matters. Will you see her ?\n\"\nAt\nthat moment Mr. Hope came in again and showed me a letter\nhe had recently received from Glasgow, where one of his sitters\nhad recognised a relative. I then once more thanked Mr. Hope\nfor the great service he had been to us that morning. Mr. Hope\nsaid that he thought the result was very successful and that he\nwas usually at his best early in the morning, and that accounted\nfor a very successful\n\"\nextra.\" I said if I happened to be near\nCrewe I should like to call on him, and he said\n\"\nDo, and we\nwill fix up a sitting with you, but let me know a little before-\nhand.\" I took my negative away ; shook hands with them both ;\nsaw Mrs. M'Kenzie ;\nthanked her and told her it had been very\nsuccessful, and asked her if I could have a dozen photographs.\nShe said,\n\"\nYou are entitled to two,\" and so I offered to pay\nfor the other ten, which she said would be 6d. each. I gave her\na 1 note, and she went into the office and brought me back\nthe change. We left the college at 11.20 a.m.\n[Mr. Seymour is in substantial agreement with everything that\nMr. Price has said concerning the part that he played in the\nsitting.]\n[Signed] HARRY PRICE.\nThe same afternoon, Mr. Price, Mr. Seymour and Mr. Ding-\nwall went to the studio of Keginald Haines, in Southampton\nRow, where the remainder of the plates were developed at\n3.5 p.m. by an operator of Mr. Haines' under supervision. On\neach of the four plates the section of the Imperial Co.'s trade\nmark came up clearly, thus showing what part of the design\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, MAT, 1922.\nHope had retained. The figures will, we hope, make the\nmatter clear.\nFig. 1 illustrates the design of the leaden stencil used in\nmarking by the X-rays.

It is one of the two plates substi-\ntuted by Hope (as described above). Of the two original\nplates retained by Hope one, as we have said, is now in our\npossession, thus making only one blank in the complete set\nof eight plates, including the two kept by the Imperial Dry\nPlate Co., Ltd. (see their letter above), which they returned\nfor the purpose of discovering what portion of the design had\nbeen retained by the medium.\nIn the above case, it can, we think, hardly be denied that\nMr. William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately sub-\nstituting his own plates for those of a sitter. The move was\nas good as seen to take place, and the supposition that it did\nwas abundantly confirmed both when the slide was examined,\nand when the plates were developed. Presumably that substi-\ntution was effected by the medium in order to obtain a plate\nupon which an\n\"\nextra\n\"\nhad already been impressed. If such\nwas the case (and we cannot conceive of any other reason\nfor substitution), it implies that the medium brings to the\nsitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent\npurposes. Possibly he has other methods when substitution\nis not possible. Possibly also these methods could be\ndetected as easily as substitution, were competent witnesses,\nwith adequate photographic and magical knowledge, permitted\nto test the\n\"\nphenomena\n\"\nproduced by Mr. Hope. Meanwhile\ndesiring in this matter to be scrupulously just we are\nwilling to publish in a later number of the Journal an\naccount of a sitting with Mr. Hope, in which any fraudulent\nmanipulation is considered to be ruled out, provided that the\nevidence appears to us sufficiently good to merit scientific\nconsideration. Eeports submitted must be fully detailed, and\nthe sitters must give some evidence that they possess that\ncombination of photographic knowledge and acquaintance with\nthe principles of deception which is absolutely necessary for\nsuch experiments.\nNOTES ON RECENT PERIODICALS.\nIN the January number of the Journal of the American Society\nfor Psychical Research, Dr. Walter Prince relates some of the\nexperiments that he took part in with the psychometric medium,\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The\nFebruary number of the same Journal contains a posthumous\narticle by Dr. Hyslop on Psychic Phenomena and Christianity,\na review of the recent book by Millais Culpin, and also a notice\nof the Wanderings of a Spiritualist, by Sir A. C. Doyle. Among\nthe Incidents is to be found an interesting account of apparent\ncommunication by means of the Ouija board.\nIn the Revue Metapsychique for January-February Dr. Geley\ncontinues his descriptions of the remarkable series of wax moulds\nof human members obtained through the mediumship of Franek\nKluski. Those readers who are acquainted with the old paraffin\nmould tests will find much to comment upon on inspecting the\nreally extraordinary examples illustrated. Dr. Geley prints the\nopinion of the heads of the firm of Gabrielli, who support him\nin his contention that the moulds could not be manufactured by\nany known normal process. The same issue contains a short\narticle on\n\"\nUn cas presume d'Ideoplastie pendant la gestation.\"\nIt appears that a cat living in a baker's shop in Nice shows upon\nthe fur on its belly the number 1921, the figures resembling those\nprinted upon the sacks in the shop.

Wilhelm\nTordai contributes a survey of the alleged poltergeist phenomena\noccurring at Kecskemet in Hungary, which have many points of\nsimilarity with the manifestations said to have been occurring in\nNova Scotia, which have recently been investigated by the\nAmerican S.P.R.

Prof. J. S. Mackenzie\nbriefly examines Dr. Steiner's theories which are embodied in his\nrecently translated book, The Threefold State. Dr. Steiner is well\nknown, not only as a political theorist, but also as a student of\nthe occult, his Manual of Occult Science being one of the most\nimportant of his contributions in that direction. In the present\narticle Professor Mackenzie does not deal with Dr. Steiner's occult\nteaching, so that the following article on a case of being Pestered\nby a Poltergeist is likely to have greater attractions for the\nstudent of psychic phenomena. In this paper Mr. Nigel Kerr\ndescribes the experiences of his wife and himself in a house in\nItaly where both auditive and tactile phenomena were remarked.\nThe manifestations consisted mainly of footsteps at all hours\ncoupled with the opening of doors and the sensing of unseen\npresences. Mr. Kerr tells his story in a convincing way, but it\nis highly regrettable that the phenomena were not reported at\nthe time, so that some investigation might have been made. The\nphenomena partake rather of the nature of haunting than of\npoltergeist, the] latter term being usually restricted to those cases\nwhere the manifestations consist of the breaking of crockery and\nfurniture, and such like disturbances. Mr. Kerr does not appear\nto have made any direct experiments in order to determine the\nreal character of the noises heard in the house. After his\ndeparture the house remained empty for some time, and then a\nfresh couple moved in, who do not seem to have been disturbed\nas yet by the phenomena which so distracted Mr. Kerr and his\nwife.\nThe same number of the Hibbert contains an article by Mr.\nW. R. Bousfield, in which he endeavours to point out to Mr. Edward\nClodd the errors of his reasoning. Although we congratulate\nMr. Bousfield on the attempt, we fear that Mr. Clodd will not be\nfound open to reason, the credulity of the latter being a barrier\nwhich will prevent him understanding logical argument. It is,\nhowever, amusing to find the weapons of the psycho-analysts\nturned against themselves and the materialistic complex being\ncompared to the spiritualistic complex. We have pointed out\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1022.\nelsewhere how to the leading psycho-analytical practitioner in\nGreat Britain, Dr. Ernest Jones, a belief in telepathy presents itself\nprimarily as a derivative of the flatus complex, and Mr. Bousfield,\nin quoting Dr. Jones's words rightly shows some impatience at\nthese ex cathedra utterances. Just as the spiritualist with\nhis complex refuses to discuss, or denies those facts which run\ncontrary to his beliefs, so does the modern psycho-analyst of\nthe extreme school, by virtue of his complex, refuse to discuss\nthose facts which, if true, are dangerous to his theories. Indeed,\nit is really remarkable how, for instance, the whole of the litera-\nture concerning veridical dreams is passed over in silence, lest\nsome uncomfortable fact should emerge which may cast a doubt\nupon the theory that every dream represents the fulfilment of an\negocentric wish. In the present article Mr. Bousfield examines\nthe more simple statements of Mr. Clodd, and describes some of\nhis own experiments in telepathy, concerning which we should like\nto have further information.\nThe Occult Review for March contains a brief account of taran-\ntism in Madagascar, which will be found of interest to those whose\nstudies have led them to a consideration of the various forms of\ndancing mania found in different parts of world.

Review. 287\nof a psychical laboratory should one ever be formed, yet up to\nthe present time few attempts have been made in the English\n-\nspeaking countries to provide such a department for the purposes\nof psychical research. Stanford University has a properly equipped\nsection for these researches, and a certain amount of experimental\nwork in telepathy has been carried out at Harvard by means of\na fund named in memory of Dr. Richard Hodgson. Apart from\nthese two institutions, the universities of America have done\npractically nothing to encourage research in psychical phenomena,\nand this cannot be surprising when we consider the superior\nattitude adopted by the heads of the psychological departments.\nIn England the position is even worse. Neither Oxford nor\nCambridge has any facilities for research in this field, and although\nthe latter university has now excellent laboratories for experimental\npsychology, psychical research is almost uniformly neglected. In\nFrance the Metapsychical Institute, with its elaborate equipment,\nsupplies the needs of French investigators, whilst in Germany we\nheard nothing of any serious laboratory work until the appearance\nof this little book by Fritz Grunewald. The author describes his\nown experimental rooms, and deals in broad outline with the\napparatus that he has devised for use with mediumistic subjects.\nThe book itself is divided into three main parts. The first deals\nwith mediums and general methods of investigation ;\nthe second\ndescribes the laboratory ;\nwhilst the third illustrates the two\nprevious sections by giving a few practical examples of actual\ninvestigations the author has undertaken. The laboratory itself\nis divided into four sections, including a room which is used\nprincipally as a workshop for constructing the apparatus. In the\nprincipal room is placed the cabinet, a simple affair of black\ncurtains. The medium's chair of wicker work construction is\nplaced within the cabinet mounted upon a weighing board, which\nis used for registering any variation in the weight of the medium.\nThis platform rests upon four spiral springs, which are compressed\nwhen any load rests upon the board. The movements of the\nplatform make electrical connections, the results of which are\nregistered by a mirror galvanometer in another part of the room.\nThe deflections of the needle are further registered by means of a\nbeam of light which falls upon a strip of sensitised paper wound\nupon a revolving drum forming part of the apparatus placed on\na table at the other end of the room opposite the cabinet. For\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.\nthe purpose of weighing any materialised form extruded from the\nmedium a second weighing platform is provided, and this is placed\nin front of the first. The registrations of this second platform\nare also obtained by a mirror galvanometer, the curve being traced\ndirectly beneath that furnished by the medium's platform for the\npurposes of comparison.\nFor table phenomena Grunewald has constructed a special table,\nrather after the model of Comte de Gasparin's. It consists of two\nparts one, a three-legged round-shaped piece of wood screwed to\nthe floor, and the other standing freely upon the fixed base. This\nlatter consists of two circular wooden discs separated from each\nother by three wooden rods, the whole structure including the\nbase being about sixty centimetres high. On the upper piece of\nwood is placed a paper disc so arranged on a central pivot that\nit is\neasily movable. Along the edge of the paper disc are thirty\nholes, from which hang threads which in turn are fastened to six\nshort wooden rods. The table itself is made for three experi-\nmenters only. When these are seated their knees are on a level\nwith the upper wooden disc, their feet being placed beneath the\nbase, which is of such diameter that the feet of the sitters touch\nwhen they are sitting at the table. Each sitter now takes two\nof the wooden rods hanging from the threads and places his hands\non his knees in such a way that they touch the hands of his\nneighbour, and are thus controlled. With this table Grunewald\nclaims to have obtained both tipping and levitation phenomena,\nbut he does not give enough detail to enable the reader to follow\nthe various operations intelligently.\nIn the matter of light Grunewald appears to have made but\nfew experiments. During the greater part of his investigations\nhe employed the usual red illumination, and holds out but poor\nhopes that ultra-violet\n\"\nlight\n\"\nwill ever be of much service in\npsychical research. For raps the author makes use of an ingenious\npiece of apparatus, which it may be of interest to the reader to\ndescribe briefly. It consists essentially of a box closed on all\nsides and surrounded by a practically sound proof shell which\nprevents any normal noise outside from being heard within the\nbox. In the box are three microphones. Two are connected up\nwith two telephone instruments which a couple of the observers\nhokTto their ears. The third microphone is connected to a vibra-\ntion galvanometer, the luminous pointer of which is directed on\n\fMAT, 1922. 289\nto a photographic registering apparatus. A noise which originates\nfrom within the box by means of psychic action is heard simul-\ntaneously by both listeners. Each on hearing the noise presses\nan electric button and produces by means of a\n\"\nwriting magnet\n\"\na time mark on the paper strip of the registering apparatus.\nThe marks of both observers always fall together, thus furnishing\na criterion for the objective character of the noises which must\nhave originated within the box. At the same time the galvano-\nmeter records the vibration curve on the corresponding revolving\npaper strip. The correspondence of the beginning of this curve\nwith the marks made by the two observers furnishes a further\nproof of the objective factor. The \"writing magnet\" (Schreib-\nmagnet) mentioned above is a little piece of apparatus for which\nGrunewald finds a multitude of uses. It comprises a tube which\nis mounted on an adjustable arm springing from an upright rod.\nWithin the tube is a small electro-bar magnet, which, when excited\nby an electric current, attracts and thus moves a keeper on which\nis fastened a small mirror. A beam of light reflected from this\nmirror, and thence on to a revolving drum of photographic paper,\ncan thus be made to act as a time recorder, the mere pressing\nof a button being sufficient to cause deviation in the line traced\nout on the moving sensitised paper strip.\nAnother interesting field of inquiry into which Grunewald has\npenetrated a few steps is the investigation of mediumistic lights\nby means of the spectroscope. His results are not yet complete\nnor are his experiments on the chemical nature of these lights.\nIt is, however, remarkable that in the course of his investigations,\nGrunewald constantly noticed the smell of phosphorus, which was\nsimilarly noticed in the case of Stainton Moses and also, under\nexcellent conditions, with \"Miss Burton. Further experiments in\nthis direction might yield valuable results, as also might an\ninvestigation into the alleged magnetism of human subjects. The\nauthor here details his own experiments in this direction with the\nhelp of some rather complicated apparatus, and it would be desir-\nable to check some of his results under varying conditions. The\nmain difficulty in all these investigations is the deplorable lack\nof funds which holds up research in all the English-speaking\ncountries.

Yet what this single investigator has been\nable to do in his own laboratory and for his own satisfaction, the\nEnglish and American Societies for Psychical Research are unable\nto do because the required financial assistance is not forthcoming.\nIt is hoped that the publication of this book will do something\ntowards furthering scientific methods in the observation and\ninvestigation of alleged supernormal phenomena. The book\ndeserves a wide circulation, and although it is unlikely to have\nany attractions for convinced spiritualists or materialists, it can\nhardly fail to rouse the interest and enthusiasm of those whose\nbusiness it is to study in detail the physical phenomena of\nspiritualism. E. J. DINGWALL.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. ON \"\nTHE Modus Operandi IN SO-CALLED MEDIUMISTIC\nTRANCE.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, In the last issue of the Journal Mr. W. S. Irving\nwrites an interesting letter commenting upon the suggestion\ntentatively put forward by me in my recent paper in Proceedings,\nthat the purporting Personal Controls occurring during Mrs.\nLeonard's Trance might represent a deeper hypnotic level than\nthat which obtains during a Feda Control. He advances the\nhypothesis based upon his study of The Doris Fischer Case and\nof Doctor Mitchell's Paper thereon, that were this the case Feda\nshould be expected to know nothing of what occurs during a\nPersonal Control, whereas the Personal Control should have access\nto all Feda material. This latter is, in my experience and that\nof Miss RadclyfEe-Hall, invariably the case; and as regards the\nexample quoted by Mr. Irving of knowledge shown by Feda of\nPersonal Control utterances, I have not at this moment access to\nthe Doris Fischer Case, all my reference books being in storage;\nbut as far as my memory serves me, I do not think it was ever\nreally established that Margaret in that case constituted a deeper\nhypnotic level than Sick Doris. Were there not indeed indications\nto the contrary ? And yet upon occasion did not Margaret make\ngood her claim to knowledge of Sick Doris's experiences ? Be\nthis how it may, we might, I think, perhaps regard the very\noccasional and fragmentary knowledge shown by Feda of the\n\fMAY, 1922. Correspondence 291\nPersonal Control material as some unusual and momentary shifting\nof the levels which gives Feda, for an instant only, access to\nmaterial which is generally outside her purview. My own experi-\nence is that the A.V.B. Personal Control (which in our present\nSitting occupies far the greater part of the trance), constantly\nclaims that she does so because she desires to mention to us\nmatters connected with personal affairs, or regarding other people,\nor the medium's business, of which it is advisable that Feda\nshould remain in ignorance.\nMight not the occasional knowledge shown by Feda of Personal\nControl material be acquired by her telepathically or otherwise,\nduring the periods when she herself governs the organism ? She\nmight conceivably, for instance, while giving her own interpretations\nof D.G.I.'s evidence, during the Feda part of the Sitting, have\nreceived the impression regarding\n\"\nPeople whom she didn't\nwant,\" and have been unable to voice it, while knowing that it\nhad been received by the medium's brain and would presently\nemerge. Or again, during her brief return after the Personal\nControl, she might possibly have found traces of the recently\nuttered material lurking in the medium's mind. Mrs. Leonard\nhas told us that very occasionally she will find a fragmentary\nmemory of the recent Sitting recurring to her even after she *\nhas\nresumed the normal state.\nI am very glad that Mr. Irving has added his valuable testi-\nmony to mine and that of Miss Radclyffe-Hall anent the personal\ncharacteristics of the departed observable in the Leonard Personal\nControls.\nAn answer from me is overdue to Colonel C. E. Baddeley,\nwho has raised some very interesting points in the March Journal\nregarding my Paper. If I have delayed in replying, I feel sure\nthat Colonel Baddeley will forgive me, and accept my assurance\nthat my answer will be forthcoming very shortly. I must for\nthe purpose, however, await the unpacking of my reference books,\nwithout which I cannot adequately deal with all that he has\nsaid. UNA VINCENZO TROUBRIDGE.\nII.

JUNE, 1922.\nTHE CASE OF MISS NANCY SINCLAIE.\nEDITOEIAL NOTE.\nThe writer of the report which we print below has been for\nseveral years a Member of the Society and is personally known\nto some of the Society's officers. Since the lady who is the\nsubject of the experiments described in this report, here called Miss\nSinclair, does not wish for the present at any rate to disclose\nher identity, it seemed best that the experimenter's name should\nalso be withheld, and he will be referred to here as Mr. T .\nThe case appears to be one of considerable interest to psychical\nresearch and if the experiments can be continued, it should afford\nan unusually good opportunity of studying various states of\nmental dissociation and the supernormal phenomena which ap-\nparently accompany them. It must be understood as Mr. T\nhimself clearly recognises that the present statement of the case\nis only to be regarded as a preliminary report, indicating the\ngeneral nature of the case and of the phenomena which prima\nfacie characterise it. Some of these phenomena in particular\nthose described on pp. 321 ff. are of such a remarkable and\nso far inexplicable nature that obviously no certain conclusions\ncan be drawn, until it has been found possible to repeat the ex-\nperiments. The difficulties which these experiments present and the\nimportance of conducting them in such a way as not to overstrain\nMiss Sinclair will be apparent from Mr. T *s statement.\nTo whatever conclusions Mr. T or other observers may\nfinally come, the case undoubtedly presents abnormal features\nwell worth careful study, and as such we print it here.\nIt is only necessary to add that Mr. T - has shown himself\nin other investigations which he has undertaken for the Society,\na careful and competent observer, and his bona fides, and that\nof his wife, a witness to some of the phenomena, is to all who\nknow them\nME. T 'S EEPOET.\nPART I. GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE CASE.\nTHE sensitive whose trance-phenomena I am about to describe,\nand whom I will call Miss Nancy Sinclair, has been known\n\fj i NK. I'.'-'i'. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 295\nintimately to my wife and to myself for the past seven\nyears. She seems to have possessed her supernormal faculties\nall her life, but has kept her knowledge of them so very\nmuch to herself, that, until recently, no one suspected their\n-existence.\nAll through her childhood, she says, she used to have\npremonitions, flashes of spontaneous telepathy, and the faculty\nof finding lost articles, and also occasional periods of analgesia,\nbut, growing up accustomed to these things, she does not\nappear to have realised that other people did not have them\nalso. When she spoke of these things at home, the sisterly\nridicule which they evoked had the effect of making her\nextremely reticent on these matters, and that is probably why\nher gifts were not discovered until after the war. She did her\nfirst piece of automatic writing at my wife's instigation in\nNovember, 1919, with the result that she went into a light\nstage of trance. After that she produced a small amount of\nautomatic writing in the normal state, the outcome of which\nwas a decision that she should make a serious attempt to\ndevelop her powers by holding regular sittings under my 'super-\nvision. These sittings were begun in February, 1921, but\nwere broken off for a period of six months at the end of\nMarch, after which they were resumed in October, 1921, and\nhave been carried on with more or less regularity up to the\npresent time.\nMiss Sinclair has never held sittings with anyone except\nourselves. She is not, and never has been, interested in\nSpiritualism, and since she did not at first appreciate the point\nof view of scientific psychical enquiry, I think we owe her a\ngreat debt of gratitude for the time and trouble which she\nhas freely given to a work from which she had nothing to\ngain, and which has often been distasteful to her. Moreover,\nshe has frequently had to put up with headaches, and other\nphysical disabilities which have resulted from over-strain, and\nfrom unavoidable disturbances during trance.\nIt is hardly necessary for me to say that the idea of any\nsort of conscious fraud on Miss Sinclair's part is absolutely\nabsurd to anyone who knows her. Also, from her own point\nof view, it would be more to her interest to minimise rather\nthan to exaggerate her evidential material, so as to make out\nA2\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.\nthat her powers were not after all worth developing, and there-\nfore that she need not be bothered with them.\nIt is my purpose in the first part of this account to give\na general description of the types of evidential material which\nMiss Sinclair produces, and of the various states in which she\nproduces them, and not to deal with the evidence itself except\nin so far as that is necessary for descriptive purposes. In\nthe second part I have dealt with some of the evidential\nmaterial. Miss Sinclair's good faith does not, in the general\naccount, enter into the question except where her statements\nabout her subjective experiences are concerned, and it is\nto be understood that the cases which I introduce in Part I.\nare for illustrative purposes only, and it is not claimed that\nthey necessarily come up to the best evidential standards.\nMiss Sinclair's psychical powers are as yet only partially\ndeveloped, owing to the short time during which she has held\nregular sittings. Should she be able to continue the work,,\nmuch fuller results should await us in the future.\nI have put down the various states in which evidential\nmatter is produced, as far as possible in order of their departure\nfrom the normal, but as far as I have been able to observe,\nthere is no clear line of demarcation between one state and\nanother, and in particular I have been struck by the imper-\nceptible gradation with which the normal condition passes into\nthat of light trance.\nTelepathy.\nI begin with the few trivial instances of telepathy which\nhave occurred, because the production of these does not appear\nto involve any change from the normal state. It is to me a\nmatter of surprise that telepathy should be such a subordinate\nfeature in Miss Sinclair's evidential phenomena.\nThe few definite experiments I have tried have usually\nproved failures, or partial failures, whereas the small successes\nhave been apparently accidental, and have occurred when her\nmind was occupied with matters other than her psychical\nwork. The inference seems to be that it is essential for\nsuccess that the sensitive should not have in her mind the\nknowledge that a telepathic experiment is being tried. The\n\fJINK, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 297\nmoment her attention is directed to this fact, she is unable\nto prevent supraliminal guessing from displacing the slowly-\nrising subliminal idea. Thus, I have often asked her to name\nthe object I was thinking of, but she has invariably failed.\nI have also, on various occasions, tried to get telepathic\nresults during trance sittings for automatic writing, holding in\nmy hand a letter of the alphabet printed on a small card,\nwhich I had previously looked at, and on which I was con-\ncentrating my attention. These experiments have all been\nfailures, as have also my attempts to influence telepathically\nher crystal visions.\nOn the other hand, when the sensitive is engaged in the\nordinary occupations of life, telepathy seems sometimes to occur\nspontaneously, although the very nature of the conditions\nunder which it occurs renders it impossible to estimate the\nevidential value of each case.\nOften when I come into the room where Miss Sinclair is,\nto look for something, she fetches the object in question, and\nhands it to me without a word having been spoken by either\nof us. She once sent someone to find me in the garden,\ntelling them the exact spot where I was standing, a spot far\nout of sight from the house.\nThe following is almost the only definite successful case of\ntelepathy which has occurred, if indeed it is not to be explained\nby chance. (I am omitting cases which might be explained\nclairvoyantly in view of the evidence for clairvoyance which\nthe present case has supplied.)\nOn Sunday, December 11, 1921, the rector of C -\nspoke\nto my wife outside the Church, and the same afternoon she\nsent a note by post asking him to come to tea on the following\nTuesday or Wednesday. As there was no post out till Monday,\nhe could not get this note till Tuesday morning. At 2 p.m.\non Monday, December 12, 1921, Miss Sinclair wrote,\n\"\nI think\nthe parson of C -\nwill come to tea to-day.\" He actually\ncame on Monday at 4.15 p.m., and it was ascertained that he\nhad not received the note. This case, it will be noticed, was\nquite spontaneous.\n\"\nImpressions\"\nA good deal of the evidential material which Miss Sinclair\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1022.\nlias produced lias risen to the surface of consciousness in the\nform of\n\"\nimpressions.\" These impressions often occur when\nshe is in the normal state ; they rise up, and are spoken,\ngenerally in rather a fragmentary way, as if\nthey were difficult\nto capture and express. They vary both in form and intensity.\nSometimes they are merely vague warnings not to do something\nor impulses to do something, but at other times they are\nperfectly definite messages. Not infrequently they refer to\nfuture events. I have reason to believe that impressions are\nvery frequently, if not almost continuously, making their way,\nas it were, into the fringe of her supraliminal consciousness,\nbut most of them are too faint to attain expression. These\nimpressions are evidently very difficult to grasp ; they easily\nslip away and are forgotten, and it is only the most vivid\nwhich are finally translated into words. Eecently she has\nsucceeded in writing down some of her impressions, and I\nthink this writing down involves a slight departure from the\nnormal state of consciousness, for the slightest disturbance\nduring the writing will cause the remainder of the impression\nto be lost. Also, the impressions once written, she immediately\nforgets them, and even forgets the fact of having written them.\nOn more than one occasion, evidence has been spoilt owing to\nthis amnesia, Miss Sinclair having predicted in writing the\noccurrence of some small event, and having omitted, or been\nunable, to give me the paper on which it was written until\nafter the fulfilment of the event.\nThese impressions, however, are not written in a\nstate of trance. The handwriting is the sensitive's habi-\ntual writing, and not the scrawl of the trance-script, but the\nstate in which they are written is, I think, bordering on\ntrance.\nI will give an illustration of an impression which was in\nitself very powerful, but in form no more than a vague\nimpulse, which occurred on April 22, 1921. Miss Sinclair had\njust recovered from an illness. The impression took the form\nof a warning bidding her not to go for a ride on her bicycle\non the following day. She was rather looking forward to\ngoing out on her bicycle again, and, not wishing to be too\nmuch governed by her impressions, she resisted the warning,\nand went. The result was that she nearly collided with a\n\fJIM:, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 291)\nmotor-lorry at a corner, and in avoiding it fell off the bicycle\nand displaced her knee-cap.\nA rather interesting instance of a similar impression occurred\non May 7, 1921. It was a Saturday, and we were packing\nup to leave our house on the following Monday. Miss Sinclair\nhad come over the day before, and was to leave again on\nSaturday by the 5.55 train. On her way to the station, she\nbecame very undecided : she walked more and more slowly,\nalthough there was barely time to catch the train, and told\nme that she had an impulse bidding her to go back.\nThis case shows rather clearly the persuasive power of the\nsubliminal impulse, for Miss Sinclair was, as far as her supra-\nliminal consciousness was concerned, obviously anxious to\ncontinue her journey. There was no visible reason why she\nshould return, and in our half packed-up state, it was incon-\nvenient for us to put her up. Also she would be obliged to\nleave rather early the next morning, and travel by a slow\nSunday train. For some seconds she stood still under the\ninfluence of two absolutely conflicting states of consciousness ;\nthen remarking that she did not in the least want to stay\nanother night in the place, nevertheless turned and went back\nto the house. The sequel to this incident occurred later in\nthe same evening, when my wife missed a much-valued watch\nand seal. After we had all engaged in a prolonged and fruit-\nless search, Miss Sinclair, in my wife's presence, suddenly\nopened a trunk, and, without looking, plunged her hand into\na cardboard box of odds-and-ends which was in the trunk,\nand pulled out the case containing the watch and seal. My\nwife admits that she would never have thought of looking in\nthat box, as she regarded it as quite an impossible place\nfor the watch to be in. Miss Sinclair therefore, by her\nreturn, undoubtedly saved my wife a good deal of worry and\nannoyance.\nImpressions of this kind are probably similar to the warnings\nor promptings which I believe some people experience vaguely\nin their daily life, only in the case of Miss Sinclair they are\nmuch more powerful.\nThe following case, however, illustrates an impression which\ntook the form of a clear message. On September 17, 1921,\nwhile Miss Sinclair and I were standing in the same room,\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1022.\nshe said to me suddenly,\n\"\nI have an impression that there is\na telegram coming from Mrs. T .\" About two minutes\nlater there was a knock at the door, and the telegraph girl\ndelivered, not a telegram, but an express letter from my wife.\nFrom the room where we were standing it was impossible to\nsee anyone approaching the house, even after they had reached\nthe door, and Miss Sinclair told me her impression too long\nbefore the arrival of the girl for her footsteps to have been\naudible. In addition to this, a gale of wind was blowing at\nthe time, and making so much noise that it would have\neffectually drowned the sound of footsteps even close outside\nthe door.\nAnother feature of the impressions which leads me to classify\nthem with evidential matter occurring nearly in the normal\nstate is the\n\"\nunpsychic\n\"\ntimes at which they are often\nproduced. It is a consistent feature of Miss Sinclair's sensi-\ntivity that she becomes\n\"\npsychic\n\"\nat about six p.m., and\nremains so during the evening, the degree of sensitiveness\nvarying, of course, from one day to another, but the period\nof maximum sensitiveness is, as a rule, between six and eight\np.m. (She rarely goes into trance except in the evenings.)\nImpressions, however, are frequently uttered in the mornings,\nor at any time during the day.\nThe emergence of an impression is evidently the last stage\nin the uprising of an idea from the subliminal depths through\nthe various strata of consciousness, for it often happens that\nan incident which has been expressed in the trance script\nemerges several days later, generally in a fragmentary way\nas an impression. This occurred, for instance, in the clair-\nvoyant discovery of a brooch which had been lost and buried\nin the soil. The brooch was described and drawn in trance\nscript on August 28, 1921, and then described to me by Miss\nSinclair as a piece of interesting news, from an impression\nwhich came in two parts on September 15, 1921. (Amnesia\nafter trance is always complete.)\nI am bound to admit, however, that it is difficult to draw\na definite line between the state in which the sensitive writes\nher impression and the clairvoyant state. This latter is\ncertainly a definite departure from the normal. It is a state\nin which she is sometimes able to express by word of mouth\n\fJUNE, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 301\nthings (such as unseen cards in a shuffled pack) which would\notherwise only emerge in trance.\nIndications are constantly occurring of impressions which are\ntoo vague for expression, and of which no doubt Miss Sinclair\nis vaguely conscious when they first occur, but which do not\n-emerge into full consciousness until evoked by the fulfilment\nof the incident. A particular remark, or a small household\naccident, for instance, sometimes causes her to go into a fit\nof laughter, and say,\n\"\nI knew that was going to happen\n\"\n;\nbut the foreknowledge was so vague that she was unable to\nexpress it, and was herself, I think, barely conscious of it\nuntil fulfilment brought a memory that was stronger than the\ninitial impression. Since there is in these cases no real evidence\nof precognition, they may be explained as cases of false recog-\nnition, but, for myself, I doubt this explanation, in view of\nother precognitive cases which have been written down prior\nto their occurrence.\nThe difficulty of bringing out an impression, even when it is\nquite clearly in the sensitive's mind, is illustrated by the\nfollowing instance :\nI was one day starting out to fetch the newspaper from the\nneighbouring village, where it is left for us by the motor-\nomnibus. Miss Sinclair was in another house close by, but\nknew that I was going to fetch the paper, and also had an\nimpression that it was important for evidential reasons con-\nnected with a case she was then producing, that none of us\nshould see the paper that afternoon. She came and stood by\nthe gate as I was leaving, fully intending to stop me, yet\nunable to do more than make some ordinary remark. Just\nas I was returning she again came out to meet me, badly\nwanting to tell me that I must put the paper away without\nopening it, but was again unable to do more than speak about\nsomething quite irrelevant. The result was that the evidence\nfor one of her clairvoyant cases was partially spoilt.\nAnalgesic and Anaesthetic State.\nI had been for some time aware that analgesia accompanied\nat any rate the light stage of trance, and probably the deeper\nstages also. On December 10, 1921, I discovered that in the\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.\nanalgesic state there is also insensibility to contact, and also\nthat the analgesia and insensibility spread over the border state\nbetween trance and waking to a point in which Miss Sinclair\nis, to all appearances, fully awake.\nOn evenings when the analgesia is pronounced, she cannot\nfeel deep pricks with a needle. She will seize things without\nany discomfort, which are too hot for anyone else to hold,\nand I have seen her rashly take hold of the chimney of a\nlighted oil lamp, and feel nothing at the time, though blisters\nresulted next morning. On evenings such as these, she goes\non doing things as usual, although she practically cannot feel\nat all. She can thread a needle, do needlework, in fact she\nis able to\n\"\ncarry on\n\"\nso very much in the ordinary way that\nuntil quite recently no one ever suspected that she has what\nshe calls\n\"\nnon-feeling\n\"\nevenings, and this in spite of the fact\nthat she has had them from childhood. They are in no way\nthe outcome of the development of her psychic gifts.\nSince the development of her sensitive faculties, anaesthetic\nevenings have become much more frequent.\nEverything that she does at these times is done by sight\nalone. This I discovered by testing her with a reel of\ncotton. When the reel was on the table in front of her, and\nshe could see it, she had no difficulty in picking it up, but\nwhen I put it on the floor under the table, and she had to\ngrope for it, without being able to see it, she rolled it about\nunder her hand without being able to feel or grasp it, and\nwhen I pretended to put the reel in her hand, she could not\ntell without looking whether it was really there or not.\nIf, when she was standing up, I gave her a push in the back,\nshe had the curious experience of seeing herself move forward\nwithout feeling the cause.\nShe cannot, in this state, move her fingers rapidly back-\nwards and forwards without looking at them. When she tries\nto do this with her hand behind her, with the utmost effort\nthat she can make, the hand will only give a kind of con-\nvulsive grasp. It would seem that, in the absence of sight,\nthe reactive sensations from the moving fingers are necessary\nto supply information as to how they should be moved from\nmoment to moment. The same applies to other muscles of\nthe body, so that she can scarcely move in complete darkness.\n\f1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 80-'J\nI am inclined to think that the sight of objects does bring\ninto existence an hallucinatory sense of resistance from contact\nwith them. Miss Sinclair, when in this analgesic condition,\nwalks by sight, but I think that, to some extent, she has a\nfalse sense of feeling the reaction of the ground on her feet,\nso long as she can see it. In a darkened room she is unable\nto take a single step, and she says that it is a most alarming\nexperience to try to move at all in complete darkness.\nOn several occasions, she has said to me in the evenings,\nthat she has had an extraordinary feeling of lightness, and,\nat the time, I had wondered what could cause it. It was\nundoubtedly due to the absence, or partial absence, of the\nsensation of the pressure of the ground on the soles of her\nfeet. When walking out of doors on a windy night in this\nstate, she can hear the wind in her ears, but cannot feel it\non her face. Sometimes she will stamp hard on the ground,\nand say she can just feel that.\nI think the insensitiveness extends to the internal, as well\nas to the peripheral, organs of the body ;\nit does at any rate\nto the muscular sense, since she says an object feels lighter\nto lift at\n\"\nnon-feeling\n\"\ntimes. A headache also disappears,\nbut a feeling of general tiredness and exhaustion is still present.\nPerhaps more sensation is left in the mouth than elsewhere,\nfor she told me that she could just feel biting her tongue\nwhen she was insensitive to everything else that I tried. She\ndoes not eat much on evenings when these symptoms are\npronounced, as eating is naturally rather difficult, and also\nunsatisfactory for the reason that the sense of taste diminishes\nwith that of feeling. Miss Sinclair regards it as pure waste\nto eat chocolates in a\n\"\nnon-feeling\n\"\nstate.\nThe sense of smell seems to vary as that of taste, as far\nas I know at present, while that of hearing (I think) remains\nunaffected, but a certain degree of hyperaesthesia of the\nsense of vision is present, apparently as a natural compensation\nfor the loss of the sense of touch. Miss Sinclair says that on\n\"\nnon-feeling\n\"\nevenings everything appears to her about twice\nas bright as at other times, and she can see correspondingly\nbetter in partial darkness.\nIt is to be understood that all the above phenomena admit\nof variations of degree. On some evenings, for instance, she\nA3\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.\ncan feel a severe prick with a needle slightly, and can just\nfeel the pressure if her hand is squeezed very hard. On\nothers again the symptoms may scarcely be present at all.\nThe above observations are admittedly rough, and it yet\nremains to make more exact experiments.\nThe Clairvoyant State.\nDuring October, 1921, Miss Sinclair had begun to take a\ncertain amount of interest in cards from a psychical stand-\npoint, as a result of the unusual success she seemed to attain\nin certain games. She thought this success was due to her\nknowing the denominations of some of the cards while they\nwere still lying face downwards on the table. This led to her\ntrying the experiment of naming, or guessing, the cards one\nby one in a shuffled pack, before turning them up. In this,\nhowever, when tried as an experiment, she had no more\nsuccess than chance would account for, but she discovered\nthat, if she could distract her supraliminal consciousness by\nreading a book, while at the same time idly turning the cards,\nshe could get into a psychic condition, which I here call the\n\"\nClairvoyant State,\" in which she could, and did, according\nto her own statement, on several occasions get about forty\ncards right out of the pack. It is to be understood that only\nthe denominations of the cards came to her, and that she did\nnot say them aloud before turning the cards up, but only\nthought them to herself. She can never get the suit, and she\nhas always been shaky on court cards. The reason for this is\nthat she does not as a rule see a mental image of the card,\nbut a rather shadowy Arabic numeral which indicates its\nvalue. In the case of court cards, however, I gather from her\ndescription that she does see an image of the card, or something\nlike it.\nThis clairvoyant state appears to be differentiated from the\nwaking state, for Miss Sinclair, although to all appearances\nawake, if a little passive, finds great difficulty in speaking\nwhen she is in it. On one occasion, when I was reading in\nthe same room, and at a short distance from her, she wanted\nto tell me to come and look at the cards she was turning,\nbut was unable to do so. Also any attempt to write while\n\fJCNK, H)22. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 305\n_\nin this state immediately induces trance, the writing merging\ninto trance-script.\nOn the other hand it differs from light trance, in which the\npersonality undergoes a certain change of tone and outlook,\nnot observable in the clairvoyant state ; nevertheless, there\nseems but a slight step from the one condition to the other.\nAnother point of difference is that Miss Sinclair can move\nabout and do things when in the clairvoyant state, but not\nwhen she is in trance.\nThe same interesting point which was noticed in connection\nwith the impressions comes out again here, but more clearly,\nviz. the fact that the supernormally acquired idea can only\nbe expressed with great difficulty and effort, if at all, while\nit may be clearly present to the consciousness. In the\nin which Miss Sinclair turned up the cards from a pack,\nof course I urged her to tell me the card before turning it.\nAlthough she tried very hard to do so, for some time she\nfound it impossible. She would say,\n\"\nI can see the card, but\nI can't tell you what it is,\" and she compared the feeling to\nthat of listening to someone speaking in a foreign language,\nand being able to understand, but not being able to find the\nwords in her mind with which to frame an answer. After\nsome practice, however, she was able by making a great effort\nto get out the denominations of four or five of the cards.\nShe had to get herself into a state of great tension, and the\nnumber, when it came, was uttered explosively, as it\nmight be\nby someone who was making a great muscular effort. After\ngiving four or five cards she was usually exhausted, but I\nthink it quite likely that with practice this effort might be\nreduced, and the number of cards extended.\nThere does not seem to be much object in endeavouring to\nobtain a long series of cards, as the probability of getting even\na very small number in sequence correct by chance is so ex-\ntremely small that chance is easily excluded.\nThere is another feature of the mode in which these clair-\nvoyant perceptions emerge which is worthy of notice, and this\nfeature is shared also by the trance-script, and by the\nimpressions, and as far as I know by all subliminally perceived\nideas. Miss Sinclair is obliged to sort out the constituent\nparts of the idea, and set them in order before expressing\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1922.\nthem. Sometimes she inverts the order of two cards in the\npack. When doing automatic writing she explains that the\ncause of the writing being so slow is that she has to arrange\nthe words in their proper sequence, having apparently got\nan impression of them all at once. She does not seem to\nget the parts of a subliminal idea in sequence in time, but\nsimultaneously.\nLight Trance.\nWhen Miss Sinclair sits down to do automatic writing, she\nfirst of all passes into a state of light trance. I think this\nlight trance is always under the control of her own will,\nthough when she is exhausted with too much psychical activity,\nor by a combination of psychical and physical tiredness, she\nslips into this state very easily, and finds it difficult to keep\nout of it. When she intends to go into trance, the fact of\nholding a pencil in her hand on a sheet of paper is sufficient\nto induce it in three or four minutes as a rule. She says she\nsimply lets herself go, and her surroundings, the room and the\npeople in it, get smaller and smaller as she passes into trance.\nShe is able to describe the sensation whilst it is taking place,\nand under ordinary conditions she says it is not unpleasant.\nWhen in light trance she still speaks in her usual voice,\nonly with some difficulty and hesitation, but she can carry\non a conversation. The change in her appearance is very\nslight. There is an enlargement of the pupil of the eye, and\na restless movement of the eyes even when closed, as can be\nseen by the slight bulge which the iris causes in the eyelid,\nbut these symptoms are not very marked. In a dim light\none would not know, and Miss Sinclair sometimes informs me\nof the fact by saying, \"I am in light trance now, I want to\ntell you so-and-so.\" There is a change in her manner and\nmode of speaking, which becomes more childlike. When in\nlight trance she says she is unable to perceive her surroundings.\nShe fails to recognise anyone except my wife and myself, and\nI have asked her whether she sees me, since she seems to look\nat me, but her answer is,\n\"\nOh, I know you're there.\" When\nI ask her what she sees in light trance, she says everything\nis misty. She knows more about her psychical work in light\ntrance than she does when waking, and frequently tells me\n\fJIM:, !!>. The (7a.se\nof Miss Nancy Sinclair. 307\nthings that are going to happen with regard to it, which, I\nhave found, generally turn out as she says. I do not mean\nreally precognitive statements, but statements of things that\nshe herself is going to do or say. Her outlook too is different,\nbeing much more stable and consistently interested in her\npsychical work than when she is awake. If over-tired, etc.,\nMiss Sinclair, if I may say so, sometimes gets rather tired\nand disgusted with her psychical work. At these times her\nittitude changes completely when she enters light trance ;\nshe\nlikes being in trance then, and proceeds to take a much rosier\nview of things.\nThe analgesia which I have before described is also a feature\nof light trance, and I will quote the following experiment to\nillustrate it.\nOn the evening of September 22, 1921, after dusk, Miss\nSinclair went into light trance, and I thought I would test\nher degree of analgesia by giving her a really deep prick with\na needle. I therefore took a large darning needle, and pressed\nit into the side of her hand above the little finger for nearly\na quarter of an inch. She felt nothing, and merely asked\nrather scornfully if I supposed she could feel that. The next\nmorning she came to me and said she had got a thorn in her\nhand, and asked me if I could get it out. I knew then that\nI must have been clumsy enough to break the point of the\nneedle in her hand the night before. The flesh had closed\nover the piece of needle, and she seemed so sensitive to pain\nthat I resolved to postpone the attempt to extract it until\nshe went into trance. (Miss Sinclair says that in the normal\nstate she is more sensitive to pain than other people.) At\nthe next writing sitting, the script said that the needle must\nbe removed, or it would go further in ;\nalso that its presence\nworried her, and interfered with her psychical work. It was\ninteresting that the script referred to it as a needle, for in\nthe waking state she still continued to believe it was a thorn.\nOn the following day she went into trance for the purpose\nof having the needle removed. I made quite a deep incision\nwith a sharp instrument, and probed for the piece of needle,\nbut without being able to find it. However, I bound up the\nhand, and by the next morning the piece of needle had come\nout on the lint of its own accord, and the wound then healed\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.\nquickly. She had felt absolutely nothing of the clumsy\noperation I had performed on her, and even when the needle\nwas out she still continued to believe it was a thorn.\nAs far as I have been able to ascertain up to the present,\nMiss Sinclair when in light trance knows nothing of what\noccurs in the deeper stages. Her memory is bounded by\ndeeper trance on one side, while on the other it extends over\nthe analgesic state before described, to the borders of the\nwaking memory. One day she walked with me to the neigh-\nbouring town, and we returned in the evening by the motor-\nomnibus. At about 5 p.m. (her psychic time was beginning\nrather early just then), whilst we were in the bus, she entered\nthe analgesic state, and also began to note down one of her\nimpressions. The next evening, while she was in light trance,\nI asked her if she could remember what she had done the day\nbefore. She said she could remember vaguely having gone\nsomewhere, but could not remember the name of the place,\nbut could remember returning in the motor-bus, and writing\nher impression in it ;\nthat is to say, her memory began from\nthe point where she had entered the analgesic state.\nOn another analgesic evening, she suddenly mentioned having\nbroken a particular dish quite six years ago, and this my\nwife dimly remembered to have been the case. Miss Sinclair\nsaid that when she broke it she was in a\n\"\nnon-feeling\n\"\nstate, and that was why she remembered it on this occasion.\nIn the normal state she had no recollection of it.\nWhen she is in the analgesic state her memory does not\nextend to light trance. It covers the analgesic state itself\n(for which it is\nparticularly good), and also most of the\nmemories of the waking state. I think that as her condition\nchanges, moving through the border state, and on into the\ntrance proper, the upper and lower limits of the memory move\nwith it towards the trance.\nWriting Trance.\nDuring writing sittings the sensitive passes rapidly through\na short initial period of light trance into the deeper stage in\nwhich she writes. The pencil at first meanders slowly about,\nmaking meaningless scribbles, then it begins a more purposeful\n\fJUNK, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 309\nand legible though still scrawly writing, her expression becomes\nmore absent, and she does not smile, but she still speaks\noccasionally in her ordinary voice, generally in explanation of\nsome point in the writing. Speaking, however, appears to be\na somewhat difficult process, and she is sparing of words.\nIf the sitter asks her a question, she either ignores it or\nelse pauses, and looks round over her shoulder, as if referring\nto some unseen person for information, after which she proceeds\nto write the answer in the script. This gesture is repeated\nalso from time to time during the writing, without any question\nbeing asked.\nThe legible writing is not continuous, but is interspersed\nwith periods of scribbling, and it is possible that these two\nphases correspond to two distinct stages of trance. The\nwriter of the script says that some scribbling is inevitable at\nan early stage in the development, and evidently expects it\nto disappear later on. The writing is produced very slowly.\nAt normal times, when Miss Sinclair is well and not over-\ntired, the passage into and out of writing trance is quite rapid\nand easy, and after the trance she has only to sit still for\na few minutes to feel quite herself again, but during some\nof the earlier sittings the process took longer, and amnesia on\nwaking was not complete. This had the curious result of\ngiving her the feeling that the room in which she held her\nsittings was uncanny. She thought of it as full of spirits,\nand these spirits were apparently semi-transparent beings only\na few inches high, and provided with wings, with which they\nflew ceaselessly round and round her. She admitted that they\nhad pleasant faces, but her ground of objection to them was\nthat it was unnatural and uncanny that they should intrude\nthemselves (as she conceived they did) into the waking world,\nwhere they did not belong. After the first few sittings, the\nbreak of memory on returning to consciousness after the trance\nbecame complete, and all idea of there being anything un-\ncanny about it disappeared. Exhaustion or ill health has the\neffect of making the return to consciousness more difficult and\nslower than it is at other times, and this may give rise to an\nunpleasant and rather terrifying experience for the sensitive,\nwho is left for a time with vision only partially restored, and\nfeeling entirely absent, and naturally wonders where she is and\n\f3 1 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.\nwhat is happening to her. The experience must be terribly\nbewildering, and it is small wonder that at such times Miss\nSinclair has a horror of trance sittings.\nDuring the writing trance the very smallest sounds are dis-\nturbing and apt to interrupt the script, and a sudden noise\nis likely to be disastrous in its effect, as it awakens the\nsensitive with a start, and produces a nervous shock from\nwhich it may take her a month to recover. After receiving\na shock of this kind, great courage is required on her part\nto embark on the next writing sitting, for the trance only\ncomes on with difficulty, and the feeling is then, as described\nby her, like that of letting oneself slip down alone into a\ndark place ;\nbut when the first sitting is over, she does not\nmind the subsequent ones. The results of a shock manifest\nthemselves in nervous symptoms, which are pronounced at\nthe\n\"\npsychic\n\"\ntimes (6 to 8 p.m.), including sometimes fits\nof trembling and signs of nervous over-tension, and there is\nalso a strong tendency to relapse into trance during the evening\nand in the night. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance\nthat conditions of complete silence should obtain for the\nwriting sittings, and it is very unfortunate that these con-\nditions should be so difficult to obtain. Sittings are always\nheld in the evenings, and the time is carefully chosen when\ndisturbances are least likely every door and window has to\nbe carefully fastened, and sometimes a sentry has to be posted\noutside the house to intercept possible callers. Even then\nthe discharge of a gun some distance away, a sudden gust of\nwind, or a dozen small noises over which one has no control,\nmay upset the sensitive to a greater or less extent. The only\nreal solution to the difficulty would be a sound-proof room.\nIt will be seen that the writing sittings in Miss Sinclair's\ncase are rather an anxious business, and this, in addition to\nmy desire not to interfere with the production of the script,\nis the reason why I have not made more experiments with her\nphysical condition. There is, I think, hyperaesthesia of the\nauditory sense, but it may also be that noises, without being in\nthemselves intensified, produce a very worrying effect when\nthe attention is strained on the work of producing the script,\nas indeed they do in ordinary life, when one is thinking\nintently. When Miss Sinclair has been in very good health\n\fand fresh to the work, I have noticed that sounds, in this\nstage of the trance, have much less effect on her.\nThe writing trance is rather exhausting, and the vitality of\nthe sensitive is certainly lowered whilst she is in it. The\nroom has to be well warmed in winter, or she will easily catch\ncold, and in summer the windows are closed to exclude draught\nas well as noise.\nThe content of the writing is largely of an advisory nature,\nand continually urges Miss Sinclair to persevere with the\ndevelopment of her psychical powers. It also supplies necessary\ninformation about the evidential cases. Cards, for instance,\nin the clairvoyant experiments, are much more easily given\nin the writing trance than they are by word of mouth in the\nclairvoyant state. The writer of the greater part of the\nscript claims to be Miss Sinclair's subliminal self. (Perhaps it\nis hardly correct to say that this claim was actually made.\nI had always represented it in this light to Miss Sinclair, and\nthe suggestion was tacitly adopted in the script. On the\nonly occasion on which I asked the writer of the script for\na name, the answer given was\n\"\nThe Advisor.\") But there\nhas been a certain small amount of writing given in a\ndeeper stage of trance of which the subliminal does not claim\nthe authorship, and of which I will speak later (see p. 313).\nOn two isolated occasions only has there been any claim\nthat a message was given from the dead, when, on each\noccasion, Omar Khayyam made a meteor-like appearance, and\nfavoured us with a misquotation from the Rubdiydt.\nA Possibly Precognitive Trance State.\nAt a sitting held on October 10, 1921, Miss Sinclair appeared\nto go into a new kind of trance, in which she was, on that\noccasion, still more sensitive to sounds than in ordinary writing\ntrance. Three times, as she was entering it, she was brought\nback by the faintest sounds, and I was obliged to remove my\nwrist-watch, as its ticking disturbed her. When at last she\ngot into trance, the writing was produced with laborious\nslowness, and she said,\n\"\nIt's all different ;\nI can't write any\nfaster.\" At the end of the trance the subliminal wrote a\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Reject rcA. JUNE, 1922.\nwarning to be careful afterwards, and Miss Sinclair woke up\na good deal exhausted.\nThe subsequent occasions on which she has been in this kind\nof trance have been in connection with evidential cases of\nprecognition, some of which have been of extraordinary interest,\nbut the worrying effect of slight sounds has not been so\nmarked as it was on the first occasion.\nI have to rely here a good deal on the account which Miss\nSinclair gives of her subjective experiences, but I think it will\nbe of interest to notice the way in which a piece of pre-\ncognitive evidential material appears to be got through. There\nis first a period of strain and effort, while she appears to\ngrapple with the test, saying in trance that she finds it very\nhard, and frequently ejaculating things in a perplexed sort of\nway, as,\n\"\nOh, numbers, numbers, they're all mixed up !\n\"\nThen comes a wave of satisfaction and relief, and she announces\nthat she has accomplished a new test. It is noteworthy that\nwhen this stage is reached, she always looks upon the thing\nas done, although she is still quite ignorant of what it is.\nIt still lies below the level of consciousness, even in light\ntrance. Afterwards it may be a day or more later a second\nand smaller effort brings the test to the surface, either in the\nform of an impression or else at a trance sitting. This\nprocess always suggests to me the existence of a number of\ndifferent levels, or depths in the subliminal region of the self,\nand that it is the passage of a piece of evidential material\nthrough these strata of consciousness that is the really difficult\npart of its production. Constant communication may be going\non for all we know between one person and another at some\ndeep level of the subliminal self. It is possible that we may even\nbe able to influence one another in ways which a good deal\ntranscend our ordinary ideas of telepathy, but nothing can be\nknown of this unless we can devise means of bringing to the\nsurface things which happen in the depths of consciousness,\nand in getting them expressed in a form which will appeal\nto the physical senses. Here would seem to be the crux of\npsychical investigation at the moment, and it would seem\nto suggest the great importance of studying the states of\ntrance.\n\fJINK, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair.\nDeep Trance.\nOn certain occasions the ordinary writing trance has given\nplace to a deeper stage in which the writing is slower, more\nlaboured, and to a certain extent different in character, if the\nautomatic scrawl can be said to possess any character. Warn-\ning is usually given in the ordinary script that the deep trance\nis about to begin, and advice given for special care afterwards.\nI find myself unable to describe the visible difference between\nthe deep and the ordinary stages. I think that Miss\nSinclair's expression changes somewhat, but all that I am aware\nof at the time is a peculiar feeling of tension while the deep\nstage lasts, and of relief when it is over. The deep stage is\nused when attempts are said to be made to produce evidential\nmessages in the script, and on two occasions something in the\nnature of cross-correspondences are claimed to have been given\nin it, but up to date these claims have not been proved.\nAbout the time that the deep trance was being established\nas a more or less regular feature of the sittings, and I was\nbeing advised to regard it as the most important part of the\nwork, particular difficulty was being experienced in obtaining\nsufficiently quiet conditions. After the conditions had been\nimproved, the intelligence, or intelligences, who direct Miss\nSinclair's psychical development, seem to have changed their\npolicy, and abandoned, at any rate temporarily, the writing\nsittings in favour of experiments in clairvoyance and pre-\ncognition, which were brought to the surface a good deal in\nthe form of impressions.\nI think this may have been partly because Miss Sinclair was\ngetting rather overstrained, and was probably not in a con-\ndition for deep trance.\nIt is of the deep trance writing that the subliminal dis-\nclaims the authorship, but no signature has ever been given,\nor claim of authorship made for it. There has not been\nenough material given up to the present in this stage of trance\nto enable me to judge of its probable ultimate value, but I\nfeel certain that interesting results of some sort will accrue\nwhen we are able to get back to it.\nIn the development of this case, I have been struck by the\nway in which events have been ordered by an intelligence\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922\n(or intelligences ;\nMiss Sinclair when in light trance often refers\nto a mysterious \"they\") behind the scenes. When I began,\nit was my intention to concentrate chiefly on experiments in\ntelepathy, and I imagined that the arrangement of these\nexperiments would be entirely in my own hands. I found that\nthis was not the case, however, and Miss Sinclair's sensitivity\nbegan to develop itself very much according to a plan of its\nown. And now I have come to feel that my role is more\nthat of an observer and a recorder than of an experimenter.\nTelepathy has been a very minor feature in the programme,\nand the crystal, which is one thing that I did introduce on\nmy own responsibility, has turned out to be something of a\nsnare.\nThe above are all the stages which seem to fit into a\nprogressive series. As I have said before, it is very difficult\nto draw a definite line anywhere between state and state, and\nthere may be an infinite possible number of trance states, by\nwhich I mean that all the states, including sleep and the\nwaking state as well, may merge into one another by insensible\ngradations.\nThere are a few remaining points which do not fit into any\nseries.\nVisions.\nOn certain occasions at night, Miss Sinclair has seen visions\nwhich appear to be externalised things. I mention them here,\nbecause on one occasion she attempted to describe one of these\nvisions to me while she was observing it, and the mode of\ndescribing it has perhaps its bearing on the description of\n\"\nspirits\n\"\nby the controls of mediums. The vision was a\nface. She said it looked misty or shadowy, and it evidently\nappeared to be in the room with her, for she pointed into\nthe corner, and asked me if I did not see it too. She de-\nscribed the face as being something like my own; as belonging\nto a person who had something to do with me, and whose\nphotograph had been on my dressing table. This made it\ncertain that she must be referring to my grandfather, who has\nbeen dead many years. I then asked for a description of the\nface, and she gave this in a vague, uncertain and contradictory\nway, which reminded me very much of the usual mediumistic\n\fJUNE, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 315\ndescriptions. I asked whether the face had a beard or a\nmoustache (my grandfather was clean-shaven, and appears so\nin the photograph which Miss Sinclair has often seen), and she\nsaid it had a moustache ;\nthen she said\n\"\nNo,\" it had a beard,\nand seemed very uncertain even about that. Now I\nthink this uncertainty arose, as Miss Sinclair said at the time\nthat it did, not from any failure on her part to see the vision\nproperly, but from the fact that it was a supernormal per-\nception, and therefore she had exactly the same difficulty in\ndescribing it as in giving the denomination of a clairvoyantly\nperceived card, or in telling me an impression before it has\nrisen to the surface. It seems to be symptomatic of all\nsupernormally perceived ideas, at any rate in Miss Sinclair's\ncase, that there should be this difficulty in describing a thing\nwhich is all the while present to the consciousness. The\nnormal and supernormal perceptions evidently do not stand in\nthe same relations to the functions of the brain ; they do not\nseem to be equally capable of originating a motor impulse.\nOne is tempted to speculate that supernormal thoughts, ideas\nand perceptions may perhaps be purely psychical things ;\nthat they do not correspond to definite brain changes, and\nthat the controlling consciousness, acting perhaps the part of\na switchboard operator in a vastly complicated telephone ex-\nchange, is at a loss to know what to do with a subscriber who\nhas no number. At any rate I make the suggestion for what it\nis worth, that some of the apparently banal remarks and de-\nscriptions with which we are familiar from mediums may arise\nfrom unsuccessful attempts to do with supernormally perceived\nimages and ideas what it is easy to do with normally perceived\nimages and ideas, viz. to translate them into words.\nPerhaps what is wanted to overcome the difficulty is a\ndeeper stage of trance.\nThe Subliminal.\nOn eight occasions during the development of Miss Sinclair's\ntrance phenomena, there has been an irruption of a different\npersonality which, for lack of better knowledge, I call the\nsubliminal self. It usually appears when Miss Sinclair is in\nlight trance, speaks a few words, and disappears again. It\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1922.\nrefers to the sensitive in the third person as\n\"\nShe.\" The\nvoice is Miss Sinclair's ordinary voice, but the wording and\nadvisory nature of the, speech, as well as the manner of its\ndelivery, suggest the writer of the script. Sometimes, for\ninstance, there is a pause if one asks a question, just as there\nis in the writing trance, and sometimes also questions are\nignored. Miss Sinclair calls this personality\n\"\nthe other part\nof me,\" and sometimes, when in light trance, introduces it by\nsaying,\n\"\nThe other part of me is going to speak to you now.\"\nSometimes it makes its appearance without her knowing that\nit is\ncoming, and she will be annoyed afterwards, and say,\n\"\nHow dare it interfere with me !\n\"\nOne might think of this\nintelligence as an incipient secondary personality. I do not\nknow what it is, but it has not shown any tendency to push\nitself further to the front as Miss Sinclair's powers have\ndeveloped, or to assume undue influence. It remains in the\nbackground as friend and advisor.\nDreams.\nI think Miss Sinclair's dream life differs from that of\nordinary people, in that the best remembered and most vivid\nof her dreams do not occur during ordinary sleep. One\nparticularly remarkable dream, which is of a recurrent nature,\nhas occurred also as an experience of deep trance in the day-\ntime, and I suspect that when it has occurred at night, she\nhas been in trance, or in a state bordering on both trance\nand sleep. It is habitual with her, if at all tired, to pass\ninto light trance first, and from it into sleep, and it seems\nprobable that there may be the same gradual transition between\ntrance and sleep as there is between trance and the waking\nstate.\nThe dreams, or trance-dreams, which she is able to re-\nmember sometimes repeat what has been said in the script,\nespecially in the way of reinforcing advice given. Sometimes\nthey are repetitions of visions seen in the crystal, and some-\ntimes they refer to future events. I cannot say at the present\ntime how many of these may prove to be veridical ; up to\nthe present, two certainly have been.\nIn general her dreams seem to be used for the purpose of\n\fi!)22. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 317\nemphasising points in the writing, etc., which the controlling\nintelligences consider to be important, or repeating them if\nthere is reason to think that they have not been clearly given.\nCrystal Visions.\nMiss Sinclair can nearly always see visions in the crystal\nafter looking into it for four or five minutes. It then appears\nto become cloudy, and a scene appears which she is able to\ndescribe as it unfolds itself. After a short time the scene\ndisappears of its own accord.\nWhen I introduced her to the use of the crystal, it was\nin the hope of being able to experiment in telepathy by\nmentally influencing the visions. Here, however, I was dis-\nappointed. I tried several times, by thinking of Shelley's\nlines,\n\"\nLife like a dome of many coloured glass,\nStains the white radiance of eternity,\"\nand endeavouring to visualise a dome of bright colours\nsurrounded by a white glow, to get her to see it in the\ncrystal. She never saw it, or anything like it. Her visions\nwere quite unpredictable. Sometimes she would describe\nscenes from my own experience in France during the war\nwith a good deal of detail. In particular she described one\noccasion on which I got lost on a dark night, and my diffi-\nculties in getting my motor-cycle past some blown-up bridges,\nand my sensations, even to that of eating an army biscuit\nwhen hot and thirsty. \"It is dry !\n\"\nshe remarked, and then\nshe proceeded to describe the eeriness of the scene, and\nexpressed alarm at the thought of being left alone among the\nruins. She described the derelict houses and the river rushing\nover the wreckage of the blown-up bridge. All this was quite\ncorrect, but she had seen a letter of mine describing the\nincident at the time, and it is hard to say how much, if\nany,\nof it was due to telepathy.\nOn another occasion she described a tropical scene, com-\nprising wild animals, men dressed in shooting suits trying to\nshoot a tiger which was attacking a woman, etc. Afterwards\nshe said she wanted to get the Proceedings of the S.P.R. for\nNovember, 1920, to find in it something which related to this\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

When I looked through the volume, I found\nthat her vision corresponded sufficiently closely to one of Mr.\nHubert Wales' thought-transference experiments (No. XII. on\np. 143). This was quite at the beginning of Miss Sinclair's\npsychical work, when she had scarcely heard of the S.P.R.,\nand had never read any of the Proceedings, in which she took\nno interest.\nSome of the crystal visions have purported to relate to\nfuture events, but so far most of them still await verification.\nI endeavoured to persuade the writer of the script to make\nthe script and crystal visions supplement one another, my\nobject being to try and discover the relation between the\nstates of consciousness involved in the two phenomena. The\nanswer given was that the scribe could not at present influence\nthe crystal visions, though it would be possible to do so when\nthe psychical development was more advanced. More recently,\none of the alleged cross-correspondences given in the deep\ntrance writing was repeated in the crystal in visual form.\nThe crystal, as I mentioned before, proved rather a danger\nin Miss Sinclair's case, on account of the ease with which she\npasses into trance when looking at it. Unless all the pre-\ncautions for a trance sitting have been taken beforehand, it\nmay therefore lead to her getting a shock. On this account\nthe use of the crystal has for the present been discontinued.\nPART II. EVIDENTIAL CASES.\nThe evidential cases which I have selected for publication\nconsist of four clairvoyant tests, and three which I may call\ncases of prevision, though reserving judgment as to their true\nexplanation. All these tests were made with cards, which\nseem to offer special advantages in cases of clairvoyance which\nare absent, for example, in a book test. Even if it can be\nproved that the sensitive has never seen the book, some one\nelse has seen it, and a roundabout theory of telepathy is not\nexcluded, but no one can have seen the order of the cards in\na newly shuffled pack. It is also possible to submit the\nquestion of chance to calculation.\nIn the first two experiments I shuffled the cards very\nthoroughly immediately before the sitting, keeping the pack\n\fJINK, 1922.

Miss Sinclair then came and\ntook her seat beside me at the table, went into trance and\nbegan to write automatically. The cards were before me the\nwhole time ;\nI watched them continuously, and am certain that\nno one touched them from beginning to end of the experiment,\nexcept that after each word had been fully written in the\nscript, I turned up the top card.\nAll the experiments were done either in full daylight or by\nthe light of a large duplex oil lamp, the ordinary illumination\nof the room.\nI.\nSeptember 14, 1921.

JUNE, 1922-\nwas to be shuffled immediately before the sitting. She also\nwrote the cards again in trance at 9.30 p.m., and the script\nwas dated, timed and attested by my wife and myself.\nOn October 18, 1921, at 6.30 p.m., my wife was sitting in\na low arm-chair at one side of a small table, playing a card-\ngame with Miss Sinclair, who sat on an ordinary chair opposite\nto her. The latter then asked my wife to shuffle the cards\nfor her, and I quote her account of the way in which she\ndid so.\n\"\nAt 6.30 on October 18, Miss Sinclair asked me to shuffle a\npack of cards. We were sitting opposite to one another at a\ntable about 2 feet wide. She was sitting on a high chair, I in\na low arm-chair. First I shuffled the cards, passing three or\nfour cards first to the back of the pack and then to the front,\nafterwards I shuffled the cards twice on the table in the American\nway. Finally I cut the cards on my lap, and then placed them\nupon the table face downwards.\nThe only chance she had of seeing the cards was when I\nshuffled them on the table, and they were moved too quickly\nthen for anyone to distinguish one card from another.\nAfter I had placed the pack on the table, Miss Sinclair moved\nit to one side, but did not lift the pack more than an inch from\nthe table. I am quite sure she had no opportunity of knowing\nhow the cards were in the pack.\" C. M. T\nFrom this point onwards I watched the rest of the experi-\nment myself, sitting beside Miss Sinclair at the table. She\nwent into trance and wrote automatically the same cards which\nshe had given the previous day, the pack lying meanwhile\non the table just in front of me, where I watched it till the\ntrance was over, after which my wife and I turned up the\nfirst six cards.\nThey were :\nKing, ten, knave, ten, eight, six, in order.\nI am quite sure that there was not the slightest opportunity\nfor the sensitive to take the pack and arrange it unperceived,\nsince either my wife or myself was watching her closely all.\nthe while.\nAfter the experiment, I sat in the chair which the sensitive\nhad occupied, while my wife repeated the shuffling of the pack,\nand I found it was quite impossible to see any of the cards.,\n\f-i\nINK, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 323\nexcept once.

They were written down at\nonce, and the paper dated and attested by my wife and\nmyself.\nThe cards were :\nFour, five, six, ace, two.\nOn October 25, 1921, at 6.30 p.m., Miss Sinclair asked my\nwife to shuffle the pack for her, and, suspecting an experiment,\nshe shuffled them under some needlework which she had on\nher lap. I was unfortunately out of the room at the moment,\nbut came in a few minutes later.\nMy wife's account is as follows :\n\"\nThis evening, while my husband had gone out, Miss Sinclair\nasked me to shuffle a new pack of cards. I had some white\nwork on my lap, and I shuffled the cards twice and cut the pack\nall under the work, so that it was impossible for her to see them.\nIn fact, I could not see the cards myself. I then placed them\nface downwards on the table and she did not touch them at all.\nHere my husband returned. Miss Sinclair then took a pencil and\npaper and sat down at the table. She went into trance, and\nwrote the following numbers :\n4, 5, 6, 1, 2. I saw the numbers\nwritten on the script, and my husband then said each number\naloud before he turned up the card, and each card was the number\nhe called.\" C. M. T\nWhen I came in the pack was lying face downwards on\nthe table, and I pushed it to the far corner, and watched it\ntill the end of the experiment. No one touched it. Miss\nSinclair sat beside me at the table, went into trance, and\nwrote :\nFour, five, six, ace, two.\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922..\nI then turned up the cards one by one from the pack, and\nthey were :\nFour, five, six, ace, two, in order.\np= -h x Ax 5% x A x %'\nP= i\n304,550'\nVII.\nThis case contains a very interesting feature, in that it was\napparently fulfilled twice over.\nOn October 27, 1921, at 6 p.m., Miss Sinclair gave the\ncards :\nTen, eight, five, nine, three, two, knave, queen.\nThey were spoken in light trance, and immediately written\ndown by me, and the paper dated and attested by my wife\nand myself.\nOn October 28, 1921, Miss Sinclair asked me to shufne a\npack that she might amuse herself by turning the cards up\nalone, as she was accustomed to do. I did so, but remember-\ning the test given the night before, I stood watching till\ntwelve cards had been turned up. They were all different to\nthose of the test, so I turned away and began to read. Soon\nMiss Sinclair said that she felt she was going into trance,\nand thought that the test was coming off, but I took the cards\naway and dissuaded her from going into trance, telling her that\nthe test would not be evidential if it did come off now, as\nI had not been watching her. At the same time I removed\nthe cards, minus those which she had turned up, undisturbed\nto another room, and, on looking at them, found that the\ntop eight cards of the pack were actually the test cards in\norder. Miss Sinclair gave me her word that she had not\ntouched the pack at all whilst I had not been looking, and\non counting I found that it was still only twelve cards short.\nStill, I regarded the test as spoilt evidentially, but only told\nMiss Sinclair that I had mixed the cards up, and that I\nexpected the test would be fulfilled another time. In reality\nI did not expect it, but was glad to see that she took it as\na matter of course that it would be.\nOn October 31, 1921, at about 6 p.m., Miss Sinclair again\nasked me to shuffle a pack of cards for her to amuse herself\nwith (just as amnesia supervenes after trance, so the sensitive\n\fJUNK, 1922. Tli< (\\iHe of Mif* Nditci\/ Sinclair. 325\nis always ignorant, when in the normal state, of when trance\nwill occur, or an incident be fulfilled). I took the cards away\nto a small table in the corner of the room, and, turning my\nback to the room, shuffled the cards face downwards three\ntimes by the usual method of allowing the two halves of the\npack to interleave themselves rapidly by running off the\nthumbs. Then I divided the pack into small ones, and placed\nthese about on one another in different orders. Finally I cut\nthe pack, and placed it on the table before the sensitive, at\nthe same time sitting facing her across the table watching the\npack carefully. She said,\n\"\nOh, can I get the test out to-\nnight ?\n\"\nand brought her hands down with an impulsive\nmovement on to the cards. I told her to take them up\nimmediately, and they did not remain on the cards more than\nan instant, and I am sure she did not raise a single card, for\nI kept my eyes on the pack. I then pushed the pack away\nfrom her, and she went into trance, and wrote the series of\ncards again. I turned up the eight top cards, and found\nthey were :\nTen, eight, five, nine, three, two, knave, queen, in order.\nThis was attested in writing by my wife and myself.\np=\nA> x A x Ax A x AXTT x\n4(52,980,000\nIn view of the extraordinary nature of these results, and\nespecially of the last three, many people will doubtless incline\nto the belief that there must have been fraud of some kind.\nFraud may of course be conscious or unconscious. The idea\nof conscious fraud on Miss Sinclair's part would be admitted\nto be an absurdity by anyone who knew her personally, and\nalthough it is true that personal considerations are not as a\nrule allowed much weight in scientific evidence, it yet seems\nreasonable to admit that one cannot know a person intimately\nfor several years without being able to form a fairly good\njudgment as to their integrity of character.\nIf conscious fraud occurred in these cases, it would pre-\nsuppose on the part of the sensitive a high degree of\nproficiency in the art of conjuring. It can hardly be sup-\nposed that anyone, however expert, could rearrange a pack\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.\nof cards without detection, so as to get six or eight\nparticular cards to the top arranged in a special order, whilst\nunder close inspection and in a good light. The fraud\nwould have to be done either by the substitution of a prepared\npack, or by abstracting the test cards from the pack before\nshuffling, placing them in order, and then concealing them\nuntil they could be replaced on top of the pack after the\nshuffling was done. There were only two packs of cards in the\nhouse when these experiments were done, one with blue backs\nand the other with red. Both packs were soiled, the blue-\nbacked being more soiled than the red, and both were used in\nthe experiments. I was familiar with their appearance, and\nshould have immediately detected a new pack even if the\ncolour and design of the backs had been the same. In the\nlast test, Miss Sinclair was wearing a jumper with sleeves only\ndown to the elbow, and I should think substitution would\nhave been an extremely difficult feat under the circumstances\neven for an expert.\nAs for abstracting the cards, it is true that I did not guard\nagainst the possibility by counting the cards before shuffling.\nThe feat of concealing the cards would have been a difficult\none, as I was watching closely. Also there is no evidence\nthat Miss Sinclair possesses the slightest skill in manipulating\ncards in any of her psychical states. She certainly does not\nin the normal. In addition, it will be seen from the accounts\nof experiments V., VI. and VII., that Miss Sinclair did not\ngo into trance until after I, or my wife, had taken away the\npack and shuffled it. When the pack was taken from the\ntable at which she was sitting, she was still in the normal\nstate. If, therefore, she abstracted the cards, she must have\ndone so consciously, and the fraud must have been deliberate.\nI can only repeat that it is sufficient to know Miss Sinclair\nto rule out this possibility.\nEven then, it may be thought that Miss Sinclair was not\nreally in quite a normal state just prior to the carrying out\nof these experiments, although she appeared to be, and that\nshe abstracted the necessary cards in some very light stage\nof trance, and without any normal consciousness of what she\ndid.\nI may point out here that her case is not really analogous\n\fJUNE, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 327\nto one in which sittings are held with a professional medium,\nor even where visits are paid to the house of a private sensi-\ntive. Miss Sinclair has been living in the same house with\nus for months, and I have been able to observe her closely\nin all her psychical states. If there had been a tendency to\nfraud in any one of them, it seems in the highest degree\nimprobable that no trace of it would ever have been betrayed.\nThe point, which is of great interest, of whether or not the\ncards in Case VII. were shuffled twice running, so as to bring\nthe eight top cards into a particular order, certainly does rest\non the word of the sensitive, though the final fulfilment of\nthe test does not.\nIf we accept her statement that she did not touch the\ncards during this interval, it follows that these tests are not\nstrictly precognitive, or at any rate not wholly so, for the\ncards could not have arranged themselves twice in the same\norder by chance. It looks as though, in some extraordinary\nway, Miss Sinclair is able to influence people subliminally to\nfulfil her predictions, and what is more, to do things that\nthey could not possibly do by their own volition.\nEINER NIELSEN.\nIN the third part of the Norsk Tidsskrift for Psykisk Forskning\nare published the reports of the committees which have been\ninvestigating the materialization phenomena of the medium Einer\nNielsen. The document opens with an account of phenomena\nproduced at Copenhagen in 1921 at which were present F.\nGrunewald, K. H. Krabbe and C. Winther. It will be remembered\nthat when Baron von Schrenck-Notzing was at the Congress at\nCopenhagen he saw Einer Nielsen and gave it to be understood\nthat he was convinced of the genuineness of the manifestations. In\nthe first report here published the same conclusion is arrived at\nby the investigators above named, and they say that under severe\ncontrol the teleplasma was observed in some quantity.\nEarly in 1922 a further series of sittings was arranged under\nthe auspices of the Norwegian Society for Psychical Research, and\nit is their report that constitutes the body of the present journal.\nThe committee consisted of Drs. A. de Besche, F. Gr0n, A. 0.\nHaneborg, 0. Jaeger, T. Wereide, S. Wetterstad and Profs. P.\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.\nHeegaard, C. Ihlen, C. Schnitler. The seances were held in the\nSociety's rooms at 22 Nordal Brunsgate and five sittings in all\nWere held. At the fifth sitting the committee believed that the\nphenomena were not genuine and that the piece of\n\"\nteleplasm\nwhich was produced was abstracted from the medium's person\nand finally swallowed\/' At this sitting the control was fairly\nstrict, although not as severe as the Committee wished owing to\nthe objection of the medium. The clothing worn at the seance\nconsisted of an overall with socks fast sewn on below, a jersey\nwith gauze hood attached and loose trousers. The hands were\nalso enclosed in gauze bags as had been done in the case of\nStanislawa P. At the sitting conclusive evidence was obtained\nthat the medium had been able to effect an entrance into his\nclothing in such a way that it would have been possible to gain\npossession of an object concealed about his person. A small\nhole, of about a finger thickness and 4 cm. above the seam be-\ntween the hood and the neckband, was found in the veil; and it\nis through this hole that the medium is supposed to have drawn\nthe veiling used to represent teleplasma in order to swallow it.\nAnother point is that in the excremental specimens examined\nwere found some material which the legal chemist Bruff describes\nas strong reddish brown tissue paper.\nAlthough the sittings were unsatisfactory it is difficult to accept\nthe committee's findings as to fraud on the part of the medium.\nThere is really very little evidence to indicate that the medium\nacted as the committee allege. Doubtless he got one of his\nhands inside his garments, which shows that the sort of clothes\ndevised by the committee were not at all suitable for the purpose\nof the seances. The bodily control so objected to by sensitive\npersons need not be insisted on if the garments provided prevent\nany ingress to the openings of the body. In the present instance\nthe control was not over severe, but the examination was un-\nnecessary if the clothes had been of the right pattern. We\nhave also to consider the previous seances with Herr Grunewald,\nin which phenomena appeared under what seem to have been\ngood conditions. Generally speaking we are far from satisfied\nthat Einer Nielsen has been detected in fraud, although it is\npossible that a more detailed acquaintance with the sittings might\nmodify that feeling of doubt.

Readers of Proceedings will remember the report on\nProfessor Murray's experiments in thought-transference, in\nwhich Mrs. Toynbee was usually one of the agents (Proc.\nS.P.R., Vol. XXIX., pp. 64-110).\nThe percipient's statement was contained in a letter to Mrs.\nSalter, as follows :\n4th April, 1922.\nHere is what looks like a curious thought-transference dream,\nwhich I have just had. On the night of Wednesday, March 29th,\nI was staying with my daughter Rosalind at 16 Carlyle Mansions,\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1022.\nChelsea. I dreamt that I went out to dine and was received\nin a large room. When my host came in, I knew he was an\nenemy in some sense, and thought at the same time what a nice\nfellow he looked ;\nbut what struck me most was his gorgeous\nappearance. He was dressed in a white Albanian kilt, a crimson\nsash, an open waistcoat with a gold border, and something or\nother blue with fleurs de lys upon it. I complimented him upon\nhis clothes, and he said he was the chief of the Campbell clan\nand these were the Campbell colours.\nI mentioned the dream at breakfast, and Rosalind said there\nwas a story she had meant to tell me the night before and had\nthought about in bed, wishing she had told it to me. An English-\nman called X. had been to school at Smyrna. Afterwards he\nfought in the British army and formed part of the forces sent\nto occupy Constantinople ;\nthere he met in the street a Turk\nwhom he recognized as an old school-fellow, and who asked him\nto dinner the following night. They had, of course, been fighting\non opposite sides. Next night he went to the restaurant and\nwas confounded to find his Turkish friend in full uniform as an\nOttoman officer. There was an army order out forbidding English\nofficers from fraternizing with Turkish officers in uniform. The\nEnglishman had a moment's hesitation, and then, in his own\nwords, decided that it was\n\"\na choice between disobeying orders\nand not behaving like a gentleman.\" He disobeyed orders, dined\nwith the uniformed Turk, was observed and hauled over the coals,\nand eventually dismissed with a warning.\nThe coincidence with my dream is very striking. It is not,\nof course, evidential ; but, considering the evidence already\nexisting of normal thought-transference between my daughter and\nme, I think it looks like a case of dream thought-transference.\nGILBERT MURRAY.\nThe following corroborative statement was obtained from\nMrs. Toynbee, also in a letter to Mrs. Salter :\nApril 14, 1922.\nMy father has sent me on your letter, asking for a statement\nfrom me about his dream. I don't know how detailed a\nstatement that means ? You have already the account of the\ndream from him, so I suppose this is just to \" confirm\n\"\nwhat\nhappened ?\n\fJULY, 1922. Case : A Telepathic Dream. 335\nHe was staying with us here at the time as far as I remember\nit was on the night of March 29th that he had the dream but\nI am not positive about the date, as I made no note of it.\nAny way, on the evening of the night he had his dream, we\nhad been talking about a certain Turkish friend of my husband's,\nfrom whom he had just received a rather important letter. He\nhad been showing the letter to my father, and they had been\ndiscussing various (political) questions arising from it. While they\nwere doing this I was thinking of an amusing story about this\nsame Turk which had been told me by a mutual friend. The\npoint of the story was the predicament in which a young British\nofficer found himself after the Armistice, in Constantinople, when,\nhaving accepted an invitation to dinner from this Turk (an old\nfriend of his), while in\n\"\nmufti,\" he found himself confronted at\nthe door of the Restaurant by a Turkish officer in the full\nsplendour of his\n\" Dress Uniform.\" It being strictly forbidden\nfor British officers to accept invitations from Turkish officers at\nthat time.\nThis story was in my mind while they were discussing the letter\nfrom the Turk in question, and I meant to tell it to my father\nat the time, but as the political discussion continued, it seemed\nflippant at the moment, and later in the evening it had passed\nfrom my mind. I only remembered it at breakfast the next\nmorning, when my father told me his dream.\nI am afraid this is a very rambling account of what happened.\nI hope it supplies what is needed ? ROSALIND TOYNBEE.\nAN EXPERIMENT WITH THE CREWE CIRCLE.\nEDITORIAL NOTE.\nThe record printed below is an account of a sitting with Mr.\nHope and Mrs. Buxton submitted to us by one of our Associates,\nMajor R. E. E. Spencer. Major Spencer has had considerable\nexperience in both normal and alleged psychic photography,\nhaving obtained what he considers to be supernormal productions\nwith no one present but members of his own family. In accord-\nance with our invitation inserted in the May Journal, p. 283,\nwe print the record as it stands so that readers may see exactly\nwhat Major Spencer obtained and under what conditions. The\n11\nextra\n\"\nreceived is reproduced as Plate I. It does not resemble\n\f336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922.\nwhat we may call the standard type obtained by Mr. Hope,\nnamely a face surrounded by a veil which hangs down on either\nside. We have not seen the original negative without which\nall criticism must necessarily be of little use,\n1\nbut from the print\nsupplied by Major Spencer, we do not think that it is out of the\nrange of possibility that a flashlight apparatus might have been\nused, if opportunity had occurred. According to Major Spencer's\nreport this opportunity did not present itself,\nand having no\nfurther evidence we must leave the matter there. In conclusion\nwe think we ought to point out that in a test experiment of this\nkind it was a pity that Major Spencer's camera was left in his\nunlocked despatch case in the studio with Mrs. Buxton when he\nand Hope were in the dark-room. We do not imply that the\ncamera was actually tampered with (this appears indeed very\nimprobable), but the fact that Major Spencer allowed such a\npossibility to arise gives the sceptic some ground for suggesting\nthat there may conceivably have been some opportunity for a\nfraudulent manipulation in another part of the sitting, which\nwas either not noticed by Major Spencer at the time, or discarded\nas unimportant and forgotten afterwards. We call attention\nto this point in order to emphasise the importance of conducting\nsuch experiments under exact and methodical conditions. As a\nmisunderstanding may arise on the question of the print, which\nis reproduced, bearing the number 3, we may say that this number\nis correct, and does not refer to the number of the plate.\nMAJOR SPENCER'S KEPORT.\nExperiment with Hope and Mrs. Buxton.\nDate. 17th May, 1921.\nPlace. 59 Holland Park.

This has been my\ncustom at all experiments.\nMy own slides were placed in my coat pocket immediately\nthey were filled, and it is with these two slides I am concerned.\nI will leave Hope's dark slides out of the question, as I cannot\nprove the futility of Mr. Marriott's Nos. 6 and 7 methods in the\ncase of the plates contained by them, because Mrs. Buxton was\nleft alone in the studio with Hope's camera, when he and I were\nin the dark room together.\nMy own camera remained closed in my despatch case (also\nclosed 2\n)\ntill I returned from the dark room, when I set it up\non its tripod, extending it, and focussing it upon the chair\n1\nSee 8.P.E.

Although\nwe cannot concur with much that Mr. McKenzie says it is clear\nthat he has taken some trouble to discover which of Miss Besin-\nnet's phenomena are\n\"\nindependent\n\"\nand which are not. For\nexample, he obtained a piece of apparatus which registered the\nmoments that Miss Besinnet was standing up, which reminds us:\nof the similar device used on the Continent for Florence Cook.\nAt the last sitting also he caused a flash lamp to be suddenly\ndirected on a\n\"\nmaterialized\n\"\nface with the result that the medium\ncollapsed and was ill for several days. It is strange that this,\nmethod of investigation should have been employed by those who\nwould have been the first to condemn such proceedings had they\nbeen in use by psychical researchers. Indeed we believe the\nincident to have been totally unnecessary, and to judge from the\nstate of the medium when the writer met her in New York it\nwill not encourage American mediums to visit the College without\nsome guarantee that it will not be repeated.\nWe cannot deal in detail with the report, which does not\ndiffer so very greatly from that previously published by Dr.\nHyslop. Mr. McKenzie has a curious way of mixing up cautious\nobservations with the wildest conjectures, such as the extension\nof the soul parts and the scent of\n\"\nectoplasm\n\"\nwhich he is able\nto notice^whilst entering a tram car in which was installed a,\nmaterializing medium. One more example of Mr. McKenzie's,\n\fJULY, 1922. Notes an Recent Periodicals. 33D\ncurious observations. On p. 29, in dealing with the position of\nmembers of the circle he says that\n\"\nmovements of the medium\ncould easily be detected by the sitter No. 9 when he was in\ndirect contact with the medium.\" Yet on p. 38 he seems sur-\nprised that the sitters cannot detect Miss Besinnet's movements ;\non p. 44 he admits the surprise of No. 9 that she was able to-\nrise from her chair without his knowledge, and on p. 71 seems to-\nthink that the way she kept on getting up was\n\"\nquite a miracle.\"\nIn the March number of the Journal of the American S.P.R*\nis a case of spirit photography by Dr. A. S. Cushman. The\nauthor visited Mrs. Deane when in England and obtained a\nportrait which he says is that of his daughter and which is\nconfirmed by several of his relatives who knew the girl well\nwhen she was alive.\nMr. Dingwall contributes a short article on some experiments\nwith the Tromelin cylinders which do not confirm the previous\nexperiments made by Dr. Hyslop. The editor also has some\npertinent remarks on the Hope psychographs, showing how they\nare just what one would expect if they were fraudulently produced.\nIn the April number of the Journal of the American S.P.R.\nthe editor gently reproves certain English writers for their ap-\nparent insularity, and illustrates his remarks by some examples.\nThere is also a highly interesting case of apparent collective\nvisual\n\"\nhallucination\n\"\nand a further series of the observations\nof\n\"\nWilliam Bruce\n\"\nin his sittings with the Boston medium,\nMrs. Chenoweth. Another posthumous article by Dr. Hyslop\nis published, whilst Dr. Prince collects some specimens of\ndreams seeming or interpreted to indicate death, and Mr. Dingwall\nhas a note on a recent discussion of a book-test in the English\njournal Discovery.\nThe April number of Psyche contains no article on psychical\nresearch proper. Prof. McDougall has a paper on \" A New Theory\nof Laughter,\" whilst Mr. Cyril Burt contributes a discussion of the\n\"Causes\" and treatment of Juvenile Delinquency.\" Prof. Pear has\nsomething to say on mental tests and mentality in which he\nexpresses a good deal of suspicion, which anyone who has worked\nthem will be inclined to share. Indeed the paper is a welcome\ncontribution to the subject of the tests which fortunately have not\nyet obtained the popularity that they have in the United States.\nAs Prof. Pear pertinently remarks,\n\"\nPerhaps, indeed, it is time-\n\f340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

There is also a review by General\nPeter of Ernest Bozzano's recently published work on the pheno-\nmena of haunting, and an article by Hans Hanig on ghostly funeral\nprocessions.\nIn the Occult Review for June are some notes on Mrs. Hort's\nrecent book on Dr. John Dee. Raps and mysterious fires appear\nto have been noticed, and Dr. Dee's use of the crystal is well\nknown. For those who wish to glance at the evidence and\ndescriptive matter concerning Dr. Dee's spiritualistic work, the\nwork edited by M. Casaubon in 1659 entitled A true and faithful\nrelation of what passed for many years between Dr. John Dee . . .\nand some spirits will be found of some service. In the same\nissue of the Occult Review G. M. Mayhew sums up some of the\nlore concerning phantom coaches, whilst Mr. Stanley Redgrove has\nsomething to say on Pasteur and the problem of life.\nIn the May number of the Journal of the American S.P.R. the\nEditor discusses the oft-repeated assertion that spiritualism is\nresponsible for much lunacy and quotes the results of some of\nMr. H. J. Osborn's inquiries in this country showing that the\nidea is devoid of any real foundation. Dr. Pierre Mallet con-\ntributes the first part of a short paper on Psychic Phenomena\nand the Physician, whilst Dr. Miles M. Dawson gives some illus-\ntrations of William James's opinions of psychical research culled\nfrom his letters. A case of alleged clairvoyance is dealt with by\nDr. Prince, and Miss N. Smith contributes a short letter on Psycho\n-\nmetrical variations in which she mentions the phenomena obtained\nby a certain private medium of whom more will be heard in the\nfuture. Finally, Sir Oliver Lodge gives his opinion on the recently\npublished psychic photograph obtained by Dr. A. Cushman with\nMrs. Deane.\n*\nE. J. D.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI.\nTHE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY EVA C.\nTHE report on the above published in the Proceedings of January,\n1922 (Proc. 8.P.R., Vol. XXXIL, p. 209 ff.), and the various\n\fJULY, 1922.\nCorrespondence 341\ncommentaries thereon have furnished us all with extremely in-\nteresting, although perplexing material. An outstanding char-\nacteristic of these phenomena, whether they be regarded as\nfraudulent or genuinely supernormal, lies in their bizarre and at\nfirst sight meaningless and perplexing character. The rapid and\nProtean changes and transformations which they exhibited is\nanother remarkable feature. But should we not hesitate to regard\nthem as fraudulently produced simply because of the above\ncharacteristics ? There is an argument in favour of the genuine-\nness of mediums for materialization phenomena, which I do not\nremember to have come across, but which is perhaps worth\nmentioning. I think all who have studied the histories of\nmaterializing mediums must have been struck by the fact that\nthe most startling and life-like phenomena have occurred when\nthe mediums concerned were in the heyday of youth, 16 to 25\nyears old, after which their phenomena have gradually grown\nboth weaker and rarer until, after middle age, they have almost\nceased to be manifested. But if the phenomena are fraudulently\nproduced, and that too by methods of conjuring so skilful as to\nbaffle the efforts of eminent conjurors to explain and expose\nthem, then what should we expect to find ? We should find\nsurely that with fraudulent mediums their earliest phenomena\nwould be characterised by a degree of inexperienced clumsiness\nwhich would almost inevitably lead to speedy exposure, but,\nsupposing they escaped that fate, their accumulating experience\nand practice should not be expected to result in a culmination\nin successful deception at the age of 25 or so, but such powers\nshould be expected to grow and develop until well into the forties\nor fifties, just as skill and effectiveness in an ordinary person's\nlife business grows and culminates long after the heyday of youth\nand high spirits has passed away. Nevertheless it is the bounden\nduty of all investigators boldly to face, consider and, if\npossible, to\neliminate all opportunity for fraud in mediumistic phenomena, and\nin accordance with that cautious spirit our Research Officer,\nMr. E. G. Dingwall, has stated the case from the point of view\nof the conjuror for supposing fraud to be one, if not the only,\nexplanation of Eva C.'s phenomena ;\nand I think he has con-\nvinced us that the regurgitation theory (the only thinkable theory)\nof the appearances which were manifested is just as difficult and\nimpossible to swallow as it would have been for Eva C. to have\n\f342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922\nswallowed the extraordinary object seen on her left shoulder in\nPlate II. (op. cit., p. 236), in the form of a laughing face sur-\nrounded by a shock of dark fibrous material resembling hair. If\nwe once conceive of the raw material or ectoplasm being an\nemanation of protoplasmic substance highly charged with vital\nforces from the body of the medium, then should we not expect\nthat the places most adapted to its easy exudation would be\nwhere the more delicate and pervious mucous membranes occur,\ninstead of the comparatively impervious external skin ? And surely\nthe mucous linings of the mouth (and perhaps the oesophagus as\nwell) would lend themselves most readily in this case. As to the\nsmall particles of whitish material found adhering to her garments\nand the veil, which seemed under microscopic examination to\ncontain particles resembling paper and wood fibres ; while the\nfact naturally tends to raise suspicions at first, we have yet to\nconsider whether, if the\n\"\nectoplasmic\n\"\nemanation is genuine, we\nmay not suppose that, under the creative or moulding force\napparently at work, a fibrous structure in the raw material may not\nlikewise be brought about for purposes of enabling the moulded\nforms to hold together better during manifestation, and afterwards\nsome of the ectoplasmic material may have failed to be re-\nabsorbed and have remained externalised. Granted the reality\nof this ectoplasm and the intelligent moulding forces which we\nmust then suppose to be at work on it, we cannot then be\nsurprised if other startling consequences follow, including occasional\npermanent materialisation. We should bear in mind that the\nterm\n\"\nmaterialisation\n\"\nis perhaps misleading. What we are\napparently dealing with is not the creation of matter out of\nnothing, but the ideoplastic moulding and modifying of already\nexisting organic matter withdrawn from the body of the medium.\nThat the forms must be something much more than clumsy\nmanipulations of exgurgitated chewed paper, etc., is clearly evident\nfrom the descriptions of the same phenomena given by different\nsitters, which can only be reconciled on the assumption that the\nforms were subject to the most rapid and startling changes, to\nwhich mere paper pulp could not be imagined to lend itself.\nIt is a great pity that some of the photographs taken simul-\ntaneously by the two cameras were spoiled, thus preventing a\ncomparison between the view of the same manifestation as viewed\nfrom right and left under the same flashlight. It is very remark-\n\fJULY, 1922. Correspondence. 343\nable, however, that the two successful right and left simultaneous\nviews of the manifestation occurring in Sitting XVII., Plates V.\nand VI. (op. cit., p. 260), furnish certain features of singular\ninterest whose study leads to a conclusion quite opposed to the\nfirst interpretation put upon the pictures by the sitters in the\ngeneral remarks on the seance. In the first place the accounts\nby Mrs. Salter, Mr. Dingwall, Dr. Woolley and Mr. Baggally of\nwhat was seen by them up to 7 minutes before the flashlight\nphotos were taken (with the exception of Dr. Woolley's remark\nupon what he saw by torchlight at 7.30 p.m.) do not prepare one\nat all f>r the resulting photographs, and it is expressly stated\nthat they constituted a surprise for the committee, and the\ninterpretation put upon the photos was to the effect that the\nmedium was holding the object or mask of a human face down\nunder her chin. Certainly if\nonly one picture at a time is\nviewed this is the unavoidable impression conveyed. But I had\nnot compared the two views together for more than a minute\nwithout noticing an extraordinary incongruity in the comparative\nperspective which is absolutely inconsistent with the first inter-\npretation.\nI was then prompted to enter upon a more thorough-going and\ntechnical analysis of the relative perspective between Plates V.\nand VI. which I sent up to the Editor of the S.P.R. (Mrs. Salter)\ntogether with diagrams. This analysis being considered to be too\ntechnical for full reproduction here, I have been requested to deal\nmore shortly and generally with the conclusions arrived at, while\nthe full paper is filed with the Kecords of the Society for future\nreference. 1\nThe conclusion arrived at is that the\n\"\nmask \"\nseen\nbelow the medium's face was not nipped down under the chin,\nas it appears in the single views, but was really suspended im-\nmediately below her mouth, and that it was semi-transparent\nenough to enable her chin to be seen through it, and not above\nit. Also I called attention to the unaccountable difference between\nthe left eye (the observer's left) of the mask in Plate V. and\nPlate VI. In the former the mask or face appears to have the\neyebrows drawn down over the eyes as if in a frown, while in\nPlate VI. the left eye is much wider open and the eyebrow\ndrawn strongly upwards as if in a wide open stare, giving a very\n1\nThis more detailed report will be shown to any of our members who\nwish to read it. Ed.\n\f344 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922,\nlife-like and supercilious appearance. How the mask, if it had\nany appreciable weight, was supported from falling remains a\nmystery. An alternative hypothesis is that the mask was not\nreally there at the time, and that the two images were impressed\ndirectly upon the plates as psychic photographs, the intelligence\nresponsible having very crude conceptions of the appropriate\nrelative perspectives of the two views that would be required to\nmake the mask appear as if tucked under the medium's chin.\nThis is an hypothesis that is quite comprehensible and credible\nto those who are convinced, as I am, of the reality of psychic\nphotographs and their being also manifestations of ideoplastic\nenergy, but will certainly be repudiated by those who are not*\nThese latter will then be obliged to accept the first hypothesis\nof the mask being real and objective and suspended in some\nunknown manner from the medium's mouth. Personally I incline\nto accept the first hypothesis, chiefly because the notes of the\nsitting state :\n\"\n7.30 p.m. a thing somewhat similar in shape to\na child's bib is seen hanging from the medium's mouth \"\n;\nand\nagain,\n\"\nW. said that the thing looked like a picture in chalk\ndone on paper.\" There are other apparent discrepancies between\nthe two views of the mask on which it would be rash to form\ndefinite conclusions without comparing together either the two\noriginal negatives or two transparencies carefully prepared from\nthem.\nShould these weird materializations be finally established as\ngenuine in the minds of many other scientific men besides Prof.\nCharles Richet and Dr. Geley, there is no doubt that the latter\nis right in anticipating that a radical revolution in biology and\nin the theory of variations in evolution must inevitably follow.\nThe reign of creative intelligence and of final causes (so ably\nadvocated by Paul Janet in his book Final Causes, 1883) will be\nrestored in our scheme of Nature to the discomfiture of the\ngrosser Materialism.\nH.

Correspondence. :H.~>\nbeen experimentally produced, do not exhaust all evidence to the\ncontrary.\nIn 1900 Pere Coconnier, a French Dominican, published a book\nentitled Hypnotisme Franc, in which he repudiated the Satanic\norigin of hypnotism, then commonly believed in devout circles in\nFrance.\nIn it he describes a visit he paid to Dr. Charcot's institute\neither at Nancy or in Paris. The doctor hypnotized a girl on\nwhom he had frequently experimented, and as a result of some\ndiscussion between him and the priest, told the girl that he wanted\nher at the end of 2 hours to sweat blood in the form of a cross\nwhich he would draw on her wrist or forearm. He drew the\ncross with a pencil, bound up with linen that portion of the arm,\nand left her in a state of hypnosis. After 2 hours the doctor\ncame back, undid the bandage in the presence of the priest (Pere\nCoconnier). There was the cross perfectly visible.\nDr. Charcot next proceeded to show that the same thing could\nbe done instantaneously, and again putting the girl under hypnosis\ntold her this time to sweat blood actually while he drew the\npencil across her arm. They both watched and Pere Coconnier\nsays that this time the cross was not so perfectly clearly marked,\nbut it was nevertheless uninistakeably on the arm. Of course,\nstrictly speaking, this is not Stigmatization, but these two experi-\nments show its possibility.\nIt is unfortunate that Pere Coconnier's book is now out of\nprint, and it is not to be found in the British Museum. It\nappeared as chapters in the Revue Thomiste somewhere about\n1898-1900, and is so far as I know the only book on Hypnotism\nwhich has been written by a Catholic priest.\nF. M. CHARLTON.\n2. To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, Without for a moment pretending to assert that the\nproduction of bleeding stigmata by hypnotic suggestion is im-\npossible, I am still inclined to adhere to the doubt expressed in\nmy paper (Proceedings, S.P.R., XXXII., 200-202). It is not\ndisputed that\n\"\ndermographisme\n\"\nas the French call it, is common\nenough. The hypnotizer traces a simple pattern on the skin of\nhis subject and suggests that after a certain interval the pattern\nwill stand out in vivid red. At the time indicated there is great\n\f346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922.\ncongestion of the capillaries beneath the epidermis and the pattern\nis clearly seen. No doubt a few cases are on record in which a\nslight exudation of blood has taken place, probably through the\nsweat ducts. I think these cases are rare, if\nonly from the fact\nthat one always gets referred back to the same experiments with\nLouis Vive at La Rochelle in 1885 (Myers, Human Personality,\nI., p. 497, with references). In the Biggs case (ib., p. 493) there\nwas bleeding alleged on one Friday out of about 20, but Dr. Biggs\nwas not present at it. Moreover, he only wrote his account from\nmemory six years afterwards, and it is admitted that the girl was\ninclined to rub the part indicated. Miss Charlton's instances\nseem to me even more inconclusive. The evidence is third hand,\nwhile date, locality and exact references are all entirely wanting.\nBut granted even that bleeding may occasionally occur under\nhypnosis, I should be inclined to lay a good deal of stress upon\nthe fact that in the cases adduced there is no wound, no laceration\neven of the epidermis. In the more notable examples of religious\nstigmatization we have gaping wounds, both in the palms of the\nhands and in the soles of the feet, where the integument is wont\nto be exceptionally thick. These wounds sometimes remain open\nfor years, sometimes heal in an incredibly short space of time,\nreopening periodically, but always without any trace of sup-\npuration.\n1\nMr. Hubert Wales suggests that scientists like Charcot\nand Pierre Janet may have been deterred from more often pro-\nducing such bleeding stigmata out of consideration for the pain\nor inconvenience caused to the patient. But why should it not\nbe part of the hypnotic suggestion that the wounds should open\npainlessly and heal rapidly ?\n1\nThe following extract from a report of Dr. Wesener, dated Sept. 8th,\n1815, after one of his visits to the stigmatized Sister Emmerich, is in-\nteresting : \"I found the invalid exceedingly weak but cheerful, her hands\nand feet bleeding. The wounds on the back of the hands are round and\nabout as large as a small coin, the edges slightly puffed up, but without\ninflammation. One thing that seemed to me remarkable, though perhaps\nof little importance to any but a physician, was a slight excoriation at the\nlower joint of the right forefinger. This excoriation was inflamed and a\npurulent liquid had collected under the epidermis in three different places.\nI asked if she had scratched it with a needle, and she told me that the\nday before, whilst wiping a tumbler, she had broken the rim and scratched\nher finger with it.

FLAMMARION'S CASE.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM, I find it difficult to agree with M. Flammarion's\nopinion of the coercive quality of the case reported by him in\nthe Revue Spirite, and quoted in the Journal -for March. 1\nAs\nevidence for survival, it appears to me to be in a definitely\ninferior class to such cases as that of the receipt for pomatum\n(Proc., Vol. XVII., pp. 181-2) and that of the note-book, recently\nreported by Mrs. Sidgwick (Proc., Vol. XXXI., p. 253 et seq.),\nwith, which it can, I think, properly be compared. The main\nweakness of M. Flammarion's case, to my mind, lies in the fact\nthat the information conveyed by the vision was of an incident\nwhich occurred after the death of the supposed communicator.\nTo regard him as the source of it, therefore, we should have to\nassume, not only that he has survived death, but that in his new\nstate he is\nequipped with some sort of clairvoyant power. In\nthose circumstances, the doctrine of parsimony of new causes would\nappear to require us to prefer the hypothesis of clairvoyance by\nthe living percipient. Of course, if we survive death, we may\nalso become possessed of facilities for observation in the physical\nworld far in excess of those we at present enjoy, but that sup-\nposition involves a further step, it piles a hypothesis upon a\nhypothesis : we have yet to prove survival.\nIt will be generally agreed, I think, that for ideally good\nevidence for survival of this type there are two main desiderata :\nthe information given should concern a fact (a) unknown to\nl\nJour. S.F.R., Vol. XX., p. 244.\n\f348 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922.\nanyone living, and (6) undoubtedly known in his lifetime to the\ndead person purporting to communicate. For my part, I prefer,\nto cases which fail in respect of (6), those which do not com-\npletely fulfil (a), so long as the fact is not known to anyone\ndefinitely and obviously en rapport with the medium.\nHUBERT WALES.\nEEVIEW.\nThe Witch-Cult in Western Europe. By MARGARET ALICE MURRAY.\n(Clarendon Press. 16s. net.) *\nMiss MURRAY has collected from contemporary sources a very\nlarge amount of evidence as to the practice of witchcraft in\nEngland and Scotland, with occasional references to France,\nFlanders and other lands. Impressed by the curious uniformity\nof the cult in places so far apart as Sweden and the Pyrenees,\nItaly and New England, and by the close connexion supposed to\nexist between witches, elves and fairies, she develops in great\ndetail and with great ingenuity the theory that witchcraft should\nbe regarded as the survival of a fertility cult once prevalent\namong the prehistoric inhabitants of the whole of Western Europe,\na cult which originated long before Christianity, and possibly even\nbefore Druidism.\nIt would perhaps have been well if Miss Murray had given more\nevidence, apart from witchcraft, of the prevalence of a uniform\nreligion over so large an area of Europe, and had explained more\n'fully how it was that the pre-Christian fertility cults survived in\ntwo such very different forms as witchcraft, which was from the\nearliest times banned by the Church, and the Maypole dances and\nsimilar rites, which were until the advent of the Puritans regarded\nas innocent.\nThese, however, are matters for anthropologists. Psychical\nResearchers will heartily welcome a book which presents in so\ninteresting a fashion the available evidence on a subject which\nmust always appeal to them owing to the similarity between the\nphenomena reported in the case of medieval witches and modern\nmediums. The similarity is of kind rather than degree, for the\ngreatest feats of levitation reported in recent times appear paltry\ncompared with the powers of flight universally credited to the\nancient witches. In this connexion however it is interesting to\nnote that\n\"\nthe number of cases vouched for by the persons who\nactually performed or saw the feat of riding on a stick through\nthe air are disappointingly few,\" and that the drugs with which\nthe witches anointed themselves when preparing to fly are stated\nto be of a nature which, by their action on the heart, would\ncause the sensation of flying. It is to be feared therefore that\nthe phenomenon must be relegated to the category of what our\nFrench colleagues call la metapsychic subjective. W. H. S.\n\fNo. CCCLXXXVIII. VOL. XX.

A Disclaimer. sr.l\nSome of the copies of this circular bear the words \"\nExposure\nissued by the S.P.R.\" The Society has no kn<>\\\\l<'<l<_'' of the\nperson by whom, or the circumstances in which the circular\nwas issued, or as to the matters alleged therein, and repudiates\nall responsibility with regard to it.\nTHE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE SOCIETY.\nAN APPEAL.\nIN their last Annual Report the Council pointed out that\nthere was a danger of the Society's activities being severely\nlimited by lack of funds, and this statement resulted in more\nthan one Member of the Society making generous donations\ntowards its expenses. But these donations are not sufficient\nto meet the case, and as the exact position may not have\nbeen grasped by all Members and Associates, the Council think\nthat the time has come to issue a formal Appeal for further\nfunds, together with a statement of the considerations which,\nin their opinion, make the Appeal necessary.\nI. The Society is at the present time faced with the heavy\nexpenditure incidental to the move to its new premises. The\nCouncil consider themselves very fortunate in being able to\nsecure such excellent new quarters as are to be found at\nNo. 31 Tavistock Square, and they feel considerable confidence\nthat eventually, though not immediately, the annual cost of\nthe new premises will prove to be lower than that of the old,\nespecially as the rent of the Hanover Square rooms would\nhave been considerably raised had the lease of them been\nrenewed. But the cost of the move itself will not be light.\nBesides the furniture, a large number of books, papers, etc.,\nwill have to be removed, and a certain quantity of new\nfurniture will have to be purchased.\nIn addition to these expenses the cost of dilapidations at\n20 Hanover Square will have to be met. As, moreover, the\ntenancy of the Tavistock Square house commenced at Mid-\nsummer, 1922, and that of the Hanover Square rooms does\nnot expire till Lady-Day, 1923, there will be a period during\nwhich the Society will be liable for rent under both leases.\nThe Council estimate that the change of quarters will cost\n\f352 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.\nthe Society 300, and as the Society's income is barely\nsufficient to meet current expenditure, they appeal to Members\nand Associates for donations to meet this necessary outlay.\nII. Opportunities at the present time for the investigation of\n\"\nphysical phenomena\n\"\nare specially favourable. Reports of\nextreme interest have been published in foreign journals regard-\ning\n\"\nphysical\n\"\nmediums in different continental countries,\nwhose phenomena the Council would very gladly investigate.\nUntil recently there have, however, been two difficulties, the\nfirst one of personnel, the second one of expense.\nThe first has been removed by the appointment as Research\nOfficer of Mr. Dingwall, whose wide reading in all kinds of\npsychical literature, together with his knowledge of the practical\nmethods by which\n\"\nphysical phenomena\n\"\ncan be simulated,\nqualify him exceptionally for the post. The second obstacle,\nthat of expense, still remains to be surmounted.\nAs our Members and Associates will be aware, Mr. Dingwall,\nby the courtesy of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, was recently\nenabled to witness at Munich demonstrations of remarkable\nphenomena associated with a physical medium. In accepting\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing's invitation, notwithstanding the\nshortness of funds, the Council were confident that their action\nwould be in accordance with the general wishes of the Society.\nThe results of the visit, though undoubtedly important, cannot\nbe regarded as final, and the Council are most anxious that a\nthorough and prolonged study of the same medium should, if\npossible, be undertaken, and they have reason to believe that\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing would give every facility for this.\nIn view, however, of the great strain thrown on the Society's\nfinances by the increased cost of printing and by other\nincreases in cost due to the war, the Council are faced by this\ndilemma :\nthey must either forgo these and other investigations\nwhich ought to be undertaken, or they must realise invested\nfunds to pay for them. This latter course, however, the\nCouncil would adopt only with great reluctance, because the\nrealisation of capital must still further restrict the Society's\nresources for carrying on its investigations in the future.\nThe dilemma can be avoided, if an annual sum of 250\nwere guaranteed for a period of three years. A guarantee of\n\fOCT., 1922. The Financial Position of the Society. 353\nthis amount would not only secure a proper investigation of\nthe phenomena in question, but would also place the Society\nin a position to make full use of the services of its Research\nOfficer in other directions. In inviting subscriptions towards\nthis guarantee, the Council wish to make it clear that any\namount raised in this way would be specially earmarked,\nand devoted exclusively to meeting the cost of original\ninvestigations carried out by the Research Officer under their\ninstructions.\nDonations towards the cost of removal, and subscriptions\nand contributions towards the Research Guarantee Fund should\nbe sent to the Hon. Treasurer,\nW. H. SALTER, Esq.,\n31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1.\nOBITUARY NOTICES.\nI. MR. H. ARTHUR SMITH.\nBY SIR WILLIAM BARRETT, F.R.S.\nIN the death of Mr. H. Arthur Smith, at the age of seventy-\nfour, the Society has lost not only a former President, but one\nof the oldest and most valued members of its Council. For\nsome years before his passing to the unseen Mr. Arthur Smith\nhad suffered from a serious illness which compelled him to\ngive up all work ;\nhe was tended with loving devotion by his\nwife, and died at Ewell Park Nursing Home on Sunday,\n14th May, 1922. He was bom in 1848, the third son of\nGeorge Smith, J.P., LL.D., of Camborne ;\nhis brothers were\nWilliam Bickford Smith, for many years M.P. for Helston,\nand Sir George Smith of Truro, who died recently. He was\neducated at Wesley College, Sheffield, matriculated in honours\nat the London University in 1865, graduated B.A. in 1874,\ntook his LL.B. with honours in 1875, and the same year took\nhis M.A. and won the gold medal in Moral and Political\nPhilosophy, one of the highest competitive distinctions of the\nUniversity. In 1878 he was called to the Bar and practised\nas an equity draftsman and conveyancer ;\nhis published\nprofessional works are much esteemed, and include such\nwell known works as the Principles of Equity and the Married\nA2\n\f354 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.\nWomen's Property Acts. In 1871 he married the daughter\nof Mr. Alfred Budge of Camborne, who survives him. Three\nof their children also survive, one daughter and two\nsons, the elder of whom is Rear-Admiral A. Gordon Smith,\nC.M.G., R.N.\nIn his younger days he was a prominent amateur cricketer,\nregularly playing for the Wanderers and sometimes for the\nSurrey County Second Eleven, and always a warm supporter\nof the Surrey County Cricket Club. His recreation was divided\nbetween cricket and music ;\nhe was a good violinist, a first-\nclass clarionet player, and a valued member of more than one\namateur orchestral society. In politics he was always a con-\nsistent Conservative, and with his brother Sir George Smith,\nwas among that small band of Tory Nonconformists who\nstrongly supported the late Lord Salisbury.\nSo reserved and diffident was Mr. Arthur Smith that few\nknew of his strong religious convictions and active religious\nwork. In 1870 he became a class leader in the Wesleyan\nMethodist Church, subsequently a local preacher, and was\namong the active workers and speakers at the West London\nWesleyan Mission. He was also one of the editors of the new\nWesleyan Methodist hymn book, and published two volumes\nof religious addresses, entitled The Divine Parable in History\nand Things New and Old.\nWho would have supposed that a man with such strong con-\nservatism and religious opinions, and with such a critical legal\ntraining, would have become one of the earliest supporters\nand strenuous workers of our Society. He joined the S.P.R.\nas a member soon after its foundation in 1882, became a\nmember of the Council in 1883, and on the death of Mr. Calder\nhe became, at the request of the Council, the Hon. Treasurer\nof the Society in 1888. This was no sinecure, for he had no\nassistant, and for thirty-one years he threw his heart into the\nwork of the Society ;\nthe present writer can speak from\npersonal knowledge of the incessant and laborious service\nMr. Arthur Smith freely rendered to the Society. When ill-\nhealth compelled him in 1917 to resign the post, the Council\nunanimously passed the following resolution :\n\"\nThe Council desire to place on record their great regret\n\fOCT., 1922. Obituary Notices: Mr. H. Arthur Smith. 355\nthat Mr. Henry Arthur Smith has found it necessary, owing to\nill-health, to resign the post of Honorary Treasurer of the\nSociety for Psychical Research which he has held for thirty-one\nyears. They feel that to his zeal and devoted service much\nof the success of the Society is due, and much of the freedom\nfrom financial anxiety which the Council has enjoyed. It is\nhowever, not only for his work as Treasurer that gratitude is\ndue, but also for other important assistance as a Member of\nthe Council. The Council hope that they may still have the\nbenefit of his help in this way in the future.\"\nFrom time to time the Council had expressed their great\nindebtedness to Mr. Smith not only for his work as Hon.\nTreasurer and member of the Finance Committee, but in par-\nticular to him, in conjunction with Mr. S. C. Scott also a\nvery old and valued member of the Council of the Society and now\na Vice-President for the large amount of time and labour which\nthey devoted to carrying through the incorporation of the\nSociety, and the business connected with Mr. Kay's legacy,\nand for their kindness in saving much expense which would\notherwise have been\n\"\nunavoidable.\nIn 1910 Mr. Smith became President of the S.P.R., and his\npresidential address, published in Vol. XXIV. of our Pro-\nceedings, includes a very valuable discussion on the meaning of\nthe term\n\"\nevidence\n\"\nas applied to psychical research in\ngeneral, and in particular to evidence of identity of communica-\ntions purporting to come from the dead.\nMr. Smith made several valuable contributions to our Society\nwhich were published in our Proceedings and Journal. These\ninclude the following :\nA Review of the Case of Lyon v. Home, July Journal, 1889\n(Vol. IV. p. 117).\nCases contributed or collected, Journal, Vol. XV. p. 324,\nJournal, Vol. XVI., p. 205.\nDiscussion of Mme.

THE REV. M. A. BAYFIELD.\nBY MRS. HENRY SIDGWICK.\nSINCE the last issue of the Journal the Society has sustained\na great loss in the death of the Rev. M. A. Bayfield on 2nd\nAugust. Mr. Bayfield joined the Society in 1890, and has\nbeen a member of the Council since 1912. He was a very\nregular attendant when health permitted, but he was not a\nstrong man, and for more than a year had been unable to\ncome up to London on account of illness. In the winter he\noffered his resignation, but, hoping for a recovery which never\ncame, he was persuaded to stay on. Those who served with\nhim know what a valuable member of the Council his ability\nand common sense, his interest in our work and willingness to\ntake trouble, and his clear view as to what constituted evidence\nmade him.\nMr. Bayfield's name often appeared in our Proceedings and\nJournal as a writer of reviews and of critical and argumenta-\ntive articles. His reviews in some cases were not mere notices\nof books, but substantial discussions of questions they raised.\nWhat he wrote was always worth reading, informed as it was\nby his literary ability and scholarly mind, and his power of\nhumorous sarcasm often made his criticism amusing. His last\ncontribution of any length to the Proceedings was, as our\nmembers will remember, a paper on\n\"\nSome Recent Cases of\n\fOCT., 1922. Obituary Notices: Rev. M. A. Bayfield. 357\nPremonition and Telepathy,\" for which he had carefully\ncollected the evidence. This was by no means the only case\nin which he had investigated for us the evidence for super-\nnormal occurrences.\nMr. Bayfield was also able to experiment in a direct manner\nhimself. He had at one time, I believe, had considerable\nsuccess in an attempt at thought-transference with some of\nhis pupils, but no detailed record of the results has, I think,\nbeen preserved. He also co-operated with Miss Verrall, now\nMrs. Salter, in table tilting experiments, of which notices have\nappeared in Journal and Proceedings. One striking case of\nwhat we should now call a book-test occurred on one occasion\nin 1903, and was described by Mrs. Verrall in a paper read\nto the Society in May, 1904 (see Journal, Vol. XI. p. 249).\nMr. Bayfield was also markedly successful in relieving pain\nand sleeplessness in the case of certain of his parishioners by\na method resembling that of Monsieur Coue, though practised\nbefore we knew of the latter. The cases are described in the\nJournal (see Vol. XV. p. 298).\nMr. Bayfield approached psychical research from the side of\ntelepathy with the living, of the truth of which he had\nbecome convinced, partly, no doubt, through his own experi-\nence. But it was some time before he accepted communication\nwith the discarnate as a fact ;\nand it was, I think, the\n\" Statius\n\"\ncase that finally decided him.\nIn what I have so far said, I have confined myself to Mr.\nBayfield's connection with our Society, and its work. But his\nactivities and interest were, of course, not limited to this, and\nfor a general account of these I cannot do better than quote\nthe interesting obituary notice which appeared in The Times\nof 4th August, for leave to reproduce which we are greatly\nindebted to the editor.\nThe Rev. Matthew Albert Bayfield, who died on Wednesday at\nHertingfordbury Rectory, Herts, aged 70, was a scholar of varied\ninterests who will be remembered for his novel theory of English\nprosody and for his championship of psychical research, as well\nas for his two headmasterships and his school editions of classical\ntexts.\nMr. Bayfield was born at Edgbaston in 1852, the son of a\n\f358 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.\nchartered accountant, and was educated at King Edward's School,\nBirmingham, and at Clare College, Cambridge, of which he was a\nclassical scholar. Leaving Cambridge with a high place in the\nClassical Tripos, he took Holy Orders, and became successively,\nbetween 1875 and 1900, a master at Blackheath School, Marl-\nborough, and Malvern College, and then Headmaster of Christ\nCollege, Brecon, and Headmaster of Eastbourne College. He was\na stimulating and enthusiastic teacher, and the editions which he\nprepared for use in schools of Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides,\nbased on the larger and more advanced editions of Dr. Leaf,\nProfessor Jebb, and Dr. Verrall, did much to place the results of\nthe best modern scholarship in an attractive form within the grasp\nof schoolboys.\nResigning in 1900 the headmastership of Eastbourne College for\nreasons of health, he became after a short interval rector of\nHertingfordbury. His interest in scholarship remained, however,\nas keen as before, although in later years he devoted himself to\nEnglish rather than to classical literature. A chance inquiry led\nhim to investigate the theory of English prosody, and, being\ndissatisfied with current explanations of the subject, he published\nin 1919 The Measures of the Poets, in which he boldly swept away\nthe generally accepted system and sought to substitute for the\ntraditional iambic base a trochaic system, by which he claimed\nthat every variety of English verse could be naturally explained.\nHe followed this in 1920 by a larger work entitled Shakespeare's\nVersification, in which he maintained that the abbreviations and\napparent elisions of the text were merely devices of the early\nprinter, and were not intended to affect the scansion of the lines.\nHis theory, which involved important changes in the generally\naccepted views of Shakespearian verse, aroused much interest, and\nhe was a frequent contributor on this subject to The Times\nLiterary Supplement, readers of which will remember his courteous,\nbut vigorous, style in controversy.\nMr. Bayfield was a man of varied interests. He was an active\nmountaineer, so long as health permitted, and a member of the\nAlpine Club. It was in one of his Swiss holidays that he made\nthe acquaintance of Dr. and Mrs. Verrall, an acquaintance which\nripened into a life-long friendship. In conjunction with Mr. J. D.\nDuff he wrote the memoir of Dr. Verrall, published after his\ndeath.\n\fOCT., 1922. Obituary Notices: Rev. M. A. Bayfield. 359\nAnother consequence of this friendship was the keen interest he\ndeveloped in psychical research. He was a member of the council\nof the Society for Psychical Research for many years, and con-\ntributed numerous articles to its Proceedings. Convinced, as he\nwas, on religious grounds of the survival of human personality,\nhe considered that scientific research had demonstrated, not only\nthe fact of survival, but also the possibility of communication\nbetween the dead and the living. He vigorously defended\npsychical research before the Church Congress, and in the pulpit\nand elsewhere he spoke frankly of his beliefs to his parishioners,\nholding that in this way he might best help them. He quoted\nwith much pleasure the saying of one of them that he had\n\"\ntaken\naway the fear of death.\"\nThe above account will give some indication of his many-sided\nactivity and enthusiasm. To his charm of manner, his sincerity\nof mind, and his warmth of heart his many friends can testify.\nHis wife (Miss Helen Boyes) died in 1918, and he leaves one son\nand one daughter. His younger son, Lieutenant Geoffrey Bayfield,\nwent down with his ship at the Battle of Jutland.\nPHYSICAL PHENOMENA RECENTLY OBSERVED WITH THE\nMEDIUM WILLY SCH. AT MUNICH.\n[Note. At the end of May, 1922, the Research Officer, accompanied by\nMr. Harry Price, a member of the Society, visited Munich on the\ninvitation of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing. The object of the visit\nwas to be present at a few sittings with the Austrian medium,\nWilly Sch., concerning whose phenomena the Society had received\nthe most favourable reports. On July 13th, 1922, Mr. Dingwall\nread a paper at a Private Meeting of the Society in which he\ndescribed the phenomena observed, and the following consists of\nan abbreviated version of that report. ED.]\nWE left London on Sunday morning, May 28th, and arrived the\nnext day in Munich, the first seance being arranged for the same\nevening. Before dealing with the phenomena we observed, permit\nme to tell you something about the medium and the general\nconditions. Sitting merely as privileged guests we made no\nelaborate investigations of any kind. All we did was to try to\nassure ourselves of the nature of the phenomena presented, by\nconfining our attention to those conditions which seemed to us\nthe most important.\n\f360 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.\nThe medium, Willy Sch., is a young Austrian of about eighteen\nyears of age ;\none of a large family, he was born in a small\nfrontier town near Simbach and is of humble origin. He first\nclaimed the attention of Baron von Schrenck in 1919, and some of\nhis early efforts in teleplastic mediumship are illustrated in the\nEnglish translation of the Phenomena of Materialisation in figures\n221-225. Besides the appearance of teleplasm, other phenomena\nsoon commenced, including telekinesis, and Baron von Schrenck,\nW 6 FT\no\nm\nPLAN or THE STANCE ROOM.\nA. Door to ante-room.\nC.

Windows, shuttered and curtained.\nseeing the importance of the manifestations, resolved to try to\nremove Willy from his rather unsatisfactory surroundings and\ntake him to Munich. In this he was fortunately successful,\nWilly having been in Munich since October 3rd, 1921 ;\nand being\nnow apprenticed to a Munich dentist, he gives about two\nsittings per week in the Baron's own laboratory. Here he has\ngiven nearly sixty seances from October, 1921, to the end of June,\n\fOCT., 1922. Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 361\n1922. Among the sitters have been twenty-seven German univer-\nsity professors, eighteen doctors and sixteen other savants. Some\nof these savants have attended sixteen to thirty sittings, and in\nsixty seances only three have been negative. Not one of these\nninety persons hitherto invited has put forward the supposition\nthat the medium is in any way normally responsible for the\nphenomena. The medium himself is of moderate height, slim,\ndark, and of average intelligence. He is very fond of outdoor\nsports, and I was assured by Baron von Schrenck that he is so\nfar normal in almost every respect. The seance room is the\nBaron's own private laboratory, of which we have a diagram here\nreproduced from his work on materialisation. The door P leads\nto the passage and washing basins. This door is of oak, opens\ninwards and has a turn bolt on the inside, besides a lock. The\nroom belw is part of the kitchen, whilst that above is a drawing\nroom. The back wall is an outside wall looking on the passage\nleading to a side entrance to the house. The door A leads to an\nante-room where the sitters assemble before and after the sittings,\nand has itself two doors, one to the passage and so to the other\nparts of the house, and the other to Baron von Schrenck's study,\nwhere the dressing of the medium takes place.\nLet me now briefly describe the general conditions so that you\nwill be able better to appreciate the phenomena when I come to\ndescribe them. The medium and sitters, who number usually any-\nthing from six to ten, gather in the ante-room before each sitting.\nAt the appointed time Dr. von Schrenck takes the persons who\nare to assist at the fore-control of the medium into his study,\nwhere the medium's black tights, dressing-gown and slippers are\nexamined. The gown and slippers are Dr. von Schrenck's own,\nthe former being worn only on account of the medium complaining\nof cold during the seances. After the examination is\ncompleted\nWilly enters, and having undressed, puts on the tights, which are\nin one piece, buttoning up the back. Then accompanied by the\ncontrollers the medium enters the seance room and takes his\nplace to the right of the room in front of the cabinet at about\nthe spot indicated on the plan. This cabinet is not used for\nthese sittings, being the one formerly employed in the Eva C.\nand other experiments. The control is of the simplest and most\nefficient character. Indeed it may be said that in no case of\nphysical mediumship has such a control been before attempted\n\f362 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.\nwith success. Fortunately for Baron von Schrenck the medium\ndemands a rigid control, and as in the demonstration sittings we\nattended the extrusion of teleplasm formed no part, an elaborate\nand minute searching was avoided at every sitting, thus con-\nsiderably simplifying an already easy task. The medium sits with\nhis back to the cabinet at about three and a half feet from the\ncurtains. Opposite to him sits one of the controllers who holds\nboth hands and either extends his legs so as to form a barrier\nbetween the medium's legs and the circle, or places his feet on\nthose of the medium. A second controller sits facing the circle\nand at right angles to Willy. He holds the medium's wrists\nor lower parts of the arms, whilst slipped over the sleeve of the\ntights, just above the wrists, are luminous bracelets which enable\nthe circle to see the position of the medium's arms at any time.\nIn addition to these measures the arm of the medium on the\nside opposite to the circle is outlined by luminous pins so that\nevery movement can be seen distinctly from any part of the\nroom. The doors having been locked the observers now take their\nseats in a horse-shoe formation, Baron von Schrenck occupying\nthe chair at the end of the circle away from Willy where he has\ncontrol of the apparatus and light regulator. The sitters join\nhands, the one next Willy's controller keeping either contact\nwith the shoulder or knee or actually holding the controller's arm.\nThus the only hand free in the circle is Baron von Schrenck's\nleft, so that there is in reality a sort of partial control of the\ncircle as well as of the medium. Lighting is obtained from red\nelectric lamps hanging in a chandelier over the side of the circle,\nremote from the medium and shaded by a piece of cardboard.\nThe light is rather poor, but sufficient to see a white, handker-\nchief lying on the ground at about three feet from the observers.\nWhen everything is ready the white light is put out, the red\nturned on and the seance commences.\nWilly is not hypnotised but falls spontaneously into a trance a\nfew minutes after the white light is turned out. The trance\nitself is of varying depths, being at first light and only occasionally\nbeing very deep. The head falls forward, the hands offer no\nresistance, and the feet remain still ; occasionally jerks and twists\nof the arms which often occur while phenomena are in progress\nare experienced, but I am not aware that any detailed physio-\nlogical investigations have been carried out as yet. During the\n\fOCT., 1922. Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 363\ntrance condition Willy usually speaks in a half whisper, controlled\nby a personality calling herself\n'\nMinna\n'\n;\nthus it is Minna to whom\nquestions are addressed and who gives instructions as to when the\nred light is to be increased or diminished.\nIn order to describe to you the phenomena we observed I\nshall take each sitting separately, and at the risk of some repeti-\ntion try to give you a vivid idea of the seances.\nAt the first sitting, besides Baron von Schrenck, his wife and\nourselves, there were present the Baron's son and his wife, General\nPeter and Herr Bartels, an artist. We were both present at the\nfore-control, and Baron von Schrenck asked me to hold the hands\nof the medium during the first part. I therefore sat opposite\nthe medium controlling his hands and placing my stockinged feet\nupon his, whilst General Peter controlled the wrists. The luminous\nbracelets and pins having been put on by the Baron, the lights\nwere turned out and the seance began. The medium, however,\nbeing unused to me, and possibly imagining that my attitude\nwas hostile, did not go into trance, and nothing occurred. After\na short interval the sitting continued, the Baron's daughter-in-law\ntaking my place as controller. Before describing the resulting\nphenomena I digress a moment to describe to you the method\nadopted by Dr. von Schrenck in order to isolate the objects to\nbe moved. He employs a cage made of black gauze of close\nmesh mounted on a black wooden framework. It measures roughly\n.5 feet high, 2 feet 2 ins. wide and 3 feet 1 in. deep. There is\nno separate floor, the sides and ends being brought flush with\nthe carpet, whilst over the top is flung a sheet of black cloth.\nOne end is\nreally a door swinging on linen hinges and, when\n.shut, connected to the main framework with staples and padlocks.\nIn the door, extending practically from side to side, is an opening\nin the gauze about 5J or 6 ins. in depth. This gauze cage is\nplaced in the circle, the end containing the opening away from the\nsitters and opposite the curtains of the main cabinet, the side\nnearest the medium being usually about three feet distant from\nhim. Within this gauze framework was placed a heavy four-\nlegged oblong oaken table, weighing approximately thirty-three\npounds and having a large luminous triangle of paper attached to\nits surface towards that end facing the circle. Before the sitting\nnow under consideration this table had been placed in the gauze\nenclosure, and now during the second part a rustling was heard\n\f364 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.\nnear the table as if the gauze walls were being brushed over with\na feather duster. Then some raps were heard on the table and\nit began to creak and move slightly, finally rising once or twice\non what were presumably the two back legs, and then coming\ndown with a loud thud on the carpet. Dr. von Schrenck then\nplaced through the slit in the gauze a clockwork musical box on\nthe table at the back near the gauze door. We had previously\nexamined this instrument and found it of ordinary construction\nand apparently quite unprepared. A small projecting and easily\nmovable lever started and stopped the mechanism, whilst winding\nwas accomplished by a longer lever with a lateral movement, an\noperation requiring two hands, since the spring was too strong to\nallow of its being wound up without a downward pressure being\nexerted at the same time on the top of the box. This apparatus,\nwithout being fully wound, was placed on the table and after a\nfew moments it began to play. Dr. von Schrenck then said that\nit would stop if asked to do so, and thereupon several of the\nsitters, including ourselves, tried the experiment, the result being\nthat the box in every case obeyed the commands given by the\nsitters. A small hand-bell with a luminous band round the lower\npart of the handle was placed by Dr. von Schrenck near the\ncurtains of the cabinet and about two feet from the medium. In\na few moments it was seen to move and the luminous band was\nnow and then obscured as if some solid object were handling it.\nSoon it rose vertically into the air to the height of, I should say,\nthree and a half to four feet and remained suspended, then began\nto swing from side to side, ringing loudly, being finally thrown to-\nwards the sitters and falling close to my chair. This ended the\nsecond part, and we all, including the medium, adjourned to the\nante-room for general conversation.\nFor the third part a new arrangement of the seance room was\nmade by Baron von Schrenck. The gauze cage was removed and\nabout one and a half feet from the curtains of the cabinet, equi-\ndistant from either end, was placed a small low table upon which\nwas a heavily shaded red electric lamp. The light was such that\na hand placed near it could be clearly seen when in a line with\nthe lamp, and the downward rays from the lamp enabled us to\nsee the surface of a small low wicker table, upon which was laid\na sheet of luminous cardboard and a luminous bracelet, which was\nplaced near the centre lamp. This small table was at least four\n\fOCT., 1922. Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 3G5\nfeet from the medium, the bracelet being placed on the side of\nthe table nearest to him. The table soon began to tilt and was\nthen completely levitated to the height of about a foot, finally\nfalling to the floor. This being again placed in position, the\nbracelet was suddenly twisted to the ground and then rose in the\nair and floated about at the height of anything from one to three\nfeet. It was noticeable how when being levitated, a part or\nparts of the bracelet were obscured, showing that a something had\nhold of it and was responsible for its movements.\nAnother experiment was attempted which also proved exceed-\ningly successful. The Baron placed a white handkerchief on the\nground near the back curtains and almost opposite the lamp.\nIt was soon seen to move on the floor and then rose up as if\nsupported by two fingers, remaining suspended for a few seconds,\ndirectly behind the lamp and clearly visible. Bobbing up and down\nrapidly several times it finally collapsed on the carpet. There\nthen appeared in the neighbourhood of the medium a luminous\narm-like shape with a tapering point. The other observers said that\nthis was an arm and hand, claiming to see the fingers, but neither\nof us were able to see this clearly either at this seance or at\nthe succeeding ones. After the disappearance of the hand the\nmedium again went into Dr. von Schrenck's study for the post-\ncontrol, at which we were present and which proved satisfactory.\nAt the conclusion of the sitting, and after having left Dr. von\nSchrenck, we discussed the phenomena and found that we agreed\nfully that the medium could not possibly have produced normally\nthe effects we had observed, and secondly, that if produced fraudu-\nlently a confederate must be assumed to be responsible. The\npossibility of a confederate was further strengthened on account\nof the nature of the phenomena. Certain manifestations that we\nwitnessed were strongly suggestive of what confederacy of a\ncertain kind might accomplish, and although it appeared incon-\nceivable that under the conditions obtaining at the seance a\nconfederate could gain entrance and produce fraudulent phenomena\nin Baron von Schrenck's own laboratory, we determined, in order\nto meet criticism, to make a thorough examination of the seance\nroom should the Baron permit us to do so. Accordingly, on the\nmorning of May 31st we visited Dr. von Schrenck, and he im-\nmediately gave permission, although with some amusement, which\nwe all shared, for a thorough inspection of the room. The\n\f366 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1022.\ncabinet was first taken down and the walls behind examined.\nThey were very dusty, and evidently the cabinet, being a fixture,\nhad not been disturbed for some time. The pictures were still\non the walls, and the space behind each was examined. The\nrooms adjacent to the seance room were then visited, the walls,\nceilings and floors inspected without finding anything which gave\nrise to the slightest suspicion.\nFor the next sitting, therefore, we asked merely for two favours.\nThe first was that the door P should be bolted, locked, sealed\nand signed by ourselves, and secondly, that one of us should be\nallowed to remain in the seance room from the time that the\nseance room was opened until the end. This was readily agreed\nto, and at the appointed time the same day the sitters assembled\nin the ante-room. They comprised ourselves and the Baronr\nthe Prince and Princess of Parma, Professor Zimmer, Professor\nGruber and Dr. Lebrecht. We first went into the seance room,\nsealed the door and examined everything again. Mr. Price\nstayed in the room whilst Baron von Schrenck, Willy, one of the\nsitters and myself went into the study for the fore-control. As\non this occasion I had asked the Baron to blacken the handle\nof the bell, particular attention was paid to the question whether\nany patch of black was observable on the medium before the\nsitting. He having washed his hands under our supervision,\nthe tights were put on and we all went into the seance room.\nThe medium made no objection to my controlling his hands,\nProfessor Gruber holding his wrists. The luminous bracelets,\npins and general arrangements were as before ;\nthe lights being\nout, the medium went into trance almost at once, his head\nhanging down almost into my lap. After what seemed only\na few minutes rustlings were heard in the gauze cage and the\nwhole structure was pulled round towards the medium. The\nlarge table then began to rise and thump on the floor, and the\nmovements were so violent that the control declared that a rent\nhad been made in the gauze, which was later found to be the\ncase. Loud raps sounded on the table and when the musical\nbox was placed on it the playing began almost at once, and then\nstarted and stopped at command. It was also apparently wound\nup, indicating two forces at work. The bell was placed near the\ncurtains and soon rose into the air, was rung loudly and then\nthrown with some force on to my lap.\n\fOCT., 1922.\nPhysical Phenomena observed at Munich. 367\nThe first part then ended and all but Mr. Price and myself\nretired to the ante-room. The blackening of the bell had been\nof little use, since Dr. Lebrecht, who was sitting next me, had\nremoved it and thus the smears on the handle were of little value.\nIn the second part I continued the control, Dr. Lebrecht taking\nProf. Gruber's place, the luminous band and arm-shape being again\nseen ;\nand in the third part phenomena took place similar to\nthose which had occurred in the first sitting. I changed my\nposition and sat next Dr. von Schrenck, who, having placed the\nshaded red lamp in position, put the little table with the luminous\ncardboard and bracelet upon it, just in front of us and directly\nunder the lamp. We soon heard a rubbing on the carpet like a\ncrawling animal. Then the table began to rock, rose about two\nfeet into the air, passed me and fell with a crash almost at the\nfeet of Mr. Price. On its being replaced, Baron von Schrenck\nand myself attempted to hold it down, he with his left hand and\nright holding mine, I with my right hand still holding the sitter\non the other side. The table however resisted our efforts, was\ndrawn towards the medium and then finally stopped, the beading\nat the top edge nearest the medium being pulled completely away\nand the nails wrenched out. Having been again placed in\nposition the bracelet was twitched off and thrown at the sitters.\nA white handkerchief was placed on the table with one end\ndangling over on the side nearest the medium, the distance being\nabout four and a half to five feet. I held the end on the table\nand the other free end was seized and pulled, the sensation being\nas if a hand had hold of the other end and was pulling it. Baron\nvon Schrenck then suggested that we should hold up the luminous\nboard about four feet from the ground, the luminous side away\nfrom the medium. We did so, and within a few seconds I felt\nsharp thumps and blows against the surface nearest the medium.\nIt was as if a small hand within a boxing glove were delivering\nthe blows, the board being almost knocked out of our hands.\nWhen the board was replaced on the table Dr. von Schrenck\nsuggested that the end of the rapping structure might show\nitself against the surface of the luminous card. This was done,\nbut very rapidly, and all that could be seen was a black pointed\nprojection similar to what the first three fingers of a hand would\nappear if\nthey were for a few seconds over a luminous sheet.\nAt the conclusion of the seance the seals were examined and\n\f368 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.\nfound intact, and an inspection of the room showed nothing\nunusual. The post-control, at which I was again present, proved\nnegative, and we were unable to discover any soot marks on the\nmedium's hands or elsewhere.\nThe third sitting took place on Friday, June 2nd, at 9.25 p.m.\nThere were present besides ourselves and the Baron, Professors\nBekker, Gruber and Kluge, General Peter, Drs. Marimowski and\nLebrecht. The fore-control was superintended by Dr. von Schrenck,\nProfessor Bekker and myself. We obtained the Baron's consent\nto try whether a dish of flour could be touched and an impression\nobtained, without informing the medium what had been planned.\nWilly was therefore asked to wash his hands thoroughly and the\ntights were examined for any white marks which might have been\nthere accidentally. The control during the sitting was varied.\nI did not control the medium myself, this being done by General\nPeter and Professor Bekker in the first part and by Dr. Lebrecht\nand Dr. Marimowski in the second, but the luminous bracelets\nand pins enabled the circle to see him during the whole of the\nsitting. The phenomena were more or less the same as before.\nMr. Price said that three times he felt a steady stream or draught\nof distinctly cold air blowing on his left, a sensation also experi-\nenced by Dr. Lebrecht, who was sitting next to him. The bell\nwas levitated and rung loudly and the large table tipped up\ninside the cage so that it fell forward on to the sitters, straining\nthe gauze and almost breaking it. The white handkerchief was\nplaced on the floor and was levitated as if\nby two stumps placed\nbeneath it ;\nthe small table was also levitated, and resisted Dr.\nvon Schrenck's and Professor Bekker's effort to hold it, being\nfinally broken in two places. At the conclusion of the sitting the\nflour was found to be touched in two places, but the spots were\nvery small, and during the post-control a cursory examination of\nthe medium revealed no trace of flour. This was the final sitting,\nand on the following Sunday morning we left Munich and returned\nto London.\nIn the preceding account of the phenomena occurring with\nWilly Sch. I have not attempted to give you any scientific or\ndetailed survey. The main object of our visit was to determine\nwhether, in our opinion, the phenomena might reasonably be\nattributed to supernormal agency. We made no elaborate tests\n\fOCT., 1922. Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 369\nor measurements, beyond making sure that the medium himself\nwas not producing the phenomena normally. Although the post-\ncontrol and fore-control would not have been in the least suffi-\ncient to prevent the medium from bringing objects into the seance\nroom with him, the control during the sitting effectively prevented\nany practical use being made by him of objects thus introduced,\neven if it be assumed that such objects were capable of producing\nthe phenomena, which is not the case. Confederacy alone, there-\nfore, had to be eliminated, and this we tried to do at the second\nsitting. The last refuge for the sceptic is that the seance room\nitself has been skilfully prepared with trap-doors and other open-\nings which in spite of diligent search we failed to discover. As\nthis naturally implies that the investigators themselves connive\nat the fraud, it is an hypothesis that we can scarcely entertain\nwith patience. The conclusion, therefore, at which we ourselves\nhave arrived, is that it is reasonable to suppose that the phe-\nnomena are in reality caused by supernormal agencies, the nature\nof those agencies being unknown.\nIn conclusion I would remind you that this case stands almost\nalone in the history of mediumship. With Palladino, the control\nwas difficult, and phenomena usually occurred within a short\ndistance from her, except on certain memorable occasions. With\nEva C. the control is even more difficult, especially as the quantity\nand magnitude of the phenomena tend to diminish in proportion\nto the strictness of that control. With Kathleen Goligher in\nBelfast, Dr. Crawford attempted the well-nigh hopeless task of\ncontrolling seven mediums, finally ending by controlling one, and\nher ineffectually. With Linda Gazzera the control was even\nmore difficult than with Eva C., and with Kluski as difficult as\nwith Linda Gazzera. Indeed, I cannot remember any medium\nwho submits to such a control as does Willy Sch. No knowledge\nof deception is really necessary as long as he sits for his present\nphenomena and not for teleplasm. Held as he is by two\npersons and outlined by luminous pins, escape is impossible and\nuseless were it possible. No friends of the medium are present,\nthe sitters comprising either savants or personal friends of Dr.\nvon Schrenck. The most powerful phenomena occur inside a\ngauze cage, the only side opening to which is away from the\nmedium and the sitters. The phenomena rarely occur near the\nmedium and are sometimes five feet distant from him. Con-\n\f370 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1022.\nfederacy alone is possible and that theory involves us in greater\ndifficulties than in accepting the manifestations as genuine. The\nsceptic's argument as to his inability to discover tricks does not\nmeet the case. It would meet it were Willy to sit for teleplasm,\nas Eva does, and the fore and post control were as they were\nwhen I was present. But held as Willy is he cannot possibly\nproduce these telekinetic phenomena normally. If the hands\nwere just laid on the controller's hands, substitution would be\neasy, if the arms were invisible. But the wrists are always\nvisible with the luminous bracelets, and the legs would be useless\neven if\nthey were not controlled. If the agency of the medium\nis excluded the only other hypotheses are hallucination, con-\nfederacy or collusion on the part of the investigators, sitters or\nothers. In the Journal for November, 1894, Sir Oliver Lodge\ndealt with similar objections in his report on the experiments at\nthe He Roubaud. Collusion, confederacy and simple lying were\nall examined and shown to be untenable. Although in the case\nof Willy Sch. the control is probably simpler and more effective,\nthe same hypotheses of collusion and confederacy will have to\nbe met and faced. The first is being partially refuted by Baron\nvon Schrenck by the device of inviting a large number of different\nsavants to see the phenomena for themselves and comment thereon.\nThe second will be met later by transferring the sittings to new\nquarters, probably to the University of Munich. Doubtless other\nobjections will be raised and will be dealt with as they appear.\nHowever monstrous these phenomena may appear to those persons\nwho are not acquainted with the mass of evidence now adduced\nin support of their reality, to ignore them is\nimpossible for the\nscientific man. In the case of the medium Willy Sch., the oppor-\ntunity is presented of again examining phenomena previously\nrecorded as occurring with other mediums, under conditions which\nscarcely ever obtain in mediumistic work.\nON THE MARKING OF TEST PLATES BY PREVIOUS\nEXPOSURE.\nBY SIR OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.\nWITHOUT explicit reference to any recent controversy, I have\nto report certain facts concerning the marking of plates, which\nmay be instructive to future experimenters.\n\fOCT., 1922. On the Marking of Test Plates. 371\nFrom July 26th to 28th, 1922, Dr. Allerton S. Cushman, of\nWashington, D.C., visited my laboratory, bringing with him\ntwo sealed packets of quarter-plates put up and prepared by\nthe Imperial Rapid Company, each plate said to be marked\nin one corner with dots by x-ray exposure in that Company's\nlaboratory : his object being to see if that method of marking\nwas quite reliable. I gather from a letter which I have since\nreceived from the Company that they agree it is capable of\nimprovement. Nevertheless, I record the result of the tests\nmade by myself and Dr. Cushman, with the help of my\nassistant, Mr. E. E. Robinson.\nVisibility of the Marks.\nEach packet on being opened was found to contain four\nplates, and on two successive bright mornings we exposed the\neight plates, giving a different exposure to each, the sitters\non both occasions being in a room with a North light such\nthat with Rapid plates about five or ten seconds would be a\nnatural exposure to give. But we wanted to see what would\nbe the effect of over-exposure, since it seemed likely that the\npreviously exposed spots would be the first portion to become\nover-exposed, and that accordingly they would be liable to get\nreversed with excessive exposure, and liable to vanish with\nmoderate over-exposure.\nThat is\nexactly what happened. The exposures we gave\nwere :\n5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 seconds respectively. On\nthe first three plates the spots were visible on the negative\nas dark spots, in fact were quite normal, though they were\nmost conspicuous on the plate exposed for only 5 seconds.\nOn the long exposed plates the spots were reversed, and were\nvisible as light spots. On the plates exposed for 15 and 20\nseconds the x-rayed spots had passed through zero on their\nway to reversal, and were quite invisible, except one on the\nscreened and unexposed extreme edge of the plate. Nor could\nthey be detected on the prints.\nQuestion of Uniformity.\nTo see how far such plates each set presumably cut from\none large sheet might vary in thickness, I weighed the plates\ncarefully to the nearest milligramme, that being the best mode\n\f372 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.\nof ascertaining their thickness with precision, since they were\nall of the same area and specific gravity. The weights came\nout as follows :\nNo. 1. 30.173 grammes. No. 5. 28.826 grammes.\n2. 29.581 6. 30.710\n3. 30.794 7. 30.772\n4. 29.600 8. 28.837\nthus showing that there was a variation of about 2 grammes\nin 30, or say 6 per cent, maximum difference of thickness in\nthis set.\nTo avoid misunderstanding I must assert that I do not put\nthese facts forward as contesting Mr. Price's conclusion con-\ncerning the nature of the plate on which an extra was obtained\nduring his visit to 59 Holland Park. I have reason to believe\nthat this plate was not one of the set which he had taken\nwith him ; though as to the manner and reason of the sub-\nstitution I have no special information.\nREVIEW.\nPsychic Phenomena and the Law.

He will be pleased to make appointments to see\npeople who cannot call at these hours.\nTHE POLTERGEIST CASE AT LEDAIG, ARGYLESHIRE.\nIN January, 1920, a series of disturbances were reported as\noccurring in a small cottage near Ledaig, a hamlet in Bender-\nloch, Argyleshire. The alleged phenomena appeared to be\nconnected with two of the children of the family of seven,\nwho lived with their father and mother in this remote country\ndistrict. The two children, Malcolm and Ian M ,\nwere\nabout thirteen and nine years of age respectively when the\nmanifestations commenced.\nThese consisted in rappings, the breaking of tables and\ncrockery, the levitation of the children themselves, and similar\nphenomena. Several persons visited the family, and soon the\nmanifestations changed somewhat in character, becoming more\norderly and easy to control. The children began to give\nsittings to investigators, without asking any remuneration\nwhatever for their services.\nThe case was investigated by some members of the Glasgow\nSociety for Psychical Research, who, upon two occasions, had\nthe children to Glasgow, and held a series of sittings. The\nresults were not particularly satisfactory, and although some\nof the Committee believed the table movements obtained to\nbe supernormal, there was no general agreement in the matter.\nTowards the summer of 1922 further developments took\nplace.\n\"\nVoices\n\"\nhad been heard for a considerable time,\nbut the\n\"\ncommunicators\n\"\nwere shy, avoiding strangers and\nany investigation. Later, however, they became stronger and\nMalcolm became a \" direct voice medium,\" being controlled by\nan entity calling herself\n\"\nJanet,\" or in greater detail Janet\nMacGregor, late of Kinloch. This person was supposed to\nhave been a servant at one time in the M 's house at\nLedaig, but she was not able to give many details about her-\nself. The younger child, Ian, then became controlled by\nanother entity called Dundas Campbell, who professed to have\nlived in Madrid. According to the investigators' reports the\n\f376 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

He was\naccompanied by his wife, and seven sittings in all were attended.\nThe\n\"\nphenomena\n\"\nconsisted in voices, direct writing on paper\nplaced between Malcolm and Ian, raps, tips of the table and\nlevitation of Malcolm. All the phenomena were of the most\npuerile possible character, and no evidence whatever was\nobtained that the children have even the weakest mediumistic\npower. When control conditions were imposed the phenomena\nceased absolutely and nothing occurred. The performances do\nnot warrant any detailed description in these pages. A full\nreport is in preparation for the Society's files, where it may\nbe seen on application.\nTWO BOOK-TESTS.\nI.\nThe following report of a book-test has been received from\nMrs. Drummond, as we will call her here. A report on some\nincidents which occurred at sittings held by Mrs. Drummond\nwith Mrs. Leonard has already been printed in the Journal\n(Jour. S.P.R., Vol. XX., p. 128 ff.).\nThe peculiarity of the present case is that the first state-\nment about the test was obtained at one of the Rev. C.\nDrayton Thomas's sittings, and the book was in his house. On\nthe page originally mentioned Mrs. Drummond could find nothing\nrelevant, but through table-tilting at home she obtained in a\nmessage purporting to come from her husband a correction of\nthe page. Not only did this second page prove relevant, but\nat a sitting Mrs. Drummond had with Mrs. Leonard just after\nshe had obtained the correction at home, but before she knew\nof the relevance of the page thus given, a reference was made\nto the same topic as was referred to in the corrected book-test.\nThus there appears to be a consecutive train of thought\n\fNOV., 1922. Two Book-Trf.\nrunning through (a) a statement at Mr. Drayton Thomas's\nsitting, (6) a statement received by Mrs. Drummond in her\nown home, (c) a statement made in Mrs. Drummond's sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard. All the original letters on this case which\npassed between Mrs. Drummond and Mr. Drayton Thomas\nhave been seen by us, but we only print below such extracts\nas seem necessary to bring out the evidence.\nMr. Drayton Thomas's sitting with Mrs. Leonard, at which\nthe first statement about the book-test for Mrs. Dnimmond\nwas made, took place on December 9, 1921. On December 17,\nand again (more fully) on January 10, 1922, Mr. Thomas wrote\nto Mrs. Drummond giving particulars of the matter contained\nupon page 3 of the book in his own library which he had\nidentified as being referred to in the test, this book being\nVia Crucis. On January 17, 1922, Mrs. Drummond wrote to\nMr. Thomas as follows :\nI thank you very much for your letter and for copying out\np. 3, but I cannot find anything apposite in a personal way.\nI have read the poem over several times. I asked my husband\nabout it at home and he said the book was right but the page\nwas wrong ;\nit should have been p. 8. It seems so very difficult\nto put a test right when it has gone wrong that I have not\nmuch hope of p. 8, but if, and when, you have time you will\nlook it up, I will be very much obliged. I go to Mrs. Leonard\nthis afternoon, but thought I would send you this note before\nmy sitting. . . .\nOn January 24, 1922, Mr. Thomas sent Mrs. Drummond a\npassage from p. 8 of Via Crucis, thus :\nTHE SPIRITUAL ATHLETE.\nPart 2.

NOV., 1922.\nDear [Mrs. Drummond],\nI have above typed out page 8 of Via Crucis. It\nstruck me that the last lines about boxing might possibly link on\nto some personal memories ;\nindeed I have some recollection of\nyour mentioning something of that kind in connexion with your\nson. . . .\n(Signed) C. D. THOMAS.\nIn this passage Mrs. Drummond found a striking relevance\nto memories connected with her husband and her son, the two\npurporting communicators at her sittings with Mrs. Leonard.\nHer statement on this point and in regard to the statement\nmade at her own sitting on January 17, 1922, was contained\nin a letter to Mrs. Salter, thus :\nFebruary 11, 1922.\n... I now give you an extract from my sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard, 17th January, 1922, at 3 o'clock.\nMr. Arthur [Mrs. Drummond's husband] says\n\"\nperhaps you\ncan remember afterwards there was one pursuit of lan's\n[Mrs. Drummond's son] that I had been rather proficient at\nwhen I was young, but had dropped in later life.\" He had\nnot done it since he was very young, not done much, but\nknown to be good. It was something Ian thought lie had\nshone in. Ian thinks he was awful clever, and he was too.\nMr. Arthur had done it, but was not able to go on, when he\nwas a young man. They would like you to remember after.\n\/\/ Mr. Arthur had kept on,\n\"\nperhaps he would have been\nbetter than I was, Mum. He might have been, but he didn't\nkeep on.\" Feda don't think Ian thinks that really, but he\nis trying to be polite.\nI was rather surprised at this mention of boxing, as they had\nalready mentioned it at other sittings. ... My husband, when he\nwas at College, and perhaps just before he went, took up boxing\nand was considered very good, but had to give it up, as he\ncouldn't afford the time. Feda's remarks don't apply to shooting,\nfishing, golf, tennis, or anything else he did. Ian, our son, was\na very fine boxer, and won the Public Schools Boxing Cup after\nonly a few months' training. When he went to New College,\nOxford, he was made Captain of the Boxing Club and won\neverything he went up for, except once, and he certainly\n\"\nshone.\"\nThat wouldn't apply to any other pursuit, though he was quite\n\fNOV., 1922.

To me it is all quite clear, and the last\nverse of\n\"\nThe Spiritual Athlete\n\"\nis singularly apposite, as he has\nspoken through Feda of boxing with his father, and finding him\nquite a good opponent, etc. . . .\nI have never read Via Crucis, nor had the book in my\nhand, and, as far as I know, have never seen it. I have looked\nthrough the books in this house, and it isn't here.\n[L. D. DRUMMOND.]\nII.\nWe have also received the following report of a book-test\nfrom Miss H. A. Dallas. The letter from Sir Oliver Lodge\nfrom which she quotes appeared in the March Journal (Vol.\nXX., p. 249). Since the test was obtained at a\n\"\ntable\nsitting,\" it is, of course, possible that Miss Dallas's friend,\nS. G., may have had some unconscious recollection of the\nposition of the books in the shelf. But it is to be observed\n(see below) that not long before the sitting the books had\nbeen re-arranged by another person. The statements made for\nthe identification of the passage were quite definite, and the\npassage indicated was, Miss Dallas tells us, extremely apposite\nto the circumstances in which the test was given.\nMiss Dallas's report is as follows :\nMarch 31, 1922.\nIn the March issue of the S.P.R. Journal Sir Oliver Lodge\nsays :\n\"\nThe only way in which book-tests bear upon the question\nof survival is as to the matter selected and the manner in which\nit is introduced and applied to the right people. This part of\nthe evidence remains still strong in my judgment, quite apart\nfrom the mere power of reading.\"\nThe first book-test I received seems to me valuable from this\nstandpoint ;\ntherefore I send the record written from notes taken\nat the time.\nOn Sept. 8, 1917, I visited Mrs. Leonard in London with a\nfriend who was at that time living in the country. Mrs. Leonard\nhad never been in her house, and, I believe, she had never seen\nmy friend before this date.\nI use the initials\n\"\nS.

On return-\ning that evening to my friend's house we found that the 4th book\non the 3rd shelf of the large dining-room bookcase was a small\ndarkly bound book which had belonged to her mother; it was ;m\nold book which formerly belonged to her mother's father, so it\nwas distinctively her mother's property, not her father's. It was\na hymn book, and on page 12 was a hymn which S. G. used to\nrepeat to her mother, when she was a child. There were five\nshelves, so the 3rd was the same when we counted from top to\nbottom and from bottom to top. There were two smaller book-\ncases on either side which I thought were joined to the large\none ;\nbut I found that this was not so. The big case \\\\ as\nseparate ;\nit was this bookcase, evidently, which we were t >\nsearch.\nS.

MILLS, I.C.S.\nPaper read on March 7th, 1922, at a Private Meeting of the\nSociety.\nI AM going to confine my remarks this afternoon to that section\nof the hill-folk of Assam which is known by the general name\nof Nagas. These people inhabit the mass of hills lying between\n\f382 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1022.\nAssam and Burma, and comprise a number of tribes which speak\ndifferent languages and show considerable diversity of custom.\nThey are of mixed origin, and it is impossible to say with certainty\nwhat elements have entered into their composition, but they\ncertainly contain a considerable Mongolian strain. Though those\nof them who are administered at all are subjects of the Indian\nEmpire, I want you to realise that they are totally unlike the\nIndians with which most people are familiar. They are wild\nand picturesque savages, and confirmed head-hunters save where\nthey are under our control. Their dress is\nscanty and their\nornaments magnificently barbaric, reminding one far more of New\nGuinea or some South Sea Island than of Hindustan.\nBut I do not want to waste your time with a general de-\nscription of their dress and habits, but to draw your attention\nto a peculiar belief held by them. It varies in form somewhat\nin the different tribes, but roughly speaking it is that certain\nmen, and more rarely women, have the habit of projecting their\nsoul into a leopard or tiger, retaining meanwhile their human\nform, and that these persons are so intimately connected with\nthe animal selected that an injury to it involves an injury to\nthe owner of the soul occupying it. I have not found any account\nof an exactly similar belief elsewhere in the world, and I should\nbe very glad if\nany one here can give, me any other examples.\nMr. J. H. Hutton read a paper on this subject before the Royal\nAnthropological Institute which was published in their Journal for\nJanuary-June, 1920. He also gave a full account, with examples,\nof this belief in his monograph on\n\"\nThe Sema Nagas,\" which\nMacmillan and Co. published last year. I have made great use\nof this account in order to refresh my memory, for I did not\ncome home expecting to be asked to read a paper. But I have\nsome personal knowledge of the matter, having acted for three\nand a half years as Subdivisional Officer of Mokokchung, the area\nwhere Mr. Hutton collected most of his material. Many of the\nmore notorious leopard-men of the hills are our mutual acquaint-\nances.\nI spoke just now of a man \"\nprojecting his soul\n\"\ninto a tiger\nor leopard, and I must say a few words on the Naga theory of\nthe soul. He believes in what Sir J. G. Frazer calls the\n\"\nex-\nternal soul.\" A man's soul may easily become detached from his\nbody. It wanders in dreams, or it may be captured by an evil\n\fNOV., 1922. The Were-Tigers of the Assam Hills. 383\nspirit, in which case the owner becomes ill till it can be induced\nto return. If, of course, the soul goes on right away to the\nLand of the Dead, the owner dies, but the temporary loss of one's\nsoul is a trivial matter. I should say that the average Naga\nloses his soul at least once a year. The proper ceremonies will\ninduce it to return.\nYou may ask why tigers and leopards should be the usual\nrecipients of a man's soul. The probable reason is the peculiarly\nclose connection believed to exist between tigers and men.\nAccording to Naga folk-lore a man, a spirit and a tiger were\nthe three children of one mother. The man preferred his meat\ncooked, the spirit just dried his in the smoke, and the tiger ate\nhis raw. These differences led to everlasting squabbles and\neventually the family split up. But tigers are still held in great\nrespect, and among the Angami Nagas, for instance, if a tiger be\nkilled mourning is proclaimed in the village for the death of an\nelder brother. Further, I ought to mention that leopards and\ntigers are hardly distinguished. One generic term is used for\nboth, words meaning\n\"\nlittle\n\"\nor\n\"\nbig\n\"\nbeing added if the\nspeaker wishes to be precise.\nI come at last to my main subject. I have said that the\nvarious tribes hold rather different beliefs about leopard-men (or\ntiger-men, as the case may be). Among the Chang Nagas you\nhave one type. Here it is always the tiger which is associated\nwith this belief, and one whole clan the Hakyung clan consists\nof tiger men and women. The story goes that at the time of\nthe Universal Deluge all men and animals were crowded on to\nthe tops of the highest mountains. Tigers claimed victims from\nall clans except the Hakyung clan, who thereupon acknowledged\nthemselves to be the adopted children of the tiger people, and\nhave been tiger-folk ever since. Among the Lhota Nagas you\nfind another very distinct type of this belief. Here every medicine\nman is ipso facto a leopard or tiger-man. But his soul is not\nbelieved to enter into the animal, which is merely a sort of\n\"\nfamiliar.\" But a medicine-man will suffer from any injury\ninflicted on his\n\"\nfamiliar.\" The ordinary type of the belief is\nfound among the Sema Nagas, and as leopards and tiger-men\nare commonest in this tribe all I am about to say refers to them,\nunless I definitely say that I am taking examples from elsewhere.\nIt is sometimes said that the affliction is catching, and that a\n\f384 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1022,\nman can become a leopard-man by habitually consorting with a\nleopard-man. It usually happens, however, that the symptoms-\noccur in a man willy-nilly for no apparent reason. It should be\nclearly understood that no one wants to become a leopard-man.\nIt is a most infernal nuisance. For one thing it is\nexceedingly\nfatiguing, for the man is exhausted by the activities of his leopard.\nFor another thing, leopard-men are always getting into trouble.\nSuppose I am a leopard-man. My leopard goes and kills some-\none's pig. The owner of the pig rather naturally comes and\nabuses me. Not only that, but, if he can, he will shoot or\nspear rny leopard, in which case I shall die.\nIt is said that in some cases a man's soul will remain absent\nin his leopard for two or three days at a time. In such cases\nthe man will go about his usual business, but is lethargic and\nincapable of speaking coherently. Usually, however, his soul only\nleaves him during sleep and returns to him in the morning.\nIt is said that while his leopard is hunting the man's limbs\ntwitch. Or he may even become violent, and a case is known\nof a man biting his wife very severely. One man complained to\nme that when his leopard killed he used to wake up with a taste\nof raw meat in his mouth, and find pieces of flesh between his\nteeth. It is strongly held that the man has knowledge of what\nhis leopard does, and in the morning can direct searchers to the\nkills for the owners of animals killed are naturally anxious to\nsave what they can from the wreck. As an illustration I will\ntell you some stories of Zhetoi, a Sema youth of Sheyepu village,\nwhom I know well. He suddenly, to his great distress, became\na leopard-man in the early spring of last year, and I had a\nlong talk with him before I came home on leave. One night\nhis leopard killed a calf. The owner searched everywhere for it\nnext day, but could not find the carcase. He accordingly asked\nZhetoi, who told him that the search party had been very near it,\nbut had missed it because his leopard had dragged it up into a\ntree growing out from the hillside, and they had passed under\nthe tree without looking up. The search party returned to the\ntree and found the carcase of the calf in the fork. On another\noccasion, I was told, Zhetoi's leopard killed a pig at Sakhalu-\nNagami, a neighbouring village. Sakhalu, the chief of the village,\nfollowed it up with his dogs. The dogs got far ahead and one\nof them, did not come back. Sakhalu sent word to Zhetoi, who\n\fNOV., 1922. The Were-Tigers of the Assam Hill-.\nwas able to tell him exactly where his leopard had killed tin- dog.\nThis leopard became a perfect nuisance at Sakhalu-Nagami. and\nSakhalu spoke to me and to Zhetoi strongly on the su !]. t.\nOne day he collected the men of his village, and succeeded in\nsurrounding the leopard. While the hunt was in ]>n\nmessage came from Zhetoi begging them to let the leopard escape\nas its death would involve his own. On another occasion Sakhalu\nhad a shot at the leopard at dusk while it was trying to drag\noff a pig. Early next morning a message came from Zhetoi to\nsay that he would be glad if Sakhalu would refrain from shooting\nat him. It is to be noticed that Nagas do not travel at night,\nso that it was very improbable indeed that there had been any\ncommunication between the two villages from dusk to dawn.\nOne notes that Zhetoi seems to have been aware of what was\nhappening to his leopard during the day as well as at night,\nwhen his soul was supposed to be in it. I questioned him closely,\nbut Zhetoi could not tell me how he was aware of the actions of\nhis leopard. He said he just knew. All tribes hold that the con-\nnection between a leopard -man and his leopard is closest at the\ndark of the moon. But some sort of connection is believed to\nbe continuous. Hence if\nyou can wound a man by \\vounding\nhis leopard, you can impede the movements of a leopard which\nyou wish to hunt by tying up the man to whom it belongs. An\nexcellent example of this belief came to the notice of Mr. JECutton.\nI will give his account of it. On one occasion the elders of a\nlarge Aonaga village (Ungma) came to him when he was Sub-\ndivisional Officer of Mokokchung for permission to tie up a certain\nman in the village while they hunted a leopard which had been\ngiving a great deal of trouble. The man in question, who was,\nby the way, a Christian convert, also appeared to protest against\nthe action of the village elders. He said that he was very sorry\nthat he was a were-leopard, he didn't want to be one, and it\nwas not his fault, but seeing that he was one he supposed that\nhis leopard body must kill to eat, and if it did not both the\nleopard and himself would die. He said that if he were tied up\nthe leopard would certainly be killed and he would die. To tie\nhim up and hunt the leopard was, he said, sheer murder. In the\nend Mr. Hutton gave leave to the elders to tie the man up and\nhunt the leopard, but told them that if the man died as a result\nof killing the leopard, whoever had speared the animal would of\n\f386 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1922.\ncourse be tried and no doubt hanged for murder, and the elders\ncommitted for abetment of the same. On this the elders unani-\nmously refused to take advantage of Mr. Button's permission to\ntie up the man.\nOne result, it is believed, of the intimate connection of a\nleopard or tiger-man with his animal is that he can call it and\nlet others see it at will. I must confess that I have never\nsucceeded in\npersuading anyone to do this for me. For one thing,\nleopard-men hate being questioned about their failing. They are\nashamed of it, and very touchy on the point. They are nervous\ntoo lest their leopard should be shot, with disastrous results to\nthemselves. But I have heard many stories from reliable infor-\nmants of leopards being summoned at will. Mr. Hutton gives\nseveral instances, and I have heard similar accounts. One day\nsome Aonagas from Susu who were sitting drinking at Ungrr\nlaughed at a leopard-man of the latter village. He told them that\nas a proof of his powers he would cause them to see his leopard\nat a certain point on their way home. They saw the leopard\nsure enough at that very spot and got a good fright. Khusheli,\na Sema woman of Litsammi, is a well-known leopard-woman.\nHer husband, a Sangtam Naga, did not believe in her powers, so\nshe convinced him by showing him her leopard. As he was\ncoming home one day a leopard appeared first in front of him\nand then behind him on the path. He ran and the leopard\nchased him up to the edge of the village. His wife laughed at\nhim when he arrived frightened and perspiring, and asked him\nif he had seen a leopard. Mr. Hutton was able to obtain inde-\npendent accounts of a particularly good instance from the two\nmen concerned Inaho, chief of Melahomi, and Inato, chief of\nLumitsami. The former is a well-known tiger-man and an\nacquaintance of mine. The latter died before I went to Mokok-\nchung. While these two were travelling together down a jungle\npath Inato persuaded Inaho to show him his tiger. Inaho there-\nupon dropped behind and a tiger sprang out into the path in\nfront of Inato, who raised his gun and fired in the excitement of\nthe moment. Luckily he missed and the tiger jumped aside and\ndisappeared. But Inaho has never again taken the risk of\nshowing his tiger to anyone.\nI have said that an injury to the leopard or tiger involves\nan injury to the man to whom it belongs. Wounds are believed\n\fNOV., i)2-j. The Were-Tigers of the Assam Hill*. 3s?\nto appear on the human body corresponding to wounds on tin;\nanimal body. Kiyezu, chief of Kiyezu-Nagami, shows marks on\nhis leg which he says are the scars of wounds inflicted many\nyears ago by a sepoy of Wokha outpost on his leopard, \/ukiya\nof Kolhopu showed Mr. Hutton some fairly fresh marks above\nhis waist which he said corresponded to shot wounds received by\nhis leopard about two months previously. Sakhuto of Khuiyi also\nshowed Mr. Hutton a fairly fresh wound. It should be under-\nstood that the wound on the human body does not app'-ar\nsimultaneously with that inflicted on the animal, but some days\nlater, when the man has learnt of the condition of his leopard or\ntiger. This point is illustrated by an incident which occurred\nin March, 1919, and of which I heard immediately afterwards.\nWhile Mr. Hutton was in camp at a village called Melomi, one\nof his Angami interpreters while wandering round with a gun met\na large tiger. He fired and wounded the animal, hitting it rather\nfar back. The beast got away, however. It was said, more in\njest than in earnest, that the tiger was really a man-tiger. This\ncame to the ears of Saiyi of Zumethi, a subordinate in the Civil\nWorks Department, but a tiger-man withal. He announced to his\nfriends that his tiger had been wounded, and took to his bed.\nThree days later he was met by Nihu, head interpreter of Kohima,\nbeing carried in to Kohima on a stretcher for treatment in the\nGovernment hospital. Nihu, who is a most intelligent and entirely\nreliable man, told me that he questioned and examined Saiyi, who\nsaid that he was suffering terrible pains in the abdomen owing\nto the wound inflicted on his tiger, and showed an inflamed\nswelling on either side of the stomach, corresponding, of course, to\nthe entrance and exit holes of the bullet which had hit the tiger.\nHe eventually died in Kohima hospital.\nIn theory in Naga theory, I mean, a leopard or tiger man can\nsave his life if he can get another animal after his has been\nkilled. But I have never known an instance of this. The\nunfortunate man always seems to die. I have mentioned Sakhuto,\nchief of Khuivi ;\nhe came to his end in this way. Sakhalu of\nSakhalu-Nagami shot a leopard which was supposed to belong to\na man of Kukishe. Sakhuto of Khuivi said it was his, however,\nand to show how firm was his belief he sickened and died a\nfortnight later. Cowardly, mean-minded men are said sometimes\nto have a leopard-cat for their familiar instead of a leopard or\n\f388 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1922.\ntiger. A man of Lizutomi was returning home one night when\nhe heard that his leopard-cat had been killed at Aichisagami, a\nvillage some miles away. He fell down and died on the spot.\nI should like to tell one more story which is now part of the\nhistory of Mokokchung. It is particularly interesting because Mr.\nHutton was on the spot and able to take down the facts, which\nhe records in his monograph on the Sema Nagas. The big Ao\nvillage of Ungma managed to ring a family party of tigers which\nhad been killing their cattle. Mr. Hutton was sent for and went\nto take part in the hunt. The old tiger broke out early and\ngot away. At this point there arrived Chekiye of Lukammi, a\nman who had the reputation of being a tiger-man, though he\nwould never admit it. The tigress broke and mauled the man\nnext to Chekiye, but was turned.\nChekiye made no attempt to spear the tigress when she broke\nwithin a few feet of him. When remonstrated with he said,\n\"\nI\ndid not like to spear her as I thought she was probably a friend\nof mine.\" When she was eventually shot he said she was the\ntiger of a woman of Murromi, a village which the Semas say lies\nfar to the east, and where all the men and women are tiger-folk.\nProbably it is mythical, but the country in question has never\nbeen explored. Meanwhile three miles away at Mokokchung an\nAo named Imtong-Lippa of Changki was giving a curious exhibition\nin the house of one of the hospital servants. He became\n\"\npossessed\n\"\nand raved and said he was one of the tigers which\nwere being hunted. He described the hunt as it was going on\nand said that one of the tigers had been wounded, but that he\nhimself had only been hit by sticks thrown by the beaters.\nHe rolled up a mat and laid it on the floor to represent the\nfence which the beaters had built to assist them to drive, ac-\ncording to the usual Naga method. He himself jumped six times\nover the mat. drank about a small bucketful of water, and ate\nginger. (Among the Semas if a were-tiger is being hunted the\nrelations of the man concerned sometimes stuff him with ginger\nin order to make his animal more active and better able to\nescape.) Imtong-Lippa eventually said that three tigers, including\nhimself, had escaped, but that a tigress, whom like Chekiye he\nidentified with a transfrontier woman, had been speared in the\nside and had been left behind in the beat and would die. As a\nmatter of fact four tigers (though Chekiye said there were six)\nwere seen in the beat. Of these three escaped and the tigress\nwas speared in the neck, failed to get out of the beat and was\nshot. This account of Imtong-Lippa's performance was taken\ndown by Mr. Hutton from eyewitnesses the same evening.\nIt is no series of carefully regulated experiments that I have been\nexpounding, but a few facts connected with a curious belief held\nby a little-known people in a remote part of the world.

Also that the\nsealing of the envelope in which Mr. Moger put the packet\nof plates to send to the S.P.R. was ineffective in itself, and\nwas rendered useless as evidence owing to the fact that the\nsix seals had all been broken and damaged.

DEC., 1922.\nCASES.\nWE print below three incidents in which information was\nobtained at sittings concerning matters about which the sitters\nhad no normal knowledge at the time.\nI.\nL. 1236.\nFor the striking incident which we print below it is not\npossible now to obtain corroboration. Nevertheless we think\nit worth while to put it on record here, because the sitter,\nwhom we will here call Mrs. Barker, has from time to time\nfurnished us with very good evidence obtained at her sittings\nwith Mrs. Leonard and we have reason to believe her a\nthoroughly accurate and trustworthy recorder. Her motives\nfor desiring to be anonymous in this particular instance will\nbe readily understood. Mrs. Barker's account of the incident\nwas enclosed in a letter to Mrs. Salter, as follows :\nApril 1st, [1921].\n... I am sending you an account of very good evidence which\nI had in my first sittings with Mrs. Leonard. I have never\nsent it before because I took no notes at the sittings. I was\nquite new to investigation, and I am afraid my frame of mind\nwas such that I was only seeking for personal conviction. I\nwrote an account of it afterwards and I believe what I send\nyou to be an accurate statement, but I cannot corroborate it\nwith my notes taken before the information was confirmed.\nI told Miss Newton about it one day, and she said she would\nlike me to send it in nevertheless. The word\n\"\nKismet\n\"\ncoming\njust in the way it did was really very remarkable. ... If you\nthink the enclosed is of value and wish to record it, I would\nrather not have my name given. I could not have it discussed\nby name, as I am quite sure you will understand.\n[E. BARKER.]\nMRS. BARKER'S STATEMENT CONCERNING SITTINGS WITH\nMRS. LEONARD, JANUARY-FEBRUARY, 1916.\nThe circumstances were :\nI received the official telegram to say that my husband had\nbeen killed in Mesopotamia. T wrote to the India Office to ask\n\fDEC., 1922. Ca\nif\nany details had been received as to whether he had 1 --n\nkilled instantly or had died of wounds.\nThe reply was that they had had no information beyond the\nbare casualty list. No details could be given till the mails of\nthat date arrived.\nI then cabled privately to the regiment to ask for details by\nreturn cable. The telegram did not get beyond Basra for some\nweeks.\nFrom the above it will be seen that the information given\nthrough Feda, as follows, could not have been known to any\nperson in England.\nI went to Mrs. Leonard for the first two or three sittings\nbefore the mail arrived. Mrs. Leonard was not then sought\nafter as she is now, and it was possible to get a sitting without\nan introduction or appointment. I was entirely anonymous\nto her and had no introduction, nor did I write for an appoint-\nment. I was just a passer-by who stopped at her door on chance\nof getting a sitting. I gave no name either at the first or\nsubsequent sittings when I got the following information. I had\na wonderfully vivid sitting in which a great deal of private\nmatter was given unknown to others but known to me. [My\nhusband's] initials W. B. were given and then the following\nfacts concerning his death. They were unverifiable at the time,\nas I have shown.\n1. Feda said : \"He is very anxious that you should know he\ndid not suffer. He was not killed instantly, but died about\nthree-quarters of hour after he was hit. But he was unconscious,\nso he did not suffer. He says you will get this verified, for\nhe was carried to the rear and was buried. He was not\n'\nmissing.'\nor prisoner. You will get his things sent to you, his watch and\nthings he had on.\"\nVerification. The General wrote to me that he was present\nwhen my husband was carried in. He said he was not killed\non the spot, but died within the hour, during ^which time he was\nunconscious, so he could not have suffered. He was buried the\nsame evening. His things were all sent to me, his watch and\nthe things he had on him, cigarette case, letters, etc.\n2. At the next sitting Feda said :\n\"\nHe is particularly anxious\nyou should know he did not suffer. He is afraid there may be\na muddle in what is told to you. He was unconscious. He\n\f396 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1922.\nhad two wounds, one in the chest and one in the throat. (She\nhesitated a good deal about the latter and then said :) Yes, Feda\nis sure he says two. Chest and throat, but it was the wound\nin the chest that killed him, his lung was pierced.\nVerification. A letter was sent to me to see written by a\nbrother officer to a friend in which he said :\n\"\nColonel [Barker]\nwas shot in the chest and throat.\"\nThis officer was badly wounded in the head soon after and\nhad sun-stroke and has lost all memory of that time, so he\nhas been unable to tell me how he got this very definite informa-\ntion. 1\n3. The last point is particularly striking. I asked Feda if\nhe could tell her if he had time to know he was mortally wounded\nbefore he became unconscious. She said :\n\"\nWell, he just had\ntime to feel like a blow knock him over and he just said to himself\n'Hallo, it's come then.' He says a foreign word, 'Kismet,' he\nsays,\n'\nKismet.'\n\"\nVerification. Three years later in December, 1919 one of\nthe officers of the regiment came home on leave for the first time\nduring the war. He came to see me and asked if I had any\nquestions I would like to ask him. I said I thought all that\nwas known had been written to me except one point which\nI had never been able to clear up. Had my husband any\ninterval of consciousness during which he knew that he was\nmortally wounded ? The Officer (Colonel B.) replied that when\nmy husband fell a native orderly ran to him. Col. B. questioned\nthe man afterwards (the regiment was advancing, so no officer\ncould stay to go to him at the moment). The orderly said the\nColonel just looked up and said\n\"\nKismet, carry me out,\" and\nthen became unconscious.\nWe think it worth while to put this incident on record\nin spite of the fact that no contemporary record is available,\nbecause quite apart from this incident we have reason for\nbelieving that (a) Mrs. Barker is an unusually good witness\nand (b) Colonel Barker is an unusually successful communi-\ncator. It will be realised that it is quite impossible that\nMrs. Barker should have unintentionally given away the\nX\nA11 the officers of his regiment were either killed or wounded within a\nvery short period, which made it very difficult to get any first-hand infor-\nmation or any definite details.\n\fDEC., 1922. Cases. 397\nrelevant facts at her sittings, because they were entirely\nunknown to her at the time.\nWe print below a statement from Mrs. Sidgwick\nMrs. Barker's accuracy as a witness :\nQC(\nThe Editor has shown me the very interesting case she has\nreceived from Mrs. Barker concerning her husband's death. It\nis of course much to be regretted that no notes were taken at\nthe time and that no corroboration is available. I should like,\nhowever, to say that Mrs. Barker is known to me personally and\nalso by correspondence about psychical matters, and that I regard\nher as an excellent witness, careful, accurate, and with a clear\ngrasp of what constitutes good evidence. I think it unlikely\nthat her memory has played her false as to the closeness of\ncoincidence between Feda's statements and the facts afterwards\nlearnt. ELEANOR MILDRED SIDGWK K.\nWe also print a letter from Mrs. Barker in reply to a question\nas to whether she could say when her notes of what had\noccurred at the sittings with Mrs. Leonard were made, and\na corroborative statement from Mrs. Barker's sister-in-law, to\nwhom the statements made at the sittings were told before\nany verification had been obtained.\nLetter from Mrs. Barker.\n^ ^ lm\nI am sorry I cannot say exactly when I wrote down the\naccount of my first sittings with Mrs. Leonard. It was very\nsoon after getting the verification, but not before. I was so\nmuch struck by the evidence that I was anxious to record for\nmy children, and so I am sure I wrote it very soon.\nI kept the proof notes [of the report printed above] till\nto-day,\nas my sister-in-law Miss [Barker] was coming to stay with us\nand I thought you might like to have a letter from her. She\nis my husband's eldest sister. I was seeing her almost daily\nat the time of his death and when these sittings took place.\nShe is\nquite sure that she remembers my telling her these details\n'before they were verified. E. BARKER.\nLetter from Miss Barker.\nNov. 15th, 1922.\nMy sister-in-law has shown me your proof notes. I thought\nperhaps you might like to know I was seeing her almost daily\n\f398 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1922-\nat the time these sittings with Mrs. Leonard took place, and\nwe discussed them at once, and as far as I can remember what\nshe told me then exactly tallies with the account given in these\nnotes.\nI remember her telling me about it most definitely before the\nverification. L. E. [BARKER].\nII.\nL. 1237.\nThe following case was sent to us by a Member of the Society\nwhom we will here call Mrs. Drummond ;\nthe incident occurred\nat one of her sittings with Mrs. Leonard. Other incidents\nfrom Mrs. Drummond's sittings have already been printed\nin the Journal. (See, e.g., Jour. S.P.R., Vol. XX., p. 128.)\nWe print first an extract from Mrs. Drummond's con-\ntemporary record of her sitting :\nSITTING WITH MRS. LEONARD, June 14, 1921.\nFEDA. Have you got some money in a drawer ?\nMRS. D. I don't think so.\nPEDA. Are you sure ? It's rather important. Ian [the\nsupposed communicator, Mrs. Drummond's son] says :\n\"\nMum, I don't want to tell you a prophecy about\nlosing it, not that at all.\" He thought he saw a\ncoin in a drawer, quite lately, but he says : \"Be\ncareful, Mum, there was such an important date\n*\non it. I couldn't see exactly, but this date means\nsomething to me and to Mum. It is important,\nand especially appropriate to me and Mum. Look\nfor it. It is with other things, it isn't all alone.\nMum darling, it is an important date. I knew it\nin a very personal sense too ; you will apply it.\"\nMRS. DRUMMOND'S COMMENT.\nA few days after I got back to H -\n[Mrs. Drummond's\nhome] I quite unexpectedly came upon a halfpenny in a drawer.\nIt was at the very back of the drawer, covered with veils and\ngloves', and on it was the date 1902, the date my son went first\nto a preparatory school. I don't keep loose coins in any drawer.\nThere was no other coin there, nor in any of the other drawers.\n\fDEC., 1922. Cases.\nThe above statement is corroborated by Mrs. Drummond's\ndaughter, thus :\nI certify this to be correct. M - L .\nIn a letter to Mrs. Salter Mrs. Drummond comments furthrr\nupon the incident, thus :\nJuly 26, 1921.\n. . . What makes it [the above incident] very good in my\nopinion is that my son's preparatory school is often in my mind,\nbecause there is one near here and the boys go to the same\nchurch that I do, and whenever they pass my seat, I think of\nhim and his first term at C , Sept. 1902. When I got down\nhere after the sitting I saw in a small silver tray on a chest of\ndrawers 2 farthings. One had a date that I thought was 1902.\nIt was rather indistinct and I wasn't sure, so I asked my daughter\nwho said it was 1909. I thought the test was a failure, as\n1909 conveyed nothing to me. So sure was I that no coins\nwere in a drawer that I never even looked. About two days\nlater I was looking in a drawer for a veil and right at the\nback, completely covered by veils and gloves, I came upon a\nhalfpenny with the date 1902 on it. I at once went for my\ndaughter who came and saw it and saw there were no other\ncoins in the drawer. . . .\nI have just examined all the coins in my purse and out of\neleven coins with legible dates there are none with 1902.\nL. D. [DRUMMOND]\nIII.\nL. 1238.\nWe print below a further incident which occurred at the\nsittings with the ouija board held by Mr. and Mrs. J. F. C.\nKimber and their friends ;\nsome earlier incidents were printed\nin the Journal for January of this year (Vol. XX., p. 191).\nThe names and addresses of all the persons concerned are\nknown to the Society, but by request we use pseudonyms\nor initials here except in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Kimber.\nThe sitters on this occasion were Mr. and Mrs. Kimber's\ntwo friends, Mrs. Ellis and her sister, Mrs. Dixon, who also\ntook part in the earlier experiments. Neither Mr. nor Mrs.\nKimber were present during the sitting but, as stated below,\n\f400 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1922-\nMr. Kimber saw the record two days later before the verifica-\ntion was obtained.\nMr. Kimber's account of the incident was contained in a\nletter to Mrs. Sidgwick, thus :\nChristmas, 1921.\nI think you will be interested in the extract below which came\nthrough at a sitting at Mrs. [Ellis's] house the other day . . .\nExtract from sitting in the evening of Dec. 4, 1921.\nSitters :\n[Mrs. Ellis and Mrs. Dixon].\nNote-taker : Miss K.

And in answer to enquiries writes :\nDec. 7, 1921.\nOn Sunday, Dec. 4, I was baking cakes and was feeling\nvery fussed over one that was in the oven, and I felt it was\ngoing to burn. I told the maid to take it out of the oven\nand she forgot, and it did burn.\nThe above sitting took place in the evening of the day on\nwhich the cake was burnt, 200 miles away. . . .\nJ. F. C. KIMBER.\nIn a letter to Mrs. Sidgwick, dated December 30, 1921, Mr.\nKimber gives K. W.'s name and states that she was privately\nengaged to 0. S., the supposed communicator at the sitting.\nIn a further letter Mr. Kimber writes :\nJan. 4, 1922.\n... As regard the\n\"\nCAKE BURN \"\ntest, the sitting was on\nDec. 4th, and I saw the notes on the 6th ;\nK. W.'s letter is\ndated Dec. 7th. . J. F. C. KIMBER.\n\fDEC., 1922. Notes on Periodical^. 401\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Psychological Bulletin for January, 1922, is\nmainly taken up\nwith its abstracts of periodical literature and book reviews. Tin-\nRevue Philosophique for May and June contains an article by\nJ. Wahl on William James, as seen in the pages of his corre-\nspondence, a paper which is to be continued in the following\nnumber.\nPsychische Studien for May has an appreciation of Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday by\nGeneral Peter ;\nan account by Herr Grunewald of his experi-\nments with Nielsen in Copenhagen, and the first of two articles\nby Count von Klinckowstroem on Indian tricks. He begins by\nbriefly reviewing some of the literature dealing with the tricks of\nthe East, including the Mango Tree Trick and the Basket Trick.\nIn the second part, which appeared in Psychische Studien for\nJune, he prints an account of the Rope Trick from the record of\nDr. Schonbrunn, a Viennese lawyer, who wrote to him on July\n16, 1921. The latter says that on a certain occasion in December,\n1904, he found himself in the native town of Ahmedabad and met\nthere a great crowd of people together with a fakir. The fakir\nhad a long beard, his head was shaved and he was splashed with\ncow dung. Hoping to see the rope trick, Dr. Schonbrunn en-\ncouraged the fakir, who, grinning and beckoning to him, slowly\nled him to a kind of rude platform. Still laughing the fakir\nsuddenly made a quick movement and to his surprise the lawyer\nsaw that the fakir had a rather thick handful of rope. Then\nturning to the crowd a small naked boy came running up, and\nthe fakir turning his grinning face once more, showed the rope\nand then threw it suddenly into the air. To his astonishment\nDr. Schonbrunn did not see the rope fall down but saw that it\nwas apparently suspended in space hanging down to within about\na foot from the ground. Thinking he was being hypnotized, he\ndug the nail of the middle finger of his right hand into the palm\nof his left and felt the pain and saw the characteristic half-moon\nimpression.\nThe fakir then made a sign to the child, who climbed up the\nrope at great speed. Thinking that he alone was being influenced\nthe lawyer glanced at the crowd below and noticed that they\nwere all\ngazing up to the end of the rope as he had done himself.\n\f402 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1922.\nAfter a few seconds the fakir made further signs and the child\nagain reappeared as if\nspringing from the rope to the ground,\nfinally disappearing into the crowd.\nPointing out that photography alone would solve the question\nof hallucination in these Indian tricks, the article continues with\nan account of some hypnotic experiments conducted by Fritz\nPaulsen in Vienna some two years ago. In these experiments\nthe rope trick was said to be duplicated by the hypnotist, who\ncaused more than one person to see the phenomenon as it is\ndescribed in India.\nIn the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research\nfor June is published the continuation of the case of Mrs. West,\nwith an account of some more of her remarkable and puzzling\nvisions. Mr. Hayward contributes a few notes on methods of\nfaking spirit photographs, whilst Dr. Prince has a wise note on\nthe evidence for the supernormal as illustrated by the Cushman\nspirit photograph taken by the English medium, Mrs. Deane.\nThe Occult Review for July has a brief account of the artist\nand astrologer John Varley, an article on the mysticism of Shelley,\nand some notes on exorcism as applied to haunted houses.\nThe Revue Metapsychique for May and June contains the reply\nby Professor Richet to Sir Oliver Lodge on the spirit hypothesis,\nan article on light as seen in living animals and plants and several\ntranslations from papers appearing in Light and elsewhere.\nIn the French journal UOpinion for July 8, 1922, appears\nthe report of the Sorbonne Committee on the phenomena of\nEva C. The idea of the sittings appears to have originated with\none Heuze, a French journalist, who persuaded Madame Bisson\nto allow the medium Eva to be investigated by a Committee from\nthe Sorbonne comprising Drs. Lapicque, Dumas, Pieron, and\nLaugier. Fifteen sittings had been arranged, of which two had\nto be abandoned owing to the indisposition of the medium. The\nresults were almost negative, only a small quantity of saliva being\nobserved and a portion of whitish substance which she appeared\nto swallow almost immediately. In their conclusions the Com-\nmittee pay respect to the good faith and enthusiasm for scientific\ninvestigation displayed by Madame Bisson, but regret that their\nresults must be considered as entirely negative. The conclusion\nis fully justified by the facts. The press, however, took the\nresults as an exposure of the medium and published a garbled\n\fDEC., 1922. Notes on Period i< 4<>3\naccount of the Committee's findings. In subsequent issues of\nL'Opinion Paul Heuze continues to discuss modem psychical\nresearch in a manner which would lead one to suppose his desire\nwas to cast ridicule upon the whole subject. The articles\ntranslated into English and appeared in the Daily Tel&jnijti-\nJuly 15, 22, 29 ; August 5, 14, 19, 28 and September 4 and 12.\nThe American Society's Journal for July contains the con-\ntinuation of Dr. Walter Prince's survey of the case of Mrs. West,\nin which a sitting for raps is described, which Dr. Prince believes\nto have been very striking. In the August issue appears Dr. Prince's\nreport on the poltergeist case near Antigonish in Nova Scotia. He\nfound evidence of probable dissociation in the girl, but apparently\nconcludes that certain sounds and tactual sensations experienced by\ntwo visitors to the house were supernormal. In the same number\nis a brief review of the experiment recently conducted with the\nCrewe Circle, and an account of certain coincidental and other\nexperiences recorded by Helen J. Clarke. The September issue\ncontains an article by Mr. Blewett Lee on Mediumship and the\nCriminal Law, and also an amusing example selected by the\nEditor as an illustration of the differences between Spiritualists\nand Psychical Researchers.\nIn Psychische Studien for September Hofmann discusses Darget's\nexperiments on the V Rays, whilst in the October number A. \\Y.\nSellin notices instances of what he describes as\n\"\nferromagnetic\n\"\ninfluences on watches. Schwab has also an article on the sympa-\nthetic nervous system ;. whilst Dr. Lebrecht translates Dr. Geley's\naccount of his experiences with the clairvoyant, Stephan Ossowiecki.\nThe October number of Psychic Science has an article by Sir\nConan Doyle on the Fox Sisters, in which he compares their\nmediumship with more modern mediums ;\nan article by the\nPrincipal of the British College of Psychic Science upon recent\ncharges against spirit photographers, in which he publishes a\nportion of the correspondence relating to Mrs. Deane's refusal to\nuse the marked plates issued by the College ;\nan interesting\naccount of the mediumship of Frau Maria Silbert, the Austrian\nphysical medium, and a note on the Carinthian poltergeist girl,\nHannie, by Commander Kogelnik of Braunau, Austria.\nThe Revue Metapsychique for July-August has a note on the\nSorbonne experiments with Eva C., and a friendly reply by Sir\nOliver Lodge to Prof. Richet on the hypothesis of survival. An\n\f404 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1022.\naccount is also published by Dr. Geley of his experiments with\nthe sealed letter reader Ossowiecki, in Warsaw, The article is\nreally a short summary of the experiments and results, and any\ncriticism is impossible without knowing the full facts. As with\nEva C. and Franek Kluski, Dr. Geley has not published his\nconditions, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow the\nexperiments intelligently. From what is said, however, it appears\nthat Ossowiecki succeeded in gaining information concerning the\ncontents of sealed letters in a manner which the investigators\nbelieve to be supernormal. To take one experiment as an illustra-\ntion, it appears that Prof. Richet before leaving Warsaw in April,\ngave Dr. Geley a sealed letter given to him by Mme. de Noailles.\nOn taking it from his pocket the outer envelope was torn, and\nso another was substituted for it. The date of giving it to Dr.\nGeley is not given, nor is the history of the letter previous to\ngiving it to Dr. Geley. We are not told the size of the envelope,\nneither the colour, nor thickness. We do not even know whether\nthe piece of paper within was folded once or twice or folded at\nall. All we are told is that the envelope was in the inner\npocket of Dr. Geley's greatcoat, remaining there until given to the\nmedium. However M. Ossowiecki succeeded in obtaining the full\nsense of the passage which had been written by Mme. de Noailles\non the paper within the sealed packet. There are several\nexamples of similar experiments with other investigators reported\nin the same manner, and the article closes with a highly interest-\ning account of his sensations by Ossowiecki himself.\nE. J. D.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nCONCERNING \" AN ADVENTURE.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.\nMADAM,\nWill you allow me space to say that the two ladies who wrote\na book called An Adventure, relating an experience of theirs at\nVersailles in connexion with the Trianon and Marie Antoinette,\nhave allowed me to see the original documents and correspondence\nconnected with the case ;\nwhich they have filed in systematic and\norderly form, and propose to deposit in the archives of St. Hugh's\nCollege, Oxford, so that they may be available for future students\nwho may wish to examine the credentials and verify details of\nthis experience, as part of a study of similar historical visions,\nshould they occur.\nI record the fact of their location in the Journal because it is\na publication which students, even in the distant future, are\nbound to be aware of.\nOLIVER LODGE.\n\f","_id":489}
