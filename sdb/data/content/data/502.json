N. M. Tyrrell\nThe purpose of the following argument is to show that in the\ncollection of evidence in psychical research one very important\nfactor has been largely ignored. The primary aim of the psy-\nchical researcher is to collect evidence and to carry out experiment,\nmaking both as water-tight as possible. But he begins to do this\nwithout previously criticizing the situation in which he proceeds\nto act. He regards the public as being divided into a credulous\nsection on the one hand and a sceptical section on the other, with\na tiny minority of truly balanced individuals in the middle, of\nwhich he is of course one. But a little reflection is sufficient to\nshow that the situation is not as simple as that ; for the person who\nis careful and sceptical in psychical research accepts evidence of a\nlax and hearsay type in ever}'^day occurrences and, strangely\nenough, this lapse into credulity is justified on the whole. Again,\ndetermination on the part of the investigator to be wholly ob-\njective in his methods can lead to the worst kind of subjectivity,\nnot only in psychical research, but in every research of a far-\nflung kind : for while the conscious attention is projected into the\noutside world, the internal working of the mind attempts to force\nupon the facts an interpretation that is suited to its own structure.\nThe lesson that this teaches is that in any such far-reaching\nsubject as psychical research we should keep an eye on the work-\nings of our own minds.\nOne curious feature, visible in the highly sceptical critic, is that\nhe reveals his attitude far more by his behaviour than by what he\ndirectly says. This applies not only to the critic of psychical\n^ At the Editor's request, Mr Tyrrell kindly prepared this abbreviated\nversion of the paper which he read at a meeting of the Society on 21\nSeptember 1950.\n35^^470\n\f3S6 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nresearch but to human beings at large. For example, some philo-\nsophers who have a certain acquaintance with the Proceedings and\nJournal of the S.P.R., when writing about such a thing as the\nscope of knowledge, assume that the physical sense-organs pro-\nvide all the information we have and, if they mention extra-\nsensory perception at all, they skate lightly over it as if it were an\nmcidental triviality and not a fact of central importance, which it\nmust be if It exists at all. Something other than pure reason is\nobviously at work deflecting their arguments towards a prede-\ntermined end. It is behaviour rather than overt logic which reveals\ntheir true attitude.\nIf we look back over the past history of psychical research, we\ncannot help asking ourselves why the subject has made such slow\nprogress m comparison with other subjects\u2014why, after seventy\nyears of careful research, there is still no more than a handful of\npeople at work on it. Why do its funds remain so painfully small,\nwhen many other projects of less importance in an ultimate sense\nhave made outstanding progress ? The answer seems to be that the\ngreat majority of people by-pass the subject, impelled by some\nreluctance or repugnance in themselves, and turn to other things.\nThere may be\u2014in fact there are\u2014cogent arguments which show\nthat the paranormal is of first importance for human knowledge ;\nbut these arguments do not make any impression, and it becomes\nclear that it is behaviour and not rational argument which is the\ndecisive factor in the general attitude towards psychical research.\nIn other words, there is an innate instinct which determines\npeoples' behaviour ;\nso that when the paranormal is broached the\ngeneral attitude to it is not properly rational. When instinct is in\nthe saddle, we cannot be surprised if the mind tends to be im-\npelled towards foregone conclusions, and can only be weaned from\nthese conclusions slowly and painfully by continuous repetition\nof the same evidence and the same experimental results.\nAnother thing which brings to light this sub-rational influence\nIS the light and casual way in which highly intellectual people deal\nwith this subject. Professor A. D. Ritchie, for example, when\ntreating of psychical research, wrote as follows :\n... that a number of very queer and obscure phenomena have been\nobserved that do not fit in well with orthodox theories about bodies and\nminds and their relations. These phenomena can be interpreted in\nterms of a theory of '\nspirits '\nbut they could equally well be inter-\npreted otherwise and with a saving of gratuitous hypotheses. It seems\nthat one must accept either telepathy or clairvoyance as a fact and most\nprobably both as independent facts. Well, granted telepathy and\nclairvoyance and granted too the possibility of a certain amount of\ndistortion of the temporal sequence of events, so that what is in the\n\f'\n'\n^95^] ^ Decisive Factor in the Assessment of Evidence 357\nfuture for one person's experience is not always in the future for\n1\nanother's, it seems possible to account for all alleged '\nspirit ' communi-\n! cations. It can, perhaps, be done by means of telepathy and clair-\nI\nvoyance without temporal distortion, or by telepathy and temporal\n. distortion without clairvoyance. The point is that the '\nspirits '\nhave\nI\nnever reported anything which has not been already known to some\n[\nliving person, or about to be known in the near future or available in\nwritten documents, or by means of some already existing material\nevidence.^\n! The interesting thing about this quotation is not the kind of theory\nthat Professor Ritchie supports but the light-hearted casualness\n; ! with which he deals with telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition,\n'\netc. If these functions of the mind are facts, then they are central\nto our knowledge of the mind and should not be injected into\narguments until they have been made the central theme of inquiry.\nImagine the criticism that would be aroused if any '\nnormal '\nsub-\nject were treated in this casual manner or brought into serious\nargument without careful study. One can almost hear an inward\nvoice saying : This is only '\nparanormal '\nstuff : it won't enhance\nyour reputation if you take it seriously!\nFrom the rational standpoint, what reason is there for lightly\ndismissing the paranormal? There is surely no valid reason ; on\nthe contrary, there is every reason for scrutinizing it with the\nutmost care ; for if the evidence is valid, it is of the greatest con-\nsequence for science, philosophy, and human knowledge in\ngeneral : in fact, it throws a vivid light on the entire human\nsituation, and throws it into a perspective which is quite different\nfrom that commonly accepted today. One would think that this\nwould act as a spur to every thinking person and make him wish to\nV probe the paranormal to the bottom. But the fact is that while\nt the normal stimulates curiosity the paranormal kills it. It does\neven more than kill curiosity : it engenders a resistance to serious\nconsideration of it. When Dr Rhine, and others in this country,\ncarried out quantitative experiments in extrasensory perception,\nin which the odds against chance rose to astronomical proportions,\nthe general reaction was to find a way of escape from the conclusion\nto which the evidence pointed, not an enthusiastic desire to repeat\nthe experiments all over the world and so to install a new piece of\nknowledge of the highest importance.\nIf we take a wide survey of the subject, it is surely as plain as a\npikestaff that the common reaction towards evidence for the para-\nnormal is not prompted by the purely rational faculty of the mind\nbut is prompted by something below the rational level\u2014something\n*\n' Theories of Immortality ', Philosophy, vol. 17, no. 66 (April 1942)\np. 119.\n\f35^ jfouriial of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nthat is very nearly akin to instinct. Many people would be terribly\nshocked at the suggestion that men of science could have the\nbalance of their minds upset by deep-seated instincts of whose\nexistence they were unaware. It would be objected that if there\nare instincts of this kind, psychologists vv'ould have discovered\nthem ;\nand also that science could not have achieved its enormous\nsuccesses if instinct had the power to interfere with reason. The\nanswer to this is highly illuminating if we take tight hold of our-\nselves and refuse to push it away. Psychologists have failed to\nrealize the presence of this instinct because they are as much under\nits influence as anyone else. It is not like the individual complexes\nwith which psychiatrists deal : it is not even a group-character-\nistic belonging to scientists (although it is true that science has\nreinforced it) : it is a racial characteristic belonging to the whole\nof mankind\u2014a product of mental evolution. For evolution did\nnot stop short when it had adapted our bodies to their physical\nsurroundings : it adapted our minds to their surroundings as well.\nBut the latter process was far more subtle than the former : it\nwas part of the instinctual suggestions themselves that they should\nbe concealed from consciousness. As for the argument that\nscience could not have succeeded if reason had been influenced by\ninstinct, the answer to that is that science succeeded precisely\nbecause instinct did interfere in the processes of the mind. It was\nbecause the mind had been pre-adapted to deal with the external\nworld that science was so successful in every practical direction.\nA question that inevitably inserts itself at this point is : How,\nif this instinctive suggestion is universal and invisible, can anyone\nbecome aware of it.'' It is a fundamentally important question ;\nbut for the moment it must be regarded as a side-issue, for there\nis no space in which to deal with it. Very briefly the answer is that\nthe human mind is not a monad but is more akin to a spectrum.\nIt can attain to different levels of awareness. Intuition and inspi-\nration are examples of this. Only the practical level of the mind is\nwholly dominated by adaptive instinct ;\nyet the latter rises into\nand influences higher levels\u2014that of intellectual thought, for\nexample\u2014and deflects its reasoning towards foregone conclu-\nsions.\nTo go into the nature of the adaptive instincts which enter into\nthe structure of the mind, or even to follow the work of psycholo-\ngists, such as C. G. Jung, who has taken steps that should have led\nhim in this direction, is impossible here. But there is one feature\nof this instinct which bears on psychical research, as well as on\nmany other things. This is the instinctive resistance put up by the\nmind to anything which comes from beyond the province of the\nsenses. Why nature should have instilled this resistance into us\n\f1951] A Decisive Factor in the Assessment of Evidence 359\nwould entail a lengthy explanation ; but the main fact is that the\nsense-world had to be accepted as all-inclusive, otherwise the world\nwould not have appeared to be simple enough for the primitive mind\nto grow and to act in. It is because of the pre-adaptation of the\nhuman mind to the physical world that every question that arises\nin practical life is capable of being clearly and finally answered.\nThe effects of mental adaptation can be traced in science, in a\ngreat part of philosophy, and in every department of practical life ;\nbut we are here concerned with their influence on psychical\nresearch. Throughout the history of the S.P.R. there have always\nbeen those who were cautious about evidence and those who went\nfurther and tried to explain it away ; and within recent years, the\nlatter tendency has become more pronounced. There are at least\nthree ways in which the tendency to explain away shows itself in\nthe records of this Society ; and these are to be found in external\ncriticism as well. One of these is to inflate the explanatory powers\nof chance so that chance in relation to the paranormal is held to be\ncapable of accounting for a great deal more than it is in the field\nof the normal. Even statistical figures do not dispose of this\ninflationary tendency. The position is quite irrational ; but\ninstinct, when it causes the mind to act irrationally, can at the same\ntime blind the mind to the fact that it is doing so. The same\ntendency comes out in the criticism of evidence when the weaker\nfeatures are brought into high prominence and the stronger\nfeatures thrust into the background. Again, a suggestion is some-\ntimes found running through a criticism of paranormal evidence\nwhich is lacking in definiteness yet sullies it through innuendo,\nso that the reader is left with the feeling that something is wrong\nsomewhere, though it is not clear where. For example, if careful\ntests were made with a physical medium, which pointed strongly\nto some of the phenomena being genuine, while a single case with\nthe same medium pointed to fraud, this would be worked into a\nsuggestion that it undermined all that the medium had produced.\nIt is, of course, perfectly right that in psychical research the\nevidence should be as good as possible ; but there is a point, not\nat all easy to detect, at which caution lapses into specious argument.\nIt may be said that it is perfectly rational to demand a higher\nstandard of evidence in psychical research than in any other\nsubject because the paranormal is much more improbable than\nthe normal. This brings us to the heart of the matter. Is the\nparanormal more improbable than the normal? Many people\nwould say that it obviously is ; for normal things happen all\naround us and we understand them and know their laws ; but the\nparanormal only happens occasionally ; and when it does it seems\nto break the laws of the normal. But there is no cogency in this\n\f360 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nargument unless we make the assumption that nothing can act\ninto the world from beyond it. If things did act into it, they would\nvery likely be occasional and might disrupt or modify physical\nlaws. Thus the paranormal is not improbable unless we have\nstrong proof that our senses reveal, in principle, the entire universe.\nWe have no proof of this at all, but we have a strong, instinctive\nurge to take it for granted.\nWhen assessing evidence in psychical research the principle\nwhich is surely rational is that the more improbable the alleged\nfacts are the stronger should be the evidence needed to prove\nthem. The critical person, who nevertheless accepts flimsy evidence\nabout things in ordinary life, would probably defend his action by\nsaying that there was nothing improbable in that for which he\naccepted weak evidence ; therefore weak evidence was enough.\nThe principle is that the strength of the evidence should increase\nin proportion to the improbability of that which it supports.\nBut when we turn to psychical research, or to any subject which\ndeals with what is held to be improbable, and adopt this principle,\nwe are at once faced with a difficulty. How improbable are the\nalleged facts.? We must surely know this before we can decide on\nthe standard of evidence required : and there is the added compli-\ncation that we cannot fix a standard for the whole of the para-\nnormal. Some paranormal features may be more improbable than\nothers, so we must vary our standards of evidence throughout the\nsubject. Many people would be likely, for instance, to regard\ntelepathy as more probable than communications from the dead ;\nand the phenomena of the seance-room have their own degree of\nimprobability again. But these differences in probability are not\nthe main difficulty. The main difficulty is that people are not\nagreed as to hozv improbable any of these paranormal features are.\nThis inserts a subjective element into the problem and prevents\nus from deciding beforehand how strong the evidence need be ;\nfor the improbability of anything depends on general agreement\nabout it.\nLet us ask this question : How improbable is telepathy? Some\npeople regard telepathy as a matter of course ; others regard it\nas not very unlikely, while others, again, react towards it as if they\nregarded it as an impossibility, though they probably do not say\nso in so many words. How then are we to decide how improbable\ntelepathy is? If we cannot decide, how can we fix on the standard\nof evidence required to prove it? Should we agree with the first\nclass? If so, hear-say evidence would be sufficient as it is for\ncountless things in everyday life. Or should we agree with the\nmiddle class ? In that case the quantitative experiments would long\nago have convinced us. Or should we agree with the third class?\n\f1951] Dispersion of Scores in ESP Experiments 361\nIn that case, why not say outright that telepathy is impossible and\nthat no amount of evidence can prove it?\nThis brings us to the heart of the problem. There is no reason\nwhy the universe should not extend beyond the scope of our\nsenses, and consequently no reason why things of an utterly\nstrange and incomprehensible kind, such as telepathy and precog-\nnition, should not occur there and should not give rise to sporadic\neffects within the sense-world. But an ingrained instinct of a\nracial type has been instilled into us by nature in order to keep\nour minds focused upon the world of our senses ; and this urges\nus to reject the possibility of any further extension of the world.\nThe problem of psychical research is thus not how to obtain\nevidence which satisfies the rational mind (supposed to be in a\nstate of perfect balance) but how to obtain evidence which will\nvanquish our racial instinct, which continually attempts to make\nour reason explain the evidence away. This is why psychical\nresearch makes such slow progress, why so few treat it seriously,\nand why it does not invoke a general enthusiasm for further inquiry.\nThere are more complications. The power of this racial instinct\nvaries in different individuals because the human mind is graded,\nand elevation towards the intuitive level weakens the hold of\ninstinct. Also, those who are usually termed credulous placate\nthis instinct by drawing the paranormal into this world and\n'\nnormalising '\nit.\nTo sum up the present argument : an essential condition for\nfurther progress in psychical research is that those engaged in it\nshould recognize the existence of this racial instinct and the subtle\npart it plays.\nDISPERSION OF SCORES IN\nESP EXPERIMENTS\nBy D. J. West\nLast September arrangements were made to test five friends for\nESP after they had taken a drug which was supposed to induce a\neuphoric mood. The experiment did not fulfil its intended\npurpose, since in no case did the drug produce the desired effect.\nThe results were nevertheless interesting.\nThe ESP experiment took the form of a clairvoyance test.\nPacks of ESP cards (five of each symbol) were shuffled by hand\nand the card order recorded before each session by Miss Elizabeth\nMcMahan of the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University\nwho was in London at the time. During the session the target\n\f362 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JAN.\npack was enclosed in a small wooden box. The subject was asked\nto call out his guesses '\ndown through '\nthe pack while the experi-\nmenter wrote down the calls. After each run of twenty-five calls\nthe cards were taken out of the box and the calls checked in the\nsubject's presence. One evening session was devoted to each\nsubject. At each session twenty-five runs were carried out\nexcepting at the third session, which was cut short after twenty\nruns. The results are summarised in Table I. '\n\u2022\nTABLE I\nSubject Sex\nNo. of\nRum DeviatioTi\nCritical\nRatio\nJ.N. M 25 + 18 I -So\nL. D. M 25 -25 2-50\nJ. c. F 20 + 13 1.45\nY. A. F 25 - 13 1-30\nB. H.

P = -oi\nTable I shows a significant dispersion of subjects' scores from\nchance expectation, suggesting that some of them used ESP\nto score positively while others had a tendency to use their ESP\nto avoid the target and produce negative scores.\nThis avoidance of the target, when the declared aim is to score\nas much as possible, might be described as a disguised response.\nOther disguised responses have been reported, such as Displace-\nment (that is, hitting a target ahead or behind instead of the one\naimed at), Salience (that is, heaping up of hits at the beginning and\nend of a run with a deficiency in the middle), and Consistent\nMissing (that is, naming a particular symbol wrongly, such as\ncalling cross whenever circle is the target). These '\nefl^ects\n'\nmay all be disguised responses. It is as if the subjects were like\ncriminals, guilty of revealing this knowledge of the targets, yet\nunable to prevent this knowledge influencing their calls in devious\nways. Of course, this is as yet only speculation.\nAlternate positive and negative scoring is a situation which has\nbeen encountered in the investigations of Dr Betty Humphrey and\nProfessor Gertrude Schmeidler. By the use of psychological\ntests predictive of the likely direction of each subject's score, these\nexperimenters have succeeded in subdividing seemingly null data\ninto significantly different positive and negative scoring groups.\nIt occurred to me that if a number of subjects were tested for\nESP under constant and favourable conditions, the positive and\n\figji] Dispersion of Scores in ESP Experiments 363\nnegative scoring tendencies of the individual subjects might be\nsufficiently consistent to produce a significant dispersion of their\nscores. If the number of trials per subject were too few, as in\nmost of the American work, the effect would not have a chance to\ndisplay itself. On the other hand, if the subjects were made to\ndo too many runs, the proverbial decline phenomenon might set\nin and the initial effect be diluted to insignificance by continuous\nnull results. The effect obtained in the small experiment with\nfive friends might have been due to a combination of favourable\npsychological conditions and choice of a more or less optimum\nnumber of trials.\nIn order that this possibility could be further explored, Mr\nJ. Fraser Nicol and Mr Edward Osborn kindly lent me some\nESP data which they collected in 1948-9.1 Their experiments\ntook the form of card-calling tests with individual subjects under\nGESP conditions. The investigators were alive to the desira-\nbility of providing an encouraging, unstrained atmosphere.

These are\nthe experiments which were referred to in the Society's Annual Reports\nfor 1948 and 1949.\n\f364 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jAN. 1\nexperimental precautions were adequate. In most of the tests agent 1\nand subject were in separate rooms communicating by means of a\nsignal light. The target sequence was determined by random 1\nnumbers. The total result for all subjects showed no significant\ndeviation. (In a total of 15,769 trials the deviation was only 39-2).\nBefore seeing this data I decided upon sixteen runs as an\narbitrary figure likely to be somewhere near the optimum number 1\nof runs per subject. Table II shows the results obtained by those\nof the Nicol-Osborn subjects who completed sixteen or more runs.\nThe table is divided into two sections, the first sixteen runs and\nsubsequent runs. i\nTable II shows that in spite of the null result in the total, and\nin spite of the poor performance in later trials, the subjects do\ndisplay to a significant extent the same dispersion of scores as was\nseen in Table I. A more accurate method of demonstrating the\ndiff'ering performances of the subjects is the analysis of variance.\nEach subject's scores are arranged in a column of figures with sixteen\nentries (one for each run) in chronological order. When the ten\nsubjects' scores are put together a table results with 160 cells. The ji\nsubsequent course of the analysis is shown in Table III. |l\nTABLE III\n'\nFirst 16 Runs of Nicol-Osborn Subjects\nSource of\nVariance\nDegrees of\nFreedom\nSum of\nSquares\nMean\nSquare\nVariance\nRatio, F P\nBetween\nSubjects\n(Columns)\n9 go-\n1\nlO-O 2-60 -01\napprox.\nWithin\nSubjects\n(Rows)\n15 6l-2 4-0S I -06 {insignificant)\nResidual 135 520-7\nTotal 159 672-0\nThe variance ratio in Table III indicates a clearly significant\ntendency for the scores of the different subjects to vary, some\nabove chance, some below.^ The table also shows that there was\n* The scores used in this analysis form a discontinuous variable with a\nlimited theoretical range from o to 25.

In other\nwords, in the Nicol-Osborn work, as well as in the first experiment\nwith five subjects, some people were using their ESP to score\nsubstantially above chance, while others were giving a sort of\ndisguised response, using their ESP to avoid the target and score\nbelow chance.\nOver the past year a large mass of data from home-testing\nexperiments has been collected by Mr G. W. Fisk. The partici-\npants were advised to carry out the tests under GESP conditioris\nand to employ hand-shuffied packs. Since there were no investi-\ngators supervising the tests, and the experimental precautions were\nnot rigid, the results, whatever their nature, could never be\nregarded as more than suggestive. Any subject who achieved an\ninitially promising score was encouraged to continue. There were\n177 subjects in all, of whom 134 carried out 8 or more runs and 75\ncompleted 16 or more runs. The results, so far as direct hits\nwere concerned, were null (see p. 369).\nTABLE IV\nHome-Testing Experiments. First 16 Runs. 75 Subjects.\nAnalysis of Variance\nSource oj Variance D.F.

The result, shown in Table IV, gives no\nindication of a dispersal of scores as was found in Tables I and II.\nThe Fisk data were interesting on account of the significant\ndisplacement effects. It is important to emphasise, however, that\nalthough the total score was statistically significant the scoring\naverage was only very slightly different from chance expectation.\nThe average deviation per run on forward displacement was\n-0-12. This tends to confirm the view that one cannot expect a\nlarge yield from card-calling experiments using unselected sub-\njects without attempting to introduce strong motivation in each of\nthe participants. In this connection Dr Rhine recently wrote\nadvising a psychologist who was about to embark upon ESP\n\f366 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\ntests to the following effect : It is important to remember that\nESP tests are no mere passive measurement such as you are\naccustomed to making. It is likely to help most subjects to chal-\nlenge them to get as many as possible of the symbols correct.\nUnless the subject is strongly motivated himself, the tests call for\nthe liveliest methods and strongest pressure the experimenter can\nproperly bring to bear.\nSUMMARY\nOther investigators have demonstrated positive and negative\nscoring trends in groups of subjects selected by psychological\ntesting. A small ESP experiments with five friends showed a\nsignificant dispersion of subjects' scores. This led to the sug-\ngestion that, given the right conditions and an optimum number\nof runs, the positive and negative scoring trends of each subject\nmight reveal themselves as a significant dispersion of scores with-\nout any psychological test having been applied. This idea received\nsome confirmation from an examination of the data collected by\nNicol and Osborn. No such effect was found in the large body of\ndata from home-testing experiments. The matter would probably\nrepay further investigation by experimenters who have suitable\ndata in their possession.\nAN EXPERIMENT IN PRECOGNITION\nReported by G. N. M. Tyrrell\nMrs V. M. Austin, a member of the Society, asked me some time\nago if I could suggest an interesting experiment in precognition. |\nI replied that it would be a good thing, I thought, to introduce\n'\nsome process of randomisation between a prediction and its\nfulfilment in order to see whether this would prevent the fulfil-\nment from taking place. The following is an epitome of the i\nexperiment. Mrs Austin took a mascot, a small black cat, to Mrs j\nMethven, a medium, and asked her to write down impressions as i\nto what would happen to it in the future.^ These she sealed up in\nan envelope without looking at them. This was done on 27\nSeptember 1946. One or two nights later, Mrs Austin wrote the\nnames of thirty acquaintances on slips of paper and mixed them up\nin a hat. She then got a friend to draw one of them, and the name\n1 Mrs Austin tried the experiment on three occasions. The first two,\nwhich were not with Mrs Methven, were failures.\n\figji] An Experiment in Precognition 367\non it was found to be Miss Graham (pseudonym). The mascot\nwas at once sent to her, and Mrs Austin opened and read the\nmedium's statements and filed the paper away. Miss Graham\nsailed for a foreign country on 25 March 1949. She was a civil\nservant in the employ of a foreign government, and she went to\nthat country partly in order to arrange her retirement from her\npost. In May 1949 she returned to England. She had intended to\ntravel on the outward journey in a freight steamer alone, but on\nhearing that her passage would be paid, she went by liner, where\nshe met a friend and travelled with her.\nMrs Austin then sent questions based on Mrs Methven's state-\nments to the other twenty-nine persons whose names had been\nin the hat in order to find out to what extent these statements\napplied to them. Mrs Methven's statement is given in full below\n(A). It is followed by list B, which contains the medium's state-\nment as put to Miss Graham by Mrs Austin, with Miss Graham's\nannotations shown in italics. List C contains the questions put\nto the remaining twenty-nine persons.\nA. '\nThe article in question will be carried to a foreign country.\nWill bring good luck. Two people are travelling together. A\ngreat deal of activity. Many new links will be made. I feel\nwill return to this country again perhaps for retirement. I feel\nyou must take care of your health, nothing to be anxious about,\nchest seems a little difficult at times, able to overcome much with\nright thought.'\nB. '\n(i) The article in question will be carried to a foreign country.\nWrong. (2) Two people are travelling together. Correct.\n(3) A great deal of activity. Yes. (4) Many new links will be\nmade. Yes. (5) Will return to this country again. Correct.\n(6) Perhaps for retirement. Yes.''\nC. '\n(i) Did you travel to a foreign country between September\n1946 and June 1949? (2) If so, did you travel with a single\ncompanion? (3) If so, did you return to England within this\nperiod? (4) If so, did your journey bring marked good luck?\n(5) If so, did you have an exceptionally active time abroad?\n(6) If so, did you make many new links during this period?\n(7) If so, was the journey connected with your professional\nretirement? (8) Even if you did not go abroad, during this\nperiod, did you retire or make arrangements for your retirement\nduring this period?'\nThe chance question was roughly tested by sending list C to\nthe other 29 persons whose names had been in the hat. The gist\nof the result was that in 45 cases statements of the medium applied,\n\f368 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jAN.\nwhile in 158 they did not. The whole of the eight statements did\nnot apply to any one of the 29. One of the 29 did, however, make\na journey which was connected with retirement. Three out of the\n29 had arranged to retire during this period but had made no\njourney in connection with it.\nIt has been suggested that the experiment contained the\nfollowing defects in design : (i) that list B given to Miss Graham\nto annotate did not correspond exactly with the statement (A)\nmade by Mrs Methven in that it omitted the references to good\nluck and health ; and (ii) that while Mrs Austin divided list B\ninto six parts, the list (C) given to the twenty-nine persons for\nannotation was divided into eight parts and omitted the point\nabout health. It has been suggested that as a result the applicability\nof Mrs Methven's statement to Miss Graham on the one hand and\nto the twenty-nine persons on the other cannot satisfactorily be\ncompared.\nWhile Miss Graham did, in a later letter, make clear that she had\nhad good luck, it was admittedly a fault that the medium's state-\nment about health was not circulated. This statement did not\napply to Miss Graham, and was in fact the only mis-statement made\nby the medium. For the first item in list B, which was there\nmarked wrong, was afterwards found to be right. Miss Graham\nhad inadvertently taken the mascot abroad with her in an out-of-\nthe-way pocket of a bag and only discovered this after her return.\nAs regards the first part of point (ii) : the two additional questions\nin list C were (4) and (8). The former, which concerned good\nluck, is dealt with above ; (8) would not have been applicable to\nMiss Graham as it was known that she had gone abroad.\nPerhaps it should be added that Mrs Austin told me in a letter\nthat when Mrs Methven was presented with the cat-mascot, she\nfirst made statements about the former environment of Mrs\nAustin, who had, up to then, been its owner. These statements\nwere correct. Also, during the winter which followed the pre-\nsentation of the mascot to Mrs Methven, Mrs Austin had a long\nillness of combined bronchitis and influenza, to which the state-\nment about health might quite well refer.\nI think Mrs Austin is to be congratulated on the achievement\nof this experiment and it is to be hoped that, despite the doubt\nbetween chance and the paranormal in this case, more work on\nprecognition along these lines will be done.\n\fHome-Testing ESP Experiments 369\nHOME-TESTING ESP EXPERIMENTS\nA Preliminary Report by G. W. Fisk\nSince quantitative experiments in extrasensory perception started\nin Great Britain, a mere handful of subjects has been found who\nhave been able to maintain a consistently high rate of scormg. It\nwas in an effort to discover promising subjects that in January 1950\narrangements were made for the carrying out of simple ESP tests by\nmembers of the Society in their own homes. An instruction sheet\nwas drawn up, and this, with numbered scoring sheets and packs of\nESP cards, was sent to every group of two or more people who were\nwilling to give each other and their friends card-calling tests. It\nwas recommended that Agent and Percipient should be separated\nby a screen measuring at least three feet square or by its equivalent,\nthat the Experimenter should signal by tapping when the Agent\nlooked at each card, and that 200 calls should be made at each\nsession. It was suggested that any subject scoring ninety-two or\nmore (or sixty-eight or less) in 400 guesses should be regarded as\npromising, and that further tests with him should be carried out.\nAs the experiments were not supervised, it is, of course, legitimate\nonly to regard the results as suggestive, however significant they\nmay appear statistically.\nBackward\nDisplacement\n(-1)\nTarget\nHits\n(0)\nFonvard\nDisplacement\n( + 1)\nTotal Hits 13116 14026 13081\nExpectation 13416 1397s 13416\nDeviation -300 + 51 -335\nCritical Ratio 2-89 0-48 3-24\nP \u2022004 \u202232 \u2022001\nUp to the end of October 1950, 177 subjects had been tested,\nand the total number of runs (twenty-five calls to each run) was\n2,795. No individual subject was found whose scores were con-\nsistently significant either on the target or in either displacement\ndirection. Taking the results as a whole, however, there were\nsignificant negative scores on both + i and - i displacement. An\nexamination of a substantial sample of the data for + 2 and - 2\ndisplacement indicated that a negative trend, similar to that dis-\ncovered in the + 1 and - 1 scores, was present, though not to a\nsignificant degree.\n355470\n\f37\u00b0 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nStatistical tests have not yet been applied, but by inspection it\nappears that the negative deviations on displacement were well\ndistributed throughout the data and were not due to the anomalous\nperformances of a few subjects. It must be emphasised that\n'\nclosed '\npacks were used and that the scores in the direct target and\ndisplacement positions are not statistically independent of each\nother. The close conformity of the direct hits with chance expecta-\ntion is interesting. In experiments conducted by different volun-\nteers and in a variety of conditions, one might have supposed that\nspurious deviations would be likely to arise from such normal\ncauses as lack of care in recording, sensory leakage, etc.\nThe search for promising subjects still goes on. I hope that any\nreaders of this Journal\u2014\\N\\vtXhex members of the Society or not\nwho have not taken part in these experiments but who wish to do\nso will get in touch with me (6 Ditton Grange Close, Ditton Hill,\nSurrey).\nTHE FRAUDULENT MEDIUMS BILL\nOn Friday, i December, this Bill was read a second time in the\nHouse of Commons. Proposed by Mr Walter Monslow (Labour,\nBarrow-in-Furness) and seconded by Mr T. J. Brooks (Labour,\nNormanton), the Bill, in the words of the preamble, is designed to'\n'\nRepeal the Witchcraft Act, 1735, and to make, in substitution for\ncertam provisions of section four of the Vagrancy Act, 1824,\nexpress provision for the punishment of persons who fraudulently\npurport to act as spiritualistic mediums or to exercise powers of\ntelepathy, clairvoyance or other similar powers '. It contains the\nfollowing clauses:\nI.\u2014(i) Subject to the provisions of this section, any person who\u2014\n[a) with intent to deceive purports to act as a spiritualistic medium\nor to exercise any powers of telepathy, clairvoyance or other\nsimilar powers, or\nin purporting to act as a spiritualistic medium or to exercise\nsuch powers as aforesaid, uses any fraudulent device,\nshall be guilty of an offence.\n(2) The foregoing subsection shall apply only where a person acts for\nreward; and for the purposes of this section a person shall be deemed\nto act for reward if any payment is made in respect of what he does,\nwfiether to him or to any other person.\n(3) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on\nsummary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or to imprison-\nment for a term not exceeding four months, or to both such fine and\nsuch imprisonment, or on conviction on indictment to a fine not\nexceeding five hundred pounds or to imprisonment for a term not\nexceeding two years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.\n\f1] The Fraudulent Mediums Bill 371\n(4) No proceedings for an offence under this section shall be brought\nin England or Wales except by or with the consent of the Director of\nPublic Prosecutions.\n(5) Nothing in subsection (i) of this section shall apply to anything\ndone solely for the purpose of entertainment.\n2. The following enactments are hereby repealed, that is to say\u2014\n{a) the Witchcraft Act, 1735, so far as still in force, and\n[b) section four of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, so far as it extends to\npersons purporting to act as spiritualistic mediums or to\nexercise any powers of telepathy, clairvoyance or other\nsimilar powers, or to persons who, in purporting so to act\nor to exercise such powers, use fraudulent devices.\n3 This Act may be cited as the Fraudulent Mediums Act, 1950.\n(2) This Act shall not extend to Northern Ireland.\nMembers who spoke in favour of the Motion were Mr Arthur\nColegate (Con.), Mr George Deer (Lab.), Mr C. W. Gibson (Lab.),\nMr Leslie Hale (Lab.), Mr Douglas Houghton (Lab.), Mr James\nHudson (Lab.), Mr B. Janner (Lab.), the Rev. Gordon Lang\n(Lab ), Mr L. M. Lever (Lab.), Lt-Col M. Lipton (Lab.), Mr\nR. J. Mellish (Lab.), Mr T. C. Pannell (Lab.), Mr George Rogers\n(Lab.), Mr William Ross (Lab.), Mr H. N. Smith (Lab.), Lt-Cdr\nR H. M. Thompson (Con.), Mr S. P. Viant (Lab.), Mr David\nWeitzman (Lab.), Col G. E. C. Wigg (Lab.), the Rev. G. S.\nWoods (Lab.). The Home Secretary, Mr Chuter Ede, stated that\nthe Bill would be left to free discussion and a free vote. He hoped\n'\nthat in some form or other we may through this measure be able\nto release some of our fellow citizens from an indignity to which\nat present they feel they are subjected '.\nThe Council of the Society considered the Bill at their meeting\non 7 December. They expressed their entire concurrence in the\ndeclared objects of the Bill, namely, to protect honest mediums\nfrom prosecution under out-dated Statutes which are in their\nterms offensive to the whole profession, and at the same time firmly\nto check fraudulent mediumship.\nThe Society has for its object the examination in an impartial\nspirit of various real or supposed faculties usually called para-\nnormal, with a view to bringing within the domain of scientific\ninquiry those aspects of human personality left unexplored by\nother branches of psychology. To carry out this difficult and\nimportant enterprise, the psychical researcher must be granted the\nsame freedom to pursue his investigations unmolested as is enjoyed\nby other scientific workers. The mediumistic situation is not as\nsimple as the debate in the House would suggest, and presents no\nclear-cut alternative between genuine spirit communication and\n\f372 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nfraud. The psychical researcher must feel himself secure to state\nwithout fear or favour just what his opinion is of any of the\nincidents under his examination. This, however, necessarily\ninvolves making statements that are critical of the powers or\nalleged powers of mediums. Since it has hitherto been assumed\nthat the existence of the Acts now sought to be repealed has been\na bar to the bringing by mediums of libel actions against researchers,\nthe Council felt that the repeal of these Acts, without the provision\nof some safeguard in this respect, might make it difficult for a\nresearcher to publish the results of his investigations and his\ncomments thereon without running the risk of an action in the\nCourts. As psychical research is a highly specialised subject, and\nthe proper examination of alleged paranormal phenomena requires\na hfetime of study, it was suggested that an ordinary Law Court\nmight be an unsatisfactory tribunal for the decision of such ques-\ntions. The Council therefore consulted Mr K. E. Shelley, K.C.,\nhimself a member of the Society, on this matter and he advises\nas follows:\nWhile it is undoubtedly of the greatest importance that psychical\nresearchers should have full liberty to publish the results of their\ninvestigations and to state their conclusions and even their conjectures\nwith the utmost freedom, in my opinion the ordinary law of libel\naffords them sufficient protection for this purpose. As the law stands,\nno criticism can make its author liable to damages provided it is fair\nand honest, that it is made without malice, and that it contains no mis-\nstatement of fact. The circumstance that the criticism reflects the\npersonal beliefs (or disbeliefs) and the prejudices of the author does not\nmatter. All the many reports of investigations contained in the various\npublications of the Society that I have read fulfil these requirements\nand, quite apart from the Acts now proposed to be repealed, no success-\nful action for libel could have been brought in respect of any of them.\nAs the Society certainly intends to maintain its existing policy in regard\nto criticism, I see no reason for it to seek any special protection. Of\ncourse, nothing can prevent any person who thinks he has a grievance\nfrom instituting legal proceedings, but in my opinion this is an ad-\nvantage rather than the reverse. Mediums will know that they have\nthe same rights as any other person and can protect themselves from\nunfair and malicious attacks, and therefore will be the more ready to\nsubmit themselves to impartial investigation. Any action brought in\nrespect of a proper criticism is bound to fail (it is surprising how our\nCourts can master technical details of every kind when these are\nproperly explained) and an unjustified action that deservedly fails may\nuhimately do so much good by informing the public of the pitfalls and\ndifficulties in this branch of knowledge that the trouble and expense of\ndefending the action would be a valuable investment.\nIn view of the above advice, it is not felt that there are grounds\nfor making representations in regard to the Bill.\n\fReviews 373\nREVIEWS\nSpuk: Irrglaube oder Wahrglaube? Vol. I. By F. Moser.\nForeword by C. G. Jung. Baden bei Zurich, Gyr-Verlag,\niqco. S42 pp. 9 plates. ,\nt->\nThis book is the first of two volumes on the poltergeist by Dr\nFannv Hoppe Moser, a Swiss biologist, who became interested in\noccult phenomena in 1914 when she assisted at a sitting for table-\nturning and levitation with the Berlin medmm, Mrs Fischer. In\nher earlier book, Der Okkultismus (Munich, 1935), Dr Moser gave\na general survey of the whole field, and although she tried to be as\nobjective as possible, it was clear that she was of the opinion that\nmany so-called psychic phenomena were facts m Nature, and\ncould be investigated by the methods of science\nIn her present work Dr Moser has set herself the task ot in-\nquiring into the evidence for poltergeist activity, and for this\npurpose she has examined afresh the records of some cases dating\nfrom 1663 to 1946. The accounts of most of these cases are m\nGerman, and among them is the very curious story 01 the pheno-\nmena observed by Professor C. G. Jung during his week-ends in a\nhaunted farmhouse in Buckinghamshire in 1920. It is a pity that\nthese events were not reported to the Society for Psychical Re-\nsearch at the time of their occurrence, as, from the notes now\nprinted thirty years later, it is clear that Dr Jung made no effectual\nattempts to inquire into the objectivity of the sounds, whilst his\ncolleague Dr X. went to bed with a loaded gun as his companion.\nAs an opening to her survey, Dr Moser has chosen the famous\nJoUer case which began in Stans, a small place south of Lucerne,\nin i860 and was recorded by the la^vyer, Melchior Joller m a\npamphlet, now very rare, which was issued in Zurich in 1853.\nThe phenomena began with raps, as is so often the case\nToller thought little of them, but when one day in 1861 his small\nson was found in a fainting condition his father was disturbed to\nhear that the fit was brought on by raps followed by the alarming\nappearance of a white misshapen form. Gradually the phenomena\nincreased in number and complexity. The raps on the floor were\nnow as loud as if they had been caused by a heavy mallet, and\nI\n^\nA second pamphlet, apparently in reply to nom.al eKplanati^^^^ which\nhad been advanced, was issued the same year. The\n^^f^^'J^P ^\"'^^^\nbuted by Daumer to Joller himself) is still in ^.^P^^^\"\nMoser is at\npains to reject Daumer's attribution; she also discusses the authorship\nof the preface to Toiler's own pamphlet. In ^^P^\/\n;^;:f^;\u00b0'^^;\nwhich came from the library of Baron Carl Du ^^^^'^e preface\nassigned to Perty, which seems to me very probable and which may have\nbeen written in by Du Prel himself.\n\f374 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nfurniture jumped after every blow. Grey shapes were now and\nthen observed flitting about, and soon the case became a sensation\nIn view of the public clamour a kind of committee of three persons\nwas appointed, including the chief of the local police On\ninvestigation little occurred, but when the Joller family was\nrequested to withdraw from the house the phenomena immediately\nceased, only to recommence the moment it returned and actually\nto increase in violence. A massive walnut table was overturned\nand an object like a three-tailed cloth appeared and disappeared.\nVague shadows as of waving hands were observed, and greyish\nforms were occasionally seen gliding about. Many pieces of\nfurniture were knocked over ; an apple danced about on the\nfloor, and apparitions were seen by the children both in the house\nand garden Finally, the Joller family moved elsewhere and the\nhouse was locked up.\nDr Moser has taken a great deal of trouble to supplement\nJo ers account with other contemporary records and the re-\ncollections of those still living. Ahhough her industry is to be\ncommended, it does not seem that much was gained from the\nscientific point of view. Indeed, the publication of these cases is\nmainly of comparative, academic, and historical interest, and like\nso many other writers Dr Moser is inclined to be overwhelmed bv\nthe enormous weight of testimony to poltergeist activitv She\nnow and then seems to take the attitude of the '\nten thousand-\npeople-cant-be-wrong '\nschool without fully appreciating the\nbasis on which others maintain their attitude of scepticism.\nMoreover, I suspect that Dr Moser has had but little practical\nexperience in the field. Had she had such experience she would\nknow how utterly different are the accounts of umrained observers\nfrom those furnished by skilled investigators, and how the most\ntransparent and simple little deceptions may appear as major\nphenomena which, at first sight, seems quite inexplicable When\nDr Jung maintains, as he does on p. 260, that parapsychology would\ndo well to make use of the psychology of the unconscTous, he\nIS preaching to the long-since-converted. Indeed, could the\nJungian psychologists be persuaded to listen to and learn from the\nparapsychologist, they would sometimes refrain from claiming as\nexamples of the paranormal incidents in the consulting-room fhat\nthey cannot explain.\n^\nIt is this inability to explain that lies at the root of Dr Moser's\ngeneral attitude and it is connected with her failure to realise the\nmeaning and relevance of much of the material with which she is\ndealing The very complexity of poltergeist cases make them very\ndifficult to appraise when all we have are written records from\nsources which are often suspect in themselves. For apart\n\fiQji] Reviews 375\naltogether from conscious fraud (which may also be present),\nwe have to contend with the misinterpretation of normal events,\nwhich are then fitted into what is supposed to be a supernormal\nframework, and thus add false notes to the overall picture.\nDr Moser's book, therefore, is of value not so much from the\npoint of view of the practical observer as from that of the historian\nwhose work in this field is also to be esteemed as it enables the\nstudent to compare what has been recorded in the past with what\nis being observed in the present. From the case histories here\ncollected, the reader will be able to learn something of the less\nspectacular poltergeist records from house and stable and note\nhow, in many instances, those favoured failed even to make the\nmost simple kind of inquiry into the origin of the manifestations.\nThus we have the case of the Bavarian Professor of Physics, who,\nfor six months, noted the racketings of a poltergeist in the attic of\nthe house in which he lived, and did not even take the trouble to\ninvestigate upstairs. Then we have the case of the student of\nchemistry in whose apartment a poltergeist raged for some time.\nYet, when one day she discovered that over one and a half pints of\n'\nmilk '\nhad been apported and spilt in one of her rooms, she did\nnot even go to the point of having the liquid analysed !\nCan it be\nthat many of these events are to be explained by assuming that,\nat the time, they did not strike those participating in them in the\nsame light as they did later when describing them to collectors of\nghost stories? It is for the reader of Dr Moser's book to judge for\nhimself, and in this he will not be wasting his time. We shall look\nforward with much interest to the second volume where the\nauthoress has promised to provide a commentary and discussion\nof the fact recorded in the first.\nE. J. Dingwall\nThe Illusion of Immortality. By Corliss Lamont. New York,\nPhilosophical Library, 1950. Second Edition, xvii, 316 pp.\n4 plates. $3.95.\nThis is a learned and well-argued defence of the thesis that man\nis mortal and that there is no life beyond the grave. Most of the\narguments are along familiar lines but they are well presented, and\ngenerally the case on the other side is fairly considered. Having\nread Dr Lamont's book, I remain unconvinced by his thesis but I\ndo not think this is due to any defect in the presentation of his\ncase. Its weakness lies not in its arguments but in the system of\nassumptions on which the arguments rest. If the universe is\nmerely a physical system in which human bodies have evolved\nfrom unicellular organisms by a blind operation of the laws of\ni\n\f376 jfoiirtial of the Society for Psychical Research [jAN.\nnatural selection, it is indeed unlikely that somewheie in that\nprocess an immortal soul was added to man's body, and that in\nsome corner of this naturalistic universe there are to be found a\nspiritual world and a God who on rare occasions interferes with\nthe natural order.\nThere is, however, another possibility : that God and the\nspiritual world are primary and important, and that the natural I\nworld is a creation by God for the purpose of attaining spiritual\nends. From such a point of view it is not unreasonable to suppose\nthat man is now and eternally a part of that spiritual world, or even\nthat the purpose of evolution was to provide a fit instrument for\nthe human spirit. Such a possibility is not considered by Dr\nLamont. Our choice between the possibilities as to a naturalistic\nor a religious view of the universe must be made on the evidence ;\nthe question cannot be decided merely by looking at it from one of\nthe alternative points of view.\nThe decision is, of course, difficult ; that is why there is much\ndifference of opinion on the matter. The assessment of evidence\ndepends on one's valuation of revealed religion and on one's\nopinion of the finality of the scientific point of view, as well as on\none's opinion of the kind of evidence obtained through mediums.\nDr Lamont seems to abandon his attempt to be fair in considering\nthe latter kind of evidence. There are obvious difficulties in\njudging how far the results of seances support a belief in a future\nlife, but consideration of this evidence demands more than re-\nference to '\ndear departed grandfather's indulging himself in\ntable-rapping, playing weird tunes on cheap musical instruments\nor telling the secrets of his past to strange women mediums '.\nEven less happy is his reference to experimental psychical\nresearch. Dr Lamont repeats criticisms made by Professor\nJastrow fourteen years ago of the work carried out at Duke\nUniversity which were of doubtful validity when they were made\nand are certainly inapplicable to the work that has been carried out\nthere since that time. He also states that Rhine's successes in\nESP have not been repeated in other countries, ignoring the\ncontributions of Soal, Tyrrell, and Whately Carington in this\ncountry alone.\nR. H.

He points out that the human mind is bound to clothe its\nintellectual perceptions in whatever imagery is most familiar to it\n\u2014\nand that that of a Portuguese peasant accustomed to baroque\nchurches is sure to differ from that of (say) an American, or an\nIndian, or a Greek. (The same truth may be exemplified in a more\nfamiliar instance by considering how differently an Englishman and\na Chinese will '\nsee '\nand paint an identical objective landscape-\nwitness Chiang Yee's delightful pictures of various Oxford scenes.)\nFr Martindale has also carefully separated the evidence given in\ncontemporary documents\u2014the repeated cross-examinations of the\nchildren, the reports of their parents, the newspaper accounts of\nhow enormous crowds saw the sun '\nspinning '\nin the sky, and\nemitting a series of coloured lights, ending with a '\nvery ugly yellow\n'\n\u2014from the later, adult writings and reflections of Lucia, the nun\nwho was the only one of the three who lived to grow up.\nNone of the original oddities is smoothed away\u2014the suddenness\nof first vision, with the flash of lightning directing the children's\nattention to a young girl standing on top of a small tree ;\nthe fact\nthat the little Jacinta wanted to offer her some bread and cheese ;\nthe sound heard at one later vision by a woman, and at another,\nlater still, by a man, neither of whom saw or heard anything else\nthat seemed unusual, like '\nthe buzzing of a bee '\nor '\na horsefly in a\nbottle '\n; and the fact that on the 13th October, when most of a\ncrowd assessed at 70,000 strong were awed and terrified by the\nunexpected apparent movements of the sun, and '\nunbelievers\n'\nsuch as the editor of a freethinking newspaper, and a stolid,\nirritated English domestic brought by her employers saw all the\nphenomena, several devout persons in the assemblage perceived\nnothing at all. This, by the way, seems to be an argument against\nFr Martindale's tentative hypothesis that the appearances might\nbe explained by '\nnatural causes '\n;\njust as the fact that they were\nobserved from two places some distance away seems to argue\nagainst the theory of a collective hallucination brought about by\nsuggestion from one person to another.\nThis seems likely to remain the standard English work on the\nsubject. Its original sources are quoted (in translation) at con-\nsiderable length. No attempt is made to attach any dispropor-\ntionate importance to the form of the visions or the locutions, or\nto the solar '\nmiracle '\n; and the Preface provides a close and\ninteresting analysis of the process through which the mind receives.\n\f37^ Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nsymbolises or projects, rationalises, '\ntidies ' and may even\noccasionally misinterpret in detail a spiritual experience.

Not only is the main theme of his paper the\nproblem of deciding in practice whether both precognition and\nPK are basic irreducible concepts, or whether apparent cases of\none can always be reduced to cases of the other, but also he shows\nin passing (p. 62) that the term '\nprecognition '\nat least is unfortu-\nnate, implying as it does that the phenomenon is a form of know-\ning, an implication which seems not to be justified by our present\nknowledge of the facts.\nThe general problem is by no means new. Throughout its\nhistory scientific psychical research has been faced with the diffi-\nculty of classifying phenomena which tend most perversely to\noverlap, to masquerade as that which they are not, and to be shv\nof discovery in isolation. Two main schemes of classification\nhave been used, and neither has been entirely satisfactory. The\nfirst, that adopted by F. W. H. Myers in Human Personality, is a\nscheme dictated by the phenomena themselves and using mainly\npsychological concepts. This becomes inadequate as soon as it is\nrealized that while the surface manifestations, e.g. of trance\nmediumship or psychometry, may have a close family likeness the\nsources upon which they draw vary enormously, perhaps from\nmere hypermnesia to the activity of discarnate spirits The\nsecond scheme, that more commonly used or at least assumed\ntoday, IS based partly on experimental experience and partly on\nour common a ^non notions of time, causation, cognition, matter,\nIT' M A\/r\n^^herne encounters difficulties of the type brought\nout by Mr Mundle, and I would question here whether we are\nright to accept these a priori factors so readily. It is sufficiently\nestablished that the world of the psychical is a very queer one-\nhow queer we have as yet no means of telling. The danger of\nusing our everyday a priori framework is that it may lead us to\nIgnore certain possibilities which if followed up would give us a\nbetter understanding of what we have to deal with That this\nparticular framework is not necessary to our thinking is shown by\nits partial abandonment in modern physics.\nTheory must not run too far ahead of the facts. But it is idle\nto pretend that we can ever :vholly divorce fact from theory, or\n\fiQji] r . Correspondence 381\nrefrain from building hypotheses until we have had a good look\nat the bare data. We have to view the facts in the light of some\ntheory, but we can at least realize that it is a theory and make it as\nexplicit as possible, hoping by so doing to reveal its weaknesses and\nits potentialities.\nMy aim here is to show that by extending the scheme followed\nby Mr Mundle we find room for a new type of phenomenon not\nso far considered. If such a phenomenon is to be found, it should\nnot be very difficult to produce prima facie evidence for its\nexistence. On the other hand, if such prima facie evidence is dis-\ncovered, it will increase the problems of using this type of scheme\nat all. Difficulties of distinguishing between phenomena will be\nmultiplied, and it may be necessary to abandon the scheme\naltogether.\nAs things are, Mr Mundle recognises two main groups of\nphenomena, one cognitive and the other conative. The cognitive\ngroup consists of mental events related to other events, mental or\nphysical, in the past (retrocognition), the present, and the future\n(precognition). In the conative group we have an apparently\ndifferent type of mental events, bearing a relationship of a ditferent\nkind to physical events (P K) or mental events (telepathic suggestion)\nin the present or near future. (Mr Mundle does not mention\ntelepathic suggestion, but it fits in naturally here.)\nI am being purposely vague in my description of these two\ngroups. An attempt at better definition would only lead to dis-\ntortion. It will be seen that as they stand the two groups are not\non all fours. While the cognitive group covers past, present and,\nparadoxically, future, the conative group, in accordance with\nnormal experience, covers only present and future. But if we\nadmit the possibility of knowing what has not yet happened, we\nshould also be prepared to consider that of causing what has\nalready happened. Or, to put it another way, if a future event can\n'\ncause '\na present mental event, why cannot a future mental event\n'\ncause '\na present event?\nI suggest, therefore, that experiments should be conducted for\nprima facie evidence for what might be called '\nretroactive PK '.\nI cannot find that this has yet been done. In The Reach of the\nMind, for instance, Rhine says :\n'\nDisplacement in ESP tests has\nbecome a well-established phenomenon, even though it is not very\ncommon. ... It could not occur in PK in the same way, because\nof the difference in techniques '\n(p. 127). Now this is perfectly\ntrue of the classical PK experiments. The target is not changed\noften enough for a displacement of this type to be noticeable\n\u2014though it is interesting that Rhine mentions indications of a\ndisplacement in the other direction, e.g. the '\nlag effect '\nof Pratt\n\f382 Journal of the Society Jor Psychical Research [jan.\nand Woodruff. But experiments with more frequent changes of\ntarget would provide an opportunity for such an effect to appear.\nIf it did appear, however\u2014if, for instance, we found something\nsimilar to the - i displacements of telepathy\u2014we would at once\ncome up against a difficulty similar to those discussed by Mr\nMundle. Such an effect could be explained as a combination of\nstraight PK plus precognition of the next target, assuming that the\nchoice of target was not predetermined. (If it were, the alternative\nexplanation would be even simpler\u2014direct telepathic or clair-\nvoyant knowledge of the target.) And I do not see that this\ndifficulty can be entirely overcome. In all types of experiment\nsome alternative explanation would be possible, though not\nnecessarily probable. The most we could do would be to devise\nexperiments to which arguments of the type used by Mr Mundle\non pp. 75-6 would apply, i.e. where to explain the effect produced\nas being due to retroactive PK would be far more simple and\nplausible than any other. Such experiments are not easy to\ndevise ;\nbut we might be lucky enough to find, for example, a\nsubject who scored well on retroactive PK but got no results in\ndirect precognitive experiments.\nIt is not of much value to consider such possible experiments in\ndetail unless and until we have at least prima facie evidence that\nretroactive PK does in fact occur. It is sufficient for my present\npurpose to point out that, as in the cases considered by Mr Mundle,\nhere too it would be very difficult to bring about an experimental\nseparation of the various possible factors involved. And this,\nI suggest, may be due at least in part to the inadequacy of our\nconceptions of these factors.\nIt seems to me possible that we are going astray in assuming a\ncomplete separation between knowing and willing, cognition and\nconation. There are other reasons for this besides the experimental\nproblems so far considered. First, while we seem in ordinary life\nto know very well what we mean by knowing and willing, the\nattempts of philosophers and psychologists to analyse these con-\ncepts have been singularly unsuccessful. Hence we cannot\nsay with any confidence what the essential features of an act of\nknowing or an act of willing are. This is paralleled on the other\nside by the fact that it is also very difficult to give an account of\nwhat goes on in an '\nact of precognition '\nor an '\nact of PK '.\nWe\nare therefore on very shaky ground in trying to classify these\nlatter as cognitive and conative acts respectively.\nSecondly, what little we do know about the psychology of psi-\nphenomena seems to give some importance to the imagination.\nAnd the imagination may be regarded from different angles as\neither active or passive, as cognitive or conative, or as a neutral\n\fjg^jj\nCorrespondence 3^3\nground between the two. It is true that in laboratory tests for\nESP and PK the imagination plays little part, and is normally\nby-passed for direct motor-action. But outside the laboratory the\nimportance of the imagination is often brought out. One method\nof achieving success in telepathy seems to be\u2014in rather unsatis-\nfactory metaphorical terms\u2014to make the mind a blank, and then\nallow images to drift into it ; and, on the other hand, to achieve a\ndesired resuk by supernormal means (i.e. PK, etc.), it sometimes\nseems to be sufficient to imagine it happening. In both cases,\nimages play an important part, and there is nothing that can be\ntermed an act of cognition in the one case or an act of willing in\nthe other.\nAll this tends to show that there may be something unsatis-\nfactory for psychical research in adopting without question our\neveryday categories of cognition and conation. It might be of\nadvantage, at least for a while, to try to forget these divisions, and\nto make our thought and our language as non-committal as possible.\nOn the analogy of '\npsi-faculty '\nwe might talk of alpha-, beta-\nphenomena, etc., giving a definition of the phenomenon as far as\npossible in positivist terms. There remains the danger that we\nwould still regard these terms as nothing but new names for our\nold friends precognition, etc., but the more this danger is recog-\nnized and allowed for, the less formidable it will be. We may by\nthis means be able to emancipate ourselves from our earlier ways\nof thinking, and allow the facts to dictate to us a new and more\nsuitable scheme of reference.\nPamela M.

W. K. Mundle\nI AM going to discuss a point raised by Dr Thouless in his contri-\nbution to the symposium on a programme for the next ten years\nof research which appeared in the Journal of Parapsychology}\nThouless wrote: '\nI suggest investigation of the conditions of\nsingularization. Positive results in ESP or PK experiments\nrequire that the subject should have reacted to (or acted on) one\nparticular object or set of objects and not others of the same kind.\nThe problem of how it happens that the experimental object\nis thus picked out seems to have attracted little attention except\nfor the restricted case of what is called \" psychometry.\" '\nIn dis-\ncussing this problem I shall use the word '\nselectivity '\ninstead of\n'\nsingularization ', partly because it is more familiar, but also\nbecause it seems to me more neutral with respect to the question\nwhether the role of the subject is active or passive. (We speak\nnot only of people actively selecting things, but also of machines,\ne.g. radio sets, being passively selective.) I would state the prob-\nlem, then, as being to ascertain the conditions which influence\nselectivity. I shall only consider the problem as it arises in ESP\nexperiments. The problem appears much less conspicuous in\nPK experiments in which subjects have usually been able to look\nat the objects they were trying to influence.\nNow one\u2014and perhaps the most important\u2014virtue of Caring-\nton's theory of telepathy is that it offers us an explanation of the\nsubjects' selectivity. I know of no other theory which does this.\nPhysicalist theories are notoriously incapable of explaining why a\nsubject should respond to a radiation emanating from a certain\nbrain (or pack of cards) rather than that from any other brain (or\npack) within the same distance. On the other hand, to invoke\n1\n'\nA Program of Parapsychology ',\nJ. ParapsychoL, vol. 12, no. 2 (June\n1948) p. 117,\n38s\n\f386 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\n'\nrapport ' between subject and agent as a necessary condition of\ntelepathy is, in the absence of a theory, merely to give a label to\none of the facts which requires explanation.\nAs is well known, Carington explains telepathy by supposing\n(i) that an idea of the target object becomes associated in the\nmind of the agent (and\/or that of an experimenter) with a second\nidea ; (2) that this second idea (which he calls a K-idea) occurs,\nas a result of normal processes, in the mind of the subject ; (3) that\nthese two events tend to produce jointly a third event\u2014the subject's\nthinking of the target object. On this theory, the factor which\nmakes the subject select (or selective to) the target is the K-idea\nin the mind of the agent (or experimenter). It is difficult to under-\nstand how an idea could perform this role if it were one which was\nsimultaneously being entertained by people not participating in the\nexperiment ; but Carington pointed out that there will always be\none idea which will be entertained only by those who are parti-\ncipating, or, if entertained by non-participants, will not be so\nimportant to them\u2014namely the idea of '\nthis experiment '. We\nmust admit that Carington's theory does not take us as far as we\nwould wish, for we still cannot understand how one person's\nassociations could influence another person's experience in the\nconditions in question\u2014we do not know whether any mediating\nprocesses need occur, nor what their nature would be. Neverthe-\nless, our starting point in investigating selectivity ought surely to\nbe an attempt to submit Carington's theory to the test of experi-\nment. To do this I should suggest that we carry out some such\nexperiments as the following :\n(i) Using a subject who, like Mrs Stewart, has obtained good\nresults with several agents, we could employ two or more of these\nagents working in opposition (i.e. attending simultaneously to\ndiflFerent target-cards). At the start of each series each agent\nwould be given a different code-name and\/or picture to be asso-\nciated with the ensuing targets, and one of these code-names would\nbe selected at random and given to the subject. We should thus\nbe deliberately providing a K-idea to supplement the idea of '\nthis\nexperiment '. Precautions would be taken to ensure {a) that\nneither the subject nor the experimenter controlling the subject\nreceived any sensory clues regarding the other code-names in use\nand the allocation of code-names to agents ; and {b) that neither\nthe agents nor the experimenter(s) controlling the agents received\nany sensory clues regarding the code-name given to the subject.\nIf we found a regular tendency for the subject to get significant\nscores only on the cards being thought of by the agent with the\ncorresponding code-names, this would support Carington's theory.\n(ii) Alternatively, or in addition, we could employ only one\n\f195 1]\n'\nSelectivity in ESP Experiments 387\nagent, who would work simultaneously with two series of targets,\neach series being associated by the agent with a different code-\nname, one of which had been given to the subject.\nIt will be noticed that the former experiment is very similar in\ndesign to one which Dr Soal performed recently with Mrs Stewart.\n(This is described in \u00a7 33 of his Myers Lecture The Experimental\nSituation in Psychical Research.) Soal carried out two series, each\nof 400 trials, with two agents working in opposition. In the first\n200 trials of each series Mrs Stewart was informed that there were\ntwo agents, but not that they were working in opposition. Dr Soal\ntells us that '\nthe pooled results on the 400 trials show that with\nneither agent was her score significant '. In the second 200 trials\nof each series, Mrs Stewart was told the name of one of the two\nagents and was given to understand that this agent would be\nworking alone. In this case, the pooled results show a highly\nsignificant score on the targets of this agent with a chance score\non the targets of the other agent. Now these results are just what\nCarington's theory would predict, but the support which they give\nto this theory is unnecessarily weak. (We must of course remember\nthat Soal was not trying to test Carington's theory.)\nLet us consider Soal's conclusion\u2014that the results of the above\nexperiments '\nillustrate the importance of conscious orientation in\ntelepathy experiments '. This statement is somewhat vague, for\nwhat is meant by '\nconscious orientation '\n? Presumably Soal\nmeant by this the subject's adjusting herself to the experiment by\nimagining the agent at work. Conscious orientation, in this sense,\nwould involve her possessing knowledge of two kinds : [a) being\nacquainted with the person who acts as agent, i.e. having, by nor-\nmal social intercourse, established a personal relationship with\nthis person, or, at least, being familiar with the appearance of this\nperson ;^ {b) knowing that it is this person (identified by name or\nother verbal description) who is acting as agent. Was knowledge\nof either of these kinds necessary or favourable to Mrs Stewart's\nsuccess? Soal's above-mentioned experiments do not enable us\nto answer this question.^ The main interest of Carington's theory,\n* The subject might of course be familiar zvith the appearance of the\nperson who acts as agent through having seen a photograph, without\nhaving seen this person '\nin the flesh '. Whether the former is an ade-\nquate substitute for the latter is a matter for experiment. To simphfy\nexposition I shall ignore this complication in what follows.\n* Since this paper was written, a report of some long-distance experi-\nments with Mrs Stewart has been published by Bateman and Soal in the\nS.P.R. Journal (Vol. XXXV, No. 659). The results are highly relevant\nto the question I am considering here ; for in the Cambridge-Richmond\nseries, in which she was not acquainted with the agents, Mrs Stewart\nfailed completely, whereas in the London-Antwerp series, in which both\n\f388 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nin this context, is that it suggests that such knowledge may not be\nrelevant to a subject's selectivity. When Soal told Mrs Stewart\nthe name of one of the agents (suppose it was '\nJohn Brown ') this\nname may have been functioning, solely as a K-idea, in Carington's\nsense ; that is to say the name '\nJohn Brown '\nmay have made\nMrs Stewart select (selective to) the targets being thought of by\nJohn Brown solely because these targets were associated in the\nmind of John Brown with his ideas of himself and of his own name.\nMrs Stewart's being acquainted with this person called '\nJohn\nBrown '\nand\/or her knowing that it was this person who was\nacting as agent may have been irrelevant to her success.\nIt seems important to try to ascertain the relevance of the fac-\ntors to which Soal seems to have been referring when he spoke of\n'\nconscious orientation ', for it seems to be commonly taken for\ngranted that these factors are necessary, or at any rate favourable\nconditions of telepathy. I am not sure that I understand what\npsychical researchers mean by '\nrapport ', but I suspect that some,\nwhen they use this term, have in mind a theory to explain telepathy\n\u2014a vague theory which might be expressed by saying that '\nrap-\nport '\nmeans '\ndirect psychic contact '\nbetween two (or more)\npersons whose bodies are not manifested to each other's senses.\nOn this view, it would be natural to assume (i) that it is a necessary\ncondition of the establishment of such rapport that the persons in\nquestion should be previously acquainted with each other, and\/or\n(ii) that the more intimately they are acquainted the easier it will\nbe to establish such rapport. Adopting Carington's theory would\nnot imply that we should drop the word '\nrapport ' ; we could still\nsay that rapport is a necessary condition of telepathy, but rapport\nwould become a much more precise concept, to be defined not\nvaguely in terms of '\ndirect psychic contact '\n\u2014which, incidentally,\nsuggests that it is a matter of all or none\u2014but rather in terms of\ntwo (or more) minds entertaining the same (or similar) ideas,\nwhich is a matter of degree. On this view, a high degree of\nrapport might hold between people who were not acquainted with\neach other, yet the minimum degree of rapport\u2014two people\n'\nsharing '\na single idea\u2014might be a sufficient condition of tele-\npathy, if, for example, the idea in question was important to each\nof them and was not '\nshared '\nby anyone else. One reason why\nCarington's theory deserves serious attention is that there are\nof the agents were her close friends, Mrs Stewart was highly successful.\nThis strongly suggests that, for Mrs Stewart, being acquainted with the\nagent is a necessary condition of success. Unfortunately there was another\nfactor which may, the experimenters tell us, have adversely affected the\nCambridge-Richmond results, namely inadequate synchronisation of the\nstop-watches.\n\figji] Selectivity in ESP Experiments 389\nrecords of spontaneous cases in which '\nconscious orientation\n'\nseems to have played no part whatsoever. I have in mind the\ntype of case where a subject receives an impression of an accident\ninvolving no persons with whom the subject was acquainted or\nconnected (e.g. the case discussed by Mr Tyrrell in Proc. S.P.R.,\nVol. XLVIII, Part 173, pp. 89-91). In such cases I can think of\nno explanation of the subjects' selectivity except that provided by\nCarington's theory.\nWe require, then, to test the relevance to the subject's selectivity\nof the following factors :\n{x) the subject being acquainted with the person(s) who act(s)\nas agent(s) ;\n{y) the subject knowing (by name or other description) the\nidentity of the person(s) who act(s) as agent(s).\nI suggest, therefore, that the experiments which I proposed earlier\nbe performed under each of the following conditions :\n(1) with X and y both fulfilled.\n(2) with X but not y fulfilled.\n(3) with neither x nor y fulfilled.\nWe might for completeness try variation (4) i.e. with y but not x\nfulfilled. It is, however, difficult to see how the name (or a\ndescription) of an agent with whom the subject was not acquainted\ncould be relevant except as a K-idea, in which case the only dif-\nference between conditions (3) and (4) would be that in the former\ncase two K-ideas would be used, in the latter three. (I am\ncounting the idea of '\nthis experiment ' as a K-idea, as well as the\ncode-name.) I should not expect conditions (3) and (4) to yield\ndiff'erent results, but if they did it might be worth investigating\nwhether the description of the agent which was given to the subject\nhad to be a unique description (i.e. applicable to no one else) in\norder to affect the results. (In some cases a person's name is a\nunique description\u2014Whately Carington's probably was, and this\npoint may be relevant in applying his theory to his own experi-\nments with drawings in which many of the subjects were not\nacquainted with him.)\nOne further factor which might with profit be varied in the\nabove experiments is the subject's knowing the location of the\nagent(s). We already have one experiment whose results suggest\nthat this factor is irrelevant (reported by McMahan and Lauer in\nJournal of Parapsychology, Vol. 12, No. i). This result requires\nconfirmation.'^\n^ Some further confirmation has now been provided in the long-\ndistance experiments with Mrs Stewart. (Bateman and Soal, op. cit.,\npp. 266-7.)\n\f39\u00a9 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nWe may learn from such experiments that for different subjects\ndifferent sets of conditions are necessary for or favourable to\nselectivity. If, however, we found any subjects able to select the\nappropriate target under conditions (3), this would be an impor-\ntant conclusion and one which would call for a thorough testing of\nCarington's theory in all possible respects. One of the next steps\nwould be to test the sub-laws of the association theory\u2014the laws\nof recency and frequency. Carington found quantitative evidence\nthat these sub-laws had been fulfilled in some of his experiments\nwith drawings, and this should be checked in other experimental\nsituations. In connexion with the law of frequency, there would\nof course be two different factors to be investigated : , ,\n{a) the effect of repeating the conjunction of the idea of the\ntarget and the K-idea in the same agent.\n{b) the effect of increasing the number of agents in whose minds\nthese ideas are associated. '\nI shall now consider a possible criticism. It might be said\nthat any adequate theory of selectivity must be applicable to clair-\nvoyance as well as telepathy, whereas Carington's theory applies\nonly to telepathy. This criticism raises two issues. The first is\nwhether it is possible to discriminate between '\npure clairvoyance\n'\nand '\npure telepathy '. The second is whether Carington's theory\ncould be applied to explain selectivity in cases of '\npure clairvoy-\nance '. I shall briefly consider each of these issues.\nRegarding the first issue, I am inclined to think that in their\nrecent attempts to isolate '\npure telepathy '\nand '\npure clairvoy-\nance '\nexperimenters may have been pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp.\nAt any rate, there is one difficulty which they do not yet seem to\nhave considered. It is generally (and rightly) agreed that if, in a\ntelepathy experiment, an agent or experimenter at any time\nmentions aloud the target-object or a code from which this might\nbe inferred, this utterance, being a physical event, constitutes a\npotential object for the subject's clairvoyant faculty. It seems to\nbe taken for granted that if an agent or experimenter merely\nthinks of the target or a code without mentioning it aloud, there is\nno physical event constituting a potential object for clairvoyance.\nThis assumption seems to be unwarranted in view of the well-\nknown fact that our thinking is usually (some psychologists say\nalways) accompanied by certain physical events, notably the small\nmovements of one's tongue and larynx which occur as one silently\ntalks to oneself, and which systematically resemble the larger\nmovements which occur in these organs when one utters the\nsame words aloud. To admit this is not to adopt the (to my\nmind unacceptable) view which identifies thinking with sub-vocal\n\f1951] Selectivity in ESP Experiments 391\nspeech. But if we grant that sub-vocal speech movements are\nnormal unconscious concomitants of our thinking, how are we to\neliminate these as possible^ objects of clairvoyance? In the recent\n'\npure telepathy '\nexperiments in which the agent has employed\na code relating target-faces to numbers, the agent has presumably,\nin the process of memorising the code, run over it several times in\nunspoken words. This difficulty may be surmountable\u2014e.g. if the\nagent who uses the code only speaks a language not understood by\nthe subject\u2014but it is not my present purpose to explore such\navenues. It is at any rate certain that attempts to isolate telepathy\nand clairvoyance involve us in some very complicated problems.\nWe need not, however, postpone investigation of selectivity until\neach of these problems is solved or found to be insoluble. We\nmay be able to advance a long way in understanding selectivity by\nmeans of experiments whose design is relatively simple. In the\n'\ntelepathy '\nexperiments which I proposed above, I think we\nshould not at present bother about trying to eliminate all possi-\nbilities of clairvoyance, but should employ the GESP^ method.\nRegarding the second issue, it does not follow that because\nCarington's theory was devised to explain telepathy, it could not\nbe used to explain selectivity in cases of clairvoyance. The fol-\nlowing questions can be distinguished and may require different\nanswers : .\n, ,\n. .\n{a) What makes the subject select (selective to) the object\nwhich an experimenter has decreed to be the target, e.g. this pack\nrather than another?\n{b) How does a subject succeed to a significant extent in iden-\ntifying the nature of the target-object, e.g. the order of the target\npack?\n(These questions could be distinguished, though it does not seem\nnecessary to do so, in dealing with the facts usually attributed to\ntelepathy.) When these questions are distinguished in considering\nclairvoyance, the former can be answered by saying that the subject\n' Professor H. H. Price has pointed out to me that lip-reading has to be\nlearned and is difficult to learn, and that the sort of clairvoyant larynx-\nreading which I am postulating would be much more difficult to learn.\nThis must be granted. All that I am claiming is that since this sort of\nlarynx-reading cannot be ruled out as impossible, this undermines the\nview that recent experiments have re-established conclusively the occur-\nrence of '\npure telepathy '.\n^ GESP stands for '\nGeneral Extrasensory Perception and is applied\nto experiments in which the target cards lie successively before the agent's\neyes. Thus the subject may get his information either by clairvoyance\nfrom the cards themselves or by telepathy from the agent's perception\nof the cards.\n\f392 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nselects the pack in question because it is (most strongly) associated\nin the mind of an experimenter with his idea of ' this experiment '.^\nNow obviously we can test the applicability of Carington's\ntheory to the selectivity of subjects under conditions which have\nusually been called clairvoyant. Let us not bother at this stage\nabout excluding all possibilities of telepathy, but employ a method\nlike DT^ calling. We can arrange an experiment in which the\nexperimenter controlling the target (E C T, as we may call him) uses\ntwo or three alternative target packs, each associated by him (and\nonly by him) with a certain code-name, while the subject, located\nelsewhere, is given one of these code-names. If such experiments\nyielded the predicted results, there are several factors which it\nwould be interesting to vary one at a time : j . ...\n(1) the subject being acquainted with ECT.\n(2) the subject knowing by description the identity of ECT.\n(3) the subject knowing the location of ECT.\n(4) ECT knowing the location of the target pack corresponding\nto each code-name.\nSince the above was written, an important article by Soal and\nBateman has appeared in the Journal of Parapsychology (Septem-\nber 1950) giving a detailed report of all the experiments performed\nwith Mrs Stewart up to July 1949 in which two or more agents\nhave been used in opposition or in conjunction. Much of this\nmaterial has not been previously published, and the results display\nsome new and interesting features, notably :\n(i) When Mrs Stewart has been working successfully with\nagent No. i, and agent No. 2 is introduced acting in opposition to\nNo. I, Mrs Stewart continues to work with No. i and '\nignores'\nNo. 2. This feature recurred consistently in a series of experi-\nments in which Mrs Stewart was fully informed as to the identity\nof the agents and their roles and in which agent No. 2 was a person\nwith whom Mrs Stewart had previously worked very successfully.\n^ Professor Price has pointed out to me that what I say here would\napply only in the experimental situation, for in a case of spontaneous\nclairvoyance there would be no experimenter decreeing that a certain\nobject is the target. I should, however, recommend that in examining\nspontaneous cases of apparently pure clairvoyance we should look for a\nperson who might be performing this function of the experimenter,\ni.e. a person in whose mind the clairvoyantly perceived object might be\nassociated with a K-idea. Could we be certain in any given case that no\nsuch person existed?\nDT stands for '\nDown Through ', and is applied to experiments in\nwhich the subject guesses the order of the pack from top to bottom, the\norder not being observed by anyone until the subject's guesses are\ncompleted. This method does not eliminate precognitive telepathy.\n\f195 1] \" Selectivity in ESP Experiments 393\n(ii) It appears that when several agents are used in conjunction\n(i.e. each attending simuhaneously to the same target), Mrs Stew-\nart works with only one of these agents and '\nignores '\nthe others.\nThis very interesting conclusion is an inference based on two\ntypes of experiments :\n{a) in which a single agent is used for the first 200 calls and a\nsecond agent acts in conjunction with the former for the second\n200 calls. There were three experiments of this design. In two\nof them Mrs Stewart got a significant score for the first 200 calls,\nand the conjunction score for the other 200 was at approximately\nthe same level. In the third case, the person who was used as\nagent No. i appears to have been a bad agent (independent\nevidence of this was obtained). The scoring for the first 200 calls\nwas at chance-level, but was significant for the second 200.\n{b) in which the same two (or three) agents are used throughout\na block of 400 calls, their roles alternating every 50 calls between\nopposition and conjunction. If we take the first four experiments\nof this type, we find that when the agents were in opposition\nMrs Stewart obtained in each case a significant score with one\nagent and chance scores with the other(s). If we take the pooled\nresults of these four experiments, we find that the conjunction\nscore and the highest opposition score are both highly significant.\nThe conjunction score is in fact the lower (209\/800 against\n231\/800)\n\u2014\nbut there is no significant difference between these scores\n(P = o.i6).\nOne cannot do justice in such a brief summary to the material\ncontained in this article. However, these latest results do not,\nso far as the writer can see, provide any grounds for choosing\nbetween the two theories of '\nrapport '\nwhich have been discussed\nearlier\u2014the theory of '\nconscious orientation '\non the part of the\nsubject, and the theory suggested by Carington. The disclosure\nof these new facts does, however, accentuate the problem discussed\nin this paper, and provides a further challenge to us to try to ascer-\ntain the factors which influence selectivity in psi-phenomena.\nDepartment of Philosophy, C.

Supplementary Vol-\nume XXIV to Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society. Lon-\ndon, Harrison & Sons, 1950. 231 pp. 21s.\nAt the annual joint meeting of the Mind Association and the\nAristotelian Society, held at Bristol in July 1950, there was a\nsymposium on the relevance of psychical research to philosophy.\nThe three contributors to it were Mrs M. Kneale, Mr R. Robinson,\nand Mr C. W. K. Mundle. Their papers will be found on\npp. 173-231 of the present volume. Before discussing them, it\nmay be well to point out that during the last twenty years there\nhas been a change in the attitude of professional philosophers\ntowards their own subject. For good or ill, many of them now\nthink that the traditional problems of philosophy are in the end\nproblems about language, and are to be solved (or else shown to be\nnonsensical) by methods of linguistic analysis. This linguistic\nconception of philosophy has not yet spread very far beyond\nprofessional circles, and may not be familiar to all readers of the\nJournal.\nIn the first paper, Mrs Kneale argues that even if we accept the\nlinguistic conception of philosophy, the facts discovered by\npsychical researchers are still relevant to philosophical problems ;\nwhat they show is that common sense and scientific terminology\nare not, in all respects, adequate for the description and explana-\ntion of all known empirical facts (p. 176). Thus the physical\nphenomena of psychical research call for some revision of the\nterminology of physics, as the phenomena of magnetism did long\nago. Again, the mental phenomena show that a purely Behaviour-\nistic terminology is inadequate for describing all occurrences in\nhuman beings. When we consider telepathy, we can see that an\n'\ninner life '\nterminology is needed as well. PK shows us that the\nold problem of the relation of mind and body is not so dead as\nBehaviourists think; it compels us to enquire into the relation\nbetween the '\ninner life '\nterminology and the '\nmaterial object\n'\nterminology. It follows that the hypothesis of survival is not\nmeaningless, as an over-indulgence in Behaviouristic terminology\nmight lead us to suppose. But in all these cases, Mrs Kneale thinks,\nthe chief service of psychical research to philosophy is to save us\nfrom '\nforgetting the obvious '. Thus, it ought to have been\nobvious to anyone who reflects on mental images, or hallucina-\ntions, or eidetic images, or voluntary action, that an inner life\nterminology is needed in any case. Psychical research mainly\n\f396 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nprovides an a fortiori argument for something we ought to have\nknown already.\nI think that Mrs Kneale, in her laudable endeavour to conciliate\nthe Linguistic Analyst, has over-stated her case. Can this be the\nonly lesson which the phenomena of clairvoyance have for philo-\nsophers ? Perhaps\u2014if clairvoyance were at all analogous to ordin-\nary sense-perception. But surely it is not. (Mrs Kneale merely\nmentions clairvoyance in passing and does not discuss it.) And\nwhat of precognition Here again Mrs Kneale takes the same over-\nmodest line. She points out that precognition is not foreknowledge,\nbut only fore-imaging. She thinks, or at least hopes, that no very\nradical revision of the conceptions of Time and Causation will be\nneeded ; and she is sure that the phenomena of precognition give\nno support to mystical doctrines or to theories about ' the nothing-\nness of Time '. Even so, can it really be maintained that precog-\nnition merely provides us with an a fortiori argument for accepting\na terminology which we ought to have accepted in any case?\nOn the contrary, it seems to break the rules of all the existing\nterminologies, physical or psychological, introspective or Behavi-\nouristic. It is not altogether surprising that Mr Robinson accuses\nMrs Kneale of '\ndamning the importance of psychical research for\nphilosophy with faint praise '.\nMr Robinson himself, however, thinks that even this faint\npraise is unjustified. If the linguistic conception of philosophy\nis accepted, he can find only one thing in the literature of psychical\nresearch which could instruct a philosopher ; and that is the\nterminology used by psychical researchers themselves. For\nexample, when one calls a coincidence a case of telepathy one is\nnot explaining it ; one is denying the possibility of explaining it.\nAccording to Mr Robinson, the whole point of a phrase like\n'\nESP '\nis to denote a process in which information is acquired\nby no means at all. Again, Mrs Kneale does not explain precog-\nnition by calling it '\nfore-imaging '\n; she is only telling us that\nthere is no explanation of the fact that Mr A. had an image resem-\nbling X before X actually occurred. And supposing we did some\nday discover the means by which telepathy occurs, most psychical\nresearchers would cease to be interested in telepathy. For it is\nonly '\nmeansless '\ncognition which is relevant to the metaphysical\nand theological theories which most of them wish to maintain.\nBut what if we reject the purely linguistic conception of philo-\nsophy.' (Mr Robinson, himself, I think does wish to reject it.)\nThen he is willing to admit that psychical research is relevant to\nphilosophy in two important ways. First, if supernormal cog-\nnition does really occur, we shall have to conclude that Empiricism\nis false. Empiricism tells us that no synthetic proposition is to\n\f1951] Reviews 397\nbe accepted unless it is supported by the evidence of the senses ;\nand in ESP, if it does really occur, we are acquiring factual infor-\nmation without the evidence of the senses. (As Mr Mundle points\nout later, it would be very odd if Empiricism could be refuted by\nempirical facts. Mr Robinson's definition of Empiricism is surely\ntoo narrow. In any case, the classical Empiricists also laid great\nstress on the evidence of introspection. Mr Robinson seems to\nhave forgotten the importance which Hume attached to '\nimpres-\nsion of reflection i.e. introspective data.)\nSecondly, Mr Robinson also admits that psychical research is\nrelevant to what he calls '\nthe theory of man '. In his view, we\nhave to choose between two philosophical theories of human nature:\non the one hand, the Platonic theory, i.e. the dualistic interaction\ntheory, which regards mind and body as two distinct entities ;\non the other, the Aristotelian theory (' the soul is the form of the\nbody ') whose modern form is philosophical Behaviourism. By\nthe end of the nineteenth century, it seemed that the question was\nsettled for good and all. The biological sciences had apparently\nshown that Plato was wrong and Aristotle right, to the confusion\nof the theologians and other religious-minded persons. But then\nit occurred to the Platonic party that the scientists might be\ndefeated by their own weapons\u2014by appeal to empirical facts.\nTheir plan was to re-establish the Platonic theory of human\nnature, not by theological or metaphysical arguments, but by\nscientific ones. And that, according to Mr Robinson, is what\npsychical research consists of. Accordingly, he is not surprised\nto find that psychical researchers attach so much importance to\n'\nthe attempt to communicate with men who are not at the time\nattached to any specimen of homo sapiens '\n(p. 202).\nMr Robinson admits that the psychical researchers have suc-\nceeded in collecting a number of '\nqueer coincidences '. But he\nstill adheres to the Aristotelian theory of human nature. Is this\nirrational.? He claims that it is not. No one can be expected to\nexplain all the queer coincidences which happen from time to\ntime. And the psychical researchers themselves cannot explain\nthem ; to label them '\ntelepathy ', '\nprecognition ', etc., is not to\nexplain them. If one accepted the Platonic theory of human\nnature on such grounds, one would be falling into the fallacy\ncalled the argument from ignorance\n\u2014' this proposition must be\ntrue because we do not know for certain that it is false '.\nI cannot but think that here Mr Robinson proves too much.\nIf he were right, no theory could ever be refuted, or even weakened,\nby adverse empirical evidence. The adverse evidence could\nalways be written off as just a '\nqueer coincidence '\n\u2014inexplicable\nbut needing no explanation. It does not follow either that if the\n\f398 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\n'\nAristotelian '\ntheory were refuted by empirical evidence, the\n'\nPlatonic '\ntheory must be true. There may be other alternatives.\nFor example, the Buddhist analysis of human nature is neither\nPlatonic nor Aristotelian.\nIn the last page or two of his paper, Mr Robinson takes back\nhis admissions that the coincidences collected by psychical re-\nsearchers are at any rate queer. On the contrary, the emotional\naura which they have for him is '\nboredom and banality '. An\nalleged communication from Henry Sidgwick about the relation\nof mind and body strikes him as '\nhere and there ridiculous but\notherwise a dead bore '\n(p. 204). To him, the reports of psychical\nresearchers are like dead cliches or pointless schoolboy jokes. He\ncannot go to five tea parties without hearing at least one '\nsuper-\nnormal '\nstory\u2014fully authenticated, of course. In his view the\ntrouble with the data of psychical research is not that they are too\nstrange and queer to be believed ; on the contrary, they are so\ninsufferably tedious that one can hardly give one's attention to\nthem.\nI think that this sort of emotional reaction is not at all uncom-\nmon, especially among highly-educated people ; and psychical\nresearchers should give more thought to it than they have, if\nthey want to understand and remove the '\nresistance '\nwhich their\ndata often meet with. Indeed, they would do well to read the\nwhole of Mr Robinson's paper with care. It is a very good state-\nment of views which are widely held, but not nowadays often\nexpressed.\nMr Mundle's paper is very interesting indeed. But it is also\nvery long and cannot be adequately summarised in a paragraph or\ntwo. I shall confine myself to four of the most important points\nin it.\nFirst, when we ask whether psychical research is relevant to\nphilosophy, what do we mean by '\npsychical research\n'\n} Accord-\ning to Mr Mundle, we may mean (i) the observational data, or\n(2) the primary hypotheses, or (3) the speculative theories which\nhave been suggested for co-ordinating the primary hypotheses.\nIf we mean the observational data, he thinks that these can be\ndescribed in Behavouristic terminology, and indeed, must be.\nThe experimenter's data consist in '\nthe percipient's overt be-\nhaviour and the written record produced thereby '\n(p. 209). And\neven in spontaneous cases, the private experiences of the percipi-\nent are not evidence, unless they result in some kind of overt\naction which can be confirmed by witnesses or documents.\n'\nPsychical researchers accept as evidence only what Behaviourists\ncan acknowledge as hard facts '\n(p. 209). I should have thought,\non the contrary, that in the spontaneous cases the percipient's\n\f195 1] Reviews 399\novert actions are only of interest because they tend to show that the\nprivate experiences did, in fact, occur at or about the time when the\npercipient says they did.\nSecondly, with regard to the relation of mind and body, some\nphilosophers think that psi-phenomena, if they prove nothing\nelse, do at least prove that Epiphenomenalism is false. Mr Mundle\ndoes not agree. For example, what we take to be telepathy may\nbe a causal transaction between a brain event in the agent and a\nmental event in the precipient (it would then be a sort of clairvoy-\nance). And surely this account of the matter is compatible with\nEpiphenomenalism.'' I think that it is only compatible with a new\nand extended version of Epiphenomenalism. For in ordinary\nEpiphenomenalism the cause of a mental event in Mr A. is an\nevent in Mr A.'s own brain, not in someone else's. In any case,\nit is hard to see how precognition could be compatible with any\nform of Epiphenomenalism. And clairvoyance of the ordinary\nkind, where the '\nobject ' is not a brain event but some non-physio-\nlogical entity like a Zener card or a sealed-up letter, would not be\ncompatible with it either.\nThirdly, Mr Mundle asks us to consider a new way of classifying\npsi-phenomena, though he does not ask us to accept it. In the\nnew classification we abandon the terms '\nmental ' and '\nphysical ',\nand replace them by '\nhuman '\nand '\nnon-human '\nrespectively.\nThen we have (i) non-chance relations between human events and\nother human events in the same or in different persons ; (2) non-\nchance relations between human events and non-human events.\nThe first head would cover '\ninter-personal ' P K, as well as tele-\npathy. The second would cover ordinary PK, clairvoyance, and\npoltergeists.\nThis new classification would no doubt save us from begging\nquestions about the relations between mind and body, and would\nplease the Behaviourists whom Mr Mundle is so anxious to\nconciliate. But there are disadvantages in it too. Precognition\nwould fall partly under the first head and partly under the second ;\nand the most important thing about it\u2014namely, its reference to\nthe future\u2014would tend to escape our notice. Again, the Survival-\nist explanations of mediumistic communications would be ruled\nout by definition, unless events in discarnate minds are counted as\n'\nhuman events '\n; and if they were, the advantage Mr Mundle\nhopes to gain, of conciliating Behaviourists and other '\ntough-\nminded '\nthinkers, would be lost. Moreover, there is some\nevidence that ESP occurs occasionally in non-human animals ;\nand this would be ruled out also.\nFourthly, Mr Mundle distinguishes between two ways of inter-\npreting psi-phenomena of the '\nmental ' kind (to return to the\n\f400 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\ntraditional classification). In the one, the fundamental concept is\ncausatioji; in the other, it is cognition. If we accept the causal\ninterpretation, he thinks we shall have to re-define the term\n'\ncausal connection '. At any rate, we must not so define it as to\nmake spatio-temporal contiguity part of its meaning, nor in such a\nway that the proposition '\na cause precedes its effect ' is analytic.\nMoreover, '\nis happening '\nmust not be so defined that it is equi-\nvalent to '\nis coming into existence '. For in precognition (on the\ncausal interpretation) a future event has effects. It must therefore\nbe in existence, though it is not yet happening.\nMr Mundle then points out that psychical researchers have\nproduced explanations of the queer occurrences which they study,\ndespite Mr Robinson's denials. They have done it, as other\nscientists do it, by postulating '\ninterphenomena ' to make the\nobserved phenomena intelligible. Thus they try to explain\ntelepathy by the theory of a Common Unconscious, i.e. by postu-\nlating mental interphenomena ; and they conceive the Common\nUnconscious as an inter-personally effective store of traces or\nengrams. Mr Mundle does not think much of this explanation.\nHe objects that there is no reason to call this inter-personal, trace-\nbearing medium '\nmental '. Perhaps not. But if it is physical,\nit will not do what is wanted, unless we go back to a Radiation\nTheory of telepathy, which Mr Mundle has already rejected\n(pp. 221-2). I think he has ignored another relevant point.\nIt may be argued that an unconscious of some kind has to be\npostulated in any case, in order to explain the data of abnormal\npsychology ; and we call it '\nmental \\ faute de mieux, because our\nexplanation will only work if processes analogous to conscious\nplanning are supposed to go on in it. If so, it is economical to\nmake use of the postulated unconscious for explaining psi-\nphenomena too (since we have to put up with an unconscious in\nany case) ; and we can do this by supposing that processes in the\nunconscious are inter-personal. Moreover, the Freudian mechan-\nisms of repression and symbolic distortion are ready to our hands\nfor explaining the queer and devious ways in which psi-contents\nmanifest themselves in consciousness and in behaviour.\nHowever this may be, Mr Mundle thinks we may do better if we\ninterpret psi-phenomena cognitively instead of causally. If cog-\nnitive relations really do span spatial and temporal gaps, as\nphilosophers suppose, will not this give us just what we want?\nThe cognitions we should have to postulate would be themselves\nuncognized (i.e. subliminal) ; so they too would be '\ninterpheno-\nmena '. I am not sure that this cognitive explanation really differs\nso much from the causal explanation which Mr Mundle has\nrejected. Once we descend below the conscious level\u2014as we\n\f1951] >'v- ,;, .-. .. Reviews . 401\nhave to, on both theories ahke\u2014the distinction between '\nbeing an\nawareness of ' and '\nbeing an effect of '\nseems to lose much of its\nsharpness ; and the lower we descend (if this spatial metaphor is\nappropriate) the less sharp the distinction becomes. Moreover,\nif we apply the '\ncognitive '\ntheory to telepathy, we shall have to\nallow that there is such a thing as unconscious inspection of the\ncontents of another mind ; and this surely is something for which\nwe can find no analogy in the sphere of conscious cognition.\nMr Mundle leaves it to the audience to decide whether these\nissues are among the ones which philosophers ought to discuss.\nBut he himself clearly thinks that the answer is '\nyes '\n; and he is\nclearly right.\nH. H. Price\nHarry Price : The Biography of a Ghost-hunter. By Paul\nTabori. London, Athenaeum Press, 1950. viii, 316 pp.\nII plates. 15s.\nHarry Price's long and varied career as an investigator of the\nphysical phenomena of psychical research deserved a biographical\nrecord, and the choice of Mr Tabori to compile it was a happy\none. In his skilled hands a great number and variety of incidents\nare described in an interesting way. He lays proper stress on\nHarry Price's wide reading, unflagging energy, mechanical skill,\nand knowledge of methods of deception, but he makes it clear that\nhe is not blind to some peculiarities of temperament which\nbrought Harry Price into conflict not only with persons whose\nviews of psychic phenomena were opposed to his own, but with\nothers who shared in general his opinions and interests and were\nanxious to co-operate with him. In fact, for the official biography\nof a man recently dead, the book is remarkably and commendably\nfrank.\nThe book is very largely based on '\nthe vast correspondence he\n[Harry Price] carried on, much of it unpublished and unpublish-\nable ', but for an informed judgment on some of the controversial\nmatters dealt with by Mr Tabori there are other documents that\nthe reader would be well advised to consult. For example, as to\nHarry Price's proposals for the amalgamation of the self-styled\n'\nNational Laboratory of Psychical Research '\nwith the S.P.R., he\nshould read our Journal, vol. XXVII, p. 25, and for the much\ndebated '\nexposure '\nof Rudi Schneider he should put side by side\nthe letters to Rudi printed on pp. 113 and 116 of this book with\nthe facts stated by Lord Charles Hope in S.P.R. Proceedings,\nVol. XLI at pp. 284-91. We regret that Mr Tabori appears to\nendorse Harry Price's preposterous claims to have contributed by\n\f402 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nhis researches to the foundation of the Perrott Studentship at\nTrinity College, Cambridge, and the acceptance by New College,\nOxford, of the reversion of the Blennerhassett Trust.\nMr Tabori pays a graceful tribute to the help he received in\npreparing the book from Mrs Goldney and Dr Dingwall, who are\nfamiliar with many of the events related in the book. On some of\nthese, particularly the Borley case, a more complete report based\non a wider range of evidence than seems to have been accessible\nto Mr Tabori would be welcome. May we hope that they will\nsee their way to provide it.''\nW. H. S.\nWilliam James : A Selection from his Writings. Edited\nwith a commentary by Margaret Knight. Harmondsworth,\nPenguin Books, 1950. 248 pp. is. 6d.\nMembers of the Society for Psychical Research will be interested\nto read this book on our distinguished former president, Professor\nWilliam James. James was a vivid and self-revealing writer and\nthe greater part of the book is composed of judiciously chosen\nextracts from his own writings. These are preceded by a bio-\ngraphical account which helps one to understand the family\nsituation that made James the intellectual adventurer that he was.\nWhile the extracts are mostly from his psychological writings and\nnot from any contributions he made to psychical research, the\nbiographical sketch and the writings make clear why he was\nattracted to psychical research. Born into an argumentative\nfamily, he was always impatient of accepted orthodoxies and had a\nquick eye for the unexpected fact. That psychical research did\nnot fit into the scheme of the biological psychology which he\nhimself taught was for him a reason for being interested in it\nrather than ignoring it as a more conventionally minded man\nmight have done. As in his study of religion in his Gilford Lectures,\nhe brought to bear on psychical research an inquiring and open\nmind with a tendency to scepticism which led him to question the\ndogmas of orthodox science no less than any new and unexpected\nphenomena.\nR.

The\nphysical reactions displayed in some of the revivalist movements\nchronicled are, indeed, odd enough ; men and vi^omen are shown\nexpressing their sentiments by leaping, shaking, rolUng, trembling,\ntalking gibberish, swelling up, and (my own favourite) '\nbarking\ndemurely '\nat those who preached to them.\nAs bizarre, and of greater interest to psychical research, are the\nborderline phenomena which sometimes accompanied these mani-\nfestations. The most notable are perhaps those seen in the pro-\nphesying of the Camisard Huguenots after the Revocation of the\nEdict of Nantes ; and those of the Jansenist convulsionaries of\nSaint-Medard, of which Dr Dingwall has written a short account.^\nA particularly fascinating point about the earlier movement is\nthat its '\nprophets '\nwere apparently taught some sort of psycho-\nphysical technique.

His school was at Mont Peyra in the\nDauphine ... he initiated his pupils, exercised by two or three\ndays' fasting, into the four grades of prophecy' which were known\nas '\nI'Avertissement, le Souffle, la Prophetic and le Don '.\nThose interested in the natural history of contemplation may find\nit significant that a pupil who had reached the stage of '\nle Don '\nfrequently abandoned his former preaching activities ; activities\nwhose normal pattern ran thus: '\nThe prophet beat his head with\nhis hands for some time, then fell down on his back '\n(sometimes\naccompanied by his more impressionable congregations) '\nhis\nstomach and throat swelled up, and he remained speechless' for\nsome time, then '\nbroke out into utterance.'\nThe five or six hundred children between three and fifteen who\nwere trained at this school seem, however, to have shewn more\ninteresting results than this ; there is evidence that '\nsome drove\nknives into themselves ', exposed themselves to fire, and fell from\nrocks twelve feet high without being injured, while others shewed\nthat they possessed extrasensory powers, narrating events which\nwere taking place at a distance, and accurately foretelling the future.\nThe whole episode, with its apparently deliberate organization\nand training of children below the age of puberty, is curiously\nreminiscent of what is said about the psychical techniques of the\nEast.\nThe Saint-M^dard affair has a more spontaneous ring. It began\nquite simply with the cure of a number of sick people at the tomb\nof the Jansenist ascetic, Frangois de Paris. Then, after a convul-\n^ Some Human Oddities.

Mgr Knox points out that they were at !1\nfirst regarded as the concomitants of healing ; but that quite soon i\ntheir occurrence became an end in itself, as an evidence of the i\nmiraculous. Later still came the secours ; this was at first regarded \\\nas a counter-irritant to the pain of the healing convulsion ;\nthen, j\nand with greater reason, it too was held as proof that the super- i\nnatural was at work. The secours, for which the convulsionaries 1\nmight crave as a source of relief, took a variety of forms. The\nsufferer might ask to be trodden on ; to be subjected to the pres- |\nsure of heavy weights ; to be beaten ; to be prodded by sharp |\nobjects, such as swords or spits (which, curiously enough, very\noften pierced the clothes, but never the skin) ; or to be crucified.\nThe evidence for these occurrences is very good, in so far it was\ncollected and recorded by persons who would much rather have\nbelieved them to be faked ; for the logical justification of these\n'\nmiracles '\nwas to provide support for the Jansenist teachings,\nand to protest against the enforcement of the Bull '\nUnigenitus\n'\nwhich condemned these ; and they were chronicled by those\nwho held the opposite view.

It may also be remarked that,\nas in the case of Rasputin, some of the healings later performed\nhad little to do with the personal sanctity of the healer ;\nthus, for\ninstance, the numbers of cures of ulcers and abscesses attributed\nto one particular woman shewed no diminution when she took to\nsexual irregularity.

Al-\nthough the two states have many features in common, it would be\npremature to say that they are identical. Some evidence pointing\nto a difference between them has been provided by the electro-\nencephalograph. In the hypnotic trance, the E.E.G. shows the\nsame pattern as the waking state. Experiments carried out by\nJ. L.

It is\nalso of interest that Thomson, Forbes, and Bolles, with a subject\nwho was able voluntarily to induce light trance states in himself,\nfound an E.E.G. which was characteristic of light sleep (see Amer.\nJ.

O.\nDiANETics : The Modern Science of Mental Health. By\nL. Ron Hubbard. New York, Hermitage House, 1950.\nxxvii, 452 pp. $5.00.\nThis book is certainly a work of genius. The author claims to\nhave discovered, by following the Scientific Method, not only\nhow the mind works in health but also the one true cause of all\npsychological illness. He presents a new method of psycho-\ntherapy which he guarantees will cure all cases of such illness\nwithout fail, and will further transform normal man into superman.\nThe genius of the author lies, however, not in the painstaking\nand accurate manner in which he has accumulated, sorted, and\npresented his evidence, for there is none\u2014not one scrap ; nor in\nhis powers of invention and salesmanship, magnificent though\nthey are (his self-assurance and arrogance are superb) ; but it is\nin the fact that he has been able to produce a system of psychology\nbased on the most obvious untruths which has nevertheless, in\nAmerica, competed with and to a large extent defeated all rival\nsystems of redemption. The author must have realized that people\nin these times will listen to any Messiah who claims complete\nauthority in the name of Science and will relieve them of the\n\f4o6 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nburden of being morally responsible for their actions. Mr Hub-\nbard's system has the further advantages of undercutting its\nrivals in cost, and in the fact that anyone can practise it. The sole\nqualification seems to be the purchase of Mr Hubbard's book ;\nthis of course saves the tiresome business of an expensive medical\ntraining.\nDianetics consists of : (i) rewriting a lot of platitudes in brand\nnew jargon (' Aberree '\nis a good example) ;\n(ii) large quantities of\nFreud rewritten in a mixture of current teen-age American and\nelectronic terminology ;\n(iii) the crib of the engram.\nThe basic idea in dianetics is that the mind consists of two\nsections : {a) the Analytic Mind which works as a perfect com-\nputing machine ; and [b) the Reactive Mind, a jazzed-up version\nof that well-worn vehicle, the unconscious, which causes all our\ntroubles by interfering with {a). It appears that whenever we are\nunconscious, asleep, injured, drugged, or in utero, the '\nreactive\n*\nmind is wide awake, picks up all painful stimuli, and stores them\nas impressions on the actual protoplasm of the brain cells. These\nimpressions are the engrams, and cause the bulk of our troubles\nfrom ulcers to war. Dianetic therapy exorcises them, and super-\nman, the perfect analytical machine, is produced. The patient is\nrelieved of all responsibility for his actions since he can either\nblame the engrams or function happily in the iron determinism of\na perfect machine.\nThe technique of Dianetic Therapy, though this fact is heavily\ndisguised, consists of powerful suggestion applied during a light\nhypnotic trance to a gullible subject. The subject, having had\nthe theory of engrams explained to him, obligingly '\nrecalls\n'\ninfantile or pre-natal experiences, with cathartic accompaniment.\nMr Hubbard's dismissal of ESP as an explanation of the alleged\nability of dianetic therapy to recall pre-natal experiences is, of\ncourse, otiose. Indeed, his statement that one '\nshould not accept\ntelepathy any more than he would accept ESP '\n(p. 321) to account\nfor the '\nphenomena '\nis a measure of the half-knowledge and\nconfused thinking which pervades the book.\nDianetics is the Mumbojumbology of Dr Rhubarb come to life.\nMr Hubbard might well have taken his cue from the following\nextract from Beachcomber's column published in the Daily\nExpress a few months ago :\nOne or two people have asked what is meant by Mumbojumbology,\nof which Dr Rhubarb is the foremost living exponent. It means\nidiotic veneration. The Abracadabrists, led by Bottelburg, discovered\nthat any drivel uttered repeatedly, and in an authoritative tone, will be\naccepted today with the fervour formerly accorded to the worship of an\nAfrican idol. But Dr Rhubarb widened the appeal of the new philo-\n\f195 1] ^- Reviews 407\nsophy by relying less on completely meaningless sentences than\nAbracadabraism had done. He evolved a system of half-meanings\nuttered in a jargon of bastard Latin and Greek words. He also concen-\ntrated on clothing obvious lies in pseudo-scientific gibberish.\nThe depressing aspect of the whole shameful affair is that half\na million Americans, some of whom are sincere and intelligent\npeople, have fallen for it.\nJ.

It is, as far as I know, the first adequately planned and\nsupervised field experiment in which dowsers and professional\ngeologists have been matched on equal terms. It was not the\npurpose of the experimenters '\nto present an evaluation of the\nevidence for and against the general claims of water diviners or of\nthe conclusions reached by other investigators. . . . We should\nnot wish to be interpreted as believing that we have contributed\nany findings which radically change the overall research situation'.\nThe problem which they set themselves was simply :\n'\nCan\nwater diviners find water under conditions in which the professional\ngeologist is unable to do so? '\nIt was necessary to choose a level\nterrain without surface water or wells which would betray the\npresence of underground water, and in which digging or drilling\ncould be used without great expense to check the results.

Those interested write\nto : Gardner Murphy, Ashland, N.H.\nTwenty-seven dowsers were finally selected (22 men, 4 women,\nI adolescent girl). Details of the life history and of the dowsing\nhistory of each were noted. At the close of the interview the\ndiviner was conducted to a spot near but out of sight of the test\nground, where he was blindfolded. Most of the diviners brought\ntheir own sticks or rods with them, and it is interesting to note that\nnot one of them subscribed to a psychic or psychokinetic theory of\ndowsing ; all believed it to be an as yet unexplained physical\nphenomenon.\nEach dowser was led over the site first with blindfold and then\nwithout. Records were taken of his method of working, and of\nthe number, intensity, and form of the rod-movements. As a\nrule, there were several points with blindfold and several without\nat which the rod turned and an attempt was made to get the dowser\nto specify depth and rate of flow at each point ; most were very\nreluctant to specify rate of flow except vaguely as '\ngood '\nor\n'\npoor '. The dowser was asked to name his '\nbest ' spot chosen\nwith blindfold and his '\nbest '\nwithout blindfold, and for these\ntwo spots a quantitative estimate of rate of flow and depth was\ninsisted on.\nSubsequently Trefethen, the Professor of Geology, and a local\nwater engineer made their own estimates of the depth and rate of\nflow at sixteen pre-arranged points. The experts quite properly\nmade use of their knowledge of the existence of a nearby well: '\n. . .\n.\nknowing that the water in soft soil must be nearly level, they could\nproperly apply their information. The dowsers, thinking and\nworking in terms of \" veins \" of water (which did not of course\nexist) could hardly make use of the fact of the well even had they\nknown about it'.\nThen pipes were driven down to determine the depth, and rate\nof flow was estimated by pumping timed with a stop-watch.\nThis was done (with certain unavoidable exceptions) at each\nindicated point. The results are illustrated graphically, as '\nscat-\nter '\ndiagrams. In the case of the dowsers there was no general\ncorrespondence between the estimates and the actual facts. Both\ndepth and rate of flow were greatly overestimated. For example,\na blindfolded dowser estimated 75 gallons per minute when the\nactual flow was i gallon per minute, while another gave 25 ft.\nwhere the depth was 4 ft. The two '\nexperts '\non the other hand\nestimated quite closely the over-all depth of the water table and\nthe depth at specific points, and also agreed with each other.\nThe correlations were mathematically significant. As to rates of\n\f1951] .-.av '\n' Reviews 409\nflow, '\nthe water engineer did well in over-all estimate of rate of\nflow, but did not appropriately vary his estimates from point to\npoint within the terrain ; the geologist's estimates of rate of flow\nwere too low and likewise unrelated to the actual point-by-point\nvariations '.\nThere was some discussion with the dowsers about the '\narti-\nficiality '\nof the conditions, since it was clear that nobody was\nplanning a house or well on that site. But if a test of this kind is\nnot a valid test of dowsing then we may as well throw up the sponge\nand declare that the phenomenon, as claimed, is untestable. If\nthe conditions are accepted, and if the results of Dale et al. are\nconfirmed, we may, rather reluctantly, have to label dowsing as\na spurious phenomenon.\nMeanwhile, the report concludes :\n'\nBut two major issues\nremain open : (i) Does water divining ever occur by virtue of a\nparanormal process? and (2) Is the motion of the stick invariably\nthe result of the diviner's own muscular contractions? The\npresent writers do not wish to commit themselves, . . . believing\nthat far more research is needed before they can be answered.'\nD. P.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Statistical Evaluation of Group\nExperiments\nSir,\u2014Dr Schmeidler's interpretation of her interesting and\nimportant work reported in the November-December Journal\nseems to be marred by a statistical error. She appears to have\ntreated group experiments, in which several percipients guess at\nthe same target, by the same methods as she would treat individual\nexperiments, in which every percipient has his own run of targets.\nThe mistake is important and it has occurred before. What\nDr Schmeidler has overlooked is that the statistics of card-guessing\nmust be based on the question : given the guesses, how likely is\nit that the targets would have corresponded with them at least as\nclosely as they do? and not, given the targets, how likely is it that\nthe guesses, etc.? This is because we know the targets to be\nrandom, but we do not know about the randomness of the guesses.\nIt happens that if there is only one percipient per target the statis-\ntics are the same whichever question we ask, and that is perhaps\nwhy this point has often been overlooked. But where several\npercipients guess at the same target it can make a great deal of\ndifference.\n\f4IO Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nA more succinct but less instructive way of putting essentially\nthe same criticism is that we cannot evaluate the results of several\nsubjects independently since their results are not in fact indepen-\ndent ; but this does not bring out the essential point that, since\nthe statistics must treat the targets as variable and the guesses as\ngiven, we cannot expect to get more significant results by using\nmore percipients to guess at the same targets. From this fact it is\nclear that the only advantage to be expected of group experiments\nis that they should be more representative and perhaps more\nconsistent.\nHow can group experiments be evaluated? In theory by the\nuse of the elaborate multiple matching methods developed by\nGreville and others, but in practice more simply by the almost\nequivalent method of getting a group opinion\u2014e.g. a majority\nopinion\u2014on each guess. Thus, if the most popular guess for a\ngiven exposure of a target is Star, the '\ngroup-guess '\nmay be\ntaken as Star, and the group is then treated statistically as an\nindividual. The group opinion can be determined either at the\ntime of the guess or after the session. Both methods demand\nextra time and work, though much of this can be saved by a\nresourceful experimenter.\nWhat about Dr Schmeidler's experiments? I understand that\nthe 1943-45 series (sheep v. goats) was individual and the rest\n(sheep V. goats with Rorschach studies) group testing. The\nformer were therefore correctly evaluated, and since the results\nwere significant if seems reasonable to take at their face value at\nleast the sheep v. goats part of the group studies. To clinch the\nmatter all we need to know is : in how many runs the mean\nsheep-score exceeded the mean goat-score and in how many the\nmean goat-score exceeded the mean sheep-score ; and similarly\nfor good and poor adjustment, etc. It seems likely that the\nresults would still be significant. I wonder if Dr Schmeidler can\ngive them to us.\nI would like to express the hope, too, that in any future reports\nDr Schmeidler will state explicitly whether each result comes from\nindividual or group experiments, and give rather more complete\naccounts of the procedure used for statistical evaluation.\nChristopher Scott\nSir,\u2014Mr Scott's criticism is technically justified. In the\narticle to which he refers, probabilities were calculated from\n\/-scores both for the individually tested subjects and for the group\ntests in which all members of a class guessed at the same targets.\nAs he points out, this is not theoretically correct.\n\f1951] .' c \"\n. , Correspondence 411\nBut does it matter, in practice? I should like to raise two\npoints which indicate that it does not ; and that the method which\nwas used leads to the same conclusions as the correct but more\ntime-consuming one devised by Dr Greville.\nThe first is empirical. In several other series which were similar\nin procedure and in the nature of the target, both the Greville and\nother methods were applied, and no appreciable differences were\nfound. Dr Betty M. Humphrey states in relation to this :\nIn every case the CR of the difference obtained [by the Greville method]\ndiffered from that obtained by the binomial formula by only a few\nhundredths of a point. (For example, for Series Si, S2, and S3, CR's\nof the difference obtained by the binomial formula were 2-79, 2-8 1,\n2*29. By Dr Greville's method the comparable CR's of the difference\nwere 276, 275, 2-26.)\nBecause of the almost prohibitive amount of work involved in carrying\nout the extensive analyses according to the Greville method, and\nespecially because of the fact that no appreciable difference has ever\nbeen found in connection with any of the series of this report between\nthe results obtained by the Greville method and the simple binomial\nformula, it was deemed unnecessary to apply the Greville method to\nthe series of the present report where the CR's obtained were not of\nborderline significance. {J. Parapsychol., 1949, 13, p. 157, footnote.)\nIt will be remembered that the two probability figures quoted\nin my article were P= -000001 for the difference between mean\nESP scores for well-adjusted '\nsheep '\nand well-adjusted '\ngoats '\n;\nand P = -0003 for the difference between mean ESP scores of the\nsheep whose Rorschach protocols were free of seven '\nsigns '\nand\nof goats whose protocols were free of the same signs. Since\nneither of these figures would ordinarily be considered borderline,\nI followed Dr Humphrey's precedent in evaluating the data.\nEven allowing for some margin or error because of the statistical\nmethod used, we can, I think, take it that differences between\nthe groups were demonstrated by the research. If this is so,\nspending many hours on further evaluation would not contribute\nto our understanding.\nMy second point relates to theory. The reason for applying a\ncorrection to multiple calls on a target is the possibility that many\nmembers of a group have a preferred pattern of symbol choice,\nwhich (if it exists) may be similar to, or different from the symbol\npattern of the target list. This can, of course, affect the data when\nan experiment uses only one target list. In our case, however,\n27 groups guessed at 9 lists each, making 243 lists in all. It seems\nobvious that the importance of multiple calling is minimized\nwhen so many sets of multiple calls are used.\nIn this connection, Dr Greville has written to me, '\nExperience\n\f412 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nhas shown that similar stimulus preferences among the members\nof a group are an important factor only when (i) the number of\npossible stimuli from which the target is selected is very small,\nand (2) the number of calls in an experimental session is also very\nsmall.'\nNeither of these conditions was fulfilled in the research to which\nMr Scott refers ; thus his criticism would seem to be inappro-\npriate. .UijJ'\nThere is one comment of Mr Scott's which should not go\nunchallenged. In his third paragraph he writes, '\nWe cannot\nevaluate the results of several subjects independently since their\nresults are not in fact independent.' (The italics are mine.) Here\nhe assumes a point which he might find very hard to demonstrate.\nThe argument against using ^-scores for multiple calling of a\ntarget is based on the assumption that members of a group have\nsimilar stimulus preferences ; but this is only an assumption.\nExamination of the data shows that any such similarity is so small\nthat it is not perceptible to ordinary observation. This is also\ndemonstrated by the fact that Dr Humphrey found such small\ndifferences between CRs obtained by the Greville method and\nthe binomial formula.\nThe general problem is one to which many of us in psychical\nresearch are especially sensitized. Often, in every field but\nparticularly in ours, critics point out, correctly, possible loopholes\nin the procedure of some research. These criticisms are valuable\nfor later tightening of the procedure and proper evaluation of the\ndata. But if the critic assumes that what ynight have affected the\nresults did '\nin fact ' affect them, he will be making the same sort\nof error as the experimenter who assumed that what might have\naffected the results did not affect them at all. Sometimes, as a\nresult of such irresponsible criticism, worthwhile or provocative\nresearch is dismissed too readily as worthless. (This generaliza-\ntion is not intended to apply to the present case, nor to Mr Scott's\ncourteous letter.)\nGertrude Schmeidler\n'Retroactive PK' and the\nClassification of Phenomena\nSir,\u2014I should like to make two comments on the interesting\nletter from Miss Pamela Clark which appeared in the Journal\n(January-February 1951) and in which she referred to my paper\nin Part 178 of Proceedings.\nWhen Miss Clark says that I recognize '\ntwo main groups of\n\f195 1] sw.;(.''\u00bbVi Correspondence 413\nphenomena, one cognitive and the other conative ', she attributes\nto me a view which I have never wished to defend. Miss Clark\nmentions my criticism of the term '\nprecognition '\non the grounds\nthat it begs (or seems to beg) the question whether the facts in\nquestion are attributable to cognitive acts. The term '\nextra-\nsensory perception '\nis, of course, open to the same objection.\nI agree with Miss Clark's statement that '\nthere may be something\nunsatisfactory for psychical research in adopting without question\nour everyday categories of cognition and conation '. Indeed, I\nintended to underline this point when I argued (on p. 72 of my\npaper) that we are not entitled to regard the introspectible dif-\nference between '\nguessing '\nand '\nwilling ', as they appear to the\nsubject, as a reliable criterion for classifying psi-phenomena.\nMy second point concerns Miss Clark's suggestion that we\nshould define phenomena '\nas far as possible in positivist terms '.\nIt may be worth mentioning that this policy, if rigorously applied,\nwould, I think, render it meaningless to distinguish '\nretroactive\nPK '\nfrom '\nretrocognitive clairvoyance '. The distinction be-\ntween these concepts surely hinges on our interpreting causal\nconnection between a pair of events, A and B, as a relation which\nholds in a certain direction (as an asymmetrical relation), so that\nthere is a difference in meaning between saying '\nA causes B '\nand '\nB causes A '. The direction of causal influence between two\nevents is not, however, something which can be observed by the\nsenses ; hence a positivist should deny that this is a legitimate or\nuseful feature of our concept of causation. The common-sense\nbelief that causes must precede their effects would be attributed by\nmost positivists to an arbitrary linguistic convention concerning\nour use of the word '\ncause '. (That this is not the whole story is\nillustrated in the discussion by Professors C. D. Broad and\nH. H. Price of The Philosophical Implications of Foreknowledge'\nin Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume\nXVI.)\nIt does appear tempting, in view of the temporal displacement\neffects found in psi-phenomena, to abandon the conception of\ncausation as an asymmetrical relation. The main attraction of this\ncourse is that it seems to dispose of the great theoretical difficulties\ninvolved in supposing that events may be directly influenced\nby events which have not yet happened\u2014difficulties which would\napply equally to cases of '\nretroactive PK '\nand cases of '\nprecog-\nnition ', and which seem to be due primarily to our taking causal\nconnection to be an asymmetrical relation. If this course were\nadopted, it would require some radical changes in the classification\nof psi-phenomena. It would, for example, imply (as I argued on\np. 63 of my paper) that PK and precognition are not independent\n\f414 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nconcepts.

Awards for Research\nThe Society during the past year continued to make good progress\nnotwithstanding the difficulties that affected it in common with many\nother Societies, namely, the general rise in costs and the decreasing\nleisure which members are able to give to the Society's work. In these\ncircumstances the Council have thought that research could best be\npromoted by offering monetary awards for original investigations which\nthe Council regarded as reaching a sufficiently high standard. It was\ntheir hope that in this way younger v>'orkers might be attracted to\nspecified pieces of research in any branch of our subject, whether in\nthe form of quantitative experiment or otherwise. They decided that\nsuch awards should be open to all investigators, whether members of\nthe Society or not, and irrespective of nationality. If persons intending\nto carry out research or experiments will get in touch with the Society\nbefore beginning their investigations, they v,'ill be encouraged to inquire\ninto problems which have hitherto received insufficient attention, and\nwill obtain information as to the methods which appear particularly\npromising.\nThe first award was made to P. H. Marsh, of Gainsborough, for\nexperimental work carried out by him in connexion with extrasensory\nperception. A note on this work will be printed in the Joiirjial.\nA piece of major research being carried out with the approval of the\nCouncil is a critical analysis of PK data by J. Fraser Nicol, which is\nlikely to occupy him for a considerable time.\n2. Professor J. B. Rhine's Visit\nAn important event of the year was the visit to this country of\nProfessor J. B. Rhine, Director of the Parapsychology Laboratory- at\n\fii Supplement to Journal, March-April ig^i\nDuke University, who had been invited to deliver the Tenth Myers\nMemorial Lecture. He gave the lecture, which was entitled '\nTele-\npathy and Human Personahty ', on lo May 1950 at the Caxton Hall\nat a better-attended meeting than any organized by the Society for\nseveral years. Many of our members also had the advantage of meeting\nhim and Mrs Rhine at a Reception and discussing some problems of\npsychical research with them. Professor Rhine also addressed well-\nattended meetings at several University towns in this country and\nabroad, and undoubtedly gave a great impetus to public interest in our\nsubject. His lecture was published on 25 January 195 1 and has been\ncirculated to members.\n3. Other Visits\nIn June Professor Gardner Murphy passed through London on his\nway from America to India, where he was conducting an investigation\nunder the auspices of Unesco, and several of our members much\nenjoyed the opportunity of meeting him again.\nAs mentioned in the last Annual Report, Dr Betty Humphrey, a\nmember of Professor Rhine's staff at Duke University, accepted an\ninvitation to visit London and to conduct research work here, the\nSociety contributing to the expense of her visit. The pleasure that her\nvisit gave was increased by the fact that she was accompanied by Miss\nElizabeth McMahan, another member of Professor Rhine's staff.\nThey stayed at 31 Tavistock Square for about two months from the\nmiddle of August to the middle of October. Of their visit the Hon.\nResearch Officer writes :\nI know that I am expressing the feelings of each one of the small\nnumber of British experimenters in parapsychology in recording how\nmuch we appreciated the help and encouragement given by these\nworkers from Duke. It was of the utmost value to us to be able to\ndiscuss problems with two people who spend their whole working\nlife experimenting. Their unfailing enthusiasm and willingness,\neven after a long day's work at their own experiments, to continue\ntalks late into the night, was an example to us all. The tie of common\naims and interests that has been growing between Duke and the\nBritish workers was greatly strengthened by this visit.\nIn addition to addressing a meeting of the Society (12 September),\nDr Humphrey was able to visit and lecture at both Oxford and\nCambridge. The chief piece of experimental research carried out in\nLondon was a follow-up of the work of Professor Urban of Inns-\nbruck. Using patients in a mental hospital as his subjects, Professor\nUrban reported striking improvement in their performance in ESP\ntests after they had been given electro-convulsive therapy and other\nforms of physical treatment. Dr Humphrey concentrated on testing\npatients before and after electro-convulsive therapy. In addition to\nthis work, Dr Humphrey conducted a series of ESP tests at 31\nTavistock Square in which interested members were able to take\npart as subjects.\n\fSupplement to Journal, March-April igji iii\nThe data from both these series required a considerable amount of\nstatistical analysis, which Dr Humphrey undertook to carry out after\nher return to the United States. We look forward with interest to\nreceiving her report when the statistical work has been completed.\nDr S. G. Soal has been awarded a travel grant for the purpose of\nvisiting Duke University by the I^nited States Educational Commission\nin the United Kingdom under the Fulbright Program. There he hopes\nto co-operate with Dr J. G. Pratt in a detailed examination of the\nnegative displacement effects noted by F. Bateman and himself in the\nStewart records. Dr Soal, who has received an official invitation\nunder the Woodward Foundation to lecture on parapsychology at Yale\nUniversity, hopes through the kindness of Professor Gardner Murphy\nto spend the first fortnight of his visit in New York and to make the\nacquaintance of the workers in parapsychology at the City College of\nNew York. He has also received an invitation to lecture at Pittsburg\nUniversity.\nDr and Mrs Soal will be away from England from 22 March to\n29 May.\n4. Research\nIn the early part of the year Dr West completed a series of experi-\nments in which fifty subjects were tested for ESP in individual sessions.\nBoth cards and drawings were used as targets. Dr Humphrey and Dr\nWest both rated the subjects' drawings according to the psychological\ncharacteristics of '\nexpansion '\nand '\ncompression '. The aim was to\nfind out if there were differences in the ESP performance of the two\ntypes of subjects. The results, which were reported in the Journal ior\nSeptember-October 1950, were inconclusive, but some interesting\npoints were brought out about the expansion-compression test.\nLater in the year Dr West re-examined the drawings obtained from\nthe subjects who took part in the '\nmass '\nESP experiment conducted\nby himself on 7 February 1947. (See S.P.R. Journal, May 1947.)\nMrs C. H. Gay rated all the subjects who sent in a drawing in accord-\nance with the expansion-compression test. An independent judge had\n'\nblind matched '\nthe subjects' drawings against two possible targets.\nThe results showed that there was no significant difference between\nthe matching assessment scores of the expansive and compressive\nsubjects, both being close to chance expectation.\nLater in the year further interesting results were obtained. In some\nESP tests with five subjects Dr West noticed a significant dispersion\nof scores, some of the subjects scoring above chance, others below.\nThe same effect was found in some data collected by J. Eraser Nicol\nand Edward Osborn in experiments conducted in 1948-9. The results\nwere given in detail in the report in the Journal for January-February\n^951-\nThe large series of home-testing ESP experiments organized by\nG. W. Fisk yielded some interesting displacement scores. (See the\npreliminary report in the Journal for January-February 195 1.) Mr\n\fiv Supplement to Journal, March-April ig^i\nFisk and Dr West have since carried out further tests under improved\nconditions.\nMrs K. M. Goldney and Dr E. J. Dingwall are engaged on a detailed\ninvestigation of the reported haunting of Borley Rectory, and have\nbeen allowed to inspect many records and correspondence regarding it\nleft by the late Harry Price. A great deal of preliminary work has been\ndone, and several witnesses have been interviewed personally. It is,\nhowever, expected that the investigation will require considerable time\nto complete, as there is a very large mass of material to be examined.\nIt is hoped that a report of this inquiry will be published in due course.\nMrs Gay has for some time past been supervising an experiment in\ncross-correspondences in which several automatists who are members\nof the Society have taken part. In the course of her investigation she\nhas carried out an experiment designed to ascertain whether the\nconnexions between a large number of scripts which have come under\nher scrutiny are to be considered fortuitous or call for some other\nexplanation. This is a work of considerable intricacy, in which an\nattempt to produce an early report might spoil the result.\nMrs Goldney has taken part in the conduct of a series of proxy\nsittings at which interesting results have been obtained. Further lines\nof investigation are under discussion.\nDenys Parsons, one of the Hon. Secretaries, followed up a report\nof a telepathy act recounted in the New Statesman of 27 August\n1949. The writer referred to two airmen he had known during the\nwar who performed a thought-reading act which he was convinced was\ngenuine. It took until April 1950 to track down one of the airmen, who\nat once admitted that the act was based on a code. This denouement\nwas reported in the New Statesman of 9 December 1950.\nMr Parsons also initiated other investigations which originated in\nPress reports. In the Evening Standard of 27 June 1950, for example,\nappeared the headlines '\nDog is \" Thought-reader \" : Mongrel does 3-\ncard trick\u2014and knows about money '. The cutting described the\nreporter's visit to Mr Percy Harvey of Norwich, owner of a bitch named\n'\nSally '\nwho could indicate with her paw which card had been chosen\nby a member of the audience, could tell a two-shilling piece from a\npenny when both coins were held in closed fists, and so on. The case\nwas kindly followed up by a member, Dr O. C. de C. Ellis, assisted\nby a friend, Peter G. Bailey, who is a member of the Magic Circle.\nBoth wrote admirable reports. Unfortunately, there was no feature in\nthe case of interest to the psychical researcher and very little of interest\nto the magician.\nAs a result of a short letter from Mr Parsons which appeared in the\nLeader, a letter was received from the father of a Norfolk boy who\nclaims to perform psychic diagnosis and healing. This case was ably\nfollowed up by R. W. K. Hill, a member of the Society who lives in\nNorfolk, but his report showed that the case rested on slender\nfoundations.\nThe Council are also indebted to Miss Irene Herzberg and Mrs\nKenneth Richmond for the trouble they have taken in the investigation\n\fSupplement to Journal, March-April ig^i v\nof a case of '\ninspired drawing ', and to L. R. A. Baker for investigating\nan interesting poltergeist case at the home of another member, Dr\nHilda de Peyer.\nA large number of cases of various kinds of apparently supernormal\nactivity are constantly being reported to the Society. All are followed\nup as far as practicable, but notwithstanding the great amount of labour\nso entailed it is only rarely that a case can be brought to a point justi-\nfying a published report. The Council wish to thank all members of\nthe Society who have been so good as to report cases, and to assure\nthem that their action is much appreciated by the Officers of the\nSociety. Even when no report can be printed, insight may be gained\ninto some of the obscure problems involved.\n5. Film on Psychical Research\nIn November the Society was invited to co-operate in the making of\na film on psychical research. The inquiry came from Rayant Pictures\nLtd., a company associated with Twentieth Century Fox Ltd., and the\nfilm is intended to form one of the '\nSpotlight ' Series of twenty-\nminute films to be shown in public cinemas.\nTwo members of the Council, Denys Parsons (whose professional\nwork is the production of scientific films), and Edv\/ard Osborn (Hon.\nEditor of the 'i.V.K. Journal), were appointed to assist in the preparation\nof the script and to arrange facilities for some of the shooting. There\nwas some difficulty in reconciling the film company's desire for dramatic\npresentation with the need to give a strictly accurate picture of psychical\nresearch as carried out in practice. After several conferences and\nrevisions a script satisfactory to both parties was prepared, though it\nproved impossible to incorporate in the space allotted all the '\nsafe-\nguards '\nand qualifications in the dialogue and commentary which the\nS.P.R. representatives would have wished.\nThe film should be released in April or May 195 1.\n6. Finance\nThe Society's accounts for 1949 showed an excess of expenditure\nover income of some \u00a3576 (excluding the Myers Memorial Fund, which\nis self-contained). As will be seen from the financial statement on\npp. vii and viii, the Society finished the year 1950 with an excess of\nincome over expenditure of some ^648 (again excluding the Myers\nMemorial Fund). While this more than counterbalances the deficit\nfor the previous year, a word of explanation is necessary.\nExpenditure in 1950 was reduced mainly as a result of {a) the transfer\nof the Research Officer from a full-time to an honorary basis, {b) the\ncessation of her pension on the death, in February 1950, of Miss Isabel\nNewton, and (c) the printing of only one Part of Proceedings. It must\nalso be borne in mind that the 1949 accounts included a non-recurring\nitem of \u00a326^ for the cost of producing Part III of the Combined Index\n\fvi Supplement to Journal, March-April ig^i\nto Proceedings and Journal (1913-46). Income during 1950 included\nthe gratifying total oi l^i^ from the voluntary increases which many\nmembers have most generously made in their subscriptions, and an\nincrease of some \u00a371 in the sale of publications as compared with the\nprevious year. While the greatest economy will be exercised, rising\ncosts must be expected to affect almost every item of the Society's\nexpenditure. The Council desire to see an increase in the volume of\nresearch initiated by the Society, but such an increase must be in\nproportion to funds available after the budget has been balanced.\nNon-recurring items of income, such as legacies and donations, are\nnot included in the figure of ^648 mentioned above. These reached\nthe excellent total of ^307 during the year. The Council have felt it\nadvisable that such items should be kept separate from the Society's\nordinary revenue, and should form a fund which may be drawn upon\nfor specific pieces of research distinct from such investigations as are\ncarried out in the routine work of the Society.\n7. The Presidency\nDr S. G. Soal was elected President of the Society for the year.\nHis Presidential Address, which was delivered at Manson House, Port-\nland Place, W. I, on 3 November 1950, will shortly be published in\nProceedings.\n8. Membership of the Council\nIn March, to the great regret of her colleagues, Miss Theodora\nBosanquet announced that for reasons of health she felt compelled to\nresign her position as a member of Council, and Professor F. J. M.\nStratton, D.S.O., F.R.S., previously a co-opted member, was appointed\nan elected member of Council to fill the vacancy so caused.\nIn October the Hon. Mrs C. H. Gay was co-opted a member of\nCouncil.\n9. Journal\nOne of the objects which the Council had in view when lifting the\nrestriction on circulation in September 1949 was to make the work of\nthe Society available to a wider audience. This hope is beginning to be\nrealized. As a result of careful circularization, and with the co-opera-\ntion of the F. W. Faxon Company, the Society's agents in the United\nStates, nearly 200 non-members, half of whom are American, are now\nregularly receiving the Journal on a subscription basis. The Journal\nIS also helping to attract new members, and some subscribers have\nalready transferred to membership of the Society.\n\fo ooo 00\nir,\noo\n<\no\no\ntec ZS\n^ a o\nmT) (J\nPa; ^\n^ Q 2\nc\u00ab c ^\noh Oj\n0; g OJ O\na; O o u\nc c c ^\n: : =\nSi\no oooo\niri 00 ^ O\nCO rl- (^1\nS2\nI\n53-2\nS S\nD. a\n1\u00b0\n4>\no\na\nu\n<\nP5\nH\nM\nen\n<\na\nOS\nbi\nZ\nz\n.J\nC o 1\no o u\n- ^ a\nw\nc u\n\u00a3 \u00a3 c\n01 O rt\n4L u \u2014\nO IT)\n*\nc\nw\nJ3\ns s ^-\nc a C\nOci,a\nG\nZ\nH\nz\no\nQ\nZ\nU\n\u00ab\nW\ncn\nM\n\u00ab\n\u00abi o\n\u00ab O c o\n\" a - x\n^ o c s\n- 8 2-1\n>, . . .\ncq - - -\n^ ^ o o\nO ^ m r^j\n-^ ^ ^\nSi\n(NOO oo 00\nOOO ooo OOO\nvO O in m O 00\nIT)\nS2\n2 feet\"!

The Library\nDuring the year 93 books have been added to the Library, of which\n14 were presented by the authors or given by members of the Society.\nThe number of books borrowed by Members and Associates during\nthe year was 669. Eighty-one books were borrowed by the National\nCentral Library.\nThe Council have presented Volumes 38 to 48 of Proceedings to the\nInstitut fur Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene, Freiburg,\nGermany, to bring its collection up to date. The Principal, Dr Hans\nBender, has expressed his grateful thanks for the gift.\nII. Obituary\nOn 18 February the Society suffered a severe loss through the death\nof Miss Isabel Newton, an Hon. Member of the Society. Miss New-\nton's services, first as Assistant Secretary, then as Secretary, and later\nas a member of Council, extended over a period of forty years, and\nwere distinguished in the highest degree by loyalty, efficiency' and\nsympathy for all with whom she came in contact. A tribute to her\nmemory has been printed in Part 178 of Proceedings.\nAmong other losses by death may be m^entioned those of Miss May\nWalker, who took an active part in many investigations of physical\nphenomena and who left the Society a legacy by her Will ; Mrs\nLloyd Tuckey, whose husband was a pioneer in the investigation of\nhypnotism and a member of the Council ; and Mr C. J. P. Cave, one\nof the oldest members of the Society.\n12. Membership of the Society\nDuring the year 81 new Members, 11 Student-Associates, and one\nCorresponding Member were elected. The total loss in membership\nfroni deaths, resignations, etc., was 64 Members and 7 Associates,\nleaving a net increase of 22 in the total membership which now,\nmcluding Hon. and Corresponding Members (14) and Hon.\nAssociates (13), stands at 1002.\n13. Publications\nOne Part of Proceedings, Part 178, was published during the year,\nand SIX numbers of the Journal and three Supplements were issued.\nIn May was published a pamphlet by W. H. Salter entitled Trance\nMedtumship : An Introductory Study of Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard,\nand in July the pamphlet Hints on Sittings with Mediums was revised\nand made available to the public.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to \u00a3231 15s. id.\nand to members of the Society ,^89 3s. iid. ; the sales (1949) in the\nUnited States to members and the general public were ^^15 os. 8d.\n\fSupplement to Journal, March-April igsi xiii\nThe total of \u00a3335 19s. 8d. is an increase of \u00a3~o 19s. lod. over the\nsales recorded in the last Annual Report.\n14. Date of Annual General Meeting\nAn alteration to Article 37 of the Society's Articles of Association\nwas made by a Special Resolution, unanimously passed at an Extra-\nordinary General Meeting held on 14 December, extending from 28\nFebruary to 30 April the date by which the Annual General Meetuig\nmust be held.

Smythies, c.i.e.\n(late Forest Adviser to the Government of Nepal)\nThe following is a full and detailed account of an extraordinary,\nand to me inexplicable, incident which I saw in Kathmandu on\nFriday, 8 August 1941, and on which I made notes at the time.\nThis account is based on those contemporary notes.\nBefore I describe the actual incident, some preliminary remarks\nare necessary. I was told that some Nepalis have to do periodic\npuja or sacrifice to their Bhagwan or spirit at their home village.\nIf they fail to do this at the right time, the Bhagwati comes,\nwherever they may be, and possesses them. They lose conscious-\nness, dance and shout and behave madly while under control.\nI had a young orderly called Krishna, aged about eighteen, who\nhad to do this puja, but when the time came, he did not go to his\nhome for the ceremony. Instead\u2014or in consequence\u2014he was\nsuddenly possessed at eight o'clock at night in our servants'\nquarters. I went out and heard him making weird noises and\nraving. At nine o'clock the seizure passed, and our other orderly,\nthe elder of the two, said he must be taken to his home (eight miles\naway) at once, or the Bhagwan would keep on seizing him all\nnight. My Muhammedan bearer, Azmat, went also to help him\nhome, and when all three came back next day, Azmat had a quite\nincredible story to tell of what he had seen and what had happened.\nAs I was not there personally, I shall not trouble my readers with\nan account of it, but I told Azmat that if ever again a Bhagwan\nvisited our compound he was to let me know at once. I should\nmention that Azmat, being a Muhammedan, had originally no\nknowledge or belief in Hindu Bhagwans.\nA month or two later we had a little dinner party, and after\ndinner about nine p.m. we were sitting in the dark in the drawing-\nroom admiring a film of big game shooting in Nepal kindly sent by\nH.H. the Maharaja, when Azmat came quietly into the room and\nwhispered in my ear, '\nBhagwan phir a gaya,' i.e. '\nBhagwan has\ncome again '. I did not want to disturb the party, so I slipped out\n415\n\f41 6 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may (\nquietly, and went to the back of the house where the servants' ;\nquarters were. These quarters were a building of brick and tiled A\nroof divided into five rooms in a row, each room about ten feet by I\nseven and eight feet high, with a small extension at the back for\n|\ncooking food, and a door three and a half by six feet high in front, !l\nand well lit with an unshaded electric light bulb. In one of these \\\nlittle bare rooms\u2014there was nothing in the room except a roll of\nbedding in one corner and a small box in another\u2014my elder |\norderly, aged about twenty-two and also called Krishna, was\nsquatting quite alone on the bare floor, dressed in a shirt and\nkhaki shorts with bare legs. His attitude was approximately as |\nshown in the accompanying illustration (Figure I),^ cross-legged |\nwith his hands clasped between his legs. His head and body were i\nshaking and quivering, his face appeared wet with sweat, and he\nj\nwas making the most extraordinary noises. He seemed to me I\nobviously unconscious of what he was doing or that a circle of |\nrather frightened servants\u2014and myself\u2014were looking at him\nthrough the open door at about eight or ten feet distance.\nThis went on for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour,\nwhen suddenly (with his legs still crossed and his hands clasped,\nsee Figure H) he rose about two feet in the air, and after about a j\nFigure I Figure II\n^ The illustrations were drawn to Mr Smythies's specifications by\nMrs Elizabeth Sulivan in December 1950.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f195 1 ] A Case of Levitation in Nepal 417\nsecond bumped down hard on the floor. This happened again\ntwice, exactly the same except that his hands and legs became\nseparated.\nOne of the servants whispered that the Bhagwan was very angry\nwith Krishna and was punishing him by bumping him on the floor\nin this way, which, I must admit, was just what it looked like.\nThe servants were becoming very frightened and worried, and I\nwas feeling very creepy myself at this inexplicable sight. Then\none of the Nepali servants produced a splinter of resinous wood,\nwhich he lit and placed the burning end in Krishna's mouth for a\nmoment. The seizure continued unaltered for a brief interval,\nand then suddenly it passed, and Krishna opened his eyes and\nrelaxed. He sat looking dazed but otherwise normal. Shortly\nafterwards I left and returned to our party, from which I had been\nabsent for less than half an hour.\nThat is a detailed description of what I saw, and noted down\nthe next morning. I cannot explain it.\nTo touch on one or two more points :\n(1) I am quite convinced there was no fake ; the whole thing\nwas unpremeditated and unexpected, with the orderly an unwill-\ning, or rather unconscious, medium of an extraordinary mani-\nfestation.\n(2) There was no possibility of any apparatus, such as a thin\nwire, having been rigged up to haul the man up and down.\nThere was an excellent light, and I was quite close, and could see\nthe whole of the small room. Nor could he have been pushed up\nfrom below, since he was sitting on a bare solid brick floor. When\nthe levitation took place, the seven or eight other spectators, who\nwere all my servants, were outside the room with me, and could\nnot have '\nassisted '\nin any way.\n(3) I was not in the least under the influence of alcohol (my\nlimit is one '\nchota peg '), and nor were the servants around me,\nwho saw what I saw.\n(4) It is, I think, an impossibility for anyone to jwnp from the\nposition shown in Figure I to that in Figure II. At any rate I\nhave tried it myself and cannot move an inch from the ground\n.\nThe Nepalis say that a Bhagwan regards the person he takes\ncharge of as his own property, and never leaves him until death.\nUsually he exerts a beneficial influence, but at times when angry\nor annoyed, he takes violent control as exemplified above.\nEditor's Comments\nThe incident described above was first brought to my notice\nby Dr J. R. Smythies, a member of the Society. I am greatly\n\f41 8 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nindebted to his father, Mr E. A. Smythies, for agreeing to write\nj\nan account of it.\nThe word '\nlevitation '\nis usually applied to a phenomenon in\nwhich the subject (or object) is alleged to remain suspended in the\nair for an appreciable length of time. In this sense, the incident\ndescribed by Mr Smythies should not, strictly speaking, be termed\na levitation. It should, therefore, be understood that in the dis- '\ncussion which follows the word is used for want of a more precise\nand convenient term.\nCases of alleged levitation among non-western peoples are\nusually reported by hearsay, less usually at second-hand. When\nthere are first-hand accounts, which is rarely, more often than\nnot they concern set performances given by a '\nmagician ' or j\nholy man, often with a subject or '\npupil ', and are witnessed at a\ndistance laid down by the demonstrator. The only two cases\nwhich I have been able to find in the Society's literature {Journal,\n29, 275-7) exhibit some or all of these features. In both of them\nthe word '\nlevitation '\nis used in its accepted sense, the duration of\nlevitation in one case being given by Lord Halifax as '\nhalf-a-\nminute or so '.\nThe account written by Mr Smythies is of interest for several\nreasons : (i) it is at first-hand ; (2) it derives from notes^ written\nat the time of the occurrence ; (3) the incident was apparently\nspontaneous\u2014that is, it does not appear to have been '\nstaged '\n;\n(4) the writer was able to observe it at a very short distance and in\ngood light ; (5) the subject was entirely alone in the room.\nMr Smythies has supplied the following further information at\nmy request : (i) the story told by A2mat (referred to in the second\nparagraph of the report) concerned the apparent possession of the\nyounger Krishna\u2014and, simultaneously, of an uncle of his\u2014but\ndid not involve levitation ; (2) Mr Smythies was not prepared for\nlevitation to take place\n\u2014' I was certainly not ', he writes, '\nexpect-\ning anything like levitation '\n; (3) the height of about two feet to\nwhich the elder Krishna was levitated '\nwas a sort of average, his\nfeet a few inches lower, his seat about three feet up. That is the\nimpression I have '\n; (4) Krishna did not immediately drop to the\nMr Smythies informs me, in reply to my inquiry, that these notes\nwere on some sheets of paper. He continues, '\nTwo or three years later,\nwhen my wife was writing her book Tiger Lady [not yet published.\n\u2014\nEd.],\nshe incorporated my notes into one of her chapters\n\u2014\"Life in Kath-\nmandu \". I have hunted through her sheaves of papers, and cannot find {\nnow my original notes, but, in case of any use, I enclose three pages of\nher original typescript. This was typed out years ago in Kathmandu (and\nis not just a recent addition).' The details of the levitation given in the\ntypescript correspond with those in Mr Smythies's account, but there is\nno mention of the number of servants present, the distance of the wit-\nnesses from the subject of the levitation, or the conditions of lighting.\n\f1951] A Case of Levitation in Nepal 419\nground after each levitation\n\u2014' I had the impression of one or two\nseconds pause at the top\u2014not more.' ; (5) all the servants who\nwitnessed the incident were aware that Mr Smythies understood\ntheir language ; (6) there were no windows in any of the servants'\nquarters. To my inquiry whether any of the servants said in so\nmany words that they saw Krishna raised off the ground, Mr\nSmythies replied as follows :\nI remember just after the levitation turning to my bearer (Azmat) who\nwas standing near me, and saying in the vernacular, '\nWhat is happening\nto him (Krishna) ', and he said (also in the vernacular), '\nThe Bhagwan\nis very angry with him and is bumping him on the floor.' This clearly\nsuggested that he saw what I saw, and I never thought further of asking\nhim, or the other servants, what he or they had seen. In fact it never\neven occurred to me that they could not have seen what I saw, and I\nhad no reason (then) for trying to get corroborative evidence or further\nwitness.\nMr Smythies does not know whether the elder Krishna or the\nother servants were prepared for levitation to occur. He has no\ninformation on the occurrence, or alleged occurrence, of the\nphenomenon in Nepal, but informs me that the Director General\nof Forests in Nepal at that time. Sir Kaiser Shumshere, to whom,\na few days later, he described what he had seen, said that he him-\nself had not seen or heard of such cases before, though he knew of\nBhagwans. Mr Smythies is unable to say whether the subject of\nthe levitation was in the ordinary course of events liable to\nepileptiform seizures, or whether the occurrence of epilepsy is\nmarked in Nepal.\nBy good fortune, and through the kindness of Mr P. V. Killick,\nwho is at present living in Kathmandu, and whose help I grate-\nfully acknowledge, it has been possible to trace Mr Smythies's\nformer bearer, Azmat. (In writing to Mr Killick I did not, of\ncourse, say what the incident was, explaining that it was '\nextremely\nimportant that if Azmat or any of his fellow-servants were now\nquestioned about the happening, nothing should be said which\nwould suggest a particular answer '. It should, perhaps, also be\nsaid that Mr Killick and Mr Smythies are not known to each other,\nand that my letter was sent to Mr Killick without Mr Smythies's\nknowledge.) It will be best first to reproduce the relevant passages\nin Mr Killick's letter from Kathmandu (dated 8 February 195 1).\nI have examined Azmat and enclose a statement of his account of the\nincident as he related it to me through the interpreter.\nThe interesting thing, to me, is that, although he recollected the\nevening in question quite clearly, he insisted at first that nothing un-\nusual had occurred. I then asked him if something had not occurred\nin which Krishna was the central figure whereupon he said '\nOh that\n'\nA2\n\f420 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nwith an expression that impHed his surprise and some amusement that\nanyone should be interested to hear about such an ordinary occurrence\nall these years later!\nHe and the interpreter say they have both witnessed many such\nincidents which they evidently accept as perfectly normal.\nThere are many stories of strange happenings among these simple\npeople and even among Gurkhas in British regiments\u2014as, for example,\nthe British officer who went to a Gurkha soldier's hut and was saluted\nsmartly by him outside only to enter immediately and see him on his\nbed undressed in an attitude of meditation. .\n,\nIn a postscript, Mr Killick writes :\n'\nAzmat's account was\nconfirmed by my old ayah who was also a witness.'\nThe report enclosed with Mr Killick's letter is as follows :\nREPORT OF INTERVIEW WITH AZMAT\nIn August 1 94 1, Azmat, the Indian bearer of Mr Smythies (then\nBritish Forestry Adviser to the Government of Nepal) went to the\nquarter of Krishna, Mr Smythies's orderly, and found him sitting cross-\nlegged with arms folded and shivering with bloodshot eyes. Krishna\nsaid he was not feeling well. Azmat called Mr Smythies and some other\nservants who lit a Dhup. A Dhup is a paper container about the size of\na cigarette containing incense and is lit and swallowed by someone\nsupposed to be possessed by an evil spirit.\nKrishna swallowed the Dhup and suddenly rose about three feet in\nthe air remaining in the same posture with closed eyes and groaning.\nHe rose and descended rapidly about three or four times in quick\nsuccession shaking violently.\nMr Smythies's gardener, who was present, is a Jharphuke (a man who\nspecialises in locating and driving away evil spirits) and he then uttered\nin Nepali a Mantra (a charm) and placed a Tika (a small red circle\nusually of rice or paper symbolising rice) upon Krishna's forehead\npromising the evil spirit that Krishna would perform a Pooja (an\noffering to the gods) the next day. Krishna then slept.\nThe following day Krishna sacrificed a sheep at a temple and drank\nof its blood and the evil spirit was thereby placated and driven out of\nhis body.\nThe reason for his being possessed by the evil spirit was said to be\nthat he had failed to offer the customary annual sacrifice to the gods\nwho were therefore displeased with him.\nBoth Azmat and the interpreter (an educated Newar) said that there\nwas nothing unusual about this incident. People were frequently\npossessed by evil spirits when they had done something displeasing to\nthe gods. Sometimes they rose up and down like Krishna. Sometimes\nthey talked a lot of rubbish. Sometimes they recalled past events in\nwhich they themselves had never taken part or heard about. A Jharp-\nhuke is an ordinary working man who, by study and practice under a\nteacher, acquires powers of divination and expulsion of spirits. They\nare commonly used, for example, to name thieves or to detect and expel\n\f195 1] ^ ^^^^ Levitation in Nepal 421\nevil spirits from a new house and apparently are not motivated by\nconsideration of monetary gain.\nBefore writing to Mr Killick\u2014which seemed to me to be a very\nlong shot\u2014I had obtained statements from Mrs Smythies and\nfrom Lt Col J. D. Ogilvy,i First Secretary in the British Legation\n(as it then was) in Kathmandu at the time, who were present at the\nshowing of the film on the evening of 8 August 1941. Although\nthese statements became less important as evidence after the\narrival of the report of the interview with Azmat, they are of\ninterest for the information which they give about Mr Smythies's\nreactions to his experience.\nSTATEMENT BY MRS SMYTHIES\n5 January 195\ni\nI remember very well how my husband described at our party on\n8th August 1 94 1 (the date is recorded in my diary) how he had seen our\norderly possessed by a '\nBhagwan ', and lifted up into the air by some\nimpossible means. He was quite excited about it, but although he was\nperfectly sober, I found his account difficult to believe.\n(Sgd) Olive Smythies\nSTATEMENT BY LT COL J. D. OGILVY\n12 January 195\n1\nYour letter of 9th January [195 1] re phenomenon reported by Mr E.\nA. Smythies on the evening of 8th August 1941 in Khatmandhu.\nI am afraid that my memory is rather hazy about the event. I do\nhowever remember being present at a film show of big game shooting in\nMr Smythies's house in Khatmandhu but do not remember any dates.\nMr Smythies was called out of the room and when he came back stated\nthat he had been summoned to deal with his orderly, who was behaving\nqueerly in his quarters. He went on to state that the other servants said\nthat a spirit had entered into the orderly and that he, Mr Smythies, saw\nthe orderly levitated above the ground without any apparent effort or\nsupport. After a time the spirit was supposed to have left the orderly\nwho came down to earth again.\nI saw the orderly at various times afterwards but did not know him\nwell\u2014he struck me as being rather anaemic.\nI did not see the phenomenon of levitation nor do I remember any\nfurther particulars.\n(Sgd) John D. Ogilvy\nnt may be regarded as relevant that Mr Smythies had lost touch with\nColonel Ogilvy, and that I had to trace his present whereabouts myself.\nI need hardly say that no mention of levitation was made in my letter to\nhim.\n\f422 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nDr E. J. Dingwall, to whom I am much indebted for the\ninterest which he has taken in this case, has drawn my attention to\na passage in E. T. Dalton's Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal\n(Calcutta, 1872). In discussing ceremonies occurring at the\nworship of Gansam^ among the Muasi (or Kiirs or Kiirkus), one\nof the tribes of the Central Provinces of India, Dalton quotes an\naccount which he obtained from Captain W. S. Samuells, then\nAssistant Commissioner, Chutia Nagpiir. It was apparently in\nwriting or by word of mouth, for Samuells does not seem to have\ncommitted it to print. The account, in which I have italicized those\npassages which show a particularly close resemblance to the descrip-\ntions given by Mr Smythies and Azmat, is as follows:\nThe Baiga [priest] is always the medium of communication, but he\nassembles the people to aid him in the invocation. Musical instruments\nare produced, dancing commences, and the invocation to the spirit is\nchanted until one or more of the performers manifest possession by wild\nrolling of the eyes and involuntary spasmodic action of the muscles.\nThe affection appears contagious, and old women and others who have\nnot been dancing become influenced by it in a manner that is horrible\nto contemplate. Captain Samuells, who frequently witnessed the\nincantation, is confident that no deception whatever is practised. As at\nrevivals where similar scenes are produced by professing Christians,\neach person seized or exalted loses for a time all self-control, and the\nbody, limbs, and neck are worked in the most exhaustive manner, till\nthe Baiga interposes and relieves the victim.\nThe affection, says Captain Samuells, comes on like a fit of ague,\nlasting sometimes for a quarter of an hour, the patient or possessed\nperson writhing and trembling with intense violence, especially at the\ncommencement of the paroxysm. Then he is seen to spring from the\nground into the air, and a succession of leaps follow, all executed as\nthough he were shot at [possibly a printer's error for '\nup '.\n\u2014\nEd.,\nS.P.R. Journal] by unseen agency. During this stage of the seizure he\nis supposed to be quite unconscious, and rolls into the fire, if there be\none, or under the feet of the dancers without sustaining injury from the\nheat or the pressure. This lasts for a few minutes only, and is followed\nby the spasmodic stage. With hands and knees on the ground and hair\nloosened, the body is convulsed, and the head shakes violently, whilst\nfrom the mouth issues a hissing or gurgling noise. The patient next\nevincing an inclination to stand on his legs, the bystanders assist him\nand place a stick in his hand, with the aid of which he hops about, the\nspasmodic action of the body still continuing and the head performing\nby jerks a violently fatiguing circular movement. This may go on for\nhours, though Captain Samuells says that no one in his senses could\n* The Gansdm of the Mudsf deserves a footnote. He was said to have\nbeen formerly a chief who was devoured by a tiger just after his marriage.\n'\nCut off at such a moment ', says Dalton, ' it was unreasonable to suppose\nthat his spirit would rest.' He owed his apotheosis to the feat of having,\none year after his death, visited his wife and got her with child.\n\f195 1] A Case of Levitation in Nepal 423\ncontinue such exertion for many minutes. When the Baiga is appealed\nto, to cast out the spirit, he must first ascertain whether it is Gansam\nhimself or one of his famihars that has possessed the victim. If it be the\ngreat Gansam, the Baiga implores him to desist, meanwhile gently\nanointing the victim with butter ; and if the treatment is successful,\nthe patient gradually and naturally subsides into a state of repose from\nwhich he rises into consciousness, and restored to his normal state,\nfeels no fatigue or other ill-effects from the attack, (pp. 232-3).\nThis is the only eye-witness account of phenomena at all similar to\nthose described by Mr Smythies which I have been able to trace,\neven with Dr Dingwall's help.\nIn discussing the evidence in this case, the first points to note\nare (i) that the possibility of trickery seems remote, (2) that since\nMr Smythies was not expecting levitation to occur, the hypo-\nthesis of suggestion is unlikely to cover his experience, even if\none were to discount Azmat's evidence, (3) that Azmat's testi-\nmony corresponds with Mr Smythies's account in all material\npoints as regards the levitation itself (which suggests that the\nincident must have made a strong impression on his mind at the\ntime).\nMr Smythies says of Krishna that '\nsuddenly (with his legs still\ncrossed and his hands clasped, see Figure II) he rose about two\nfeet in the air '\n; Azmat's statement says that he was '\nsitting cross-\nlegged with arms folded ', and that he '\nsuddenly rose about three\nfeet in the air remaining in the same posture '. As both observers\nuse the word '\nrose ', and as neither mentions any leap or spring,\nit appears that they both received the impression that no effort\nwas involved. If Krishna did indeed rise two feet (or even one\nfoot) clear of the ground by no effort of his own, then he did so by\nno known means.\nIt is, however, necessary to consider the possibility that, while\nappearing to the observers to rise without effort, he did in fact\nleap upwards. It is mechanically impossible for a person sitting\nwith legs crossed and with hands in lap or arms folded to spring\nmore than an inch or two clear of the ground, and this can only\nbe done by swinging the body forward and then sharply backward\nin an unmistakable efTort. (If the feet are tucked under the\nthighs, the body can be thrust just clear of the ground ; if they\nare crossed in front of the seat, it cannot be done.) An experienced\nteacher of ballet very kindly made the attempt in my presence,\nwith the results described. A European practitioner of Yoga was\nno more successful. (It must be recorded that she was confident\nof being able to propel herself at least two feet up into the air after\na month or two of practice. As, however, she made several other\nclaims\u2014including the ability to make herself completely invisible\n\f424 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\n\u2014but was not prepared to give a practical demonstration of any\nof them, this confidence was not impressive.)\nIs it possible that Krishna, at the moment of rising into the air,\nwas not sitting cross-legged but that he sprang up from a squatting !\nposition and at the same time drew his legs up under him so that\nhe appeared to have risen with legs crossed? In this case he would |\nhave had to land in a squatting position after the first and second\n'\njumps (assuming that there were three in all) while after the third\nhe would presumably have landed with legs crossed. It has been\nsuggested that a very muscular person might be able to perform \\\nthis feat with practice, but I have not succeeded in finding anyone\nwilling to make the attempt.^ It would certainly be difficult to do ]\nwithout having the arms free to maintain the balance. We cannot .\ntell whether Krishna could have done it. He does not appear to I\nhave been of poor physique, for although he is described by\nColonel Ogilvy as '\nrather anaemic ', Mr Smythies, who presum-\nably knew him better, tells me that he was well built, muscular,\nand healthy, and puts his height at about 5 feet 8 inches and his\nweight at about io\\ stone. It seems unlikely that Mr Smythies,\nafter having watched Krishna sitting on the groundwith legs crossed\nfor ten minutes, could have failed to notice if he had worked himself\ninto a squatting position. Is it possible that he did notice it at the\ntime, but afterwards overlooked it? Against this one must set the\ntestimony of Mrs Smythies and Colonel Ogilvy. And would Mr j\nSmythies have described himself as '\nfeeling very creepy at this i\ninexplicable sight '\nif he had merely witnessed three leaps, how- \\\never phenomenal?\nMany of the details given by Captain Samuells are almost\nidentical with those in Mr Smythies's description, and it is\ninteresting to note that the duration of a quarter of an hour which\nhe gives for the preliminary '\nfit of ague '\ncorresponds so closely\nwith the '\nten minutes or a quarter of an hour '\nmentioned by Mr\nSmythies as the length of time that Krishna's head and body were\nshaking and quivering before he rose from the ground. Mr '\nSmythies's comments on Captain Samuells's account (of which he\nhad not previously heard) are as follows :\nThe '\nwild rolling of the eyes and involuntary spasmodic action of the\nmuscles '\nis very typical of what I saw in Kathmandu in Aug. 1941.\nAlso the '\nwrithing and trembling with intense violence ', the '\nspring\nfrom the ground into the air . . . executed as though he were shot up by\nunseen agency ', is a very good description, but it was hardly a spring.\n* I should be interested to hear from anyone\u2014ballet dancer, acrobat,\nor Yogi\u2014who felt confident of being able to demonstrate this. A member\nof the Council of the Society has kindly offered to make a cin6 film of any\ndemonstration which seems likely to throw any light on the question.\n\f195 1] A Case of Levitation in Nepal 425\nIt is a great pity that Captain Samuells, despite his insatiable\ncuriosity,^ did not describe the position of the possessed person\nat the moment of rising from the ground. Whatever it was, it is\nquite clear that he regarded him as propelhng himself upwards\nby his own efforts.\nAlthough it is a work which is based largely on hearsay, and\nshould be read with great caution, Mme Alexandra David-Neel's\nMystiques et Magiciens du Thibet (Paris, Plon, 1929) contains a\npassage which it may be interesting to quote. It describes the\ntraining of runners who are said to travel at great speed over long\ndistances in Tibet in their task of summoning demons to the\nceremony of propitiating Shinjed, the god of death. The passage\nis as follows :\nThe training consists of breathing and gymnastic exercises practised\nin complete darkness in a tshams khang in strict seclusion for three\nyears, three months, three weeks, and three days.\nAmong these exercises there is one which enjoys the favour of many\nself-styled mystics who are not of an especially intellectual type. Not\nonly members of religious orders but laymen also, both men and\nwomen, undertake prolonged '\nretreats '\nin order to devote themselves\nto it. It is as follows :\nThe student sits cross-legged on a large and thick cushion. He\ninhales slowly and for a long time [lentement et longuement], as if he\nwanted to inflate himself with air. Then, holding his breath, and with-\nout using his hands, he jumps up, still keeping his legs crossed, and falls\nback without changing his position. Some lamas succeed in jumping\nto a very great height in that way [sauter, ainsi, a une tres grande\nhauteur].\nAccording to Tibetans, those who apply themselves to this method of\ntraining for several years become capable of sitting on an ear of corn\nwithout bending the stalk, or of standing on the top of a heap of barley\nwithout displacing a single grain. In fact, the aim is levitation.^\nNo indication of the height of these jumps is given. Nor are we\nvery much wiser after reading, a few paragraphs later, Mme David-\nNeel's comment on a claim that after such training it is possible for\na person to jump vertically with legs crossed to twice his own\nheight. '\nI have heard Tibetans from Kham maintain', she writes,\n'\nthat they have witnessed feats of this kind in their country.\n^ At the end of his chapter on the Muasi, Dalton drily remarks that\n'\nCaptain Samuells was unable to induce a Muasi to die, in order that he\nmight, as an eye-witness, describe what then takes place '. (op. cit.\np. 234). It may, of course, have been Dalton who omitted to quote\nSamuells fully as to the posture of the possessed person.\n^ I have translated this from the French edition (pp. 208-9) as the\nEnglish edition (published in 193 1 under the title With Mystics and\nMagicians in Tibet) is not only not an exact rendering but contains\nremarks which do not appear in the original.\n\f426 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nHowever, those whom I have myself seen jumping have not seemed\nto me at all capable of such an exploit.' We are given no details\nof the personal experiences to which she refers.\nTo judge from the reported remarks of Azmat and the Newar,\nit would appear that the simple folk of Nepal regard levitation as\none of the possible consequences of failure to do puja. If, as Mr\nSmythies's account leads us to suppose, the phenomenon does\nindeed occur, it is perhaps not beyond the bounds of possibility\nthat its operation may be related to the unquestioning belief of the\nvictim in its reality.\nMr Smythies appears to have witnessed something which\nEuropeans are rarely privileged to see. One can only hope that\nthe publication of this report will lead to the collection of further\nevidence which may throw some light on this puzzling matter.\nE. O.\nVISUAL HALLUCINATION OF THE SELF\nBy J. C. Flugel\nIn a recent number of the British Medical Journal^ the distin-\nguished French neuro-psychiatrist Jean Lhermitte, who has been\non a visit to this country, contributes an interesting article on\n'\nautoscopy '\nor '\nvisual hallucination of the self ', in which he\npasses in review some of the numerous literary treatments of this\ntheme and shows that clinical evidence provides many close\nparallels to the descriptions by the gifted authors who have been\nfascinated by this subject. The record of real or supposedly real\ncases of seen '\ndoubles '\nbegins with Aristotle and continues in\nmodern times with reports from a number of psychiatrists of the\nhighest reputation. Goethe is among those who claim to have\nseen such a '\ndouble '\nof themselves (though '\nwhen I shook my\nhead at the sight of this delusion it disappeared '). For the most\npart, however, it seems to appear to those who are suffering from\nsome form of nervous or mental disease, such as epilepsy, general\nparalysis, encephalitis, post-traumatic disorders, or focal lesions of\nthe brain\u2014and to these mostly, though not invariably, when they\nare lost in thought or in states of drowsiness ; while in the case of\nepileptics the vision seems liable to occur about the time of their\nseizures. With regard to these latter, there is a tantalizingly brief\nstatement to the effect that the double has been seen not only by\nthe patient himself but ' by others present during the patient's fit '.\n* No. 4704, 3 March 1951.\n\f195 1] Visual Hallucination of the Self 427\nIf this is substantiated, we have presumably to deal with cases\nof collective hallucination ; otherwise we are faced only by a\nparticularly interesting and impressive form of individual hallu-\ncinatory delusion.\nThis, however, raises problems enough, of great interest alike to\nthe psychiatrist, the psychologist, and the student of psychical\nresearch. Attempted explanations of the phenomenon have been\nalong two main lines, neurological and psychological. It is the\nformer which Professor Lhermitte adumbrates in this article, his\nsuggestions being based chiefly on the work of Henry Head and\nGordon Holmes on the one hand and on that of Paul Schilder on\nthe other. The first-named authors drew attention to the sensori-\nmotor elements in the nervous system through which we become\naware of our postural attitudes and the relative position of the\nvarious parts of our body, while Schilder elaborated these and\nsimilar findings into a more general treatment of the '\nbody-\nscheme '\nor '\nbody-image '. This image can be distorted through\nvarious diseases of the nervous system, though the precise nature\nof the lesions or disturbances involved is still to some extent\nhypothetical. Other interesting modern accounts will be found in\narticles by G. Bychowski (' Disorders of the Body Image ',\nJ.\nNerv. Ment. Dis., 1943, 97, 313) and W. Clifford M. Scott (' Some\nEmbryological, Neurological, Psychiatric and Psycho-analytic\nImplications of the Body Scheme '\n(Int. J. Psycho-Anal., 1948, 29,\n141). The former, after describing various cases, quotes another\nauthority (Menninger-Lerchenthal) as regarding '\nautoscopia as a\nvisual kinesthetic hallucination of the body-image, which becomes\nsplit by the action of a mechanism linked with the vestibular\norgan, the brain stem, and the parieto-occipital cortex'. From\nfurther considerations it would appear that the vision may be\nrelated to the failure of a '\nbinding process '\nconnected with the\nparietal and thalamic regions, in the absence or disturbance of\nwhich process stimuli usually integrated with the body-image find\na sensory centrifugal discharge and are attributed to the outer\nworld.\nThe psychological explanation (to which Lhermitte does not\nhere refer, but which of course does not exclude the existence of a\nneurological basis or predisposition) involves the psycho-analytic\nmechanism of '\nprojection ', in which '\nrepressed mental processes,\nnot recognized as being of personal origin, are attributed to the\nexternal world and (often) experienced as an outer perception '.\nThe division into '\ninner '\nand '\nouter '\nunder these circumstances\nfrequently takes place along the lines of a crude separation be-\ntween '\ngood '\nand '\nbad '\nqualities. Most often it is the '\nbad '\naspects which are projected, as in paranoia, where the patient's own\nA3\n\f428 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nunrecognized aggressive or sexual impulses may be attributed to\nothers. This would fit in well with a case described by Lhermitte\nhimself, in which the '\nastral body '\nof a girl (who is described as\n'\ngood and pious ') was felt by her to be '\nin the grip of Satan ', who\nwould torture it and inflict upon it sexual outrages. (This\npatient had, it may be noted, suffered from epidemic encephalitis\na few years before these phenomena appeared). Sometimes,\nhowever, it may be the '\ngood '\npart, the super-ego, which is\nprojected\u2014a process which is represented in certain current\nadvertisements in which a shadovv^y admonitory self appears,\nand which occurs in Poe's tale of William Wilson.\nA more complete understanding of autoscopy would probably\ninvolve a knowledge of its relations to certain other phenomena\nwith which it may well have some important elements in common.\nWithin the sphere of psychical research are the materializations\nproduced by certain mediums, in so far as genuine phenomena of\nthis kind may occur (though these differ from autoscopy in that\nthey are seldom, if ever, '\ndoubles '\nof an actual sitter). More\ndefinitely germane to autoscopy are the appearances (visual or\nkinesthetic) of parts of a patient's body (as distinct from an\napparently complete personality) \u2014as in the feeling of '\nphantom\nlimbs '\nafter amputation, or of supernumerary members (a case\nof a kinesthetically present third arm was, I understand, recently\nreported by a well-known neurologist), or of the patient mentioned\nby Bychowski '\nwho discovered parts of her body in the environ-\nment '. These merge into the numerous cases of general lack of\nappreciation of the spatial relations between various parts of the\nbody or of their relative size or shape, of general disturbances in\nthe judgment of spatial relations (' metamorphopsia '\nwhen this is\nvisual), or of seeing objects double or multiple (' polyopia ') ;\nwhile in the last resort we find ourselves involved in the whole\nproblem of distinguishing the self from the outer world.\nApart from hallucinations, and in addition to paranoia to which\nwe have already alluded, we have such varied examples of pro-\njection as are involved in the '\nimaginary companions '\nof children,\nin the process of falling in love (in which some psychologists have\nrecognized as a significant factor the projection of the lover's\n'\ngood '\naspects or ego-ideal), and in religious and political enthus-\niasms (in which there is often a '\nsplitting '\nalong the lines of\n'\ngood '\nand '\nbad ', the good elements being ascribed to a divine\nbeing or human leader, the bad to a devil or to political, racial or\nnational '\nenemies '). Processes in some respects the opposite of\nthese (inasmuch as they imply a reduction rather than an extension\nof the self or body-image) are to be found in the various kinds of\ndepersonalization or of loss of the sense of unity with certain parts\n\f195 1 ] Reviews 429\nof the body (' my hand doesn't belong to me ') even when sensa-\ntion in the parts concerned seems to be intact. Allied to these in\nsome ways, though with the significant difference that they are\ndemonstrable in '\nnormal '\nindividuals, are the interesting results\nobtained in such experiments as those described by Werner Wolff\nin his Expression of Personality (1943). Here the subjects were\nshown photographs of their own hands, profiles, mirror writing,\netc., along with three examples of each kind obtained from others.\nThey could not as a rule pick out their own photographs, but,\nwhen asked to comment on the whole series, almost invariably\ndisplayed greater interest and affect (manifested both in approval\nand in disapproval or distrust) in their own samples than in those\nof others. They seem therefore to have had something like un-\nconscious or repressed recognition, in which feelings towards the\nself played an important part. Finally, there are the phenomena of\n'\ndissociated personality ', in which, too, the cleavage often seems\nto take place along developmental or quasi-moral lines (a secondary\npersonality being in quite a number of the recorded cases more\nchildish or irresponsible than the primary or '\nnormal '\none).\nA deeper study of the similarities and differences in the physio-\nlogical and psychological processes underlying these various types\nof phenomena would hardly fail to cast much further light upon\nthe strange and disturbing experience of autoscopy. It is not\nwithout good reason that so many authors have been intrigued by\nthe theme of the Doppelgdnger, for it raises neurological, psychia-\ntric, psychological, and philosophical issues which take us deep\ninto the very heart of the most intimate of all our problems : that\nof human personality.\nREVIEWS\n'\nThe Theoretical Implications of Telepathy '. By Margaret\nKnight. Article in Science News 18. Edited by J. L.\nCrammer. Harmondsworth, Penguin Books, 1950. is. 6d.\nThe account by Dingwall and Parsons of the Shackleton experi-\nments in card-guessing and the picture-guessing experiments of\nWhately Carington which appeared in Science News 9 has now\nbeen followed up, in Science News 18, by an interesting article by\nMargaret Knight on the theoretical implications of telepathy.\nThe author, who was at one time on the staff of the National\nInstitute of Industrial Psychology, is the wife of the Professor of\nPsychology in the University of Aberdeen.\n\f430 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nMrs Knight admits that recent experiments in ESP, such as\nthe Shackleton series, appear to be impervious to criticism and she\ndismisses the usual objections such as faint sensory ones, faulty\nstatistics, or unwarranted selection of data which have so often\nbeen urged by psychologists against the positive results obtained\nin this field. The most disturbing thing she says about the ^\nShackleton results is that they involve precognition with its\napparent implications that causation can work backwords in time.\nThis precognitive aspect of ESP has been thought by many\npsychical researchers to preclude the possibility of our ever finding j\nany physical explanation of telepathy. But Mrs Knight, like\nProfessor J. B. S. Haldane, is not convinced that this argument is a\nsound one. She thinks it no more incredible that future physical\nevents should influence a present physical event than that future\nmental events should be able to influence a mental event in the\npresent. The author admits, however, that there is no experi-\nmental evidence whatever that a human brain can pick up radia-\ntions emanating from another brain, and no reason to suppose\nthat even were this proved to be possible it would result in the\nowners of the two brains having similar mental experiences.\nMrs Knight is possibly right in saying that in the present state\nof our knowledge there is little justification for the oft-repeated\nassertion that '\ntelepathy is independent of space or distance '. I\nagree that a vast amount of systematic experiment with the same\nagent and percipient at varying distances is required before we can t,\nconclude that telepathic reception is unafi^ected by distance. It is\nalso true that a good many long-range tests have produced results\nwhich are only of borderline significance. I do not think, however, <\nthat the author is factually accurate in her statement that '\nthe\nlongest distance over which results of undoubted significance have\nbeen obtained is some 200 miles\u2014between London and Merksem\nin Belgium '\n(p. 14). Rhine himself has reported highly significant\nresults over longer distances in his first book Extrasensory\nPerception.\nWhile Mrs Knight thinks that no hypotheses put forward to\naccount for telepathy and precognition are entirely plausible, she\nconsiders that the late H. F. Saltmarsh's theory of the extension of\nthe '\nspecious present ' is the best we have so far achieved with\nregard to precognition. This theory would naturally appeal to a\npsychologist, but it seems to me that the theory succeeded by\nevading the formidable metaphysical difficulties of the problems.\nIt was, however, a brilliant efl:ort. There is no mention of Caring-\nton's '\nAssociation Theory '\nof telepathy, but the author appears\nto favour the view that at the subconscious level minds are not\nentirely separate entities. If it is true that electrical and chemical\n\f1951] Reviews 431\nchanges in the brain of A can produce conscious experiences not\nonly in the mind of A but also in the mind of B, then we are driven\nto the conclusion that the two minds are not entirely distinct.\nSince no psychologist has been able to explain how a physical\nevent or events in A's brain can give rise to a conscious experience\nin A's mind, then psychologists who swallow this miracle without\nany fuss ought to be prepared to accept the further miracle that\noccasionally physical activity in A's brain may give rise to a\nconscious experience in B's mind. And why not, if mental\nexperiences are not spatial events?\nThe author suggests that ESP does not mark a new stage in\nevolution but may be the vestige of a primitive faculty derived from\nthe lower animals and which is best observed in the behaviour of\nbirds and social insects. Whether we agree or not with the author's\nviews, they are expressed with scrupulous fairness and it is surely\nsignificant that a professional psychologist should endorse the\nopinion of another distinguished psychologist, Dr Thouless, that\nESP has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and that\nit is a waste of time to conduct experiments merely to demonstrate\nthe existence of the faculty. Our efforts should now be directed\ntowards an understanding of the conditions under which it occurs\nand the practical control of its functioning.\nS. G. SOAL\nSixty Years of Psychical Research : Houdini and I among the\nSpiritualists. By Joseph F. Rinn. New York, Truth Seeker\nCompany, 1950. xviii, 618 pp. S5.00.\nMr Rinn is a business man who, according to the Introduction\nto his book, '\nbegan his long public career [i.e. as investigator] in an\nearnest endeavour to discover scientific evidence of a future life.\nHe realised that once communication was established with the\ndead and we beheld the spirits of the departed, all doubts would be\ndispelled concerning a life after death . .\n.' It was not unnatural\nthat his endeavour to behold the spirits of the departed should\nhave led him into the shady bypaths of the psychic underworld, or\nthat there he should have met nothing but fraud. This, as was\nalso natural, if regrettable, produced a violent reaction against all\nforms of mediumship, and a bias against all psychic phenomena,\nmediumistic or not.\nTo quote the Introduction once more :\n'\nA member of the\nBritish Society for Psychical Research, Mr Rinn withdrew from\nthe organisation when he painfully realised that it was more\nconcerned in protecting and pampering mediums, and in covering\ntheir tracks, than in exposing them '. Mr Rinn's sole connection\nwith the S.P.R. was that he was an associate of the American\n\f432 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nBranch of it for about four years, from 1897, during the period when\nthe Society strictly adhered to its policy of refusing to investigate ,1\nmediums previously detected in deliberate trickery, a strange way\nof '\nprotecting and pampering '\nthem! This was not a very\nlong time in which to form a considered judgment on a subject\nas complex and obscure as we all know psychical research to be.\nBut then for Mr Rinn there are no complexities, nothing more than\nfraudulent mediums, a gullible public, and gullible or dishonest\ninvestigators. What need for psychological subtleties? Is not\nMr Rinn a trained conjurer, and cannot he at a pinch consult\nHoudini?\nHow magnificently that oracle disposed of hypnotism as '\na big\nfake '! Even Mr Rinn was inclined at first to jib at this sweeping\npronouncement, but all his doubts were dispelled when Houdini\nintroduced him to a man who claimed to have been a paid con-\nfederate of Charcot. Whether or not there is any truth in the\nstory to which this self-accused confederate confessed, I do not\nknow, but it would in any event have little bearing on the status\nof hypnotic research. Hypnotism, it is well to remember, was put\non a scientific basis as the result of the long labours of many\nscientists in different countries. For a time the French took the\nlead, and among the various French schools of the Salpetriere,\nNancy, etc. there was vigorous mutual criticism. Any taking of\nresults on a large scale by one school would quite certainly have\nbeen denounced by the others.\nBut Mr Rinn has a tenderness for the '\nconfessions '\nof self-\nconfessed scoundrels implicating alleged confederates who are not\nin a position to reply, as is shown by his keenness to swallow the\n'\nconfession '\nof Blackburn, who, however, was careless enough not\nto ascertain that the man against whom he '\nconfessed '\nwas not\ndead, as he supposed, but very much alive and kicking : see\nS.P.R. Journal, XV.\nMr Rinn is much too fond of charges of dishonesty against other\ninvestigators, which he scatters as freely as he does challenges of\nthousands of dollars to anyone who will produce genuine psychic\nphenomena, under conditions, of course, that he approves. The\nfailure to take up these challenges he regards as proof that no\ngenuine phenomena occur, but his own controversial manners\nhave to be taken into account, as in his attack on our former\nPresident, Walter Prince (pp. 469-70). It appears from the New\nYork American of 19 August 1924, which he quotes, that Prince\nand Houdini were debating the reality of psychic phenomena in a\nNew York church when '\nJoseph F. Rinn entered the discussion\nwith a direct attack on Dr Prince's sincerity '. The meeting broke\nup in disorder and as the crowd pressed to the doors Mr Rinn\nI\n\f195 1] Reviews 433\ndeclared, '\nThat man is a liar because he makes his living out of\nthat nonsense '.\nPrince was at that time risking his livelihood by the firm line he\nwas taking as a member of the Committee appointed by the\nScientific American in criticising '\nMargery '. Her supporters at\nthat time dominated the American S.P.R., and Prince lost his\nposition as Research Officer of that Society in consequence, as well\nas incurring much personal abuse. Houdini, Prince's colleague on\nthe Committee, testifies warmly to his integrity, and so would\nmany still living in America and this country who remember him\nwith honour and affection. But without compunction or apology\nMr Rinn twenty-six years later repeats the calumny.\nJust what are Mr Rinn's qualifications to pose as a judge of\npsychical researchers? What sort of investigations has he con-\nducted and with what subjects? The Introduction says, 'The\npageant of seance deceptionists passes before the eye in colourful\nsuccession ', and about two dozen names are given. If the list be\nanalysed, it would appear that in his unregenerate days, while he\nstill had an open mind, he had contacts with two of the Fox sisters\nand Slade ; that later he had a single sitting with Mrs Piper, and\nanother with Eusapia Palladino ; and that the rest of the list\nconsists either of mediums with whom he never sat or persons\nwhose importance in psychical research was not equal to their\nlocal and transient notoriety. I have not noticed in the book any\nmention of investigations by Mr Rinn of poltergeists, haunted\nhouses, apparitions, or other spontaneous phenomena, or any\nexperiments by him in telepathy or clairvoyance, apart from the\nexposure of sundry public performers.\nLet us consider whether in his two sittings with Mrs Piper and\nEusapia respectively he did anything to advance knowledge of\ntheir mediumships. In 1896 Mr Rinn visited a '\ntemple '\nin\nBoston where a medium, Concannon, and his wife produced\nmaterializations which he recognized as fraudulent. Shortly after\nhis visit some of his friends made a thorough exposure, grabbing a\n'\nspirit ' robe, wig, etc. and leaving a nearly'naked Concannon.\nAfter quoting a newspaper account of the incident, Mr Rinn\ncontinues :\nThis exposure should have shaken my belief that a genuine medium\nexisted, but the manifestations in Mr Ayer's temple [where the exposure\nhad taken place] continued to be regarded by Spiritualists as un-\ndoubtedly genuine, and the members of the Society for Psychical\nResearch did not lose faith. We had been fed with stories of the\nwonderful performances and psychic power of Mrs Leonora Piper,\nalthough a preliminary report had not yet been issued by Dr Richard\nHodgson, who had her in charge.\n\f434 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nThis short paragraph is replete with absurdities. Why should the\nexposure of Concannon, whose fraud was of a very gross kind, cast\ndoubt on mediumship in general? If the members of the S.P.R.\ndid not '\nlose faith '\nin Concannon, as Mr Rinn's sentence sug-\ngests, it was because the majority had never heard of him and had\nno faith in him to lose. Why bracket him with Mrs Piper, whose\nphenomena were of quite a different type? As for Dr Hodgson\nnot having produced a preliminary report on her, two long reports\non her had already been published in S.P.R. Proceedings, one\n(vol. VI, 436-659) by Myers, Lodge, Leaf, and James, and the\nother (vol. VIII 1-167) by Hodgson himself.\nThese reports had established several points concerning the\nPiper mediumship, such as {a) that it was difficult to take the\nControls, e.g. Phinuit, unreservedly at their face value ;\n{b) that\nsometimes they made incorrect statements and were unable to\nanswer questions correctly ;\n[c) that the medium, when in trance,\ncould and probably did pick up information from the sitters by\nmuscle-reading (see Proceedings VI ;\nLodge's remarks on p. 451,\nand Leaf's on p. 562),^ but also {d) that there was no ground for\nsupposing that in her normal state she obtained information as to\nthe sitters, their friends etc. and (e) that, when all allowances had\nbeen made for (a), {b) and (c), she had genuine psychic powers.\nWhen, therefore, in an interview with Hodgson after his sitting\nin 1896, Mr Rinn brought up muscle-reading, etc., etc., as a\nsufficient explanation of Mrs Piper's phenomena, it was not\nunnatural that Hodgson, with his much longer experience of\nmediumistic trickery, should have shown impatience. Mr Rinn\nsuggests that this was because Hodgson was '\nof the English\ngentleman type '\nand unduly touchy. Hodgson was in fact a very\nunconventional, plain-spoken Australian, well accustomed to the\nrough and tumble of controversy.\nAt the time of Mr Rinn's sitting the principal Control and one\nof the principal Communicators at the Piper sittings was George\nPellew, who had died in 1892 and is called in the printed records\n'\nGeorge Pelham '\nor '\nG.P.'. In 1921 Mr Rinn learnt to his\n'\namazement '\n(p. 175) '\nthat documentary evidence existed from\nthe family of \" G.P.\" that a fictitious story was built about the life\nof his former friend by Dr Hodgson to justify his change to the\nspiritistic hypothesis, and that most of the statements made about\n\" G.P.\" in Dr Hodgson's report [in S.P.R. Proceedings, XIII]\nwere absolute falsehoods '. (The italics are Mr Rinn's). On p. 180\nhe says, '\nDr Hodgson lied outrageously on many important points\nin relation to \" G.P.\" and his family.'\nThe only evidence Mr Rinn puts forward in support of these\n^ In the later stages of the mediumship this could not occur.\n\f1951] Reviews 435\nsweeping statements is a letter written in 191 8, more than twelve\nyears after Hogdson's death, by '\nG.P.'s ' brother, Professor\nPellew, to Clodd, the RationaHst author. It is a long letter, taking\nup nearly four pages of print. The first half of the letter is to the\neffect that the Pellew family refused to accept the '\nG.P.' com-\nmunications as coming from the real George Pellew, mainly\nbecause they did not reflect his intellectual standards. This was a\nmatter of opinion, and there is no suggestion of any false statement\nby Hodgson. The latter part of the letter does accuse him of\nhaving in one instance misrepresented the facts, not about ' G.P.',\nbut about a sitter, John Fiske's, opinion of his sitting. Professor\nPellew had been shown by his parents '\na curious letter from\nHodgson. It was somewhat to this effect '. The substance of\nthe letter, as so recollected, was that after a Piper sitting Fiske had\ntold Hodgson that he was absolutely convinced that he had been\ntalking to his old friend, George Pellew. A few weeks later\nProfessor Pellew, as he says in his letter to Clodd, met Fiske, who\nstigmatised Mrs Piper as '\nthat old fraud ', and denied that he had\never thought that through her he had conversed with George\nPellew.\nThe Fiske story is, of course, the loosest hearsay, depending on\nProfessor Pellew's admittedly vague recollection (' somewhat to\nthis effect ') of a letter he had seen at some unspecified previous\ndate and of his memory of a conversation, also of uncertain date^\nwith Fiske. It would not begin to be evidence without having the\nexact terms of Hodgson's letter, and a first-hand statement by\nFiske as to exactly what his comments on the letter were. He\nshould also state when the sitting in question occurred and what\nreport on it, if any, he gave to Hodgson at the time. This might\nenable some contemporary written record of the sitting and of\nannotations by Fiske to be traced, and these would of course be\nevidence worth attention.\nThe story given in the letter is not a plausible one. By the\ntestimony of all who worked with him in this country or America,\nwhether or not they agreed with his views, Hodgson was a man of\nhonour. But even if they had all been mistaken on this point, he\ncould not have risked misrepresenting things that happened at or\nin connexion with sittings which he was supervising. If any of\nthe Pellew family, or Fiske, or anyone else had during Hodgson's\nlife reported a single case of misrepresentation by him to any\nmember of the S.P.R. Council in England or to any of his Ameri-\ncan colleagues, and had been able to substantiate the charges, that\nwould have been the end of Hodgson's career in psychical research.\n*\nMrs Piper's Confession. Disclaims Contact with the Spirit\nWorld.' So runs the heading of one of Mr Rinn's chapters\n\f436 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\n(p. 195). By this time it will come as no surprise to the reader\nto learn that Mrs Piper never made a '\nConfession '\nat all. In the\nsummer of 1901 Mrs Piper gave an interview to a journalist, and\non 20 October of that year the New York Herald published a long\nstatement purporting to be made by her, and in fact based on the\ninterview. The statement contains the following passages :\n'\nI have always maintained that these [psychic] phenomena could\nbe explained in other ways than by the intervention of disem-\nbodied spirit forces. The theory of telepathy strongly appeals to\nme as the most plausible and genuine scientific solution of the\nproblem.' And later on, Mrs Piper says, or at any rate, the\njournalist reports her as saying :\n'\nI do not believe that spirits of\nthe dead have spoken through me when I have been in a trance\nstate.' On Mrs Piper's attention being drawn to the New York\nHerald article she promptly dictated a statement which appeared\nin the Boston Advertiser of 25 October 1901 : 'I did not make any\nsuch statement as that published in the Nezv York Herald to the\neffect that spirits of the departed do not control me. . . . Spirits\nof the departed may have controlled me and they may not. I\nconfess that I do not know.' This latter statement Mr Rinn does\nnot quote. But whether or not the New York Herald was justified\nin reporting Mrs Piper as saying she did not believe the spirits of\nthe dead had spoken through her, the use of the word '\nConfession\n'\nby Mr Rinn was quite unjustified. For many years prior to this\ninterview two views of the Piper communications had been dis-\ncussed by psychical researchers. One was that they came from\nspirits of the departed ; and the other was that Mrs Piper's sub-\nconscious mind received the substance of them by telepathy, the\nControls and Communicators who manifested in the trance being\nsubconscious dramatisations somewhat akin to secondary person-\nalities. The second hypothesis, which Mrs Piper according to the\ninterview preferred, no more implies dishonesty, as the word\n'\nConfession '\ndoes, than the first. It appears from the report on\nthe episodes in S.P.R. Journal X, pp. 142-3, 150-2, that the New\nYork Herald had by way of '\nadvertising smartness '\nmade an\nadvance announcement of her '\nConfession ', and that in response\nto a protest by her, the paper assured her that word would not\nappear in the actual article, as in fact it did not.\nEusapia was more up Mr Rinn's street than Mrs Piper, and one\nmight have hoped for some new light on her from Mr Rinn's\nsitting. This took place on 17 April 1910, and is described, to-\ngether with the preparations for it, on pp. 278-81 of the book. It\nhad at this time been long known and was generally accepted that\nEusapia would use whatever trickery the conditions of control\npermitted. The question was whether she could produce her\n\f1951] Reviews 437\nphenomena under conditions effectively excluding trickery. The\ngroup of highly competent investigators who sat with her at\nNaples in 1Q08 believed she could and did : see their report in\nS.P.R. Proceedings XXIII.\nIn 1909 she came to America and in 19 10 gave a series of\nsittings to a group connected with Columbia University. A\nmember of the group invited Mr Rinn and some friends of his,\nwho were experts in tricker\\', to attend a sitting. Before this\nsitting Mr Rinn and his friends arranged an elaborate plan to trap\nthe medium, some, but not all, of the members of the University\ngroup being privy to it. Part of the plan was that at a particular\npoint in the sitting and for a prearranged time Mr Rinn's friends,\nwho were acting as controllers of the medium, should deliberately\nrelease their control. This plan was put into action, and during\nthe prearranged relaxation of control Eusapia produced pheno-\nmena, which she could not do during the part of the sitting when\nthe control was strictly maintained. The result did no more than\nconfirm what had already been established as to her mediumship\nfifteen years earlier at the Cambridge sittings. The S.P.R. has\nalways maintained that it is possible to test a medium without\nlaying traps, and that complete candour between fellow-investi-\ngators is imperative. Departures, such as Mr Rinn's, from the\ncode of mutual confidence between investigators merely open the\ndoor to the bogus investigator, who is as much a hindrance to\nserious research as the bogus medium.\nIt would be tedious to correct all Mr Rinn's minor inaccuracies:\nhere are a few jotted down as I read the book. Barrett was not\n'\nhead of the British S.P.R.' at the time of his American visit in\n1885, or any^vhere near it (p. 15). J. H. Hyslop is made (p. 294)\nto speak in 1910 of '\nthe English branch of our association ', which\nhe would certainly not have done, as he had negotiated on the\nAmerican side the complete separation of the British and American\nSocieties in 1906. Ivor Tuckett was not at any time a '\nprominent\nmember '\nof the S.P.R. (p. 309) : in 191 1 he was not a member at\nall. It is correctly stated (p. 599) that in 1938 the ESP cards used\nby Professor Rhine were unsuited for experimental purposes : see\nS.P.R. Journal for May 1938. Professor Rhine was by that time\nquite aware of the defect, and was arranging for the use of a better\ntype of card in his later experiments: Mr Rinn does not mention\nthis. Nor does he, after mentioning (pp. 596-7) the negative\nresults of Dr Soal's earlier experiments as tending to disprove\nProfessor Rhine's claims, anywhere refer to the positive results\nthat Dr Soal and Mrs Goldney later obtained through Shackleton\n(S.P.R. Proceedings XLVII). It is not true, as suggested on pp.\n291-2 of Mr Rinn's book, that luminous paint is only used by\n\f438 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\n'\ncrooked mediums '. Until the development of infra-red tech-\nnique it was the standard method of indicating the situation of\npersons and objects at sittings held in poor light, and has often in\nthat way been used in our seance-room. Mis-spellings of names\nfamiliar in psychical research are common ;\n'\nPhenuit ',\n'\nMrs\nSedgwick ',\n' G. B. Door '\nRev. Charles Tweedle ', '\nValentine\nOn p. 444 the names of ten members of a Committee to investigate\nspirit photography are given : five are mis-spelt.\nA large part of the book is taken up with one-sided accounts of\nconversations in which Mr Rinn scores off the other fellow. One's\nconfidence in the accuracy of these accounts is shaken by Mr\nRinn's exaggerated bias, and the prevalence of blunders large and\nsmall destroys it entirely, beyond hope of restoration by the most\ncopious extracts from the American press, to which he freely\nresorts.\nThe pity is that Mr Rinn, whose knowledge and experience of\nmediumistic trickery would have qualified him to write an inter-\nesting book of value to psychical research, if he had confined him-\nself to matters that he understood and that had come under his\nown observation, has been so unwise as to go outside these limits.\nKnowledge of methods of deception is needed in psychical\nresearch, and the S.P.R. has always been fortunate enough to\ninclude members well versed in them. But such knowledge does\nnot by itself make a psychical researcher, without more accuracy,\na better idea of evidence, and a greater understanding of human\nnature, whether in its normal or abnormal states, than Mr Rinn\nshows in this book. To succeed in business he must have had a\nfair share of these qualities, but when it comes to psychical\nresearch they fail him. No doubt this is because for him the\nsubject has never been one of impartial enquiry. He began with a\ndesire to obtain evidence of a future life, proceeded to take the\nworst kind of route to that objective, found that it led nowhere,\nand went violently into reverse for the rest of his life with no better\nresults. Let the sad fate of Mr Rinn stir us all to examine our\nconsciences to see whether we are ourselves free, to quote our\nSociety's inaugural manifesto, *\nfrom prejudice or prepossession\nof any kind '\n!\nW. H. S.\nPsychotic Art. By Francis Reitman, m.d., d.p.m. London\nRoutledge & Kegan Paul, 1950. x, 180 pp. 17 plates. i6s.\nAlthough the artistic products of the mentally unbalanced have\nlong been known, little serious attention was given to them until\nthe nineteenth century when such students as Marce and Simon in\nFrance (1864 and 1876), Lombroso in Italy (1880), and Kiernan\n\f1951] Reviews 439\nin the United States (1892) began to view them, not only from the\nstandpoint of the art critic, but also from that of the practising\npsychotherapeutist. In later years, following the more detailed\nwork of Prinzhorn at the Heidleberg Psychiatric Clinic, came\nfurther work from men of such diverse views as Vinchon, Ass-\nchaffenburg, Pfeifer, and Schilder.\nIn the present work Dr Reitman, who has had the advantage of\nworking with Dr E. C. Dax at Netherne House, has attempted to\nexamine the problems inherent in psychotic and in particular\nschizophrenic art from the point of view of the neuro-psychiatrist,\nand to show what he calls the biologically determined dynamics of\nthe material at his disposal. He regards the art products of the\nschizophrenic patient as a kind of active and creative ritual. Due\npartly to the distorted view of his own and other body-images\n(body-schemata) and partly to his disordered concept of space-\nrelations, the artist paints in order to adjust himself to his own\nchanged view of reality. His productions are thus in a sense\npictorial representations of his own disturbed thinking, and can\ntherefore be evaluated in psycho-physiological terms. It is, Dr\nReitman insists, a mistake to appraise them solely from the\npsychological standpoint, since they contain both motor and\nsensory phenomena, and must therefore be approached from a\nbiological as well as from a psychological angle. It is here that\nthe author parts company from some of his predecessors, notably\nPrinzhorn, and from those who, from their psycho-analytic\ntraining, tend to find in every schizophrenic painting those signs\nand symbols which form the basis of much of their psychological\ninterpretation in other fields.\nFrom what Dr Reitman has written it is clear that he regards\nschizophrenic art as primarily dependent on the patient's own\nabnormal cognitive condition. From his changed mental position\nboth as regards himself and the external world the schizophrenic\nis, in one sense at least, maintaining his own existence and adjust-\ning himself to a new situation. Thus any analysis of such paint-\nings must give due allowance to a psychological approach, what-\never stress be laid on the purely neuro-psychiatric interpretation.\nIt is here that the psychical researcher may perhaps be pardoned\nif he ventures to express an interest in the total lack of any refer-\nence in Dr Reitman's book to mediumistic art. Apart altogether\nfrom such important and complex cases as that of Thompson-\nGifTord, it is, to say the least, rather strange that the author has\nnot thought fit to mention the work of such well-known automa-\ntists as Mrs W. M. Wilkinson, Gilbert Cooke, F. L. Brown, A.\nMachner, F. Gentes, or Mrs I. T. Bush. Had he done so, and\nnoted the many striking parallels between schizophrenic art and\n\f440 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nthat of the automatists, he might have made an efiective addition\nto his discussion of the comparison between the paintings of\nschizophrenics and those of certain modern artists, while some\nsimilarity between these two classes of product is obvious. Dr\nReitman is at pains to point out that this is due to the modernistic\ntechnique of analysing a system of relations which necessarily leads\nto fragmentation. On the other hand the same fragmentation is\nseen in psychotic art, but here it is not due to any system of con-\nscious analysis but rather to the basic disintegration of the person-\nalities of the artists.\nFrom his treatment of psychotic art as seen psychologically it is\nclear that Dr Reitman has very little patience with the elaborate\ninterpretations of certain of the followers of Freud and Jung,\nalthough at the same time he does not seem to distinguish very\nclearly between the teachings of master and pupil. In this\nconnexion his short treatment of some of Goya's products appears\nrather unconvincing, and had he chosen Bosch instead of the\nSpanish artist the reader would have been much more interested\nin his diagnosis. His discussion is interesting, however, since he\nshows that, in his opinion, the content of the Caprichos can reveal\nmaterial which is pathognomonic of schizophrenic experience,\nalthough how far he would go in a further interpretation remains\nuncertain.\nTo sum up, then, Dr Reitman has written a thought-provoking\nbook which should be read by all who are interested in a little\nunderstood subject. Although the list of authorities is brief, it\ncontains a representative selection of easily available material,\nwhile those who require further references, can turn to the papers\nof Anastasi and Foley, although these authors, like Dr Reitman,\nseem to ignore most of the material on mediumistic art.\nE. J. Dingwall\nThe Mystery of Dreams. By William Oliver Stevens. London,\nAllen & Unwin, 1950. vi, 280 pp. i6s.\nMr Stevens has given us a book of a kind badly needed, one\nthat should put before us a large number and great variety of\ndreams, should classify them according to their significance for\npsychical research, and should comment on the points that\ndistinguish one example from another. The scheme of the book\nappears from the chapter headings. First come The Dream in\nLiterature, Symbolism in Dreams, and The Solution of a Problem\n(i.e. dreams in which a problem is solved for the sleeper) : then follow\nchapters in which Telepathic, Clairvoyant, Warning and Prophetic,\nBorderland, Concurrent and Reciprocal dreams are successively\npassed in review, with, to end, some cases difficult to classify.\n\f195 1] Reviews 441\nIn the concluding chapter the author explains the principles on\nwhich he has selected his examples. He mentions first readability,\nthat is '\nvariety in time, place, characters, and especially in type of\nincident ', but adds that primarily the selection was '\nbased on\nwhat seemed to be authenticity '. In all the cases cited he is\nconvinced that the narrators believed what they said, although\nsome of them date from an uncritical age, and for others corro-\nboration could not be obtained. With this caution in mind, the\nreader can rejoice that the author has cast his net so wide. Cases\nreported in good faith but falling short of the highest evidential\nstandards can be read '\nas Hierome saith '\nof the Apocr}'pha '\nfor\ninstruction\u2014but not to establish any doctrine '. Many of the\ncases cited are drawn from the Proceedings and Journal of our own\nand the American S.P.R. Others are taken from books of various\nkinds, and many were reported direct to Mr Stevens by corre-\nspondents in the United Kingdom and America.\nMr Stevens is impatient (pp. 57, 58) of attempts to explain\ndreams by bringing in '\nthe old reliable pack horse, the sub-\nconscious mind Most people, he truly says, '\nare quite hazy as\nto what the subconscious mind actually is and how it operates '.\nIn the present stage of our knowledge it is well not to attempt too\nprecise a definition of the subconscious mind. Many psychical\nresearchers would not accept the author's description of it as '\na\ncomplete record of our lives '\n:\n'\ncomplete '\nis too wide, and\n'\nrecord '\nsuggests passivity. It looks as if he supposed that the\nchampions of the subconscious regarded it as the ultimate source\nof all paranormal cognition, and not, as most of them do, as the\npotential vehicle, and in many cases the probable vehicle, for\nmaterial of external origin.\n'\n_ _\n- W. H. S.\nThe Revolt against Reason. By Arnold Lunn. London,\nEyre & Spottiswoode, 1950. xi, 252 pp. 15s.\nThe author of this lively and stimulating book writes with the\nenthusiasm of the Catholic convert, and displays an extensive\nacquaintance with the writings of philosophers and theologians\nfrom antiquity to the present day. One wonders, however,\nwhether the abundance of often lengthy quotations is due to a\nnaive desire to show that he is in good company in his opinions,\ni.e. an appeal to authority, or due to the urge '\nto add verisimili-\ntude. . .\n.' His tale, however, though in many places unconvincing\nto the non-Catholic, is never bald. Mr Lunn starts from the\npremise that the Catholic religion is an essentially rational system\nbased on Revelation and the Aquinate '\nproofs '\nfor the existence of\nGod, and that faith derived from mystic experience is almost an\n\f442 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nunnecessary and not always welcome adjunct. Luther, he main-\ntains, by exalting mysticism and denying the relevance of reason\nin matters of religion, was the initiator of the '\nFlight from Reason\n'\nand of the subsequent\u2014according to Mr Lunn, consequent\n\u2014\ndecline in morality, ethics, and aesthetics which has reached its\nclimax in our day, especially in the dictatorial systems. This\ntheme is developed with much ingenuity.\nA large part of the book is taken up with a '\ndebunking '\nof\nDarwinism and a vigorous attack on the '\nscientians ', a term\ncoined by Mr Lunn to describe those materialists and crypto-\nmaterialists who deny the supernatural and affirm the omni-\ncompetence of natural science. In the Western world at least, this\ntype is fast becoming extinct and thus the author's attacks, which\nare mostly well-reasoned, apply largely to Victorian and early\ntwentieth century scientists. He makes much of the practice among\nscientists of often ignoring facts which are inexplicable by, or in\ncontradiction to, a current theory. In this context his examples\nare drawn mainly from biology and the realm of paranormal\nphenomena. If Mr Lunn had been an experimental scientist he\nwould have known that in order to construct any theory it is not\nonly permissible but essential to neglect some facts ; otherwise\n\u2014\nhuman limitations being what they are\u2014it would be impossible to\nformulate any theories at all. The successive theories in any\nsubject embrace an ever-increasing number of hitherto ignored\nfacts. His argument, that because the theory of evolution cannot\naccount for certain facts, therefore special creation must be true,\nshows that he does not comprehend the true role of scientific\ntheory. No theory can be completely adequate to its subject, and\na theory has fulfilled its purpose when it is seen to be inadequate\nand is superseded by a new one. Furthermore, he fails to appre-\nciate that a theory of special creation is heuristically useless.\nAs far as paranormal phenomena are concerned, the pretext for\nignoring them among many scientists was, and still often is, dis-\nbelief. The true reason, however, is that they seem irrelevant and\ncannot be fitted anywhere into the present world picture. It is\njust as unreasonable to reproach Victorian and later scientists for\nignoring paranormal phenomena as it would be to reproach\nGalileo for ignoring magnetism and electricity. The phenomena\navailable at the time just did not fit in anywhere into the current\nview of the universe. That is why the present state of psychical\nresearch is as good an example as any in the history of science, of\nthe necessity for a working hypothesis before systematic experi-\nmental work can be planned.\nTo the non-Catholic many arguments in this book are difficult\nto swallow. In particular, in discussing the dichotomy between\n\f1] Reviews 443\nmaterialists and theists, Mr Lunn seems to be unaware that many\nintellectually honest people are content to be agnostics and to base\ntheir morality on intuitive feelings of human dignity.\nThis is definitely a thought-provoking book.\nP. H. Plesch\nJournal of Parapsychology, Vol. 14, no. 4, December 1950.\nDurham, N.C., Duke University Press. $1.25.\nProfessor Rhine makes a mid-century appraisal of the present\nposition in parapsychology. He lists as solved problems the\nseparate occurrence of E SP and P K, the occurrence of clairvoyant\nESP, of precognition, and, as a deduction from these, the non-\nphysical nature of psi. He indicates more problems not yet solved\nor not fully solved, of which examples are : the experimental\ndemonstration of telepathic ESP, the possibility of conscious\ncontrol of psi, and the biological nature of psi capacities.\nRemi Cadoret and Dr Pratt report a tendency to consistent\nmissing in ESP experiments, that is for the guessing of one face\nwhen another was really the target. With the help of Dr Greville\nthey have evolved a method of dealing with the somewhat difficult\nstatistical problem of assessing the presence of such a tendency.\nW. A. McElroy and Miss Winifred Brown report an experiment\ndone at Glasgow University on the effect of giving mild electric\nshocks as punishments for incorrect responses in an ESP experi-\nment. It was hoped that this method would make learning\npossible. This hope was not fulfilled, since in the series in which\nshocks were given there was a significant decline efl'ect. The rate\nof scoring in the series of experiments with shocks showed an\nover-all significant deviation from mean chance expectation, while\na series without shocks showed a much smaller positive deviation.\nOlivia Rivers gives a brief account of an experiment designed\nto test the correlation between psi capacity and the results of a\nmental health rating. Although her subjects showed significant\nscores in an ESP test, these were found to be not significantly\ncorrelated with their mental health ratings.\nAn exploratory experiment by J. B. Rhine on two water diviners\nshowed interesting results of which the principal was a strongly\nsignificant tendency to score below mean chance expectation.\nProfessor Rhine is inclined to attribute this resuk to the mental\ntension connected with the experimental situation.\nR. H. Thouless\n\f444 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nCORRESPONDENCE\nMetaphysics and Parapsychology\nSir,\u2014Dr Rhine's Myers Lecture Telepathy and Human\nPersonality contains a plea that in pursuing parapsychological\nresearch we shall free ourselves from '\nspeculative associations and\ncultural trappings '\n(pp. 30-1) and from '\ntraditions of theological\nand occult character '. I suggest that it is impossible completely\nto avoid making metaphysical assumptions in our scientific think-\ning, and that Dr Rhine's lecture is an illustration of the truth of\nthis.\nTo begin vi^ith, he assumes, as most psychical researchers do,\nthat we can distinguish telepathy from clairvoyance. I do not\nquarrel with this distinction if it is merely one of scientific method,\nbut I must insist that if we regard it as more than this, we have\nadopted a metaphysical theory. For there is one type of meta-\nphysical theory, that of modern objective idealism, for which this\ndistinction vanishes. On this view, '\nobject ' and '\nsubject '\nare\nabstractions, the concrete ontological unit containing both subject\nand object, and therefore what we call clairvoyance is, in a broad\nsense, telepathy, for the object perceived in clairvoyance is always\nknown to a superconsciousness, or oversoul, or to the orthodox\nChristian God who can be regarded both as transcendent and as\nimmanent in finite beings.\nBoth in Dr Rhine's lecture and in the Thouless-Wiesner four\npossible interpretations of '\nperson to person transference of\nthought impressions '\n(p. 19) we see the influence of a realist\nmetaphysic which is just as '\nspeculative '\nas the idealist. Indeed,\nDr Rhine's statement on p. 29 of '\nthe primary question of psi\nresearch '\nalmost suggests that he has not completely freed himself\nfrom the influence of the crude materialism which held that the\nbrain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile. He states that the\nprimary task is the discovery '\nwhether there is an immaterial part\nof human personality, a spiritual self that might conceivably be\nconsidered capable of survival '. Here we see clearly the meta-\nphysical assumption that whatever else may not be real, the body\nas a '\nthing-in-itself ' indubitably is. Now quite apart from the\nidealist metaphysic, which has been held by thinkers of the calibre\nof Hegel, Edward Caird, T. H. Green, F. H. Bradley, Bernard\nBosanquet, W. T. Stace, and Brand Blanshard, what about the\nphysicists' discovery that the notion of a three-dimensional ' block\nUniverse '\nin a common time order must be given up and that we\nmust reason as if the '\nthing-in-itself ' were a four-dimensional\n\f1951] Correspondence 445\ncontinuum which must be measured by '\ncomplex numbers '\n?\nWhat about the discovery that even the electron cannot consist-\nently maintain its objective substantiality but becomes a wave\n\u2014\nand a wave of what? It is matter, not the spiritual self, that is\ndoubtful today. For although the four- dimensional continuum,\ntensors, matrices, and all the rest of the mathematical physicist's\nstock-in-trade cannot safely be regarded as more than methodo-\nlogical devices to enable observers to adapt themselves to and to\ncontrol their environment, it is quite impossible to talk and write\nabout physics unless we assume the existence of observers who\nuse the devices\u2014and for that matter who read or listen to our\nexpositions! It is consciousness (using the word not as referring\nto the '\nentity '\nattacked in Professor Gilbert Ryle's Concept of\nMind but rather as the general term covering seeing, hearing,\nthinking, feeling, and so on) that is the indubitable reality. It is\n'\nmatter '\nthat is on trial for its life, so to speak.\nThis last point is important when we try to assess the value of\nthe Thouless-Wiesner fourfold possibilities. One of the possi-\nbilities is that the sender's mind may influence directly the body of\nthe receiver ; another is that the sender's body may influence\ndirectly the mind of the receiver. Now there would be some point\nin considering these '\npossibilities '\nif the metaphysical doctrine\nof the body as a '\nthing-in-itself ' were established, and if the\nnotion of action between a person's '\nmind '\nand his own '\nbody\n'\ncould be freed from absurdity. But one of the reasons for rejecting\nthe theory that a person is a duality in which a realist or '\nthing-\nin-itself '\nbody is the primal certainty and his consciousness some-\nhow derived or epiphenomenalistic, is the absurdity in which we\nare landed if we try on this basis to explain the simplest act of\nperception. What, from this point of view, is supposed to happen\nwhen I see a patch of colour? Rays of light, it will be said, are\nreflected from the patch in straight lines to my eyes, and then\nmicroscopic motions, which are different if the patch is red from\nwhat they are if it is blue, are propagated along certain nerves to\nthe higher centres of my brain. What happens then? Well, if\nthe motions correspond to red I see red and if they correspond to\nblue I see blue. But why should I ? The redness or blueness has\nnot been conveyed to my brain ; all that has been conveyed is\nmotions. The only possible answer, on this set-up, is that I must\nsomehow possess in my mind something analogous to the de-\ncyphering tables by which a cyphered message is translated into\nordinary language. I translate the motions into the sensuous\nquality which they symbolise.\nNow a person who can believe this is capable of believing any-\nthing. It is obviously nonsense. When I see a patch of colour I\n\f446 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nsee a patch of colour. If I am told that the decyphering is done by\nmy '\nsubconscious '\nI must reply that these words convey nothing ^\nto me, and in any case are not an explanation. That we are\nconscious is certain. That there exist material organisms which\nare things-in-themselves, i.e. which exist out of all relation to any\nconsciousness whatsoever, is a metaphysical hypothesis the truth\nof which, to put it mildly, is highly speculative. If psychical\nresearch is to keep clear of '\nspeculative associations '\nit must stick\nto the '\nperson to person '\naccount of those phenomena which, as a\nmatter of purely scientific method, have in the past been legiti-\nmately distinguished as '\ntelepathic '\nfrom '\nclairvoyant\nF. H. Cleobury\nPrecognition and PK\nSir,\u2014Dr Thouless's important and otherwise admirably lucid\npaper '\nA Report on an Experiment in Psycho-kinesis with Dice\n'\n{Proceedings, Part 179) contains one passage which seems to\nrequire clarification. I refer to the two paragraphs (pp. 1 12-13)\non the strength of which Thouless makes the following claim for\nthe method he has employed: '\nSuccess in such a P K experiment\ncan only be explained by precognition if we make the absurd\nassumption that when we are doing a PK experiment, we can\nprecognise with an incomparably greater accuracy than when we\nare doing a precognition experiment.' (My italics.) Whether or\nnot this conclusion is warranted, it does not follow from the\npreceding argument. His previous paragraph leads one to expect\nthat the rival hypothesis which he is concerned to eliminate is that\nthe subject precognises the falls of the machine-thrown dice and\ncauses the corresponding targets to be selected by some means\nother than PK. In the argument which follows, however,\nThouless discusses only the possibility of the subject's precognis-\ning the series of events which determined the target-selection.\nBut in what way could this possibility be relevant? What purpose\ncould such precognition have served, since the subject was in any\ncase informed by his senses of the results of the target-selection\nbefore he started to try to influence the machine-thrown dice?\nSurely no one would claim to explain the extra-chance corre-\nspondence between the dice-falls and the targets by supposing that\nthe subject precognised both of these series of events!\nAccording to the rival hypothesis which ought to be considered,\nwe must suppose that Thouless {qua subject) precognised the faces\nwhich would preponderate in the ensuing block of falls from his\nmechanical thrower. The question is whether it was possible for\nhim to influence the selection of the corresponding targets by any\n\f195 1]\nCorrespondence 447\nmeans other than PK. Now Thouless tells us that he selected\nblocks of targets by choosing one of seventeen 6x6 Latin squares\nand then permuting its rows and columns several (we are not\ntold how many) times in ways determined by a series of manual\ndice-throws. Thouless acknowledges that manual dice-throwing\nis not an adequate test for PK since success may be due to an\nacquired skill. The rival hypothesis, then, is that Thouless's\nresults were due to precognition plus skill in dice-throwing. We\ncannot, however, try to apply this hypothesis in detail because we\nare not told what rules were adopted in permuting the rows and\ncolunms of the Latin squares. If, for example, Thouless per-\nformed an irregular number of such operations (though I do not\nimagine he did this) his decisions when to stop might have been\ninfluenced by his precognition. But apart from this possibility,\nskill in hand-throwing might have enabled him to control the\narrangement of the targets to an appreciable extent.\nTo return to Thouless's above-quoted conclusion, surely it is\nnot necessary to suppose that we can only eliminate the PK\nhypothesis if we assume '\nthat we can precognise with an in-\ncomparably greater accuracy than when we are doing a precogni-\ntion experiment In order to explain the results in his machine-\nthrown series, whose average '\nefficiency '\nwas a little below\nper cent, we should not, as Thouless implies, need to postulate\nprecognition which was 100 per cent efficient. It would surely be\nsufficient to postulate an average efficiency of about 12 per cent\nfor both the precognition and the manual control of the dice used\nin target-selection.\nThe best argument against this counter-hypothesis would be to\npoint out that in the earlier experiments for PK when Thouless\nused hand-throwing his efficiency was less than i per cent.\n(Thouless indicates, however, that it was appreciably higher in the\nearlier stages.) We can conclude, then, that the results in his\nmachine-thrown experiments must be attributed to P K, unless we\nsuppose either that Thouless precognises much more accurately\nwhen he is not trying to do this, as in a PK experiment, than he\ndoes when he is trying, as in a precognition experiment, or that\nThouless can control the fall of hand-thrown dice much more\nefficiently when he is not trying to do this than when he is trying.\nThis consideration does make the counter-hypothesis very un\nplausible\u2014but not, I think, absurd. For as Thouless emphasises\nlater in his paper (p. 117 and pp. 123-4), it seems to be favourable\nto a person's exercise of psi-faculties that he should not be\ntrying.\nC. W. K. MUNDLE\n\f44^ Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nSir,\u2014Mr Mundle's suggestion as to how PK results with\ntargets determined by Latin squares might be explained as due\nto a combination of precognition and skilled throwing is in-\ngenious. I do not think, however, that it is a possible explanation\nof my results.\nHe asks what rules I adopted in permuting rows and columns of\nthe Latin square. My method was to throw four dice at a time from\na shaker. These were marked A, B, C, and D. Suppose the dice\nfell A4, B2, C2, Di. I put the row starting with 4 as the top row,\nthat startine with 2 as the second row, and that starting with i as\nthe third row (ignoring the fall of C because the row starting with\n2 was already placed). I would then throw all four dice again.\nIf they now fell A6, B2, C3, D6, I put the row starting with 6 as\nthe fourth row, and that starting with 3 as the fifth row (again\nignoring the falls of B and D because these numbers had fallen\nearlier). The only row now left is that starting with 5, so that\nwould become the sixth row. The columns were then permuted\nin the same way. This system of permutations was performed once\nonly to obtain each square. There would be no advantage in\nrepeating the process since every Latin square that can be derived\nfrom a particular starting square can be obtained by one system of\npermutations.\nMr Mundle asks an interesting question when he considers\nwhat percentage of success in skilled throwing and precognition\nwould be necessary to obtain a given rate of scoring. The figures\nhe gives are, however, far from correct. In saying that a 12 per\ncent rate of success in each would give a i| per cent scoring rate\nhe overlooks two facts. First, to get success it would be necessary\nto have the row position and the column position both right as\nwell as the precognition, so that a 12 per cent success in each of\nthe operations would lead only to hitting the right block of falls\n\u202217 per cent of times (not 1-4 per cent). Even this would, how-\never, not mean that the score was -17 per cent. Mr Mundle seems\nto assume that a hit on the right block would give 100 per cent\nright on that block. This would be true only if the blocks were of\nsingle falls. In my experiment, the blocks were of 12 falls, and I\nfind that the average expectation of scoring by the best scoring\ntarget face would be 2 over mean chance expectation. So the\nexpectation of scoring, assuming 12 per cent accuracy in dice\ncontrol and precognition, would be the negligible amount of -03\nper cent (less than one unit in the total score of my experiment\nIIa).\nOne could, of course, deal with the question in another way.\nAssuming that the rows have been permuted, the chance of getting\na given column into the best scoring position (assuming 12 pe^.\n\f1951] Correspondence 449\ncent efficiency of precognition and dice control) is 1-4 per cent.\nBut now we are dealing with bigger blocks, and the mean chance\nexpectation of scoring by putting a column into the best scoring\nposition is only about +3 to +4 (on 72 falls), which leads to a\nlower expectation than that resulting from assuming control of\nboth rows and columns.\nIf we ask the question the other way round : what expectation\nof success in precognition and dice control would be necessary to\naccount for a i| per cent rate of scoring, we find it is slightly less\nthan 50 per cent. A 50 per cent rate of success in each would lead\nto a total score of 2 per cent. Did I exaggerate in saying that\nsuccess by precognition assumed an '\nincomparably greater\naccuracy '\nin precognition than any we have observed in a pre-\ncognition experiment?\nIf a rate of precognition of the order of 50 per cent is far\ngreater than any that has been observed, even this would be of no\nuse on Mr Mundle's hypothesis unless it were accompanied by\nsuccess in dice control of the same order. We have no evidence\nof any ability to control dice falls by skill, and if such an ability\nexisted at anything approaching this level of success it could not\nhave failed to be observed. The only way I can see in which\nmanner of throwing might effect dice falls is if one used biased\ndice and found that one way of throwing maximised the bias\neffect while another way reduced it to a minimum. The first way\nof throwing would then give a slightly enhanced expectation of\nscoring on one of the faces favoured by bias. At best the effect\nwould be small and quite insufficient for the present purpose.\nThere seems no reason for supposing that by skill one can throw\na die so that a given face will be more likely to fall uppermost, but\nan even more fantastic assumption must be made if one is throwing\nfour dice at a time, that one can control which dice will fall which\nway. If that can be done to any degree at all, I think we should\nall agree to accept it as evidence for P K and against skill. I must\nconfess that I did not adopt this method in order to meet the point\nthat Mr Mundle has urged but only to save myself trouble.\nThe most important question is not whether I have succeeded\nin making an experimental design which eliminates explanation of\nPK success by precognition, but whether in principle it is possible\nto do so. Even if one agreed that Mr Mundle's suggested explana-\ntion in terms of precognition and skill were a valid criticism of my\nexperiment, it could very easily be met by eliminating any choice\n(by dice or otherwise) in the selection of the arrangement of target\nfaces. One could simply take the first Latin square in the Fisher\nand Yates tables and use that unchanged throughout an experi-\nment. My own method for some time past has been to use a\n\f450 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nsuccession of the same five Latin squares in all experiments,\nrepeating the series unchanged after the fifth. This also was\noriginally adopted as a time saving device but it seems adequate to\nmeet Mr Mundle's objection.\nR. H. Thouless\nWater Divining\nSir,\u2014The journal of the Society for Psychical Research for\nMarch-April 195 1 contains a note by D. P. on the report of what\nhe describes as a '\ncarefully designed research project ' which\nappeared in the Journal of the American Society for Psychical\nResearch for January 195 1.\nAs stated in their report the problem the experimenters set\nthemselves was simply, '\nCan water diviners find water under\nconditions in which the professional geologist is unable to do\nso?\n'\nIn the light of many years objective experience of dowsers and\ntheir craft, I would like to make a few comments on the most\nobvious fallacies in the rather one-sided contest described in the\nreport.\nIf the experimenters had known more about the practical\nresults of dowsing they might not have thought it worth while to\ncarry out this experiment, for numerous cases are on record where\na dowser has located underground water in an area where a geo-\nlogist has failed to do so.\nIn any case the test as arranged was not calculated to solve the\nproblem, as by selecting a site which was practically waterlogged\nthe conditions were such that a geologist would be certain of\nfinding water in it.\nIt is not apparent that any of the twenty-seven dowsers were\nreally possessed of skill and experience and one, '\nan adolescent\ngirl ', could not possibly have been.\nThe site selected was entirely unsuitable, as water stood a few\nfeet below the surface and no dowser could be expected to work\nsatisfactorily in such an area. This fact alone is enough to damn\nthe whole experiment.\nThe dowsers were not allowed to work freely. They were\nblindfolded and manhandled. This sort of personal interference\nwould be enough to disconcert any good dowser. A scientific\ndowser would get all the information he could from wells in the\nneighbourhood and in estimating depth and flow would employ a\nprocess involving measurements requiring a certain amount of\ntime to carry out.\n\f1951] Correspondence 451\nThis test adds one more to a list of many others carried out by\nuninformed experimenters under unsuitable conditions and from a\nscientific point of view is misleading and quite without value.\n{Colonel) A. H. Bell\nPresident, British Society of Dowsers\nSir,\u2014Your reviewer speaks very highly of the recent American\nfield experiment in dowsing. He concludes that '\nif a test of this\nkind is not a valid test of dowsing then we may as well throw up\nthe sponge and declare that the phenomenon, as claimed, is un-\ntestable '. I wish I could agree with your reviewer's estimate\nof the experiment and with his conclusion, but I cannot. The\nnames of the sponsors of the experiment are a guarantee of a\nconscientious and sincere piece of work : but that, alas, is not\nenough. It is surely a rather elementary principle of scientific\nmethodology that when the attempt is made experimentally to\nreproduce an alleged phenomenon, the conditions of the experi-\nment must be the conditions under which the phenomenon is\nalleged to occur. There can be an exception to this rule only if\nthese conditions are such as to make verification impossible.\nThus, in our field, if a medium claims that certain phenomena\nwill occur in his presence only in the dark and in the absence of\ncontrol, the investigator is obliged to suspend judgment, and is\nperhaps even entitled to reject the claim on the ground that it is\nuntestable. Dowsing fortunately is not an alleged phenomenon of\nthis order. Nothing is easier than to put dowsing practically to\nthe test under natural conditions : nothing is easier, but un-\nfortunately nothing in psychical research is more expensive.\nThat is the crux of the matter, that is why after many years of\neffort I have never been able to organize a proper investigation.\nThe American group have tried hard to do it cheaply, but I fear\nthat they have produced a quite inconclusive report.\nTheodore Besterman\nSir,\u2014The twenty-seven dowsers accepted the conditions and\n'\nin spite of . . . minor difficulties ... it was apparently the belief\nof all that the rod responded normally to underground water '.\nThe American team made ultra-modest claims for their experi-\nments, as I was careful to emphasize by extensive quotation.\nIn The Divining Rod by Sir William Barrett and Theodore\nBesterman (1926) a whole chapter is devoted to experiments with\ndowsers who were blindfolded and often '\nmanhandled '. These\nexperiments were for the most part regarded as successful. It is\ndifficult to resist the conclusion that it is only the unsuccessful\ndowsing experiment which evokes criticism.\n\f452 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nDowsers and their sponsors could help us by setting down an\nirrevocable statement of the conditions they will accept for a\npracticable definitive test.

Humphrey\nIn recent years a growing interest has developed in the possibiHty\nof finding personaHty characteristics that distinguish the subjects\nwho do well in ESP tests from those who score at the chance level\nor even below. The discovery of such characteristics would serve\na twofold purpose. First, by knowing what kinds of persons suc-\nceed or fail in ESP tests, we should gain in understanding the\nnature of E S P, its possible inhibitors and facilitators. Second, the\npossession of personality ratings that, with some degree of success,\nenable us to predict a subject's ESP scoring level should give us\nincreased control over ESP.\nWe are by no means at the stage of possessing reliable instru-\nments for predicting ESP scores, but the results of the ESP-\npersonality research programme have been encouraging. A\nbrief review of several of the findings may help in judging the\nprogress attained so far, and suggest areas for further research.\nThis review will deal primarily with some of the researches of the\nParapsychology Laboratory at Duke University, since readers of\nthis Journal are already familiar with the important work of Dr\nGertrude Schmeidler (4).\nA great deal of the research has involved the use of two general\nmethods of personality classification. By one method subjects are\ngiven personality ratings based on certain characteristics shown in\ntheir freehand drawings. The other general method of subject\nrating involves two diflierent ways of scoring subjects' responses to\nitems in an interest inventory questionnaire. This summary of the\nfindings relating to these personality measures will include all\navailable data, both published and unpublished. Recent unpub-\nlished researches involving other personality ratings will be\nreviewed briefly.\n453\n\f454 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nEXPANSION-COMPRESSION AND CLAIRVOYANCE\nDRAWINGS RESULTS\nIn present-day clinical psychology, projective techniques are\nbeing used widely for personality studies. In a projective test the\nsubject is given a relatively unstructured situation to which he is\nrequired to respond, and in so doing he reveals certain charac-\nteristic ways of seeing life and of reacting to it emotionally.\nCertain criteria for judging personality characteristics from\ndrawings have been devised, and one of the most useful for ESP\nresearch has been that of expansion-compression (i, 2). In\napplying this criterion a judge considers primarily the form quality\nof a drawing\u2014not what was drawn, but how it was drawn. The\nperson who is rated '\ncompressive '\nusually uses faint, timid lines\nin making his drawing ; he commonly makes tiny little pictures\nsqueezed into a small area of the paper. A subject is rated '\ncom-\npressive '\nif the qualities of his drawing indicate that he has been\nunwilling or unable to express himself freely. An '\nexpansive\n'\nperson, on the other hand, makes a drawing with free, bold lines,\nplacing objects on the page with a good sense of proportion and\nproper relationship with the background. Whereas the compres-\nsive subject often draws conventional, stereotyped, or abstract\npictures, the expansive person usually draws pictures that show\nsome imagination. In brief, then, the compressive drawing in-\ndicates that the subject was inhibited from expressing himself\nfreely, while the expansive drawing reveals no such inhibition on\nthe part of the subject.\nOne of the classical experimental methods of psychical research\nrequires the subject to draw his impressions as to the content or\ntheme of concealed target pictures. These ESP drawings are\nquite amenable to the same type of analysis in terms of form\nqualities as clinical psychologists use in evaluating free drawings.\nHere the ESP test is the projective personality test. By studying\nthe drawings a subject has made in an ESP test, we may get clues\nas to his attitude towards the test situation: the drawing may indi-\ncate whether the subject was entering wholeheartedly into the\nESP test or whether he was tense and inhibited.\nUp to the present time, a total of twelve clairvoyance^ series\nwith drawings have been evaluated by the expansion-compression\ncriterion. 2 In all of these series the procedure and scoring methods\n' Throughout this paper the term '\nclairvoyance '\nis used for con-\nvenience in referring to the type of ESP test in which the nature of the\ntarget pictures or the order of ESP cards are not known at the time of the\ntest. No attempt was made in any of these '\nclairvoyance '\nseries to\nexclude the possibility of precognitive telepathy.\n^ The first four series were carried out at Stanford University under\nDr Stuart's direction (6); five were the work of experimenters at the\n\f195 1] Relation of Some Personality Ratings to ESP Scores 455\ndevised by the late Dr C. E. Stuart (6) were used. In a typical test\nsession the subject is presented with a sealed opaque envelope and\nasked to draw his impressions as to the content or theme of the\nenclosed picture. Ordinarily he makes four drawings to four\ndifferent target pictures in one session.^ Later, the four response\ndrawings and the four targets are presented in a random arrange-\nment to an independent judge for scoring. Briefly, the judge's\ntask is to give each response drawing a score of 4, 3, 2 or i to indi-\ncate the degree of its resemblance to each target picture. The\nmaterial is scored in this way by two independent judges who do\nnot know the true order of the response drawings or target pictures.\nFrom the figures assigned by the judges, it is easy to compute a\nnumerical score for each set of drawings. The figures so obtained\nmay be compared with the known '\nchance '\nscore and evaluated\nby conventional statistical procedures.\nThe expansion-compression rating is also made by an inde-\npendent judge (usually myself) who does not know the ESP\nscores of the set of drawings. The ESP scores of the expansive\nsubjects are then compared with the ESP scores of the compressive\nsubjects.\nThe average ESP scores of the expansive and compressive\ngroups of subjects in each series are shown graphically in Figure i.\nIn ten of the twelve series, the expansive subjects as a group ob-\ntained a higher average ESP score than did the compressive sub-\njects. When the probabilities associated with the diff'erence in\neach series are combined (by Fisher's method), we find that, con-\nsidered in its entirety, the expansive-compressive difference is\nsignificant with a probability of approximately -005.\nIt is interesting to note that the total results of these series are\ninsignificant. Without the help of the expansion-compression\ncriterion in separating two different types of subjects, we would\nprobably have rejected these series as being of no value in the\nsearch for evidence of ESP or for clues as to its nature. Un-\ndoubtedly the time-consuming drawings procedure would have\nbeen abandoned in favour of the quicker, more productive card-\ntest measures.\nThe results shown in Figure i provide evidence that ESP was\nfunctioning in these series as a whole. We see that generally the\nParapsychology Laboratory of Duke University. One of the series was\nreported by Nash and Richards (3) in connection with their PK work at\nWashington College, Maryland. Of the two remaining series (unpub-\nlished), one was done by Gladys Gillman, an undergraduate student in\nphilosophy at Skidmore College, and the other by Lillian Ellis, a psy-\nchology teacher at Edgewood Park, a junior college in New York State.\n^ In three of the available series, each subject made only two drawings\nin the clairvoyance test.\n\f45^ Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\ngroup of subjects labelled expansive hit the target pictures much\nbetter than the group of compressives. In fact the tendency is for\nthe group of compressives to avoid the target pictures to a signifi-\ncant degree. Now it is also of interest to see how many of the\nindividual subjects followed the trend shown by each group. In\nthe twelve series there were 140 expansive subjects. Of these 54\nper cent had positive ESP scores, 7 per cent gave the expected\nchance score, and 39 per cent gave ESP scores below chance\nexpectation. From these figures we see that the majority of ex-\npansive subjects followed the group trend and that their group\nresult is not due to merely a few outstanding subjects.\nIn the compressive group there were 345 subjects. Of these 42\nper cent gave positive ESP scores, 6 per cent gave 'chance'\nscores, and 52 per cent gave negative ESP scores. Here again we\nhave the majority (although a small one) contributing to the total\nefl^ect.\nFrom a study of the expansion-compression ratings of subjects\nwho have participated in more than one experimental session, it\nbecomes apparent that the rating is indicative of the subject's\nmood of the moment. A given subject's drawings may be com-\npressive at one session and expansive at the next. Furthermore,\nanalysis reveals that the subject's ESP scores reflect this change\nfrom compression to expansion, the score on the latter occasion\nbeing higher than on the former. Even within the course of a\nsingle session, too, a subject may change from compressive to ex-\npansive, or vice versa, and his ESP scores tend to change ac-\ncordingly.\nIt at once becomes apparent that a measure dealing with\ntransient moods of the subject would be a valuable adjunct to\nparapsychological research. The records of most subjects, even\nthe outstanding ones, show fluctuations which, so far, the experi-\nmenters have been unable to predict in advance. A measure such as\nexpansion-compression affords an objective basis for separating\ndata obtained from a subject experiencing different moods or\nattitudes. Undoubtedly there are other psychological measures of\nmood which may be devised for use in ESP test situations ; it\nwould seem worthwhile for parapsychologists to devote some time\nand thought to the perfecting of additional '\nmood-catchers '.\nEXPANSION-COMPRESSION AND GESP DRAWINGS SCORES\nIn general ESP tests (GESP), an agent in another room or\nbehind a screen (in group tests) looks at the target picture while\nthe subjects make their drawings. Otherwise the conduct of the\ntests and the scoring method are the same as for the clairvoyance\ndrawings series.\n\f195 1 ] Relation of Some Personality Ratings to ESP Scores 457\nTo date, the expansion-compression criterion has been appUed\nto nine such GESP series. The resuhs, as may be seen in\nFigure i, are opposite to those of the clairvoyance series: in\nGESP tests, the compressives tended to make higher ESP scores\nthan the expansives. The difference between the two types of\nsubjects for all series pooled is statistically significant. Eight of\nthe nine series followed the trend stated.\nFigure i\nDeviations of the average scores of expansive subjects (white bars) and of\ncompressive subjects (black bars) in all available series of ESP drawings tests.\nIn series graphed to the left of the vertical broken line, each subject made a full\nset of four drawings, while in the series shown after the vertical line, each subject\nmade only two drawings. The numbers given above or below each bar indicate\nthe number of subjects contributing to the deviation indicated.\nThis consistent difference in clairvoyance and GESP results\nconstitutes one of our most perplexing problems. One may\nspeculate about possible personality differences which might\ncause compressives, for example, to do poorly in a situation where\nthey are strictly on their own (clairvoyance) and to do well in tests\nwhere they have an agent to '\nhelp '\nthem (GESP). However, the\nreal answer to this problem must wait for further research. This\nfinding does emphasize the need in personality-ESP studies to\nkeep in mind the total psychological situation of the ESP tests.\nThe fact that a certain personality rating works well in separating\nsubjects in a certain type of ESP test is no guarantee that it will\n\f458 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nwork equally well on data of another type gathered by a different\nexperimenter under different psychological conditions.\nEXPANSION-COMPRESSION AND ESP CARD SCORES\nBecause the ESP drawings tests require quite a bit of time, not\nonly in having the subjects make four drawings, but also in\ngetting the material scored by two judges, we tried a number of\nexperiments to see if the expansion-compression rating would\ndistinguish high- and low-scoring subjects in ESP card tests. In\nsuch experiments the customary procedure was to have the sub-\njects make one or two drawings aimed at concealed targets and\nthen have them take two or four runs of ESP card tests. The\ndrawings were not scored for ESP but were used only as the basis\nfor the expansion-compression rating.\nTo date, twenty-nine separate experiments have been completed\nin which clairvoyance card tests and drawings were given each\nsubject. Of these, twenty-six w ere done at Duke University and\nthree were carried out by experimenters in other parts of the\nUnited States. Details of the experimental safeguards are not\nnecessary here. Suffice it to say that the cards were always screened\nfrom the subjects' view and that copies of the subjects' calls were\nalways collected by the experimenter before the true card order was\nrevealed (5).\nPsychological conditions in the series vary widely. Some of the\nexperiments were conducted for purposes other than that of\ntesting the effectiveness of the expansion-compression rating; in\nothers, variations in instructions were introduced in order to try\nto influence the expansion-compression rating. Most series in-\nvolved testing of groups of subjects, but in a few the subjects were\ntested individually. In some series the drawings were made before\nthe ESP card runs, and in others they were made afterwards.\nThe expansion-compression rating is based on one drawing per\nsubject in some series; in others it is based on two drawings each;\nand in three series, four drawings provide the basis for the rating.\nThe most stringent test of the expansion-compression rating\nthen would be to ignore the variations in psychological conditions\nand to consider the results of all available data. Doing this, we\nfind that the total results are insignificant; that is, the difference in\naverage run scores of the expansives and compressives is not\nstatistically significant (CR = i'i5), although the results do follow\nthe same trend as that shown in the clairvoyance drawings test data.\n(The 955 runs by expansive subjects gave a deviation of +62,\nwhile the 1949 runs by compressives had a deviation of -51.)\nA second glance at the total results reveals that the twenty-six\n\f1951] Relation of Some Personality Ratings to ESP Scores 459\nDuke series follow the drawings trend more closely, and that the\ndifference between the two groups of subjects in these series alone\nhas a probability of approximately -024. The non-Duke series,\nthen, show a reversal of the effect which is not statistically signifi-\ncant. The four series in which subjects were tested individually\ngive a much larger difference than that found in the twenty-five\ngroup-test series.\nOther subdivisions of the data into logical classifications are also\npossible, but it is not feasible now to go into the details concerning\nthese. In general, the data suggest that the expansion-compression\nrating is more effective when it is based on two drawings rather\nthan one, and when the drawings are given before the card runs\nrather than after them. Its effectiveness also seems to be a func-\ntion not only of the experimenter's personality, but also of other\npsychological conditions in the test situation.\nIn general, then, we may sum up the card-test results by saying\nthat there is some tendency for expansive subjects to score\npositively on clairvoyance card tests and for compressives to score\nbelow chance expectation. In the 29 experiments, 17 followed the\ntrend just stated, 9 showed a reversal, and 3 showed no difference\nat all between the two classifications of subjects. Thus, the\nexpansion-compression measure is by no means as effective in\nseparating high and low scorers in card tests as it was in E SP draw-\nings tests.\nINTEREST INVENTORY MEASURES AND CARD-TEST RESULTS\nMidrange-Extreme Measure. In 1946 Dr C. E. Stuart pub-\nlished an interest inventory consisting of a list of sixty items\nwhich subjects in ESP tests were asked to check on a five-point\nscale varying from '\nlike it very much '\nto '\ndislike it very much ',\nThe list included events, studies, and objects commonly of interest\nto college students in the United States; for example: tennis,\npicnics, formal affairs, zoos, history, mathematics, cameras, dogs,\nand the like. A simple method of scoring the subject's answers\nwas devised by Stuart, and by this method subjects were divided\ninto '\nmidrange '\nand '\nextreme '\ngroups. Midrange subjects were\nthose whose inventory scores did not differ appreciably from the\naverage score of their group; extreme subjects, on the other hand,\nwere those whose inventory scores were either high or low in\nrelation to the average group score. Testing this method of\nseparation on one series of clairvoyance drawings data, Stuart\nfound that the midrange subjects tended to do well in the ESP\ntest, while the subjects in the extreme group showed a tendency\nto score below chance expectation.\n\f460 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nFollowing this finding, Stuart went on to try the measure in\nseparating ESP card test data. At the time of his death he had\napplied the measure to eight series, all of which are also included\nin the expansion -compression research just discussed. He found\na highly significant difference in the clairvoyance card test scores\nof the two groups of subjects classified according to their interest\ninventory scores.\nI have continued this research and have to date completed the\nanalyses on thirty-two experimental series in all, including the\neight Stuart himself analysed. Many of these series have also\nfigured in the expansion-compression research; the experimental\nconditions were essentially the same as those mentioned briefly in\nthe expansion-compression section. Almost 900 subjects have\nparticipated in this research.\nIn the total of approximately 1700 card runs made by the mid-\nrange subjects, more hits were obtained than expected by chance,\nwhile, in the same number of runs, the extreme subjects obtained\nfewer than the expected number of hits. The difference between\nthe average ESP scores of the two groups is significant with a\nprobability of approximately -0004.\nThe analyses to determine how many of the subjects in each\ngroup followed the group trend have not been completed for all\n900 subjects. The results are available, however, for the data of\nthe first 517 subjects; so far they do show that the majority of the\nsubjects in each group follow the expected trend; that is, the\nmajority of the midrange subjects gave positive ESP results,\nwhile the majority of the extreme group gave negative results.\nFourteen-Item Scale. Another method of scoring the Stuart\nInterest Inventory has also been devised from a comparison of\nthe way a group of high-scoring and low-scoring ESP subjects\nanswered the items in the inventory. In the list of sixty items,\nfourteen were answered differently by high-scoring and low-scoring\nsubjects in three series of E S P tests. A system of scoring these\nfourteen items was set up, and subjects who made a certain\nnumber of points by this system were labelled '\nhigh ', and those\nhaving inventory scores below this point were called '\nlow '.\n'\nHigh '\nsubjects were expected to give positive ESP scores, while\n'low' subjects were expected to have ESP scores below chance\nexpectation. The effectiveness of the new scale was tried first\non thirteen of the series previously mentioned in the expansion-\ncompression section. The subjects rated '\nhigh '\non the scale did\nobtain positive ESP scores, while the '\nlow' subjects made ESP\nscores below '\nchance ', as predicted. Again, it was found that the\nmajority of the subjects followed the trend expected of them.\nSince the first trial of the scale, it has now been applied to the\n\f195 1] Relation of Some Personality Ratings to ESP Scores 461\ndata of sixteen additional series with rather disappointing resuks.\nThe trend shown in the early series has not held up consistently.\nIn fairness to the measure, it perhaps should be mentioned that the\nlater series include widely differing psychological conditions; and\nit is almost certain that the effectiveness of any measure of per-\nsonality is a function of the total experimental atmosphere, in-\ncluding experimenter's personality, instructions to subjects, type\nof ESP test, physical environment, etc. Nevertheless, if we\nignore these psychological differences and pool the results of all\ntwenty-nine series to which the measure has been applied, we find\nthat the difference between the ESP scores of the '\nhigh ' and '\nlow\n'\ngroups is such as would be expected by chance approximately\nthree times in a hundred.\nCOMBINATION OF THE TWO INVENTORY MEASURES\nAND EXPANSION-COMPRESSION\nIncreased efficiency in separating high- and low-scoring ESP\nsubjects results when we combine the personality measures. For\nexample, in combining the two inventory measures, we compare\nthe average ESP score of those subjects who received both mid-\nrange and '\nhigh ' ratings with the average ESP score of subjects who\nwere rated both extreme and '\nlow.' The ESP results for these two\ngroups are graphed in Figure 2 for the total of the twenty-nine\navailable clairvoyance series (the same series as were discussed in\nthe preceding sections). There we see that the combination of the\ntwo measures gives a greater degree of separation than was ob-\ntained by using each measure alone. The CR of the difference\nbetween the average ESP scores of the midrange-' high ' subjects and\nthe extreme-' low '\nsubjects is statistically significant (P = '0005).\nNow if we select from the midrange-' high '\ngroup those subjects\nwho were also rated expansive in their drawings, we find an even\nhigher rate of ESP scoring. And, if we take from the extreme-\n'\nlow '\ngroup those subjects who also received compressive ratings,\nwe find they give a lower rate of ESP scoring than did the whole\nextreme-' low ' group. In Figure 2 these results are also graphed for\nthe available sixteen series.^ The difference between the two\ngroups is significant with a probability of -0016. Although the\ndifference between these two subject groups is larger than the dif-\nferences obtained from the two inventory measures combined, it\nis not as significant because in using three measures together we\ndo not have as many subjects.\n^ Expansion-compression ratings were available for only sixteen of the\ntwenty-nine series involved in the interest inventory studies. Subjects in\nthe other series did not make drawings.\n\f462 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jULY\n5.3\n\"5.0\nU14\n4.e\nUldranga\nExpanal vaa\nCompreaalvea\nExtrema\nExpansive\nMldrar.ge\nHigh,\nMldranga\nHigh\nExtreoia\nLow\n4.7\n(29 aerlea) (32 aerlea) (29 Serlaa) (29 aerlea)\nOompreealTe\nExtreme\nLow\n(IS aerlea)\nFigure 2\nAverage run scores on clairvoyance card tests of subjects rated by several\nmeasures of personality. The results for the expansion-compression criterion\nare shown first, followed by the results of each of the two interest inventory\nmeasures. Then the separation of the data by the combination of inventory\nmeasures is shown, and finally, the inventory measures and the expansion-\ncompression criterion are combined.\nIn the expansive-midrange-' high '\ngroup there were 44 subjects\nin all. Of these 26, or 59 per cent, gave positive ESP results.\nIn the compressive-extreme-' low' group of 114 subjects, on the\nother hand, 68 per cent gave negative ESP results.^ Thus, when\nthe three measures are used in combination, there is a higher rate\nof success in placing high- and low-scoring subjects in their\nproper group. In these series, a total of 104 subjects out of 158,\nor 66 per cent of the subjects, were correctly placed in high- or\nlow-scoring groups. This increased efficiency resulting from com-\nbinations of personality measures suggests the value of giving sub-\njects batteries of personality tests. Perhaps by tapping other areas\nof personality we may gain an even higher degree of precision in\npredicting subjects' ESP scores.\n1 The chi-square from a contingency table based on these figures is\nsignificant, with a probability of \"003.\n\f1951] Relation of Some Personality Ratings to ESP Scores 463\nOTHER MEASURES OF PERSONALITY\nIN RELATION TO ESP SCORES\nIn recent research two questionnaire-type personality tests have\nbeen administered to subjects in ESP series. Since the results of\nthese experiments have not yet reached the publication stage, I\nshall give only a brief preview of the findings. In one clair-\nvoyance card-test series, subjects were given the Bell Adjustment\nInventory. By means of this questionnaire subjects are given\nratings in several different areas of adjustment (social, emotional,\nhealth, etc.). In this first use of the questionnaire there appears to\nbe a relationship between emotional adjustment and ESP scoring\nlevel. Subjects with '\naverage '\nor '\ngood '\nratings on emotional\nadjustment gave positive ESP scores, while those with '\nunsatis-\nfactory '\nratings made negative ESP scores. This is the first trial\nof the Bell Inventory in ESP research, but the results warrant its\ninclusion in other experiments.\nThe second questionnaire referred to is the Bernreuter Per-\nsonality Inventory. To date the Bernreuter has been given to\nsubjects in three experimental series. In all three, subjects rated\n'\nextravert ' gave positive ESP scores, while '\nintroverts '\nscored\nat the chance level or below. More than 70 per cent of the extra-\nverts obtained above '\nchance 'ESP scores, and more than 70 per\ncent of the introverts gave '\nchance '\nor negative ESP scores.\nThus, this introversion-extraversion scale of the Bernreuter\npromises to be one of our most valuable methods of classifying\nESP subjects.\nDISCUSSION\nThe findings of these personality studies indicate that we are\nmaking some progress in determining the distinguishing charac-\nteristics of high- and low-scoring ESP subjects. The work done\nso far is only a beginning, but the findings are encouraging enough\nto warrant a full-scale attack. It is probable that the emergence\nof ESP depends upon a variety of factors. The systematic study\nof E S P scores in relation to ratings on single personality charac-\nteristics is a worthwhile venture, but if ESP is dependent upon a\nnumber of personality factors, we should achieve a greater\nmeasure of success in predicting ESP scores if we take into\naccount combinations of personality traits. We have seen from the\ngraphs of Figure 2 that the most successful separation of subjects\noccurred when the three ratings of personality were used in com-\nbination. As we learn of other personality variables related to\nESP scoring and are able to use them jointly, we may be able\neventually to predict with a much higher degree of precision the\n\f464 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nESP score that will be given by a particular subject under certain\nconditions.\nOnce we have used a variety of personality ratings to predict a\ngiven subject's score, we must not, however, expect the subject to\nachieve that score no matter who tests him, no matter what type of\nESP test is given, and no matter what the psychological conditions\nof the tests are. Until we discover otherwise, it is safest to assume\nthat the personality factors distinguishing high- and low-scoring\nsubjects are a function of the total experimental situation. For\nexample, analyses of the series in which expansion-compression\nwas used show that some experimenters did not get as large an\nexpansive-compressive difference as did others. And as we saw\nin the ESP drawings experiments, expansives and compressives\ndid not give the same results in clairvoyance tests as they gave in\ntests where an agent was present. Thus, whenever we find\npersonality ratings that appear to correlate with ESP scores, we\nmust keep in mind that they may be applicable only in experiments\nwhere the psychological conditions and the specific ESP test are\nclosely similar to the situation in which the correlation was found.\nThe results of these particular personality-ESP studies so far\nindicate that the personality ratings are not separating subjects on\nthe basis of the amount of ESP shown. Neither individual\nmeasures of personality nor the combination of them give us, on\nthe one hand, subjects with a fair degree of E SP ability and, on the\nother, subjects with little or no ESP. Rather, what we have are\nsubjects who hit the target material and subjects who avoid it.\nIn each case, the ESP scores of contrasting groups based on per-\nsonality ratings are about equally deviant from the expected\nchance score. For example, in the clairvoyance drawings data, the\ncompressives' ESP scores are as different from the 'chance'\nscore as are the ESP scores of the expansives. Both groups of\nsubjects, then, demonstrate ESP to about the same degree. The\nmeasures of personality that we have been discussing separate\nsubjects in terms of the direction from '\nchance '\nin which their\nESP ability functions. They tell us whether a subject will\nscore positively or negatively, but not how much ESP he will show.\nAt first glance, it appears that Dr Schmeidler's Rorschach and\nsheep-goat studies do not fit in with the hypothesis that personality\nratings have been separating subjects principally in terms of the\nsign of their deviations. Her well-adjusted '\nsheep '\ngave positive\nESP scores, well-adjusted '\ngoats '\ngave negative ESP scores, and\nthe poorly-adjusted sheep and goats scored near the chance level.\nIt appears that here we may have a combination of measures that\nwould enable us to predict not only the direction of E SP deviation\n(above or below '\nchance '), but also the amount of ESP\u2014since\n\f195 1] Relation of Some Personality Ratings to ESP Scores 465\nthe poorly-adjusted subjects gave '\nchance '\nscores. Although it\nwould take a tedious statistical study to determine whether or not\nthe poorly-adjusted subjects score consistently close to the chance\nlevel, Dr Schmeidler's own impression is that some of the poorly-\nadjusted subjects score high and that others score low, making it\nimpossible to predict the score level of the whole poorly-adjusted\ngroup. If her impression is right, we have as yet found no\npersonality characteristics that we can be sure are related to amount\nof E SP ability. And yet there must be some differences in make-\nup which distinguish the Pearces, Shackletons and Mrs Stewarts\nfrom the rest of us. It will be interesting to see if further research\ncan discover any personality characteristics related to degree or\namount of E S P ability.\nTo add to an already complex picture, I should perhaps\nmention briefly another type of problem encountered in research\nwith the expansion-compression rating. There was no significant\ndifference in the clairvoyance card-test scores of the expansives\nand compressives, but we have found that the '\nposition effects\n'\nor distribution of hits through the session are quite different for the\ntwo types of subjects. The expansives tend to start off well,\ndecline in scoring somewhat, and then rise again at the end of the\nsession. The compressives, on the other hand, make a very bad\nbeginning (quite significantly negative), and then begin to score\nwell toward the last half of the test session. In fact, the compres-\nsives do as well in the third quarter of their sessions as the ex-\npansives do in either their first or fourth quarters. Even in the\nseries where there is no difference at all in total scores of expansives\nand compressives, these differences in hit distributions have been\nfound.\nThis finding suggests that the expansion-compression rating is\nnot dividing subjects according to whether they will score posi-\ntively or negatively, as we might suppose from looking at the\nearlier graph. Rather it appears to be separating subjects as to\ntype of hit distribution they will give. Whereas we found that\ncompressive subjects as a group gave negative ESP scores, we\nnow see that this score was due entirely to a bad beginning and\nthat these compressives are also capable of making positive ESP\nscores. It may be that we can devise test situations to bring out\nhigh scoring rates in compressive subjects.\nPosition effect studies on the data of other personality-E SP\nresearches have not yet been carried out, but they will be done also\nto see if the other measures could be separating subjects in terms\nof hit distributions instead of in terms of direction of deviation\n(positive or negative) from '\nchance '.\nSo far, the majority of personality researches have involved\n\f466 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nclairvoyance test scores. In a few experiments, tests of general\nESP were given the subjects. The striking differences in results\nof these two types of test in relation to personality ratings suggest\nthat we may have stumbled on to an important problem here. If\nwe can discover the cause for what appears to be a major difference\nbetween the two types of psi test, we may gain valuable clues for\nthe understanding of psi. For similar reasons it may be important\nto extend our study of personality to subjects in other types of psi\ntests, for example, in tests of precognition and psychokinesis.\nThe personality-ESP researches can hardly be said to have\nsolved many problems yet. They have given us some fair methods\nof predicting subjects' ESP scores; and by separating high and\nlow scorers, they have shown that ESP was operating in series\nwhose total deviation was insignificant. But, on the whole, these\nresearches have raised many more questions than they have\nanswered. And in bringing these problems to light, they have\nhelped to indicate a number of important areas for research.\nREFERENCES\n(1) Elkisch, P.

A question\ntherefore arises\u2014provided, of course, that the facts are such as to\nmake improbable an explanation by chance coincidence\u2014whether\nthe impression is strictly precognitive and relates to an entirely\nfuture event, or whether it represents the state of things as it\nexists at the time it is received. Two examples of this type of case\nare printed below.\nIt will be noted that in each of these cases veridical statements,\napparently paranormal, are mixed up in the dream with other\nelements that did not correspond to the facts of the case. Con-\nsidered as a whole, therefore, the dream content presents a\ndistorted picture of the actual situation. Distortion is very fre-\nquent in dreams, and it is necessary to disentangle from it any\nveridical elements a dream may contain and to consider these\nseparately on their own merits. As an interesting example of\ndistortion may be mentioned the case in Mrs Sidgwick's paper in\nS.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. XXXIII, p. 257, in which a dreamer saw\nhis fiancee with a swollen face looking out of a window of a house\non fire. The facts were that the lady had gone out on a cold night\nto watch a house on fire, and had caught a cold which had brought\non toothache and a swollen face. The dream therefore corre-\nsponded to the actual incident in two particulars: (i) a swollen\nface, and (2) a house on fire, which had in fact a connexion, but\njumbled them together in a way which did not at all correspond\nwith the actual circumstances. It is conceivable, but hardly\nprobable, that two such apparently unrelated elements should be\nreproduced in a dream by chance coincidence.\nW. H. S.\nCase No. i\nProfessor F. J. M. Stratton, F.R.S., has communicated to the\nSociety an account given him during the week 14-19 August 1950\nby Dr J. W. Hunkin, the late Bishop of Truro, of a dream which\ntook place on the night of Sunday-Monday, 2-3 July 1950 and\nappeared to refer to a parcel he received by the morning post on\n\f468 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nthe following day. Dr Hunkin put his own account of the dream\nin writing on 20 September 1950, and answered in a letter of 5\nOctober 1950 some questions put to him by Professor Stratton.\nUnfortunately, his sudden death after an operation removed the\npossibility of obtaining direct evidence from him as to some points\nwhich are not clear from these written statements. These points\nare, however, satisfactorily covered by Professor Stratton's\nrecollection of his conversation with the Bishop when he first\nheard of the case, and by written statements obtained from Dr\nHunkin's secretary. Miss Norma Wheeler.\nDr Hunkin's written account of his dream was as follows:\nAt breakfast I told of my dream. I had gone into a shop to buy wine.\nThey had brought me a very small bottle, price 7s. 6d. I said, '\nI\nshould like something less expensive.' They said, '\nYes\u2014this is a\nproprietary wine which makes the price higher.'\nAfter breakfast, I went into my study and my secretary. Miss Norma\nWheeler, opened a parcel containing just such a tiny bottle (it was a\nsample of Communion wine) and noted that the accompanying paper\nstated the price (of a full size bottle) as 7s. 6d.\n20 September 1950. {Sgd) J. W. Hunkin, Bishop of Truro\nAppended to Dr Hunkin's statement were the following con-\nfirmations:\nThe Bishop related the dream as stated above to me before he or I had\nseen the post that morning.\n20 September 1950 {Sgd) Norma M. H. Wheeler\nMy father related this incident to me later the same day. I questioned\nthe above witness and another as to the sequence of events and was\nsatisfied that it was as stated above.\n20 September 1950 {Sgd) Patience Hunkin\nDr Hunkin's statement does not make it clear where he first\nsaw the parcel in question. Was it, possibly, in the room where\nhe had breakfast, and was it later moved into his study where it\nwas opened by Miss Wheeler? In Professor Stratton's account,\nhowever, of his conversation with Dr Hunkin he says that '\nOn\ngoing into his study later he found a parcel containing a tiny\nbottle ', and in a subsequent letter to the Hon. Secretary of the\nSociety Professor Stratton adds, '\nMy memory is clear that the\nBishop had not seen the parcel until after breakfast.' There is\naccordingly no reason to infer that Dr Hunkin's recollection of his\ndream was in any way coloured by his having seen the parcel\ncontaining the bottle among the rest of his mail before he related\nthe dream.\nDr Hunkin told Professor Stratton that he had noted the inci-\ndent in his diary on the day of its occurrence, but in a letter of 21\n\f195 1] ^'^^ '\nArrival ' Cases 469\nSeptember he wrote that when he came to examine his diary he\nfound he had not recorded the incident after all, the reason being\nthat on that day he went to London and did not enter up his diary\nuntil after his return some time later. He then wrote it up very\nbriefly and forgot to record the incident.\nA question, of course, arises as to whether the receipt of a\nsample bottle of Communion wine was a frequent occurrence in\nDr Hunkin's experience. Professor Stratton questioned him on\nthat point, and he replied by his letter of 5 October 1950 that this\nwas the first little sample bottle which he had received for a\nnumber of years, that is, since he had been at Truro. As regards\nthe possibility that his mind might have been directed towards\nsamples of Communion wine by advertisements seen in Church\nnewspapers, Dr Hunkin's reply was that he took the Guardian and\noccasionally the Church of England Nezcspaper, but was not in the\nhabit of paying the slightest attention to advertisements. Pro-\nfessor Stratton examined the issues of both these papers from 3\nJuly 1950 back to the beginning of June, and found only one\nadvertisement of Communion wine, and that was of a brand of\nwine diff'erent from the sample received by Dr Hunkin, and at a\ndifferent price.\nAfter Dr Hunkin's death his secretary. Miss Wheeler, confirmed\nthe fact that the parcel was not on the breakfast table, and added\nthat she could not say for certain whether it was marked or\nlabelled but did not think it was: it might have had an S.P.C.K.\nlabel, but she could not say for sure. She gave a small drawing of\nthe parcel, which would not appear in itself to suggest the nature of\nthe contents. There is, however, one point in her letter which may\npossibly suggest a reason why the purchase of Communion wine\nshould have been in Dr Hunkin's mind at the time of his dream.\nIt is that over the weekend there had been an Ordination Retreat,\nand Miss Wheeler and Dr Hunkin had prepared the Chapel late\non the Friday evening for a celebration on the Saturday morning\nand had had a short hunt for the bottle of wine.\nDr Hunkin says nothing on the important question whether he\nfrequently had dreams that impressed him so much as to cause him\nto repeat them to members of his household. On this point a\nquestion was addressed to Miss Wheeler who replied on 5 Decem-\nber as follows:\nI am sorry for the delay in answering your letter of 26th November. I\nwanted to consult Mrs Hunkin before making any statement about the\nBishop's dreams. I think I had better quote her letter to me. My\nimpression was that the Bishop did dream a good deal, but that they\nwere generally of a rather vague nature. Mrs Hunkin says: '\nRegarding\nthe Bishop's dreams, you are right in saying they were generally vague.\n\f47\u00b0 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nBut now and again he would relate a vivid one in detail. But I never\nremember any other which was fulfilled. He would tell me a dream like\nthat sometimes when he first woke, but it was only occasional.' I\nshould say this was an exceptional dream, both as regards the unusual\nsubject and the detail remembered in it.\nIt would appear, therefore, that the dream was an exceptional\nincident, that nothing had happened of a kind likely to prompt it\nby normal association of ideas, and that the receipt of the sample\nbottle was also an unusual incident. Curious as the correspondence\nis, it should be noted that it is not precise, as in the dream the price\nquoted for a small bottle was 7s. 6d., whereas the note accom-\npanying the sample bottle quoted 7s. 6d. as the price for a full-\nsized one. Moreover, the receipt of the parcel by post did not\ncorrespond to the dream-incident of Dr Hunkin going to purchase\na bottle in a shop. When, however, due allowance is made for the\nusual degree of distortion met with in dreams, it must be admitted\nthat the correspondence between an unusual dream and an\nunusual event was rather striking.\nCase No. 2\nThe second case is of a dream of the arrival by post of a book,\nwhich was, unexpectedly, delivered by the postman the following\nmorning. It was reported to the Society by the percipient, Mr\nJ. E. Taylor, of Nottingham, in the following letter:\nThe other night I experienced a prophetic dream which was so vivid\nand so soon fulfilled that I thought it might interest your Society. I\nam a schoolmaster and have not, previously, taken any great interest in\npsychical phenomena but at College I remember reading G. N. M.\nTyrrell's book, The Personality of Man in which he asked that all cases,\nhowever trivial, might be submitted to your Society.\nI must first explain that in May 1950 I enrolled for a course by\ncorrespondence and ordered the set books from the University Book\nCo. Ltd. of London. One book, a short history of the Roman Empire,\nwas out of stock and the book company promised to send it when it\nbecame available. I had forgotten all about this book as, owing to a\nrecent illness caused through overwork, I was forced to suspend the\ncourse and so no longer required the book.\nOn Thursday evening, November 30th, my wife and I attended a\nfunction of my local R.A.F. Association and after several weeks en-\nforced temperance the few drinks I had affected me more than usual.\nThis fact is relevant, for a slight attack of illness caused me to rise at 5\na.m., so fixing the time of my dream as being between my return to bed\nat 5.15 and 7.0 a.m. when I woke.\nI dreamed that I got up feeling ill from a '\nhangover ' and heard a\nscuffling at the front door. I went into the hall and saw a huge pile of\n\fTwo '\nArrival '\nCases 471\nassorted magazines being pushed througri the letter box and beneath the\ndoor. I thought the two temporary postmen had made a mistake and\ndehvered the mail for the whole street to our house. Then came a knock\nat the door. I thought, '\nThe postman has come back to explain his\nmistake.' But no, the postman handed me a rectangular parcel, sewn\nup in a crimson cloth. I tore open the cloth and discovered the book\nfrom the Univ. Book Co. and a bill for the amount due.\nAn incongruous point was that although our hall opens directly on\nto the street, in my dream the postman came through a front gate and\nalong a path through a garden to our front door.\nWhen I woke up I told my wife of this vivid dream and remarked,\n'\nI'd forgotten about that book. I ought to write and tell them to\ncancel it otherwise they'll be sending it one of these days.' When I\nwent downstairs I did experience a hangover and halfway through\nbreakfast a knock came at the door. My wife answered it and came\nback into the room with a brown paper parcel. I opened it and there\nwas the book from the Univ. Book Co. and the bill.\nThis coincidence, if coincidence it was, was so strange as to give me\nquite a sense of shock. It is important, I think, to notice that I told my\nwife of the dream before it was, in part, fulfilled.\nI hope this minor experience might prove of some value for the\npurpose of your records.\n2 December 1950 (Sgd) J. E. Taylor\n1 declare that my part in the events stated above occurred exactly as my\nhusband has related.\n2 December 1950 (Sgd) W. J. Taylor\nIn view of the possibility that the connexion between the dream\nand the arrival of the book was fortuitous, the Hon. Secretary\nwrote as follows:\nMay I then enquire whether you are a frequent dreamer, and, secondly\nwhether there was anything either in the degree of vividness of this\nparticular dream or its nature, which made it appear to you exceptional\nat the time. Then as to the correspondence between the dream and the\narrival of the book, can you suggest any reason why in the dream the\nbook should have been preceded by a large number of magazines, and the\npostman should have approached your front door by a path through a\ngarden which you knew was not there. Also, can you remember\nwhether the dream book corresponded in colour, size, and general\nappearance with the real book, and whether the dream bill stated the\nprice correctly? It is probable, however, that you already knew what\nthe cost of the book would be. Although there had been a considerable\nlapse of time between your ordering this book and its arrival by post, it\nmay be that you fairly often have received other books by post, so that\nthere would be no very great significance in the dream of the arrival of\nan expected book occurring shortly before some book or other actually\ndid arrive.\nMr Taylor replied as follows:\n\f472 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nI am a fairly frequent dreamer but my dreams are usually of a different J\ntype. I usually start olf by reading a book and then I become personally |\nmerged in the story and undergo fantastic adventures. I have tried\n'\nwriting some of these dreams down immediately on awaking but they \\\nmake queer reading. The dream I have relate d to you was much more\nprosaic and intensely vivid.\nWith regard to the incident of the magazines and the non-existent\ngarden, I believe these were some form of wish fulfilment. We live i\nin a house without a garden, due to the present housing position, and\nour dearest wish is to buy a house with a garden. I am a great reader\nand a pile of crisp new magazines is a pleasant sight to me.\n|\nIn my dream the book was of the same colour, grey, and size as the '\nreal book. I cannot remember seeing the price on the bill. I just '\nknew it was the bill. I cannot account for the fact that the book was\nsewn up in red cloth in my dream. I have never received such a parcel. ,\nThe real book was in a brown paper parcel.\nI receive books by post perhaps three or four times a year but this\nparticular book was not expected. I had forgotten all about it. It was\nthe dream that recalled its existence to my mind and caused me to |\nmention to my wife that I ought to write and cancel it, but of course it\narrived the next morning.\n{Sgd) J. E.

Both are collections of essays and papers among which\nsome are concerned with topics of psychical research.\nDr H. G. Bayens, who died in 1943, was the chief exponent of\nJung in this country and the present volume contains most of his\nshorter papers together with the first three chapters of an un-\nfinished book. The two papers directly concerned with psychical\nresearch will already be known to members of the Society for\nPsychical Research. 'The Ghost as a Psychic Phenomenon '\nwas read at a private meeting of the society in 1936. '\nJung's Con-\n\f195 1 ] Reviews 473\nception of the Structure of Personality in relation to Psychical\nResearch '\nwas published in the Society's Proceedings in 1941.\nThe author's interest in psychical research is also reflected, in some\nmeasure, in the essay from which the volume takes its name.\n'\nAnalytical Psychology and the English Mind '\nis an entertaining\nstudy of our national character as this character appears when cast\ninto a Jungian mould. The English people are '\npeculiar ', he\nsays, in possessing an extraverted psychology complicated by the\ninfluence of an introverted minority voice. Their national myth\nhas found expression in the '\nidea of a gentleman '. True, the\nLatin word gentilis had acquired even in ancient Rome something\nof the same connotation of '\nderivation from good stock '. True,\ntoo, that the idea has affinities with others all over the world,\neven with the ancestor-worship of the Chinese; but the special\ncharacter with which the English temperament has invested the\nidea of a gentleman comes '\nwithout doubt '\n{sic) from the legends\nof King Arthur and his knights. The Arthurian '\nprinciple of fair\nplay ', it is said, pervades every aspect of our life. The gentle-\nmanly code of the public schools and the Universities is based\n'\nsolely '\n[sic) on this principle.\nCharacteristics of English life that cannot be so explained spring\nfrom the '\nintroverted interior '. Hence, side by side with con-\nventionality is the readiness to welcome new ideas, e.g. the psy-\nchology of Jung. To this element in our nature\u2014or is it perhaps\nthe ancestor-worship element?\u2014must be attributed our partiality\nto ghosts, and our benign attitude to the S.P.R. '\nIn no other\ncivilized country are there so many haunted houses to be found.'\nIn no other literature is there so large a place found for the '\ndi-\nmension of the unconscious '. And so on.\n'Well, well!' the hard-headed, extraverted Briton may say.\n'\nAll this may indeed be true, but the author hardly sets out the\nevidence that such is in fact the case.' To which, of course, the\nintroverted minority voice may well reply: '\nWhy, indeed, should\nhe? Someone must excogitate hypotheses for other people to\ntest.' These two comments would be equally appropriate for all\nthe other essays in this book. All are equally provocative to those\nwho ask for evidence; all are equally exciting to those who get on\nwell enough without it.\nNor, in Freud's papers, is it always easy to distinguish specula-\ntion from supporting fact. But it is not possible to generalize\nabout the essays in this book. This fifth volume of the Collected\nPapers consists of odds and ends\u2014mainly the shorter writings\npublished since 1925 and miscellaneous papers excluded '\nfor\nvarious reasons '\nfrom the earlier volumes.\nThe essay of chief interest for psychical research is that on '\nThe\n\f474 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY i)i\nOccult Significance of Dreams in which Freud extracts from 1^\nevidence against precognition evidence \/or telepathy. Briefly the\nargument is that the fortune-teller's prediction expresses what the '\nsitter desires, unwittingly obtaining the knowledge of these ^\ndesires by telepathic means. Freud believes that thought trans- '\njj\nference occurs most easily when the idea is in transition from the |^\nunconscious to the conscious mind. He suggests further that j\ntelepathic messages unconsciously received during the day may ,\n^\ncome into consciousness in dreams that occur during the following ,\n^\nnight. Through psycho-analysis it may accordingly be possible j jj\nto obtain further and better authenticated knowledge of this tele- i\njj\npathic process. From these two books alone it is not possible ;\nj,\nfairly to assess the relative contributions of Jungian and Freudian j jj,\npsychology to the progress of psychical research. On a first im- j j,\npression it might be tempting to suppose that the Jungian position\nis more sympathetic than the Freudian to the aims and tentative ;\n^\nconclusions of research in this field. When, however, it comes to a | |j\nclear-cut issue, as for example the question of survival after death, j|,\nthe disciple of Jung is no less non-committal than the disciple of jj\nFreud. No statement could be more non-committal than that of\nDr Baynes. '\nWe cannot determine whether the spirit world is an\naspect of the impersonal psyche or whether it exists independently, jj\nIt is practically impossible to decide whether the spirits of the dead |jj\nexist independently of the psyche or whether they live because we\ngive them life.'\n\\\nOf greater interest than the question of commitments is the ,\ndiff^erence between the two schools in their attitudes to scientific\n'\nmethod. The Jungian is much less deferential than the Freudian\nto the authority of science, and proportionately more sympathetic\nto the claims of '\nintuition '. In this respect Freud himself was I\nwas almost oldfashioned. These differences, however, do not '\n\u00bb'\ncarry the implication that psychical research has more to hope il\nfrom Jung than it has from Freud. The implications, such as they ;\nare, work the other way. Nothing is more striking in the recent !\n'I\ndevelopment of psychical research than the increasing rigour of its T\nscientific methods. Those who pursue this research challenge the ii\nnatural scientist on his own ground. They claim no privilege and j\nP\nthey ask for no quarter. If a choice had to be made between ;\nmysticism and logic, Freud and the modern psychical researcher i\nwould, without question, find themselves down on the same side I\nP\nof the fence. If there is any difference between them it might even j\nfl\nbe that modern psychical research is in fact the more exacting in its i\nt\ndemands for scientific proof. c\nC. A. Mace i\n\f1951] Reviews 475\ni I Appeal unto Caesar (The Scripts of Cleophas). By Geraldine\nCummins. London, Psychic Press, 1950. 189 pp. los. 6d.\nThis further instalment of the Scripts of Cleophas needs only a\nbrief notice. In character it closely resembles its predecessors, and\nas a reconstruction of certain incidents in St Paul's life and of the\nlast days of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, is not without a certain\nvividness of presentation. This might be expected, since,\nwhatever be the source of the material, it has come through the\nmental processes of Miss Cummins, who is an accomplished\nnovelist. The difficulty in making any scientific use of such\nautomatic scripts as these is obvious. Even if they do contain\n- traces of genuine historical evidence it is quite impossible to\nidentify or verify them. In some respects, as in the use of such\nnames as Adaiam and Tyrronnis, the records do not sound very\nprobable. And where they do agree with modern discoveries of one\nsort or another it is impossible to say whether Miss Cummins may\n'\nhave had access at some time to those discoveries, either directly or\nI through the mind of Miss Gibbes or of some other person. To\nI say this is not to deny her complete sincerity as an automatist.\nBut whether as history or as material for the study of automatic\nwriting the scripts have no value. Their interest, which is real\nenough, is simply that of a historical novel, and as such (and, it is to\nbe hoped, only as such) they will be enjoyed by many.\nI L. W.

Secretary's Review of the Year\nBy the time of the next Annual Meeting, in 1952, this Society will\nhave completed three score years and ten, having had a much longer\nperiod of unbroken activity than any other Society formed for similar\npurposes. In view of this fact, and of the recent changes in the Society's\norganization, it might be well that we should devote a little time this\nafternoon to a general stocktaking. If you will allow me, I will in pro-\nposing the adoption of the Annual Report of the Council advert briefly\nto some points which I think it is desirable for our members to bear in\nmind, taking as my text the name of the Society, the Society for\nPsychical Research.\n\fii Siippleme7it to Journal, July-August 1951\nI will deal first with the last word, '\nResearch '. This Society con-\nducts many activities, holding meetings, issuing publications of many\nkinds, and maintaining a Library. All these things are useful in them-\nselves, but their value should be judged according to the contribution\nthey make to our research. We are, I think, all agreed that our founders\nwere right in laying down the principle that we should approach our\nproblems objectively and '\nwithout prejudice or prepossession of any\nkind '. There have indeed from time to time been movements in the\nSociety, the effect, if not the object, of which would have been, had they\nsucceeded, to make the Society no longer a Society for research but one\nholding definite opinions and doctrines regarding the subject matter of\nour investigation. I think that it is now generally recognized among our\nmembers that a move in that direction would be a mistake.\nI now turn to what is perhaps a more difficult and debateable question,\nthe meaning of Psychical research. Our founders very wisely did not\nattempt any exact definition, and in fact pursued a very large number\nof lines of inquiry which it might have been difficult to reduce to any\nlogical formula. The danger seventy years ago may have been one\nof too great dispersal of effort. But too great concentration on any one\nbranch of our subject may have dangers of its own. We may congratu-\nlate ourselves that we have been able to avoid this. In psychical re-\nsearch\u2014as, I think, in philosophy and psychology\u2014particular problems\nhave a way of forcing themselves on the attention of inquirers for a time,\nand then falling into the background, so that the vital issues of one\ngeneration seem of very remote interest to the next. The same thing\ncan be traced in the history of psychical research, as may be seen if the\namount of space devoted in our Proceedings in any decade to one side of\nour subject be compared with the amount given in the next. There was,\nfor example, a period during which the energies of the best minds within\nthe Society were devoted to the elucidation of automatic writing, and\na corresponding amount of space in the Proceedings was devoted to\ntheir labours. Between the wars a very great deal of skilled energy,\nprinting space, and money was expended in the investigation of physical\nphenomena. In the last year or two before the War our main attention\nbecame focussed on quantitative experiments in ESP, and is still so\ncentred. I think this periodical change of interest is unavoidable,\nbecause in each case the phenomena raised problems which required\nthorough investigation and discussion. Although, however, the main\ninterest was directed now to this and now to that branch of our studies,\ninquiries on other lines were going on concurrently. Speaking for\nmyself, I feel sure that it would be a most mistaken policy if we were\nto abandon or to relegate to a subordinate position those traditional\nlines of investigation which do not happen at the moment to be in the\nfashion, because I believe that there is a very difficult problem of human\npersonality involved, and that if there is any practicable solution of it, it\nwill only be achieved by attacking it from a great number of different\npoints at once. We all admire the notable successes which have been\nachieved in parapsychology by Professor Rhine and the other members\nof his staff whom we had the pleasure of meeting in England last\nsummer, but parapsychology, as hitherto understood in America, seems\n\fSupplement to Journal, July-August 195 1 in\nto be a very much narrower affair than psychical research, and it is to\npsychical research that we as a Society are committed.\nAnd we are a Society, not a University department. In a University\nit is possible for the Head of a Faculty to direct his staff to conduct\ninvestigations along particular lines, and to exercise a close supervision\nover the work they are doing. This has never been attempted in our\nSociety, and in view of the very wide scope of our investigations it would\nbe hopeless to attempt it. Our members have always been encouraged\nto pursue whatever lines of research make a special appeal to them, and\nthey are at liberty, if they so desire, to get advice and assistance from\nfellow members, including of course the Officers of the Society.\nAs a result of our having no organic connexion with any University\nor other official body, and being as we are dependent largely on the\nsubscriptions of members, we find it both desirable and necessary to\ndeal by correspondence and interview with a large number of inquiries\nand suggestions from within and outside the Society that would not\nprobably come our way if we were a University department. Those\nwho have worked for any length of time in the Society's offices would, I\nthink, agree that they have learnt a great deal from these letters and\ninterviews, but at the same time they absorb a great deal of the Officers'\ntime, frequently with little to show for it. We must, however, look at it\nfrom the point of view of the persons who write to the Society or seek\nan interview with one of the Officers. They are often persons in a\nstate of bewilderment, and sometimes distress, as the result of ' psychic\n'\nexperiences that have befallen them. It is no unworthy task, I think, to\ngive these people such help as we can, help that they will certainly not\nget in as enlightened and disinterested a way from any other quarter.\nLittle by little each letter, each interview, helps to spread among a\npublic lamentably ill-informed on these matters a more sensible and\nmore scientific view of psychical research. Ultimately, therefore, and\nin a most roundabout way all this does promote research: it brings us in\nnew members, it brings us in new contacts with psychic phenomena of\nevery kind.\nThe problem which has always faced the Society is how best to com.-\nbine two objects. First, the general day-to-day business of the Society,\nincluding all this business of contacts with members and the public\nwhich I have already mentioned, and (2) the more technical side of our\nresearch. A governing factor is, of course, the financial position of the\nSociety. For the last twenty years and more the Society, as is natural in\na body dependent almost entirely on the support of the professional\nclasses, has been in difficulties. In almost every Annual Report that I\nhave drafted during those years I have used the phrase '\nfinancial\nstringency ', or I have with difficulty restrained myself from doing so.\nCertainly a year ago things were pretty bad, and we had an excess of\nexpenditure over income amounting to ^Sl^- During the present year\nthings have taken a much more hopeful turn, and although the last\nthing the Council desire would be to encourage undue optimism, they\ncan point with pride to the fact that they have this year achieved a\nsurplus of some \u00a36i\\S> of receipts over expenditure. The principal\ncauses of this are set out in paragraph six of the Annual Report. I may\n\fiv Supplement to Journal, July-August\nremind you that the Society has not during the year had a salaried\nResearch Officer. Dr West has obtained an appointment at the\nMaudsley Hospital, and we all wish him the greatest possible success in\nhis profession. He will still reside on the Society's premises and be\nable to give time to psychical research. Then we have been enjoying\nfor a second year the fruits of the Appeal which drew such a generous\nresponse from our membership: we earnestly hope that this help will\nbe continued. Lastly I would mention the lapse of the pension of 175\npaid to Miss Newton during her life.\nSome re-organization both of the general work and of the research\nhas become necessary, and members will like to know what arrange-\nments have been made. As mentioned in the Annual Report for 1949,\nthe Council were able to persuade Mrs Goldney to undertake the post\nof Organizing Secretary, and the successful conduct of the Society's\nbusiness during the recent year has been in a large measure due to the\nenergy and efficiency which she has brought to her task and to the very\nfriendly collaboration between herself and our Secretary, Miss Horsell.\nShe has been able to deal successfully with a very large number of matters\ncropping up from time to time to which it would have been extremely\ndifficult for any of the other Officers of the Society to give adequate\nattention. Grateful mention should also be made of the very great 1\namount of work that has been put in by Mrs Gay, who has been\nin constant attendance at the Rooms. She has been particularly\nhelpful in bringing order into the past research records of the Society,\nwhich owing to war conditions had fallen into great confusion. Under\nthe joint efforts of Miss Horsell, Mrs Goldney, and Mrs Gay I have no\nhesitation in saying that the business of the office is being more effi-\nciently run than it has been for many years past. But it should be\nborne in mind that our office staff now consists of one full-time and one\npart-time Secretary. If we could afford a staff of three full-time workers,\nwe could probably find plenty of work for them to do.\nAnother Officer to whom the Society owes an incalculable debt is\nEdward Osborn, who in addition to completely revolutionizing the\nJournal, which has now become a most valuable instrument of publicity\nto the Society, was the mainspring in organizing the recent Appeal,\nwhich saved the situation financially. Few of our members, unless they\nare themselves working in the office, know the enormous amount of\ntime that Mr Osborn has unstintingly given to the Society.\nBut it still remained for the Council to see that research of the kind\nrequiring specialized knowledge was being vigorously pursued. In the\nCouncil's view the best way of securing this was to make awards for\nuseful pieces of research, and to invite applications for grants to help\nin carrying out research projects that seemed to be sufficiently promising.\nIt is hoped that many well-thought-out projects will be submitted to the\nCouncil in response to the invitation already made.\nBy re-organization within the office and the offer of grants and awards\nthe Council consider that an active research policy should be practicable.\nBut they wish to urge on the younger members of the Society the de-\nsirability of making themselves experts in one or more of the various\ntechniques that are becoming more and more necessary in psychical\n\fSupplement to Journal, July-August 195 1 v\nresearch. Although our membership is increasing, we still have far too\nfew workers with specialized knowledge. In this connexion I must\nrefer to the loss the Society is about to sustain by the departure for\nAmerica of one of our most active workers, Mr Fraser Nicol. He has\naccepted a post in the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University,\nso that the loss to the Society will mean no loss, but rather a gain, to\npsychical research. We wish him every success and happiness in his\nnew home and new career.\nTo return to finance, the improvement in the position will certainly\nnot encourage extravagance on the part of the Council. It is desirable,\nand should be possible, to increase the amount allocated for printing.\nOur pubhcations are the only immediate benefit that a large proportion\nof our membership derive from their subscriptions, but they should\nbear in mind that every page of Proceedings or Journal now costs over\n\u00a32 3s. 6d. a page to print (exclusive of any diagrams or illustrations).\nThe Society may in a few years' time be faced with heavy expense, as\nin 1956 our existing lease runs out. The freehold has been acquired\nby London University, and there is a considerable chance that the\nbuilding may be needed for University purposes. In that case the\nSociety would have to find premises elsewhere and meet the costs of\nremoval.\nDuring the past year the Society has received some generous legacies,\nand it is to be hoped that members will not lose sight of the Society's\nneed for help in this form. Legacies are now being kept separate in the\naccounts from current receipts and current expenditure, a procedure\nwhich enables members to appreciate more easily what the Society's\nfinancial position is. The Council intend to use the funds standing in\nthe separate account as a nest egg on which they can draw for special\nexpenditure which could not easily be met from current income.\nTo end with a few cheerful remarks, Mr Parsons has arranged for us\na fuller programme of interesting meetings than we have ever had\nbefore. There is a very marked increase in the public interest in\npsychical research and in the Society, as shown by references in books,\nnewspapers, etc., and, most significant, the Royal Institution last\nDecember invited Dr Thouless to deliver a discourse on '\nThought-\ntransference and Related Phenomena '. This is the first paper on any\nsubject connected with psychical research ever read to the Institution\nsince its foundation in 1799. Finally, for the first time for many years,\nwe have a membership of over 1,000, which is still steadily increasing.\nTHE SOCIETY'S ROOMS\nThis year the rooms, including the Library, will not be closed\nduring the summer.\nMEETINGS OF THE COUNCIL\nMeetings of the Council were held as follows:\n464th 16 March 195 1 Chairman : The President, Dr S.

R. Smythies, m.b., b.chir.\nSUMMARY\nThe resuhs of the recent experiments in parapsychology cannot be\nfitted into any current scientific theory. This suggests that the funda-\nmental assumptions, on which natural science is based, should be\nreconsidered and possibly revised. The aim of this paper is to examine\nsome of these fundamental assumptions, and to suggest a series of\nalternative assumptions which give a more coherent account of the\nuniverse and the place of the conscious mind in it. We can then account\nsatisfactorily for the facts of parapsychology.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nI should like in this paper^ to examine the implications of the\npresent experimental position in parapsychology for the main body\nof natural science. The following important fact has been\nestablished by experiment:\nThe mind is able to abstract information from its present and\nfuture environment without the use of any of the recognized\nchannels of sense.\nWe must correlate this fact with the theory at present held in\nnatural science of the nature of the mind and its relation to the brain.\nIf this cannot be done we must introduce a new theory which can\naccount for this fact. The former course would necessitate the\nconstruction of some form of '\nradiation '\ntheory. No one has yet\nsucceeded in this, nor does it seem possible for the following\nreasons:\n^ Dr Smythies has recently completed a study in which he suggests that\na number of fundamental changes should be made in the basic pre-\nsuppositions of natural science in order to account for the genesis of\nperceptual space and the facts of parapsychology. These changes are\nexpressed in a new theor>', an outline of which he has kindly written for\nthis Joumal.^\n\u2014\nEd.\n477\n\f478 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\n(a) It seems unlikely that any simple electro-magnetic radiation\ncould convey complex information through dura mater, bone, and\nscalp and up to two hundred miles of space without there being\nany apparent organization concerned with this function. Any\npenetrating radiation of this type would have to be of the X-ray\nor wireless wave frequency, whose energy requirements would seem\nto be beyond the capacity of the brain. Nothing resembling\ntransmitting apparatus has been found in the brain.\nThe implication of the current theory, as presented by Gilbert\nRyle,^ J. Z. Young,'\u2022^\nand others, is that the mind bears the same\nrelation to the brain as the digestion does to the viscera\u2014no more\nand no less. The brain is supposed to function according to the\nsame principles as analogue and digital computing machines.\nAccording to this theory a thought is an extremely complex pattern\nof electrons in the brain, and human thinking and perceiving are\ndone entirely by the almost fabulously complex system of inter-\nconnected nerve cells and fibres which sustain and conduct these\npatterns. There seems to be no room in the brain for a mechanism\nwhich would have to do the following things :\nIt would have to scan the incoming electronic patterns carrying\nthe sense data from the sensory nerves, and transform these into a\nsignal code in the form of penetrating radiation. There would also\nhave to be a separate mechanism for receiving such information and\nfor translating it back into the form of circulating impulse patterns.\nFor the operation of clairvoyance, this mechanism must further be\ncapable of abstracting information from outside objects, which\nwould require quite different apparatus. There would have to be a\ndevice for feeding this extrasensory information into the main\ncurrent of information, and, it seems, a mechanism for active censor-\nship so that only a certain number of extrasensory hits are obtained.\nIt would seem in a successful ESP experiment, where a significant\nnumber of these complex patterns are altered in a highly specific\nway, that there should be a great deal of such organization to do\nthese highly complex things, such as abstracting information from\na pack of ESP cards or from someone else's brain. There does\nnot seem to be any trace of these mechanisms in the brain. It\ndoes not seem possible to attribute these phenomena to any\nprimitive property of matter, or protoplasm, in view of the\nextremely complex nature of the process involved in changing, for\ninstance, a series of cortical patterns ABCDEF to ABDDDF.\nAlthough ESP has only been demonstrated as a statistical effect,\n^ The Concept of Mind (London, Hutchinson's University Library,\n1949)-\n^ Doubt and Certainty in Science (London, Oxford University Press,\n1951)-\n\fig^i] The Extension of Mind 479\nnevertheless the change from C to D and E to D represents a\nchange from one unique cortical pattern to another unique pattern,\nand not to any of the other enormous number of possible patterns.\nThus it would seem that we are looking for the organization\nnecessary to execute these functions.\n{b) No known form of radiation extends into the future and\nthere is no place in natural science for the demonstrated determi-\nnation of a present event by a future event. This point alone is\ncrucial.\nTherefore we must seriously consider our second course; a\ncritical examination of the whole system of pre-suppositions and\npostulates from which science builds. ^ Since natural science is able\nto give such a coherent and inclusive account of phenomena inside\nthe physical space-time continuum, any radical changes here do\nnot seem feasible, and we must look outside these bounds for any\npossible advances in knowledge.\n2. THE CRISIS IN KNOWLEDGE\nThe crisis in human knowledge caused by the discoveries of\nparapsychology affects not only psychology, neurophysiology,\nphilosophy, and metaphysics, but also, and most profoundly,\nphysics itself. This is because the same fundamental assumptions\nlie at the basis of each of these systems of inquiry. The present\nposition of scientific knowledge rests on a tangled and inter-\nconnected series of such assumptions and theories, which lead\nfrom one field of study into another. Confusion is caused by the\nuse of the words and concepts of '\nspace ', '\nmind ', and '\npsyche '.\nThese words have several different meanings, and the confusion\narises when deductions are drawn from their use in one context,\nwhen one of the other meanings of the words is really intended.\nWe will also discover, in all these subjects, the ramifications of\nan entirely erroneous theory, derived from our common-sense\noutlook upon the world. I will call this the '\ntransparent nervous\nsystem '\ntheory (or TN S theory for short). It is that the Self, the\nobserver, is looking out directly at the physical world extended in\nspace and time before it, through the sense organs, as though these\n^\nAs Margaret Knight suggests may be necessary in her article '\nTheo-\nretical Implications of Telepathy' in Science Neivs, No. 18. Professor\nBroad has called for '\nvery radical changes in a number of our basic\nlimiting principles '\n(' The Relevance of Psychical Research to Philo-\nsophy ', Philosophy, vol. 24, 1949, p. 306). Dr Thouless has suggested a\nradical re-orientation of thought (' Expeimental Precognition and its\nImplications \\y. Soc. Psychic. Res., vol. 35, 1950, p. 209).\n\f480 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\nwere transparent. The familiar world of perception is thus\nsupposed to be a direct view of the physical world. The error is\naided by our erroneous identification of the familiar body-image^ in\nconsciousness, with the physical body itself.\nThe following passages from E. L. Hutton ^ are very relevant\n:\n'\nThe part played by the body in our perception of the external\nworld is of the greatest importance, and is much neglected by realist\nphilosophers.'^ The author feels that not only has it been neglected by\nthe realist school of philosophy but by all philosophers, and that this\nneglect is responsible for many of the difficulties and inconsistencies of\nboth realists and idealists.\nFirst and foremost it is important to draw attention to the fact that a\npercipient's awareness of his own body is, like his awareness of other\nobjects, based upon the occurrence of temporo-spatial patterns in his\nown cerebral cortex. . . .\n(pp. 154-5).\nThe difficulty of both realists and idealists seems to arise from a\nconfusion of the perceived body with the percipient's actual body.\nBecause of the experienced dependency of all perceived objects upon the\nperceived state of the percipient's body the ability to perceive them is\nlocated within this perceived body, and the mind is thought of as being\nlocated within this perceived skull ; but what is often forgotten is that\nthis body and this skull are themselves objects of perception.\nNow not only am I aware of my own body but also of other bodies\nsimilar to mine, and spatially related to my body, to each other, and to\nall other objects within my perceptual field. ... (p. 156. My italics).\nNow a scientist is a sentient individual, and as such may observe or be\nobserved by other sentient beings, and what applies to them applies\nequally to him. His researches are directed towards a limited number of\nobjects and events selected out of the total field of which he is perceptu-\nally aware, and this limitation of his interest is designated by his\nscientific title, geologist, physicist, biologist, anthropologist, etc. The\nobjects of his study are brought by means of attention into the fore-\nground of his consciousness, and as far as possible isolated and studied\nin detachment from the objects constituting the background of the field,\nincluding his own body. For reasons already stated many scientists are\nmisled into believing that the objects and events they are studying have\na real existence independently of them, whereas in fact, as we are\nlearning from neurophysiology, these objects and events are only\n' The meaning I convey by the phrase '\nbody-image '\nis conveyed by\nsome people by the phrase '\nimmanent perceived body '. I am postulating\nthree spatially distinct entities : {a) the physical body (b) the body-image in\nthe brain, and (c) the body-itnage in consciousness or immanent perceived body.\nWhen I use the phrase '\nbody-image '\nby itself I refer to (c).\n^\n' The Relationship of Mind and Matter to Personality ' in D.\nRichter (ed.). Perspectives in Neuropsychiatry (London, H. K. Lewis,\n1950) pp. 141-72.\n' From W. Russell Brain in Philosophy, vol. 21 (1946) no. 133.\n\f195 1] The Extension of Mind 481\ndetermined by things existing independently, their actual nature\ndepending entirely^ on the temporo-spatial patterns occurring in the\nscientists' own cerebral cortices. They are actually but unwittingly\nstudying the effects of the dynamic activity which is occurring each in\nhis own central nervous system, and the observed '\nlaws of nature '\nare\nthe observed sequences in their own perceptual field. If similar\ncortical patterns are aroused in several individuals, either by a common\nstimulus or by separate but similar stimuli, they will all observe similar\nsequences in their perceptual field, and they will all deduce the same\n'\nlaws of nature '. They can be observed, both by themselves and by\nother sentient individuals, performing similar experiments, using\nsimilar measuring devices, and describing their work in similar phrase-\nology. None the less, and it cannot be too strongly stressed, each man\nis studying what he himself perceives, and what he perceives depends\ndirectly upon his own cortical activity ; the objects of his study have\ntheir existence only in him (pp. 159-60).\nNot only are many scientists thus misled, but the whole structure\nof physical and biological science rests on assumptions arising out\nof this error. Not only do the objects and events the scientist is\nobserving depend upon the temporo-spatial patterns occurring in\nhis own cerebral cortex, but the perceptual space-system, in which\nthey are extended, and in which they are spatially related to his\nperceived body, is the space-time system of his ?nind.\nA useful working concept to use during this argument is that we\nare each connected to the physical world by an extensive signalling\nmechanism. At one end this is connected to various sense-organs\non the surface of and inside the body. The other end we experience\nas our familiar visual picture of the world, its sounds, and its\nsmells, and the signals from our body which we experience as our\nbody-image in consciousness with its pressures, aches, and pains.\nChanges in these sense organs, produced by various physical\nstimuli, are swiftly signalled via the sensory nerves and central\nnervous system into our perceptual fields. We must note that we\nare given (as data) the Self, examining its own private world,\nwhose events are merely determined by events in the outside\nphysical world (including the physical body), by the signalling\nmechanism in between. Science has traced this signalling\nmechanism as far as the brain, but, as Margaret Knight says in her\nrecent article :\nEven the strictest adherent of epiphenomenalism admits that there is a\n^ There is no justification for the use of this word entirely. The\nauthor's identification of perceptual space with the spatial organization of\nthe brain is merely an assumption. All that neurophysiology shows us is\nthat we cannot identify objects as observed with the physical objects\nthemselves. It does not show us that we must identify them with these\npatterns in the brain.\u2014J.R.S.\n\f482 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\ncomplete gap in our knowledge at one point. We now know a great\ndeal about the mechanics of sense-perception. We know, for example,\nthat when we hear a noise, a sound-wave has affected our ear-drum, and\nset up a chain of activities in the middle and inner ear, in the auditory\nnerve, and finally in the cerebral cortex. But how electro-chemical\nactivity in the cortex can give rise to the conscious experience of hearing \u2022\na bell, is still completely obscure. As James wrote in 1892, '\nsomething\n'\ndefinite happens when to a certain brain-state a certain \" sciousness\n\"\ncorresponds.'^\nSo we must further note that, while physical space-time is on\nthe distal side of this gap in our understanding of the signalling\nmechanism, perceptual space-time is indubitably on the proximal\nside, and is in part a creation of the '\nmind ', as we may call it at\npresent. This is not clearly recognized at present by theoretical\nphysics.\nI will return to the whole question of the extension of the mind\nlater when considering the current concepts of philosophy, but it\nwill suffice to mention here that both the theory that the mind does\nnot occupy space, and the theory that it is meaningless to discuss\nwhether the mind does or does not occupy space, are consequences\nof the T N S fallacy of common sense. The mind must be regarded\nas both clearly extended in part (the perceptual world) and\napparently not so extended (Self).\nThere is an important passage in Sherrington's Man on His\nNature. (My italics show where I disagree).\nAt the core of this difficulty is the attribute '\nunextended '\nas applied\nto the finite mind. It is difficult to reconcile this attribution with\ncertain facts. The mind of the individual, finite mind, as judged by an\nimpressive concensus of opinion, has '\nplace '. It has '\nwhereness '\n;\nnor does it viatter for our purpose of the moment what '\nwhere '\nit has. It\nhas a '\nwhere '. Speaking for myself, although I can allow dialectically\na Euclidean point and admit its artificiality to be a useful convention, it\nis beyond me to conceive or figure or imagine even approximately a\nconcrete anything as having '\nwhereness '\nwithout magnitude. A thing\nwithout extension as descriptive of the mind, even though negatively\ndescriptive, fails for me to be more than a conventional symbol. ...\nAccepting finite mind as having a '\nwhere '\nand that '\nwhere '\nwithin\nthe brain, we find that the energy-system with which we correlate the\nmind has of course extension and parts and exhibits, moreover, marked ;\nspatial organization of those of its parts correlating in space and time\nwith finite mind. . . . We have, I think, to accept that finite mind is in j\nextended space. ^ ;\nThe acceptance of finite mind having a '\nwhere '\ndoes not,\n' '\nTheoretical Implications of Telepathy '\nin Science News, No. 18.\n^ Sir Charles Sherrington, Man on His Nature (Cambridge University\nPress, 1940) pp. 314-15.\n\f1951] The Extension of Mind 483\nhowever, compel us to put that '\nwhere '\nin the brain, as both\nHutton and Sherrington suppose. We are only compelled to do so\nas long as we lack any '\nwhere '\nelse to put it.\n3. THE CRISIS IN PHYSICS\nIf we examine the concept of space we find five categories\nrecognized:\n(i) Perceptual space.\n(ii) Physical space.\n(iii) Absolute space (of Newton),\n(iv) Abstract space.\n(ivA) Higher-dimensional space.\nThese are taken from Jeans. ^ I have only altered his classification\nby extracting (ivA) out of (iv). If we further examine how these\nare supposed to differ from each other, and how they are derived,\nwe come across the first series of assumptions to be considered,\nand, furthermore, we find that the first of them is based on the TN S\ntheory. They are:\n(1) That perceptual space is coincident with all physical space.\n(2) That four axes are sufficient to describe the physical uni-\nverse, and all objects and events in it ; that the same four axes may\nbe used to describe the perceptual world, and all objects and events\nin it ; and that there is nothing outside these four axes, i.e. in\nhigher-dimensional space.\nIn order to illustrate how these assumptions lie at the basis of\ntheoretical physics, we may consider the suppositions made by\nEinstein in the Special Theory of Relativity. The following\npassages are taken from Relativity: the Special and the General\nTheory.\"^ The italics are mine throughout.\nThe practice, for example, of seeing in a '\ndistance '\ntwo marked positions\non a practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply iri our habit\nof thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as being\nsituated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to\ncoincide for observ^ation with one eye, under suitable choice of our\nplace of observation. ... (p. 3.)\nIt is not necessary here to investigate further the significance of the\nexpression '\ncoincidence in space '. This conception is sufficiently\nobvious to ensure that diffa'ences of opinion are scarcely likely to arise as to\nits applicability in practice, . . .

I should load my conscience with grave\nsins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the aims of\nmechanics in this way, without serious reflection and detailed explana-\ntions. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.\nIt is not clear what is to be understood here by '\nposition '\nand\n'\nspace '. I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is travelling\nuniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without throwing it.\nThen, disregarding the influence of the air resistance, \/ see the stone\ndescend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes the misdeed from\nthe footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in a parabolic curve.\n(P- 9-)\nIt is clearly being assumed here that the objects and events of\nthe physical world are being observed directly. The Special and\nGeneral theories of Relativity are, in part, attempts to correlate\nphysical and perceptual space.\n'\nEinstein supposed there to be a four-dimensional space-time\ncontinuum containing observers travelling through it. Each\nobserver is supposed to '\nsee '\nsuccessive cross-sections of the\ncontinuum as his private three dimensions of perceptual space in\ntime. Observers in relative motion to each other '\nsee '\ncross-\nsections cut in different directions. Thus all places^ in perceptual\nspace are supposed to be coincident w^ith places in physical space-\ntime. Perceptual space, in which it is necessary to emphasize all\nobservations of science are made, is treated as though it were a\nmoving cross-section of physical space-time, much as a traveller in\na train sees a thin cross-section of the countryside through which\nhe is travelling. As Jeans - says, '. . . all observers stand on the same\nfooting, each dividing the space-time unity into his own perceptual\nspace and his own perceptual time.' These suppositions overlook\nthe fact that there is a great deal of signalling mechanism interposed\nbetween objects in physical space-time and objects as observed in\nperceptual space, which mechanism is quite opaque. To imagine\nthat perceptual space and time can be derived by cutting a simple\ncross-section of physical space-time is to base our whole system on\nthe TNS fallacy. The objects which the scientist actually ob-\nserves, and the space in which they are observed, are a product of\nhis own mind. It follows that these observed objects and events\nmay be coincident in space with cerebral events, but certainly\ncannot be with the objects and events of the external physical\n^ In order to avoid confusion I must define '\nplace '\nas that space\noccupied by any object of any kind that can actually be observed, or that\nspace occupied by any object whose activity can potentially determine\nthe behaviour of the former object. This avoids confusion with abstract\nspace or with the concept of space.\n^ Sir James Jeans, Physics and Philosophy (Cambridge University Press,\n1943) p. 69. -\n\f195 1 The Extension of Mind 485\nworld, which only determine what is observed by means of the\nsignalling mechanism in between.\nThus we see that Einstein's statement that the nature of\ncoincidence in space is self-evident (see p. 483) is only apparently\nself-evident, if we are basing our habits of thought on the TNS\nfallacy. Coincidence in perceptual space is easy to understand\nthough subject to illusions, and we all know what is meant by\ncoincidence in physical space, though we have never actually\nobserved this. The problems are raised by considering what re-\nlation perceptual space bears to physical space.\nThe phrase '\ncoincident in space '\nhas many pitfalls of which\nscientists have in general been unaware. If the objects of the\nscientist's study have their existence only in him, then so do those\naxes, of which he can be aware and by which he describes their\nbehaviour, and so does the space system in which the objects of\nperception are extended, and in which these observations are\nexecuted. The realization of this fact requires a study of the\nrelationship between these observed events and the events in the\nphysical world. For this we need, if we are to account for the\nfacts of parapsychology, an extended theory of relativity, a theory\nof the relativity of extension; in short, a theory of extension.\nIf we now return to the concepts of space in use in contemporary\nphysics, we find that the observer, by his motion through the\nphysical space-time continuum, is supposed to see this directly as\nits three-dimensional perceptual cross-section. The abstract and\nabsolute spaces are supposed to be derived by reason's experience\nof the perceptual cross-section of physical space-time.\nThese concepts do not give an adequate account of what actually\nhappens. Perceptual space cannot be regarded as a simple cross-\nsection of physical space-time, as this depends on the TNS fallacy.\nPerceptual space is the only space of which we can have direct\nexperience. We live and move and have our being in it. We note\nthat objects as observed have three space dimensions and endure\nin time. If we confuse this perceived world with the physical\nworld, we jump to thinking we are looking at the physical world\ndirectly, which then is supposed to have the same three dimensions\nof space and one of time. But zee are no longer allozved to do this by\nneurophysiology. Physical space and physical objects are in fact\nhypotheses, as we can never observe them directly. We have\nhypothecated them out of our experience of perceived objects\nextended in perceptual space presented to us by this part of the\nmind. If we wish to correlate perceptual space with anything, we\ncan only attempt, as Sherrington^ does {if zee are to keep zvithin the\n^ See the passage quoted from Sherrington on p. 482.\n\f486 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\npresent boundaries of natural science), to correlate it with the spatial Ij\norganization of the brain, a physical object in physical space.\nIt should be noted that there are two categories of events in\nperceptual space : the events of the perceptual world over which\nthe Self has no control ; and the activities of what we call '\nvisual I\nor mental imagery ', which is under the control of the Self. This\nspace is also three-dimensional in time, as we are capable of\n'\nsketching in our imaginations '\nor '\nvisualizing '\nlines, planes, or\ncubes existing in time, but fail when we try to visualize a four-\ndimensional solid, the tesseract, in time. The fact that we can\ncope with cubes but not with tesseracts is not an indication that\nthe physical universe has three space dimensions, as is generally\nsupposed, but that our minds have. This internal space, which\ngeometers are always using in their practical problems, seems to be\ncoincident with the space in which the perceptual world is\npresented. For we can sketch any manner of lines round the\nobjects of our perception, as the artist does when he sketches the ,\noutlines of his picture on the canvas in his mind before he ever puts '\nbrush to canvas. This category of space has been rather neglected.\nIf the mind is supposed to be something unextended, how one is\nsupposed to be able to visualize a triangle, which cannot but be\nextended in space, I do not know.\nWe may recast the space systems given above thus :\n(i) Perceptual space, then, is primary, and is that in which\nobjects of our perception, including our own body-image and our\nown visual imagery, are extended.\n(ii) Physical space is that in which physical objects, including our\nown physical bodies, are extended. These latter are for ever un-\nobservable, and strictly are hypotheses in Dingle's sense. ^ The\nspace ofphysics is the mathematical system of extensional relation-\nships of physical objects. It is a postulate in Dingle's sense. These\nrelationships have been discovered by observations made by the\nSelf on the extensional relations of perceptual objects extended in\nperceptual space. For instance, all measurements of length in\nphysics depend ultimately and solely on the Self's direct power of\ntelling which of these two lines\nis the longer. These lines, it cannot be emphasized too often, are,\nas observed, extended in the perceptual space system of the mind.\nPhysics has been able to overlook these points and tacitly to assume\nthe TNS fallacy, because the observed relations reproduce their\ndetermining relations in the physical space-time continuum with\n^ See Herbert Dingle, Through Science to Philosophy (London, Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1937).\n\f195 1] ^^'^ Extension of Mind 487\nsufficient accuracy, by reason of the mechanical excellence of the\nintermediate signalling mechanism.\n(iii) Abstract space comprises also a series of postulates\nderived by reason from our experience, not of (ii) but of (i).\nAkhough it belongs to the class of concept and so is not extended in\nthe same way as (i), when the geometer does exercises in abstract\ngeometry^ in his '\nmind ', he is using this internal space system\ndescribed above (part of (i)).\nThe location of perceptual space within the brain is also only an\nassumption. The strength of this assumption arises from the\nobsen\/ed facts that when we do certain things to other peoples'\nbrains, and when certain things happen to our own brains, the state\nof consciousness is altered, or even '\nlost ' ;\nalso from a legacy of\nthe common-sense confusion placing our Selves as observers in the\nphysical head, and looking out at the physical world. If this latter\ncannot be so, then at least all this activity, Self and perceptual\nworld, it is felt, must be located in the brain. This latter is a\ndangerous prejudice of thought.\nIt is possible to account for these facts just as well by postulating\ninterference with transmission, instead of with actual function, or\ninterference with the activity of certain subsidiary electronic\nmechanisms in the brain. There is no a priori reason why per-\nceptual space should be coincident with physical space. We have no\nwarrant for accepting this blindly. The problem must be settled by\nexperiment, once the alternative hypothesis has been worked out,\nand critical experiments devised from it.\nThe alternative hypothesis is this :\nThe perceptual space-time system of the mind may be an\nindependent space system, i.e. it may be higher-dimensional\nrelative to physical space. We fill this space system with matter\nand attribute this with organization, and then we can postulate\nthat the gap between the electro-chemical events in the brain and\nthe corresponding events in perceptual space-time, which we\nobserve, may be crossed by signalhng mechanism. It is already\nclear that in our own individual world of perception we are ob-\nserving the events presented by one end of a signalling mechanism\n(the stroboscope shows us this : see p. 497), so the postulation of\nsome additional mechanism should not prove too difficult for the\nunderstanding to accept. Events in our perceptual world follow\nfaithfully the events in the physical world, except when there is a\nbreakdown in the mechanism. The only question remaining is\nwhether this presentation is done by brain-mechanisms or by this,\nas we may term it, psychical mechanism. When we look at some-\none else's living brain, we do not see this mechanism because it is\non the other side of a dimensional interface. We are thus in the\n\f488 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\nsame position as Planemen^ would be when confronted with a\nsohd object passing through their world. We must also postulate\nthat minute physical forces cross the interface in each direction, so\nthat events in one half of the system can affect events in the other\nhalf.\nThis theory can be derived from the Thouless and Wiesner\n'\nShin '\ntheory by postulating that Shin may be divided into Self\nand perceptual world, the latter the product of a series of signalling\nmechanisms extended in higher-dimensional space. and Wk\nthen become minute trans-dimensional physical forces. The\ndifficulties previously falsely transferred, under the TNS theory,\nto the '\nmind-brain '\nrelationship, may now be placed where they\nbelong, in the relation of the Self to the perceptual world. The\nrelation of the perceptual world to the physical world is effected\nby mechanism. Just as events in the brain are merely determined\n(on the afferent side) by events in the outside world by the\nsignalling mechanism in between, so may this independent and\norganized system of mind-stuff (or psychical mechanism) merely\nmirror the events in the brain, and so the events of the outside\nworld.\nThus I suggest a revision of our fundamental assumptions to :\n(i) Perceptual space is not coincident with physical space.\n(ii) We must use a system of seven axes to describe the total\nphysical universe.\nThe whole system may be described thus :\nThe physical universe, for one observer, consists of a seven-\ndimensional space-time continuum, divided artificially by reason\nof the nature of his observing mechanism into two subsections,\neach a four-dimensional space-time continuum, the two manifold\nsystems sharing one common time dimension. (Perceptual space\nand time may also be considered to form a continuum, since we\nnow have other means of distinguishing them from physical space-\ntime than by supposing that the passage of the observer through\nthis latter splits it up. The only means of distinguishing between\nthem before was that one system was supposed to form a con-\ntinuum, and the other was not). We may term one the '\nphysical\n'\nspace-time continuum, and the other the '\npsychical '\nspace-time\ncontinuum, though the difference between them is not one of kind\nbut of location.\nThese two space-time systems are filled with extended material\nsystems which interact across the interface between them (by\nmeans of and Wk). Events in physical space-time merely\ndetermine, by means of the signalling mechanism in between, the\n^ See E. A. Abbott, Flatland, 3rd edition (Oxford, Blackwell, 1926).\n\f195 1] ^^'^ Extension of Mind 489\nevents in perceptual space-time, which latter are the objects\nof the scientist's direct study. The Self can also determine\nevents in physical space-time by means of other signalling\nmechanism.\nThus the world we observe as scientists, and live in as humans\n(existing only in ourselves), may be made not of brain stuff, as Dr\nHutton suggests, but of organized mind-stulT (or psychical\nmechanism) extended in higher-dimensional space relative to the\nphysical world. Its events are only determined by events in the\nphysical world because of the extensive system for communication\nexisting between the two, comprised of, in one direction, sense\norgan, sensory nerve, central nervous system, psi-gamma, and\npsychical mechanism : in the other the psychical mechanism, psi-\nkappa, central nervous system, motor nerve, and muscle, which\nconduct the will of the Self to the physical world.\nHinton,^ in evolving his theory of the four-dimensional\nstationary universe (further developed by Warner Allen-) tra-\nversed by an observer to whom all four-dimensional objects\nappear directly as their three-dimensional cross-section, and\nchanges of four-dimensional shapes as movements, was misled by\nthe TNS theory. In such an extended universe the body of the\nobserver cannot be the moving agent as it is extended as is the rest\nof the material universe of which it is a mere '\neddy '. His theory\nrequires a psychic factor as observer, an extracorporeal agent, to\nproduce not only the moving agent but also the '\nnow '\nof time\nwhich cannot be produced in such a universe in any other way.\nEverything in the universe merely extends from the beginning to\nthe end of time as frozen and complex four-dimensional shapes\nincluding the body of the observer and his brain, through which\nthis extracorporeal observer must be supposed to be travelling.\nThis has seemed so unlike the world we know that his theory has\nremained very much in the background. Dunne^ resurrected it,\nand correlated it with the higher-space dimensions. He\nconfused these, however, both with an unnecessary serial\nregress of time, and the serial regress involved in thinking\nabout the Self thinking about the Self, etc, which is merely\na manoeuvre of reason. The present errors of assumption at\nthe basis of knowledge may not be over time as Dunne imagined,\nbut over space.\nA tentative return to it has been made in the current attempt to\naccount for the observed fact of precognition, which phenomenon\nis much easier to account for by using such a model of the universe,\n1 C. H. Hinton, A Neiv Era of Thought (London, 1888).\n^ Warner Allen, The Uncurtained Throne (London, Faber, 195 1).\n^\nJ. W. Dunne, The Serial Universe (London, Faber, 1934).\n\f49\u00b0 Jourtial of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\nas Dr Thouless^ points out. This is the theory of the '\nspecious\npresent which, however, falls between two stools as it seems to\nimply a partial extension of the physical universe in this manner,\nbut just how far is not stated. Such an extension must be all or\nnothing, and if it is to be all, an extraneous factor must be provided\nto account for a single unique and travelling position, the '\nnow '\nof time, dividing the '\nEternal Now '\ninto a past and a future.\nWe may, however, suppose that the Self is not travelling through\nthe brain, as the previous theories suggested, but that the psy-\nchical mechanism, extended in one sub-section of the continuum,\nmerely exchanges information via the specific forces Wy and\nwith the brain. In this manner events in one subsection affect\nevents in the other. \"We have then accounted, not only for the\n'\nnow ' of time in Hinton's universe, the erstwhile inexphcable\nchange from electronic patterns in the brain to the phenomena of\nexperience, and all paranormal phenomena, but we have also been\nable to attribute more dignity to the human Self than by supposing\nit just to be an expression of the internal co-ordination of\na machine.\nIt should be noted, however, that the question whether the\nmaterial system in the '\nphysical '\nsubsection of the seven-\ndimensional total universe is three-dimensional (orthodox theory),\nor four-dimensional (Hinton's theory) is only a detail as far as this\ntheory is concerned. The psychical system could be imagined to\nreact equally well with either, although the latter is suggested by\nthe fact of precognition. I should therefore like to suggest that the\nrelevant mathematical study for psychical research might be the\nstudy of the properties of hyperspace systems in relative movement\nto each other.\n(The universe, for one observer, may even be an eight-dimen-\nsional continuum, since, if we postulate that the two sub-sections\nhave no common dimension, then we merely have to attribute\nadditional powers to psi.)\nIPy and may then be regarded as minute physical forces, as\nfar as we can detect them directly, which penetrate the physical\nworld from outside it. They are normally focused upon the\nbrain, but have a '\npenumbra ', which would be responsible for\nESP and PK. The interior of the psychical mechanism, which\npresents that which we actually observe, reproduces faithfully the\nevents in the physical body and its environment. This reproduction\nis so good that the TNS fallacy of common sense was indeed\n^ R. H. Thouless, '\nExperimental Precognition and its Implications,' J^.\nSac. Psychic.

The geographical arrangement and probably\nrelative size of objects or object-images (including the body and the\nbody-image as observed) in each world are similar to each other,\nbut each very different from that of the object-images in the brain,\nwhich merely forms an integrative and informative link between\nthe two.\nSo if we consider the observations of two observers in relative\nmotion to each other, only the physical bodies of each observer\nhave this relative motion, and so cut different cross-sections of the\n'\nphysical ' continuum, as described in the special and general\ntheories. These cross-sections do not form perceptual space and\ntime directly, but the process causes different information to be\nsignalled back to the observer, and so causes different patterns to\nbe thrown on to his visual screen, and other integrated changes to\nbe made in his perceptual world. Each observer, thus misled by\nthe nature of his observing mechanism, interprets this to mean that\nhe himself is in relative motion to the other observer, whereas in\nfact it is not necessary to postulate that he moves at all. All that\nmay be moving is the focus of the psi-fields^fli^ Hinton's universe,\nor with a three-dimensional physical universe travelling in time, as\nwell as his physical body. The only movements we have ever\nobserved are those occurring in our own perceptual fields, and\nthese may as well be determined by mechanism abstracting in-\nformation from changing four-dimensional shapes (the equivalent\nof movement in Hinton's universe) as from particles moving in\ntime.\nIt should be borne in mind that any such psychical mechanism\nmust be of a fabulous complexity, and in parts employing prin-\nciples of which we know nothing, as we do not meet them in the\n'\nphysical ' world : although we can gain a fair idea, by observing\nthe stroboscopic patterns (see p. 497) and by analogy, of the\nworkings of the proximal end of the visual mechanism by com-\nparing it with television. We may represent the brain by the\nactors in the studio, and the physical external world by the script\nwhich is determining their behaviour. The psychical mechanism\nwould then include the television cameras, transmitters, and\nreceivers, all for ever hidden behind the screen of the set, upon\nwhich is continually and tirelessly presented the visual phenomena\nfor our daily attention.\nThe relation between the Self, the psyche, and the body would\nseem to be analogous to that between the controller in the parent\naerodrome and a radio-controlled pilotless aircraft. Imagine this\nlatter to be fitted with television cameras and other instruments,\nwhich constantly signal information about its own state and the\nstate of the environment to the control tower, inside which is\n\f492 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\nplaced the controller. He observes all that is taking place on the\ntelevision screen, and attends to the other information signalled\nback. Imagine further that he has been there for as long as he can\nremember, and that he cannot see, and has never seen, anything\nexcept the screen before him. If no one had ever told him about\nhis circumstances, would he not consider that he was actually in the\nnose of the robot craft, and seeing personally the country over\nwhich it was flying?\nWe come, then, to the following inescapable conclusions about\nthe mind.\n(i) It has '\nwhereness '.\n(ii) It has three dimensions of space and one of time.\n(iii) Our concepts of physical space are derived from our ex-\nperience of perceptual space and not vice versa.\n(iv) There are only three possible topological relationships be-\ntween perceptual space and physical space. The former may be\ncoincident {a) with the whole of the latter ;\n[b) with part of the\nlatter ; or {c) with none of the latter. The first, the TNS fallacy,\nis disallowed by neurophysiology.\n(v) Perceptual space may be coincident with the space system\nof the brain {b), or with higher-dimensional space {c). If the\nlatter, then the psychic factor of mind may be partly an extensive\nand organized material entity located in this space. The former\nhypothesis {b) is simpler, but perhaps it is too simple, as it does not\naccount for the '\nsomething definite '\nwhich happens when to a\n'\ncertain brain-state a certain \" sciousness \" corresponds ', and it is\nquite unable to account for the facts of parapsychology. The\nlatter hypothesis (c), although more complex, can account for\nboth. The facts of parapsychology become not incredible but\nonly to be expected.\n4. CERTAIN MISCONCEPTIONS IN PHILOSOPHY\nSince the perceptual world is so very clearly extended in space\nand time, and since it is also clearly a product of the mind, how,\nwe may ask, do many philosophers believe either that the mind is\nsomething unextended or that it is meaningless to discuss\nwhether the mind is or is not extended ?\nWe owe the first concept to Descartes, whom we find not only\nto be well in the grip of the TNS theory but to have made an\nadditional mistake on top of this. Cartesian dualism presents the\nfamiliar picture of the TNS theory of 'unextended thinking\nspirits ', located in the physical head of the observer and regarding\nthe physical world '\nthrough '\ntheir sense organs. There is a\n\f195 1\n] '^^^ Extension of Mind 493\nfurther confusion between those qualities of objects which can\nactually be measured, the primary qualities, with the physical\nworld ; and the secondary qualities, those that cannot be measured,\nare confused with the observing Self. These qualities, however,\nare derived by the action of reason on the perceptual world, and\nhave nothing to do with the way this world is presented to us.\nThe fundamental fallacy of Cartesian dualism is thus derived\nfrom the TNS theory. The '\nmind '\nis identified with the Self\nand the perceptual world with the physical world. The unextended\nmind regards and wonders at the external physical world arrayed in\nspace and time before it. This leads to the attempt to describe\n'\nmind '\nby attributes more suitable to the Self, immaterial and\nunextended. It leads also to the direct transference to the physical\nworld of the attributes extended and material, which properly\nbelong to the perceptual world, a part of mind. (Not that they do\nnot apply also to the physical world ;\nthey do, but only at second-\nhand.) The gulf between the material and the immaterial seems,\nhowever, unbridgeable.\nIf we try to repair this by postulating that the mind has a\n'\npsychic '\nfactor, we do not progress any further, if we seek to\ndifferentiate between this psychic factor and the brain on the\ngrounds that the former is again immaterial and unextended, while\nthe latter is material and extended. The difficulty of all immaterial\npsychic factor theories is that as soon as we postulate that an\nimmaterial factor can move an electron in the brain, as we must\nto make any sense of our theory, it becomes material. The ghost\nin the machine becomes, as Ryle points out, just a ghostly machine\nitself. Besides, it is difficult to see what, in experience, this im-\nmaterial factor is supposed to represent. If the Self, how does\nthis insinuate itself into the machine? How does the machine\npresent it with the extended perceptual picture of the physical\nworld, and how does it surround this factor with the body-image ?\nFurther, how does the immaterial factor, tucked away somewhere\nin the brain, move matter, as it must do in voluntary movement\nand psycho-kinesis? If on the other hand it is supposed to\ncorrespond with total mind. Self and perceptual world together,\nhow does this immaterial and so unorganized entity manufacture\nthe manifest organization of the perceptual world ?\nIf we try to repair this, as Gilbert Ryle does, by so defining mind\nto mean a verbal cloak to cover such processes as thinking, per-\nceiving, feeling, etc. we have merely avoided the problems of\nperceptual space. It is, of course, meaningless to discuss whether\nthe '\nmind *\nis extended or not if by mind we mean what Ryle\nmeans by the word. There is no argument, however, about the\nextension of the physical world, nor could there be about the\n\f494 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\nextension of the perceptual world. Any description of mind\nwhich does not account adequately for this latter extension, other\nthan confusing it with the former, is not acceptable, once the\nfallacy of the transparent nervous system has been exposed.\nIn The Concept of Mind Ryle points out correctly that Descartes'\nseparation of mind and brain on the attribute '\nmaterial ' leads only\nto absurdity. He goes on to deal with the way that we form certain\nconcepts from our experience by the exercise of reason, but says\nnothing about how this world before us is presented to us. He has\nnot noticed Descartes' basic error, of which those errors he has\nnoticed are but consequences. It is clear that his use of such\nwords as '\nseeing '\nand '\nobserving '\nrests upon the common-\nsense fallacy that when I say, '\nI see a man it is as simple as that.\nHere am I, and there in '\nspace '\nand time is '\nthe man '. He\nignores the fact that what he calls the '\ncommon world '\nis presented\nto each of us individually by our minds. Ryle is indeed misled\nin the way that Hutton describes (see p. 480). His argu-\nments in The Concept of Mind are presented as though they were\nonly common sense. ^ They are, in so far as they are based on\nthe common-sense fallacy of the TNS. '\nCommon sense' has\nproved in the past a most misleading guide. It was the common-\nsense idea for a very long time that the earth was flat. The history\nof science should make it sufficiently clear that these questions\ncannot be settled by the unaided activity of the human reason, but\nonly by undertaking the relevant experiments, in this case those of\nparapsychology. There is no point in repairing a set of logical\nabsurdities with a set of practical impossibilities.\nRyle's use of the word '\nmind '\nenables us to avoid the insistent\nquestion of perceptual space. If it is meaningless to discuss\nwhether the mind is extended or not , then we can happily deny\nthe most cardinal fact of observation, that the mind has '\nwhere-\nness '. Alternatively, we can account for the extension of the\nperceptual world by confusing it with the physical world or we\nmay do the only proper thing, and that is to work out the con-\nsequencies of locating the perceptual world in the brain, as long as\nwe remember that we are no longer allowed to slip back unnoticed\ninto the TNS fallacy as soon as any difficulties present themselves.\nTo illustrate the strains involved by postulating a coincidence of\nperceptual space, and the objects contained in it, with the physical\nspace system of the brain and its electron patterns, it is only\nnecessary to point out certain consequences of this, singularly\nneglected by protagonists of this theory.\n^ For example, see The Concept of Mind, p. 249, where the main fault in\nRyle's argument is clearly demonstrated by his inference that objects, as\nobserved, (in this case his pen nib) are extended in physical space.\n\fThe Extension of Mind 495\nIf I choose to call my body-image in consciousness, as observed\nby the Self '\nsix feet high ', as common sense does, then, as my\nphysical body is twelve times larger than the body-image in the\nbrain, I must realize that it is, if measured by my familiar\nideas of feet, some seventy-two feet high : that, if I regard my toe,\nas felt when wriggled, as possessing six feet of '\nthereness '\nfrom\nmy Self, then my physical toe possesses seventy-two feet of this\n'\nthereness '\n; and that, if I extend my arm sideways, and in the\nspace system in which I feel it to be '\nthat far away '\nI extend a\nline for about an equal distance by mental imagery, I shall then\nreach the bone of my physical skull. It will be clear that these\nconsiderations will do violence to our common-sense views of the\nworld, still based obstinately on the TN S theory. To think of the\nfamiliar world of experience, as observed, as locked up inside one's\nskull makes the physical world into a monstrously large place,\nrelative to our common-sense ideas of it. This is clearly put by\nE. A. Burtt in The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical\nScience}\nAs Hutton continues in his article :\nOne of the most important features of these transient cortical patterns\nis that many of them show extraordinary similarities in their temporo-\nspatial relationships to the patterns from which and to which their\nmovement flows, and, in fact, they appear to reproduce these on a\nsmaller scale, the ratios remaining the same, though the quantities vary,\n(p. 162. My itahcs.)\nSince we fall so easily into the TN S fallacy, it might have seemed\nsuspicious that the body-image in consciousness is so like the\nphysical body, and so unlike what seems to be the body-image in\nthe brain. It should be noted in the above passage that the\ntemporo-spatial relationships that we observe are those that the\nSelf can determine in the perceptual world, and it is only an\nassumption that Hutton has made that these may be identified with\nthe patterns in the cerebral cortex. He does not go on to draw the\nnecessary conclusions from the words '\non a smaller scale '.\nAnd having done all this, we find ourselves no nearer to account-\ning for the simple facts of parapsychology than we were to start\nwith. Ryle rejects the erroneous two-world theory of Descartes,\nbut the facts require neither this nor his untenable substitute, but\nan adequate two-world theory.\nTo supply this I suggest that the differentiation of psyche from\nbrain should be made on the basis of different geographical location.\nDescartes' description of the psyche seems to have sprung from a\nhasty choice of qualities, opposite to those most clearly exhibited\n^ London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 2nd ed. 1932, pp. 314-16.\n\f496 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sEPT.\nby the brain, i.e. inmiaterial, imextended, and unorganized. But if\nwe locate the psyche in higher-dimensional space, all the diffi-\nculties of traditional dualism, skilfully exposed by Ryle, evaporate.\nBoth these difficulties, and Ryle's attempts at repair, may be seen\nto be based on a confusion in our ideas of space, and over our use\nof the words '\nmind '\nand '\nSelf '. We also avoid the difficulties of\nmonism, which Ryle so skilfully passes over that we are almost\npersuaded that they do not exist.\nPsyches may be real machines. They have only appeared\nspectral owing to their confusing geography. The experimenter\ncannot enter mind's private world, not because it does not exist,\nbut because of the barrier presented by a dimensional interface.\nHe may nevertheless confirm its existence by the indirect but\nrelevant experiments of parapsychology. We thus avoid the\ninsoluble conflict between the facts of parapsychology and Ryle's\nunanswerable criticisms of Cartesian dualism. We also avoid\nRyle's impossible position when he seeks to deny any sort of\nprivate world to mind. This theory also relieves much of the\nburden on neurophysiologists, since the brain would seem to be a\nmuch simpler organ than it has hitherto been supposed. Many\nfunctions attributed to it may now be attributed to the geo-\ngraphically independent psyche and Self.\n5. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN\nWe may suppose that the brain has the following functions :\n(i) To collect, integrate, and present information about the out-\nside world, and the state of the physical body, for to pick up and\ntransfer to the psychical mechanisms, which in turn present this\nto the Self in its familiar field of awareness.\n(ii) To translate the Self's instructions (conveyed by which\ninterferes with the statistical behaviour of electrons in the cortex,\njust as it can interfere with the statistical behaviour of dice) into\nthe electronic messages for the muscles.\n(iii) To supply a battery of servo-mechanisms designed to aid\nvoluntary movement thus conveyed.\n(iv) To learn unconscious skills and to store them as one form of\nmemory.\n(v) To supply various protective reflex mechanisms, for instance\nthe eye-blink.\n(vi) To act as a thought screen and perhaps a screen for visual\nimagery, and to supply a series of thinking mechanisms. It may\nalso store other types of memory. Functions (iii) to (vi) correspond\nto Aldous Huxley's '\nphysiological intelligence '.\n\f195 1] ' The Extension of Mind 497\nIt is of the first importance for all the enthusiastic exponents of\nthe fashionable analogy between brains and computing machines\nto realize that the brain only functions in part along these lines.\nIt has two input systems and two output systems. It is but a station\non the way to the soul.\nWe do not need any longer to ask how the machine can ap-\npreciate beauty, write a symphony, and undergo a mystical ex-\nperience. The soul does these things ; the brain is merely part of\nthe control panel for the observing and executive instrument,\nwhich is the body. The universe may be both larger and more\nwonderful than we have supposed.\n6. THE GENESIS OF PERCEPTUAL SPACE\nLet us see how Sherrington,^ having accepted that the mind is in\nextended space, goes on to deal with the problem. '\nThe vexed\nquestion,' he says, '\nof the mode of origin or genesis of sensual\nspace we have not to enter on. We accept the brute fact that our\nminds' perception through the senses immerses us in space.' (pp.\n325-6. My italics.) Thus we see that this fundamental question\non which much else depends, the genesis of sensual (or perceptual)^\nspace, is mentioned only to be shelved, and, of course, the phrase\n'\nthrough the senses '\nenables us to slip back almost unnoticed\ninto the TNS fallacy of common sense. Indeed the manoeuvre is\nunavoidable, since it is no use trying to persuade ourselves or\nother people that the world, as we individually live in it, is not\nextended in space and time.\nWe now know a little more about the mode of origin of per-\nceptual space. The following observations prove our working\nhypothesis (see p. 481) that the visual part at least of the perceptual\nworld in consciousness is built up by a signalling mechanism. The\nproblem of visual space is complicated by the fact that it is of dual\norigin. Observations made using the stroboscope have shown\nthat the visual picture in consciousness is built up along lines very\nsimilar to three-dimensional television in colour. The stroboscope\nis an electronic lamp which flashes at regular intervals. The\nduration of the flash is extremly short, some one millionth of a\nsecond. Now if we look at such a lamp flashing at a frequency of\nbetween 4 to 20 times a second, we observe that a large number of\ncomplex zig-zag lines and mosaics appear in the perceptual field\nbefore us vibrating with incessant movement, as it were upon a\n^ Man on His Nature.\n^ Perceptual space includes sensual space and the space of mental\nimagery.\n\f498 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sEPT.\nscreen situated, it seems, a few inches in front of our observing\nselves. These Hnes are of various colours and execute their move-\nments against a pale, almost colourless, background. As Grey\nWalter^ points out, this is very similar to the effect produced on the\nscreen of a television set if the studio is illuminated by a strobo-\nscopic lamp, due to the basic nature of the television process.\nNow in the following discussion I shall use the word '\nscreen\n'\nto indicate the pale background on which these patterns are\nexecuted. I do not feel that it brings to mind any illegitimate\nassociations that would not be aroused were you actually to observe\nthe phenomenon, as anyone has witnessed this will agree. So we\ncome to realize that our familiar visual picture of the world is\ncontinually being built up before us on this '\nscreen '\nby thousands\nof little scanning beams travelling to and fro across it very rapidly\njust as the three-dimensional television picture is built up.\nIf you examine this black cross on a white field\nI\nyou will realize that it is continually being built up in this manner.\nA little beam starts here\nand throws a patch of white on to the '\nscreen '\nand scans\nrapidly across until it gets here\nwhen it changes momentarily to black and produces one segment\nof the cross and then turning white again speeds off producing the\nwhiteness of the paper. While it is producing its black speck\nanother scanning beam is producing another black speck directly\nunder it, thus j\nand so on. Thousands of these little coloured beams, whose\n'\ngrain '\nwe never notice since their resolving power seems to be\ngreater than the limiting resolving power of the retina, continually\nbuild up our everyday picture of the world in this manner.

Thus our three-dimensional stereo-\nscopically produced visual space is mostly as illusory as the ap-\nparent space in which the television actors on the two-dimensional\nscreen move about : we do not look for these inside the television\nset. So in normal stereoscopic vision two complex and ever-\nchanging patterns are thrown on to this '\nscreen ', and the illusion\nis produced, which depends entirely on the properties inherent in\nthe screen^ itself and on the capabilities of the observiiig self, since all\nother mechanisms in between the screen and the outside world\nmerely determine the detailed nature of the patterns to be pro-\njected on to the screen, and execute this projection. (The ap-\nparent space produced by the stereoscope has a similar origin, as\nthe stereoscope merely converts out of two flat pictures conditions\nfrom which this process can start.) The name '\noptical illusion\n'\nis a misnomer again derived from the TN S theory. It is the Self\nthat is deluded, as the visual mechanisms present the information\ncorrectly. Nevertheless, this illusory space is built up on a\nbasis of real space. The screen itself is two-dimensional ;\nwe can describe the position of any point on it in terms of two\nco-ordinates, but our observing Selves are clearly set back\nfrom it : it is '\nthere '\nwhile Self, as always, is '\nhere '. We\ncan sketch a pyramid in our mental imagery using any four\npoints on the patterns not in a straight line as base and the\nSelf as apex. To describe the whole process three co-ordinates\nare needed. This space has evidently a dissimilar origin from\nthe other.\nThe screen forms the fundamental background of visual per-\nception. In the current theory held by some workers in neuro-\nphysiology, this presentation is done by a series of electrical switch-\nscanning mechanisms present in the brain, but under this theory\nno clear exposition is given as to what is looking at these patterns,\nor how these space-time relationships of the patterns, amongst\nthemselves and to the observer, may be fitted into the space-time\nsystem of the brain. However, all that we can be certain of, from\ndirect observation, is that an exceedingly complex mechanism\nmust be directly responsible for this picture. I have suggested\nthat there is no necessity to regard this as being in the brain, but\nthat this presentation may be done by the independent psychical\nmechanism whose behaviour only is determined by events in the\nbrain. In this way we can account for the observed spatial rela-\ntionships in a less strained way (see p. 495), and leave room for the\nobserver. Furthermore, the facts of parapsychology can be\nexplained.\n^ I postulate that this screen is a material screen composed of mind-\nstuff.\n\f500 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sEPT.\n7. THE NATURE OF THE PSYCHE\nWhen we come to consider the possible nature of the psyche,\nwe find only two theories in common use.\n(i) That the psyche is merely a noun descriptive of certain com-\nplex and determining electronic processes in the brain. It cannot\nthen be capable of functioning or existing in any way as an inde-\npendent agent, since it is held to be merely an expression of the\ninternal co-ordination of a machine. We can say all that we wish\nto say without using the word at all.\n(ii) That the psyche is a potentially independent agent and is in\ncontrol of the brain. To distinguish it from the brain it is supposed\nto be unextended and immaterial. No account has ever been given\nof how this control is exercised, nor how this concept may be fitted\ninto the world as I know it or into the manner of my knowing it.\nAs this theory has been in the field for as long as history has been\nrecorded, there does not seem to be much hope that this integration\nwill ever be made. There does not seem to be any credible bridge\nbetween the material and the immaterial as presented by this\ntheory. It is impossible to find a functional relationship between\nthem, between the '\nenergy-concept ' and '\nnaked mind ' of\nSherrington, since, as products of reason, there is no relationship\nbetween them except what reason itself has given them in\nsundering them apart : a relationship of antithesis outside which\nreason cannot get.\nThe alternative theory I am presenting here suggests that there\nhas indeed been a grave category-mistake in this attempt to\ndistinguish between the physical and psychical worlds on account\nof the attributes '\nmaterial '\nand '\nimmaterial '. This division\nprecludes the erection of any bridge between the two worlds\nbecause by definition and on logical grounds the immaterial can\nplay no part in the material world. If, however, the division is\nmade on account of geographical location, we may suppose that the\npsyche is both material and extended (in higher-dimensional\nspace). We can then build our bridge and account for the nature\nof the perceptual world in a manner which is credible, which\nexplains the erstwhile discordant facts of parapsychology, and\nwhich suggests a method by which the '\nmind '\nmay convert\nelectronic patterns in the brain into the familiar phenomena of\nmental experience. Thus we may suppose that we cannot see\nsomeone else's psyche, not because it is ghostly and immaterially\ninvisible, but because it is on the other side of the most impene-\ntrable of all barriers, a dimensional interface.\nThe nature of the Self remains inexplicable. We may, if we\nlike, reserve the attributes '\napparently unextended '\nand '\nap-\n\f1951] The Extension of Mind 501\nparently immaterial ' for the Self, though of course it may consist\nof a complex and organized system too.\nCONCLUSION\nI have expressed these ideas in the form of four postulates\nwhich I have called the Theory of Extension.\n(i) To give a consistent and unitary account of phenomena it is\nnecessary to use a framework of '\nn '\nspace dimensions (n>3).\n(ii) The three dimensions comprising the manifold of mental\nposition (perceptual space) are at right-angles to the four dimen-\nsions of physical space-time. The two manifold systems may\nshare one common time dimension. The universe is thus a seven-\ndimensional continuum, which we divide artificially into two sub-\nsections by reason of the nature of our observing mechanisms, and\nfrom which we separate time from space by our motion through\nit.\n(iii) The psyche may consist of an organized material entity\nlocated in higher-dimensional space. This may abstract informa-\ntion from the brain, and transform it into the familiar phenomena\nof experience which it presents to the Self. On the motor aspect\nthe Self, through another part of this mechanism and the brain,\nmay order its thoughts and actions.\n(iv) The axes of the psychical world (a hitherto unrecognized\npart of the total physical universe) may be called OX', OY', OZ',\nand OT. The axes of the physical world are OX, OY, OZ, and\nOT. (The misconception, if such, would not have been apparent\nbefore since the number of axes, the mathematically important\nfactor, for the '\nphysical '\nworld is the same.)\nThis theory, from the point of view of experimental para-\npsychology, suggests that ESP and PK are incidental side-\neffects of the normal psyche-brain relationship, as Thouless and\nWiesner put forward in their Shin Theory. It would further\nexplain :\n(a) The apparent independence of ESP of spatial, and to some\nextent temporal, separation of percipient and target or agent,\nsince we may imagine that Wy, coming from higher-dimensional\nspace, may traverse our entire universe as quickly as we can push a\npencil through a piece of paper. Its penumbra, extending so\nwidely through space, could also be imagined to extend a little\nway, or even long distances, into the future.\n(b) The deleterious effect of trying too hard on scoring rates in\nESP tests, since this might be expected to increase the focus of Wy\non to the brain and so lessen the penumbra effect subserving ESP.\n\f502 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept.\n(c) It also provides the organization seemingly required by the\nactivity of the '\ncensor '\nas described by Soal.^\nIf mind is regarded as something unextended and immaterial,\nit is very difficult to see how it could do the work necessary to turn\na die, which was going to fall with one face up, so that another\ndoes, as PK shows it must do. Likewise, in clairvoyance experi-\nments it is difficult to see how it could extract information from the\nphysical cards. One of the most striking things about the pheno-\nmena of parapsychology has been the lack of any apparent\norganization to undertake these formidable tasks. Such apparent\n'\naction at a distance '\nas parapsychology discloses is anathema to\nscience. The gap must be closed. This theory suggests where\nthis organization may be found, once we realize that things may be\ninvisible, not because they are immaterial, but because they may\nbe on the other side of a dimensional interface. The theory also\nsupplies the necessary forces to close the gap, and instruments of\nsufficient sensitivity should be capable of detecting them. It can\nalso account for certain discrepancies in neurophysiology and has\nlinks with the experiments of Gestalt psychology. It suggests a\nseries of experimental investigations, not only for parapsychology\nbut also for physics.\nESP EXPERIMENTS\nWITH AN INFANT AS SUBJECT\nReported by G. W. Fisk\nThe following are translated extracts from a letter from Docteur\nPaul Vasse of the Societe Metaphysique Picarde, 136 Boulevard\nChateaudun, Amiens, France, dated 25 February 1951 addressed\nto Dr D. J. West.\nI should like to make an E S P experiment with you across the Channel.\nMme Vasse has experimented with our very young daughter (Foyette\n\u2014\n14 months) with very curious and successful results. This is what has\nbeen done. The DT technique has been used. The pack of twenty-\nfive ESP cards is shufHed without Mme Vasse seeing the cards. The\nbaby then reads the cards, but as she cannot speak she makes her\n'\ndivination '\nby gesture. The 5 symbols are put into 5 envelopes\n(without their being seen). The envelopes are marked with the 5\nletters, A, E, I, O, U. The little child then picks up one envelope and\nMme Vasse records the letter it bears. When the run is completed the\n*\n' Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception,' Proc. Sac. Psychic. Res.,\nvol. 49 (195 1) PP- 142-7-\n\figji] ESP Experiments with an Infant 503\nsymbol corresponding to the letter is noted and the score calculated.\nAfter each run the five symbols are withdrawn from the envelopes,\nshuffled, and again placed in the envelopes in any chance order\u2014always\nwithout Mme Vasse seeing them. This amuses the child immensely,\nbut she is soon bored and a complete run cannot be made at one sitting.\nIt is continued later when convenient.\nDr Vasse continues :\nEvidently here is a beautiful example of '\npolypsychisme '\nbetween\nmother and infant. For although the mother has had successful results\nin PK experiments with plants and dice her successes with cards have\nbeen almost nil.\nDr Vasse gave the following totals of hits for each of ten runs\nmade :\n7, II, 8, 10, 15, 8, 12, II, 13, 15\nTotal no. of hits in 250 trials = 110\nChance expectation = 50 Deviation =+ 60\nThe C.R. is thus approximately 9-5 !\nWith so fantastic a resuk it seemed well worth w^hile to accept\nDr Vasse's offer and to arrange a cross-channel test. Accordingly\ndates were fixed and I exposed on my desk in Ditton Hill a pack of\ncards each week. As many '\nK-objects '\nor poi7its d'appui were\narranged as possible, such as exchange of photographs, etc. Un-\nfortunately there were only chance resuhs, as the following\nsummary of scores shows. As an alternative test I also sent sealed\npacks of cards to Mme Vasse to see if any better scores would\nresult, but again there was no success. It will be noted, however,\nthat while Poyette only scored negatively in the cross-channel tests\nshe scored positively when the packs were actually in the room\nwith her ; but the deviations from chance are too small in both\ncases to be more than very slightly suggestive.\nSUMMARY OF SCORES\nSeries A\nA pack of ESP cards exposed weekly in G.W.F.'s study, Ditton Hill, Surrey.\nPacks of 25 cards in random order\u2014copies of random order posted weekly to\nDr West.\nMarch 1951 Run i Hits 5\n2 5\n3 4\n4 6 20\nApril-May 5 o\n6 4\n. 7 3\n8 4\n31\nDeviation for 200 trials = - 9\n\f504 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept, j\nSeries B\nSealed packs of 25 cards posted to Amiens.

Some discussion of the papers is also printed.\nA. T. Westlake in a paper on Vis Medicatrix Naturae identifies\nthis concept with the odic force of Reichenbach and the orgone\nenergy of Reich, and with various other supposed forces and\nfluids of debatable reality.\nSeveral papers deal from an experimental viewpoint with\npostulated radiations and force fields of different kinds. E. A.\nMaury and M. Maury mention some experiments on the human\nelectromagnetic field. They dispense with a detailed description\nof their apparatus in order not to complicate the subject. M.\nAsh describes the detection of radiation from the body by feeling\nit with his hand. He finds a stimulus to occur at critical distances\nfrom the body, and also describes some instrumental methods of\ndetection. Some general remarks on human radiations are con-\ntributed by W. E. Arnould-Taylor. Conducted radionic emission\nfrom drugs and bloods is considered by L. E. Eeman.\nThe question of harmful rays from the earth is discussed in a\npaper by H. Larvaron. J. C. Maby, however, adds that this\npaper proves nothing. L. P. Corte examines the effect of modula-\n\f195 1 ] Reviews 5\u00b05\ntion on postulated radiations from body cells and other sources.\nG. de la Warr considers the manifestation of what he calls '\nFunda-\nmental Energy '\nand proceeds to enunciate some new laws of\nphysics relating to this energy. These laws, however, are not\nclearly formulated and it would seem better to rank them as\nspeculations.\nA theoretical paper by A. J. K. Glazewski attempts to relate\nsome of the concepts of radiesthesia to modern theoretical\nphysics. His ideas are presented in a somewhat obscure way and\nwill be largely incomprehensible to the general reader. They\nappear too unsound to attract the specialist reader. Some further\nremarks on theoretical physics are contributed by R. C. Thornton.\nA good number of claims of interest in psychical research are\nadvanced by J. C. Maby. He asserts that all matter radiates\nweakly with frequencies specific to different materials, and notably\ndetermined by atomic and molecular weight. Moving water is\nsupposed to produce an additional and stronger flow field. The\nhuman nerve-muscle system reacts to both these stimuli. Maby\nstates that these facts can be witnessed by any patient and unpre-\njudiced observer. However, a great many physical factors are\nsaid to interfere with observations on these radiations. Conditions\nfavourable for dowsing experiments are stated to favour telepathy\nand clairvoyance experiments to such an extent that an almost\nentirely correct score may be obtained with good subjects over\nshort time periods. Maby also claims that an imaginative person\ncan project a psycho-radiant energy and influence suitable\nphysical instruments. Indeed, these radiations from bystanders\ninterfere with dowsers.\nThe Proceedings are terminated by a very clear summary of the\npresent position by J. C. Maby. Radiesthesia and Radionics now\noccupy an intermediate position between science and psychical\nresearch. It is apparent from these Proceedings that at present\ntheir experimental and theoretical basis is slender. However, as\nMaby observes, orthodox science can be influenced by an internal\nferment arising from the minds of scientists who have been pre-\nsented with clear and repeatable evidence.\nA. J. B. Robertson\nSolid Proofs of Survival. By Einer Nielsen. London,\nSpiritualist Press, 1950. 193 pp. 5 plates. los. 6d.\nIt is always interesting for the psychical researcher to read books\nby mediums since it affords a glimpse into the minds of the writers.\nSuch mediums as G. A. Redman, D. D. Home, and Mrs Leonard\nhave all contributed something in this direction, and in the present\n\f5o6 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [sept. {\nvolume the Danish medium, Einer Nielsen, has added an item to\nthe hst. !\nMr Nielsen is predominantly a medium for materialization, his\nproductions sometimes resembling those of Eva C. and at others\nthose of Linda Gazerra or Mrs Henderson. In his book he tells\nthe story of his life and work, and it is full of the handsome\ntributes paid to him by his admirers. Moreover, he prints his ov^n\nversion of the disastrous series of sittings in Oslo in 1922, the\nawful days of which he thinks he was only able to endure through Ij\nthe kindness of Miss Ramsden.\nAlthough the Oslo sittings are discussed by Mr Nielsen with his\nown explanations of the suspicious circumstances reported, he '\ndoes not seem to have dealt even in outline with the Carstensen i\nstory and how the medium rebutted it.^ This is unfortunate,\n|\nsince it would have been interesting to see Mr Nielsen's attitude I\nand an account of the legal case connected with it. Apart from I\nthese and a fev\/ other omissions, the book appears to provide a I\nconcise story of the growth and development of the author's\nmediumship. Unfortunately, the evidence he adduces is hardly\nsufficient to persuade even the moderately critical reader that he '\npossesses any supernormal powers, an opinion to which I myself\ninclined after seeing something of his work in 1924. The con-\nditions under which the sittings are conducted appears to have\nbeen lax, the control inadequate, and the lighting poor. Thus,\nalthough this book purports to be solid proofs of survival, it can\nscarcely be said to be proof of anything, unless some unkind\nreader insists that it is yet another proof of human credulity in the 1\nseance room.\nE.

LTD.\nTHE UNIVERSITY PRESS, GLASGOW\n\f\fJOURNAL\nof the\nSociety for Psychical Research\nVolume XXXVI No. 667 November-December 195 i\nA NOTE ON PRECOGNITION\nBy C. T. K. Chari\nIn the Proceedings of the S.P.R. for July 1950^ and in the issue of\nMind for the same month,^ Mr C. W. K. Mundle raised the ques-\ntion whether ostensible precognition can be accounted for by some\nconceivable combination of PK and non-precognitive ESP.\nPsychical researchers must be aware that Dr Tanagra once put\nforward the suggestion that a person who makes a 'supernormal\nprediction' actually brings about its fulfilment by exercising in\nsome cases his telekinetic powers.^ 'L'absence de I'agent', he\ndeclared, 'ne parait pas toujours influencer les manifestations . . .\nJ'ai ete ainsi persuade que le dynamisme producteur du thory-\nbisme et des phenomenes telekinetiques pent aussi a distance,\ncomme d'ailleurs des personnes absentes'.* Tanagra's hypothesis,\nlike the PK hypothesis, requires some very ad hoc extensions\nbefore it can cover all the recorded cases of spontaneous pre-\ncognition. While I agree with Mr Mundle that every attempt\nshould be made to ascertain whether we have reached technically\nrigorous limits in the experimental isolation of precognition, I am\nafraid that most definitions of precognition are petitiones principii.\nThere are two parts of Mr Mundle's definition likely to invite\nmisconceptions.\nMr Mundle does not pretend to offer us any theory of the modus\noperandi of precognition ;\nyet his phraseology suggests that ' later\nevents' can exert a 'direct causal influence' (italics mine) on 'earlier\nhuman events'. Now it seems pretty certain to me that any attempt\nto 'understand' or 'explain' precognition will involve the most\nextreme metaphysical reconstruction of our notions of 'causality'\nand the characteristics of 'before-after' and 'past-present-future'\niVol. XLIX, Part 178. ^ Vol. LIX, No. 235.\n' See H.

It is important that no relevant\nmetaphysical possibility should be excluded by the psychical\nresearcher. Whether or no Mr Mundle intends it, his terminology\nmay persuade us that the most hopeful approach to the problem\nof precognition lies in sticking to a time the instants of which are\nall ordered by 'linear betweenness', and that the only departure\nfrom common-sense notions we have to make lies in recognizing\nan unfamiliar 'later-to-earlier' direction in which 'causality' can\noperate. I venture to suggest that in working out a theory of pre-\ncognition, the conception of a time the instants of which are all\nlinearly ordered may have to be abandoned.^ The door should be\nkept open to all possibilities, no matter how weird or fantastic.\nAbout the only prudent course for the experimental psychical\nresearcher is to adopt definitions of the kind proposed recently by\nMr George E. Hughes in a critical notice^ of Rosalind Heywood's\nTelepathy and Allied Phenomena. The statistical type of experi-\nment in psychical research is designed to exclude the null hypo-\nthesis that no significant differences can be detected between our\ntwo samples, i.e. that the samples could have been randomly\ndrawn from the same population and differ only by accidents of\nsampling. Precognition in the experimental situation, therefore,\nshould be defined in terms of the 'greater-than-chance coinci-\ndences' between the pronouncements or actions of a percipient and\ncertain facts 'normally inaccessible' to him at the moment the\npronouncements are made or the actions executed. We can\nadopt operational definitions of 'normal access' to distinguish\n'autoscopic' precognition (i.e. foreknowledge of events in one's\nmonition remarks that the possible telekinetic stopping of a roulette ball\nat a number which has been previously announced should be taken into\nconsideration in discussing certain cases of precognition. He refers to an\ninteresting experiment described by Dr Ochorowicz in the Annates des\nSciences Psychiques, 1909-10. In the cases reported by Professor G.\nHulin of Ghent {Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XI, Part 29, pp. 545-7), the per-\ncipients drew numbers from an urn. It may be argued that, assuming\nwe have something more than 'chance coincidences', non-precognitive\nESP without PK would suffice as an explanation of the choice of a\npreviously announced number. But how could the percipient be sure\nthat the number would not be drawn by somebody else after he had made\nthe ostensible prediction? The interval between the prediction and its\nfulfilment was nearly two months\u2014the report says 'pres de deux mois a\nI'avance'\u2014in the case of Charles-Louis Casset. In principle at least, a\nPK influence on others exercised at a distance would seem to be neces-\nsary. It may be said that the cases are too few and too inadequately\nreported to aflFord a basis for theoretical discussions. But the possible\nextensions of the PK hypothesis must be visualized by psychical re-\nsearchers.\n^ See my note in Mind, Vol. LVIII, No. 230 (April 1949), pp. 218-21.\n^ Mind, Vol. LVIII, No. 229 (January 1949), pp. 109-10.\ntelef\nine;\noftl\n(fial\ncogr\ntlie\nexcl\nsucl\nlei\nBra;\nPro,\nmoi\ncase\ntov\nlive\nrare\nimf\n\f1951] ' A Note on Precognition 51\n1\nown life, including here all those things about which one receives\nverbal reports of any sort) from 'non-autoscopic' precognition, and\ntelepathic from clairvoyant precognition. The considerations will\napply mutatis mutandis to simultaneous and post-cognitive tele-\npathy and clairvoyance.\nMr Mundle complains that definitions in terms of 'extra-chance\nhits' alone will not enable us to distinguish precognition from P K\nin experimental situations. Surely his own admirable treatment\nof the data suggests a way out of the difficulty. There may be\nqualitative and quantitative peculiarities associated with pre-\ncognitive 'hits' and 'misses' that are absent in the class of cases in\nwhich P K presumably operates. A significant feature of Caring-\nton's experiments, as Mr Mundle remarks, was the temporal\nclustering of the 'extra-chance hits' more or less symmetrically\naround the occasions on which certain drawings were displayed.\nWhile Professor Bartlett has raised some technical questions about\nthe evaluation of the 'dispersed hits' in Dr Soal's experiments,\nthere is a suggestion that, in experimental situations designed to\ntest ESP, 'fore-hits' and 'back-hits' occur together in ways that do\nnot seem to be characteristic of the 'PK effect'.\nMr Mundle's definition of precognition leaves out the element\nof 'knowing' or 'believing'. Such a feature must, of course, be\nexcluded when we are trying to define precognition as behaviour-\nistically as possible in experimental situations. But is it altogether\nunrepresentative of cases of spontaneous precognition, as Mr\nMundle seems to imply? The problem was discussed by Pro-\nfessors Broad and Price at the Joint Session of the Mind Associa-\ntion and Aristotelian Society in 1937.^ Professor Broad declared\nthat, in most spontaneous cases, precognition was known to be\nsuch only in the light of the later verification. Although it may\nbe bumptious to differ from an authority, I think that Professor\nBroad's remark would not apply to many cases published in the\nProceedings of the S.P.R. A precognition may be a vague pre-\nmonition or presentiment or a quite specific prediction. ^ The\ncases of ostensible premonition in which the percipient took steps\nto ward off an impending danger most definitely imply the cogni-\ntive attitudes of 'expectation' and 'belief '.^ We have also those\nrare instances in which a year, a month, and a day were indelibly\nimpressed on a dreamer who woke up with the inexplicable con-\n* Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume XVI, pp. 216-17, 232-3.\n^Mrs Sidgwick, Proc.

At the moment the precognition was fulfilled or was\nabout to be fulfilled, there occurred a sensation du dejd vu ; the\nwhole scene seemed oddly familiar to the percipient.^ I quite\nrealize that, in view of all that orthodox psychologists have said\nabout 'false recognition' or 'paramnesia', the dejd vu cannot serve\nas evidence for supernormal non-inferential precognition. But\nwhere an 'extra-chance' element is regarded as most likely on\nother grounds, the dejd vu is not without its possible theoretical\nsignificance. We have, then, two seemingly discrepant facts. On\nthe one hand, an image arising spontaneously in the mind is\nregarded as ^re-cognitive rather than as re?ro-cognitive. On the\nother hand, the situation in which the ostensible precognition\nfinds its fulfilment seems oddly familiar to the subject, as if he has\nalready been in it.\nA hypothesis of great value in trying to assimilate precognition\nwas hinted at by F. W. H. Myers^ and elaborated by H. F. Salt-\nmarsh.^ Its importance for psychical researchers has been stressed\nby Soal and Goldney.* Saltmarsh groped for a solution of the\nproblem in terms of a 'saddleback' theory of the 'specious present'.\nLet us suppose that the 'maximal degree of psychological pre-\nsentedness' in the 'specious present' tails off to zero in two\nintrinsically opposite directions corresponding to our empirical\n'past' and empirical 'future'. To account for the ostensive\ncognition of a distant 'future event', we have to extend the 'spec-\nious present' beyond its hitherto acknowledged narrow limits.\nSaltmarsh argued that there may be a 'subliminal' awareness of a\n'specious present' much longer than the one with which we are\nfamiliar in ordinary experience. On this supposition, we can\naccount for the cognitive attitudes of 'expectation' and 'belief\narising in connexion with the emergence of spontaneous pre-\ncognition and also the dejd vu which occurs when the precognition\nis fulfilled. Ex hypothesi, an experience that has been lived\nthrough in the 'subliminal' mind comes to the surface, but it lies\nbeyond the 'supraliminal present' in the direction corresponding\nto the empirical 'future'. The fact that ostensible precognition\n^ For illustrations, see Mrs Sidgwick, loc. cit., pp. 314-17, 328, 346-7,\nand Myers, loc. cit., pp. 491-2, 495, 504-5, 533.\n^ loc. cit., pp. 342-4.\n^Proc.

Saltmarsh's\nstatistical treatment of cases of spontaneous precognition^ and j\nrecent psycho-analytical studies^ suggest that precognition, even if !\n]\nit is ostensive, has to negotiate a 'barrier' of some kind before\n'\nmanifesting itself at the empirical level of observation. The signifi-\n*\ncant precognitive 'misses', for which statistical evidence is accumu-\nlating, may have their origin in an unusual amount of psychological\n'resistance' encountered at the 'barrier' which necessitates a\n|\n'subliminal' substitution of items paranormally known to be f\n'wrong' for items paranormally known to be 'right'. I may refer\n\"\nin this connexion to some valuable observations made by Dr Soal ^\nin his recent experiments with Mrs Stewart.^ The tendency for '\n'\ntelepathic precognition and retrocognition to occur, sometimes \\\ntogether, in the experimental situation, receives a suggestive inter-\npretation on Saltmarsh's hypothesis if we suppose that telepathic \"\ninteraction takes place between 'subliminal selves' with 'specious \"\npresents' extending beyond their ordinarily recognized limits in\nthe two directions corresponding to empirical 'past' and 'future'. '\nThe pattern of the paranormal response emerging at the empirical '\nlevel of observation (e.g. the inverted U-shaped curve in Caring- '\nton's experiments) may be determined not only by 'subliminal\nspecious presents', but by the time-units (seconds, minutes, or i\n{'\nhours) employed by the experimenter and the psychological\n'\nrhythms of 'supraliminal' minds. The entire terrestrial life of a [\nman, for aught we know, may constitute the 'specious present' of\nhis 'subliminal self. Of very great significance for this speculation\nare those cases of spontaneous 'autoscopic' precognition in which ^\nthe percipient enacts a scene in the remote future, experiencing ^\nhallucinations that are almost like percepts. In a case published '\nby Dame Edith Lyttelton*\u2014I have referred to it in an earlier\nfootnote\u2014the percipient had a 'vision' of a fireplace in front of\nwhich stood two men, both dark. She noticed that one of them ^\nhad beautiful teeth. They were talking. A fair man, whose face j\nshe could not see, walked across. She was so anxious to see him n\n1 Proc.

The whole scene came to hfe many years later in a\nClub in Central India. She started forward to see the fair man\nand knocked into a stranger. At the time of the 'vision', the Club\nhouse had not been built and the two men had been boys at Eton.\nThe percipient's testimony was corroborated by her sister and a\nfriend. There is a correspondence between these cases of 'pre-\nvision' and the cases of 'hypermnesia'^ in which the subject\n're-experiences' the 'past' with a wealth of detail arguing for\nsomething more than mere 'memory'.\nMany cases of spontaneous precognition lend support to the\nhypothesis that telepathic interaction occurs between 'subliminal\nselves' with 'extended specious presents'. Discussing the case of\nMrs Schweizer,^ Saltmarsh remarks^ that the details are 'utterly\ninexplicable unless we adopt the rather unlikely hypothesis that\nthe precognition occurred in the first place to Mr Deverell and\nnever reached his normal consciousness, but was transmitted tele-\npathically to Mrs Schweizer, and that the detail of the name,\n\"Henry Irvin\", was added as a sort of extra identification'. I do\nnot quite understand why Saltmarsh regarded this as a 'rather\nunlikely hypothesis'. Telepathic interaction at a 'subliminal\nlevel' may be the rule rather than the exception. As Deverell was\nan eye-witness of the accident which killed Frederick Schweizer,\nhis 'subliminal specious present' would have included the details\nabout the fall, etc.\nDeverell's personal encounter with Mrs Schweizer might have\nbeen anticipated by a telepathic interaction of their selves at a\n'subliminal level'. Apropos of a well-known case* in which the\nDuchess of Hamilton was the percipient, Saltmarsh^ says that\n'There seems to be no reason whatever why this scene should have\nbeen foreseen by the Duchess. It looks like a perfectly meaning-\nless and sporadic happening.'

The 'personality linkages' seem to have been all in favour\nof such a hypothesis. Cooper was on friendly terms with the Duke\nand the Duchess, and moreover was attending the Duke in a\nprofessional capacity. I shall not list here all the cases which can\nbe dealt with along these lines. I shall merely indicate the sort of\nspeculative analysis that can be undertaken. The telepathic\nsituation described by Hubert Wales in the Proceedings^ of the\nS.P.R. involved ostensible retrocognition^ as well as ostensible\nprecognition.^ In the Gordon Davis case* arguing for telepathic\ninteraction, there were curious features suggesting that Davis's\n'supraliminal' awareness focussed on the empirical 'present' (a\nvisit to the neighbourhood of the Eastern Esplanade, an interview\nwith Mr Short at the Marine Parade, etc.) was embedded in a\n'subliminal' awareness of the 'co-conscious' variety extending into\nDavis's empirical 'future' as well as his empirical 'past'.^\nIt is also worth noticing that, in some alleged instances of tele-\npathy from 'discarnate minds', queer 'temporal displacements'\noccurred. Mrs Piper's control 'G.P.' sometimes referred to\nempirically 'past' happenings as if they were contemporaneous\nevents. A very odd circumstance is set down in Nea Walker's\nThe Bridget During a sitting with Mrs Warren Elliott, a '\ncom-\nmunicator' referred to a trivial event that happened three or four\ndays later in language that implied it was already 'past'.

Mr Wales remarks that, assuming a telepathic connexion, the\ntransmission or the emergence of thought was sometimes 'apparently\nconsiderably deferred' (p. 145). In case XXXVI, the only unity of the\ntelepathic impressions was provided by Mr Wales's drawing-room seen\nin a 'retrospective vision', as it were.\n* Ibid., pp. 200-208.\n*Proc.

Dr Soal draws our attention to the fact that,\nduring the sitting with Mrs Blanche Cooper on January 4, Playle was\nmentioned as an old school friend of Davis. Davis's diary showed that on\nJanuary 6 he had an interview with Playle. It is necessary to realize\nthat, in laboratory investigations of precognition, the subject's interest\nis focussed on small units of behaviour. The experimenter can seldom\nuse a time-unit longer than a few hours without relaxing his 'control'.\nOutside the laboratory, we usually think in terms of larger chronological\nunits (days, weeks, months) which derive their significance from the\nconcrete events of our lives. Cases of spontaneous precognition seem to\nrefer to these larger units.\n* Cassell, 1927, pp. 285-6.\n\f195 1] A Note on Precognition 517\npuzzling explanation : 'I myself have often thought that your next\nweek is sometimes our today'.^ All this may be dismissed as\n'non-evidential' stuff, but I submit that it is quite in keeping v^^ith\nthe hypothesis of an 'extended subliminal present'. So is an\ni\nincident discussed by Mr J. G. Piddington in his elaborate\nattempt^ to refute the hypothesis of telepathy inter vivos as an\nexplanation of the 'one-horse dawn' scripts. He argued that the\nappropriate contexts to the allusions in the script could be found\nonly in the Oedipus Coloneus of Sophocles and in Sir Richard\nJebb's notes thereon and that this pointed to 'discarnate inter-\nvention', since the intentional organization of the material could\nnot, in the specific circumstances, be plausibly attributed either\nto the experimenter (Dr A. W. Verrall) or the automatist (Mrs A.\nW. Verrall). In a further note,^ Mr Piddington maintained that at\nleast one day, or perhaps several days, before Dr Verrall began the\n'one-horse dawn' experiment, a cryptic reference was made, in\nMrs Verrall's script, to the quotation of a Juvenal passage in\nJebb's notes. He conjectured that Dr Verrall might have carried\nout an experiment that a 'discarnate intelligence' had devised and\nimposed on him. But, on the 'communicator' hypothesis, may we\nI not suppose that the 'praecox olea' ('precocious olive') of Mrs\nI\nVerrall's script was a precognitive insight into Dr Verrall's mind as\nwell as design? So experienced an investigator as Mr Kenneth\nRichmond indulged in a not dissimilar speculative flight after\nanalysing the evidence of intention in the book-test material\nsupporting the 'La Vita Nuova' case.* It may be my fancy. But I\ndo think that the allusions to the 'herb moly' in the 'one-horse\ndawn' scripts go deeper than the hypothesis of 'buried memories'\nor 'cryptomnesia'. The associations of the Comus passage^ linking\nit with Dr Verrall, Mrs Verrall, and Dr Benson of Wellington\nCollege hint, though obscurely, at a 'past' which is not 'dead' and\nis far different from any stored-up 'mnemic traces'. A 'sub-\nliminal specious present' may serve at least as a guess at the truth\nabout complex telepathic situations which prima facie involve\n'discarnate' as well as 'incarnate' minds.\nFrom the standpoint of psychical research, there is a great deal\n^Proc.

The significant negative scoring on both\n- 1 and + 1 displacements has continued. It will be seen (if a\ncomparison be made with the first report) that the P figure for\n'these - I and +1 negative deviations has diminished from -004\nto -00015 and from -ooi to -00056 respectively. The very close\nconformity of the direct hits with chance expectation has also been\n1 maintained.\nThe persistent displacement negative scoring is very puzzling.\nIt is a very small effect\u2014the average deviation from chance\nexpectation per run is only -0-12 for -i and -o-ii for +1\ndisplacements\u2014and it is only its continuance over a large number\nof runs that raises it to significance. It is important to ascertain\nwhether the eflPect is a genuine phenomenon and not merely a\nstatistical artifact ; the analysis is being pursued in order to\nI determine this. In order to obtain further data, I shall be glad\nif any who can take part in these Home ESP Experiments will get\nI into touch with me (at 6 Ditton Grange Close, Ditton Hill, Surrey)\nand also if any who have already received packs of cards and score-\nsheets will continue the tests and let me have the results, no\n(matter how insignificant they may appear to be.\nAs mentioned above, one percipient has produced strikingly\nabnormal scores. In his first 400 trials he scored 190 hits against\na chance expectation of 80\u2014which gives a fantastic critical ratio\nof 13-75 (P is electronically small!). In his g-izth runs he made\nsuccessively 16, 18, 22, and 20 hits. I doubt if anyone in this\ncountry has ever before, in experiments with ESP cards, scored\n22 hits in 25 trials. I had an opportunity of meeting this per-\ncipient, and the agent and experimenter. They are all trained\nphysicists and I, personally, was satisfied that the conditions under\nwhich the experiments were being conducted were reasonably\ngood. Random numbers were used to determine the order of the\ncards guessed in a variant of Dr Soal's technique. Since my visit\nthe percipient has suddenly begun scoring negatively\u2014but still\nsignificantly. His latest 200 trials give a C.R. of - 2-65 (P = -008).\nThe experiments are continuing.\nA disconcerting discovery is that one percipient is sometimes\nscoring significantly on the 'wrong' pack. In one instance her\n; score was normal on the pack actually being turned up by the\nagent but significant (C.R. = 3-4, P= -00068) on the next pack\nalready prepared for use. That appears to be a forward displace-\nment effect of a whole pack (25 cards) at a time. One is dismayed\nat the prospect of the re-examination of the 3,694 runs so far\nrecorded in order to determine whether the occurrence is an\nisolated freak!\nI\n\f520 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [nov.\nFinally, I think it is advisable to repeat a sentence from the\npreliminary report : 'As the experiments were not supervised, it\nis, of course, legitimate only to regard the results as suggestive,\nhowever significant they may appear statistically.'\nAN ESP EXPERIMENT WITH A DOUBLE\nTARGET\nBy G. W. Fisk and D. J. West\nThis experiment failed to yield evidence of any ESP effects,\nbut a brief summary is reported here to illustrate a particular line\nof investigation.\nTen of the subjects who had taken part in G.W.F.'s Home-\nTesting experiments (reported in the Journal for January-\nFebruary 1 95 1, No. 662) acted as percipients in these tests. Some\nwere chosen because their results seemed promising ; others\nbecause they were available.\nThe subjects were each sent a different set of sixteen sealed\npacks of E SP cards and were allotted a different time for recording\ntheir guesses. They were told that at the specified time G.W.F.\nwould 'concentrate' on the target cards in his home while they\n'concentrated' on the sealed packs. The subjects presumed that\nthe sealed packs contained cards in the same order as the targets\nin G.W.F.'s home, but in fact this was not so. The sealed packs\nwere randomised by D.J.W. and their order was unknown to\nG.W.F. The purpose was to find out which would prove the\nmore effective target, the cards in the subject's possession or the\ncards being looked at by G.W.F.\nThe question, unfortunately, was not answered, for the results\nshowed no significant correspondence between the subjects'\nguesses, taken as a whole or individually, and either of the two\npossible targets.\nSUMMARY OF SCORES\n(4000 trials)\nOn Sealed Targets On Fisk Targets\nTotal hits scored by subjects - - 790 786\nChance expectation - - - - 800 ,\n. 800\nDeviation - -10 -14\n\fHow do Birds Navigate? 521\n- HOW DO BIRDS NAVIGATE?\nA Review of Further Experiments\nBy A. J. C. Wilson\nTwo years ago I read a paper to the Society (printed in the\nJournal, VoL 35, pp. 30-6) on theories of bird navigation, with\nspecial reference to that of Professor H. L. Yeagley.^ He sug-\ngested that homing pigeons recognize (i) their latitude, and (ii)\nthe vertical component of the earth's magnetic field, and fly\ntowards familiar values of these variables. They could thus\nnavigate towards home over completely unfamiliar territory, and\nwould need to make use of landmarks for the last 20 or 30 miles\nonly. The suggested method (Coriolis acceleration) by which the\nbirds could recognize latitude came in for severe criticism, and\nbiologists in general were unwilling to accept the evidence of the\nexperiments he devised and carried out to test his theory. These,\nhowever, seemed more successful than would be expected if his\ntheory were entirely wrong, and one therefore turns with interest\nto his second paper.^ I should say immediately that in reading this\none experiences the kind of disappointment so familiar in psychical\nresearch. A line of investigation yields promising but not con-\nclusive results when first taken up, and when continued the further\nresults can only be described as still promising and still incon-\nclusive.\nProfessor Yeagley recognizes the force of some of the objections\nurged against the Coriolis-acceleration suggestion, and acknow-\nledges the help that shore lines may give to birds in suitable\nlocalities (what he calls 'pilotage', as distinct from 'navigation'),\nbut describes a further six experiments in support of the general\ncorrectness of his theory. These fall into three groups : (i) a\nrepetition of the experiment of attaching magnets to the pigeons'\nwings, (ii) further experiments on the conjugate-point idea, and\n(iii) following groups of three to ten birds by aeroplane.\nThe repetition of the magnetic-wing experiment can only be\ncalled a failure. Most of the birds went well east of their objective,\nwhether they were provided with magnets, or with copper plates,\nor were without attachment. Professor Yeagley is inclined to\nconnect this with magnetic disturbances on the day of the experi-\nment, but it is astonishing that it was not tried again when con-\nditions had become normal. An independent magnetic-wing\n^ Henry L. Yeagley, 'A Preliminary Study of a Physical Basis of Bird\nNavigation. Parti.' J. Applied Physics, iS, 1947, 1025-63,\n^ Ibid., Part II. jl. Applied Physics, 22, 746-60.\n\f522 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [NOV.\nexperiment by Professor Gordon^ was also inconclusive ; all birds\nreached home within a few hours of release. Perhaps the dis-\ntances involved (36-58 miles, compared with Yeagley's 92) were\ntoo small to give any discrimination.\nThe conjugate-point experiments, taken singly, were about as\nconvincing as that described in my previous review. Lumped\ntogether, the evidence looks more impressive. A total of 671 birds\nwas released in seven experiments (three described in his first paper,\nfour in his second), and on the average the birds flew about 36 miles\nin a direction only 3-2\u00b0 from that to be expected on Professor\nYeagley's theory. The probability of the direction being so nearly\nright by chance is, I suppose, 3-27180\u00b0, or less than 0-02.\nThe experiment of following birds by aeroplane has been tried\npreviously by Grifiin and Hock {see Jourrial, Vol. 35, p. 31) with\ngannets released inland ; these sea birds seemed to fly at random\ntill they reached a coast line. In Professor Yeagley's experiments\ninvolving 31 groups of birds, 8 groups flew more or less\ndirectly in the expected direction, 2 groups flew in the directly\nopposite direction, 2 made more or less continuous circling\nmovements without getting far, and the rest flew in more or less\nirregular polygonal curves. The pilot of the aeroplane observed\nthat the pigeons seemed to follow mountain ridges for some time\nbefore summoning sufficient resolution to fly up and over them,\nand to go out of their way to circle over towns before continuing\non their route.\nAs mentioned earlier, these results cannot be described as more\nthan promising, and worth following up.

By M. M. Moncrieff. Foreword by H. H. Price.\nLondon, Faber, 195*1. 315 pp. 21s.\nThis is an interesting book, as the author has made a detailed\nexamination of one particular way of developing Bergson's\nsuggestion that the function of the central nervous system is in\nthe main eliminative and not productive. Captain Moncrieff first\nanalyses the current theories of perception, paying particular\nattention to vision. He demonstrates their various weaknesses\nfrom the point of view of plain observation, logic, and neuro-\nphysiology. He then presents his new theory. This suggests\nthat the nervous impulses reaching the cortex from the sense\norgans there 'evoke or release in the mind clairvoyant vision from\npoints of view at each retina of those external material things from\nwhose surfaces are reflected the physical radiations that stimulate\nthe retina' (p. 106). Hence the observer is supposed to look out\nat the outside world from a position just in front of the retina.\nThis allows diseases of the cornea and lens to affect clairvoyant\nvision directly. It appears that the distorted form of the nervous\nstimuli arriving at the cortex consequent on the distortion of the\ncornea and lens bears no relation to the subsequent disordered\nperception of the external world. This latter is due to the direct\ndistortion of clairvoyant vision trying to peer out from its position\njust in front of the retina through the foggy lens of cataract or the\nscarring left by corneal ulcers. It seems to be a necessary con-\nsequence of this theory that diseases of the nervous system proxi-\nmal to the retina should not affect vision. For if we consider the\ncase of a progressive cataract, as long as a glimmer of light can get\nthrough to the retina impulses will reach the cortex and there\nexercise their powers of evocation on the mind. This latter must\nbelong to the 'all-or-none' class of reaction, as the resultant\ndefective vision is held to be due directly to the fact that clair-\nvoyant vision cannot see through the cloudy lens.\nNow, if we consider cases of bilateral vascular lesions of the\nparietal lobe, the nervous impulses reach the cortex correctly\nand any clairvoyant vision released would have a perfect set of\nlenses at its disposal. Yet marked disturbances of space perception\nresult. Thus we are forced to accept that a disordering of the\nelectronic patterns in the brain causes the disorders of space per-\nception directly, which is the very position this theory was designed\nto avoid.\nThe author continues to elaborate his theory with much ingen-\n\f524 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [NOV.\nuity, paying particular attention to optical matters. He gives an\naccount of an interesting series of experiments conducted using a\nPigeon-Cantonnet stereoscope. It is difficult to accept the theory,\nhowever, on account of the large number of phenomena which are\nnot discussed in the book and which would appear to offer in-\nsuperable difficulties. The following are- some of these :\n(1) After-images.\n(2) The neurological condition mentioned above which follows\nbilateral lesions of the parietal cortex. In this condition the\npatient cannot estimate distance, and out of a multiplicity of\nobjects can never see more than one or two at a time. Right and\nleft orientation is entirely lost, and he cannot tell whether an\nobject is receding or approaching. Vision in depth is, however,\nmaintained and the patient remains keenly aware of his dis-\nabilities.\n(3) The formed visual hallucinations (of people talking to-\ngether, etc.) produced by stimulating the temporal cortex in\ncertain conditions where this part of the brain is unstable.\n(4) The marked changes in the perceived world produced by\nmescaline.\n(5) The demonstration by the stroboscope that the visual field\nin consciousness is built up by a scanning mechanism.\nWith regard to (4) and (5) the following extract from Professor\nMeyer-Gross's recent article (' Artificial psychoses and other\nmental abnormalities produced by drugs'. British Medical\nJournal, 11 August 195 1) is of interest :\n\"\nWithin the field of vision the drug [mescaline] interferes with the\nstillness and movements of objects. The remarkable mechanism by\nwhich we normally see things fixed and of persistent shape seems to\nbreak down in the intoxication. The process of perceiving and of\npicturing our surroundings at an instantaneous glance is disturbed,\nprobably slowed down, and we observe the scanning of the picture in\nprogress. (My italics).\nThe chief value of this interesting book lies in the author's keen\ncriticisms of the current theories of perception.\nJ. R. Smythies\nSecond Sight in Daily Life. By W. H. W. Sabine. London,\nAllen & Unwin, 1951. 208 pp. 12s. 6d.\nThe author, an Englishman now resident in the United States,\nhas for over twenty years followed the commendable practice of\nrecording in his diary all instances in which there seemed to him\nto be a significant connexion between his dreams or waking\n\f195 1] Reviews 525\nexperiences and events of which he had no normal knowledge and\nwhich he could not rationally infer at the time of his experience.\nAs he is well read in the literature of psychical research, and alive\nto the bearing on his experiences of other schools of psychology,\ngreat interest attaches to his comments and to the theory which he\npropounds.\nHe argues that there is a much larger precognitive element in\ndreams and in waking experiences than is generally recognized,\nand discusses various causes for the prevalent under-estimate.\nThus, the connexion between experience and event may fail to be\nrecognized owing to the symbolic presentation of the event to the\npercipient's conscious mind. Or it may be overlooked because the\npercipient, if he is on the watch for possible fulfilment, is expecting\nit to take the form of a more important event than actually occurs ;\nor, again, because he does not realize that the connexion, if any,\nmay be not between his earlier experience and some subsequent\nexternal event, but between two experiences of his own of which\nthe second consists of, say, hearing or reading a perhaps inaccurate\naccount of an event in the external world. Or it may be that a\nsignificant connexion is observed, but owing to a bias in favour\nof telepathy, factors in the case pointing to precognition may be\noverlooked.\nEven where the manifest content of a dream corresponds\nclosely with some contemporary event not normally known to the\ndreamer, it is difficult to be sure that there has been any form of\nparanormal activity, owing to the frequency of dreams and the\nmultiplicity of incidents, some one of which might fortuitously\ncorrespond. It is in fact only when the manifest content of the\ndream and of the event are very unusual, and the correspondence\nbetween them exceedingly close, that a paranormal explanation\nseems to have any validity except for the dreamer.\nBut if things happen in this order : (i) a dream or other ex-\nperience, (2) an external event not on the face of it closely corre-\nsponding to the experience, (3) the percipient's acquaintance with\nthe event by some normal means (e.g. a newspaper account of it),\n(4) a retrospective interpretation of the experience, possibly a\nsymbolic interpretation made by the percipient in the light of (3),\nthe scope both of chance coincidence and of subjectivity is greatly\nextended, and the case for paranormality proportionately weakened.\nThe interpretations of his experiences given by Mr Sabine seem\nto me in general tenable, but not so certainly and uniquely the\nright ones as to make one say at once, '\nOf course, that experience\nforeshadowed that event! '\nBut the cases he cites are interesting\nand his comments are instructive.\nThe latter part of the book is devoted to a criticism of current\n\f526 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [nov.\ntheories regarding precognition, and a statement of the author's\nown hypothesis. He is dissatisfied, for reasons which he gives,\nwith all explanations based on a two-dimensional view of time.\nHe suggests that both the act of precognition and the physical\nperception of the fulfilment are acts of memory of a '\nBasic\nExperience '\nantecedent to both.\nThe process . . . may be set out in its entirety as follows :\n'\n'\nA. Basic experience.\nB. Basic memory.\nC. Basic memory intermittently transferred to Conscious Memory\n(Precognition).\nD. Physical experience.\nE. Conscious Memory of '\nD ', which may be observed to corre-\nspond to '\nC '.\n(p. 180.)\nThe author regards the Basic experience as '\nan experience\nsolely in the sphere of thought ', and not attempting to define it,\nadds :\nThe most that can be said, and speaking in relation to the problem under\ndiscussion, is that a Basic experience is an experience of the mind, one\nwhich, when transferred to the conscious memory, constitutes Pre-\ncognition of later experiences through the physical sense organs,\n(p. 181.) J 1 ,t\nIt will be seen that Mr Sabine has difficulty not only in defining\nthe Basic experience, which is the central point of his theory, but\nin offering the reader more than the vaguest notion of it. This is\nnot due to any failure on his part to analyse the available evidence,\nbut to the fact that at present the available evidence is too scanty.\nApart from his own careful records, there are a number of pub-\nlished spontaneous cases, not all particularly cogent ; if dreams\nare omitted from the calculation, rather a small number, as\nSaltmarsh's Foreknozvledge shows. If we turn to the results of\nexperiment, we find a large number of successes, obtained under\ngood conditions indeed, but with few subjects. Many more good\ncases, and successes with many more experimental subjects, seem\nto me desirable before we plunge further into a morass of specula-\ntive theory, where nothing seems certain except that all our every-\nday matter-of-fact notions are wrong.\nW. H. S.\nMors et Vita. Introduction par Gabriel Marcel ; textes et\ndocument reunis par Robert Aron et Jean-Claiide Renard.\nParis, Plon, 1951. 290 pp. 360 fr.\nThis book is a collection from a number of authors of evidence\non survival provided by psi phenomena. The cases quoted have\n\f1951] Reviews 527\nall been published before and many are taken from S.P.R. sources.\nVarious theories on the subject, including that of Whately\nCarington, are discussed.\nIts main interest for psychical researchers lies in the intro-\nduction by Gabriel Marcel, the eminent French philosopher who\nhas recently given the Gifford Lectures in Aberdeen. He regrets\nthe 'incredible bad faith' of philosophers on the Continent, and\nparticularly in France, in refusing even to consider the possibility\nof psi, but he acclaims what he calls the infinitely more open-\nminded and honest attitude of the Anglo-Saxons. This ostrich-\nlike attitude of philosophers he puts down partly to the pretention\nthat humanity is already sufficiently adult to comprehend its\nsurroundings, and partly to the fear of falling to a sub-human level\nor of being forced to doubt certain postulates which seem neces-\nsary to an intelligible order of things.\nHe finds the Anglo-Saxons too inclined to confine themselves to\nthe collection of facts and, while expressing himself with great\ncaution about the origins of psi phenomena, he considers it high\ntime that more study was given to their implications.\nWisdom, Madness and Folly : the Philosophy of a Lunatic. By\nJohn Custance. Foreword by Canon L. W. Grensted.\nLondon, Gollancz, 195 1. 254 pp. i6s.\nIn this book the philosophy forms the major contribution in what\nis surely the most comprehensive subjective study of cyclophrenia\nyet produced. It is scarcely possible to do the book justice in a\nreview\u2014another book assessing the various philosophical and\npsycho-pathological concepts might almost be said to be\nnecessary. The play on the negative-positive, the theory of actuality\nagainst a Jungian background, is comprehensively and admirably\narranged, although it is sometimes difficult to maintain the\ndistinction between negative and positive, and, upon occasion, to\nbe certain which one is dealing with.\nCanon Grensted has commented on the apparently unrecog-\nnized trend towards existentialism ;\nnevertheless, the whole work\nis well arranged and remarkably objective considering the sub-\njective nature of its inspiration. Obviously, Mr Custance is a man\nof great intellect and culture, and, although a tremendous biblio-\ngraphy is involved, he has been at pains to maintain readability\nwithout loss of purpose or direction.\nFrom the point of view of the psychiatrist this book reveals far\nmore than similar works\u2014for instance, those of Clifford Beers and\nThe Maniac\u2014for even during periods of mild psychopathy he is\n\f528 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [nov.\nstill able to describe objectively his mental process during periods of\nelation and depression with their accompanying fragmented\ndelusional systems and clang associations. It is here, of course, that\nthe Jungian reveals himself (and it is not surprising that an\nAdlerian approach failed to serve a useful purpose during one of\nhis episodes).\nObviously one reason v^'hy Mr Custance is able to w^rite this\nbook at all is because he has been able to develop philospohical\nand psychological concepts secondary to his command of language\nand imagination, without which intelligence alone would not have\nbeen enough, and without which the manifestations of the\n'collective unconscious' would have remained isolated instead of\nbeing woven into the pattern of 'as if experience. It is interesting\nthat Mr Custance, having been through the 'hell' of depression,\nnow feels able to face the future, in that he is not now terrified of\nfurther depressive illness as formerly.\nOne notices that both Mr Custance and Canon Grensted use the\nword 'lunatic', presumably in their desire not to be mealy-\nmouthed. From the onlooker's point of view it must be recog-\nnized that the words 'lunatic', 'psychopath', and 'neurotic' now\ninvolve unpleasantly tinged concepts of personality whereas, from\nthe therapeutic point of view, it is obviously socially desirable that\nmental illness should not be so contaminated and it would prob-\nably be worth while to eradicate these terms from descriptive\nliterature.\nAs it is, even wit is not denied us ;\nhalfway through the book a\nlitter of pigs is given beautiful names which had to be changed to\n'more prosaic ones suited to the herd book' and later, in a comment\nabout Ashtaroth, there is an aside about ecclesiastics 'without\nmentioning names' who 'may even be worshippers of her cruel\nspouse Moloch'.\nThe appendixes call for brief comment in so far as hospital\nmanagement and treatment are concerned, and nobody would\ndisagree with most of the views expressed. It is notoriously diffi-\ncult to establish culpability when it is suspected and when the\ngreatest efforts are made to prevent collaboration between mem-\nbers of the staff concerned, as I once found as a member of an\nofficial tribunal of inquiry.\nWith regard to the relative values of different forms of treatment,\nit is not possible here to do more than suggest that results differ\nin the hands of different therapists at different times. Weir\nMitchell's own experience of failure only when he began to\nexamine the rationale and effects of treatment is one example, and\nit would hardly be fair to assess the value of two electro-convulsive\ntreatments as against half-a-dozen given during a different episode\n\f195 1] Reviews 529\nin a different hospital by a different therapist, with probably a\ndifferent type of machine.\nIt is altogether a most stimulating and exciting book, which\nwill become a classic.\nLouis Rose\nThe Uncurtained Throne. By Warner Allen. London, Faber,\n1951. 217 pp. I2S. 6d.\nA number of years ago the author of The Uncurtained Throne\nhad a mystical experience which transformed his previous\n'patternless existence' into the state of serene certitude about the\nexistence of God common to mystics of all ages and creeds. After\nfifteen years spent 'in contemplation of this mystery' he wrote two\nbooks. The Timeless Moment and The Happy Issue^ whose argu-\nment, he says, 'started from the central fact of the spiritual\nexperience as an assumed reality transcending logic, and sub-\nordinated to it the experience of the objective self or soul and the\nfacts of the external world.'\nIn The Uncurtained Throne he reverses this argument, 'moving\nfrom scientific experiment to spiritual experience and seeking to\nprove the truth that science denies from the facts that science\naffirms'. Among those facts he cites the findings of psychical\nresearch.\nHis success in this aim is still likely to depend on the previous\nattitude of the reader. A young mathematician recently had an\nexperience similar to Mr Allen's, and\u2014much to his astonishment,\nfor he was quite ignorant of mystical literature\u2014he also found his\nattitude changed in a split second from agnosticism to blissful\ncertainty. His subsequent comment about the thesis of this book\nwas a placid, 'Of course.' It is safe to say that with his type of\nmind his comments before the experience\u2014which he, like others,\ninsisted was impossible to describe\u2014would have been un-\nprintable.\nThe mystic shares this language difficulty with humbler\npsychics, though he more often escapes another : that of confound-\ning the image through which an experience may be recorded\nwith the experience itself. To do this may lead both percipient\nand researcher astray if only because one image may symbolise a\nnumber of things and a number of images may be used to convey\none experience.\nBooks like The Uncurtained Throne are only likely to be of\nBoth published by Faber.\n\f530 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [nov.\ninterest to the psychical researcher who constantly bears such\ndifficulties of language and imagery in mind.\nR. H.\nJournal of the American Society for Psychical Research.\nVol. 45, No. 3, July 1951. New York, A.S.P.R. $1.50.\nI did not do justice to a paper by C. M. Cooper, M.D. in the\nOctober 1950 issue of the Journal, and a new report from his pen\nin the July 1951 issue gives me an excuse to refer back to it.\nCooper has used a similar approach to both his problems\n\u2014\nthat of self-observation. His handling of this simplest of tools is\nvery effective and we can all profit from it.\nHis first paper, rather cumbrously entitled 'An Inherited\nBaffling Perception and its Uncovering', deals with three spon-\ntaneous experiences which Cooper had as a young medical\ngraduate, and which he formerly attributed to a psychic gift\ninherited from his mother.\nIncident No. 3 may be summarised here. Cooper had been\nsitting for half an hour in the staff quarters of the Royal Infirmary\nof Edinburgh when a house physician entered. Glancing casually\nat him Cooper exclaimed, 'Forbes, whatever made you quarrel\nwith your head nurse?' With some resentment Forbes admitted\nthe quarrel.\nCooper 'uncovers' his perception in this way : 'Casually looking\nup, I saw that Forbes, . . . had entered . . . He skirted the end of\nthe big centre table, picked up a pitcher of water, and began to fill\na glass. In doing it he turned, so that I got a clear view of his face.\nIt was much redder than usual . . . He is both perturbed and\nangry, I subconsciously divined ... he must have quarelled with\nsomeone. With his chief? No, he would be more perturbed but\nnot so angry. With a student? No, he might be as angry but he\nwould not be so perturbed. It must have been with an equal.\nWho is there in his ward, from which he has evidently just come,\nwho to all intents and purposes in his equal? The head nurse.'\nThe other two incidents he presents and explains in like manner.\nBut there is a weak point. Cooper developed the denouements\nsome years after the occurrences.\nSceptics are never tired of rubbing in the warning that\nbecause memory of a given event is vivid and distinct it does not\nfollow that it is accurate. If we apply this criterion to allegedly\npsychic cases, we must apply it with equal rigour to alleged\nexposures. We may accept the plausibility of Cooper's explana-\ntions but we must reserve judgement on the accuracy of such\n\figji] Reviews 53^\ndetailed analysis long after the event. Further, the present account\n(some years later still) seems to be the first written one.\nWhat is important in Cooper's work is the principle he thus\nestablished (and now practises)\u2014that a 'hunch', intuition, or\npremonition, should always be followed by a spell of acute intro-\nspective concentration before any claims are made for it. 'In\nplaying games', Dr Cooper writes, 'I would come to know, without\nknowing how I knew, where a key card or domino lay, . . . what\nfaulty bid or play [an opponent] would make if given the oppor-\ntunity. Always in such cases the uncovered key to the discern-\nment was the subconscious registering and correct interpretation\nof an involuntary behaviour reaction on the part of the individual\nconcerned.'\n'Self-Experimentation in Water Divining' is the title of Dr\nCooper's second paper. Cooper and his brother both exhibited\nthe dowsing reaction. Cooper began 'to toy with the twig, and to\ntry to make it behave as it seemingly behaved of itself . . . keeping\nthe wrists and elbows slack, I separated the ends of the prongs\nsufficiently to produce a decided tension where they join. I then\nwith the fingers and forearms rotated the prongs downward and\ninward. At once the stem began to dip. As I continued to rotate\nthe prongs, the twig dipped more and more, and then quite\nsuddenly the rod itself took command and jerked my hands\ndownward, stretching the wrists'.\nCooper now propounds the interesting theory that the dowsing\nreaction is a function of the anatomy and gait of the dowser. As\nfar as I know this is new. '\nI am sway-backed, and as I walk I\nproject my body forw^ard and brace back my shoulders. This\ncarries my elbows backward, upward, and outward. As this occurs\nmy forearms pronate. The result of these movements is that I\nproduce a decided tension where the prongs join, and also rotate\nthem. This causes the stem of the rod to begin to dip. I grip\ntighter to stop the movement, but in so doing I automatically\nfurther pronate and hence without realising it, increase the force\nthat is causing the movement.'\nAfter describing the results of holding the twig in a different\nfashion and of using other dowsing implements. Cooper refers to\nexperiments in approaching a pail of water from various distances.\nHe observed that he held the prongs very slackly until he ap-\nproached to a certain distance from the pail, then he subconsciously\ntightened his grip, thus alerting his muscles, and giving the dows-\ning reaction.\nCooper concludes that water divining is a spurious^ pheno-\n^ It has been brought to my notice that certain dowsers have been of-\nfended by my use of the word '\nspurious '\nin an earlier review. It should\nII\n\f532 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [nov.\nmenon\u2014that the employment of the dowsing reaction in the loca-\ntion of water in his own case depends on his ability to read terrain,\n'and that those professional dowsers who possess a marked flair in j\nthis direction would achieve a correspondingly high percentage\nof dowsing successes'. Cooper's own experiments, however, can i\nhardly rank higher than a pointer to such a generalisation. !\nThe other papers in the July issue are '\nA Series of Spontaneous j\nCases in the Tradition of Phantasms of the Living' by L.

This may be because\nthe evidence is not as yet good enough. The evidence for any\nphenomena we are trying to prove must be considerably greater if\nthey are in disagreement with previously accepted ideas than if\nthey are in agreement with these ideas. These ideas are not\nusually accepted blindly, but because all the available experimental\nevidence points in a particular direction. The philosophers refer\nto the antecedent improbability of a phenomenon in order to\ndescribe this fact. Many of our critics find refuge in this concept\nof antecedent improbability, and to a certain extent legitimately.\nBut many of us suspect that the real stumbling block is blind\nunreasoning prejudice. It is my purpose to suggest a logical\nmethod of distinguishing between the two.\nIf there is an antecedent improbability of a phenomenon like\ntelepathy, it may be stated in exact terms before any experiments\nare considered. One may say, for example, that the antecedent\nimprobability of the phenomenon is iq-^^ to i that the pheno-\nmenon will occur. Then, if we have a statistical experiment, for\nexample, we may consider our case as proved as soon as we have\nantichance odds lo^^ to i. It is no use now for the critic to change\nhardly be necessary to explain that in common scientific usage this epi-\nthet carries no derogatory attributes such as '\ncounterfeit ' or ' fraudulent '.\nA scientist might easily use the word in reference to a facet of his own\nwork, meaning that certain evidence had led him to a wrong conclusion.\n\f1951] Correspondence 533\nhis mind : if he changes his mind, we know that his criticism and\nhis assessment of antecedent improbabihty was unreasoned, and\nwe can therefore ignore it.\nOf course, a critic may not have the mathematical knowledge\nto state the antecedent improbability in the terms we require.\nHe may say, for example, that the effect is about as likely to occur\nas obtaining a bridge hand where every player has a complete\nsuit. The mathematician can soon transpose this into the terms\nrequired for accurate comparison with ESP data. In the example\nquoted the probability is 4! (i3!)*-f-52! that such a bridge hand will\noccur, which is approximately io~'^'. We take this now as the\nantecedent improbability of the phenomenon.\nSoal and Goldney's experiments [Proc. S.P.R., vol. 47, pp. 21-\n150) gave a probability of io~^^ that their results were due to\nchance. If we take the antecedent improbability from the\nexample quoted, we find the a postiori probability from the\nrelation\na postiori probability = experimental probability\nantecedent improbability\n= 10-35\nas the a postiori probability that Soal and Goldney's results were\ndue to chance.\nIt might be interesting here to note the probability, as calculated\nfrom the physical principles of quantum mechanics, of what is\napparently an impossible event. A very slowly moving car, of\nweight I ton, and very small velocity, encounters a bump in the\nroad I foot high and 100 feet long. According to classical physics,\nthe car cannot get past the bump ;\naccording to quantum mechan-\nics there is a small but finite chance of the car being observed at the\nother side of the bump. Calculation gives a probability of io~^^\nfor this event ; not much more improbable than the idea that\nSoal and Goldney's results are due to chance. (This example\nwas taken from notes of lectures given by Professor Enrico\nFermi at the University of Chicago. It should be noted that the\nprobability is zero that the car will be observed on top of the bump;\nit is only finite on the other side.)\nIt must be realized that there may be other objections to the\nexperiments besides the one that the results are due to chance.\nFor example, Soal, Goldney and the whole horde of distinguished\npersons who were brought in as witnesses may have been con-\nspiring to put on a gigantic hoax. Is this likely? Of course the\nanswer to the question, Is it likely or not? is largely a matter of\n\f534 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [nov.\nopinion. Here again the same criterion applies as has been\nenunciated above. The critic must first name a figure, no matter\nhow large, for the probability that this could be so ; after this, he\ncannot legitimately change his mind. The only legitimate time\nfor him to argue about antecedent improbabilities is before the\nexperiment has been carried out, or the results have been made\navailable to him. If now the critic allows that the chances, for\nexample, of 7 people being deceived in 7 different experiments are\nindependent, we can multiply the number of experiments and\nwitnesses until we have a figure sufficiently big to overcome the\nantecedent improbability which he has named.\nUnless the critic complies with the conditions stated above, it\ncan be mathematically proved that he can never be answered. For,\nas soon as a new experiment is performed with sufficient anti-\nchance odds to overcome the antecedent improbability, the critic\nwill change his mind and increase the antecedent improbability.\nThis can proceed ad infinitum. It will be clear to the mathe-\nmatician that the arguments given above are the same as those\nrequired for the convergence of an infinite series.\nThe question of how to combat prejudice when it has been\nrecognized is difficult, and is probably our main task for the future.\nRichard Wilson\nIs PK Guided by Knowledge?\nSir,\u2014Herewith a thought on the problem whether PK must\nbe guided by knowledge of the system to be affected, acquired\neither normally or paranormally.\nOne way of attacking this problem, suggested by Mr C. W. K.\nMundle, is to use as a PK tester two random selectors combined\nwith delay switches, as described in Proc. S.P.R., Part 178, pp.\n67-8, and testing two groups of people with this apparatus. To\none group is explained the modus operandi of the selectors so that\nthey can intelligently direct their act of willing ; the others are\ngiven a simple false explanation so that any effort at directing their\nwilling will be ineffective. Should both groups score equally well,\nit is suggested that the hypothesis that P K is guided by knowledge\nwould suff\"er a severe blow.\nThis is probably the best suggestion so far made on the subject\n;\nbut unfortunately neither this nor any other such experiment can\nbe conclusive. Dr Thouless's experiments on WyK {Proc. S.P.R.,\nPart 179, p. 116), show that if PK is guided by knowledge, then\nthis knowledge need not be sensorily acquired. Presumably the\nfirst group in this experiment could, from the information given\nthem, reason out that a certain part of the mechanism would have\n\f195 1] Correspondence 535\nto be affected in a certain way in order to effect a desired result.\nThe others could discover this either by clairvoyance on the\nmachine (which is most unlikely) or telepathy from the first group ;\nand so we are back where we started. Both groups are equally well\nequipped with the necessary information ; in the first case, this is\nacquired sensorily, and in the second, extra-sensorily.\nFor such a reason, I believe that it can never be experimentally\nproved either that PK is guided by knowledge or not. It seems\nto me, however, that a decision can be reached by theoretical\nargument.\nIf P K is an act of conation (disregarding the question raised on\np. 382 of this volume of the Journal), then I think it consists of at\nleast two processes, that of willing an event to happen and that of\ncausing it to happen, with possibly an intermediate linking process.\nSince the second process or 'force' must be directional, then either\nthe primary act of willing must also be directional (whether it is\nor not being the point in question), or else the intermediate psycho-\nphysical process must transform a vague willing into a directional\ncausing ; and since the intermediate process is at least something\nto do with a department of the agent's mind, this second sugges-\ntion is merely a variant of the first. In the series of processes we\ncall PK, there must at one stage be a process of a directional\nnature and this must be a process to do with the agent and requir-\ning the possession of the relevant knowledge. Otherwise the\n'force' or whatever it is that makes the die come to rest with a\ncertain face uppermost must be made directional independently\nof the agent ; and if so, why have an agent at all? PK would then\nbe little less than an '\nact of God'. All this need not mean that\nthe agent must have a detailed knowledge of the processes causing\nthe occurrence of the event willed. A person moving his arm\nneed have no knowledge of the physiological changes involved in\nbrain, nerves, and muscles ; all he needs to know is that the arm\nmust be moved in a certain direction. In the P K case, all I mean\nto imply is that the agent must know what is to be affected and in\nwhat way. The rest he leaves to the P K equivalents of nerves and\nmuscles.\nTo sum up ;\nmy conclusion is that this problem is incapable of\nexperimental solution, but that it is clear from theoretical argu-\nment that P K must be guided by knowledge, acquired, probably,\nparanormally.\nI wish to thank Mr C.

He was the author of\nseveral books, including New Evidences in Psychical Research (191 1),\nSpiritualism: its Plistory, Phenomena and Doctrine (191 8), znd Experi-\nences zvith Mediums (1934). In a foreword to his Letters from Sir Oliver\nLodge (1932) Lodge wrote that Hill had oifered to help him with his\npsychic correspondence a quarter of a century back, when it was\nbeginning to be heavy, and since then he had acted 'as a sort of amateur\nprivate secretary'.

SMYTHIES'S PAPER\nI\nBy H. H. Price\nPhilosophical readers of Dr J. R. Smythies's very interesting and\nprovocative paper on 'The Extension' of Mind' in the September\n1 95 1 issue of this Journal can hardly fail to feel uneasy about some\nof his contentions ; and in this note I propose to mention some of\nthe difficulties which are likely to occur to them. But I should like\nto say at once that these difficulties must not be taken too seriously.\nIf Dr Smythies's thtovy turns out to be an effective tool of research,\nby all means let us use it as such, whatever epistemological diffi-\nculties there may be in it. He claims himself, in the last sentence\nof his_ paper, that the theory 'suggests a series of experimental\ninvestigations not only for parapsychology but also for physics'\n(p. 502). _\nIf he is right, let us get on with these experimental\ninvestigations. The epistemological mess can be cleared up after-\nwards.\nIn any case, I suspect that the most important and valuable part\nof his theory is logically independent of the epistemological\ndoctrines which I shall criticise presently. If they are false, it\nmight still be true that there is a psyche or psychical mechanism\ndistinct both from the self and from the brain ; that this psychical\nmechanism is spatially extended ; and that the space in which it is\nextended is distinct from physical space, but included along with\nphysical space in a single seven-dimensional manifold. It is true\nthat this idea of a spatially extended psychical mechanism is not\nwholly original. The Sankhya philosophers of ancient India sug-\ngested something very like it some 2,500 years ago. They held\nthat the mind, as opposed to the Self or 'Witness', is an extended\nand material entity, different from the physical organism. But, of\ncourse, they did not have the technical resources of modern g'eo-\n^ 537\n\f538 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JAN.\nmetry at their disposal, as Dr Smythies has. It may well be that\nthis has enabled him to reformulate an ancient idea in a novel and]\nexperimentally-testable form.\nAfter these prefatory remarks, designed to warn the reader\nagainst taking my criticisms too seriously, I proceed to mention\none or two difficulties which I find in Dr Smythies's theory as it\nstands.\nThe first concerns the status which he assigns to the human\nnervous system ('signalling mechanism') or rather to our know-\nledge about it. The science of neurophysiology appears to have\na privileged and almost sacrosanct position in his theory. The\ntrouble, of course, is that human sense-organs and nervous sys-\ntems are themselves parts of the physical world. But, according\nto the theory, no scientist, no matter who he is, has any direct\naccess to the physical world ; and in this respect physiologists are\nno better off than other people. All that any scientist can directly\nobserve is his own perceptual world. Thysical space and physical\nobjects are in fact hypotheses, as we can never observe them\ndirectly' (p. 485 adfin.). But then the human nervous system and\nits signalling mechanism is itself only a hypothesis. Or can it be\nthat physiologists, at any rate in their working hours, are entitled\nto accept the Naive Realist TNS theory, though nobody else is\nentitled to accept it? Do they have a direct access to the physical\nworld itself, which nobody else has.? I am sure that Dr Smythies\nwould not seriously say so. In other places he carefully dis-\ntinguishes between the perceived body and the physical body. Yet\nwhen he is writing about neurophysiology he seems to forget this\ndistinction. He writes as if physiologists were directly aware of\nthe physical bodies of other human beings. And if after all they\nare not, if they can only study their own percepts, and all the\ndetailed information they give us about the structure and working\nof physical nervous systems is only a set of hypotheses, how are\nthese hypotheses arrived at, and how are they justified?\nI have said that human sense-organs and nervous systems are\nthemselves part of the physical world, and most people would\nagree that this proposition is not only true, but platitudinously\ntrue. Yet there are passages when Dr Smythies seems to deny\nthis platitude, by implication at least. He says more than once\nthat the 'signalling mechanism' of the nervous system is between\nthe physical world and the perceptual world (cf. p. 489). The\nword 'between' implies that the signalling mechanism itself be-\nlongs to neither of these worlds. This might be said of the\npsychical part of the signalling mechanism, though doubtfully,\nsince we are told elsewhere (p. 492) that it is located in the space\nOE\nti(\nsti\n\f1952] 'The Extension of Mind'' : Comments on Dr Smythies's Paper 539\nof the perceptual world. But it plainly cannot be said of the\nphysiological part, which is certainly in the physical world if any-\nthing is. If the word 'between' is to be used, the physiological\npart of the mechanism is between one part of the physical world\nand another, e.g. between environmental objects outside the\npercipient's skin, and his cerebral cortex which is inside it. And\ndespite this betweenness, or rather because of it, it is itself as\nphysical as the wires 'between' an electric light bulb and an electric\nbattery.\nI am not of course suggesting for a moment that we ought to go\nback to the TNS theory of 'common sense' ; and I agree with Dr\nSmythies that Professor Ryle and other philsophers of his school\nare much too common-sensical in this respect. I am only suggest-\ning that the difficulties which arise when the TNS theory is\nrejected should be fairly and squarely faced, and complaining (I\nhope not unjustly) that Dr Smythies has not faced them. To put\nit crudely, it seems that the physical world (including those parts\nof it which neurophysiologists investigate) is something less than\nan object of direct awareness, but at the same time something\nmore than a mere hypothesis.\nI now turn to another difficulty, or perhaps another aspect of\nthe same one. There is a curious passage on page 496 about the\nbarrier which prevents the experimenter from entering mind's\nprivate world, and I think that Dr Smythies himself attaches con-\nsiderable importance to it. The experimenter, he says, cannot\nenter mind's private world 'not because it does not exist, but be-\ncause of the barrier presented by a dimensional interface' (cf. also\np. 500 ad fin. and p. 502). Here it looks at first sight as if the\nexperimenter must be observing the physical world : for the\ndimensional interface, it would seem, is between the physical\nworld and the perceptual world, both of them being included in\none seven-dimensional continuum. If that is the right interpreta-\ntion, the difficult is the one already mentioned, that scientists who\nstudy the signalling mechanism somehow have a direct access to\nthe physical world which other people lack.\nBut another interpretation is possible. Perhaps this dimensional\ninterface, 'the most impenetrable of all barriers' (p. 500), is not\nbetween the physical world and the perceptual world, but be-\ntween two perceptual worlds\u2014the perceptual world of the experi-\nI\nmenter and the perceptual world of the other percipient whom he is\ninvestigating. This would be consistent with what Dr Smythies\ninsists on elsewhere, that his own percepts are the only entities\nwhich an experimenter (or anyone else) can directly observe. But\nin that case Dr Smythies's total universe, including both percepts\n\f540 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nand physical objects, must be far more complicated than he wants\nit to be. Seven dimensions will be far too few. We shall need\ndimensional interfaces not merely between the physical world and\n'the' perceptual world, but between the physical world and each\nperceptual world ; and there will be as many perceptual worlds\n\u2014\nand perceptual spaces\u2014as there are percipients. Not only so.\nWe shall also need dimensional interfaces between each perceptual\nworld and every other perceptual world ; for instance, between\nyour perceptual world and mine, if you are the experimenter and\nI am the person experimented upon.\nTo put it another way, it would seem that on Dr Smythies's\nassumptions there is no such thing as 'the' perceptual world at all,\nthough there is such a thing as 'the' physical world, or at any rate\nwe may entertain the hypothesis that there is. It would seem that\nthere must be many perceptual worlds, and many perceptual\nspaces, each of them private to the percipient who perceives it.\nAnd as for the physical world, it is not exactly public either, though\nit could be called neutral as between all the different percipients.\nTo call it public would suggest that it is observed by all of them, as\nthe ordinary man, of course, believes that it is ; but on Dr\nSmythies's assumptions it cannot be, because it is not observed at\nall.\nThis privacy of perceptual worlds makes it very difficult for\nDr Smythies, as for Berkeley, to explain how different percipients\ncan communicate with one another, or indeed how one percipient\ncan learn, or even suspect, that other percipients exist. Like\nBerkeley, he seems to be in grave danger of Solipsism. I think it\nis incumbent on him to explain how a pubhc perceptual world\n('the' perceptual world) extended in a public perceptual space, is\nconstructed, or postulated, when each of us has direct access\nonly to his own private one. Or does each of us first arrive at the\nhypothesis of a physical world (however he justifies it) and then\nproceed from this to the further hypothesis that there are other\nperceptual worlds correlated somehow with his own? Whatever\nthe right answer is, this problem of the privacy of perceptual\nworlds and perceptual spaces should surely be looked into.\nIncidentally, there is some difficulty in understanding how even\none person's private perceptual space is constructed. If we stick\nto the bare data, it would appear that visual space and tactual\nspace are different. Before I can be aware of perceptual space,\neven a private one, I must somehow correlate the two.\nMoreover, Dr Smythies's treatment of the space of mental\nimages (p. 486) seems to be much too simple. It is true that there\nare 'projected' mental images, and there are eidetic images. No\ndoubt we can find room for these in perceptual space, or at least in\n\f1952] 'The Extension of Mind' : Comments on Dr Stnythies's Paper 541\nvisual space. (Dr Smythies's imaged lines sketched 'round the\nobjects of our perceptions' seem to be a special sort of projected\nvisual images.) But there are many visual images which are\nneither projected nor eidetic. They certainly have spatial\nproperties, but they seem to be 'in a space of their own', which is\nneither perceptual space nor physical space. The same is true of\nat any rate some visual hallucinations (when the percipient's entire\nvisual field is hallucinatory, and not merely a part of it). And\nwhat about dream images.'' Dr Smythies has not mentioned them\nat all. Yet it is quite plain that no student of telepathy and\nprecognition can afford to neglect them, even if others can.\nDream images, too, seem to be located 'in a space of their own' ;\nmoreover, even if we confine ourselves to the experiences of a\nsingle dreamer, there are no discernible spatial relations between\nthe dream image I have tonight and those I had yesterday night.\nIt would seem, then, that Dr Smythies's theory of space,\ningenious as it is, is much too neat and tidy. But here I would\nventure to remind the reader of what was said in the second para-\ngraph of these notes. I would suggest that the most fruitful and\noriginal part of his theory is the part concerning the psychical\nmechanism, and I do not believe it was necessary for him to go into\nthe problems of perceptual space at all. By all means let us care-\nfully consider his hypothesis that there is a spatially extended\npsychical mechanism. And in so doing, let us carefully consider\nhis very helpful suggestion that the space in which it is located is\nnot physical space but another one, separated from physical space\nby a 'dimensional interface', and included along with physical\nspace in a total seven-dimensional continuum. But granting that\nthe psychical mechanism is not in physical space, does it follow\nthat it is in perceptual space, as Dr Smythies seems to say on p.\n492, sub-paragraph (v)? Not in the least, and the suggestion is\nmost unplausible. For if it were true, one would think that every\npercipient ought to be able to perceive his own physical mechan-\nism, since after all it would be somewhere or other in his per-\nceptual world ; and notoriously no percipient is able to do this.\nOf course, Dr Smythies can maintain that the psychical mechanism\nis the proximate cause of our percepts and therefore of their\nspatial properties, since it is the last link in the causal chain by\nwhich they are generated. But it will not follow from this that it is\nspatially related to the percepts which it causes.\nThere are many other points in Dr Smythies's paper which call\nfor comment, for instance his 'like to like' theory of causation (pp.\n493' 500) 3nd his very surprising estimate of the philosophy of\nDescartes (pp. 492-3). I will mention only one, because it seems\nto be crucial for the understanding of his theory. At the top of\nA2\n\f542 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan .\npage 488 he says we must postulate that 'minute physical forces\ncross the interface in either direction' (my itaUcs) and identifies\nthese forces with Wk and fy. If I understand his theory rightly\nthe word 'physical' here is just the wrong one. For surely these\nforces are not confined to the physical part of the seven-dimensional\ncontinuum ;\nthey belong in a way to both parts at once, and indeed\nthat is the whole point of postulating them. If they were just\nphysical, they could not cross the interface. A few lines below he\ncalls them 'trans-dimensional physical forces'. It seems to me that\n'trans-dimensional' is the right adjective, but 'physical' is the\nwrong one.\nII\nBy Robert H. Thouless\nOne of the most obvious needs of parapsychology is the formula-\ntion of hypothetical systems which will lead to expectations that\ncan be tested by experiment. In judging any suggestion that may\nbe made, the first question to be asked is not whether it is true or\nfalse but whether it is likely to be experimentally fruitful. Dr\nSmythies's ingenious speculation seems to offer good hope of\nproving fruitful in suggesting directions of experimental inquiry.\nIt seems to me, therefore, to be deserving of a welcome. The first\nwelcome we can give it is by discussing it, but the best tribute we\ncan pay it in the end is to test its expectations experimentally.\nI agree with Dr Smythies that the first thing to get out of our\nminds is what he calls the 'transparent nervous system' theory.\nThe name is new, but the inadequacies of the theory have been\nobvious to experimental psychologists for many years now. I have\ncriticised it in my own lectures under the name of the 'transmission\ntheory', and it is very much what Kohler means by the 'constancy\nhypothesis'. For this reason, experimental psychologists have\ngiven up the use of the term 'sensation' as the name for an element\nof experience, and they talk rather of 'sensory cues' implying that\nwhat happens to a sense-organ is not transmitted as such to\nconsciousness but acts as a signal or cue to set off an appropriate\nperceptual response.\nI am not sure that Dr Smythies is always just in regarding the\npassages he has quoted from Einstein and others as necessarily\nimplying the TNS theory. I think they could be otherwise\ninterpreted. Whether it is so or not, however, the TNS theory is\ntaken for granted by most physicists and old-fashioned physiolo-\ngists and is probably part of the unexamined structure of what is\ntaken for granted in the mind of the man in the street. And it\n\f1952] 'The Extension of Mind' : Conmients on Dr Smythies's Paper 543\nmust be got rid of if we are to begin to talk sense about the per-\nception of the world around us.\nThe main novel point of Dr Smythies's theory is, as I under-\nstand it, that one can represent the relationship between physical\nspace, time, and psychical space, as a seven-dimensional system\nwith one dimension for time and three each for the two space sys-\ntems. I am not sure whether he would accept my phrase 'one can\nrepresent' ; it is intended to imply that this is a way of looking at\nthese things, not a fact that can be extracted from them. Further-\nmore, he contends that if we use this conceptual system many of the\ndifficulties both of paranormal psychology and of the 'mind-body\nproblem' of normal psychology disappear. This is an idea which\nseems to promise well as a guide to experimental inquiry. Its test\nas a fruitful hypothesis must be whether it proves possible by its\nmeans to pose questions sufficiently precisely to make them veri-\nfiable by the method of experimental test.\nIll\nBy C. W. K. Mundle\nI SHALL discuss two features of Dr Smythies's stimulating paper\n'The Extension of Mind', the first being the theory of perception\nwhich he adopts as his starting point. This is what philosophers\ncall 'the representative theory of perception', and it is nowadays\nwidely regarded by them as untenable. Dr Smythies dismisses as\na fallacy the common-sense view, which is usually labelled by\nphilosophers 'Naive Realism' or 'Direct Realism', and is re-\nchristened by Dr Smythies 'ttie TNS (transparent nen^ous sys-\ntem) fallacy'. Regarding the common-sense view\n\u2014'thinking we\nare looking at the physical world directly'\u2014Dr Smythies says 'we\nare no longer allowed to do this by neurophysiology' (p. 485). I\nsuggest, however, that he is mistaken in thinking that the dis-\ncoveries of physiologists have demonstrated the falsity of the\ncommon-sense view. He seems to take for granted a certain\ntheory about the function of such trains of events as light-waves\nimpinging on a retina, followed by processes in the optical nerve\nand the brain. He assumes that their function must be to create\nprivate mind-dependent entities\n\u2014'objects in perceptual space' (or\n'sense-fields', to use a philosophers' term). But their function\nmay, for all the physiologists can show, be quite different ; it may\nbe selective rather than creative, i.e. their function may be to\ndirect one's attention to this rather than that part or feature of the\npublic physical world, to put us, so to speak, in 'direct contact'\nwith objects which are not mind-dependent The selective\n\f544 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\ninterpretation is certainly not without its difficulties (see, for\nexample, Professor Broad's discussion in Scientific Thought, p. 523\net seq). But Dr Smythies does not seem to be fully aware of the\nformidable difficulties of the representative theory. The basic\ndifficulty is that if we maintain, like Dr Smythies, that we can\nonly observe 'objects in perceptual space' (or private sense-fields)\nhow do we, how could we, verify the existence of physical objects\nin physical space. Sometimes Dr Smythies seems to be acknow-\nledging this difficulty, as when he says 'Physical space and physical\nobjects are in fact hypotheses, as we can never observe them\ndirectly' (p. 485). But frequently he speaks, as he is not entitled to,\nas if we know facts about physical space. He assumes, for example,\nthat we know that the observed relations within sense-fields are\nfaithful reproductions of their physical causes (see pp. 486-8).\nI have been making what is a stock criticism of the representa-\ntive theory of perception. Locke's version of this theory was\ncriticised on such lines by Berkeley, who realized that if Locke\nwere right in holding that one is only acquainted with mind-\ndependent entities, then it is an arbitrary and unnecessary hypo-\nthesis to assume physical objects as the causes of our sensations.\nIt is simpler and more intelligible, Berkeley concluded, to assume\nthat all our sensations are produced directly by God.\nI am certainly not suggesting, however, that Dr Smythies's\ntheory should be rejected out of hand because it is based on the\nrepresentation theory of perception. We should be obliged to\nreconsider the case for the representative theory if Dr Smythies's\ntheory of mind proved more successful than any of its rivals in\nreconciling psi phenomena with what is known about normal\nperception. And certainly the rival theories which Dr Smythies\nconsiders (Descartes' and Ryle's) s'eem to contribute little to this\nend. Professor Ryle's approach, in making Common Sense the\nfinal court of appeal and in seeking to dispense with private mental\noccurrences, seems likely to resolve our problem only by inducing\nus to forget that psi phenomena demand some explanation.\nWhat I want to discuss next is the way in which Dr Smythies's\ntheory is supposed to help us to explain psi phenomena. I do not\nfind Dr Smythies's paper very explicit on this point. I shall take\nit that the main puzzle about psi phenomena is that they apparently\ninvolve 'action at a distance' (i.e. causal dependence between events\nseparated by a spatio-temporal gap, not attributable to a chain of\nintervening events). How does Dr Smythies's theory help us\nhere? According to his theory both the physical world and a\nmind are four-dimensional, having only one dimension (time) in\ncommon. A mind is supposed to comprise its sense-fields (or\nperceptual objects), and as these are extended in three spatial\n\f1952] 'The Extension of Mind' : Comments on Dr Smythies' s Paper 545\ndimensions, a mind is said to be material (though not physical).\nThe feature of Dr Smj^thies's theory which I find most difficult to\nunderstand concerns the relationship which is supposed to exist\nbetween\n{a) the trio ^ of dimensions belonging only to sense-fields, and\n{b) the trio of dimensions belonging only to the physical world.\nSome of Dr Smythies's statements suggest that there are spatial\nrelations between {a) and {b), as when he says 'the differentiation\nof psyche from brain should be made on the basis of different\ngeographical location (p. 495 ; his italics) ;\nand again when he\nspeaks of \u00a5^7 and Wk as 'minute trans-dimensional physical\nforces' (p. 488 ;\nmy italics). But judging by what he says on\npage 492, Dr Smythies wishes to deny that there are any spatial\n('topological') relations between {a) and (b). (And this seems an\nintelligible view, for we would, I think, deny that there are any\nspatial relations between the space belonging to the contents of\na dream and perceptual space.) On this interpretation, Dr\nSmythies could, I think, claim that our problem concerning action\nat a distance evaporates. For his theory would imply that it is\nmeaningless to speak of a distance (a spatial or spatio-temporal\ngap) between any mental event and any physical event ; and all\ncases of psi phenomena could, I think, be interpreted as involving\none or more transactions between mental and physical events.\nThere is, however, a serious snag. For this theory would leave\nus with an apparently insoluble puzzle concerning normal pheno-\nmena. If there are no spatial relations between a person's sense-\nfields and his physical body, why, under normal circumstances,\nshould a mind directly alTect (and be directly affected by) one and\nonly one segment of the physical world\u2014the brain of the body\nwhich it 'animates'.? It seems to me that, on this interpretation,\nDr Smythies's theory would remove our main puzzle about the\nparanormal only at the cost of making the normal inexplicable. I\ndo not know whether Dr Smythies has considered his theory\nfrom this angle. If he has, I think he was dismissing it too lightly\nwhen he said 'Wy and ... are normally focussed upon the\nbrain, but have a \"penumbra\" which would be responsible for\nESP and PK' (p. 490).\nDr Smythies may feel that I have been wantonly ignoring what\nhe says in his final summing-up\u2014'The three dimensions com-\nprising the manifold of mental position (perceptual space) are at\nright angles to the four dimensions of physical space-time' (p. 501).\nI find it very difficult, however, to see what could be meant by\nspeaking of spatial manifolds being 'at right angles to' each other.\n^ Or should I say 'trios' ? Does each mind have a different trio of space-\ndimensions?\n\f54^ Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nThis is presumably due solely to my mathematical incompetence ;\nbut I still want to ask those who find this theory clear whether it\ncan explain the intimate relations which exist between our minds\nand our bodies.\nIV\nBy C. C. Stevens\nIn his opening paragraph Dr Smythies writes :\nThe following important fact has been established by experiment.\nThe mind is able to abstract information from its present and future\nenvironment without the use of any of the recognized channels of sense.\nUnfortunately for the argument advanced, no jot of evidence\nrequires observed phenomena to be described as entaihng the\nexistence of 'mind'. If Dr Smythies is satisfied with the implica-\ntions of his statement on p. 478 that 'Nothing resembling trans-\nmitting apparatus has been found in the brain', then he should\nalso recognize that nothing resembling 'mind' has ever been found\nanywhere.\nOne can agree with much that he says, particularly (p. 500) :\n(i) That the psyche is merely a noun descriptive of certain complex\n. . . processes in the brain. ... We can say all that we wish to say\nwithout using the word at all.\nIt is remarkable that Dr Smythies makes no further reference to\nthis theory. He quotes a second theory and expands on its\ndeficiencies but is silent about this one. Such behaviour bears all\nthe marks of an unconscious assumption. Like so many other\npsychical researchers and innumerable ancestors and contempor-\naries, Dr Smythies has assumed, unconsciously and therefore\ninvoluntarily, there must be a 'mind' around the place somewhere.\nThe presence of the term in the language he learned in his cradle\nis sufficient to inculcate the assumption surreptitiously, and its\nadoption is confirmed and made a fixed habit by subsequent con-\nversation with others also in its grip. Once the existence of 'mind'\nis postulated, then the difficulties and confusions hsted so ex-\nhaustively by Dr Smythies necessarily follow. On that postulate,\nof course 'mind' must have some extension or 'whereness' ; of\ncourse, it may be distinguished from brain 'on the basis of dilTer-\nent geographical location' ; of course, it is reasonable to regard\nthe brain then as 'but a station on the way to the soul'. If you\nassume, without knowing you are doing so, that every game in-\ncludes scoring runs, your interpretation of a tennis tournament\nwill be confused, to put it mildly. As long as you continue to be\nunaware of your assumption and of its effects on your interpreta-\n\f1952] 'The Extension of Mind' : Comments on Dr Smythies s Paper 547\ntion of every aspect you observe in the match, so long will you\nautomatically think tennis-players should see the folly of their\nways and that it was time the rules were altered. Dr Smythies's\nremarks about the Crisis in Knowledge and the Crisis in Physics\nfollow from his assumption, but not from anything else.\nThough Dr Smythies is in excellent company, in my view the\nsituation is the more deplorable. He writes (p. 500):\nAs this theory [No. (ii)] has been in the field for as long as history has\nbeen recorded, there does not seem to be much hope. . . .\nI regard this remark as apposite to all theories erected on a\npostulated, and hitherto undetected, 'mind'. It is not generally\nrecognized that the theory (i) quoted above represents, not merely\na relation between 'mind' ( = psyche) and brain, but a new\nepistemology, a new recognition of the relations between three\ndistinguishable states, viz. {a) the world around us, {b) our ex-\nperience of it, and {c) what we say about our experience. In the\ntraditional epistemology these three have been either (i) identified,\ne.g. 'I'm telling you exactly what happened', no distinction being\nmade, or (2) regarded as in one-to-one correspondence with each\nother, e.g. Out there is a pebble,,, inside my skin is my cognition^\nof the pebblca {a:b = i : i) and I can say [That is a pebble],, my\nremark, being apparently related one-to-one to my experience;,\n(a : b : c=i : 1). The slightest acquaintance with nervous system\nfunction renders this view untenable and in its place is required a\nnew epistemology postulating, not one-to-one, but many-to-one\nrelations between a, b and c. When this was adopted, whether\nconsciously or unconsciously, new theories became possible, in\nphysics, biology, communication, neuropsychiatry, etc., but such\nnew theories admittedly cannot be made sense of, or understood,\nby anyone still employing\u2014as a matter of unconscious habit\n\u2014\nthe ancient epistemology we have inherited from Neanderthal Man.\nThere is no reason why the new epistemology should not also\nbe used to formulate new and more effective theories of psi pheno-\nmena, provided that psychical researchers will train themselves in\nthe novel and largely unfamiliar technique.\nV\n'\nBy Antony G.

Rightly Stevens ^ picks out this sen-\n^ Mr Stevens sent a copy of his comments to Mr Flew.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f548 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\ntence as crucial. It is supposed to express a 'fact . . . established\nby experiment '\n(p. 477). And indeed so it does : but only pro-\nvided that it is interpreted as equivalent to the statement that\nsome people have ESP capacity. But if it is to be interpreted (and\nthis must surely be hov.' Smythies means it : or else why does he\nthink that psychical research is relevant to his theory?) in a\ndifferent way, as stating that 'the psyche ... a potentially inde-\npendent agent ... in control of the brain' (p. 500) picks up this\ninformation it most certainly does not express a fact, experiment-\nally established. Indeed it is hard to see how this fact\u2014if fact it\nbe\u2014ever could be established, if psyches\u2014those putative so long\nelusive objects\u2014are really to be found only (as Smythies suggests)\n'on the other side of the most impenetrable of all barriers, a\ndimensional interface' (p. 500).\nClearly something is going wrong : and it is\u2014as Stevens claims\n\u2014something quite fundamental to the entire theory. I suggest\nthat the trouble arises mainly from two mistakes : first, Smythies\nmisconstrues the word 'mind' and its associates ;\nsecond, he con-\nfuses enquiries about the meanings of words with investigations of\nthe facts about things.\nThere are in the English language (and indeed in innumerable\nother languages) many picturesque and suggestive 'mind'-idioms.\nWe speak of Miss Helen Keller's achievement as a triumph of\nmind over matter, of Sir Stafford Cripps as having an absolutely\nfirst-class mind, and of the perfect co-ordination of body and mind\ndisplayed by a ballerina. Such idioms suggest that the word\n'mind' refers to an object, as does the word 'brain'. Though of\ncourse to an unfindal3le object; whose elusiveness has to be\nexcused by explaining that it is invisible and immaterial, or con-\ncealed behind a 'dimensional interface '. But this is a mistake.\n'Mind' is not that sort of word : it is much more like the word\n'temper' which\n\u2014\npace the Red Queen\u2014does not denote an object\nat all. The meaning of 'mind' expressions can be rendered\nadequately into talk of the things which people can do and feel and\nunderstand, talk which suggests no elusive objects. To say that a\nman has a third-class mind is not to say that he possesses some\nclandestine organ, unhappily rather defective ; but to say that his\nacademic ability is very slight. Disputes about such assertions are\nsettled\u2014if they are settled at all\u2014by examining his capacities ;\nand not by investigating his problematical shadow anatomy. I\nwill not labour the point here ; for I have recently developed it\nelsewhere ^ against Rhine ; and in any case Smythies also knows\nhis Ryle (cf. pp. 494 ff.). :\n^ 'Minds and Mystifications' printed in the Listener, 27 September\n1951-\n\f1952]\n'\nThe Extension of Mind' : Comments on Dr Smythies's Paper 549\nNevertheless it does seem that he fails fully to appreciate the\nforce and relevance of Rylean theses. For instance, he suggests\nthat Ryle's proceedings are arbitrary : writing of his 'defining\nmind to mean a verbal cloak to cover such processes as thinking,\nperceiving, feeling, etc' ; and conceding '\nIt is, of course, mean-\ningless to discuss whether the \"mind\" is extended or not if by\nmind we mean what Ryle means by the word' (p. 493 : his in-\nverted commas ; and lack of them). He also assumes (and for this\nRyle's mode of expression ^ is probably to blame) that Ryle is just\nappealing to commonsense. But this is wrong. Ryle is not just\nbeing arbitrary here : for he is using the word 'mind' in the ac-\ncepted way. Nor is he here appealing primarily to common-\nsense (which indeed is notoriously 'a most misleading guide' (p.\n494) about the facts of nature). He is appealing\u2014and this is a very\ndifferent matter\u2014to common linguistic usage, as the standard of\ncorrectness in speech. Neither is this trivial or irrelevant to the\npresent theory. For it is surely only by unwittingly slipping to\nand fro between the ordinary and correct interpretation of 'mind'-\nexpressions (which he thinks of as an arbitrary invention of Ryle's)\nand his peculiar and mistaken one (which he presumably takes to\nbe correct) that Smythies is able to persuade himself that the\nESP phenomena prove, or even tend to prove, that psyches, con-\nceived as potentially independent agents in control of the brain,\npick up information, or even exist at all. To put it crudely :\nSmythies interprets the sentence quoted in our first paragraph in\none way\u2014the correct way\u2014when he is establishing that it ex-\npresses an experimental fact ; but in a wholly different\u2014and mis-\ntaken\u2014way when he goes on, assured that it expresses a fact, to\nerect his theoretical structure upon the alleged fact which it is now\nsupposed, wrongly, to state.^ It is unkind, but irresistibly\napposite, to quote his own warning that 'Confusion is caused by\nthe use of the words . . . \"mind\" and \"psyche\". These words have\nseveral different meanings, and the confusion arises when deduc-\ntions are drawn . . . when one of the other meanings of the words\nis really intended' (p. 479).\nWe turn now to the second sort of mistake, the confusion of\nproblems of meaning with problems of fact. Smythies notices\n^ In The Concept of Mind he often makes his points as if his business\nwere with the non-linguistic world rather than, as it is, with words or\nconcepts. His paper 'Systematically Misleading Expressions', reprinted\nin my anthology Logic and Language (Oxford, Blackwell, 195 1) gives a\nbetter idea of his method, and would be suggestive here.\n^ This may also suggest why Rhine now seems unable to make up his\nmind\u2014in spite of his earlier certainty\u2014whether parapsychology has as\nyet experimentally established the existence of any sort of soul (cf. Tele-\npathy and Human Personality, passim.).\n\f550 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\ntwo theories of 'the possible nature of the psyche' (p. 500). But\nthe first is about the meaning of the word 'psyche' : while the\nsecond is a speculation about the nature of psyches, the thing?\nwhich the word 'psyche' is thought by some to denote. He thus\nbundles together two radically different sorts of question. This\nis all too easily done : for unfortunately both can be asked in the\nsame form of words 'What is (the nature of) (an or the) XV ;\nwhich may express a question about the meaning of the word 'X';\nor about the nature of the things, X's, which the word denotes.'\nBut it is essential to distinguish these two sorts of question :\nwhich is perhaps best done by putting inverted commas round the\nword when it is a word that is being mentioned (hence my petulant\nparenthesis about Smythies's faulty inverted comma-ing). When\nthis distinction is made, it becomes clear first that questions about\nthe nature of the objects, psyches, can only arise if there are such\nobjects and, second, that the existence of these putative objects\nis neither guaranteed by our ordinary significant use of 'mind'-\nidioms nor yet established by the extraordinary discoveries of para-\npsychology. Once it has been shown that neither of these gives\ngrounds for believing any such entities to exist, it is difficult to\njustify further speculation about their possible nature and loca-\ntion (cf., e.g., p. 500 at foot).\nAnother but much more subtle and complicated example of the\nsame sort of confusion can be found in the attack on 'the common-\nsense fallacy of the TNS' (p. 494) : which consists in supposing\nthat 'the familiar world of perception is ... a direct view of the\nphysical world' (p. 480) ; and ignoring that we are all wholly\ndependent for our knowledge of things on 'an extensive signalling\nmechanism' (p. 481), the nervous system. This cannot be relied on\nto be perfect, perfectly transparent as it were. It may be mechani-\ncally defective : and its operations can at best permit us to put\nforward the very existence of the world only as an hypothesis.\nSmythies, following a great tradition, but adding all modern\ntechnological sophistications, pictures our human cognitive\npredicament on the analogy of 'the controller in the parent aero-\ndrome and a radio-controlled pilotless aircraft . . . fitted with\ntelevision cameras and other instruments. ... He observes all\nthat is taking place on the television screen, and attends to the\nother information signalled back. ... he cannot see, and has never\nseen, anything except the screen before him' (pp. 491-2). Many\nif not most philosophers nowadays\u2014Ryle certainly\u2014reject totally\nall such epistemological models. This rejection really is total :\nthey do not accept such models and then argue or assume that,\nfortunately, the nervous system is transparent. Certainly the\nmechanism is essential : perception could never occur without it.\n\f1952] 'The Extension of Mind' : Comments on Dr Smythies's Paper 551\nCertainly it may go wrong : and even when it is working with its\nusual near-perfection it is still possible for us to make perceptual\nmistakes (being, for example, deceived by optical illusions or\neidetic imagery). But neither of these facts has the slightest\ntendency to show that we never really see anything (directly). We\ndo not look out on the world through this mechanism : the\nmechanism is part of us. To explain why so many philosophers\nnow reject as fantasies all such ghost-in-the-machine models would\ntake us far too long.^ But it must at least be pointed out that this\nrejection is not based either on invincible ignorance of discoveries\nin neurophysiology or on a mere appeal to the notoriously fallible\npronouncements of commonsense. It rests rather on a constant\nmore or less explicit appeal to common and correct linguistic\nusage. It is, for example, simply not correct to describe what we\nshould normally call a case of being able to see a tank (when, of\ncourse, the suggestion that it is part of an insubstantial pageant or\nis only an hallucination has been eliminated) as if it was not really\na case of being able to see a tank (directly) : no one in such a situa-\ntion, if he modestly claims to be able to see a tank, is making any\nreckless inferences to the forever unobservable ;\nfor this is\nprecisely the sort of thing which is meatit by the expression, 'I can\nsee a tank'. Neurophysiologists have much to teach us about the\nmechanism without which perception could not happen : but they\ndo not and cannot prove that (direct) perception does not occur at\nall. (In the only sense, that is, v\/hich has so far been given to\n'(direct) perception'\u2014i.e. the everyday sense. If\u2014as Smythies\nmaintains\n\u2014\n(direct) perception does not occur, w^hat is it that he\nmeans by 'perceiving directly'})\nThis treatment has necessarily been crudely skeletal and in-\nadequate, presenting just two major objections in harsh and garish\noutline : but to deal fairly and fully w^ith all the philosophical\nissues raised would need several entire numbers of the Journal.\nB\nYet even if we have been right in arguing that this paper is\nradically misguided, much might be excused if it nevertheless held\nout prospects of heuristic fertility. But I do not think that it is\neven intended to olTer that sort of theory : the Summary sug-\ngests that it is not, that its 'aim ... is to examine some . . . funda-\n^ But it is perhaps worth mentioning some important papers in con-\ntemporary Anglo-Saxon epistemology : inmy Logic and Language, chapters\nV (G. A. Paul) and VI (M. Macdonald), and in P. A. Schilpp's The\nPhilosophy of G. E. Moore the papers by J. Wisdom and N. Malcolm are\nboth reasonably accessible and extremely relevant. Papers by N. Mal-\ncolm in the American Philosophical Review are particularly apt to the\npresent physiological variant of this fantasy.\n\f552 'Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nmental assumptions, and to suggest a series of alternative assump-\ntions which give a more coherent account of the universe and the\nplace of conscious mind in it' (p. 477). This enterprise has, I\nthink, been unsuccessful. And partly, surely, because it is so\npremature. It seems to me\u2014as I have argued elsewhere\u2014that\nwhat we need at present in our subject is primarily and above all\nmore experiments and ideas for experiments. We must build up a\nsolid body of experimental fact : both by confirming through\nrepetition the work already done ; and by establishing new facts\nand correlations. Then we shall surely find, as Dr Thouless\nrecently suggested, that 'Either the essential step in thought will\nhave become easy or at any rate the road will have become easy for\na future Einstein of parapsychology. Let us, then, do more\nexperiments' {this Journal, Vol. 35, No. 657, p. 210).\nC\nIn two recent broadcasts ^ I poured scorn on philosophical\nsensationalism in parapsychology and argued that it was a mistake\nto think, with Rhine, that it had metaphysical implications. I\nshould like to take this chance of conceding that, while the errors\nI tried to expose are indeed errors, the results of parapsychology\ndo have some implications which might be called metaphysical,\nand that those who consider them philosophically sensational are\nto that extent right. First, ESP while it may not formally contra-\ndict any established laws or theories in natural science, does\ncertainly conflict with something more fundamental even than the\nmost basic of these. For it is incompatible with some of the\nfundamental beliefs\n\u2014'absolute presuppositions' ^ if you like-\nstill almost universally shared even by contemporary scientists,\nabout the sort of thing which can happen and the sort of law\nwhich can apply. These scientific beliefs can be modified by\nreason and experience, and it is absolutely necessary to have some\nsuch beliefs to guide research : so 'prejudices' is not the word for\nthem. Being concerned with the 'ultimate nature of reality' they\nmight well be dubbed 'metaphysical assumptions'. The great\nHelmholz was expressing one such when he declared, 'Neither the\ntestimony of all the Fellows of the Royal Society, nor even the\nevidence of my own senses could lead me to believe in the trans-\nmission of thoughts from one person to another, independently of\nthe recognized channels of sensation.' ^ This basic belief now has\n* Printed in the Listener for 27 September 195 1 and 4 October 1951.\n^ Cf.

Second, as indeed I\nsuggested in my second talk, the scientific handling of ESP pheno-\nmena may well call for some revision of, or innovation among, the\nbasic explanatory concepts. We may, for instance, here have to use\na new concept of 'cause', perhaps one revised along the lines sug-\ngested by Mundle {Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supp.\nVol. XXIV, pp. 222 ff.). These two facts might well be said to\nconstitute metaphysical implications of ESP, and even to be\nphilosophically sensational.\nVI\nBy C. T. K. Chari\nThe paper by Dr Smythies in the Journal for September-October\n1 95 1 merits the most careful attention not only of physicists,\nbiologists, and psychologists, but also of philosophers. I am\nafraid that philosophical opinion concerning psychical research\nstill lags behind the most informed British opinion. Dr T. M. P.\nMahadevan, Reader in Indian Philosophy at the University of\nMadras, told some of us at a meeting that, during a recent tour of\nthe United States, he happened to mention Dr Rhine's work and\nthe S.P.R. in private conversation with some prominent philo-\nsophers and evoked only 'peals of laughter'. I imagine that most\nof these philosophers lack the candour of Dr Archie Bahm of the\nUniversity of New Mexico who, in a letter to me dated January 27,\n1 95 1, said :\n'. . . I am still distrustful of \"parapsychology\"\n\u2014\npartty because I am not sufficiently familiar with its findings. . .\n.'\nAfter sketching a tentative theory of time, he added : 'It also\nleaves open the possibilities involved in parapsychology'. I have\nbeen busying myself for some time with a topological generaliza-\ntion of the theories propounded by Dunne and Saltmarsh. A\ncrude outline of my hypothesis may appear in Mind. I should\nlike to say something here about the difficulties I have en-\ncountered in 'spatial' models of the universe designed to accommo-\ndate psi phenomena.\n(i) Dr Smythies urges that his hypothesis offers a 'credible'\nexplanation of 'normal' and 'paranormal' facts (p. 500). Ought\nwe to accept 'credibility' or 'probability' as a criterion for evaluat-\ning the theories of psychical research? If we assume that the\nuniformities established by orthodox physics, biology, and neuro-\nphysiology have a 'high probability'\u2014just what the statement\nmeans on the theories proposed by Kolmogorov, Doob, Feller,\nNeyman, Cramer, von Mises, Reichenbach, Carnap, and Jeff'reys\nis another question\n\u2014\nno theory of psi phenomena sets out with\n\f554 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JAN.\nany 'high probability'. It has been conceded by the best authorities\non the subject that it demands a very drastic reconstruction of our\nsystem of scientific expectations. But to be conceivable at all, the\nnew system of postulates that we erect must bear some analogy to\nthe existing framework. And if it does, will it go far enough to be\nreally serviceable in psychical research? How formidable is the\ntask of reconstruction may be judged with reference to the 'basic\nlimiting principles' that Professor Broad has formulated. ^ One of\nthem is that 'it is self-evidently impossible that an event should\nbegin to have any effects before it has happened'.^ I maintain\nthat any attempt to modify or reconstruct (and precognition leaves\nus no option but to modify or reconstruct) a principle like this\nnecessitates a collateral epistemological inquiry into the 'limits of\nconceivability'. So far as I am aware, only Mr Tyrrell has paid\nserious attention to the problem. The perspectives that he has\nunfolded in his Homo Faber ^ must be kept well in view in all our\nattempts at theory-building. I shall return to this point at the end\nof my letter.\n(2) Dr Smythies makes a great deal of what he calls the 'TNS'\nfallacy. I quite realize that to anybody who has much to do with\nneuro-physiology Naive Realism must appear very naive indeed.\nBut is it necessarily fallacious? It seems to me that the hypothesis\nproposed by Dr Smythies involves us in some at least of the diffi-\nculties of the older epistemological dualism. How can we know\nthat 'events in our perceptual world follow faithfully the events in\nthe physical world' when the latter, ex hypothesi, are never directly\naccessible? The analogy of the controller in the aerodrome and\nthe radio-controlled aircraft (p. 491) gives us no help here. Per-\nhaps Dr Smythies would like to appeal to the 'isomorphism' of\nGestalt psychology. But does it eliminate the epistemological\ndifficulty? I am not at all sure that we can afford to ignore the\ningenious reconstruction of Direct ReaHsm attempted by Captain\nM. M. Moncrieff in his book The Clairvoyant Theory of Percep-\ntion.^ Professor Price in commending the theory says : 'Perhaps\nwe shall no longer be obliged to suppose, as so many philosophers\nhave, that sense-data or sensa or sensation contents are the only\nentities we are directly aware of in perception. ... It is curious\nthat an important and influential school of contemporary philo-\nsophers has arrived at a very similar result in an entirely different\nway, by using the methods of linguistic analysis developed by Dr\nWittgenstein'.^ I agree with Professor Price that Captain Mon-\ncrieff's rehabilitation of Direct Realism is worth while.

I believe that a theory\ncould be worked out along these lines without accepting the kind\nof neutral monism or logical positivism to which Carington so\nwholeheartedly committed himself in his later years. We have a\nwide range of possibilities to explore, even the seeming meta-\nphysical lunacies. It is noteworthy that J. C. F. Z6llner,i who was\nprobably the first distinguished psychical researcher to adopt the\nworking hypothesis of a multi-dimensional space, held that it was\nquite compatible with an extreme Mentalism or Berkeleism. He\nconjectured that the 'representation of our whole real corporeal\nworld' (italics not mine) may have a status not dissimilar to that of\nthe 'hallucinations' evoked in the hypnotic and post-hypnotic\nstates. The 'parable' that Mr Tyrrell developed in his Grades of\nSignificance ^ may be far more significant than many of us imagine.\n(3) Dr Smythies says (p. 502) that his hypothesis 'provides the\norganization seemingly required by the activity of the \"censor\"\nas described by Soal'. Possibly. But does it account for the\npeculiar symbolism often associated with spontaneous psi pheno-\nmena? My own extended investigation of a case involving osten-\nsible paranormal cognition and ostensible para-physical pheno-\nmena (telekinesis and apports) suggested symbolism of the weird-\nest kind. I found strong indications that the 'spirit communica-\ntors' who claimed to be responsible for the phenomena were com-\npound entities formed on the same lines as the 'dream figures' of\nFreudian and Jungian psychology. My observations lend support\nto the hypothesis advanced by Dr John Layard.\" The fact that the\ncases cited by him came out poorly when judged by stringent\nevidential standards does not rob them of their very great theo-\nretical value.* My evidence (of better quality and obtained in an\nintimate circle) argues for those queer creatures having 'one foot\nin the world of reality and the other in a dream . . . worthy of the\nmaddest ideahsm' to which F. C. S. Schiller referred once.^ While\nI quite approve of 'psi' as a non-committal omnibus term for 'para-\nnormal' phenomena, I am by no means convinced that it has a\ngreat theoretical advantage over Myers's 'Subliminal' hypothesis.\nI think it is as likely as not that a reformulation of his hypothesis,\nperhaps in the language of a non-metricized dynamics of the kind\nsketched by Kurt Lewin and his followers, will suggest fresh lines\n^ Transcendental Physics (Eng. tr. with preface and appendices by C.

We may say that a 'boundary' is some-\nthing in crossing which the phenomena change their character.\nPsychical research and modern 'depth psychology' suggest, at\nleast as a first generalization, that the empirical ego is a 'boundary'\nin a complex 'psychological field'. We might adopt a term like\n'praeter-conscious' as a generic term for all deep-lying or not\nordinarily introspectable mental processes. As we move away\nfrom the empirical ego into the praeter-conscious, the laws of\northodox scientific psychology become less and less relevant. By\na cautious interpolation and extrapolation we can posit praeter-\nconscious processes starting with the behaviour data of experi-\nmental psychical research.

This does not\nmean, of course, that the 'spatialization' of time is worthless in\nspeculation on psychical research. But it does mean that the\ntopology of manifolds alone will not carry us far without qualita-\ntively nezv ideas about 'transitoriness' or 'passage'. I believe that\nProfessor Broad, at the Joint Session of the Aristotelian Society\nand the Mind Association in 1937,^ hinted at the need for such\nnotions when he made a distinction between the extra dimensions\nof space postulated by Hinton and Dunne and extra dimensions of\ntime. There may be an unfamiliar time in which the distinction\nbetween a 'past' and a 'present' is irrelevant but not the distinction\nbetween a 'present' and a 'future'.\nThere is unquestionably an urgent need for theorizing of the\nrigorous sort in psychical research. But 'rigour', in this domain,\nmay consist largely in discovering the 'limits of assertability'. The\nmuddles about 'survival', for instance, may be just muddles about\nits 'assertability' in any ordinary language. My approach invites\ncomparison with Mr Tyrrell's. Dr Smythies does not deny, I\nthink, that there may be intrinsic limitations in all speculation on\npsychical research. He speaks of a psychic mechanism of 'a\nfabulous complexity, and in part employing principles of which we\nknow nothing' (p. 491). And he admits (p. 500) that 'The nature\nof the Self remains inexplicable'.\nReply by Dr Smythies\nI WILL try and answer Professor Price's comments first. His first\npoint (p. 538) centres round, I think, my use of the word hypothesis\nwhich I used throughout my paper in a modified sense of the\nrather special way in which Dingle employs it. Dingle uses it to\nmean a pseudo-atom or pseudo-molecule, and gives as a familiar\nexample the planet Neptune between the time that its presence\nwas hypothecated to account for the irregularities in the motion\nof Uranus and the time it was first seen. He regards hypotheses as\nbeing 'potential experiences though they are not actual memories\nor (in general) representatives. These are known as hypotheses. . . .\nThese pseudo-atoms may have all the definiteness and locability\nof actual experiences, but they are neither memories or repre-\nsentatives'. ^ Thus it would be logically possible to observe events\nin the physical world directly if our witnessing Selves could\n^ Proc. Arist. Soc, Supp. Vol. xvi (London, Harrison, 1937), p. 203.\n^ Herbert Dingle, Through Science to Philosophy (London, Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1937), p. 165.\n\f558 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nleave their place inside the head of the perceived body, cross the\ndimensional interface, and then observe in physical space, ?\/ Selves\ncould then react directly to light. Until someone does this they\nremain strictly hypotheses (but not 'mere' hypotheses) from which\nthe witnesses are individually cut off by material and spatial\nbarriers, but which we observe indirectly by means of signalling\nmechanisms.\nWe might extend Dingle's definition of hypotheses thus :\n(i) To include the class of all physical objects which are only\nindirectly observable via signaUing mechanisms. A sub-set of\nthis class comprises the set of hypotheses in Dingle's present sense.\nThese have not yet been indirectly observed, but their presence is\ninferred to account for the indirectly observed behaviour of other\nobjects, and it is supposed that it will be possible to observe them\nindirectly at some future date and under certain special conditions.\n(ii) To include the class of all objects which (it seems probable)\nwill never be even indirectly observable in the nature of things, but\nwhose presence we infer to account for the correlation between\ndirectly observed events (i.e. sense-data) and brain events. This\nclass includes the intermediate parts of those psychical mechan-\nisms connecting the field of direct observation^ with the brain, the\nevents at the proximal surface of which mechanisms we inspect or\nobserve directly as sense-data.\nWe might term these hypotheses of the first, second, and third\ndegree (or term) respectively. Third degree hypotheses border on\npostulates in Dingle's sense.\nTaking Professor Price's next point (p. 538) I should have said in\nthis passage that the signalling mechanisms of the nervous system\nand psychical system are between the observer and the outside\nphysical world. The afferent function of the nervous system may\nbe to fashion a mnemically organized model of the internal and\nexternal environment to form the target for Wy.\nI must apologize for my error, which Professor Price notes next,\nin locating the psychical mechanisms in perceptual space. Only\nthe proximal surface of any such mechanisms, which actually\npresent sense-data, can be located in perceptual space. The rest\nof the individual observer's own mechanism would then be\nhidden from his own direct observation, just as the inside of a\ntelevision set is obscured by the screen. The whole of other\npeople's psychical mechanisms would then be outside his range of\n^ I take perceptual space to be the spatial sense-field open to inspection\nor direct observation. It is the space system in which sense-data are\nextended. Would a better term for this system be inspectual space, since\nit is the space system in which inspection (in Broad's sense) takes place?\nIf so, what I have called the perceived body would be known as the\ninspected body.\n\figja] Reply by Dr Smythies 559\nindirect observation hidden behind a dimensional interface, as his\nown mechanisms would be hidden from their sight. Perceptual\nspace is strictly limited to the confines of the perceived body and\nthe visual screen demonstrated by after-images and the strobo-\nscopic patterns, and to the limits of mental imagery and the 'there-\nness' of sounds. The rest of visual space may be illusory. The\nunobser\\'able volume of space in which perceptual space is em-\nbedded might be called psychical space. These changes are\nsummarized in the revised postulates of the theory given on pp.\n568-9 and answer to some extent, I hope, some of the difficulties\nthat Professor Price has raised. The theory might also be re-\ngarded as an extension of Henry More's doctrine of 'essential\nspissitude'.\nWith regard to the point that Professor Price makes on page 540\n(line 21), I did not mean to imply that the common physical world\nis not observed at all, but that it is observed indirectly by means\nof a signalling mechanism. Visual space, or rather that part which\nis not illusory, and tactual space, which is the space occupied by\nthe perceived body, are different locations in perceptual space.\nWhen I suggested that Wy and Wk are physical forces, I meant\nthat they may prove detectable by instruments of suitable design.\n'Trans-dimensional' forces would, I agree, be a better term.\nOne reason for my 'surprising' version of Descartes' philosophy,\nwhich Professor Price mentions, and for the possible distortions of\nthe implications of relativity theory, to which Dr Thouless and\nMr Chari draw attention, is that I have learned about these sys-\ntems of knowledge through their interpreters. This has been\nregrettably necessary owing to the size of the field I have tried to\ncover and to the mathematical difficulty of relativity theory. For\nDescartes I have relied largely on Burtt, and for relativity on\nEddington and Jeans. If perceptual space is regarded as being a\ndirect cross-section of physical space-time, as Jeans seems to\nsuggest is implied in relativity, ^ is that not the TNS theory?\nI have been in touch with Mr Warner Allen since the publication\nof my paper and I now see that I was mistaken in attributing to\nhim the TNS fallacy. James's 'Chamber of Consciousness'\nshould, however, I think, be attributed with spatial extension. It\nseems to have more than the merely temporal extension with which\nMr Warner Allen attributes it in his works. I must apologize for\nmy misinterpretation of his views.\nTo pass on the main epistemological difficulties that have been\nraised. These may be summarized as follows:\n1\nSir James Jeans, Physics and Philosophy (Cambridge University\nPress, 1942), PP- 63-9.\n\f560 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JAN.\n(i) How is it possible to gain accurate information about one\nseries of events (i.e. physical events) by observing a second series\nof events (i.e. experiential events or sense-data) occurring at one\nend of a signalling mechanism the other end of which is con-\nnected to the second series of events, the whole arranged in such\na way that the first set may be said to represent the second, when\nit is impossible ever to observe the second set directly?\n(ii) How can it be possible to know that the first set is giving an\naccurate representation of the second set and indeed that the\nsecond set exists at all?\nSuch a fundamental question as this can hardly be dealt with\nadequately in the space available, so I can only attempt a brief\ndefence of the representative theory. I would answer the first\nobjection by saying that perceptual situations of this nature,\nthough at a lower level, play an increasing part in modern life.\nWhen I perceive a fluctuating series of grey and v\/hite dots on my\ntelevision screen I do not limit myself to an account of the elec-\ntronic behaviour of my set. I assume that I am perceiving, for\ninstance, a game of cricket at the Oval, and thus am gaining a lot\nof information and knowledge that I would not otherwise have\nobtained. It is then only necessary to postulate that my sense-\ndata, as I inspect them (in Broad's sense), representing the screen\nof my set and the events occurring there, bear the same type of\nrelation to the actual screen and its actual events as these latter in\nturn do to the actual cricket match at the Oval. In the latter case\nthe signalling mechanism is formed by light, television camera,\ntransmitter, and receiver : in the former case it is formed by light,\neye, optic nerve, brain, and I would add Wy and psychical mechan-\nism. This analogy with television is in fact more than an analogy,\nas recent work in neurophysiology supports the view that the actual\nmechanisms concerned in visual perception function along lines\nvery similar to television. As Grey Walter ^ has said, 'the tele-\nvisual system behaves very like the neuro-visual one'.\nIt may be objected that this postulated relation between sense-\ndata and physical events cannot be checked directly as can the\nrelation between the television set and the cricket match. This is,\nin fact, the second objection given above. There may be various\nways of replying to it. In the first place, we do not always know\nif anything does correspond in the physical world to certain ex-\nperiences (for instance, some kinds of visual hallucination induced\nin normal subjects under hypnosis) if we are restrained from\n^ 'Features in the Electro-physiology of Mental Mechanisms' in D.\nRichter, ed..

As E. A. Burtt ^ points out, we do not\ncheck doubtful perceptions by making fresh observations in a\nnew manner on the physical objects themselves, but by making\nfresh perceptions or observations in the old manner. At any\nrate, we know soon enough when events in the perceptual world\ncease to follow the events in the physical world to any severe\ndegree, and hallucinations and illusions develop, unless we lose\ninsight. In the latter case our behaviour will very largely be\ndetermined by the events in perceptual space, as a study of\nschizophrenia shows. The basis of the madness of a schizo-\nphrenic is not that he has 'lost his reason' but that he ceases to\nrealize that the extraordinary events he is experiencing are\noccurring in his own perceptual world only and consequently\nbehaves as though they were occurring in the public physical\nworld also. There are, of course, distortions of reasoning in\nschizophrenia\u2014the thought disorder and the peculiar symbolism\n\u2014but the schizophrenic remains a moderately reliable witness for\nthe phenomena he is experiencing.^ This may be better under-\nstood if one experiences oneself a short artificial schizophrenic-\nlike psychosis such as is produced by the alkaloid mescaline. In\nany signalling mechanism 'false' information may be inserted at\nany level, but it remains information for all that. Its falseness is\nmerely a relative quality. It can tell us nothing about the objective\nof the signalling mechanism, the system at which the mechanism is\ndirected, but such interference (e.g. hallucinations) can tell us a\ngreat deal about the signalling mechanism itself and the environ-\nment of the mechanism, if this should be more extensive in any\nway than the system comprising the objective of the mechanism\nand the distal end of the mechanism itself. All experiences,\nincluding schizophrenic ones, must be correlated.\nThe mode of presentation of our picture of the external world,\nand certain aspects of our knowledge of it, have been built up by\nmany years of subconscious learning along the lines described by\nJ. Z. Young,^ in which the mode of action and electronic behaviour\nof the mechanisms of the brain have been radically changed. Our\nknowledge of the external world has also been built up, in the child\n^ The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science, 2nd ed.\n(London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1932).\n^ See, for example, Thomas Hennell, The Witnesses (London, Peter\nDavies, 1938).\n^ Doubt and Certainty in Science (London, Oxford University Press,\n1951)-\n\f562 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JAN.\nas in the race, by conscious learning and by 'logical processes of\nconstruction and hypothesis, and by inferences therefrom'.^ By\nthe time we reach adult life these two processes have established\nthe condition where, by the former process, the sense-fields are\npresented in an orderly manner, and we can gain meaning from\nwhat we inspect. When these mechanisms go wrong, or where\nthey have received no instruction, the sense-fields are presented\nin a disorderly and confusing manner. In cases reported by J. Z.\nYoung 2 and Paul Schilder ^ of patients who are restored to sight\nfollowing congenital blindness, the visual field is just a confused\nmass of colour in which no objects are perceived for several\nmonths while the electronic mechanisms transmitting the patterns\nof vision are learning. By the logical process of construction, etc.,\nwe gain the idea of a physical world which may be supposed con-\ntinually to feed information into the manifold inputs of the\nmachine, of which one set of manifold outputs \/orw the perceptual\nworld. Dobbs has dealt with this question with clarity in the\narticle already referred to. He states that all knowledge of physical\nevents, and thus of processes in physical objects, is inferential\nand never direct knowledge. The only change I would suggest in\nhis account is that the one-to-one correspondence between\nexperential events and neural events is not gained though co-\nincidence in space but by connexion by signalling mechanism.\nExperiential events and their antecedent neural events are geo-\nmetrically entirely incongruous.\ni\nMay I now answer some of Mr Mundle's points.\n(i) It is not I who am responsible for the notion that Direct\nRealism has been rendered untenable by neurophysiology.* I have 1\nquoted the eminent authorities in this field upon whose deductions\nI have based my arguments\u2014E.

It is perhaps an advantage for this theory that\nit entails the minimum change in the current theoretical position\nin neurophysiology, and, I think, does not clash with any facts of\nneurophysiology. The changes I am suggesting are mainly\nadditive.\nI do not assume that the function of the optic nerve and brain\n'must be to create private mind-dependent entities'. I suggest\nthat these latter are created by the mechanical part of the spatially\nindependent psyche. The total psyche-brain mechanism would\nthen be both transmissive, creative, and contain internal focussing\ndevices to aid the direction of attention. The brain may be one\nhalf of Sherrington's telephone exchange. The subscribers may\ninhabit the other half. I can see little justification for supposing\nthat we observe events in the physical world directly, in order to\npersuade ourselves that there is such a world, when all the evidence\nfrom neurology, neurophysiology, neuropsychiatry, and experi-\nmental psychology indicates, to an overwhelming degree, that we\ndo not observe physical events in this fashion.\n(ii) I have already to some extent dealt with Mr Mundle's\nsecond point. The relation between A and B is given by postu-\nlating that they form together an ^-dimensional continuum. On\npage 492 of my paper I said that they may be non-coincident.\nThat is not to say that they do not have any spatial relation to each\nother. They have the spatial relation of non-coincidence. The\nintimate relations that exist between our minds and our bodies\nmay be accounted for by supposing that the body and the psyche\n(including the Self) form together a single and unified organism.\nMr Flew states firmly that it is a mistake to use the word 'mind'\nas though it referred to an object, as does the word 'brain', and\nthat his opinions are based on 'common and correct linguistic\nusage'. I feel, however, that common linguistic usage can hardly\nbe held to be sufficient authority for deciding fundamental issues\nin cosmology. No one can possibly claim to know whether events\ndo or do not occur in higher-dimensional space and whether or\nnot these events have anything to do with human beings. These\nquestions can only be answered by observation and experiment.\nI have no objection if the phrase he finds most noxious in my\narticle be changed to 'People are able to abstract information, etc'\nIn that case, it is necessary to postulate that a person comprises a\n^ Perspectives in Neuropsychiatry, p. 69.\n\f564 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JAN.\nbody and an X. The particular label you attach to X does not\nseem to me to be as important as Mr Flew claims ;\nthough, of\ncourse, it avoids misunderstandings if the same term is used in the\nsame sense by everyone who uses it. X may be in part, or perhaps\nwholly, an organized and material entity extended in a space of a\ndifferent dimensionality to that in which the body is extended. I\nsuggest that psyche is a good name for it. Part of the psyche seems\nto divide naturally into Self and not-Self, the observer and what is\nobserved, the thinker and what is thought.\nMr Flew admits that he possesses a mechanism by the aid of\nwhich he perceives the external world. It is, he says, part of him.\nWhere then, in the world that he perceives, is this mechanism\nlocated .-^\nTo sustain his case he must suppose that it is located\ninside his perceived head. If so, then it must be transparent since\nhis observing Self is presumably inside the semi-liquid mass of his\nbrain encased in an opaque and solid skull. If, however, he sup-\nposes that his perceived skull and body are inside the mechanism,\nas Hutton suggests, then he is propounding the representative\ntheory of perception at present widely held in neurology, where\nperceived events are electron patterns in the brain. My theory is\nonly a variant of this latter theory where a part of the mechanism\nis cut off from the brain by 'a great gulf fixed'. It is interesting to\nnote that Moncrieff, in his ingenious attempt to resurrect Naive\nRealism, was forced to place the point of observation in the cavity\nof the eye-ball behind the transparent cornea, aqueous humour,\ncrystalline lens and vitreous humour, and in front of the opaque \\\nretina, sclera, optic nerve, etc.^ It seems to me that until someone\ncan construct a detailed theory of brain function which can\naccount for all the determined facts of neurology and allied\ndisciplines and can yet support Naive Realism, the only three\ndefensible theories of perception are those given by Russell Brain\nin his article in Philosophy to which I have already referred.\nMr Flew constructs his theories by a 'constant more or less\nexplicit appeal to common and correct linguistic usage'. How\ndoes Mr Flew know that common linguistic usage is in fact cor-\nrect? Language is merely the system of inter-observer communi-\ncation and clearly cannot be used as the sole basis for an infallible\ntheory of perception, mind, or anything else, since it will inevit-\nably embody and reproduce any mistaken ideas that these ob-\nservers may entertain, and any mistaken opinions that they, as\nfallible human beings, may form of their own nature.

We would be equally in agreement if a representative\ntheory were true, as Hutton points out in the passage I quoted\nfrom her work in my article.\nMr Flew seems to me to give words an undue importance rela-\ntive to the entities that words are the labels we use to describe.\nHis philosophical criteria could not, for example, today be used\nto support the Ptolemaic concept of the universe. This is because\nscience has progressed and common linguistic usage has changed\ndrastically in its train. Five hundred years ago, if Mr Flew's sys-\ntem had been applied to astronomical matters, we would have dis-\ncovered the truth that the earth lay at the centre of the universe.\nIt seems doubtful whether this system can be decisive in answer-\ning the more difficult questions of the human mind and soul.\nIt is generally agreed that, while the facts of parapsychology do\nnot need any further experiments to establish them, they do need\na vast number of experiments to discover more about them. But,\nas Plesch,^ among others, has pointed out, there is need for a\ntheory to account for them, a theory which may be tested by\nfurther experiments. Mr Flew asks in his first paragraph how\nobjects as elusive as psyches may be detected. This may be done\nby detecting the postulated and necessary influences they may\nexert on material systems in physical space. Electrons are un-\nobservable for another reason. They are too small. But their\nbehaviour can be followed by using such devices as Wilson's cloud\nchamber. We require analogous devices for investigating psi-fields.\nMr Stevens wonders why I did not make any further reference\nto the theory of the psyche that he favours (\n(i) on p. 500). I had\nalready pointed out its shortcomings in the first section of my\npaper. I do not unconsciously assume that 'there must be a mind\naround the place somewhere'. I have suggested an exact formula-\ntion for this 'whereness' of the entity that might well be called\n'mind', though I would agree that it is better to call this additional\norgan the psyche. In an article in the Journal of Parapsychology ^\nMr Stevens says, 'Those who study behaviour in relation to brain\nstructure . . . have endeavoured to observe the activity of the whole\norganism in its environment . .\n.'\n(p. 130) and 'we would deal with\nthe function of the organism as a whole' (p. 132). It is a very bold\nassumption to hold that the body and brain of a man is the whole\norganism and that the physical world is his total environment.\nI should like next to deal in more detail with a most important\n^ P.

I\nam suggesting that they ought to be differentiated under the\ndeterminable of location in space. I do not think that anyone\nwould deny that the perceived body is extended in space. Russell\nBrain ^ has stated, 'In our awareness of our own bodies we are\ndirectly aware of a three-dimensional object.' The question then\nimmediately presents itself, 'What is the necessary spatial relation\nbetween the perceived body and the actual physical body?' There\nare three possible replies :\n(i) The perceived body is coincident in space with the\nphysical body. (This is the almost universal view of common\nsense.)\n(ii) The perceived body is coincident in space with the body-\nimage in the brain of the physical body. (This is the current\nposition in neurology and allied disciplines, though it is not\nusually stated in this form. It is usually left implied, so deeply\nrooted are our common-sense notions.)\n(iii) The perceived body is made of mind-stuff and is spatially\nindependent of any part of the physical body.\nThe neurological and neuropsychiatric evidence must make us\nvery doubtful of (i). The perceived body can change its shape\nand size quite independently of the state of the physical body and\ndoes this in cases where the mind is quite clear, and the judgement\nunclouded. The best examples may be found in the phenomena\nof 'phantom limb' and in people under the influence of mescaline.\nOne of our subjects, who was at the time in a state of observational\nintegrity, experienced the sensation that his perceived body\nexecuted a series of complete turns from the waist down around\nits longitudinal axis. He described it as being a most alarming\nsensation. As he said later : 'It felt just as though I was being\nwrung out like a sponge. I could never have imagined the experi-\nence without having taken the drug. It was quite foreign to me.'\nSurely it is not possible for a body with its lower half reversed to be\ncoincident with the physical body which of course cannot execute\nsuch movements? Mescaline interferes with the biochemical\nprocesses in the brain that support the electron patterns that\ndelineate the body-image in the brain. It may even cause the\nperceived body to disappear altogether, and to be replaced by a\nhumming feeling. All that has happened is that the electronic\narrangements conducting the patterns of bodily sensation have\nbeen 'scrambled'.\nIn (ii) the difficulty is that the perceived body is not the same\nshape as what appears to be the body-image in the brain.

Ehrenhaft's system of minute dust\nparticles suspended in a low vacuum in a beam of concentrated\nsunlight would seem to possess an important property similar to\nthat postulated by Eccles for the 'neurone net' in his development\nof this concept : e.g. a high degree of 'poise'. They also possess\nabundant free energy, as does the brain. It is interesting that\nEhrenhaft's discoveries were made when he was using an instru-\nment devised to detect minute magnetic forces. It is evident that\nany physicist investigating the behaviour of such a delicately\nbalanced system, with which psi was in fact interfering, would be\nled to construct curious theories to account for these phenomena,\nif he left psi out of his range of possibilities. Ehrenhaft has in fact\nattempted to account for his phenomena by means of theories with\nwhich other physicists disagree violently. I visited Professor\nEhrenhaft in March 195 1, and am able to confirm Rabel's report\nfrom personal witness, and further to suggest that Rabel's one\nproff'ered explanation for this phenomenon (that it is due to\nirregularities in the shape of the particles) seems to be untenable\nsince dusts of such widely differing shapes as graphite (flat plates)\nand sponge sperm dust (globules) may be observed to spin along\nexactly similar complex paths. Incidentally, the dust particles\nseem to be tracing out Lissajou figures and a mathematical\nanalysis of these might yield interesting results.\nIt is also just possible that Wy may be responsible for the move-\nment of electrons in the brain that causes the alpha-rhythm (and\nperhaps other rhythms) of the Electroencephalograph, and also for\nRohracher's phenomenon ^\n\u2014the minute, constant, and regular\nmechanical vibration of the human body and the earth at a fre-\nquency of about 10 cycles per second.\n^ See M.

When we change from inspection\nto perception (both in Broad's sense),^ we should change the\nframe of reference we are using. The two frames may be so re-\nlated that there is at least one axis in each set which is in that set\nonly.\nThe relation R in Broad's formula o\u2014R\u2014s may be one of\nconnexion by signalling mechanism. ^ .\nThe two fundamental processes in the central nervous system\nof excitation and inhibition may also extend to the relation be-\ntween the brain and the psyche. The brain may also have the\nadditional function of exerting a continual inhibition over mind-\nstuff, which may not be a mere passive mediator of sense patterns\nand will but may possess the potentiality of a fierce life of its own.\nThe natural activity of mind-stuff may be the production of images\nand pictures of startling beauty, intense poetic integrity, and\ncharged with an elemental significance and meaning. It is possible\nthat this inhibitory function of the brain may itself be inhibited by\nmescaline. I feel that the phenomena produced by mescaline are\nof absolutely fundamental philosophical importance.^ It seems\nunlikely that visions of such overpowering beauty as mescaline\nproduces, and the extraordinary way in which the drug causes the\nperceived world to become very much more beautiful, are pro-\nducts of a sick brain. Some mescal visions are the most beautiful\nthings that man on this planet has ever witnessed, so many intelli-\ngent people who have experienced these things have alleged.\nThey can only be given an adequate explanation by supposing that\nthey represent the beauty of the soul (in Plato's phrase) gaining\npartial release from its domination by the brain.\nA Revised Set of Postulates (with Notes)\nThe basic postulate\nI.

The boundary surface\nbetween psychical space and physical space is a dimensional inter-\nface. In this case the topological boundary of the total human\norganism is formed by the skin and the surfaces of the psychical\nmechanisms associated with the individual observer.

His conclusions on pp. 392-3 and\n543-4 are revelant to this theory.\nREVIEWS\nReligion and the New Psychology. By Alson J. Smith. With\nIntroductions by Dr J. B. Rhine and the Right Rev. Austin J.\nPardue. New York, Doubleday, 195 1. 192 pp. $2. 50.\nThe New Psychology, for Dr Alson J. Smith, is parapsychology,\nand he has discovered parapsychology as bringing new hope, 'the\nhope of the world in this time of crisis', to 'the millions of nominal\nChristians . . . whose acceptance of the scientific method has\nshaken their faith'. For 'parapsychology . . . can make religion\nintellectually respectable and science emotionally satisfying' (p. 6).\nThis enthusiasm, appropriate enough in a good Methodist, has\nnot prevented him from writing a book based upon a very wide\nknowledge of the history and present position of the subject. And\nthe two Introductions, by the Protestant Episcopal Bishop of\nPittsburgh and by Dr Rhine, both much more than formal com-\nmendations, should secure his book a reading in both camps.\nThat by Dr Rhine has indeed a note of personal autobiography\nwhich gives it considerable importance, and the whole book has\nthe authentic hall-mark of Duke University upon it. The writer\nhas a first-hand and up-to-date knowledge of the experimental\nwork which is going on there, and has had access to the records of\n\f1952] Reviews 57 ^\nI\nits early successes as well as to the later more carefully controlled\nexperiments in which those successes are now being tested. He\nhas also read widely in the history of psychical research, on both\nsides of the Atlantic, and with all his enthusiasm gives a by no\nmeans uncritical survey of the history from Patience Worth and\nthe Fox sisters to the present day.\nHis purpose lies in the presentation of the growing rigour of the\napplication of scientific method to fields of enquiry which involve a\nre-casting of some of the most cherished presuppositions of modern\nscience. Parapsychology is now a scientific subject, but it obvi-\nously opens the door to hypotheses for which science has, until\nlately, found no use. Some of man's oldest intuitions are becoming\nrespectable again, after long years of discredit. Personally I find\nDr Alson Smith's theological interpretations a little too enthusi-\nastic. I respect and agree with his intentions, but there are a good\nmany gaps between the findings of parapsychology and his vision\nfor the Church of tomorrow. We are a long way yet from seeing\nin parapsychology the hope for the re-union of Christendom 'by\nemphasizing that supernormal element that all denominations have\nj\nin common', and by the revival of 'religion's ancient faith in man'\n(p. 174). And a church whose password is not 'Credo' but 'Amo'\n(p. 175) will in fact have a creed, drawn directly from the New\nTestament (I John iv. 21, et passim), and one which parapsychology\nhas not yet gone very far to affirm.\nReal students of parapsychology will, naturally enough, find\nlittle that is new in this vigorous survey, and some inaccuracies\nwere inevitable, as in the references to Miss Beauchamp, where\n'Sally' is given a second identity, and Doris Fisher, where the\nmore critical survey by T. W. Mitchell would have helped the\nwriter. He also does not know how open to criticism is the evi-\ndence for An Adventure, though he shows a proper hesitation\nabout it. And some of his accounts of the phenomenal scoring by\nsubjects at Duke University, though true as they stand, need to be\nread with a caution which those who know something about the\nlater work there will be able to provide, but which may be lacking\nin the general reader.\nBut it is a stimulating and a lively book, and I am glad to have\nread it.\nL.

Although Lewis Spence\nbelieves that Second Sight can be supernormal, 'When ignorant\nand unlettered folk seek to enhance the circumstances of a tale in\norder to make themselves momentarily important, they usually\nfall back upon the stock material of primitive fiction'. This may\nwell 'ring a bell' with the student of poltergeists, particularly the\nclassic cases.\nIt is unusual in a book of this type to find not a single mention\nof the Society for Psychical Research or of its publications.\nMr Spence appeals to psychologists to digest and elaborate on\nthe material he has collected, so it is a pity he has not provided an\nindex.\nD.

In some other cases,\nreaders may feel that the incidents he relates are more easily\nexplicable by normal means than M. Leroy seems to admit. He is,\nhowever, commendably cautious in the conclusions he draws, and\nstudents of psychical research will agree with him that an incident\nshould not be dismissed as impossible on a priori grounds.

Thouless\nCORRESPONDENCE\nESP AND Information Theory\nSir,\u2014I listened recently to a wireless discussion of the results of\nexperiments in psychical research and after I had thought over\nwhat I had heard, an idea came to me for an interesting test to be\napplied to existing data. My suggestion concerns the application\nof the concepts of the mathematical theory of information.\n\f574 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jan.\nThe results of all the experiments which I have heard described\nhave been analysed without any explicit account being taken of the\ntime element involved. It is true that the effects of varying the\nrate of presentation in the five-card experiments have been noted,\nbut time does appear as a variable in the statistical analysis. But\nin the communication of information from one place to another\n\u2014\nand the telepathy experiments would appear to be tests of some\ncommunication system\u2014time is an essential parameter. In a\nfundamental paper, C. E. Shannon has shown that the physical\nproperties of a channel place an upper limit on the rate at which\ninformation can be transmitted through it, and that this limit is\nindependent of the form the signal takes. It is thus of interest to\ndetermine whether the same sort of limitations apply to the psi\nchannels.\nThe starting point of information theory is the setting up of a\nnumerical measure of amount of information, and the unit now\ngenerally adopted is the binary digit\u2014the information contained in\nthe correct choice from a pair of equally probable alternatives.\nThe next step is the determination of the a priori probabilities p\u201e\nof the possible messages. The a priori 'entropy' of an ensemble\nof possible messages is defined as the sum of -p^ log2^\u201e over the\nwhole ensemble. When a message is received unequivocally, the\na posteriori probability of that particular message becomes unity\nand that of all the others zero. When it cannot be assumed that\nthe received message is correct, i.e. that it is the one transmitted,\nour a posteriori knowledge can be expressed only as a new set of\nprobabilities p^' calculated from experience of receiving a number\nof messages. The average information contained in a message is\nthe difference between the a priori and a posteriori entropies. In\nthe first case quoted above\u2014where the message is received un-\nequivocally\u2014the a posteriori entropy is zero, so the average infor-\nmation in a message is directly measured by the entropy of the\nensemble from which the message is selected.\nIn the five-card experiment the a priori probability of each\nelementary message is 1\/5. Let us denote the probability of the\nreceived message being correct by (1\/5 If 5X is small com-\npared with unity, then it is easily shown that the average informa-\ntion in each message is 2x logs e binary digits. The rate at which\nmformation is being transmitted is zxN logj e binary digits per\nminute, where is the number of cards exposed per minute.\nNow, if the psi channel is saturated, we should expect this\ntransmission rate to be constant independently of how rapidly\ncards are presented, so that the excess of the receiver's score above\nchance should be inversely proportional to the rate at which cards are\npresented. To within the limits of the approximation used in this\n\f1952] Correspondence $75\ncalculation the excess of score over chance should be independent\nof the number of alternative cards. It would seem an easy matter,\nby analysis of existing data, to test whether or not these relation-\nships hold.\nThe significance of the theory of information would be under-\nestimated if the test were confined to the five-card experiment in\nits simplest form. If an information rate limit exists, it is inde-\npendent of the way the messages are coded. For example, if serial\ncorrelation between symbols was introduced, the information\ncontent of each symbol would be reduced and the number of\ncorrect guesses should rise.\nE. R. R.

Paramecia were chosen as suitable subjects for these tests\nbecause they are very common, are easily recognized, and usually\nswim about in random fashion in search of food.^ The purpose\nof the experiments was to influence, by thought alone, the direction\nin which a chosen animalcule would swim during a selected period.\nThe method of assessing the success of each attempt, vi^hich was\nmade under a low-power microscope (magnification x 75), was to\ndivide the field of view of the microscope into four by cross wires\nin the eyepiece of the instrument (Figure I). The attempt was\ntimed by a stop-watch for a given period, and the quadrant con-\ntaining the Paramecium at the end of this time was noted. The\nquadrant into which the paramecium was to be willed was selected\nby turning up cards from an ordinary pack of playing cards, each\nsuit indicating one of the four divisions.\nPROCEDURE IN THE FIRST SERIES\nA sample of water containing paramecia and mud particles was\nplaced on a flat microscope slide and a cover slip placed over it to\nprevent movement due to air currents on the surface of the water.\nA typical field of view at the start of an attempt is shown in\nFigure 1.\n^ The Paramecium is a single-celled organism, about o oi ins. long.\nIt is common in all natural pond water and propels itself in the water by\nmoving the hair-like processes (cilia) on its body.\nA 577\n\f578 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nA Paramecium was then chosen which was making more or less\nrandom movements about the field of view. No attempts were\nmade on paramecia swimming in a straight line, for these were\nmoving too fast, and it was thought that strong stimuli were al-\nready acting upon them. The microscope stage was then moved to\nbring the paramecium under the cross wires, as in Figure I. A\nstop-watch timing of 15 seconds was started, and at the same mo-\nment a card indicating one of the quadrants was turned up.\nThe timing, card-turning, and scoring may be done by a second\nperson if these activities disturb the concentration of the experi-\nmenter. In this first series some tests were made with this\nCROSS WIRE\nMUD PARIICLKS\nPARAMECIUM\nFigure I\nTypical Field of View in First Series\nassistance and some without, with no noticeable change in the\nresults. There was, nevertheless, a possibility of some error in the\ntiming in this series, and the technique was improved for the\nsecond series of tests.\nThe experimenter then attempted, by thought alone, to drive\nthe Paramecium into the quadrant selected by the card. Precisely\nat the end of the 15 seconds the position of the paramecium was\nnoted, together with the selected quadrant. The microscope stage\nwas again moved to centre the paramecium under the cross wires\nand another attempt was then made. When the paramecium swam\nout of the field of view during the test period the exit quadrant\nwas scored. Tests were considered void in which the paramecium\nappeared under a cross wire at the end of the period.\n\f1952] Two Series of PK Tests on Paramecia 579\nA separate series of runs was also made, interspersed with the\ntests already described, in which the procedure was exactly the\nsame as above except that no conscious effort was made to influence\nthe paramecia and the card was not turned up until the end of the\n15-second period.\nI have called these 'control' runs to distinguish them from the\n'attempts', although perhaps this term is not entirely appropriate\n24.4.48 25.4.48\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\nTOTAL TESTS\nUPWARD CTOVE: \"ATTEItPT\"\nvmmitss CURVE! \"control\"\nFigure II\nDeviations from Chance Expectation. Series I\nsince there was a target (post-determined) for each and, as Dr\nRhine has commented, the possibility was not excluded of the\nexperimenter becoming aware of the card extrasensorily and then\napplying the influence unconsciously either in a positive or nega-\ntive direction.\nRESULTS OF THE FIRST SERIES\nFigure II shows the deviations from chance obtained in the 794\n'attempts' and 799 'controls' which make up this series. The\n\f580 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nfinal results are tabulated in Table I. Although the field of view\nof the microscope is divided into four, the chance expectation is\ntaken to be one half. This is because I suspected that influence\napplied in one direction would sometimes have its effect in the\ndiametrically opposite direction, according to the kind of mental\nwork employed. The experimenter may either influence the\nParamecium according to his conscious will, or alternatively he\nmay set up an unconscious resistance which will strengthen\nits direct opposite, in this case the equivalent of scoring in the\ndiametrically opposite quadrant.\nAs it was not possible to ensure that the thought process was\ncontrolled correctly, both the chosen quadrant and that dia-\nmetrically opposite were, for assessment purposes, counted as\ntargets, although during the experiment only the selected quadrant\nwas treated as such. It should be remembered, however, that the\nexperimenter was aware of a success in the opposite quadrant even\nthough he would will towards the selected one. The results for\nthe selected quadrant and the one diametrically opposite may be\nfound in Table I.\nTABLE I\nSeries I Series II Series I & II\n'Attempt'\nRuns\nNumber of Runs 794 701 1495\nDeviation in\nchosen direction + 31-5 + 7775 + 109-25\nDeviation in\nopposite direction + 54-5 + 1575 + 70-25\nTotal Deviation + 86 + 93-5 + 179-5\nCritical Ratio + 6-1 + 7-06 + 9-28\nPercentage success + 217 + 267 + 24\n'Control'\nRuns\nNumber of Runs 799 701 1500\nDeviation -41-5 -15-5 - 57\nCritical Ratio - 2-94 - I-I7 - 2-94\nPercentage success - 10-4 - 4-4 - 77\nAssessing the 'attempt' runs first, shown in Figure II by the\ncurve above the chance (o) line, the total of 86 extra-chance suc-\ncesses in 794 attempts gives a critical ratio of + 6-i. Turning then\nto the 'conti'ol' runs (shown in Figure II by the curve below the\n\f1952] Two Series of PK Tests on Paramecia 581\nchance line), there appears the peculiar circumstance of a signifi-\ncant negative deviation of 41-5 (C.R. -2-94).\nAnother useful way of evaluating these results has been sug-\n;\ngested by Dr Thouless which expresses the success as a per-\ncentage of the attempts made. Thus, in the 'attempts' of the first\nseries, chance would predict 397 successes. There are, however,\n86 more than this, which means that 86 predicted failures have\nbeen turned into successes. As there are also 397 failures pre-\ndicted, the proportion of successful runs is 86\/397\u2014i.e. 21-7 per\ncent.\nIn the 'control' runs the percentage of 'success' is - 10-4, or\nabout I in 10 less correspondence with the chosen quadrants than\npredicted by chance.\nI\nCONSIDERATION OF THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST SERIES\nAn interesting and quite unexpected factor in the results is the\nnegative deviation in the 'control' runs. Figure II indicates that\nnot only is a negative deviation obtained, but the curve of this\ndeviation bears a crude likeness to the positive curve in the\n'attempt' runs.\nThis significant negative deviation can only reasonably be\nthought of as the result of E S P , unless so large a deviation can be\nconsidered attributable to chance. It is only in the mind of the\nexperimenter that the relation between target and card suit exists ;\nit is thus reasonable to suppose that his mind is the only link\nexisting between the pack of cards and the direction the Para-\nmecium will take, and that it is responsible for the negative devia-\ntion found experimentally. In practice this means that the experi-\nmenter must have extrasensory knowledge of the card suit before\nhe can influence the paramecium eff^ectively in 'control' runs.\nIf the resemblance between the two curves of Figure II is due\nto 'negative' PK applied through extrasensory perception of the\ncard, there would probably be a relation between the rate of suc-\ncess of 'attempts' and 'controls' made at approximately the same\ndate. The average deviation per 100 tests, and date, is tabulated\nbelow. This shows an approximate resemblance between\n'attempts' and 'controls' made on the same day, or within a day\nof one another (except for those made on 24 and 25 April 1948,\nwhich are discussed later).\nThis would seem to indicate that when one is successful in a\nnormal P K run, one is at the same time successful in keeping the\n'controls' well below chance expectation by ESP and PK, and if\none faculty is disturbed the other is also.\n\f582 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nTABLE II\nAverage Deviation per 100\nDate Attempts Controls\n(April 1948)\n13th 935\n15th 8-s\n17th 1\n1\n-5\ni8th Il-g\n19th 80 78\n2ISt 7-5\n22nd 3-5 2-6\n23rd 05\n24th 17-0 80\n25th 22-0 6-2\nAs this series of tests progressed, the number of 'control' runs\ncarried out were gradually allowed to lag behind the total number\nof 'attempts'.

Series I\nThese last two results are in sharp contrast to the previous two,\nand the negative deviation does not correspond with the positive\none as did the earlier tests (see Table II). Some fundamental\nchange was caused by keeping the 'control' runs in step with the\n'attempts'.\nOne of the possible interpretations of this result is to consider\nthe 'control' series as releasing forces formed in opposition to the\nintention of the experimenter, whether these are thought of as exist-\ning solely in the mind of the experimenter, or in some psychic\n\f584 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nstructure including the paramecia. In either case these forces\nwould be released through the mechanism of extrasensory per-\nception of the suit of the selecting card by the experimenter in the\n'control' series.\nThe small negative deviation obtained on 24 and 25 April,\nv\\rhere high positive scores were made, is also in keeping with this\ncompensative explanation. If a compensating force is being built\nup, the more often it can be released the less effect it will produce\nin negative deviation in the 'control' runs and depressive effect in\nthe 'attempt' runs.\nPARAMECIUU\nFILTER STRIP\nSCRATCH\n( DIVIDIHG LINE )\nFigure V\nTypical Field of View in Second Series\nchanges of procedure for the second series\nOther than the decision to make this series with 'controls'\nclosely interspersed with 'attempt' runs, it was suggested by a\nnumber of people that borderline cases, where the paramecium is\nnear the cross wire at the end of the 15-second period, might be\nmisjudged in favour of a high score. I agreed that this was a\npossible source of error, and devised a guarding procedure to\novercome it.\nThe cross wires in the eyepiece of the microscope were replaced\nby crossed strips of light blue gelatin filter, with a scratch longi-\ntudinally down the centre of each, giving a field of view as shown\nin Figure V. As can be seen from this illustration, the scratches\n\f1952] Two Series of PK Tests on Paramecia 585\ntake the place of the cross wires and the width of filter on each side\nof the scratch is about the width of a paramecium when viewed\nunder X75 magnification.\nAll scores were to be noted down as usual, and in addition all\nthose in which the paramecium was within, or partly within, the\narea covered by the filter strips at the end of the 15-second period.\nIf misjudgements were made to favour a high score within the\nfilter area, the average scoring rate for results within this area\nwould be higher than for results in which the paramecium was else-\nwhere in the field, so that comparison of average scores within and\nFigure VI\nFifteen-second Delay Circuit\nBefore the beginning of a trial the linked switches Si and S2 are as shown in\nthe figure, and the condenser is discharged through the resistance Ri. When a\ntrial is due to begin, Si is pressed on (automatically releasing S2), and the con-\ndenser takes 1 5 seconds to charge up to the striking voltage of the neon (no volts).\nThe neon then flashes, flooding the field of view with red light and a spot\njudgment can easily be made.\noutside the filter area would detect any misjudgement near the\ndividing line.\nIn addition to errors on the dividing line, misjudgements could\nalso be made in timing the 15-second period, and this also could\nbe made unconsciously to favour the score. This would apply\nalmost entirely where no assistance was used in timing the period.\nTo get over this difficulty while working alone, a neon indicator\ntube was strapped immediately under the microscope slide, to\nwhich the 15-second delay circuit shown in Figure VI was con-\nnected to enable a spot judgement to be made.\n\f586 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nRESULTS OF THE SECOND SERIES ;\nThis series consists of 701 'attempts' and 701 'controls', the\n'controls' being made after every 5 or every i 'attempt'. The differ-\nence between these was only one of personal convenience ; the scor- |\ning shows no advantage to either. Making 5 'attempts' and then |\n5 'controls' made the better working rhythm. The deviations ob- j\ntained are plotted in Figure VII and the final results are shown in\nTable I.\nOf the 444 successes in the 'attempt' runs, 253 were in the\ndesired direction and 191 in the diametrically opposite one (Devia-\ntion + 93'5 ; C.R. +7-06; percentage success 26-7). In the\n'control' runs there is a negative deviation of 15-5 (C.R. - 1-17).\nOf 501 'attempts' which were made with the guarding procedure,\n96 ended within the guarded area, giving an average deviation of\n+ 10-4 per ICQ trials. The remaining 405 trials gave an average\ndeviation of +I3'7 per 100, showing that the scoring is, if any-\nthing, slightly disfavoured by judgements near the dividing line.\n106 trials were made using a magnification of x 25 instead of the\nusual X 75 (Figure VII). The results of these were markedly 1\npoor, only 58 out of 106 being successes (Dev. +5). This low j\nscoring agrees with an impression obtained during the tests that j\nthe first impulse of influence appears to be the strongest, and that its\nmaintenance during the whole 15-second period is difficult.\nWhen a X 75 magnification is used, the paramecium often leaves\nthe field of view during the first half of the attempt period (when\nthe departure quadrant is scored), and in consequence the first\npart of any influence the experimenter has will have more effect.\nDuring the trials using x 25 magnification, the paramecium very\nrarely left the field of view during the whole 15 seconds, and the\neffort to influence it had to be maintained for the whole period.\nCONSIDERATION OF THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND SERIES\nThe high rate of success in the 'attempt' runs, the general\nstraightness of the plot (Figure VII) (discounting the period of\nx 25 magnification), and the small negative deviation in the 'con-\ntrol' runs, is in keeping with the explanation put forward for some\nof the secondary effects in the first series (page 583).\nThe results of the tests using x 25 magnification indicate that <\\\nthis is a fairly critical factor with which the length of test period ^\nmay be interdependent.\nu\nThe first part of the 'control' curve of the first and second series\n(Figures II and VII) bears a similarity which is worth noting, al- ,\nthough no conclusions may be drawn from only two such results.\n^\n\f1952] Two Series of PK Tests on Paramecia 587\nWhen more tests of this nature have been made it will be possible\nto see whether this form occurs to a significant extent.\nO CO\nEl\nH w\n< n\np\n+ 90\n+ 80\n+ 70\n+ 60\n+ 50\n0+40\n%\ng+30\n+ 20\n+ 10\n0\n- 10\n-20\nCO\nlAGNI\n-*\u2014\n25\nFICAI'I\n1 ON\n100 200 300 400\nTOTAL TESTS\nTJPWAED CURVE: \"ATTEMPT\"\nDOWNWABD CURVE: \"CONTROL\"\n500 600 700\nFigure VII\nDeviations from Chance in Series II\nCONCLUSION\nThe overall results of these two series of tests are tabulated in\nTable I. These results show that throughout the whole experi-\nment an average of approximately every fourth failure predicted by\nprobability calculation has become a success.\nThe absence of an overall decline in successes may be related\nto the procedure of making a second and contemporary series\nof tests in which no conscious effort is made to influence the\n\f588 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nscore. This, together with the practice of allowing diametrically\nopposite results as successes without prejudicing the statistical\nprocedure, may have the effect of reducing or eliminating the\ncauses of decline, which are probably psychological.\nIf the faculties of ESP and PK are accepted, however, there is\nthe possibility of results being biassed by these abilities in favour\nof a theory held by the experimenter ; successes being uncon-\nsciously reduced under circumstances in which the theory may\npredict chance results. The lack of reproduceability in this type\nof work makes it very difficult to find out whether this occurs or\nnot, but unless such secondary effects are found to be generally\nreproduceable they cannot be taken as more than reflections of the\npsychological situation in the experiment in which they occur.\nAN EXPERIMENT IN THE ELECTRO-\nENCEPHALOGRAPHY OF MEDIUMISTIC\nTRANCE\nBy C. C. Evans and Edward Osborn\nintroduction\nIf it be accepted {a) that in mediumistic trance information has\nbeen given which could not have been obtained by normal means,\nand [b) that the trance state is an essential factor in the process, it\nis important that inquiry should be made into the nature of the\ntrance itself. Even if the genuineness of the phenomena be\nregarded as open to question, it is still of interest to try to discover\nwhether the mediumistic trance possesses distinctive features of\nits own.\nThere are those who regard it as a state of hysterical dissocia-\ntion, in which 'a greater or smaller part of the personality takes\ncommand and dictates the general behaviour, the rest of the normal\npersonality becoming apparently incapable of consciousness for\nthe time being and having no influence on conduct'.^ It has also\nbeen described as a state of 'self-induced hypnosis'. Such\nopinions have been based on personal judgements, because no\nobjective evidence has been available. It was in an attempt to\nprovide data whose interpretation would not depend on individual\nassessment that an exploratory experiment with the electro-\n^ Henderson and Gillespie, A Text-book of Psychiatry, 7th ed. (London,\nOxford University Press, 1950), p. 179.\n\f1952] The Electro-encephalography of Mediumistic Trance 589\nencephalograph ^ was carried out in the Society's rooms on 20\nand 21 September 1951. Although the electro-encephalograph\nhas been used for chnical purposes for some years, the principal\ndifficulty has been to find as subjects for experiments mediums\nwhose trance is regarded as genuine and who are able to enter the\ntrance state in the conditions required for the recording of the\nE.E.G. The experimenters were fortunate in securing the full\nco-operation of Mrs Eileen Garrett as subject, and welcome this\nopportunity of thanking her publicly for making possible what is\nbelieved to be the first experiment of its kind to be carried out in\nthis country.\nA few general remarks about the E.E.G. may be helpful. The\nelectrical activity of the cortex consists of more or less continuous\nrhythmic fluctuations of potential. In normal adults, awake,\nrelaxed, and with eyes closed, the brain rhythm, in the absence of\nspecific stimulation, ranges in frequency from 8 to 13 cycles per\nsecond, with an average of about 10 c\/s., while the amplitude may\nfluctuate spontaneously. Both frequency and amplitude vary from\nindividual to individual, and to some extent within the E.E.G. of\na single individual. This rhythm, which is known as the alpha\nrhythm, is suppressed by attention or perception. During the\nprocess of going to sleep, marked changes occur in the E.E.G.\nThe various stages may be described in general terms as follows :\n{a) relaxed and resting, but awake\u2014normal alpha rhythm, followed\nby diminution of amplitude ;\n{b) drowsy, entering the stage of\nlight sleep\u2014the alpha rhythm fades away and short spindles of\nfaster activity often appear, followed by slow waves of 4 to 5 c\/s. ;\n(c) real sleep\u2014spindle-shaped bursts of waves, about 14 c\/s.,\nappear, and slow waves increase in magnitude and decrease in\nfrequency ;\n[d) deep sleep\u2014spindles disappear, and slow waves\nbecome very large and very slow, less than i c\/s.\nIn cases of hysterical dissociation there is no change in the\nalpha rhythm. It is also regarded as established that in hypnosis\nthe E.E.G. shows none of the characteristics present in sleep\nrecords. If, therefore, the E.E.G. in mediumistic trance were not\nin accordance with these findings\u2014and there are reports ^ which\ngive reason for thinking that this may be so\u2014this would indicate\n^ The electro-encephalograph is an instrument for recording the\nelectrical activity of the cerebral cortex. Electrical discharges, picked up\nby electrodes normally placed on the scalp, are amplified about a million-\nfold and activate inkwriting oscillographs which trace records on a\nmoving strip of paper. The resulting record is known as an electro-\nencephalogram\u2014E.E.G. for short.\n' For example, Thomson, Forbes, and Bolles, 'Brain potential rhythms\nin a case showing self-induced apparent trance states', Amer.J. Psychiat.,\n1937, 93, 1313-14-\n\f590 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nthat it was not identical with hysterical dissociation or the hypnotic\nstate.\nThose who took part in the experiment were Dr C. C. Evans,\nhead of the Department of Electro-physiology at Belmont Hos-\npital, Sutton, Surrey ; Dr E. B. Strauss, Physician for Psycho-\nlogical Medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London ; F. Wil-\nson, of the Development Laboratory of the Edison Swan Electric\nCompany ; and Mrs K. M. Goldney and Edward Osborn, both\nmembers of the Council of the Society. The Council are greatly\nindebted to the Edison Swan Electric Company for lending an 8-\nchannel electro-encephalograph and frequency analyser for the\nexperiment.\nE. O.\nEXPERIMENTAL SET-UP\nAn 8-channel ink-writing recorder was used in conjunction\nwith a frequency analyser.^ Six channels were used to record the\nE.E.G., while another recorded the E.C.G.^ and another the\nP.G.R.3\nThe 6 E.E.G. channels could be arranged to record either in one\ncontinuous chain extending from low down on the right temporal\narea, up over the vertex and down to the left temporal area ;\nor,\nalternatively, in two parallel rows each about 2 inches from, and\non opposite sides of, the mid-line, and running in the A.P. direc-\ntion, each row utilising 3 channels.\nThe subject was seated in a chair for all experiments, and a\nmicrophone close by recorded all conversations and utterances on a\nmagnetic tape recorder. At 30-second intervals a time signal was\nrecorded simultaneously on the sound track (through a second\nmicrophone) and on the E.E.G. record for the purpose of syn-\nchronising the two records.\n^ An instrument which resolves a compound wave form into its simple\nsinusoidal components. The E.E.G. often contains several oscillations\nof different frequency compounded together, and sometimes it is re-\nquired to know the actual frequencies of the components present, in\naddition to seeing the composite wave form.\n^ The electrocardiogram is a record of the electrical changes accom-\npanying the muscular contractions of the heart, and in this case was\nrecorded to observe the changes in the heart rate during the various\nphases of the experiment.\n^ The psychogalvanic-reflex depends on the changes of electrical\nresistance of the skin which accompany changes in the emotional state of\nthe subject under test. Any stimulus word given, or other sound or\nsituation which causes emotional change in the subject, results in a\ndeflection of the recording instrument which is beyond voluntary control\nof the subject. ......\n\f1952] The Electro-encephalography of Mediumistic Trance 591\nRecordings were made on the two successive evenings of 20 and\n21 September 1951, and the sequence of events and results of both\noccasions will be dealt with in turn.\n20 September\nPreliminary samples of the resting E.E.G. were taken, with the\nsubject seated in a chair but not attempting to go into the trance\nstate. Recordings were made for 7 minutes with the electrodes\narranged in the A.P. lines, and then for 6 minutes in the trans-\nverse plane.\nThe resting record was of low voltage, and showed an alpha\nrhythm of 11 c\/s. dominant, but this was poorly maintained, and\nat times was absent altogether. Traces of faster activity (beta\nA.P. arrangement Transverse arrangement\nrhythm) and of slower activity (theta rhythm) were also present at\ntimes, but without any definite localization. The record is rather\nlacking in any decisive rhythm or in localization of specific\nfeatures, and in that respect does not lend itself readily to accurate\nor detailed description. Such inhibition of alpha rhythm is often\ncaused by mental apprehension or by the subject taking a vital\ninterest in the proceedings, and being unable to relax sufficiently.\nThis factor was probably partly responsible for the low voltage of\nthe activity, as at the end of the experiment, just before switching\noff, the amplitude of alpha activity was greater than at the start.\nIt was decided that the A.P. arrangement for recording was the\nmost informative, and recording was continued thus while the\nsubject was asked to go into trance. In this phase a coarse tremor\nof the eyes and eyelids became apparent, and was recorded as an\nartefact in the frontal leads of the E.E.G. ; this eye tremor re-\n\f592 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nmained a constant feature of the trance state. There was also\nincrease in the muscular tone of the arm, which probably reflected\na generalised increase of muscle tone. This was recorded as an\nartefact in the channel recording the P.G.R. from the hand and\nwrist, and, com.bined with clenching movements, completely\nmasked any P.G.R. response.\nThe heart rate rose from about 93 during the resting record to\nabout 105 during the commencement of the trance state, and there\nwas much yawning.\nAfter about 2 minutes, the alleged Control 'Uvani' began to\nmake some utterances, and it was assumed that trance had com-\nmenced.\nFor the sake of clarity, the sequence of events is given below\nwith the times of occurrence :\nTime\nZero Subject asked to go into trance\u2014pronounced eye\ntremor, yawning, increased muscle tone and move-\nments, increase of heart rate.

After\nsome minutes of relatively low voltage and ill-defined activity, as\nrecorded at the commencement of the previous session, the alpha\nrhythm became more prominent, and approximately 30 seconds\nlater some 5 c\/s. theta rhythm appeared, mainly in the parieto-\noccipital leads, either replacing normal alpha rhythm or else super-\nimposed on it. This phase lasted some 15 seconds, and gradually\ndisappeared, leaving once again the lower voltage and irregular\nrhythms as seen at the start. Pulse rate was approximately 70.\nThis change, involving increase of amplitude and the presence of\nslower frequencies, and also considerable reduction of eye tremor\nartefact, was similar to that described in the first experiment, when\nthe Control was asked to remain silent on the first occasion. This\ntime, however, the medium was not in trance.\nAfter several more minutes recording, no further changes\noccurred, and Dr Strauss began to induce the hypnotic state.^\nThe immediate response to this was a violent temporary increase\nin the eye movement artefacts, but no significant change occurred\nin the E.E.G. throughout the period of hypnosis.\nHypnosis commences\u2014no significant E.E.G. change.\nConsidered to be in the hypnotic state.\nDr Strauss suggests that Mrs Garrett shall pass from\nhypnotic 'sleep' into real sleep.\nSilence\u2014no E.E.G. change.\nSilence still maintained\u2014-no E.E.G. change.

On one occasion this\nnew pattern disappeared when the Control was addressed, while\non the two other occasions it disappeared spontaneously. As this\nchanged pattern occurred out of trance as well as in trance, it can\nnot be claimed that it is related to the trance state. A condition\ncommon to the three occurrences was silence. Spontaneous\nchanges in the E.E.G. are often caused by the subject becoming\ntemporarily drowsy, and this may be the explanation of the\nchanges observed in these experiments.\nThere was no significant E.E.G. change when the subject went\ninto or came out of either the trance state or the hypnotic state.\nEye tremor and muscular tension appeared to be maximal in the\ntrance states.\nThe P.G.R. readings were masked by movement artefacts to\nsuch an extent as to be unreliable, and are therefore ignored as\nsuch.\nIn conclusion, I would stress that this is only a factual account\nof preliminary tests carried out on one individual, and that no\nclaims are made to prove nor disprove the genuineness of medium-\nistic trance by this means.\nC. C. E.\nREVIEWS\nWest African Psychology : a comparative study of psycho-\nlogical and religious thought. By G. Parrinder. London,\nLutterworth Press, 1951. (Lutterworth Library, Vol.\nXXXVII) ix, 220 pp. 25s.\nIn this volume Dr Parrinder, who was for some years doing\nmissionary work in French West Africa and is now at University\nCollege at Ibadan, discusses and summarises the various psycho-\nlogical and religious beliefs of some West African peoples. Al-\nthough the book is really a summary of such beliefs, Dr Parrinder\nshows himself well aware of the linguistic pitfalls into which so\nmany anthropologists have fallen. He points out that there is\nsomething to be said for the African view that white people cannot\nunderstand things that Africans know, and that when their beliefs\nare described in a European language, the idea in the translator's\nmind may be very dilTerent from what the African actually thinks.\nFrom the point of view of the psychical researcher the book\n\f1952] Reviews 597\ncontains much of interest, although it is clear that Dr Parrinder\nhas not attempted any really serious investigation. He notes the\npresence of phenomena which may be classed under such headings\nas possession, hypnotism, telepathy, and clairvoyance, and has a\ngood deal to say on African dreams and their interpretation accord-\ning to modern Western standards. He points out that the mechan-\nism of the African mind is not different from that of the West, but\nthat what is different is environment and tradition, a fact which\nought never to be lost sight of when dealing with mediumship\namongst African or Oriental peoples. But even when we take\nthese things into account, it would seem that investigation, even\nthough it be slight, indicates that the search for the supernormal in\nAfrica might be as unrewarding as it is in Europe. Thus, in\nquoting the account of Dr Field's work amongst the Ga people,\nthe author shows that, in cases of glossolalia, knowledge of foreign\ntongues seems to proceed from the medium's subconscious\nmemories or from words and sentences which have been over-\nheard.\nAs a succinct account of the main features of West African\npsychology and religious ideas this book is useful, and it is to be\nhoped that later Dr Parrinder will be able to describe in greater\ndetail some of those features which it is the duty of the psychical\nresearcher to examine in whatever part of the world they may be\nfound.\nE. J. Dingwall\nMental Prodigies. By Fred Barlow. London, Hutchinson,\n1951. 256 pp. I2S. 6d.\nThis is a fascinating and long overdue account of the extra-\nordinary calculating feats performed by certain gifted individuals\nwho have attracted public attention from time to time during the\nlast 200 years. Many of them, such as Zerah Colburn, were at the\nheight of their powers as young children and lost the ability when\nthey reached maturity. Occasionally, as with George Parker\nBidder, the power was retained in adult life. Most of us have\nheard of these two, but Barlow brings upwards of twenty others to\nour notice in chronological order. With Miss Shakuntala Devi\n(born 1920), who appeared recently on television, he brings us\nup to date.\nMany instances of the remarkable calculating achievements are\ngiven\u2014for example, Colburn named the cube root of 41 3, 993 '34^'\n677 in five seconds (answer, 7453). Johann Dase of Hamburg mul-\ntiphed 79,532,853 by 93,758,479 in 54 seconds. Maurice Dagbert\nof Calais raised 89 to the sixth power (496,981,290,961) in 10\n\f598 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nseconds and gave the number of seconds in 58 years, allowing for\nleap-years, in 23 seconds (answer, 1,830,297,600).\nBarlow devotes a chapter to considering the modus operandi of\nthe various prodigies. (There is almost a virgin field here for\nexperiment.) Few of them were able to analyse the workings of\ntheir own brains. Bidder, however, says : 'If I am asked the pro-\nduct of, say, 89 by 73, the answer (6497) comes immediately into\nmy mind. I muhiply 80 by 70, 80 by 3, 9 by 70 and 9 by 3,'\nDagbert and others made much use of mnemonics and in a later\nchapter the author reveals to us some of the secrets of stage\n'mentalists'. For example, any reader can learn in a few minutes\nhow to astonish his friends by giving with lightning speed the day\nof the week for any date from 1753 to 2,000 a.d. The Giant\nMemory Act, practised by many magicians, is also revealed and\nMr Barlow's own private code is a very ingenious one.\nThere are chapters on arithmetical recreations and magic\nsquares which lie rather outside the author's chosen theme, but\nthey make very interesting reading, and indeed entertaining and\nstartling facts and stories worthy of quotation can be found on\nevery other page.\nD. P.\nUnseen Adventures. By Geraldine Cummins. London, Rider,\n1951. 183 pp. 15s.\nMembers of the S.P.R. will welcome this book, written by a\nlady who has the rare distinction of being a contemporary auto-\nmatist of repute. Like Mrs Osborne Leonard and Mrs Piper,\nGeraldine Cummins has invited scientific examination and\ncriticism. Both she and her collaborator and recorder, the late\nMiss Gibbes, deserve the commendation and appreciation of all\nstudents of psychical research for their work in its cause.\nBut on the evaluation of her pubhshed work many of us will\npart company with Miss Cummins.\nOn page 46 of her book, she says : 'My extra sense has not\nmerely related these correct facts, which were unknown to me, it\nhas also insisted that these messages come from people who are\ndead. Why does my extra or sixth sense invent this falsehood.?\nFor it is a falsehood if the dead do not survive.' Then on page 133\nwe read : 'I am suspicious of the inventive powers of my sub-\nconscious mind.' Alas, the history of psychical research shows\nhow well founded are her suspicions!\nFor people who are inclined to oversimplify the problem of\nmediumship, a perusal of the Smead Case in the Proceedings of the\nAmerican S.P.R. and in our own Proceedings 'The Psychology of\nMrs Piper's Trance', by Mrs Sidgwick, will give them cause to\n\fReviews 599\nreflect. Mrs Smead, a non-professional medium, was the wife of\na clergyman who was himself a keen student of psychical research.\nMrs Smead went into trance and the information given in this\nstate invariably claimed to come from the dead. Professor Hyslop\nwas satisfied that the trance condition was genuine, but the facts\nclearly pointed to subliminal impersonation, and in this lengthy\nverbatim record there quite clearly emerges evidence that however\nhonest and worthy a medium may be consciously, the danger of\nsubconscious fabrication is always a factor with which we must\nreckon. The object of this paper was to illustrate the adapt-\nability of the subconscious to the requirements of so-called com-\nmunication. Mrs Sidgwick's detailed analysis of the Piper\nmediumship made it obvious that there were excellent reasons for\nrefusing to accept the 'communications' at their face value. Con-\ntrary to a common view, and one apparently shared by Miss Cum-\nmins, mediumship has by no means been neglected by officers\nof the S.P.R. The fact is, it often raises far more problems than\nit solves.\nSince those papers were written, further progress has been\nmade. On page 29 Miss Cummins states : 'My communicators\non the whole fail, while I am fairly successful in prophecy. . . .\nTheir gross inaccuracy was to me evidential of a separate entity\nfrom myself using my hand. . .\n.' With this statement we need\nnot concern ourselves. Nevertheless, it is evident that Miss\nCummins regards precognition as strengthening the evidence for\ncommunication, but thanks to the work of Rhine, Soal, Carington\nand others, it has come to be regarded as experimentally estab-\nlished\u2014in other words it is a form of E S P. Most of the sensitives\nemployed by Osty never claimed to be in touch with the dead, yet\nnot only were they able to acquire knowledge paranormally, but\nthey were also successful in predicting events in the lives of people\nwith whom they were able to make contact.\nIt must be undue modesty which causes Miss Cummins to\ndescribe herself as 'slow of speech and an uninformed conversa-\ntionalist'. A moderately successful authoress and playwright\nmust be thought to possess an imagination capable of being\ndrawn on. It is not difficult to conceive that the possession of\nESP in addition could produce almost anything, and we need not\nnecessarily postulate an extraneous personality to account for the\nmaterial, however striking.\nOn the other hand, the case of 'Marguerite Foote' mentioned in\nthe Appendix to the book, which was originally printed in the\nJournal, is impressive. If an investigator is satisfied that the\nevidence from psychical research taken as a whole reveals an\napparently non-physical level of the personality, capable of sur-\n\f6oo Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nviving the dissolution of the body, then he might regard this as\none of those rare cases pointing significantly to communication\nfrom the dead. He would, however, want much more informa-\ntion than is contained in the printed report.\nMiss Cummins devotes a chapter to psychometric and healing\nexperiments. The few examples of psychometry given do not\njustify specific conclusions, but in respect to healing Miss Cum-\nmins says : 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating.' Unfor-\ntunately we not only have an intangible pudding in this instance,\nbut a purely hypothetical one. Patients were said to have been\ncured. It may very well have been the effect on the minds of the\nuninitiated of a few paranormally acquired facts which made them\nmore susceptible to constructive suggestion. In the light of our\npresent knowledge, however, we can only maintain the pro-\nverbially 'open mind'.\nAll students of psychical research should make a point of read-\ning this book, not only because it is interesting but because we can\ntrust Miss Cummins to give us the facts accurately. We are all at\nliberty to form our own conclusions.\nLeah Longman\nMore than Meets the Eye. By James Langham. With an\nIntroduction by Lord Dunsany. London, Evans, 1951.\nxii, 214 pp. lUus. I2S. 6d.\nThis book is written in a popular style and is not intended for\nthe expert. Within the limits which he has set himself, Mr Lang-\nham gives a very fair picture of the various types of phenomenon\nwhich have intrigued and puzzled men through the ages. He\nincludes a description of modern methods of conducting ESP\nexperiments and a short summary of research carried out in this\nfield. There is even a chapter dealing with hoaxes which have\nbeen perpetrated on the Society for Psychical Research.\nUnder the heading 'Some Stage Mysteries' Mr Langham dis-\ncusses various stage mystery acts and comments that, while the\nmajority of such entertainers do not claim psychic faculties, the\nPiddingtons are an exception to the extent of their statement, 'So\nfar as we are concerned, telepathy works'. This would rather\nseem to depend on just what meaning the Piddingtons attach to\nthe word 'telepathy'. Mr Langham could have pointed out that\nthis statement is a good example of the technique used by stage\n'mind-readers' to encourage belief in their possession of special\npowers. Avoiding any direct claim, they make ambiguous pro-\nnouncements, and in next to no time the uncritical credit them\nwith psychic faculties. Members of the Magic Circle have\n\f1952] Reviews 601\nassured me that a skilful illusionist can duplicate and even im-\nprove on all the turns in the Piddingtons' repertoire.\nFrom 'magicians' he turns to the study of the minds of animals\nand states that while various animals are capable of realizing\ninstinctively the power of man and the demands made upon them,\nit is the dog and horse that usually 'react' with greater speed and\nversatility, presumably because of their long familiarity with men's\nways. I am not sure from this remark whether we are meant to\npresume the inheritance of this acquired characteristic. How-\never this may be, he goes on to review a number of classic cases of\ncalculating horses and talking dogs and other animals as well as\nsome more modern ones.\nUp to this stage of the book, Mr Langham has generally just\nstated the known or reported facts, has pointed out any gaps there\nmay be in our knowledge of what occurred, and left the reader to\ndraw his own conclusions without any comment from himself.\nFrom this stage on, however, one finds such comments as, 'I\nbelieve her story to be true although it is not corroborated by\ndocumentary evidence' (p. 108) or 'Both . . . are \"second-hand\",\nbut I have no reason to doubt their authenticity' (p. 137). This is\nafter earlier chapters where he has pointed out the essential\nrequirements on which to base evidence. Mr Langham is, of\ncourse, as entitled to his own ideas as any of us, but it seems rather\na pity that he should abandon the purely objective statement.\nSome of his ideas come out incidentally and it is rather startling\nto find (p. 139) the phrase 'as the dreamer enters the body . .\n.'.\nThere has been no mention of astral travelling, but it makes one\nwonder.\nGhosts and poltergeists are dealt with in the penultimate chap-\nter, while the last is simply entitled 'The Future Can Be Seen' and\nis mainly composed of reported cases of 'Second Sight' from the\npast.\nThere is a Bibliography and complete acknowledgement of\nsources and of help given by the Society.\nBlemishes in the book are few and unimportant, and it is\ngreatly to be desired that all popular expositions of the subject\nshould give as objective a picture to the general public of the state\nof present knowledge concerning matters pertinent to psychical\nresearch.\nH. S.\nJournal of the American Society for Psychical Research.\nVol. 45, No. 4, October 1951. New York, A.S.P.R. $1.50.\nIn honour of an English Quaker who settled in the United\nStates and who was interested in psychical research, the John\n\f6o2 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nWilliam Graham Lectures have been founded. The first of the\nseries was delivered in April 1951 by Professor C. J. Ducasse, one\nof the A.S.P.R. Board of Trustees, who makes a scholarly and\npenetrating survey of the whole field of paranormal phenomena.\nHe has some interesting things to say on the intellectual dilemma\nwhich confronts many of us in the study of the work of Sir\nWilli am Crookes (and elsewhere). 'In the face of this [the con-\nditions being beyond reproach], I submit that if, as indeed is the\ncase, I still find psychological difficulty in believing that the\nlevitations reported occurred, then there is for me only to confess\nthat my psychological reluctance to follow where the evidence\nleads means that I am not as rational as I should be.'\nHereward Carrington in a short paper on Hypnosis gives his\nopinion that from the point of view of educing paranormal powers\nin hypnotic subjects, hypnotists have until now been barking up\nthe wrong tree. Instead of saying, 'You are sinking down deeper\nand deeper into relaxed sleep, etc' they should say, 'You are\nrising higher and higher into a superconscious realm, etc'\n'An Unusual and Recurrent Experience' by Esther De Leau\ndescribes a typical haunting of the 'evil presence' type. An\neditorial comment by L.W.A. accords with my own assessment of\nthe report and expresses it a lot better than I could. It is not a\ntype of case that can be summarised briefly in a review.\nD. P.\nCORRESPONDENCE\n'The Clairvoyant Theory of Perception'\nSir,\u2014In reference to the review of my book, The Clairvoyant\nTheory of Perception, in the Journal (November-December 1951)\nthe reviewer has, probably from lack of clearness of exposition on\nmy part, drawn certain inferences that are contrary to the tenets of\nmy thesis. Hence the following.\nFirst of all, no theory can be expected to provide a full and\nadequate explanation both in respect of normal and abnormal\nconditions of vision. On the other hand, if the Clairvoyant Theory\nis able to give a better explanation of vision in the case of the\nmajority of normal conditions but is held to fail in a few abnormal\nconditions\u2014and the conventional theories of vision are, as we\nbelieve, incapable of adequately explaining even the majority of\nnortnal conditions of vision\u2014then, as a working hypothesis, it is,\n\f1952] Correspondence 603\nwe would contend, preferable to the latter. My thesis is, as your\nreviewer states, mainly a criticism of current theories of perception.\nIf they have any basis in fact and are valid, the above contention\n[\nof mine holds. I may cite here one of them, namely, the in-\nadequacy of the conventional theories to explain the compound\nvision of insects.\nj\nAs an example of abnormal conditions, the reviewer of my book\nstates that distortion of clairvoyant vision due to cataract will not\nfit into my theory. He says :\n'\nIt seems to be a necessary con-\nsequence of this theory that diseases of the nervous system\nproximal to the retina should not affect vision. For if we consider\nthe case of progressive cataract, as long as a glimmer of light can\nget through to the retina impulses will reach the cortex and there\nexercise their powers of evocation on the mind.'\nWith reference to the above the following two examples may be\nof interest. A resident of Nelson, New Zealand, had his lenses\nremoved for cataract and had in consequence to wear three kinds\nof glasses, for long distance, middle distance, and short distance\n(for reading). Some years after the operation he had occasion to\ngo to an optician to have the short glasses repaired. While the\noptician was fitting the repaired glasses he had to leave the patient\nto attend to a customer in an adjoining compartment. When he\nreturned he was amazed to see the patient reading (without\nglasses) a pamphlet that happened to be lying on a table close\nbeside him. The optician asked him to read out several passages\nin the pamphlet that he selected, and the patient accomplished this\ntask correctly. On being asked how he could read without the\nglasses he replied that he had in the course of time and with prac-\ntice come to see things both near and distant, and even to read a\nbook, but only for a short time as it brought on a headache. These\ndetails I unfortunately only obtained after the patient had died at\nthe age of eighty years. I have every confidence in the truthfulness\nand integrity of the optician as I had known him for several years.\nA possible explanation of the above in terms of my theory\nwould be as follows. The patient had learnt mentally by training\nto overcome the lack of well-defined and therefore weak stimula-\ntions of the retinae from the removal of the lenses, but there\nremained sufficient stimuli to initiate impulses up the optic\nnerves to evoke clairvoyant sight from points of view at the\nretinae.\nI read a book some time ago entitled A Hypnotist's Case Book\u2014\nthe name of the author I have forgotten, and as I am writing this\naway from my home I cannot give it now\u2014in which the author\nclaimed to have effected in one case a permanent cure of blindness\nand in the second only an impermanent one. If the facts related\n\f6o4 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [march\nare genuine, they would seem to support the suggestion given\nabove.\n{a) The case of a girl i6 years of age who was born only with a\nsmall part of the outer periphery of the retina intact, and con-\nsequently was totally blind. After a series of hypnotic treatments\nlasting several months the patient began first to distinguish fairly\nlarge block forms with no detail, then these forms gradually\nassumed more definite details or characteristics, and at the end of\nthe treatment she perceived them in their natural colours, eventu-\nally acquiring approximate normal vision. She was very keen to\nbecome a ballet dancer, and had so far recovered her sight after\nthis hypnotic treatment that she was accepted as a pupil in a dancing\nacademy, and eventually became a professional dancer in the ballet.\nOn the other hand, she was never able to read a printed page.\n[h) The case of a woman who had normal sight up to middle age\nand then became totally blind from '\nwhite atrophy of both\nretinae '. She attended the London Opthalmic Hospital, but was\ninformed that nothing could be done to restore her sight. After\na number of treatments in the form of hypnotic suggestion that\nshe could eventually see, in spite of the fact that not a vestige of a\nhealthy retina remained, she acquired the power of sight quite as\ngood, if not better, than before she became blind. But unfortu-\nnately this power of sight diminished every hour after a treatment,\nand in the course of a few days she became totally blind again.\nAfter each treatment the same thing happened. The cure was\nonly temporary since there were no retinal stimulations and\nconsequently no evocation of clairvoyant sight.\nIf these two cures were actually effected by a succession of\nmental hypnotic suggestions, they would seem to point to the\nability of the mind in respect of sight to overcome the diseased\nconditions in the visual sensory organs, very much in the same\nway as the rectification of damaged and diseased parts, and the\ntaking over vicariously of the functions of these parts by other\nhealthy parts in the process of growth of living organisms.\nFrom the conventional standpoint, it is generally admitted that\nvisual perception is of a mental nature ; that is to say, visual\nsensations of external material things are mental and not physio-\nlogical. The production of visual sensations by stimuli at the end\nterminals of the optic nerves in the cortex is still a mystery for\nscience, and there are many other unexplained things in connection\nwith vision that have no satisfactory explanation in terms of the\nconventional theories.\nAs evidence against my theory of vision, Dr Smythies mentions\ncertain abnormal cases such as bilateral vascular lesions of the\nparietal lobe which produce inability to perceive simultaneously\n\fig^z] Correspondence 605\na number of external objects and in which right and left orientation\nis entirely lost, which abnormal physiological conditions in the\nbrain cause '\nthe disorders of space perception directly, which is\nthe very position this theory was designed to avoid.'\nI would reply that my theory does not reject the view that\nabnormal physiological conditions in the brain may produce\nabnormal effects in clairvoyant vision. For, if clairvoyance is a\nmental faculty, such abnormal cerebral conditions as above would\nnaturally be expected to produce them. For instance, I cited in\nmy book how a drug such as santonin causes us to perceive\nexternal objects as yellow instead of their proper colour. Thus,\nin the case of ' vascular lesions of the parietal lobe '\nwe would hold\nthat their effects on vision may possibly be due to the lack of in-\ntegration or correlation in respect to the cerebral processes.\nAgain, the inability to estimate distances and to recognise whether\nan object is receding or approaching may be due to the patient not\nbeing able to perceive more than one of two objects at a time.\nExplanations on somewhat similar lines could be put forward\nfor Dr Smythies's other examples, namely from (i) to (5), which\nfor lack of space we cannot give here. Accordingly, my theory\ndoes not entail ' that diseases of the nervous system proximal to the\nretina should not affect vision ', which I exemplified in my explana-\ntion of colour blindness and the effects of santonin.\nWith reference to the cases (a) and (b), I would classify (a) as\nan abnormal example of what I call '\nCommon Perceptual Clair-\nvoyance '\nor C.P.C. ; that is to say, it comes under the category\nof ordinary visual perception since the fragments of the retinae\nenabled a very small amount of neural impulses to reach the\nbrain. Case (b) comes under an entirely different category as there\nis no stimulation at the retinae (the latter being non-existent) and\nconsequently there is no stimulation at the cortex. It might be\nclassified as a form of '\nTravelling Clairvoyance ', which requires\nno retinal stimulation. Thus, instead of a '\npoint of view '\noutside\nthe body, the mind of the patient as a result of strong hypnotic\nsuggestion clairvoyantly sees from '\npoints of view '\nat the retinae.\nMoreover, since no neural impulses travel up the optic nerves to\nthe brain, the power of exercising '\nTravelling Clairvoyance\n'\ncannot be sustained without repeated hypnotic suggestions.\nI hope this letter will go some way in removing certain miscon-\nceptions of my theory, namely, that '\nthe distorted form of the\nnervous stimuli arriving at the cortex consequent on the distortion\nof the cornea and lens bears no relation to the subsequent dis-\nordered perception of the external world.'\nM.

Our Seventieth Year\nThe Society, which came into being in February 1882, has now com-\npleted seventy years of existence. The Council feel this to be a suitable\noccasion to pay a tribute to the memory of the men and women no\nlonger with us, many of them persons of the highest distinction, who\nhave promoted the Society's work both by taking an active part in it and\nalso by generous donations and bequests. They consider that they may\nreasonably congratulate themselves and their fellow-members on the\nnumber of those who have shown a desire in recent years to^ engage\nactively in psychical research, and to assist the Society in its financial\ndifficulties. These causes for satisfaction are all the more notable in\nview of conditions prevailing since the War which have increased the\nburden of other work on most of our members and imposed very heavy\nfinancial burdens on all. The serious economic position is reflected in\nthe increased number of resignations during the year. Although the\ntotal of Members and Student-Associates elected in 195 1 was only one\nless than in 1950, there has been a net decrease of 17 in the total mem-\nbership (see p. xii).\nThe Council have for some time been considering plans for celebrating\nthe completion of the Society's seventieth year suitably, and an\nannouncement will shortly be made.\n2. Research\nThe Home-testing ESP experiments organized by Mr G. W. Fisk\nhave continued, and a large quantity of data has been accumulated.\nContact has been made with experimenters as far afield as France,\nIceland, India, Nigeria, Sweden, and the United States of America.\nThe curious negative displacement scoring has persisted (see Journal\n\fii Supplement to Journal, March-April ig52\nfor November 1951) and all possible analyses are being made to try to\ndetermine whether these scores represent a genuine phenomenon or a\nmere statistical freak\nA considerable number of tests have been made with a new technique\nof differential scoring in ESP experiments in which '\nClock '\ncards are\nused. First results are certainly promising. The formidable mathe-\nmatical problems involved in the correct appraisal of results have been\ntackled by Mr J. Fraser Nicol (now at Duke University) and by one of\nour new members, Mr Alan Mitchell, to whose enthusiastic co-operation\nwe are deeply indebted. It is hoped to publish a preliminary report\nshortly.\nTwo series of ESP tests have been carried out by Dr West using as\nsubjects psychotic patients in mental hospitals. A report for the\nJournal is in preparation. An account of some earlier work with mental\npatients has just been published in the Journal of Parapsychology, and\nDr Humphrey's report on her work in mental hospitals in London is\nexpected to be available shortly. It will be interesting to compare the\nresults of the various investigators.\nDr West is at present working on an experiment designed to investi-\ngate the connexion between motivation and results in ESP tests.\nIt is gratifying to hear that ESP research is in progress in at least three\nEnglish Universities, Oxford, Durham, and Nottingham.\nAt Oxford, Mr William G. Roll, a member of the Society, has re-\nceived a grant from the Committee for Advanced Studies and is con-\nducting experiments in ESP under the supervision of Professor H. H.\nPrice. Collaborating with him are Mr B. Babington-Smith, Lecturer at\nthe Institute of Experimental Psychology, Dr F. B. Steiner, Lecturer in\nthe Department of Social Anthropology, and Dr R. Kosterlitz, Extra-\nmural Lecturer in Psychology. Personality tests (the Bernreuter\nPersonality Inventory and the Rosenzweig Picture Frustration Test)\nare given to each subject. At present the subjects are being tested for\nESP in their normal state ; it is proposed at a later stage to test them\nunder hypnosis.\nIn the University of Durham, Dr G. D. Wassermann, Lecturer in\nApplied Mathematics at King's College, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, has\nreceived a grant from the College to carry out ESP experiments. Ran-\ndomisation of targets will be effected by means of an electronic computer\nwhich he has constructed.\nIn the University of Nottingham another member, Dr S. C. Wall-\nwork, a Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry, has been conducting\nESP experiments in conjunction with the electro-encephalograph. In\nan attempt to see whether there is any correlation between successful\ncalls or sequences of successful calls and changes in the character of the\nalpha rythm, the subject makes his calls with the recording electrodes\nin position on his scalp. This type of experiment has its difficulties,\none of them being the need to find subjects who can be relied upon to\nproduce significant scores and who also have clearly defined alpha\nrythms. The experiments, which followed a suggestion made by Dr\nJ. R. Smythies, must be regarded as exploratory at this stage.\n\fSupplement to Journal, March-April ig^z iii\nIn September (as reported in the Supplement to the November 195\n1\nissue of the Journal) an experiment in the electro-encephalography of\nmediumistic trance was carried out at 31 Tavistock Square. The\nCouncil are greatly indebted to Mrs Eileen Garrett for acting as subject\nand to the Edison Swan Electric Company for lending their latest\n8-channel electro-encephalograph and a frequency analyser. This\nexperiment, which is believed to be the first of its kind to be attempted\nin this country, may be of importance as a first step in a new approach\nto some of the problems of trance mediumship. A report appears in the\nJournal for March 1952. The magnetic tape-recorder used in this\nexperiment was the gift of Mr T. E. Wood, to whom the Council wish\nto express their warmest thanks. This piece of equipment is indis-\npensable for mediumistic sittings and has many other important uses.\nIn September Mr A. J. Garratt, then physicist to the Festival of\nBritain organization, and the staff of Ferranti Ltd kindly offered to\nplace at the disposal of the Society for experimental purposes the\n'\nNimrod '\nelectronic computer set up in the Science Exhibition in\nSouth Kensington. Mr Parsons was able to arrange two test sessions\nand was fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of Mrs Gloria\nStewart, Dr R. H. Thouless, and Mrs Frank Heywood as subjects for\nESP and PK tests. The computer was specially modified by the Fer-\nranti engineers and provided a very convenient and attractive method of\npresenting a random series of symbols. Unfortunately, no significant\nresults were obtained, and it proved impossible to arrange further\nsessions before the Exhibition closed.\nThe Officers of the Society receive from time to time requests,\nsometimes very urgent ones, to investigate poltergeists and other\nphenomena of haunting at houses in various parts of the country. So\nfar as is practicable they meet all these requests in cases where there is\nany prima facie reason to suppose that there is anything worth investi-\ngating. It is not, however, always recognized by the persons making\nthese requests that compliance with them may involve several visits to a\ndistant place or of continuous residence on the spot by an experienced\ninvestigator, and that this makes a very great demand on the time of the\ninvestigator and is in present conditions ven,' expensive. Notwith-\nstanding these difficulties, a number of cases have been investigated,\nbut none of sufRcient interest to warrant a formal report. The Council\nwish to thank members of the Society who have shown themselves\nwilling to co-operate in undertaking investigations in their own districts.\nMany members will have read in the press about a poltergeist case in\nWest Norwood during July. Mr Augustus Greenfield and his family\nwere disturbed by poltergeist phenomena over a period of about five\nweeks. The case, which was in many ways t^'pical, was ably followed\nup for the Society' by Mr Thomas Greenwell, a member who lives in the\nneighbourhood. We are also indebted to Mr Philip Paul, a journalist,\nwho provided some additional notes on the case.\nIn the psychic press much publicity has been accorded to the Super\nRay machine of the Spirit Electronic Communication Society, which\n\fiv Supplement to Journal, March-April ig32\nhas its headquarters in Manchester. Under the influence of the Super\nRay, it is claimed, many people fall into trance and are controlled by\nspirit entities. The nucleus of the apparatus is a glass-enclosed coil\nsaid to have been invented by a Dutchman named Zwann. Mr Alan\nMitchell, a Bournemouth member of the Society with a considerable\nlaiowledge of electronics, reports that the device would not be expected\nto produce any physiological effect. Another electrical engineer has\nconfirmed this. Dr P. H. Plesch kindly reported on the device in action\nin Manchester. It had no effect on him personally, but he witnessed its\neffect on others. He was not impressed, and there was no way of\ndistinguishing the effect of the machine from the influence of suggestion.\nAn Oxford County Engineer, Mr George De La Warr, received some\npublicity during the year in connexion with his claim to have designed\na camera which photographs the past. It is said to be based on the\nfamiliar idea that every animal, vegetable, and mineral substance has a\nspecific radiation. Mrs Oliver Gatty, a member of the Council, made\ncontact with Mr De La Warr, but owing to the cloak of secrecy which\nsurrounds his laboratory she was not able to make a full investigation.\nMuch publicity has lately been given in the press to psychic healing.\nAt the suggestion of the late Mr Abdy Collins, efforts have been made to\nconduct an inquiry into the healing powers of Mr Harry Edwards, the\nwell-known spiritualist healer. At the instance of Mrs Goldney, the\nOrganizing Secretary, Dr Louis Rose, a London psychiatrist, has\nagreed to carry out an investigation. This must be considered a long-\nterm project.\nTwo large meetings for platform clairvoyance from a well-known\nmedium were held on the Society's premises during the year in test\nconditions. These involved a great deal of preliminary work and\nsubsequent analysis, and it is hoped that a report will be published later.\nA great part of the Society's work throughout its history has depended\non the co-operation of persons appearing to have supernormal powers of\nsome kind, and willing to have those powers investigated under such\nconditions as will exclude the sources of error that experience has\nshown to be prevalent in the absence of proper precautions. Not-\nwithstanding widespread inquiries and strenuous efforts, the Council\nhave not recently been fortunate in finding suitable subjects for in-\nvestigation in many of the traditional branches of psychical research.\nIn the Spring Dr Soal, accompanied by Mrs Soal, visited the United\nStates and spent some weeks at Duke University, where he worked on\nan inquiry into '\nposition effects '\nin Mrs Stewart's data (see report in\nthe Journal of Parapsychology, September 195 1). Dr Soal delivered\nlectures at Yale University (Wooderson Foundation Lecture), Pittsburg\nUniversity (at a meeting sponsored by Sigma Xi) ; the College of the\nCity of New York, Psychology Dept. ; the American Society for\nPsychical Research, New York ; the AH Universities Psychology Club\nat Boston University ; the Washington Society for Psychical Research ;\nDuke University ; and the University of North Carolina (Statistical\nDept.).\n\fSupplement to Journal, March-April ig52 V\nMembers of the Society will be interested to learn that since August\nDr Soal has been engaged on a book entitled Modern Experiments in\nTelepathy to be published under the authorship of himself and Mr F.\nBateman by Faber and Faber Ltd.\nIn May Mr J. Fraser Nicol, a member of the Council, joined the staff\nof the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University. The Council\nconsider that Dr Soal's visit and Mr Fraser Nicol's work at Duke\nUniversity are likely to further the very fruitful collaboration that has\nalways prevailed between British and American psychical researchers.\nAnother officer of the Society who visited the Parapsychology\nLaboratory was Mr Edward Osborn, Editor of the Journal, who spent\na few days at Duke University in June while on a short visit to the\nUnited States.\n3. Finance\nThe accounts show that the total excess of income over expenditure of\nthe three Funds (Blennerhassett, Research, and General) taken together\nis \u00a3S6g. This is in spite of the fact that salaries show a considerable\nincrease over the year, owing to the appointment of Miss Nangie\n(part-time) and the honorarium now being paid to the Editor of the\nJournal. It must, however, be borne in mind that expenditure on\nprinting has been lower than usual, owing to the issue of fewer publica-\ntions during the year, and that there has been little demand on the\nResearch Fund. Further, the Society may have to pay some ;^6oo in\ndeath duties on the gift of ;\u00a3iooo made by the late Lord Rayleigh a few\nyears ago. A further anxiety is the question of the Society's future\npremises when the present lease runs out in five years time.\nThe Society has been fortunate enough to receive several bequests\nand gifts during the year. Among these may be mentioned a legacy of\n\u00a32\u00b0\u00b0 from the estate of the late Miss May Walker, and a most generous\ngift of .^100 from a member who wishes to remain anonymous.\nThe Council wish to express their warm appreciation of the donations\nwhich many members regularly make in addition to the annual sub-\nscription. In view of the fact that the subscription has not once been\nincreased during the past seventy years, such gifts are a valuable\naddition to the Society's revenue. The Council earnestly hope that\nmore members will find it possible to make donations of this kind,\nhowever small.\n4. The Press and Broadcasting\nMore space than usual was devoted to articles on psychical research\nin the popular press. In May and June a series of articles under the\nheading of '\nThe Sixth Sense '\nwas published by the London evening\nnewspaper the Star. The articles were by a Star features writer,\nMerrick Winn, who is a member of the Society, and technical advice\nwas given by Mr Denys Parsons. The subjcts covered were telepathy.\n\fvi Supplement to Journal, March-April ig52\nj\nclain'oyance, apparitions, psycho-kinesis, and precognition. Spiritual-\nism and mediumistic phenomena were not included. Although the\narticles had to be popular and entertaining in character, the author must I;\nbe commended for avoiding the sensational note which is so often\nassociated with popular articles on our subject. The articles were\nfollowed by publication of spontaneous cases from readers' letters\nextending over six weeks, one guinea being paid to the writer of each\nletter published. About 2,000 letters were received by the Star, and\nabout 800 were published. A few cases which appeared promising\nwere followed up by members, but with disappointing results. Mr\nWinn's articles were also printed by a number of provincial news-\npapers.\nTowards the end of the year, the Sunday Chronicle, the News Chronicle,\nthe Sunday Pictorial, and Reynolds Neios each published several articles\non the more sensational kinds of alleged paranormal phenomena. In\nthe United States, the mass-circulation magazine. Collier s, printed an\narticle by Robert Musel rather inappropriately entitled '\nCan Man\nForesee the Future? '\nThis was based on material supplied by the\nSociety, but contained inaccuracies and was accompanied by drawings\nwhich can scarcely be said to have contributed to an understanding of\nthe subject.\nPsychical research was the subject of several B.B.C. broadcasts during\nthe year. On 27 July the Home Service programme included a dis-\ncussion on telepathy, previously broadcast in the Midland Home\nService, the speakers including Dr S. G. Soal, Dr R. H. Thouless, and\nProfessor A. C. Hardy, all of whom are members of the Council. On\n3 September Mrs K. M. Goldney gave a broadcast in the '\nBooks and\nPeople '\nprogramme of the '\nLondon Calling Asia '\nservice of the\nB.B.C. It was a general talk on psychical research, linked with a\nreview of Paul Tabori's book Harry Price : the biography of a ghost-\nhunter. On the 19th and 26th of the same month Mr Antony G. N.\nFlew, Lecturer in Philosophy at King's College, Aberdeen, and a mem-\nber of the Society, gave two talks in the Third Programme on '\nThe\nSignificance of Parapsychology ' (published in the Listener of 27\nSeptember and 4 October). During the summer Mr W. H. Salter\ntook part in a programme, broadcast in the Midland Home Service,\nmarking the centenary of the birth of Sir Oliver Lodge.\nPsychical research also featured in the B.B.C's Television Service.\nOn II July Dr J. Bronowski and Anthony Barnett devoted the fourth\nof a series of programmes called '\nEnquiry into the Unknown '\nto one\nentitled ' Telepathy : is it fact or fake? ' This included a demonstration,\nin which Mrs Gloria Stewart acted as percipient and Mr Denys Parsons\nas agent, of one of the methods used in properly conducted ESP experi-\nments.\n5.

W. Lambert, c.b., and\nKathleen Gay\nOn the 4th August, 1951, two English ladies, Mrs Dorothy Norton\n(pseudonym) and her sister-in-law Miss Agnes Norton (pseudo-\nnym), while staying for a holiday at Puys (Puits) near Dieppe\n(France), had a remarkable experience in the nature of a collective\nauditory hallucination. In order to safeguard those concerned\nagainst unwanted publicity, the real names of the percipients and\nthe exact address at which they were staying are not given in this\nreport. For the sake of brevity the two percipients are referred\nto below as D. and A. respectively. Their ages at the time were\nthirty-two and thirty-three.\nD., accompanied by her two young children and their nurse,\narrived at Puys on the 26th July, 1951, A. having arrived on the\npreceding day, for a visit lasting till August 5th following. Puys\nwas chosen for the holiday by D. and her husband during a three-\nday visit to Dieppe at Easter 1951. Neither percipient had any\nparticular interest in what happened at Dieppe during the Second\nWorld War. Both had read in the press about the Dieppe Raid\nof the 19th August, 1942, at the time of its occurrence, but had not\nlooked up the history of it in connexion with the visit. They have\nbeen friends since childhood, but had not previously been on a\nholiday together.\nThe percipients' Statements recording what they heard are\nreproduced below. They are based on notes taken during the\nexperience, which, it will be seen, lasted nearly three hours, from\nabout 4 a.m. till about 7 a.m. The Statements were prepared\nfrom the notes partly on the same day (4th August) and partly on\nthe following day, before the party left for England. At D.'s sug-\ngestion the notes were written independently. The Statements\nwere posted to the Society by D. with a covering letter dated 9th\n^ 607\n\f6o8 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nAugust, written after her return. This letter merely described the\ncircumstances in which the experiences took place, and inquired\nwhether the Society had had any other reports of this kind. The\nwriter of this report has seen the notes from which the Statements\nwere prepared, and has checked the Statements against them.\nAt Puys D. and A. shared a bedroom on the second floor of a\nthree-storey house facing towards the sea, which was about a\nquarter of a mile away, down a steep path. The house had, so they\nwere informed, been used as quarters for German troops during\nthe war. The nurse and two children, who heard nothing unusual,\nwere in another bedroom on the same floor, two doors away. The\ntimes mentioned in the Statements were taken by D. and A. from\ntheir wrist watches. Both percipients agree that A.'s watch was\nkeeping better time than D.'s, which was losing slightly. A. was\nin the Women's Royal Naval Service during the war, and became\naccustomed to the accurate recording of time. A.'s time is there-\nfore to be preferred, where there is any discrepancy. Both\nwatches were set to 'Single Summer Time' (one hour ahead of\nG.M.T.), which was also in use on the 19th August, 1942, for\nservice purposes in the Allied Forces and for civil purposes in\nFrance. The weather was fine throughout the experience.\nI. Copy of statement by Mrs Dorothy Norton\nSaturday, August 4th, 1951\nAt 4.20 a.m. A. got up, and went out of the room. I said\n'Would you like to put the light on?', but she didn't. She came\nback in a few minutes. She said, 'Do you hear that noise?' I\nhad in fact been listening to it for about 20 minutes. I woke up\nbefore it started. It started suddenly and sounded like a storm\ngetting up at sea. A. said she had also been listening to it for\nabout 20 minutes. We lay in the dark for a little listening to the\nsound. It sounded like a roar that ebbed and flowed, and we\ncould distinctly hear the sounds of cries and shouts and gunfire.\nWe put the light on and it continued. We went out on the\nbalcony where we could look down towards the beach, though\nwe could not actually see the sea. The noise came from that\ndirection and became very intense, it came in rolls of sound and\nthe separate sounds of cries, guns and divebombing were very\ndistinct. Many times we heard the sound of a shell at the same\nmoment. The roaring became very loud. At 4.50 it suddenly\nstopped. At 5.5 a.m. it started again and once more became\nvery intense, so much so that as we stood on our balcony, we\nwere amazed that it did not wake other people in the house. By\nnow it was getting light, cocks were crowing and birds were\nsinging. We heard a rifle shot on the hill above the beach.\n\f1952] The Dieppe Raid Case 609\nThe sounds became more distinctly that of divebombers\nrather than the cries and shouts we had heard earHer, although\nwe could still hear them. The noise was very loud and came in\nwaves as before. It stopped abruptly at 5.40.\nAt 5.50 it started again but was not so loud and sounded more\nlike planes. This died away at 6 a.m. At 6.20 the sound be-\ncame audible again but it was fainter than before, and I fell\nasleep as I was very tired.\nI was woken by a similar sound on Monday, July 30th, it\nsounded exactly the same only fainter and not so intense. At\nthe end I seemed to hear a lot of men singing. It ended when\nthe cocks started crowing and I went to sleep. My sister-in-\nlaw did not waken.\n2. Copy of statement by Miss Agnes Norton, sister-in-law of\nMrs Dorothy Norton\nSaturday, August 4th\nI woke in what I realized was very early morning although\nnot yet dawn as no birds were singing. I was immediately\naware of a most unusual series of sounds coming from the\ndirection of the beach which were cries of men heard as if above\na storm.\nAfter listening for about 15 minutes I got up to leave the\nroom and D. spoke to me and asked if I would like to put on the\nlight which I did not in fact do. On my return I asked D. if she\nheard the noise too, and she said 'Yes', whereupon we put on the\nlight and checked the time as 4.20 a.m. Our next move was out\non to the balcony where the sounds intensified and appeared\nto me to be a mixture of gunfire, shell-fire, dive-bombers,\nlanding craft and men's cries. All the sounds gave the im-\npression of coming from a very long distance, i.e. like a broad-\ncast from America in unmistakable waves of sound. At 4.50\na.m. all noise ceased abruptly and recommenced equally\nabruptly at 5.07 a.m. At 5.50 a.m. planes distinctly heard in\nlarge numbers and other fainter sounds dying away at 6 a.m.\nAt 6.25 men's cries heard again growing gradually fainter and\nnothing at all heard after 6.55 a.m.\nThe remarkable feature of this case is the close correspondence\nbetween the times of the 'battle sounds' heard by the percipients\non the 4th August, 1951, and the times of the actual battle sounds\nresulting from the operations on the 19th August, 1942. The\ncorrespondence is brought out in tabular form below, but the\nreader will be in a better position to appreciate the comparison if\n\fReproduced by permission of the Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office\n\f1952] The Dieppe Raid Case 611\nhe is first given a brief outline of the plan and course of the Raid.\nFor fuller accounts, see the section on Dieppe in the volume\nNorway-The Commandos-Dieppe ^ by Christopher Buckley, which\nwas published in January 1952, some five months after the experi-\nence of the two percipients, and The Canadian Army 1939-45 ^ by\nColonel C. P. Stacey.\nAt Dieppe, as will be seen from the accompanying map, the\nFrench coast runs, roughly speaking, east and west. The plan was\nfirst to land small forces by surprise at places on either side of\nDieppe to destroy coastal batteries. These flank landings, as\nthey were called, were directed to Puys, about il miles east of\nDieppe, and to Berneval, about 5 miles further east ; also to\nPourville, about 2\\ miles west of Dieppe, and to Varengeville\nabout 3 miles further west. All these flank landings were due to\ntake place at 4.50 a.m., to be followed half an hour later, at 5.20,\nby the main landings at Dieppe itself. The main landings were to\nbe preceded and covered by a bombardment of Dieppe by the\ndestroyers accompanying the force, and by air attack.\nIn the event the flank landings west of Dieppe took place\npunctually. They met with so little opposition on the beaches\nthat they were doubtless hardly heard at all at Puys, on the other\nside of Dieppe. On the east, the allied vessels closing on Berneval\nran accidentally across a small protected German convoy at 3.47\na.m., when about seven miles from the French coast. Firing\nstarted immediately after between the opposing vessels, and the\nnoise gave about an hour's warning to the Germans, anyhow on the\neast side of Dieppe. The accounts of the engagement do not\nshow exactly when this firing stopped, but there is evidence that\nit lasted till after 4 a.m.\nMeanwhile the vessels closing on Puys moved on, arriving 17\nminutes later, i.e. at 5.07 instead of at 4.50. (This time, 5.07, has\nbeen established as more correct than 5.05, the time indicated for\nthis landing in a report by the Naval Commander, Captain J.\nHughes-Hallett, R.N., dated 30th August, 1942, published on\n14th August, 1947, as a Supplement to the London Gazette of the\n12th of that month. That report makes the time 15 minutes late\non 4.50, i.e. 5.05.) The Germans, who had had time to man their\nbeach defences, waited until the landing craft had almost touched\ndown and then opened heavy fire on the disembarking Canadian\ntroops. A second 'wave' went ashore a few minutes later, followed\nby a further landing at about 5.45. Those troops who succeeded\nin getting ashore were confronted by a high sea-wall which gave\nlittle shelter against a murderous enfilading fire from enemy pill-\n^ London, H.M. Stationery Office, 1952.\n* Ottawa, The King's Printer, 1948.\n\f6i2 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nboxes. Very few penetrated inland, and at 8.30 a.m. the survivors\nof those pinned to the beach surrendered. Buckley (p. 249) sums\nup the situation in these words :\nIn the space of two or three hours the Royal Regiment of Canada\nhad been practically exterminated. Of 26 officers and 528 other ranks\nwho had embarked for the operation on the previous night, all the\nofficers and 496 other ranks became casualties. Two officers and 65\nothers, half of whom were wounded, were brought away ; no less\nthan eight officers and 199 others were killed ; 16 officers and 264\nothers, wounded and unwounded, fell into German hands. . .\nTo the noise of machine-gun and rifle fire from positions com-\nmanding the beach there was added the sound of firing from a\nGerman howitzer battery, situated a few hundred yards south of\nPuys, which was directed at the allied shipping lying off the shore.\nThe noise of the shells passing overhead must have been audible\nto persons in the house in which the percipients found themselves\nnine years later. German records show that the number of shells\nfired during the course of that morning by the battery in question\nwas 550.\nAt 5.12 the destroyers accompanying the main force started to\nbombard Dieppe, preparatory to the landing there, and, just\nbefore that landing started, beginning at about 5.15, Hurricanes\nmade a cannon-firing attack on the sea-front buildings. The land-\ning itself was met by a heavy outburst of firing from the shore. At\nthe same time (5.20) air cover was increased to its maximum, but\nthe increasing noise of aircraft was probably masked for the time\nbeing by the naval gunfire.\nAt 5.40 the naval bombardment stopped, and the sudden drop\nin the amount of noise audible at Puys must have been very\nnoticeable. On the other hand the sound of aircraft must have\nbecome much more pronounced, rising to a maximum at 5.50 a.m.,\nwhen there was a change-over of the air cover, forty-eight fighters\narriving from England to relieve an equal number due to return\nthere. By that time, too, there was a considerable increase in the\nnumber of German aircraft overhead.\nFrom 5.50 to 6.55 there was so much activity at several points\nof attack that one cannot estimate the result in the way of noise, as\nheard at Puys. It is only necessary to add that there was a con-\nsiderable amount of noise after 6.55 (when the experience ended),\nincluding a good deal of gunfire from naval vessels covering the\nre-embarkation of allied troops.\nIn the following table the left-hand column divides the experi-\nence into phases (Roman numerals), and under each phase brings\ntogether corresponding extracts from the Statements of the two\n\f1952] The Dieppe Raid Case 613\npercipients. The right-hand column shows the officially recorded\ntimes of relevant events at the same hour of the day on the 19th\nAugust, 1942, and cites sources published before the 4th August,\n1 95 1. After 6 a.m., as stated above, the increasingly complex\npattern of events makes it hardly possible to continue the com-\nparison. If the reader should feel that, even so, the amount of\ncorrespondence between the columns may have been exaggerated\nby 'unfair' selection of events for the right-hand column, his best\nrecourse would be to read the recently published account of the\nRaid in Norway-The Commandos-Dieppe,\nbearing in mind that it\nwas not accessible to the percipients, and to study the course of\nevents against the wider background there presented.\nCOMPARATIVE TABLE\nPercipients' Statements\nI.

'By now, shortly before\n6 a.m. . . . the noise of aeroplanes\nhad risen to a constant drone, like\na net of harsh sound under the\nsky.' (Same correspondent as\nunder IV above.)\nThe only account of the Raid which was in the hands of the\npercipients at the time was one contained in a French guide book\nentitled Dieppe, a copy of which was handed to K. G. by D. They\nsay that they knew of the existence of this account, but had not\nread it before the experience started. After the noise had begun,\nthey read it on the balcony at about the middle of Phase III. It is\ntherefore necessary to examine carefully passages in the account\nfrom which clock-times up to about 7 a.m. might have been ob-\ntained. They are as follows :\n(i) Le 19 aout 1942, la population cotiere fut reveillee par une\ncanonnade en mer, au large de Berneval ; a 5h.5o, une multitude\n\f1952] The Dieppe Raid Case 615\nd'avions se pr^cipitaient sur Dieppe et ses environs, pendant que des\nflotilles sous la protection de destroyers s'approachaient des cotes et\ndebarquaient en huits points differents de Sainte-Marguerite a Berne-\nval, des contingents allies comprenant pres de 7000 hommes. (p. 30).\nNo reader not already acquainted with the facts would realize\nthat the firing off Berneval referred to at the beginning of the\nabove passage took place two hours before the time 5.50 mentioned\nimmediately after the semi-colon. Nor, from the use of the ex-\npression 'pendant que' would he be able to infer that the flank\nlandings had already taken place, and that the main landings were\nwell advanced by 5.50.\n(2) A Puys, par suite de la fausse manoeuvre d'une flotille, le de-\nbarquement fut retarde et fut effectue comme le jour se levait. (p. 41).\nThis statement is correct, but the reference to the time of the\nlanding is too vague to account for the precise time 5.07 coming\nout in A.'s statement.\n(3) L'attaque principale se produisit a Dieppe. A 5h.20, les de-\nstroyers allies ouvraient le feu. (p. 41).\nAccording to a naval report, it was at 5.12 that the destroyers\nopened fire. 5.20 was the zero hour for the landings at Dieppe, and\nthey started within two or three minutes of that time.\n(4) Vers 7 heures, une vingtaine de tanks du 'Calgary Regiment' . .\n.\ndebarquerent, sauf deux. . . qui furent coules. (p. 43).\nThese tanks arrived in vessels which touched down between\n5.35 and 6.05 and, apart from two which were sunk, were all on\nshore soon after 6 a.m.\nIt will be seen that the percipients' time-table could not have\nbeen got from the French account, except perhaps the time 5.50\nfor the sound of aircraft at Phase V. Both percipients are sure\nthat they had never heard of the existence of any of the reports and\naccounts mentioned above, apart from the French guide book and\nanything they may have read in the press at the time of the Raid ;\nand certainly had never read the Hughes-Hallett report or the\naccount in the Canadian volume. A. has also assured us that\nduring her service in the Women's Royal Naval Service she was not\nin a position to see unpublished naval reports of operations.\nBetween the 4th and 9th August, when D. wrote to the Society,\nneither percipient appears to have attempted to correlate the\ntimes given in her notes with actual battle times.\nEven if both percipients had noticed before 5.50 a.m. the state-\nment in the French guide book that a large number of aircraft\nflung themselves on Dieppe at that hour on the 19th August, 1942,\na2\n\f6 1 6 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nthat knowledge would not ordinarily have caused hallucinatory\nhearing of aircraft noise by two persons at that particular time.\nIt seems reasonable to attribute the 'appropriate sounds' heard at\n5.50 to the same cause as those heard earlier at about 4 a.m. and at\n5.07 a.m.\nThere are some details in the Statements which do not link up\nwith any ascertainable facts about the Raid, and for that reason\ncannot be attributed to or checked by reference to accounts of the\noperation. For instance, there is nothing in the accounts to sug-\ngest that noise ceased suddenly at Phase II ; nor that noises died\naway at 6 a.m. ;\nnor, as A. says, that men's cries were particularly\naudible at 6.25. There is nothing inherently improbable in any\nof the statements, if they are read in relation to happenings\naudible at Puys at corresponding times during the Raid.\nPhase III, which furnishes the most remarkable coincidence in\nthe whole series, provides also a very curious puzzle. Both\npercipients are sure that they simultaneously heard the noise start\nagain, but at this point there is a discrepancy of two minutes in\ntheir timing. They attribute this to D.'s watch having been two\nminutes slow on A.'s watch, which, as stated above, is more likely\nto have been right than D.'s. All other times noted by both\npercipients end in 5 or o, and it may be that A. was reading times\nto the nearest minute, whereas D. was reading them to the nearest\n5 minutes ;\nalso, that 5.07 was the only time 'clocked' which did\nnot, to the nearest minute, end in a 5 or o. Not to labour the\npoint unduly, the argument favours the conclusion that for the\nleft-hand column of the Comparative Table 5.07 is more accurate\nthan 5.05 for the beginning of Phase III.\nOddly enough, there is a discrepancy of the same two minutes in\nthe reports of the time at which the landing began at Puys on 19th\nAugust, 1942. Captain Hughes-Hallett, in paragraph 12 of his\nreport, makes the time 15 minutes late on 4.50 (i.e. 5.05) but\nadmits in effect that his information about that landing was sub-\nject to correction in the light of a separate report from another\nofficer who was in a better position to know what happened. The\ntime accepted as correct by the historians of the Raid is 17 minutes\nlate, i.e. 5.07, and the discrepancy is clearly due to the fact that\ntwo different observers, one in a better position than the other,\njudged differently the time at which the landing began. There\naccordingly appears to be no connexion at all between the dis-\ncrepancies as such, but as the clearing away of the discrepancies\nleaves us with a 'corrected' time 5.07, on each side of the Table,\nwe are faced with a coincidence which seems far outside the bounds\nof chance. No other landing than that at Puys is recorded as\nhaving started at 5.07, and that minute stands out with grim\n\f1952] The Dieppe Raid Case 617\nsignificance in the history of what was known as the 'Blue Beach*\nlanding.\nCONCLUSION\nAs many supposed auditory hallucinations turn out on investi-\ngation to be cases in which some ordinary noise has been mis-\ninterpreted, it is perhaps necessary to point out that that explana-\ntion will not serve here. Any theory that the noises heard were\ndue to water in pipes, or to artillery practice a long way off, the\nsound of which had been carried to Puys by some freak effect,\nwould fail to explain why no one else heard the noises. The\npercipients say that they inquired during the day (4th August) of\nseveral persons whether they had been disturbed during the night\nby any unusual noise, and received negative answers. In particu-\nlar, they asked a fellow visitor who had repeatedly complained of\nbeing disturbed at night by casual noises, as they had seen her\nbedroom light on when they were standing on the balcony listening\nto noises of 'amazing' loudness. She said she had not heard any-\nthing unusual. Nor, it may be added, could the noises have come\nfrom a cinema running through a film at an unusual hour, for\nthere is no cinema in Puys.\nOn the other hand, it would, in our opinion, be rash to assume\nthat the sounds heard were a sort of 'sound track' repetition of the\nsounds of the Raid. The various kinds of sounds heard, gunfire,\ndive-bombing, planes, a rifle shot, shouts and cries, are all appro-\npriate, but there is not enough detailed information available as\nto when the several kinds of sound first occurred to enable one to\njudge whether they are 'phased in' correctly.\nIt will be seen from the last paragraph of D.'s Statement that\nshe had a slighter and much shorter experience of the same kind\non the morning of 30th July, which was not shared by A. who was\nasleep. D. says she did not mention this to A. till about two days\nlater, as she (D.) was not in the mood to have her holiday inter-\nfered with by 'uncanny' happenings, and when she did mention\nit to A. neither of them thought it sufficiently mysterious to be\nworth pursuing. This, followed by the much more 'successful'\nperformance on 4th August, suggests that some resistance had to\nbe overcome to 'put across' the sound effects, and they may have\nbeen representative, rather than exact repetitions, arranged in a\nmanner that stressed certain clock-times by preceding intervals\nof silence.\nD. had had three previous experiences of a 'psychic' nature, but\nnone of them was a purely auditory hallucination, so she had no\nreason to expect an experience of that particular kind at Puys.\nTwo of these earlier experiences were visual hallucinations which,\n\f6i 8 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nthough involving an apparition of a person well known to her,\nwould not necessarily be considered evidential. The third took\nplace one night during her visit to Dieppe at Easter. It, too, was\nnot evidential. Consisting of a peculiarly powerful impression\n\u2014\npossibly a dream\u2014of someone being chased through her bedroom\nand towards the window, it is mainly of interest here because one\nmight possibly associate it with events which took place in Dieppe\nduring the Raid of August 1942, though this does not seem to have\noccurred to the percipient. A. has never had any other psychic\nexperience, and it seems likely that the presence of D. had some-\nthing to do with her hearing hallucinatory sounds at all on 4th\nAugust.\nWe have been impressed by the commendable pains taken by\nthe percipients to record the evidence at once, on a day when they\nmust have been busy preparing to return to England, and by the\ncandour with which they have answered questions we have put to\nthem. They both seemed to the investigators to be well-balanced\nindividuals, with no tendency to add colour to their accounts.\nNeither of them has shown any concern whatever to 'prove' by\nthe experience any preconceived theory of its cause, which would\nhave been likely to determine the form it took. Both as regards\nform and content we think the experience must be rated a genuine\npsi phenomenon, of which little or nothing was derived from\nprevious normally acquired knowledge. i '.\nThe accounts of the Raid in this report are based mainly on\ninformation contained in the published sources to which references\nare given, notably Norway-The Commandos-Dieppe by Christopher\nBuckley and The Canadian Army 1939-45 t>y Lt.

The first was exploratory, the second and third were\ndesigned to test whether extremely hostile and suspicious attitudes,\ncommonly found in certain types of mental patient, would be con-\nducive to negative scoring. In none of the three series was there\nfound any clear evidence of an E S P effect. Some of the practical\ndifficulties encountered in administering ESP tests to psychotic\npatients are described.\nIntroduction\nIt is often assumed that insane or peculiar people are likely to\nmake good psychic subjects. Certainly psychotic patients often\nbelieve themselves to be possessed of special psychic gifts.\nEhrenwald (i) has gone so far as to base a theory of schizophrenia\non the supposition that these sufferers are in fact being over-\nwhelmed by an uprush into their consciousness of a chaotic mass\nof extrasensory impressions.\nUrban (2) has carried out many card tests with psychotic\nI patients and has reported strikingly positive scores as well as\n;\nsignificant differences in scoring level between several diagnostic\nI\ngroups. This work awaits confirmation. In my view his results\nI\nare unreliable on account of inadequate experimental precautions.\nIn 1937 Shulman (3), in some tests on psychotics in the Hudson\nRiver State Hospital, obtained an overall score close to chance\nexpectation. The results from one of his fourteen disgnostic\ngroups\u2014the manic-depressive depressed\u2014give a significant\npositive deviation (CR = 3-39). This is suggestive of an ESP\neffect, in spite of the obvious selection factor, but there were not\nenough patients in his series to demonstrate that the results of the\nmanic-depressive depressed were significantly greater than what\nmight have come about by variation in the patients' scoring levels\nindependently of diagnosis.\nIn 1938 Margaret Price (4), of the Duke University Para-\npsychology Laboratory, carried out a large series of ESP card\ntests with 50 mental patients in the Ohio State Hospital. A\nreport was not published until thirteen years afterwards, since\n'the work did not meet the more stringent experimental require-\n1 My thanks are due to the authorities of the Bethlem Royal and\nMaudsley Hospital, Horton Mental Hospital, Surrey, and Northumber-\nland House, Finsbury Park, where the tests were carried out.\n\f620 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may i\nments of that time, and it had little chance for immediate publica- j \\\ntion'. In 1700 runs of high aim trials the patients achieved an t\naverage score of 5-54 (CR= 11-05, P^io-^*) and in 495 runs of i\nlow aim the average score was 4 65 (CR = 3-89, P = io-*). The [\neffect was a fairly generalised one, found in patients of all diagnos-\nj [\ntic types. A breakdown into co-operative, apathetic, and irritable I\n'\npatients showed that both the first two categories scored signifi- 1\n1\ncantly better than the last one. Thus the attitude of the patients i\nj\ntested had considerable influence upon the results obtained, 1\n,\nwhereas the nature of their mental derangement did not seem to\nmake much difference.\nDr Betty Humphrey and other American experimenters have\nrecently carried out further ESP tests with mental patients, but\ntheir findings have not yet been published.\nSeries I\nThe first series of card tests was entirely exploratory, intended\n'\nto discover any special peculiarities in the results that might be 1\nobtained from a group of unselected psychotics. Twenty-five |\npatients were tested, comprising eighteen schizophrenics, one\nschizo-affective disorder, five psychotic depressions, and one case\nin which the diagnosis proved doubtful. The patients were\nselected solely on the basis of their availability and their being\nneither too disturbed nor too uncooperative to be testable.\nEach subject was given four runs of DT trials with the standard\nESP cards. The cards were randomised, arranged in packs of\ntwenty-five, and enclosed in numbered envelopes by an assistant.\nThe experimenter presented the envelopes to the subject one at a\ntime, asking him to call twenty-five guesses at the order of the\npack from top to bottom inside the envelope. After every twenty-\nfive calls, the target envelope was opened, and the guesses checked\nin front of the subject. Since there was often no observer present,\nit was an important condition that the experimenter did not know\nthe order of the target cards until after he had written down the\nsubject's calls, and that the experimenter's record of the target\norder was later checked against the record that had previously been\nmade by the assistant who randomised the cards.\nThe results obtained showed a close agreement of total score\n(both in direct hits and displacement hits) with chance expecta-\ntion :\n-I o +1\nObserved hits 477 512 451 , .,,\nExpected hits 480 500 480\nThere was no significant scatter of subjects' scores. The largest\ndeviation obtained was by Mr T., who scored negatively. The\n\f1952] ESP Tests with Psychotics 621\nnext largest negative deviation was produced by Mrs C. These\ntwo subjects were exceptional in that both were highly paranoid\nand both fitted the experimenter into their delusory systems in a\npersecutory role. Mr T., who was one of the experimenter's own\npatients, believed that the experimenter was responsible for the\n'voices' that plagued him all day long. Mrs C, although she was\nunknown to the experimenter before the test, 'recognized' him at\nfirst sight as someone from South Africa who was concerned in a\nplot against her. Their scores were as follows :\nTable of Scores\n1st run 2nd run yd run \\th run Deviation C.R.\nMr T 2 3 I 4 -10 -2.50\nMrsC 31 5 5\n- 6 -1.50\nTotal -16 -2.8\nThis result suggested that a highly hostile and suspicious attitude\nmight be connected with negative scoring. It was with this sug-\ngestion in mind that a second series of tests was carried out.\nSeries II\nThe purpose of this series was to test the hypothesis that\nhostile, paranoid patients would tend to produce negative scores.\nTwenty-two subjects were tested. (It was originally planned to\ntry fifty subjects but, owing to the experimenter leaving the\nhospital, and the experiment proving time-consuming and\napparently unproductive, the series was interrupted.) All the\nsubjects were psychotics with paranoid delusions ; most of them\nwere suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia. A difficulty\nwas encountered in that the most hostile and most paranoid\npatients refused to have anything to do with the test, and some of\nthose who were included in the series did not exhibit overt\nsuspicion or hostility in the test situation. The method of testing\nused was DT clairvoyance, with four runs per subject, exactly as\nin Series I.\nThe results were completely null, there being no evidence of any\nnegative trend and no significant displacement effects :\n- 1 o +1\nObserved hits (23 subjects) 442 459 433\nExpected hits 422.4 440 422.4\nFive of the subjects who were noted to be especially hostile did\nnot produce outstanding scores. Series II included a retest of\nMr T., who had produced the largest negative deviation in Series I,\n\f622 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nbut this time his score was close to chance. It must be admitted,\nhowever, that in no case in Series II, not even in the retest of Mr T.,\ndid the subject express the delusion that the experimenter was a\npersecutor.\nSeries III\nThis series consisted of a group test which, Hke Series II, was\ndesigned to investigate the effect on scoring of marked hostihty\nand suspicion in the subjects. Dr F. K. Taylor of the Maudsley\nHospital supplied the subjects. They consisted of six patients\nwho met regularly once a week with a doctor in order to receive\npsychotherapy as a group. All of them were highly paranoid,\nseveral were definitely deluded and psychotic, and the rest were\nborderline cases. All of them felt persecuted, and tended to be\naggressive and suspicious in their dealings with other people.\nD. J. West sat in on one of their weekly sessions, listening in\nsilence and taking notes while they discussed their intimate affairs\nwith their doctor. At the end of the session, when it may be\nsafely assumed they were feeling peculiarly resentful and sus-\npicious, they were required to take part in an ESP test.\nThe test consisted of eight runs, DT clairvoyance, under the\nsame general conditions as in Series I and II, except that the sub-\njects wrote down their guesses, all at the same time, and all aiming\nat the same target. No significant trend was found in the results ;\nSubject No. of Runs Deviation\nA 8 +3\nB 8 -6\nC 8 +1\nD 4 +2\nE 8 +3\nF 8 +3\nTotal 44 +6\nA Note on the Practical Difficulties of Administering ESP\nTests to Psychotic Subjects\nIn the investigation of possible correlations between the mood\nof the subject and ESP scoring, psychotic patients provide useful\nmaterial, since in them moods such as aggressiveness, suspicion,\nelation, or apathy, occur spontaneously in forms more extreme\nthan are ever likely to be encountered in normal people. Unfor-\ntunately, largely because of these violent moods, psychotics are\noften uncooperative or inaccessible to the experimenter. Even\nwhen they appear superficially to agree to co-operate in the ESP\ntest, they often succeed in resisting by indirect means. They\n\f1952] ESP Tests zvith Psychotics 623\nsometimes keep up endless arguments about whether it is right for\nthem to take part in the test, or try to put off the test to another\nday. Others take so long over their calls, trailing off into such pro-\ntracted discussion of the pros and cons of each choice, that the\nexperimenter's patience becomes exhausted. Another, and even\ncommoner habit, is to employ systematised guessing. In an ex-\ntreme case they may say 'Let's have them all crosses' or 'five\ncircles, then five waves, then five stars, then five squares and then\nfive crosses'. More commonly they call the cards in sets of five,\ne.g. 'cross, square, star, wave, circle', repeating the sequence over\nand over again either in the same or reversed order. The persistent\nuse of one or other rigid system of calling, after the experimenter's\nrepeated requests to guess the cards at random, is such a common\nfeature of psychotic behaviour in the ESP test situation that it\ncould almost be used as a diagnostic aid.\nSystematic card-calling presumably tends to prevent any\ngenuine ESP response, and should therefore be discouraged. It\nwill be remembered that when Dr Soal's subject, Basil Shackleton,\nadopted fixed guessing habits, he did not score above chance. But\nno matter how far from random the subject's calls may be, spurious\nextra-chance scores cannot be produced provided the target cards\nare strictly randomised.\nThe chief disadvantage in the use of psychotic patients as sub-\njects is the great amount of time taken up in making contact with\nthem and in conducting the tests. It was not uncommon to have\nto spend a whole afternoon in obtaining a subject willing to co-\noperate and in persuading him to complete four runs, which, with\na normal subject, could easily be completed in a quarter of an hour.\nWhile the subjects' guesses have throughout this report been\nreferred to as 'calls', in practice it was found necessary to arrange\nsamples of the target cards in front of them and ask them to\nindicate their choice with a pointing finger. Many psychotics\nwere prepared to co-operate to this extent who would not have\nbeen prepared to call out audibly the names of the cards.\nREFERENCES\n(1) Ehrenwald, Jan.

London,\nRidgway, 1952. 551 pp. Illus. 21s.\nThe main purpose of this book is to discredit psychical research\n(for which the author prefers to use the emotive term 'occult\nresearch') which he says is today 'assuming alarming proportions'\nand even 'invading the precincts of our most distinguished\nuniversities' (p. 9). It has seemed to many of us that it was better\nthat experimental inquiry should be taking place into such matters,\nand that such experimental inquiry by trained researchers was the\nmost hopeful way of sifting the true from the false. Mr Rawcliffe\nseems to feel no need for such sifting ; it is all 'occultism' and,\ntherefore, all false. All that needs to be done is to think of a\n'rational' explanation of any apparently successful psi experiment.\nThere is, of course, nothing new in this position, and when\nJastrow argued twenty-five years ago that the crucial experiments\nfor extrasensory perception were not rigid enough to satisfy the\nexperimental psychologist, he could make out a reasonable case\nfor this opinion. The situation is different now. Experiments\nhave been carried out under conditions which met all reasonable\nobjections and still successes have continued. Unconscious\nwhispering seemed at one time as if it might be a plausible ex-\nplanation, and Mr Rawcliffe seems still prepared to back it\nstrongly. But psi successes have taken place under conditions in\nwhich such an explanation is absurd, e.g. in ESP experiments over\nlong distances, in precognition experiments, and in the Duke DT\nexperiments in which the target cards were known to no one until\nthe guesses were completed.\n\f1952] Reviews 625\nThere is nothing judicial about Mr Rawcliffe's survey of the\nfield of parapsychology. He reminds one rather of a prosecuting\ncounsel with a weak case, concerned to create conviction at all\ncosts. There is, for example, much abuse of the parapsychologist\nfor 'bias and incompetence' (pp. 479 and 486). There are refer-\nences to the parapsychologists as amateurs ;\nthey are contrasted\nwith the psychologists who (according to Mr Rawcliffe) reject the\nfindings of parapsychological experiments. The intention seems\nto be to suggest to the jury that Professor Gardner Murphy and\nDr Schmeidler are amateur psychologists while the author is a\nprofessional. A jury sufficiently ignorant of the facts might per-\nhaps be led to suppose that this was true.\nObviously one needs to trouble oneself less about the evidence if\nthe jury can be convinced that all the witnesses on the other side\nare unreliable. Thus, on p. 323 : 'Richet, Myers and Lodge all\nbelieved in the unseen spirit world and died steadfast in their\nbelief. This is true of Myers and Lodge, false of Richet ;\nirrelevant in any case as a means of judging the correctness of their\nobservations. Dalton believed in the atomic hypothesis and died\nsteadfast in that belief, but this is not ground for rejecting his\nexperimental work. On p. 313 we learn that evidence coming\nfrom Osty is highly suspect because psychical research was his all-\nabsorbing interest. If all evidence as to paranormal phenomena\nmust be suspect if it comes either from workers who believe in\nparanormal phenomena or who are strongly interested in it, we\nshall be left with little evidence. But a similar criterion would\nleave us with little evidence on any other branch of research.\nOn p. 323 : 'Palladino's investigators were not really investi-\ngating her \"phenomena\" at all. What they were all hoping to do\nwas to prove her \"phenomena\" authentic' How does Mr Raw-\ncliffe know this? 'The Soal experiments were first and foremost\ndesigned to establish scientifically the validity of a purely meta-\nphysical concept' (p. 458). My own recollection of Dr Soal's\nattitude is that, on the contrary, what he was trying to establish\nwas that, under properly controlled conditions, a subject in card\nguessing experiments could not beat the laws of chance. Being an\nopen-minded man, he gave up that idea when the experimental\nevidence went against it, but it is absurd to credit him with the\nopposite pre-conception.\nAlthough Mr Rawcliffe devotes a chapter to discussion of the\nAmerican experiments in ESP, these are mostly devoted to dis-\ncrediting the experimenters. There is no need to protect Duke\nparapsychological investigators against the charge of experimental\nincompetence. Many competent judges have examined their\nwork critically and come to the opposite conclusion. Mr Raw-\n\f626 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\ncliffe makes no attempt at a fair appraisal of the evidence from this\nlaboratory by considering the experiments carried out with the\nfullest precautions against error. There is, for example, no\nmention of the Pearce-Pratt series of experiments which is\nclaimed by Rhine as the most adequate evidence for the reality of\nESP. A sneer at Dr Schmeidler on p. 442, based on a criticism\nby Dr Soal of a minor detail in her evaluation of results, shows\ncomplete ignorance of the point of the criticism.\nDr Soal receives more adequate treatment in the next chapter.\nThe Shackleton results, however, are explained as due to a double\nsystem of unconscious whispering by assistant-experimenter and\nagent. This suggestion is not altogether novel. If it is con-\nsidered to be a possible explanation of the main Shackleton series\nof results, it is obviously not applicable to the preliminary Shackle-\nton series in which there was precognitive guessing on a pack of\ncards, or to the Antwerp-London experiments with Mrs Stewart.\nFor the Antwerp-London series, Mr Rawcliffe has to fall back on\nthe suggestion that the conditions were such that Dr Soal had the\nopportunity of faking the records.\nMr Rawcliffe does not seem altogether happy about these\ncriticisms of Soal's experiments, since he tries to strengthen them\nby some statistical considerations which show a curious lack of\nunderstanding. On p. 471, for example, he says that even if his\nother criticisms were not sound, the Shackleton series would be a\nweak support for Soal's conclusions since their total number is\nonly 6,690 guesses which is a small number compared with the\nAmerican experiments. This, of course, has nothing to do with\nthe case ; the anti-chance odds were 10^^ to i, which is by no\nmeans weak. He is surprised by the 200 guesses with 60 right by\nMrs Stewart ten feet from the telephone (p. 472), but remarks that\n200 trials is too small a number to be of any significance. This is\nnot the case ; the odds against such an excess of right answers\narising by chance in 200 guesses is 2,000 to i which is amply\nsignificant.\nIf all his criticisms against the experiments fall to the ground,\nMr Rawcliffe has a further line of defence in Chapter XXVIII.\nThey could not prove telepathy because this is a metaphysical and\nnot a scientific hypothesis. This is, of course, a mixture of sense\nand nonsense : the sense is less unfamiliar to parapsychologists\nthan Mr Rawcliffe supposes. What one can do by experiment is to\ndiscover whether the knowing of something by one person can be\na sufficient condition for an appropriate action with respect to that\nitem of knowledge by another person in the absence of any com-\nmunication between them through sensory channels. Obviously\nthe success of such an experiment does not tell one that 'tele-\n\f1952] Reviews 627\npathy' (or ESP or psi) is the appropriate name to apply to the\ncapacity revealed by such an experiment, nor anything further\nabout the nature of the capacity than is impHed in the experimental\nsituation. 'Telepathy' (or ESP or psi) is merely the name given\nto the capacity indicated by the experiment, and new^ experiments\nmust be designed to discover anything further we want to know\nabout the capacity. There is nothing metaphysical about that ;\nthe concepts of parapsychology are parallel to such concepts as\n'energy', 'radiation', etc.\nIt is rather surprising to find that a book of this kind has a fore-\nword by Julian Huxley which expresses a hope that it may be\nwidely read and taken to heart. However, Huxley expresses dis-\nagreement with the main thesis of the book, and says that he\ncannot follow the author 'in stigmatizing studies on telepathy,\nclairvoyance, etc., as \"occult research\", unfit to be admitted to\nour universities' (p. 6).\nThe real difference between Mr Rawcliffe and the experimental\npsychical researcher (or parapsychologist) is that between the\nInquisition and Galileo. He knows beforehand what can and what\ncannot happen ; the psychical researcher wants to find out by\nexperiment. We can agree with him that we must find a 'rational'\nexplanation of parapsychological experimental results, but that is\nnot necessarily the explanation that would have seemed to us to be\nthe most rational one before experiment started. If ESP proves\nto take place, then explanation by ESP is not an irrational one.\nThe question must be settled by experiment, and Mr Rawcliffe\ngives us no new experimental facts and no new insight into the old\nones. Our problems are to be solved by experiment and not by\nthe methods of the debating society.\nR. H. Thouless\nThe Psychic Source Book. Edited by Alson J. Smith. Intro-\nduction by Pitirim A. Sorokin. New York, Creative Age\nPress, 1 95 1, xii, 442 pp. S4.00.\nThis book is described by the publishers as 'a big, exhaustive,\nfactual compendium on the ever-alluring subject of extrasensory\nperception and psychic research' ; and even after applying a\nnecessary corrective to a publisher's natural enthusiasm it can be\nsaid the contents cover a wide field and should be a useful primer\nfor newcomers to parapsychology.\nIt consists mainly of twenty articles culled from the writings of\neminent scholars and scientists, about half of whom are from this\ncountry. These articles are mostly of the review type and, though\nnecessarily condensed, give a fair account of their authors' views.\n\f628 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nThus we have F. W. H. Myers on 'The Daimon of Socrates',\nJ. W. Dunne's 'An Experiment with Time', G. W. Balfour on 'The\nEar of Dionysius', Walter Prince on 'Patricia Worth', J. H. Hyslop\non 'Mrs Piper', Mrs H. Sidgwick on Professor Gilbert Murray's\n'Thought-transference experiments', the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas\non 'Book tests', Dr Soal's Myers Memorial Lecture 'The Ex-\nperimental Situation in Psychical Research', Dr Rhine on 'Pre-\ncognition'\u2014all taken wholesale from the original articles and\nmaking a rich and varied collection.\nIntroductions and explanatory notes, mostly quite short, have\nbeen added by the compiler, the Rev. Alson J. Smith, and by\nPitirim Sorokin, Eileen J. Garrett, and J. G. Pratt. These express\na dualist view of mind and body and frankly assume that psychical\nresearch has now established the reality of a Spirit of Man\ntranscending his material environment. To some this will detract\nfrom the book's scientific value as going further than the presented\nfacts warrant. There are no hints of alternative interpretations.\nWith so vast a field to cover there must be many omissions even\nin a compendium of 150,000 words. Thus nothing whatever is\nsaid of physical mediumship, nor, rather surprisingly, considering\nthe country of origin, of psychokinesis. The bare word, if a\nrather scanty index is to be trusted, only occurs twice in the text,\nwith no explanation. PK is not included in a useful glossary,\nthough 'telekinesis' is defined as being 'the alleged supernormal\nmovement of objects'. The use of the cautionary adjective is\ninteresting as it is not used in the parallel definitions of telepathy,\nclairvoyance, precognition, etc., which are defined as established\nfacts. A bibliography is included with over 300 entries among\nwhich are Bunyan's Pilgrinis Progress\u2014and The Koran. There\nis also a Biography of forty-six eminent personalities in psychical\nresearch, and it is pleasant to see E. J.

London,\nRider, 1952. 328 pp. 21s.\nIn this book Mr Dixon-Smith has given us a detailed account of\nhis conversion to Spiritualism after the tragically early death of\nhis wife. It is written with great sincerity and enthusiasm, and\nwith the purpose of bringing the same comfort and assurance to\nothers which he has obtained from his experiences with both trance\nand physical mediums. It is offered not merely as a narrative but\n\f1952] Reviews 629\nas a serious contribution towards evidence of survival, and it is\nfrom this standpoint that it should be judged.\nPart I consists mainly of descriptions of the author's sittings\nwith trance mediums, and in his Explanatory Note (page xvii) he\nclaims that 'the case for survival is at this stage considered to be\nproved'. The reader's first impression is that the author is\nunaware how much more difficult it has become to obtain crucial\nevidence of survival owing to our increased knowledge of ESP.\nMr Dixon- Smith, however, gets over this by postulating that the\nmodus operandi between a discarnate mind and that of the medium\nis a form of hypnosis ; but that the possibility of this process taking\nplace between medium and sitter is excluded by the latter closing\nhis subconscious mind 'as tightly as possible by will and auto-\nsuggestion' so that no medium 'can hook willy-nilly on to one's\nsubconscious memory' (p. 45). The author's attempts to prove\nthis statement are most unconvincing and can hardly be taken\nseriously. There is strong evidence that telepathy between sitter\nand medium does occur. (A typical example can be found in the\nS.P.R. Journal for February 1948 entitled 'Emergence of an\napparently Pseudo-Communicator' by Mrs Heywood.) This\nshould not be considered a more 'extraordinary super-human\npower' (p. 45) than that which the Spiritualist hypothesis entails.\nAn objective study of Mr Dixon-Smith's sittings reveals that a\ngreat deal of the information given to him through mediums was\nalready known to him and was given in private sittings at which he\ntook his own notes (p. 62) and in certain cases had his hand on a\nouija board with that of the medium (p. 113). The author's\nhonesty is not being questioned, but this type of evidence does not\nreach the standard required in psychical research. Proxy evi-\ndence is far more valuable and he gives some interesting cases, but\nhe does not draw sufficient distinction between their evidential\nvalue. Accurate information given to a proxy sitter is more\nimpressive when neither absent nor proxy sitter are known to each\nother, and an involuntary leakage of information or an unconscious\nmemory cannot possibly play a part. It is true, however, that it is\nthe accumulation of evidence of personality which often brings\nconviction to a sitter, and such evidence cannot be entirely dis-\nregarded even though it may not come up to scientific standard.\nMr Dixon-Smith rightly reminds us of the famous cross-\ncorrespondence cases, and others of high evidential standard pub-\nlished by the S.P.R. , where an explanation based solely on ESP is\ninadequate and postulates a degree of that faculty which is at\npresent beyond our knowledge. It is the existence of cases of this\nstandard which makes further and wider research of such im-\nportance, but it is imperative that it should be carried out under\n\f630 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nconditions of the most carefully devised control (however un-\nassailable the good faith of the experimenter may be) and if\npossible in conjunction with modern psychological research.\nThis applies with even greater force to the physical phenomena\ndescribed in Part II. They cover every form of manifestation\nand are so remarkable that it is to be regretted that more details\nare not given regarding the methods of control. This branch of\ninquiry is far more subject to fraud and malobservation than the\nauthor appears to realize, and it is to be hoped that Mr Dixon-\nSmith will give us more detailed and corroborated descriptions of\nhis sittings in the next book which he has promised us.\nThe absence of an index is a great inconvenience.\nK. A. G.\nCORRESPONDENCE t\nQualitative Material and Theories of\nPsi Phenomena\nSir,\u2014Many members of the Society may, like myself, doubt\ntheir ability to co-ordinate the facts of psychical research with\nphysiological science or to bring them within any metaphysical\nscheme. If so, they will share my gratitude to Dr J. R. Smythies\nfor his paper in the Journal for September 1951, and to their\nfellow-members who have commented on it in the issue for\nJanuary 1952. The kind of theory which would be most helpful\nto us would be one that covered as many as possible of the facts of\npsychical research which have been established, without bothering\nabout material that at the present time needs support from the\nresults of further research.\nThe literature of psychical research, in this and other countries,\nis enormous. It would be impracticable for any intending\ntheorist to read every report in every publication with the atten-\ntion necessary to form an opinion whether the occurrences there\ndescribed were properly attested, and whether in each case there\nwere adequate grounds for dismissing sensory clues, chance, and |\nother 'normal' explanations. Should he succeed in completing 1\nsuch a task he would have little leisure for theorising. 1\nFortunately, in assembling material to be brought under his 1\nsurvey, he can profit by the labours of his predecessors in this |\nSociety. His concern will not be with separate, individual,\noccurrences, least of all with instances, whether experimental,\n|\n\f1952] Correspondence 631\nmediumistic, or spontaneous, which present peculiarities that\ncannot readily be parallelled from other reported instances, them-\nselves well attested. Exceptional instances are treacherous\nground, and he will be safer if he keeps to classes or types of\nphenomena that are represented by several examples published in\nS.P.R. Proceedings.\nThe long life of the Society, its freedom from corporate dogma,\nand the enterprise of its members in research are a pretty good\nguarantee that every sort of phenomenon will be investigated by a\nmember and reported to the Society. But no report will appear\nin our Proceedings until it has been screened by the Committee of\nReference, which dates back to the very early days of the Society\nand has numbered many men and women of outstanding ability,\ncritical judgment, and varied opinions.\nIt would be absurd to claim that our investigators or the Com-\nmittee of Reference have made no mistakes. A few hoaxes have\nsucceeded, and examples of carelessness in experiment, observa-\ntion, or record are to be found. But when several examples of\nabout the same type of supposedly paranormal occurrence are to\nbe found reported in our Proceedings, that type has, I suggest, a\nprima facie claim to be included in any theoretical scheme.\nShould the intending theorist share the doubt, which is some-\ntimes expressed, as to the possibility of deciding whether such\nqualitative material as spontaneous cases, mediumistic 'com-\nmunications' and so on can be attributed to chance or not, and\ndoes not trust his own judgment, he can always seek the guidance\nof notable sceptics, such as Mrs Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson,\nwhose critical abilities were exercised over most of the field of\npsychic experience. I do not believe he will anywhere find a more\nobjective criterion for matter worth including in a theoretical\nscheme than publication in Proceedings combined, where qualita-\ntive material is concerned, with acceptance as probably paranormal\nby these experts. This will give him quite as much material to\nwork on as he is likely to need or desire.\nNow, if this yardstick be applied to the papers of Dr Smythies\nand his critics, it will be noted that, while in some respects the\nmaterial discussed by them lies outside the limits suggested above,\nthere is a very large quantity and variety falling within those\nlimits which most of the writers neglect. With few exceptions\nthey confine their remarks to quantitative experiments. Some of\nthese, notably the Soal-Goldney experiments, thoroughly deserve\ntheir attention. Others might conveniently wait until we have a\nlarger quantity of positive results obtained under good conditions.\nIf the results of quantitative experiment were typical of psychic\nphenomena as a whole, there would be no ocassion to press a\n\f632 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\ntheorist to travel outside them. But for reasons too well known to\nreaders of the Journal, arising from their being experimental and\nquantitative, that is far from being the case. If, on the other\nhand, there were no points of contact between the quantitative\nand the qualitative, it might be simplest to get two teams on the\njob in the assurance that their theories would not conflict or over-\nlap. But as things are, attempts to frame a theoretical scheme\nexclusively out of quantitative material may be quite misleading if\nit is assumed to be applicable to other types of phenomena, and\neven misleading as regards the quantitative material itself, as\nobscuring its connexion with and partial resemblance to other\nmaterial left outside the scheme.\nIt is gratifying to note that our American colleagues are alive to\nthe importance of qualitative material. I would refer in particular\nto the short paper by Dr Emanuel Schwartz in the American\nSociety's Journal for January 1952, 'The Psychodynamics of\nSpontaneous Psi Experiences'. Referring to a previous article by\nhim (October 1949) he writes (p. 3) :\nI suggested that over the period of the last seventy-five years the\noriginal emphasis in psychical research [a footnote here mentions\nMyers's Human Personality^ had been shifted from the experiencers to\nthe experiences. It seemed to me that psychical research divorced from\nthe study of human personality was a meaningless undertaking and that\nthe cul-de-sac into which psychical researchers have been led might\nhave been anticipated.\nThe general purpose of the article is to stress the need for the\nstudy of motivation in psychic experiences and of the 'inter-\npersonal field', to use Professor Gardner Murphy's phrase. With\nthis object and with several passages in Dr Schwartz's article I am\nin full sympathy. When, however, he speaks (p. 3) of the need to\nshift the emphasis 'away from the \"phenomena\" and their\nveridicality back to human beings', I think a source of possible\nmisconception is to be noted.\nLet us take two imaginary cases. (A) Jones has a waking vision\nof Smith being involved in a motor smash : Smith has not in fact\nbeen so involved. (B) Jones has a similar vision at the moment\nwhen Smith was in a motor smash a hundred miles away, the\nattendant circumstances being so accurately reproduced in the\nvision as to make an explanation by chance-coincidence highly\nimprobable. (How convincing these imaginary cases are!)\nIt would not, I suggest, be at all safe to assume that the inter-\npersonal relation between Jones and Smith was the same in the\ntwo cases. It might be that the motivation of case A was an\nemotion of Jones regarding Smith that was not reciprocated, and\n\fr\n1952] Correspondence 633\nin case B an emotion that was. Whether that could be shown or\nnot, the difference between the two cases suggests a probable\ndifference in the psychological situation. It seems to me there-\nfore that an analysis of the psychology of spontaneous cases (and\nof mediumistic 'communications' also) will lose much of its value\nunless the laborious first step be taken of sorting out the material\nunder examination into veridical and non-veridical. From his\npraise of the early investigators, who tested each case very\nthoroughly to see how far it could be counted as veridical, I should\ninfer that Dr Schwartz himself is under no misconception as to\nthe need for this, but some of his remarks might perhaps mislead\nincautious readers of his article.\nW. H. Salter\nThe Shackleton Experiments: Mr Rawcliffe's\nTheory of Double Whispering\nSir,\u2014In The Psychology of the Occult, Mr D. H. Rawcliffe puts\nforward a theory of double whispering to account for the results\nof the experiments with Basil Shackleton. Students of psychical\nresearch will realize that the theory is so preposterous as to be\nscarcely worth refuting, but for the sake of uninformed persons\nwho may read the book it may be advisable to make a few\ncomments.\nThe author supposes that the experimenter, in addition to\npresenting the random numbers at the aperture in the screen and\ncalling in a loud voice the serial numbers 1-25, involuntarily\nwhispers the next number on his list or tags on its initial consonant\nto the serial number. The Agent sitting on the other side of the\nscreen picks up this whisper, decodes it into the corresponding\nanimal's name, and whispers the name or its initial letter, and the\nwhisper is picked up by Shackleton sitting 18-20 feet away in the\nnext room. All this complicated series of exchanges is supposed\nto be packed into the 2\\ seconds between successive calls. When,\nhowever, the experiment is speeded up to twice the normal rate,\nthe experimenter is supposed instead to whisper the next number\nbut one on his list, and this is said to account for the ( + 2) displace-\nment. This double whispering and decoding has now to be com-\npressed into an interval of i| seconds or less!\nShackleton succeeded brilliantly with no less than seven\ndifferent experimenters. All these, according to Mr Rawcliffe,\nmust have been whispering the number one or two places removed\nfrom the one they were actually showing at the aperture, and all\nof them must have been completely unaware of it\n!\n\f634 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may\nIn any case, in putting forward this theory Mr RawcHffe omits\nto say that true involuntary articulation occurs as a reinforcement\neffect and not as a deliberate separate process. He is therefore in\neffect saying that the experimenter (i) looks up at the appropriate\nrandom number on the list, (2) deliberately shifts his glance to the\nnext number or the next but one, (3) looks down to pick up the\ncard bearing the appropriate number, (4) presents it at the\naperture, (5) calls out the next serial number, and (6) deliberately\nwhispers the next random number or the next but one. All this,\nplus the picking up and decoding of the whisper by the Agent,\nand the latter's own whispering, would indeed constitute a pheno-\nmenon of the first order, even if not compressed into a maximum\nof z\\ seconds! Of the implication of fraud, I will only say that\nten different people\u2014seven experimenters and three Agents\n\u2014\nwould have had to be party to it!\nThere are other phenomena\u2014e.g. the success of one Agent and\nthe total failure of the other when two agents were employed\nsimultaneously, either with the same or with different targets\n\u2014\nwhich Mr Rawcliffe's theory is incapable of accounting for, but\nto deal with these would be a waste of your space and of the reader's\ntime.\nI shall scarcely be expected to comment here on Mr Rawcliffe's\nremarks on the conduct of the Antwerp-London experiments\nwith Mrs Stewart.\nS. G. SOAL\nESP AS Guesswork\nSir,\u2014In two recent broadcast talks on 'The Significance of\nParapsychology', and in the conflated version of these which I gave\nto the Society in February, I suggested that if we thought of ESP\nnot as a species of either cognition or perception but as a kind of\nguesswork, we might be led to investigate ordinary guesswork ;\nand that what we found out might throw into relief significant\npeculiarities of paranormal guesswork. I have been asked to\nexpand and explain this suggestion. I am glad to be driven to try\nto do this : for what I originally had in mind was an extremely\nhazy and tentative idea ; and it is good to be forced to find what\n\u2014\nif anything\u2014can be made of it.\nObviously the first difficulty lies in the notion of ordinary guess-\nwork. For\u2014at least in the present state of our ignorance\u2014there\nis no way to distinguish decisively in any single case between a\nguess (or hunch or dream or vision) which just happens to be right\nand a correct guess (or hunch or dream or vision) in which the\n\f1952] Correspondence 635\nESP factor is operating. This is because all we can at present\nmean by the term 'ESP factor' is the factor which gives rise to\nsignificant deviations from pure chance expectation in a series of\nguesses (or whatnot). If we use the term to mean more than this,\nthen the evidence at present available has not established the\npresence of an ESP factor : if '\nE S P ' is taken to refer to the\nputative unknown means or mechanism by which successful ESP\nruns are achieved, then there are no sufficient grounds for thinking\ngenuine ESP occurs ; for though conjuror's means and mechan-\nism can produce bogus ESP effects, we have no reason to suppose\ngenuine E SP runs are produced by any means or mechanism ; and\nevery reason to suppose the contrary. (What means or mechanism\ncould operate backwards to produce genuine precognitive ESP?)\nThe difficulty could be got round, at least temporarily, by pre-\nscribing that guesswork (and whatnot) was ordinary when and\nonly when it was done by someone who has always failed to score\nsignificantly in E S P tests. This is no doubt excessively rigorous ;\nbut it's as well to be on the safe side, by thus excluding the dud\nruns of the sometimes successful.\nNow what I mean by studying ordinary guesswork (and what-\nnot) is finding out why people guess one thing and not another\n(dream one thing and not another, have one particular hunch or\nvision and not another) when no ESP factor is involved. If we\nknew more about this it might be easier to see more of the nature\nof this mysterious ESP factor, which appears occasionally to up-\nset the ordinary mechanisms and motivations of the normal.\nWhat leaps to mind here are Freud's masterpieces : The Psycho-\npathology of Everyday Life and The Interpretation of Dreams. But\na great deal of other work has been done ; and much more needs\nto be done.\nNow I have developed the idea, I am no more sure than I was\nwhen I first made the suggestion that there really is anything in it\nBut perhaps, even if this is just one more dead end, it will have\nbeen worthwhile to have reminded psychical researchers\n\u2014\nespecially those working on putative spontaneous phenomena\n\u2014\nthat Freud did show that very many apparently paranormal\npredictive omens and dreams could be sufficiently explained in\nterms of the motives of the dreamer.\nAntony Flew\n\f636 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [may w\n'The Clairvoyant Theory of Perception' I|\nSir,\u2014I should like to make two comments on Captain \\\\\nMoncrieff's letter in the March issue of this Journal.\n(1) I did not say, as Captain Moncrieff suggests, that his theory\ncannot account for disordered vision in cases of cataract. In fact,\nI expressly said that it could account for this but not for disordered\nvision in cases of disease of the optical apparatus proximal to the\nretina, i.e. in the optic tracts, optic radiations, and occipital and ,\nparietal cortex. Captain Moncrieff explains the various phen-\nomena and syndromes which I mentioned thus :\n'\n... if clair-\nvoyance is a mental faculty, such abnormal cerebral conditions as\nabove would naturally be expected to produce them. . . . Thus,\nin case of \" vascular lesions of the parietal lobe \" we would hold\nthat their effect on vision may possibly be due to the lack of\nintegration or correlation in respect to the cerebral processes.'\nNow the disorders of vision caused by such vascular lesions are\nfairly extensive, and the visual field is grossly disorganized. Thus\nthe integrative and correlating processes, which are held to fail in '\nthese cases, must be very greatly responsible for the orderly 1\npresentation of the normal visual field. Furthermore, experimental '\npsychology has shown that the actual size of objects in the visual I\nfield and the spatial relations between these objects is quite different I\nfrom the size and relationship of the objects of the common\nphysical world. This is particularly so in the case of distant 1\nobjects. If the actual nature of the visual field is borne in mind,\ntogether with the evidence as to its means of presentation that we\ncan actually inspect\u2014after-images and the stroboscopic phen-\nomena\u2014it seems that these integrative and correlating processes\nin themselves provide an adequate explanation of the missing link\nin perception. The visual and auditory fields and the somatic\nsensory field making up the perceived body must actually be con-\nstructed by mechanism\u2014that is by process in extension. Whether\nthis mechanism is in the brain or in the psyche is not immediately\nrelevant. The problem of externality of sensa, which Captain\nMoncrieff's theory attempts to solve, is an entirely false problem\ndue primarily to the confusion in common sense between the\nperceived body and the physical body and to the confusion in\nneurology between the perceived body and the body-image. All\nsensa, including the visual fields and the perceived body, are\nwholly inside the human organism\u2014geographically, anatomically, ,\nand physiologically inside it.\n(2) I would not agree that '\nno theory can be expected to\nprovide a full and adequate explanation both in respect of normal I\nand abnormal conditions of vision '. There is no clear-cut\n\fCorrespondence 637\ndivision in nature between the normal and the abnormal, and any\ntheory which cannot account for both is inadequate.\nIn conclusion, I would like to suggest for further reading Paul\nSchilder's book The Itnage and Appearance of the Human\nBody (London, Kegan Paul, 1935). Further advances in philo-\nsophy depend largely upon the integration into the existing\nphilosophical structure of the large body of evidence contained in\nthe special humanistic sciences of neurology, neurophysiology,\nexperimental psycholog}% and neuro-anatomy.\nJ.

LTD.\nTHE UNIVERSITY PRESS, GLASGOW\n\fJOURNAL\nof the\nSociety for Psychical Research\nVolume XXXVI No. 671 July-October 1952\n(Double Number)\nTHREE SCORE YEARS AND TEN\nThe S.P.R., 1882-1952\nSeventy years would be a fairly long period for the life of any\nresearch society that was dependent entirely on the financial\nsupport and energy of its members and had no backing from\nprofessional or academic interests. For such a society to be en-\ngaged for all that time on an investigation as full of difficulties and\npitfalls as psychical research, to have survived two wars and three\ndecades of almost uninterrupted financial crisis, and at the end\nto have emerged with a roll of full members much larger than at\nany time before the Second World War, is a truly remarkable feat.\nIt proves that in 1882 its foundations were well and truly laid, and\nsuggests that this is an appropriate moment to recall to memory\nthe men and women who laid them, the objects they had in view,\nand the principles by which they wished themselves and their\nsuccessors to be guided.\n'Psychical research' was a new term intended by our founders\nto mean systematic inquiry into several debatable questions having\nlittle in common except that they did not seem capable of a solution\nwithin the generally accepted scheme of natural science. There\nwere, for example, stories of apparitions and haunted houses, too\nnumerous and apparently too well authenticated to be lightly\ndismissed as old wives' tales : how much fact underlay the accumu-\nlations of hearsay and credulity? What light would a scientific\ninvestigation of hypnotism throw on the structure of the mind,\nand on those extensions of perceptive faculty reported by earlier\ninquirers? Could recent experiments in thought-transference\nbe confirmed, and, if so, could the modus operandi be defined?\nWas it true that spirits could 'materialize' themselves in visible\nand tangible form? Were there forces, unrecognized by Science,\ncapable of moving material objects?\n639\n\f640 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nThe solution of these and many similar questions clearly ]\ndepended on the conduct of a more sustained and better co-ordi-\nj\nnated inquiry than any that had hitherto been, or could be, pursued '\nby individuals or small groups of friends. A conference of\ninterested persons was accordingly convened in London in\nJanuary 1882 by Professor William Barrett, the Dublin physicist,\nat which a project was submitted for a society to conduct systematic\ninvestigations. This resulted in the formation a month later of the\npresent Society.\nHenry Sidgwick, who in the following year became Professor of\nMoral Philosophy at Cambridge, was elected as first President,\nand it was fortunate that the nascent Society should have been\nguided by a man of his character and intellectual gifts, his rare\nunion of cautious judgment with tireless determination, and his\nexperience of many forms of supposedly psychic phenomena\ngained in active association with Frederic Myers and Edmund\nGurney. Both were men of exceptional ability. They had made\nmany experiments and observations, the results of which their\nwide reading and personal contacts with American and Continental 1\npsychologists enabled them to correlate with the significant\ndevelopments of the time, especially in medical psychology. Of\nthe two, Gurney had the greater aptitude for experiment, and\ncould give more time to it ;\nMyers had no rival as an exponent of\nfacts and ideas, which are now through the Society's work familiar .\nto all, but were then startlingly novel.\nThe new Society attracted men and women of eminence in\nmany branches of science, in philosophy, scholarship, literature,\nj\nand politics : to name a few, William Crookes, Lord Rayleigh,\nOliver Lodge, A. R. Wallace, William Bateson, W. E. Gladstone,\nA. J. Balfour, John Ruskin, Alfred Tennyson, R. L. Stevenson,\n'Lewis Carroll', Leslie Stephen.\nOpinions of the most diverse kind flourished among the mem-\nbers on such questions as the reality of various kinds and instances\nof supposedly psychic occurrences, and especially as to their\nbearing on the problem of human survival. Some were already\nconvinced Spiritualists, others hard-shell sceptics. All, however,\nagreed to accept the principle laid down in the manifesto printed\nin Volume I of the Society's Proceedings, to approach the prob-\nlems of psychical research 'without prejudice or prepossession of\nany kind, and in the same spirit of exact and unempassioned\nenquiry which has enabled science to solve so many problems,\nonce not less obscure nor less hotly debated'. ^ This has been ever\nsince, and still is, the foundation of the Society's policy.\nAttempts have indeed been made to turn the Society into a\n' Proc, i, 4. j\n\f1952] Three Score Years and Ten 641\ndoctrinaire body, but these have always been frustrated by the\nresistance of an overwhelming majority of the members. Seces-\nsions there have been from both wings. A few years after the\nSociety's foundation a handful of Spiritualists resigned in dis-\napproval of the critical attitude of some prominent members\ntowards physical phenomena. A dozen years later a few sceptics\nleft because they thought they detected a Spiritualist bias in the\nCouncil. But there have been no splits or secessions of importance.\nAnyone with a fairly long practical experience of S.P.R. work\nwould probably agree that differences of opinion are no obstacle to\nharmonious co-operation among researchers of ordinary intelli-\ngence who make objectivity their aim.\nThe inaugural manifesto, while attempting no precise definition\nof psychical research, gave a list of subjects which it was proposed\nto investigate. This is of historical interest owing to the curious\nphrasing of some of the items and the way in which they were\ngrouped. The list was comprehensive and may be briefly de-\nscribed as a programme for the investigation of all those aspects\nof human personality, and the faculties, states, and phenomena\nconnected therewith, that were not recognized by general scientific\nopinion and were not at the time being fully investigated by any\nother science. That puts the matter negatively. A positive\ndefinition might be harder to formulate, but the full exploration\nof the subconscious mind (not to be confused with the Freudian\n'unconscious') might not be far off the mark.\nIn practice the new Society was in its earlier years mainly\nengaged in pursuing those lines of inquiry which several of the\nmembers had been following before its foundation, introducing\norder and method where necessary. Some of the lines of inquiry\nled nowhere. Others were successfully followed up to a point at\nwhich it became profitable to leave further progress to some other\norganization. Thus, much of the pioneer work in this country\nrelating to hypnotism and medical psychology in general was done\nby members of the Society, at first separately, but later grouped\ninto a Medical Section. When, however, after the First World\nWar the British Psychological Society formed a Medical Section\nof its own, there was no point in continuing the Medical Section\nof the S.P.R.\nBut there is no other organization to which as yet the main de-\npartments of psychical research could be transferred with the\nassurance that they would receive the thorough investigation that\nthey need. Two main departments have long been recognized.\nOne is concerned with the so-called 'physical' phenomena, such\nas the movement of objects without muscular or mechanical force\n('telekinesis'). The other relates to 'mental' phenomena : for\n\f642 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nexample, the transmission of impressions otherwise than through\nthe normal channels of sense ('telepathy'). (Needless to say,\nneither of the above descriptions should be regarded as an assertion\nthat the subject-matter of the description has been proved to exist).\nAs a rough-and-ready classification, which is easily understood,\nthe division into 'physical' and 'mental' may be conveniently\nretained, even though it suggests a sharp distinction which is no\nlonger fashionable.\nAs regards physical phenomena, although much good investiga-\ntion had already been done by Henry Sidgwick and his wife,\nMyers and Gurney, the general level of investigation was low.\nIt was urgently necessary to raise it by showing inexpert sitters\nhow easily they could be deceived through their inability to\nobserve accurately what happened in the seance-room under the\nconditions usually prevalent. This was effectively done by Richard\nHodgson who arranged for a friend, Davey, to dupHcate by\n'normal' means, i.e. conjuring, some physical phenomena that\nwere then astounding the public before groups of sitters who were\nasked to write down what they thought they had seen. They were\nthen told what in fact they had seen and how and why they were in\nerror.^ When, however, conditions were formulated that would\neffectively exclude deception, great difficulty was experienced in\nfinding mediums willing to accept them. In consequence the field\nof investigation into physical phenomena has proved disappoint-\ningly barren, and there are few records of positive results obtained\nby competent researchers under good conditions. The best\nexample is perhaps the report by the Hon. Everard Feilding,\nW. W. Baggally, and Hereward Carrington, a very strong team,\nof their sittings in Naples with Eusapia Palladino.^\nResearch into the 'mental' phenomena was actively pursued\nalong two lines. There were first the collection and analysis of\nspontaneous occurrences of the kind that are the basis of the\ntraditional ghost story. Two large-scale inquiries were initiated\nby the Society, the first conducted by Gurney, Myers, and Frank\nPodmore, and resulting in the publication in 1886 of Phantasms\nof the Living. The second was the 'Census of Hallucinations',\nthe report on which was published in 1894.^ It was mainly the\nwork of Mrs Henry Sidgwick and Miss Alice Johnson, later Re-\nsearch Officer of the Society, both of whom were familiar with\nscientific method. From Phantasms and the Census it was apparent\nthat narratives of persons being 'seen' by their friends, at a time\nwhen they were involved in some sudden and unexpected crisis\noccurring at a distance, a fatal accident, for example, were too\n' Proc, iv, 381-495, and viii, 259-310.\n- Proc, xxiii, 306-569. ^ Proc, x, 25-422.\n\f1952] Three Score Years and Ten 643\nwell authenticated and too numerous to be explicable by mistakes\nof memory or by chance. A strong case was made out for these\nso-called 'crisis-apparitions' being due to the 'externalization' by\nthe percipient as a vision of telepathic impressions received by\nhim subconsciously.\nIt is difficult, many would say impossible, to prove through the\nanalysis, however skilful, of spontaneous incidents that mental\nimpressions can be transmitted from one person to another other-\nwise than by the recognized channels of sensory perception. The\nelimination of chance as a conceivable explanation cannot be made\nabsolutely certain. These cases can, however, throw much light\non the working of telepathy, if confirmed by the results of experi-\nment.\nThis was the second line of investigation. It was pursued, not\nperhaps as systematically as it might have been, in the early days\nof the Society, and is now the main preoccupation of psychical\nresearchers both in this country and in the United States. Several\ndifferent types of experiment have been tried. Sometimes the\nsubject-matter has been of a more or less complex kind, such as\nincidents of real life, scenes from fiction, or pictures. In other\ninstances the 'targets' have been cards with a limited number of\ndesigns on them to choose from. The former type, of which Dr\nGilbert Murray's experiments^ are a well-known example, is, like\nthe crisis-apparitions and for similar reasons, not conclusive to all\nminds, although highly informative as to process. It is on the\nsecond type that interest is now mainly concentrated, since con-\ntrolled quantitative experiment not only enables the investigator\nto determine precisely the extent to which a particular result may\nbe expected to occur by chance, but by the refinements of modern\nstatistical technique to distinguish between difi\"erent modes of\n'paranormal cognition', or 'extrasensory perception' (ESP), as it\nis now more generally called.\nExperiments carried out in recent years by a large number of\ninvestigators, among whom Professor J. B. Rhine of Duke Univer-\nsity, the late Whately Carington,^ and Dr Soal deserve special\nmention, show that telepathy is not the only paranormal 'mental'\nphenomenon requiring study. There is evidence that some sub-\njects have a grasp of future events exceeding the powers of rational\ninference ('precognition'),^ and cases are on record of the direct\napprehension of facts about physical objects (e.g. the order of\ncards in a shuffled pack) not normally known either to the per-\ncipient or anyone else ('clairvoyance').^ There may be other\nparanormal faculties to be explored in the same way.\n1 Proc, xxix, 46-110 and xxxiv, 212-74 ^ Proc, xlvi and xlvii.\n^ Proc, xlvii, 21-150. ^ Proc, xlviii, 1-28.\n\f644 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JUly\nThe question whether human personality survives the death of\nthe body is one that falls within the scope of the Society's objects,\nalthough it is not specifically mentioned in the founders' manifesto.\nNo reasonable person can be indifferent to this problem, and to\nmany psychical researchers, including Myers, it has seemed the\nfundamental problem, to which all others are subsidiary. But\nMyers, as his great work Human Personality and its Survival of\nBodily Death shows, was well aware that the problem must be\napproached through careful inquiry into the personality of man\nas we are familiar with it in the flesh, its powers and possibilities.\nNo one, whatever the importance he attaches to the survival issue,\nought to regard as mis-spent the time, labour, and skill now being\ndevoted to a thorough exploration of E S P\n.\nThe direction taken by psychical inquiry at any given time has\nalways been determined by the human material available for study.\nThe psychical researcher should be prepared to deal with what-\never kind of phenomenon he can bring within his net, whether\nmental or physical, experimental or spontaneous. He cannot plan\nthe order in which problems will present themselves for solution.\nA few years after its foundation the Society had the good\nfortune to contact Mrs Leonora Piper, the most remarkable of all\n'mental' mediums. She was under close observation for about a\nquarter of a century, and when her powers were beginning to\ndecline, another 'mental' medium, Mrs Osborne Leonard, whose\npowers were little inferior, became available for study. Through\nthese two mediums, both of whom were most co-operative and of\nunimpeachable integrity, 'communications' were received which\nimpressed as paranormal all the trained investigators with ex-\ntensive experience of them, and were regarded by many as proof\nof the survival of the individuals from whom they ostensibly\ncame. The diff\"erence of opinion rested on doubts as to the scope\nof telepathy between medium and sitter, and possibly between the\nmedium and some third party unknown to her.^\nIn 1 901, a few weeks after Myers's death, began the scripts of\n'the S.P.R. group of automatists', which lasted for over thirty years.\nAbout a dozen automatists, many of them members of the S.P.R.,\nproduced scripts which taken separately often seemed to have\nlittle meaning, but when put together were found to convey a\ncoherent message, ostensibly coming from a group which included\nMyers, Sidgwick, and Gurney. The significant point about these\n'cross-correspondences', as they were called, was that they em-\nbodied an elaborate pattern divided among the scripts of the\ndiff^erent automatists, certainly not attributable to the conscious\nmind, nor apparently to the subconscious mind of any one of\n^W.n.SaXtcT, Trance Mediumship. (S.P.R., 1950).\n\f195*] Three Score Years and Ten 645\nthem.^ Something more than telepathy between the living seemed,\ntherefore, to be involved. For this reason, and on account of\nother features deserving study in detail, the scripts are generally\nregarded as among the most important pieces of evidence for\nsurvival. But once again the question arises, Do we know enough\nabout the paranormal powers of incarnate minds to say with\nconfidence that such or such occurrences can or cannot be assigned\nto them?\nThe Society was formed to undertake investigation on a wide\nfront, neglecting nothing that could promote knowledge of human\npersonality. It has until now held fast to this purpose, and should\ncontinue to do so. No line of research in which progress has been\nmade should be abandoned. But there is one form of research\nwhich did not in the past attract as much attention as it might have\ndone : controlled experiment into ESP. This is a line which\nnow needs, and is likely for some time to need, vigorous prosecu-\ntion. The planning and conduct of experiments of this kind and\nthe analysis of the results are an extremely technical business\ncalling for highly trained researchers supported by assistants\nhandling the heavy incidental routine work, as is customary in an\nordinary psychological laboratory. This task would not in any\nway prevent the Society from continuing its traditional, qualitative\nresearches, as and when opportunity offered, but would rather\nadvance them by enabling some elements of the problems to which\nthey are directed to be more precisely defined.\nW. H. S.\nTHE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN DREAMS\nBy G. F. Dalton\nSummary\nBrief accounts are given of a number of dreams in which\nproblems are solved, or (as a special case) lost articles found. A\ngeneral description of such dreams is given. All of them are\nwish-fulfillment or anxiety dreams, and the dream-figures which\nappear in some do so as a part of the wish or the anxiety. The\nwish-fulfilment principle is further used to account for the fact\nthat the lost-article dream usually shows the article as at the time\n* H. F. Saltmarsh, Evidence of Personal Survival from Cross-corres-\npondences. (Bell, 1938).\n\f646 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY it\nof finding, not of losing. In some cases there is a precognitive A\nelement, although the essential information is obtained through\nretrocognition ; to explain these the hypothesis of a double dream\nis put forward. In some cases where the dreamer is not the loser ^\nof the article (Squires, Chaffin) there must be a telepathic com- [|\nmunication ; the difficulty of locating this at any moment of i\nj,\nordinary time is considered, and it is concluded that communica-\ntion takes place between four-dimensional entities. It is shown i\nthat clairvoyance is not a necessary hypothesis, retrocognition, ''\ntelepathy, and precognition being sufficient to explain all the facts.\nIn cases not concerned with lost articles (Lamberton, Hilprecht) II\nJ\nthe prima facie conclusion is that much intellectual work must |\nj\nhave taken place in sleep. The incongruity of this with the 1\n]\ngeneral habits of the dreaming mind is pointed out, and it is\nsuggested that here too there may be a precognitive element. In\nconclusion, the 'solution' dream is compared with other psycholo- <\n^\ngical events, including religious conversion.\nFrom the earliest times a type of dream has been known in 1\n[\nwhich a problem is solved, or (a special case of very frequent j\noccurrence) a lost article found. Professor Dodds^ gives examples 1\nfrom Greek temple records. Synesius, in his treatise on dreams I\n(a.d. 404 or 405), considers the question in the light of his own I\nj\nexperience. '. . . Of many of the things which present difficulties '\nto us when awake, some of these it [the dream] makes completely f\nclear while we are asleep, and others it helps us to explain. ... [\nIt has frequently helped me to write books, for it has prepared the\nj\nmind and made the diction appropriate to the thought. . . . More- ,\nover when I am engaged in the chase, it has suggested to me ; ,\nstratagems of the hunter's art. . .\n.'^\nAlthough he gives no details, it is probable that these revelations\ndid not take a dramatic form ; the Muses did not give him advice\nabout his style, nor Artemis about hunting, or he would surely\nhave mentioned the fact.\nThe first reasonably detailed and trustworthy account comes\nfrom St Augustine. As with most of the following cases, I give a\ncondensation.\nI. Eulogiiis.^ A rhetorician named Eulogius, an ex-pupil of\nAugustine's, found himself in difficulties with a passage of Cicero which\nhe had to expound to his class the next day. He was greatly troubled\nover this, and could scarcely sleep. In the night he dreamed that\n^ 'Telepathy and Clairvoyance in Classical Antiquity.' Journal of j\nParapsychology, December 1946.\n^ Treatise on Dreams, sect. 9 ; trans. A. Fitzgerald, 1930.\n'\n^ De cura pro ynortuis gerenda, sect. 11. . : f't .* .\n\fThe Solution of Problems in Dreams 647\nAugustine appeared to him and explained the passage. Augustine\nheard this story from Eulogius on his return to Africa.\nAugustine quotes this for comparison with the celebrated Milan\ncase, to show that dream-figures may be subjective. The latter,\nthough third-hand and anonymous, can scarcely be left out of\nconsideration.\n2. Milan} A young man in Milan was proceeded against for a debt\nincurred by his father, who had recently died. The creditor produced\nthe father's promise to pay. The son was sure that the debt had been\npaid, otherwise the father would have made some mention of it in his\nwill ;\nhowever, he had no evidence, and was much distressed. In a\ndream the father appeared to him and told him where the receipt was.\nThe son found it, and was able to prove that the debt had been paid.\nA third dream, of a decidedly different type, is given in\nAugustine's Confessions.'^\n3. St Monica. '. . . For whence else was that dream of hers, by\nwhich thou comfortedst her ; after which she allowed me to live with\nher, and to eat at the same table in house with her, which she had\nalready begun to be unwilling to do, refusing and detesting the\nblasphemies of my error. [Augustine was at this time a Manichaean.]\nFor she saw, in her sleep, herself standing upon a wooden rule \\in\nquadam regula lignea], and a very beautiful young man coming towards\nher, with a cheerful countenance and smiling upon her, herself being\ngrieved and far gone with sorrowfulness. Which young man when he\nhad demanded of her the causes of her sadness and daily weepings . . .\nand she had answered that it was my perdition that she bewailed ; he\nbade her rest contented, and behold, that where she herself was, there\nwas I also. Who when she looked aside, she saw me standing by her\nupon the same rule.'\nNine years later, Augustine was converted to Christianity.\nThis is practically a first-hand case, for St Monica told the\ndream at once to Augustine. Its genuineness is, I think, proved\nby the play on the word 'rule', which is as intelligible in Latin as\nin English. Neither Monica nor Augustine would in their waking\nlives have put a pun into the mouth of a divine messenger ; on the\nother hand, the tendency of the dreaming mind to puns is well\nknown.\nI have not come across any well-attested cases occurring during\nthe next thirteen hundred years. It is possible that they were not\nconsidered remarkable enough to be worth writing down. Mme\nde Marteville's experience has survived through the accident of a\nSwedenborgian legend having formed round it.\n^ De cura pro mortuis, sect. 11.\n2 Book III, trans. W. Watts.\n\f648 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jULY\n4. Mme de Marteville. This lady, whose husband had recently died,\nwas called upon to pay a debt said to have been contracted by him.\nKnowing him to be methodical in money matters, she was sure that he\nhad paid the debt, and kept the receipt ; the latter, however, could not\nbe found. She was very worried, and applied to Swedenborg, who she\nthought might be able to get in touch with her husband. 'Eight days\nafter she had made her request to Swedenborg, Mme de Marteville\nsaw her late husband in a dream, and from him learned the place where\nshe would find the desired receipt. She woke up at 2 a.m., satisfied\nherself at once of the truth of the dream, and went to sleep again.\nTowards eleven o'clock Swedenborg called, knowing nothing of what\nhad happened. He also, as he said, had seen M. de Marteville last\nnight. He wished to talk with him, but the latter would not enter into\nthe subject, because he had to go to his wife in order to let her make\nan important discovery.' (According to the legend, of course, the\ndiscovery was made by Swedenborg.) :\nThe latter part of the foregoing story is from a letter written in\n1775 by a Danish 'General von E.', the second husband of Mme\nde Marteville. Professor R. Hennig, who quotes it,^ concludes\nthat the story is now cleared up 'in a quite harmless and natural\nway', apart from the last sentence, which may be considered as 'a\nscarcely believable embroidery'. But even taking Mme de\nMarteville's dream by itself, it is surely unduly disparaging to say,\nas Hennig does, that it is no more wonderful than dozens of\nsimilar stories. He gives a case, from 'the quite uncritical Perty',\nwhich concerns a clergyman's widow, a secret drawer, and a red\nvelvet bag. This same case is quoted by du Prel and Biichner, the\noriginal source, it seems, being J. C. Hennings's Traiime iind Nacht-\nwandler, published in 1784. If there are 'dozens' to choose from,\nwhy is this anonymous and doubtful tale bandied about from\nauthor to author?\nI pass over the affair of Mr R\u2014d, narrated by Scott in a note\nto The Antiquary. It is third-hand and anonymous, it has\nobviouslj' been 'written up', and it has been given already by\nhalf-a-dozen authors. Its chief point of interest is that at the time\nof the search Mr R\u2014d had given up the search for the misssing\ndocument. This, as will be seen, is a very frequent feature of\nthese cases ; it occurs also in the following :\n5. Lady Miller.^ Sir John Miller died. His wife had always under-\nstood that he was to leave her the house and a large jointure ; but no\nwill could be found. The heir-at-law allowed Lady Miller to stay for\nsix months in the house in order to search for the missing will. At last\n^ 'Das Urteil iiber Swedenborg im Lichte der heutigen Wissenschaft.'\nZeitschrift fiir kritischen Okkultismus, 1927.\n^ Miss F. P. Cobbe, 'Unconscious Cerebration', in Darwinism in\nMorals and Other Essays, 1872.\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 649\nshe came I0 the conclusion that her memory must have deceived her.\nOn the last night of the six months Sir John Miller appeared to her,\nstanding beside the bed, and said solemnly : 'There is a will!' Extra\ntime was allowed for a further search, and in the end the will was found.\nThere appears to be no reason to doubt the authenticity of this ;\nbut it might be objected that it is a waking hallucination rather\nthan a dream. However, an apparition to a person in bed, who\nhas just awakened or is just about to go to sleep, is so close to the\nregion of dream that it would be pedantic to exclude it.\n6. Cashier} In an Edinburgh bank a customer one day insisted on\nbeing served before his turn. He was a stammerer and noisy, and\ncaused so much annoyance that the cashier agreed to serve him first in\norder to get rid of him. Eight or nine months later, the books of the\nbank could not be made to balance ; there was a deficiency of \u00a36.\nSeveral days and nights were spent trying to trace the error, but without\nsuccess. One night in a dream the whole affair of the stammerer was\nre-enacted, and on waking the cashier (who had completely forgotten\nthe incident) found that the amount paid to the stammerer, had\nnot been entered in the book of interests.\nThis account is anonymous, but was given to Abercrombie at\nfirst hand. Although it contains two unusual features, there is no\nspecial reason to doubt its genuineness.\nAmong over 700 cases set out in Phantasms of the Living, only\none. No. 66, can be included in the class under discussion. It is\nanother borderland hallucination.\n7. F.R.C.P.^ A doctor was attending a delirious woman. Her\nsymptoms puzzled him ; he suspected alcoholism, but could not con-\nfirm this. He wished he could get into the house late at night. One\nnight in bed he had a vision of the proprietor of the patient's house\nstanding under a lamp post in the street, talking to another man. He\nrose at once, went to the spot he had seen in his vision, and found the\ntwo men there. He accompanied the landlord back to the house, went\nin, and found the maid giving drink to the patient.\nThis case was twenty years old at the time of recording, and no\nconfirmation could be obtained. It is no doubt genuine, since it\nsatisfied Gurney, Myers, and Podmore ; but one would have liked\na great deal more detail.\nWith Myers's papers in Proceedings we are on firm ground.\nThe cases are first-hand and detailed. Eighteen cases are given\nin Volume viii, and four more in Volume xi. Most of these\nare straightforward stories of articles lost by the dreamer, and\n^ Ahercromhie, On the Intellectual Powers, 1821.\n^ Phantasms of the Living, i, 267.\n\f650 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nrecovered by a direct vision of the article without the help of any\ndream-figure ; but the following present special points of interest :\n8. Mrs Stuart} A friend lost a stone from a ring. 'I would not\nhave done this for the world ; it belonged to my father,' he said. All\nsearched, but without success. Mrs Stuart that night dreamed of the\nstone lying on the lawn under a fallen leaf, with dewdrops sparkling in\nthe sun. She woke, went out at once\u2014it was 6 a.m.\u2014and found the\nstone just as in the dream.\n9. A.v.S? A little girl, eight or nine years old, lost a knife. 'The\nloss nearly broke her heart.' Next night she dreamed that her dead\nbrother appeared and showed her the place where the knife was. It\nwas found there next day.\n10. Wilniot.^ Mr Wilmot, a gardener, lost his wages (fifteen\nshillings) on his way home. He made every enquiry, but without\nsuccess. During the next night he dreamed that he went to a house he\nhad visited the day before, and, crossing the road after he had left it,\nwalked into a mud heap ; that his foot struck the paper containing the\nmoney, the half-sovereign rolled away and the five shillings remained\nunder his foot. The dream was repeated. Next day he went to the\nplace indicated, and the dream fulfilled itself exactly.\n11. Peterson.^ Some crucial evidence was missing in a case in which\nMr Peterson was engaged as a barrister. He dreamed that he was\naddressing the court, and declared that he had found in an account-\nbook an entry which cleared up the mystery. The opposing counsel\nthen denounced him as a liar, Peterson in reply threw an inkstand at\nhis head, and in short the dream proceeded in a dream-like manner.\nOn waking he at once went to his client and found the entry as in the\ndream.\n12. Yates.^ Mrs Yates lost some photographs. A year later she\ndreamed of taking out a certain drawer and finding them ; but on\nwaking she did not look there.\" Some months later the drawer was\ntaken out for another reason, and the photographs were found.\n13. Squires.'' The dreamer's friend, Davis, lost his watch. Both\nmen were at the time employed on an American cattle-farm. Squires\nwas sympathetic ; 'could not keep his mind off the watch, and, after\ntwo or three days' thinking of it, went to bed one night still thinking\nof it.' In his dream he saw the watch. The dream vision is described\nin detail ; the watch was lying in long grass, with its chain in a half\ncircle. Next day Squires went to the place and found the watch. At\nthe time of losing it he had been some distance away, and could not\nhave seen it fall.\n1 Proc, viii, 384. \" Ibid, 387.\n^ Ibid, 388. \" Ibid., 396. 5 Ibid., 383.\n\" This unenterprising behaviour contrasts with the splendid zeal of\nMr Peterson, who started from his bed at 2.30 a.m., called for boots and\nsaddle and relays of horses, knocked up his client after a three hours' ride,\nhad the books brought before him, and to his surprise found that the\ndream was correct!\n' Proc, xi, 397.\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 651\n14. Howe} Judge Howe had bought a house, and, naturally, had\nmade enquiries as to title, liens, etc. He dreamed that he met the\nsheriff, who told him that he was going to sell the house on account\nof a debt of S446.50, in a claim of R. M. v. J. Chaffe. Judge Howe\nnext day told his dream to Chaffe junior, from whom he had bought\nthe house (the Chaffe mentioned in the dream being dead). Mr Chaffe\nwent to his ledger and turned up an entry of a debt of S444.50 due to\nR. M. from his father, which with interest came to S446.50, the exact\namount mentioned in the dream. The debt had however been settled\nbefore the death of Mr Chaffe senior.\nMr Chaffe gives his ow^n statement confirming Judge Howe's,\nand making clear that he knew of the debt, and merely referred to\nthe ledger for confirmation. This was not the case as regards the\ninterest, however. According to Ho\\ve, Chaffe was surprised to\nfind in the ledger a pencil entry giving the amount of the interest ;\nChaffe himself says that he reckoned it there and then.\nProfessor W. Romaine Newbold's paper on Subconscious\nReasofiing^ contains two interesting examples.\n15. Lamberton. Professor Wm. A. Lamberton tried to solve a\nmathematical problem by algebraical means. After a week or two, T\ncame to the conclusion that I was bogged'. He dismissed the problem\nfrom his mind. In his bedroom there was a disused blackboard ; and\none morning a week later, when waking, he saw on this blackboard a\ndiagram giving a geometrical solution. The diagram vanished at once,\nbut he remembered it, and it proved correct.\nNewbold's second case is so well known that it need not be\nquoted. It is that of Professor Hilprecht, whose archaeological\nproblem was solved by the help of a dream-figure of an Assyrian\npriest.\nHilprecht's dream, with the R\u2014d, Eulogius, and Milan cases,\nare quoted by Andrew Lang.^ He adds tw^o others coming within\nhis own knowledge\u2014lost articles recovered without dream-\nfigures. Havelock Ellis* also discusses the question, and gives a\nmodern parallel to the Eulogius case in w'hich the mentor is a\nchemical expert and the dreamer an inventor. Carpenter^ devotes\na chapter to 'Unconscious Cerebration', but (apart from extracts\nfrom Miss Cobbe's paper) his examples are concerned with\nsomnambulism, and are in a different class. For the same reason\nI have not included accounts of the numerous lost articles re-\ncovered by 'Dreaming Joe' (Johannes Jonsson), as described by\nProfessor A. Bjarnason.\u00ab 'Dreaming Joe' was questioned in his\nsleep, and replied giving information about the objects. Clearly\n^\nProc, xi, 403. ' Proc, xii, 11.

One of these (Wilson, p. 71) is a waking\nimpression, but is otherwise similar to the Squires case ; the other\nis a dream. I give Mrs Sidgwick's summary.\n16. Hodgson.^ 'A burglary had occurred at Mrs Hodgson's house\non September 30th, 1897, and among other things a small papier-mach^\nbox which she valued had been taken. About a week later she dreamed\nshe went into the coal cellar and found it hidden among the fine coal.\nShe told her daughter of the dream the next morning, but it seemed so\nabsurd that no search was made. In August 1898 Mr Hodgson went\ninto the cellar to see how much coal there was, and found amongst the\nfine coal the lost box wrapped in a newspaper of the date of the\nburglary.'\nThe next case is as well known as Hilprecht's, but it is a crucial\none.\n17. Chaffin.^ J. L. Chafiin in 1905 made a will leaving his farm to\nthe third of four sons. In 19 19 he made a new will leaving everything\nequally between his sons. This will was unwitnessed, but, being holo-\ngraph, was valid under the local State law. Its existence was not known\nto anyone else. J. L. Chafiin died in 1921, and the earlier will was\nproved. In June 1925 the second son, J. P. Chafiin, had vivid dreams\nof his father, in one of which the latter appeared and said, 'You will\nfind the will in my overcoat pocket.' The overcoat was found. In its\nlining was not the will but a paper referring to an old Bible. The will\nwas discovered between the pages of the Bible. (In this case also it is\nuncertain whether the percipient was awake or asleep.)\nIn a series of articles on 'Remarkable Dreams',^ Dr W. H. C.\nTenhaeff includes a discussion of the 'solution' type, with\nnumerous examples. These are first-hand and recent, but con-\nfirmatory statements and fuller details would be useful in some\ncases.\n18. W. H. Mrs W. H. thought she had left her bicycle as usual in\na garage, but when she came to claim it, it could not be found. That\nnight she dreamed that she saw the machine standing in a yard of a\ngrocer's shop, and that on coming out on to the street she saw nearby\nanother shop which she had visited on the previous day. The next day\nshe went to the place, looked into the yard, and saw the bicycle. She\nhad left it standing in the street and forgotten about it, and it had been\nput into the yard overnight. The shopkeeper brought it out for her, so\nthat she never saw the yard from inside as in the dream.\n^ Proc, xxxiii. 2 Proc, xxxiii, 351. \u00ab\nProc, xxxvi, 517.\n* Tijdschrift voor Parapsychologie, X. .. . . . .,\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 653\n19.

M. feared it had been\nstolen by a maid who had lately been dismissed. In a dream he heard\na voice saying : 'What you thought has not happened, and what has\nhappened is what you would never have thought. Be at ease ; the ring\nis not stolen and will come back.' As a result of the dream, he felt\neasier in his mind, and took no action in the matter. A few days later\nthe ring was found. His daughter had put it in one of the decorations\nof a Christmas tree, and forgotten about it.\nSince the publication of Myers's papers, a number of fresh cases\nhave been printed in the Journal. Of these the following are most\nnoteworthy :\n21. Smith} At a church in Sydney, N.S.W., a hymn tune was sung\nwhich Mr Smith had never heard before (although he had seen the\nname of the tune in an old collection at his house in Aberdeen). He\nwas struck by the tune, and tried to learn it while it was being sung,\nbut forgot it soon afterwards. A month later he left for London. 'On\nthe passage home I often used to try to recall it, as it still haunted me,\nbut I could not do so, try as I might. One night while on the passage\nhome (the passage lasted 116 days from February 3rd, but I cannot\neven approximately give the date of the night I refer to) I dreamt that\nI was at the same church in Balmain, that the same hymn was sung to\nthe same tune and that I resolved that this time I should not forget it . . .\nJust as it finished, I awoke with the tune ringing in my ears and I knew\nit correctly.' He never afterwards forgot it.\nIn May of the same year a case is given which concerns two\nsisters. One of them was puzzled as to whom a certain person\nresembled ; the dream which gave the answer was dreamed by\nthe other sister, who had seen neither the person in question nor\nthe other person whom he resembled. Apart from occurring to\nthe wrong sister, the dream is of normal type.\nThe next case of interest is :\n22. Blaikie? 'In April, 1892, I had given to me an old cross of very-\ngood old paste and good design, which I shortly afterwards wore, for\nthe first time, at the theatre. On reaching home in the evening I found\nthat I had dropped it or had it stolen, and went to bed mourning its loss.\n'On falling asleep I dreamed what actually had happened\u2014that I had\nlost it on my way from the theatre\u2014but then fancied that I found myself,\nin broad daylight, in the drawing-room of the house in Place, W.,\nwhere I was then staying, and which overlooked the front door. In\nmy dream I looked out of the window and saw, lying in the gutter\nimmediately in front of the door, my cross, and rushed downstairs and\ninto the street and picked it up.\n^Journal, viii, 29. ^Journal, x, 30,\n\f654 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jULY\n'In the morning I had quite forgotten my dream, but in the afternoon\nwhen I was having tea in the drawing-room with my (hostess), she\nspoke of the cross I had lost and the unhkeHhood of my ever seeing it\nagain. I then remembered the dream, and told her about it.\n'\n\"I went forward to the window\", I said, \"and looked out, and there\nit was, lying in the gutter, close to the kerb.\"\n'She laughed, and we both went to the window and looked out, and\njust then the sun caught on something lying in the gutter, just at the\nkerb.\n'It was the old paste cross.' .\n'\nMiss Blaikie's account is corroborated by her hostess.\nSeveral cases of bodies being found through dreams are on\nrecord. In the following the 'solution' aspect is especially\nnoticeable :\n23. Blunt} James Blunt, a coal-miner of New Lambton, Co.\nDurham, and Police-constable Egleton, stationed in the same district,\nwere old friends. One Saturday night in January 1902 Egleton dis-\nappeared. A search was organised over the whole district, and carried\non energetically for four days by parties which included thirty or forty\nconstables ; but it proved fruitless. Blunt also assisted in the search.\n'He talked a lot about him, saying he wished he could be found.' In\nthe course of the search a certain stream running through Brecon Hill\nWood had been explored by Blunt and others. On Tljursday morning\nBlunt told five people (who confirm the story) of a dream he had had\nin the night. 'I dreamt that I saw the burn running through Brecon\nHill Wood, and in the stream by a stump of a tree B.C. Egleton was\nlying with his head to the stump, and I saw him in the dream lying in\ntwo feet of water.' He went to the spot at the first opportunity, later\nin the day, and found the body at the place seen in the dream. There\nwas afterwards noticed a mark on the bank, which may have been made\nby Egleton falling or throwing himself in. These facts came out at the\ninquest, at which an open verdict was returned ; but Egleton had been\nvery depressed before his disappearance, and had had a breakdown in\nhealth and family troubles as well.\nAnother 'lost body' case, Mme Clarinval's, can scarcely be\nincluded here, as it is a daylight hallucination ; it is discussed later.\n24. Wild.^ Miss Ida Wild lost a hammer. 'I hunted everywhere\nlikely for it, and had it constantly in mind.' Some weeks later, 'I\ndreamt I was walking in the long rough grass near the beehives, and\nsaw my hammer, fine and bright, on the top of the grass.' The hammer\nwas found there, but entirely covered by grass which had to be cut\naway to find it. It was not bright, but very rusty, and the haft sodden.\n^Journal, x, 298-303.

[Journal, xxix, p. 272) is of the Squires\ntype ; a key lost by Mr X when out fishing was found by Mrs X\nthrough a dream, although she had never been to the spot. Of\nthe same type is a case described by Major Giinther,^ Frau\nGiinther being the loser and her daughter the dreamer. He gives\ntwo other cases of lost articles recovered ; but the persons con-\ncerned are professional mediums, and the present paper must limit\nitself strictly to spontaneous cases.\nThese examples have been chosen from some ninety cases.\n^\nDoubtless a more thorough search would disclose many more, but\nit is clear that dreams of 'solution' type are rarer in the literature\nthan telepathic or precognitive dreams of the ordinary kind, which\ncan be counted by the hundred. (In the present paper, both tele-\npathy and precognition will be taken as established.) However,\nenough have been recorded to distinguish the type. Some prob-\nlem is presented to the waking mind which it cannot answer. The\nsubject is very much concerned over his failure.^ This is expressly\nstated in most cases ; in others, such as Chaffin's (17), it may be\npresumed. Sometimes he dismisses the question from his mind,\nand abandons the search ; in others, that he was not worrying\nacutely at the time of the dream may be presumed from the simple\nfact that he was asleep. In a dream the solution of the problem is\npresented, sometimes by a direct vision, sometimes through the\nmouth of a dream-figure. On waking the solution is tested and\nfound correct.\nIn contrast, the ordinary precognitive or telepathic dream arrives\nout of a clear sky. In some examples (such as the Terriss murder,\nquoted later) the dream may be the fulfilment of a subconscious\nwish, but not the solution of a problem consciously brooded over.\nIt is this, rather than the action taken as a result of the dream,\nwhich marks off the class. It is true that these dreams are almost\ninvariably, and other veridical dreams rather rarely, followed by\naction* ; but this is simply because unless action was taken the\n^ Zeitschrift fur metapsychische Forschung, December 1936.\n^ They include most of the cases with dream-figures, and every well-\nevidenced case which appears to be an exception to the generalisations\nwhich follow. The cases not mentioned are mainly simple lost-article\ndreams, or are insufficiently detailed or authenticated.\n' One of Dr Tenhaeff's correspondents, who frequently solves problems\nin sleep, says that the more he concentrates on the problem when awake\nthe more easily does he dream about it.\n'The exceptions are St Monica (3) and J. v. M. (20), where inaction\nwas enjoined by the dream itself ; Yates (12), Hodgson (16), and possibly\nBlaikie (22), where the article was found by chance ; and Smith (21),\nwhere no action was necessary.\n\f656 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nlost article would not be found, or the problem would not be\nsolved, and the dream would never be revealed as veridical at all.\nThere is an interesting group of cases which, though they\ncannot be included with the 'solution' type, should not be left\nunmentioned ;\nthey may be described as 'professional anxiety'\ndreams. This group includes 'Father Brompton' and the dying\nwoman^ ; the coachman and the mare^ ; the surveyor and the\nbridge^ ; the insurance official and the fire* ; and the biographer\nand her subject.^ The information is in most cases acquired\nthrough precognition, but the first case is possibly telepathic, and\nthe last probably retrocognitive. An interesting feature is the\nlarge proportion of auditory dreams or hallucinations.*\nAlmost all these dreams, it is clear, are wish-fulfilments. The\none exception\u2014Howe's (14)\u2014is an anxiety dream, which is a wish-\nfulfilment reversed. They diff^er from the majority of the class in\nthat the dream is not a substitute for the real-life event, but a\nstepping-stone to it ; but this does not aff^ect the structure of the\ndream itself. When the figure of some other person supplies the\ninformation which solves the problem, it is to be presumed that\nhis appearance is a part of the wish : 'I wish F. were here to tell\nme about this.' F. must therefore be a person to whom the subject\nwould naturally turn. He must be believed to be able and willing\nto supply the information, and he must be known to the dreamer.\nThis does not exclude Hilprecht's priest, whose appearance would\nbe quite familiar to the Professor, or St Monica's 'beautiful young\nman', the traditional divine messenger ; but it explains why the\n^ Proc, xxxiii, 287. ^ Ibid., 138. ^ Proc, viii, 397.\n* Ibid., 396. ^Journal, v, 253.\n\" The following story has no evidential value, having been handed\ndown through three generations, but on internal evidence appears\ngenuine. I take it from Dr C. Dickson's Life of Michael Dzuyer (p. 180).\nIt dates from about 1800, when Dwyer was being hunted through the\nWicklow mountains, with a price on his head. A year or two before,\nMcAlister, one of his followers, had saved his life at the cost of his own.\n'One night as Dwyer had retired to a cave he had made in a double ditch\nin Leitrim (Glen Imaal) and which was unknown to anyone except\nMcAlister and himself, McAlister's spirit appeared, called him and saved\nhis life, he said. Before he was long in, he lay down tired after his watch-\nful day and soon was in slumber, when to his great astonishment he was\nawakened by a voice calling him. He sat up, listened for some time and\nheard nothing ; but thinking he was only dreaming, lay down again in\nsilence to listen, whereupon he distinctly heard McAlister's voice calling\nhim in stem tones to \"get up\". He at once recognised the voice, leaped\nup and peeped out just in time to find that he was almost surrounded by\nredcoats . .\n.' and succeeded in escaping. It should be added that\nMcAlister was the only Ulsterman in Dwyer's party, and his Northern\naccent would be quite unmistakable. As a dream-figure he is obviously\nhighly appropriate. . . . : . .\n..i-\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 657\nloser does not appear as F. in cases of the Squires type (13), why\nPeterson (11) did not imagine the opposing counsel or his client\nas giving him the clue to the missing evidence, and why Mrs\nW. H. (18) did not see the grocer in her dream. In Howe's case\n(14), similarly, the sheriff is part of the anxiety, and so comes in\nmore aptly than Chaffe senior or junior, either of whom, if he had\nthe information, might not be willing to give it. The sheriff, also,\nwould be a familiar figure to the Judge.\nThe deceased person is obviously the only possible dream-\nfigure in cases of the Marteville type (4), and he never fails to make\nhis appearance. That the pious Monica sees angels, and the free-\nthinking Synesius sees none, needs no lengthy explanation. Two\ncases, however, remain a little anomalous\u2014A. v. S. (9) and L. P. E.\n(19). The little girl's dead brother knew no more of the knife\nthan anyone else, and his entry into the dream seems inappropriate.\nSimilarly, there is no reason to suppose that the inventor's mother\nknew anything of mechanics or chemistry. But both these are\npersons to whom the dreamers were accustomed to turn in any\ndifficulty ; their use in the dream is inartistic, perhaps, but not\nunnatural.^\nThe only case which cannot be brought under the formula T\nwish F. were here to tell me' is F. R. C. P.'s (7). The landlord,\nhowever, is not a dream-figure in the sense in which we have been\nusing the term. He is not the bringer of news, but is himself the\nsought-for object. The message conveyed is : 'The landlord is\ncoming home late ;\nyou can meet him and get into the house.'\nThis is conveyed in the simplest possible way.\nThere are a number of cases in which the dreamer has no reason\nto suppose that anyone can help him. In nearly all such cases the\ndream is in the form of a direct vision. Sometimes, however, the\ninformation is difficult to express in images. This difficulty is\nsurmounted very neatly in Peterson's case, in which he is himself\nthe dream-figure. In J. v. M.'s an impersonal voice is heard, and\nthe same device is used in another dream of Peterson's^ which\nI have not quoted. This difficulty in direct presentation is,\n^ The 'Devil's Sonata' dream of Tartini might be cited as an example\nof an inappropriate dream-figure. However, the dream is not of 'solution'\ntype. Tartini was under no obligation to compose a sonata ; there was\nno problem, and no anxiety. I am not therefore compelled to explain\nthe Devil. However, it may be of interest to note that Tartini was\ndestined by his parents for the Church, but expressed such a repugnance\nto the idea that they were compelled to give it up. From an early age,\nmusic and the Church must have been opposed to each other in Tartini's\nmind ; that the Devil, the enemy of the Church, should appear as the\nprovider of music, is quite in accordance with the logic of dreams.\n= Proc, viii, 395.\n\f658 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nperhaps, a contributory cause of the use of imaginary figures like\nHilprecht's priest.\nIn studying spontaneous cases, the only form of experiment\npossible is the construction of fictitious cases, illustrating or\ncontravening the rules derived from the real cases. If the passage\nof time, or a more thorough examination of the literature, supplies\nreal cases corresponding to the first fictitious class, but not to the\nsecond, these rules will be established more firmly ; if not, they\nmust be reconsidered. Thus, the conclusions arrived at above\nmay be summed up by saying that the following should not occur :\nFictitious Case I. D. is much concerned over a certain problem. In\na dream he sees F., a person quite unknown to him, or an acquaintance\nwhom he has no reason to associate with the problem ; this person\ntells him the solution. D. wakes, tests the solution, and finds it correct.\nIt appears, then, that the conclusions of Augustine in the Milan\ncase^ are fully justified. The dream-figures are in all cases con-\nstructs of the dreamer, and have no relation to the objective\nsituation. The appearance of Chaffin senior to Chaffin junior (17)\ndoes not prove survival ; the non-appearance of Davis to Squires\n(13) does not disprove telepathy. The sole means of judging is\nthe information itself.\nIt is indeed remarkable that this information shows so little sign\nof its origin. It will not be disputed that in most lost-article cases\nthe source of the dream is the revival of a forgotten memory.\nThat memory must be of the act of losing ;\nyet this act itself hardly\never appears in the dream. The following seems a very plausible\nsequence :\nFictitious Case II. D. loses a valued article. He dreams of putting it\nin a certain place. On waking he looks there and finds it.\nOr, in the Marteville type :\nFictitious Case III. F. dies. D. cannot find his will. He dreams\nof F. going to a secret drawer, etc., and putting the will there. It is\nfound there on waking.\nNothing exactly like either of these is known to me. There are a\nfew special cases discussed below ; but in general the dream con-\ncerns itself with the finding, not the losing. Mrs Yates (12) does\nnot dream of putting the photographs in a drawer, but of taking\nthem out. Squires does not see the watch fall ; he sees it fallen.\nMrs Hodgson (16) does not dream of the box being hidden in the\ncellar, but of the box being discovered ; and so on.\nHere again the wish-fulfilment principle must be invoked.\nThe dreamer's thought is not 'I wish I knew how I lost the article',\n1 And of Mr Tyrrell {Proc, xlviii, 81 ff.).\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 659\nor even, in most cases, 'I wish I knew where it is', but 'I wish I had\nit now'. The dream, therefore, satisfies the wish most completely\nby looking forward to the point of application of the information.\nPeterson, for instance, sees himself making his point in court. It\nis the same in anxiety dreams ; Howe's vision of the sheriff about\nto sell the house is a long leap forward from the (erroneous)\ninformation of Mr Chaffe's debt.\nMiss Wild's case is an exception which, in the true sense, proves\nthe rule. She sees the hammer clean and bright, lying on top of\nthe grass, as it was when lost. But clearly it was no part of her\nwish that the hammer should be rusty and sodden, and only\nextricated with difficulty from the long grass which had grown\nover it. Even in this case, it is to be noted, the action of losing the\narticle is not reproduced in the dream.\n^\nIt is reproduced in Smith's case (21) ; but a hymn tune is no\nordinary lost article ; the moment of waking from the dream was\nthe moment of finding. Smith was not looking forward to any\nspecial future occasion on which he was to sing the hymn, and he\nhad not been taught it by anyone who could serve as a dream-\nfigure. In the circumstances it is difficult to see what else the\ndream could have done.\nThe same applies to the cashier's dream (6). This is not a lost-\narticle dream ; the missing amount had not been recorded any-\nwhere, and the recollection of the event was the only way in which\nthe problem could be solved. This case is also interesting in\nsuggesting a possible unconscious motive for the forgetting\u2014the\nwish to be rid of an unpleasant and embarrassing scene. It may\nbe suggested that an unconscious motive is at work in some other\nlost-article cases ; but in the majority the loss seems to have\noccurred very naturally.\nThe dream which looks forward to the point of application of\nthe information provides favourable conditions for precognition ;\nand precognitions are in fact found. The cases of Stuart (8),\nSquires (13), Blaikie (22), Hodgson (16), W. H. (18) and\nF. R. C. P. (7) are prima facie either clairvoyant or precognitive ;\nprecognition is possible in those of St Monica (3) and J. v. M. (20) ;\nand the precognitive element in the Wilmot case (10) is inescapable.\nThe chief difficulty about precognition is, of course, the ap-\nparent reversal of causation. The first serious attempt to solve\n^ In one of Dreaming Joe's dreams the action of losing was reproduced,\nbut the case was denied by Joe himself and could not be confirmed. In\nanother, Joe dreamed of a thief putting a missing purse in a certain place,\nbut it was not found there, nor was the thief ever identified. This suggests\nthat with professional 'clairvoyants' (Joe was almost a professional) the\ndesire to impress the client may have its eflfect on the form of the vision.\n\f66o Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nthis problem was made by J. W. Dunne. ^ In Dunne's theory\nthere are an infinite number of Time dimensions, of which, how-\never, only the first two need concern us here. His 'Time i' is\n'ordinary' time ; an observer to whom this is Time sees a three-\ndimensional world in which various events occur in succession.\nBut there is also a 'Time 2', and a corresponding 'Observer 2'.\nTo the latter. Observer I's three-dimensional field of view appears\nas a moving section of a four-dimensional world. By concen-\ntrating his attention on Observer I's view, Observer 2 perceives\nthe three-dimensional aspect of things. If this attention is relaxed,\nhowever, or if Observer i is not functioning\u2014that is, in states of\nabstraction or unconsciousness\u2014Observer 2 reverts to his proper\nfour-dimensional view. He then sees Time i as an extra dimen-\nsion of space, and all its length is equally present (though not\nequally accessible or equally interesting) to him. He can thcis\nperceive an event which is future to Observer i ; but to him it is\nneither future nor an event, but a mere static configuration.\nObserver I's impression that an event is happening is an illusion\ncaused by the 'present moment' which moves along Time i \u2014an\nillusion similar to that of a cinematograph. The only events which\nObserver 2 sees as really happening are, first, the steady movement\nof the 'present moment' along Time i, and, secondly, occasional\nchanges in the Time i 'future' due to intervention\u2014of which more\nmust be said later.\nIt follows from the above that the Freudian 'unconscious', or\nthe 'subconscious' or 'subliminal mind' of other authors, which is\ndominant in dreams or states of abstraction, must contain a large\nelement of Observer 2.\nX\nFig. I\nProfessor C. D. Broad^ has also produced a theory of pre-\ncognition using two Time dimensions. These are not, however,\nconnected by any law as in Dunne's theory. For illustrative\npurposes they are conceived as being at right angles (Fig. 1).\n' An Experiment with Time, 1927.\n^ Knozvledge and Foreknou'ledge. Aristotelian Society, Supplementary\nVol. xvi, 1937.\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 661\nAn event X which is after Y in Time i may therefore be before it\nin Time 2.\nBroad's theory is much less elaborate than Dunne's ; indeed it\nis a mere suggestion, put forward in the most tentative manner.\nIt can be seen, however, that its solution of the problem of\nreversed causation differs radically from Dunne's. Dunne asserts\nthat the supposed future event is really present, Broad that it may\nbe both past and future. It is thus theoretically possible in\nBroad's theory, but not in Dunne's, for an event to be the cause\nof its own cause. Broad's two times exist together ; an event\nwhich is before another in Time i may be subsequent to it in\nTime 2, and causation may operate in either Time dimension.\nTo any of Dunne's observers, however, there is only one real\nTime, and all inferior times are dimensions of space. Observer 2\nmay see an apparent cause-and-effect sequence running along\nTime i, but it is merely apparent, frozen as it were ;\nevents, to\nhim, happen in Time 2, and it is only in Time 2 that there can be\ncauses and effects.\nX3 . Ys\nL3 . \u00b13\nP3\nX, Y,\nPi\nFig. 2\nIt happens that one case in the present series raises this question\nsharply. It is Wilmot's. The dream contains a precognition of a\nfuture event\u2014it is therefore presumably caused by that event ;\nbut the event itself\u2014the finding of the money\u2014is the result of\nthe dream! This appears to be an example of circular causation,\nand hence tells strongly in favour of Broad's theory as against\nDunne's.\nDunne's theory, however, contains an important feature which\nso far has been barely mentioned\u2014the conception of 'interven-\ntion'. Observer 2 is not merely a passive spectator. He can\nintervene to alter the Time i future, and there are many cases on\nrecord to suggest that he sometimes does so. Fig. 2 represents\nsuch an intervention.\nXY represents the subject's life, and P the 'present moment'.\nX^Yj, X2Y2, etc., are states of the life which are successive in Time\n2. The 'present moment' moves along XY, occupying the\nsuccessive positions P^, Pj, P3.\n\f662 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nAt the moment of Time 2 represented by the bottom hne,\nObserver 2 looks along X^Y^ and observes the point Y^. The\nresult is, let us say, a dream about an aeroplane crash. As a result\nof the dream he takes action\u2014for instance, he cancels his intended\nflight. This action results in an alteration of the Time i future,\nincluding a lengthening of the subject's life as shown by X3Y3.\nHere we have three events\u2014the dream, the cancellation of the\nflight, and the lengthening of the life^\u2014which are linked in a causal\nsequence. Now, starting from the latter end, the sequence can be\ntraced back m Time i without difficulty up to a certain point. The\nlengthening of the fife is caused by the cancellation of the flight,\nwhich is caused by the recollection of the dream. But this last\nitem has no causal ancestor in Time i. In that dimension it\nappears to spring from nowhere. To trace the chain further we\nmust employ the outlook of Observer 2 ; we can then say that the\ndream resulted from observation of Yj. (It may be remarked that\nYj, the event precognized, is not future to any observer ; for\nObserver i will experience quite a different event when he comes\nto the point in X3Y3 corresponding to Y^. No observer i?i the Dunne\nseries cafi foresee the real future. In particular, no observer can\nforesee the results of his own intervention.)\nIf Observer 2 intervenes, therefore, the causal sequence must be\ntraced first in Time 2 and then in Time i . The moment of change\nfrom one Time to the other is, presumably, the moment when the\ndreamer wakes. He gets up, goes about his business, and the next\nnight goes to sleep again. But now the Time i length open to his\ninspection is not X^Y^ but X3Y3 ; in other words he may now\nprecognize the events which will (in Time i) result from his recent\nintervention. This may result in a new intervention, and so on\nindefinitely ; the chain of cause and eff^ect zig-zags across the\ndiagram. But it cannot turn back, either in Time i or Time 2.\nWe may now return to the Wilmot case. Let us suppose that\nWilmot has a dream in which his memory of the losing of the\nmoney is revived. This, just as much as a precognition, is the\nwork of Observer 2 ; the dream is derived from inspection of a\npart of XY between X and P. He wakes up with the memory\nof the dream. This, given his character and all other circum-\nstances, determines that next day he will search for the money\nand find it in the place dreamed of. In other words, the recollec-\ntion of the dream is intervention, and alters the Time i future.\nAs he still lies in bed, the finding of the money has become part\nof that future. There is therefore no reason why, if he goes to\nsleep again, he should not have a precognitive dream of the find-\ning ; and this will be the case however short or partial the waking\nmay be. If now the second dream obliterates the memory of the\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 663\nfirst, it will make no difference, for the second dream contains the\nsame essential information as the first, plus some extra details\nderived from precognition. The one-way sequence of causation\nis thus preserved.\nIt remains to be seen how this hypothesis will apply to other\ncases. It has already been noted that the act of losing the article\nvery seldom appears in the dream, although it must have been the\ndream's starting-point. This missing link in the causal chain\nmust have existed somewhere, and will fit very neatly into the\nhypothetical first dream. It may appear surprising that the first\ndream is so completely forgotten ; but after all the remembering\nof a dream, not its forgetting, is the unusual event, and in nearly\nall cases the two dreams may be presumed to be so alike that they\nwould become fused in recollection. Secondly, the first dream\ndoes sometimes leave a trace in memory. In the Wilmot case\nitself, we are told that the dream was repeated. It is quite possible\nthat on its first occurrence it lacked the details about the money\nrolling away. In Miss Blaikie's case (22) the whole mechanism\ncan be seen. The dream first refers to the losing, and then passes\nto the act of finding. That the first part of the dream is preserved\non this occasion is, perhaps, due to the circumstance that Miss\nBlaikie feared her ornament had been stolen. By re-enacting the\nloss, the dream reassures her on this point. The message of the\ndream is in fact in substance the same as J. v. M.'s, although so\ndifferently expressed.\nIf this theory of the Wilmot case be accepted, it can be applied\nalso to the touches of apparent clairvoyance in other cases. Mrs\nStuart saw the stone lying under a fallen leaf, with dewdrops\nsparkling in the sun\u2014just as it was at the time of the dream, but\nalso just as it was when she found it a few minutes later. Squires\nsaw the watch among tall grass, 'the steel chain lying in a half-\ncircle'\u2014a picture that could not have been derived from the mind\nof Davis, the loser ; but Squires himself saw it so on the following\nday. Mrs W. H. leaves her bicycle in the street, and finds it in a\nyard ;\nshe dreams of it in the yard. F. R. C. P. finds the landlord\ntalking to a friend, just as he had seen him in the vision ; he did\nnot enquire, apparently, if the friend had been there at the time\nof the vision some minutes earlier. Howe dreams, not of the\namount known to Chaffe, but of the amount plus interest, which\nhe did not find out till later. Blunt sees the body of Egleton as\nnobody\u2014including Egleton himself\u2014had seen it at the time, but\nas he himself saw it next day.\nThe precognized details may on this hypothesis be set aside, as\nthe dream-figures may be set aside, in the search for the source\nof the dream. What remains is the bare minimum of information\n\f664 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nnecessary to cause action. How does this information find its way\ninto the dream? There are several possibiHties.\nI. Chance. The hypothesis of chance coincidence has been\ngiven very Httle attention in this connexion. It impHes that there\nare many such dreams, and that the non-veridical ones are not\nrecorded. It is true that these would naturally be rather elusive.\nIf Peterson, for instance, after his Paul Revere ride, had not found\nthe missing evidence, it is pretty certain that he would not have\ntold the story to Myers or anyone else! But the probability of\nfinding the object by pure chance is so low in such cases as those\nof Squires and Mrs Stuart that these cases would require to be\nbalanced by thousands of falsidical ones. It is exceedingly im-\nprobable that all these cases would have escaped the attention of\nall the authorities who have considered the subject.\nMoreover, since the publication of Die Traumdeiitung one does\nnot talk so lightly of random dreams. A dream impressive enough\nto lead to action is almost certainly not random, whether veridical\nor otherwise. If in such a dream a lost object is seen in some\nplace, there must be some association between the place and the\nobject. If there is a chance coincidence, it must be between two\nsuch associations ; for instance a missing person may, in life, have\nfrequented a spot where his body is later discovered. In Blunt's\ncase, however, this does not seem very likely. Or the association\nmay be of the symbolic type ; the connexion between money and\ndirt, noticed by Freud, may have led Wilmot's dreaming mind to\nthe consideration of mud-heaps ; but we have still to explain why\nhe dreamed of the one particular mud-heap which actually con-\ntained the money, out of all the mud-heaps which he may have\nseen. And what association other than real contiguity could exist\nbetween Davis's watch and a particular clump of grass?\nThese considerations apply chiefly to dreams of the true\n'solution' type, preceded by anxiety over a particular problem,\nand followed by action. As regards wish-fulfilment and anxiety\ndreams in general, it is undeniable that the great majority come\nout of the gate of ivory. The St Monica type, in which the\ndreamer's action does not cause the denouement, is quite easily\nexplicable on a chance basis. The event prophesied is, in each of\nour two cases (3, 20), not very improbable. But even here the\nhypothesis of chance coincidence would be greatly strengthened\nif there were a large number of cases on record in which divine\nmessengers, or impressive voices heard in dreams, gave false\ninformation.\nII. Retrocognition} In most of the cases it is probable, or at\n^ Following Myers, I use this term rather than 'hypermnesia', to mark\nits similarity to precognition and its difference from ordinary memory.\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 665\nleast possible, that the information was at one time in the\ndreamer's possession, in which case its revival in the dream is\nunderstandable. It is not necessary that he should have con-\nsciously known it, for there is ample evidence that incidents\nignored by consciousness may be noted unconsciously. ^ This\nexplanation will not serve, however, for the dreams of St Monica,\nJ. v. M., Squires, Howe, Hodgson, Chaffin, and the vision of\nF. R. C. P. ; and in the Marteville case it is unlikely.\nHI. Precognition. There is no difficulty in accepting Mrs\nHodgson's dream as precognitive, and the same explanation is\napplicable in any of the cases in which there is no intervention by\nthe dreamer :\nJ. v. M., St Monica, and Yates. The nine years'\ninterval between dream and event in St Monica's case is unusually\nlong, but intervals of twenty years and more are known. In\nBlunt's dream (23) it must be borne in mind that the body of\nEgleton would almost certainly have been found sooner or later,\neven without the help of the dream. Precognition is thus a\npossibility here ; but so is retrocognition ; and even a post mortem\ntelepathy from Egleton is not out of the question. In fact this case\nruns the whole gamut of hypotheses, and it is best to follow the\njury's example and return an open verdict.\nIV. Clairvoyance is a possible explanation in every lost-object\ncase. The form of the vision in such cases as Miss Wild's is no\nargument against this, just as the form of Mrs Stuart's vision is no\nargument in its favour. The objection to clairvoyance is that it\nexplains all cases, both those which occur and those which do not.\nConsider the following :\nFictitious Case IV. A house is bombed, or a ship is wrecked, and a\nvalued possession is lost. The dreamer sees it among the ruins, or on\nthe seashore, in some place in which it would not have been discovered\nwithout the aid of the dream.\nThe antecedent conditions here must have existed in many\ncases ; but as far as my acquaintance with the literature goes, the\nOf late there has been a tendency to use 'retrocognition' for the Versailles\nand similar cases, in which the percipient seemingly experiences events\nof a remote past. These events, however, are not part of the subject's\npast. On the hypothesis that he is re-living the past of someone else, the\ncase is one of retrocognitive telepathy ;\notherwise, of retrocognitive\nclairvoyance.\n1 Secondary personalities of the 'Sally Beauchamp' type might be\ndescribed as the nearest possible approach to a conscious unconscious.\nThey often claim to be able to 'look out of the corner of the eyes' when\nthe primary personality is looking elsewhere. This has been very\ninterestingly described by 'B' of the BCA case, and verified by Morton\nPrince in experiments with the same subject. {Journal of Abnormal\nPsychology, iii and xiv.) .\n\f666 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\ndream has never resulted. To establish clairvoyance in such a\ncase, it must be shown (i) that no human eye saw the lost object\nin the place in which it was found (this excludes retrocognition\nand telepathy) ;\n(ii) that the discovery would not have been made\nexcept for the dream (this excludes precognition).^ Two cases in\nthe Journal come close to this ; neither is a dream case, and in\nneither is the evidence conclusive. Mrs 'Watson'^ lost her wed-\nding ring, and was directed by automatic writing to look for it in a\nsack of waste paper. It was found there, and was supposed to\nhave been carried in by rats\u2014the ring was lost in 1944, and the\nsack was filled with waste paper in 1945. It is unlikely that the\nring slipped in along with the paper ;\nhowever, it is not at all\nimpossible.\nThe other case is from the Revue Spirite, April 1921.^ Mme\nA. Clarinval's son Rene, an airman, was killed in 19 16, and buried\nby the Germans. After the armistice Mme Clarinval searched for\nthe grave, but it could not be found. Some months later she had\na waking vision of her son, apparently alive, between two unknown\nmen. The one on the left seemed to be a German, and the other a\nRussian. A further search was made three months later (not in\nconsequence of the vision), and it was established that the body\nhad been buried in the German cemetery as unknown. The\nofficer in charge refused to let the bodies be taken up for examina-\ntion. 'But I was determined. We returned to Verdun . . . and\nsought out the officer in command of the graves commission.\nAfter a long discussion ... he yielded, and gave us authority to\nmake a search. Next day at 5 in the morning we were at the\ncemetery ... By 12 o'clock 20 coffins had been opened without\nany result. The men went to dinner, and my husband and I\nstayed there, greatly depressed ; for we were beginning to lose\nhope . . . Suddenly I thought of my visiofi ... I said, \"Yes, we\nshall find him ; he is between a Russian and a German. There\nwas a Russian in the cemetery at Dieppe ; let us look for him.\"\nThe men came back and resumed their work, whilst we ourselves\nlooked for the Russian ... At last, at 4 o'clock, I found the\nRussian. To his left there was an unknown soldier, and to the left\nof the unknown a German.' The unknown corpse was exhumed,\nand proved to be that of Rene.\nCamille Flammarion, who published the case, was perplexed by\nthe form of the vision, which does not correspond with the reality.\n^ The possibility of such a case being precognitive is denied by Dunne's\ntheory, since no observer can foresee the result of his own intervention.\nTheir non-occurrence is therefore a point in favour of the theory.\n^Journal, xxxiii, 230-9. .\n\u00bb Quoted in ^OMJ-naZ XX, 244-9. . \" ,\n' r'\n\u2022\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 667\nAfter a comparison with others, and especially with the Wild case,\nit can be seen that there is no difficuhy here. Mme Clarinval's\nvision is the resuh of a very powerful wish. But that wish is not\nfor a grave, nor for a corpse\u2014the mother wants her son.\nThe first criterion of a clairvoyant case is here well satisfied.\nNo human being knew that Rene Clarinval was buried between a\nRussian and a German. The second, however, is more doubtful.\nIt seems clear that Mme Clarinval's actions were not affected by\nthe vision during the early part of the search. The question is,\nif she had not recollected it, would she have given up the search in\ndespair? On the one hand, the cemetery contained more than\n2,000 graves. We are not told how many of these were of un-\nknown soldiers-\u2014an important point\u2014but there may have been\nseveral hundred. Without the vision, the search would have\ntaken some days, and possibly weeks. On the other hand, we\nmust consider the intense determination of Mme Clarinval, which\nbroke down bureaucratic opposition, and sustained her through\nthe gruesome examination of dozens of corpses. On the whole, it\nseems likely that even without the vision she would have persisted\nin her search, at least for some time. It is therefore possible that\nshe would have achieved her object without the help of the vision ;\nthe latter, consequently, may be precognitive.\nI should add that both these cases are ascribed to intervention\nby spirits. There is no need to discuss this hypothesis, however,\nbecause, as Mr Hubert Wales pointed out in the Clarinval case,^\nthe dead persons knew no more of the facts than anyone else, and\ncould only have acquired them through clairvoyance. This is\ncontrary to the principle of the economy of h^^potheses ; if clair-\nvoyance is a fact at all, there is no reason to suppose that a dead\nperson is more clairvoyant than a living person. The sole basis\nfor the spiritist theory is the form in which the information is\nconveyed ; and this form, it has been shown, is moulded to suit\nthe wishes of the percipient.\nV. Telepathy. If clairvoyance is rejected, Squires's dream must\nbe considered as telepathic ;\nand, if we include post-morten tele-\npathy, Chaffin's also. Whatever is said about Squires will apply\nalso to the other cases of the same type, and (although no certainty\ncan now be reached) the Marteville and Milan cases may be parallel\nto Chaffin's. Others in which the telepathic explanation must be\nconsidered are Howe, F. R. C. P., and J. v. M.\nIt has already been suggested by several writers^ that telepathy\nis from subconscious to subconscious. This agrees with Dunne's\nview^, according to which, if A is the agent and P the percipient,\n^Journal, xx, 347. - For instance, A. Glardon, Journal, ix, 9.\n^ Note on telepathy in The New Immortality (1938).\n\f668 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nthe information is passed from Ai to A2, from A2 to P2, and\nfinally from P2 to Pi. We may therefore expect to find, on the\none hand, four-dimensional effects\u2014precognition or retrocogni-\ntion ; and on the other hand, evidence of subconscious activity\non the part of agent and percipient.\nAmong the 'solution' dreams there are no cases of precognitive\ntelepathy, which is not surprising, as will be seen if an attempt is\nmade to devise a fictitious case. Retrocognitive cases, however,\nare comparatively common. They may be expressed diagramma-\ntically as in Fig. 3.\nBD represents a period of the agent's life, and CE the corre-\nsponding period in that of the percipient. At B the information\nbecomes known (consciously or otherwise) to the agent ; at E it\nappears in the consciousness of the percipient. Discussion of such\ncases^ has hitherto turned largely on the question whether the tele-\npathic message followed the path BCE, implying a latent period\nB X D\ni I i\nC E\nFig. 3 i\n; ,\n.\nin the percipient's mind, or the path BDE. In the Chaffin case\nthe agent dies at the point X, and the BDE path therefore implies\nthe hypothesis of survival. But if it is conceded that both parties\nto the telepathy perceive four-dimensionally, then the time in\nwhich the telepathy occurs is Time 2, and the discussion loses its\npoint. To ask whether the communication was sent before or\nafter Chaffin's death is meaningless, since the death is not an event\nin Time 2 ; one might as well ask whether Euston station happens\nbefore or after six o'clock. There is, of course, a sense in which\nthe terminus is an event to a railway passenger ; but the ending of\nhis career as a passenger does not affect his existence as a human\nbeing ;\nsimilarly, the arrival of Chaffin i at the end of his journey\ndoes not imply the extinction of Chaffin 2. In the same way, the\nidea of a 'latent period' refers to Time i, and has no application\nto Time 2.\nTurning to the question of subconscious activity, we find that\nthere is no difficulty at the percipient's end. In every case he\nexperiences a dream or a hallucination, which is unquestionable\nevidence of such activity. The agent's part must be examined in\n^\ne.g. Proc, xl and xlvi, 'Is Proof of Survival Possible?'\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 669\nmore detail. In the Squires type, the information was never known\nto the conscious mind of the agent ; if these cases are telepathic\nat all this information must have been present subconsciously. In\nthe Marteville type the information was consciously known to the\nagent before his death, and in each case he had the opportunity to\npass it on to the percipient by normal means. Why did he not do\nso? Either he forgot, or he wished to conceal it. M. de\nMarteville, a methodical man of business, would not have left a\nreceipt for a large amount lying out of its proper place unless he\nhad forgotten or lost it. Chaffin's is a case of concealment, and\nhere a curious internal struggle may be observed. 'Chaffin A'\ndraws up a will ; 'Chaffin B' makes another contradicting the first.\n'A' contrives that the later will is unwitnessed, and hides it away;\n'B' writes out a clue to the hiding-place ; 'A' conceals the clue.\nThere is ample evidence here of a suppressed wish, which may\neasily have sunk into the subconscious.^\nIn the remaining two cases the identity of the agent is unknown.\nF. R. C. P.'s is put down to the landlord ; but this gentleman\npossesses no qualifications for the part beyond the fact that he\nknew of his own intention to return late. There is another person\nin the case who was in a good position to know this, and also to\nknow the doctor's problem ; who was vitally interested, and who\ncan easily be supposed to have a repressed desire to communicate\nthe information\u2014the delirious patient, struggling against her\ncraving.\nIn Howe's case there are three possible agents\u2014the two Chaffes\nand R. M., the creditor. The last-named was well known to\nJudge Howe, but we have no details of their acquaintanceship ; of\nChaffe senior we know only that he was dead. In connexion with\nChaffe junior, however, we have on important point. He had sold\nthe Judge a house. What price did he get for it? This question,\nirrelevant as it may appear, is perhaps the key to the problem.\nLet us suppose that the price was rather low. This explains, on\nHowe's side, the suppressed feeling that there must be a snag\nsomewhere, which appears in the form of an anxiety dream. But\nwhat of Chaffe? He knows that there are no snags. Howe has a\ngood bargain\u2014too good a bargain. The old debt has been paid\noff\u2014but suppose Howe thought it had not been paid off?\nIt will be objected that the train of thought I attribute to Chaffe\nis childishly spiteful. Such ideas would certainly find no place in\n* What was the 'particular reason' which made Mr R\u2014d's father\nemploy a diflferent lawyer for his purchase of the title-deeds? Why did\nHennings's clergyman put the receipt in a secret drawer? There is some-\nthing decidedly Chaflfinesque about such behaviour, the reason for which,\nunfortunately, we shall never know.\n\f670 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jULY\nhis conscious mind ; but they are quite in keeping with the ways\nof thinking of the subconscious ; and the combination of para-\nnormal powers with a childish mentality is encountered in many\ndepartments of psychical research.\nIn this and the preceding case the explanations have been\nlargely speculative, but this does not affect the chief point, which\nis that in no case do we find on the part of the agent both conscious\nknowledge and a conscious desire to communicate it. The\nobstacle to communication is always psychological, never merely\nphysical.\nIt may be concluded, then, that in the great majority of cases\nthe essential information is derived from retrocognition, telepathy,\nor precognition. Chance coincidence is possible in the St Monica\ntype, but clairvoyance is an unnecessary hypothesis,^ and the idea\nof a spirit message as usually conceived is inapplicable.\nI have now surveyed all the various types of 'solution' dream,\nwith the exception of that which at first sight seems the easiest to\nexplain\u2014the purely intellectual problem, such as those of\nLamberton and Hilprecht. In the cases hitherto discussed, the\ndreaming mind has been called upon for a momentary effort of\nmetrocognition, telepathy, or precognition. This is well within its\ncapacity, as shown by many other cases ; but sustained logical\nthinking is quite another matter.\nI do not deny that reasoning takes place in dreams ; but a\ndistinction, not hitherto important, must now be drawn between\nthe part of the mind that composes the dream\u2014the 'dramatist'\n\u2014\nand the part that watches the story as it unfolds\u2014the 'spectator'.^\nThe distinction is clear in most dreams ; a specially obvious case\nis that of dreams with surprise endings, as Stevenson' and\nGreenwood^ have observed. The difference of character between\nthese entities is often very striking, as in a dream of Havelock\nEllis's^ ;\n'. . . I dreamed that I was in a drawing-room and saw a\nbeautiful and attractive woman with an unusually low evening\ndress entirely revealing the breasts ;\nthen, between the breasts,\nthree additional nipples appeared, and I realised in my dream that\nhere was a case of supernumerary breasts of sufficient scientific\ninterest to be carefully examined later on ; and then, as I gazed,\nI saw a number of little fleshy nipple-like protuberances on the\n^ There is of course, much evidence of clairvoyance in other situations :\nfor instance, some of the Duke University experiments.\n^ In Dunne's terminology the 'dramatist' is Observer 2 and the\n'spectator' Observer 3.\n^ Essay on Dreams in Across the Plains, 1909.\n* Imagination in Dreams, 1894. ^ The Woria or Dreams, 191 1.\n\f1952] The Solution of Problems in Dreams 671\nbody, and thereupon I realised that I was really looking at a case\nof the rare skin disease termed tnollusciim fibrosum.' Here the\nerotic propensity and the rapid, illogical transitions of the\n'dramatist' are in strong contrast with the cool, detached, scientific\nattitude of the 'spectator'.\nThe 'spectator' reasons well, but cannot carry on a long train\nof thought because the 'facts' he has to go on\u2014the dream images\n\u2014\nare perpetually changing. The 'dramatist's' logic, where it can be\nrecovered, is of a most primitive type. The very structure of a\ndream is based on the 'undistributed middle'. Thus, the reasoning\nbehind Freud's dream of 'Uncle Joseph'^ is (in part) as follows :\n(i) N. has been found not guilty of a crime, therefore N. is a\ncriminal, (ii) My uncle Joseph was a criminal, (iii) Therefore\nN. is my uncle.\nA poetic metaphor, it may be remarked, is also an undistributed\nmiddle ; 'There is a garden in her face' is much the same sort of\nthing as 'N. is my uncle'. There is evidence of artistic ability in\ndreams\u2014consider, in these very cases, the appropriateness of the\nAssyrian priest, and the economy of the hallucinatory diagram on\nthe real blackboard\u2014but not of sustained reasoning.\nOne would expect, then, that in 'solution' dreams only the\nstarting-point would be provided by the 'dramatist'\u2014that, for\ninstance, in Lamberton's case (15) the dream-image would be a\ncombination of the blackboard and the algebraical form of the\nproblem ; that the 'spectator' would then realize that the attack\ncould be made along these lines ; that the dreamer would wake\nwith this idea, and proceed, in his waking hours, to the working-\nout. This does not happen. The dreamer is presented with a fait\naccompli, apparently the unaided work of the 'dramatist', and his\nwaking task is merely to check the result.\nBut, if we leave aside these dreams, and a few other special\ntypes such as the battle-dream, we have an overwhelming mass of\nevidence as to the character and capacities of the 'dramatist'. It is\nnaive, childish, changeable, following associations of form rather\nthan of idea, a lover of the obscene, erotic, coprolalic, violent, a\nphantast, sometimes nearly a poet, sometimes almost a maniac\n\u2014\nand this even in the most chaste and the most intellectual of man-\nkind. We are now asked to believe that this same entity, in\nLamberton's case, set itself soberly to the task of drawing tangents,\ndropping perpendiculars, and the detailed working-out of a prob-\nlem in geometry ; and in Hilprecht's, to the laborious deciphering\nof an Assyrian inscription.\nIn this dilemma it may be helpful to refer to the 'lost-article'\ncases. It was found that the article was frequently seen in the\n^ The Interpretation of Dreams, 6th English edition, p. 143.\n\f672 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\ndream as at the time of finding, not that of losing. This could be\naccounted for as to the motive by wish-fulfilment, and as to the\nmeans by precognition. In the cases now being considered, we\nhave an analogous effect, and the same motive ;\nmay not the means,\ntoo, be the same?\nThis may appear far-fetched. But if Lamberton, after solving\nhis probletn, had had a dream vision of the completed figure ; or if\nHilprecht had dreamed of the Assyrian priest on the ftext night, no\none would have thought it strange. The remarkable thing about\nthese dreams is their displacement in time. But this is the very\ndefinition of a precognitive dream.\nIf it be asked : when was the detailed work on the problem\ncarried out? the answer is that it was done on the day after the\ndream. The case is in fact parallel to Wilmot's. The dreaming\nmind, by bringing together elements which the waking mind had\nfailed to connect, gave the essential 'flash of inspiration' which\nmade the solution possible ; the solution itself thus became a\nfixed point in the future, and this reacted on the dream, giving it its\nfinal form. But the interaction of dream and event did not stop\nhere, for the working-out itself, owing to the interposition of the\ndream, became much less laborious, and was in fact reduced to a\nmere process of checking.\nThe motivation of the 'solution' dream is straightforward.\nThe conscious and subconscious mind are here working in co-\noperation, and not, as so often, in opposition. The subject is\nconcerned over his problem. He brings all his conscious faculties\nto bear on it, but without success. After a while he gives it up\nand 'puts it out of his mind'. The problem is thus handed over\nto the subliminal mind ; and it exerts its very different faculties\n\u2014\nincluding retrocognition, precognition, and telepathy.\nWhen playing tennis, you lose a ball. After much search you\ngive it up, get another and go on with the game. Your dog mean-\nwhile has been watching ; and some time later, when you have\nforgotten all about it, he comes frisking up with the lost ball in his\nmouth\u2014having smelt it out.\nThe subliminal mind, too, must handle its material in its own\nway. It dramatises, symbolises, condenses, and distorts just as it\ndoes with any other waking experience. Sometimes it comes up\n(wagging its tail, as it were) with something quite inappropriate.\nTake the Howe case ; the conscious mind asks anxiously, 'Are\nthere any unsettled claims on this property?' The dreaming mind\nresponds by producing a claim that has been settled some time\nago. Another example (though not a 'solution' dream) is the well-\nknown Terriss case. Mr Lane, a subordinate actor, dreamed of\nthe murder of Terriss, the star, the night before it happened.\n\fI952J The Solution of Problems in Dreams 673\nLane was Terriss's understudy. He must therefore, like all under-\nstudies, have been longing for his principal to fall ill, so that he\ncould have a chance of making a name for himself. Probably he\ntried to repress these longings. In sleep, however, the dreaming\nmind set off in search of such a situation, and came back with the\nnearest it could find\u2014Terriss's approaching murder. This, how-\never, was not at all what Lane wanted, as of course the theatre was\nclosed and did not re-open until a new star had been engaged.\nThe 'solution' dream may be classed among a series of mental\nprocesses which have the common feature that the attention is first\nconcentrated and then relaxed. The simplest case\u2014cited by\nWilliam James^\u2014is the everyday one in which a forgotten word\nor name, for which one racks one's brains in vain, comes back 'of\nits own accord' some time later. From this we may pass to the\nsolution of puzzles, and from them to scientific discovery and\ninvention ; in each of these the same sequence of mental events is\nfound. Artistic inspiration is somewhat different, but may still be\nbrought under the same formula. When Wordsworth saw the\ndaffodils, his senses were keenly stimulated ; his attention was\ndirected strongly outwards. Later, lying on his couch 'in vacant\nor in pensive mood', the image recurred spontaneously, bringing\nwith it the beginnings of a poem.\nFinally, the most striking phenomenon of this class is un-\ndoubtedly religious conversion. The analogy between sudden\nconversion and the 'solution' dream is close. We have first a\nperiod of mental distress, often very severe and prolonged ;\nduring\nthis time the problems of sin and salvation are unceasingly brooded\nover. Then there often intervenes a period of tranquillity during\nwhich the problem is put aside ;\nfinally, in a sudden uprush of\nsubliminal energy, often accompanied by hallucinatory visions\nand voices, the answer is found. Whether, on such occasions, any\nobjective information is brought up, is a question which can\nscarcely be discussed here. However this may be, the subject's\nproblem is solved.\n* Varieties of Religious Experience, 1902, p. 205.\n\f674 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jULY\nWATER DIVINING \u2022\n, m;\nSummary of an Exchange of Views between\nP. A. Ongley and T. C. Maby\nWe give below a precis of articles by P. A. Ongley and J. C.\nMaby which appeared in the Journal of the British Waterworks\nAssociation (Vol. xxxi, August 1949, Vol. xxxii, April, June,\nOctober 1950).\nP. A. Ongley, M.Sc, is a New Zealand research chemist.\nJ. C, Maby, B.Sc, is a full-time water diviner who uses instru-\nmental methods.\nThe first article 'Divining in New Zealand' is from Ongley's\npen. He begins by quoting an opinion of Ellis in 1917 that\ndowsing had been thoroughly discredited. He then quotes the\n1920 figures of the New South Wales Commission for Water\nConservation and Irrigation :\n; ; i,!, ;r.,,.[\n1. Serviceable bores giving more\nthan loo gals, per hour\n2. Serviceable bores giving less\nthan 100 gals, per hour\n3. Unserviceable bores\n4.

To\ncondemn divining on inadequate evidence would be unfair. It is\nalmost impossible to get comparative figures for the success of\ndiviners and non-diviners in selecting well sites.\nIt is often claimed that where well A (undivined) went dry,\nwell B (divined nearby) was successful. Ongley gives a diagram\nto show a possible explanation in terms of geology. Successful\nwater divining is often due to common sense. Other claims\ndepend on half-truths and deliberate untruths on the part of\ndiviners ; an example is given of each.\nOngley's Experiments. Seventy-five New Zealand diviners were\ntested. They included clergymen, ex-nurses, motor-mechanics,\nmill-hands, farmers, etc. Ten were women. In all tests care was\ntaken to test only what the diviner claimed to do. Rigorous\ncontrol experiments were done to make sure : that (a) there were\nno 'interfering rays' ;\n(b) containers etc. did not cut off 'divinable\n\f1952] . . Water Divining 675\nrays' ;\n(c) there was enough material to be divined ;\n(d) 'reminis-\ncences' (divinable traces allegedly left behind when a substance is\nmoved) could not account for wrong results.\nSixty diviners were divining for water, the remaining fifteen\nfor miscellaneous substances. Some claimed to find only moving\nwater, the rest to find water anywhere.\nThe first test was to see how accurately the diviner could locate\nthe edge of an already divined stream on repetition. If his eyes\nwere open the diviner always 'found' his 'stream' at the same\nplace, but blindfold he would be up to ten feet out. In control\ntests blindfold normal subjects did rather better than the dowsers\nin locating a predetermined mark.\nFour diviners were tested to see if they would declare pegs in the\nground already dubbed by them as 'wet' or 'dry', to be in the same\nstate on repeat attempts. Observed :\n113 right in 210 trials\n(expected 105).\nOngley quotes instances of diviners contradicting each other in\nreporting streams crossing a given line. Diviners who could 'find'\nonly running water were asked to tell whether a mains supply was\non or off. Eight diviners scored 80 out of 170 (expected 85).\nThose who could only find static water were asked to tell water\nfrom an organic liquid or to say whether a bottle was full or\nempty. The 7 diviners so tested scored 116 out of 210 (expected\n105). All the dowsers were badly astray about depth of water.\nExamples of dowsing for miscellaneous objects are given. The\nresults are described as 'ludicrous'.\n'Although, unfortunately it has not been possible to test every\ndiviner on all his claims, nevertheless each has conclusively been\nproved totally unreliable.' Digging wells on divined sites is im-\npracticable and not as decisive as the results of so-called artificial\ntests, in defence of which may be noted that (i) diviners were\nasked to suggest tests ; (2) in many cases, e.g. in identifying\nmetals, these tests had been used by diviners themselves ; (3)\ncareful tests were always done to see that the tests were both fair\nto the diviner and foolproof ; (4) one diviner said, 'Your tests are\nperfectly fair. Until I tried I would have bet ^5 to a penny I\nwould have been successful.'\nOngley also defends the blindfold tests. He concludes his\narticle with a discussion of the mechanism of movement of the\ndiviner's rod, and applies a mathematical treatment to the problem.\nHe concludes that the bending of the rod is due to the unnatural\nposition of the hands producing a torsional couple on it in a\nvertical plane.\nSummarising, Ongley maintains that 75 diviners would have\nincluded some, at least, of the reliable diviners had any existed.\n\f676 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nSecondly, '. . . the nuisance value and the menace of dowsing is\nnot sufficiently realised. A water or mineral witcher can cause an\nawful waste of private and public money. The medical witcher\ncan cause a waste of human life.'\nMaby in his reply complains '. . . Ongley shows no sign of\nhaving properly examined the very large body of positive instru-\nmental and physiological data, or the excellent records of a few\naccredited dowsers, before drawing dogmatic conclusions.'\nOngley is prejudiced ; his intentions are sincere but misguided.\nMaby accepts his results, '. . . so far as they go, at their face value.\nBut the matter does not end there, since a vast body of evidence\nby numerous competent engineers, physicists, physiologists and\nothers has securely established the basic facts of radiesthesia and\ndowsing (excluding interfering psychological factors) in recent\nyears, despite the negative results of Ongley, Macfayden and one\nor two other sceptics.'\nNeuro-muscular reflexes to living organisms etc. can be demon-\nstrated in the laboratory (Maby refers to Tromp's Psychical\nPhysics and to Maby and Franklin's Physics of the Divining Rod),\nyet 'the practical application of dowsing reflexes in accurate\nsurveys and analyses is problematical'.\n'There have never been more than a few tolerably expert, self-\ncritical, reliable diviners in any one country.' Maby agrees with\nOngley that enthusiastic amateurs have a high nuisance value.\nThis does not disprove true dowsing, cf. the work of Tromp,\nPericas, De Vita, Von Pohl, Dannert, Regnault, Jemma, Gorceix,\nChicca, Creyke, Budgett, Turenne, Maby, Franklin, and others ;\nalso the commercial success over years of Pericas, De Vita,\nCreyke, Franklin, and Maby.\nThere is nothing supernormal about genuine divining. [Maby\nbelongs to the school of thought which holds that dowsing is\nsolely physico-physiological and not psychic] Modern dowsing\nhas shown that there are many complicating physical factors to\ncontend with : 'Hence the frequent errors and misinterpretations\nof quite objective physical effects by both dowsers and instruments\nused.' Few dowsers realize these sources of error. Examination\nof a mixed bag of dowsers and sites is useless. Genuine successes\nwill be lost in a 'jungle of guesswork, auto-suggestion and chance\ncoincidence ... In any case, geological conditions should be taken\ninto account . . . one must be sure that : (a) a really competent\ndowser is employed ;\n(b) he works under fair and proper condi-\ntions, free from geophysical, meteorological, physiological and\neven psychological sources of interference . .\n.'\nIn conclusion Maby says Ongley has shown that New Zealand\n\f1952] Water Divining 677\ndowsers have no commercial value. He cannot accept that all\ndowsing is unreliable as the reverse has been proved many times.\nDowsers should be more cautious and self-critical and follow the\nprecepts of Tromp, Franklin, and Maby. The general public\nshould be more objective in its approach, scientists and engineers\nless prejudiced.\nIn his second article Ongley replies that in fact he is quite\nfamiliar with the classical literature on dowsing, and with Maby's\nbook and papers. He repeats his contention that many of the\n'excellent records' of dowsers are due to half-truths and untruths.\nOngley does not agree that he only tested duds, contending that he\ntested all comers ;\namong the 75 there should surely have been\nsome of ability. All care was taken to see that no diviner attempted\nanything beyond his alleged powers and that all tests were both\nfair and foolproof.\nIn a six-page paper he had no room for detailed results. These\nare described more fully in the New Zealand Journal of Science\nand Technology, 1949, 30B, pp. 38-54. Ongley concludes with a\nchallenge : T am willing to go anywhere to meet up to say half-a-\ndozen diviners in the field on the following conditions : (i) I am\nable to come from and return to Glasgow within the weekend ;\n(ii) Before we start trials we agree on what we are going to try\nto do . . . (iii) [not relevant to this precis] ;\n(iv) If the diviners\nare unable to substantiate their claims, I would expect a refund of\ntravelling expenses.'\nMaby, in his second article, says Ongley is clearly fixed in his\nviews though otherwise fair ; he again recommends studying the\nliterature, watching a good commercial dowser at work, and asking\nfor his records of a typical year's working, e.g. some of Maby's\nown results which he gave in the Journal of the British Society of\nDowsers for March, 1949.\nIn fairly homogeneous strata, average weather, open rural\ncountry, and absence of thick clay or shale beds, depths can often\nbe predicted to one per cent and yields to ten per cent. The\nreverse conditions may lead to serious errors. There is no\nquestion of '. . . \"clairvoyant perception\", but merely a straight-\nforward electrical and geophysical routine (incorporating both the\ndivining rod and a few simple electromagnetic accessories) as\nroughly described in The Physics of tlie Divining Rod' . But errors\narise readily from complicating physical and even psychological\nfactors.\nOngley assumes undue authority because he is a chemist, not a\nphysiologist or geophysicist or electronic engineer. Many very\n\f678 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [july\neminent physicists, physiologists, doctors, and engineers have\nalready agreed to both the main facts and also some of the tentative\nexplanations of dowsing.\nMoreover, tests of the type Ongley carried out require both a\nspecial technique and a very considerable knowledge of human\npsychology. Sceptics or hostile investigators invariably cause\nfailure because of the psycho-radiant output of short waves from\ntheir bodies which can be picked up by dowsers and by certain\nnew electro-mechanical detectors. Perhaps Ongley is an inhibitor.\nMaby is unable to accept Ongley's challenge because (i) 'there\nare too many . . . almost threatening conditions attached' ;\n(ii) he\nand other experts are too busy ; and (iii) there is ample positive\nevidence on record. Anyhow, what would be the use of convincing\nOngley, whose verdict would not be likely to result in universal\nacceptance?\nThe exchange of views concludes with a rejoinder from Ongley,\nwho claims that, Hke many others before him, he has investigated\ndowsing as fully as the diviners would allow him. 'there is not a\nshred of unequivocal evidence in favour of divining ... In contrast\nto the formidable literature that has accumulated against divining\nthe only reputable literature that might possibly be interpreted as\nfavourable to the art is the paper of Barrett who, after meandering\nindecisively for 250 pages, concludes by saying more or less that\nhe does not know what to think. That Maby needs to rely on this\n50-year-old paper as his mainstay is in itself sufficient condemna-\ntion.'\nOngley quotes Barrett in support of his views that a dowser s\nown records cannot be relied upon. The 'eminent physicists,\nphysiologists, doctors and engineers' supporting dowsing exist\nonly in Maby's imagination. If they do exist it proves nothing.\n'In science, what count are not authority, but facts, and the logic\nof the conclusions drawn from these.' Ongley says that although\na chemist, he has a working knowledge of physics, biology,\nphysiology, and statistics, and has had the assistance of expert\ngeologists, physicists, medical men, farmers, and well-borers. As\nan ex-teacher he probably knows all that is needed about setting\nexaminations and handling examinees. Maby's excuses for not\naccepting his challenge are so farcical as not to need rebuttal.\nEvidence for dowsing should not comprise statements of prowess,\nbut actual results in foolproof tests in the presence of impartial\nobservers. If Maby and the dowsers are unwilling to supply the\nevidence one can only assume they cannot.\n\fr\n1952] Reviews 679\nREVIEWS\nHomo Faber : A Study of Man's Mental Evolution. By G. N. M.\nTyrrell. London, Methuen, 1951. viii, 205 pp. 15s.\nMr Tyrrell here defends and extols the fundamental importance\nto modern man of a broad comprehensive non-specialist approach\nto the problem of his own nature and place in the universe.\nScience, he believes, represents progressive specialization in tech-\nniques for the control of the material world, with a resulting mast-\nery of immediate reality and an increasingly hopeless removal from\nthe apprehension of ultimate reality.\nThe philosophical tools employed in this analysis are derived\n:\nlargely from Bergson and from Eddington. It is Bergson's Homo\nFaber in the Creative Evolution, with a mind structured by the\nadaptive necessity to cope with the physical world, who supplies\nthe title ; and who also supplies much of the groundwork for the\ndescription of a practical mind working, in geometrical and mech-\nanical terms, to master the practical obstacles which material\nNature presents. It is Eddington's brilliant description of the\nscientists' dilemma (in the Philosophy of Physical Science) that\nguides Mr Tyrrell through the epistemological quicksands of\nmodern positivism. From Bergson we learn that our minds were\nevolved to act, not to grasp ultimate realities ; and from Eddington\nwe learn (if Kant had not already persuaded us) that the objective\nand the mathematical take on a certain form and present a certain\nsolid facade of unquestionable truth because we have in the first\nplace determined, by the very structure of our minds, what\nmanner of things there are in the world. Truths which belong to\nthis objective system are 'convergent', and can be brought into\nmore and more refined formulation ; those which transcend it lead\nto 'divergent' difficulties, out of range of Homo Faber's sight,\nwhich 'paralyse the mind and dishearten it' (p. 58).\nIn the light of this analysis, physical science, biological science,\nand psychology can all win tactical success against immediate local\nobjectives, and philosophy can achieve rationalistic successes\nthrough improved clarification of terms ; but all specializations\nlead us away from the intuitive grasp of our own natures and of the\ncosmos to which we belong. Specialization actually tends, Mr\nTyrrell believes, to disturb our capacity for self-understanding\nand self-fulfilment.\nIn reading these earnest arguments from a man of such highly\nspecialized and such brilliantly creative analytic powers, the\nreviewer confesses to a considerable bewilderment. Mr Tyrrell's\ningenious experiments in paranormal perception exemplify all the\ncharacteristics of the astute planner and controller of the conditions\n\f68o Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nunder which a fact has to be observed if it is to be known to exist ;\nall of Homo Faber's adaptive resourcefulness was poured into\nthem. It is not true that he concerned himself as scientist only\nwith the external and objective phases of his subject's mind ; he\nwas just as much a specialist when he was considering subjective\nas he was in considering objective aspects of his problem. He is\nthe same Mr Tyrrell who gave us the magnificent study Appari-\ntions, involving a highly disciplined and highly specialized study\nof very complex and bewildering psychological phenomena, in-\ncluding the analysis of unconscious dynamics and interpersonal\ninteractions. Is it just possible that Mr Tyrrell in the present\nvolume is not really attacking the specialist at all, but the dogmatic\nmaterialist who uses the sciences as weapons in his ideological\nbattle?\nPerhaps this short volume is not the place for me to hope for an\nanswer to my difficulties, but I am also worried by the lack of\ndefinition of two terms which are central in the present effort :\ninstinct and intuition. Throughout the book the innate pre-\ndisposition to observe and to think in a given manner (a predisposi-\ntion to which traditionally the term 'intuition' has sometimes been\napplied) is referred to as an instinct ; we even learn that those who\nuncritically hold to such an instinct 'will go on holding it, just as\nbirds will go on building nests and rabbits will go on digging\nholes' (p. 173). On the other hand the term intuition is applied\nto a process transcending the sensory processes (and apparently\nalso the ordinary rational operations) ; it is compared with religious\nand at times with creative activities in such a way as to suggest\nthat these are vehicles by which it is carried ; it is said to carry us\nto a kind of self-understanding which will free us from the\nspecialist's errors ; but it remains undefined. Light on the\nprocess is, despite all this, shed in some degree by reference to\nIndian mysticism ; and I must confess that Mr Tyrrell has done\nmuch to convince me that we need far more competent and\nthorough studies of Indian practices than we have, by specialists\nwho are themselves in the thick of the phenomena, deeply sym-\npathetic and capable of identifying with the adepts, and also\nequipped with tools for careful observation and analysis. I am\nsure that if I could talk with Mr Tyrrell he would agree. It is\nsurely not the specialist that he decries, but the specialist who\nspecialises before he exposes himself to the ABCs of human\nnature, in which always much of the non-geometrical is found.\nThe trouble with the reviewer is very likely the fact that he is a\nsort of a specialist. His own bias is to think that Mr Tyrrell\nreally believes in organized specialized science just as much as he\nhimself does, and that time will bring him back to another series of\n\f1952] Reviews 681\nbrilliant contributions to psychical research, in the best tradition\nof science, with all the appurtenances of Homo Faber's analytic\nmind and all the humanity of one who can see deeply into The\nPersonality of Ma?i.

By Nandor\nFodor. New York, Citadel Press, 1 95 1, xvi, 363 pp. $5.00\nDr Nandor Fodor was at one time a well-known figure in the\nfield of psychical research\u2014though, so far as the present reviewer\nis aware, he was never actively connected with the S.P.R. In\nmore recent years he has turned to psycho-analysis, and he can\nnow speak of 'my psychical research days' as being of the past.\nNevertheless his interest in what might be called borderline\nphenomena has persisted, and in the new field has manifested\nItself in a considerable preoccupation with some of the more\nmysterious problems which present themselves to the psycho-\nanalyst, so that he has to some extent constituted himself a liaison\nofficer, calling attention on the one hand to the possible importance\nto the psycho-analyst of certain recognized problems in para-\npsychology and on the other to the interest which some of the\nmore curious phenomena revealed by psycho-analysis might quite\nnaturally present to the student of psychical research.\nAs regards the first of these he justifiably reminds psycho-\nanalysts that (with a very few exceptions) they have not followed\nup Freud's own suggestion that psycho-analysis 'has prepared the\nway for the acceptance of such phenomena as telepathy'. Like\nFreud himself, Fodor is inclined to believe that telepathy manifests\nitself between the unconscious minds of the persons concerned\nand that this accounts for much of the apparently erratic and\nelusive nature of the relevant phenomena, which makes them often\nso exasperatingly unamenable to experimental or other conditions\nimposed by conscious intention. Being by its nature an affair of\nthe unconscious, telepathy also partakes of the other characteristics\nof unconscious mental processes as revealed by psycho-analysis.\nAs with dreams and other mental events largely affected by the\nunconscious, the 'meaning' of telepathic impressions is frequently\nnot immediately obvious to the conscious mind and may require\n'interpretation' of the kind familiar in psycho-analysis\u2014and\ntherefore sometimes apparently fantastic or 'far-fetched' in its\n\f682 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [jULY\nnature\u2014before the full extent and nature of the telepathic occur-\nrence becomes clear.\nThis process of interpretation, however, naturally increases the\ndifficulty of scientific proof, since (as with psycho-analytic inter-\npretations generally) there is often room for doubt as to whether\nthe interpretation in any given case is correct or adequate. The\nauthor's own interpretations in this book range from those which\nwould be acceptable to almost anybody who is willing to grant\nthat a symbolic process is at work to others as regards which even\nmany fellow psycho-analysts might be sceptical, especially as, in\nthe interest of speeding up the therapeutic and interpretative\nprocess, Dr Fodor is admittedly prone to a somewhat active inter-\nference with the analysand's associations.\nIn the present book the author deals (amidst much other\nmaterial) with some twenty cases in which telepathy seems to have\nmanifested itself in the dreams of two or more subjects, usually\nbut not always on the same night, a number of them occurring\nduring or in connection with psycho-analytic treatment. Some of\nthese are striking, there being in one case no less than eight\n'elements in common' between the 'shared dreams'. In another\npair of dreams it would seem that the cognitive content had got\ndissociated from its affective context, so that one dreamer can\nsubsequently say to another : 'You were not afraid of the fire.\nYou could afford it, because I got your fear' (p. 198). Displace-\nment of affect is of course well known in psycho-analysis since its\nearly days, but here the displacement is from one dreamer to\nanother. As one criterion of telepathic influence in dreams, the\nauthor suggests that a 'shared dream' cannot be adequately\nexplained or interpreted even by the most assiduous psycho-\nanalytic procedures unless the corresponding dream of the other\nperson is taken into account. But as to the circumstances which\ntend to produce such 'shared dreams' he is cautiously reticent,\nexcept for suggesting that there may be present some element of\nsympathy or 'need for companionship, for sharing warmth and\naffection, as well as the need for protection and reassurance in the\ncase of fear and anxiety' (p. 203).\nIn the absence of some compelling or quantitative criterion\n(such as can usually only be supplied by rigorous experimental\nprocedure) readers' judgment concerning the evidence submitted\nwill inevitably vary, but it can certainly be said that the author\nhas here provided a good prima facie case for further investigation\nalong these lines. Furthermore, his data suggest the reflection\nthat, if telepathic dreams occur, they would in the vast majority\nof instances be overlooked, so that there would seem to be a strong\ncase for a detailed comparison of dreams over a given period as\n\fReviews 683\nbetween persons possessing some common bond which might\nseem to make their occurrence Hkely. (Would that we knew more\nabout the nature of such common bond!) Ideally, perhaps, these\ndreams should in the first place be submitted to some third person\nwith a knowledge of the personalities and circumstances of the\ntwo dreamers, with psycho-analytic training and with opportunity\nfor interviewing them when necessary. The introduction of such\na third person, though in practice it might often be far from easy,\nmight reduce difficulties arising from the dreamers' own 'resis-\ntances' and at the same time minimise the dangers of mutual\nsuggestion during subsequent discussion, such as is almost bound\nto occur if the dreams are first discussed and 'interpreted' by the\ndreamers themselves. Some further description of the author's\nown precautions to avoid such suggestive influences would in\ncertain cases have been welcome.\nDr Fodor also believes in the reality of 'prophetic' dreams,\nthough here the evidence presented is less extensive. As in the\ncase of 'shared dreams', psycho-analytic interpretation is usually\nnecessary. Thus in a dream of his own he contends that there is\nprecognition of a quite unanticipated outcome of a libel action.\nTo mention the most impressive element, he dreamt that he was\npresented with ^4 for a suit (of clothes), with which sum he was\ndissatisfied, as he expected the suit would cost (this was early\nin 1939). In the subsequent (law)suit, the judge quite un-\nexpectedly divided the grounds of libel into four groups. The\njury found libel on two of these counts, but not on the other two,\nwhereupon the judge divided the costs, so that Dr Fodor received\nonly half of the full cost of his 'suit' (p. 314).\nIn the other of the two fields in which, as was suggested above,\nDr Fodor has constituted himself a sort of liaison officer, he is\nparticularly concerned with the influence of birth and intra-\nuterine fantasies and the anxieties connected with them. In this\nhe follows up the theme of his earlier volume The Search for the\nBeloved. Ever since Freud first pointed out the existence of\ndreams and fantasies of this kind, they have constituted a problem\nwhich most psycho-analysts seem to have been shy in tackling.\nOtto Rank's book The Trauma of Birth, which appeared in\n1924, has been cold-shouldered as supposedly guilty of exaggera-\ntion and as manifesting a flight from the more plausible and more\neasily verifiable factors of later life revealed as important by\npsycho-analysts. The possible influence of the birth trauma is\ncomplicated by the fact that birth fantasies are undoubtedly used\nto symbolise (perhaps we should say to conceal or cover) incestuous\ntendencies connected with the Oedipus complex or indeed sexual\nor other desires of a more general nature (the latter including the\n\f684 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nwidespread notion of 'spiritual rebirth'). Dr Fodor recognizes\nthe reaHty of this tendency (which he calls 'retrojection'), but\nnevertheless is firm in his insistence on the importance of birth\nfantasies in their own right and maintains that genuine birth\ndreams can often be detected by an element of 'fatality' (in the\nsense that something ttiust be done), finding a further justification\nin the therapeutic success in his hands of what he calls 'birth\ntherapy'.\nWhen we turn to the other obstacle to the serious treatment of\nbirth fantasies, which lies in the difficulty of imagining that we can\nhave any memory of our own individual birth, the author falls\nback on the admittedly vague concepts of 'organismic mind' and\n'organismic memory', which he holds can produce fantasies which\nhave a rough but real resemblance to the actual biological facts of\nthe birth process, even though the symbolism makes use of the\nmost varied elements of experience from later life. In judging\nthis position we must remember that Jung has insisted upon the\nexistence of psychic 'archetypes' and that Freud held, though\nperhaps more hesitatingly, a similar view as regards certain primal\nfantasies\u2014both of which were supposedly independent of what\nwe ordinarily recognize as individual memories and which might\nseem to be mediated by what might not unreasonably be called\norganismic mind. We recognize that anatomical and physiological\ndevelopment both in man and animals is determined by hereditary\nor 'organismic' tendencies, that reflex and instinctive behaviour is\nsimilarly determined, but we boggle at the notion of conscious\nideas (as distinct from conative tendencies) having a parallel origin.\nIf Jung is right (not that Dr Fodor makes any appeal to Jung) this\nattitude is unjustified, and if we grant that fantasies may some-\ntimes be determined by what we might broadly term racial\nmemories, then there is a fortiori also a case for some dim kind of\nmemory underlying birth and uterine fantasies, for they at least\ncorrespond to events or states which have undoubtedly occurred\nin the individual life, even though they belong to a period usually\ncovered by the deepest infantile amnesia. What is badly needed\nhere is some attempt to correlate the nature or vividness of natal\nor prenatal fantasies with the actual individual history of birth or\ngestation. Some thirty years ago the present reviewer (in The\nPsycho-Analytic Study of the Family, 1921) suggested a line of\nresearch which might possibly throw light upon the subject, but\nin the interval neither he nor any other investigator has been\nenterprising enough to face the difficulties (including the difficulty\nof incredulity) involved. At least two cases mentioned by Dr\nFodor appear to show the existence of such a correlation : the\nfirst, a patient whose (neurotic) pains in the navel were associated\n\fReviews 685\nwith a clumsy tying of the umbihcal cord, the second that of a\npatient whose nightmares of stranghng were connected with the\nfact that she was born with the cord tightly wound round her neck.\nIn both these cases the patients had been told of these conditions\nattending their birth, and this subsequent information may have\nbeen the sole factor in producing the mental phenomena observed ;\non the other hand it may just possibly have acted merely as a\nreinforcing agent, and taken as a whole Dr Fodor's data certainly\nstrengthen the case for taking the 'birth trauma' seriously, what-\never may be its origin, and for studying it by all methods which\nmay be available.\nNot content with the fantasies of birth and of the prenatal state,\nDr Fodor goes further in suggesting what he calls fantasies of the\npre-maternal state and the trauma of conception. In some of\nwhat he says under this heading he was interestingly anticipated\nby Herbert Silberer who in igiz (Jahrbuch fur Psychoanalytische\nund Psychopathologische Forschiingen, iv, 141) called attention to\nthe occurrence of 'spermatozoa dreams', which he thought might\nsymbolise a desire for impregnation (the dreamer had a knowledge\nof biology) but which also, according to him, involved a desire for\n'infinite regression', including return to the father's body, much\nas in some of Dr Fodor's interpretations (though the latter author\ndoes not actually refer to this anticipation of his views). Dr Fodor\nis no more afraid of facing an element of mysticism than was\nSilberer in an earlier psycho-analytic generation, though he admits\nthat such pre-maternal fantasies (insofar as they are anything\nmore than mere biologically interpreted fantasies expressing the\ncommon idea of life before conception or incarnation) 'must be so\nalien to our comprehension as to defy all attempts at verbal\nexpression. In feelings we may rise into it [pre-maternal exis-\ntence] but we may not be able to translate this feeling into know-\nledge. ... As to the reality of such existence science has nothing\nto offer' (p. 94).\nThere are various other aspects of the present work (the several\nchapters of which originally appeared in article form in various\nperiodicals between 1942 and 1951) which are of interest primarily\nto the psycho-analyst or psychopathologist. Among these is a\nvery striking account of some cases of long-persistent hysterical\ncolour blindness which yielded rapidly to psychological treatment.\nWe should mention, further, the author's interesting discussion\nof the unconscious significance of numbers, which is probably the\nmost complete which has yet been attempted. The contrast\nbetween the conscious (or perhaps we should say 'realistic')\nmathematical treatment of numbers which are regarded as entirely\nabstract and the unconscious treatment which immediately invests\n\f686 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nthem with some concrete meaning (often of a 'magical' and\nextremely fantastic kind) is here particularly impressive and is\nwell calculated to bring out the special peculiarities of 'autistic\nthinking' (e.g. i5 = house or home, because 15 minutes = a quarter\nof an hour, and 'quarters) = living quarters, (p. 218) ; or again, in\nwhat the author calls the 'evocation of the undreamt', when the\nsignificant number may, for example, be obtained by subtraction,\nas when '24 and 100' = 'independence', because 100-24 = 76, and\n1776 is the date of the Declaration of Independence (though the\nfigure 76 itself never enters consciousness), (p. 348).\nAs the author says, 'logically or illogically the unconscious may\nstop at nothing in search of meaning' (p. 263), and he reminds us\nin this connection of the one-time humorous description of the\nsexologist Baron Schrenck von Notzing as 'Baron Shrink from\nNotzing (nothing)'. Some interesting examples are given of such\nunconscious processes which have found their way into the\nconscious mind and there become superstitions which have exer-\ncised a potent influence on belief and behaviour. This raises the\ndisquieting question how far psycho-analytic or parapsychological\ninterpretations (including some of the author himself) may repre-\nsent similar irruptions of the unconscious into our would-be\nscientific attitudes and findings. The question has to be faced,\nbut should not deter us from a due scientific regard for the real\ninfluence of the unconscious on many (we hardly know yet how\nmany) of the difficult problems with which psychical research is\nconcerned.\nI\nJ. C. Flugel\nThe Greeks and the Irrational. By E. R. Dodds. Berkeley\nand Los Angeles, University of California Press ;\nLondon,\nCambridge University Press, 1951. ix, 327 pp. 37s. 6d.\nThe purpose of this book, which is the outcome of lectures\ndelivered in 1949 at Berkeley, California, is to consider whether\nthe Greeks were 'in fact quite so blind to the importance of non-\nrational factors in man's experience and behaviour as is commonly\nassumed both by their apologists and by their critics'. The\nauthor's conclusion is that they were not. The book should be\nconsidered primarily as a contribution to classical scholarship,\nand has little direct bearing on the problems of modern psychical\nresearch, but there is much in it that will interest the student of\nthese problems.\nA chapter on 'The Blessings of Madness' includes a discussion\non 'Prophetic Madness' as exemplified by the Pythian priestess at\nDelphi, into whom, it was alleged, the God Apollo entered and\n\f1952] Reviews 687\nused her vocal organs in the same way that 'the so-called \"control\"\ndoes in modern spirit mediumship', and there is also (p. 71) an\naccount of 'belly-talkers'. It would appear that these people went\ninto trance during which a hoarse 'belly-voice', assumed to be that\nof a 'daemon', was heard issuing from their lips. The analogy\nwith the 'direct voice' of modern days is obvious.\nIn the chapter on 'Dream-Pattern and Culture-Pattern' Pro-\nfessor Dodds explains (p. 103) that he is mainly concerned not\nwith the dream-experience of the Greeks, but with their attitude\nto dream-experience, but he points out that we may have to reckon\nwith variations in the character of the experience itself : 'In many\nprimitive societies there are types of dream-structure which\ndepend on a socially transmitted pattern of belief, and cease to\noccur when that belief ceases to be entertained'. He quotes a\nstatement by Jung that a medicine-man had confessed to him that\n'he no longer had any dreams, for they had the District Commis-\nsioner now instead'. The chapter includes an account of the\nvarious methods, mainly incubation, used to induce 'divine', that\nis, significant dreams, as opposed to non-significant dreams. The\npractice of incubation still persists among the Greek peasants of\ntoday. The Hippocratic treatise On Regimen (p. 119) relates many\ndreams to the physiological state of the dreamer, which they\nexpress in symbolic form. Although the fourth-century author's\ninterpretation of these symbols would not be accepted today, it is\ninteresting to find him to this extent foreshadowing Freud, whom\nhe also anticipates in accepting 'the principle that the dream is\nalways egocentric'.\nIn Appendix I on 'Maenadism' there is an account of the\nOreibasia, the mountain dance, which seems to have originated as\na means of inducing religious experience and ecstasy ;\ndancing\nas a means to this end has many parallels. 'The ritual oreibasia\nat a fixed date may have originally developed out of spontaneous\nattacks of mass hysteria. By canalising such hysteria in an organ-\nised rite once in two years, the Dionysiac cult kept it within bounds\nand gave it a relatively harmless outlet' (p. 272).\nAppendix II contains an account of Theurgy, about which much\nis still obscure. The practice would seem, however, to have\ninvolved in some cases the employment of a trance medium.\nSometimes the trance would be a light one, the medium's conscious-\nness still persisting ; sometimes it would be deep, resembling\napparently the trance observed in Mrs Piper's mediumship.

He notes the signs of maturity in parapsychologi-\ncal experimentation and its consequent increasing technicality.\nOf future trends, he prophesies increasing use of spontaneous cases\nfor giving fresh orientation in experimental work and increased\nintegration with neurophysiological and biological researches.\nMrs Rhine, in an article on 'Conviction and Associated Condi-\ntions in Spontaneous Cases', points out some of the differences\nbetween spontaneous cases of psi knowing and the experimental\nresults of card-guessing experiments, particularly the fact that the\nformer are very often accompanied by a conviction that the per-\ncipient knows that the experience he is getting is giving him\ninformation about a real event.\nAn article on 'ESP Performance and Target Sequence' by\nS. G. Soal and J. G. Pratt contains an account of a new analysis of\na series of 33,500 ESP trials by Mrs Stewart in which the attempt\nis made to discover whether there is any relationship between\nsuccess and the pattern of target sequences. Highly significant\nrelationships were found.\nProfessor Broad reviews a symposium by three philosophers on\nthe relevance of psychical research to philosophy. He agrees that\nphilosophers may make a useful contribution to parapsychology by\nanalysing its terminology, but suggests that they should prepare\nthemselves for this task by a careful study of the relevant literature.\nVol. 15, No. 4, December 1951.\nIn an article on 'The Present Outlook on the Question of Psi\nin Animals', Professor Rhine makes a wide and well-documented\nstudy of the research done in this field and of its unsolved problems.\nHe deals with investigations that are being made of migratory and\nhoming behaviour in birds, and of experimental work on homing in\nmice. He also points to the very considerable body of evidence on\nspontaneous homing behaviour in dogs and cats, and the still more\npuzzling cases of trailing behaviour in which families have travelled\nto a distance by car or train and found that their pets which were\nleft behind have turned up at their new homes.\n\fr\n1952] Reviews 689\n^ In an article on 'Introversion-Extraversion Ratings in Relation\nto Scores in ESP Tests', Dr Betty Humphrey finds a significant\ni\ndifference between the psi scoring of those who are rated as\n'\nextraverts by the Bernreuter Personality Inventory and those who\nare rated as introverts, the former scoring positively and the latter\nnegatively. It would be interesting to know whether this is an\nintrinsic difference in introverted subjects or whether it is deter-\nmined by the personality type of the experimenter. It is possible\nthat an introverted experimenter might find that his introverts\nscored positively and his extraverts negatively.\nA minor article by Paul and Christiane Vasse compares the\nI\nscoring rate of these two experimenters in PK tests. C.V.\nshowed significant positive effects while P.V. scored at chance\nlevel. A previous study had suggested that C.V. was successful\nin influencing the rate of germination of seeds while P.V. was less\nso.\nIn 'An Experimental Study of ESP Capacity in Mental Patients'\nby K. E. Bates and Marietta Newton, it is reported that although\nco-operative patients scored better than those who were non-\nco-operative, there were no significant differences found between\npatients suffering from different mental disorders. The experi-\nment seems to have been of somewhat defective design since\ndifferences were calculated only between total scores of different\nclasses of patients, instead of separate patients being treated as\nindividuals in a contingency table.\nThis number of the Journal concludes with 'Reflections on\nParapsychology, Psycho-analysis, and Atomic Physics' by Professor\nP. Jordan, the German physicist, and a review by Professor\nDucasse of Mr Moncrieff's book The Clairvoyant Theory of\nPerception.\nVol. 16, No. i, March 1952.\nThe Editorial by Professor Rhine is a discussion of the present\nposition of our knowledge about dowsing. It contains an inform-\native account of experimental work in the past with valuable\nsuggestions of how it may be made more fruitful in the future.\n}\nEsther Foster gives an account of ESP experiments in which\n'\n(as in guessing playing cards) there is more than one aspect of the\ntarget object on which success can be obtained. The problem is\nwhether there is a tendency in successful experiments to score\nseparately on the different aspects or whether success means that\nthe card is guessed right as a whole. In most experiments it\nappears that the card is guessed right as a whole, but there are\nindications in one experiment that the subject may be more\nsuccessful in some aspects than in others.\n\f690 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nAn address on 'Thought Transference and Related Phenomena*\ngiven by R. H. Thouless to the Royal Institution in 1950 is\nreprinted from the Proceedings of the Royal Institution.\nA minor article of great interest and importance is contributed\nby Miss E. A. G. Knowles on a psi effect obtained in stopping a\nmanually operated random selector in a determined position when\nthe apparatus is not seen by the operator. She points out that this\nis an operation of a different character from that ordinarily\ncovered by the term P K, and suggests that it should be provision-\nally labelled PD (psi dexterity). She also points out that PD may\nenter into success with dice when these are thrown manually.\nA placement PK experiment by H.

He makes a\nsix-part appeal to members of the A.S.P.R. which our own\nmembers would do well to heed : (\ni\n) To record every spontaneous\ncase that comes their way ; (2) to take part in home experiments ;\n(3) to contribute financially ; (4) to let others know about the aims\nand work of the Society ; (5) to come to meetings or form Study\nGroups ; (6) '. . . you can always ask questions which will put a\nbee in our bonnet .... There is nothing more glib, more garrulous,\nand more hopeless than a research man who thinks he can get\nalong without other people's suggestions. It is a completely\nnonsensical idea. . . . What we research people want is to be\nunderstood, to be helped ... to be criticized. We want to be told\nwhat we should do that we are not doing, and told how we should\ndo it. If you know of sensitives, if you know of methods, if you\nknow of problems, let us hear about them ; let's find a way.\nLet's do the best we can do in a group enterprise.'\nJ. L. Woodruft' and Mrs L. A. Dale present a report on a study\nof the relationship between ESP function and the psychogalvanic\nresponse. The results were disappointing.\nW. H. W. Sabine stresses the value of reports of spontaneous\nprecognition. He suggests that selected remarkable cases 'will\nnot help so much in its study as a number of cases, however\ntrivial the circumstances, which have happened to the same\n\f1952] Correspondence 691\nindividual, provided always that he is capable of exact observation\nand narration.'\nAn elaborate PK research is being carried out by Dale and\nWoodruff using the rotating cage with camera with which\nProfessor Robert McConnell, of the Physics Department of the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, is said to have achieved spectacular\nresults.\nD. P.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Dieppe Raid Case\nSir,\u2014The statements made by D. and A. in The Dieppe Raid\nCase contain unusual features and are in certain respects\nambiguous.\n{a) Until A. had returned to the room (assuming A. was\nabsent from the room for 5 minutes) neither A. nor D. had men-\ntioned to the other the noises that they had heard for 15 minutes.\n{b) There is no conclusive evidence that A. continued to hear\nthose noises during the 5 minutes that she was absent from the\nroom. If she did not, what significance (if any) should attach\nthereto? There is no evidence that A. suddenly (or otherwise)\nceased to hear those noises upon leaving the room and suddenly\n(or otherwise) commenced to hear those noises upon returning to\nthe room. If she did, what significance (if any) should attach\nthereto ?\n(c) There is no conclusive evidence (apart from the fact that\nin their respective statements D. says that she had been listening\nto it 'for about 20 minutes' and A. says that she had been listening\nto it 'for about 15 minutes') whether D. continued to hear those\nnoises during the 5 minutes that A. was absent from the room.\n{d) There is no evidence (apart from the fact that in her state-\nment D. says that 'A. said she had also been listening to it for about\n20 minutes') whether D. or A. (and at what time) first mentioned\nto the other the length of time that D. or A. had heard those\nnoises.\n{e) Although A. in her statement says that she had been\nlistening to the noises 'for about 15 minutes' D. in her statement\nsays that 'A. said she had also been listening to it for about 20\nminutes'. When did A. make this observation to D.?\n(\/) If it is correct that D. and A. had heard those noises for\n20 minutes and 15 minutes respectively, before A. left the room,\nhow is the discrepancy of 5 minutes accounted for?\n\f69a Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\n(g) Since it is not known for how long D. had been awake, D.\nmay have been mistaken when she says that she 'woke up before\nit started'. While A. suggests (unless her awakening and the\ncommencement of the noises were coincidental) that she (A.) was\nawakened by such noises, it may be (although such noises may\nhave commenced in the sense that had A. been awake she would\nhave recognised them) that she was not.\n(h) Is there any evidence that D. and A. (alone or jointly) had\nrecently attended a film of, or discussed with others, the Dieppe\nlanding, or some other subject that might be suggestive thereof?\nWhether such evidence is, or is not, available, it is apparent from\nthe nature of the statements made by D. and A. and from the fact\nthat D. and A. occupied the same room, when they heard those\nnoises, that collaboration cannot be excluded.\nDenis Chesters\nSir,\u2014The Dieppe Raid Case, investigated by G. W. Lambert and\nKathleen Gay, must recall to the minds of many the case of An\nAdventure, in which also anonymity was, at the outset, preferred\nby the percipients. In both cases the hallucinatory experience\noccurred to two English ladies while on a holiday in France. Both\ndates were in the month of August, and on a Saturday (August 10,\n1901, and August 4, i95i).The Dieppe Raid case was, indeed,\nalmost on the fiftieth anniversary of the Trianon one. In both\ncases additional experiences were reported by one only of the per-\ncipients : Mrs Dorothy Norton in the one case. Miss Jourdain in\nthe other.\nA less obvious but very important point of resemblance arises\nout of the possession by Mrs Dorothy Norton and Miss Agnes\nNorton of a guide book entitled Dieppe. Mr Lambert appears to\nhave shown satisfactorily that the information about the raid in this\nguide book could account for but a small part of the knowledge\nevinced by the percipients in their statements ; and moreover they\nsaid they had not read the book before the experience started.\nNone the less, it is undeniable that the word 'Dieppe' is alone\nsufficient to suggest to the mind of any English person the famous\nraid of August 19, 1942.\nMiss Moberly and Miss Jourdain, the percipients in the Trianon\ncase, also had a guide book\u2014Baedeker's Paris. Turning to the\ndescription of the Petit Trianon, the actual scene of their 'Adven-\nture,' in the 1900 edition, we read : 'A visit should be paid\nto the Jardin du Petit Trianon, which is laid out in the English\nstyle and contains some fine exotic trees, an artificial lake, a\n'Temple of Love', and a 'Hamlet' of nine or ten rustic cottages,\nwhere the court ladies played at rustic life.' ,\n...\n\f1952] Correspondence 693\nWhen the eye of the EngUsh-speaking reader hghts on the word\n'Hamlet' (so printed), it is apt to suggest to him the tragedy,\nalthough a moment later he realises that the celebrated Hameau\nis intended. But an image of Hamlet has been called up, however\nfleetingly, a picture of the solitary and melancholy man in con-\njunction with the 'Temple of Love.' These images may well\naccount for the sinister cloaked figure which Miss Moberly and\nMiss Jourdain believed they had seen sitting close to the pillared\nkiosk.\nThat which is suggested by the word 'Dieppe' to two modern\nyoung Englishwomen who know what the sounds of war are, and\nthat which is suggested by the words 'Temple of Love' and\n'Hamlet' to two middle-aged spinsters of the year 1901 are, beyond\nall question, very different. But is there not an indication of the\nsame principle lying behind their respective hallucinations? May\nwe not have in both cases illustrations of the power of the mind to\nbe cognisant of the contents of books and other sources of infor-\nmation which have not yet been seen, and, under rare and excep-\ntional circumstances, to share this experience with another and\nbring it to consciousness by means of a visual or auditory hallucin-\nation or both?\nI am well aware that Miss Moberly and Miss Jourdain displayed\na sad ignorance of psychical research, scarcely excusable in women\nof their opportunities ; but their severest critics may see in the\nexperience of Mrs and Miss Norton some reason to reconsider\nwhether the Trianon case did not have, at the outset, a genuinely\nparanormal basis.\nIt may also be thought desirable to enquire whether the per-\ncipients in the Dieppe Raid Case have ever read An Adventure or\nextracts from it.\nW. H. W. Sabine\nMr G. W. Lambert writes :\nThe Editor has shown me the above letters with the authors'\npermission, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make the\nfollowing observations.\nMr Chesters is quite right in calling attention to a discrepancy\nbetween D.'s and A.'s statements as to the earliest phase of the\nexperience. I noticed the discrepancy and asked the percipients\nquestions with a view to resolving it but was not entirely success-\nful. The discrepancy is unsatisfactory, but relates to a period of\ntime which is small (5 minutes, at the outside) and is not of crucial\nimportance, considering the margin of inaccuracy one must allow\nfor in judging how long one has been awake in the dark before\nlooking at the time.\n\f694 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [JULY\nIn the course of my questioning I ascertained\n(1) that the percipients took the time from their respective\nwrist-watches, which had not got luminous dials. It is to be\ninferred, therefore, that neither knew the time was 4.20 a.m. till\nthe light was turned on. It is clear that the light was not turned\non till A. returned to the room. I therefore inferred that D.\nheard the noise start at 4.20 a.m. minus 20 minutes\u2014but this\n20 minutes is necessarily a guess and, for all one can know, it may\nhave been 3.47 or so, when (on 19 August 1942) the firing started,\nor some minutes after 4 a.m.\n(2) that A. did (quite certainly) hear the noise while she was\nout of the room, just as she continued to hear it out on the balcony\nlater on. (I was concerned to discover whether A.'s hearing of\nthe noise was dependent on the close physical presence of D.;\napparently it was not). I made no attempt in the report to draw\nout the full significance of the incident. I did not ask D. whether,\nduring A.'s absence from the room, she also continued to hear\nthe noises, but it is tolerably certain that she did.\nThe above supplementary information goes a long way to\nanswer the points {a) to {g). It means that the time '4.20 a.m.'\nfrom the beginning of D.'s statement cannot be taken as exact,\nas she did not know the time was 4.20 till the light was turned on\n20 minutes later. The existence of the discrepancy between the\nstatements at this point is tantalizing, but is rather strong evidence\nagainst the theory of collaboration.\nAs to point [h), neither D. nor A. was 'interested' in the Dieppe\nraid, and had neither 'read it up' nor had it brought forcibly to\nher attention shortly before the experience. The possibility of\ncollaboration in making up the whole story cannot be excluded,\nany more than can the possibility of 'faking' in what purports to\nhave been a scientific experiment of a kind that cannot easily be\nrepeated. The good faith of the percipients must either be\naccepted or not. In this case the investigators, who are not\nwithout experience in these matters, have more than usually full\ninformation affording grounds for accepting the good faith of the\npercipients.\nIn his very interesting comparison of the Dieppe Raid Case with\nthe Trianon case of 1901, Mr Sabine asks whether the percipients\nin the former case had ever read An Adventure or extracts from it.\nMrs Norton (D.), on being asked whether she had read that book,\ndid not recognize the title, but, when Versailles was mentioned, had\na vague recollection of it. She seemed to know the outline of the\nstory, without any detail. It is, of course, possible that her uncon-\nscious memory of the Trianon case is much fuller than her conscious\n\fr\n1952] Correspondence 695\nrecollection of it. But if the earlier case played any important\npart in suggesting the 'framework' of the later case, it is surprising\nthat the later experience was not a visual hallucination, like the\nTrianon case, and like the earlier experiences of Mrs Norton her-\nself, before her visit to the Dieppe neighbourhood. I would judge\nthat both percipients had enough normally acquired knowledge\nof the Dieppe Raid, and experience, acquired doing the war, of\nnoises made by guns, shells, etc., to 'explain' the occasion and gen-\neral content of the experience of the 4th August, 1951, and that it is\nhardly necessary to call in aid forgotten details of the Trianon case.\nWhat the memory of past reading or experience cannot explain in\nthe Dieppe Raid Case is the time coincidence factor which\ncharacterized an abnormal experience (prolonged auditory hallucin-\nation) unique in the lives of both percipients. If one admits that\nany feature of the experience came ab extra, where is one to draw\nthe line?\nESP AS Guesswork\nSir,\u2014When Mr Flew first put forward his suggestion about\nESP and guesswork I failed to see the connexion, and his recent\nletter to the Journal does not make it any clearer. Certainly the\nprocess of 'guessing' deserves psychological study. It has long\nbeen realized that guesses do not come mysteriously out of the\nblue in strictly random fashion. In card-calling tests most\nsubjects change their call from one trial to the next more fre-\nquently than occurs in a chance series, and every subject has his\nown symbol preferences and sequence habits. While it would\nbe interesting to know the inner reasons for these habits, it is\ndifficult to see how such knowledge could help towards an\nunderstanding of ESP.\nIn a succesful ESP test, there is a correlation between cards\nand calls which shows that one of the associations available to\nthe subject, and effective in determining his choices, is the target\norder. No amount of knowledge of the ordinary associations\nI\nwhich influence choices seems likely to explain how the concealed\nj\ntarget becomes available to the subject.\n[\nThe same consideration applies to spontaneous cases. It is\ninteresting to know, for example, that a dream of a relative's death\nis due to unconscious hate, but this in no way explains the fulfil-\nment of such a dream. Unlike Mr Flew, Freud seems to have\nI\nbeen well aware of this when he put forward the theory that\nmediums are telepathically sensitive especially to the repressed\ncomplexes of their clients.\nI\nD.

C. Wallwork\nThe intention in performing these experiments was to discover\nwhether it is possible to distinguish between correct and incorrect\nESP calls by changes in the electrical activity of the brain of the\npercipient. If such a distinction could be made, it would not\nonly give some insight into the ESP process, but it might enable\na weak ESP faculty to be detected without the necessity for\ncarrying out a large number of experiments for the application of\nstatistical methods. It is reasonable to suppose that a call which\nis correct by chance would be accompanied by a similar type of\nbrain activity to that of an incorrect call, but one which is correct\nby genuine ESP faculty might be accompanied by a different\ntype of activity. If these two types of brain activity could be\nunambiguously distinguished, then every single ESP hit could\nbe detected.\nAs soon as a few preliminary runs had been completed, it was\nrealized that it would be very unlikely that any unambiguous dif-\nference could be recognized on the EEG record between ESP\nhits and misses. These runs were, nevertheless, very instructive\nand served as a guide to further experiments, so the procedure\nwill be described briefly.\nThe percipient generally wore four pairs of electrodes, two in\nfronto-parietal and two in temporo-occipital positions, and the\npotentials developed across each pair were recorded on separate\nchannels on the EEG. The tests were carried out under GESP\nconditions, using a home-made pack of twenty-five cards contain-\ning five of each of the symbols O, L, S, V, Z. As each card was\nexposed by the agent, he tapped with a pencil directly on to the\nEEG record in a position close to the recording pens, thereby\nmaking a mark which synchronised the card exposure with the\nrecord of brain activity. The tap could be heard by the per-\n697\n\f698 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [NOVEMBER\ncipient in an adjacent room through an open communicating\nhatch, but percipient and agent were not visible to each other.\nOn hearing the tap, the percipient made his guess at the target\ncard.\nThree methods of recording the guesses were tried. In the\nfirst, the percipient wrote them down himself while in a semi-\nreclining position and with his eyes open. This method was\nrejected because regular, large-potential jumps, particularly in the\ntemporo-occipital channels, indicated that movement of the eyes\nafter the recording of each guess was causing interfering muscle\npotentials. In the second method, the percipient indicated his\nguess by depressing one of five keys on a key-board, so causing\nthe illumination of the corresponding symbol in a box watched\nby the experimenter. Unfortunately, electrical interference from\nthe keyboard completely obliterated the EEG record, and this\nmethod was abandoned also, though the interference might have\nbeen overcome by screening the keyboard. The third method,\nwhich was adopted for all subsequent experiments, was simply\nthat the percipient spoke his guesses softly from a reclining\nposition with eyes closed and with the minimum of muscle move-\nment, while the experimenter recorded the guesses. These softly-\nspoken calls could not be heard by the agent in the adjacent room\nbecause of the background noise made by the mechanism of the\nEEG.\nIt was soon found that there was no obvious change in the\nEEG pattern at any point in a GESP run, and it could no longer\nbe expected that any prominent feature could be associated with\neither a correct or an incorrect ESP call. It should be mentioned\nhere that the percipient had shown significant results in previous\nGESP tests. Table 2 {a) shows the results of all the tests carried\nout under GESP conditions with the same agent during the first\nthree months of experiments with this percipient. From the\nESP point of view, the experimental methods and conditions\nwere the same as for the EEG experiments, except that the agent\nand percipient were seated at separate tables in the same room in\nsuch a way that the percipient could not see the agent and the\nagent could only see the back of the percipient. Also, in some of\nthe experiments, ESP instead of letter cards were used, but in\nall cases they were in 'closed packs' of twenty-five cards. After\nthis significant series of tests, there had been an interval of about\ntwo months before any further GESP experiments had been\ncarried out, and when they were resumed no further significant\nscores were obtained. The EEG experiments were therefore\ncommenced at a time when good scores could not be expected.\nNevertheless, it was reasonable to suppose that the percipient\n\f1952] ESP Experimenfs with EEG Recordings 699\nwould still be capable of making at least an occasional correct\nguess by ESP.\nIt was then considered that a more sensitive test for extra-\nsensory communication between agent and percipient might be\nthe recognition of similar trends in the EEG records made from\nboth persons at the same time. Such similarities might be detect-\nable even if differentiating features could not be found in the\nrecord from the percipient alone. This possibility was tested by\ntaking simultaneous records from both percipient and agent, eacla\nwearing two pairs of electrodes in posterior positions and feeding\ninto the four channels of the one machine. No obvious similarity\nbetween the two sets of records could be found at any point.\nThe conditions were not good, however, because the agent had\nhis eyes open and both he and the percipient were in a sitting\nposition.\nAfter these preliminar}^ experiments, a different procedure was\nadopted, for the suggestion of which the author is indebted to Dr\nJ. R. Smythies. The electrode arrangement and the method of\nconducting these experiments were the same as in those already\ndescribed in which the percipient and agent were in adjacent\nrooms. The agent recorded the order of the target cards on a\nscore sheet which was kept separate from the experimenter's list\nof the percipient's calls until the experiment was over. Before\ncomparing the calls with the target cards, the EEG record was\nexamined for the extent of alpha-rhythm. Each period during\nwhich a card had been exposed was rated as 'strong alpha',\n'average alpha', or 'weak alpha', on the basis of the previous\nr';Cords made by the percipient. A more quantitative rating could\nI >l be carried out because a wave-analyser was not available, but\nis qualitative classification was made by Mr E. G. Williams, the\n2ctro-encephalograph technician, assisted by the agent and the\n...perimenter. Only after this examination was complete were\nthe guesses and target cards compared and the positions of correct\nand incorrect calls correlated with the EEG.\nThis correlation was carried out as follows. Of the total number\nof periods during which cards had been exposed, the fractions\nhaving each of the three ratings were found. These fractions\nrepresent the probabilities of any one guess being associated with\n'strong alpha' or 'average alpha' or 'weak alpha' activity. Also, the\nnumber of hits and the number of misses associated with each\ntji^pe of activity were found. By comparing these with the total\nX^-mbers of hits and misses, they are converted into the propor-\n-j,)n of hits with each rating and the proportion of misses with\neach rating.\nIf there were no correlation between success and alpha-rhythm\n\fyoo Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nactivity, these two proportions should be the same for each type\nof rating, or the difference between the proportions should be\nzero. This difference is not usually zero, and to test whether it -\nis significant it is compared with the standard error of the differ-\nence, calculated from the formula Jpq{ijn-^ + ijn.2). Here, p is 1\nthe probability of a guess being associated with the particular\ntype of activity under consideration (found as described above),\nq is the probability of its not being so associated and is there- ,\nfore equal to (i -p), is the total number of hits, and the :\ntotal number of misses. The ratio of the difference between\nthe proportions to the standard error of the difference is the ]\ncritical ratio which is the measure of the significance of the differ- I\nence. To be indicative of a definite tendency for hits to be\nassociated with one particular type of alpha-rhythm activity, the 1\ncritical ratio must be at least three. This analysis has been carried\nout for + 1 (precognitive) and - i (postcognitive) hits as well as i\nfor o hits on the actual target card, and the results are shown in\nTable i.\nFrom the small values of the critical ratios it is clear that no\ncorrelation has been found between the distribution of hits and\nthe variation of alpha-rhythm activity in the brain of the per-\ncipient. Unfortunately, the analysis of scores shows that these\nexperiments are also insignificant from the ESP point of view.\nThis is probably due largely to the general decline in scores shown\nby the percipient, but it may also be due partly to bad ESP\nconditions caused by the discomfort of wearing the electrodes.\nA comparison of the scores in this series of experiments with the\nGESP scores in the previous significant series of experiments^\nwith the same agent is shown in Table 2. is\nBecause of the insignificance of the ESP scores in these expend\nments with the EEG, it is impossible at the moment to sst\nwhether there is any correlation between the correctness of lAi\nESP call and the nature or extent of electrical activity of the\nbrain of the percipient at the time when the call is made. It is\nhoped, therefore, that it will be possible to repeat these experi-\nments with other percipients.\nThe author would like to thank Mr J. Parsons for being a very\nco-operative percipient under rather trying experimental condi-\ntions and Mr R. B. Joynson, Lecturer in Psychology at Notting-\nham University, for advice and assistance. Thanks are also due\nto Dr D. Macmillan, Physician Superintendent of Mapperley\nHospital, Nottingham, for permission to use the electro-ence-\nphalograph, and to Mr E. G.

Lossky\nProfessor C. D. Broad, in his article 'The Relevance of Psychical\nResearch to Philosophy', writes as follows : 'To sum up about\nthe implications of the various kinds of paranormal cognition. I\nhave the impression that we should do well to consider much\nmore seriously than we have hitherto been inclined to do the type\nof theory which Bergson put forward in connection with normal\nmemory and sense perception. The suggestion is that the func-\ntion of the brain and nervous system and sense organs is in the\nmain eliminative and not productive.'^\nWhile fully agreeing with Professor Broad, I should like to put\nforward some suggestions as to the kind of philosophical system\nwhich would render explicable the facts of extrasensory percep-\ntion established beyond all doubt by modern research. It seems\nto me that these facts can be best explained on the basis of meta-\nphysical personalism combined with an intuitive theory of know-\nledge, i.e. with the doctrine that we directly perceive not only our\nown mental states, but objects of the external world-as well.^\nPersonalism is the theory that the world consists of actual and\npotential individual centres of consciousness. A well-known\ninstance of personalism is the philosophy of Leibniz, according\nto whom even atoms\u2014or, we should now say, electrons, protons,\netc.\u2014are monads or potential personalities. These elementary\nentities not only create material processes of attraction and repul-\nsion, but have inner experiences, unconscious psychoid processes\nwhich differ from psychic processes solely by their extreme\nsimplicity. Leibniz calls such entities 'sleeping monads'. Under\nthe influence of experience they develop and combine with one\nanother, forming atoms, molecules, unicellular and multicellular\norganisms. Their life thus becomes more and more complex, and\nat last they become actual personalities.\nEvery self is a supertemporal and superspatial entity, but it\nimparts to its feelings, strivings, and actions the form of time\n^ Philosophy, October 1949, p. 306.\n\"\nA short exposition of such a philosophical system is given in my\nHistory of Russian Philosophy (New York, International Universities\nPress, 1951), an English edition of which is to be published by Allen &\nUnwin early in 1953.\n\f1952] Extrasensory Perception and Psychokinesis 703\n(psychical or psychoid processes) or of both space and time\n(e.g. material processes of attraction, repulsion, movement,\netc.).i\nA supertemporal entity manifesting itself in time is called in\nphilosophy a substance. It is preferable to use the term 'sub-\nstantival agent', in order to emphasize its active character.\nLeibniz maintained that monads 'have neither doors nor win-\ndows', and that the being of each is entirely separate from that of\nothers. It is a mistake, however, to conceive of the world as\nbroken up into disconnected units. Every agent's manifestations\nare in accordance with the principles and mathematical ideas that\ndetermine the structure of time and space and are identical for all.\nAs bearers of identical formal principles of the world's structure,\nsubstantival agents or monads are consiibstantial with one another.\nThe founder of neo-Platonism, Plotinus, used an excellent meta-\nphor to illustrate this consubstantiality : he said that the human\nrace consists of a number of men who look in different directions\nbut are joined together at the backs of their heads. The consub-\nstantiality is of course only partial, but it constitutes such an\nintimate bond between substantival agents that each one's experi-\nences exist not for it alone, but, if only unconsciously, for all the\nothers, i.e. from the personalist standpoint, for the world as a\nwhole. This is of essential importance to epistemology. If I\ndirect intentional acts of awareness, attention, and discrimination\nupon an external object, it is cognized by me as it is in itself, and\nnot by means of subjective images, symbols, etc. Such direct\ncontemplation of objects as they actually are may be called\nintuition.\nIt will be said that if direct perception of external objects be a\nfact, there can be no need for us to have eyes, ears, and other\nsense organs. According to the theory worked out by Galileo,\nHobbes, and Descartes, stimulation of the sense organs is the\ncause which gives rise in our minds to the subjective image of an\nexternal object. Bergson rejected this causal theory of percep-\ntion : he maintained that physiological processes in the sense\norgans and the cortex do not create the perception, but are merely\na stimulus inciting us to direct attention to the actual external\nobject that has impinged upon our body and may be harmful or\nuseful to us. Unfortunately Bergson's intuitivism did not go far\nenough : he did not regard all cognitive acts as intuitive. Scien-\ntific knowledge expressible in rational concepts was for him, as\nfor Kant, a subjective construct of our reason and not contempla-\ntion of reality. He thought that in addition to the activity of\n^ See my article 'The Absolute Criterion of Truth' in the Review of\nMetaphysics, June 1949.\n\f704 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [NOVEMBER\nreason we also have a faculty of intuition as the contemplation\nof creative living reality not expressible in rational notions.\nFor fifty years I have been developing an integral theory of\nintuitivism, i.e. the theory that all cognitive acts are different\nkinds of intuition. ^ My book Sensuous, Intellectual and Mystical\nIntuitio?i is a detailed exposition of the view that sensory qualities\nof objects are not our subjective sensations, but properties of\nmaterial processes in the external world ; rational ideas\u2014e.g.\nmathematical truths\u2014are objects of intellectual intuition by means\nof which we contemplate the ideal aspect of the world\u2014the aspect\nowing to which the world is a system ;\nmystical intuition is the\nsource of religious experience. A theory of intuition based upon\nthe conception of the intimate bond between every self and the\nworld as a whole may be called a co-ordinational theory of percep-\ntion. On that theory the most ordinary sense perception, e.g.\nseeing a tree within ten yards of me, is a kind of clairvoyance :\nthe excitation of the eye and of the visual centres in the cortex\nis merely a stimulus for my self to perform an act of clairvoy-\nance in space. Bergson says that in the course of evolution sense\norgans have been developed for purposes of self-preservation,\nsignalling the appearance of an object which may be useful\nor harmful to us and inciting the self to direct its attention\nupon it.\nAccording to this view, every agent's characteristics and experi-\nences exist not only for it but, unconsciously, for all other entities\nin the world. Hence it follows that stimulation of sense organs is\nnot a necessary condition of perception. It is useful for the satis-\nfaction of our ordinary daily needs, but in certain important cases\nthe perception of objects remote from us in space may take place\nwithout the stimulation of the sense organs. Death, illness, or\ndanger threatening those dear to us affect us unconsciously even\nthough we be far apart, and, without any excitation of our sense\norgans, may serve as a stimulus for us to direct upon those events\nacts of awareness, attention, and discrimination.\nMany people possess the faculty of bringing into their field of\nconsciousness, without the help of sense organs, events of lesser\nmoment that are of practical use to them. For instance, when\nthey go to bed they decide to v\/ake up at a certain hour, and\nactually do so ;\nprobably this is due, in many cases, to an extra-\nsensory perception of the hands of the clock. Professor Rhine's\nexperiments have proved that even objects of no practical import-\n^ See my Intuitive Basis of Knozvledge (English translation published\nby Macmillan in 191 9), Sensuous, Intellectual and Mystical Intuition\n(English translation published by the Russian University of Prague,\n1934-8), and other books and articles.\n\f1952] Extrasetisory Perception and Psychokinesis 705\nance may be extrasensorily perceived if attention be concentrated\nupon them. Both extrasensory perception and precognition are\nexphcable on the assumption of the unconscious bond between\nthe human self and the world as a whole. They become intel-\nligible if we give up the causal theory of perception and adopt the\nco-ordinational, according to which even normal sense perception\nis a kind of clairvoyance.\nPrecognition does not imply that time is unreal and that there\nis no clear distinction between past, present, and future. We\ncontemplate past, present, and future as such because our self is\na supertemporal entity and therefore can direct its acts of intuition\nupon any section of time.\nThe co-ordinational theory of knowledge is incompatible with\nthe positivistic view of causality, according to which the cause of\nan event is the totality of events upon which it follows with neces-\nsity. The champions of this view have lost the true conception\nof causality, for they do away with the dynamic aspect of it and\nretain only the temporal sequence, putting main emphasis upon\nits regularity. A 'dynamic' theory of causality is more in keeping\nwith the facts of experience ; it is concerned with the creation of\nan event, and regards temporal sequence as a derivative aspect of\nthe creative act. Events do not arise in time of their own accord,\nbut are produced by someone. Having a temporal form, they fall\naway every instant into the domain of the past and are therefore\nincapable of creating the future ;\nonly a supertemporal sub-\nstantival agent can be the bearer of creative power manifesting\nitself in time. Of course, a substantival agent creates a new event\non the basis of his former and his present experiences. Hence it\nfollows that we must distinguish between cause in the strict sense\nof the term, and occasion : the cause, i.e. the creator of an event,\nis always some substantival agent, and the 'occasion' are the cir-\ncumstances in connexion with which an agent manifests its\ncreative power. Uniformity and necessity do not form part of\nthe idea of causality : no one has ever proved that an agent is\ncompelled with absolute necessity to repeat the same actions in\nsimilar circumstances. The possibility of science does not in the\nleast require uniformity of causation : it is sufficient that events\nshould arise with a certain amount of regularity. In the lower\nkingdoms of nature, studied by physics and inorganic chemistry,\nthis regularity reaches a considerable degree of uniformity and can\nbe expressed by statistical lazvs.\nOn this view of causality there is no need for us to account for\nprecognition by the strange assumption that the future causally\naffects the present : the future simply provides the occasion for\nus to direct an act of perception upon it. The co-ordinational\n\f7o6 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [NOVEMBER\ntheory of knowledge leads to the conclusion that extrasensory per-\nception in all its varieties does not essentially differ from normal\nsense perception, because in normal perception the activity of the\nsense organs is only of secondary importance.\nLet us now consider the problem of psychokinesis, and, to\nbegin Vv'ith, ask the general question as to whether psychical pro-\ncesses can influence material processes. Take the simplest form\nof material process, e.g. repulsion between two entities. Repul-\nsion is only possible as push and counter-push made by two\nagents, say, electrons A and B, in such a way that these two\nactions arise absolutely simultaneously, have the same force, and\nare carried out along the same line in opposite directions. Such\nsimultaneous mutual determination of two objects is placed by\nKant in his table of categories next to causality as a special cate-\ngory of reciprocity [Wechsehvirkung). How are we to understand\nthe marvellous correspondence of the mutually opposed actions\nof the two electrons? In order to explain it, we must distinguish\nbetween the psychoid or psychical striving to make a particular\nact of repulsion in a definite direction, and the actual realizaticn\nof this striving as a material process in space. In the case of\nmutual repulsion of two agents A and B the initiative may be-\nlong to A, in the form of a striving to repulse B ; in virtue of\nthe agents' consubstantiality this striving is unconsciously experi-\nenced by B. If B reacts to it by a corresponding counter-striving,\nthe two agents may realize in space a miaterial process of mutual\nrepulsion with equal force along the same line in opposite\ndirections. Thus every mechanical process is psychoidly-mech-\nanical or, at a higher stage of development, psychically-mech-\nanical.\nThe dependence of material processes upon psychical in no way\nconflicts with the law of the conservation of energy. The only\nadmission to be made is that the increase, say, of repulsion in one\ndirection, required for a particular purpose, is accompanied by a\ndecrease of repulsion in other directions so that the quantity of\nenergy remains the same. To use Hartmann's terminology\n\u2014\nwithout having recourse to his conception of non-central forces\n\u2014\nit can be said that the influence of the psychical factor results in\nthe transference of energy from one co-ordinate of space to\nanother, where it is needed for our purpose. Besides, if the mani-\nfestations of an agent's energies depend upon its own psychic or\npsychoid states, it can be easily imagined that they may tempo-\nrarily cease altogether, and the corresponding energy may pass\nfrom actual to a potential state, or vice versa. This explains the\nslowing down and the re-starting of material processes discussed\nby Driesch.\n\f1952] Extrasensory Perception and Psychokinesis 707\nNor does the doctrine here expounded conflict with the law of\ninertia. According to this law a body can only change its state of\nrest or motion under the influence of some force external to it.\nIf an animate body could begin or cease to move, or change the\ndirection of its movement solely through wishing to do so, the\nlaw of inertia would be violated. Suppose that on hearing some\nnoise in the street I wanted to discover the cause of it, got up from\nmy chair, and walked to the window. If this change in the posi-\ntion of my body Vv'ere wholly determined from within, by my wish\nalone, this would certainly be contrary to the law of inertia. In\ntruth, however, we must distinguish between an inner striving to\nmake a movement\u2014a psychical or a psychoid process\u2014and the\nexternal realization of this striving, i.e. the material process of\nmovement. When I want to rise from my chair and go to the\nwindow, my striving to push my foot away from the floor is in-\ntensified, but if the floor did not offer a corresponding resistance,\nmy movement would not take place.\nThe law of entropy, on this view, must be limited, at any rate\nwith reference to vital processes in plant and animal organisms.\nTo see the reason for this, consider the action of the human self\nupon its body. By 'body' I mean here the totality of compara-\ntively undeveloped agents allied with a highly developed agent,\nthe human self, and serving its purposes as its organs. The\nhuman self embraces the life of its organism in one integral act of\nexperience, and is therefore able to co-ordinate the activity of the\ndifl:erent organs so that they work for one complex purpose and\nfor the good of the organism as a whole. Each cell of the organ-\nism, sympathetically participating in the life of the human self,\ncarries out the task assigned to it by the co-ordinative striving of\nthat self. Consequently the organism behaves purposively as a\nwhole, although many organs participate in its activities. With-\nout using any energy the human self transform.s chaotic move-\nments into orderly ones, giving them, for instance, the same\ndirection ;\nhence, vital processes often are of ectropic char-\nacter. In the words of Driesch, our self really is 'Maxwell's\ndemon'.\nSince a man's will is capable of influencing substantival agents\nwhich form part of his body, it is possible that in certain cases\nit also acts upon agents external to the body. They, too, are\nconsubstantial with the human self and therefore unconsciously\nexperience our strivings directed upon them ; and sometimes they\nmay comply with these strivings, or may react to them negatively.\nIn order to prove experimentally the influence of human will upon\nthe external world, we must direct our efforts of will upon potential\nor actual personalities. Such experiments may be carried out\n\fyoS Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nwith unicellular organisms ; this was done, for instance, by Mr\nNigel Richmond in his experiments with paramecia.^\nThe above considerations show that the metaphysics of per-\nsonalism combined with an intuitive theory of knowledge enable\nus to regard paranormal phenomena as essentially akin to normal\n:\nboth extrasensory and sensory perception are species of direct\ncontemplation of objects in the external world ; the action of our\nwill upon objects external to our body is explained in the same\nway as its normal action upon our own body.\nA totally different character must be ascribed to attempts of\ninfluencing by will not personalities but material things, such as\ndice. From the point of view of personalism a die consists of\npotential personalities\u2014atoms and molecules. But their combina-\ntion in the die is only an aggregate and not an organic whole\nheaded by a potential personality which could be influenced by\nour will. Accordingly, in this case we should have to exercise\ncommand over millions of agents constituting the die ; and it is\nextremely improbable that these millions should all together obey\nour will. If Professor Rhine's experiments prove that human will\ncan affect the fall of the dice, this fact would have to be explained\nin a different way than the influence of human will upon para-\nmecia. The following hypothesis might provide an explanation :\nthe effort of will directed upon the falling die may be accompanied\nby some sort of radiation proceeding from the body and acting\nupon the die just as the human hand would act in pushing it. In\nthat case a paranormal event would be analogous to the normal.\nJ. G. PIDDINGTON AND HIS WORK ON THE\n'CROSS-CORRESPONDENCE' SCRIPTS\nBy W. H. Salter\nBy the death in April of J. G.

He\nwas during his term of office closely concerned in two events of\nimportance to the Society ; first the creation in 1901 of the\nResearch Endowment Fund, of which he was for many years the\nactive Trustee ; and secondly the separation, after Richard\nHodgson's death in 1905, of the American Branch of the S.P.R.\nand its transformation into the present American Society. Pid-\ndington visited the United States and negotiated on behalf of the\nS.P.R. the financial and other arrangements consequent on the\nnew state of affairs.\nFrom 1917 to 1921 he was Hon. Treasurer. A successful\nbusiness man himself, he looked after the Society's finances with\nespecial care, nursing the Research Endowment Fund from very\nsmall beginnings, so that in due time it might produce an income\nsufficient to pay a salary for a full-time research officer with\nqualifications and status equivalent to those of a university\nresearch worker in any of the recognized branches of Science.\nThe income of the Fund grew indeed, but not, since the First\nWorld War, as fast as the value of money declined, so that fifty\nyears after the Fund was started the Society still lacks an endow-\nment sufficient to enable it to make the most of present possibilities\nof research.\nFor some years before the First War Piddington had been living\nat Woking as a near neighbour of G. W. Balfour, and by 1920 he\nhad come to reside at Balfour's house. Fisher's Hill, where both\nof them lived until after the outbreak of the Second War. Mrs\nSidgwick also made her home there about the same time, remain-\ning there until her death in 1936. So it came about that for the\nperiod between the end of the First War and the Society's Jubilee\nin 1932, three leading members of the Council, Mrs Sidgwick,\nG. W. Balfour, and Piddington were in close contact with each\nother, living for most of that period in the same house, and were\nthus well placed to give the Society the strong central direction\nwhich in those critical times it needed.\nCritical they were because the three principal founders of the\nSociety, Sidgwick, Myers, and Gurney, were all long since dead\nand had become mere names to a large portion of the membership.\nHodgson and Podmore, who had from early days been closely\nassociated with them, had died before the War, and during the\nWar the breakdown in Alice Johnson's health had compelled her\nto resign the post of Research Officer. The War had brought a\nlarge influx of new members, many of whom knew nothing of the\npast history of the Society or its standards of investigation, ap-\n\fyio Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [NOVEMBER\nproached some of our problems emotionally and uncritically, and\nwere easily beglamoured by reports of astounding successes\nobtained in mushroom institutions with grandiloquent titles.\nHow easily in such conditions spreads the complaint,\n'AH old, nothing new?\nOnly the usual talking through the mouth.\nOr writing by the hand? I own, I thought\nThis would develop, grow demonstrable.\nMake doubt absurd, give figures we might see.\nFlowers we might touch . . .\nThe Pennsylvanians gained such. . .\n.'\nHow seductive, even to persons with less excuse than Mr Sludge,\nthe example of Tennsylvania', or its twentieth-century counter-\nparts! Attempts were made, and not without influential backing,\nto force the S.P.R. on to a 'positive' doctrinal basis, to substitute\nshowmanship for research, and, failing all else, to split the Society,\nbut they all broke on the rock of Fisher's Hill.\nThere might be a risk in any society that so close a combination\nof Elder Statesmen would confine the society's activities to those\nin which the Elder Statesmen had a special interest. Nothing of\nthat sort happened with the Fisher's Hill group. Their own\ninterest was at this time centred on the 'mental' phenomena\u2014\ntrance-mediumship of Mrs Leonard's type, automatic writing,\n'phantasms', experimental telepathy\u2014and much research on those\nlines was being carried out during the period. But a glance at our\nProceedings or Journal will show that 'physical' mediumship was\nat the same time being investigated with as much vigour as at any\nperiod of the Society's history.\nPiddington was President for the years 1924-5, and retired from\nthe Council in 1932 after more than thirty years' membership of\nit. He continued to be an active member of the Committee of\nReference until 1940.\nValuable as were his administrative services to the Society, it is\nhis part in interpreting the scripts of the 'S.P.R. group of auto-\nmatists' that calls for special notice. This was the task of a team\nthat included Mrs Sidgwick, Oliver Lodge, Alice Johnson, and\nG. W. Balfour, but the main work fell on Piddington, and increas-\ningly so as ill-health or advancing years compelled the withdrawal\nof the others. This is not the time or the place to attempt a final\nappraisement of the significance of the scripts, but it may be a\nconvenient occasion to remind members of the general character\nof a piece of work on a larger scale perhaps than any other under-\ntaken by our Society, and of a kind that has not been and could\nnot have been undertaken by any other body.\n\f1952] J. G. Piddington and the 'Cross-Correspondence' Scripts 711\nThe problem that faced the interpreting group may be shortly\nstated thus. For about thirty years from 1901 onwards a round\ndozen of automatists, many but not all of them members of the\nSociety, produced well over three thousand 'scripts', a word given\nfor convenience an extended meaning to include not only pieces\nof automatic or inspirational writing, but also records of trance\nutterance, inspirational speech, and impressions received in\nsleep or waking or various states between. At an early stage it\nwas noted that there were connexions between the scripts of dif-\nferent autom.atists, and also between them and the records of\nsittings with Mrs Piper, that appeared to be neither fortuitous nor\ndue to normal association between them. These were the simpler\n'cross-correspondences'. The connexions were usually made\nthrough the recurrence of the same phrase, quotation from the\nsame literarj^ source, or insistence on the same topic.\nAs the result of wider and closer study it was noted that the\ncross-correspondences interlocked with each other in such a way\nas to make a pattern covering a very large portion of the script\nmaterial. As integral parts of the pattern were found (i) refer-\nences to verifiable facts which were certainly not within the con-\nscious knowledge of the automatist at the time they were made\nand had, so far as could be ascertained, never been within his or\nher normal knowledge, and (2) predictions relating both to public\nand private matters. Was it possible, by any rational and con-\nsistent method of interpretation, to establish what the pattern\nwas, how it came into existence, and whether it conveyed any\nparticular meaning?\nThis would have been a stiff enough job if the interpreters had\nbeen set to work on a final, complete set of scripts, in neatly typed\nfair copies, with all the quotations traced to their sources in half-\na-dozen literatures, all the personal allusions annotated, and every-\nthing indexed. But in fact all the searching out of literary sources\nand all the annotating and indexing had to be done while the\nscripts were pouring out, and the interpreters had at the same time\nto frame, with such assistance as they could derive from directions\nin the scripts, canons of interpretation for a mass of material, dis-\nconnected, allusive, and symbolic. Further study made it almost\ncertain that the obscurity was often deliberate and designed to\nprevent either automatist or interpreter from guessing the drift\nbefore what the script-intelligence, to use a non-committal term,\nconsidered the appropriate moment. In the Introduction to his\npaper in Volume XXXIII of Procee(fm^5 (pp. 439-60) Piddington\ngave a brief and lucid account of the principles on which he and\nhis fellow-interpreters had worked. The work had been mainly\ndone by him and Balfour in consultation, but no progress could\n\f712 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nhave been made in it without the index, the compilation of which\nfell almost entirely upon him.\nIt was a task calling for infinite patience, tireless industry, and\nscrupulous accuracy in detail, in all of which Piddington was\nhighly gifted. If there was the smallest variation in the form in\nwhich a quotation occurred in different scripts, any slight mis-\nspelling of a name or error as to a date, Piddington was down on\nit at once. The slip might, so far as the automatist's conscious\nmind was concerned, be unintentional, but possibly it might be\na device of the script-intelligence, as I have called it, to attract\nspecial attention to the passage where it occurred. Above all,\nhaving fixed his rules of interpretation he was prepared to follow\nthem to their logical conclusions, even if it meant attributing to\nthe script-intelligence intentions of a surprising kind and, as\nregards details of the pattern, meanings repugnant to his own\nrobust common-sense. For it must be emphasized that he was\nnot at all a cranky or eccentric person. Apart from psychical\nresearch, he conformed very closely in manner, opinions, and\ninterests to the typical Englishman of his age and education.\nFortunately, perhaps, although he was well-informed and well-\nread on many subjects, he had no special leaning towards poetry,\nso that in tracking down the sources of the many poetic quota-\ntions with which the scripts overflow, he had to move from step\nto step by careful study and had no temptation to jump to con-\nclusions.\nWhat, it may be asked, was the net result of all this labour and\ningenuity? To put it at the lowest, the interpreters produced\norder out of chaos, so that when they had done their work nearly\nthe whole of the enormous mass of scripts fitted into a coherent\npattern of which they had no conception when they started their\nlabours\n\u2014\nnearly the whole, that is to say, apart from exhortations\nto the automatists and interpreters and discussions as to experi-\nmental methods, which of course lie outside the pattern ; and\neven when these are excluded there remain passages where the\ninterpreters confessed themselves unable to discover a coherent\nmeaning.\nIt would of course be easy enough for an unscrupulous inter-\npreter to select tit-bits here and there from so large a mass,\narrange them arbitrarily, interpret them according to the caprice\nof the moment, and thereby obtain any pattern he pleased. Those,\nneedless to say, were not the methods of Balfour or Piddington\nor any of their fellow-workers. That so many pieces of the puzzle\nfitted neatly into place to produce an elaborate design incorporat-\ning many details that, considered by themselves, are extremely\nodd, seems to me strong evidence that the design really is\n\f1952] J. G. Piddingtoji and the 'Cross-Correspondence' Scripts 713\nthere, and is not the product of the interpreters' fantastic\ningenuity.\nNor can it be assigned to the normal knowledge of each others'\nscripts acquired by the different automatists, e.g. through reading\nProceedings, where several scripts were from time to time pub-\nlished, nor yet to rational inference based on such knowledge.\nOf the principal members of the group 'Mrs Holland' (Mrs\nFleming) died without knowing even the main outlines of the\npattern ; Mrs Stuart Wilson does not know them yet ; Mrs\nVerrall only learnt them from Piddington after most of her scripts\nhad been written, and was with difficulty persuaded to accept his\naccount ; and my wife was equally hard to persuade when\ninformed after her own scripts had ceased.\nThe choice seems to lie between three hypotheses, all para-\nnormal, separately, or perhaps in some combination of them. To\nbegin with the hypothesis involving the smallest departure from\nviews acceptable to most psychical researchers, it might be argued\nthat some person consciously or subconsciously designed the\npattern and contrived to distribute it by telepathy among the\nmembers of the group, each of whom reproduced in his scripts\nthe portion allotted to him. Those who incline to this view\ngenerally cast Mrs Verrall for the principal part, as she was the\nearliest of the group, and had the literary knowledge sufficient for\nproducing the pattern as we have it. On the other hand she had\nno normal knowledge of some of the facts woven into the pattern,\nand the pattern went on unfolding itself for many years after her\ndeath in 1916. It should be noted that even this hypothesis,\nwhich may be taken as the minimum worth discussion, postulates\ntelepathy of a kind very different from anything established or\nsuggested by quantitative or qualitative experiment.\nThis same difficulty attaches to the second hypothesis, which\nis that the pattern was created by the subconscious minds of the\nautomatists, acting as a group with a collective character that per-\nsisted notwithstanding the death or retirement of some of its\nmembers and the accession of others. This meets the difficulty\nas to the development of the pattern after 191 6, but raises pro-\nblems of its own, particularly as regards the implication of col-\nlective constructive activity on a very large scale carried on entirely\nat the subconscious level.\nThe third hypothesis is that the pattern was devised by some\nintelligence or group of intelligences external to the group of\nautomatists, and, more specifically, by a group of communicators\nincluding Sidgwick, Myers, and Gurney, with each of whom some\nof the scripts claim to originate. This was the view that after\nprolonged study all the principal interpreters accepted, although\nA3\n\f714 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [NOVEMBER\nseveral of them were not lightly persuaded to accept it. Pidding-\nton's natural scepticism was reinforced by a personal dislike,\nwhich he expressed to me, for the idea of surviving ; but this did\nnot prevent his accepting the survivalist view which he main-\ntained in his paper in Volume XXXIII of Proceedings.\nIt may be doubted, however, whether Balfour, Piddington, and\nthe other interpreters would have been willing to devote the\nimmense amount of time and labour that the elucidation of the\nscripts demanded, if the sole object of the scripts had been to\nestablish the survival and identity of the ostensible communi-\ncators. That was only the first stage in the declared purpose of\nthe script-intelligence. The declared ultimate purpose is the\ncreation of a universal and durable order of peace between nations\nand between classes, in the promotion of which the communicat-\ning group is, with many other persons, represented as engaged.\nThis, one need hardly say, is an ideal that has appealed to many\npeople at many times, and occasional references to it might have\nbeen expected in the scripts of automatists whose outlook on life\nwas that of the members of 'the S.P.R. group'. When found\nthere, they would have called for no particular notice. What\nstruck the interpreters as significant was the prominence given to\nthis topic in the whole mass of scripts, the persistence with which\nit is dwelt on from their beginning in 1901, and the peculiar way\nin which it is woven into a pattern embodying various paranormal\nfeatures, cross-correspondences, verifiable statements of facts not\nnormally known to the automatist making them, and predictions\nof public and private events, of which some had in the inter-\npreters' opinion been fulfilled.\nAll this seemed to warrant their belief that they were in touch\nwith discarnate intelligences having power to influence the actions\nof living men and women and foresee future events, and using\nthat power to promote an enterprise of immense importance for\nthe welfare of mankind. Holding that belief they were willing to\nspare neither time nor labour year after year in clearing up every\ndoubtful point connected with the scripts, and to put the result\nof their labours in an orderly permanent form, so that, if the pre-\ndictions were fulfilled, it should be beyond dispute exactly what\nthe predictions were, when they were made, and from whom they\nclaimed to come.\n'These all died . . . not having received the promises.' The\ninterpreters never supposed that they would receive them during\ntheir lives. But Piddington, the last survivor of them by several\nyears, told me in the autumn of 1950 that though he was sure\nthat the predictions had been correctly interpreted, the continued\ndeterioration in world affairs had for some time made him wonder\n\f1952] y. G. Piddington and the ^Cross-Correspondence^ Scripts 715\nwhether the communicators and their associates had not under-\ntaken more than they could perform. No precise date for fulfil-\nment is given in the scripts, but the suggestion is certainly made\nthat a beginning at least would take place in the lifetime of persons\nliving at the date of the First War. It seems to me desirable that\nthis should be stated now, without waiting for the predictions to\nbe fulfilled by the course of events, or falsified by the lapse of time.\nAs I have already said, this is not the occasion to attempt a\nfinal appraisement of the scripts, and when the occasion does\narise the attempt should be made by someone with a fuller know-\nledge of the whole of the scripts than I can claim. But I have\nread carefully more than half of them and, so far as concerns the\nmaterial I have read, I am prepared to accept the interpreters'\nconstruction of it as substantially correct, even as regards points\nwhere the eccentricity to be expected in any work of complex\nsymbolism might appear to have been given very free scope. But\njust as in ordinary life two people telling the same story with every\ndesire to be accurate will each tell it from a different angle, so\nwith the automatists of 'the S.P.R. group'. For example, all the\nscripts claim to be inspired by persons who have survived bodily\ndeath, and there is general agreement among the automatists as to\nwho these persons are, but with some of the automatists they are\npresented in a highly individualised dramatic form, with others\nthe emphasis is on what 'they '\nsay and do, on their collective\nand, perhaps, inter-personal activity. It has sometimes seemed\nto me that in this and in other connexions the interpreters have\noverstressed the personal aspect, and that the cause of this may\nhave been that with both Balfour and Piddington their subtle\npowers of reasoning were not tempered by psychic faculties, so\nthat, quick as they were to discern what was or was not significant\nin substance, they were prone to accept too literally the dramatic\nform with which the substance was clothed. I hesitate, however,\nto bring even this minor criticism against a piece of work on so\ngreat a scale as the interpretation of the scripts, and one carried\nout with so much toil and skill.\nOn the other hand, Piddington had in full measure two indis-\npensables for psychical research, human sympathy and a sense of\nhumour. Because of his sympathy and his obvious trustworthi-\nness and discretion, whenever, as often happened, it was necessary\nto verify some personal allusion in the scripts, he had no difficulty\nin getting people to answer questions as to their private affairs or\nto allow him to inspect their confidential diaries. His keen sense\nof humour made him a delightful companion and correspondent\nas soon as one penetrated his natural shyness and the reserve that\nwent with it.\nll\n\f7i6 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nThe poor health from which he suffered for many years did not\nprevent his deriving much quiet enjoyment from country hfe,\ngolf and music, all of which he found at Fisher's Hill. From the\nwindows of his book-lined study there he could enjoy delightful\nviews of garden, woodland, and down, and there, whenever\nscripts became a weariness to the flesh, he could console himself\nat the piano, which he played very well. But above all Fisher's\nHill gave him the company of like-minded friends. The last few\nyears of his long life were spent in his daughter's charming house\noverlooking the Bristol Channel.\nICHTHYOSIS TREATED BY HYPNOSIS\nStudents of psychical research are familiar with claims that con-\nditions resistant to normal medical treatment have been cured or\nrelieved by 'psychic' means, by religious faith, or by a combina-\ntion of the two. Thorough investigation of these claims is much\nmore difficult than would appear at first sight, but most experi-\nenced psychical researchers\u2014and certainly the medical profession\n\u2014would attribute the results to suggestion applied to functional\ndisorders of psychological origin. This view is supported by the\nabsence of evidence that a congenital condition of an organic\nnature has been cured or relieved by suggestion alone. It is for\nthis reason that a recent report in the British Medical Journal has\naroused such interest.^ The following condensation is printed\nby permission of the Editor of the British Medical Journal and of\nthe author, Dr A. A. Mason, Senior Registrar, Queen Victoria\nHospital, East Grinstead.\nThe patient, a boy of sixteen, suffered from congenital ichthy-\nosis ('Crocodile Skin'), a condition whose aetiology is unknown\nand which is regarded as resistant to all forms of treatment.\n'The lesion', writes Dr Mason,\nconsisted of a black horny layer covering his entire body except his\nchest, neck, and face. The skin was papuliferous, each papilla pro-\njecting 2-6 mm. above the surface, and the papillae were separated\nfrom each other by only a very small distance, perhaps i mm. The\npapillae themselves varied in size from small thread-like projections\n'\nA. A. Mason, M.B., B.S., 'A Case of Congenital Ichthyosiform\nErythrodermia of Brocq Treated by Hypnosis', British Medical Journal,\nNo. 4781, 23 August 1952, pp. 422-3.\n\f1952] Ichthyosis treated by Hypnosis 717\non the abdomen, back, and flexor surfaces of the arms to large warty\nexcrescences 5 mm. across on the feet, thighs, and palms. The small\namount of skin which was visible between the papillae was also black,\nhorny, and fissured. To the touch the skin felt as hard as a normal\nfinger-nail, and was so inelastic that any attempt at bending resulted\nin a crack in the surface, which would then ooze blood-stained serum.\nIn the skin flexures there were fissures which were constantly being\nreopened by movement and were chronically infected and painful.\nThe ichthyosiform layer, when cut, was of the consistence of cartilage\nand was anaesthetic for a depth of several millimetres.\nThe condition varied in severity in different areas of the body, being\nworst on the hands, feet, thighs, and calves, and least on the upper\narms, abdomen, and back. The skin on the face, neck, and chest\nappeared normal, although, as is shown later, it became papuliferous\nwhen transplanted to the palms. . . . The patients parents are alive\nand well, and there was no family history of ichthyosis. His birth was\nnormal, after an uneventful pregnancy.\nAfter treatment at various hospitals without avail, on 25 May\n1950 skin from the chest was grafted to the palms of both hands\nby Mr F. T. Moore, consulting plastic surgeon to the Queen\nVictoria Hospital, East Grinstead, but within a month it had\nbecome indistinguishable from the rest of the affected skin. A\nsecond attempt at grafting the palms two months later produced\nthe same result, with the added complication of severe contrac-\ntures of the fingers. Sir Archibald Mclndoe and other plastic\nsurgeons who saw the patient agreed that further grafting opera-\ntions were unlikely to be successful, and that no alternative\nplastic procedure was possible.\nUnder hypnosis on 10 February 195 1 the patient was given the\nsuggestion that the left arm would clear. ^ (The suggestion was\nlimited to the left arm so as to exclude the possibility of spon-\ntaneous resolution.) 'About five days later', says Dr Mason,\nthe horny layer softened, became friable, and fell off'. The skin under-\nneath was slightly erythematous, but normal in texture and colour.\nFrom a black and armour-like casing, the skin became pink and soft\nwithin a few days. Improvement occurred first in the flexures and\nareas of friction, and later on the rest of the arm. The erythema\nfaded in a few days. At the end of 10 days the arm was completely\nclear from shoulder to wrist. . . . The right arm was treated in the same\nway (see Figs, la and ib and ten days later the legs (see Figs. 2a\nand zb ;\nyi and 3^) and trunk were treated.\n^ Dr Mason informs us that the treatment was carried out by him.\n^ The photographs are not reproduced here.\n\f7i8 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nThe result of the treatment is shown in the report as follows :\nRegion Before Treatment After Treatment\nHands\nArms\nBack\nButtocks\nThighs\nLegs and feet\nCompletely covered\n80% covered\nCovered, but only lightly\nHeavily covered\nCompletely and heavily covered\nCompletely and heavily covered\nPalms clear.

Martindale, S.J. {The Month,\nJune 1952. pp. 348-57.)\nWhen Fr Thurston died in 1939 the English Jesuits lost one of\nthe most distinguished members of the Society and Roman\nCatholics in England their greatest expert in psychical research.\nHe was a tireless worker and his first ticket of admission to the\nBritish Museum Reading Room was dated 1880. During the\nlatter years of his life I used to meet him constantly as we both\nlaboured under the dome, and we were often in consultation over\ncontroversial points, and sometimes combined in an innocent\nplot to persuade the authorities to buy some rare book which we\nboth needed and thought should be added to the shelves.\nFr Crehan's memoir is an admirable sketch of Thurston's life\nand activities and throws a vivid light on the course of his mental\ndevelopment and outlook. His interest in psychical research was\n\f1952] Reviews 719\nearly aroused, and in 1899 George Tyrrell wrote to him saying\nthat Everard Feilding wanted him to go to hear the ghostly choir\nat Slindon since the S.P.R. was not welcome 'because they deal\nin devils'. Nevertheless, Tyrrell tried to persuade Thurston to\njoin the Society at the same time as himself, but it was not till\nmuch later that he did so, and in 1921 read a paper on the pheno-\nmena of stigmatization.\nIn his discussion of Fr Thurston's many controversies Fr\nCrehan has, in the main, succeeded in being as objective as could\nbe expected, although his lapse in printing the utterly unfair and\nuntrue attack on the late Dr G. G. Coulton (p. 1153) is to be\nregretted. It is true that the latter's clash with Fr Thurston was\none of the bitterest moments of his controversial career, but his\ndefence of Lea was doubtless influenced by his belief in Lord\nActon's judgment and his opinion (which I did my best to shake)\nthat Fr Thurston was far from being the doughty adversary that\nI knew him to be.\nIn his treatment of Thurston's psychical interests Fr Crehan\nis wary, although he reveals the fact, hitherto quite unknown to\nme, that Thurston visited Naples in 1925 to see the liquefaction\nof the blood of St Januarius, a phenomenon to which he and I\nhad devoted a good deal of attention. For reasons which have\nnever been explained neither he nor any other authority has, to\nmy knowledge, attempted to deal in detail with the so-called\nexposure which was published in the Hibbert Journal in 1921, and\nall my recent attempts to obtain information from Catholic\nsources have met with no success.\nApart from a few minor errors, such as 'Douglas' Home, Mrs\n'Woodhiir and that Fr Thurston joined the S.P.R. in '1919', Fr\nCrehan's biography is an excellent introduction to the work of a\nman whose book. The Physical Phenomena of Mysticistn, to which\nI will now turn, is the most brilliant and fascinating account of\nthe phenomena of the Saints ever written. In editing the work,\nhowever, it is a pity that Fr Crehan has not given the precise\nhistory and date of each of the papers of which this book is a\ncollection, as since he is not sufficiently acquainted with the sub-\nject, it is often impossible to determine whether Fr Thurston\nomitted to discuss relevant material or whether such material was\npublished after the paper itself had been printed.\nThe 'oook itself is a mine of information on the alleged physical\nphenomena associated with various holy persons. In dealing with\nthese extraordinary manifestations Fr Thurston displays a wide\nacquaintance with the different sources, and usually estimates the\ndegree of credence to be placed upon them with considerable\nacumen. Some of his criticisms and exposures will come as a\n\f720 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nshock to those unaccustomed to weighing evidence ; and the\nobjectivity with which he treats the material cannot fail to com-\nmend itself to the psychical researcher, especially since he states\nthat some of the evidence as printed in the Processes is 'notably\nbetter attested' than any to be found in the Proceedings of the\nS.P.R.\nAmong the phenomena discussed and documented in this\nvolume will be found levitations, the stigmata, telekinesis, fire-\ntests, bodily elongation, the alleged absence of rigor mortis and the\nusual signs of corruption, and some remarkable cases of living\nwithout eating. For levitation a number of instances are adduced,\nsome of which are very difficult to explain away, although I find\nit hard to understand why Fr Thurston, in trying to show that\nthese phenomena were still noted as occurring in the nineteenth\ncentury, should quote the quite unacceptable cases of Marie\nBaourdie (d. 1878) and of Maria della Passione (d. 191 2), neither\nof which have, I think, the slightest evidential value.\nAmong all the remarkable phenomena recorded by Fr Thurston\nit is, to say the least, somewhat suggestive that many of the\nmediumistic phenomena regarded by psychical researchers as\nalmost certainly fraudulent are scarcely to be found among those\nrecorded by hagiographers, materializations being confined, so it\nwould seem, to the very curious cases of the alleged multiplication\nof food, which phenomena Thurston thinks cannot be lightly\ndismissed, although he agrees that the evidence is often inadequate\nto sustain them.\nTo anyone acquainted with the works of such writers as Schram,\nGorres, Ribet, Poulain, or Saudreau, this book must come as a\nsurprise. For it illustrates the changes in the viewpoint of intel-\nligent and informed Catholics in these matters better than any\nwork I know. For not only was Thurston both chercheur et\ncritique in theology, as the head of the BoUandists called him, but\na man who knew it to be his duty to make himself informed on\nwhat psychical research was doing undeterred by the ill-informed\ngossip about the devils and the S.P.R. It was this comparative\nsurvey which enabled him to treat many mystical phenomena as\nexamples of conditions common in psychopathology and having\nnothing supernatural or miraculous about them.\nIt must be realized that, to the Catholic, the supernatural is of\ntwo main types : {a) the essential supernatural which is not open\nto scientific scrutiny and is the object of faith, and {b) the modal\nsupernatural or more simply the marvellous. Thus the stigmata\nand various alleged diabolic manifestations belong to the modal\nsupernatural in certain cases, fact of which can be established\nby science, but of which the explanation is not to be sought on\n\f1952] Reviews 721\nmaterial grounds. Thus, in order to determine the truly mar-\nvellous, all natural explanations must be eliminated. It is pre-\ncisely here that we can see how grave differences of opinion are\nlikely to arise in, for example, cases of diabolic possession where,\nto use the words of a recent writer in the Etudes Carmelitames, 'le\nmonde ecclesiastique n'est spontanement que trop porte, en cette\nmatiere, a une credulite naive', and where the imprudent and\nill-considered action of certain priests is liable to do harm rather\nthan good to the psychotic subject. Thus in the case of the\nstigmata, which psychical researchers have for long regarded as\nclosely connected with hysterical and neurotic states (which con-\nditions, in their relation to mysticism, had already been discussed\nby Fr G. Hahn in 1883), Thurston was insistent on the fact that\nhardly any cases are known where nervous disorders had not\nappeared before the development of the wounds, and indeed, he\nwent so far as to say that he would like to hear of one case of a\nstigmatica who had no bad family history. In view of the pre-\nvalence of hysteria in the conditions under which women were\nformerly brought up, he pointed out how, during the last seven\ncenturies, female stigmatics vastly outnumber the male, of which\nonly two clear cases seem to have been recorded in which all the\nfive wounds were externally observable. Although this dispro-\nportion is more than once mentioned by Thurston, it does not\nseem to have occurred to him that this is possibly due to the fact\nthat the object of concentration and worship is male, and that it\nis this sexual element which is mainly responsible, a supposition\nsupported by the cases of the very curious espousal rings which\nhe describes in Ch. Ill, and by the fact that, at least in one case,\na stigmatica, having happily married, was no longer stigmatized.\nAlthough Thurston admits a number of instances of imposture\namong those with whom he deals, he has been clearly very careful\nto avoid any account of the more flagrant cases (such as the Holy\nBambino of Bari) which were supported by high ecclesiastical\nauthorities presumably for the benefit of those unable to detect\nor to expose the fraud.\nIn dealing with cases of stigmata prior to St Francis, Fr Thurs-\nton comments very unsympathetically on the English case of the\nearly thirteenth century where Merkt claimed a genuine example\nof stigmatization, but which, as seems fairly clear, was a case of\ncrucifixion and self-inflicted wounds, which is actually stated to\nhave been so in the Annals of Dunstable and by Ralph of Cogges-\nhall. That this is not the explanation in the modern case of\nPadre Pio seems to be certain, judging from the admirably con-\ncise account by Fr C. C. Martindale in the June 1952 issue of\nThe Month. The extreme caution displayed by the Holy Ofliice\n\f722 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nin this case is clearly due to the influence of more modern views\nof the nature of the stigmata and their close connexion w^ith\npsychopathological factors operating in the subject. What must\nstrike the non-Catholic as so odd is that it does not seem to have\noccurred to some of the ecclesiastical authorities that, just as it is\naffirmed that the devil can profit by functional disequilibrium to\ngain influence over a sufferer and, indeed, cannot exert his powder\nwithout such mental and nervous trouble being present, so\nGod might exert His power in the formation of the stigmata only\nin persons whose psychological make-up lends itself to such\nDivine interference. From this point of view the stigmata of\nPadre Pio can be clearly classed as supernatural. This caution on\nthe part of the Holy Office can, perhaps, be linked with the\nclarification of the views of Fr Thurston concerning the stigmata\nwhich were due to his study of the alleged production of such\nmarks on the Austrian peasant woman by the Lutheran physician,\nAlfred Lechler, in 1932. Apparently Thurston accepted this\nstory as conclusive proof that 'stigmata' could be produced solely\nthrough suggestion, and his acceptance is yet another indication\nof his increasingly credulous attitude when examining medical\ntestimony concerning unusual physiological and psychological\nphenomena. This tendency, now becoming increasingly common\namong well-informed Catholics, is due to the fact that they\ndeliberately cut themselves off from any practical experience of\nthe phenomena with which they are dealing. Relying on printed\nsources they have little or no acquaintance with the true nature of\nthe facts described, and thus are apt to credit tales of events which,\nhad they actually been present, they would at once have seen had\nbut little resemblance to the description given later by enthusi-\nastic and untrained witnesses.\nTowards the end of his life Fr Thurston became more and more\nprone to believe the stories of spiritualistic phenomena printed in\npresumably reputable journals, and my oft-repeated words of\ncaution merely seemed to him to be the product of an unreasoning\nscepticism. With his acceptance of much of the Margery pheno-\nmena, even after the thumb-print controversy, he showed that\neven his critical mind had failed to resist the barrage of suggestion\nand display of pseudo-science which was becoming one of the\nmost marked features of psychical research and which, once under-\nstood, was to lead many orthodox scientific men to doubt the\nvalidity of almost everything that came out of the parapsychological\nlaboratories. That Fr Thurston failed to see through what lay\nbeyond was another proof, if any were needed, of the goodness,\nsimplicity, and faith which inspired him. His book is not only\nthe achievement of a scholar and critic which, for the first time.\n\f1952] Reviews 723\noffers the evidence for the phenomena of the saints in an accept-\nable form, but the work of a very human and lovable personality\nto whom I am grateful for having been allowed to share, in how-\never slight a degree, in the controversies and problems to which\nso many years of both our lives have been devoted.\nE. J. Dingwall\nTelepathy and Spiritualism : personal experiments, experi-\nences and views. By J. Hettinger. London, Rider, 1952.\n150 pp. Illus. i6s.\nThis book covers a number of substantially unrelated topics\nand includes much that has already been published. Ch. VII, for\nexample, gives Dr Hettinger's views on 'telepathy v clairvoyance',\nwhich were printed in S.P.R. Proceedings for June 1946. Ch. XI\nis a record of mediums' impressions collected by Dr Hettinger\nrelating to the as yet unopened envelope left by the late Sir Oliver\nLodge. Ch. X gives Dr Hettinger's views on Spiritualism, to-\ngether with his account of the personal experiences with mediums\nthat have made him a believer in communication with spirits.\nIn Ch. I there is a discussion of the 'handicaps in the search for\ntruth' deriving from 'the limitations of the field of mental vision'\nand 'our personal mental worlds'. A prominent feature of this\nchapter is the 'integrated diagram' (circular) of 'our personal\nmental worlds' in which there are assigned positions (segmental)\nto the realms of 'nature', 'mind and spirit', 'human relations', and\nso forth. It is interesting to juxtapose this with the comment in\nthe following chapter that Whately Carington had a weak spot for\nphilosophy.\nSeveral chapters are a summary of Dr Hettinger's previously\npublished investigations in object-reading. It is unnecessary to\nsay much about this, since his two books on the subject. The Ultra-\nPerceptive Faculty (1940) and Exploring the Ultra-Perceptive\nFaculty (1941), have both been reviewed already in this Journal,\nand in addition the whole research has been analysed by Chris-\ntopher Scott in S.P.R. Proceedings for November 1949. Briefly,\nthe method is to present mediums with personal objects and col-\nlect impressions from them which are supposed to relate to the\nowners of the articles. Dr Hettinger adopted various control\ndevices. For instance, he would pair all the items given by the\nmedium in connexion with one article with items given in con-\nnexion with other articles in order to find out if the owner would\nbe able to identify that member of each pair which was actually\nintended to relate to him.\nExperiments of this type are not as easy to carry out objectively\n\f724 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nas they appear to be at first sight, and the methods of Dr Hettinger\nmade error Hkely. In some cases it seemed that the control items\nwere not of the same quaHty as the items with which they were\npaired. Another difficuhy was the possibiHty of bias in selected\nrecording, since it was Dr Hettinger himself who sat with the\nmediums and wrote down their statements, and in most cases he\nknew the owners of the objects. There were also many elemen-\ntary errors in the statistical evaluation tending to exaggerate the\nsignificance of the results, which were already doubtful on grounds\nof faulty experimental method.^\nIn Dr Hettinger's later work, the owners of objects looked at\nmagazine illustrations at the time of the tests, and the mediums'\nimpressions were supposed to relate to the content of these target\npictures. Dr Hettinger considered that the correspondences\nobtained were self-evidently more than chance expectation, so\nthat no controls were needed. The coincidences illustrated in\nExploring the Ultra-Perceptive Faculty were certainly striking and\nlikely to convince an uncritical reader, but then they had been\nselected from a large mass of material. The whole matter depended\nupon Dr Hettinger's subjective judgment, and that this was not\naltogether to be trusted is obvious because he seemed unable to\nappreciate that some at least of the correspondences would have\noccurred in the absence of telepathy. When he was prevailed\nupon by the American S.P.R. to have some of his data, together\nwith some control material, scored by an independent judge, the\nscores on the control material were no different from the scores\non the rest of the data. Christopher Scott also carried out an\nexperiment with Dr Hettinger and, unknown to the latter, he sub-\nstituted control pictures for some of the illustrations that had been\nused as targets in the usual tests. Dr Hettinger himself did the\nscoring, and again there were as many correspondences on the\ncontrol pictures as on the others. A reasonable conclusion is that\nDr Hettinger judged wrongly, and that the results were no dif-\nferent from chance expectation.\nIn Ch. VIII Dr Hettinger describes a new development, the\nattempt to transmit a code message by the use of his picture tests.\nA prepared set of target pictures is made to stand for the code\nwords, and these are concentrated upon by an agent in the order\nrepresentative of the words of the message. As before, the sensi-\ntive, at a distance, handles an object belonging to the agent. Her\nimpressions are recorded by the experimenter, who notes any\ncorrespondences with the known target pictures and, from these\n\u2022The best available methods for the conduct and evaluation of object-\nreading tests are described by Pratt and Birge, J. ParapsychoL, December\n1948.\n\f1952]\n'\nReviews 725\ncorrespondences, attempts to deduce the order in which the\ntargets were looked at and thence the words of the message. This,\nof course, is an example of the use of pre-arranged targets in place\nof free material, a method which in another chapter Dr Hettinger\ncondemns. It is a method which gives results that can readily be\nassessed statistically, but the figures are not quoted. Dr Hettinger\ntells us only that this method, and various modifications of it, all\nproved inadequate for the transmission of messages. As the\nevidence suggests that the previous results from picture tests were\non a level with chance expectation, this conclusion is not surpris-\ning. Dr Hettinger gives a number of plausible rationalisations to\nexplain his frustration.\nIt is a tragedy that years of efliort were wasted on these faulty\nexperiments. Chapter II reveals what is mainly responsible for\ntheir failure : an attitude of puerile animosity towards other\ninvestigators has prevented Dr Hettinger from seeking friendly\nadvice at an early stage and so forestalling criticism. Instead he\nmiaintains his lone though vulnerable eminence by simply ignoring\nother people. It is typical of him that beyond the comment (p.\n27) that other investigators have criticised his work as he criticises\ntheirs, he gives the reader not the slightest hint that much of his\nresearch has been demonstrated to be ill-founded. His opinions\nof the research of others make droll reading. He has a bee in his\nbonnet about statistics, which he obviously does not grasp, so\nthat he finds himself unable to accept the results of card-calling\ntests without an empirical control of randomly picked cards to\ndemonstrate the level of chance expectation (p. 24). If only he\nhad been as particular about his own picture tests! He condemns\nboth Rhine and Soal for using a fixed number of symbols instead\nof 'free' material like drawings, but he is dissatisfied with Caring-\nton's work with drawings because the results were statistical and\nthe subjects were not specially selected sensitives. As for Dr\nRhine's PK hypothesis, he is 'ver}^ much surprised that the idea\nwas mooted at all . .\n.'\n(p. 26). I have a similar sentiment about\nDr Hettinger's hypothesis (Ch. VII) that cases of apparent pre-\ncognition are due to the intervention of spirits. According to this\ntheor}' a spirit anticipates or brings about an action in individual\nA. and at the same time gives individual B. an apparently pre-\nmonitory impression of A.'s future action.\nI have deliberately left to the last consideration of Ch. IX,\nbecause I believe it is the most important. In it there is a descrip-\ntion of an ingenious new experiment designed to demonstrate the\nlong-distance telepathic transmission of emotions. An agent is\nsubjected at irregular intervals to painful or startling stimuli. The\nsensitive is connected to an apparatus for recording the psycho-\n\f726 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\ngalvanic reflex\u2014that is, changes in electrical resistance of the skin\nwhich coincide with emotional reactions. Deflections of the\ngalvanometer corresponding in time with stimulation of the agent\nare held to indicate that the sensitive, subconsciously at least, is\nreacting to the agent's emotion.\nThe experimental design is amenable to a simple statistical\ncontrol. The agent's stimuli are always given at exactly full\nminute intervals from the moment of commencing On the\naverage there is a stimulus at one in three of the minute intervals\nthroughout the experiment. Whenever there is a galvanometer\ndeflection within a fifteen-second range around the minute\nintervals this is counted as a reaction. It is stated that reactions\nalways occur more frequently at the minute intervals when there\nis an agent stimulation than at the minute intervals when there\nis no stimulation.\nNo detailed account of the experiment is given, and it may be\nthat randomisation of the times of agent-stimulation and other\nobvious precautions may not have been taken. If so, the project\nwould be just one more example of a typical Hettinger experim^ent,\nexcellent in conception yet faulty in execution. Personally I am\noptimistic. It would be an outstanding advance if this should\nprove to be the long-awaited method of obtaining accurate ESP\nresponses by circumventing conscious inhibitions. I am sure we\nall hope to find in the full report the fruitful and valid consumma-\ntion of his labours which Dr Hettinger's persistence richly\ndeserves.\nD. J. West\nWhere Two Worlds Meet : the verbatim record of a series of\nnineteen seances with John Campbell Sloan, the famous\nGlasgow direct voice medium. By Arthur Findlay. London,\nPsychic Press, 1951. 624 pp. i plate. 12s. 6d.\nDo spiritualists realize how much harm is done to their cause\nby a claim, such as that made by the author on the cover of this\nbook, that 'No more conclusive evidence of survival is available'\nthan the reports of sittings he has printed ? If such a claim could\nbe substantiated, the case for survival would be very much weaker\nthan I believe it to be.\nJohn Campbell Sloan, who died in May 195 1 while this book\nwas being printed, had practised as a medium for fifty years, and\nMr Findlay's acquaintance with him goes back more than thirty\nyears. It would naturally be distasteful to any living medium to be\nforced into competition with another medium who has recently\ndied, but as Mr Findlay has made this claim it must be pointed\n\f1952] Reviews 727\nout that the communications recorded in this book were produced\nunder much less rigorous conditions than those recorded in the\ncase of several other mediums both living and dead. The sittings\nwith Sloan were held in a circle of about half a dozen, most of\nwhom on every occasion appear to have been regular sitters living\nin the Glasgow area. He could hardly have failed in course of\ntime to have acquired normally much information about the\nregular sitters and their friends and relations, living and dead.\nThe same was true of the Piper mediumship in its early stages,\nand it was to avoid prejudicial inferences that might be drawn\nfrom this fact that Mrs Piper was brought over to England, to sit\nwith persons about whom she had no previous knowledge. After\nher return to the United States she was confronted with a very\nlarge number of sitters quite unknown to her and often intro-\nduced anonymously. Much more evidential value is to be\nattached to communications received through a medium giving\nsittings to single sitters who are frequently changing than to com-\nmunications given to a more or less constant circle.\nThe sittings recorded in this book took place at various times\nbetween April 1942 and July 1945, when Sloan was already an\nold man. Several times during the sittings he complained of feel-\ning tired, and it is probable that, whatever his psychic powers\nmay have been, they were already in decline. It is accordingly\nthe sitters, who seem to have been very easily satisfied, rather than\nthe medium, against whom criticism should be directed. Take,\nfor example, the incident reported on pp. 148-9 when the medium\nsaid he had been looking at a photograph of the husband of Mrs\nLang, and that it was not very clear. A voice here interrupted,\n'Yes, you lost the negative and it had to be taken off an old photo-\ngraph,' and persisted in this assertion nothwithstanding Sloan's\ndenial of all recollection of the incident. Mrs Lang, one of the\nregular sitters, then exclaimed, 'Yes, that is right, Mr Sloan. I\nremember you lost the negative and hunted all over for it. Who\nis it who knows all about photos? It must be someone who knows\nme very well.' So of course it was, as the incident had at one time\nbeen perfectly well known to Sloan's conscious mind, and the\ninterruption is at best a dramatization of a lapsed memory.\nIt is stated that Sloan frequently spoke in foreign languages\n'which sometimes could not be understood', but we are given very\nfew examples of foreign speech, whether understood or not.\nTwice we are given two words of Gaelic, a language of which\nSloan probably knew something as his mother came from the\nHighlands. There are four words of Latin, 'Ars longa. Vita\nbrevis,' a sufiiciently familiar tag, and a Danish communicator,\ntogether with som^e broken English, spoke two words which are\n\f728 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\napparently claimed as Danish. Another communicator 'started\nto speak fluently in French', but we are not told whether any of\nthe sitters took part in the conversation, and if so whether the\ncommunicator responded intelligently to their remarks, or whether\nany of the circle knew French well enough to judge if the com-\nmunicator's language and pronunciation were correct. Sloan had\nat two periods of his life followed the sea and may very likely in\nthat way have acquired a smattering of the languages of two\ncountries with which we have as close commercial relations as\nFrance and Denmark. What a pity that the Circle did not use a\nrecording machine so that the Danish and French could be played\nover to persons familiar with those languages, and the Red Indian,\nEast Indian, and African Guides have been invited to make\nrecords of their own languages which could have been submitted\nto experts!\nTwo among the communicators gave the names of W. E.\nGladstone and J. M. Barrie, who in this life were notable for\nintellectual gifts and powers of expressing themselves which they\nappear to have lost when shuffling ofl^ this mortal coil (see pp. 119\nand 176). In justice to Sloan it may be said that some of Mrs\nPiper's Controls represented even less worthily the great names\nthey claimed.\nGenerally speaking, while the records are satisfactorily full as\nto what was said at the sittings, the reader looks in vain for the\nwealth of annotation by the sitter which gives value to the records\nof Mrs Piper, Mrs Leonard, Miss Cummins, and other mediums\nof their type. The absence of details of this kind puts this book\ndefinitely on a lower level than the published records of these\nmediums.\nA characteristic of the Sloan mediumship, which distinguishes\nhim from these other mediums and appears to Mr Findlay to be\nof crucial importance, is the association of physical phenomena,\nsuch as the movement of trumpets, with the communications.\nThe sittings were held in complete darkness and Sloan was not\nsubjected to either manual or mechanical control. Mr Findlay\ncomplains that the scientists of Glasgow University paid little\nattention to Sloan's phenomena and did not employ infra-red\nphotography. One may fairly ask why Mr Findlay and his friends\ndid not employ this technique themselves, or if they felt they had\nnot the expert knowledge, why they did not pay somebody to\nattend the sittings and do the necessary things on their behalf.\nBut is there any reason to suppose that Sloan would have agreed\nto this? The infra-red telescope was not available for general\nuse at the time these sittings were being held, but it is not irrelevant\nto note that since it has become available physical mediums are very\n\f1952] Reviews 729\nshy of it, although it is well known that the use of it makes unneces-\nsary some of the other techniques of control which mediums\nprofess to find irksome. In the points, therefore, in which Sloan's\nmediumship during the years 1942-5 can be compared with that\nof such mediums as have already been mentioned, it falls far short,\nwhile its distinctive features are, owing to the absence of control,\nof no evidential value.\nOn pp. 342-3 Mr Findlay makes an attack on the Society which\ncalls for a brief comment. He says that in 1925 he suggested to\nSir William Barrett to put before the Society a proposal to investi-\ngate Sloan in London, Mr Findlay paying the expenses. He con-\ntinues, 'Sir William went to the next Council meeting and put\nforward my offer. Much to his disappointment the Council\nturned it down with neither an explanation nor an expression of\nthanks, and, when he told me of its decision not to investigate\nSloan's mediumship, he was not only disappointed but angry.\nThat ended the matter and nothing was ever done. My reaction\nwas to resign my membership of the Society.' This is a charge\nagainst the Society of failure to perform its duty as an investigat-\ning body, and also of discourtesy to Mr Findlay. As regards the\nsecond and minor charge Barrett never laid the proposal formally\nbefore the Council, although he consulted some of the Officers.\nI remember very well hearing of the proposal, doubtless as being\nthen Hon. Treasurer. What report Barrett gave Mr Findlay of\nhis discussion with the Society's Officers I do not know, but if\nthere was any failure of courtesy it was certainly not on the part\nof the Officers or Council.\nThe other charge is a more serious one. In bringing it Mr\nFindlay should in candour have mentioned a very material condi-\ntion that he attached to his proposal, namely that the Society\nshould engage Sloan as caretaker at Tavistock Square. While the\nOfficers of the Society had no reason to regard Sloan as per-\nsonally untrustworthy, they did not consider it good policy to\nallow a professional or semi-professional medium the free run at\nall hours of the day and night of premises where a large amount\nof highly confidential information was (and is) kept. Much of\nthis information has been entrusted to the Society precisely\nbecause it could only come into the hands of officials specially\ncharged with the duty of secrecy. Any suspicion that a medium\nhas had access to material subsequently referred to in communica-\ntions received through him or through any other medium goes far\nto discredit any evidential value that might otherwise attach to\nthem. The best mediums realize that it is to their interest that\nno such cause for suspicion should occur. In this respect they\nshow a better appreciation of evidential standards than Mr Findlay\n\f730 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nwho, when informed of the reason why his proposal had been\ndechned, hght-heartedly brushed it aside.\nIncidentally it may be mentioned that this incident occurred in\n1923, not 1925, when the Society had no vacancy for a caretaker,\nand that Mr Findlay's reaction to resign did not take effect until\n1932.\nW. H. S.\nThe Devil in Massachusetts : a modern enquiry into the Salem\nwitch trials. By Marion L. Starkey. London, Hale, 1952.\n269 pp. lUus. i8s.\nThis 'modern enquiry into the Salem witch trials' fully deserves\nthe claims made for it by the publishers. It certainly 'combines\na narrative that has the pace and excitement of a novel' with 'an\nauthentic history of the Salem witch trials', and if the application\nof 'modern psychiatric knowledge to the witchcraft hysteria' is\nnot very elaborate or profound, it is quite sufficient for the purpose\nin hand. The primary purpose of the book is to present a clear\npicture, as accurate as careful documentation can make it, of the\nintense but short-lived outbreak of witch-hunting which swept\nthrough Salem village and some of the surrounding districts in\n1692. The phenomena, wholly unintelligible in that age, reveal\nupon a tiny scale, for only twenty victims in all were put to death,\nthe astonishing effects of mass hysteria, such as held Europe for\nthree centuries at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. But\nat Salem they took place in a community rigid alike in Calvinist\ntheology, in Puritan morality, and in a real desire for justice. The\nvery forces which produced the outbreak by driving a group of\nadolescent girls into the self-display of hysterical convulsions, in\nwhich they named the alleged witches who were supposed to be\ntormenting them, were the forces which speedily led to its control.\nThe whole story is fully documented by court records as well as\nby the contemporary writings of Cotton Mather and others\nimmediately concerned, and is here admirably told.\nFrom the point of view of parapsychology the most striking fact\nis the obvious honesty of all concerned, except perhaps the slave\nTituba who first awakened the hysterical symptoms in the children\nwho formed the original 'young people's circle'. Once the fever\nof suspicion had spread every sort of story was believed, 'shapes'\nwere reported as acting anywhere and everywhere, and the visions\nof hysterics completely outweighed the ordinary evidence of sober\npeople. One of the strangest figures of all is the grim Chief\nJustice Stoughton, who seems to have been wholly sincere and\nwholly free from hysteria, devoted to the one purpose of exter-\n\f1952] Reviews 731\nminating witches by strict process of law, and yet quite unable to\nsee the complete worthlessness of the evidence upon which his\njudgments were based. And the fundamental religious strength\nof a community has never been more fully demonstrated than by\nthe public pardoning of Ann Putnam, no longer a hysteric, and\nher restoration to her place among them by the very relatives of\nthose whom her testimony had sent to the gallows.\nBut whether the ghost of Mary Esty really appeared to Mary\nHerrick, and so won the day, the reader must judge.\nL. W. Grensted\nBorderlands of Science. By Alfred Still. London, Rider, 1952.\n276 pp. 20s.\nThis work is in the main a potted history of the wax of science\nand psychology and the wane of superstition, with the theme\nextended very naturally to include a brief survey of the various\nphenomena v\/hich come under the heading of psychical research.\nUnfortunately, one is left with the impression that most of the\ninformation could have been equally well obtained by studying\njointly an encyclopaedia and a Who Was Who. But if Mr Still\nadds little of his own to the general discussion, he does at any\nrate point a very clear way to other sources of information.\nHe makes a bold, interesting, and praiseworthy effort to show\nthe error of science in rejecting out of hand those problems at\npresent beyond its normal specialized scope. But though repeat-\nedly concerned over the fallibility of human judgement, the author\nwould nonetheless seem to have made up his own mind on the\nstrength of evidence that is left quite unexplained. Thus, when\nwe are told (p. 102) that 'Many careless people are sceptical about\na future existence ...\" we search unrewardingly for an expansion\nof view that Mr Still has been anything but careless to hide.\nWe cannot fail to appreciate his obvious sincerity, however\n;\nnor yet the unusual courage he displays in squirting Spiritualists,\nscientists, astrologers, believers and unbelievers from the same\nbottle of ink! Throughout this book the desire to be objective is\ncertainly unmistakable.\nIn spite of the fact that an interesting chapter on Body, Mind,\nand Memory shows the author to be not entirely unfamiliar with\nthe complex problems of subconscious activity, the practical\nimportance of intuition is grossly overrated. However pure the\nbasic intuition may be, it can rarely if ever emerge into reflective\nawareness without being modified by a very fallible subconscious.\nWhile, therefore, we can study the results of supposed intuition,\nthe basic factor is itself a matter at present beyond the scope of\n\f732 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nfinal objective pronouncement. In other words, intuition is\nlargely a private matter, and is far too unreliable to serve as a self-\nsufficient aid to the establishment of any 'universal truth'.\nPerhaps the author's failure to realize this explains his aversion\nfrom controlled experiments in ESP, and his complete neglect of\nDr Soal! Thus, regarding quantitative experiments we read that\n'Conclusions drawn from such data are not likely to impress the\nscientist, especially if he is also a mathematician. Yet several\nrecent investigators have adopted similar methods in the belief\nthat the analysis of the accumulated data provides better evidence\nof a telepathic faculty than the many plausible stories of spon-\ntaneous thought transmission' (p. 217). But overleaf, on the one\npage devoted to Dr Rhine, Mr Still has this to say about the ESP\ntests: 'These experiments also go a long way towards shattering\nthe generally accepted doctrine that nothing can enter the human\nmind except by way of the recognized bodily senses.'\nWe are led to assume, therefore, that in the author's opinion,\nonly where the experimental and statistical method produces\nrelatively quick, favourable, and spectacular results is it admiss-\nable!\nThe range of subjects in this book is, of course, such that per-\nhaps one could not reasonably expect a combined historical and\ncritical approach in 276 pages. We are introduced to witchcraft,\nmagic and superstition ; to faith-healing, time, and the subcon-\nscious ; to the divining rod, levitation, and poltergeists ; to\nCopernicus, Galileo, and Newton. So, no doubt inevitably, we\nare left in the end to form our own acquaintanceships.\nAs I have said, this work is mainly a potted history. And judged\nas such it can be readily recommended to those who are just\nbeginning to take an interest in the manifold problems of the\n'paranormal'.\nThomas Greenwell\nJournal of Parapsychology.

The\nfact that some subjects score consistently below mean chance\nexpectation while others drop below mean chance expectation at\na late stage of experimenting is a challenging observation, both\nbecause of its practical inconvenience and its possible theoretical\nimplications. Professor Rhine has made a scholarly study of the\nexperimental evidence on the subject and focusses attention on\nthe problems it raises.\n\fReviews 733\nDr Gertrude Schmeidler has made a study of 'ESP Scores of\nPatients suffering from General Concussion'.

Every study that suggests how\nscores in ESP tests may be improved is to be welcomed, although\na less drastic way of inducing a relaxed attitude than knocking our\nsubjects on the head must still be used in our experimental work.\nThere are reviews of Ducasse's Nature, Mind, and Death by\nProfessor H.

May Bell of Rhodes University, Grahams-\ntown, in 'The Normal Function and Manifestation of Psi', postu-\nlates a trisection of the self into 'Con', the conscious self, 'Uncon',\nthe Freudian Unconscious, and Psi (Thouless-Wiesner). By\ndefinition Uncon and Psi are mutually exclusive.\nSome of the arguments adduced by the author to support her\npostulated framework seem to me to beg the question. Thus, of\ndreams : 'Uncon's repressed desires are, apparently, the motive\nof the dream, but what tidies it up into a nice unshocking story\nthat Con will cheerfully accept? Hardly Con, whose feelings are\nbeing saved, scarcely Uncon, which we are led to think of as\nwholly concerned with getting its desires across to Con. There\nseems to be a censor, with some dramatic ability ; if this is neither\nCon nor Uncon, unless we are to invent further entities, must it\nnot be psi?\n'\nThe interesting paper on precognition by C.

Rhine takes them to task, claiming\nthat their criticisms are irresponsible, inviting them to an open\nforum to discuss the matter, and offering to publish their paper\nin th-t Journal of Parapsychology. Sheffield and Kaufman decline\nthe invitation to a public debate, but promise their paper for\npublication.\nD. P.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Interpretation of ESP Experiments\nSir,\u2014I wish to draw attention to a point regarding the logical\ninterpretation of ESP experiments, which appears to be generally\noverlooked. The procedure used when we infer a causal relation\nbetween two phenomena from a statistical experiment is as follows.\nA set of experimental objects (say, plots sown with oats) is divided\nat random into two or more subsets, each member of one subset\nbeing treated in one way (say, with a certain fertiliser) and each\nmember of another subset in another way (say, with no fertiliser).\nThen we measure every mem.ber of both groups in respect of some\nchosen character (say, yield) and, treating the two sets of measures\nas statistical 'populations', we can calculate the probability on the\ngiven data that the differences between them are due merely to\nthe random segregation of the original set of objects into two\ngroups. If this probability is small enough, we feel confident\nthat the differences are not due to this cause but to the only other\ndifference ive have tnade, that is, to the dift'erent treatments. Pro-\nvided the randomization has been properly carried out (and the\nprocess involves various technical complications varying from one\nexperiment to another) we can attach a definite probability to the\nvalidity of our conclusions.\nParapsychological experiments do not in general conform\nexactly to this type. Their material is not divided into two groups,\nof which one serves as a control ; the place of the control is taken\nby an imaginary set of results obtained by purely random selec-\ntion, and this selection is not really carried out but represented in\nthe calculations by the known statistical parameters of such series.\nWe have in effect two series of guesses, one made by a conscious\nsubject supposedly trying to obtain correct hits, the other by an\nimaginary machine working with mathematical perfection as a\n\f1952] Correspondence '735\nrandomizer. The positive results which have been obtained prove\nthat these two methods of guessing produce different results, and\nin particular that a subject consciously attending to his guesses\nwill very often not be guessing at random even if he have no\nsensory clue to guide him. That is obviously an interesting and\nimportant conclusion. But it involves no more than an associa-\ntion of phenomena, and gives no hint as to the causal relations.\nFor this, a proper control is needed.\nThe mathematical control in these experiments lacks at least\nthree factors present in the 'treated' runs : {a) the experimental\nsituation, {b) the act of conscious guessing, and {c) any special\nmental faculty which may be involved. It is illogical to dismiss\n{a) and (b) lightly ; the anecdotal evidence rather suggests that\nthe experimental situation may influence the results, and it needs\nproof (however plausible it may appear) that a conscious subject\nca7i make a series of guesses statistically uncorrected with the\n'targets'. A more radical possibility which really ought to be\nruled out by formal experiment is that the non-random runs are\nprimary and produced by chance, but that they in some manner\nattract ESP experimenters ;\nput thus, it sounds rather fantastic,\nbut it is really no more contrary to our accustomed habits of\nthought than is precognition, widely accepted as an alternative\nbut narrower hypothesis.\nI am unable to suggest any means of deciding these questions\nexperimentally in the case of psychognosis ; but the case is better\nin psychokinesis, for here one can make a genuine control in which\nthe attention of the subject is the only missing factor. If one\nmakes a hundred runs of dice-throwing provided with random\ntargets, and if ten of these are selected beforehand at random and\na psychokinetic subject called in to influence these only, one could\ntell from the results if the efforts of the subject were an objective\n'cause' of departures from randomness, for if it were not so the\nresults of the 'treated' runs would not differ significantly from those\nof the 'controls'.\nIt is already proven that phenomena occur which do not fit in\nwith our customary habits of scientific thought. That being so,\nwe must give up those habits, to the extent of abandoning common\nsense in the framing of our hypotheses. Until we have reformu-\nlated guiding principles of thought, nothing is too absurd to be\nworthy of formal disproof ; for we may be sure that there are\nstill many absurdities which will turn out to be true.\nA. F. Parker-Rhodes\nMagdalene College, Cambridge\n\f736 Journal of the Society for Psychical ResearcJi [November\nQualitative Material and Theories of Psi\nPhenomena\nSir,\u2014In the May-June 1952 issue of t\\\\t Journal of the S.P.R.,\nW. H. Salter has a note under the above title. In it he refers to\nmy last article in the A.S.P.R. Journal, January 1952, entitled\n'The Psychodynamics of Spontaneous Psi Experiences'.\nMr Salter very wisely warns against what he calls 'a source of\npossible misconception'. He is fearful that my emphasis upon\nexperieticers rather than experiences may lead the reader to draw\nthe conclusion that the experiences need not be investigated. This\nwould be equally unscientific, in my opinion, as the current trend\nto emphasize the experiences to the exclusion of the experiencers.\nA scientific approach to a problem demands that all known\nparameters be investigated as thoroughly as possible. What\nhappens, unfortunately, is that the availability of materials and\nhypotheses, or the personal interest or prejudice of the investi-\ngator, permits one or another aspect to be emphasized or excluded.\nThe trend in psychical research has been steadily away from\nhuman beings. It was against this tendency to ignore the human\npersonality and to see only the 'phenomena' (and quantitative\ndata) that I wished to take a strong stand. I never suggested or\nintended that research work along other lines be stopped. We\nare grateful, therefore, for Mr Salter's expression of concern.\nI am, however, not in agreement with the very tendency against\nwhich I warned even when it appears subtly in Mr Salter's state-\nment. The preference for the experience rather than the experi-\nencer is insinuated by Mr Salter in hiS value judgment that the\npsychological analysis must be held up until 'the laborious first\nstep be taken of sorting out the material under examination into\nveridical and non-veridical'. Efforts at such a sorting process are\ntime-consuming and, at present, result in findings that are of\ndubious reliability, at best. Moreover, the supply of research\nfunds and personnel is very limited. Mr Salter's recommendation,\ntherefore, would in effect perpetuate the barren direction of con-\ntemporary psychical research.\nEmanuel K. Schwartz\nNew York.\nConditions Favourable to ESP\nSir,\u2014It is, perhaps, worth reminding ourselves from time to\ntime that the limitations so far imposed by laboratory technique\non research into the process of ESP are not unlike those suffered\nby observers of wild animals confined in a cage, and also that\n\f1952] Correspondence 737\nspontaneous cases\u2014even though some are chance coincidences or\nspurious\u2014may give us clues to Whipsnade conditions for experi-\nmental percipients.\nThe following incidents, for example, three of which occurred\nduring the last few weeks, demonstrate conditions which have\nsynchronized with apparent ESP in my own family for many\nyears, and which are well known elsewhere. The difficulty of\nincorporating them into planned experiments does not alter the\nfact that they seem to be soil in which ESP appears to flourish.\nIn the first four cases there was sudden emotion on the part of\nthe apparent agent. They might almost be called trivial crisis\ncases. Last month I went, very exhausted, to catch a bus to our\ncountry cottage. It was, for the first time, full up, and only after\nmuch waiting and three changes did I arrive four miles, instead\nof half a mile, from home. I felt far from well and telephoned\nanxiously to my husband to fetch me, but, to my great disappoint-\nment, he was playing golf. Fortunately a stranger gave me a lift\nto the turning where I usually got out of the bus, and, as we\narrived, my husband drove up. 'What an extraordinary coinci-\ndence,' I said, for there was no bus due, I had in any case not said\nwhen I meant to come down, and I had never before wanted him\nto meet me when going to the cottage, and he had never done so.\n'Not at all,' he replied. 'As we finished our game, I felt you\nwanted me, so I refused the drink offered by my opponent, saying\nthat if I hurried I should just catch you, and I came at once.\nI knew you would be here.'\nLast week, again, my husband went away to golf, inadvertently\ntaking the key of our son's car in his pocket. The latter was\ngreatly inconvenienced, and I, rather distressed, suggested tele-\nphoning the Club. He did so at once, and the caddie-master\nreplied, 'I can see the Colonel coming in now.' My husband, on\nbeing called, said that he had come in on purpose, feeling that I\nwanted him on the telephone. (He does not do this on\noccasions when I do not want him.)\nA wave of feeling, however trivial, seems to do the trick in both\ndirections between my husband and myself. On one occasion\nI felt quite suddenly that he needed me, when I was on my way\nhome, having left him at an office for an appointment. I turned\nthe car, rather inconveniently in a narrow country road, and went\nback, to find him leaving the building, having heard that his\nappointment had fallen through and much annoyed at being with-\nout transport home. On another occasion, during the war, I was\nsitting quietly at tea with my mother in the country, when I felt\nsuddenly convinced that my husband had no torch for his walk\nhome from the station in the blackout, on a very dark, unpleasant\n\f738 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nwinter's night. So, in spite of my mother's indignant protests\nthat he had never before forgotten his torch, and why should I\nimagine he had done so now, I walked with a torch to the station.\n'Thank goodness you've come,' said my husband. 'My torch\nwent wrong as I left the Ministry.' Chance coincidence apart,\nthis seems more likely to be a case of response to my husband's\nannoyance at the prospect of an unpleasant walk in the dark than\nof precognition, since a moment later a friend offered us a lift\nhome and the torch was not needed.\nThe following case reminds us of the value, both of a really\ncarefree attitude and of an encouraging atmosphere. An experi-\nenced member of the SPR handed me an envelope, saying\ncasually, 'Can you tell anything from handwriting?' I said, no,\nbut he insisted on m.y trying, as a joke. 'Is it a man or a woman?'\nhe asked. The v\/riting looked very feminine, but I had a sudden\nconviction that it belonged to a man, an extreme homosexual,\nand I gave a fairly detailed description of a type I thought most\nunlikely to be corresponding with my questioner.' He laughed,\nbut said no more than, 'Go on. You haven't put a foot wrong\nyet.' Extremely pleased with myself, I made a few more state-\nments, and I seemed to hear an interior voice make a special\npoint that I should mention that the man liked budgerigars. I\nwas then told that all I had said had been correct and that the\nman was very fond of exotic birds and constantly painted them.\nNext day my questioner telephoned to say that he had had\nanother letter from the man I had described, saying that he\nhad just bought a pair of budgerigars. I feel pretty sure that I\nshould not have got the second wave of facts had I been met with\ndetached silence instead of amused encouragement after the first.\nThe connexion of an entirely casual attitude with success is, of\ncourse, well known. I remember once asking Mr G. N. M.\nTyrrell, who was convinced he was a hopeless percipient, to take\npart in an experiment which I was carrying out, with drawings at\na distance, for the late Mr Whately Carington. He consented, as\na joke, and, to his astonishment, got seven drawings right out of\ntwenty all different. But his later efforts never deviated from\nchance.\nTo save correspondence, may I add that I do not quote the\nabove cases as evidence of E S P . I naturally do not consider them\nfraudulent, though others may, and they may of course all be\nchance coincidences. My point is that, if genuine, they are\nexamples, among many, of cases containing features in common\n^ I have seen the envelope said to have been used in this experiment.\nFor what my impression is worth, I should have said the writing was\nthat of an elderly woman.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f1952] Correspondence\n73^\nwhich might with advantage be remembered when planning\nexperiments.\nRosalind Heywood\nLondon, S.W. i.\nt\nResistance in ESP Experiments\nSir,\u2014One of the psychological factors in ESP experimental\nwork which does not appear to have received much, if any, atten-\ntion is what is termed by psychoanalysists Resistance. This\noccurs when unconscious material attempts to break through into\nconsciousness, and manifests itself in various ways. The patient\nbeing analysed may remain silent, since he is completely unable\nto think of anything to say ; he may be evasive, untruthful, forget-\nful, may make mistakes and slips of the tongue ; he may take a\ndislike to the doctor and even in extreme cases break off treatment.\nThese and other similar mental mechanisms betray to the\ntrained analyst the anxiety\u2014in ordinary parlance fear\u2014itself\nlargely unconscious, of the irruption into consciousness of emo-\ntionally charged material painful to the patient. Similar mech-\nanisms may be detected in normal people approaching the subject\nof ESP, since there is a general fear of the 'Uncanny', that is,\nanything which does not appear to obey the ordinary rules of\neveryday, commonsense life, including such material emanating\nfrom deep levels of the personality as cannot be easily assimilated\nin consciousness. As a lady said to me not long ago when relating\na recurrent dream of a house which she eventually recognized and\nentered in Central Africa, much to her surprise, 'Talking about\nthings like this makes me feel cold down my spine.' In my\nopinion, such frank confession of shivers actually reveals less fear\nthan the hostility to psychical research displayed by many matter-\nof-fact people. This fear of the Uncanny, which is biological,\nhas been fully dealt with by Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell in his writings.\nAt the same time it must not be overlooked that there is attraction\nto as well as repulsion from the Uncanny, and it would be an\ninteresting point to reflect on ; what mingling of these factors\nresults in serious, dispassionate psychical research?\nMy attention was first drawn to this subject of 'resistance' some\ntime ago, when I noticed how frequently reports to the S.P.R. of\nspontaneous phenomena were delayed, and how often letters in\nreply to questions asking for further details and confirmation\nbegan with apologies for not writing sooner. I began to think\nthat this was more than a coincidence. Later, when I became a\nmember of the S.P.R., I observed in myself an irrational reluct-\n\f740 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research [November\nance to report a certain dream which appeared to be both tele-\npathic and precognitive, the circumstances of which were evi-\ndential. I rationalized this reluctance by telling myself that the\nS.P.R. had plenty of material more interesting than mine. It\nwas only some time later that I was able to overcomie this inhibi-\ntion or 'resistance' and report the dream. Freud says : 'It is by\nno means impossible for the products of unconscious activity to\npierce into consciousness, but a certain amount of exertion is\nneeded for this task. When we try to do it in ourselves we become\naware of a distinct feeling of repulsion which must be overcome,\nand when we produce it in a patient we get the most unquestion-\nable signs of resistance to it' (Collected Papers, 1925, pp. 26-7).\nI noticed when I began experiments in card guessing that I\nfelt an unusual and baffling sense of confusion at first, and a\ntendency to forget the instructions, simple as they were. This\npassed off as soon as I became aware that I was resisting. I\nobserved the same air of slight confusion and tendency to make\nmistakes in my friends taking part in the experiments, although\nthey were all persons of high intelligence and some intellectual\nattainment. A favourite gambit was to seize a pack of Zener\ncards as soon as a run of guesses had been made and shuffle it so\nthat the target could not be checked. There was also a tendency\nto lose interest in the experiments if at the first session no super-\nficially interesting scores could be seen at a glance, and to have\ndifficulty in finding time for further sessions. It may be argued\nthat on my hypothesis the less successful subjects should show\nless resistance ; but it is after all the conscious ego who consents\nto take part in the experiments, and a little encouragement keeps\nhim at the task, while lack of success discourages him. Moreover,\nI believe that everyone has psi faculties, and it is probably the\nstrength of his fear which prevents him from scoring significantly;\nhe is like the patient who, finding that nothing spectacular\nhappens at the beginning of his analysis, gives up his treatment,\nsaying, 'There is nothing in psychoanalysis', and is all the time\nsecretly glad of the excuse not to meddle any more with it. The\nreal resistance of the more successful subject sets in later, when\nhe ceases to score significantly and gives chance or negative\nresults. It is as though the psi part of the personality announces\nthat, having given evidence of his existence, he declines to per-\nform any more. Probably the same mechanism works in mediums\nunder investigation, since psi does not appear to wish to give\naway any secrets.\nThe analyst has a technique for helping to overcome resistance,\nwhich may be summed up in one word, reassurance. This is not\nso easy as it sounds, however. It depends upon the transference\n\f1952] Correspondence y^i\n\u2014the formation of an affective bond between doctor and patient\n\u2014a situation which needs skilled handling. Psychical research\nhas no comparable technique yet, although a pleasant and friendly\natmosphere seems to be so encouraging in helping the emergence\nof psi faculties in experiments that in my opinion it is essential.\nIt may be that psychological investigation of 'sensitives', such\nas mediums, automatic writers, and others subject to marked\nspontaneous experiences, will throw light on the problem of\nresistance, and suggest why it should be weaker in some subjects\nthan in others. If, as one suspects, the appearance of psi faculties\nis connected with a tendency to dissociation, one would hesitate\nto apply regularly a technique for splitting a normally well-\nintegrated personality for experimental purposes. The work\nalready done with drugs and hypnosis is interesting, but has\nobvious dangers. As we are all, no doubt, only too well aware,\nthe task of the investigator into ESP problem.s is not an easy one.\nJessie Blundun\nKingskerswell, Devon.\nPsi Function and Psychodynamics\nSir,\u2014An attempt was made in 1947 to carry forward the study\nof psychodynamics, recognising 'psi' as an active entity. The\nnucleus of a research unit was formed. Methods of working were\nbased on techniques and observations made during research in\npsychotherapeutic fields. Basically this consisted of group and\nindividual work, symbiotically conducted, the dream being used\nthroughout as a projection screen to observe psychic processes.\nThis has applied to work concerned with either spontaneous or\nstatistically assessable phenomena, To date, upwards of 1,200\nclinical and research group meetings have been held and over\n50,000 dreams carefully examined and many recorded.\nLong-distance work has now become a very active branch of\nthe unit. The object of this work is still, primarily, the study of\npsychodynamics and the basic techniques are the same. Some of\nthe experiments are with Zener cards, and some are of a more\nspontaneous nature.\nHome or overseas members of the Society who would be\ninterested in such work and its approach, and v\/ho would care to\ntake part in one or other aspects of the work, are asked if they will\nkindly get into touch with me.\nAlice E.
