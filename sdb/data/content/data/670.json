He was most notably a phrenologist, although of a somewhat idiosyncratic bent -- he counted 39 phrenological organs in contrast to the 35 organs in George Combe\u2019s orthodox lists.  This journal was intended initially as a shortlived series of short articles in opposition to the mesmeric pretensions of Dr. Elliotson, proposed to be replaced after a few months by London Monthly Phrenological Magazine, which never saw the light.  Rumball\u2019s contempt for mesmerism focused on the exposure of popular demonstrations of its wonders, insensibility to pain, clairvoyance, and the like.  The journal was intended to cease with no. 9 in September 1844, but Rumball produced a tenth number in February of the next year because \"impositions so public and so palpable have been attempted and detected, that we feel called upon to spread them far and wide.\"  Harvard University; University of Minnesota.      <\/tr>  Issues:Anti-mesmerist N1 May 18 1844 Anti-mesmerist N2 May 25 1844 Anti-mesmerist N3 Jun 1 1844 Anti-mesmerist N4 Jun 8 1844 Anti-mesmerist N5 Jun 15 1844 Anti-mesmerist N6 Jun 22 1844 Anti-mesmerist N7 Jun 29 1844 Anti-mesmerist N8 Jul 27 1844 Anti-mesmerist N9 Sep 28 1844 Anti-mesmerist N10 Feb 15 1845   <\/tr>   \r\n    <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/anti-mesmerist","_id":670}
