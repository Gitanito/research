He was raised as a Catholic, but never felt enthusiasm for its creed. Aged twelve he was briefly a pupil of the Jesuits in Saltillo, Coahuila. Between 1887 and 1893 he attended different schools in France and the United States to complete his general education as a business administrator.\n\nAged 30, he returned to Mexico and took over a family hacienda, which he ran on progressive principles, showing a strong commitment to social justice and philanthropy. An outspoken advocate of democracy, he used his wealth to campaign against the autocratic president&nbsp;Porfirio D\u00edaz, was jailed prior to elections in 2010 and escaped to the United States. There, he called for the violent overthrow of Diaz and, entering Northern Mexico, fought the government at the head of a revolutionary army supported by American arms and finance. The revolutionaries having eventually prevailed, Madero was elected president in 1911. But his moderate policies were opposed by radicals. After a year in office he was ousted in a military coup d\u2019etat and was shortly afterwards assassinated.  Interest in Spiritism and Theosophy\n\nIn 1891, while studying at the \u00c9cole de Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales in Paris, Madero read a few issues of the Revue Spirite founded by Allan Kardec and was deeply impressed by the \u2018beauty\u2019, \u2018logic\u2019, and \u2018rationality\u2019 of the doctrines he found there.2 He read Kardec\u2019s books and joined spiritist circles, where he observed some \u2018interesting mediumistic phenomena\u2019 and discovered his own mediumistic abilities. In 1893, while studying agricultural techniques at the University of California, he became acquainted with theosophical literature of Annie Bessant, Henry S Olcott, and other leaders of Helena Blavatsky\u2019s movement.\n\nFollowing his return to Mexico in 1903, Madero began to experiment systematically as a scribe medium receiving communications in writing, guided by Kardec\u2019s Book of Mediums. According to the memoir he wrote in prison in 1909, he made contact with invisible beings who instructed him about \u2018transcendental\u2019 moral and philosophical matters.3 This inspired a considerable part of the ideological and ethical principles which he set forth as leader of the revolutionary movement known as maderismo.4 &nbsp;He declared that his beliefs concerning the meaning of man\u2019s life on earth, the origins of life, matter and spirit, the immortality of the human soul, and reincarnation, came to him as a result of his conversion to spiritism and theosophy.5\n\nIn 1904 he joined a spiritist circle in San Pedro, Coahuila, and began a long correspondence with similar groups in Mexico and Spain.6 In a letter to a coreligionist Juan Far\u00edas (10 March 1904) he mentions s\u00e9ances where the trances of psychic mediums made clear that magnetism \u2018is a real fluid, capable of producing a weak light when the current is very intense\u2019. He added these details:  \n\nThe phenomenon to which I refer was that, as we broke the magnetic chain that we had formed in the dark, a luminous current formed independently between two of our companions. We renewed the same experience and the phenomenon was repeated, although not with the same intensity as the first time. I\u2019ll pass over other effects that we\u2019ve seen because they are very common in spiritist s\u00e9ances, but this one of which I speak I\u2019ve never seen it described in any book.7\n\nHe was convinced that the truths of spiritism should be propagated for the edification of mankind. Between 1905 and 1908 he held an intense correspondence with theosophists and spiritists, among them L\u00e9on Denis, one of the most popular of Kardec\u2019s followers.8 He contributed articles to Mexican spiritist magazines under the nom de plume \u2018Arjuna\u2019.9\n\nMadero claimed there was no essential disagreement between spiritism and theosophy, but rather the contrary. On 1 January of that year, he wrote to coreligionist Manuel Salamanca:  \n\nTheosophy has the same fundamental basis as Spiritism (the progress of the Spirit through countless incarnations) and the only difference between them concerns the (apparent) origin of their revelation. \u2026 If you study carefully the works of Allan Kardec, Le\u00f3n Denis and Gabriel Delanne \u2026 you will find that they constantly strive to demonstrate the likeness of the spiritist doctrine to the great religions of Antiquity in their esoteric sense. Such esoterism is Theosophy itself \u2026 which for its comprehension constantly demands the development of our moral and intellectual faculties, and wants nothing from us but that we believe in that which our reason admits \u2026 [Theosophy] not only brings us very useful teachings which come from the immense treasures accumulated in Hindu temples, but is particularly necessary in England and the United States, where the huge majority of spiritists do not admit reincarnation, the fundamental base of the Spiritist school led by Kardec, Delanne, etc.10\n\nIn February 1906 he founded the Society for Psychical Studies of San Pedro, Coahuila, to \u2018study spiritism and create circles of research\u2019.11 From their studies he and his partners determined that apparitions, clairvoyance, levitation, miracles, and other psychic or exceptional phenomena were real, physical facts, subjected to fixed and invariable laws. Those facts, he argued, should be examined by the positivist method of hypothesis in order to obtain \u2018metaphysical deductions\u2019, such as a thorough \u2018doctrine of the spirit\u2019 which would serve as a more elegant and logical philosophy than either materialism or Catholic theology. For Madero, spiritism was the one doctrine capable of satisfying man\u2019s most noble aspirations, truly able to solve psychological and social problems.\n\nIn 1908 Madero offered new results of mediumship research at the Second National Spiritist Congress, arguing that spiritism is a \u2018scientific religion\u2019.12 The paper conveys a dramatic, typically Kardecist view of the spirit\u2019s material evolution in connection with Pierre-Simon de Laplace\u2019s nebular theory and showing concordance between ancient hermetic ideas, and the discoveries of modern science.13\n\nIn September 1909 Madero embarked on a \u2018Manual esp\u00edrita\u2019 (Spiritist manual), an exposition of the spiritist creed and an attack on materialistic philosophy. This was published under the pseudonym \u2018Bihma\u2019 in 1911, after he had been elected Mexico\u2019s president. &nbsp;Organized in the form of a catechism, it was \u2018dedicated to the youth, the working classes, and the masses in general\u2019.14 It stresses the reality of mediumship, reincarnation, and the law of evolution which determines the progress of spirits. Psychic phenomena such as hypnotism, telepathy, and mediumship are real because every human personality is endowed with certain \u2018psychic forces\u2019.\n\nMadero viewed mediumship as a peculiar force because \u2018it can only manifest its effects with the cooperation of the spirits who inhabit space\u2019. He considered that every material body is controlled by a spiritual entity, and \u2018spirits follow certain procedures to exert their influence over the inhabitants of our world\u2019. That influence is the \u2018spiritist revelation\u2019 which, along with \u2018scientific experimentation of mediumistic and animistic phenomena\u2019, proves that \u2018in each incarnation the spirit increases its wisdom and virtue, until the moment comes when, being highly developed, it finds its material encasement rather narrow, and so it irradiates outwardly and produces\u2019 all kinds of paranormal phenomena.15  Archive\n\nThe official archive of Madero\u2019s literary legacy is the \u2018Fondo Hist\u00f3rico Francisco I. Madero\u2019, administered by the Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico, OM-DGPCAP. It is here where the bulk of his writings on spiritism and psychic research can be found.
