Monthly\r\n Los Angeles, CA.  Publisher: Crossley Publishing Company.  Editor: Felicie O. Crossley, editor-publisher; Bernice H. Jacquelin, secretary; Beverly D. Hiner, A.B., special correspondent.\r\n Succeeds: Spiritualist Monthly\n\n 1\/1 December 1930.  $2.50 a year, 32 pp.  This was the companion to Crossley's Spiritualists Monthly and differs from it mainly in its emphasis on \"psychic and scientific research\" rather than on doctrinaire spiritualism -- though the distinction is often less than clear.  It contained contributions by Mrs. Hewat McKenzie, Mrs. St. Clair Stobart, Swami Dhirananda,  Horace Leaf, Nandor Fodor, et al, and carried notably an article by H. Duncan McFarland in February 1933 on \"The Truth About the Negro Question,\" on the split among spiritualists (the NSA and the GAS) at their 1927 convention.  On Crossley, see the note under Spiritualist Monthly.\n\n        Issues:Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V4 N5 Jun 1932 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V4 N6 Jul 1932 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V4 N7 Aug 1932 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V4 N8 Nov 1932 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V4 N9 Dec 1932 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V4 N10 Jan 1933 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V4 N11 Feb 1933 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V4 N12 Mar 1933 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V5 N1 Apr 1933 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V5 N2 May 1933 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V5 N3 Jun 1933 Forum Of Psychic And Scientific Research V5 N4 Jul 1933        <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/forum_of_psychic_and_scientific_research","_id":869}
