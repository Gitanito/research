She was an ardent feminist and an astrologer and member of the Advisory Council of the World's Congress Auxiliary of the Psychical Science Congress announced to be held in conjunction with the World Congress of Religions.  Her Up Broadway, and its Sequel.  A Life Story (New York, 1870) advocated \"free love\" (in some non-licentious form) as the antidote to \"prostitution in so-called married life.\"  This journal was largely written by Kirk to advocate and explain her up-beat philosophy of positive thinking.  Kirk also was a believer in the New Thought dream of physical immortality, expounded in Perpetual Youth (1895) and The Prevention and Cure of Old Age (1899)--which taught the power of recognizing the divine, creative Ego in combination with proper diet and fasting--and was the author of The Woman's Way to Health and Beauty (1891), and The Influence of the Zodiac Upon Human Life (1894), which carried an introduction by the enigmatic fraud and sexual mage John Commodore Street.  Interestingly, she also published in 1901 The Christ of the Red Planet, the tale of a vision of Mars and its inhabitants, which antedated Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Princess of Mars by five years.
