His father was an Episcopalian minister, his mother a graduate of Vassar University. He spent much of his boyhood in New England.1&nbsp;\n\nMurphy credited his maternal grandfather and his parents with having opened his mind to parapsychology; they felt there was \u2018something in it\u2019 and had read the literature. Aged sixteen, he read William Barrett\u2019s 1911 book Psychical Research, which he found in his grandfather\u2019s library.2\n\nHe studied at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, then went on to earn his baccalaureate at Yale University in 1916 and his master\u2019s from Harvard University in 1917.\n\nMurphy then entered military service with the American Expeditionary Forces in 1917, serving in France as a member of the Yale Medical Corps until July 1919. He read extensively on parapsychology, encouraged by leaders of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in London and at the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR).3 He particularly admired the works of SPR pioneers FWH Myers and Eleanor Sidgwick4 and was also inspired by the work of the American philosopher and parapsychologist William James.\n\nIn 1921, Murphy resumed graduate work at Columbia University while working as a psychology lecturer, and was awarded his doctorate in 1923. From 1922 to 1925, he served as the Hodgson Fellow in Psychology at Harvard, working with LT Troland at research on telepathy and survival, for which he took part in sittings with the Boston medium Leonora Piper.5\n\nWhile supervising masters and doctoral candidates at Columbia, Murphy began writing the books that would cement his reputation as a prominent voice personality, social and cognitive psychology. Several of his books have been used as textbooks throughout the United States.\n\nMurphy returned to parapsychology in 1934 after a long illness,&nbsp;visiting JB Rhine at the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University and meeting many of Rhine\u2019s associates.\n\nIn 1940, Murphy moved from Columbia to the City College of New York to head its psychology department, also conducting research on the role of emotion and feeling in perception and memory. In 1941, he began collaborating with Laura Dale of ASPR, and the following year taught a summer course on psychical research at Harvard. One student was Gertrude R Schmeidler, who was inspired to embark on a research career in parapsychology, which included collaborative work with Murphy.6\n\nIn 1950, Murphy and his wife Lois (n\u00e9e &nbsp;Barclay), also a psychologist, travelled to India to work as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) consultants to the Indian Ministry of Education.\n\nIn 1952, Murphy left the City College to become director of research at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas. Upon retiring from this position in 1968, he moved to Washington DC, and taught psychology at George Washington University as a visiting professor until 1973.\n\nMurphy was awarded the Butler Medal by Columbia University 1932, and the Gold Medal of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1972. He received honorary doctorates from the University of the City of New York in 1975 and the University of Hamburg in 1976.&nbsp;\n\nHe served as president of the APA in 1944\u201345, and as president of the SPR in 1949.7 He was most active organizationally for ASPR, serving as vice-president from 1940 to 19628, then president from 1962 to 1971. Most of his parapsychological papers were published by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research.\n\nAfter a protracted illness, Gardner Murphy died of cardiac arrest on 18 March 1979 in Washington DC, aged 83.\n\nMurphy was praised as a vastly knowledgeable scientist and also as a kind and considerate man, loved by those who knew him. Parapsychologist Charles Tart wrote: \u2018In our wide-ranging discussions, I was constantly amazed at the breadth and depth of Gardner\u2019s knowledge \u2026 he could grapple in detail with the nuts-and-bolts details of problems, right in there with technical specialists, and then step back and relate the problems to a wider perspective.\u20199 The quality and nature of Murphy\u2019s teaching was celebrated by former student Eugene Hartley in a book of essays commemorating Murphy\u2019s thought and interests. Murphy was consistently voted \u2018best-liked teacher\u2019 by seniors at the City College, Hartley writes, in part because: \u2018[his] respect for human integrity and worth is revealed in all his dealings with his students \u2026 students are people and people are accorded an unfailing courtesy\u2019.10\n\nIn his memory, the ASPR established the Annual Gardner Murphy Memorial Lecture Series, choosing a deserving scientist to receive an award and present his or her work each year.11 The Gardner Murphy Research Institute in Washington DC was also named in his honour.  Contribution to Parapsychology\n\nIn addition to his early investigations of mediumship and experiments with telepathy, Murphy tested such questions as the impact of ESP experimental subjects\u2019 belief in their own abilities on their scores.12&nbsp; He followed every development in parapsychology, as is evidenced by his many books and papers describing the state of the field; he also wrote about its history.13\n\nMurphy laid out parameters for parapsychological science in an entry for the Encyclopedia of Psychology in 1946 that remains relevant today: &nbsp;  \n\nThe most prominent concern of psychical research today may be said to be (a) the study of those psychological and physiological conditions under which paranormal phenomena, spontaneous or experimental, appear; (b) the devising of special experiments which will give maximum opportunity for these special conditions to manifest themselves; (c) the resulting development of a consistent repeatable technique; (d) the discovery by all these means of the laws or principles underlying the phenomena; (e) the eventual construction of a system of knowledge which will bind these principles together, so that all of the various types of paranormal phenomena will make a meaningful whole, internally coherent and in meaningful and intelligible contact with the general laws of psychology.14\n\nMurphy saw psychology and parapsychology as sister fields, and maintained that each has received \u2013 and should continue to receive \u2013 &nbsp;major contributions from the other. For instance, in a presidential address to the SPR given on 8 June 1949,15 he explores the questions of   \twhether psi is a rare gift found only in a few individuals or a latent ability in all (he sees the latter as well-supported by lab evidence) \twhat psychological traits are conducive to it manifesting (ease of dissociation and automatism are two he posits) \twhether belief in psi ability affects psi testing results (it does, to the point that people who disbelieve score worse than chance, using their psi abilities to attempt to prove they have none, as demonstrated by the \u2018sheep and goats\u2019 experiment)16 \thow much the working atmosphere influences psi test results (significantly, in his view) \tthe importance of interpersonal relationships between agents, percipients and experimenters in psi testing (he sees it as crucial).\n\nHe gives advice for productive collaboration between the two fields:  \n\nI would suggest the experiment of looking upon personality as the same subject matter whether it happens to be studied by psychologists or by psychical researchers; that we regard the paranormal as emerging from lawful and ultimately intelligible factors operative within normal personalities; that we regard psychical research and general psychology as interpenetrating and at times fusing, and always sharing outlooks and methods; and finally, since all psychological phenomena are to some degree individualized, that we make the most of all of those methods by which individuality may be studied with a view of trying to understand individual paranormal gifts.17\n\nMurphy considered the existence of telepathy and clairvoyance to have been amply established by spontaneous cases and laboratory evidence. He wrestled with the question of survival, impressed by some of the best evidence&nbsp;\u2013 he could not deny certain apparitional and mediumistic records showed a strong and consistent intent to communicate on the part of the dead18&nbsp;\u2013 but was never fully convinced that it might not be explained in terms of psi in living minds. He chose to explain Ian Stevenson\u2019s cases of the reincarnation type in terms of the \u2018psychons\u2019 theory proposed by British psychical researcher Walter Whately Carington.19\n\nMurphy was steadfast in his insistence that mainstream psychology, and science in general, should pay appropriate attention to rigorous parapsychological science instead of dismissing it. \u2018How far can any science get,\u2019 he asked, \u2018by laying down rules as to what can and what cannot happen? ... The scientific challenge to create a kind of field theory sufficiently open to provide a place for the main parapsychological findings still stands\u2019.20  Select Publications\n\nMurphy wrote more than 25 books and more than one hundred papers on both psychological and parapsychological topics.
