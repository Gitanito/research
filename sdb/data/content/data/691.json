George started as a student and then astrologian in the Portland School of Astrology founded in 1900 by Ida Hulery Fletcher (1854-1919), which originally published this journal.  She was a palmist and astrologer and student of W.H. Chaney's, on whom see the notes under Common Sense, the Philomathean, Spiritual Age, World of Mystery and Science of Life, and the Daisy-Chain.  In 1912, George severed his connection with the P.S.A. (Fletcher changed the name to Portland School of Astrology and Publishing Company, and published the P.S.A. Bulletin) and began the Llewellyn College of Astrology, and Publishing Company originally in Portland and then in Los Angeles, which continued the publication of this journal.  The journal contained the usual astrological notices of favorable and  unfavorable days in the coming month, forecasts, book reviews, explanations of astrological theory, answers to readers' questions, horoscopes for the famous and notorious, etc., as well as serialized works on \"Metaphysics and Astrology\" and the like.  As its advertisement in Azoth, April 1918, proclaimed, the journal provided \"Practical Readings, Interpretations, Predictions, Lessons and Useful Information about National Mundane, Agricultural and Personal Affairs.  Contains daily and monthly outlook for progressive people, based upon planetary vibrations, showing how to work WITH Nature for best results.  Fascinating, enlightening, inspiring.\"  Beyond this usual hodgepodge of material, the journal claimed that it was organized in such a way as to allow the careful reader to maximize his benefit from its offerings if he read it in the proper order:\n\n  \"FIRST, read the Quarterly Business Outlook (Zodia-cause) and Monthly Outlook (Astrocause) wherein the editor deals with world conditions, according to astrology.\r\n SECOND, Favorable and Unfavorable Days in each month.
