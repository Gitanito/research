He was active in parapsychology, both as an experimenter in ESP dreaming and also as a subject, in which he was notably successful.

He served eighteen months in the US Army at Fort Belvoir in the state of Virginia in 1946 and 1947, then pursued studies in clinical psychology. He earned his baccalaureate at Syracuse University in 1951, his masters at the University of Missouri in 1953 and his doctorate at the University of North Carolina in 1959. This was the basis of a successful academic career in dream research and parapsychology, which continued throughout his retirement from university teaching.\n\nVan de Castle taught psychology at Idaho State College, the University of Denver, Dade County Community College (Miami, Florida), Piedmont Virginia Community College, and the University of North Carolina Medical School (Chapel Hill). He was Professor of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry at the University of Virginia (UVA) Health Sciences Center for 25 years.1 Post-retirement teaching included lecturing for the LifeLine program at the Monroe Institute, founded by Robert Monroe, starting in 2003.\n\nVan de Castle completed a one-year clinical internship at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Durham, North Carolina, while working on his doctorate. He maintained clinical practices at the UVA Department of Behavioral Medicine\u2019s Adult Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic, the University of North Carolina Department of Psychiatry\u2019s Psychiatric Inpatient Services.\n\nHis first professional research experience was at the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory, also while working on his doctorate. There he investigated personality correlates of psychokinesis performance and variance patterns of ESP test scores, and also developed a Projective Psi Belief Scale.\n\nAt Idaho State College he did further work on personality correlates of psychokinesis, and at the University of Denver he studied personality correlates of ESP, both projects funded by the Parapsychology Foundation.\r\n \t\r\n \tIn the early 60s Van de Castle began focusing on dreams, working at the Institute of Dream Research for two years, then holding the position of Director of the Sleep and Dream Laboratory at UVA\u2019s Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry from 1967 to 1985. During this time he studied the dream patterns and ESP scores of tribal cultures, concentrating on the Cuna people of Panama.\n\nVan de Castle also worked as an editor and editorial consultant up until 2010, supervising the publishing of thirteen books as an editor for the State University of New York Press. He consulted on sleep and dream-related manuscripts for journals, including Dreaming, Science, Archives of General Psychiatry, Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases, Psychological Bulletin, Psychological Medicine, Sleep, Journal of Perceptual and Motor Skills, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology and book manuscripts for Prentice-Hall and Worth Publishing. He consulted on parapsychological manuscripts for journals including Science, Journal of Parapsychology, Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, and on book manuscripts for Wiley Publishing and Harper and Row.\n\nVan de Castle was invited to lecture, hold workshops, and present exhibits at numerous venues including universities and professional associations all over the USA and in many other nations, and organizations, ranging from the Women of the Judicial 4th Circuit (USA) to the Ontario Institute of Bodywork Techniques, Psychotherapy and Emotional Bodywork (Canada). He presented often for the Association for Research and Enlightenment, founded by Edgar Cayce, and was a regular presenter for the International Association for the Study of Dreams.\n\nVan de Castle was President, Board member or Executive Committee member for the Association for the Study of Dreams, the Virginia Psychological Association and the Colorado Psychological Association. At the Parapsychological Association, he was a Council member for ten years and served as Public Information Officer, Treasure, Secretary, Vice President and President.2\n\nHe died on 29 January 2014 in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA, outliving three sons and leaving two sons and a daughter.3  Dream Telepathy Experiments\n\nOf his experimental work, Van de Castle wrote, \u2018I have been the white-coated scientist attaching EEG electrodes to a subject\u2019s head and face to study his or her sleep and dream patterns, and I have been the pajama-wearing research subject to whom other scientists have attached EEG electrodes.\u20194\n\nHis best-known experimental work as a subject was as part of a series of dream telepathy experiments undertaken at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York, USA, from 1964 to 1978, led by parapsychologists Montague Ullman and Stanley Krippner. The percipients (telepathic receivers) slept in the Center\u2019s sleep laboratory connected to an EEG machine which indicated when their sleep cycles entered each dreaming phase. At this point, the agent (telepathic sender), in a separate room, gazed at a picture, trying to transmit it to the percipient telepathically until the dreaming phase ended. At that point the percipient was awakened and asked to describe any dreams they had just had, which would be recorded. The percipient (and later an independent judge) was shown the pool of eight pictures from which the target picture had been selected and asked to rank them according to how closely they matched the target.5\n\nVan de Castle was among those who distinguished themselves in preliminary experiments as being particularly effective as either agent or percipient. When acting as the sleeping percipient his dream recall proved to be unusually strong. &nbsp;He discussed dream telepathy with a colleague, Calvin Hall at the Institute for Dream Research. One morning he told Hall that he had dreamed of watching a boxing match and cheering enthusiastically for his fighter, which was not a typical dream for him. He then learned that on the previous night Hall had decided to experiment with dream telepathy, trying to telepathically transmit images of a recent boxing match to Van de Castle as he slept.\n\nThe Maimonides study ran on eight nights between January and November 1967. On the first night, the randomly-chosen target picture was Dali\u2019s The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus (Fig. 1). His description of his dreams as recorded included the following:  \n\nSomething to do with motherhood \u2026 A big Mass was going on \u2026 In the church, some of the people seemed to be dressed in the white robes \u2026 some fairly youngish male figure \u2026 It just seemed like it had been sort of a shrine or it had been something of national importance, something of historical significance \u2026 It seems as if the people were wearing the kind of little white frocks that altar boys wear, and it seems that there was a a whole row of these across the front \u2026 It was solemn and dignified and mysterious in a way \u2026\n\nHe also dreamed of seeing an attractive young woman he had recently met, who in the dream was wearing \u2018silky\u2019 and \u2018semi-transparent pyjamas\u2019 which showed her nipples. Finding the Dali painting among the eight pictures, he ranked it as most likely to be the target with 100% confidence.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFig. 1: The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, by Salvador Dali, 1959 (Wikiart).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOver the whole run of eight nights, Van de Castle made five \u2018direct hits\u2019 in the judge\u2019s rankings \u2013 something that could happen by chance only one in a thousand times \u2013 and six in his own rankings, for one-in-ten-thousand odds, far exceeding the results of the second-best percipient.  Legacy\n\nIn his mainstream dream research, Van de Castle collaborated with Hall, considered then the world\u2019s most prominent dream researcher, to create a standardized methodology for objective dream research. This used a comprehensive coding system of hundreds of dream images, as described in their 1966 book, The Content Analysis of Dreams and has since become the standard system used by dream researchers.6 Van de Castle received several major awards for his mainstream work.\n\nIn parapsychology, Van de Castle\u2019s impact has been felt most in dream telepathy research. But he was also active in other lines of inquiry, including fieldwork with the Cuna, the effects of hypnosis on psi, precognitive dreams.\n\nColleague Jean-Marc Emden described him as \u2018a rare and unique integrator of science, research, dreams and anthropology, with unparalleled knowledge that was rooted within the strictest of academia, life and field experience\u2019.7  Works\n\nFor a complete listing of van de Castle\u2019s works including more papers, book reviews, conference presentations, workshops and so forth, see his curriculum vitae.
