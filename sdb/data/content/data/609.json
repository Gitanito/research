WILLY SCHNEIDER.\nEdited by E. J. Dingwall.\nINTRODUCTION.\n(1) Prelimhstary.\nThe following report deals with a series of sittings con-\nducted by the Society with the Austrian medium Mr.\nWilly Schneider, in the months of November and Decem-\nber, 1924. Mr. Schneider is probably the most distin-\nguished of modern continental physical mediums. His\nmediumship was developed early in life, and having had\na long series of sittings with Baron von Schrenck-Notzing,\nhe was soon accustomed to that measure of severe control\nwhich^^. so necessary in experiments of this nature. One\nof th earliest references to his mediumship, accompanied\nby il~astrations which profess to give examjoles of his\nalleged teleplastic phenomena, is to be found in von\nSchrenck's Materialisations-Phaenomem (2\u00ae Aufl. 1923,\npp. 548-602, Abb. 240-244. Cf. Eng. Tr. 1920, p. 335,\nfigs. 221-225). Telekinesis, however, soon became the\n\f2 E. J. Dingwall. [part\nprincipal feature of his mediumship, although it is said\nthat the movements of objects were caused by teleplastic\nstructures proceeding from the body, some of which were\noccasionally visible. Early accounts of these sittings were\npubUshed by von Schrenck in his Physikalische Phaeno-\nmene der Mediumismus (Miinchen, 1920), pp. 102 \u00a3f. and a\nfull detailed survey of his later sittings in Experimente\nder Fernbetveg^mg (Stuttgart, 1924) which includes the\nexamination of the medium by tke Psychological Institute\nof the University of Munich.^\nAfter leaving Baron von Schrenck, Schneider went to\nVienna where he lived with Dr. E. Holub, the head of a\nlarge asylum at Steinhof, where a series of sittings was\nheld. On February 15, 1924, Dr. Holub died suddenly,\nbut Schneider continued living under the same roof as\nhis widow, who moved from Steinhof into the city. Here\nmore sittings were held and a number of scientific mem-\nbers of the University invited to attend. Mr. Schneider\nis not a professional medium, and prefers to sit under\nconditions permitting proper control, laid down by the\ninvestigators. I was. much impressed when I saw his\nwork in Munich in 1922 2 and had long wished for the\nopportunity of seeing more of him. Late in 1924 the\nopportunity arose, and the Society sent a cordial invita-\ntion to Mr. Schneider and Mrs. Holub to visit England\nand hold a few sittings. The invitation was accepted\nand towards the middle of November they arrived in\nEngland, where they remained until December 14.\n(2) The Seance Room.\nThe room in which the seances were conducted was the\nSociety's own laboratory, which is divided from the rest\nof the house by a small ante-room and washin|>^^ place.\nAll account of the room was published in the Jou\\ il for\nDecember 1924, p. 342, which we herewith reprint i, )r the\nconvenience of the reader, together with a photograph\n1 See the review of this volume and the controversial material aroused\nby its publication in Proceedings S.P.R., 1924, XXXIV., 324-332. .\n2 See Journal, S.P.R., Oct. 1922, pp. 359-370.\n\f\f\f7-] Sittings with Mr. Willy Schneider. 3\nof the room to which the account refers. A plan was\npublished in the Journal for November 1923, p. 151. The\nroom measures 17 ft. x 14 ft. and in the photograph will\nbe seen at the extreme right, the note-taker's chair, and\nin front of it, is the note-taker's table, on which are two\nrheostats for the central inverted bowl lights and a box\nfor taking notes, internally illuminated through ruby glass.\nA little to the front and to the left of the table is the\ngramophone, and behind it, a camera on tripod. Above\nthe camera and to the right are two black switches, a\nmaximum and minimum thermometer, and, just above,\na double lamp bracket, with one of the bulbs enclosed\nin a ruby shade. A similar attachment can be seen\non the left hand wall and both of these brackets are\ncontrolled separately by sliding rheostats, one of which\ncan be seen a little beneath and to tlie left of the\nthermometer. Each rheostat is fitted with a sliding scale\nattachment.\nThe cabinet curtains are black satin and slide on rollers\nalong a bow-shaped bar from corner to corner. Just\nwithin the cabinet can be seen the medium's chair in the\ncentre, a little table for experiments, and in the ceiling-\none of the hooks for suspending scales. In front of the\ncabinet stands the magnesium light apparatus, which is\nsmokeless and adjustable.\nThe inverted bowl fitting, suspended from the ceiling\njust by the air grid, has been specially designed for this\nroom and provides upward and downward motion, the\nbowl itself being detachable by means of two bayonet\ncatches. Within the bowl, which is enamelled white\ninside, are four lamps on a separately-wired double series,\ntwo being of ruby glass and two of white glass, and all\ncontrolled at three different points in the room.\nJust behind the arm-chair to the left is the sliding\nshutter which covers the window and effectually excludes\nlight. Heating is provided by a couple of electric radia-\ntors, one of which can be seen behind the note-taker's\ntable. As fresh air enters, stale air is drawn out through\nthe central grid in the ceiling by means of an electric fan\noutside the room.\n\f4 E. J. Dingwall. [part\nIn the present series, owing to tlie fact that the medium\npreferred the same arrangements to which lie M^as accus-\ntomed in Vienna, the chair in the cabinet was removed,\nand a settee with a blue cover was substituted for it.\nThis settee was placed against the back wall, one end\ncoming up to the left hand waU (as seen in the photo-\ngraph) and the other being just on a level with the right\nhand curtain seen hanging behind the tripod. This cur-\nFig. 1.\ntain was drawn in such a manner that its edge hung on\na level with the front edge of the end of the settee on\nthat side. (See fig. 1) Cl and C2 are the chairs of the\ncontrollers who exercised the control to be described later.\nL is a tripod upon which stood a snake lampstand with\nshaded ruby bulb controlled by a rheostat from the note-\ntaker's table ; H is Mrs. Holub's seat, whilst the observers\nwere grouped round the table which stood in front of the\nsettee and usually about 6 ins. distant from it. This\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. Willy Schneider. 5\ntable, over which was thrown a large black cloth, measured\n2 ft. 10 ins. X 1 ft. 8 ins. x 2 ft. 2^ ins. Around the\ntable as seen by the plan, was placed a black gauze screen\nor fence 2 ft. high, which cut off the possibility of the\nobservers' feet and legs touching the table. On the right,\ndirectly in front of the note-taker's table (NTT) stood\nanother table (Ta), on which were j)l^ced the various\npieces of apparatus used during the sittings. These were\nusually under the control of the observer seated in the\nlast right hand chair of the arc facing the wall, and will\nbe described in their place.\n(3) Control and General Conditions.\nThe control of the medium was substantially the same\nas that to whiph he has always been accustomed. As\nMr. Schneider is primarily a medium for telekinesis and\nhas his limbs fully under the control of the observers, no\ndetailed bodily examination was necessary. As a general\nrule before each seance the medium entered the laboratory\nwith two of the observers,^ and there changed his clothes\nexcepting socks and shoes, being reclothed in a suit of\npyjamas and dressing jacket which were his own property,\nbut which were left in the laborator}^ durmg the whole\nperiod of his visit to the Society. He was then led by\nthe hands to his place (M) on the settee which was at\nthe extreme corner on the left, viewed from in front, and\nopposite to him were the two chairs destuied for the con-\ntroUers. These faced the note-taker's table, the medium's\nhands bemg grasped obliquely, the thumbs and the fore-\npart of the hand b}'' the controller nearer him (Dr. WooUey)\nand the ends of the fingers by the next controller (Mr.\nDingwall). His legs were either extended under the side\nrungs of the first controller's chak-, or one was extended\nthus whilst the other was j)laced in front of the chair,\nalthough at all times behind the two legs of Dr. Woolley\nwho sat at right angles to him. Ai'ound the medium's\nwrists and ankles were luminous bands, and on certain\n^In the present series invariably Dr. V. J. Woolley and Mr. E. J.\nDingwall.\n\f6 E. J. Dingwall. [PAR'C\noccasions to be described later, luminous pins were also\nemployed.\nMrs. Holub occupied tlie chair immediately next to Mr.\nDingwall's chair (C2) and in close proximity to the lamp\n(L), the rays from which illuminated the space between\nher and the table (T). During the seances her right hand\nwas held by the sitter on the right, and her left, the\nwrist surrounded by a luminous band, rested on Mr.\nDingwall's right arm. The sitter occupying the extreme\nlight of the arc, and whose duty it was to arrange the\napparatus as required, also wore luminous wrist bands\nround both wrists, his left hand Avhen not in use being\nheld during the seances by the sitter next to him on his\nleft. The note-taker (Mrs. E. J. Dingwall), noted the\ntimes at which phenomena occurred and any other infor-\nmation which it was thought desirable to record. The\naccounts of the seances that follow are the contemporary\nrecords, supplemented only by observations and corrections\nmade by members of the committee during the meetings\nusually held after each seance to discuss the results.\nIt was also the duty of the note-taker to be in entire\ncharge of the lights, both the main lighting of the room\nand the ruby lamp on the front of the table, all of which\nwere controlled by rheostats on her table, Similarly she\nmanaged the gramophone when it was wanted, changing\nthe records and attending to the winding. There was no\nspecial committee appointed for the investigation : persons\nwere invited as seemed desirable, but Mrs. Holub, Mrs.\nJ. G. Robertson,^ Dr. V. J. WooUey and Mr. and Mrs.\nDingwall attended all the sittings throughout the series.\nLater Mr. W. H. Salter became a permanent sitter,\nand to him fell the task of arranging the apparatus\na]id occupying the seat at the extreme right of the arc.\nThe position of the other sitters is indicated in the\nreport.\nIt can hardly be denied that the phenomena occurring\nin the presence of Mr. Schneider have been diminishing,\n^ Mrs. Robertson, who is a member of the Societj', was, owing to her\nthorough Icnowledge of German, of the greatest assistance in communicating\nwith tlio mocliuui and Mrs. Holulj.\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. Willy Schneider. j\nboth in quality and quantity within recent years. There\nis nothmg hke the range and power which v\/ere noticeable\nin 1922 and even later. The phenomena are weaker and\nnegative sittuigs more common. Such sittings in Vienna\nare. not unusual, and although naturally phenomena occa-\nsionally occur which are starthng and rarely repeated, the\nphenomena observed, with a few exceptions are similar\nto those seen in London. The medium and Mrs. Holub\nexpressed their approval both of the methods of inquiry\nand the general arrangements which had been made for\ntheir comfort and convenience.\nThe only phenomena clearly observed were telekinetic, and\neven these were only striking upon a few occasions, which will\nbe described in the detailed record. On November 15 and\n18, vague shapes were seen silhouetted against an object\nwhich moved immediately afterwards, but these shapes were\ntoo fleeting and shadowy to admit any justification for the\nassumption that they were teleplastic structures engaged in\ntelekinesis.\nWithin recent years the demand of the medium (through\nhis control. Otto) for music and noise during the pro-\nduction of phenomena has become increasingly insistent,\nand accordingly the gramophone was played and con-\nversation was kept up during almost the entire course\nof the sittings except at the commencement of each\nwhen the medium was falling mto trance. The noise so\ncaused was an unpleasant feature of the sittings, but\nit may be said that its occurrence in no way weakened\nthe vigilance of the controllers during the production\nof phenomena. The trance with this medium usually\ncomes within a few muxutes of the white light being\nturned off. Respiration increases, and the head usually\nsinks down on the hands of the nearer of the two\ncontrollers. The hands at the same time begin to tremble,\nand this trembling motion continues almost without\nintermission from the beginning of the sittmg until the\nend. During the production of the phenomena the res-\npiration increases in short barking breaths, and while\ntelekinesis is in progress the body often stiffens, and\nup and down movements of the hands occur synchro-\n\f8 E. J. Dingwall. [part\nnously Math similar movements of objects at a distance\nfrom the medium. The sittings usually lasted from two\nto three hours, termination bemg arranged by the control,\nwho says that nothing more will occur, or that the power\nis low, etc. They were almost always in two parts, the\ntime of commencement of the second part being fixed by\nthe control before the medium had come out of trance\nat the conclusion of the first. At the end of the sitting\nthe medium again changed his clothes under supervision,\nand when thought necessary the hair, mouth, etc., were\nexamined. Had the phenomena been teleplastic in charac-\nter the control would have been of a much more severe\ntype ; as it was, a detailed bodily examination was unne-\ncessary, as the possibility of using concealed apparatus\nduring the sitting was rendered so extremely improbable\nthat the feasibility of the medium doing so would have\nto be practically demonstrated before being seriously\nconsidered.^ A further item in the control was a black\ngauze inclosure which had been built for the purpose of\nholding objects which had to be moved telekinetically.\nThis structure measured 4 ft. 8 ins. high, 2 ft. 8 ins.\nwide and 2 ft. 8 ins. deep. A door provided with holes for\ntapes, which were afterwards sealed, closed one side, whilst\non the other was an opening in the gauze extending the\nwidth of the side with the exception of an edge of 3 ins.\nat either side, and 12| ins. deep, the top edge being\nllf ins. from the top. The inclosure was built for con-\ntaining a light wood table covered by a black cloth, on\nwhich were placed various pieces of apparatus as described\nin the records. ^ When in use the opening in the inclosure\nwas on the side away from the observers and at right\nangles to the medium, and the object of the arrangement\nwas that a straight line between the medium's head and\nthe experimental objects should pass through the gauze and\nnot through the window. Lines from the medium's head\nto the window and from the window to the objects on\nthe table formed an obtuse angle.\nThe lighting dixring the seances, as already stated, was by\n1 Cf. Jour. S.P.R., 1922, p. 370, and Proc. S.P.R., 1924, p. 328.\n- For example of its use see Plate II.\n\fPlate II\nTo fact p.

The light was sufficient to illumine\nthe space immediately opposite Mrs. Holub and was\nlowered and raised as desired by the medium duruig the\nsittings.\nIn the reports which follow we shall omit for the sake\nof brevity all the technical details of seance management\nwhich were faithfully carried out, but which have so far\nas can be seen no bearing upon the phenomena. Such\ndetails include observation of the variation of temperature\nof the seance room, which never changed beyond what\nwould be considered normal limits ; barometric pressure\n;\nmeasurements of the degrees of light used ; etc. They\nform part of the Society's official records but are not\nprinted, as from the practical point of view they are but\nof little value to the student.\nDetailed Account of the Sittings.\nTwelve sittings in all were held on November, 12, 15,\n18, 21, 25, 28 ; December 2, 5, 6, 9, 12 and 13. Of these\neight can be considered positive and four negative.\nWe print below the detailed, contemporary records of\nsome of the positive sittings. The records of the negative\nsittings are omitted for reasons of space and are of little\ninterest to any but the most painstaking and careful\nstudent of mediumistic environment and other factors.\nIf any such person desires to consult the original documents\nhe should make application to the Society.\nA selection of pieces was played on the gramophone\nduring the sittings. The word \" music \" has been sub-\nstituted for the name of the piece as it occurs in the\noriginal documents, and the sitters are named in order,\nbeginning with the nearer of the two controllers. Dr.\nWoolley and then continuing round the arc. During\nthe intervals between the parts of the sitting, the medium,\nMrs. Holub and the observers left the seance room,\nexcept that occasionally one or two remained behind with\nDr. Woolley or myself for the purpose of inspecting more\nclosely the arrangements for control.\n\f10 E.

We cannot\nconsider the movements of the table or tlie cool breeze\nto be in any way evidential as the movements could, in our\nopinion, have been caused by the medium's head, and the\nexistence of currents of air ia the seance room, due\nperhaps to the revolving fan outside the room sucking the\nair from the grid in the roof, is so probable that no\nstress can be laid upon these sensations of moving air.\nThey are mentioned because they occixrred, and not because\nw^e consider them in any sense evidence of supernormal\naction.

[part\nThe phenomena at this sittmg ceiitered mainly around\ntiic tambovuine, table, istrips and handkerchief. The\ntinkling of the cymbals of the tambourine cannot, we\nthink, be regarded seriously as demanding the hypothesis\nof the supernormal. The levitation of the strip at\n10.35 p.m. was impressive as was also the levitation of\nthe tambourine a minute later. Similarly the second levita-\ntions of the strips at 10.37 p.m. and 10.39 p.m. were\nremarkable. The cardboard hung horizontally in the air\nslightly shivering as it floated. The hand control was\nperfect, but it is unfortunate that some method of head\ncontrol could not have been carried out successfully,\nalthough we cannot think that any device could have been\nemployed by the mouth for moving the strip. The strip\nnearest the medium was about 17 ins. [43 cm.] distant\nfrom his hands as they lay on his lap under the control\nof W. and D. It appeared noi'mally impossible for his\nhead to reach to the strip without making a twisting\nmovement which Avould have been immediately apparent\nto his controllers.\nSlTTINC4 VI.\nNovember 28, 1924.\nThis was the most remarkable sittiiag of the series.\nThe luminous strijDs were in use as usual, and in addition\nthe medium asked for a luminous cardboard ring which\nhad been prepared. It was about 12.5 cm. in diameter\nand 1.5 cm. wide. A zither, partly painted with luminous\npaint was also employed, but no j^henomena resulted from\nits use.

The\nobservers are agreed that they are unable to suggest any\nnormal explanation of the levitation of the objects, and\nin this connexion part of the notes of Mr. Dexter may\nprove interesting. He writes :\nI measured the distance between the objects on the\ntable and the nearest position into which the medium, by\nleaning over towards the left, could get his head and\nmouth. It was not less than 23 ins. [57 cm.], and to\nget as near as this would entail a great strain and a very\nuncomfortable position for the medium. So far as I\ncould see he did not release his hands or feet at all during\nthe seance. Apart from the most efficacious control, I\nwas in a position to detect any movement of the arms or\nlegs. Madame [Holub] never moved from her position\nthroughout the sitting. None of the sitters could, by\ndirect contact, have reached the objects placed on the\ntable without instant detection. So far, I know of no\nform of reaching-rod or similar implement that could\nhave been used by the medium under the conditions\nobtaining.\nIn discussing the facts which tend to support the\nsupernormal hypothesis he mentions \" the extremely light,\ndelicate movements of the ring. During its levitation it\nliterally hovered in the air like a snow-flake. There\nwere no jerks or shiftings, and it was not gripped or held\nrigidly.\"\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. Willy Schneider. 27\nSitting VIIT.\nDecember, 5, 1924.\nAt this sitting the gauze enclosure or cage was employed\nfurther to isolate the objects to be moved.

Sitting ends.\nThe only phenomena of importance at this sitting were\nthe movements of the tambourine within the cage as\ndescribed in the report. Dr. C. G. Lamb of the Engineer-\ning Laboratory, Cambridge describes the phenomena in\ndetail in a letter to Mr. Stratton, dated December 24,\n1924. He divides the phenomena into two classes, of\nwhich the second can again be sub-divided. We have {a)\noccasional tinklings of the tambourine, very audible, and\non occasi(Mis almost contiruious, and {b) the motion of the\nsame which consisted of (1) a rolling motion about its\nhorizontal axis and (2) a turning motion across its vertical\naxis. From his position Dr. Lamb could observe the\nrolling motion better than the turning, which was more\nvisible from the positions occupied by W. and D. From\nits original position the tambourine rolled about 20\u00b0 after\nslight oscillations, the action being as if the roll were\nstopped by one of tlie cymbals on the tambourine pre-\nventing its completion. It then made a turn of about\nthe same amount and then rolled back a little. In\nsumming up the normal possibilities of this imparting\nmotion to the tambourine. Dr. Lamb observes that \" the\nonly peojde who could have moved the object were (1)\nMr. W. H. Salter after freeing his right hand of its wrist-\nlet and (2) the medium by means of fine threads previously\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. Willy Schneider. 31\nattached to the tambourine and activated by his mouth.\"\nA thread on the cloth would not answer the purpose, since it\nwas observed that the luminous strips did not move ; that\nis to say the tambourine moved independently of the cloth.\nMr. F. J. M. Stratton (Fellow and Tutor of Gonville\nand Caius College, Cambridge) in a letter dated December\n31, 1924, discussing the possibility of Mr. Salter producing\nthe phenomena, says that his impression is that during\nthe occurrences \" both of Salter's hands were holding my\nright hand,\" but he admits that Mr. Salter was the best\nplaced to produce the movements. Unless we assume that\nthe medium has the power of influencing normal persons\nto act abnormally at seances it is difficult to explain the\noccurrences normally.\nThe supposition that Mr. W. H. Salter (Hon. Treasurer\nof the Society for Psychical Research) was responsible for\nthe movements, we can scarcely be expected to discuss\nseriously, and the possibility that the medium had attached\nthreads to the tambourine can be completely dismissed.\nWe have now given an account of representative sittings\nwith Mr. Schneider. On December 6 and 9 attempts\nwere made by the medium to levitate himself completely\ninto the air, a phenomenon reported to have occurred in\nVienna. This attempt failed, however, and the account\nof what occurred need not therefore be printed here.\nIt only remains to sum up our conclusions on the phenomena\nconsidered as a whole.\nConclusions.\nIn considering the nature of the phenomena described\nabove we shall confine ourselves to the movements of the\nvarious objects placed upon the table near the medium.\nThe movements of the table may conceivably have been\neffected by the medium's head, and no doubt it is possible\nthat skilfully directed air currents, after the manner of\nthe production of smoke rmgs, or even actual blowing,\nmay have caused the tinkling of the cymbals on the\ntambourine. Certainly at times the loudness of these\ntinklings and the regularity of the sound did not seem to\nsupport this hypothesis and there is no direct evidence\n\f32 E. J. Dingicall. [part\nin its favour. Evidence of the supernormal character of\nthese movements is, however, also lacking, and thus the\nincidents remain unexplained.\nThe levitation of the rhig and the strips belongs to an\nentirely different class of phenomena. The objections that\ncan be made against these phenomena are that :\n{a) They did not occur at all.\n(6) They did not occur as described.\n{(:) They occurred, but through the normal action either\nof the medium, or Mrs. Holub, or one or both\nthe controllers, or owe of the sitters.\n.Now of these three objections (\u00ab) prcsup2:)oses the occur-\nrence of collective hallucination in the witnesses, and such\na collective hallucination of a body of normal persons\nwithout their knowledge or consent has itself to be\ndemonstrated. We cannot prove it did not occur,\nneither can the objector begin his argument that it did,\nuntil he has shown that it has ever occurred in similar\ncircumstances. Certaiiily it is easy to imagine the inde-\npendent movement of a luminous object in a dark room.\nBut on the occasions when the ring or strip was levitated\nthe observers (a) were able to compare this movement\nwith the immobility of the other luminous objects on the\ntable, and (6) all agreed that the actual movement of the\nlevitated object was wholly different from the apparent\nwaverings of the luminous appearances due to eye-strain\nand similar causes. Thus the first objection can, we\nthmk, be dismissed.\nThe second objection, namely that they did not occur\nas described, is impossible to meet unless the objector\nstates precisely in what ways the movements could have\ntaken place other than those described by the observers.\nSuch observations assume a laxity of control which in\nfact did not exist, and other unwarranted assumptions\nwhich are ruled out by the actual conditions obtaining at\nthe sittings.\nThe third objection concerns itself with possible trickery\non the part of the medium. Now in order to discuss\nthis, the only basis upon which we can argue is that the\nlevitation of the luminous objects must have been per-\n\f97.] Sittings witJi, Mr. WiJhj Schneider. 33\nformed by use of the medium's mouth. Use of the hands\nand feet is definitely exckided by the conditions of control.\nIn order to raise an object 2 to 3 ft. distant from him,\nthe medium must have had concealed in his mouth an\nextensible apparatus workable by the mouth alone and by\nthis means have supported a flat object lying on the table\nand raise it into the air from below. This feat must\nhave been accomplished without any obvious interference\nwith his breathing or speech ; and when completed the rod\nmust have been in some inexphcable manner withdrawn and\nagain concealed in the mouth.i We frankly do not believe\nsuch a device exists, and therefore are driven to the con-\nclusion that the only reasonable hypothesis which covers\nthe facts is that some supernormal agency produced the\nresults. We are fully prepared to abandon this hypothesis\nif contrary evidence is offered. In taking this attitude\nwe have dismissed the other part of the objection which\nwould attribute fraudulent manipulation to Mrs. Holub\nor to one or more of the sitters. During the phenomena\nMrs. Holub's right hand was firmly held by the sitter\non her right, and her left, with the wrist surrounded\nby a luminous band, was on Mr. Dingwall's right\narm. The space in front of her was the best lighted in\nthe room and her form could almost always be seen as a\nsilhouette by the note-taker. For producing the results\nshe was in the worst position of any sitter, and under the\nconditions, we do not beheve that her confederacy can be\nentertained as a reasonable supposition. With regard to\nthe other sitters, the extreme improbability of their col-\nlusion with the medium will be obvious. Thus our results\nwith Mr. Schneider agree with those already obtained by\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing and the Psychological Depart-\nment of the University of Munich. In all three cases\nphenomena were observed which appeared normally inex-\nplicable, and it must be remembered that in the two\nformer cases the phenomena were far finer in quality and\nmore striking in effect whilst the control conditions were\nat least as satisfactory as the}^ were in our sittings.\n^ There are other methods available, but we do not propose detailing\nthem here. They all presuppose the use of the mouth.\nC\n\f3-1 r. .\/. WooUey and E. J. l)ingtvaU. [part\nLUMINOUS AND OTHER PHENOMENA OBSERVED\nWITH THE MEDIUM JANUSZ FRONCZEK.\nEdited by V. J. Woolley and E. J. Dingwall.\nINTRODUCTION.\nThe first point of contact that Mr. Janusz Fronczek had\nwith the Societ}^ was on August 31, 1923, when Mr.\nDingwall had a sitting with him in Warsaw, Poland.\nAnother sitting was arranged on September 3 and a third\nthe following day. The phenomena presented by Mr.\nFronczek are mainly of three kinds : telekmetic, teleplastic,\nand luminous. In Warsaw only the alleged teleplastic\nphenomena and lights were observed. Of these two classes\nthe latter were far the more curious, and we believe they\nare in many respects unique. At any rate Mr. Dingwall\ndeemed them worthy of further attention, and attempts\nwere made to persuade Mr. Fronczek to visit this country\nas the guest of the Society. This was finally arranged,\nand he arrived in London on April 17, 1925, leaving it\non May 20, we think.\nMr. Fronczek is a young Polish mining engineer, and\nalleged supernormal phenomena occurring in his presence\nhave been reported for some years by various observers.\nIn 1924 he was accused of producing phenomena by fraud,\n^\nand from what we have been able to ascertain there were\nsome grounds for this charge. This fact, however, did not\ndeter us from making an independent inquiry, as the\nluminous appearances observed by Mr. Dingwall on August\n31, 1923, warranted careful attention, if only to discover\nthe exact method by which they were produced. These\nphenomena resembled the appearance a green pea would\nhave if it can be imagined as possessing a minute electric\n^ Zagadnienia Metapsychiczne, iii., 1924.\n\f97.] Luminous and other Phenomena. 35\npocket bulb, the size of a wheat grain, concealed within it.\nAt Warsaw the lights always appeared to come from the\nmouth and to remain apparently unsupported in space two or\nthree inches from the lips. The brilliancy of each appearance\nvaried, not only as compared with others but apparently\nin itself when still in view. This remarkable phenomenon\nof a light which increased in brilliance and then grew dim\nseemed so difficult to account for normally that it was\nagreed that a vigilant attention might be fruitful in\nelucidating its nature.\nThe Present Investigation.\nThe present investigation was conducted on similar lines\nto that already described with Mr. Schneider. The same\nroom was used, and the chair seen on Plate I (of the\nSchneider report) was that selected by the medium for the\nsittings.\nBefore each sitting the medium entered the seance room\nwith the two controllers, who, as before, were Dr. V. J.\nWooUey and Mr. E. J. Dingwall. There he disrobed\nentirely and offered himself unreservedly for examination.\nHe then put on fresh clothes, which, after the first few\nsittings, consisted of a pyjama suit and other garments,\nwhich were left on the premises and examined before and\nafter every sitting. His ears, nose, mouth, hair, and\nbeard were examined, and then led by the two hands he\ntook his place in his chair. The observers then came in from\nthe ante-room, the medium's right hand being retained by\nDr. WooUey and the left held by Mr. Dingwall. Dr. WooUey\ncontrolled the right foot and Mr. DingwaU placed his\nstockinged right foot over the toe of the medium's left\nshoe.i The same arrangements as regards note-taking ob-\ntained as before, Mrs. Dingwall acting as note-taker and\ncontrolling the lights, which consisted of two 20 Watt\nfrosted bulbs in photographic ruby shades within the\nopaque inverted bowl seen in Plate I (opposite p. 2).\nThese lamps were controlled by one rheostat on the note-\n1 This shoe was tightly laced and there was no possibility for the mediuro\nto withdraw his foot leaving the shoe on the ground.\n\f36 V.

Generally speakmg the medium soon\nfell into what is claimed to be trance, and from then\nuntil the end of the sitting remained passive and silent,\nnor did any attempts to get into touch with the Control\ngreatly succeed. The medium prefers silence or low\nconversation during the sitting. At times he was subject\nto loud and prolonged fits of coughing which were often\ndisturbing, and vigorous grinding of the teeth often seemed\nto precede the production of phenomena.\nDetailed Account of the Sittings.\nNine sittings were held in all, on April 20, 24, 27, May\n1, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 19. Of these, those on April 24,\nMay 1 and 12 were positive. The number of negative\nsittings is noteworthy, and the small proportion of positive\nsittings greatly increases the difificulty of interpreting the\nphenomena. We print below the full report of the three\npositive sittings, and again, as in the case of Mr. Schneider,\nomit those details of seance management which at present\nappear to have no bearing upon the phenomena.\nSitting II.\nApril 24, 1925.\nPresent (in order from the medium's right hand)\u2014Dr. V.

On the floor, about\n10 cm. from the left hand side of tlie medium's chair,\nis a luminous aluminium hand- bell 6-5 cm. in diameter\nand on the right a tambourine, partly painted with\nluminous jiaint. A luminous cardboard ring, 11 cm. in\ndiameter, lies on the ground just in front of the\nmedium's feet. The medium (M.) wears luminous bracelets\non his wrists.

Bell\nhas moved about 7 cm. away from him.\nNote by Mr. Dingwall.\n\" The phenomena at this sitting were very curious.\nThe luminous objects on the floor had been approved by\nthe medium, who said that telekinetic phenomena occa-\nsionally occurred in his presence. Now, when the bell\nmoved both hands and both feet were fully under control.\nIt was immediately clear that if fraudulent the movement\nmust have been executed through the agency of the\nmedium's mouth. It was manifestly impossible that he\n'could have actually reached the bell with his mouth, and\ntherefore the movement (if not supernormal) would seem\nto have been performed by something in the medium's\nmouth which could extend a considerable distance from\nit. The control excluded the introduction of any such\nlarge object, and therefore the problem resolved itself into\nthe use of the cushion for this purpose.\nNow, practice will eventually teach the observer how to\ninterpret slight movements in the dark. If he knows\nwhat possible avenues to trickery are open, he will\nbe able to appreciate movements in connection with\nsuch trickery which would be meaningless without pre-\ncise knowledge as to the possibilities. In the present\ninstance I knew the moment that the bell moved that\nit was either the cushion or something entirely new and\npossibly supernormal. Therefore I awaited the movements\nin the left hand and body whicli would presumably occur\nwhen the cushion was again replaced behiiid the medium's\nhead. The preparations for the second attempt were clear\nand highly instructive, for the cushion had this time to\nbe employed for moving objects in front of the medium.\n\f97.j Luminous and other Phenomena. 39\nTherefore I was not surprised that at 10.52 p.m. the\nmedium pushed back his chair and did so again at 10.56.\nMovements then took place similar to those before the\nproduction of the first phenomenon, and at 11 p.m. I\nthought that the bell had been knocked over. At 11.5\np.m. I was conscious of further preparations, and at\nll.G p.m. the soft object (i.e. cushion) touched my knee.\nThen the ring moved, and then the medium raised his head\nrapidly as I could feel by the pull of his hand as the\ncushion was brought up and replaced.

A small bright type which was itself a source\nof light.\n2. Illuminated pa.tches on the surface of the\npyjamas due to the incidence of light from another\nsource. These were bigger and less defined than (1).\nR. agrees with this and thinks that (1) were bluish in\ncolour.\nControl of head, liair, and mouth before M. left his\nchair.\nMay 7, 1925.\nAs indicated in Dr. Woolley\"s note the lights seen at\nthis sitting were apparently of two kinds, and certainly\nthey seemed to vary in brilliancy. The flashes which were\nseen at intervals were merely the sudden appearance and\n\f97.] Luminous and other Phenomena. 43\ndisappearance of moving lights which seemed to originate\nfrom the medium's mouth. It appeared to us that the\nmovements of the lights always corresponded to move-\nments of the medium's head, and J\\Ir. Dingwall had the\nsame impression as he received at Warsaw, namely, that\nthe lights were about 1 to 2 inches in distance from the\nlips, their apparent changes in position being due to head\nmovements both up and down and from side to side.\nMr. Guttwoch's observation as to the light seen on the\nnape of the neck is not in the original notes and was not\nconfirmed by any of the other observers. The second\nclass of lights, namely, the illuminated patches seen on the\nsurface of the pyjamas, appear to be accounted for by\nassuming that the light from the small points illuminated\na part of the clothing, and in this case the source of\nlight was apparently turned away from the observers as\nmight be the case if we imagine a sphere from only half\nof which light was projected. The powder taken by the\nmedium at 9.1 p.m. was a preparation brought by himseK\nfrom Warsaw which he called Thiocol {Potassium Guaiacol\nSulpho7iate) . This is a recognised remedy, although not\noften employed in this country. The control both before\nand after the sitting was negative. The powder showed\nno luminosity when moistened, warmed, or rubbed, and\nthe same phenomena were produced later, when the medium\nwas supplied with the drug bought in London.\nSitting VII.\nMay 12, 1925.\nPresent\u2014W. ; R. ; Mr. G.

The first intimation that lights\nwere to be expected was at 9.43 p.m., when Mrs. Robert-\nson saw a small light apparently near the medium's mouth.\nThis was followed for nearly two hours by similar appear-\nances. Throughout the sitting it had been noticed that\nthe medium constantly rubbed his chest with his hands\n(still controlled) and that soon afterwards a light appeared.\nIndeed at 10.18 p.m. Mr. Lambert hazarded the guess that\nthe light came from the hand, a proposition which we\nconsider later. At 11 p.m. Dr. Woolley, Mr. Lambert,\nand Mrs. Robertson saw a streak of light upon the left\nshoulder, whilst Mr. Dingwall saw a point of luminosity\nwithin the mouth. It is probable that what W., L., and\nR. saw was the light proceeding from the point which\nD. localised as being in the medium's mouth, and reflected\nfrom the shoulder, and not that there were two separate\nluminous phenomena occurring together. At 11.18 p.m.\nMr. Lambert reported two small lights, and the other\nobservers confirmed his observation a moment later.\nAt the conclusion of the sitting and when the medium\nsignified that the trance was over, he was examined before\nleaving his chair. The light was put out and W. ex-\namined the interior of the mouth. A light was seen by\nD. similar to those seen during the sitting. G. also saw\nit, but W. reported that he had observed two small\nluminous specks the size of pins' heads which he thought\n\f48 T'. .\/. Woolley and E. J. Dingwall. [part\nwere adherent to the teeth or gums and were much\nfainter than the bright Hght seen during the sittings.\nWe failed to secure these specks, as they were invisible\nwhen the light in the room was turned on. The re-\nmaining sittings with the medium were uniformly negative.\nConclusions.\nIn discussing the evidence secured with the medium\nFronczek we shall confine ourselves to a consideration of\nthe luminous phenomena. We do not believe that we are\nwrong in suggesting that the alleged telekinetic movements\nreported in Sitting II. were normally produced by use of\nthe cushion as described in the notes following the record\nof that sitting. Although we do not consider that it is\njustifiable or logically sound to condemn all the pheno-\nmena of a medium as fraudulent beca.use one particular\nphenomenon is found to be so, we cannot help thinkmg\nthat, in tliese circumstances, other phenomena require\na great deal of evidence in their support before their\nsupernormal character can be seriously considered. It\nmiist be admitted, however, that the luminous phenomena\nproduced by the medium occurred in spite of the examina-\ntion both before and after each sitting. If these lights\nare normal objects brought into the seance room, we\nfailed to discover in vv^hat Avay they were introduced.\nBefore discussing this difficulty, however, it may be of\nsome interest if we sketch very roughly the sort of method\nwhich, if employed, might give the results observed at the\nsittings. Firstly then, it seems to us certain that in every\ncase ^ the lights were closely connected to the medium's\nmouth. In the fourth sitting Mr. Dingwall had the same\nimpression as that which he had received in Poland,\nnamely, that the light was in the form of a small sphere\nthe size of an ordinary pea and attached to the end of\na small stick about 5 cm. in length. In the seventh\nsitting tliis appearance changed, and the observers agreed\nthat it seemed as if the small luminous sphere were\n^ We omit, the instaiico when Mr. (iuttwooli said that he observed a\nlight on the nape of the neck, as no one else observed it, and he may\nhave been mistaken as to its position.\n\f97.] Luminous and oilier Phenomena. 49\nattached to a thread which was held by the medimi^'s\nhps. At 10.20 p.m. on May I- the hght was seen\napparently hanging and swinging from the medinm's\nmouth \"\n(p. 45), and the same observation was repeated\nat 10.34 p.m. The sudden appearance away from the\nmouth was curious and could be explained by an in-\ngenious use of the hands. As has already been said, it\nwas noticed that before the appearance of a light the\nmedium was often accustomed to rub his chest. Now,\nthis rubbing might have served another purpose. For the\nhands ui rubbing the upper part of the chest would have\nformed a convenient screen behind which the luminous\nbody could have been concealed as it dropped from the\nmouth as far as the suspending thread permitted. The\nsudden removal of the hands would reveal it in such a\nway that it would first become visible in the neighbour-\nhood of the chest ; this position for it being secured by\nthe medium lowering his head so that the object hung\nagainst the surface of his garments. Now, supposing that\nthe little sphere were luminous on only half its surface then\na number of phenomena would result from its sudden\ndisclosure. For as it rotated the observers would see\nwhat would appear to be different degrees of light, whereas\nwhat would in reality be observed would be different\naspects of the same luminous body. Similarly when the\npainted haK hung close to the pyjamas the light from its\nsurface would cause a faint illumination of the surface of\nthe material, and thus the single use of one suspended\nluminous object would present a number of different\nphenomena. Now, if this supposition is, at least to a\ncertain extent, accurate, what form would the apparatus\nused to produce the phenomena most conveniently take ?\nIt would appear that all that woidd be required would be\none or two small sphere-like bodies, part of the surfaces\nof which had been covered with one of the higher grades\nof luminous compounds such as are used on the ordinary\ncommercial luminous watch dials. This preparation emits\njust that greenish or bluish light we observed, and being\nfor all practical purposes permanent, would be found more\nconvenient than, ordinary luminous paint which requires tp_\np..\n\f50 V.

The Httle sphere might\neither be plain or enclosed in a transparent sheath, and\nthe whole either fastened to the top of a small piece of\nwood or wire, or on the other hand attached to the end\nof a short piece of thread. The main difficulty in these\nsuggestions is that the medium must in some way have\nsmuggled in his apparatus and that we failed to detect it.\nWe do not. however, believe that the difficulty is as great\nas it may appear. We do not claim to be able infallibly\nto prevent mediums from bringing in such tiny objects as\nthe apparatus mentioned above, and in this particular\ncase failure to detect them would be the more readily\nunderstandable as the lights were produced only twice\nduring the entire series. It is certainly difficult to\nimagine what method would have been employed, but\nprobably it was as simple and as subtle as that of\nmoving the bell and ring in Sitting II.^ Had these\nluminous phenomena occurred at every sitting we should\nhave been able to make a far more detailed study of\nthem, and also of the methods which might have been\nemployed to smuggle them in despite our control. At\nthis point an objection will most certainly arise. it will\nbe asked what right have we to cast doubt upon the\nauthenticity of the phenomena when it is admitted that\nwe failed to prevent our hypothetical apparatus from being\nintroduced ? The answer is that the lights occurring with\nthis medium exhibited no quality whatever incompatible\nwith a supposititious normal origin. Both in their ap-\npearance and their behaviour nothing was observed which\ncould not be reasonably attributed to normal objects\nmanipulated in a manner which was easily j)ossible under\nthe existing conditions. The methods of concealment and\nsudden exhibition ; the movements of the head corre-\nsponding to the movements of the lights ; and especially\n1 It might be suggested that a throat pouch such as vised by certain\nnatives in India (Med. Press and Circular, 1889, ii, 189) was employed by\nthe medium and that this contrihiited to his cough. It was notewortliy\nthat the luminous objects only appeared after the medium had had an\nopportunity of I'aising his hands to his mouth whilst taking his cough\npowder and drinking water (cf. Sitting IV., 9.1 p.m. and 9.10 p. in., and\nSitting Vll, 9.23 p.m. and 9.43 p.m.).\n\f07.] LfimdnoKS and oilier Phenomena. 51\nthe luminous particles in the mouth after the sitting, all\nthese observations tally with a normal explanation but are\ndifficult of any reasonable explanation if the lights were\nsupernormal. On the supernormal hypothesis it would\nalmost appear, as Dr. Walter Prince has pointed out\nin reference to certain alleged psychic photographs, that\nthe controlling agencies, with a malign indifference, had\npurposely selected just those touches in the composition\nof their work which were most likely to inspire suspicion\nin the minds of the critical inquirer.\nWe feel compelled, therefore, to regard the phenomena\nof Mr. Fronczek as probably normal, although we fully\nadmit our inability to explain in precise terms his modus\noperandi. We liad but two opportunities of observing the\nluminous phenomena of his mediumship, and it appears\nto us more probable that our examination of his person\nwas ineffective in preventing the introduction of his\napparatus than that the phenomena we observed were\nsupernormal.\nSummary.\n1. At three sittings out of a total of nine given by Mr.\nFronczek at the Society's rooms, phenomena occurred which\npurported to be produced supernormally.\n2. At one of these three the phenomena consisted of\nthe movements of small luminous objects provided by us\nfor the purpose, and we suppose these movements to have\nbeen brought about by the employment of a cushion held\nin the medium's mouth.\n3. At the other two sittings the phenomena consisted\nof the appearance of small luminous objects, which ap-\npeared to come from the medium's mouth and to be\nattached to it, but we were unable to discover their\nnature or the method of their introduction into the\nseance room.\n\f52 V. J. Woolley. [part\nAN ACCOUNT OF A SERIES OF SITTINGS WITH\nMR. GEORGE VALIANTINE.\nBy V. J. Woolley.\nDuring the spring of 1925 Mr. Valiantine paid a visit to\nthis country as the guest of Mr. H. Dennis Bradley,\nand we were able, by the generosity of one of our\nmembers, to arrange through ]\\Ir. Bradley that he\nshould give a series of sittings to some representatives of\nthe Society.\nSome months previously Mr. Bradley had offered to\nprocure for the Society a definite number of sittings of\nwhich we should have exclusive control and at which all\nthe sitters should naturally be chosen by us. At a later\ndate, however, he became unable or unwilling to fulfil this\noffer, and on the other hand made it an essential con-\ndition of any sittings at all that his friend Mr. Hannen\nSwaffer should be present at all of them. I mention\nthese facts solely because some criticism has been expressed\nby various members of our permitting the attendance at\nour sittings of a journalist who does not even belong to\nthe Society.\nThe mediumship of Mr. Valiantine is mainly of the\n\" direct voice\n''\ntype, though there also occur at his\nsittings numerous movements of material objects (especially\nof the trumpets), and touches felt by the sitters, which are\nclaimed to be produced by supernormal means.\nOur aim in these sittings was exclusively to secure\nevidential material in the utterances of the voices, and we\nmade no attempt to test the method of production of the\nvoices or of any other of the accompanying physical\nphenomena lest such an investigation should hinder this\naim.\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 53\nFor the first sitting we were informed by Mr. Bradley\nthat there should be not more than eight sitters, of whom\nhalf should be men and half women. The four men's\nplaces were thus occupied by Mr. Bradley, Mr. Swaffer,\nMr. Dingwall, and myself, while in addition to Mxs.\nBradley I was able to invite three of our lady members,\nwho came anonymously m the hope of securing evidential\nmaterial. As JVIr. Bradley has since expressed some\ncriticism of the choice of sitters for this sitting, it may\nbe worth mentionmg that to the best of my belief all\nthree are convinced of the possibility of communication\nwith the surviving departed and had proved to be success-\nful sitters with other mediums. For one of them I had\nmyself taken notes at a Leonard sitting a few days\npreviously when very good results were obtained. Further,\nthe Society possessed written records of many of the\nsupposed communications which they had received, but\nthese had not been published and were not Avidely known,\nso that any relevant material produced at the Valiantine\nsitting might have been of great value. Unfortunately no\ncommunications of any sort were made either to them or\nany other sitters, and nothing occurred beyond some of the\nusual physical phenomena with which we were not con-\ncerned for the reason I have mentioned, and the voices\nof two of Valiantine's habitual \" guides who said \" good\nevening \" and \" good night \" respectively.\nAt the second sitting no voices were heard at all, and\nbefore the date arranged for the third sitting Mr. Bradley\nstrongly expressed the view that the sittmgs should be\ntransferred to his house from our seance room, which he\nconsidered for some reason unsuitable. He further asked\nthat for the next sitting there should be a complete\nchange of sitters as far as the Society's representatives\nwere concerned.\nIn accordance with this view the thnd sitthig took place\nas recorded below, the Society bemg represented by Una,\nLady Troubridge, and Miss Radclyffe Hall only.

Dennis Bradley's house, Dormcourt, Kingston Vale. The\nsitting began at about 8.30 p.m. and lasted for about two and\na half hours. The circle consisted of the medium, Mr. H. D.\nBradley, Mrs. Bradley, Mr. Hannen Swaifer, myself, and Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall ; the two latter sitting on behalf of the S.P.R.\nValiantine was well acquainted with all the sitters except our\ntwo selves, and he had been told before the sitting, by Mr.\nBradley, that the two new sitters were Una, Lady Troubridge,\nand Miss Radclyffe-Hall. In any case, we have long since\nassumed that our ajopearance must, evidentially, be taken as\nfamiliar to anyone associated with Psychical Research, and that\nany medium might be expected to recognise us at sight from\ndescription.\nWe sat in total darkness in the morning room. We did not\nmeet Valiantine until we entered the seance room, when we\nwere introduced to him by name. I entered the room a few\nmoments before Miss Radclyffe-Hall, who joined us just as the\nmedium enquired whether we preferred sitting next to each\nother. I replied that it was a matter of indifference to us,\nand that in a circle we always sat in whatever order the\nmedium considered best. As a matter of fact, since we were\nboth aware of the impossibilitj^ of controlling the medium in\nany A\\ay in a completely dark seance and with no conditions\nimposed, the position in which we sat appeared to us un-\nimportant compared to the establishment of a sympathetic\natmosphere that would be favourable to the display of his\npowers, if genuine. We took it that he had probably been\ntold that we were reputed to be careful investigators, and that\nsuch knowledge inight in an}' case introduce an element of\nself-consciousness unfavourable to results.\nI sat on the medium's right, about four feet from him ; on\nmy right Mrs. Bradley, then Mr. Swaffer, next to him Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall, and next to her again Mr. Bradley with the\ngramophone on his right between him and the medium. Just\nbefore the lights were extinguished Valiantine placed two\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 55\ntrumpets upright in the centre of the circle. These were of\naluminium, in three sections, collapsible. Roiind the wide end\nof one was a band of luminous paint and one luminous star,\n^vhile round the other was an identical band with a row\" of\nluminous dots rumring up one side towards the narrow end.\nIn the darkness these luminous marks became clearly visible.\nThe sitters did not hold hands either with each other or Avith\nthe medium. We were, however, told that it was preferable\nnot to cross the legs or to clasp the hands together. Quiet\nconversation between the sitters or with the medium was said\nto be advisable as reducing the tension of expectation and\nreassuring the sitters as to the medium's whereabouts.\nI may say at once that throughout this and all subsequent\nsittings, the medium, who remained to all appearance in a\nnormal state of consciousness, conversed from time to time\nquietly with the sitters and asked no questions that could be\ninterpreted as fishing for information\u2014nor did he do so at\nother times when we met him before and after sittings.\nDuring the present sitting, while we are not prepared to\nstate that he spoke actually simultaneously with any \" direct\n\"\nor trumpet voice, he did on several occasions speak from his\nchaii- so immediately after a voice had spoken through the\ntrumpet or at the other side of the circle or high up in the\nfar corner of the room, as in our opinion to preclude the possi-\nbility of his having spoken in those positions and regained\nhis chair. Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I are also satisfied that on\nseveral occasions the voices came from inside the trumpet in\nsuch a way as could only be produced by spealdng actually\ninto the narrow end or into a tube connected with it. This\nwas corroborated by the fact that when, immediately after the\nsitting, Vahantine and Mr. Bradley asked me to examine the\ntrumpets, one of them, from which the voice terminating\nthe sitting had appeared to issue, was beaded inside its narrow\nend and to some extent down its length with moisture, as it\nwould have been after use for normal conversation.\nOf course Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I both realised from the\nfirst that under the conditions of this dark, uncontrolled seance,\nit would be impossible to form any definite opinion of the\nmodus operandi, but we think it only fair to Valiantine to say\nthat, apart from any evidential value lying in the utterances\n\f66 V. J. WooUey. [PAftT\nof tlie voices, \"we feel that the total phenomena produced at\nthis sitting were beyond what could have been obtained by the\nfraudulent efforts of the medium unaided by any accomplice,\nalthough, had any accomplice been present, the entire physical\nphenomena could have been produced without detection being\npossible. These, apart from the various voices, consisted of\ntouches upon the heads and hands of the sitters, and a rapid\nM'hirhng of the trumpet above my head. My head was patted\nonce, I received three little taps on my left shoulder, and Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall Avas touched on the hand by something which is\ndescribed as feeling like a bunch of bananas. Gramophone\nrecords were played at intervals throughout the sitting, the\nsitters joining in from time to time, and early in the proceed-\nings Valiantine led the circle in the Lord's Prayer.\nThe \" voices \" came in the following order, after two or\nthree records and the prayer :\n1. Voice of \" Dr. Barnett.\"' dee]) and quite loud, ap])ear-\niiig to issue from tlie floor inside one of the trumpets\n\u2014\nn(jn-evidential remarks.\n2. Voice of \" Bert (the medium's brother-in-law),\nfalsetto, from near the ceiling\u2014facetious, non- evidential\nremarks, possibly designed to reduce tension by causing\n\" light reUef.\"\n3. Voice of Kokum, a native of some sort\u2014very loud,\nnon-evidential remarks.\n4. Voice of \" Pat,\" an Irishman of humorous type\u2014non-\nevidential remarks.\n5. Voice of a Sioux C!hief, producing shouts of megaphonic\npotency\u2014non-evidential remarks.\n6. Voice of someone who claimed to be \" Feda,\" Mrs.\nOsborne Leonard's control. It must be noted, however,\nthat neither Miss Radclyffe-Hall nor I thought that the\nvoice or accents bore any resemblance to the \" Feda \"\nvoice familiar to us at Mrs. Leonard's. It sjDoke at\nValiantine's with an American accent and idioms, pro-\nnounced consonants which offer an almost insuperable\ndifficulty to \" Feda Leonard,\" and addressed me as \" Lady\nTroubridge,\" a thing \" Feda Leonard \" has never done in\nover eight years, and a name she would either mispro-\nnounce or achieve with obvious difficulty, since the letter\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valianiinc. 57\nR is her greatest stumbing-block. However, the other\nsitters\u2014whose experience of \" Feda Leonard \" is brief com-\npared with ours\u2014exclaimed that the \" Feda Valiantine\n\"\nvoice was exactly like its prototype. Beyond such evi-\ndence against authenticity as was furnished by the\npeculiarities mentioned above this voice was non-evidential.\n7. Mr. Swaffer recognized a voice and some non-evi-\ndential remarks as emanating from the late Lord North-\ncliffe.\n8. Mr. and Mi's. Bradley exchanged some non-evidential\nremarks with a female voice which they addressed as\n\" Annie.''\nNone of these voices, except the first, used the trumjjets,\nwhich remained upon the floor until they had all spoken.\nShortly afterwards a trumpet rose in the dark to a level\nwith Miss Radclyffe-Hall's face, and the name Alfred was\nwhispered in it several times ; it was acknowledged by Miss\nRadclyfEe-Hall, and was audible and intelligible to all the\ncircle ; it Avas followed by a word that began with the\nsyllable Her. Once it apjDeared to say Herge and upon\nthat name not being recognized some abortive answers were\ngiven to a question by Mr. Swaffer as to how long the speaker\nhad passed over. Answers varied from one to fourteen years,\nand the trumpet fell down. In a moment or two it was up\nagain\u2014still directed at Miss Radclylfe-Hall\u2014and gave the\nnames Alfred Herwood (pseudonym) in a loud whisper quite\naudible to me at the opposite side of the circle, and was at\nonce recognized by me. The trumpet having fallen, I asked\nAlfred Herwood to give me the name of the person better\nknown to him than I Avas and better known to me than\nhimself and who was a link between us. Almost at once the\ntrumpet came to me and the name Francis (pseudonym)\nwas given twice in a loud whisper audible to the entire circle.\nThis was perfectly correct, as I then informed the circle.\nAlfred Herwood was an acquaintance of mine and a friend of\nmy family who lost his life under unusual circumstances nearly\neighteen years ago, and the other name he gave was that of a\nclose friend of his and a relation of my own. This person we\nboth addressed alwaj^s by the Christian name given through the\ntrumpet. Alfred Herwood and his friend, Francis, died within\n\f58 V. J. Woolley. [part\na week of each other, and that friend's name Avas the last\nthing I ever heard him mention. Alfred Herivood has never\nbeen spoken of or purported to communicate with us at any\nother medium, which makes the present occurrence of greater\nvalue. On the other hand, both he and his friend were\ngovernment officials who died under unusual circumstances\nwhich were much discussed in London at the time, and my\nconnexion with them is actually known, if seldom remembered\nor discussed nowadays, to a number of people.\nThe next incident of interest Avas when the trum];)et again\nwent to Miss Radclyffe-Hall and murmured a word in two\nsyllables which she could not catch. Mrs. Bradley said, \" Is it\nyour Mother ?\n\" But the voice said \" No \" to this. The\ntrumpet then came to me, and after several abortive efforts\nI was able to distinguish without doubt the surname East-\nman (pseudonym). This name I acknowledged as known to\nme, whereupon the sound of three kisses were heard in the\ntrumpet, and it rose to my head and tapped it three times.\nI then said : \"I recognize your name, but there are two, or\neven three people living whom you would like to send a\nmessage to. Will you give me the name of one of them ?\nSeveral apparent efforts were made\u2014unintelligible whispers\u2014and\nthe trumpet fell three times to the ground ; then the whole\ncircle heard a whisper :\n\" Give my love to Eastman.\" I re-\nplied :\n\" Correct so far as it goes, but I think you can do\nbetter.\" Presently another effort was made. \" Give my love\nto her\u2014give my love to my daughter,\" and, finally, in response\nto my pressing for the name, the voice whispered quite clearly :\n\" Give my love to '\nX,' \" giving a most unusual Chi'istian name.\nThe giving of the surname Eastman was quite good,\nprovided the medium is held not to have made any enquiries\nregarding our intimate friends, in which event he could natur-\nally have learnt that \" X \" Eastman, who has recently lost\nher mother, is one of our intimates. Evidence purporting to\ncome from Mrs. Eastman has been received by us elsewhere,\nbut although some incidents have been pubUshed the names\ninvolved were all disguised, and such pubhcations would have\nafforded no clue to Valiantine regarding the Eastman\ncomiexion.\nAn interesting feature of this particular incident is that the\n\f97.] Sittings ivith Mr. George Va.liantine. 59\nValiantine 3Irs. Eastman made a mistake which the\nLeonard 3Irs. East^nan has never fallen into. In her life-\ntime Mrs. Eastman was a reserved and far from senti-\nmental lady, who was only slightly known to Miss Radclyffe-\nHall and myself during the last year of her life. At Mrs.\nLeonard's, Mrs. Eastman expresses no particular affection\nfor or interest in us ; her attitude is that we are her only\nmeans of sending evidence to her daughter. At Valiantine's,\nMrs. Eastman kisses me\u2014a thing that she never dreamed\nof doing in life, and at a later sitting addresses me as dear,\"\ntells me she is \" coming home w ith me, \"\nand, in fact, evinces\na strong personal interest and affection which she never felt\neither for Miss Radclyffe-Hall or myself in her lifetime.\nThe thii'd and last attempt to give evidence at this first\nsitting referred to Miss Radclyffe-Hairs father. The trumpet\nwent to her and she was only able to distinguish the words\nYour father,' followed by an unintelligible name. She\nsuggested that the voice might be intended for me, but this\nwas vigorously denied, the voice sajdng quite loudly :\n\" No,\nno, I want you,'' and the trumpet falling to the ground. It\nrose up again however and said, in tones quite audible to the\nother sitters, \" Your father, Radclyffe,\"\" adding a message of\napproval that the sitter was '\"\ninvestigating and trying to prove\nimmortaUty,\" after which the trumpet fell and rolled on the\nground, Mr. Swaffer replacing it upright. Miss Radclyffe-Hall's\nfather has purported to communicate through Mrs. Leonard,\nand on this occasion the giving of his name as Radclyffe\n\"\nAvas rather a good point. The medium remarked at the time\nthat the voice had probably lacked the power to add the\n\" Hall \" and thus give his entire name, but, as a matter of\nfact. Miss Radclyft'e-Hall s father was christened '\"\nRadclj^ffe,\"\nhis full name being Radclyffe Radclyffe-Hall,\"' and therefore\nhe might be supposed to have wished to give his Christian\nname, which Avas probably unknown to the medium. On the\nother hand, in this case as before, the mental tone Avas some-\nwhat out of key, since on no former occasion has Radclyffe\nRadclyffe-Hall shown any particular interest in his daughter\n\"working to prove immortahty,\" and at a subsequent Valiantine\nsitting he purported to be anxious about and to send messages\nto a person who passed out of his life quite seventeen years\n\f60 V. J. WooUey. [PAKT\nbefore he died, to whom he would be most luiUkely to send\nany message, and who would haA^e no wish to receive any.\nAfter the above incidents some remarks from the \" controls\n\"\nclosed the sitting.\nOur second Valiantine sitting took place at 8.30 ]i.m. on\nMonday, March 16, 1925, at Dorincourt.\nThe circle was the same as before, with the addition of\nDr. V. J. Woolley, Hon. Research Officer of the S.P.R., who\nsat between me and Mrs. Bradley. Owing to the extra sitter\nthe circle was more croAvded, and I sat only about two feet\ndistant from the medium.\nThere was a longer delay than on the former occasion before\nthe voices began. The Lord's Prayer was recited and four or\nfive records played before the first voice was heard.\n\"Dr. Barnett,\" \"Pat,\" \" Kokum,\" and \"Bert\" spoke\nbriefly and non-evidentially, and once again there was a voice\nthat claimed to be that of \u2022\u2022\nFeda,\" which spoke as before,\nusing American accent and idioms, and s]3ealdng always in the\nfirst person singular, a thing \" Feda at Mrs. Leonard's does\nonly occasionally, and again pronouncing all her R's Avith ease\nand addressing me as '\u2022\nLady Troubridge.\" Just before this\nvoice spoke a female voice had twice AA'hispered just above my\nhead my name \" Una,\" but seemed unable to say more. Just\nafter that I Avas tapped three times on the head, and tAvice,\nseparately, single taps on the arm nearest to the medium.\nWhen I announced the taps Valiantine enquired which arm\nhad received them. Dr. Woolley Avas then tapped on the head,\nthen Mr. Swaffer and Mrs. Bradley. Miss Radclyffe-Hall was\nnot touched.\nThere followed various attempts to use the trumpets. Voices\npurporting to be those of Miss Radclyfi'e-Hall's father, of Alfred\nHerwood, of my relation\n\u2014\nFrancis\u2014his friend, of Mrs. East-\nman, of Dt. WooUey's father, and of Mr. SAvaft'er's brother,\nspoke at intervals, but added nothing to the evidence given at\nthe former sitting beyond the fact that my relation mentioned,\ncorrectly, his relationship to myself. No test questions were\nrepUed to, and there Avere certain further disturbing factors :\n1. Alfred Herwood persisting in speaking to Miss Rad-\nclyfl'e-Hall, Avhom he never kncA\\' in life, and calling her\n\" dear.\"\"\n\f97.] Sittings wiih Mr. George Valiantine. 61\n2. My relation calling me dear,\"' a term he never used\nwhen addr^essing me, except when displeased ; in fact,\nrarely, if ever, even then.\nOn the other hand, we considered a certain impatience and\nexcitement disj^layed by the '\"\nRadclyffe-Hall \" voice as char-\nacteristic of him and of his manner Avhen communicating\nthrough Mrs. Leonard.\nAlso we considered that, in s])ite of the darkness, we had\nsome opportunity^ of ascertaining that the medium at any rate\nremained seated in his chair when voices were wandering round\nthe circle. He spoke frequently, yawned, moved and breathed\naudibl}^ immediately before or after the voices spoke, much too\npromptly, we thought, to admit of his having spoken and left\nor regained his seat. On one occasion, I am prepared to\nassert that he uttered two or three syllables of comment from\nhis chair before \" Dr. Barnett's \" voice had ceased inside the\ntrumpet on the floor, so that I heard both voices simul-\ntaneously. I was waiting and watching for this phenomenon\nand am certain I was not mistaken, althougli Dr. WooUey and\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall, whose attention I drew to it, had not\nremarked it. Other members of the circle said it had occurred\nearlier in the sitting, but, if so, I did not remark it. In my\nopinion this occurrence does definitely go to prove that the\nvoices cannot in every case be produced by fraudulent efforts\nof the medium unaided by any accomplice.\nThe latter part of the sitting was taken up by a three-\ncornered discussion between \" Dr. Barnett.\" H. Dennis Bradley\nand Dr. V. J. WooUey, in which the other sitters joined\noccasionally, as to whether the test sittings at the Society's\nseance room in Tavistock Square should be resumed, Mr.\nBradley pronouncing himself as stronglj^ against their resump-\ntion. The medium took no active part in the discussion,\nduring which Dr. WooUey invited \" Dr. Barnett \"'\nto state his\nreasons for considering the S.P.R. seance room as unsuited to\nthe sittings. Dr. Barnett appeared very antagonistic to any\nscientific investigation and to any attitude save that of un-\nqualified behef in the spirit oiigin of all the phenomena. He\nsaid that \" test conditions \" and any feeling of doubt on the\npart of the sitters created an atmosj)here that absolutelj''\nblocked phenomena, and that the objections to the S.P.R,\n\f62 F. .\/. WooJIei\/. [part\nseance room lay, not only in ceTlain \" contra])tion.s \" which he\nalleged, in spite of Dr. Woolley's denial, were there, and which\nhe implied, with some derisive laughter, were known by Dr.\nWoolley to be there, but still more in the \" blank mentality\n\"\nof Dr. Woolley himself and other investigators. Dr. Barnett\nvolunteered the remark that he wondered why Dr. Woolley had\never been selected as Research Officer, but he had no remedy\nto suggest beyond unqualified belief, and he refused to accept\nDr. Woolley's repeated assurances that the seance room at\nTavistock Square is devoid of traps or contrivances for the\ntorture and undoing of mediums, or the explanation offered\nthat such simjile ])araphernalia as exist, connected with lighting,\netc., are placed there for the medium's convenience as much as\nfor that of the investigators.\nGeorge Valiantine looked ill and seemed exhausted after this\nsitting, the result, in Miss Radclyffe-Hall's, Dr. Woolley's and\nmy opinion, of the over-heated discussion initiated by\nDr. Barnett, which had gone on during the sitting\u2014in\nwhich incidentally he had taken no ]iart beyond remarking\nthat he was (piite willing to continue the sittings at Tii\\'istoc'k\nSquare.\nThe sitting I'liclcd at about II p. in., and I ascertained\nafterwards that one of the trumpets was dam]\") inside as on\ntlie first occasion.\nAfter the sitting, as on the former occasion, Valiantine made\nno effort to elicit any iitformation from us and impressed us\nfavourably. He expressed himself as quite willing to try and\nsit for Miss Radciyffe-Hall and myself in daylight, with the\nassistance of Mrs. Bradley and lier small son aged, T think,\neight years.\nOur third sitting with Valiantine toolc place at 6.30 p.m. at\nDorincourt on Friday, March 21, 1925. Present, the former\ncircle with the addition of Mrs. V. J. Woolley. The latter had\narranged, at very short notice, to take the place of Sir Oliver\nLodge's secretary, Miss Nea Walker, who had been expected.\nWe, Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I, had been advised of the\nalterati(m by Dr. Woolley some thii'ty-six hours before the\nsitting, and Mr. Bradley had lunched with Di'. Woolley on\nthe day of tlie sittiiig and had been informed of it then. I\ndo uot think', liovvever, that Mrs. Bradley liad been told, or\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 63\nthat she knew that Miss Walker was not coming and was to\nbe replaced by another lady.\nDr. and Mi's. WooUey drove to Dorincoiirt with us and, on\narrival, Mr. and Mrs. Bradley being from home, we three\nwomen went upstairs to leave our wraps. On coming down-\nstairs we found Valiantine at the foot of the stairs, and while\nI was shaking hands with him Miss Radclyffe-Hall introduced\nMrs. WooUey by name to Mrs. Bradley, who was advancing\ntowards us from the front door. There is no doubt that had\nValiantine been attentive and alert to catch names he could\nthen have heard his new sitter introduced as \" Mrs. WooUey,\"\nsince the name was spoken a few feet away from him. Miss\nRadclyffe-Hall made no attempt to conceal the name, as we\nhad been given to understand that no reUance was being\nplaced upon anonymity of sitters in these sittings.\nIt must, hov\/ever, be noted that Mrs. Bradley, as will be\nseen b} the sequel, did not catch Mrs. WooUey's name at their\nfirst introduction, so that Valiantine may not have done so\neither at that time. It is, however, in my opinion, impossible to\nbelieve that he did not hear it later, just prior to the sitting.\nWhen we were all assembled in the drawing-room, with the\nexception of VaUantine, who was preparing the seance room,\nMr. Bradley suggested that Mi's. WooUey should remain\nanonymous to the medium, but upon its being pointed out to\nhim that Valiantine must be talien to have heard her name in\nthe hall, he abandoned the idea of anonymity. Mrs. Bradley\nand I then entered the seance room and found Valiantine there\nalone, placing the trumpets by the electric chandelier in order\nthat the luminous paint should acquire luminosity. I at once\nasked him how we should sit, and whether, if I sat next to\nhim as on the former occasions, Mrs. Bradley might sit between\nme and Dr. Woolley. The mecUum agreed at once, and Mrs.\nBradley added that her husband would sit as usual by the\ngramophone on Valiantine's left, Miss Radclyffe-Hall next to\nMr. Bradley, then Mr. Swaffer, and I added, Dr. Woolley\nnext to you, Mrs. Bradley, and then Mrs. WooUey.\"' IVfrs.\nBradley looked surprised and said: \"Is that Mrs. Woolley?\"\nI thought she was conveying reproof at my mentioning the\nnew sitter's name, so I reminded her :\n\" Yes, Mrs. Woolley,\nyou know we agreed that Mr, Valiantine must be held to know\n\f64 F. .\/. Woolley. [part\nthat it is Mrs. Woolley.\" Mrs. Bradley still looked surprised\nand queried : \"'Is she Dr. Woolley\"s secretary ? And I\nreplied: \"Not tliat I Icnow of\u2014she's his wife\u2014they both came\nwith us in the car.\" And I repeated : She's Mrs. Woolley,\nDr. Woolley 's wife.\" During this entire conversation, Valian-\ntine Avas standing idle, apparently listening, at ray elbow,\nfacing towards us. Under these circumstances I do not think\nthere can be any doubt that he heard and understood the\nentire conversation. I now believe that Mrs. Bradley asked\nthe questions about the secretary, having it in her mind that\na new sitter was expected who was someone's secretary, and\nnot having grasped the alteration of plans.\nAs this conversation ended Valiantine reached down the\ntrumj)ets from the chandelier and, while discussing with him\nthe possibility of designing a trumpet of a better type, I was\nable to ascei'tain that both trumpets were warm from the\nelectric light and quite dry inside and out. I particularly\nexamined the mouthpieces, putting my little finger into the\nnarrow ends. I gave Valiantine every opjiortunity of objecting\nto this inspection by asking him whether it was deleterious to\nphenomena that a stranger should handle the trumpets just\nprior to a sitting. He replied that it did no harm.\nWe sat in the same order as before, save that Mrs. Bradley\nhad changed places with Dr. Woolley and Mrs. Woolley sat on\nhis other side. About eight gramophone records were played\nand the Lord's Prayer recited before anything haiopenecl at all.\nThen \" Dr. Barnett's \" voice was heard from one of the\ntrumpets on the floor, weaker than usual, greeting the circle.\nA short while after \" Bert \" from near the ceiling announced\nthat the conditions were \" exquisite.\" Another longish interval\nof gramophone and then \" Feda's \" voice\u2014still quite unhke\n' Feda Leonard \"\n\u2014was heard very Aveakly calling me \" Lady\nTroubridge \" and speaking with American accent and idioms\n\u2014\na peculiarity not shared by \" Dr. Barnett.\"\nFeda Valiantine \" aimounced that :\n\" Raymond is here and\nwants to speak with Miss Walker.\" This remark was clearly\naudible to the entire circle. After a moment's silence Mr.\nBradley repeated :\n\" Raymond is here and wants to speak to\nMiss Walker?\" Adding: \"Does he think Miss Walker is\nb,ere 1, Can you see her ?\n\" AAd \" Feda replied ;\n\" Ray-\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 65\nmond can, and he wants to speak to her.\" Someone in the\ncircle, I think Miss Radclyffe-Hall, said :\n''\nWho does Raymond\nAvant to speak to?\" And the Feda \" voice answered:\n''Miss Walters.\" JVIr. Hannen Swaffer repeated: \"Walters?\nIs it Walters or Walker ?\n\" And Miss Radclyffe-Hall said\n:\n'\"'\nIt sounded like Walters that time \"\u2014a statement which I\ncorroborate. There was no immediate answer, and Mr. Bradley\nurged \" Feda \" not to go away without further elucidation, as\nshe had \" placed us al) in a very embarrassing position.\" He\nrepeatedly urged that she must continue the subject, and\npresently the \" Feda \" voice armounced once more that \" Ray-\nmond has come to give a message to Miss Walker.\" Mr.\nBradley then said : \"If Raymond can see Miss Walker here,\nlet him take the tnimpet to her.\"\" And Miss Radclyft'e-Hall\nadded :\n\" Yes, take the trumpet over to her.\" Almost as she\nspoke, one of the trumpets seemed to leap from the ground\nand with a violence such as we had not jet observed hurled\nitself at Mrs. Woolley, striking her in the darkness so that she\ncried out ; it then crashed to the ground simultaneously with a\nloud cry from Mr. Bradley: \"That's the stuff, 'Feda,' that\"s\nthe stuff to give them ! Now we've got the real evidence at\nlast ! Now they can't say we haven't given evidence,\" etc.,\netc., and more to the same effect. JVIr. Bradley was so much\nexcited and spoke so loudly that no one else could make\nthemselves heard for some moments, and he gave us the\nimpression of a man wrought up with excitement at the\nverification of his own expectations. So much so that when at\nlast Mrs. Woolley could make herself heard, saying : \" But\nI am Mrs. Woolley,\" IMr. Bradley answered incredulously\n'\nWhat ?\n'\n' And she seemed to feel it necessary to repeat her\nstatement :\n\" Mr. Bradley, I am Mrs. WooUey, I'm not Miss\nWalker.\" Adding :\n\" Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry !\n\" Mr.\nBradley's obvious bewilderment and disappointment were very\nevidently genuine, and very distressing to witness. He im-\nmediately began to display obvious distrust of the entire\nphenomena, and I thought it only fair to Valiantine to inter-\npose a statement, which was endorsed by Mrs. Bradley, as to\n\"VaUantine's having heard us mention Mrs. WooUey's name\nseveral times just before the sitting. Valiantine added quite\nquietly :\n\" Yes, I knew it was Mrs. Woolley.\"\nE\n\f66 V. J. Woolley. [part\nThere followed an upbraiding of the purporting \" Feda \" and\nof the controls by Mr. Bradley, who demanded an explanation\nof the mistake. Then came a perfectly obvious attempt to\nexplain away the error b}^ \" Dr. Barnett \" and the supposed\n\" Feda.\" We were told that the mistake was ours, that the\ncircle had misunderstood ; that Raymond had never thought\nthat Miss Walker was there, and \"'\nFeda \" affirmed that she\nhad said :\n\" Raymond is here and he wanted to speak to Miss\nWalker,\" meaning that he was disappointed at Miss Walker's\nabsence from the sitting. Mr. Bradley pointed out that the\ntrumpet had gone to Mrs. Woolley in immediate reply to the\nrequest that Raymond should use it to indicate Miss Walker,\nand the controls immediately asserted that this had been mere\ncoincidence and had had nothing to do with Raymond, but\nthat a strange spirit who desired to speak to IVIrs. Woolley,\n\" a lady friend \" of hers, had seized that moment to raise the\ntrumpet to her and attempt communication.\nIn order to calm the circle and close what was becoming an\nimpossible and very painful situation, I suggested that argu-\nment should cease and that the circle should again recite the\nLord's Prayer. VaUantine seemed deeply depressed, but he\nacquiesced and led the prayer, almost immediately after which\n\" Dr. Barnett,\" speaking as usual from one trumpet on the\nground, closed the sitting. As soon as the lights were turned\non Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I examined the trumpets. One\nwas perfectly dry ; the other, from which \" Dr. Barnett's\n\"\nvoice had seemed to come, was moist inside its narrow\nend, but not, as on the former occasions, right down its\nlength.\nValiantine made no effort after the sitting to explain the\nmistake\u2014either to exculpate himself or to resent criticism,\nwhich he received freely at sujjper both from Mr. Bradley and\nMr. Swaffer. He still impressed Miss Radclyffe-Hall and myself\nfavourably, although we cannot minimise the imj)ortance and\nextraordinary nature of the occurrence. Valiantine sat next to\nme at supper, drank lemonade and ate heartUy, appearing far\nless perturbed than I was myself. Later that evening he\nagreed quite willingly to try for the voices in dayUght on the\nfollowing Monday with myself and Miss Radclyffe-Hall and\nMrs. Bradley and her little boy.\n\f97.] Sittings ivith Mr. George Valiantine. 67\nII. Lady Trotjbridge's Recobd of Daylight Sitting\nMarch 2.3, 1925.\nAs previously arranged Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I arrived at\nDorincourt soon after 3 p.m. and were received hy Mr. Bradley's\neldest son. After he had entertained us a few minutes in the\ndrawing-room Mrs. Bradley joined us and told us that\nValiantine had not yet woken from his afternoon nap. Siiortly\nafterwards young Bradley went to see if the medium was\nawake, and presently Valiantine joined us in the drawing-room.\nWe all repaired to the morning room and started sitting in the\nbright liglit of a sunny afternoon. A large window extends\nright across one end of the room, and one curtain was partially\ndrawn across one-half of it, leaving an opening of about five feet\nby seven feet through which the light streamed into the room.\nYoung Bradley left the room, and Valiantine, going to a glass-\nfronted bookcase in which were his two trumpets, selected one\nof them (to the best of my belief one that I have seen used\nat former sittings), the one with a luminous star at its wide\nend near the band of luminous paint. He sat down in an\narmchair with his back to the light, having directed us to sit\nin front of him thus :\nWindow.\nV. 1\nM.B.\nU.V.T. M.R.H.\nHe rested his head and shoulders on the low back of the easy-\nchair, Miss RadclyfEe-Hall sat in front of him with the small\nend of the trumpet to her right ear, whUe Vahantine placed\nthe palms of both his hands flat against the wide end of the\ntrumpet, supporting it on his crossed thumbs. In this position\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall could not see his face, though Mrs. Bradley\nand I were both able to do so. For some minutes nothing\noccurred except that Miss Radclyffe-Hall said she could hear\ndull httle taps inside the trumpet, but these Avere inaudible to\nme where I was sitting. However, both Mrs. Bradley and I\nwere satisfied that the medium's hands made no movement.\nPresently the medium suggested that Mi-s. Bradley and I should\n\f68 F. J. Woolley. [part\nleave the room, and that Miss Radclyffe-Hall should see whether\nthings went better if she tried sitting alone with him.\nMrs. Bradley and I went and sat in. the drawing-room and\nwaited. Miss Radclyffe-Hairs record tells what occurred during\nour absence.\nWlien she called me to come in again I took her place at\nthe narrow end of the trumpet, with its orifice to my right\near, but Miss Radclyffe-Hall remarked that she had been sitting\nlatterly with her left ear to the trumpet and that I had better\nadopt the same position. This I hastened to do, being thus\nable to watch the medium's face while I listened. Almost\nimmediately some metallic taps occurred in the trumiDet.\nValiantine enquired whether I did not suffer from facing the\nglare from the -^^indoAv, but beyond that offered no objection.\nHe placed his hands against the wide end of the trumpet as\nbefore, and I noticed that the position was a tiring one for\nhis arms. At my suggestion Miss Radclyffe-Hall fetched a\ncushion and placed it between the chair-arm and his right\nelbo\\\\-, affording him better support, and having done so she\nremained for some minutes kneehng beside him on his right\nand closely watching his hands. Almost immediately small\nmetallic taps were heard in the trumpet close to my ear, and\nrapidly became louder till they were audible to Miss Radclyffe-\nHall and to the medium as well as to myself ;\nthey became\nquite loud and then varied in strength and were given singly\nor in groups of two or three as requested by us, and this in\nspite of the fact that both of us were closely watching the\nmedium's hands, she on his right side and I somewhat to the\nleft. He held his fingers extended so that the tips of all eight\nfingers were visible to us both, and although Valiantine habitu-\nally wears a heavy ring upon one finger, we have been quite\nunable, experimenting with a trumpet, to produce the raps\nwithout showing movement of one or more fingers. Miss.\nRadclyffe-Hall moved round the medium, watching his hands,\nand on one occasion she remarked to the supposed operator\nthat he or she had better do their best since it was very\nimportant for the medium, and that she had her eyes riveted\nupon his iiands. While she was kneeling beside him she also\nasked that the taps, which seemed to be located in the end of\nthe trumpet nearest my ear, should move to the medium's end\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 69\n\u2022of the trumpet, and her request was at once comj)lied with.\nWhen she made the remarlt about watching the medium's\nhands, Valiantine laughed and waggled his t^vo thumbs to draw\nattention to their position, and almost simultaneously the taps\nrecommenced. Except for one sound more like a sigh than a\nwhisj)er I heard no voices so long as Miss Radclyffe-Hall was\nin the room. At one moment the telephone rang and Valiantine\neeemed quite unperturbed and merely asked her to answer it.\nTwo or three moments later it rang again and she had to\nanswer once more and take a message to Mrs. Bradley. When\nshe returned Valiantine suggested that since she had obtained\nvoices when alone with him I might do likewise if she left us,\nand she did so. After a few minutes a voice whispered\nAlfred Alfred (the Christian name given at previous sittings)\nquite audibly and intelligibly, but at a moment Avhen, owing to\nslightly shifting a cramped position, my eyes were not actually\non Valiantine's mouth. He was lying back in the chair with\nhis chin raised, and the trumpet orifice covered by the palms\nof his hands was about two feet from his face, and to one side\n\u2014\nnot, in mj opinion, a favourable position for projecting a\nwhisper do^^n it. Having readjusted my position we tried\nagain, but beyond more taps nothing occurred. VaUantine\nyawned frequently and seemed droAvsy, I thought. He then\nproposed that we should draw the curtains and try in the\ndark. While he drew them he left the trumpet in my hands,\nand I was at full liberty to handle or examine it had I\nthought any purpose could be served by doing so. We sat for\nsome minutes in the dark, but nothing happened, not even\nraps, till Mrs. Bradley summoned us to tea.\nImmediately after tea VaUantine proposed that we should try\nagain, and Miss Radclyffe-Hall suggested that we should sit in\nred electric light\u2014there being such a Hght in the seance room.\nIt was placed on a shelf in the corner of the room farthest\nfrom Valiantine but facing him, so that, after a moment or so,\nmy eyes becoming used to it, I could easily discern every\nfeature and movement of his face. As he wore an ordinary\nstiff collar I could not observe Avhether his throat moved or\nnot, but as he kef)t his head back I could see under his chin.\nI could also see with absolute certainty whether or not his\njnouth was closed. The taps in the trumpet began again almost\n\f70 F. J. WooUey. [part-\nimmediately\u2014Valiantine was now holding only his right hand\nover the trumpet, using the other to shade his eyes from the\nred glow, but the shadow stopped just below his eyes and did\nnot affect the rest of his face. In any case I could see that\nhis eyes Avere often closed and that he seemed drowsy as I tad\nobserved earlier ; he still yawned a good deal. As soon as the\ntaps began again he enquired whether the controls liked the\nred light. Not only were there three brisk taps in the trum-\npet, but as in answer a sharp tap came on the shelf at the\nfar end of the I'oom, just where the red light was standing.\nValiantine laughed and exclaimed :\n\" Listen to that, they seem\nto like the red light ! And almost as he ceased speaking\nanother ta]) came from the same position. Then, with my\neyes fixed on the medium's mouth, which was quietly closed,\nI heard a fairly loud whisper in the trumpet: ''Alfred Her-\nwood.'' I answered : Are you there, I'm so glad.\" And\nthe whisper resumed : \"I am so glad to speak to you here.\"\nDuring these tAvo sentences I am quite certain that Vahantine's\nmouth Avas quietly and firmly 'closed, that his lips did not move,,\nand that his face conveyed no impression of strain or effort..\nI could not, of course, as stated earlier, actually see his throat,,\nbut I think any movement of it would ha\\^e been visible\nbetAveen his chin and collar. Owing to my sitting lower thaa\nthe medium (I had earlier discarded the stool used before and\nwas sitting on the floor) the trumpet was even farther from\nhis face than before, and unless he could articulate those words\nwith closed mouth and motionless lips I am of opinion that he\ndid not speak them. I have tried rejpeatedly before a mirror\nto enunciate the same words and at certain consonants\n\u2014\nb, m, p\u2014I am forced to move the lips quite visibly, while they\nmust remain apart slightly if any Avords are to be pronounced.\nAfter that beginning several sentences were whispered in the\ntrumi^et, some quite uninteihgible, then my name \" Una\nseveral times in a female voice. After this I shifted the-\ntrumpet to the right ear so that I could no longer observe the\nmedium's face, feeling that Valiantine had endured long enough\nthe tension of being stared at. I merely listened to a voice\nwhich claimed to be that of Mrs. Eastman, who had been a\npurporting communicator at the earlier sittings. The voice\nsaid : \"'I wish 'X '\n(her daughter) would come here,\" and\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 71\nsent love to her. It added that the speaker was coming home\nwith me and had often been with me in Sterling Street. At\nfirst I could not catch the name of the street, and Valiantine\nasked the speaker to spell it : the reply was S.T.E.R.L.I.N.G.\nThe voice called me \" Dear,\" and said she was very happy.\nI then closed the sitting, as I thought VaUantine had sat long\nenough, though he expressed his willingness to continue. As\nregards these \" communications,\" on this occasion Alfred\nHerwood did not make any mistakes. Mrs. Eastman, on the\nother hand, was not true to her jDrototype. In Hfe she would\nnever have called me \" dear \" or offered to come home with\nme, since I hardly knew her and there was literally no affection\nbetween us. She was an extremely stately and reserved old\nlady, whom I met only a few times in her capacity as mother\nof an old friend. Through IVIrs. Leonard's mediumship and\nthat of a relation of her own she has given rather remarkable\nevidence, but far from asserting her happiness has expressed a\nfirm discontent and displeasure at having passed over and at\nthe conditions she is expected to enjoy.\nThen, again, Miss Radclj\/ fife-Hall and I do not now live at\nSterling Street, and left that house a year ago\u2014although, and\nthis must be clearly understood, at the time of the above\nsitting we still appeared in the Telephone Dii-ectory as resident\nat that address, as witness the fact that a day or two before\nthe sitting under discussion Mr. Hannen Swafifer had addressed a\nletter to Miss Radclyffe-Hall to SterUng Street, having presumably\nlooked up her address in the Telephone Directory. Mr. and Mrs.\nBradley, on the other hand, \\\\dth whom the medium is living,\nare weU aware of our correct home address, and had they\ncasually mentioned it would not have spoken of SterUng Street.\nI do not think that Mrs. Eastman can be taken to have\nalluded to past days in Sterling Street, since she died not very\nlong before we left it, and would certainly never have troubled to\nvisit us there, except in the event of her daughter visiting us,\nwhich, as it happens, she very rarely did after her mother's death.\nIII. Miss Radclyffe-Hall s Recokd of Daylight Sitting\n]\\Iakch 23, 1925.\nAs arranged at the last sitting, in Dr. Woolley's presence,\nLady Troubridge and I drove down to Dorincourt this after-\n\f72 V. J. WooUey. [part\nnoon, aiTiving at about 3.15 p.m. We talked for about twentj^\nminutes with Mrs. Bradley and her elder son, while Valiantine\nremained asleep upstairs\u2014or so Mrs. Bradley thought. Pre-\nsently young Bradley Avent up to tell him of our arrival, and\nin a short time Vahantine joined us in the drawing-room, and\nMrs. Bradley, Lady Troubridge, young Bradley and I pro-\nceeded with him to the seance room. Mr. Valiantine went to\nthe bookcase and took out fust one trumpet, which he replaced,\nand then the other, which he extended. The trumpets had all\nthe aiDpearance of being the same as those I have seen used on\nthree previous occasions at dark seances ; that is to say, that\neach trumpet had at its wide end a band of luminous paint\n(not luminous in the daylight of course), and one had a line\nof luminous paint dots up one side, the other, the one selected\nby Valiantine, a single star above the band on one side.\nYoung Bradley then left the room.\nMr. Valiantine sat in an arm-chair with his back to the\nwindow, I sat on a stool in front of him, close to his left\nknee, holding the narrow end of the trumpet j^ressed to my\nright ear. Mr. Vahanti]ie covered the wide end with his\nhands, supporting the trumpet with his thumbs. For a little\ntime nothing much occurred, and Mr. Valiantine suggested that\nwe might get on better if Mrs. Bradlej^ and Lady Troubridge\nleft us. This they accordingly did. Almost immediately I\nbegan to hear small indescribable movements inside the trum-\npet, then dull taps that might liave been made by the fleshy\ntip of a finger (they sounded soft and muffled), then one\nmetaUic tap. Mr. Valiantine heard them too and remarked on\nthem, but only after I had acknowledged them. I asked for\nmore metallic taps and got them. I then heard a voice\nwhispering in my ear, I thought it said \" Una \" and told it so,\nasking if it wanted Lady Troubridge, the voice said :\n\" No, no,\nJohnnie,\" and then \" It's your Father.\"\nDuring the A\\'hole of this I could not get a good view of the\nmedium's face or hands, which was most unsatisfactory ;\nmoreover, I fancy that I hear better with my left ear. I told\nMr. Valiantine that I wished to place the trumpet to my left\near as I could hear better, and begged him to cover up his\nend and keep the light well out of it while I moved round ;\nI kept a thumb over my end. I turned on my stool so that\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantvne. 73\nI faced Mi\\ Valiantine completely, and then put the trumpet\nto my left ear. Metallic taps began again immediately. I\nfixed my eyes on Mr. Valiantine's fingers and thumbs. I could\nsee half-Avaj^ doM'n his eight fingers, and could see nearly the\nwhole of his two thumbs which supported the trumpet. I\ncould not detect the least suspicious movement, yet the taps\ncontinued. Some of the taps were given singly, some in little\nrhjrthmical groups. Next came the voice whispering again,\ncalling me \" Johnnie \" and saying that it was my father. I\ncould see Mr. Vahantine's face, which was a little to one side\nof the trumpet, and during the whole time that the voice was\ngoing on his mouth remained closed, there was no look of\nstrain on his face or around his lips, his colour did not change,\nneither could I see any signs of perspiration. Once or twice he\nclosed his eyes for a moment, appearing a little cLrows}^. I\nthought. I s]3oke to him occasionally, asking if he could hear\nthe words. He heard some and repeated them, but some\nneither he nor I could catch, and some that he thought he had\nheard he repeated wrongly. For part of the time he Avas\nleaning back \"^'^ith his head against the chair. The voice asked\nme :\n\" Are 3-ou hard of hearing, my dear ?\n\" Then said\nsomething I could not catch. It then said, \"Tell your mother\nI'm all right.\" And then more inarticulate whispering. I then\nsaid :\n\" Father, give me mother's Christian name.\" And after\nseveral attempts the name \"Marie\" was given, which was\ncorrect. The medium said :\n\" I think he said '\nAnnie.'\n\"\nI said :\n\" No, that's not it,\" but did not tell ]\\Ir. Valiantine\nwhat name had been given. After this there was an un-\nsuccessful attempt to give my grandfather's Christian name, the\nwords being very blurred. Then more taps ! During the\nwhole time that a voice was coming from the trumpet I stared\nat ]VIr. Vaiiantine's lips and they remained Avithout movement.\nOnly after the voice stopped speaking on one or two occasions\ndid iVIr. Vahantine's lips open to address a remark to me or\nto answer a question of mine or to urge a \" Communicator \"\nto try and speak.\nOnce during the phenomena Mrs. Bradley's younger child, a\nsmall boy, burst into the room and was told hy Mr. Valiantine\nto go away, which he did. The A\\hole time we could hear\npeople laughing and talking and opening and shutting doors\n\u2014\n\f74 F. J. WooUeij. [part\nenough, I should have thought, to upset any medium, but\nthrough it all the voice went on speaking, or taps recurred, and\nMr. Vahantine remained quite placid.\nAfter the voice seemed to have departed Mr. Valiantine\nasked if I would like to call in Lady Troubridge. I did so,\nand she sat down immediately on the stool, but placed the\ntrumpet to her right ear as she had seen me do before leaving\nthe room. I told her that I had sat the other way, and she\nimmediately changed round and faced the medium, placing the\ntrumpet to her left ear. I stood at one side watching Mr.\nValiantine. Presently taps began in the trumpet, some of\nwhich Lady Troubridge or Mr. Valiantine declared, and some\nof which were quite audible to me. I fixed my eyes on Mr.\nValiantine's hands, A^'hich I could now see practically in their\nentirety, but the taps continued\u2014I saw no movement of any\nkind in the medium's hands, at least of a suspicious nature,\nsometimes he shifted his hands on the trumpet, but not at the\nmoment of the taps occurring. Once I said : \" Whoever is\nthere, tap loud, please, as this is most important for your\nmedium, I have my eyes riveted on his hands.\" Or words to\nthat effect. Mr. Valiantine kept his fingers extended, and then\nwaggled his thumbs and laughed. Then his hands remained\nquite still, and some low taps occurred in the trumpet and\nwere quite audible to me. At about this stage Lady Trou-\nbridge suggested that if I placed a cushion under the medium's\nright arm it would be more restful for him, and I did so,\nremaining for a few moments kneeling beside him, and while\nthere more taps occurring in the trumpet and seeming to come\nfrom the end close to Lady Troubridge 's ear, I asked that the\ntaps should move to the other or broad end of the trumpet\n;\nmy request was at once complied with, and she heard the taps\nclearly coming from the broad end of the trumpet. Presently\nLady Troubridge discarded the stool and sat on the floor, by\nwhich means the trumpet was lowered and the medium's arms\nin a less strained position. No voice spoke in the trumpet,\nbut early in her sitting Lady Troubridge had mentioned that\nshe heard a sound Like breathing coming from the trumpet for\na moment. Twice during the time I was present at her\nsitting the telephone rang in the seance room. On the first\noccasion the medium asked me to answer it and tell the caller\n\f97.] Sittmgs iviih Mr. George VaUantine. 75\nto ring up in haK an hour's time. Tiiis I did. The second\ntime it rang a message was given me regarding Mr. Bradley's\ncar, and Mr. VaUantine asked me to convey it to Mrs. Bradley ;\nthis I also did. In the end Mr. VaUantine asked me to\nremain out of the room, as perhaps they would get on better\nwithout me, and I compUed.\nA Uttle later Mrs. Bradley went into the seance room to\nannounce tea, and I foUowed her. I found the room in dark-\nness, the curtains having been drawn in order to try and get\nthe voices. After tea Mi\\ VaUantine asked Lady Troubridge to\nsit again, and I suggested that they should sit with a red\nelectric light (one electric globe at end of room facing VaUan-\ntine). My suggestion was agTeed to.\nA record of what then occurred has been made by Lady\nTroubridge, who sat alone with Mi\". VaUantine.\nMr. VaUantine wears a deep gold band on one finger (I think\nthe third finger of the right hand). We have tried to produce\nraps on a metal trumpet like that employed by him, and with\na heavy ring worn, but have failed to do so without movement\nof the whole finger, such movement as must have been clearly\nvisible during the sitting at which the raps occurred.\nWe have tried to produce inteUigible whispers with the mouth\nclosed and motionless\u2014Lad}\" Troubridge is better at this than\nI am, but her Ups have to remain sUghtly open and look puffy\nand her throat moves. Also, her face looks forced and\nstrained.\nAfter the sittings young Bradley asked me to explain the\nsystem of Cross-Correspondences to him, which I did in Mr.\nVaUantine's presence. He seemed anxious to know what Dr.\nWooUey thought of his mediumshij), and I repUecl that we had\nnot yet discussed the sittings. The S.P.R. was mentioned, and\nI told him that Mrs. Piper was their pensioner\u2014Mr. VaUantine\nseemed favourably impressed and showed no antagonism towards\nthe Society. He said that he thought Mrs. Salter [who\nhad been present at one of the earlier sittings] a most\nsympathetic sitter, and again repeated that he personally had\nbeen quite wiUing to continue the S.P.R. test sittings. Mrs.\nBradley suggested that he might try again with them later on,\nand VaUantine repUed that he might do so on his return from\nAmerica in three months' time. Lady Troubridge and I did\n\f76 V. J.

Note by Lady Troubridge.\nTwo points struck us some time after the above sittings\nregarding which we shoiild have liked to question Mr. Valian-\ntine, but we have not since had the opportunity of seeing him.\nThe first point is why, in view of the fact that at the dark\nseances the trumpets are used with the wide end towards the\nsitter's ear and the narrow or mouthpiece end to^^'ards the\nsupposed communicators, the reverse should be the case at\nthe daylight sittings, when the mouthpiece of the trumpet is\nplaced to the sitter's ear and the broad end is apparently\nthe \" receiver \" of voices and raps.\nThe second point is : In view of the fact that we were told\nit was important to concentrate darkness ^\\'ithin the trumpet,\nA\\'hy does IVIr. Valiantine sit so that the ^^\u2022ide end of the\ntrumjoet\u2014the least easy to cover\u2014should be towards the strong\nlight of the window. If the medium M^ould sit sideways to, or\nfacing the light\u2014or, alternativel3% if the trumpet \\vere used as\n<at the dark seances with its wide end towards the sitter,\nkeeping the interior dark -would be a comparatively easy\njnatter\u2014also, the wide end of the trumpet being towards the\nmedium tends to collect extraneous sounds such as the move-\nments of the medium, rustling of his clothes, and wliilp tli<i\nfact remains that unless the medium utters the words heard in\nthe trumpet, their existence remains unexjjlained, the wide end\nof the trumpet being towards the medium might give rise to\nsus]3icion in the event of inadequate light, or of the sitter\nbeing doubtful of his powers of observation. In future experi-\nments we would therefore suggest to Mr. Valiantine that he\nshould trj and sit with the trumijet in the normal jjosition,\ni.e. mouthpiece toAvards himself and the window and wide end\ntowards the darkness and the sitter's ear.\nUna V. Troubridge.\n\f97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 77\nThe last sitting of our series was a daylight sitting given\nto Mr. DingAvall and myself on April 7, and the conditions\nwere the same as those of the one last described by Lady\nTroiibridge.\nBoth of us heard raps which seemed similar to those she\nhas described, but as I wish only to deal in this account with\nevidential utterances I do not propose to consider them in\nfurther detail. Both of us also heard whispering sounds,\napparently m the trumpet, at times when we are con-\nvinced that Mr. Valiantine 's lips were entirely closed, and\nI was able also to distinguish the words \" Father WooUey,\"\nbut nothing further.\nIn considering the series as a whole there is very little\nthat can be added to the accoiint given by Lady Trou-\nbiidge and Miss Radclyft'e-Hall, who, indeed, received the\nonly evidential communications, and who have included in\ntheir account the necessary commentary. The remarkable\nincident that closed the last dark sitting is very difficult\nto account for on any theory, and it is much to be\nregretted that Mr. Bradley's impetuous misinterpretation of\nthe facts brought the sittuig to an end before the error\ncould be properly elucidated.\nIt is, however, certain that the speaking intelligence\nwhich called itself Feda did actually mistake another\nsitter for the Miss Walker who had been expected, and\nit is possible to suppose that it may have been influenced\nto do so by a belief in the mind of the medium or of some\nsitter that Miss Walker had actually been introduced under\na pseudonym. The powerful effect which such beliefs have\nujDon mediumistic communications is well established in the\nrecent paper by Mr. S. G.

J. Dingwall.\nFOREWORD.\nBefore dealing with my experienpes of the Margery\nmediumship, I wish publicly to express my thanks to\ncertain persons who rendered those experiences possible.\nFirstly then, I wish to thank Margery herself for so\nkindly permitting me to attend the sittings as a privi-\nleged guest, and also to F. H., the husband of the\nmedium, I wish likewise to express my appreciation of\nhis kindly hospitality. To Mrs. Aiigustus Hemenway\nalso I must tender my sincerest thanks for her royal\nhospitality and kindness, without which this inquiry\ncould never have been attempted. I also wish to acknow-\nledge gratefully the encouragement, advice, and other help\nso freely given me by Dr. Elwood Worcester, Dr. Gardner\nMurphy, Dr. Mark Richardson, and others too numerous\nto mention.\nIt will be understood that the sittings to be described\nwere placed by Dr. Crandon under my supervision, sub-\nject to certain agreed conditions which I will in due course\ndescribe.\n\f80 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nINTRODUCTION.\nPreliminary.\nThe following report concerns a case of alleged physical\nmediumship, which is perhaps the most important of its\nkind hitherto presented for the consideration of psychical\nresearchers. It first attracted my immediate attention on\nDecember 16, 1923, when the medium, Mrs. L. R. G.\nCrandon (hereafter called Margery) and her husband (here-\nafter called F. H.) visited London and held a sitthig in\nmy room at the Society for Psychical Research. At this\nsitting occurred a table levitation in full white light which\nwas capable of but two interpretations. The first hypo-\nthesis was that the movement was due to some super-\nnormal action, and the second was that it was caused\nnormally by the medium, by her husband, by both in\ncombination, or by one or more of the sitters. Now this\nlevitation was very striking, and, if fraudulent, involved\nsome skill in its performance. If supernormal, on the\nother hand, the phenomenon was important as an indi-\ncation of remarkable incipient mediumship, and from that\ndate I followed the case as far as I was able to do so\nfrom published accounts and from letters received at in-\ntervals from the United States. My interest in the case\ngrew rapidly when I learnt that Margery had entered for\nthe $2500 prize offered by the Scientific American maga-\nzine. Throughout the summer of 1924 I had been trying\nto see whether arrangements could be made for me to\nvisit the United States in order to call upon the medium\nand make a first hand acquaintance with the phenomena\noccurring in her presence. This was finally made possible\nthrough the great kindness and generosity of one of our\nBoston members, well known for her sustained and\nimpartial interest in the scientific aspect of psychical\nresearch.\nBefore deahng with the sittings I attended, short bio-\ngraphical sketches of the parties concerned may be of\ninterest, and for this purpose I have received permission\n\f98] ivitli the Medium Margery. 81\nfrom P. H. to insert those supplied by him to the Journal\nof the A.S.P.R., March 1925.\nMina Stinson Crandon was born near Toronto and received\nher early training and education there. Her health and psy-\nchology have always been normal. She graduated with good\nstanding in all her classes. She had one year of Latin and\none year of French, but outside of that has studied no\nlanguages.\nAt about the age of seventeen she came to Boston and\nbecame secretary to one of the larger churches. She is married\nand has one child, and is in perfect health physically and\nmentaUy.\nShe was five years younger than her brother Walter, who\npassed over in 1911 at the age of twenty-eight years. He was\ninjured by a locomotive and survived the injury only three\nhours.\nIn his youth Walter Stinson had tables tilt and levitate, in\nhis presence, in daylight. This was looked on as a diversion\nand never taken seriously. His mother, who is still living,\nover seventy-five years of age, has been able for years to do\nautomatic writing.\nSince this mediumship began, Margery has continued to be\nin apparently perfect health and suffers some, but not great,\nreaction after sittings which involve deep trance and the so-\ncalled higher physical phenomena.\nDr. L. R. G. Crandon was born in Boston. His mother\ncame from a healthy, energetic family from Maine ; her brother\nwas Rear-Admiral J. E. Pillsbury, U.S. Navy. Her father's\nfamily came from Plymouth, Mass., a direct descendant from\ntwenty-three of the origmal Mayfloiver passengers. His great-\ngrandfather was Collector of the Port of Plymouth for thirty\nyears, appomted by Washington. His father is President of\nthe Boston Ethical Society.\nDr. Crandon graduated from Harvard CoUege in 1894, re-\nceived his M.D. degree m 1898, and an A.M. from Harvard\nin Philosophy m 1909. He has been, and still is, in the\npractice of surgery m Boston. He is m no way psychic, but\nis deeply interested in the matter from the points of view of\nthe physician, the psychologist, and the philosopher.\n\f82 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nThe early history of the Margery mediumship is described\nby Dr. Crandon in the same number of the Journal as\nfollows :\nMargery's husband first became interested in psychical re-\nsearch in 1923 when he read On the Threshold of the Unseen,\nby Sir William Barrett, and Crawford's four books on the\nreality of psychic phenomena.\nAbout June 1, 1923, a rough wooden table without nails,\nafter the specifications of Crawford, was made for the \" Margery\n\"\nhousehold, and six people sat round it in red light as an\nexperiment. Successful tilting was obtained almost at once,\nand by the simple process of ehmtnation it was found to occur\nonly in the presence of Margery, though she need not be\nin contact with the table. A code of communication with the\npossible operators was at once estabhshed, and apparent identity\nof several discarnate relatives of the people about the table was\nmade out.\nThe mediumship developed rapidly, involvmg complete levi-\ntation of table in red hght, and then appeared in rapid suc-\ncession aU the varieties of phenomena which occurred in the\npresence of the Reverend Stainton Moses, and others pecuHar\nto this mediumship alone. This hst includes the foUowuig\ncategories, there bemg several varieties under each heading :\n1. A great variety of raps, varying in force from the tap of\n'\na finger-nail to the kick of a heavy boot\n;\n2. Raps which answer questions coherently through a code\nof about eight words ;\n3. Lights two to five inches in diameter shown to some or\nall sitters, pale, non-radiant, non-illummating, extremely mobile ;\n4. Scents of many odours, like perfumes, and one an ap-\nparent combination unlike any known to the sitters ;\n5. Musical sounds\u2014chimes, bugles, clock-beUs, and other\ninstruments, though none was in the room ;\n6. Trance-writing in nine languages.\n7. Movement of furniture, smashing of the cabinet, lifting tlie\ntable Avith a sitter on it, balancing of unequally loaded scales\nwith a celluloid cover\n;\n8. Passage of matter through matter ;\nthe apport of roses\nand of a live pigeon ;\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 83\n9. The direct independent voice of Walter, the control\n;\nproved to be independent by simple and fraud-proof methods ;\n10. The production of teleplasm in the red light, and flash-\nlight photographs of it in the midst of red light ;\nhandUng of\nthese masses m red light by the sitters ;\n11. (Telekmesis) movements of lumuious objects by the tele-\nplastic terminals, visible to all sitters.\nIn July and August, 192.3, trance appeared with trance-\nspeakmg and trance-writmg, but stopped December 1, 1923, and\nwas not seen agam until January, 1925. December 1, 1923,\nand for the thirteen months followmg, all occurrences were\nwithout trance, the psychic talking freely and enjoying the\nsittmg as well as the others. In September, 1923, the first\nefforts at mdependent voice were heard. This quickly became\nstandardised into an easily heard loud whisper, commg mostly\nfrom the cabinet but repeatedly, for special guests, being heard\nui other parts of the room as far away as eight feet from the\npsychic : in other words, a truly independent voice, never\nautomatic, in the opmion of constant observers. This direct\nindependent voice made communication with Walter, the\ncontrol, so easy that systematic development of the phenomena\nfollowed rapidly. Each sitting now presents, as it Avere, a\ncross section of the whole story of psychic research. The\nvoice prophesies or promises the physical phenomenon, then,\nunder test conditions, the thing occurs as promised. New\nphysical experiments and tests are proposed to Walter, he\ndiscusses them with the sitters, he agrees with them as to\nwhat conditions should surround the tests and is, himself,\napparently intrigued by new apparatus and pleased to get a\nhard problem.\nThe investigation of the Scientific American Committee^\nhad begun in the spring of 1924, and owing principally to\nthe action of one of its members much acrimonious discussion\nhad arisen and the sittings had been suspended. This discus-\nsion was at its height when I arrived, and the medium and\nher husband appeared to be in a highly nervous condition.\nBefore detailing my experiences, I wish to give my\nimpression of the principal characters. The medium,\n1 See Scientific American, July, August, November, 1924, and Mr. J. M.\nBird's book Margery (Boston, 1925).\n\f84 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nMargery, is a highly intelligent and charming young\nwoman, exceedingly good natured and possessed of a fund\nof humour and courage which make her an ideal subject\nfor investigation. Her husband is a hard-working and\nskilful surgeon, of wide reading, and possessing extensive\nknowledge of many social questions and problems. If\nMargery's mediumshij) is in fact fraudulent (and there is\nlittle, if any, direct evidence in support of such a sup-\nposition) it is, I think, j)i'actically certain that F. H. fully\nacquiesces, if he does not actively assist in the fraud.\nThe deception (if such there be) could not possibly succeed\nwithout both his manual dexterity and his tenacity of\nj)urpose. The question of motive, in view of F. H.'s\nprofessional and social standing, is a difficult one. It would\nperhaps seem incredible that he should take part in a hoax,\nfor any purpose inconsistent with what he considered the\ninterests of scientific truth. It is, I think, however, just\npossible that a hoax designed to test the gullibility of\nobservers, and to discredit what he might consider\n\" Spiritualistic su2)erstition \" would appeal to his fervent\nrationalism.\nTo say that the Margery mediumship is one of the most\nimportant of its kind would be an understatement : it is,\nI think, the most remarkable hitherto recorded. For we\nhave here not only alleged telekinetic and teleplastic pheno-\nmena, but also the occurrence of what is claimed to be\na truly independent voice, which is heard throughout the\nsitting and which controls the phenomena, foretelling or\npromising a phenomenon, which in many cases is produced as\npromised.\nBut the difficulties of investigating it are correspond-\ningly great : they can only be appreciated in full by those\nwho have had practical experience of them. I did not\nsucceed in achieving my primary purpose, of coming to a\ndefinite conclusion as to the genuineness or otherwise of\nthe phenomena. During the course of the sittings the\nevidence seemed to me at one time for, and at another\ntime against their supernormal nature, but never to incline\ndecisively either way. It was always necessary to hold\nboth hypotheses in view and to modify the procedure from\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 85\ntime to time according as one or other hypothesis appeared\nthe more probable. In the Report that follows I have\nendeavoured to set out fairly and fully the facts as I saw\nthem and to give the reasons which led me to waver in\nmy views as to the nature of the phenomena, in the hope\nthat this may be of assistance to future investigators.\nThese two hypotheses will in the rest of this Report be\nreferred to as the \"first\" and the \"second\" hjrpothesis\nrespectively, and at the risk of repetition I wish to em-\nphasise the fact that whenever the results of any sitting\nare discussed on the basis or from the angle of either\nhypothesis, it must not be assumed that I, or any other\nsitters, in fact, accept that hypothesis as covering such\nresults in the sense that the hypothesis is considered fully\nsatisfactory in all essential particulars.\nThe Present Investigation.\nBefore detailing the general conditions obtaining at the\nsittings it may be found convenient to sketch briefly the\nposition of the case when I arrived in Boston.\nThe investigation of the Scientific American magazine\nhad reached a dead-lock. F. H. was strongly ojjposed to\nthe members of the Committee, and although Professor\nMcDougall had been a member of that Committee, the\nrequest that he should collaborate with Dr. Worcester and\nmyself was readily granted by both F. H. and Margery,\nalthough I could see that their feelings had in no wise\nchanged. It was also agreed that Dr. and Mrs. Mark\nRichardson should be occasional sitters, as they were\nfriendly with Margery and her husband, and Dr. Richard-\nson's position in Boston entitled him to respect.\nHaving arranged the personnel of the inquiry, the other\nconditions had to be discussed. Since the absence of any\nsuitably equipped laboratory compelled me to accept the\nsittings in the house in Lime Street, where Margery lives,\nit was at once apparent that minor phenomena had to be\ndiscounted to a large extent. Although the room was\nopen at all times to a search, it was so encumbered with\nfurnishings that any feeling of certainty regarding its\ninnocence had to be abandoned. The next great difficulty\n\f86 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\narose regarding the control of the medium during the\nsittings. F. H. and Margery vehemently opposed a con-\ntrol of one of the medium's hands by one or other of my\ncollaborators, and as it appeared useless to insist upon\nconditions disliked by the psychic at the very starting\npoint of what might prove an excellent investigation, I\nexamined their objections carefully and, after having what\nI considered confirmatory evidence from independent\nsources, I decided that the best plan was to sit quietly\nunder the conditions approved of by the medium and\nawait results. It was thus agreed that during many of\nthe sittings I was to control the left hand of the medium\nand P. H. the right, but obviously for the purposes of\nflawless evidence this hand control of F. H. must be re-\ngarded as non-existent.\nIf it be asked for what purpose this laxity of control\nwas permitted I should answer that it is of no use trying\nto investigate i^henomena except under conditions which\nmake their occurrence possible, and whether supernormal\nor not they are unlikely to occur under conditions dis-\npleasing to the medium. It may, therefore, be wise to\nbegin with imperfect control which, when j)henomena occur,\nit may be possible to improve. It may, moreover, happen\nthat the phenomena that occur are of such a nature that\ndemonstration of their genuineness or falsity does not\ndepend on the weak j)oint in the control. And it was in\nfact my primary aim to secure phenomena, the super-\nnormality of which would be self-evident from their very\nnature.\nGENEPvAL ACCOUNT OP THE SITTINGS.\nThe Seance Room.\nThe room used by Margery for the experiments was\nformerly a sort of lounge and book den at the top of the\nhouse. It measures approximately 18 feet 1 inch x 17 feet\nand is 9 feet high (5-48 m. x 5-18 m. x 2-74 ni.). The ac-\ncompanying diagram (Fig. 1) shows a rough plan of the\nroom and general arrangements. D is a pair of doors\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 87\nleading into the upper landing secured by a lock and\nturnmg upon hinges which permit the doors to swing clear\nof the floor by a wide margin. F is the fireplace, and\non the mantelpiece is the lamp L, controlled by a rheostat\nR. This lamp consisted of a ruby bulb enclosed in a black\ntapering wooden box arrangement and over the front of\nthe box were a few sheets of white tissue paper to diffuse\nD\nM\nR\nT\nB\nW\nPig. 1.\nthe light. C is the cabinet measuring 4 feet x 3 feet x 6\nfeet high (1-21 m. x 91 cm. x 1-82 m.), and M the medium's\nmahogany chair of Windsor pattern with arms. The legs\nwere 19 inches square (48 cm.) on the floor, the side\nrungs beuig 4| inches (12 cm.) clear of the floor, and the\nfront and back 8 inches (20 cm.). The thickness of the\nseat was IJ inches (3 cm.), its widest part 21^ inches\n(53 cm.), and deepest 17 inches (43 cm.). The back was just\n22 inches high measured from the seat, and the weight over\n\f88 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\n13 lbs. (5-8 kg). \"Domes of Silence\" were fitted to each\nleg, and the chair was usually just within the cabinet, the\nback of which was about 3 feet Sins. (Ml m.) from the doors.\nW indicates a row of windows looking on to Lime Street,\nand shaded with blinds and curtains, whilst B is a long\nbook case filled with books occupying almost the entire\nlength of the room. T is the seance table made of soft\npine and measuring roughly 2 feet 6 inches x 1 foot 8\ninches x2 feet 3 inches high (76 cm. x 50 cm. x 68 cm.),\nbefore which Margery is usually seated, F. H.'s place being\nbetween her and the rheostat, R.\nThe cameras which were employed at the sittings were\nmanaged entirely by Mr. R. W. Conant, of the Massa-\nchusetts Institute of Technology, and I wish here to record\nmy thanks to him for so skilfully succeeding in a difficult\ntask, and also to Mrs. Dennett through whose generosity\nmaterials were purchased and the use of a stereoscopic\ncamera made possible.\nConduct of the Seances.\nBefore dealing with the general method of conducting\nthe seances, it will be here convenient to print as it\nstands and to analyse as far as is possible the conditions\ndrawn uj^ by F. H., which were demanded as a preliminary\nto my having any sittings at all. These conditions, which\nare exceedingly important when viewed in the light of our\ntwo hypotheses, were as follows :\n(1) It is understood that the name. \" Walter \" is applied to\nthe personaLity which manifests in the seance room, purports\nto be the deceased brother of the medium, and operates as\nthe \" spirit control,\" without in any way bmdmg any signer\nhereof to any particular interpretation of the true character of\nthis personality.\nIt is agreed between tlie investigator and the doctor that :\n(2) Neither the investigator nor any of his agents shall turn\non any light m the seance room except with the prior know-\nledge and expressed consent of Walter.\n(3) The investigator shall supply the doctor with a signed copy\nof his notes of each seance, before he attends the next seance.\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 89\n(4) These notes shall, withm the investigator's best memory,\nmclude every fact with relation to the phenomena and the\naccompanying circumstances which he regards as in any way\nimportant. This is not intended to imply that the investigator\nneed say anjrthing about causes in these notes ; but it is\nunderstood nevertheless that if at the end of any seance he is\nconvinced that he has discovered fraud, he must say so in his\nnotes. The doctor understands that if there is in the investi-\ngator's mind merely the possibility of fraud, he is under no\nobhgation to record this in his notes.\n(5) Subject to Walter's approval, the investigator shall be in\ncharge of the personnel and procedure at all seances ;\nexcept\nthat the doctor shall not be excluded without his consent, and\nthat the investigator shall introduce no sitters without the\ndoctor's approval.\nNow, regarded superficially, these conditions appear to be\nreasonable, just, and carefully edited. Nos. 1 and 2 can\nat once be granted, but upon studying the others it is\nseen that they may facilitate simulated phenomena.\nThus if the phenomena are not supernormal, (3) gives\nthe other parties full information as to the discoveries\nmade by the investigator. For example, if a touch is\nexperienced in the third seance, and the iiavestigator re-\nmarks certain facts which lead him to suppose that a\nreaching rod is being employed, then these facts must\nbecome the property of one of the persons concerned in\nthe manipulation of that rod before the next sitting. These\npersons can in this way keep themselves au fait with all\nthe investigator's discoveries, and since they are virtually in\nentire charge of the sittings (notwithstanduag clause 5) dis-\ncovery of the methods employed is rendered absolutely im-\npossible unless the phenomena are produced so crudely as to\ninvite instant detection. Thus in my sittings I never detected\nanything that could positively be called fraud, and I think\nthe majority of Margery's investigators are in the same\nposition. It does not in the least follow, however, that\nbecause fraud is not detected it does not exist. It may\nwell be that the conditions insisted on by the medium and\nher husband render that detection a virtual impossibility.\nOn the other hand, it has been urged that F. H. has been\n\f90 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\ndriven to make these conditions in order to safeguard the\nhonour and safety of his wife and of himself, and m par-\nticular to prevent second thoughts being substituted for\noriginal impressions in the records of the sittings when\nsigned by the observers.\nIn accepting these conditions I was fully cognisant of\ntheir shortcomings and of the criticisms which could so\neasily be levelled against them. But it seemed better to\naccept what was offered than to commence the series by\nobjections and refusals. The fact that the seances were to\nbe held in the medium's house, and that the medium's\nhusband was often to be allowed to control her on one side,\nrobbed them of so much evidential value that it did not\nseem worth while to insist upon what were, after all, less\nimportant details.\nThe Sittings.\nThe sittings themselves I divide into two groups (a) what\nI shall call the official series at which were generally present\nas observers Professor McDougall, Dr. Elwood Worcester,\nand myself, and (6) the ordmary seances, which I shall\ncall private sittings, where I was a friend assisting with\nothers, but at which the control was slightly more rigid\nthan that to which Margery had usually been accustomed.\nThe sittings are usually held in darkness. That this con-\nstitutes a grave weakness is obvious. Red light is permitted\nonly at the dictation of the controlling voice,^ wliich claims\nthat periods of darkness are necessary for the purposes of\nincubation.\nSitting I. {Private).\nDecember 30, 1924. 10 Lime Street, Boston. 8.55 p.m.\nPresent {in. order of place commencing from Margery's right\nhand as she sits in the cabinet) :\n^ P. H. ; Mrs. J. De\nWyckoff ; Dr. Mark Richardson ; Mr. Fred Adler ; Mr. J.\nDe Wyckoff ; Mi-s. Richardson ; E. J. D. ; Mr. J. M.\nBird sits just behind F. H. and Margery.\n1 This voice claims to be independent in the sense that it is not the\nmedium who speaks.\n2 This order is kept throughout the following series of sittings.\n\f98] ~\nwith the Medium Margery. '91\nThis was a friendly group arranged for the occasion, so that\nI might have the opportunity of observing the general condi-\ntions of the sittings. The medium sat in the cabinet, and\nbefore her was placed the seance table already described on\np. 88, whilst on the table was placed the bell box which had\nbeen introduced as a test apparatus by the Scientific American\nCommittee.^ This box was placed upon the table, its longer\nside parallel with the same side of the table and the opening\nof the flap facing F. H. Two small megaphones, one with a\nluminous band, stood at the right side of the medium's chair.\nThese were \\0\\ inches (27 cm.) high, the circumference of the\nlarger ends being about 23 inches (57\"5cm.), and the smaller\n7J inches (18 cm.) respectively.\nWe commenced with darkness, and the voice and light\nwhisthng soon began. The control varied throughout the\nsitting ; sometimes I had Margery's left hand and both\nfeet, sometimes both hands and both feet, or again both\nhands and one foot. After about a quarter of an hour the\nbell rang, and this was done repeatedly both in darkness\nand red Hght. It also rang when I raised it from the table\nin red light, and continued ringing as I held it and moved it\nalmost beyond the left hand wing of the cabinet. 'V^Tien the\nred light was on I remarked that the flap was lowered beyond\nits normal level, and when the bell rang the flap did not seem\nto be depressed but merely shivered.\n1 See J. M. Bird, op. cit., pp. 287-292 ; 392-404 ; 469-484. This\ndevice, the details of which had already itndergone many changes, was\nof the simplest possible construction. It consisted essentially of a pad-\nlocked box containing a battery and electric bell, which could only be\nrung normally hy pressure upon a hinged flap upon the top, which was\nfurnished with the necessary contacts, and was normally held apart by\na long steel spring screwed to the top of the box. The box was made\nof stained pine and measured 14 inches (35 cm.) x 8J inches (21 cm.) x 5\nJ\ninches (13 cm.) high ; the flap was of unpolished soft pine and measiired\n8 inches (20 cm.) square. The contacts were of copper and the steel\nspring measured 7J inches (20 cm.) long. This spring had been sub-\nstituted for another spiral spring, which had apparently been formerly\nused and which had been loosely placed under the board. The flap had\npreviously been fastened to the base on the top of the box by a velvet\nstrip, which had been detached several times as fresh experiments had\nbeen made. The whole apparatus weighed about 8 Ibsa (36 kg.), and a\nbrass lock and Yale padlock completed the outfit.\n\f92 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nA voice was also heard from apparently inside one of the\nmegaphones which was raised and touched my nose, and soon\nafterwards Mi's. Richardson experienced a touch upon her right\narm and shoulder, whilst almost immediately I did the same.\nIt seemed like the gentle pressure of two fingers, the distance\nfrom the medium being about two feet.\nThe phenomena at this sitting were typical of the ordinary\noccurrences with Margery's mediumship. We have (1) the\nvoice, (2) telekinetic movements both connected with the voice\nand inde23endent of it, (3) action at a distance in darkness and\nred light, and (4) touches. Disregarding the voice for the\nmoment, we have mainly telekinetic movements of the mega-\nphone and the ringmg of the bell box which can be considered\ntogether. A great weakness m the conduct of the Margery\nsittings is the insistence of periods of darkness by the control.\nAssuming genuineness, this may be explicable on the assump-\ntion that smce the mediumship was developed along these lines\nit was difficult to change it. But on the second hypothesis of\ntrickery such periods of darkness provide intervals not of in-\ncubation but of preparation, so that the observers can finally\nsee the presentation of a finished phenomenon. It was ap-\nparent to me at this first sittmg that this difficulty would be\nalmost insurmountable for two reasons. Fhstly, if the pheno-\nmena were genuine, the training involved before the darkness\ncould be dispensed with would probably take up the whole\navailable time at my disi^osal, and secondly, if they were\nproduced by trickery, the suggestion would be resisted and\nfurther difficulties would arise. The methods of dealing with\nsuch suggestions by F. H. and Margery are of some interest.\nThe medium will, as a general rule, accept any control or any\nsuggestion within reason, but at the same time she reserves to\nherself the right of disclaiming responsibility for any negative\nresults that may ensue, asserting that it is the control\nWalter and not herself who produces the phenomena, and\nthat he must be consulted and not she. This is reasonable if\nthe phenomena are in fact genuine, but if they are fraudulent\nthe device constitutes a convenient method of escape, as when\npressed by suggestions which are distasteful to him, Walter\neither makes promises Avhich are never fulfilled, or turns the\nthing into a joke Avith a series of droll witticisms, at which\n\f98] ivith the Medium Margery. 93\nhe is both skilled and highly amusing. During the coiirse of\nthe sittings I tried a number of these experiments, and the\nresults may i^rove instructive when viewed from the angle\neither of behef or scepticism. In the present sitting the period\nof darkness prevailed before the ringing of the bell and at\nintervals after it. The most impressive phenomenon was the\ntouch on my shoulder. Although I constantly asked the\ncontrol for fm-ther examples of touching, this was the one\noccasion only upon which such phenomena occurred. The\nringing of the bell box in red light was good, and had I\nintended to continue its use, I should have made a complete\nstudy of it. But the apparatus was too clumsy to be of any\nparticular service and little information could have been ob-\ntained from its use.\nSitting II. (Official).\nJanuary 1, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.25 p.m.\nPresent (in order from medium's right hand) : F. H. ; Dr. E.\nWorcester (W.) ; Professor McDougaU (M.) ; E. J. D.\nThis was the iirst of the official series. A small family\ngroup had sat the night before, but with negative results.\nFor the purpose of control over the medium's head, hands, and\nanlfles, she wore a luminous disc on her forehead attached to\na tape tied round her head, and luminous wristlets made out\nof broad elastic around her wists, similar rings being placed\naround her ankles.\nThe phenomena at this sitting consisted mainly of table\nmovements. Some of these were strUimg and difficult to\naccount for normally, assuming the existence of control of both\nhands and feet of the medium. Nothing, however, occurred\nwhich deserves comment at any length. Both before, during,\nand after this seance, Margery appeared unwell and depressed.\nSitting III. (Official).\nJanuary 2, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.42 p.m.\nPresent : As in Sitting II. and same order.\nIt had been arranged that at the conclusion of every sitting\nthe notes should be compiled by the observers, F. H. acting as\namanuensis for the group. In the following sitting these notes\n\f94 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nwill be printed as they were written except that here and there\nsome minor alterations have been made for the sake of\nclarity.\nThe general conditions were the same as before, except that\nthe medium had discarded a portion of her garments and was\nclothed in a thick woollen bath-robe and stockings. Luminous\nletters pinned on the cuffs of F. H. and E. J. D. were for the\npurpose of allowing M. and W. to see the approximate positions\nof their hands. Hands were joined round the circle.\nOn the table were placed a twelve-cymbaled tambourine Avith\na luminous T painted upon the membrane ; a ukulele with a\nluminous U painted upon it on one side ; a small luminous\nring about 1^ inches in diameter, and a black handkerchief\nupon which was painted a crude representation of a grimiing\nface in luminous paint, Avhich had been named by the previous\ncircle the \" Houdini Handkerchief.\"\nThe following is the record of the sitting made by F. H.\nby dictation from the group :\nPhenomena began with vague noises apparently caused\nby some of the objects on the table. The luminous T\nand ring were occluded several times by what seemed to\nbe an opaque object passing above them. Dr. W.'s hand\nwas touched by a hard object, which appeared to be the\nhandle of the ukulele. Tambourine was raised a few inches\ninto the air, fell on Dr. W.'s hand, and rested there for\nsome five minutes. Houdini handkerchief moved shghtly,\nand part of it apparently rested over the ukulele. Ukulele\nwas raised some eight inches above the table ; it appeared\nfirst to lie flat in air, then to stand upright, so that the\nU was clearly visible. Houdini handkerchief was moved\nso that the features showed motion ; mouth appeared to\nopen three times (Dr. W.). Ukulele raised into air, verti-\ncally, handle downwards, facing McD. and D. at west\njudged that handle was clear of table. Then shghtly\nturned round, and twanged in the air. Psyche (F. H.'s\nname for the medium) complained of pain in right arm\nand side, described in terms of biting sensation. Followed\nby pain in side ; then trance. Three phases of trance,\nwith revivals of consciousness between. During trance\n;\n\fwith the Medium Margery. 95\nukulele twanged certainly, and probably moved somewhat.\nShort trance period -with no action ;\npause in seance at 10.30.\nPause lasted about five minutes. Slight rustlings on\ntable and movements of Houdini handkerchief. Followed\nby tippings of table away from Psyche towards Dr. W.\nFollowed by complete levitation of table.

It is clear\nfrom the record that the only hands and feet that we can\nreasonably consider j^artially available were F. H.'s left hand\nand left foot and Margery's right hand and right foot. The\nluminous anlilet rendered any extensive use of her right foot\ndifficult, and similarly the luminous C on F.

(Private).\nJanuary 4, 1925. 273 Clarendon Street, Boston. 9.5 p.m.\nPresent (in order from medium's right) : F. H. ; Mrs. Augustiis\nHemenway ;\nDr. Mark Richardson ; Mx. Augustus Hemen-\nway ; Mrs. Mark Richardson ; E. J. D.\nThis was a sitting held away from the medium's house in\nthe Boston residence of Mr. and Mi-s. Augustus Hemenway.\nA room had been chosen which was partially empty, and a\nrude cabinet made out of a three-winged screen erected with\nits back to the wmdow. Over the screen a black silk gown\nhad been flung ; the room darkened ; a thick red paper shade\nplaced over the electric lamp, and the victrola put outside the\ndoor and connected to an electric motor. A plain painted\ntable similar in size to that at Lime Street stood in front of\nthe cabinet. The medium wore wristlets, anklets, and head\ndisc as usual. F. H. and E. J. D. also wore wristlets. The\nother sitters wore no bands. On the table were the luminous\nring, tambourine, and ukulele. F. H.'s record reads thus ;\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 97\nWalter came through in a few minutes and had a more\nor less lengthy conversation mth Mr. Dingwall as to the\ndetails of the next few sittings. He promised something\nso unprecedented and amazing that we were quite over-\nwhelmed by it. He gave us instructions, however, not to\nput this promise on paper, or to tell anyone. He then\ngave minute details as to what to do and what not to do\non this great occasion, and then went on to the work of\nthe evening.\nThe control was by means of the illuminated bands on\nwrists of everyone [this is incorrect, see above] and on\nankles of Psyche and her head also (as before). Under\nthese conditions, with all hands obviously inert, Walter\nlifted the tambourine and ukulele from six to fourteen\ninches many times. He did a lot of work with the table,\nin the way of tilting and levitation, and best of all,\nallowed Mr. Dingwall to hold up his thumb on edge of\ntable, whereupon Walter put the centre of the tambourine,\nbalancing it thus on the thumb perfectly on request of\nMr. DingwaU. Mi-. Dingwall was then allowed to hold the\ntambourine in one hand, and Walter then pulled on it and\ntwisted it in any directions asked by Mr. Dingwall. Mi\".\nDingwall said this he had tried for in many places all over\nthe world, but never before had it. The pull he estimated\nat two and one half to five pounds.\nSitting closed at 11.55 p.m.\nAs before the sitting represents a fair specimen of\nMargery's mediunisliip. Moreover, the seance shows good\nprogress when regarded from the point of view of the\nfirst hypothesis. Certain manipulations of a ring and of\ntlie tambourine showed no dexterity, although the levita-\ntion of the former was quite impressive. At one time the\ntambourine rose near the corner of the table nearest to\nthe medium's left hand, which I was controlling. It rose\nsome inches above the surface of the table ; then it moved\ntowards the edge, sank beneath the projecting end and\nremained apparently suspended, having passed over the\nmedium's hand and mine during its movement. This inci-\ndent remains the most interesting of all the examples of\n\f98 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nalleged telekinetic phenomena that I witnessed with\nMargery, althongh the attempts to balance the ring on\nthe end of my finger were also curious, and only suc-\nceeded after repeated attempts. The tambourine appeared\nto be held fairly rigidly, and although I have many\ntimes tried to experiment on levitated objects alleged to\nbe supported by supernormal structures, I never succeeded\nto the extent that seemed possible at the sitting. I tried\non the tambourine, pull, push and torsion, it seemed as if\nit were held by some elastic structure, and my sensation\nwas similar to the one I exjierienced with another medium\nunder better conditions of control. The experiments with\nthe ring also were highly instructive, supplemented as they\nwere by the more advanced series with the tambourine. It\nwould appear that, upon the first hypothesis, the support-\ning structures were being manipulated with but slight skill,\nand upon the second that the appearances were being\ncunningly simulated to give the observers the impression\nof clumsy manipulation.\nThe conversation with Walter at the commencement of\nthe sitting was obviously insj)ired by my own plans which\nI had partially discussed with F. H. These plans centred\naround the observation of the actual mechanism of tele-\nkinesis. Walter promised assistance in this respect, and\nhis promise was connected with an attempt to show us\nthe comjjlete emergence and subsequent disappearance of\nthe teleplastic substance. I of course supported him in this\nand discussed it in some detail ; a point which it may\nprove useful to remember in dealing with the succeeding\nsittings. It must be remembered that, as I said before,\nit was my j^rimary aim to secure phenomena, the super-\nnormality of which would be seh-evident from their very\nnature. The ap^Jearance of living, mobile substance emerg-\ning from the body of the medium, followed by the sub-\nsequent formations of definite shaj)es out of an amorphous\nmass would fulfil these expectations to a very considerable\nextent.\nThe chief question which now occitpied my|^ immediate\nattention was the best attitude with which to approach\nsuch phenomena. It appeared to me that some sort of\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 99\nhypothesis would have to be adopted. The attitude of\nsuspended judgment is one which, viewed in its proper\naspect, seems the reasonable one to adopt in nearly all\nof the debatable questions with which science is called\nupon to deal. But as working hypothesis it is often ill-\nadapted to the purposes of psychical research. For example,\nsuch an attitude is often irritating to the sensitive subject,\nwho fails to understand the reasons for which it has been\nadopted. Hence it appeared to me that it might be as\nwell to take either the first or the second hypothesis as\nthe working hypothesis, and then see how the facts sup-\nported the theory as develoj)ment proceeded. After taking\nfull account of the previous history of the mediumship,\nthe personahties of the medium and her husband, and any\nother facts that seemed to me relevant, I decided to adopt\nthe first hypothesis to work on.\nIn the succeeding sittings I hope to show how far the\nresult of the seances fulfilled my expectations. It will be\nindicated how the phenomena developed along orderly and\nprogressive lines ; how at times the probability of the first\nhypothesis became so strong that it seemed likely that it\nwould prove a \"true\" interpretation of the facts ; how the\ndevelopment ceased just when a continuation would have\nled to decisive results, and how finally every crucial test\nfailed.\nSitting V. {Private).\nJanuary 5, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.10 p.m. 10-30 p.m.\nPresent : W. ; Dr. M. Richardson ; Mrs. Richardson ; D.\nThis was a sitting at which F. H. was not present, and at\nwhich the victrola was not played. I had hoj)ed to obtaua\nsilhouettes of the telekinetic structures, and for this purj)ose\nhad jirepared a sheet of cardboard Avith lummous paint, A\\iiich\nI secured with a couple of stout thumb tacks to the end of\nthe table facing myself and at right angles to the medium.\nThere was also a luminous strip upon the top of the table\nalong the edge nearest the medium and also along the edge of\nthe two ends. The medium wore luminous wristlets, anklets,\nand head disc as before. Dr. Worcester controlled the right\nhand and right foot, Avhilst I controlled the left hand and left\n\f100 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nfoot. The phenomena obtained at this sitting were exceedingly\ninteresting. The absence of F. H. was, from the evidential\npoint of view, an improvement, and consequently phenomena,\nwhich with his presence would have to be discounted, were\nimpressive and important.\nThe first occurrence which attracted my attention was the\nbending of the cardboard apparently from its medial line and\nalong its entire length towards myself. I noticed this once,\nand upon its repetition asked W. not to bend over the table\nas he was bending the board. He replied that he was a foot\naway from the edge of the table and had not touched the\ncardboard. The movements of the cardboard occurred at\nintervals throughout the sitting and there were also a series\nof extremely puzzhng table movements. The sitting closed at\n10.30 p.m.\nThis seance was one of the most important of the entire\nseries, and suggested the authenticity of the phenomena.\nUnder the conditions obtaining at this sitting I found\nit difficult to imagine any normal method for moving the\ncardboard, and wished that fiurther opportunities might have\nbeen presented to study it. The board bent along its entire\nlength, and its thickness was such that pressure at one corner\nwould scarcely have been siifficient thus to affect it. We must\nassume a uniform pressure along the smiace near its upper\nedge, but how this could have been successfully applied I am\nat a loss to imagine. Similarly the movements of the table\nwere difficult to explain even assuming that one foot was free,\nwhich W. stated was not the case upon his side, and I feel\nfau-ly certain was not the case on mine. Confederacy on the\npart of W. and Mr. and Mrs. Richardson I can scarcely enter-\ntain, and the phenomena appeared to be evidential, although\nobviously too slight to be conclusive. At any rate the results\nwoukl have to be seriously considered before the validity of the\nsecond hypothesis could be accepted. In this case one must\nassume that some adroit manipulation of a rod or some such\npiece of apparatus held between the medium's teeth was\nresponsible for the movements of the cardboard, and that the\nmedium's use of one foot for two sufficed to free one foot in\norder to manipulate the table. Even then I am not sure that\none foot was capable of moving the table to the extent which\n\f98] ivitJi the Medium Margery. ioi\nwe observed. Although the opportunities afforded at a single\nsitting were not sufficient to justify any positive statements\non the matter, I should have been mclined to the supposition\nthat these phenomena were indeed supernormal had not sub-\nsequent events compelled me provisionally to substitute the\nhypothesis of trickery for that of genuineness. Whatever then-\nexplanation (and if trickery were employed it was '\nprobably\nvery simple), the events of this sitting were certainly startling,\nand if not supernormal indicated great sublety and shrewdness.\nSitting VI. (Official).\nJanuary 6, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.40 p.m. 10.20 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; M. ; W. ; D.\nThe control was as before, but F. H. wore another coat Avith\na luminous band sewn on the left cuff. On the table was a\nmechanical press bell, uj^on the knob of which was fastened\na cork and on the top of this a luminous disc. There were\nalso two luminous rings, one larger (A) than the other (B),\nand a small basket with handle and white tissue paper inside.\nThere were four luminous pins at the top corners of the\nbasket. The sitting was in darkness except Avhen indicated in\nthe account.\nI had introduced the beU and basket for special reasons.\nThe use of the beU was to provide a convenient method of\nobserving A\\'hether an alleged psychic structure was capable of\nringing it, and if so, additional evidence might be obtained by\nthe occlusion of the luminous disc, since the only means of\nringing the bell normally was by striking the press button or\nstriking the bell itself. In the latter case the sound differed\nmaterially from that made in the former. The basket had\nbeen introduced to discover how far such light objects could\nbe sviccessfuUy manipulated, and later to try various experi-\nments also Avith Aveights inside the Ijasket, but these Avere never\nattempted.\nThe folloAA'ing is the official record as dictated after the\nsitting.\nVariation in control this evening, F. H. Avearing another\ncoat and a broad luminous band on his left Avrist. On\nthe table : mechanical beU, to knob of AA'hich fastened a\n\f102 Beport 071 a Series of Sittings [PAET\ncork, on top of this a luminous disc. Two round luminous\nrings, one larger (A) than other (B). Little basket with\nhandle and inside some white tissue paper. Four luminous\npins on top corners of basket.\nPhenomena began by (A) being slightly tipped up, it\nbeing uncertain whether caused by current of air or some\nother cause. Then Walter asked D. and W. to move\nnearer the table. Soon after this he asked D. to place\nhis hand, palm upwards. Psyche's hand holding his wrist,\non the surface of the table towards the centre of edge\nfacing medium. After a few moments D. felt a cold,\nviscous, clammy material just touch the nail of his middle\nfinger, which was shghtly raised above the table. This\ntouch was almost immediately followed by another on the\nball of the same finger. Then by similar touches over a\nlarger siu'face of fingers and hand. The substance re-\nsembled a cold damjj tongue, which sometimes appeared\nto thicken at the end and exert pressure. This pressure\nwas not as if the whole material were exercising it, but\nas if a harder object were covered with a clammy shell,\nand the pressure were bemg exerted by it through the\nshell (D.). M. put hand across table with Walter's per-\nmission ; felt something hke a cold hand flapped on back\nof his hand, three or four times. W. would say that it\nrested on his hand toward end of his fingers, was drawn\nacross his fingers ; would compare it to feehng of piece\nof cold raw beef or possibly piece of soft, wet rubber.\nHe should also add that the impact was distinctly audible\nas well as tangible. M. verifies this.\nAll di'ew hands away and relaxed ; Walter asked D. to\n]}ut hand on table as j)reviously. Same tongue-lilie struc-\nture was then repeatedly drawn over surface of hand, and\nby permission he closed his hand twice over it. It curled\nujD easily within his hand and withdi'ew itself with sinuous\nslithering movement. It appeared to D. to be a httle\ndrier than formerly. D. then asked Walter whether the\nsubstance could touch his knuckle ; on affirmative answer,\nhe tiu'ned his hand over and what seemed to be a larger\npiece of the substance covered first of aU his fingers and\nthen the back of his hand. Withdrawing itself, it almost\n\fwith the Medium Margery. 103\nimmediately again covered his hand with sharp slap ; and\nits end appeared to extend beyond his hand on to ring (A),\nthe latter being flipped across the table on to the floor.\nSound of slap mentioned was distinctly audible. Visible\nas it fell across ring. As heard to fall, M. saw what\nmight have been long flabby finger fall rapidly across ring,\nrapidly withdraw, dragging ring off table.\nW. now put his hand over toward that corner of the\ntable. Back of hand struck smartly twice. This time he\nreceived impression that substance was more massive,\ncovering a larger portion of his hand and appearmg to be\nheavier. He would make it plain that this phenomenon\noccurred to him twice ; first time, on side of table toAvard\nD. ; second time, when M. and W. retained their contact,\ntheir hands being toward opposite side of table.\nWalter then asked for luminous plaque [i.e. cardboard].\nThis was placed standing upright on the bent edge. D.\nthen observed after few moments a movement of the edge\nof plaque near Psyche. Followed by a mass of black\nsubstance resembling about two inches of the end of a\nmittened hand. This projected and withdrew several times ;\nfinally the mitten-like hand appeared to be sliding across\nthe sui'face of the table and then rose ujj against the\nluminous plaque, showing itself as a curved shape with\nslight crook at end. Almost exactly resembUng the hand\nstructiu:e photographed with Stanislawa P.\nW. could only describe (didn't see so much because of\nposition) an object with a stealthy gliditig motion, appar-\nently along surface of table, at right lower corner of\nplaque. This advanced and receded several times ; he\ncould only describe colour as dark grey or greyish black.\nM. while plaque was vertical, saw merely vague opaque\nobject of rounded form covering lower and distant edge of\nplaque.\nWhile basket was standing on front of plaque, mass of\nsubstance crept toward it with a clearly audible sound\nflicked basket out of way. It went into Psyche's laj).\nThe plaque was brought or fell into horizontal position.\nM. saw very distinctly black object creeping over its far\nedge. D. had asked that it divide itself ; M. now saw\n\f104 Report on a Series of Sittings '[part?\nrounded blunt edge of the opaque object projecting and\nwithdrawing over edge of plaque ; then became distinctly\ndivided, really looked like very large, clumsy fingers close\ntogether, one a little apart from the others. Then he saw\nit again ;\ncomplicated shape, but saw it briefly and cannot\ndescribe in detail. Like eccentric finger shadows.\nShort rest period ;\nplaque itself upon which basket had\nbeen placed then began to move. Then rose into air\n2|-3| inches. Remained floating for a few seconds, fol-\nlowed by oscillations, undulations, movement to and fro.\nIn spite of these movements little basket remained on the\nplaque, though one might have supposed it would be dis-\nlodged (W.). While this agitation was going on Walter\nasked why it had not been made firmer. It then de-\nscended slowly on the table. While floating it had moved\nnearer to F. H.'s hand, holding Psyche's left.\nM. now suggested change in control. Plaque had been\nmaking few movements up and down, projecting over\nPsyche's edge of table. Therefore, he short-circuited F. H.,\ntaking their two hands under his left. Worcester at the\nsame time short-circuited M. to control F. H.'s hands on\nM.'s side. Further plaque movements now occurred.\nLifting of Psyche's end, and certain amount of to and fro\nmovement. Rustling noise ;\nplaque gave further move-\nments, finally toAvards M.'s arm, not far. After a con-\nversation with control sitting closed at 10.20.\n(Signed) E. J. DINGWALL.\nW. McDOUGALL.\nELWOOD WORCESTER.\nThis sitting was an important one when, considered from\nthe point of view of what had preceded it. Assuming the\nvalidity of the first hypothesis it is what might have been\nexpected. We saw in the previous sitting in Clarendon\nStreet how objects were seized and held as if by elastic\nstructures intelligently directed. Here the structures be-\ncame themselves visible and tangible. Teleplastic tele-\nkinetics were exemplified in a manner hitherto unrecorded\nin the history of psychical research. The reasons given\nby the control for this progress was that until then it was\n\f98] with the Medium Margenj. 105\nnot safe to exhibit these higher phenomena in the unsatis-\nfactory conditions of the previous investigations. The\nsubstance itself can obviously be compared with that\nobserved with other mediums, as, for example. Miss\nKathleen Goligher and Mile. Eva Carriere. The slithering\ntongue-like fins were similar to the rude claw-lilie terminals\noccasionally seen with Willy Schneider, and in this respect\nMargery's mediumship resembles his rather than that\nof Eva, whose alleged teleplastic faculties were directed\nrather towards artistic formations than towards mechanical\nwork.\nThe second hypothesis [i.e. of trickery) must now be\nconsidered in the light of the official record printed above.\nFor the present it must suffice to call the alleged tele-\nplastic material the \" substance,\" postponing for the\npresent all discussion as to whether it was a normal or\nsupernormal product and as to its nature.\nNow we must remember that, as there was no searching\nof either the medium or her husband, it was possible for\neither the one or the other or both to bring certain\narticles into the seance room. Since also the right hand\nof the medium and the left hand of F. H. must be con-\nsidered free, actions could be performed by them just as\nfar as the luminous bands sewai on their cuffs permitted\nwhen the sleeves were pulled up the arm out of the way,\nor F. H.'s arm, and even Margery's, withdrawn altogether.\nThat is to say that, assuming P. H.'s sleeve were pulled\nup, or his arm entirely freed from it, then Margery, by\nholding her wrist near his arm just above the elbow would\ngive him plenty of opportunity to manipulate any object\neither directly or by means of a device such as forceps\nor similar instrument.\nNow, when my hand was lying on the table palm up-\nwards, all that had to be done was for F. H. or Margery\nto touch my middle finger with some object covered with\na layer of the substance. We have no right to assume\nthat all these appearances were the same object. There\nmay have been half-a-dozen different objects, the only\npoint of similarity being that they were all covered with\nor encased m the substance. Assuming that a strip of\n\f106 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nthe substance was held in the jaws of a long forceps all\nthe flickings and slaps are easily explained, and when the\n\" long flabby finger \" dragged the ring off the table its\nweight and clammy surface would have easily been capable\nof doing it. The clumsy hand which lay across the\nluminous cardboard sheet and resembled eccentric finger\nshadows is more difficult to account for normally, although\nit seems to me possible that it might be said that the\nappearance was due to F. H.'s hand encased in some\nrough glove-lUve sheath. The levitation of the basket on\nthe cardboard was most impressive, and it is difficult to\nassign any normal cause which could be considered\nreasonable. It is perhaps possible that it was supported\nby a flat surface attached to the end of a forceps and\ncontrolled by F. H. or conceivably by F. H.'s own hand,\nand the change in the control, when the hands of both\nF. H. and Margery were controlled by M. suggests that\nthe more feeble movements of the cardboard which pro-\njected over the edge of the table facing the medium were\nproduced by a rod device manipulated by the medium's\nmouth. The rustling noise might well have been the rod\nas it scraped over the surface of the plaque, but all such\nexplanations must obviously be only tentative. Whatever\nmay be thought of the results of applying the second\nhypothesis to the sittmg, it is clear that some such\ntheories must be held if the occurrences are to be described\non normal grounds. Moreover, the progress m the pheno-\nmena would have to be ascribed to a cunning plan by\nF. H. and Margery, by which it was hoped to ensnare\nthe observers by simulating just such an advance as they\nmight be expected to anticipate. As I was still working\non the first hypothesis I naturally did not suggest to F. H.\nany of these unpleasant reflections. If the phenomena\nwere supernormal they would, I thought, prove themselves,\nor otherwise they would break down under the moderate\ntests I determined to apply.\n\f98] %vith the Medium Margery. 107\nSitting VII. (Official).\nJanuary 7, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.55 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; Dr. M. Richardson ; W. ; Mrs. Richardson ; D.\nAt this sitting the development proceeded as before. The\nsubstance was now visible for some seconds in the red light,\nand it was repeatedly handled by all present. The number of\nobservations were many, and the notes dictated at the end of\nthe sitting somewhat incomplete.\nOn the table there were placed the two luminous rings, the\nlittle basket and the bell. Darkness was the general rule\nexcept when the Control asked for red light to display the\nsubstance. The following is the record of the sitting :\nIn ten minutes rusthng in Psyche's lap. 3Ir. D. : Thought\na mass of substance was in Psyche's lap. Walter then\ndirected my palm to be put up on middle of table, near\nthe edge. Then for five minutes\u2014palm struck by cool,\nclammy apparently disc-like object ; on repeated flicks being\ngiven to my hand, I noticed that the shape of the object\nwas constantly changing. It appeared to lengthen and to\nwiden, and occasionally parts apj)eared to be thickened, as\nif some internal mechanism was causing a swelUng in parts\nof the mass. At times two distinct pressures at least were\nfelt, the sensation being as if crude, clammy, unformed\nfingers were pressing both the lower portions of my fingers,\nand also the upper at the same time. This pressure was\nsometimes increased to 2|-3 pounds, and when the sub-\nstance was drawn from the hand it always appeared to be\nshghtly viscous, a phenomenon which was later clearly\ndemonstrated with relation to the smaller luminous ring.\nW. then asked me to put my hand beneath the table\nbehind the mass, which was lying on the surface as far\nas two inches from the top. I felt a loose, clammy,\nskin-like appendage which, proceeding from the mass on\nthe table, appeared to curl away towards Psyche's right side.\nDr. Worcester : My observations begin from permission\nto advance my hand under Mr. D.'s. I felt the end of\nmy fingers smartly struck by a substance already described,\nand it seemed to me not so cold as last night. The\n\fI\n108 Report on a Series of Sittings [pakt\nsubstance rested across the back of my hand for a per-\nceptible length of time. It gently withdrew and retm-ned\n\u2022\u2014-apparently in somewhat greater volume.\nMrs. Richardson : My wrist held by Mi-. D. I put my\nfingers on table near Psyche. Mass rested on back of my\nfour fingers. It felt like ice-cold, uncooked liver. It was\nwithdrawn and replaced twice. It left a lasting sensation\non my fingers.\nDr. Richardson : My hand was palm down on table.\nEnds of fingers were flicked by this material. My ex-\nperience was that of Dr. W., but perhaps less in degree.\nThe Psyche now went into trance. The mass was now\nvisible on the table on account of the large ring near F. H.\nWalter then asked red light (low) for five seconds (arranged\nbeforehand for the purpose)\n.\n3Ir. D. saw lying on the table near the edge near Psyche\nnear east end, a mass of greyish white substance, Avhich\nseemed like back of an armadillo. It seemed to be per-\nhaps two inches thick and curved down in aU directions\ntowards the surface of the table.\nDr. Worcester : I saw the same mass, graying, some-\nwhat rounded\u2014less clearly than Mi'. D. saw it.\nP. H. saw the same\u2014lilie half a human brain\u2014not\nsmooth on surface.\n3Ir. D. : After a few minutes darkness Walter asked me\nto feel the substance and note a hole like a gullet at the\nbase of the cord leading to Psyche. Prom this he said\nhe drew power to move objects\u2014a statement I asked him\nto explain later. I first put my hand on the top of the\nsubstance. It was soft, clammy, and cold. I then\nlowered my hand, and noted that where the cord joined\nthe mass there appeared to be a sort of skinny frill about\nhalf-inch high. Beneath this was the neck from which the\ncord hung, and in this neck I felt the deiDression into\nAvhich, at Walter's request, I j^ushed my forefinger. It\nwas soft and cool like the rest of the substance, but it\ndid not extend so far as quarter inch. While this was\nbeing done. Psyche groaned each time.\nRelaxation. Then ten seconds of brighter red hght.\nMr. D. : I saw extended on the table from the edge near\n\ftvitJi the Medium Margery. 109\nPsyche from one inch from middle Hne of table a long,\nknobby, greyish white shape like a crudely formed right\nhand\u2014the thumb being merely a mass of substance joining\nthe main mass. All agree.\nAfter another relaxation, the mass struck top of table\nviolently. The basket was flicked over and the small ring\n(B) raised in the air\u2014and then seen apparently sticking to\nend of structm-e\u2014with great speed. The blow was like\na seal's flipper. At D.'s request, plaque was put on table\nat east end, luminous side towards D.\nMr. D. : Against it I saw a mitten-like structm'e creep-\ning forward at side near Psyche, and plaque was turned\non its back. Its surface was now flicked several times\nand its end was curled. The structure had changed its\nshape ; a long tongue-like j)rojection, five inches long and\none inch broad, now extended from main mass, which also\nhad no longer a clear outhne, but was broken up irregu-\nlarly like amputated fingers. As structure was thrown\nabout there were convulsive movements of both forearms\nof Psyche. All agreed to this description.\nMr. D. : I now remember that earlier in the sitting I was\nallowed to hold the mass and press it.

G. CRANDON,\n\f110 Report on a Series of Sittings [paet\nThis sitting was very similar to that on the previous\nday, and the same considerations can be applied to it\nwhen viewed in the Hght of the second hypothesis. Now,\nas before, we must assume the same possibility of freedom\nof action on the part of F. H. and Margery, and also the\nexistence of several masses of substance or objects covered\nby it. The temptation of svipposing that these objects\nwere all one and that the change of shape was due to\nsome process of growth must be steadily resisted. Such\nprocesses can be simulated, and indeed must be assumed\nto have been simulated in instances to be discussed later.\nCertaualy no mere mass of substance can exert pressure as\ndescribed above. This pressure may just have been an\nillusion on my part, but if real, such pressure can easily\nbe obtained if the jaws of a forceps are covered in a\nlayer of substance, and the impression of palpable fingers\nbecomes highly reahstic. Moreover, the flicks described\ncould have been given by different objects, thus causing\nthe recipient to assixme change of shape in the same\nobject. In order to illustrate my meaning somewhat more\nfully, I will show in parallel columns how the second\nhypothesis can receive support from the official record.\nLet us assume that F. H. and Margery bring in (1) a\ngood forcejDs with jaws covered with a thick layer of the\nsubstance, which being of anmial membrane will be cool\nand can easily be made slippery and moist by the use of\nsaliva ; (2) a piece of the substance cut round into a disc-\nlil?;e shape ; (3) several pieces cut like sheep's tongues ;\n(4) a round mass of substance, either solid or possibly\ninflated ; (5) a rudely formed \" hand \" made out of the\nsubstance.\nIn ten minutes rustling in\nPsyche's lap.\nThen for five minutes left\npalm struck by cool, clammy,\napparently disc-like object.\nThe shape of the object was\nconstantly changing.\nF.

No. 5 is now displayed.\nThis phenomenon can be un-\nderstood if it is assumed that\nNo. 5 is now manipulated by\nMargery. The violent move-\nments of the forearm suggest\nthat this was possible. The\nviscous nature of the mem-\nbrane (due perhaps to saliva)\nwould be sufficient to raise the\nring, and the cork of the bell.\nFrom the above it will be seen that stripped of its\nglamour the sitting can be regarded in the light of the\nsecond hypothesis without too many unfounded assump-\ntions. To the question whether such things are possible\nthe only answer that can trutlifully be given is that they\nare, and anyone with some practice can reproduce these\nphenomena. On the other hand, there is nothing in the\naccount which does violence to the first hypothesis beyond the\nextreme improbability of the whole affair. Moreover, since\nsimilar phenomena, although far less fine in quality, have been\nobserved with other mediums under conditions of control\nwhich seem to me to exclude trickery, there was no question\nthat the occurrence might be in very truth what the medium\nand her husband claimed that they were.\nIt appeared to me folly to interrupt the series and pos-\nsibly obtain no further phenomena. The first hypothesis\nwas giving results hitherto unrecorded. If progress were\nmaintained, then the phenomena would soon be self-\nevident apart altogether from the presence of F. H. and\nhis relation to the medium.\n\f112 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nSitting VIII. {Official).\nJanuary 8, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.47 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; M. ; W. ; J).\nThis sitting continued the orderly progress of those on\nJanuary 6 and January 7. The situation had been discussed\nwith F. H. and Margery, as I was feeling my way towards\nascertaining their views upon the whole question. Walter\nhad already promised us the phenomena of visible extrusion,\nand reabsorption, and as such occurrences would be better\nobserved with the medium in black tights or similar garb I\nhad raised this question. Unfortunately these tights were\nobjected to on the ground that the materiahsed substance\nwould fail to pass through them, a theory in flat contradiction\nwith results observed with other mediums. Instead of tights\nF. H. and Margery suggested a loose bath-robe and stockings\nas appropriate garments for the sittings. This would give free\nplay to the extruding substance, which could emerge from\nbetween the folds of the robe and thence proceed on to the\nsurface of the table. This was one of the most remarkable\nsittings that I have ever attended. I was gradually working\nup to the crucial experiments, and aheady there were signs\nof the possibflity that the first hypothesis might have to be\ndiscarded. I proj)ose dividing the official report in para-\ngraphs lettered consecutively A. to J. In discussing the sitting\nit will then be convenient to indicate the paragraph by their\nletters rather than resortuig to recapitulation. The official\nreport reads thus :\nA. 8.57 : Rustling in Psyche's lap, and soon after sound on\ntable\u2014a flick. Trance then came on. Then D. was told\nby Walter to feel substance as it lay on Psyche's left thigh\nabove the knee. This done, and D. felt clammy substance\nlying between skin and robe. It moved slightly when D.\ntouched it. It seemed to jerk, and was withdrawn some-\nwhat up the thigh.\nB. D. was told by Walter to extend his hand, and cold\nstuff was felt and pressed by D. A round mass with\nknobby prominences on top. Dim led light 3 sees., D. saw\n24\" long greyish mass at edge of table near middle. It\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 113\nhad a number of knobby projections vipon it. M. de-\nscribes mass as size of two fists resting on edge of table,\nwith five or six rounded knobs on upper surface. Seemed\nto be pale reddish colour. Dr. Worcester describes it as\nsomewhat smaller, greyish to brown, otherwise the same.\nD. and M. then, on request, followed a cord from mass\ndownwards which entered folds of dress. Mr. D. : This cord\nseemed soft and clammy like rest of substance but not so\nsolid\u2014diameter J\"\u2014hke a ribbon with things protruding\u2014\na\ncord-band. Dr. Worcester : I passed my hand over mass and\nalong cord till I touched the dress. Diameter, 1\" to 1|\".\nSeemed to be composed of strands. Dr. McDougall : I did\nthe same and got feeUng like placental cord\u2014-texture with a\nmembrane\u2014clammy\n.\nC. Relaxation : red light stronger 2 sees., showed same\nposition and bulk\u2014a mass appearing more closely a crude\nhuman hand\u2014crooked at \"finger ends.\" Mr. D. : I thought\nI saw beguming of knuckle and rude attempt at skin mark-\nings and apparently veins. Dr. M. : I saw rough forma-\ntion, approximately a right hand with first two jomts visible.\nD. D. then asked for visible telekinesis. Then structure\ncovered larger of two rings\u2014nearer border. Then red light\n3 sees., then 2 sees., then again 2 sees. On each occasion\njust as light went out the hand drawing the luminous ring\nwith it made shght movement towards Psyche about 1\".\nE. Then the larger ring was seized and waved about some\n6\" above the table and twisted about. Then, following\ninstructions, D. raised forefinger and large ring was put\non it ; then smaller ring was pushed up (D.), and after\nseveral attempts it was placed on same finger tip. Then\nrings were moved about and one ring was slapped down\non pahns of M.'s fingers. The mass on M.'s finger made\nshakmg hand movements.\nF. Then both rings were dashed about over table with\nlaughter from Walter.\nG. BeU was flapped violently and rung violently twice.\nCork top came off and was replaced once. Walter was\nadvised not to touch metal top. He replied, \" No danger,\nI'm the sanest man outside of the scientists.\" Luminous disc-\ntop of beU was eclipsed by tlie mass when bell was struck.\n\f114 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nH. When larger ring was wanted, it was at centre of table.\nTo get it Walter pulled the table towards Psyche.\nJ. Psyche began to come out and sitting ended at 10.20.\nInstructions from Walter not to move about much to-night\nin the room.

DINGWALL.\nIn this sitting the first indication of the appearance of\nthe substance was that felt on the left thigh somewhat\nabove the knee. When I touched it it jerked slightly and\nseemed as if it were pulled upwards. The first experiment\ntowards strengthening the validity of the first hypothesis\nis described in D. It failed. The \" hand \" lying on the\ntable, which was covering the nearer border of the larger\nluminous ring, when asked to move the ring did so, but\nthe movement was not independent but was caused by the\nwhole structure being pulled by the cord towards the medium.\nIt must be remembered that the violent movements which\noccurred afterwards and which are described in E, F,\nand G were in darkness. Not the slightest sign of inde-\npendent movement could be obtained in red light. From\nthe point of view of the second hypothesis this is exceed-\ningly important. Viewed from this angle the situation\nmight be somewhat as follows : the pieces of substance\nvisible at this sitting might be the same as those seen the\nnight before, and the brownish, reddish tint might be due\nto the material becoming older. The cord, made perhaps\nof some animal gut, might be fastened to the substance\nat one end, and to the other could be attached a bulb\nsecurely held between the medium.'s legs. A pull upon\nthis cord would naturally move the substance, and a\nsimilar independent movement was achieved. It is con-\nceivable also that a piece of the substance had been made\ninto a sort of bag-like structure which, when connected\n\f98] with the Medmm Margery. 115\nwith the tube and bulb, might be inflated with air ejected\nfrom the bulb by pressure of the medium's legs.\nSitting IX. {Official).\nJanuary 9, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.20 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; M. ; W. ; D.\nThis sittmg can be considered a development of the last. A\nsubstance apparently the same was felt upon the medium's thigh,\nand its coldness struck me as being marked in comparison with the\nwarm skin upon which it rested. The cord also was examined\nin greater detail, and the periods of red light were longer.\nThe searching of the medium by W. was really without value\nas also were the searches conducted by M. They were carried\nout in order to prepare the medium and F. H. for what I\nhoped would be stricter conditions later.\nAs before, I divide the paragraphs of the official reijort into\nsections. It reads thus :\nA. Psyche was dressed in a woollen bath-robe and stockings.\nShe was searched by Dr. Worcester. Mr. Dingwall and\nF. H. were searched by Dr. McDougall.\nB. A rustling sound was heard almost at once in Psyche's\nlap, and at about that time she passed into trance.\nWalter instructed Dingwall to follow up left stocking until\nhe reached the thigh. D. then reports on top of the\nwarm skin of the left thigh a mass like a pan-cake, ice-\ncold, similar to that which was described yesterday, but\nless heaped up. D. was slow in orienting himseh ; where-\nupon Walter said, \" Your hand is caught in the lining of\nthe bath-robe, follow the stocking.\" D. said this was\ntrue. Just after the rustling in the lap, a mass was\napparently laid on the table. It appeared as if the mass\non the table and the mass on the thigh were present at\nthe same time.\nC. Part of the large luminous ring was obscured by a\nfinger-like process.\nD. Under instructions of Walter, D., W., and M. were each\nallowed to feel down along the cord leading from the table\nmass towards Psyche's abdomen. All felt a ribbon cord,\n\f116 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nand described it as being |\" to 1^\" long and 1-|\" thick,\nsomewhat rough.\nE. The finger-hke processes of the mass lifted the luminous\nring and waved it about with great freedom, the fingers\ngomg as much as 3 inches above the table.\nF. We were then given three periods of red light, each\nbrighter than the last, and five seconds each. There was\nseen a mass lilve a hand (similar to lOuski's) as if it were\na sculptor's model of a hand with the deep skin markings\nacross the knuckles showing, and some marks like veins.\nG. Between the light periods a new experiment was devised\nby Walter : Dingwall encircled the cord with his right\nthumb and forefinger, the cord resting where the tips met,\nand when the cord was thus held the mass, by finger-Uke\nprocess, picked up the big luminous ring and flapped mass\nand ring with a loud noise back on D.'s hand which held\nthe cord. This was done seven times. Walter said, \" Do\nyou feel the stifi^ening in the cord ?\n\" D. said it felt\nelastic rather than stiff.\nH. A knobby mass was then shown in red light, then a\nfairly good hand, and then a mass with five sharply\npointed pseudopods like a star-fish, aU in red light.\nMcDougaU had asked to be allowed to reach across with\nhis left hand and grasp the link between F. H. and\nPsyche, F. H.'s right hand being grasj)ed by Worcester\nand McDougaU at the same time. Walter now allowed\nthis and three phenomena followed, clearly seen by all\nobservers : (1) the big ring was thrown by a black finger\nprocess from the centre of the table to Psyche's edge ;\n(2) the large ring was lifted 4\" high, and then carried\nover to Psyche's abdomen ; (3) McDougaU says the third\nphenomenon happening during his control of Psyche was\nfurther movement of the big ring. Dingwall and F. H.\nstate that the basket was moved during this last ex-\nperiment.\nJ. The illuminated plaque was then introduced. The mass\nthrew itself at once on it and followed in each case\nWalter's promise. One, two, three, four or five fingers\nof all shapes were made to suddenly grow out from the\nmass, some slowly, some quickly. Then a short, coarse\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 117\nthumb, and finally one long projection with a hook on it,\nin aU twelve inches long. All during the plaque pheno-\nmena Walter kept up almost continual conversation, mixed\nwith his characteristic laugh, all heard in between Psyche's\nobvious snores.\nK. The bandeau on her hair apparently became loose.^\nWalter said, \" It's in her eyes ; it troubles her in her\ntrance.\" Dingwall was told to pull it tight and string it\nover her ears. Thus he did with no success. Whereupon\nWalter said, \" I'U fix it. I'll put it down on her neck,\"\nand it was done promptly by Walter.\nL. Further phenomena were now observed on the plaque.\nAll Uttle fingers grew out, rather than protruded. Then\na hand appeared as i\u00a3 aU the fingers had been amputated,\nabout Y lo^g 5 then the mass became shapeless, Hke a\nclub ; the movements were sometimes violent, sometimes\nstealthy. Sometimes three fingers, sometimes five.\nM. Before the ilhiminated ring was thrown on the floor by\nWalter, it was folded up and buried under the tissue\npaper in the little basket. The basket then went up in\nthe ah, fell on its side, and was pushed into F. H.'s lap.\nN. The trance was very deep aU through this sitting, and\nPsyche was restless as to arms and legs. At one time\nher head fell forward on the table with deep snormg.\n0. At one time Walter, speaking of the great night which\nis approaching, said that on that night D. was to have\none leg, F. H. the other, and \" Dr. McDougall may have\na wing.\" Then he said, \" Dr. W. may hold her nose if\nhe feels neglected.\" Both Dingwall and McDougall re-\nported during the sitting that the mass grasped their\nhands, and made motions as if \" shaking hands.\"\nP. We were told to let Psyche wake up in successive\nexposures to red light. Sitting closed at 11.10 p.m.\nViewed in the light of the second hypothesis the pheno-\nmena of this sitting are more difficult to describe than\nthose in the last. We will consider the occurrences men-\ntioned in G, H and J. In G is described the\nphenomenon of the flapping hand. On this hypothesis I\nwould incline to the view that the mass of substance upon\n^ See note by Dr. McDougall, p. 155.\n\f118 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nthe table representing the \" hand \" was connected as\nbefore with the tube and bulb. Pressure upon the bulb\nwould force air up the tube and cause just such an elastic\ntension as I felt. Now since one hand was engaged with\nthe cord and the other controlling Margery, the forceps\nmight then have been employed to seize one end of the\nmass furthest from the medium and then flap it backwards\nand forwards over my hand. With the jaws covered with\nsimilar substance accidental touching would be concealed\nand the effect rendered highly curious and intriguing.\nIn H with change of control the phenomena are diffi-\ncult to account for, although it seems possible that a rod\nin the medium's mouth might have caused them, although\nI did not think so at the time, and am still very doubtful\non that point.\nIn J are described the movements of the mass on the\nplaque, which are very impressive. It is not easy to\nhazard even a guess how these effects might be produced\nnormally. It might be urged that inflation by air could\nproduce the effects, although their ajipearance did not\nsuggest it during the sitting. It is one of those pheno-\nmena (and by no means the only one) which are seen\nwith Margery, and appear impossible of explanation when\nseen but once. At anyrate the occurrence of such a\nphenomenon led me to persevere with the first hyj)othesis.\nIt was, however, clear that before the second hypothesis\ncould be used as a working theory, it would be necessary\nto improve the test conditions, and as a preliminary I\nthought it desirable to try to ascertain how far F. H. and\nMargery were likely to consent to this.\nAccordingly, after complimenting them both on the suc-\ncess already attained, I suggested to them that I should\nmake an effort to revive the interest of the Scientific\nAmerican in the case. My proposal was on these terms :\na gauze cage was to be employed (of the kind used with\nthe medium Willy Schneider), closed on all sides except\nfor a slit at the level of a person's knees. The table was\nto be placed in the cage, and the cage itself placed in\nfront of Margery with the slit towards her. F. H. would\ncontrol one of her hands and I the other. Professor\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 119\nMcDougall would clasp F. H.'s left hand and Margery's\nright, and Dr. Walter Prince (then Chairman of the\nScientific American Committee) would clasp my right hand\nand Margery's left. The medium and controllers would\nall wear lummous wrist bands as before. The conditions\nwere, in fact, such as would prevent any normal contact\nwith the substance for the purpose of effecting changes of\nshape and movement when it was lying on the table\nwithin the gauze enclosure.\nNeither the Chairman of the Scientific American Committee\nnor F. H. would agree, the latter giving as his reasons\npersonal objections on the medium's part to control by\nmembers of the Committee. These reasons seemed to me\ninadeqviate, and m view of the obvious insufficiency of the\nconditions hitherto prevailing as a test of the genuineness\nof the phenomena, seemed to me to lend considerable\nweight to the second hypothesis.\nSitting X. {Private).\nJanuary 13, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.45 p.m.\nPreserit : F. H. ; Mr. F. Adler (an old friend of F. H.) ; D.\nAt this sitting I had a long discussion with Walter. Assum-\ning the first hypothesis to be true, it seemed that Margery\nwanted a rest Avhen her recent illness in New York was con-\nsidered and her nervous tension recognised.\nDuring the sitting I discussed the plans for the next\nexperiments. It appeared a good opportunity to make some\ninquiry into the mechanism of the independent voice, in order\nthat rest might be secured for the medium's organism as a\nwhole. I tried to persuade Walter to say something about\nhis methods of producing the voice. Pointing out how some\nmaterial apparatus would seem to be necessary to produce the\nair waves, I suggested that, as he said the materialised ap-\nparatus was usually about three inches from the medium's\nmouth, it might be possible to obtam a silhouette of the\nmoving structure by means of a luminous plaque behind the\nmedium. All my suggestions were, however, rejected, and\nWalter, in accordance with conduct which is common with\nhim, namely, that of promising something more wonderful than\n\f120 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nthat asked by the investigator, assured us that he would show\na marvellous materiahsed head upon the medium's shoulder.\nWe then discussed the plans which I was making for photo-\ngraphic work, and finally Walter tried a few experiments with\nthe gauze cage, which was in readiness should F. H. and the\nScientific American Committee consent to the tests to which\nI have alluded above. The following is from F. H.'s notes of\nthe sitting :\nWalter came through very shortly, seemed cheerful and\nwUhng to co-operate m every way with Mr. Dingwall's\nideas. Mr. Dingwall had thought that the strain of last\nweek's sittings was so great on Psyche that it would be\nwell to wait perhaps four days longer, but Walter said\n\" No,\" that we must sit every night in order that he could\npractise ; that nothing he did would injure Psyche.\nMr. Dingwall then talked of methods to demonstrate the\nmechanics of the independent voice. Mr. D.'s idea was\nto place a faintly illuminated plaque behind Psyche's head\nso that the mechanism of si^eech would show up in profile.\nWalter said this could be done if the light was sufficiently\ndim, but his idea was better and more convincing, namely,\nto materialise his head on Psyche's shoulder, and let us\nsee him taUi.\nSitting XL (Official).\nJanuary 14, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.35 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; M. ; W. ; D.\nAt this sitting appeared what was alleged by the control\nto be the beginning of the talking head. I had tried to\npersuade Walter to allow me to devise some experiment for\ndemonstrating the independent voice, but all my suggestions\nwere, as already said, refused, and we were promised the\nmateriahsed head of Walter himself instead of the relatively\nsimple phenomena asked for. The official record reads as\nfollows :\nTrance came on more gently than usual, and was fol-\nlowed, after considerable interval, by an appearance\n\ftvith the Medium Margery. 121\napparently on table top of a vague patch, or sphere, of\nlight three inches or more in diameter, lasting 30 sees, or\nmore and then fading. Then an interval. Mr. D. : Then\nPsyche bent down her head and touched table with it,\nadjusting her left hand and my right hand in various\npositions, then rising to sitting position as before.\nThen again same light sphere appeared as before, slightly\nlarger in diameter\u2014then a hissing sound was heard^\n\u2014\napparently to D. and F. H. from the sphere on the table.\nMcDougall locahsed the sounds in later events as from the\ntable top or thereabouts. Dr. Worcester says his percep-\ntions did not tally with those of the other observers. Dr.\nW. : I saw a faint nebulous diffused light in same position\nas described. I should not be able to say I heard any\nsound as from the table. I heard a scraping noise dis-\ntinctly when Mr. Dingwall put out his hand.\nI heard four or five sounds which I should describe as\nsnorts when I extended my own hand, and I felt corre-\nsponding puffs of air on my hand, but my feeling would\nbe to refer the dnection of the snorts to the head of\nPsyche.\nWalter said he was going to show something funny.\nMr. D. : I put my hand out with palm towards W. and M.,\nand then the disc shape of light appeared (2-3 sees.) and\nthen came the hiss, and at every hiss the current of air\nwas distinctly perceptible on my palm.\nDr. M. : During these phenomena F. H.'s mouth and nose\nwere four times on my left shoulder and four times on\nthe palm of my left hand.\nDr. M. : At Walter's directions I laid right side of my\nhead on the table, at fii'st close to Psyche's edge and later\ndrawing it back at Walter's request. F. H.'s mouth was\non back of my left hand throughout and I felt no re-\nspiration from him. Then I was aware of a hand or\nhands resting about the vertex of my head. My face was\ntowards Psyche. I then felt seven or eight puffs of cool\nair on middle of my face from direction of Psyche, and\nsame time heard the hiss about 8\" from my nose,\ncoinciding with each '^v&. Mr, D. : Psyche's left hand,\naccording to Walter's instructions, was on M.'s head during\n\f122 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nthe above tests. I held Dr. W.'s right hand with my\nleft, and with my right (according to Walter's instructions)\ncovered Psyche's mouth with a folded clean handkerchief,\nmy hand covering the clean handkerchief which extended\napparently over her mouth as I used my right hypothenar\neminence as a guide which rested immediately under her\nnose ; then the hand was entirely over the mouth ; the\nhead of Psyche was slightly inclined backwards and\nI detected no sign of respiration or expiration. She\nwas sitting upright in her chair. There were eight sets\nof the hissing phenomena\u2014each time five to eight times\nrepeated.\nWalter told us to meet at eight to-morrow and to have\nthe cameras here. Then in breaking up the sitting he\ntold us to flash white hght on Psyche twice to accustom\nher to it.\n(Signed) WM. McDOUGALL.\nELWOOD WORCESTER\n(for my own observations).\nE. J. DINGWALL.\nThe phenomena discussed in this sitting were, in my\njudgment at least, exceedingly remarkable. The luminous\nappearances especially seemed to me interesting, and I do\nnot find it easy to devise a scheme whereby the same\neffects might be simulated. The light appeared to me to\ngrow in size, increase in brilliance, and then to undergo a\nseries of changes both in size and luminosity. The hissing\nnoise which proceeded from the patch appeared to me to re-\nsemble the expulsion of air from a nozzle, and, if fraudulent,\nsuggests a new use for the rubber bulb. The theory might\nbe presented as follows : Assume a tube provided at one end\nwith a bulb held between the medium's legs and at the\nother a nozzle ;\nlaying her head upon the table would be\nmerely an excuse for the medium to place her apparatus\nthereon ;\npressure upon the bulb would expel air from the\nnozzle, and so the resulting hisses would be easy of ex-\nplanation. An adherent of the first hypothesis could, how-\n\f98] ^viih the Medium Margery. 123\never, agree with Walter that one must breathe before one\ncan talk, and would await developments. After all, the\nappearance of a living talking head independent of Margery,\nshould it occur, would be difficult to simulate.\nSitting XII. {Official).\nJanuary 15, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.45 p.m.\nPresent ; F. H. ; M. ; W. ; D. ; Mr. Conant outside the circle.\nFor this sitting I had invited Mrs. Augustus Hemenway to\ncome beforehand to search the medium. I had hoped that a\nsimilar search might have been made with F. H., but he was\nunwiUing to sit except ia his usual clothes, partly perhaps that\nhe might be ready for any emergency call which might come\nthrough by telephone. It had also been arranged that Mr.\nConant should come to the sitting and take photographs if the\nopportunity arose. Just as the medium was ready for the\nsitting Mi-s. Hemenway came to me and told me that the\nright ear of the medium was bleeding. I went in and found\nthat blood and matter were running out of the ear down the\nside of her face. Upon seeing this I cancelled the sitting\nimmediately, against the will of my colleagues.\nSince Mr. Conant had come with the photographic apparatus,\nit seemed a favourable opportunity to try a flash in order to\nfind the correct focus and furnish us with a photograph giving\nan idea of the general conditions. Hardly had Margery sat\ndown before I noticed certain indications which, upon the first\nhypothesis, would lead one to suppose that the trance was\nimminent. Apprehending the state of affairs, which was of\ninterest from whichever angle one would choose to regard it,\nI incidentally resolved to make an experiment on the basis of\nthe first hypothesis.\nNow, anyone at all acquainted with the psychology of\nmediumship will be aware of the dangers of gradually per-\nmitting the primary personahty to be unduly influenced by\nthe secondary or trance personahties. In order to live in the\npractical world a dominant primary personahty is desirable,\nnay, even necessary. It is convenient, therefore, to regard with\n\f124 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\ndisfavour the slightest signs of the subject passing into dis-\nsociated states except upon those occasions when this is\ndeUberately sought. In the present instance it appeared that\nthe trance was commencing agamst the will of the subject,\nconsequent upon the suggestions both of environment and cus-\ntomary conditions. I therefore did everything I could to\nprevent this occurring, and much exaggerated the concern that\nI felt in order to note the reaction in F. H. To my surprise\nhe opposed my wishes and called for the red light to be put\nout in order to favour the appearance of the trance. This\nI forbade until after the flash for the trial photographs. Just\nafter the flash I heard Walter's laugh, and at the same time\nsaw the left corner of Margery's mouth fall, as if puUed by\na string. There was no longer any doubt that the laugh pro-\nceeded directly from her mouth, although the action by which\nit was produced was suggestive and exceedingly interesting.\nSince the medium was apparently in deep trance a short\nsitting was held in which I elaborated my scheme of testing\nF. H.'s attitude towards this important incident. The con-\nversation with Walter turned upon the pomt of joint respon-\nsibility, he for his side and me for mine. I informed him\nthat the trances must only be permitted at the pre-arranged\ntimes, and that if they came on at other times they would\ninterfere with the medium's daily life, and the result would\nbe that the sittings would be stopped. My colleagues both\napparently disapproved of this course, and Professor McDougall\nasked whether I realised that I might have an independent\npersonality on the other side with whom to deal. Moreover,\nF. H. seemed greatly delighted at Walter's success in forcing\nhimself upon us, a point upon which I had expressly exag-\ngerated my concern in order to stimulate discussion.\nAfter the sitting I discussed the whole affair with F. H.\nfrom his professed point of view. Assuming that Walter is a\nspii'it and the brother of the medium, what guarantee had he,\nI asked, for supposing that Walter will always be in control,\nsince he had aheady had experiences where foreign agencies had\ncontrolled the medium and had caused much unpleasantness ?\n^\n^ Apart altogether from this case, the occurrence of the trance states\nwhen unwanted by the subject, is, I believe, a danger signal, just as is the\nphenomenon of \"hearing voices\" in another connexion. \u2022 \u2022\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 125\nHis reply did not seem satisfactory, and the force of my\nobjection, supported by many cases from the hterature of\nthe subject, appeared not to appeal to him. I came to the\nconclusion that, bearing in mind that he was a medical man,\nhis belief in the personality of Walter could not be what he\nprofessed it to be, and thus the result of the episode provided,\nas I had hoped that it would, some suggestive material. The\nfollowing is the official record of the sitting. It will be noticed\nthat the phenomena were similar to the previous night :\nDingwall noticed some signs of on-coming trance at once,\nand then while noticing these signs Dingwall saw left\ncorner of her mouth faU and the right corner rise. At\nthat moment a laugh like Walter's was heard. Dingwall\nplaced it as coming from movith. Dr. Worcester heard\nlaugh at his right and then he heard a whistle at his left.\nF. H. placed it there also. Conant heard both, also\nPsyche.\nTrance then came on just after the trial flash light was\nburned.\nAfter discussion with Walter as to future plans, in which\nDingwall and Walter expressed opposing opinions, Walter\nsaid, \" I want to experiment with deep trance ten minutes.\"\nThis followed at once. Seven slow, deep respnations fol-\nlowed, and then a period of apparently no breathing for\nten to fifteen seconds ; then six regular respirations, then\nten to fifteen seconds silence, then five and silence, four\nand silence, etc., down to one long one. Then head and\nleft arm went on table, and head banged two or three\ntimes. After two or three times of this, whUe she was\nerect, a luminous cloud seven inches diameter, but less\ndiffused than last night, was seen at right of Psyche's edge\nof table\u2014seen by Drs. Worcester, McDougall, and F. H.\n\u2014one time accompanied by a rubbing sound three times\non table.\nSitting closed at 10.10 p.m., just as Psyche came out.\nJust before sitting Mrs. Hemenway discovered Psyche's\nright ear was bleeding. It was a dilute blood as if it\ncontained some lymph from middle ear. She had some\nache in ear all afternoon\u2014a little of it after sitting last\nnight. \u2022\n\f126 Re-port on a Series of Sittings\nIt had been decided to have no sitting this night. The\ntrance then appeared against the will of everyone present.\n(Signed) E. J. DINGWALL.\nW.

H. ; M. ; W. ; D.\nThe record of this sitting is as follows :\nOn this night, as on each night previous, Mrs. Augustus\nHemenway came before the sitting and examined Psyche,\neven to the extent of taking down her hair. Psyche was\ndressed only in a bath-robe and stockings. Dr. McDougall\nexamined Mi-. Dingwall and F. H.\nTrance came on almost at once. Vague huge patch of\nlight over left of Psyche's chest in two parts\u2014persistent\n\u2014extending downwards. Seen by Worcester, McDougall,\nand F. H.\nTwice when Psyche's mouth was held by Dingwall's\nhand over it and she was quietly and normally breathing\nthrough her nose, and F. H.'s face was on Dr. McDougall's\nleft shoulder, five to eight sounds were heard like nasal\nbreathing and loud, and not near Psyche's head\u2014^If to\n2^ feet away. Three other series occurred without the\nmouth control (D. and F. H.)\n(Signed) ELWOOD WORCESTER.\nW. McDOUGALL.\nE. J. DINGWALL.\nThe most noticeable event of the seance was the vague\npatch of light. It seemed to extend from the lower left\nhand side of the neck to just below the left breast.\nPerhaps it may be urged that the appearance was not in\nreality upon the robe as we believed at the time, but was\na patch of phosphorescent material powdered on the\nmedium's bare body and became visible through opening\nthe robe. I detected no movements on my side indicating\nthat the robe had been opened, but the possible freedom\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 127\nof the right hand should not be overlooked m this con-\nnection. As before, the most puzzling feature of the light\nwas the apparent change both in contour and brilliance,\na fact for which I have no adequate explanation, if the\npicture my memory preserves of the incident is to be\ntrusted. This sitting was origmaUy intended by Walter\nto present an example of birth and dissolution of the\nsubstance. Nothing, however, of the kind occurred. The\nreason given for the failure is, I think, important, as\nit was another of those incidents which made me\nseriously consider whether the first hypothesis was\njustified working theory. From what the control\nhad said it was clear that the extrusion of the substance\nwould resemble a normal birth, and in this respect the\ncase links up with facts already observed with other\nmediums. Whether these facts provide a basis for a\nbelief in their supernormal nature need not concern us\nhere. What is important to remember is the observation\nof the method of the extrusion of the teleplasm in\nEva C, Kathleen Goligher, etc., as vouched for by the\nwitnesses. Now, Walter directed that in preparation for\nthis great event a flat piece of wood should be provided\nwhich should rest upon the medium's chair in such a way\nthat whilst she was seated upon the part resting on the\nseat of the chair, the front part should project beyond\nthe chair about twelve inches or more. This precaution\nwas necessary, so he averred, since without it the substance\nmight fall to the floor, the cord be broken and a catastrophe\nresult. Now this statement is in flat contradiction with\neverything which has hitherto been described by reliable\nwitnesses with teleplastic mediums. I need hardly remind\nthose who read this paper (and presumably are acquainted\nwith the literature) that there are many instances in\nwhich the substance has actually fallen to the ground\nwithout any such catastrophic results. One would have\nsupposed that after the substance has emerged or is\nemerging, the vital principle animating the structure would\nhave been sufficient to maintain its rigidity without any\nexternal mechanical support. To this objection, as to all\nothers of a Uke nature, F. H., in company with other\nI\n\f128 Re'port on a Series of Siitings [PABT\ncritics, will reply in the doctor's favourite aphorism,\n\" You didn't make the Universe ;\nyou must accept it,\" to\nwhich I would respectfully rejoin that it is not a case of\nacceptance but of interpretation, and we must interpret\nin accordance with our knowledge of the facts as we are\nable to obtain them.\nThe results hitherto obtained had been so remarkable\nthat I hoped that the reality of the phenomena of the\nextrusion and re-absorption of the substance would be self-\nevident. My own provisional impression of the mediumship\nwas that the phenomena were authentic, and I had partly\ngiven my opinion to this effect to my colleagues and\nothers. I now (July, 1925) no longer hold this view, and\nadmit my change of mind, which, however, I shall again\nnot hesitate to modify if freshly discovered facts appear\nto warrant it.\nSitting XIV. (Official).\nJanuary 18, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.30 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; M. ; D.\nThe board was provided as before, but except for communi-\ncation with Walter, who again insisted on its necessity, this\nwas a wholly negative sitting.\nSitting XV. (Private). .,\nJanuary 19, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.25 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; D. ; Mr. R. W. Conant attended to the cameras\nof which there were four, one of wliich was stereoscopic and\nwas generously procured by Mrs. C. Dennett.\nMi\\s. Hemenway searched the medium as before, and the\nmedium wore bath-robe, stockings, and luminous bands as\nusual. The following is F. H.'s record of the sitting :\nDeep trance came on at once, and with fairly good rapidity,\naccomj^anied by comments and directions from Walter, we\nwere shown the actual production of the teleplasm from the\nabdomen of the psychic. From time to time the red flash\nlight was alloAved. A mass formed on the abdomen, which\nshortly differentiated itself into a fahly well formed liand,\n\f98] ivitli fhe Medium Margery. 129\nfingers downwards, attached from the wist to the umbilicus\nby a cord apparently f\" in diameter, aU white.\nLater ]\\'Ir. Dingwall put out the palm of liis hand. A\nmass was thrown on it, and although this mass apparently\ndid not move, Mr. Dingwall could feel apparently\nanother hand above it moulding the mass. And sure\nenough, the next red iiash showed a fairly well formed\nhand lying on top of Mr. Dingwall's hand, while at the\nprevious sight only the uniormed teleplasm was seen.\nWalter then told us to direct our attention to the head\nof the j)sychic, and the red flash revealed a mass like a\nhuge knobby potato, pinkish grey in coloiu\", attached to\nthe left head apparently near the ear. It seemed to be\n4^3x2 inches.\nThree flash light photographs ^ were taken of all these\nphenomena.\nWe were then allowed to see the absorption of the\nteleplasm into the body.\nSitting closed at 10.50 p.m.\nThis sitting is very important. It provided unique\nopportunities for observation : it might also have been\nexpected to provide indisputable proof of the reality of\nthe supernormal substance ; and that the extrusion and\nre-absorption could not conceivably have been engineered\nby normal means. It did none of these things. Although\nall that occurred coiild have been interpreted in two ways,\nyet I was forced to admit to myself that the evidence in\nfavour of the second hypothesis was stronger than that\nfor the first.\nThe fatal flaw in the evidential nature of these pheno-\nmena lies in the choice of the light and dark periods by\nthe Control. These ahvays are selected exactly when the\nobserver does not want them. I say always, but perhaps\nit is fair to add that in other sittings the observer some-\ntimes had his way, but then the phenomena presented did\nnothing to strengthen his first hypothesis, but rather pro-\nvided material for another. In this sitting, as I persistently\nThese and all other photographs taken during the sittings are copyright\nby Dr. L. R. G. Crandon.\n\f130 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nurged, everything depended upon the growth and re-\nabsorj)tion being carried out in red light. What was\nwanted was not the finished or partly finished product,\nbut the making of the production itself. These \" hands\n\"\nare supposed to grow, to expand, to approach perfection.\nBut we want to see these steps in operation ; to see the\ngrowth progressing ; to see the actual extrusion and re-\nabsorption. At this sitting none of these things were\npermitted except a momentary glimpse of the supposed\nre-absorption, which was not in the least impressive.\nFrom the point of view of the hypothesis of trickery the\nsteps would be somewhat as follows :\n(1) F. H. secures two or three finger-like pieces of sub-\nstance and gives them to Margery, who lays them against\nher genitals.\n(2) A larger mass is similarly arranged.\n(3) The same mass is re-adjusted. The use of a small towel\ndemanded by Walter provides the excuse for interference.\n(4) The mass has been arranged and the end of the\nstructure tucked into the navel.\n(5) The mass is substituted for another, or the same one\nis re-arranged and the \" fingers \" arranged over my hand\nwith much skill.\n(6) The whole mass is withdrawn and a single piece used\nand (1) again arranged, so that only a portion protrudes ex\nvagina.\n(7) The same or a similar mass is now placed on the\nleft cheek and ear. This mass is subsequently withdrawn\nand carried away, either by F. H. or by the medium.\nBut this hyjDothesis of normal production would be im-\npossible were it not for tlie periods of light and darkness\nselected by the control. As it was, the real observations\nhad to be made during a few seconds only, so I con-\ncentrated my attention upon but a few points. Paying\nespecial attention to the supposed attachment of the sub-\nstance to the body, I tried to discover whether the\nsubstance seemed to be really growing from the navel or\nwhether it had the appearance of having been tucked into\nthat cavity, and from what could be gathered from so\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 131\nfleeting an inspection the second mode of attachment\nseemed to be more probable. Moreover, the movements of\nthe \" hand,\" when it lay over my own were so startlingly\ndissimilar from that produced by a living hand that the\nassumption that the teleplastic hand was being manipu-\nlated by a real hand was forced upon me. Thus, if we\ncontinue to accept the first hypothesis, we have to\nassume that a second materialised hand, endowed with all\nthe attribvites of life, was manipulating the other hand in\norder to provide material for supposing that the teleplastic\nhand was moving upon mine. This is so extravagant a\nhypothesis that the second theory of normal action be-\ncomes almost irresistible, unless the objector chooses to\nregard my impressions concerning the movements of the\nteleplastic hand as due to illusion.\nAfter this incident I decided to direct my attention to\nthe point of the movements of the substance, and in the\nnext sitting it will be seen how startlingly the results\nsupport the second rather than the first hypothesis.\nThis seance marks the turning point of the inquiry.\nUntil this sitting my provisional acceptance of the first\nhypothesis, with all that it implied, had produced the\nmost astonishing results. The atmosphere of mutual con-\nfidence had provided an easy course of progressive work,\nand would have been fully justified had not the pheno-\nmena broken down at a crucial point. Many of the\nphenomena, however, remained unexplained, and I deter-\nmined to proceed as before, observing the same outward\ndemeanour, although my opinion of the validity of the\nfirst hypothesis had been somewhat shaken.\nI\nThree photographs were taken at this sitting, of wliich\nI publish three representative specimens from the twelve\nexposures made in the four cameras (Plate I, Figs. A, b, c).\nI, Fig. A, is an enlargement of the first result, and shows\nthe \" hand \" as it appeared when lying upon the body of\nI\nthe medium. The appearance resembles a crude model of a\nleft hand formed out of some skinny substance. T is the\nthumb, and F the fingers ; N is the navel from which the\n\" arm \" appears to be growing ; and Tr is a part of the\n\" wrist,\" the \" rings \" of which so strongly suggest that\n\f132 Meport on a Series of Sittings [part\nit is part of a trachea that the theory has been advanced\nthat the hand is made np out of the lung of some animal.\nWe shall discuss this later, and, in the meantime, pass to\nPlate I, Fig. B, which is an enlargement of the second exposure.\nPart of my hand is seen at DH, the tliumb being DT, and\nthe extended fingers DP. The \" hand \" rests across my\nhand, its \" fingers \" towards my thumb, and its forefinger\njust at the edge of the towel T. The \" wrist \" is formed of\ntwo tubular appendages, and the join of the \" thumb \" to\nthe rest of the \" hand \" shows a couple of orifices sup-\nported by a piece of skinny material. The surface of the\n\" hand \" shows rude skin markings and part of the fore-\nfinger exhibits a ridge or line of substance which runs down\ntowards the tip. The third exposure (Plate 1, Fig. c) shows\none portion of a stereoscopic picture of the substance at the\nside of the medium's head. A mass of material appears\nto spring from Margery's left ear, and on its outer edge\nnear the turned-up coUar of the robe lies a rude finger, RF,\nwhich resembles the second finger of Plate I, Fig. a, inas-\nmuch as it has the skin turned up at its tip. The end of the\nsubstance, which is dotted with mmute orifices, 0, strongly\nresemblmg bronchioles, seems to enter the medium's mouth.\nWe cannot discuss here the possible normal nature of the\nsubstance as revealed by the photographic results. It is\nclear that no certainty can ever be reached in this respect,\nand I hope to deal rather more fully with this problem\nin the Conclusions at the end of the report.\nSitting XVI. {Official).\nJanuary 20, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.15 p.m.\nPresent : W. ; F. H. ; M. ; D.\nAt this sitting F. H. consented to relinquish his seat to\nDr. Worcester, and occupied another between the latter and\nProfessor McDougall. With this exception the control was as\nusual. The official rej)ort reads as follows :\nPsyche was searched and examined by Mi's. Hemenway,\nand conducted into room by Mr. Dmgwall direct. Her\nhands were held or were in view on table from that time\non. From then to end of sitting Mi-. Dingwall never lost\n\f\f\fwith the Medima Margery. 133\ncontact with Psyche's left hand. Dr. Worcester held right\nhand and never lost contact with hand or wrist for a\nsecond.\nDr. McDougall searched F. H. (clothed) before sitting.\nMcDougall says this is not really relevant, because F. H.\nwas adequately controlled on both sides from start to\nfinish. Dr. Worcester agrees with this. When F. H.\nturned on rheostat, Dr. Worcester followed and held\nF. H.'s hand.\nTrance came on quietly in two or three minutes. Within\nten nlinutes Mi-. Dingwall heard oozing sound near Psyche's\nlap and then movements of her legs. Mr. Dingwall felt\nusual cold mass on left thigh small ; then Walter said,\n\" Turn red hght on two seconds,\" and we saw mass Uke\nelongated tuberosities in Psyche's left groin. Then left leg\nwent up on table, and then Psyche put her held left hand\ndown and threw mass on table.\nThen Dingwall, Worcester, and McDougall, each sepa-\nrately with back of his hand, felt mass on the table\u2014cold,\nfirmer than previously, and knobby. Mr. Dingwall says\nnot so cold as usual, more skinny and gristly, resilient.\nWalter directed next red flash to be turned on, and we\nsaw what was just now felt. To Mr. Dingwall the base\nof the cord to-day was thicker than usual, and part where\nit disappeared at edge of table it was ropy and dark\nbrown colour. We saw a heaped knobby mass ; Dr.\nWorcester saw an elongated mass extending from edge of\ntable, 2^\"-3\" Avide and 4\"-5\" long, terminating in a point\nextending north. To Dr. McDougall it seemed to have\nfinger-like processes extendmg north [sic).\nThen a photograph was taken (four cameras, one of\nwhich is stereoscopic) by flash. After this flash we could\nsee on table top (which had become luminescent from par-\nticles of Geley's powder) a black outluie more or less like\na starfish\u2014visible to Mr. Dmgwall and F. H.\nRed flash revealed a mass visible on table similar to\nwhat had been seen before\u2014^heaped up, and a cord was\nseen going down towards Psyche's knees. Dr. Worcester's\nhand was put on mass near origin of cord by Psyche's\nhand. It felt like the mass.\n\f134 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nThen on request in red flash Mr. Dingwall saw mass\npulled backwards slightly. Three times more it was done.\nDr. Worcester saw it the third time, Dr. McDougall the\nfourth time. F. H. saw it twice, Mr. Dingwall saw it\nthree times\u2014like an amoebic shrinking. Psyche very rest-\nless, light talking trance, complained of pain, headache,\nsoreness all over.\nHer head then went several times on table, lying on its\nleft side. Then trance became deeper. Walter said, \" Let\nit be there. I am going to show you something : one\npsychic phenomenon. Ha ! Ha ! Ha !\n\" Then, under in-\nstructions, red flash turned on head two seconds showed\nlarge mass front of and on right ear. Then a photo was\ntaken of the mass. Then each was allowed again to feel\nthe mass. Dr. Worcester says : \"I felt the mass twice\n\u2014flrst gently, at which time it appeared to extend from\nright temple to top of ear and front of ear. The second\ntime Psyche took my hand and pressed it with much\ngreater force against her head than I should have thought\nit wise to employ myself. By this time the mass had\nconsiderably enlarged in extent and thickness. It ap-\npeared to extend from nearly the top of the head to the\nlower part of lobe of ear. The mass thickened as it\ndescended. Nearly as I could judge it was perhaps f\"\nthick at lower end. Psyche pressed my hand strongly\nagainst the substance. I felt it to be cold, clammy, and\nquite elastic. By compression of the substance my hand\nseemed to touch the side of her head, but it was forced\nup again. This was by far the most impressive contact\nwith the substance I have had.\" Mass in red light looked\nl)rownish grey to Worcester, McDougall, and F. H., lighter\nin colour to Dingwall.\nPsyche then sat up and was wakened gradually by red\nlight periods.\nMcDougall referring back to mass on table says : \"I was\ngiven contact with it on table. I could feel the elongated\ntuberosities corresponding to what I had seen : a soft,\nresiUent mass like a membrane filled with some semi-fluid\nsubstance.\"\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 135\nSitting closed at 10.30 p.m. Examination of stool, chair,\ncabinet, and table was made before and after sitting.\n(Signed) W. McDOUGALL.\nELWOOD WORCESTER.\nE. J. DINGWALL.\nAt this sitting the phenomena were similar to those\nremarked previously with some important exceptions. As\nindicated above, one reason for the change of positions in\nthe sitters was that I wished to inquire into the alleged\nself mobility of the substance. According to the first\nhypothesis the substance is living, or at least temporarily\nendowed with what we loosely term \" vitality,\" and when\nit emerges from the body of the subject and makes its\nway upon the table, it does so by its own inherent\nqualities. Therefore, the moment it should be heard to\nfall upon the table top was anxiously awaited. The first\nindication that the substance was emergmg was the sound\nit apparently made when issuing from the body, or almost\nimmediately afterwards. I felt it on the medium's person,\nwhere we all saw it lying as described in the report.\nNow, then, was the opportunity for it to display its quali-\nties of self mobility and climb upon the table. But\nnothing of the sort occurred. Psyche put her left hand down,\nwith D.'s still controlling it, and threw the mass upon\nthe table. Is it not exactly what we should expect on\nthe second hypothesis ? The mass may have been con-\ncealed in the vagina and thence expelled ^\n; thus the only\ncourse open would have been for the medium to throw it\nupon the table and then devise means of manipulating it\nthere without the use of the hands. Movement in the red\nlight was confined to the mass being pulled backwards as\nif by the cord. The movements upon the table were\n1 1 here submitted Plate IIb to an eminent gynecologist with the\nrequest for information as to the possibility of concealing such a sub-\nstance. The following is her reply :\n\" Yes, of course it would be quite\npossible to pack a considerable portion of such substance into the\nvagina, and this could only be definitely excluded by examination im-\nmediately before putting on tights. By muscular contraction (which,\nhowever, I should think would be obvious) the substance might be held\nor partially expelled. . .\n\f136 Rejiort on a Series of Sittings [part\ncaused by the medium manipulating the mass with her\nmouth as ajDpears plainly in the photograph reproduced\n(Plate II, Fig. a). Margery, her head-band pushed up to the\ntop of her head instead of round her forehead, is seen\nwith the substance in her mouth. W. holds her right\nhand and I hold her left, whilst M. leans forward with his\nhead on the table. The mass has two or more elongated\nprojections like rude fingers extending towards the centre\nof the table, and the general position of the circle is clearly\nillustrated. The second photograph (Plate II, Fig. b) is one\nof the stereoscopic results taken from the side. It shows a\nmass of substance lying over the right ear. Extending\ntowards the neck is a projecting piece, P, upon which is a\nsharp ridge, with which may be contrasted that visible on\nthe \" hand \" seen on January 19 (see Plate I, Fig. b). From\nthe main portion springs a caudal appendage, C, and ap-\nparently joining it towards the upper part and almost at\nthe centre is seen the opening to what appears to be a sort\nof tube,^ T.

H. ; M. ; D. ; Mrs. Hemenway was seated\noutside the circle just between M. and D.\nOn the day x^revious to this sitting I received from Professor\nMcDougall the letter of January 18, since jiublished in his\narticle in the Journal of the American Society for Psychical\nResearch for June, 1925, and I also had some talk with him\nand Dr. Worcester. It is to be regretted that we had not\ncompared notes sooner, as knoAvledge of the suspicious circum-\nstances observed might have helped nie to change my working\nhypothesis sooner.\nThe following is a record of the sitting :\nUsual search of persons was made.\nOn table large and small ring, spatula and bell. Basket\nto right of medium on floor.\nAnother photograjDh taken from the front shows this tube, T, more\nclearly.

DINGWALL.\nThe results of the sitting were curious, and in one way\nsupported the second hypothesis rather than the first.\nThe levitation of the basket, which was observed only\nfleetingly by myself, and well by Dr. Worcester and Mrs.\nHemenway, might conceivably have been produced either\nby the medium or by F. H. Professor McDougall has sug-\ngested that the levitation was produced by the medium's\nright foot, but my impression at the time was that it\nwould have been difficult to have done this without exposure\nof the luminous bracelet on the right ankle, and that if,\nas the appearance of the phenomenon indeed suggested at\nthe time, the levitation had been performed fraudulently,\nF. H.'s left foot was the one probably responsible. It is\nnoteworthy that when a proper control was insisted on no\nresulting phenomena took place, but this again, like so many\nother similar facts, is capable of a double interpretation.\n:. Sitting XVIII. {Private).\nJanuary 23, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; Mrs. Stinson (mother of the medium) ; D.\nThis sitting was enthely negative.\n\f138 Report on a Series of Sittings [paet\nSittifig XIX. (Official).\nJanuary 24, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.5 p.m.\nPresent : W. ; F. H. ; M. ; Dr. Mark Richardson ; Mrs. Richard-\nson ; D.\nAt this sitting W. again occupied F. H.'s usual place. The\nsitting was remarkable for the alleged control of the medium\nby the late Professor Hyslop, who wished to communicate with\nW. I was totally unimpressed by this occurrence, and from\nmy limited experience it seemed quite unlike anything I had\nhitherto encountered, and strongly suggested simulation. There\nwere no telekinetic or teleplastic phenomena, and the record\nreads thus :\nTrance came in 5-10 minutes. Dr. Worcester :\n'\nMy\nleft hand was seized by Psyche in powerful convulsive\ngrip\u2014-the holdmg hand quivered. A long hissing sound\nwas made as of deep inspiration. Then came word\n\" Worcester,\" and in reply to cj^uery as to identity, trance\nvoice said \" Hyslop.\" Just before this Psyche's hand\njerked out of Worcester's control and struck three times\nviolently on table. I feared she would hurt herself.\nWhen I recovered her hand, her elbow was rigid and I\ncould not straighten it. Tried then for message. When\nthe voice said, \" Act at once, or aU wUl be over.\" Then\nhe said, \" My work of twenty-five years wiU be utterly\nAvasted \" (words to that effect). \"Bring it over.\"' Dr.\nWorcester said, \" I think I take your meaning ; what about\nPrince ?\n\" Hyslop said, \" He has done the best he could.\"\nWalter (Worcester) said, \" Have you confidence in him 1\n\"\nHyslop said \" Yes.\" Earher Hyslop said, \" I've been try-\ning to get at you for three days.\" The table was struck\nhard two periods\u2014three or four times. During two-thirds\nof this conversation the red light was on and the circle\nwas broken. Left leg was up in a spasm. Hyslop said,\n\" I have warned you of this before \" (see Dr. Douglas\nmemoranda). Then Walter came through and light was\nput out.\nWalter was asked to work on lighted megaphone at\nright back of cabinet ; or on luminous basket fastened\n1\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 139\nhigh in back angle of cabmet (26\" up) ; on tambourine\nlying against left back corner. He tried for an hour\napparently\u2014suggested moving megaphone forwards, and\nsaid he would do it in red Ught\u2014-but we stopped at\n11.5 p.m.\nPsyche had severe uterine haemorrhage.\n(Signed) ELWOOD WORCESTER.\nW. McDOUGALL.\nE. J. DINGWALL.\nMARK W. RICHARDSON.\nJOSEPHINE L. RICHARDSON.\nThe following day F. H. met Professor McDougall and\nmyself at lunch in Professor McDougall's apartments. We\ndiscussed the whole situation, and F. H. seemed upset and\nworried at the turn things had taken.\nDuring the days immediately preceding January 31\nthere were no official sittings. Margery was ill, and for\nvarious reasons the idea of a Harvard series had to be\nabandoned. I spent much time at 10 Lime Street, and\nF. H. and I had many pleasant talks and discussions.\nI also made some private experiments in various directions\nand made a series of inquiries, nearly all of which sup-\nported the first hypothesis as opposed to the second. It\nstUl seemed to me almost incredible that the second theory\nwas valid, and yet the failure of all the crucial tests could\nnot be overlooked. On January 27 the medium was still\nill, and an official sittmg had to be postponed. Towards\nevening, however, she insisted upon a home circle being\nformed, at which I was present. (Sitting XX.) Mr. Adler\nand Mr. Conant were present, and F. H. and myself\noccupied our accustomed places. On the table were the\nbell, two luminous rings, the tambourine, and a flat\nwooden throat spatula, one end of which I had painted\nwith luminous paint on both sides. The two small mega-\nphones stood to the right of Margery's chair, and the\nbasket rested on the mouthpiece of the one nearest the\ntable. The medium complained of headache, but the con-\ntrol laughed and talked as usual.r After a time the\nmedium, still grumbliBg, laid her head down on the table,\n\f140 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nher haix lying over the spatula. Then she raised her head\nand leaned back a little. Soon the spatula moved an\ninch or two towards her in jerks. It fell off the table on\nto her lap and remained, according to Mr. Adler's account,\nhanging down near the right corner of her chair, whence\nit subsequently fell to the ground. As these movements\nwere going on I noticed many jerks of the luminous head-\nband. The sitting closed soon after the spatula had\nfallen.\nNow, the movement of the spatula could easily be\naccounted for up to a pomt without recourse to the\nsupernormal. When the medium laid her head on the\ntable a hair might have been attached to the spatula possibly\nby means of a little wax, although it would certainly\nappear very difficult to do this efficiently. Then as she\nraised her head slowly the hair would be lengthened, and\nthen the spatula would be moved and drawn into her lap.\nIt would then fall off and remain hanging. The move-\nments of the head confirm these theories, and yet no\ndirect evidence exists that these methods were employed.\nI mentioned them to F. H., but he dismissed them im-\npatiently as unworthy of attention.\nOn January 30 Professor McDougaU drew my attention\nto certain signs upon the enlargements of the photographs\nof the two \" hands \" obtained on January 19 (see Plate I,\nFigs. A, b). Thus in Plate I, Fig. a, he noticed in the section\nmarked Tr certain ring markings which strongly resembled\nthe cartilaginous rings found in the mammalian trachea.\nThis discovery led him to the theory that the \" hands\n\"\nhad been faked from some animal lung material, the tissue\ncut and joined, and that part of the trachea had been\nused for the same purj^ose. The appearance of the\nwrinkled lookmg skin, and other indications to be discussed\nlater, are consistent with the same idea.\nOn January 31 I read before an invited audience at\nJordan Hall, Boston, an account of the sittings, the best\naccount of which was published in the Boston Herald of\nFebruary 1, 1925.\nHaving finished the official series I determined to con-\ntinue the inquiry by havmg a number of private sittings\n\f98] loiih the Medium, Margery. 141\nat which Margery and her husband permitted me to be\npresent. These sittings were to be held informally, and\nI hoped also to see some of the reported telekinetic\nphenomena in red light and possibly some more of the\nteleplastic phenomena. The first of these sittings was on\nFebruary 1.\nSitting XXI. {Private).\nFebruary 1, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9 p.m.\nPresent : F. H. ; D. ; Mrs. BroAvn ; Mr. F. Adler ; Dr. E. Brown ;\nRev. F. Edwards ; Mr. A. W. Gray.\nThis was a sitting for friends of Margery and F. H., and\nwhat F. H. calls \" An old folks at home gathering.\" There\nwere some few mental phenomena, mostly in connection with\nMr. Edwards, and these by request of F. H. have been omitted\nin the following report of the sittmg which he has drawn up.\nWalter came through almost at once, Avith whistles and\ngreetings.\nMr. Gray was told to keep his famdy away from dab-\nbling in this matter of sphituahsm ; let them come to\nLime Street if they choose, otherwise let it alone, they are\ntoo nervous.\nA partly luminous throat stick was moved along table\nand lifted from it. Its motions corresponded to motions\nof the psychic's right hand, though the whole hand was\nconstantly curled inside F. H.'s hand.\nRed hght telekinesis was promised for the next night.\nSitting closed at 10 p.m.\nThe next sitting, XXII., was on February 2, but was\nnegative. On the following day Margery appeared ill and\ndepressed, but on the same evening F. H. proposed a sitting,\nXXIII. , at which we obtained only the vocal phenomena and\nthen not in the megaphone, which phenomenon I persistently\nurged Walter to give to us. Instead, he promised the\nmaterialised talking head, although I tried to explain how\nmuch more important the voice in the megaphone would be\nif we could get it under control conditions. The refusal to\nentertain any proposals for obtaining certainty of the in-\ndependence of the voice is to be noted in this connection.\n\f142 Re'port on a Series of Sittings [part\nSitting XXIV. (Private).\nFebruary 4, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.15 p.m. ,\n,\n'\nPresent: F. H. ; Mr. F. Adler ; D.\nAt this sitting the materialisation again appeared, and again\nI took the opportunity to discover a single fact which would\nseem to prove the second hypothesis invalid and which would\ncompel me to return to the first. The masses were quite\ndifferent from those seen before. Instead of a clammy, greyish\nthickened mass appeared an object made of a rough white skin,\nclearer looking than before and more finished in appearance.\nThis is what we would expect upon either hypothesis, that is\nto say, that the regularity of forms and general finish was due\nto practice, normal or supernormal. The following is a record\nof the sitting :\nLight trance in three minutes. Then a mass appeared\non left thigh\u2014felt by Mr. D., 5\" long and 1\" thick, cool\nand clammy, heaped up\u2014softer than formerly. Psyche's\nhand combined with D.'s was on it for next 15 minutes.\nHer hands were restless\u2014a roj)y connector or cord with\nshiny rings or necks Avas felt going towards her body.\nThen a flaj) was heard on table as if mass were put on\ntable. Then it was felt by Mr. D. Then we were per-\nmitted to see it in red hght\u20142 sees., then 5 sees.\u2014like a\nsmall spaniel's head or the skull of a fish\u2014mass whiter\nthan ever before\u2014hke rough white skin\u2014soft and resihent to\nthe touch, and grew less clammy and was quite dry and\ngristly. Mr. Adler says : \"It was a soft, quite cool sub-\nstance, with whitish skin.\" We then had 6 periods of\n5 sees, each with full red light to look at it. Each time\nit appeared to take undoubtedly different forms (like stump\nof hand or a big crumpled rose, etc., etc.).\nThen the mass was seen in red light on the abdomen\nthree times. Then it appeared on the table again with\nfinger-like processes over edge of table towards Psyche.\nThen it was seen again on abdomen, showing attachment\nof the umbilicus, thick ropy. D. tried to discover if it\nwere withdrawn into umbiUcus, but canj^only say it ap-\npeared to emerge from there and so stayed. When D.\n\f98j tvith the Medium Margery.\nasked for withdrawal the mass below moved upwards as\nif jDreparatory to answering the request.\nWalter was in excellent humour. Amongst other things\nhe said :\n\" Pay no attention to her, let her groan. She\nreally hasn't any pain. Blow your nose, Kid. I'm like\nan octopus, I can attach myself anywhere and then put\nlife into it. She must sit every night. Don't ask her\nhow she feels. We have much to do in the next ten days.\"\nDuring the sitting the victrola slowed down for at least\nfifteen minutes (Walter said it was sick) and then resumed\nnormal speed.\nPsyche complauied of pain at intervals, and pointing it\nout by putting her hand on one side, on the other (D. or\nF. H.) said\u2014\" It hurts here \"\u2014and the hand was then put\non the mass or on the cord as if it were part of lier.\nWalter said :\n\" Cut three inches off the table legs.\nDingwall and I are two head apart. Let her wake up\ngradually and then rest ten minutes.\"\n(Signed) E. J. DINGWALL.\nJ. FRED ADDER.\nL. R. G. CRANDON.\nThe two classes of phenomena at this sitting were (a)\nthe materialisation and {h) the slowing of the victrola.\nThis latter phenomenon had been repeatedly observed be-\nfore my arrival in Boston, but this was the first occasion\nthat it had occurred in my series.^ The victrola is\ndriven by an electric motor attached to a lamp holder and\nruns evenly during the sitting, a repeater being used so\nthat the same record is played over and over again. I\nhad made a cursory examination of the apparatus, but\nnot being an electrician my inspection was of little service.\nOn handling the connection, however, the motor suddenly\nstopped, for what reason I was unable to discover, as all\nthe connections were securely attached. On mentioning\nthe matter to F. H. he soon remedied the fault, although\nhe did not tell me wherein the trouble lay.\nWith regard to the materialisations, these differed con-\nsiderably from those seen previously. In the first place\n1 See J. M. Bird, op. cit. pp. 321 ff.\nK\n\f144 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nthey no longer appeared solid or semi-solid, but as if in-\nflated by air. The same experiment was tried regarding\nthe mode of attachment to the navel, but again it failed.\nWhen I asked for the cord to be withdrawn into the\nnavel the mass beneath moved, but not the cord from\nthe abdomen. The feel of the cord also was different\nfrom that experienced before, and the rings or necks which\nwere tangible upon it again reminded me of what would\nseem to be perceptible were a trachea to be handled in\nthe same manner. We repeatedly handled the substance\nupon the table, both in darkness and light, and at times\nthe pressure I exerted upon the substance was considerable.\nThe ends of the \" fingers \" were stiff and skinny, and\npowerful pressure upon them produced no effect on the\nmedium, who groaned only when the whole structure was\npressed by the palm of the hand or by the fingers. This\nsitting did nothing to support the validity of the first\nhypothesis, and indeed gave material to the second. My\nattempts at obtaining a single phenomenon which would,\nif properly observed and checked, have done much to\nrestore my confidence had signally failed. The periods of\ndarkness and light were still occurring at just those in-\ntervals when they were most hindering to observation,\nand the presence of the right hand of the medium in her\nlap during a great part of the sitting was also a circum-\nstance to be noted. From the point of view of the\nsecond hypothesis there was nothing impossible in what\nhad occurred, and the appearance of the new form of\nteleplastic material was consistent with the idea that a\nfresh supply of the \" substance \" had been obtained and\nshaped accordingly to need.\nSitting XXV. {Private).\nFebruary .5, 192;'). 10 Lime Street. 8.14 p.m.\nPreseiit : F. H. ; Mr. Adler ; Mrs. Hemenway ; D. ; Mr. Conant\noutside the circle in charge of the cameras.\nThis was one of the most important sittings that I had with\nMargery, and some admirable photographs were taken. The\nfollowing is the record of the sitting :\n\ftvith the. Medium Margery. 145\nWithin seven minutes mass felt protruding from robe\nand in Psyche's lap. Then a flap was heard on the table\ntop. Then Mr. D., with right hand controlling P.'s left,\nfelt the mass on the table. Movements were heard on the\ntable, main red light then on for five minutes ; this was\nfollowed by varying periods of darkness and red light\u2014and\noccasionally by red torch only. At these lighter periods\nwe observed the object lying on the table. It appeared\nto vary in form, as if the thing was one mass which\nchanged its shape ; to F. H. and Mr. A. it appeared as\nif fingers Avere not visible at times, but the whole mass\nwas fused together like molasses candy ; to Mr. D.\nand Mrs. H. it looked like different poses of the\nsame object (to F. H. it was molten, to Mi-. D. it was\nposed).\nMr. D., by j)ermission, lifted the mass in his right hand\nand estimated it to weigh about 2\\ to 3 ounces. Mrs.\nHemenway was allowed to lift the mass in her two hands ;\nit weighed 3 ounces to her, it was cold ; it felt like a\nsoft baby's hand which was fat, no feeling of bones.\nShe lifted it in the main red light.\nTo Ml'. Dingwall parts of the mass appeared colder and\nmore clammy than other j^arts.\nMr. D. looked at mass through his magnifying glass.\nThe skin-lilie surface showed cross marks like that of a\nvery aged hand. Walter called attention to these mark-\nings three times Avith pride. He said :\n\" This mass is\nreally blood, the white corpuscles. When it goes back it\nstrikes the heat and dissolves.\"\nAfter exposure in all to red light 15 to 20 times, two\nj)hotographs were taken 6 minutes apart. The first one\nwas taken at end of a period of the main red light turned\non continuously Avhile Conant opened the cameras. At this\nperiod Mr. D. put his right cheek three times on the mass.\nIt felt cool and dry like dessicated skin. The same period\nof red Light was- on during the flash-light. This Avas true\nof both exposures. Conant Avas also allowed to feel the\nmass in red Hght. The second photo Avas of the Walter\nhand, laid across Mr. D.'s right palm upwards\u2014^photo-\ngraphed during red light.\n\f146 Eeport on a Series of Sittings [part\nPsyche, after the photos, was very uneasy, complained\n(in trance) of abdominal discomfort and pain.\nAfter second photo of object in Mr. D.'s hand, Mr. D.\nasked F. H. to keep Psyche's right hand away from\nobject to see if it would detach itself by self-movement.\nThis was done. Psyche turned in chair and object was\npulled slowly out of Mr. D.'s hand as if pulled by Psyche's\nbody. It then fell off Mr. D.'s hand on to her lap, and\nMr. D. tried to follow it but was prevented by violent\nmovements of the medium and by her placing her left leg\non the table ; her hand took his hand to outside of left\nleg away from the object.\nWalter said he would then make a hand, but after\n5-10 minutes try W. said further trial would probably\nbring haemorrhage and so interfere with next sitting.\nPsyche was weighed before and after sitting and lost\n4 lb.\n(Signed) E. J. DINGWALL.\nHARRIET L. HEMENWAY.\nJ. FRED ADLER.\nL. R. G. CRANDON.\nIn this sitting the observations were similar to those\nmade the day before except that the control permitted\nmuch more free handling of the substance. It had the\nsame appearance as before, and this time the cord seemed\nto me to have a different feeling from that previously\nexperienced. It will be remembered how in Sitting IX.\nthe cord appeared to swell when the object on the table\nmoved. So in this sitting the cord changed its shape.\nFirstly it seemed ribbon like and then round, just as if\nsome substance was passing through it into the \" hand.\"\nIn order to try to discover whether this was indeed\noccurring I obtained permission to raise the hand from\nthe table. It appeared to be a light skinny bag weigh-\ning about 2| or 3 ounces. The skin was white and\nshowed criss-cross markings, but Walter's description\nof the mass can scarcely be taken seriously. After the\nsecond photograph had been taken I determined to try\nan experiment in order to see whether it were possible to\nobtain a decisive test by the application of something\n\fFig. B,\nPlatk III\n\fFig. C,\nPlate III\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 147\nmore than mere persuasion. The complete demateriahsa-\ntion of materiahsed hands withm the hands of the ob-\nserver has been reported so frequently with other mediums\nthat it seemed to be a good opj)ortunity to try in this case.\nI therefore requested F. H. to keep the medium's hand\naway from the object and myself secured the \" hand \" in\nmy left hand. The medium at once began to turn in her\nchair and the mass was pulled out of my hand. It\nseemed simply an elastic bag and crumpled up as it was\npulled away. I tried to foUow it when it fell uato the\nmedium's lap, but she resisted strenuously, throwing her\nleft leg on to the table and forcing my hand away from\nit with her own. Another crucial test had failed com-\npletely.\nI print three photographs to illustrate this sitting. (Plate\nIII, Figs. A, B, c). Fig. A shows the \" hand \" lying upon the\ntable taken by a stereoscopic camera to the right of the\nmedium ;\nFig. b is the same taken from the left ; and Fig.\nc is a view of the \" hand \" lying over my hand. These\nresults are exceedingly interesting. In Fig. a we see a right\nhand with three fingers and part of a bent thumb curled\nround towards the left, T. It appears made of wrinkled\nskin, and on the right side on the part nearest the edge\nof the table are little pits or depressions on the surface\nresembling the cut-tube-like appearances noticed before, P.\nPlate III, Fig. B shows the hand as seen from the left. This\ntime the thumb appearance is seen to be composed of\nwhat is presumably meant to be a thumb and third finger.\nCrudely formed nails are clearly visible upon both thumb and\nfinger. The beginning of cord is seen hanging over the side\nof the table, the substance being rounded and seeming to\ndip downwards sharply as it drops over the edge. At the\nbase of the thumb is another crater-like depression like\nthat seen in the first photograph, and the markings are\nmore knobby and uneven.\nThe third photograph (Plate III, Fig. c) shows the hand\nhmply lying over the fingers of my outstretched hand.\nInstead of havuig a solid and substantial appearance it\nis flaccid and shrivelled exactly as if it had been deflated.\nThe depression seen in the second photograph towards the\n\f148 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nright hand portion of the hand is clearly visible, and the\nwhole appearance is one of deadness and entire absence of\nvitality. Indeed, the photographs strikingly confirm what\ntouch had already suggested, namely, that we have here\na dead unanimated structure which, if endowed with\nvitality borrowed from its creator, exhibits no signs of\nsuch life under close inspection and touch.\nAfter the sitting on February 5, and during the hours\nfollowing the events of the same day, I had impressed\nvery forcibly upon F. H. and Margery the extreme de-\nsirability of having test conditions for at least a few\nsittings, especially for experiments with the materialisations.\nF. H., however, was of the opinion that there would be\nno more materialisations for the present, and his opinion\nseemed so positive that I could scarcely conceal my\nsurprise. I had, however, noticed before that both F. H.\nand Margery seemed to be aware when materialisations\nwere to be expected, and this fact seems important in\nview of the second hypothesis. The reason doubtless\nalleged for this prior knowledge is that the control tells\nthem what to expect, but the control often promises\nphenomena which never occur, so that the reasonable\nposition would seem to be of expectancy and anticipation\nrather than confidence. However that may be, F. H.,\nboth on February 6 and 7, broadly hinted that the\nmaterialisations were over and should not be essayed out\nof regard for the medium's health. It is true that during\nthis period Margery appeared ill and depressed, but I had\nhoped that by February 9 she would be well enough to start\na series of sittings in the Hemenway home at which F. H.\nwould not be present. The sitting, XXVI, on February 6\nwas entirely negative, as was also that, XXVII, held the\nnext day, February 7. On February 9 Margery still com-\nplained of being unwell, and I had to cancel the sitting for\nthat night. The end of my visit was now approaching, so I\npreferred that we should hold two sittings in Lime Street,\nat which Margery should sit in her accustomed place and\nat which F. H. should not be present. I also proposed\nthat she shovild wear the luminous bracelets and head\ndisc as before, but that I should control both her hands\n\f98] loith the Medium Margery. 149\nand feet, and that on the table and on the floor around\nher should be jilaced objects, in order that we might try\nfor telekinesis under similar, although not so strict, con-\ntions as with Willy Schneider. The first of these sittings\nwas on February 10.\nSitting XXVIII. {Private).\nFebruary 10, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.10 p.m.\nPresent : Dr. Mark Richardson ; D.\nDr. Richardson sat next to me and held my left arm with\nliis right hand. His left hand was more or less free and he\nwore a luminous wistlet on his sleeve. I held both Margery's\nhands and had my unshod feet upon hers. On the table were\nthe tambourme, the sjjatula ^^'ith luminous handle, and the two\nluminous rings. On Margery's right on the ground were the\nsmall megaphone standing on its larger end with the basket\non the top of the smaller end ; the ukulele and, at the back\nof the cabinet, the Scientific American bell box. On the\nmedium's left towards the back of the cabinet stood the\nsecond small megaphone with a luminous band around it. The\narrangements for this sitting were carried out in order to de-\ntermine how far (if the first hypothesis be true) the medi-\numistic faculties of Margery were capable of overcoming the\ndifficulties of a new control. For this purpose I had arranged\nthe sitting for telekinesis only, and it will be seen how various\nobjects which had been accustomed to be used during the\nentire series of the sittings had been placed round the medium\nin all directions.\nAt this sitting there were no phenomena whatever, the\nsitting closing about 9.45 p.m. The result was exceedingly\ndisajDpointing. The complete absence of the voice phenomenon\nwas noticeable and regrettable, since my close position would\nhave enabled me to discover with some degree of assiu'ance\nthe place from which it was directed. Not one of the several\nobjects which were on the table and floor were moved, and\neven if this had been done under the conditions obtaining it\nwould scarcely have been considered entirely conclusive. The\nmedium, however, was unwell, and perhaps this may account\nfor the total failure.\n\f150 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nSitting XXIX. (Private).\nFebruary 11, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.50 p.m.\nPresent : Dr. Mark Richardson ; Mrs. Hemenway ; D.\nThe same arrangements obtained at this sitting as those on\nFebruary 10. Mrs. Hemenway held my left arm and Dr.\nRichardson her left hand. The seance was a complete failure.\nThe medium complained of headache and left the room at\n9.20 with nausea. Thus, whatever may be the reasons, the\ntwo sittings which were held under conditions similar to, although\nnot equalling in rigidity those employed with such a medium as\nWilly Schneider, were total failures. The voice was not heard\nand there was no telekinesis ; there was not even a rap.\nThis was the last sitting I had with Margery. The next day\nI had planned to go with Margery and Mrs. Hemenway to\nHarvard in order to try a few psychological tests which I\nthought might be helpful. 1 wanted to see how the medium\nre-acted to the psycho -galvanic reflex, and my friend, Mr. G.\nH. Esterbrooks, had very kindly consented to be present and\ntake the readings. When Mrs. Hemenway and I arrived we\nfound Margery ready to start, hut she informed us that F. H.\nhad expressed his strong disapproval of her visit and she would\nnot therefore come. The experiments, therefore, had to be\ncancelled, and the incident constitutes one of the very few\nexamples of suggestions made by observers which were met by\nflat refusal on the part of either F. H. or the medium. On\nFebruary 13 I left Boston e7i, route for England.\nCONCLUSIONS.\nHaving comjileted this survey of my sittings with\nMargery, it only remains to sum up my conclusions.\nI liave tried to show in the jjreceding pages what plan\nwas followed during the investigation. I was not pre-\npared then, and I am not prepared now, to treat every\nmedium as a rogue and a charlatan, although I am fully\naware that many mediums merit both those names. The\nmethods I adopted succeeded to the extent that pheno-\nmena occiured hitherto unrecorded in mediumistic history.\nNow, as I have already said, this apparent success\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 151\nmay be due to two causes : Firstly, it may have been a\nreal result of the apphcatioii of a method which as re-\ngards this medium was new ; or secondly, it may have\nbeen but a pseudo-progress cunningly arranged according\nto a pre-conceived scheme. However that may be, the\nresulting phenomena were unique in many respects. How\nis it, then, that they did not in the end insj)ire in me\ncomplete confidence ?\nNow, in the Margery sittings, as I have akeady said\nelsewhere, the first hjrpothesis was held just as long as\nseemed to me justified by my observations. Then it was\nwholly discarded for the second, I think rightly, when we\nconsider all the relevant circumstances. But, it may be\nasked, what observations were made which led me to discard\nthe first hypothesis ? What justification have I for dic-\ntating what ought, or ought not to happen, or what sort\nof appearance any specific phenomenon ought to have ?\nNow, the answer to this question depends upon the con-\nditions to which the objector refers.\nSuppose that I say that I am a medium and, sitting\nat a table in a dark room, put a sponge upon the table,\ntelling my sitters it is teleplasm. Or to take an even\nmore extreme instance, suppose that by some marvellous\ndexterity I place the sponge on the table in fidl light.\nNow, the only methods by which my sitters can investigate\nthat sponge are methods of comparison. The rules of the\ngame forfeit any cutting, or seizing, or forcible handling.\nThe thing looks like sponge, feels like sponge, and acts\nlike sponge, but can we say that it is sponge. It is clear\nthat we cannot, but are we not justified in supposing that\nit is until some quality is revealed which demonstrates the\ninapplicability of the term sponge to the object on the\ntable ? Thus, if the sponge-like substance dissolved and\nwas re-formed before our eyes, taking definite shape and\nform, then we would hesitate before saying that it was a\nsponge, although it might be an object like a sponge\npossessing these strange attributes. We neither know what\nteleplasm is nor what it may resemble. For all we know\nteleplastic formations (if they exist at all) may be just like\nsponges, white paper, chifi^on, lungs, or rubber bulbs.\n\f152 Report on a Series of Sittings [part\nBut this circumstance, if true, renders interpretation\nexceedingly hard. For how can we tell that some tele-\nplastic chiffon may not be real chiffon and a teleplastic\nsponge a real sponge ? We cannot tell unless certain\ntests are made, and the great majority of these tests are\nforbidden. It therefore appears that the comparative\nmethod is alone available, and it is precisely by this\nmethod that I was forced to the conclusion that the tele-\nplastic products shown by Margery exhibited none of these\nqualities which one would have thought that they would\nhave shown. If it be urged that we have no right to\nexpect anythmg, then the only answer would seem to be\nthat it is idle to attempt to distuiguish the genuine from\nthe simulated, and that it would be more profitable to\nturn one's attention to some subject less exasperating.\nApart, however, from all questions of probability, have\nwe any definite, fully substantiated data which may help\nus in arriving at a conclusion ? I do not think that we\nhave anything so important as this. I might quote a\ndozen incidents which favour the second hypothesis, but\nat the same time I could quote another dozen favouring\nthe first. Perhaps the one great point which supports the\nsecond hypothesis is that the phenomena witnessed by me\ncould, I think, be duplicated by normal methods, as I\nhave tried to indicate in the main body of this paper.\nWhen one sees an experiment at a magical entertainment\none can easily satisfy oneself with some sort of attempt\nat describing its modus operandi. It does not necessarily\nfollow that it is the -modus operandi used by the performer,\nbut if it has been thought out with any careful attention\nto detail, it Avill furnish the thinker with at least one\nmethod of producing the effect. So in my attempts at\npointing out the normal methods, all that I can claim to\ndo is to indicate the sort of methods I should myself use\nif I were to attempt to duplicate the phenomena described.\nProbably, if the phenomena were due to trickery, the\nactual methods used were simpler than those suggested.\nAt any rate, they show, I think, that there is some\nnormal explanation, should the phenomena prove to have\nbeen simulated. This point is the chief one which marks\n\f98] with the Medium Margery. 153\nthe case off from such cases as that of Willy Schneider\nor Pallaclino. For in these cases a normal explanation\ncovering the main body of their phenomena seems to me\nto be lacking. I cannot conceive any normal explanation\nfor what has been observed ; and it is precisely for this\nreason that in these two cases I adopt the first hypothesis\nas opposed to the second, although I am always ready to\nchange my hypothesis if sufficient facts are brought to my\nnotice which would seem to justify it. If the phenomena\nof Margery occurred under the same controlled conditions\nas those with Schneider and were then proved to be\nfraudulent, I should abandon any further investigation of\nthe physical phenomena. It is j)recisely because I am at a\ntotal loss to describe the Schneider phenomena in normal\nterms at all that the first hypothesis seems to me to be\nreasonably justified as regards his work. It was because\nI endeavoured (and failed) to secure the consent of F. H.\nand Margery to try for the prodviction of teleplastic\nphenomena inside the cage, that my mind began to turn\ntowards the possibility of the second hypothesis. The\nreasons given by F. H. for his opposition were so totally\ninadequate, and the conditions he rejected so satisfactory\nfrom the evidential point of view, that I could not fail\nto ask myself whether F. H. knew that the teleplastic\nproducts which flapped about so gamely when hands were\navailable would cease their gambols when those hands were\ncontrolled. The opportunity was so golden that the atti-\ntude of F. H. seemed to me inexphcable except upon one\nhypothesis. Similarly, the startling^ changes of January 20\nfollowing the brilHant successes of the previous experiments,\ncould scarcely fail to suggest that the self-mobility of the\nsubstance was non-existent. The one fact which stands\nout clearly in favour of the first hypothesis is undoubtedly\nthe personaHty and position of Margery and her husband,\nand the improbability of their engaging in persistent\ntrickery. Apart from this, what remains to support the\nreahty of the phenomena ? I have no satisfactory answer,\nbut hasten to add that my inability to furnish one has\n^ I refer to the decided change both in the production of the substance\nand its movements when displayed. (See p. 135.)\n\f154 Report on a Series of Sittings [PABT\nnot yet persuaded me to accept the second hypothesis\nwith all its implications.\nSince we have now discussed in a general way the\nvarious problems in this case which . clamour for solution,\nperhaps I may be allowed to point out a few comparisons\nthat can be drawn between the teleplastic products as\nexhibited in the photographs and the normal structures of\nthe animal organism. It will be remembered that it was\nsuggested by Professor McDougall that the \" hands \" ex-\nhibited certain points of similarity with the structure of\nanimal lungs, the appearance marked Tr in Plate I, Fig. a,\nsuggesting strongly part of the trachea, showing as it does\nsigns of rings which, as I have ah'eady said, might be\ninterpreted as the cartilaginous rmgs present in that part\nof the animal anatomy. Similarly the appearance of the\nsurface suggests something analogous to lung tissue, and\nthe smell of the substance which, according to Dr. Wor-\ncester, resembled the smell of the entrails of a freshly\nkiUed animal, pointed in the same direction. However\nthat may be (and there is no certainty about the matter),\nthe points of resemblance between the teleplastic hands\nand certain parts of the animal organism are worthy of\nsome attention. For purposes of comparison. Dr. V. J.\nWooUey has j^rei^ared a crude hand from calf's lung (see\nPlate IV, Figs, a, b, c).\nPlate IV, Fig. A is the lung hung against a white back-\nground for the sake of comparison. The surface of the left\nhand \"finger\" especially towards the tip should be compared\nwith the lower side surface of the forefinger of the \"hand\"\nseen in Plate I, Fig. A ; and in the same plate the trachea,\nTr, should be noticed, with which compare the trachea seen\non Plate IV, Fig. B. Plate IV, Fig. c, should be compared\nwith Plate III, Fig. a. The orifices seen on the upper portion\nof the lung closely resemble the similar appearance on the\nright hand side of the \" hand \" on the table, and also\nthe same orifices are visible upon the other unpublished\nphotographs. The fact that these and other resemblances\nappear does not, of course, prove that the objects are what\nthey resemble. Supernormal growth may closely resemble\nnormal growth. But the fact that if not supernormal\n\fI\nPlate IV\n\f\f98] with the Medium Margery. 155\nthey would require for their production the kind and\ndegree of manipulative skill acquired by hands accustomed\nto the handling of the human anatomy cannot be dis-\nregarded when we remember that F. H. is a skiKul\nsurgeon. What conceivable motive there can be for the\nfraud (if fraud it were) beyond that of testing the sus-\ntained credulity of psychical researchers I am at a loss to\nimagine. Pojmlus vuU decipi, and there is no particular\nimportance in showing it. The importance would be in\nthe deception of different observers of a high degree of\ncompetence by a medium consenting to sit under the most\nrigid test conditions. Apart from these considerations, the\nmediumship remains one of the most remarkable in the\nhistory of psychical research. It may be classed with those\nof Home, Moses and Palladino as showing the extreme diffi-\nculty of reaching finality in conclusions, notwithstanding the\ntime and attention directed to the investigation of them.\nNOTE BY PROFESSOR WILLIAM McDOUGALL.\n[The following note is taken from a letter from Professor McDougall to\nMr. Dingwall, dated May 28, 1926, in reply to an invitation to add any\ncomments wlaicli might be thoi.ight desirable.]\nThere is only one point of some slight importance in which, so far as\nI have noticed, my notes and recollections do not quite tally with your\naccount, namely in regard to the sitting Jan. 9 [pp. 115 seq.]. I recall\nfairly confidently that the forehead limainous disc was displaced before all\nthree of the occasions on which I controlled for a few seconds the right\nhand of Margery as well as F. H.'s left hand. . . . The disc, you will\nremember, became visible to me and at least one other at the moment\nthe third movement of the ring concluded and was seen retreating\nupwards from the table. I have described this in my article in the\nA.S.P.R. Journal [June, 1925, pp. 300, 301]. Its importance is that\nthese three occasions were the only ones upon which the telepjlasm\nseemed to move {i.e. more than a very slight withdrawal due to pull on\nthe cord) when M's [Margery's] right hand was controlled ; and the\nmovements of the teleplasm are the only grounds for regarding it as\nsupernormal. . . .\n(Signed) W.

What an unworthy contrast do we here behold\nto the courage and self-respect of Richet, Geley and Schrenck-\nNotzing ! The Research Officer had the opportunity of being\ntlic official discoverer of the outstanding physical mediumship\nof modern history, but he \" had eyes and saw not.\"\nThe inaccuracies, in fact, are so many that it is futile to\nattempt to list them. The \" Margery \" mediumship, as always,\nis ready to stand or fall on the notes made at the time and\nsigned by all sitters. The modern laboratory method has no\nplace for afterthoughts or \" facts \" made to help out an\nhypothesis.\n\f98] Note by Dr. L. R. G. Crandon. 157\nThe old Biblical sage wistfully remarlced : \"Oh, that mine\nenemy would write a book.\" He knew, as well as we, that\nwhen a man starts to write on a subject which contains any\ncontroversial element whatever, then the chances are rather\nmore than even that the result will be something extremely\nvulnerable or jjatently ridiculous. When Mr. Dingwall thus\nanalj^zes the \" Margery \" phenomena it is obvious that he\nmust reason as follows :\n{a) If I pronounce these phenomena genuine and they are\nthereafter admitted by the scientific world to be genuine, I\nam, as a psychical research officer, instantly functus officio.\n(b) If I pronounce these genuine and \" Margery \" or F.

Could any course he more prudent or\nmore ingenious ?\nFrom start to finish Mr. Dingwall has not jiroduced one\nscintilla of probative evidence that the \" Margery \" jihenomena\nare not supernormal. He has propounded a multitude of\ntheories of infinite variety as to how these things might have\nbeen done normally. I have a better theory still.

[part\nNo matter how good the control of \" Margery \" and myself,\nthe show would triumphantly proceed, unless a cold in the\nhead should cause the accomplice to sneeze ! Q.E.D. In\nreality there is not one debatable point raised by Mr. Dingwall\nwhich has not in the past year been resolved in favour of\nsupernormality. Under conditions of control, more severe than\nany suggested by Mi'. DingwaU, evidence has been amassed\nto a degree unsuspected by him. I have no space here to\ndetail it. Some of the later developments such as described\nin the Journal of the American S.P.R. are known to Mr.\nDingwaU. A patient awaiting of scientifically collated results,\nwould, I think, have been wiser than his present excursion into\nthe realm of fanciful hypothesis, which excursion is, to use\nMr. Dingwall's own phrase, \" highly curious and intriguing.\"\nI am temjoted, using the words in a purely Pickwickian sense,\nto lay down two hypotheses to explain Mr. Dingwall's treat-\nment of the subject as far as hypothetical explanation goes.\nHypothesis I. The author is a nut.-*-\nHypothesis II. The author is a nut.\n\" The evidence seems to me at one time for and at one\ntime against \" one or the other of these hypotheses, but I\nam consoled by the fact that ultimately Mi'.

Till that time, all of us must be\npatient.\nL. R. G. CRANDON.\n1 This is an American word meaning an amiable individual whose\nratiocination is erratic.\n\f98] Review. 159\nKEVIEW.\nMk. Hudson Hoagland's \" Report on Sittings with Margery.\"\nAtlantic Monthly, November 1925.\nThe '\nMargery ' problem, elsewhere amply dealt with in the\npresent volume, is one of such constantly shifting scenes that\nit is almost impossible to keep pace with its development.\nWe have first the operations of the committee of the Scientific\nAmerican, who, after something like 90 sittings, arrived at\nconflicting conclusions : the majority negative, the minority\npositive regarding '\nMargery's '\nclaim to supernormal faculties.\nWe then have Houdini's '\nexjsosure,' the accuracy and method\nof which appears disputed by at all events some of the above-\nmentioned majority. Next, IMr. Ding-wall's series of experi-\nments, and his Report, noAv issued, from which it appears that\ncircumstances led him to box the compass of most opinions\nand to end with none. Then Mr. Bird's book, which, however\nit may be open to criticism as regards details, yet unquestion-\nably puts up a claim for the occiu'rence of certain phenomena\nnot lightly to be dismissed. Then at last, in November, there\nappeared in the Atlantic Monthly an article by Mr. Hudson\nHoagland, a member of a committee of young Harvard\ngraduates, with which was associated a casual sprinkling of\nmiscellaneous scientists, which, taken at its face value, cer-\ntainly seemed to give the death-blow to '\nMargery's '\nclaims\nas a medium. An analysis of this Report, in conjunction with\nlater developments, shows, however, that the end is not yet,\nand that before these claims can be regarded either as esta-\nblished or scotched beyond reasonable question, a much more\nauthoritative verdict must be awaited. In short, the Report,\nsomewhat magniloquently described by the Atlantic Monthly\nas '\nthe Chmax to a Famous Investigation,' is not a chmax\nat all.\n\f160 Everarcl Feilding. [part\nI confess I do not share the view, which has elscAvhere been\nfreely expressed, that by virtue of their youth and inexperience\nin psychical investigation the Harvard committee was incom-\npetent to undertake it. On the contrary, from the full notes of\nthe experiments now pubUshed in a pamphlet entitled Margery,\nHarvard, Veritas (Blanchard Printing Co., Boston, 1926) by a\ngroup of '\nMargery's '\nsupporters, and which claim to appear\n\" absolutely as witten and signed,\" ^ it would seem that not\nonly were the intentions of the committee both serious and\nhonest, but the conditions which they imposed or attempted\nto carry through were well considered and their tests ingenious\nand effective. It is rather the behaviour of the committee,\nor certain members of it, towards one another and towards\n'\nMargery '\nand her husl)and, and the almost preposterous\nconclusions to which they arrive, which lead one to doubt\ntheir competency, and which are so surprising as to leave one\nAvith a conviction that, in order to make the whole story at\nall vraisemblable , we must supply some fact or motive hitherto\nundisclosed and one which, if known, may go to the root\nof the whole matter.\nI have, before writing this, had the advantage of reading\nMr. Bird's review of the Hoagland report in the December\nJournal of the American S.P.R., to which I would refer\nreaders Avho wish to get a more complete account of the\nfacts. Mr. Bird, who as Secretary of the Scientific American\nCommittee, pronounced in favour of '\nMargery's '\nmediumship\nand has since ranged himself wholeheartedly with her sup-\nporters, was obviously in a difficulty when dealing with Mr.\nHoagland. Making all allowances for his position, his review\nis, to my mind, an exceeduigly able and fair-minded produc-\ntion. I see that he arrives at the same conclusion that\nI had independently come to, that we have not been told the\nwhole of the story.\nAnd now for the story itself. Mr. Hoagland described how\nduring the latter part of Mi'. Dingwall's visit he became\nacquainted with Dr. and Mrs. Crandon and, with some other\nHarvard friends, was admitted to sittings at their house.\nThough several of the jjarty were franldy sceptical, the\n^ The accuracy of this claim has since been denied by the authors of\nthe notes and, in reply, reasserted by the editors of the pamphlet.\n\f98] Review. 161\nCrandons welcomed their criticisms and suggestions, impressing\nthem with the sincerity of their attitude, and readily acquiesced\nin their proposal to put the investigation on to a laboratory\nbasis and to hold sittings at Harvard. Certain conditions were\nimposed. Sitters were not without '\nWalter's '\nconsent to touch\nor pidl any telejjlasmic arm, nor to use any light, white or\nred, during the sittings, nor to expect to use new methods,\napparatus or controls. Dr. Crandon was to attend the sit-\ntings, bvit, subject to the exclusion of any internal medical\nexamination of the medium, both he and she were willing to\nsubmit themselves to search. I do irot find, however, in\nMr. Hoagland's Report any reference to certain other important\nagreements which, as I learn from the various documents before\nme, were also made, e.g. that the signed notes of each sitting\nshould be delivered to Dr. Crandon before the next sitting, and\nthat if no suspicion of fraud is entered in these notes it shall\nbe deemed non-existent. Nor do I find mention of the pledge\nto silence with which Mr. Bird says these young gentlemen\njiledged one another, and Dr. Crandon, and Mr. Bird himself,\nand everybody else concerned.\nBut to continue with Mr. Hoagland's story. They held\nsix sittings at Harvard, beginning on May 19, 1925, and two\nat Mr. Hoagland's own house with the same group. It is\nnot my intention to burden this notice with details of their\nexperiments, for which readers should refer to the original\ndocuments already mentioned. It is enough to say that from\nthe beginning the medium and her husband and, later on, all\nl^resent wore luminous elastic bands on foreheads, Avrists antl\nanldes. Although Dr. Crandon attended the sittings and,\nexcept at the final sitting on June 30, controlled the medium\non her right, he was liimself also controlled by Mr. Hoagiand,\nwho \" factually and visually controlled Dr. Cirandon's hands\nand Mrs. Crandon's right hand, as well as the Doctor's knees\nand head,\" establishing what was called '\ndouble control '\n;\nand Mr. Hoagiand stated that it was with this double control\nthat most of the phenomena occurred. Another investigator\nwas assigned the task of visual control of the feet (by means\nof the luminous bands), and a third that of the head bands.\nAt most of the Harvard sittings there was an ajDparatus to\njjass an electric current through the entire circle of sitters\nh2\n\f162 Everard Feilding. [part\nwliich instantly registered in the hall, where an observer was\nplaced, if anyone broke the circle. In these circumstances\nphenomena resembling those familiar at the medium's own\nhouse occurred. \" Apparently something resembling an arm,\npresumed to be telejalasm, came from the lower portion of the\nmedium's body and moved objects within a radius of several\nfeet of her. This terminal was silhouetted against the luminous\nsurfaces of objects j^icked up [by it], and showed variations of\nshape from time to time.\" Weights were lifted which a spring\nbalance\u2014on which, on one occasion, the medium's chair was\nmounted\u2014showed were added to the weight of her body.\nSitters were touched by the teleplasm on the backs of their\nhands or heads ; hair and clothes were pulled ; small luminous\nobjects were lifted ; the bell-box, described in Mr. Dingwall's\nReport, was rung ;\nand, in short, more or less the whole\nprogramme familiar to those who have read that Report was\nrepeated. In addition, a coordinate board, 16 ins. x 24 ins.,\nruled off in inch squares by fine lines of luminous paint, was\nintroduced in the course of the sittings with the object of\ngetting '\nWalter '\nto pat his terminal out over this dimly\nluminous field and leave it, so that the coordinates could be\nread to the dictaiahone and dimensional drawings of the\nsilhouette could later be produced. Mr. Hoagland says that\nWalter '\nwas most oljliging in this resj^ect, sometimes showing\nas many as three different structures on the board at once,\nthough of these only one at a time was active, the others\naj^parently being motivated by the active arm. This active\narm was always moved rapidly over the board so that prior\nto the sitting of June 2!) they were never able to get an\nadequate idea of its dimensions, except that it was long,\nreaching the full length of the board on occasion, that it\ntaj^ered away from the medium and jjossessed a sort of crook\nor liockey-stick formation at the further end. The other\nobjects varied in shape, and were described in the notes as\nstarfish and general irregular forms, one very common shape,\nhowever, being that of a rectangle, rounded and somewhat\npointed at the front end, and about eight inches long and two\nto three inches wide. The importance of this observation will\nbe appreciated later on. The control exercised was dictated\nat the time to a dictaphone, and an examination of the notes\n\f98] Review. 163\nwitten out afterwards and signed shows that in almost every\ncase this control, of both hands and feet, is reported as\nperfect.\nWe now come to the seventh sitting held at Mr. Hoagland's\nhouse on June 29th.\nAfter a number of phenomena, including a long-drawn\nattempt by Walter to tie a knot in a rope, Mr. Code, one of\nthe younger Harvard group, reported that the medium's\nright ankle band was off. '\nWalter '\ndenied this (untruthfully,\nas he admitted at the next sitting, explaining that he did so\nto prevent an explosion from a rude professor from the Middle\nWest who was making a mock of the proceedings generally),\nand covered part of the complete luminous circle on the floor\nwith something. A minute later '\nWalter '\ncalled attention to\nthe anklets. The left one seemed normal, but the right one\nslightly elongated as if over both instep and heel. '\nWalter\n'\nsaid, \" I can hide them from you any time I Avant,\" and\nproceeded to obscure most of the right anklet. The notes\nsay : \"It was clearly not the left foot that obscured the\nright anklet.\" At the end of the sitting both the bands\nwere found on the feet roimd the instep and heel, but not\nround the anldes as at the beginning of the sitting.\nAfter this came a levitation of the so-called '\ndoughnut,' a\nring of luminous paper, which '\nWalter '\nbrandished near the\nface of the above-mentioned rude Middle West professor, who\nblew at it violently and caused '\nWalter '\nto drop it from the\nend of his terminal. '\nWalter ' thereupon regained it, this\ntime holding it more firmly, and insisted on the professor\nblowing again, which he did three or four times unsuccessfully.\nThis indiscretion on the part of \"\nWalter '\nafforded Mr. Hoag-\nland the opportunity he had long been wanting, since it gave\nhim a fairly extensive silhouette of the terminal against the\ncoordinate board as it held the doughnut in the air for some\nseconds. What he saw holding the doughnut appeared to be\na human right foot, the toes clamped over the periphery of\nthe disc, creasing it in a way verified on examining it after-\nwards. Further, by shifting his position, he clearly saw the\nankle and leg silhouette to a point above the knee, and since\nthe operation was successively repeated he was able to check\nhis observations several times.\n\f164 Everard Feilding. [PABT\nImmediately after the sitting, Mr. Code, who is said to be\na clever magician, and whose suspicions were previously\nawakened by his observation of the dropped anl?let, proceeded\nto give Mr. Hoagland and another sitter an imitation seance,\nwith himself in the role of '\nMargery.' Controlled in the same\nmanner by these two, and with the anklets over his bare\nfeet, he contrived, under an assumed trance restlessness, to\nremove his slippers and to take off the right anklet, covering\nthe rear half of the band, which was luminous inside and out,\nwith a slipper, giving the impression that it was still on his\nankle. With his right foot now free, he proceeded to duplicate\n'\nWalter's '\nvarious effects. He rang the beU-box, levitated the\ndoughnut, pulled hair, vnitied Hoagland's shoe, and produced\nsilhouettes on the coordinate board, even showing two terminals\nsilhouetted at once, by the use of his leg and a slipper, which\nlatter produced the same effect as that of the rounded\nrectangular object previously mentioned, which might, therefore,\nin its turn have been produced hj the medium's slipper.\nWith practice he even prodiiced three objects at a time, the\nthird being part of the di-essing gown which he wore. Mr.\nHoagland suggests that some of '\nWalter's '\nshapeless objects\ncould readily have been produced by a corner of the medium's\ndressing-gown. It is claimed that the effects of Code's leg-work\nproduced phenomena identical with those of '\nMargery ' in so\nmany incidental details, which I need not particularise, as to\nleave little doubt that similar means could have been employed\nby her. The inference obviously was that '\nMargery ' had\ndone everjrthing with her leg, and that the observer told off\nto watch her feet had been amazingly unsuccessful at his job.\nAs it was, however, still arguable that it was her psychic and\nnot her normal leg, the experimenters were willing to give\n'\nWalter '\nanother chance.\nIt is stated in the notes to the sitting which preceded\nCode's imitation that the bands used had been supplied by\nthe observers, and that though the medium had complained\nthat they were too loose and had attempted to tighten them\nwith safety pins, the band's coming off was made laossible\nby the carelessness of the observers. Also, that it was agreed\nthat for the next sitting the medium should be asked to wear\nluminous bands of adhesive plaster instead of the old ones of\n\f98] Review. 165\nelastic tape. It may also be noted, in view of what followed,\nthat there is an addendum by Professor Shapley, ^x}lo now\nattended as a guest of the younger Harvard group, recording\nan understanding that every effort would be made to avoid\npubhcity with regard to the investigations, to which the five\nmembers of the group appended their signatm-es, agreeing to\nthe above understanding, among others.\nThey approached the nest sitting with interest. If '\nMargery's\n'\nleg was to be immobilized and no phenomena occurred, it\nwould naturally be a strong confirmation of their hypothesis.\nMr. Hoagland says that before the sitting '\nMargery ' herself\ncomplained that they had supplied her with inadequate bands\non the previous occasion, and suggested the use of surgeon's\nplaster to prevent the bands from falling off. The first thing\nthat happened was that '\nWalter '\nshowed an uncanny knowledge\nof what had happened after the last sitting, of Code's\nimitation of the phenomena and of the conversation generally.\nHe then warned them to control the medium's feet not only\nby watching, but also by holding them, after which he\nproceeded, much to Mr. Hoagland's amazement, to produce\nwhat seemed to be his usual terminal and rang the bell-box.\nIt soon appeared, however, that there was a marked difference\nbetween the '\nteleplasm '\nof this evening and that of previous\nsittings. The silhouette showed long tapering fingers instead\nof the stubby formations formerly seen, and the reach was\nonly about one-third of what it had been. Whereas previously\n'\nWalter '\nhad generally confined himself to touchmg the backs\nof hands or heads, he now readily allowed the sitters to feel\nhis ' hand,' which was cold, moist and flabby, with fingers\nconsisting of long, cordlike structm-es. It was also noticed\nthat there were slight but distinct movements of '\nMargery's\n'\nright hand correlating with the movement of '\nWalter's,'\nleading to the inference that some artificial object was being\nmanipulated by it, in spite of the presumed control of it by\nCode, who, in accordance with tlie arrangement come to the\nnight before, had taken Dr. Crandon's place at '\nMargery's\n'\nright. At one time there were two hands on the table,\nvisible against the coordinate board, one being well formed,\nand the other bemg \" a long extension shaped like a cat's\ntail.\"' After one of these appearances it is reported in the\n\f166 Everard Feilding.\nnotes that Code's left hand, controlling '\nMargery's '\nright,\n\" has been on her right knee continuously.\" It is unnecessary\nto give further details, though I may note that at the end of\nthe sitting Code reports that \" Walter's farewell chuckle seems\nto be high above '\nMargery's ' head.\" I mention these two\nobsei-vations specifically because they seem to show that, in\naddition to falsifying the phenomena as Avill presently appear,\nCode must even have been falsifying the notes.\nAnd now for the alleged explanation of all this. After the\nsitting, according to Hoagland, Code proceeded to coniide to\nhis associates that, following the sitting of the night before,\nwhen he thought he had solved the means of the production\nof the phenomena, \" he began to look with concern at the\nhuman problems involved.\" He had formed a sincere friend-\nship for both Dr. and Mrs. Crandon, who had at all times\nshown the utmost goodwill towards them all, as well as genuine\nfaith in the jihenomena, and he thought the most likely\nhypothesis was that the Doctor, at least, was sincere. He\nwent further than this, and thought that Mrs. Crandon herself\nwas also probably sincere, and he evolved a theory that, based\non a genuine belief in spiritism, on the powerful unconscious\nsuggestion of Dr. Crandon, on the psychic literatiire she\nhad been reading, and under the inlluence of the circle of\nsympathisers, an artificial dramatic '\nWalter '\npersonality had\nbeen created, into which she would lapse casually, unremembered\nby her normal consciousness, both in and out of seances, thus\ncausing her not only innocently, so far as her normal\nconsciousness Avas concerned, to produce the phenomena in the\nseances, but also to prepare beforehand the artificial accompani-\nments and ajiparatus generally. Moved, therefore, by friendship\nfor her and her husband, and in order to prevent a catastrophic\nexjjosure of the mediumship, he had visited Mi's. Crandon that\nafternoon, told her of their discoveries the previous evening\nand of their expectations for the forthcoming seance. (This, it\nAvill be seen, explained how '\nWalter \"\nhad acquired his knowledge\nof what had happened at the imitation seance.) He then,\nconfirmed in his belief by the conversation, decided to help\nMrs. Crandon out. Though Hoagland saj^s nothing of this in\nhis Report, it seems, from the other documents before me,\nthat Code claims to have adjourned with Mrs. Crandon to the\n\f98] Review. 167\nseance room at the top of the house and to have had a\ndayHglit seance at which he ai^ranged Avith '\nWalter '\nthe\nprocedure for the evening, and agreed to release '\nMargery's\n'\nright hand to facilitate an alternative method for the produc-\ntion of the phenomena which had hitherto been produced by\nher leg.\nAnd this is what he says that, unknown to liis colleagues,\nhe actually did. As a free hand alone is insufficient to\naccount for what occurred, it is further necessary to suppose\nthat other objects, felt and shown on the coordinate board,\nhad been prepared beforehand, and concealed internally in\nsuch a way as to escape the search before the seance ; for\nit is at all events not claimed that, in addition to putting\nher own arm at '\nMargery's '\ndisposal, he extended his courtesy\nso far as to offer the hospitality of his pocket for the disposal\nof these objects.\nIt is not only Code's conduct, to the strangeness of which\nI shall rev^ert later, but also that of the rest of the committee\nwhich seems remarkable, if judged by ordinary standards.\nNotwithstanding the pledge of secrecy to which I have\nalluded, Mr. Hoagland prepared the Report which I am con-\nsidering, in which he was assisted by Code under the belief\nthat it was destined, not for pubhcity, but for a strictly scientific\ncircle ; and then, without the assent of his coUeagues, proceeded\nto send it to a popular magazine. Code, to do him justice,\nprotested against this, and promjjtly released Dr. Crandon\nfrom the pledge under which he too was bound not to\npubHsh the notes of the sittings which, superficially at all\nevents, even down to the end, appear to be in '\nMargery's\n'\nfavour.\nA reviewer unacquainted with the personalities in the case\nis at a great disadvantage when trying to appraise the value\nof the Hoagland Report. A& Mr. Bird says, it is well done,\nand he admits tliat he does not see how, to one having no\nfurtlier source of information, it could be other than con-\nclusive. I quite agree, but its full acceptance seems to me\nto depend on affirmative answers to the following questions :\n(1) Is Code telling the truth about his interview with\n'\nMargery 1 and his arrangements -with her\u2014or with 'Walter,' if\none admits the validity of his theory of the complete dis-\n\f168 Everard Feilding. [part\n\u2022\nsociation between these two\u2014to collude in the phenomena at\nthe last sitting ?\n(2) Was his imitation of the phenomena really as successful\nas claimed, and was it performed in the same conditions of\ncontrol ?\n(3) Assuming the freedom of a leg in the first six sittings\nprior to that of June 29, could aU the phenomena then\nmanifested have been produced by it ?\nAs regards the first question, if one has only Code's conduct\nand such poor evidences as he offers for the possession of even\nthe gUmmerings of common sense to go upon as credentials for\nhis good faith, T should esteem the answer somewhat doubtful.\nThe theory of the real imiocence of mediums caught flagrante\ndelicto is a favomrite one among spiritualists, but while I am\nnot prepared to deny tha.t in certain cases, where no apparatus\nis used, it may, and probably has, some validity, I think that\nto apply it to such a case as this, where long, elaborate and\nskilful preparation is indispensable, argues an unsophistication\nof intellect, to put it mildly, which I can scarcely believe\npossible in a Harvard graduate. But apart from his capacity\nfor reasoning, Mr. Code's ideas of the line of conduct demanded\nby friendship on the one hand, or loyalty to colleagues on the\nother, seem to be little less than pathologically peculiar. To\nsave '\nMargery ' from an exposm-e he leads her\u2014it must be\nassumed under a pledge of secrecy\u2014^into further fraud, and\nthen immediately, that very night, splits on her. Further, by\nway of assisting his friends in their investigation, he stages\nan elaborate deceit in which he himself takes part, without a\nword of warning to them beforehand. Of course, Mrs. Crandon\ndenies the whole story, and there is a suggestion of an\nundisclosed eavesdropper at the interview who confirms her\ndenial. She admits that Code told her of the grouji's con-\nclusions and offered to release her hand at the next sitting, and\nsays that she indignantly declined. And that Mrs. Crandon\nwould be so innocent as to walk into a trap laid so openly is,\nto judge by all one has heard of her extremely alert intelligence,\nat least as unbelievable as Code's theory of her sweet natural\nguilelessness if the phenomena are fraudulent.\nThe interview at which the collusion was arranged must\nindeed have been a strange one, for I find in the pamphlet\n\f98] Review. 169\nMargery, Harvard, Veritas a quotation from a letter from Code\nto the Boston World of October 25 to the following effect :\n\" Margery never '\nconfessed '\nto me at any interview or sitting,\nprivate or public, nor did I ever say she did.\" It is difficult\nto understand how one can arrange to become an accomplice\nto a person who does not admit that she needs one. IMr.\nCode will, I presume, say that it was '\nWalter '\nwho confessed,\nnot '\nMargery.' So that one must suj^pose that after Mrs.\nCrandon had been charged with fraud, and denied it, she\ndeliberately granted a dayUght sitting to enable Code to make\nthe same charge to '\nWalter.' It seems on the face of it\nremarkably improbable. \" People don't do such things,\" or\nif they do, there must have been some motive actuating\neither Mrs. Crandon's or Mr. Code's behaviour which wholly\neludes the public.\nAs regards my second question, Mr. Bird tells us that he,\ntoo, had a two-hours' session with Mr. Code, in which the\nlatter exhibited his mediumistic prowess. He says his repro-\nduction of a certam part of the phenomena left little or\nnothing to desire, but that his attempts to reproduce others\nwere a gross failure. For this, indeed, lack of long ]oractice\nwould normally account, but he says the failure was made\nworse by Code's comj)lete lack of appreciation that he had faUen\nshort.\nAnd as regards my third question, it is quite impossible, as\nI have foimd in other cases, to judge of the feasibility of this\nor that effect from a \\\\Titten record. Mr. Bird is of opinion\nthat even at the one seance at which he attended it would\nbe necessary to suppose some other agency than a mere leg.\nHow far his opinion is coloiu'ed by his other beliefs I have no\nmeans of judging.\nTo sum up : IVIr. Bird, who says he has had close and\ncordial relations with Code for some months, coixfesses that it\nis extremely difficult for him to believe that either he or\nMrs. Crandon is deliberately lying about this question of the\ninterview. Yet, as he points out, one of them is obviously\ncarrying a desperate lie to the last desperate ditch. For me,\nwho am unable to judge of the personal equation, it is impos-\nsible to form any opinion on so deUcate a question as to\nwhich is the culprit. The scales, of course, are heavily\n\f170 Review. [part 98\nbalanced against a medium on her defence, while the only\nmotive that can reasonably be ascribed to a departure from\ntruth by any of the Harvard men is that which is indicated\nby '\nMargery's ' supporters, viz. that the scientific prejudice\nagainst an acceptance of this class of phenomena is so strong\nthat their reputation and position at the University would be\ngravely imperilled by their endorsement of it. On this point, a\nstatement by one of the group appears in the New York Times\nof March 4, 1926. He says :\n\" Harvard, far from discouraging\ninvestigations, helped us all it could ; its psychological depart-\nment lent us a laboratory and agreed that Mrs. Crandon's\nmediumship might be treated as a subject for a possible\ndoctorate thesis if results were obtained constituting a '\ncon-\ntribution to learning.'\n\"\nBut it would seem that whether or not '\nMargery,' like most\nother mediums, helps out her phenomena, if phenomena there\nare, by the use of her leg, and by the concealment about her\nof pieces of lung or other normal substances, her repertoire\nis of such a character that the Hoagland report is not likely\nto be accepted as definitive. She is now, according to latest\nreports, in order to meet the Hoagland criticisms, sitting in\na closed and locked glass cabinet, with, her hands emerging from\nholes at either side and bound with wire and sealed, and\nwith her head and feet likewise bound and sealed within,\nand yet objects placed within are raised and moved in graceful\ncircles high above her head. She also succeeds in overcoming\nthe ingenious apjoaratus invented ])y Dr. Mark Richardson,\ndetails of which will be found in the highly interesting\nDecember number of the Journal of the American Society for\nPsychical Research, for rendering it impossible for her to use\nher own vocal organs daring the production of '\nWalter's\n'\nvoice, thus apparently demonstrating the independence of this\nvoice from the medium's. And until Houdirii, who has now\nmade it his business to expose by imitation the effects of\naU the best-known mediums in the United States, succeeds,\nin the same conditions (which seems not to be his invariable\npractice), in imitatmg these phenomena, judgment must, in\nmy opinion, be suspended as regards the finality of the\nHoagland Report.\nEVEBAKD FeILDING.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 99\nJULY 1926\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.\nPsychical Research and Established Science.\nDelivered at a General Meeting of the Society\non March 18, 1926.\nBy Dr. Hans Driesch.\nThe historian of the future will assign to the Society for\nPsychical Research a value and rank not inferior to that\nwhich he attributes to those great societies and academies\nof the past which have laid the foundation stones of new\nand important constructions in philosophy and science, and\namong which the academy of Plato is the most famous.\nYou may see from these words how highly I esteem\nthe honour which you have conferred on me by electing\nme your president. The election has indeed been a real\npleasure to me, and there is only one point that might\nhave prevented me from acceptmg it : the question\nwhether I am worthy of this honour.\nTo tell the truth at the very beginning : I have never\nmade a successful psychical experiment myself, though I\nhave tried to do so. I have seen some phenomena, but\nonly as a spectator. Thus the only possible thing I may\nM\n\f172 Dr. Hans Driesch [part\nclaim to have done for the elucidation of our great object\nis this, that I have prepared its road in a certain way.\nFor my own manner of thinking and working, both in\nbiology and psychology, has led me to theoretical ideas,\naccording to which the phenomena called \" psychical \" are\nnot absolutely isolated, nor almost paradoxical, so to speak.\nThe results of modern biology and psychology, in fact,\ntend already in a certain direction, or, rather, reveal to us\nalready a certain side of Reality's essence, acquaintance\nwith which is able to make psychical phenomena, in part\nat least, mtelligible. On the basis of modern biology and\npsychology these phenomena cease to be something that\nis absolutely opposite to our whole aspect of empirical\nreality.\nLet me, then, speak of psychical phenomena as being the\ncontinuation of certain biological and psychological facts,\nwhich are already well established and well known.\nI begin with the physical, or rather psychophysical side\nof Parapsychology ; and by these words I understand tele-\nkinesis, levitation, materialization as occurring in continuity\nwith a living person's body, excluding at the beginning\nmateriaUzations without continuity, so-called \" poltergeists,\"\napports and the like.\nSome of you will probably know that my conception of\nbiology is vitalistic. I, in fact, believe that I have been\nable to prove, jyer exchisionein, that the mechanistic, or\nrather summative, theory of life is unable to account for\nthe facts of embryology, heredity, and organic movement.\nAll this has been explained in full in my Oifford Lectures,\ndelivered before the University of Aberdeen in 1907-1908,\nand more briefly in my London lectures of 1913, which\nwere published in the little booklet. The Problem of\nIndividuality.\nThe organism is, no doubt, a material system, i.e. a\nsystem that consists of what we call matter, that has a\nweight of so many pounds, etc. But a material system\nis not necessarily a mechanical one. That is to say, all\nevents occurring in a material system wUl not necessarily\nbe explicable in terms of physics and chemistry, or, in\nshortj mechanics, and are, in fact, not explicable in this\n\f99] Presidential Address. 173\nway, whenever the material system in qviestion is of the\nso-called organic kind, as is shown by what I call my\nvitalistic \" proofs.\"\nThe forces of matter are at work in an organism ; there\nis no doubt about this. But something else is at work\nin it also, directing the material forces without changing\nthe amount of energy, to put it shortly. And to this\nunifying, non-material, mind-like something I have given\nthe Aristotelian name of entelechy, well aware of the fact\nthat the meaning I have given to this word is not exactly\nthe same as that of the great Hellenic thinker.\nWe may say that entelechj^ controls the movement of\nmatter. Now it is very important for what is to follow\nto observe that entelechial control upon inanimate matter\nalways has its beginning and its end. The first occurs in so-\ncalled assimilation, of which dissimilation is the counterpart.\nThe conception of a beginning and an ending of\nentelechial control being established in biology proper, we\nat once see that aU physical phenomena of Parapsychology,\nso far as they happen in continuity with a living person's\nbody, fall under this heading. Matter, not hitherto con-\ntrolled, begins to be controlled whenever a telekenesis,\nlevitation or materialization occurs, and ceases to be\ncontrolled with their disappearance. The only difference\nbetween ordinary vitalistic and parapsychological control\nrelates to the range or area of controlling ; this area being\nof far greater extent in the second case than in the first.\nBut in a certain sense embryology is already \" materiali-\nzation \" from the vitalist's point of view. Think of the\nlittle material body, called an egg, and think of the\nenormous and very complex material body, say, an\nelephant, that may come out of it : here you have a\npermanent stream of materializations before your eyes, all\nof them occurring in the way of assimilation, i.e. of a\nspreading of entelechial control.\nWe have already said that entelechy controls matter\nwithout changing the amou.nt of energy in the controlled\norganism. We may at least conceive vitalism in this way.\nThe action of entelechy, then, is merely an ordering one ;\nit \" creates \" nothing, neither energy nor matter.\n\f174 Dr. Hans Driesch [part\nBut does this not also hold in Parapsychology ? Matter\nis everywhere ; and we need only assume that in levita-\ntion, materialization, etc., as far as these phenomena take\nplace in bodily continuity with the medium, pre-existing\nmatter becomes ordered. There is no need for accepting\nwhat might be called \" creation \" in any way. Only the\narea of the ordering power is enlarged, together with the\nincrease of the area of control in general, as mentioned\nabove ; for to control means to order.\nAll those physical phenomena of Parapsychology are thus\na part of a sort of super-vitalism, but have nothing in\nthem that is absolutely alien to the phenomena of well-\nestablished science. Now the relationship between the\nabnormal and the normal, which we have studied so far,\nwas only concerned with the usual general frame of\nbecoming, so to speak : Control, the beginning and end\nof control, ordering, have been the only points of dis-\ncussion. But if we go more deeply into the matters in\nquestion, a still closer relationship among parapsycho-\nphysics and normality reveals itseK.\nIn embryology an innate idea, as it were, is transformed\ninto material existence. May it not be that acquired ideas\nare also transformed in such a way ? In a certain sense\nwe might say, perhaps, that this is already the case in re-\ngeneration and adaptation, as these phenomena occur on\nthe basis of a specific state of affection of entelechy and\ndo not arise simply out of entelechy as a whole. But we\nknow of still other phenomena, in which the conception of\nan \" acquired \" idea comes upon the scene in the clearest\nway.\nThere are the well-known physiological effects of sug-\ngestion and auto-suggestion : inflammation may be pro-\nvoked by the mere idea of it, and in a similar way all\nsorts of physiological processes may be influenced. For\nlogical and methodological reasons I should not like to\nsay that the idea qua idea, or even that my conscious\npossession of the idea qua conscious possession is the\nactive factor, for consciousness, in my opinion, is not of\na dynamic nature, but is a mere index of a specific status\nof the active unconscious, or, rather, \" super-conscious\n\"\n\f99] Presidential Address 175\nmind or of some specific so-called subconscious conditions\nin it. But in any case we may say that in the Coueistic\nphenomena just mentioned there exists an immediate\npsychophysical effect starting from specific mental conditions\nwhich are quite certainly not of the iianate, but the\nacquired kind.\nWe, now, have only to enlarge again the area of\nvalidity of this sort of psychophysic action to \" under-\nstand \" the parapsychological phenomena in question, that\nis to say, to recognise them as something that is already\nfamiliar to us in principle. For this is certainly one\nmeaning of the ambiguous word to %mderstand.\nWhat is new in materialization and the like is only the\ntruly \/orm-building character of the effect of acquired\nstates of the mind indicated by siiecific ideas, and further\nthe fact that the effect is carried out at a distance, though\nin continuity with the medium's body.\nIt is interestmg to notice in this coimexion that a\nGerman palaeontologist, Dacque, has in fact tried to apply\nparapsychology to phylogeny, in so far as he assumes that\nphylogenetic modifications owe their origin to subconscious\nideas on the part of the organism. What is generally\ncalled \" mind \" or \" soul \" thus becomes part of the general\nentelechy ; and entelechy acts by morphogenetic parapsy-\nchological auto-suggestion.\nHere we see the reverse of what we have tried to do\nourselves : We have put parapsychophysics into relation\nwith some well-known psychophysical phenomena in order\nto make the former familiar to us. Dacque, on the other\nhand, tries to explain the morphogenetic process as a\nwhole by parapsychophysics.\nBut the idea that parapsychophysics only requires an\nincrease in the area of known agents is common to both\nof us.\nLet us, then, sum up : Vitahsm, in particular, if com-\nbined with the theory of suggestion, prepares the road for\nsuper-vitalism, i.e. for an understanding of a certain class\nof the physical phenomena of Psychical Research ; we may\ncall vitalism a bridge that leads into parapsychology. To\na biological mechanist these phenomena would, in fact.\n\f176 Dr. Hans Driesch [part\nremain an absolute enigma. And vitalism is a well-\nestablished doctrine to-day.\nI even dare to say that if we were not in possession\nof the parapsychophysical facts, we should have to suggest\nthat on the Jmmdation of vitalism something of this sort\nmight exist.\nOur consideration of one aspect of the so-called physical\nphenomena of our sphere of research has been rather\noptimistic. I am sorry to say that a pessimistic chapter\nis to follow.\nWhat we are able to \" understand \" in one field, at\nleast in principle and by the assumption of an enlarged\narea of the working of known agents, embraces only such\nkinds of parapsychophysical phenomena as occur in con-\ntinuity ivith a living person's body.\nThe great question now is whether there are not physical\nphenomena of some other kind : discontinuous phenomena,\nto put it shortly.\nHaunted houses, poltergeists, apports belong here, and so\ndo all sorts of so-called ajjparitions which occur without\ncontinuity with a medium's body and are yet not the\nmere effect of telepathic hallucination, either individual or\ncollective.\nThe first question, of course, is whether all these things\nare really facts. Crawford, Schrenck, Geley, have not\nobserved anything of this sort. All their levitations and\nmaterializations did occur in continuity or at least possible\ncontinuity with a living body, and the same seems to be\ntrue with regard to those few cases of \" Spook \" which\nhave been investigated in a really scientific manner.\nBut the scientist must never say \" never.\" And there-\nfore, in the sphere of our purely theoretical discussion, we\nmay assume hypotlietically that most of the alleged\nphenomena mentioned above are facts.\nIf they are, our super-vitalism does not help us : we\nhave to enter the field of a super-vitalism of a higher\norder\u2014the bridge <2ud real bridge is broken.\nOf the spiritualistic hypothesis we shall speak later on.\nThis hypothesis would, of course, explain our phenomena,\n\f99] Presidential Address. 177\nbut not on the foundation of a super-biology in the\nproper sense. If we do not want to accept spirituahsm\nand yet accept the phenomena as facts, the only thing\nleft to say, so it seems to me, is that the mind may realize\na morphogenetic action at a distance. This would then\nbe a really new fact of an original and elemental char-\nacter. You might say that this means nothing but the\nintroduction of a hypothesis ad hoc or, rather, the intro-\njection of an effect into a cause, comparable to the\nvirtus dormitiva of opium. And I should not be able to\nobject to such a statement.\nThat we only need to enlarge the area of validity of a\ncausa vera in the case of such physical phenomena, which\noccur in continuity with a living person's body, whilst\n- this is not possible with regard to discontinuous psychic\nphenomena, seems to me to explain the fact that most\npeople are so much more inclined to accept the pheno-\nmena of continuity than they are to accept their counter-\npart.\nWe now come to a theoretical analysis of psychical\nphenomena ; and this is the field in which this Society\nhas made its greatest discoveries.\nA terminological introductioji and a classification are\nnecessary m the first place, as the words in iise have not\nalways had the same meaning with the various writers.\nBut terminology is a secondary matter and so is all\nclassification. For I fully agree with Professor Richet,\nthat all classification in our field can be only a pre-\nliminary one.\nAll psychical phenomena consist in the abnormal trans-\nmission of something, which in this way becomes part of\nthe knowledge of somebody, either in the conscious or in\nthe subconscious form of kiaowing.\nI mean by agent the person or object in which the\nmatter to be transmitted has its origin ; the 'percipient,\nthen, is one who knows about that matter at the end of\ntransmission, he is always a person. He may be either\nmentally active or mentally passive ; and the same is true\nabout the agent, if he is a person and not an object.\n\f178 Dr. Hans Driesch [PAET\nBy object I mean a state or condition of the universe\nqua mere state or condition, i.e. without particular re-\nference to mental conditions embraced in it.\nBy telepathy I understand the fact that a passive per-\ncipient acquires an immediate knowledge of another\nperson's mental conditions ; this other person, that is to\nsay the agent, may be conscious of what he gives or\nsubconscious ;\nin both cases he is mentally active.\nIn mind reading the agent, in the sense defined above,\nthat is the person in whom the matter in question has\nits origin, is passive, the matter in question being a con-\nscious or subconscious idea. The percipient is active, he\nwants to know, either consciously or subconsciously.\nIn experimental cases telepathy and mind reading may\nbe combined.\nIn clairvoyance the agent is an object, the percipient is\nconsciously active or not ; in the latter case we may\nspeak of spontaneous clairvoyance.\nIt may be that the three phenomena, defined so far\nterminologically, are the same thing in the last resort.\nBut in any case we do not know that in the beginning ;\nit even seems rather doubtful to me.\nProphecy is clairvoyance into the future, retrospection\ninto the past, cryptaesthesia into objects outside the limit\nof the power of the sense organs, e.g. into microscopical\nconditions.\nThere remains what has very badly been called psycho-\nmetry, i.e. the fact that in connexion with the perception\nof some object the percipient has knowledge about the\nhistory of that object and in particular about persons or\nevents concerned with it.\nWe proceed from mere classification and terminology to\ntheory, and begin by saying that, in any case, we shall\nnot jump into spiritualism at once. We leave this ques-\ntion to the end of all, and shall first try to find other\nways of explanation ;\n\" explanation \" meaning, as before,\nthe insertion into the general logical scheme of known\nclasses of facts, with permission to enlarge their area of\nvalidity.\n\f99] Presidential Address. 179\nAnd at first we shall reject two sorts of explanation\nwhich have been of a certain importance in literature.\nIt is meaningless to speak of a \" psychic energy \" pass-\ning over from the agent to the percipient or, in psycho-\nmetry, acting by an intermediate object. Kotik has\nadvocated such a view. But the concept of energy is of\nas little use here as it is in normal psychology or vitalistic\nbiology. For the points in question are meaning, order,\nordering and the like, and energy has only to do with\nquantity, being a measurement of causality as the pound\nis a measurement of matter.\nThe second parapsychological theory in question is the\none which tries to explain telepathy and mind reading by\nphysical radiation, i.e. by electromagnetic waves originating\nin the brain of the agent and affecting the brain of the\npercipient. This, of course, is a purely physical theory,\nand it is only possible on the foundation of so-called\npsycho-mechanical parallelism, so much in vogue in a\nformer period of psychology. Baerwald, who has recently\ngiven up the very sceptical position advocated before and\nagrees that telepathy and mind reading\u2014though only they\n\u2014are facts, has driven the radiation theory to its very\nextremes. Now I myself believe I have shown that\npsycho-mechanical parallelism is an impossibility. But that\nis not relevant here, and I therefore shall oixly try to\nprove that, even if the parallelism were a legitimate hypo-\nthesis, telepathy and mind reading could by no means\nbe explained on its foundation. As Tischner has already\ngiven us a very good analysis of the matter in question,\nI shall only mention one specific topic ; but this, in my\nopinion, is decisive. On the parallehstic theory there\nwould be a specific material state in the brain of the\nagent, corresponding to what he consciously possesses at\nthis moment ; vibrations would go out from this brain\nstate and would induce the same material state in the\nbrain of the percipient. The percijDient therefore ought to\nbe in the same state of consciousness as the agent\u2014but\nhe most certainly is not. And it is for this very reason\nthat the radiation theory breaks down. A man in great\ndanger thinks of his wife, and the wife \" sees,\" let us\n\f180 Dr. Hans Driesch [part\nassume, the phantom of her husband. But neither does\nthe wife think of herself nor the man in danger see his\nown phantom ; and this \" ought \" to happen on the\nparallehstic theory !\nBut it is easier to criticize than to form an explanation.\nWhat, then, shall we say in a positive way about the\nexplanation of psychical psychic phenomena ? How may we\nbe able to connect these phenomena with the well-known\nscientific facts, as we have done m the field of parapsy-\nchophysics ? Shall we also be able to construct a \"bridge\"\nthat leads into the psychical part of parapsychology as\nwe were able to do with regard to psychophysics ?\nI believe that the ultimate foundations of such a bridge\nare already given in the breakdown of association psycho-\nlogy. Modern normal psychology already, working with\nthe concepts of \" Gestalt \" and with directing psychical\nfactors comes in here ; and so does the modern theory of\ncomplexes, of sub- and co-consciousness. The concept of\na mere summation, in analogy to mechanics, is given up\nhere, just as mechanics is given up in biology.\nBut for an explanation we need more than this.\nLet me now say, m the first place, that I agree that\nthere is a certain relationship between telepathy and\nmind reading, and that, on the other hand, clairvoyance\ninto the past, the present, the future, and into micro-\nscopical dimensions seem to have a certain relationship\ninter se. But the second group of facts, in my opinion,\nis not reducible to the first, or, in other terms, clair-\nvoyance in its various forms\u2014granting that these are\n\" facts \"\u2014is not reducible to telepathy and the like. We\ntherefore want hoo different kinds of explanation, one for\neach group. This, at least, seems to be a necessity in\nthe present state of psychical research, though we do not\nintend to deny a priori that in a not very near future all\npsychic phenomena may prove to be one at the bottom.\nOf course we do not speak here of muscular so-called\ntelepathy and mind reading of the Cumberland type.\nNeither do we speak of all those cases in which any kind\nof whispering of the Lehman type has certainly occurred,\ncombined with some sort of hyperaesthesia.\n\f99] Presidential Address 181\nBut might not hyperaesthesia, in the case of Professor\nGilbert Murray for example, have played its role even if\nany sort of real whispering was excluded 1 This is what\nsome people have assumed. And they have assnmed it\nwith regard to telepathy and mind reading as well as\nwith regard to clairvoyance\u2014in the case of Herr Kahn for\ninstance\u2014in this way explaining these tv\/o groups of\nphenomena on the same foundation. But I believe that\nwhen we are faced with the phenomenon of reading a\nfolded letter in a thick envelope the assumption of hyper-\naesthesia is quite impossible, and that also in the Murray\ncase there are a good many particulars which exclude it\ndefinitely.\nLet me, then, follow my own way of explaining ;\nalways,\nof course, on the assumption that all the facts enumerated\nabove are \" facts,\" not telepathy and mind reading only\n\u2014\nas to which no one doubts to-day.\nIt is a well-founded metaphysical hypothesis that all\nEgos and minds and entelechies are ultimately one ; that\nthe Spiritual is part of metaphysical Reality, though this\nOne may under certain circumstances appear as the many.\nLet me only mention some of the results of my own\nformer embryological work : One egg may give two or\nfour organisms a^id souls, if only you separate the\nblastomeres ; and two eggs may give one organism and\none soul. Can souls divide and unite ? Would it not be\nmore adequate to say that Oneness and Manyness in these\ncases depend on material conditions and have both their\nlast root in The One ? And not on embryology alone\nmay be founded the hypothesis of Spiritual Oneness.\nMoral feeling and a good many other topics of our inner\nlife would hardly be understandable without the assump-\ntion that everything which is spiritual and whole in the\nworld has The One as its last foundation.\nIt now seems to me that the assumption of The One\ngives us the means to understand at least a little about\ntelepathy and its relative, mind reading.\nBy the aid of The One it may occur under certain\ncircumstances, unknown at present in detail, that one\n\f182 Dr. Hans Driesch [PAET\nof the many reveals to some other one his conscious\ncontents.\nWe are familiar with the phenomena of personal dis-\nsociation, so well studied by Janet, Binet, and Morton\nand Walter Prince. Here we see two or more Egos re-\nlated to one Soul ; and they may know about their\nconscious contents in a miitual way, though in form the\nother Ego may appear to be a stranger. This may also\nbe taken as an analogy to mind reading and telepathy.\nIt seems to me that Wilham James has conceived our\nphenomena m a similar way.\nIt is much more difficult to understand clairvoyance\nproper, to say nothing about prophecy at present.\nHere we might say that metaphysically knowing is a\nprimordial relation in the realm of Reality and that all\nparticular acquisition of specific knowledge occurs in the\nframes of knoiving in general. And there exists even more\nthan mere knowing in an original way : all our knowledge\nof the so-called a iniori type is already specific knowledge.\nWe may say that the subject-parts of Reality are in pos-\nsession of the most general type of order of Reality as a\nwhole. And all animals endowed with what we call\ninstinct seem to possess still more of specific Imowledge\nin an innate original way.\nMight clairvoyance not be a mere enlargement of this\ninnate Imowledge about particulars ?\nLeibniz has called his monad a miroir de Vunivers. It\nknows, according to him, everything from itself, though\nmost of it in the form of a petite perception, i.e. under\nthe limit of consciousness. All so-called psychophysical\ninteraction is nothing but illusion. The clairvoyant then\nmight be such a miroir de Vunivers in part endowed with\nan abnormally low limit.\nBut I do not overlook one great difficulty of the\nmiroM'-hypothesis. Why, you may ask, do we have our\nsense organs, why must we learn and undergo experience,\nif at the bottom we are all clairvoyants ?\nLet me answer that in the deepest state of hj^nosis\nthe Ego seems to remember everything that has happened\n\f99] Presidential Address. 183\nto it in detail, whilst the normal Ego has \" forgotten \" so\nvery many things. Here we might also ask : Why does\nforgetting exist actu, if total remembering does exist\npotentia 1 For we know that the latter does exist potentia.\nThe conscious state seems to be a handicap to the faculties\nof the hypnotic state in the case of remembering.\nMight not our normal conscious state be also a handi-\ncap to our primordial miroir faculties, i.e. our clair-\nvoyant faculties 1 But why, then, does the normal con-\nscious state with so many handicaps exist at all ? Shall\nwe follow Bergson's opinion, that the limited power of the\nconscious Ego with regard to its memory and its miroir\nfaculty is a kind of adaptation, that a perfect memory\nand an absolute clairvoyance would make us unfit for\nactual life, overwhelming us with too many data ?\nI must confess that I have no answer to this question\nand that ur any case the contrast between the all-remem-\nbering hypnotic state and the very poor memory of the\nconscious Ego is one of the greatest problems to me. So\nis clairvoyance in a still higher degree.\nBut facts always come first, and remain facts even if\nwe are unable to understand them.\nProphecy and so-called psychometry are still greater\nenigmas to us than clairvoyance proper.\nIn some cases prophecy may be reducible to a \" read-\ning \" of the intentions of a human person on the part of\nanother, but certainly not in all ; and whenever prophecy\nis related to mere objective conditions this sort of explana-\ntion fails, of course, completely. It is an old assumption\nthat the world of genesis, to use Plato's term, has as its\nlast foundation or as its boundary something timeless : in\nthis sense prophecy might be the \" reading \" in the mind\nof a superentelechy. But it is useless to go here deeper\ninto details.\nPsychometry, finally, can certaiialy not be explained by\nthe assumption of some sort of energy investing, as it\nwere, the object in question ; this we know already on\ngeneral grounds. But what shall we put in its place ?\nIf the person, to whom the object in question belongs, is\npresent, we may assume that we have a case of mind\n\f184 Dr. Hans DriescJi [part\nreading before us : the person present perceives the object,\nand all sorts of ideas related to it come into his mind,\nin the conscious or the unconscious form, and are then\n\" read \" by the medium. But this explanation is not\ngood for all cases, and I confess that I have no explana-\ntion to offer for the rest.\nAt the end of all we come to spiritualism, which is, no\ndoubt, a legitimate hypothesis, i.e. a hypothesis that is\nlogically possible, for it does not contain a contradiction.\nWilliam James, as is well known, has confessed that the\nPiper phenomena might be explained as resting on tele-\npathy and mind reading, but that spiritualism would\nexplain them in a less artificial and more natural way, so\nto speak. He adds that for general methodological reasons,\nfollowing the postulate that entia non sunt creanda praeter\nnecessitate?)!, he prefers to keep to telepathy, and this is\ncertainly a sound principle of theoretical research.\nBut might it not be, in the face of recent experimental\nresults, that the necessity for creating new entia, namely\nthe spirits, would one day become absolutely urgent ?\nThree classes of phenomena have been mentioned in\nfavour of spiritualism, called by British authors Cross-\ncorrespondences, Literary Puzzles, and Personal Details. Of\nthese Personal Details, including Literary Puzzles to some\nextent, seem to me to be the most important. We, of\ncoiirse, might bring in the operation of telepathy and mind\nreading here also. But then we have to assume, first,\nthat mind reading is selective, and secondly that it is\nguided by a certain totality not known to the medium,\ni.e. by the idea on the part of the medium of the personal\ncharacter of a dead person. You may assume here that\nthis idea also comes from one of the sitters ; that it is\ntelepathically implanted into the medium's subconscious\nmind, and that the medium then behaves according to it,\njust as a hypnotized person in consequence of a suggestion\nmay \" play \" at being a child or a dog or Napoleon.\nBut there is no doubt that the whole explanation becomes\nvery artificial and complicated in this way, especially as\nregards the selection of particulars. And it is a further\n\f99] Presidential Address. 185\nadvantage of spiritualism, of course, that it would also be\nable to explain such kinds of physical phenomena as occur\nwithout continuity with a living person's body, as discussed\nbefore.\nBut I do not regard the argument in favour of spirit-\nualism as decisive.\nLet me shortly note that spiritualism does not necessarilv\ninclude personal immortality in the common meaning of\nthe word. Oesterreich has remarked that it might be\npossible that, under the conditions of mediumistic ex-\nperiment, the personality of the dead does nothing but\nemerge from some super-person, into which it had been\nabsorbed, and that, after the experiment, it will surrender\nitself again qua person. Then there would be immortality,\nwhich in its most general meaning is almost certain, but\nnot personal immortahty in the strict sense, and even the\npersonal appearance of a dead person during the time of\nexperiment would not prove the latter.\nMackenzie, on the other hand, the Italian parapsycho-\nlogist, advocates the possibility that the so-called spirits,\nspeaking or writing by the aid of the medium, though\nthey are \" persons,\" are yet persons of a quite artificial\nand transient character, formed only under the conditions\nof the experiment for a short time, just as the various\nEgos in ordinary dissociation are formed. The spuit, in\nthis case, would then not be really identical with a dead\nperson, though he might resemble that person. This re-\nminds me of the concept of Egoness as established in\northodox early Buddhism (Hinayana Buddhism).\nWhat then shall we say about the spiritualistic hypo-\nthesis in the proper sense, including personal immortality ?\nI think the only possible answer is, firstly, that we do not\nknow at present, secondly that we may know some day\nin a scientific way, and finally that all of us xvill per-\nsonally know in the future\u2014if there is anything left to\n\" know \" at all.\nLet us sum up. We have tried to show that there are\nbridges, as it were, connecting the world of mere matter\nwith Psychical Research. And we can find out some such\n\f186 Presidential Address. [part\nbridges. Vitalistic biology is a bridge leading into phy-\nsical parapsychological phenomena as far as they occur in\nconnection with a living person's body. Modern psycho-\nlogy, the metaphysics of the One and the many and the\nmetaphysics of knowing, make telepathy, mind reading and\nclairvoyance proper understandable forces to a certain\ndegree.\nWe have to leave unexplained all discontinuous physical\nphenomena, prophecy, and most cases of psychometry\u2014to\nsay nothing of apport and dematerialization.\nIn this field new entia must, so it seems, be introduced ;\nand among these new entia may be spirits proper.\nThus, then, what we are able to offer is by no means\ndefinitive.\nPsychical Research is still in the state of a child, a\nhealthy, growing child. Let us hope that it may soon\nbecome a man full of strength and power.\nThen Psychical Research will form the centre of all\nscience and philosophy, the very foundation of what we\ncall in German \" Weltanschauung.\"\nAt the present day the main thing we need is to get\nPsychical Pvesearch under the strict control of experiment.\nWe are in the Galvani period\u2014to speak by analogy; we\nwant to enter into the Faraday period. I am sure we\nshall enter it one day. And I am also sure that, when\nwe shall have entered it, a good many of those, who are\nnot our friends at present, will say :\n\" We have always\nsaid so.\"\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 187\nA REPORT ON SOME RECENT SITTINGS WITH\nMRS. LEONARD.i\nBy Mrs. W. H. Salter.\nIntroduction.\nThe incidents discussed in the following paper are taken\nmainly from sittings held with Mrs. Osborne Leonard by\none of the Members of this Society, the Rev. W. S. Irving.\nIn Part II., however, I have grouped together certain\nrecords sent to me from time to time by other sitters.\nIn only a few cases is any other medium than Mrs.\nLeonard concerned. In the Ikon case (see below, p. 268)\nthe verification of a statement made at a sitting with\nMrs. Leonard occurred at the house of Mr. Vout Peters.\nMr. Peters wUl be known to many of our Members, and\nan account of some evidence obtained through his medium-\nship will be found in Sir Oliver Lodge's Raymond, pp.\n100 ff. In two instances (see below, p. 264 and p. 318)\nextracts are given from sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott\n(Miss Violet Ortner), and on p. 297 is an extract from a\nsitting Mr. Irving had with Mr. Vout Peters. In two other\ninstances (p. 222 and p. 306) exti'acts are quoted from\nsittings with Mrs. Annie Brittain. Evidence obtained\nthrough her mediumship has been printed in the S.P.R.\nJournal from time to time. In particular I may refer\nreaders to the incident of \" Charley L.\" printed in Vol.\nXX. of the Journal, p. 122.\nMr. Irving had his first sitting with ]VIrs. Leonard on\nTuesday, January 25, 1921, and since then he has had\n1 Part of this paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society\non February 5, 1925.\nIT\n\f188 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nsittings with her two or three times a year. Occasionally he\nhas acted as his own recorder, but as a rule he has a\nnote-taker with him. His sittings are all carefully re-\ncorded ; he may indeed claim to be a model sitter in\nrespect of the trouble he takes to verify and check every\nstatement made, so far as he possibly can, and I should\nlike to take this opportunity of thanking him for j)utting\nhis evidence at our disposal.\nMr. Irving originally went to Mrs. Leonard as an\nanonymous sitter. After his tenth sitting, on July 25,\n1922, he writes :\nMrs. Leonard told me that she believed she had learnt my\nname during the holiday from which she had just returned.\nShe had read a letter in the S.P.R. Journal, signed \" W.\nS. Irving.\" She does not as a rule read S.P.R. works,\nbut a friend had asked her to read an article on psychic\nphotography therein, and she had, without thinking, read\nfurther. She thought the letter might be mine.\nThis statement is worth quoting, if only as one more\ninstance of how scrupulous Mrs. Leonard is to mform her\nsitters of any knowledge concerning them which has come\nto her by normal means. Most of the sittings I am dis-\ncussing here occurred after Mr. Irving's name was known\nto Mrs. Leonard, but in view of the particular type of\nevidence to be considered this fact is of little importance.\nThe purporting communicator at Mr. Irving's sittings is\nhis wife, who died in 1918 after a short illness.\nThe evidence considered in this report is of several\ndifferent types, hut most of it has one common charac-\nteristic, that in part at least the knowledge shown by the\nmedium could not have been derived directly from the\nsitter's mmd. The elimination of that one hypothesis\nleaves us still with a sTifficiently complex problem, but it\ndoes narrow the field a little ; and in view of the fact\nthat where the knowledge shown is possessed by the sitter,\ntelepathy from the sitter may be held the most probable\nexplanation, it seems worth while to give some special\nconsideration to evidence which does not fall within this\ncategory.\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 189\nThere are three other possible sources of supernormal\nknowledge for which the cases here described afford some\nevidence : (o) telepathy from living persons at a distance,\ni.e. not the sitter ; (&) clau-voyance ;\n(c) communication\nfrom the dead. In some cases any one of these hypotheses\nis admissible, and it does not seem possible in the present\nstate of our knowledge to form any opinion as to which\nof them is responsible for the phenomena described. Some-\ntimes the evidence seems rather to point to clairvoyance,\nbut whether the clairvoyance is exercised by the medium,\nor, as alleged at the sittings, by the ostensible communi-\ncator, we cannot say. The cases which aiford the strongest\nevidence of communication with the dead are those which\neither exhibit clearly some characteristic of a communi-\ncator's personality or appear to be directly drawn from\nthe communicator's memory of past events (see, for\nexample, the \" Lace Collar \" incident, p. 286).\nIn regard to this question of evidence of surviving\npersonality. Miss Newton has sent me the following\nexpression of opinion :\nMr. Irving has read to me nearly all, if not all, his notes\non his sittings with Mrs. Leonard, and I have also read\na large part of them. I have been impressed by the\ncompleteness and consistency of the personality of the\npurporting communicator, which shows certain qualities\nthat seem to me from my experience of communications\nreceived through Mrs. Leonard distinctive of this com-\nmunicator, and such as do not occur with other sitters.\n1. Newton.\nWith this short introduction I will now give in Part I.\nof my paper a series of incidents taken from Mr. Irving'\ns\nsittings.\n\f190 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nPART I.\nEVIDENCE OBTAINED BY THE REV. W. 8. IRVING.\nCHAPTER I.\nCases in which the Communicator Purports to give\nInformation Concerning Recent or Contemporary\nEvents, Unknown the Sitter.\nIt happens sometimes at sittings with Mrs. Leonard that\nFeda\u2014or, it may be, the communicator\u2014asserts that she\nhas visited the S.P.R. rooms at Tavistock Square or some\nother place associated m some way with the Society, and\nshe reports various more or less trivial incidents which she\nj\nsays she has observed. One of the earliest of these\n|\nstatements occurred in September, 1922, but there would\nseem on this occasion to have been some confusion between\nthe S.P.R.\u2014to which Feda habitually refers as \" the\n'searchers\" or \"the psychical 'searchers\"\u2014and the London\nSpiritualist Alliance. There is some reason to suppose\nthat the same confusion occurred on a previous occasion.\n\u00a71.\nExtract from Sitting ivith Mrs. Leonard, September 22, 1922.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Colonel C. E. Baddeley,\nC.B., C.M.G.\nFeda. This is to do with Psychical 'Searchers. They're going\nto have a new group picture to hang up. She\nsensed that very strongly. It's not generally known\nyet, in fact she's not sure they've got it, but they're,\ngoing to hang it up. Somebody else is leaving there.\nDon't know if it's generally known, but she sensed\nit. She does not mean Mrs. Nelly []\\Irs. Salter], but\nsomebody who's been there a long time. And they\ncan't open tlie cupboard. Did they say anything\nto you about not being able to open a cupboard ?\nW. S. I. No.\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 191\nF. Dora [the communicator, Mrs. Irving] sensed distinctly\nthey'd not been able to ojien a cupboard and they\nwould have some difficulty with it. She supposed\nsomebody had lost the key or something. Oh !\nI know they caU them types [tyi^ewriters]. Did you\nknow they wanted to change one ? She sensed they\ndid. . . . That's all about the \" researcher \" people.\nMx. Irving enquired of the S.P.R. Secretary, Miss Newton,\nwhether any of the statements made at this sitting could\nbe verified ; to which Miss Newton rejilied that none of\nthem seemed to apply to anything which had lately hap-\npened in the Society's rooms. Mr. Irving then sent the\nsame enquiries to Mr. G. E. Wright, at that time Secretary\nof the L.S.A., and received the following reply :\nOct. 30, 1922.\nThe four items you mention certainly seem to connect\nup with things that have happened here, though not all\nof them are very near to date.\n1. \"They were going to have a new group picture to\nhang up.\" No new picture has been obtained and hung\nup, but at the time you mention we were re-hanging a lot\nof pictures, which was a subject of some difference between\nmy colleague, Miss Phillimore, and myself. The picture of\na single figure which I had put over the mantelpiece was\neventually removed, and a picture containing a number of\nfigures siibstituted for it. The date was just about\nSeptember 22.\n2. \" Some one was leaving who had been there a long\ntime.\"\nMr. South, who had been at the Alliance over forty\nyears, gave up his post at the beginning of Jul}^\n3. \"They can't o-pen a cupboard.\"\nMiss Phillimore, when she went on her holiday on\nAugust 1, left two cupboards locked and did not leave the\nkeys, which cost me some little worry.\n4. \"They are thinking of changing a typewriter.\"\nFor some time we have been thinking of changing a\ntypewriter, as Mrs. Musgrave was using her own. The\nRoyal typewriter was actually ordered on September 13,\n\f192 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nand delivered on September 16. This latter item appears\nto me exti aordinarily accurate, but all four are good apart\nfrom the question of time, and, as we all know, time\nsequence is always very weak in trance communi-\ncations. . . .\nG. E. Weight.\nIn regard to the items numbered (1) and (3) in Mr.\nWi\"ight\"s letter Miss Phillimore adds a confirmatory state-\nment, and Mr. Wright sent for our inspection the invoice\nfor the new typewriter which is dated September 19, 1922.\nWith regard to the second item, Mr. South's resignation,\nas Manager of the L.S.A. Book Department, was referred\nto in the issue of Light for June 24, 1922. It is not\nunlikely therefore that Mrs. Leonard had some normal\nknowledge of this ; but in that case it is curious that\nthere should have been the apparent confusion between\nthe L.S.A. and the S.P.R.\nThis conftision is of course a weak point in the evidence,\nbut the coincidence between all four of the points men-\ntioned at the sitting and recent events at the L.S.A.\nseems beyond what chance would be likely to give. None\nof them, it is to be observed, applied to the S.P.R.\n\u00a72.\nI turn now to another incident of the same kind which\nwas subsequently linked uj) with one of Mr. Irving's\npicture tests.\n^\nAt two sittings of Mr. Irving's on April 17 and 19, 1923,\na series of statements were made about incidents at the\nS.P.R. rooms. Out of these I select the following two :\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, April 19, 1923.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr. E. J. DingwaU.\nFeda. Do birds come outside the window a lot ? At what\nFeda calls \" the 'Searchers' \" place. She got a feel-\ning some one there noticing birds rather often. \" In\na way I psycognitised that condition.\" Yes, she\nthinks that's right. . . .\n* See below, p. 283.\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 193\nFruit ! Has some one been taldng fruit in there ?\nYou might just ask. I feel as if some one were\nconcealing fruit there. Isn't it a noosance ! She\nsays, \" I couldn't see it, but I felt it, fruit, fruit.\"\nShe felt as if some one pushed it away somewhere.\nShe says, \" You can ask nicely.\"\nNote by Miss Newton.\nI like the birds coming up to the window in our new\nhouse. I noticed them when I went the first time to see\nthe house. They were busily hopping up and down the\nbranches of a tree that comes close to the window in the\nsmall room we use as a dressing-room. I had a distinct\nfeeling of gladness when I saw them. When I think of\nthe country I think of busy twittering birds. Our offices\nat Hanover Square were so high that we saw no birds\nexcept now and then a single sparrow on the stone coping.\nI used to wish that one could combine work with a country\noutlook. The birds at the window of Tavistock Square\nwere unexpected and delightful. I have the same feeling\nof gladness when I enter the room every morning to take\noff my hat.\nThe fruit incident is as follows :\nReturning from Provence on April 10, 1923, I continued\nfor a little Avhile a habit I had formed there of eating\nnext to no breakfast and a good deal of fruit an hour or\nso later. On my way to the S.P.R. every morning for\nabout a week or ten days I bought three or four oranges,\nwhich T brought in with me and ate with a feeling of\ngene. Once I was interrupted by Miss Horsell [the Assistant\nSecretary], and on my remarking that it was disgraceful of\nme to be eating oranges in office hours, especially as some\none might call and not like the smell of oranges, she said\nthat some one was actually at the door at that moment\n;\nand I hastily thrust the peeled oranges out of sight under\nthe papers on my desk.\nMiss Newton's original notes on this sitting were not\ndated, but were written shortly after she read Mr. Irving's\nrecord, within a week or so of the sitting. The notes\nwere amplified on one or two points and some fiu^ther\n\f194 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\ncorroborative statements by Miss Horsell added on July\n25, 26, 1924.\nThe' other statements made on this occasion were correct,\nbut are not sufficiently distmctive to be worth reporting\nin detail.\n\u00a73.\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 29, 1924.\nSitter : W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr. R. R. Farmer.\nFeda. Going to the Psychical 'Searchers' place ? She's taken\na jump, Mr. Bill, right to the Psychical 'Searchers'\nhome. . . .\nSome one unexpectedly has had some flowers there too.\nShe didn't see them, but she could feel them. She\nsays, \" I visualise them as being red. You might\nenquire about them,\" she says. [Note 1.]\nWait ! A what ? Wrapped up to be sent away ? She\nfelt something had just been wrapped up and sent\naway. Not for good. To have something done to\nit and then come back again. A parcel. That's\nright. [Note 2.]\nAnd there was some one new joining the 'Searchers.\nDora says she doesn't think any one outside would\nknow this. While she was there she had a very\nstrong feeling that a new person\u2014some one fresh\n\u2014\nwas going to be there, working there, joining the\n'Searchers, the Re-searchers, the Psychical Re-\nsearchers. Some one new, some one quite new.\nA quite recent development, she felt. [Note 3.]\n\" Who took the stamps V He can't ask that !\n\" Who\ntook the stamps ? Why weren't they there ?\n\"\n[Here Feda hurriedly remonstrated that they might\nthink stealing was meant.] She says, \" Just keep\nit like that.\" [Note 4.]\nNote by Miss Newton.\n1. On January 29 Mr. Dingwall brought me a plant, a\nred azalea in full bloom. The gift was entirely unexiJected.\nMr. Dingwall has never given me a plant before, nor\nflowers in winter. He did on one or two occasions during\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 195\nthe summer bring flowers from his own garden, but not\nred ones.\n2. Sir William Barrett sent us some Parts of the Proceed-\nings and asked us to get them bound for him. The covers\nfor these Parts were received from the makers and de-\nspatched on January 29 to various of our members in\naccordance with the orders that we had received. Sir\nWilliam Barrett's Parts were made up in a parcel and\ntaken to the bmders with instructions that the bound\nVolume was to be returned to us. We do not know the\nactual day on which this was done ; the cover is not\nincluded in the list of those sent out on January 29. The\norder for binding was completed on February 13, and the\nbinders state that they probably received the parcel at\nleast a week earlier.\n3. I do not know what this means, unless it refers to the\nappointment of Dr. Woolley as Hon. Research Officer,\nwhich had been discussed for some weeks before the\nappointment was made. So far as I am aware no one\n\" outside would know.\"\n4. \/ took the stamps. It was during the week commencing\nJanuary 21, when the railway strike was on and IVIiss\nHorseli arrived late every morning and left earlier than\nusual in the afternoon. She was not here at all on\nSaturday morning, the 26th, and it was then I took\nthe stamp book from her drawer, which she keeps locked.\nOn the 28th she looked for the book, to make it up as\nusual on Monday morning. She could not find it. I\nthought that I had returned it to the drawer and I could\nnot find it. Some time during the day I came across it\namong a pile of letters and papers on my desk. I do\nnot remember any other occasion on which the stamp book\nwas missing. I seldom borrow it, as Mss HorseU enters\nthe postage and keeps the book.\nI. Newton.\n(corroborated by) E. M. Hoesell.\nWith regard to the red azalea, another point is worth\nnoting. Both Miss Newton and IMr. Dingwall agree that\nthe plant was brought to the rooms on January 29, the\n\f196 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nday of the sitting. Miss Newton thinks Mr. Dingwall\nbrought it in about 12 noon, whereas Mr. Dingwall himself\nis under the impression he brought it when he came in\nafter lunch about 2-2.30 p.m. Mr. Irving's sitting began\nat 2.40 p.m. on that day, so that even if Miss Newton's\nrecollection is correct, the plant had only been at the\nrooms a few hours. The search for the stamp book took\nplace on the 28th, the day before the sitting.\nIn the case of the other incidents I have related, the\nevents to which reference was apparently made had oc-\ncurred some days before the sitting. I mention these\nfacts as they have some relevance to the question of the\nmodus operandi.\n\u00a74.\nExtracts from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nTuesday, September 23, 1924.\nSitter : Rev. W. S.

To use in the Psychical\n'Searchers' rooms.\"\nNote by Mr. Dingwall.\nOn July 11, 1924, I bought a tubular electric lamp to\nfit the note-taker's desk in the laboratory. There had been\na good deal of discussion as to the best source of light\nand several lamps had been inspected and tried before\ndeciding upon the one which was eventually bought.\nE. J. Dingwall.\nJidy 20, 1925.\nFeda. Oh, and she also felt that room has to be made for\nsomething, a kind of clearing out, a making room,\nfor something new. They'll be having\u2014that's too\nquick !\n\u2014quite a turn-out, which will be rather in-\nconvenient and awkward, but, she says, \" I'm afraid\nis unavoidable.\" She says she thinks something is\nknown about this, but she's not sure it actually has\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 197\nbeen done. It more the idea she got, not that she\nsaw anything actually taking place. . . . [Note 1.]\nWho said, \" Might have better arrangement for hot\nwater \" ? Will you ask if they talking about a\nbetter arrangement for hot water ?\nW. S. I. They'd better have an arrangement ?\nF. No ! You haven't got it right. A better arrangement,\nas if there could be an improved arrangement for\nhot water, she says. . . . [Note 2.]\nDirty windows ! The windows wanted cleaning ! Isn't\nit a noosance ! One particularly, more than the\nothers. Must have been overlooked, she says. Dora\nwouldn't have dii'ty windows !\nW. S. I. No.\nF. She was very particular that way. [Note 3.]\nThe word \" cupid \" coming to her strongly. \" Now,\nshe says, I think they must have that word written\nvery largely on something that has been discussed,\nor written there, lately.\" She says, \" I know I was\ngetting- somebody else's mental picture of it, so,\n\u2014\nshe says,\u2014rather interested to find out if I'm right\nabout that.\" \" 'Tisn't, she says, what you'd expect\nto find there.\" . . . [Note 4.]\nNotes by Miss Newton.\n1. Room had to be made for the steel cupboards which\nare now in the Office. It was difficult to find room for\nthem and for the furniture that would have to be dis-\nplaced, and the question occupied our minds for some little\ntime before the cupboards were dehvered. The bill for\nthem is dated July 8, 1924.\nThere was not only a clearing out to make room, but\nalso a clearing out of other places, where the documents\nwhich were to be stored in the steel cupboards had hitherto\nbeen kept. It was certainly \" rather inconvenient and\nawkward,\" for we had no spare time to devote to it.\n2. We considered and discussed the question of better\narrangements for hot water in connection with our tenant's\nlease of the upper floors in June and July, 1923, more\nthan a year before the sitting. Again we discussed it in\n\f198 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nconnection with the substitution of the Eagle Range for\nthe obsolete range in the kitchen, a month or two after\nthe sitting.\n3. The windows were dirty, when we returned on Sep-\ntember 10 after the vacation. They had not been cleaned\nsince July. One window was specially dirty ; this was the\nupper landing window, which had never been cleaned dur-\ning the Society's tenanc)^ on account of the necessity of\nusing a special ladder to reach it. One day, soon after\nSeptember 10, I noticed how very dii'ty it was, and spoke\nto Miss Horsell about it, and she told me the window-\ncleaner was going to bring a special ladder. She had\nmentioned this at the end of July to our housekeeper,\nwho was also concerned about the dirty window. All the\nwindows, including this one, were cleaned in September.\n4. Mrs. Ham, the housekeeper at 31 Tavistock Square,\nshowed me to-day (September 29, 1924) a white china cupid\nwhich had been given her by our tenant's housekeeper,\nwhen leaving, some time during the first half of August.\nNeither Miss Horsell, Mr. Dingwall, nor I laiew anything\nabout this until Mrs. Ham told me, and showed me the\nCupid, when I enquired on September 29 whether there\nwas such a thing m the house. _\nI. Newton.\nIt will be noticed that in regard to some of these\nincidents, those of the \" new lamp,\" the \" clearing out,\"\nand the arrangement for hot water, there is no close\ncoincidence with the date of the sitting, and the evidential\nvalue of the iiacident is thereby diminished.\n\u00a7 5. Impressions Concerning Miss Newton's Flat.\n[a] Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard on\nSeptember 25, 1924.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. DingwaU.\n(At his previous sitting, on September 23, 1924, Mr.\nIrving had conveyed to Feda a request from Miss\nNewton that Feda should go to her flat and give\ntests concerning things there on the first suitable\noccasion. Feda agreed to do so.)\n\f99j Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 199\nFeda. ]\\'Ir. Bill, I just asked Dora if she'd mind waiting a\nminute M'hUe I tell you something about Mrs. Isabel\n[Miss Newton]. Mr. BiU, I've been to ]\\Irs. Isabel's,\nand will you tell her that I saw a picture of a girl\nthat looks awful like Feda\u2014a girl that you would\ncall dark. Feda isn't dark ! With a very pretty face\n\u2014just like Feda's. Wait a minute. And the face is\nrather round, not a thin long face that some people\nthink all people belong to the East have. And she\nhad large eyes, and a nice small mouth\u2014hke Feda's 1\nFeda's mouth is only a quarter as big as hers [Mrs.\nLeonard's]. And I got a straight nose\u2014not long,\nonly just medium\u2014but very straight one. Mr. Bill,\nI saw this at Mrs. Isabel's and I Avanted her to\nknow it was like me. And will you ask her why\nshe does not put her hats away, for if she leaves\n'em about like that some one might sit on them 1\nShe left a hat out on a chair yesterday. And,\nMr, Bill, I see that she's got some pale pinky stuff,\nsome soft stuff, that I think she must have got\nlately. Long piece of new, pale pink. And I\nthought it would look nice when properly done, but\nI think she's going to make it into something.\nThat's what it felt like. And, Mr. BiU, you Imow I\nlike cats ? The one I mean wasn't a live one. I\ncouldn't pick it up to see if it was a stuffed one.\nI won't be long, Dora. I don't know\u2014hadn't got\na proper back to, but it was a figure of a cat, do\nyou see ? There was something red close to him,\nand he looked like a very pretty, nice round-faced\ncat, not a thin one.\nNotes by Miss Newton.\n1. Picture of a girl. The description corresponds, as\nfar as it goes, with a copy of Greuze\u2014The Milkmaid\n\u2014which hangs by the side of the fireplace in my room.\n2. Why she does not put her hats away ? I am sorry to\nhave to admit that I rather often neglect to put my hat\naway, and that I leave it on a chair or on a couch until\nthe morning. This nearly always happens when I am\n\f200 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PAET\nspending the evening out, and have no time to put my\nthings away before I go.\n(This statement is confirmed by Miss A. B. Hornibrook,\na friend of Miss Newton's.)\n3. Pale pinky stuff. I had no pale pinky stuff, but I\nhad been, a week or ten days before the sitting, with a\nfriend to buy some pale pink silk, and it was essential\nthat it should be soft. A few days later (and just before\nthe sitting) this friend visited me in my flat, and I re-\nmember she then told me that she didn't like the pink\nstuff, it Avas not as soft, as it should have been for her\npurpose.\n4. Picture of a cat and something red close to him. The\nonly red thing in my room is a small red candle on a\nred match-box, which stands on the mantelpiece. Quite\nclose to it is a miniature painting of the head of a Peki-\nnese dog, a round-faced, fat Pekinese. There is no picture,\nnor figuie, of a cat in the room.\n{b) Extract from, a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nThursday, November 20, 1924.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. E. J. Dingwall.\nFedA. She's speaking about Mrs. Isabel now ; Feda's Mrs.\nIsabel ? Yes, Feda's Mrs. Isabel. Wait a bit !\nYou'll have to tell me that in another way. Mr.\nBill, Dora's been to see her too. Yes, and will you\nask her did she want some new music just lately 1\nDora couldn't quite see what it was, but she felt her\nwishing for new music. [Note 1.] And what is the\ngood of cutting stuff up into small pieces, and\nrolling it up, and joutting it away, and not using\nit ? Pink ! She intended to do something with it\nat the time, but she's left it and left it, and left\nit, and Dora knows it is something pink. [Note 2.]\nHow stupid people are with keys ! And she was\nsaying too, \" How stupid people are v^'ith keys !\nHow stupid they are !\n\" Something another person\nhad done about keys and, Dora sayS; Isabel was\nrather cross about. Stupid arrangement, that was\nthe idea she got from her. . . . [Note 3.]\n\f99] Sittings ivith Mrs. Leonard. 201\nNotes by Miss Newton.\n1. I have not wanted new music ; I cannot identify the\naUusion, unless it is an idea associated with (3).\n2. This allusion at once reminded me of the numerous\nsmall pieces of a navy bhie jumper which I had unpicked\nand intended to use as a pattern for another, and in the\nmeantime had rolled up and put away in a drawer, where\nit has remained for some time. I have come across it\ntwo or three times lately, a long slender roU, and remem-\nbered what I intended to do with it. Associated with it\nin my mind, because it too reminds me of an intention\nnot carried out, is a small roll of 2^i'>^k lingerie material\ncut out. But this is in one ]3iece, not \" small \" pieces.\nIt is true that I have \"left it and left it.\"\n3. On Monday, November 10, 1924, I forgot when leaving\nthe Office to turn off the electric heating switches which\nhad been on all day in the seance room. I remembered\nthem later, and as the medium, Willy Schneider, was arriving\nfrom Vienna the same evening for an investigation by the\nSociety, I was afraid to risk an accident in the seance\nroom by leaving the switches on all night. I therefore\nleft my friend, M. B. C, with whom I was dining before\ngoing to a concert of Hungarian music at 8 p.m. at the\nAeoHan Hall, and returned to 31 Tavistock Square, where\nI found all the doors in the haU locked, and the house-\nkeeper and his wife out. I could not find the keys, and\nso could not get to the seance room, the intervening room\nbeing locked. I was cross and thought it stupid to have\nput the keys where they could not be found, altogether\n\" a stupid arrangement,\" and said so to M. B. C. when\nI rejoined her at the Aeolian Hall.\nI. Newton.\nThe allusion at the sitting to new music is perhaps an\ninstance of how an idea may be got telepathically and\nmisinterpreted. It will be noted that the idea of music\nwas closely associated in Miss Newton's mind with the\nincident of the keys, for she was on her way to a concert\nwhen this incident occurred.\n\f202 Mrs. W. H. Salter.\n'\n[part\n\u00a76.\nA simple and striking instance of the kiad of evidence\nwith which this chapter is concerned occurred at a sitting\ntaken by one of our American Members, Mrs. Edward\nWood Allison, who came over from America in the summer\nof 1924 for the purpose of havmg sittings with Mrs.\nLeonard, and obtained some good results. At a sitting\nshe had on Jime 11, 1924, either Dr. Allison or Dr. J. H.\nHyslop, who were purportmg to communicate,\u2014it is not\nvery clear which\u2014was said to have paid a visit to the\nSecretary, Miss Newton, in her flat. In this connection\nFeda referred to an impression of some laundry having\njust been delivered, and went on :\nFeda. Would you mind asking IVIrs. Isabel why she wanted\nto know would the one key open two things, two\nlocks. This is from your gentleman [Dr. Allison].\nShe was a bit puzzled about a key. She kept\nsaying, \" I wonder if this will do as well as the\nlock it Avas meant for.\"\nTo this Miss Newton appends the following note :\nJune 11, 1924.\nWhen J\\Irs. Allison read the above note to me I was\nat once reminded of the following incident. I have a\nsmall locked hanging cupboard in my flat which, having\nlost the key, I have not used for some years. For the\nlast two or three weeks I have had it in mind, for having\nfound a use for it, I decided to hang it, if I could get\na key to open it, and I have been intending to go to\na locksmith and borrow some small keys. Last Thursday\nevening\u2014or it may possibly have been Friday morning,\nbut I think not\u2014I was getting ready to go aAvay for\nthe week-end, and putting away an attache case I had\njust bought for a birthday present for a friend. I caught\nsight of the key and wondered if it would fit the cupboard\nlock. It did not, and I then thought of the key of my\nown attache case and tried it, and then the keys, one after\nthe other, of four or five writing and other small cases,\nwondering in each case \" if this will do.\"\nFeda said earlier in the sitting that a visit had been\n\f!J9] Sittings ivith Mrs. Leonard. 203\nmade to my home\u2014by either Dr. Hyslop or Dr. Allison\u2014and\nshe referred in connection with it to the delivery of my\nlaundry. The delivery of the laundry takes place on\nThursday evening.\nI tried the keys either on Thursday evening or Friday\nmorning. I think it was probably Thursday evening, for\non Friday morning my cousin called before I left for the\nS.P.R. and consequently I was pressed for time.\nI.

Will you also notice if any one shows you some new\nwood, new wood, of a rather beautiful kind ? Dora\nfeels some one Avill show it to you with a little\npride. Dora gets the idea that it's either new wood,\nor wood that's been newly polished or painted.\nNow, Mr. Bill, you may go to two places where\nthat will happen\u2014one place will not be nearly so\nright, so important, as the other. Now, can you\nexplain that bit better, Dora ? She says, \" Both\nplaces will fit, two places will both fit this test,\nthough in rather different ways, and\u2014use this word\n\u2014degrees.\" One place is the Psychical 'Searchers.\nThat, she hopes, Avill be rather an interesting veri-\nfication. [Note 1.]\nAlso with the Psychical 'Searchers, see if they're going\nto have their\u2014what done ? Grates done. Dora's\nsure that something had been talked and thought\nabout in connection with their grates. Not their\ngreats people, but fire-grates. Mr. Gelly and Mr.\nPiddy, and the old Lady is greats, but not fire-\ngrates, and I think that part of it is rather a joke.\n[Note 2.]\nAttempts at turnmg the place into a 'servatory !\nW. S. I. I should think it is.\nF. There's been some measuring going on there, Mi'. Bill,\nlike some one carefully saying, \" How long is that ?\n\"\n\f204 Mrs. W. H. Suiter. [part\nThis way (Feda illustrates measuring horizontally).\nLike that sort of way. [Note I.]\nAnd will you ask what it is that won't fit into the\n\u2014\n\" Now, Dora says, I'll have to use two words\u2014the\nrecess or corner ?\n\" Have you got that ?\nW. S. I. Yes. [Note 3.]\nF. Hanging something new up on the wall ! Will you\nsee if something new has just, quite lately, been\nhung up on the wall ? Dora's got a very strong\nfeeling of something, but couldn't tell if it was any-\nthing important or not. She only got the thought\nof the action. [Note 4.]\nThere's something else that she got puzzled h'er a\nlittle. Some one has been thinking there that there\nought to be a better system of\u2014what ? Signalling.\nYes, use this word signalling. Dora says, \" It will\nprobably mean some one ringing the bell, or sig-\nnalling in that way. Like letting one know, she\nsays, so please be sure to find out what it was.\"\nDora didn't quite understand it. [Note 5.]\nMr. Bill, there's another thing. I don't know if you\nknow it yet. Are you going to talk about some\nnew experimenting? Dora feels that you'll be drawn\ninto a dis-cushion.\nW. S. I. Is that the latest pronunciation ?\nF. That's right! Some say \"discussion.\" It should be\n\" dis-cushion.\" A discussion about\u2014what, Dora \"?\nAbout a new method or new idea of psychical\nexperiments. [Note 6.)\nAzotes by Mr. Irving and various Members of the\nS.P.R. Staff.\n1. Next day, Wednesday, April 29, 1925, I had a sitting\nwith Mr. Vout Peters, and after the sitting asked him if\nhe had a Buddha in his house. This I had to do, because\nat a Leonard sitting on September 25, 1924, I -was asked\nwhether I had been somewhere lately where there was a\nBuddha, and the only possible place I could think of was\nMr. Vout Peters' house. '^\\r. Peters took us into his front\nroom and shoA\\ ed us three. One, very small, in a cabinet,\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 205\nhe pointed to, was made of wood. The wood was neither\nnew nor painted. No wood was shown me at the S.P.R.\nRooms, and at another Leonard sitting on Thursday, April\n30, 1925, the subject was returned to, as follows :\nFeda. There's something that you thought you were going\nto find, that she told you of at the sitting with\nFeda the other day which you haven't found yet.\nMay not get through till to-morrow. Have you got\nthat down, Mr. Bill, for it's rather important ?\nSomething she expected you to find out yesterday,\nand it hasn't been your fault, and it isn't Dora's\nfault, but circumstances have prevented you tracing\nit. . . . Dora keeps saying, \" To-morrow, to-morrow.\"\nShe feels you're going to verify something to-morrow.\nNote Continued.\nAgain the test failed ! Though I was at the S.P.R.\nRooms for some time on Friday morning I -was not shown\nany wood. On Saturday, therefore, before returning home,\nI read this to Miss Newton. She tells me that she has\nbeen showing a new polished bookcase to people lately.\nIt looks therefore as though an attempt to impress Miss\nNewton to show it to me failed\u2014perhaps because the notes\nof sittings we had to go through I'equired concentrated\nattention and there was little time afterwards to talk about\nanything else.\nW. S. Irving.\nThe new sections of bookcases were delivered and put\nin place in the Library on April 15, 1925. They are\nhighly polished, and do not match in shade the old\nsections. The man who took the order said that was\nunavoidable, on account of the newness of the wood in\nthe sections to be added.\nThe addition of the six large new sections and the\nre-arrangement of the old ones were the outcome of much\nthought, measuring and planning with the object of\nacquiring extra book-space and at the same time of\nremoving the defect of hitherto uneven lines of shelves.\nThis object accomplished, we felt a \" little pride \" in\n\f06 Mrs. W.

In the autumn of 1924 tlie excessive consumption of\ncoal in the kitchen during the year began to cause us\nanxiety, and in November the question of remedying it\nwas much in our minds. On December 5 the House and\nFinance Committee examined estimates both for the re-\npairing of the old range and for the substitution of a\nsmall modern economy-range, and after fully discussing the\nquestion, they decided on the latter. The arrangements\nfor this were then the subject of discussion between us\nand both the builders and the Bedford Estate, where\nobjections were raised. Finally differences were adjusted\nand the grate was put in early in February, 1925.\nI. Newton.\nE. M. HORSELL.\n3. The re-arrangement in the Library left over a stack\nof sections which were required for the accommodation of\nbooks recently added to the Loan Library. The only\navailable room for it was the recess in the N.W. corner,\nwhere two large pictures of psychical interest were hanging.\nWhen the stack was in position, it was found that there\nwas not enough space between it and the corner for the\npicture that had been hanging there. ^ ^-r\n^ ^ ^ I.

On the Friday of this week, May 1, 1925, Dr. Woolley\nkindly invited me to take part in a sitting for physical\nphenomena that evening, which I did. I knew nothing at\nthe time of the Leonard sitting of these new experiments.\nW. S. Irving.\nWith regard to the question of what normal knowledge\n]\\'Irs. Leonard might have concerning recent events occur-\nring at the Society's rooms, it is to be observed that she\nhas never visited these rooms since the removal of the\nSociety to 31 Tavistock Square. She did on two or three\noccasions visit the Society's former rooms iii Hanover\nSquare for the purpose of giving sittings there. In one\nor two cases it is possible, though not, I think, very\nprobable, that she may have derived some information\nfrom chance remarks made by sitters who were Members\nof the Society and had been lately to the rooms. But in\nseveral cases Imowledge of the events to which reference\nseems to be made could only have been obtained\u2014by\nnormal means\u2014from the Officers of the Society, and this\nexplanation we may reasonably dismiss.\nCHAPTER II.\nBook-Tests.\nReaders of Proceedings will be familiar with that par-\nticular type of evidence, obtained through Mrs. Leonard's\nmediumship, to which the name of \" book-test \" has been\ngiven, for a report on the subject by ]Mrs. Sidgwick was\npublished in Volume XXXI. pp. 241 ff. The book-tests\nthere dealt with, are described by Mrs. Sidgwick as \"attempts\nby IVIrs. Leonard's control to indicate the contents of a\nparticular page of a particular book which j\\Irs. Leonard\nhas not seen with her bodily eyes and which is not,\n\f208 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nat the time of the .sittuig, kiiowji to the sitter.\" I\ndo not propose to enter into any general discussion of\nl)ook-tests here, since this ground has already been\ncovered hy Mrs. Sidgwick. I need only say that, broadly\nspeaking, I think Mr. Irving's results in this field may\nbe considered fairly typical. I have not fomid in Mr.\nIrving's records any instances of success as striking as\nthe very best of those recorded by Mrs. Sidgwick ; on the\nother hand the average of his results is good, quite up to\nthe average of other successful sitters. In this particular\nkind of evidence, as Mrs. Sidgwick found, sitters, or per-\nhaps we should say communicators, differ greatly in the\ndegree of success they attain. An interesting point in Mr.\nIrving's tests is that in an unusual number of instances\nthe books to which reference was made were situated in\nrooms which were almost, if not quite, unknown to Mr.\nIrving, and with which he had no close link of any kind.\nTo succeed in these circumstances is asserted by communi-\ncators to be more difficult. To what extent this assertion\nis justified we cannot say without knowing more than we\ndo at present as to the modus operandi, but it is certainly\nthe case that successfid instances of this particular type of\nbook-test are rare. I have included three such instances\n(see below, pp. 209, 216, 239). Of these three the\nsecond is better than the first, and the third is the best\nof all. This last case contains one of the few instances I\nhave observed in Mr. Irving's records in which a correct\nstatement was made to the effect that a particular word\nwould be found on a particular page. A few similar cases\nare discussed by Mrs. Sidgwick in her report, pj). 270-289.\nIt is unfortunate that there are not more of such cases on\nrecord, since they are free from the defect so often observ-\nable in book-tests that the indications given in regard to\nthe matter to be found in the place nadicated are too\nvague and leave too much scope to individual interpre-\ntation. In the particular case recorded here the evidence\nis slightly marred by some doubt as to the way in which\nthe pages of the book are to be counted\u2014another difficulty\nwhich is only too frequent in book-tests\u2014but when due\nallowance has been made for this defect the case still seems\n\f99] Siftings ivilli Mrs. Leonard. 209\nto me to afi'ord good evidence for knowledge supernor-\nmally acquired.\nThe first attempt at a book-test whicli occurred at Mr.\nIrving's sittings will be found recorded in the S.P.R.\nJournal, Vol. XX., pp. 153 ft\".

It's like a kind of flat and she says she\ndoesn't think you go up any stairs to it. You\nknow where she means now ?\nW. S. I. Yes, I do.\nF. You know the room he sits in ? It's rather a com-\nfortable room. Well, do you remember some books\non shelves near the fire ? She says there's one slielf\n(Feda holds her hand about 4 feet 6 inches from the\nground).

But, turn-\ning over that page on to the next one, a great\nfeeling of happiness comes from the words at the\ntop of the next page, and she felt so much that\nshe would have liked to repeat them to you, could\nshe materialise and speak herself. You would un-\nderstand that it's just what she would like to say.\nShe says, \" Now just before that message on page\n71 she didn't get such a happy feeling from the\nbook. She got a feeling of sorrow, anxiety, some-\nthing made her feel depressed ; and she says that's\nall about the actual book, but she had a feeling\nthat Mr. Charley intended buying something new\n\f210 Mrs. W.

I, Yes.\nV. Because she thought it would be a specially good thing\nbeing in his room. She says, \" It couldn't be tele-\npathy from you then.\"\nNoie by Mr. Irving.\nOn Thursday, June 9, I went to Colonel Baddelej^'s flat\nto see if 1 coidd verify this book-test. I had not seen\nColonel Baddeley for two months, and do not think I had\n. been in his dining-room for nearly five. The flat is on\nthe ground floor. Colonel Baddeley and I verified the test\ntogether. The book shelves are in the dining-room, the\ntojo shelf being about 4 feet 6 inches from the ground. The\nbooks were placed in the shelves in piles horizontally.\nTaking the count from the left, the question arose whether\nthe fourth book should be the fourth from the top or\nbottom of the shelf. I decided on the top, before opening\nany book. The fourth from the top was Telepathy, by\nW. W. Baggally. The reference on p. 71 was to a de-\nscription of an exhibition given to Mr. Baggally by the\nZancigs. The communicator in life was intensely fond of\nall entertainments of this sort. There was a reason why\nshe should be, which I have told to the Secretary of the\nS.P.R., but caimot make public.\nTurning over the page and commencing in the middle of\nthe third line from tlie top of page 72 I found the words\n\" the fact that there is a method of communicating.\"\nTurning back again, and two thirds down page 70, the\ngreater part of which page is taken up with a letter, I\nfound \" the contents of the above letter were of a dis-\ncouraging nature.\"\nColonel Baddeley had been intending to buy a new book\nwhich had been recommended to him, but had not done\nso. It was stated at the sitting that the communicator\nthought it would be specially good that the book chosen\nfor the test should be from Colonel Baddeley 's room, as\n\f^9] Sittings loitli Mrs. Leonard. '\n211\nshowing tJiat it was not telepathy from mc. It i.s in\nstriking accord Avith tlic characteristic humour of tlie\ncommunicator that the book selected should be Telepathy.\nWith regard to the communicator's reference to some-\nthing she was \" peculiarly fond of,\" both Miss Newton and\nI have been informed of Mr. Irving's reason for thinking\nthat the passage apparently indicated is appropriate, and\nwe think that he is justified in his opinion.\nIt should be stated that Mrs. Leonard had never visited\nColonel Baddeley at his flat.\n\u00a72. A Book About Birds.\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 24, 1922.\nSitter :\nRev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Colonel C. E. Baddeley.\nFeda. Book about birds, birds. Book about birds, book\nabout bkds. I d6n't think that's the sort of book\nhe would have, Mrs. Dora ? She's talking about a\nbook about birds, seems all about bkds. Seems to\nbe a book you've got now, Mr. BiU. I don't know\nif you'll remember Dora rather fond of birds ?\nW. s. I. Yes.\nF. Not about one particular breed of burd, but all kinds\nof bu-ds, and I got a feeling of pictures of birds\ntoo, not only just readings. I think she been re-\nminded of this book lately. Not a new book, Mr.\nBill, feel to Feda as if a good many years old.\nGet a strong feehng with it that\u2014first that had to\ndo with all English birds\u2014she gives me the feehng\nof bu-ds belonging to a place a long long way away.\nRather a south place, south and warm, southern,\nsouthern. Just near the beginning, I think there's\na name rather 'portant beginning with F. I keep\ngetting the figure 16. Letter F, and then 16. I\ndon't hke to say it tiU she tells me, but I wonder\nif it's anything to do with page 16, as she keeps\nmaking a movement of turning over. AU to do\nwith the bird book. About page 16 whatever this\nis is at lower part of book, at bottom. Get these\nwords '\u2022\nbrown spots, brown spots.\" I'm just giving\n\f212 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nit as she says it, 'cos it's best. Got to what ?\nGot to have some alterations done ? She's jumped\naway from the bird book now\u2014pity because it's a\nnice book. It's a particular book rather, that is,\nMr. Bill. Not like a book she thinks you wouldn't\nknow. She going back to it now. Usually wher\nshe gives it, she doesn't know, she says first book,\nsecond shelf, like that. Something in the bird book\n\u2014dunno what it's for\u2014somebody's written inside it.\nGot a feeling\u2014I can't see it, but she pretends to\nwrite something inside it. She just Avent like that.\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nI at once recognised this book from Feda's description,\nas being a copy of John's British Birds in their Haunts.\nIt deals mainly with British birds, but includes also rare\nvisitors to this country. The book is copiously illustrated\nwith pictures of birds. 1 have had the book for nearly\n35 years, as it one of several given to me when a\nboy as a school prize. I seldom have reason to refer to\nthis book, but recently had occasion to in connection\nwith the tests for chance-coincidence in book-tests Avhich\nyou [Mrs. Salter] sent me. (See 8.P.R. Proceedings, Vol.\nXXXIII. p. 606). This was one of the ten books from\nwhich my \" chance \" tests were taken. Four days after the\nabove sitting I returned home and tried to verify the test.\nThe book was on the shelves in my drawing-room. It has\n626 pages without counting a long preface. I had no con-\nscious knowledge of the contents of any particular page.\nOn page 16 I found nothing particularly appropriate to\nthe test, so examined page 15, which is at the back of\npage 16, as in a former book-test of mine I had found\nconfusion between the front and back of a page. More\nthan half of page 15 is taken up by a picture of The\nPeregrine Falcon. This picture is 3 inches long, and the\nbreast of the bird appears to be heavily spotted. ITnrler-\nneath the picture are the words in large letters :\nTHE PEREGRINE FALCON.\nFALCO PEREGRIN US.\nThere follow eleven lines of description. Line 5 has the\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 213\nwords \" Ui)pei\" plumage tinged with bruwii.\" Lines G and\n7,\n\" Eggs dull light red, spotted and blotched with deep\nred.\" These last words are only | of an inch from the\nbottom of the reading material on this page. The book\ncan well be described as a \" nice \" '\"\nparticular \" book.\nIt is a valuable copy, bound in morocco and gold, with\nthe crest of Bedford School in gold on the cover. On the\ninside of the cover is Avritten my name, and also \" Class\nPrize. Form III. 2. Midsummer, 1887.''\nSince the apparently relevant matter was found on page\n15, not on page 16, it is worth noting that on this occa-\nsion the communicator does not seem to have been as\nexplicit as usual in the matter of the ^^.ge reference.\nFinally the reference is given by Feda as \" about page\n16,\n\"'\nwhich seems to indicate some consciousness of doubt.\nWith reference to Feda's words about \" birds belonging\nto ... a south place,\" Mr. Irving sent me a quotation\nfrom the Preface to the book, as follows :\nThe pecuhar geographical position of the British Isles\nrenders them the resort, either permanent or temjjorary, of\na large number of Birds : amongst which are many periodical\nvisitors, both from high latitudes, driven southwards in winter\nby the severity of the cold ; and from Africa, whence they\nfly northwards at the opposite season, in order to avoid\nthe intense heat of an intertropical summer.\n\u00a7 3. \" Burning Fires.\"\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, September 22, 1922.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Colonel C. E. Baddeley.\nFeda. It's a book-test first she's giving. Now wait. Mi\\\nBill, are you ready ? Do you know what she calls\nthe shelves you've got with some books on them,\nrather low ?\nW. S. I. Not for the moment.\nF. You must get the place right, you see. It is where\nyou hve, Mr. Bill, like in your own place. Some\npeople have to reach u^) high for books\u2014these not.\nShe says shelves, shelves, not one shelf under a\n\f214 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\ncupboard. They feel to be fairly broad. She says\nthe second shelf up counting fiom the bottom, 5\nfrom the right, 5, 5, Avait a minute, that's not right\n!\nShe wants to make a remark hei'e. In that room\nit would be more natural for you to walk round\nand count from the right, but she hasn't done.\nShe's gone to left, Mr. Bill. Couldn't help feehng\nthat, the arrangement of room, furniture, etc.\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nThe room is my drawing-room, and a round table nearly\n3 feet in Avidth is in front of the book-shelves. It is easy\nto get to the books on the right, but not to those on the\nleft without moving the table.\nThere followed an attempt to refer to the contents of a\nbook described as \" the fifth from the left \" in the shelf\nmentioned above. Mr. Irvmg could find nothing appro-\npriate in this book, though he found what he thought\nwere appropriate passages in the fourth book from the\nleft. This part of the test, however, I do not give in\ndetail. A second test from another book in the same\nshelf was given as follows :\nFeda. Going along to the end of that shelf, right-hand side,\nfelt a book, the end or end but one, reminded her\nof Asia. A good deal to do Avith the East in it.\nShe wants you to open that book, do you see, and\nshe Avants you to open it at page 107, and look\nabout half-Avay to three-quarter Avay down the page,\nand you'll see something about fires burning, burning\nfires. [Note 1.]\nAt the very beginning of that book, she means right,\nright, right at the beginning some Avonderful Avords\nthat should exactly apply to you and to your\npresent conditions ; in fact they are a clear indi-\ncation of the line you should take, of the way you\nshould think of things at present. [Note 2.]\nIs there a little table, a very small table, close to\nthese books ?\nW. S. I. Fairly small, in fact two tables.\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 215\nYes, she says, the rather bigger one, she thinks., a\nlittle nearer the books. One has got\u2014oh dear, oh\ndear ! isn't it a noosance !\n\u2014one has got a piece\ncoming undone from underneath his top. Think\nit's top of his leg.\nW. S. I. I didn't know.\nF. She's telling you. It's coming undone. She kno^^'s\nyou won't mind when you find she's told you about\nit. [Note 3.]\nNotes by Mr. Irving.\n1. The end book on the right was Old Tef<tament Portraits,\nby Cunningham Geikie. The book is almost entirely con-\nnected with Asia. It is a series of biographies of Old\nTestament heroes, most of them living in the Holy Land,\nbut the later ones in Babjdon and the Persian Empire,\netc. I have never read this book.\nThe book is a large one, each page ^ inches in length.\nOn page 107 and 5| inches down the page are the words\n\"Mount Sinai.\" No student of the Bible could fail to\nthink of burning tire in connection Avith this mountain.\nI quote the following from the BooJi of Exodus :\n\" And\nMount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord\ndescended upon it in fire. . . . And the sight of the glory of\nthe Lord was like devouring iire on the top of the mount.\"\n2. In consequence of the emphasis laid upon this part\nof the test being right at the beginning of the book, I\nsearched the fly-leaves. The first was blank, the second\nhad the title only of the book, the third had the adver-\ntisement of three books by the same author in large type\nwith short criticisms below. The third of them was as\nfollows :\nLight from Beyond.\nTo cheer the Christian Pilgrim.\n3. The larger table is right in front of the shelves, only\nabout a foot away. The smaller table is ^ feet to the\nright. I find that two of the supports are rather loose\nnear the top of the legs, but this is too trivial a matter\nto be noticed. I think there has been an attempt here\nto refer to an incident many years old. This table is of\n\f216 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nimitation marquetry, and was painted and polished by my\nwife. The top of the table was broken in two during a\nremoval, and had to be clamped together under the top\nto be rendered serviceable.\n\u00a7 4. The Book Shop.\nFurther Extract from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nSeptember 22, 1922.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Colonel C. E. Baddeley.\nFeda. J3o you know\u2014however will he find that out, Dora ?\nHowever am I going to explain that to him ? Oh\ndear ! dear ! I don't know ! Mr. Bill, I don't know\nhow you're going to do this. You know where you\nlive ? Well, she's taking me rather away from\nwhere you live to a street she's often been to with\nyou, and that you often go doAvn now, do you see ?\nYou go\u2014you're in a street like that (indicates\nstraight forward), and j^ou come into what you call\na main road. You turn round that way [to the\nright] and you get to some shops, and one of the\nshops on that side (Feda \\\\aves her hand to the\nright) seems to sell rather a mixed-up kind of lot\nof things. I dunno what it is I see, but I see in\nthe window like packets about that big [about six\ninches] with little pictures on in front.\nW. S. I. How broad ?\nF. Not more than three to four inches broad, Mr. Bill,\nand in the corner of the window there's some sticks\n\u2014not standing up straight, but leaning against some-\nthing. It looked to her like a glass dish too in the\nwindow, with some little round things in it too,\nsmall. Several things with pictures on too in the\nwindow, do you see ? When you go in through the\ndoor of the shop, it's not a very long counter,\nrather short. The other side of the shop there's\nsome book- shelves and Dora noticed that the top\nshelf was hardly ever touched, or put out of place\n\u2014supposed it Asas too luuch trouble\u2014so she ran\ndown to-day and took a book-test. Top shelf\u2014\n\u2022\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 217\nrather high up. The book she took was third book\nfrom the left, and she opened it at page 33, and\nthere was such a nice message on that page, on the\nlower part, a nice message from her to you ; and\nthe message seemed to speak of proving love\u2014not\nonly loving, but proving love. Turning that page\nover\u2014stood upon something\u2014she made it as simple\nas she could\u2014turning that one page over she got a\nfeeJing it spoke of rich and richer conditions, gaining\nmoney, do you see 1 'Fraid that didn't apply to\nyou, Mr. Bill, she say, but she thought it would\ninterest j^ou. . . . She says she felt sure these\nbooks are hardly ever touched. Mr. Bill, she's been\nthere with you. Do you Imow\u2014is there a woman\nconnected with that shop looks about middle-aged ?\nShe try to identify it.\nW. S. I. Is it a Library ?\nF. Tisn\"t a big Library. It's a shop that sells other\nthings, but they lend books out too. The Library's\nonly a small part of it, do you see ? A very small\n23art too. About this ^^'oman\u2014Dora kept sensing\nthe woman looking about that age and suffering\nfrom bad health. Not see her, felt her.\nW. S. I. Which side of the road is the shop ?\nF. As you stand in front of the shop and look up that\nway\u2014I can draw it, ]\\Ir. Bill.\nW. S. I. Oh, good. (Feda draws as below :)\n[Drawn from here hy Feda. W.S.I.]^\nF. As you stand by the shop, buildings not quite flat\n\u2014\none sticks out more than in. If you look at him\n^ This is not a tracing of Feda's drawing, hut is a sufficiently exact\nreproduction of it. The dot is intended by Feda to represent tlie position\nof the shop. H. de G. S.\n\f218 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nnow she thinks you'll see where he is. Mr. Bill,\nshe says she did get part of the position wrong at\nfirst ; she's made it right by what she done with\nFeda. Is there a meat place near it ?\nW. S. I. Rather.\nF. You would pass a meat place going to it.\nW. S. I. Yes.\nF. Don't like meat places, nasty places. There's a board\nup with a B name on it\u2014not stand tor butchers\nwhat makes meat, it's a name. The more she can\ngive about it\u2014but higher up than this shop isn't\npart of a place being taken down 1 Part of his front\nbeing taken down, do you see ? Noosance ! Like\ntaken off\u2014like his face, 'tis a noosance ! Mr. Bill,\nthe street isn't quite even there, it goes a bit\nnarrower. Wait a minute. What is it ? Dora says\nremember about it. Is it an arch ? Is there an\narchway close there ? I get the feeling of an arch-\nway close there, Mr. Bill.\nW. S. I. Right.\nF. Feel as if I turn off there like that, you can go down\nto a stream\u2014running water. There's like a very\nnarrow place near to that shop, Mr. Bill. Is there\nsomething to do with horses in the window ? Dora\nsensed something, looking in window, to do with\nhorses. You might look and see. She's 'fraid she's\ngiving you a lot of trouble Avith tests to-day, but\nthe test is mackintoshes and umbrellas, test is.\nW. S. I. Is what ?\nF. Means that. No, she says \" water-tight.\" The more\nwater-tight, the more difficult it must necessarily\nbe to verifv. That is right.\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nAt the time of the sitting I had been away from home\nfor 18 days in London and Yorkshire. The shop described\nis in the little town of Newent, about one mile from my\nVicarage. The description of tlie road to the sho]:) is\nfairly accurate ; about half-way down to the shop the\nroad turns to the right, as described, at a point where\n\fSittings with Mrs. Leonard. 219\nanother road joins it from the left, almost at right angles,\nbut it is not so much a main road as the road on which\nT live. I did not recognise the shop until Feda described\nthe interior with the book-shelves, because the shop is on\nthe left-hand side as you go from OxenhaJl to Newent.\nFeda indicated the right. This may, however, not have\nbeen a mistake, as I first supposed ; it may liave been\ndue to the method by which the test was given. If\npictures of various points eyi route were flashed up by the\ncommunicator and the last was given from a point opposite\nthe shop but a little to the left, the position would be\ncorrect. This is the jjoint from which Feda's drawing was\nmade. There is no doubt whatever as to the shop in-\ntended. It is the only book-shop in Newent, and is as\ndescribed by Feda. \" 'Tisn't a big Library. It's a shop\nthat sells other things, but they lend books out too.\" On\nMonday, Sept. 25, I Avent into Newent to verify the test.\nThe shop has two windows, one on the right as you enter\nwhich I will call -window A, the other on the left in an\nannex, window B. I believe there is a small third\nwindow also, but that does not concern the test. Beyond\nthe fact that there was probably stationery and ornaments\nin the window I had no idea of the contents. They are\nnot as a rule interesting in small local shops. In window\nA there were three or four boxes of about the size men-\ntioned, some of cardboard, some of wood with coloured\npictures and coloured letters on the outside. In the corner\nof the window about half a dozen lead pencils tied together\nstanding upright. Also many picture postcards, china vases\nand small round articles of china. In window B one or\ntwo boxes with pictures on, rather narrower than described,\ntwo toy horses and carts fairly large, a hunting-crop and\ntwo Avhips, and three large cardboard boxes in a prominent\nposition filled with round balls, some large, some small,\nsome coloured and some plain. I noticed next day that\nthere was a bundle of broomsticks standing outside the\nwindow of the next shop, leaning against the corner.\nOn entering the shop the counter is on the right and is\nrather short. On the left, opposite the counter, were\nshelves full of new books\u2014not part of the LibrarA'. The\n\f220 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\ntop shelf was, I should think, about OJ feet in height.\nI bought the third book from the left on the to]) shelf.\nIt proved to be Roland Yorke, by Mrs. Henry Wood.\nThe lower part of page 33 is about a man who has just\nheard of the premature death of a favourite nephew, but\nwho does not go to the funeral mainly because he does\nnot wish to leave his wife who is ill. Commencing rather\nmore than half-way down the page the text is as follows ;\nMrs. Greatorex had fallen into ill-health for some\ntime past now ; in fact she was slowly dying of an in-\ncurable complaint. But for not liking to leave her,\nMr. Greatorex might have hastened down as soon as\nthe sad news reached him of his nephew's premature\nend. I say he '\"\nmight,\" but Mr. Greatorex was him-\nself only recovering from an attack of illness, and was\nscarcely strong enough to travel. And so he ivaited\nat home unih all the j^a^iejice he could call up, under-\nstanding nothing but that his nephew John, Avho had\nbeen as dear to him as were his own children, was\ndead,\nI am suggesting that the \" proving love \" as a nice\nmessage from my wife to me is contained in the sentence\nabout \" waiting at home with all the patience he could\ncall up.\" It is in accordance with messages I have been\ngetting from my wife through Feda and Belle [Mrs.\nBrittain's control] to the effect that she is doing so.\nTurning over the page, I found on page 34 as follows\u2014\nI\ncommence at line 14 :\nIt was a very large house : it had been two\noriginally. In the old old days some thirty or more\nyears ago, Mr. Greatorex had rented only one of the\nhouses. As his family and his business increased, he\nbought the one he occupied and the next adjoining\nand made them into one.\nThere is a middle-aged woman connected with the shop.\nI don't know about her health\u2014she's not a robust person.\nThe details of the surroundings seem fairly accurate. I\nenclose Feda's drawings [see above] and one of mine for\ncomparison. I have to pass three meat shops between\n\f99] SiUing.'i with Mrs. Leonard. 221\nOxenliall and this shop. A board over the shop has W.\nH. Bendle on it. Higher up the street I noticed a ladder\nand found tJiat a workman had just finished colour-washing\nin yellow the outside of a house, and was beginning to\npaint. The street goes narrower where the shop is and\nalso higher up. There is the \" archway to the George\nHotel \" about 50 yards from Bendle's, on the other side\nof the road ; and about another 50 yards further on, but\non the shop side, a footpath goes through Newent Church-\nyard and down a narrow lane over a small stream of\nrunning water. I was not sure of this, as I hardly ever\nuse this path, but have been to see.\nTo this note were appended the two following confir-\nmatory statements :\nOn September 25 I inspected the two windows of Mr.\nBendle's shop. The contents of the windows were as\nstated by Mr. Irving. t~. ^^\n* R. R. Farmer.\nYew House, Newent,\n11.10.22\nII.\nThis is to certify that the 3rd book from the left, top\nshelf in the library at Mr. Bendle's shop in Newent on\nSept. 25, 1922, was Roland Yorlce. The books are oppo-\nsite the counter. ^ ^\nP. Bendle.\nSept. 25, 1922.\nIt does not seem necessary to reproduce Mr. Irving's\ndrawing (referred to above) ; it is in substantial agreement\nwith Feda's sketch.\n\u00a75. \" The Sum Total OF Life.\"\nOn January 24, 1923, Mr. Irving liad a sitting with\nMrs. Brittain, at which there was an attempt at a book-\ntest. Nothing at all definite was given in regard to the\ncontents of the book, but a short passage from the record\nof this sitting is worth rpioting lun-e.\n\f222 Mrs. W. H. Salter.

Dora says, \"The whole thing,\nthe sum total of our lives, is incorporated in those\npages of this book. Just on those particular places\non the pages.\" You got that ?\nW. S. I. Yes.\nF. She's got such a strong feeling something's coming\nloose close to these books. She feel you want to\nfix something up better. It's close there.\nW. S. I. Not the pile of books on the top ?\nF. No.\n\f224 Mrs. W. JJ. Salter. [part\nNote hij iMr. Irrimj.\nThe room described is niy dining-room. To the right,\nfront of where I usually sit is my A\\riting-desk with a\nrow of books along the top. To the left front is the\nsideboard, but there are only two or three books and\npapers on that. The desk is clearly indicated ;\nit stands\nat an angle between the window and a French window,\nso that the light does not fall directly on the books. On\nFriday, Jan. 26, being still in town, I read this test to\nMiss Newton and remarked that the book from which the\ntest was taken must be one of two, Kelly's Clerical Direc-\ntory, or Mortimer's Helps to Meditation. I had referred to\nboth books shortly before leaving home ;\nand, so far as\nI could remember, both had occupied the pMce of end book\nat the left-hand side recently. I did not know which I\nhad left there. On verifying the test, I found that the\nend book was Kelly s Clerical Directory, nearly 2000 pages.\nOn page 41, near the top, middle and bottom, it is all\n\" removal and change,\" for it is a hst of Curacies and\nIncumbencies, held by various Clergy. The same, however,\n^^ould apply to half the other pages ; and there is nothing\ncorresponding to the script on page 50. I then tried the\nnext book, Mortimer's Helps to Meditation, Vol. II., with\nthe following results : Page 41 ,\ncommencing in the 4th\nline,\n\" The earth bringeth forth fruit of herself, first the\nblade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\nBut when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he\nputteth in the sickle, because the Harvest is come.\" On\npage 50, Zl inches from the top of a page 8| inches in\ndepth, I found :\n\" Sin, as a necessary result, caused the\ndeath of the body by introducing that seed of decay which\nresulted from the Fall.\" Lower down the same page,\nabout an inch more than half-way down: \"The life of the\nSoul is its Union with God, in which it finds at once the\nattainment of its perfection, and the consummation of all\nits desires.\"\nWith regard to the details mentioned in the room, I\nhad not been knocking in any nails, but the French\nwindow had been sticking, warped by the damp, and it\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 225\nhad to be hammered at every time it was opened. It is\n]Dainted white, and is just opposite where I sit at table.\nA mat against the window is, I see, wearing badly. I\nhave found nothing coming loose close to the books, but\nthe back of the sideboard, nearly three yards away,\nwants securing tighter. My question as to the height of\nthe books was put because I kncAv there were a lot of\nbooks on the sofa in the window, but these are only\n\\h feet above the ground. I have only Vol. II. of\nMortimer's work.\nIt is unfortunate in this case that there seems to have\nbeen some confusion between the first and second books in\nthe row on the desk. However, as Mr. Irving \"s note shows,\nthis confusion may have been due to the recent moving\nof the books and not to a mistake on the part of the\ncommunicator or Feda. Of the three main points in the\ntest the second and third are the best ; for the statements\nmade as to the passages indicated are fairly definite and\nthe passages quoted by Mr. Irving correspond to these\nstatements ;\nthey are the kind of thing we might expect\nfrom the clues given. As to the first point, although the\nwords \" change and removal \" cannot be said to be in-\napplicable to the Biblical passage about the harvest, yet\nthese words are not quite what the passage would seem\nnaturally to suggest. A slight straining is required to\nmake the answer fit the riddle. I mention this weakness\nbecause it is one that is often found in book-tests. It is\ncharacteristic of what\u2014if we are to make a rough classi-\nfication\u2014we may call second-class as distinct from first-\nclass tests.\n\u00a76. \"Day Hours of the Church\" and\nLamb's \"Tales from Shakespeare.\"\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, August 10, 1923.\nSitter : Rev.

The way you\nstill look at it, and the way she still looks at it.\nNote by 31r. Irving,\nThis is my drawing-room. The books are, as described,\nin shelves, to the left front as you enter the room. On\na chair about six feet to the right of the book-shelves,\nlay a large roll of paper 19 inches long by 4 inches in\ndiameter. This roll I knew to be there, and to be, as I\nfound it, lying on its side, not standing up as described\nIjy Feda. The back of the chair is something like the\ndescription. The walls are white and gold, the ground-\nwork white with vertical gold lines\u2014the latter somewhat\nfaded. The 5th book from the left, 3rd shelf up, was\nDay Hours of the Ch'iirch. Following the custom my com-\nmunicator generallj' adopts of omitting the pages of\nIntroduction in Roman numerals, I examined page 48 of\nthe book itself. It is in double columns. Line 14, left-\nhand column, in a page of 49 lines, is \"I shall not die,\nbut live.\" The communicator s^joke in this sitting of\nhaving seen Colonel Baddeley [who had died in the pre-\n\f228 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nvi(ju,s Apiil]. I liavc luul Jiuuiy coiivcusiitiuns vvitli him\nabout life after deatli.\nPage 1 of the book j^roper is largely taken up by a\npicture representing; I think, the Judgement. At the\nbottom of the picture, among man}'' other figures, an angel\nis pulling up people out of a ]\"iit. In one person only the\nhead is visible ; in two head and neck. There are short\nlines of print at the side. . . . Within a span of the\ntest-book on the shelf below is Flowers of the Field, by\nJohns. Title outside. The next book but one to the\ntest-book is Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare. The book is\nnot poetry, but on a few pages\u2014including the test page\n\u2014\nthe Shakespearean text is quoted. Page 13 contains a\nverse from Ariel's song from The Tempest. On this\npage, 13, I found the words, \" Nothing now remained to\ncomplete his happiness.\" Tliis point I consider definite\nand accurate.\nTo this note is appended a confirmatory statement as\nfollows :\nI certifj^ that I met the Rev. W. S. Irving on his\nreturn from London on August 11, 1923, and further\naccompanied him to his house.\nThe books Day Honrs of the Church, Lamb's Tales from\nShahesj)eare, and Johns' Flowers of the Field, were found\nas stated by Mr. Irving. The references to the respective\npages in the books are as described by him.\nR. R. Farmer.\nYew House, Newent, Glos.,\nAug. 30, 1923.\nOn receiving Mr. Irving 's record of the above sitting I\nwrote to him saying that it seemed to me an odd coin-\ncidence that Feda should quote the line \" Mary had a\nlamb,\" apparently apropos of Lamb's Tales from Shake-\nspeare, and I thought there might have beeir some attempt\nto refer to the title of the book. Mr. Irving replied as\nfollows :\nOct. 17, 1923.\nIt is indeed a curious coincidence\u2014if it is a coincidence\n\u2014that \" Mary had a lamb \" should lie quoted by Feda in\n\f99] Sittings ivitli Mrs. Leonard. 229\ncuuuL'clion Mitli ljanil)\"\u00ab Tales froiii S\/niLxviiairc. It is,\nhowever, weakened somewliat by tlie fact tliat Feda has,\nI know, once before quoted to me \" Mary had a lamb \"\nin comiection with poetry. On the other hand, since\nsending in the script. I have examined the book again,\nand find that on the cover it says, \" By Charles and Mary\nLamb.\" The word \" Lamb \" is practically obliterated by\nwear and tear. My attention was drawn to the coinci-\ndence by Mr. Dingwall as well as by yourself. I had\nmissed the point. I wonder if the book was chosen\ndeliberately by the communicator knowing that Mary had\na lamb \" was in Feda's mind, and thinking therefore that\nit would be easy to get the title through ? . . .\nW. S. Irving.\nIt is perhaps worth noting that although most of the\npassages quoted in Lamb's Tales are in blank verse, and\ntherefore unrhymed, the particular passage which appears\non p. 13, a verse from Ariel's song, is rhymed. This fact\nseems to have escaped the communicator's notice. Prob-\nably the intention was merely to indicate in a general\nway the nature of the verse with which the book was\nconcerned.\n\u00a7 7. Cowper's Poems.\nExtract from Sitting ivith Mrs. Leonard, November 22, 1923.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Savy.\nFeda. Now, Mr. Bill, she's got another book-test from\nhome. . . . She's going to a place she's taken\nbooks from before at home, not a bedroom, but a\nroom you sit in, like this kind of room. Only, Mr.\nBill, it's much lighter-looldng room altogether.\nMr. Bill, I think it's because the walls is lighter\nthan these ; and do you know the book shelves ?\nAs you come in door, just go 'cross, and they're\nthere. (Feda points straight ahead.) You can walk\nstraight to 'em. You know the shelf you would\ncall the lowest ? Well, she's taking that one, and\nshe's taking the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th, the 5th book from\n\f230 Mrs. W. II. Salter. [part\ntln'. Jt'ft, |iage (iS, ])agc (iS, near the tuji. Uli, what\na funny thing ! JieftTs tu Jiute-takcis ! On the\nlower part of the same i)age describes what she feels\nlike\u2014what Dora feels like\u2014when you find something\nthat's really evidential after a sitting. [Note 1.]\nAnd then she went back on this shelf to the 4th\nbook\u2014that's the next to the one she's been in.\nShe Oldened that right at the beginning, the very\nbeginning ; she found there were such appro-\npriate words applied to the impressions and the\nsense of her presence that you get at home. Mr.\nBill, I must tell you she's trying to make me see\nthis book, see inside of it, and it doesn't seem to\nbe the begiiming of the proper reading, something\nthat comes right at once in the book, before that.\n[Note 2.]\nAnd, Mr. Bill, have you got a Saint's ? Have you\ngot a book about Saints very close to this one,\nbecause I get the idea of Saints from it, and Mrs.\nDora keep saying, \" That's right, that's right. The\nidea of Saints.\" [Note 3.]\nAlso close to the 5th book\u2014the first one she went\nto\u2014there's a book that she feels doesn't belong to\nyou. But it must, or he wouldn't have it there !\nShe says, \" Never mind, say what I say.\" She\nsenses strongly it belongs to some one else, an older\nman than you, some one who's passed over. She\nshows me a letter W in connection with this. She\ntried to write the name and I saw a large W com-\nmencing it. \" The book will give you the clue to\nthat at once,\" she says. Spotted book, s2:)otted\nbook, spotted book. She also felt a book, she's\ngoing to call it a spotted book. She felt it must\nbe a book, when you opened it you found it all\nover spots inside. Like measles ? \" No, no,\" she\nsays, \" I don't know what gives me the idea of\nspots.\" . . . Dora says, \" I can't say I really saw\nthe spots in the book.\" I must go slowly.\n[Note 4.]\n[Another book-test was then given which is omitted\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 231\nhere, as the page does not seem to have been cor-\nrectly indicated].\nNear to where these books are, is there anything left\nlying there looking like bits of coal ?\nW. S. I. Shouldn't think so.\nF. I got to tell you. She kept touching something that\nshe couldn't make out, like bits of something, they\nwere black, looked like small bits of coaL But\nperhaps you'll look there ? See if you can see what\nshe means, and she says, \" That's Avhat they seemed\nto me they were\u2014coal.\" Yes. Mr. Bill, have you\ngot something there that she would feel connected\nwith her sittings ?\n\\V. 8. I. I don't think so.\nF. She sajs, \"Yes, yes.\" She says you've forgotten and\nit's a good thing you have. Directly you get there\nyou'll be reminded of her sittings at once and of\nFeda. You've also got the wrong date, wrong\nnumbers or something there, wrong date. Something\nDora felt as if she wanted to pull down, and take\naway. You have left it there and it docsn t mean\nanything now. Wrong dates. [Note 5.]\nNotes by Mr. Irving.\n1. The room is my drawing-room Avhich is papered ^ith\nlight-coloured paper ; the only book-shelves are to the\nleft front as you enter the room. I very seldom go to\nthis shelf, and had not for a long time, nor had I any\nidea \\^'hat books were on the shelf. The 5th book from\nthe left on the lo-^i-est shelf was Cowper's Poems. I have\nnot read this book. Page 68, second line, I found the\nwords :\n\" prescribes the terms.\"\nThere are 35 lines on this page. Line 20, which is on\nthe lower part, therefore, of the page, is :\n\" The tidings of unpurchased heav'n create.\"\nAnd line 22 contains the words \"all language at a loss.\"\nBoth these sentences would fit the test.\n2. The book was Ki^ig Henry IV. Pari II. Inside the\n\f232 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\ncover I found a Coat of Arms ; and underneat]i, in good-\nsized letters, tlie words :\n\" Non sans droict.\"\n1 am told that \" Not without reason \" is a legitimate\ntranslation. \" Not without right \" would also do.\n3. The second book from the left on this shelf was The\nVisio7i of St. Christopher, by Fryer, and the 3rd book from\nthe left was The Little Floivers of St. Francis of Assisi.\n4. The \" spotted book \" is undoubtedly the 1st book on\nthe left on this shelf. It also proves to be a book that\ndoes not belong to me, but to my father-in-law, Mr. R. W.\nE. Whitehead, and which I did not know was in my\npossession. The book is Nouvelles, hy Alfred de Musset.\nThe covers are mottled and spotted and the inside of the\ncovers, and the first and last sides of the fly-leaves are\nmottled also. Inside the book is written in French a\na short note from my father-in-law to my wife asking her\nto take care of the book for him for a time. It is dated\n30.7.15. The name \" R. W. E. Whitehead\" is also in\nthe book. It has been stamped in. After the la])se of\neight years I cannot tell whether I have seen these things\nbefore or not. I think probably I have, almost certainly.\nMr. Whitehead is still alive.\n5. There were a few very tiny specks of what appear\nto be coal close to the shelves. This is curious, as it is\nlong since I have had a fire in the drawing-room, and the\ngrate is near the door.

The last two points of course\nwere known to me.\nI have included this test mainly on account of the\nknowledge shown concerning the room in which the books\nwere situated, and especially for the reference to the\n\" spotted book.\" The attempts to describe the contents\nof the books seem to me to suffer from the defect to\nwhich I have already referred above (see p. 208 ) ; too\nmuch \" int('r])T('tation is r('f|nircd.\n\fSittings with Mrs. Leonard. 233\n\u00a78. \"Making of Man.\"\nExtract from Sitting loith Mrs. Leonard, A'pril 30, 1924.\nSitter : Rev.

Concerning this book Miss Horsell, the\nAssistant Secretary, notes :\nSir Oliver Lodge's book Making of Man came from the\nPublishers a few days before Easter [April 20]. As it was\naddressed to the Editor, I put it aside on the top of the\ncupboard at the back of my writing-desk, as far as I can\nrecollect. It remained there over the Easter holidays until\nI gave it to Mrs. Salter on Thursday', April 24.\nE. M. Horsell.\nMay 21, 1924.\nMy own recollection is that after Miss Horsell showed\nme the book on April 24, 1924, I left it at the S.P.R.\nRooms, but whether in Miss Newton's room (Miss Newton\nbeing away at the time) or in Miss Horsell's room, I\ncannot say. On April 26, 1924, I wrote to Mr. W.\nWhately Smith about reviewing the book, and on May 6,\n1924, the book was sent to him from the S.P.R. Office.\nThese dates are proved by the post-books. Only one\nother quite new book was received at the S.P.R. Rooms\nat about this time, and to this book very little of what\nwas said at the sittmg applies ;\nonly such general state-\nments as that it refers to \"psychic matters,\" a statement\nwhich would apply to almost every book found at the\nS.P.R. rooms.\nThe passages in Making of Man, to which reference\nseems to be intended, are as follows :\n(Page 33.)\nThe Universe is one : it is not so much a sequence as\na co-existence. What we call \" the next -world \" is co-\nexistent and simultaneous with this.\n(Lower on the same page.)\nWe may not fully understand why we should have had\nto enter into this relation with Matter, an apparently alien\nthing which, as all artists know, has to be coerced to\nrepresent our ideas, and manipulated to display our con-\nceptions. But evidently the episode of earth-life is of\nQ\n\f236 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nimportance ; we can surmise that the difficulties we en-\ncounter in Matter, the troubles caused by our animal-\nancestry, and all the struggle and effort which is here\nnecessarj', even for maintenance, have a training and\ndisciplining effect.\nWith regard to the statement that \" it's an argumenta-\ntive kind of book,\" \" it opens in an argumentative strain,\"\nit may be noted that the preface begins with the words :\n\" The arguments of this book are,\" and the book as a\nwhole may be said to be argumentative in tone. The\nallusion to \" cross-correspondences \" is not very clear, but\nthe reference is apparently to the title-page of the book\nupon which appears Sir Oliver Lodge's name, followed by\na list of his titles, degrees, etc. It is mentioned among\nthese that he is a Corresponding Member of several foreign\nSocieties.\nThe reference to \" corresponding Member \" may possibly\nhave suggested \" cross-correspondences,\" although there is\nof course no allusion to cross-correspondences as they occur\nin scripts. The title-jjage is not actually numbered, the\nprinted numbering begiiming with page 7.\nTo explain the statement that \" one might almost call\nthis book a History. Not an ordinary history, but a\nhistory of people\u2014the things they'd done,\" the following\npage-headings may be quoted from Chaj)ters III. and IV. :\n\" The Coming of Man ; The Rudiments of Life ; The\nRudiments of Sense ; The Rudiments of Mind ;\nPrimitive\nForethought ; The Development of Man ; Creation in\nLiterature ; Science and Poetry ; The Present Condition.\"\nThe following passages arc also taken from these\nchapters :\n(Pp. 79, 80.) The gradual growth, from mere creature\ncomfort, worlving through long periods of development up\nto a higher potentiality, is thus depicted by F. W. H.\nMyers in his poem called \" A Cosmic History,\" in which\nhe rapidly traces the evolution of living creatures from the\ndust of the earth, and then the mysterious incoming of\nMind. . . .\n(Pp. 100, 101.) To reahsc the possibilities latent in\n\f99] Sittings ^oifh Mrs. Leonarrl. 237\nman, we must attend not to the average or the general\nbody of mankind, but to those geniuses of the race wliose\nachievements stand out as signs and symbols, or portents,\nof what the average may in time attain. . . . When one\nvisits a library, one feels overpowered by the industry and\nminute care and labour which has gone to make it what\nit is. Picture galleries, libraries, cathedrals, show what has\nbeen so far accomplished. But beyond and above all that\nindustry we can recall to ourselves higher and more unique\nachievements, in expressing human emotions, in under-\nstanding human character and actions, in penetrating into\nthe secrets of Nature. It must suffice to cite three typical\ninstances\u2014Beethoven, Shakespeare, Newton\u2014and leave the\nrest to thought and imagination. Already the development\nof man has been prodigious.\nThe statement that the book gave the communicator\n\" a strong feeling of some one who's passed over \" pre-\nsumably refers to the fact that it is dedicated \" To\nthe Memory of my Friend F. W. H. Myers and of\nmy Son Raymond, his Pupil, with Gratitude for their\nHelp.\"\nWith regard to the position of the book the communi-\ncator at first says that it was on \" the top of a table \"\n;\nsubsequently she corrects this and says \" it's not in the\nmiddle of the room, it's on a shelf or something against\nthe wall.\"\nThe cupboard on the top of which the book lay until\nApril 24, 1924, as appears from Miss Horsell's statement,\nis against the wall of the room. Where exactly the book\nwas at the time of the sitting on April 30, 1924, cannot\nnow be ascertained, as I have indicated above, but we\nmay take it as established that it remained at the S.P.R.\nRooms until May 6, 1924.\nIt appeared desirable to obtain evidence as to what\nnormal knowledge of the book IV'Irs. Leonard might have\nhad at the time of the sitting, and accordingly Miss\nNewton wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge, on May 21, 1924, to\nask whether he could say whether Mrs. Leonard had a\ncopy of his book, Making of Man, and whether he had\n\f238 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PABT\nhimself given her one. Sir Oliver Lodge replied as\nfollows :\nMay 22, 1924.\nI have no reason to suppose that Mrs. Leonard has seen\nmy book.\nI keejD a list of all those to whom I have sent a co^^\n\u2014over 100\u2014but her name is not on the list.\nI think she occurred to me, and I refrained. If I ask\nher if she has in any way seen it, I know that she will\nanswer truthfully. I will ask her.\nOliver Lodge.\nSubsequently Sir Oliver Lodge sent us Mrs. Leonard's\nreply to his question as follows :\nMay 23 [1924.]\nI have not seen a copy of your latest book Making\nof Man, but heard of it first through a journalist who\nlives next door, and who called and asked me to lend him\na copy. I intended getting one\u2014in order that he might\nread it^ as well as myself\u2014as he is a nice man who is\nspreading knowledge of the subject.\nI should love to have a copy of the book, but am afraid\nit might influence my mind, or rather people would think\nit did, which is almost as bad.\nIt may be best for me not to read it at present, so that\nI can truthfully affirm I have not done so.\nI would rather leave it to you. It is a great tempta-\ntion. Your lecture interested us so much, we feel we\nwant to read Making of Man. Perhaps it is best for\nme to know nothing about anything ! Novels seem to\nbe the only mind-diet approved for me\u2014by the other\nside. . . .\nGladys Leonard.\nThe lecture referred to was a lecture on \" Mind and\nMatter,\" given by Sir Oliver Lodge at the Steinway Hall\non February 6, 1924. It is reported in Light, February\n16 and 23, 1924.\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 239\n\u00a79. \"Infelice.\"\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nTuesday, September 23, 1924.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Dingwall.\nFeda. Don't know how he's going to get that ! Is it in\nLondon? Dora says, \"This is a little bit difficult\nto explain to Feda, but this is a jolace in London,\na room in London, and you could verify these\nthings either to-night, or in the morning, because\nyou'll be in the place where the books are.\" Now\nit's not the Psychical 'Searchers' place, and it isn't\n\u2014you luiow where Mr. George used to be\n\u2014'tisn't\nthere, but she's just going to put it as a place\nyou're going to be in to-night.\nW. S. I. To-night ?\nF. Yes, to-night. So there can't be any mistake about\nit, because you're going to be there to-night. Mr.\nBill, she must get the description of the room right\nhere. You go in at the door, and cross the room\nto the right, not opposite, but to the right. (Feda\nindicates crossing the room, not to a point opposite\nthe door, but to the right front.)\nW. S. I. Little .to the right ?\nF. To the wall opposite the door, but the books are\nslightly on the right. Dora was a little puzzled as\nto these books being on ordinary shelves\u2014some\nirregularity about them. An arrangement of them\nmade her feel she must measure, instead of trying\nto find the shelf. She says, \" I should judge it to\nbe about 4 feet from the floor,\" and she says she\nthinks she's probably right, 'cos, she says, \" I was\nrather good at guessing little things like that when\nI was here.\" Look ! 'Bout that was what she\nfelt, and she thinks that 'bout 4 foots. (Feda in-\ndicates height on the screen behind Mrs. Leonard.\nWe measured later and found that the place indi-\ncated was 48| inches from the floor.) She says,\n\" On a Line with bottom of this thing, so look after,\nthe top one here, just underneath him.\" She says\n\f240 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nshe guesses that to be 'bout 4 feets. \" Now you\ntake the books as usual from left to right,\" she\nsays, and she took the fifth. As she opened the\nbook, the very beginning, she had the feeling it\nmust be a Bible. Then she discovered it wasn't,\nbut that certain words, and the names given, were\nwell-known Biblical ones, and that you could dis-\ncover them at tlie very beginning of the book, and\neven before you began the actual reading matter.\nThen, she said, look at page eleven, and you will\nsee a description of evening, things one does in the\nevening, things that hapjien at night. Got a strong\nimj^ression of night from this page. Thought she\nsaw the word \" soft \" on the lower part of the page.\nShe felt a very peaceful condition from it, as of\nAvords suggesting peace, and^\u2014wait a minute\u2014she\nturned over the l>age, and looking down the next\npage she came across a verj^ good description of a\npicture that you got at home, Mr. Bill, a picture\nyou're fond of too, you're fond of. She says, \"Not\na new picture, one you've had a good long time,\nbut the important part of that book-test.\"\nW. S. I. Did you say \" That is \" ?\nF. \"That is.\" Now do you think you've got that clear?\nW. S. I. I shall be in one room rather like that, but not quite,\nand one I might go to that is like it ; which is it ?\nP. The one you might, but you are going to. As if she's\npushing you. You're almost as bound to go as you\nare to tlie other room. I think Dora exj^ects you to\ngo there, Mr. Bill. Yes, she is, Mr. Bill. You\nmust go.\nW. S. I. Right, I'll go.\nF. Then Dora says, \" Funny thing, it's not good enough\nto get it out of the other one.\"\nW. S. I. That quite answers that.\nF. \" Now, she says, you've got all I said about the fifth\nbook, page eleven, about '\npeace '\nand so on, turn\nover page and then the description of the picture at\nhome.\" [Notes 1 and 2.]\nNow, Mr. Bill, on this same line of boolvs, but a little\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 241\nmore to the right than the books she's told you\nabout, she kept being reminded of some one.\nShe says, \" Some one I have spoken to you about\nbefore, a Canon, Canon.\" She doesn't mean a gun,\nshe means a gentleman. It's some one she spoke to\nyou about quite a long time ago, she says, and she\nfelt strongly that his name, or reference to Canon,\nwas on the outside of a book just there. She says\ndo you remember the man she means ?\nW. S. I. Yes.\nF. - Because there's something else about him as ^^\u2022ell, do\nyou see ? Take the seventh book from the left, the\nnext but one to the one you had before, and, she\nsays, look at page thirty-seven, thirty-seven\u2014you've\ngiven that page several times before\u2014she seems\nrather fond of sevens !\n\" On that page thirty-seven,\nyou'll find a slight description, not a long descrip-\ntion, a short description, of the circumstances con-\nnected with that man which I tried to speak to\nyou of some time ago, and which I had been rather\nworried about.\" She says, \"Do you remember that\nmy test then was spoilt ? \" She says, \" You\nunderstand, don't you, to whom I am referring ?\n\"\nGet it clear.\nW. S. I. The Canon.\nF. Yes. She says, \" Get it quite clear, and ask her if\nyou're not clear. Be sure and ask her. It's a\nclear reference to circumstances that I helped you\nwith some time ago in connection with him.\"\nW. S. I. I remember all that.\nF. \"Now a book towards the left again\u2014going back to\nthe left\u2014the title might be applied in a compli-\nmentary sense to my evidence, and please don't\nthink I'm conceited about it.\"\nW. S. I. Oh no.\nF. She says, \" I've got to say that, it's part of the test.\"\nShe says, have you got it down exactly as\nshe said it? About \"conceited\"? \"Because you\nwould when you see what the word is,\" she says.\n[Note 3.]\n\f242 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nWill you enquire if a ladder's been desired for that\nroom, or if a ladder's been in it lately 1\nW. S. I. Desired or been in it ?\nF. Desired and been in it. \"I got the thought of a\nladder so strongly in that room.\" [Note 4.]\nDamp, damp, been something wet or damp in this\nroom, which she could feel, as though she wanted\nto dry something up. Got that ?\nW. S. I. Yes.\nF. Wet or damp. [Note 5.]\nAnd also Dora says, \" You know that I hate dead\ninsects.\" She didn't lilie insects when she was here.\nNobody does in this country ! She hopes they've\nleft him there. There was a large dead insect close\nto the books, and she has an idea it will still be\nthere. \" His presence wouldn't be evidential,\" she\nsays, \"if it were not near the books\u2014but it is.\"\n[Note 6.]\nCheese, cheese. I don't know what you mean\n!\nCheese, cheese. Wait a minute ! Is cheese to do\nwith this same thing ? Cheese. Dora says, \" I got\nsuch a peculiar feeling in this room of cheese.\"\nShe says, \" You know I've got to give these absurd\nthoughts.\" She says, \" I looked all round and\ncouldn't see what it was, but I got the feeling\ncheese, cheese.\" Do you know, Mi\\ Bill, she says\nwhen she's seen or felt a silly thing like that before,\nshe's generally been right. [Note 7.]\nWould you look round too and see if there's a picture\nof a crown in the room ? She says, \" I kept feeling\nand visualising a rather magnificent crown.\" She\nsays. \" I wonder if I'm right using that word '\nmag-\nnificent.' The idea I got\u2014something very important,\na very imj^ortant crown, not just a ducal one, but\nsome very important crown.\" Is that right ? Yes.\n[Note 8.]\nHidden poetry. She felt strongly that there was some\npoetry in this room, but as if hidden away\u2014prob-\nably put into a box or drawer, in the room. She\nsays, \" I could sense poetry in the room, but I\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 243\ncouldn't see it anjrwhere. I know it's covered up\nin the room\u2014shut up in something\u2014and I felt that\nit was closed up in something dark. Not a light\ncover, but a dark.\nW. S. I. Colour ?\nF. Cover. [Note 9.]\nOh, typed. Paper with typing on in this room.\nWait a minute ! Paper with typing on in this\nroom, or else, she says, print that was made to\nlook like ty}3ing. [Note 10.]\nAnd she says, \" Feathers, feathers.\" Wait a minute,\nplease ! She says, \" I felt feathers, as if there was\na bunch of feathers, not one feather only, but some-\nthing like a group or bunch of feathers.\" None of\nthese wiU be in your mind, Mr. Bill. She's pur-\nposely felt the things that would not be in your\nmind. Dora's very clever at sort of missing those\nthings. [Note 11.]\nW. S. I. She's very clever generally.\nF. Yes, she says, she knows. And what ? Wait a\nmirmte then ! Now, Mr. Bill, that's all for that\nroom, but she's got some more tests she's going to\ngive you before she goes home. . . . She says she\nalways listen to what Peda call you. You know,\nFeda call you Bill. She more polite. She say\nWill. Well, this name \"Bill\" she's going to present\nto you in large letters to-night.\nVV. S. I. Something new, sounds bad, in a way.\nF. She's going to put the word\u2014she knows she can\u2014in\ngreat big letters just in front of you, in such a\nway that you can't avoid seeing it, nor can you\nmistake it.\nW. S. I. I like that sort of thing.\nF. \"So,\" she says, \"you needn't go looking for it. It'll\nbe just there in front of you, very large.\" She\nsays, \" Very large.\"\nNow, be careful over this ! She says, \" As you're look-\ning at that, you'll be also surrounded with something\nto do with politics. 'Least you'll have been think-\ning of them a second before\u2014such a little while\n\f244 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nbefore, so the idea of politics is to be considered as\nwell as the fact of the name being there.\" Now,\nshe says, she\"s not sure if you'll have had to discuss\nit, or read about it, but she knows the idea of\npolitics will be very much mixed up with the name.\nShe says, \" This working along the line of associa-\ntion interests me very much,\" she says. Wait a\nminute ! [Note 12.]\nOh ! Short of vegetables ! Short of vegetables ! Wait\na bit ! Mr. Bill, can you remember saying just\nlately about being short of vegetables ?\nW. S. I. Yes, I said some one was.\nF. Dora didn't know what you referred to, but she heard\nyou say \"short of vegetables.\" The reason for\nmentioning that is that you'll be reminded to night\nabout the same thing. It'll make you say it again,\n\" Oh, short of vegetables.\" Perhaps he'd better buy\nsome and make sure ! No, Dora says, that would spoil\nit. No, you couldn't take any with you, Mr. Bill. She\nsays you'll know exactly what she means. [Note 13.]\nMr. Bill, she says such a peculiar thing. It's because\nof something you were thinking of, she saying it.\nShe says, \" Of course babies who are not born have\nsouls, babies who don't live properly.\" But, Mi\".\nBill, she's saying that rather specially. It's some-\nthing you were thinking of a little while ago.\nW. S. I. Yes, I remember.\nF. She thinks you would. She says, \" They do.\" Wait\na minute, Dora, please. . . . [Note 14.]\nExtracts from the D. G. I. Control, which followed.\nD. G. I. There's another thing I wanted you to remember\n\u2014\nabout seeing some old friends who reminded you of\nme. I Avanted you to know I was there. I wanted\nyou to remember that, Will.\nW. S. I. Is that the jAixce where tlie book-test is ?\nD. G. I. Yes.\nW. S. I. I thought it was.\nD. G. I. You shouldn't have mentioned it. PeojDle I like, you\nknow.\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 245\nWill, not at the present moment, but I felt that one\nof these was ill a little while ago. Not so much\nnow, Will. I'm not asking this, I'm only putting\nit in the form of a question\u2014did they ask you, or\ntell you, about a friend of theirs that passed over\nlately ? Oh no, you might hear that now. Some\none they're very interested in.\nW. S. I. Thej' didn't tell me anything.\nD. G. I. A man. Will, you'd better ask. I think it's only\njust occurred. It will be most interesting if it's\noccurred and they haven't heard yet. Will, you'd\nbetter tell them, I think, because it'll make them\nlook out for it more.\nW. S. I. Is it a very close relation ?\nI can't tell. I only get the thought, the vibration,\nthat some one has passed over quite recently, a\nman. When I'm a^\\'ay from here, I shall probably\nknow everything. [Note 15.]\nNotes by Mr. Irving.\n1. In order that the identity of Y. (pseudonym) may\nnot be discovered, I have been obliged to disguise certain\ndetails in my notes on these tests from his house. Full\nnames and facts have been given to the Secretary of the\nS.P.R. Ml'. Y. is the son of some old friends of mine\nwho live in a parish in which I used to be interested.\nMr. Y. is now married and lives in town. In recent\nyears I had met him but seldom, and at the time of the\nsitting knew nothing of his business or occupation. I had\nvisited his house for the first time and dined with him\nand his wife on the Sunday immediately before the sitting,\nand after dinner we had talked on psychical matters. I\ntold him some of my experiences in research, and said that\nit would be interesting if my communicator would give me\na book-test, or other tests, from his house. My wife\nhad known him in Life fairly well. Mr. Y. at once\nsuggested that should I get any tests of that nature, I\nshould come round straight to his house after the sitting,\nand take \" pot-luck \" at dinner. I did not of course\nexamine his books, and neither in the book-test just\n\f246 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\ndescribed, nor in the impression tests that follow, does\nthere seem to be any material that could have been known\nto me, save in the case of the one or two minor points\nthat are noted.\n2. Feda's description of the room left me at first in\ndoubt as to which of two rooms was intended, my bed-\nroom at my London rooms, where there is a book-shelf\nopposite the door, or the drawing-room at Mr. Y.'s house.\nThe answer to my question as to whether I must, or\nmight, go to the room that night settled this point. There\nare in ]VIi-. Y.'s drawing-room two sets of book-shelves, one\nopjiosite the door, the other to the right front as you go\nin. The latter are indicated. They do not start from the\nfloor, but are over a bureau and have glass doors. The\nshelf which approximates most nearly to the description is\nthe second shelf up. Its height from the floor is 50 inches.\nThe fifth book from the left was Infelice, by A. J. Evans\nWilson, Nesbit and Co., Ltd. On the title-page I found\nthe names Tiberius, James and St. Elmo, and the words\n\"The Grace of God.\" On the first page of the reading\nmatter, numbered, however, page 7, \" Hannah.\" On the\npages numbered 17 and 18, Cyrus and Solomon. On page\n8 was the Biblical quotation \" sounding brass or tinlding\ncymbals,\" also I found the words \" to baptise \" on the\nsame page. On the page numbered 11 I found nothing\nas described, but counting the pages from the beginning\nof the printed matter (a method my communicator seems\nto adopt at times) we come to page 9 as the eleventh\npage. Here I found a description of certain \" things that\nhappen at night\" as follows: \"The glare of the fire, and\nthe mellow glow of the student's lamp fell full on the\npale features.\" On line 26 of this page of 48 lines, not\ncounting the heading\u2014that is, rather more than half-way\ndown the page\u2014Avas the word \" soft.\" On page 8, which\ntouches page 9, when closed, were further references to\nevening and night. \" Good-night, Miss Elise.\" \" It was\na tempestuous night in the latter part of January. . . .\nAs the night wore on, the wind increased in violence . . .\ntlie hands of the china clock on the dining-room mantel-\npiece pointed to nine.\" On the bottom line of the page\ni\n\fSittings with Mrs. Leonard. 247\nnumbered nine were the words \" your words of benedic-\ntion.\" Turning over the page, I found on the sixteenth\nline of the page numbered ten, the word \" violets.\" I\nhave in my drawing-room at home a good-sized framed\npainting of a mass of violets, mingled with forget-me-nots\nand maiden-hair fern, in the form of a horse-shoe. This\npainting my wife and I bought and framed ourselves, some\n25 years ago, when buying things for our first furnishing.\nI am very fond of it, not only for association's sake, but\nalso because it is a beautiful piece of water-colour work.\nConfirmatory Note by Miss Newton.\nI have verified the above allusions in Mrs. Y.'s copy of\nInfelice.\nThe incidents related in the first chapter, which occupies\npp. 7-16, take place in a parsonage on a wild and stormy\nevening. A bright fire is being kept up and the \" pas-\ntor's \" supper kept warm. When the pastor returns, he\nis informed that a stranger is waiting to see him in the\nlibrary. \" Before you go in,\" said his sister, \"let me give\nyou your supper, for you must be tired and hungry.\"\nBut the pastor says he must first see the visitor, whose\nerrand may be urgent. She is a woman with a \" sweet\nthough tremulous voice \" and \" large soft brown eyes.\"\nAfter rather an excited and stormy interview on her part\nshe refers to the parsonage as \" this sanctuary of peace.\"\nI. Newton.\nNotes by Mr. Irving {continued).\n3. More than one Canon has been spoken about in my\nvarious sittings, but I recognised the \" Canon \" meant here\nby the sentence about \" a test then \" having been \" spoilt.\"\nThis particular Canon was Vicar of the parish where Mr.\nY. lived some years ago. The sentence \" on this same\nline of books \" is unusual. I found no mention of this\nCanon's name on the outside of any book to the right on\nthis shelf, so tried the shelf below. On the shelf below\nand one and a half feet to the right was a pile of books\nplaced horizontally on the shelf. The top one, which was\nonly one and a half inches below the shelf above, and\n\f248 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nforty-eight and a half inches from the floor\u2014the height\noriginally given through Feda\u2014was an album containing\nnewspaper cuttings which had been pasted in. On pages\nthree and seven Canon is mentioned by name, his\nactual surname being given after the word Canon. It is\nnot a common name. On page eleven I found his photo-\ngraph among a group of people. In another album\nimmediately below the first, on the second page, were\nphotographs of the interior and exterior of his church. . . .\nA book towards the left was \" Good Words.\" It was\non the test shelf.\nMr. Irving then goes on to discuss the reference given\nat the sitting to the seventh book from the left in the\noriginal shelf. In regard to this reference there seems to\nhave been some confusion and the details are not given\nhere.\nNotes by Mr. Irving {continued).\n4. I went direct to Mr. Y.'s house immediately after the\nsitting, only stopping for tea en route, and verified these\ntests. Mr. Y, said that about a week before this he had\nfound that the lamp hanging from the ceiling wanted\ncleaning, so went and fetched the steps. Also about five\nweeks before ladders were being used in this room, the\ndrawing-room, by men white-washing the ceiling.\n5. On Monday, September 15, a water-bottle had been\nupset on the bed in the room above and everything was\nsoalced and had to be aired.\n6. We could find no dead insect in the drawing-room\nnear the books. On Sunday, September 21, Mrs. Y. tells\nme that she thought she saw a spider in the dining-room\ncupboard, but left it, as she is frightened of them.\n7. Mrs. Y. had got some frightfully strong cheese, and\nhad been talking about it every day, she tells me. On\nthe day of my sitting she had bought some milder.\n8. A good-sized vase in the room of old Worcester\nparrot china has a crown on its base. The only other\ncrowns we could find were on the buttons of Mr. Y.'s\nuniform in a photograph.\n9. Mr. Y. had hidden some poetry of his own in a\n\fSittings with Mrs. Leonard. 249\ndark-covered book behind the left-hand bookcase border.\nThe border projects, so that the book was out of sight.\nAlso there was some poetry written by Mr. and Mrs. Y.\ntogether in a bright red-covered book in a sliding drawer\nin a desk in this room. I had no idea myself that they\never wrote poetry.\n10. On my asking about this Mr. Y. first handed to me\na book called A Practical Course of Touch Type-writing\n,\nby C. E. Snaith, and then put before me a bundle of bills\nfor decorating and furnishing which were tj-ped. By\nshowing me the latter he fulfilled, it would seem, a pre-\ndiction given later in the sitting (see above p. 243 and\nnote 12 below). I knew that expensive decorations had\nbeen done recently.\n11. Mr. Y. went straight to the bureau under the right-\nhand bookcase, and brought out a large bunch of feathers.\n12. During dinner at the Y.'s, and before verifying most\nof these tests, Mr. Y. remarked to me that the crush in\nthe Tube had been great that night when he returned from\nwork. This gave me the opportunity to ask what he\nwas doing now, and where working. He replied, \"In a\nParliamentary Office at Westminster.\" The subject of\npolitics was thus introduced. It must have been half an\nhour later, however, before the bills were put before me\nas described above.\n13. In verifying these tests I missed this one, and it\nwas not till I got back to my roonas that night and went\nagain through my notes that I found it. About three\nweeks before the sitting a neighbouring vicar had come to\nlunch with me at my vicarage, and my housekeeper had\nprovided three or four different kinds of vegetables. My\nfriend had remarked that he wished he had vegetables\nlike that, but the fowls destroyed his. This I told my\nhousekeeper and she gave him a vegetable-marrow to take\nhome. At dinner at the Y.'s that night the only vege-\ntable had been potatoes. At dinner there on the Sunday\nbefore there was also celerj''.\n14. On Sunday, September 21, at dinner we had talked\nabout various theories with regard to the soul, transmigra-\ntion, absorption, etc. Mrs. Y. had asked me if I thought\n\f250 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nthat babies who die after birth and before baptism go to\nHeaven. Mr. Y. had remarked, \" My wife's very keen on\na brand-new soul for ever}^ baby that's born into the\nworld.\"\n15. Mrs. Y. had been taken ill in June and had had to\ngo away early in August. I believe though that this had\nbeen spoken about on the Sunday before the sitting.\nOn my enquiring about the \" friend \" said to have\n\" passed over,\" Mr. Y. told me that on September 20 he\nhad been shocked to hear that his cousin's wife's father\nhad been killed in a motor accident. He had read this\nin the paper. He can scarcely be called a \" friend,\" but\nthe occurrence impressed Mr. Y. strongly because of its\nsuddenness. ^ -r\nW. S. Irving.\nCorroborative Statement by Mr. Y.\nI certify tliat the Notes to the above test are correct,\nand that I was present when the test was verified.\n(Signed) [E. Y.].\nIn spite of some confusion and inaccuracy here and\nthere the above record, taken as a whole, affords striking\nevidence of apparently supernormal knowledge. The fact\nthat Mr. Irving had dined with Mr. and Mrs. Y. at their\nhouse a few days before the sitting may have established\na necessary link, but, as Mr. Irving himself points out, a\nconsiderable part of the knowledge shown cannot have been\nderived from his mind.\nIt is unfortunate that in regard to the most precise\npoint given in the book-test described above, the reference\nto things done in the evening and the occurrence of the\nword \" soft,\" there should be some doubt as to how the\npages are to be counted. This is a constantly recurring\ndifficulty in book-tests, as readers of Mrs. Sidgwick's paper\nwill remember. If, as communicators allege, the tests are\ncarried out by \" weighing up \" the pages, and not by\nreading the actual printed number, the difficulty seems\nunsurmountable.\nIt is of interest to note that at this same sitting on\nSeptember 23, 1924, another successful book-test was\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 251\ngiven, (from another house) in which there was again a\nverified reference to a particular word. It is a fact,\nwhich many sitters with Mrs. Leonard and other mediums\nhave doubtless observed, that good evidence tends to be\nconcentrated in particular sittings ; in other words a\n\" good \" sitting is likely to be good throughout and a\nconfused sitting confused throughout.\nFurther Extract from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, September 23, 1924.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Dingwall.\nFeda. Now then, she's going home now. She doesn't like\nto leave you without going home at all, \" gives\nyou something to do, when you get back,\" she says.\nWait a minute ! Now, ]\\'Ir. BUI, she's not going to\nher old place. You know two or three times\nrunning lately she's gone to one place. She's going\nto another room. Wait a minute ! Have to be\nrather careful. You have mentioned this room\nbefore though. Wait a minute ! How are you\ngoing to get that ? Rather large chest of drawers\nin it ? She's going to another room, and she was\nlooking round to show me something about it, and\nshe says, \" Large chest of drawers.\"\nW. .S. I. I know the place.\nF. Wait a minute ! Now what does that mean ? Mr.\nBUI, do you understand if there are some books\nnear the chest of drawers ? For she keeps on about\nthe chest of drawers. Mr. Bill, she is movmg her\nhand rather high. I feel like higher than the chest\nof drawers itself, not in the drawers. You'll have\nto count from the left, take the first book you\ncome to on the left. The begimiing of this book\nshe got the idea of spring-time. Very clearly and\ndistinctly, as if the word had j)opped out at her.\nNow, wait a minute, please, Dora. She then went\nto page one, figure 0\u2014ten. That's a nice number to be\nsure it's right, for you can't get 0, one, but you\ncan get one, 0. Just near the top of the page\ncertain words could refer to marrying again. At\nthe bottom of the same page\u2014then she stopped\n\f252 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nand said, \" You can pnt down re-marrying if you\nlike, but I like the words better marrying again,\nit seemed to fit in.\" At the bottom of the same\npage there's a little message, just a few words, that\nDora doesn't want to say much about, but that\nyou will take as a personal message, something she\nwould like to say to you. Not a very evidential\none, but it fits in with the time of the year. Have\nI got that right, Dora ? It fits in with the time\nof the year, she says.\nW. S. J. Yes, I understand.\nF. And in this same book, 46, on page 46, there's a\nwhat ? There's a further reference to the same\nthing, only in a more evidential way. Wait a\nminute ! It specifies\u2014that's right\u2014it specifies a\nreason for her wanting to send you a personal\nmessage just now.\nW. a. I. The reason ?\nF. A reason. Not your words, Dora. You wouldn't\nsay 'em like that. Dora says just now, Mr. Bill, is\nrather important time of the year. It's an anni-\nversary, well, it's a double one, isn't it ? she says.\nShe looks at you and says, \" Will, it's a double\none.\" \" Now, she says, Will, you heard what I\nsaid, it's a double one.\" She said, \" I had to get\nthat in puriDOsely.\" Wait till he's jiut that down,\nDora. Because on the outside of a book there\n\u2014\nclose to the one she was quoting from is a book\nwhose title conveys her meaning exactly, about a\ndouble one ;\nrepeating her words a little differently,\nbut the same sense exactly.\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nI verified this test by myself, without a witness, because\nI gathered from the script that it was intended to be a\n\" personal \" rather than an \" evidential \" book-test, and\nit is extremely diflicult to get books witnessed properly\nhere without causing local talli. I find that the test is\nevidentially strong, however, and that there is no reason\nwhy I should not make it public, I have therefore sent\ni\n\fSittings with Mrs. Leonard. 253\nthe book to the S.P.R. Secretary to examine, and have\ncertified that the book \" The Shakspere Birthday-Book\n\"\nwas found by me in the position described. The book\nI recognised from the descrii^tion given througli Feda as\nhaving been taken from a row of books on the top of a\nchest of drawers in my bedroom at home. No boolv-test\nhas been given before from this room, but the room has\nbeen described. In the middle of the chest of drawers\nis a work-basket of my Avife's. To the right of the work-\nbasket is a short row of five books, to the left a row of\nseven books. The first book counting from the left iii\nthe left-hand section was \"The Shakspere Birthday-Book.\"\"\nI have never read the book, but at times have glanced\ninto it. It belonged to my wife, as did nearly aU the\nbooks in this room. It is not however the Birthday-book\nin which my wife entered the dates of her friends' birth-\ndays. That book is next to it on the right, and is called\n\" Children's Birthday-Book.\" At the beginnmg of the\n\" Shakspere Birthday-Book \" on the first page of the Preface,\nwhich is numbered 5, I found near the bottom of the page.\nFaster than Spring-time showers\nComes thought on thought.\nAnd not a thought but thinks on dignity.\nOn page 10 the fifth and sixth lines from the top,\ncounting the heading,\n0 Time, thou must untangle this, not I\n;\nIt is too hard a knot for me to untie.\nAt the bottom of the page\u2014save for the last two lines\n\u2014\nis the following which I take to be the personal message :\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men.\nWhich taken at the flood leads on to fortune.\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\nIs bound in shallows, and in miseries ;\nWe must take the current as it serves,\nOr lose our ventures.\nOn page 46 I found the lines :\nSo part we sadly in this troublous world.\nTo meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.\n\f254 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nMy mother died on September 29, 1912, and my wife\non October 25, 1918\u2014hence the words \" It fits in with\nthe time of the year,\" and \" It's an anniversary. . . .\nIt's a double one,\" in the script. The phrase \" sweet\nJerusalem \" is not one my wife would have used when on\nearth. I take the first j^ersonal message to be one to\n]3ersevere in psychical research while I have the oppor-\ntunity. The second joersonal message is obvious.\nThe book, the title of which is said to convey the com-\nmunicator's meaning exactly \" about a double one,\" must,\nI think, be the \" Children's Birthday-Book.\" Death is at\ntimes spoken of by communicators as birth into new\nlife.\nThe reference to ca personal message to be found at the\nbottom of the tentli page docs not seem to me a strong\npoint ; the verification is too indefinite ; the statement\nmade at the sitting suggests a message more immediately\npersonal to Mr. Irving than an allusion to the importance\nof persevering in his psycliical researches.\nNor does the point concerning the title of a book wliicli\nis to refer to the communicator's statement about \" a\ndouble one \" seem to me satisfactory. I should myself\nhave expected from the statement made at the sitting\nsome allusion to I'epetition, or at least to \" doubleness\n\"\nin some form. It has occurred to me that the com-\nmunicator may have been trying to refer to the fact that\nthere were two Birthday Books in the shelf, the one from\nwhich the tests were taken and the \" Children's Birthday-\nBook \" standing next to it.\nThe quotation found near the top of page 10 contains\nwords which might clearly refer to marriage, or to the\nbreaking of the marriage bond ; the idea of re-marriage\nis not clearly expressed. The other points in the test,\nas Mr. Irving says, are definite. Both Miss Newton and\nI have seen the \" Shakspere BLrthday-Book \" and verified\nMr. Irving's statements concerning its contents.\nBelow are two instances taken from Mr. Irving's sittings\nin which an actual word given by the communicator was\nfound at the place apparently indicated.\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 255\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, November 20, 1924.\nSitter : Mr. Irving.

On the seventh lino of page 27 were the\nwords \" a good cook.\"\n\u00a7 10. CoNCEENiNG Canon PARKER ^ AND Leckhampton.\nI have classified the following incident book-test,\nbecause it falls under the general head of suggesting super-\nnormal knowledge concerning printed matter. It more\nclosely resembles some of the \" newspaper tests \" which\nIVIr. Drayton Thomas has reported, both in his book and\nin an article printed in the S.P.R. Journal (Vol. XX. p. 89).\nThe present case is unfortunately of a kind which it is\nnot easy to describe clearly without being long-winded,\nbecause such parts of the statement as are veridical are\n' Pseudonym.\n\f256 Mrs. W.

She says I must go steadily\nhere. Just lately, quite latelj^ a man has passed\nover that Dora has been able to hel]), and he's\npassed over since your last sitting here ; no one\nshe spoke of then, no, no, no ! That's why she\nwants you to go careful. The man had not passed\nover then. She wants me to be very careful,\nbecause it's a test. You have not seen this man\nfor some time, Mr. Bill. He belongs to your earlier\nlife, and you knew him better than Dora did. You\nwere not living where you are no^v when you knew\nhim, and he would be older than you, considerably\nolder. Oh, wait a minute. I don't feel that he\nbelonged to that part of the world where you come\nfrom at all, not now.\nW. S. I. I've got that.\nF. I get a letter C with him, C, and at one time he\nused to talk to you a lot and sort of advise you.\nYou and he wouldn't always agree, you'd see things\ndifferently. You would like be naturally inchned to\ndisagree with him, but I don't think you did. Why\ndidn't he ? Was he frightened of him ? His\nposition and age made it almost impossible for you\nto stand up and disagree with him. He was a tall\nman, large, rather bony frame, dark, but even then\ndark turning grey. I get a name like Black,\nBlaben, Blacken. I have to give it to you as\nbeing Black, Blackburn. Feel he had a lot to\ndo with that name, don't laiow if to do with\na person or place ; and the name beginning Cross,\nCrossley, I'm not quite sure of this, but it\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 257\nsounded like Crossley, is liaised up with it too.\nThat name seems to be important, Mr. Bill. Cross,\nCrossley, Crus, Crosslan. Dora says, \" This man has\nonly passed over quite, quite lately. You might\nnot even have heard of it yet. Don't try and\nguess.\" She always try to find out things you\ndon't know. Yes, tell me ? Oh ! This man was\nthe cause or part of the cause of a disappointment\nto you, a set-back to you. Have you got all that\ndown ?\nW. S. 1. Yes.\nF. She doesn't suppose you'll know much about it until\nyou hear about the man, then it'll bring it all back.\nLimiton. There's another name bcgiiming with an\nL that's also connected with it. Not an ordinary\nname like Lizzie, It's like Limiton. Just keep\nthat just as she's given it. Don't worry about it\n\u2022 at all.\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nIn spite of various incorrect statements I recognised the\nabove as a description of a former Vicar of mine, Canon\n{Parker'], Curate-in-Charge of Lccldiampton, with whom I\nworked from 1909-1912. He is not tall, but short, and\nwiry and energetic. Canon {Parker] has now retired and\nlives in Devonshii'e.\nW. S. Irving.\nSubsequently at Mr. Irving's request Miss Newton\nadded to this note the following confirmatory statement :\nFeb. 1, 1923.\nWhen Mr. Irving read the notes of his recent sittings\nto me on Friday, January 26, 1923, he told me that\ncertain allusions and descriptions applied, he felt sure, to\nCanon [Parker] of Leckhampton, and that he understood\nfrom what Feda said that he would soon hear of Canon\n[Parker s] death. My recollection is that Mr. Irving told\nme that he had not heard of Canon [Parker] for some\ntime and knew nothing of his present conditions.\n.1. Newton.\n\f258 WIrs. W. H. Salter.

One has to be\ndefinite sometimes to get the thing straight. None\nof it was imj^ortant, but it was evidential.\n(About a quarter of an hour dealing with other\nmatters.)\nD. G. I. Do you remember another place where there were two\ncorners and at one there was an hotel and a post\noffice, and a place they sold fruit and vegetables,\nclose together bet^^'een the two streets ; and I used\nto go there a good deal at one time 1 To the side\nof it there was a blank place, waste ground, and a\nsort of Orphanage, Home or Institute close there\ntoo. You'll be going there soon again. Don't for-\nget, to the side there's all waste ground.\nVV. S. I. Where we lived ?\nD. G. 1. Yes, I went many many times down that particular\nbit of road.\nW. S. I.

I notice things more than you do.\nIt may be well at this point to sum up briefly what\nthe statements quoted above appear to indicate. At the\nsitting of January 23, 1923, it is stated that a man,\nidentified by Mx. Irving as Canon Parker, has quite lately\ndied. In connection with him the letter C is given, the\n\f260 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nnames Black or Blackburn and Crossley, and another name\nbeginning with L, which is said to sound like Limiton.\nThe letter C may be accounted for as a reference to\nCheltenham, Canon Parker having been at the time of his\nassociation with Mr. Irving Curate-m-Charge of Leckhamp-\nton, which is a district of Cheltenham. Limiton is prob-\nably a first attempt at Leckhampton, which emerges more\nclearly at the next sitting. The names Black or Black-\nburn and Crossley had no meanmg for Mr. Irving in\nconnection with Canon Parker.\nAt the next sitting on January 25, 1923, the communi-\ncator passes from an attempt to give some name by which\nshe herself was called to attempts at two names beginning\nwith L, one of which is said to be \"a bit longer than the\nother.\" There can be little doubt, I think, that one of\nthe two names at which the communicator is aiming is\nLeckhampton, at which, as I have suggested, a previous\nattempt had been made on January 23. The first syllable\nLeek is given repeatedly and with emphasis, and Feda gets\nas near to the sound of the whole word as \" Leckton\n\"\nand \" Leckan.\" With regard to this name it is said that\nthe matter is \" not finished with yet,\" something further\nis to hapjien which will be of interest in this connection,\nand the communicator will try to help. It is worth\nnoting that in the course of her apparent attemj)ts at\nLeckhampton Feda wrote the name \" Lacey \" and after it\nthe words better Feda,\" which seem to indicate that\nLacey is a \" good shot.\" Moreover, she states almost\nimmediately afterwards \" she's got it down once,\" which\nseems to imply that one of the names written is correct.\nBut Lacey bears little resemblance to Leckhampton, be-\nyond the fact that both begin with an L. This point is of\nsome interest in view of the sequel. What this sequel was\nis indicated in a note written by Mr. Irving as follows :\nOn Saturday afternoon, Jan. 27, 1923, before leaving\nPaddington by the 3.15 ]3.m. train, I bought at the book-\nstall on the departure platform the Daily Mail, a Magazine,\nand The Guardian to read on the journey. At home I\ntake in The Church Tivies only of the weekly church\npapers, but on my return journeys from town I sometimes\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 261\nbuy The Guardian instead, as my copy of The Church\nTimes is awaiting me when I get back. The last time\nbefore this when I may have done so would be Nov. 18,\n1922. I had not bought The Guardian since nor had I\nseen one so far as I know. I at once looked to see if\nthe name of our old friend and vicar. Canon [Parker] was\nin the Obituary Column. It was not. On reading through\nthe paper I came to a letter by Canon [Parker] on the\nsubject of the New Lectionary.\n^ ^ Irving\nIn the light of this subsequent development Mr. Irving\nconcluded that what the communicator was endeavouring\nto say at the sittings of January 23 and 25 was that\nCanon Parker, with whom he had for some time been\nquite out of touch, would very shortly be brought to his\nnotice, as ho in fact was by the letter in The Guardian,\nthe statement that Canon Parker was dead being a mis-\ntake on the part of Feda. Mr. Irving suggests that the\nrepeated references to a name beginning with the syllable\nLeek cover attemjjts to allude not only to Leckhampton\nbut also to Lectionary, the subject of Canon Parker's\nletter in The Guardian. Mr. Irving may be right on this\npoint, but it is one which must remain conjectural. It is\nrather against his theory that one of the few indications\ngiven in regard to these two names is that one is \"a bit\nlonger than the other.\" Of the names Leckhampton and\nLectionary neither has any marked advantage, the first\nhaving eleven letters and three syllables, the second four\nsyllables but only ten letters.\nOn the other hand, a closer examination of the contents\nof The Guardian of January 26, 1923, the number contain-\ning Canon Parker's letter, does suggest that it is from this\nsource that some light on the statements made at the\nsittings of January 23 and 25 may be obtained. It will\nbe remembered that in connection with the man who has\n\" passed over quite lately \" the name Crossley was given.\nA short passage from the sitting of January 23, 1923, may\nbe quoted again :\n\" ... The name begiiming Cross, Crossley, I'm not\nquite sure of this, but it sounded like Crossley, is\n\f262 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nlinked up with it too. That name seems to be\nimportant, Mr. Bill, Cross, Crossley, Crus, Crosslan.\nDora says, \" This man has only passed over quite,\nquite lately.\"\nIn The Guardian of January 26, 1923, the first of four\n\" In Menioriam \" notices records the death of \" Charles\nCrosslegh,\" for many years Vicar of Bradnuach in Devon,\nand after his retirement \" a familiar and honoured figure\nin the cathedral and city of Exeter.\" It seems at least\npossible that where Feda went astray was in attaching the\nidea of recent death to the man identified as Canon\nParker, whereas it should have been attached to the name\n\" Crossley.\" It may further be suggested that the reason\nwhy the name Crossley was given rather than another as\nan indication of the contents of The Guardian was that\nCharles Crosslegh, like Canon Parker, is associated with the\nCounty of Devon. The place where Canon Parker now\nlives is at no great distance from Exeter.\nAnother point suggesting that at the sittings of January\n23 and 25, 1923, there was an attempt to indicate the\ncontents of The Guardian of January 26, is that printed\nin large type at the head of the contents sheet in this\nnumber of The Guardian are the words \" Concerning a\nFact of Nature. By T. A. Lacey,\" this contribution being\napparently in the nature of a \" special article.\" It will\nbe remembered that the name Lacey was written at the\nsitting of January 25, 1923, and emphasised by the words\n\" better Feda.\" It is at least an odd coincidence that of\nthe names given at these sittings two names otherwise\nunaccounted for, namely, Crosslegh and Lacey, appear\nprominently in the copy of The Guardian bought by Mr.\nIrvmg on January 27, and containing Canon Parker's letter.\nThe only name given on January 23, 1923, which remains\nquite unexplained is \"Black\" or \"Blackburn.\" On\nMarch 9, 1923, Miss Newton addressed the following ques-\ntions to Mr. Irving, to which he replied on March 10 :\n(1) When did you last see or hear of Canon \\Parker'] ?\nAnsioer. So far as I can remember the last time I saw\nCanon [Farktr^ was i]i Gloucester in the spring or summer\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 263\nof 1921. A few weeks later I heard that he had left the\nDiocese. I don't know when I last heard of him, but\nnot for months. I am out of touch noAv with Leck-\nhampton where we worked together.\n(2) Is it true that \" at one time he used to talk to you\na lot and . . . advise you, and that you and he wouldn't\nalways agree . . . but . . . his position and age made it\nalmost impossible for you to stand up and disagree with\nhim \" ; and that \" he was the cause, or part of the cause\nof a disappointment to you, a set-back to you \" ?\nAnswer. Yes. The description here was so accurate that\nthere was no doubt at all in my mind who was being\nspoken of. Canon {Parher'] was very democratic in views,\nin touch with modern thought, keen on furthering re-union\nwith Nonconformists, etc. On many points I was not\nmyself in sympathy with his outlook, as I am naturally\nconservative-minded. On the other hand he was my Vicar,\na Canon of Gloucester, and one of the most important\nmen in the Diocese. I had a strong personal admiration\nfor him, and my position as liis Assistant Curate made it\nnecessary for me not to put forward my own opinions.\nCanon [Parl-e.r] must have been about twenty-five years my\nsenior. At one time he was the cause of a disapisointment\nto me, for he refused to recommend me for a particular\npost that I was anxious to get. We have always under-\nstood, however, that later on he recommended me for my\npresent benefice, and I am surprised that this was not\nmentioned instead of the disappointment.\n(3) Does Feda's description of Canon [Parker'] remind you\nof any one else, \" some one who has passed over since\nyour last sitting \" ?\nAnswer. No.\nMr. living's statement (see his note above on p. 261)\nthat to the best of his knowledge lie had not seen a,ny\nnumber of The Ouardian since November 18, 1922, is of\nsome importance in view of the fact that letters from\nCanon Parker on the subject of the New Lectionary\nappeared in the issues of January 5 and 19, 1923, as well\nas in the issue of January 26, 1923.\n\f264 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nCHAPTER III.\nPicture-Tests.\nThe particular typo of evidence with which I am con-\ncerned in this chaj)ter is one which, so far as I am\naware, is peculiar to Mr. Irving's sittings ; at any rate no\nincidents of quite the same kind have been reported to\nus by other sitters. The evidence has been obtained\nmainly in sittings with Mrs. Leonard, but before describing\nany of these picture-tests, as they are called, in detail it\nwill be of interest to quote a short extract from a sitting\nMr. Irving has recently had with another medium, Mrs.\nWarren Elliott, not only because this extract affords some\nevidence of supernormal knowledge, but principally because\nit suggests a personal link between these picture-tests and\nthe particular communicator from whom they purport to\ncome, i.e. Mr. Irving's wife ; it suggests, I mean, that\nthe picture-tests are \" in character.\"\nExtract from Sitting ivith Mrs. Warren Elliott,\nNovember 18, 1924.\nSitter and Recorder : Rev. W. S. Irving.\n(After an excellent description of the communicator's\ncharacter, Mrs. Warren Elliott continued :)\nMrs. W. E. Was she in some ways almost childish ?\nW. S. I. No, certainly not.\nMks. W. E. Well, I want to tell you what she shows me. I\nfeel I want to play with picture puzzles, bricks.\nI want to play Avith them. [She says :]\n\" I have\nproved to you since my crossing I am still in-\nterested in picture puzzles, though in a much\nmore sacred and helpful way.\"\nNote by Mr. Irviyig.\nMy wife and I used at one time to go in largely in our\nspare time for trying to solve puzzles in Tit-Bits, Answers,\netc. It was not merely an amusement, we were very\n\f99] Sittings ivith Mrs. Leonard. 2fi5\npoor at the time, and large prizes were offered for correct\nsolutions. IVty wife was much better at, and keener on,\nthese things than I was. I liave ah^ays considered her\nskill at giving tests a proof of identity, but I had never\nconnected, consciously, tUl now her \"picture-tests\" given\nthrough ]VIrs. Leonard, with a special type of j)icture puzzle\nshe was fond of. In these picture puzzles you had to\nfind the names of towns or stations, etc. from a picture\n\u2014for instance, take a simple illustration. A Imight in\narmour crossing a bridge would be Knightsbridge.\"\nAbout 60 of these would be given, most of them very\ndifficult to interpret, and valuable prizes awarded to those\nwho were most successful in elucidating the puzzles. In\nthe \"picture-tests\" I have been getting through Mrs.\nLeonard a picture is described more or less in detail and\nI am told that I shall \" see this picture \" or \" be shown\nthis picture \" almost immediately. I have now had a\nlarge number of these tests. I had three more on the\nday after this sitting. Most of these pictures are seen as\ndescribed, though not quite all, and a few are too inde-\nfinite, also, for certainty.\nIt does not seem possible that IVIrs. EUiott should nor-\nmally know about these. She does not Imow my real\nname, and only three have so far been published of these\ntests\u2014in the S.P.R. Journal for November, 1921.\nThe only other point which it seems desirable to record\nbefore passing on to the tests themselves is that Mr. and\nMrs. Irving, being both of them much interested in drama,\nhad been in the habit for some years before Mrs. Irving's\ndeath, of visiting the cinema together, this being the only\nform of dramatic entertainment easily available in the\ncountry parish where Mr. Irving lives. This habit Mr.\nIrving stUl keeps up.\nIt is worth noting that the first attempt at anything in\nthe nature of a picture-test occurred at Mr. Irving's first\nsitting with Mrs. Leonard on January 25, 1921, at which\ntime he was still anonymous to Mrs. Leonard. This case,\nof which a full account will be found in the S.P.R.\nJournal (Vol. XX. pp. 153 ff.) may be regarded as forming\n\f26G Mrs. W. H. Salfer. [part\na kind of transition between book-tests and picture-tests.\nThe picture, subsequently identified as the one to which\nreference was intended at the sitting, was found in a book,\nThe Ci'imson Tide, from which a book-test was given at\nthe same sitting, and so far as that part of the evidence\ngoes, the incident might well be classified as a book-test.\nBut the communicator also emphasised the circumstance\nthat at a place identified at the time of the sitting as the\nS.P.R. Rooms at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., Mr.\nIrving would subsequently have his attention called to a\npicture which would have a special meaning for him in\nconnection with what had been said at this sitting. The\ncommunicator's words as given by Feda were :\n\" Your\nattention will be drawn to a picture ... I am going\nto make you look at a picture, and there will be some-\nthing that will seem a link to you, will have a mean-\ning for you, and you will know I told you beforehand.\"\nThis statement was apparently verified on February 1,\n1921, when the Secretary, Miss Newton, whilst discussing\nwith Mr. Irving the record of his sitting on January 25,\n1921, called his attention to a picture in The Crimson Tide,\nsuggesting that it had a significance in connection with the\nbook-test given at that sitting which Mr. Irving had\nhitherto overlooked. This allusion to a future event which\nthe communicator claims that she is able in some way to\ninfluence distinguishes the incident from the normal type\nof book-tests and brings it into line with the series of\npicture-tests, subsequently given at Mr. Irving's sittings,\nseveral of which I shall now describe.\nThe first picture-test proper, apart from the transitional\nincident quoted above, occurred at Mr. Irving's third\nsitting on June 8, 1921. This incident has also been\nreported in the Journal (Vol. XX. p. 168), but it seems\nworth while to repeat it here :\n\u00a71. \"The Devil's Claim.\"\nExtract from Mr. Irving's Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nJune 8, 1921.\nFeda. And then she [communicator, Mr. Irving's wife] says :\n\" I want you to know you're going to see a picture\n\fSittings with Mrs. Leonard. 267\nsoon that will remind you of me in my earth life.\nI'll influence matters so that you're sure to see it.\nI did before, you know.\" . . . [Note 1.]\n[After a digression to another matter Feda returns to the\nsubject of this 'picture.']\nWhat ? You're going with her where ? To see some\npictures ? Perhaps he doesn't like pictures ! She\nsays she's going with you to see some pictures, many\npictures. As if you're going to be in a place soon\nAvhere there are a lot of pictures. Not in Psychical\n'Searchers' rooms. No ! Different kind of place\naltogether. Because there's something there she\nwants to make you look at there, a picture, that,\nwhen you see it, will remind you of the sitting to-\nday, of the fact of her coming to you. She\"ll be\nable to impress you immediately to look at the right\none. There'll only be one that will fit it. [Note 2.]\nNotes by Mr. Irving.\n(1) During my visit to town I stayed with Mr. and IVIrs.\nWhitehead, the father and mother of the communicator.\nOn coming down to brealifast on the morning of June 9,\nthe day after the sitting, I found the brealdast-room\nempty, and, while waiting for the others to come down,\nsaw a large cabinet photograph of my wife on the mantel-\nshelf. No mention had been made to me of this photo-\ngraph on this visit, though two months before Mrs. White-\nhead had told me that she believed she had one somewhere\nthat I might not have seen before. She had found it on\nthe previous day, during my absence at the sitting, and\nplaced it where I found it for me to see. It had been\ntaken nearly thirty years before.\n(2) On Thursday evening, June 9, getting back from\ntown earlier than I expected, I went into a Cinema, the\none almost next door to the \" Hippodrome \" at Catford.\nThe second film shown was \" 'The Devil's Claim,' featuring\nSessue Hayakawa.\" One scene was of a man visiting a\n\"seer,\" apparently a female trance-medium. The sitting\nwas shown on the film ; medium on a sofa, apparently in\n\f268 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\ntrance, sitter, but no notetaker. There was also what\nappeared to be a semi-materialisation. I had not looked\nto see what films were being shown before going, nor could\nanything of a spiritualistic nature have been suggested to\nme by the posters, had I looked at them. I went round\nnext day to see. I had read no review of this film, and\nbelieve it was the first day it was shown there, Thursday.\nIt was apparently American in origin. Though frequently\nI go to Cinemas, I cannot recall having seen before any\nsitting shown so stronglj^ resembling in certain points an\nordinary trance-sitting.\nMr. Irving has sent us corroborative statements from\nMrs. Whitehead, and from the Manageress of the Cinema,\nbut it does not appear necessary to jirint these statements\nhere. They bear out what Mr. Irving has said in all\nessentials, and in particular the statement from the\nManageress confirms his impression that the film in ques-\ntion, \" The Devil's Claim,\" was shown at that particular\nCinema for the first time on June 9, 1921, the day of Mr.\nIrving' s visit.\n\u00a72. The Ikon Case.\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, August 10, 1923.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr. E. J. Dingwall.\nFeda. That's about the book-tests, but she got another one\nthat she thinks of in connection with the book-tests,\nbut you couldn't quite call it that. It's a picture-\ntest. You have to show it more plainly, Dora.\nYellow, gold, yellow, gold, looks like the sun. A\npicture suggesting yellow, gold, looks like the sun.\nLike a large, brightly coloured, then she says\naggressive sun. Do you mean a boy ? No ! A sun !\nDo you see ? Do you understand that ?

What she's doing look to\nPeda as if he was catching hold of something like\nthat. His hand, not flat to him. Do you see, Mr.\nBill, he's holding it out a bit ? There's a little\nlesson to read from this picture, rather interesting,\nshe says, \" But while I was looldng at it I was\nrather confused as to whether it was two pictures\ntouching each other, or close to each other, or\nwhether it was all part of the same picture.\" She\nsay, \" You can understand what I mean, can't\nyou ?\n\"\nW. S. I. Yes.\nF. You can understand that if you was looking at two\npictures close together under rather difficult condi-\ntions, not seeing them very easily, you might easily\ntake them for one. Station, station, seem to get\nthe word station, the idea of station, as if picture\nconnected with the word station. She says, Mr.\nBill, she doesn't want yo\\i to go looking for it, she\ncan make somebody show it to you like she did\nbefore\u2014soon. Perhaps they [recorder has \" you \"]\nwon't be aware they're showing it, or doing it, but\nshe says, \" I shall be responsible.\"\nW. S. I. She's a marvel, Feda !\nF.

[PABT\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nOn. the afternoon of the day on which tJiis sitting took\n])lace I walked down to Hunter Street to try to book a\nsitting with Mr. Vout Peters for September. The person\nwho came to the door told me that Mr. Peters was en-\ngaged and that it was impossible to disturb him, but if\nI cared to wait he might not be long before he could see\nme. After waiting in a front room for about half an\nhour, Mr. Peters hurried in, followed by three people who\nhad apparently been having a sitting. He seemed sur-\nprised to find me waiting, but barely pausing to say \" Sit\ndown a moment,\" strode across the room, and pointed to\na picture in a corner which I had not noticed, saying,\n\"These are the Ikons.\" Afterwards he showed us another\nIkon in another part of the room which he called the\n\" Veronica \" head. It represented the head of our Blessed\nLord as traditionally said to have been found imprinted\non St. Veronica's handkerchief. On examining the first\nIkon shown I found that it closely corresponded with the\ndescription given through Mrs. Leonard of the picture that\nI was soon to be shown. (See Plate I.) The Ikon was not\nlarge, approximately 10| inches by 8-|. It rei^resented a\nfull-length figure of St. Vladimir who first introduced\nChristianity into Russia. The Saint is depicted as wearing\na crown and long flowing robes. Round his head is a halo\nas big as a penny, the golden rays of the halo are shorter\nat the sides than they are above the head of the Saint.\nSt. Vladimir is represented as holding up in his hands a\ncross. The colouring of the groundwork of the picture\nround the Saint is gold, except at the base. In the back-\nground are clifi^s and green trees. Immediately round the\npicture itself, inside the frame, is a strij) of brown tm with\nsome yellow markings on. The colour of the wall-paper\nlias been white with red roses, but the roses have faded in\ncolour and are now almost white\u2014blotchy white. The\nSaint in apjoearance is elderly, he has a grey beard, and\nthe style of his robes is of the type that one so often\nsees in coloured ])aintings of our Blessed Lord and His\ndisciples. In a sense these Ikons may be said to be two\n\fPlate I.\n\f\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 271\npictures in one, as I am told that the ])icture projier is\nfirst painted and then a large part of it is overlaid ^itli\ngold. They resemble closel}^ in appearance\nStations of the Cross. I had onlv once before this been\nto Mr. Vout Peters' house, on April 18 last, for a sitting\nwhich took place in the study at the back of the house.\nI remember that there were some Ikons in that room\nwhich I noticed then ; and I have thouglit since that it\nis quite likely that I may have been shown those in the\nfront room also, after the sitting. The picture of St.\nVladimir, however, when seen this time, did not bring\nback to me any recollection at the time of my having\nseen it before, nor am I sure that I went into the front\nroom at all then. ... I had told no one but Mr. Ding-\nwall that I thought of calling there to boolc another\nsitting on that day. The pseudonym that I have given\nto Mr. Peters is not one that I have used elsewhere.\nMrs. Leonard knows my identity now.\nThe following corroborative statement was received from\nMr. Vout Peters, contained in a letter to Miss Newton :\n15.8.23.\nOn Friday, the 10th of August, 1923, at between 4 and\n5, I invited a party of people, two ladies and one gentle-\nman, to see some Russian Ikons I had in a general\nsitting-room I have in my house. I had been giving\nthem a seance in my seance room, and after the seance\nthey had admired some beautiful Ikons I have there.\nHence the invitation to the sitting-room. When I entered\nthe sitting-room I saw there a clergyman who had been\nto see me once before, whose name I do not know. I\nasked him if he would care to inspect the Ikons ; to do\nso he had to cross the room, as he could not see the one\nI showed him where he was sitting. I did not know he\nwas coming and he never has been in the room before. . . .\nAlfred Vout Peters.\nWith reference to Mi-. Vout Peters' statement that Mr.\nIrving had never been in the room before, Mr. Irving-\nwrote to me on October 25, 1923, as follows :\n\f272 Mrs. W. II. Salter. [part\nWhen I wa\u00ab in tuwii last Miss Newton rcail to ine Vout\nPeters' statement on the case. He says in it that I had\nnever seen the Ikon before. I don't feel satisfied about\nthis. In my statement I say I think it quite lilvely that\nI had. It is impossible now to be certain, but I still\nthink it likely that I may have seen it and forgotten it.\nThis does not diminish the value of the test owing to the\nway it was brouglit off, as you will see when you read it.\nW. S. Irving.\nOn November 23, 1923, Mr. Irving wrote a further note\non tlie case, as follows :\nAdditiojial Note to the Ikon Test.\nAfter sending in my notes on this test I v^'as again\nreading through the latter part of tlie script, when it\noccurred to me that the words suggested that there was\nsomething else to look for as well as the picture. \"There's\nsomething holy, something suggesting the Cross, which\nyou'll be reminded of same time . . . something to do\nwith sacrifices too, and leaves, green leaves. Stone, stone,\ncoming a long way round. ...\" The following seems to\nbe applicable : Some time about the end of 1916 or\nbeginning of 1917, I had a letter from a lady in Norfolk,\nwhom I will call Mrs. X, asldng permission to imt a\nMemorial to her son in my church at Oxenhall. The son\nhad been killed in the war. Her fiirst suggestion as to\nthe form the Memorial should take did not seem suitable\nfor our little church. It was ultimately decided that a\nlarge granite cross, about 14 feet in height, and bearing\na figure of our Saviour in Sicilian marble, should be erected\noutside the church. This, at Mrs. X's suggestion, was to\nserve as a War Memorial for the Parish\u2014not only for her\nson ; and the names of all Parishionei's who sacrificed\ntheir lives in the war were to be engraved thereupon.\nThe Memorial was made by a firm in the Euston Road,\nbrought down here, and dedicated by the Rural Dean at\na service which I conducted, on June 14, 1917. A lady\nwho was living with us at the time tried to take snap-\nshots of the Dedication Ceremony ; these were not, how-\never, very successful. . . . On looking recently at one of\n\f\f\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonanl. 273\nthese snapshots it struck me how very likely it is that\nmy communicator was reminded of this scene by the Ikon.\nAt the Dedication Ceremony there must have been a\ndistinct resemblance to the picture, the cross, and the\nfigure in ancient robes\u2014myself wearing a cope, etc. Flowers\nand leaves are continually placed at the foot of the cross\nto-day by friends a.nd relations of those whose names are\ninscribed thereon.\ng Irving\nIn one of these snapshots, which Mr. Irving sent us,\nthe cross is seen, and in another (Plate II.) is the figure\nof Mr. Irving wearing a long cope which has a general\nresemblance to the priestly robe worn by St. Vladimir\nin the picture. Mr. Irving adds that the communi-\ncator, Mrs. Irving, was present when these snapshots\nwere taken. \" I remember she told me that she tried\nin vain to borrow the camera for a moment and take the\nsnapshots herself.\" The Ikon is also reproduced in order\nthat readers may judge for themselves how closely it cor-\nresponds to the description given at the sitting of August\n10, 1923. The large \" aggressive \" sun can be clearly seen.\nWith regard to Mr. Irving's suggestion that the reference\nto two pictures may be explained by the way in which\nthe Ikons are painted, it seems to me that it is rather\nmore likely to be due to a rather vague appreciation of\nthe fact that there was more than one Ikon in the room.\nAs will be seen by J\\'Ir. Irving's note another Ikon was\nactually shown by Mr. Peters to Mr. Irving and the other\npersons jDresent, and he had in addition several other Ikons\nin his seance room at which his sitters had just been\nlooking. The probabihty of this interpretation seems to\nbe strengthened by the reference to \" station,\" which\nimmediately follows the allusion to seeing \" two pictures\nclose together.\" The second Ikon shown to Mr. Irving-\nwas, he tells us, a representation of the \" Veronica\n\"\nHead, and the incident of St. Veronica is commonly\nincluded amongst the \" Stations of the Cross.\" On this\npoint Mr. Irving writes :\nMost of our favourite churches have Stations of the\nCross, including one at whicli I was for a time Temporary\n\f274 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nAssistant-Curate. Also my wife, when a girl, was at a\nRoman Catholic School at one time. Stations of the\nCross were familiar things to her in Church worship, and\nshe liked them.\nWith reference to any possible suggestion of collusion\nbetween Mrs. Leonard and Mr. Vout Peters, it is important\nto note that Mr. Irving did not go to Mr. Peters' house\nby appointment and only Mr. Dingwall knew of his in-\ntention to go there.\n\u00a7 3. The House and Ship Case.\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, November 22, 1923.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Savy.\nFkda. Wait a minute, 'cos I've got to see what you're\nshowing as well as hearing. She's trying to show\nme something, and she wants me to see it very\ncarefully before I say exactly what I think it is.\n\"A country lane,\" she says, \"very bright green,\ngrass I suppose, each side of the lane, but some-\nthing peculiar\u2014this grass doesn't seem right, it seems\nthe wrong colour.\" But grass is green, Dora !\n\" Yes, I know, but wrong shade,\" she says. And\na white and scarlet house. That would be a nice\none ! In the background, yet showing up very\nprominently in the picture.\nW. S. I. Picture ?\nF. Yes, you didn't tell him it was a picture ! \" Yes,\"\nshe says, \" this is a picture, but I wanted Feda to\nget the idea of it.

She\nwants you particularly to notice the shade of\ngreen which she thinks is wrong.

She says, \"This may rather\namuse you.\" Close to this picture, in the near\nassinity [sic) of the jDicture, something seemed to her\na dangerous place. Something could be very, very\ndangerous. This feeling's very strong in her, Mr.\nBill, a dangerous place. She doesn't want you to\ntake it as a warning, or anything silly of that kind.\nA warning isn't silly 1 A warning couldn't be !\nBut simply a test. This place of danger is con-\nnected Avith noises. Any moment 3'ou might hear\nstartling noises ; but look for the picture first. She\nsays, \" It's extraordinary how I can make you look\nat the thing I mean sometimes.\" \" But,\" she says,\n\" no, it's not extraordinary, because at home you\noften answer directly to what I tell you.\" She says,\n\" You take my impressions wonderfully sometimes.\"\n. . . Mr. Bill, you may not remember this at the\nmoment\u2014have you been looking at a picture of a\nship lately ? Rather particularly looking at ships ?\nW. S. I. I saw an advertisement of one this morning.\nF. I do not think it is important, but she just got it\nfrom your mind. You were a little impressed by\nthe picture of a ship. This was not just an adver-\ntisement, but a jjicture of a ship. That's the right\none, Mr. Bill, but you going to look at one that\nmight easily be the duplicate of it to-night. Not the\nsame one, a similar looking ship, and, she says, \" I\nthink it'll strike you as being similar at once.\"\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nIn order that what follows may be fully understood I\nmust briefly sketch my movements during this week. On\n\f7() Mrs. W. H. Sailer. [part\nTuesday, Nciv. 20, I Avas at the S.P.R. Rooms going\nthrough soine notes with Miss Newton. I remarlved to\nlier that I did wish I could see the film \" One Exciting\nNight \" again, as I had a minor point to verify before the\n\" Noise \" test could be i:)ublished, and I also wanted my\ndescription of the film confirmed by a witness. On Tues-\nday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons I was occupied\nwith sittings. On Thursday evening I was looking for the\nred and Avhite house. On Friday, having in the earlier\njiart of the day finished my week's work, I thought I\nwould have a few hours' recreation and take my sister-in-\nlaw, Mrs. Savy, to a show. Arriving at our meeting-place\ntoo early, and having to wait, I filled in the time by\nwalking to the Palace Theatre to see what was on there.\nI found it was a film called \" Down to the Sea in Ships.\"\nThis was illustrated by many pictures outside the theatre\nof a large three-masted sailing-vessel with all sails set.\nThere were eleven pictures of this ship on one side only\nof the theatre. This at once recalled to my mind a film,\neither, I think, part 1 or part 2 of the serial, \" Japhet in\nSearch of his Father,\" which I had seen a few weeks\npreviously at the \" King's \" Cinema, Gloucester. I re-\nmember the ship, because I was particularly struck at\nthe time with the beauty of the pictures of this ship in\nfull sail and thought how different modern ships look.\nThe ship I had thought of at the sitting was a three or\nfour-funnelled Atlantic liner. I had seen that advertised\nat King's Cross Station ])vior to the sitting.\nThe \" Palace \" programme did not seem interesting, so\nafter dinner I suggested to Mrs. Savy that we should go\nto the \" Grange,\" Kilburn, as the music there is good.\nI did not Imow what was on, but had seen earlier in the\nweek \" Scandal \" advertised there ; I thought probably it\nwould be still on. The piece proved to be \" One Exciting\nNight \" \u2014the one piece necessary for me to see if the\n\"Noise\" test Avere to be published with my other tests.\nAfter the show we walked to Brondesbury and Kilburn\nStation. As I was getting our tickets Mrs. Savy said to\nme, \" Why, there's your red house !\n\" Hanging by the\nright-hand side of the ticket-office window was a good-\n\f99] Silfhtgs vjifh Mrs. Leonard. 277\nsized picture of a red and white house, the liouse projier\nbeing white, witli bright red roof and ciumneys. In the\nforeground is a country lane with a stile leading onto a\nroad. Each side of the lane is bright blue grass. The\nstation is i?ro?Klesbury and Kilburn. About five or six\nfeet to the left of the picture hangs the Table of Fares,\nin, of course, what look like black and white columns.\nTo the right and a little further off the Time-Table of\ntrains. (I am not sure which side is the Time-Table and\nwhich the \" Fares.'\") This booking-ofiice is close to a\nvery dangerous crossing, Edgware Road, as the road is very\nwide, there are no shelters half-way across, and it is at\nthe foot of a long slope doAvn which cars come very fast.\nIt is almost under the railwaj^ bridge across which electric\ntrains rattle every few minutes.\nLater. I have discovered by looking back through last\nweek's Daily Mails that \" One Exciting Night \" was\nadvertised in that paper as being at \" The Grange,\"\nKilburn, in Thursday's and Saturday's issue. I myself\ngenerally read the Daily Mail, though I believe I missed\nit altogether on one day in the middle of the week, I\nforget which. Being very busy, however, I had not time\nto do more than skim through the paper. Certainly I did\nnot consciously read the advertisement column of announce-\nments on Thursday ; and I consider it unlikely that I can\nsubconsciously have noticed \" One Exciting Night \" adver-\ntised at Kilburn. The print is small. I was also most\nanxious to see the piece and could hardly have failed to\ngrasp it, had I read it.\nI should like, if I may, to put forward a theory con-\ncerning the events of this evening, Friday, November 23.\nIf I interpret what happened correctly, I think that it was\nthe intention of the controlling intelligence to make me\nverify these tests on the previous evening; but owing prob-\nably to my mind being over active and on the look-out for\nthe red and white house, it proved impossible to impress\nme where to go. On the Friday, however, when m}\nweek's researches were over, and I was allowing myself a\nlittle relaxation, with a mind less occupied and strenuous,\nthe chance was given. I tliink I am justified in assuming\n\f27S Mrs. ir. SaJtcr. [part\nthat t]ic8e tJux'c tests proving veridical one after another,\nas they did, is beyond chance-eoincidence. If this intelli-\ngence be my own subconscious mind, which I find it\ndifficult to beheve, it would seem to have the power to\nsee the sign-boards outside a theatre whicli T had not\nbeen near ; to find out that a film necessary for me to\nsee as soon as possible Avas being shown at a Cinema\nwhich I had also not passed during tliis visit to town\n;\nto describe, in very considerable detail, a picture which\nI may or may not have seen before, but certainly liad\nnot for months, as I seldom pass Brondesbury ticket\noffice ; and finally to steer me by mental impression from\none place to another to verify three things in less than\nsix hours. Once before I had a somewhat similar ex-\nperience of three supernormal veridical impressions in one\nevening, but unfortunately in that case the material was\ntoo personal for jiublication, and also there was no\nwitness.\nNovember 26, 1923.\nIn reply to an enquiry from Miss Newton, Mr. Irving\nstated in a letter dated January 3, 1924, that\nMrs. Leonai'd knows nothing of my movements when in\ntoAvn. To the best of my belief she has no knowledge\nthat I have ever been to Brondesbury or to the \" Grange \"\nCinema at Kilburn.\nWith reference to this statement I vi^rote to Mrs. Leonard\non January 21, 1925, asking her (1) whether she travelled\nmuch on the London underground railways, (2) whether\nshe had been in recent years to Brondesbury and Kilburn\nStation, (3) w^liether she had any reason to associate\nMr. Irving with Brondesbury. She replied as follows :\nJan. 23, 1925.\nI have been once in my life to Brondesbury Station\nabout ten years ago, at least I think it was Brondesbury,\nor Brondesbury Park. It is the station between Kilburn\nand Cricklewood.\nI hardly ever go on the Underground. I have not been\nto Brondesbury or Kilburn Station since the time I went\n\f99] Sittings ivifh Mrs-. Leonard. 279\nin 1915\u2014or late 1914. I have passed through Kilburn High\nStreet in a car occasionally, but never been in the station.\nNo. I have never associated Mr. Irving with these places,\nnor heard him speak of them as far as I remember. . . .\nGladys Leonard.\nSubsequently Mr. Irving made some further enquiries at\nKilburn Station, the result of which he communicated to\nMiss Newton. She reports her conversation with Mr.\nIrving as follows :\nSept. 18, 1924.\nThis morning Mr. Irving told me that he made\nenquiries at Kilburn Station last night as to how long the\npicture had been there. He was told by the ticket col-\nlector that it had been there at least two years.\nMr. Irving remembers that about one and a half years\nago he had an appointment with some one outside the\nstation and had walked up and down at least a quarter\nof an hour waiting. He thinks therefore that it is highly\nprobable that he must have seen this picture.\nI. Newton.\nTo sum up the above incident : the four points to which\nMr. Irving' s attention was specially directed at the sitting\nof November 22, 1923, were (1) a picture of a ship which\nwould remind him of another picture of a ship lately seen ;\n(2) a picture of a red and white house with a lane and\ngrass of a colour which seemed unusual ; (3) a name\nbeginning with \" Bron,\" and (4) associated with the picture\nand the name a place described as dangerous and noisy.\nAll these points were verified during the evening of\nFriday, November 23. It seems not unlikely that the\nname \" Bron \" given at the sitting may have uncon-\nsciously suggested Brondesbury to Mr. Irving, and this\npossibility is strengthened by the fact that he had prob-\nably seen the picture of a house outside Brondesbury and\nKilburn Station some months before the sitting. The\nname \" Bron \" and his own unconscious recollection of the\npicture may have sufficed to turn his mind towards the\n\" Grange \" Cinema at Kilburn, when casting about for a\npossible explanation of the statements made at the sitting.\n\f280 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [fart\nThese circumstances do not, however, account for his\napparently casual and accidental visit to the outside of\nthe \" Palace \" Cinema where he saw pictures of a sailing\nship and thereby verified another point in the test. Nor\ndo they afford any explanation of the statements made at\nthe sitting, which appear to be based upon a fairly exact\nknowledge of ideas lying dormant in Mr. Irving's mind\nand a consequent knowledge of what he might be likely\nor might be easily persuaded to do. And therein, as it\nseems to me, lies the special interest of these picture-tests.\nThey appear to be intelligent forecasts based upon (a) a\nconsiderable knowledge of Mr. Irving's own thoughts and\ncircumstances, (6) some knowledge of the thoughts of other\npersons, and (c) in some cases direct clairvoyance.\nWhether these supernormal powers are to be attributed\nto Mrs. Leonard herself, or to Feda, or to the supposed\ncommunicator is a question which must, I think, be de-\ntermined according to the general nature of the evidence\nobtained through Mrs. Leonard's mediumship ; such tests\nas these do not in themselves afford strong evidence of\npersonal identity, although, as is shown by the extract\ngiven from the sittmg with Mrs. Warren Elliott, they are\nof a type which might readily suggest itself to a person\nof this particular communicator's turn of mind.\nIn regard to the above statement Mr. Irving wrote to\nme on January 19, 1925 :\nYour comment in the Ship and House Test as to the\nnature of the Dkecting Intelligences was anticipated by\nmy communicator on April 19, 1923. I think her words\nare worth recording\n:\nD. G. I. Isn't it funny I can lead you to things at times ?\nIt shows I've power with j^ou apart from the\nsitting. They surely wouldn't think it was the\ndirecting mind of the medium, would they ? Have\nthey thought she might be giving a sitting while\nyou're looking, so she couldn't be directing your\nmind. No ! Its just the hapjiy, happy truth I'm\nwitli you and just getting things through in the best\nway I can, just enough to remind you I'm there.\n\f99] Sittings ivifh Ilrs. Leonard. 281\n\u00a74.

Mr. Bill, she showing me a picture of a\nr-r-river, a narrow, narrow river. Up the side of the\nriver is trees and like scener}^ country scenery, not\na river in a town.

While she's trying to show me that,\nI have a feeling, an impression, of shade and dark-\nness. Yes, yes, that's right. Wait ! She says,\n\" Want you to remember that.\" She says 'tis im-\nportant. [Note 2.]\nNotes by Mr. Irving.\n(1) The sitting ended at about 5 p.m. On the way to the\nstation I remarked to the note-taker that I was reminded\nof the Lake District and that I thought that perhaps we\nmight see the picture next da> at Mrs. Brittain's. I had\na sitting booked with her and I believed there were some\npictures of the Lake District in a room there. My reason\nfor mentioning the Lake District was that Feda'e description\nhad reminded me of two holidays that my wife and I had\nspent, in 1901 and 1902, at the English Lakes, where there\nare many narrow, woody rivers. We took a camera with\nus in 1902, and the particular snapshot of which I was\nthinking as answering to the description was one that I\nstill have, of Stock Ghyll Force, near Ambleside. About\nan hour and a half after the sitting, I went into King's\nCross Cinema without knowing anything about what pic-\ntures were being shown, save that I saw outside the door\nthat \" The Eternal City \" was billed. The Pathe Pictorial\ncontained views of the Lake District. There were three\npictures showing the little rivers of the district. I take\nit that the statement given through Feda that \"the river\npart of it will not be stamped on your mind \" was made\nbecause in my picture at home there is hardly any water.\nIn summer these little \" becks \" become often nearly dry.\nAt the Cinema there was more water shown.\n(2) The comedy shown at the King's Cross Cinema was\ncalled \" Don Quickshot of the Rio Grande.\" In the earlier\nscenes Don Quixote in armour is shown, mounted on a\nhorse. Galloping up to an old gateway he thrusts at the\ngate-keeper with his lance, which is, I think, shivered by\ntlie ])low. Drawing a long sword, he hastens to the rescue\nof a lady in distress, smiting vigorously ; and with his\nsword spits two people at once. The scene then changes\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 283\nfrom ancient times to modern. Don Quixote becomes Don\nQuickshot. An American cowboy has been dreaming of\ndoing heroic deeds like j)eople in the past. You see him\npractising shooting with the long bow. Later, in a house,\na man draws a bowie-knife, and throws it at the back of\nDon Quickshot. I gather that another man was transfixed\ninstead, for in the later scenes Don Quickshot is being\npursued by the Sheriff. I have only once before been to\nthe King's Cross Cinema.\nMr. Irving sent us a confirmatory statement from Mrs.\nDingwall in regard to his conversation with her whilst\nwalking to the station after the sitting and a programme\nof the King's Cross Cinema, which shows that on April\n28, 29, and 30, 1924, the pictures shown included \" Don\nQuickshot of the Rio Grande \" and \" The Eternal City.\"\nThe Pathe Pictorial is mentioned on the programme, but\nthere is no indication as to the nature of the pictures\nincluded in this section.\nMr. Irving also sent us his snapshot of Stock Ghyll\nForce, Avhicli shows a narrow white ribbon of water\nheavily shadowed by trees.\n\u00a7 5. Eating Fruit.\nExtract from Sitting ivith Mrs. Leonard, July 29, 1924.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mi's. Dingwall.\nFjiDA. She says, \" Do you remember a silly little thing I\ntold you with regard to fruit ? ^ You're going to\nbe reminded of that in a picture almost immediately.\"\nShe says, \" I think quite quickly, within twenty-four\nhours.\" She says, \" It will be quite a definite thing,\nan unmistakable thing, that you'll be forced to look\n9.t.\" What are you laughing at ? She says, \" I\ncan't help laughing. I want you to remember the\nwords forced to look at.\" You needn't look for it,\nMr. BUI. She says, \" It's almost loolcing for yon !\n\"\nShe means something by that, Mr. Bill. I can tell\nwhen she means a little more than she can say.\n1 See above, p. 193.\nT\n\f284 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nNote by Mr. Irving.\nI tried a new plan this time. In order that my com-\nmunicator might know what my movements immediately\nafter the sitting would be, I made a programme for\nmyself, before leaving home, as to what entertainments 1\nwould go to on the evening after the sitting and the\nfollowing evening. I chose the \" Pavilion \" Cinema at\nShepherd's Bush for the Tuesday (July 29), and the\nShepherd's Bush Empire (Varieties) for the Wednesday.\nI had no knowledge beforehand what pictures would be\nshown at the Pavilion Cinema, and was careful not to look\nat the advertisements. This programme I kept to. On\nMonday evening, July 28, 1924, the day before the sitting,\nI went to the \" Grange \" Cinema at Kilburn, and saw a\nfilm called \" Fashion Row,\" featuring Mae Murray. On\nTuesday morning, July 29, I received a ' note from Miss\nNewton asking me to send another copy of the \"16 im-\npressions Tests.\" By this letter I was reminded of the\n\" Fruit Test \" which was one of the sixteen. After the\nsitting I went to the Pavilion Cinema, according to plan,\nand did not discover till I got inside that the film which\nhad just started was \" Fashion Row \" which I'd seen only\nthe night before. I thought it best, however, to sit\nthrough it as I was there, and not to change what I had\narranged to do. Half-way through the piece I found that\nI was looking at a picture in which Mae Murray, as one\nof the heroines, was looking after a fruit stall ; she sells,\nor gives, a banana to a young man who asks for some,\nand then gets a largo bunch of bananas to sell. I had\nof course seen this incident the night before, but not\nknowing that the subject of fruit was to come up, had\nforgotten it. After the performance I bought an Evening\nNcvjs to see, if I could, in what percentage of cinemas\nthis particular film was being shown. I found that\n\" Fashion Row \" Avas advertised in seven out of the\nt'wenty-four.\nOne may suppose that the communicator's statement\nthat Mr. Irving Avill be forced to look at the picture in\nquestion, tliat \"it's almost looking for\" him, is an allusion\n\f99] Sitting\u2022's with Mrs. Leonard. 285\nto the fact that it was to be brought to his notice twice\nover on consecutive nights. As Mr. Irving mentions in\nhis note, it had actually been brought to his notice on\nthe night before the sitting, but not recognised by him\nat the time as having any interest or significance.\nWhen I read a report on these picture-tests at a meet-\ning of the Society on February 5, 1925, a question was\nraised as to the extent to Avhich the tests could be regarded\nas att'ording evidence of the communicator's identity. On\nthis point Mr. Irving subsequently wrote to me as follows :\nFeb. 16, 1925.\nIn addition to the points you then mentioned there is\nthe claim made in some of the tests that they are like\npictures \" at home.\" (This was said with regard to the\n\"Battle\" and \"Narrow River \" ^ ]iicture-tests.) Or \"will\nremind you very strongly of the Church at home.\" Or\n\" also has a duplicate at home.\" . . .\nI doubt if this point has been made enough of, probably\nbecause the best of these rese}nblances do not occur in the\npicture-tests which are most striking. The claim, however,\nseems to be correct in nearly every case\u2014in one I am not\nquite certain.\nThe other picture-tests, although it is not stated so in\nthe script, were found to be like pictures at home, or in\nsome way connected Avith places in which my wife was\ninterested.\nW. S. Irving.\nCHAPTER IV.\nMiscellaneous Incidents.\nI WILL conclude this part of my paper by recording three\nincidents which do not fall into any of the classes pre-\nviously considered. In the case of the first, and most\nstriking, of these incidents the source of the information\ngiven at the sitting may be the communicator's memory\nof facts known to her during her lifetime. The last two\nincidents cannot be so explained, since they appear to\n^ Seo nhnvo, p. 2SI, .\n\f286 3Ir.s. W. H. Salter. [part\ninvolve knowledge of events which have occurred since the\ncommunicator's death. They differ from the incidents re-\ncorded in Chapter I., in that the relevant facts were\nknown to the sitter. In the third incident there seems\nto be an attempt to refer to a certain recent event\nthrough two mediums. (For another example of this,\ntaken from Mr. Irving's sittings, see S.P.R. Journal,\nVol. XXI. pp. 104 ff.)\n\u00a7 1. The Lace Collar.\nExtract from, SiUing wifJi. Mrs. Leonard, November 22, 1923.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Ixving. Becorder : Mrs. Savy.\nFbda. Then she suddenly says to you, \" Did you keep the\nlace collar, the small lace collar ?\n\"\nW. S. 1. I don't know.\nF. She says, \" I think yon have.\" She's showing nie this\nvery plainly. Mr. Bill, it's not a straight piece of\nlace\u2014not straight, rather curved, as if it were made\na shape ; and it's got a pattern on it. It isn't,\nbut it looks abuost like, the shape of a daisy, and\nthen there is a sort of pattern.\nW. S. I. Can you draw it ?\n(Sitter lumds Avriting ]iMd to Feda wlici dra-w s thus :)\nF.

You wouldn't look nice in it.\nShe says, \" You've got a very good picture of it,\"\nshe says, \" a very good picture of it.\" She says,\n\" I don't mean a photo of it.\" She doesn't mean\nshe was photographed in the collar.\nW. S. I. Oh, I thought she did.\nF. But something you've still got of hers, looks to Feda\nlike a book, and there's a picture looldng exactly\nlike this lace collar on the outside of it.

She thinks you will, but she says it might be a\nreproduction of the collar, so wonderfully exact ; but\nalso on the outside of the same book\u2014she says,\n' When I sent this report to Mr. Irving he wrote to me on January\n19, 1925 :\n\" In the '\nLace Collar '\ncase my remarks '\nI know,' etc., give, I see,\nthe impression that I knew more than I did. I only meant '\nI know\nwhere to look.'\n\"\n\f288 Mrs. W. JJ. Sailer.

[Note 1.]\nb\\ Oh, did you keep the cutting book, the old cutting\nJ)ook with the diagrams in ? The old cutting-out\nbook with the diagrams in ? I think you did. I\ncan describe this one to you.

She says, \" I believe you\nknow where the patterns are.\" She says,\n'\"'\nDon't\nbelieve you do know about this, but it's there.\"\nIn the front of this book, just as you begin to open\nit, are some remarks about schools and classes. Have\nyou got that 1 And Dora says, \" I wanted to use\nthis book, in fact I did use it, a little while\nbefore I passed over. You must have seen it lying\nabout.\" She says, \" You must have seen it.\"\nUsed to refer to it sometimes. You've still got\nit, but, she says, it's not where you keep books\nthat you look at often. Doesn't suppose you've\nnoticed this book for years, but it's there ;\nand,\nshe says, \" it's a funny way to put it, very mucli\nimxDregnated with me because I used it a good\ndeal.\" [Note 2.]\nNotes by Mr. Irving.\n(1) I have found a lace collar that I think is the one\nintended on a dress of my wife's which was hanging in a\nwardi'obe behind other things. If this be the collar meant,\nFeda is not correct in saying that it is not a straight\npiece of lace, for it is ; but it does not look so, because\nit is sewn onto the collar of the dress. From the back\nof the dress it looks just like the shape drawn by Feda,\n\fSitlings wiih Mrs. Leonard. 289\nbut this is illusionarv. The lace goes ovei' the sliuulders,\nand down tlie front of tlie dress in a V-shai>e. That the\ncommunicator knew tliis, though Feda did not, is, I think,\nshown by the sentence the stitches have come undone\nnear the front corner,\" I found a slit, a tear, in the\nlace in the jolace indicated, one and a half inches in\nlength. This was not in my conscious mind, but whether\nI have ever known about it, it is not possible now to find\nout. The pattern of the lace is called, I find, the\n\" Shamrock pattern.\" The lace is three inches in depth,\nbut only about two inches is visible on the collar, as the\nupper part is turned over and stitched inside the dress.\nThe lace was made by my wife herself, who made many\nlace things. Feda's statement that she \" didn't get it\nfrom a place close to \" may refer to the silk or to the\npattern from which the collar was made.\nAfter a hunt I found a picture of it on the cover of\nNeedlecraft, No. 21. This and several other copies of\nNeedlecraft, I found among a pile of papers in a room that\nI do not now use myself. I often saw my wife studying\nNeedlecrafi in life, but it is doubtful if I have ever come\nacross this particular number since her death. \" Mi'S.\nIrving \" was written in pencil on the cover in my wife's\nhandwriting. The pattern on Needlecraft, No. 21, is an\nexact reproduction of the lace on the collar. There are a\nnumber of other patterns also of lace in Needlecraft, which\nis a thin magazine with paper covers published by the\nManchester School of Embroidery and., containing about 15\npages in each number. I had no conscious knowledge that\na pattern of lace made by my wife was either on the\ndress or on the cover of the book, though I must have\nseen the lace on the collar and seen it made. The \" slit\n\"\nis not visible unless the collar is closel}^ examined.\n(2) From the description something of the nature of\nWeldoji's Journal seemed indicated. An exhaustive hunt,\nhowever, failed to bring to light any magazine of that\nkind. There was also this difficulty that the \" cutting-\nout book \" was said to have been used a good deal by\nmy wife, whereas fashion books are continually changing,\nnor could I recall having seen my v.ife make frequent use\n\f290 Mrs. W. II. Snlter. [part\nof ail}' ,sucli ljuok. TJie, only recollection of \" cuttings\n\"\nI could call to mind were recipes for cooking which many\nyears ago my wife used to collect and ]:)aste into a book.\nIt seemed highly doubtful if the book still existed, and\nthere seemed to be little to be gained by looking for it,\nfor it was not likely to be illustrated with ladies' dresses.\nI hunted for it, however, and found on Christmas Day two\nof these cookery books on an upper shelf in a kitchen\ncupboard, covered with dust. They had clearly not been\nmoved for a very long time. The first had a dark red\ncover, but had inside only recipes written out in my\nwife's handwriting. The second was a brown-covered\nexercise-book, stained with red. On the front cover were\nthe words \"The St. Paul's Exercise Book.\" On the back\ncover were arithmetical tables. The words \" middle-class\ncookery \" occur at the top of six pages in the book, which\nconsists of cookery cuttings apparently cut out of various\npapers and jDasted in. I could not find any connection\nwith Jadies' dresses in the book, till I thought of examin-\ning the backs of the cuttivgs, when I found illustrations of\nladies' dresses, both with and without \" ladies inside them,\"\nand also diagrams for \" cutting out.\" They must have\nhuen taken from some fashion paper of long ago, probably\nnear the beginning of the century, as they are decidedly\nold-fashioned.\nW.

A tear about 1| inches in length\nappears about two inches from the bottom of the collar\nviewed from the front.\nR. R.

It\nis to be observed that the statement made at the sitting\nthat the name of a great friend of Mrs. Irving's was on\nthe cover is incorrect. The name was Mrs. Irving's own.\nI have also seen the cookery book to which Mr. Irving-\nrefers and the representations of ladies' dresses which\nappear on the back of some of the cuttings pasted into\nthe book. It will be noted that the book is first referred\nto by Feda as \" the cutting book, the old cutting book\nwith the diagrams in.\" This would have been, so far as\nit goes, a correct description of the book. The further\namplification \" cutting-out book \" was apparently a mis-\ntake. The statement that the cover is red is also wrong ;\nthis may be due either to confusion with the other cookery\nbook found with it, or to an impression of the red splashes\non the brown cover. The reference to \"remarks about\nschools and classes,\" though not very definite, is correct,\nthe book being called the \" St. Paul's Exercise Book.\"\n\u00a7 2.

She seems\nto have jumped now, she is talking of a window\nnow. She says, \" I stand by a window so often\nand I thought you so often looked to where I stood\nb}^ it, as if you expected me to be there.\" But\nwhen you look at the window you have to look\na little at one side. It's in a place you are in\nsometimes ; and when you stand like that and think\nof her, she always sees you look to one side a little,\nas if you 'spect her to be standing there\u2014and she\ndoes. She says, \" You'll do it again soon, you often\ndo.\" \"Both get it,\" she says. She says, \"You've\n'\ndone it almost unconsciously so far,\" but she thinks\n\f292 Mrs. W. \/\/. Salfcr.

When\nyou does that, suppose you here, the window is\nthere (Feda points to left front), and she stands by\nit. She says, \" You'll do it again soon, and it will\nremind you.\" There is something by the wall there\nnear the window which draws her, interests her, as\nif it reminded her of the earth, close by the Avindow,\nquite close. Hymn, hymn. She doesn't mean a\nman \"him,\" but a real \"hymn.\" Feda likes\n\"Abide with me.\" She nods her head and says,\n\"So do I.\" She's mixed it up, you say. What did\nyou say ? Stink, stink ? What did it remind you\nof ? Feda can't quite get that. What's she j)re-\ntending to do 1 She's moving something. (Feda\nmakes swinging movement, moving hand backwards\nand forwards.) What did you sa,y ? She says, \" I\ncome then, I'm there.\"\nWhat is it ? Is it a vase ? Show Feda the shape of it.\n(Feda draws in the air with both her hands.)\nSomething shaped like this, raised a bit, and then\nnarrower, shiny and hard. Has it two bits sticking\nout at the sides ? Not big things, two little things.\nHalf-way down there are rings. Can't you put your\nnails through and feel grooves ? Is this ever near\na picture ? She links it up with a picture. (Here\nFeda traces a cross with her finger.) She's making\na cross or two. No, no. It's a cross she's making.\nW. P. I. Or two ?\nF. A cross. When you said \" or two \" she said, \" no,\nno.\" Yet there is a cross. She says, \"Not a\ncross, but something looks as if it had a design of\na cross on it.\" When she sees the things she is\ndescribing she sees something with a cross on it.\nFeda likes nice smells too. . . .

The cross de-\nscribed was thought at the time to be either the Altar\nCross, or the Processional Cross at G. It is clearly, how-\never, the Cross on the Hymn-board that is meant. The\nhymn \" Abide with me \" has a special significance with\nregard to the communicator. The only alteration made of\nlate near F has been the changing of the position of the\nlarge altar candles. They were moved forward last autumn\nowing to the ravages of the mice.\n(b) Further Extracts from Sitting of January 27, 1921.\nli'EDA.

DAWSON-SMITH'S SITTINGS.\nThe communicator in the sittings recorded below was\nLieutenant Frank Dawson-Smith, 1\/5 Battalion The King's\nAfrican Rifles, who was killed on the Abyssinian frontier\non January 11, 1920. His mother wrote on October 14,\n1920, in a letter addressed to Sir Oliver Lodge's Secretary :\nI don't know if you remember the account (it was in\nevery }3aper all over the world) of a mutiny of Somalis\non the Abyssinian frontier. My boy was the only white\nman and in sole command of the native troops. He had\na district to patrol of 4000 square miles, and his nearest\nwhite man was 250 miles away. Owing to the rabid\ninstigation of a fanatic of \" Mad Mullah's,\" 20 of the\nnative troops mutinied ; the rest of the Somalis (notably\nexcitable and cowardly) fled, and left my boy to face those\nfiends alone\u2014one white man alone among that horde of\nblack devils. He faced them cool, calm and smiling to\nthe last ! And they killed him. Then they looted all he\npossessed and deserted him. He was found lying dead\nand quite alone in the native Boma, and he was buried\nwith mihtary honours, and a Memorial Cross erected to\nmark the spot where a hero fell \" For God, for King and\nfor Country.\" . . . He had been all through the war in\nFrance and Flanders and was wounded at Passchendael,\nbefore he finally got transferred to the Kjng's African\nRifles, and was sent out to East Africa and given the\nentire command of the Expedition to the Northern District\nFrontier.\nOn October 7, 1920, Mrs. Dawson-Smith had her first\nsitting with Mrs. Leonard, The appointment was made\n\f300 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PAllT\nanonymously through Su- Oliver Lodge. On January 10,\n1921, she had a second (also anonymous) sitting ;\nshe was\naccompanied on this occasion by her daughter, Miss Madge\nDawson-Smith. At both sittings a certain amount of\nevidential matter was obtained of the type usually asso-\nciated with Mrs. Leonard's mediumship (together with some\nstatements which were incorrect or confused), but by far\nthe most striking incident was one which occurred at the\nsecond sitting. I will quote first several extracts from the\nrecords of the two sittings, showing evidence of super-\nnormal knowledge, and will then give in detail the incident\nreferred to. The notes of the two sittings were made by\nMrs. Dawson-Smith ; the comments are taken from letters\nshe wrote either to Sir Oliver Lodge or to his Secretary.\nExtracts from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, October 7, 1920.\nSitter and Recorder : Mrs. Dawson-Smith.\nFedA. The communicator says : \" Have you got the snap-\nshots ?\n\"\nMks. D.-S. I have those you sent me before you passed over.\nF. He says :\n\" Ah, but there are more to come. Will\nyou remember what I say ? You will laugh over\nit and I want you to laugh. Don't forget it. I\nfeel strongly you will get it and you will see what\nI mean. I am taken in such a funny position.\" . . .\n[Note 1.]\nHe calls you by a funny name (more whispering, \" No,\nno, not that \"). He must mean Mum. Not\u2014well,\nbut the other is nothing. (Pause.) He says he\ncalled you Moth\u2014that spells \" moth \" (pronouncing\nas written), but he says, \" No, no, ask her, she\nknows, don't you, Moth ?\n\"\nMrs. D.-S. It is short for mother.\nP. Just a piece of a word. He says, \" Yes, a piece of\nmother,\" and he laughs. . . . [Note 2.]\nHe keeps calhng, \" Eric, Geoff.\" (Feda shouted the\ntAvo names.) And Eric!

His name and a date\u2014and he likes\nwhat you have put on it. He says, \" Something\nelse is being done w^hich you will know soon, not a\nprivate one but a public one.\" . . . [Note 5.]\nNotes by Mrs. Dawson-Smith.\n1. The above was verified in December, 1921, when a\nbrother officer brought two packages my son had left. In\none was a packet of films and some prints. I laughed\nwhen I saw the one he evidently meant me to notice.\nIt was a snapshot of him surf- bathing on the coast at\nKismayu, and he was taken at an awkward moment and\ncertainly would not have wUlingly posed for a photograph\nin the state of \" nature unadorned \" in which he appeared\nwith a broad grin as he emerged from the surf. [See also\nfurther incident concerning photographs in second sitting.]\n2. Feda wrote \"Moth \"^ and then stopj)ed and said that\nwas nothing, until I suggested it was part of my own\nname. My boy always called me \" Moth \" (pronounced\nMuth). In writing to me he called me Mother.\n3. Eric was a boy who passed over 15 years ago\u2014\na\nvery dear and close friend of my boy's.

You\nwere touching it the other day. As you moved\nabout, you touched the key. And there was an\nold purse with a receipt in it, a tiny paper. It\nfeels old.

He will be so\ninterested. He knows you have it, a long narrow\nstrap close to it. \"I noticed that accidentally.\"\nHe says this is important.\nIn sending the record of the sitting to Sir Oliver Lodge\non January 15, 1921, Mrs. Dawson-Smith remarked in\nregard to the above statement that it was \" correct.\"\nSubsequently, nearly four years later, she wrote to Sir\nOliver Lodge as follows :\nNovember 23, 1924.\nI think you will be interested to hear of another fulfilled\nprophecy. [Mrs. Dawson-Smith then proceeds to quote the\nextract from her sitting of Januar}^ 10, 1921, as given\nabove.] .\n\f304 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nI liiuitecl for this pa]3er, aiad over a big trunk in our\nbox-room I noticed a long strap hanging. I opened the\nbox and hunted through the contents and came across a\nworn old leather purse, and in it a worn old counterfoil\nof a money order. I carefully took it out and put it in\nmy desk, thinking the importance might be found later.\nAnd true ! The following explains :\nT had a letter from the \" Enemy Debt Clearing Office\n\"\ndemanding a sum of money said to be owing to a Ham-\nburg firm, which was incurred in July, 1914\u2014before the\nwar. I knew my boy had paid it, as I remembered how\nanxious he was to send the money before war was declared,\nas he owed it and wanted to pay as a jwint of honour.\nSo I wrote to the Controller and explained that the\naccount had been paid ten years ago. Then the Hamburg\npeople said they had not received it, and if I had no\nproof other than my memory, it would be pressed (the\nclaim). Theri I remembered my boy's message at Mrs.\nLeonard's and I hastened to look at the counterfoil and\nfound it the identical paper needed to prove the account\nhad been paid. Needless to say I sent a complete account\nof the transaction to the Controller, and he of course\nverified it in every particular, and wrote to apologise for\nhaving caused me so much worry and trouble, and to say\nno further action would be taken in the matter. . . .\nKatie Dawson-Smith.\nLater Mrs. Sidgwick, to whom Sir Oliver Lodge had\nsent a report of the incident, wrote to Mrs. Dawson-Smith,\nasking whether it would be possible \" to send us for in-\nspection the correspondence with the '\nEnemy Debt\nClearing Office,' and, if you still have it, the counterfoil\nitself.\"\nOn December 4, 1924, Mrs. Dawson-Smith sent to Mrs.\nSidgwick the counterfoil and two letters from the \" Enemy\nDebt Clearing Office.\" Concerning these documents Mrs.\nSidgwick writes as follows in a note dated December 9,\n1924 : .\nMrs. Dawson-Smith has shown us the counterfoil, which\nis a \" Certificate of Issue of a Money Order \" numbered\n\f99] Sittings ivith Mrs. Leonard. 305\n2793 aud partible at Hamburg Cro.sslxusle], CJL-iiiiauy.

These\nare sufficient to show that a claim was made against Mrs.\nDawson-Smith by one August Foekelmann, Hamburg,\nthrough the Clearing Office, for a sum in the neighbour-\nhood of \u00a38 due since 1914, and that after some corre-\nspondence the Clearing House abandoned the claim alto-\ngether and regretted any inconvenience that might have\nbeen caused to her.\nThe above-mentioned documents have been read by Sir\nOliver Lodge as well as by myself.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nIt will be seen that at the time of the sitting with\nMrs. Leonard on January 10, 1921, the only circumstances\nrelating to this incident of which Mrs. Dawson-Smith had\ndefinite knowledge were (a) that her son had incurred a\ndebt with a German firm, and (b) that he had paid the\ndebt shortly before the war. The exact description of the\nplace in which the counterfoil was to be found certainly\nsuggests that the communicator's memory was the source\nof the knowledge shown. The emphasis laid upon the\nimportance of the counterfoil, though interesting in view\nof the sequel, does not seem to imply any more exact\nknowledge of the future than would be within the scope\nof any person who had the circumstances of the case\nclearly in his mind. Obviously it might be of importance\nto be able to prove payment of such a debt, and docu-\nmentary proof was therefore worth preserving.\nOn February 24, 1922, Mrs. and Miss Dawson-Smith had\na sitting with Mrs. Brittain at which a good deal of\nevidence of supernormal knowledge was shown, although\n\fI\n306 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nlittle concerning matters unknown to Ijotli sitters. I give\nsome extracts from this sitting below, together with Mrs.\nDawson-Smith's comments. These were contained in a\nletter to Mrs. Sidgwick dated December 8, 1924. Mrs.\nDawson-Smith states that the appointment with Mrs.\nBrittain was made through a friend \" quite anonymously.\nMrs. Brittain did not know our names nor from what\npart of the country we came.\" Concerning the record of\nthe sitting she states that \" my daughter (Madge) and I\nboth wrote, she in shorthand.\"\nExtracts from Sittmg with Mrs. Brittain, February 24, 1922.\nSitters : Mrs. and Miss Dawson-Smith (both recording).\nMrs. Britt.mn. . . .

[Note 7.]\nNotes by Mrs. Dawson-Smith.\n1. My boy [Frank] had a dear chum called Geoff who\nwas killed in a flying accident in England, before he could\nbe sent to France. This was in 1917. Not only are the\nnames given correctly, but the fact that it was an acci-\ndent\u2014not killed on active service. [See also Leonard\nsitting, p. 300 above, for the name Geoff.]\n2. My son was in sole command of the native troops on\nthe Northern Frontier District (Abyssinian Frontier) of East\nAfrica, and he was killed by the treachery of one of his\nown men after signing a Peace Treaty.\n3. My daughter was an Officer in the W.A.A.C. in France\nand was mentioned in despatches by Sir Douglas Haig for\ngallant conduct in the field.\n4. The description of my boy Frank is exceedingly good\nand easily recognisable by all who knew him.\n\f308 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PAET\n5. This I'cfei'.s Lo a liUlc joke my buy and girl had in\nwhich they always spoke the magic words and beat the\ntime on their knees.\n6. The case in question contained two hippo feet and\nsome animal skins. It was given in charge of a brother\nofficer of my boy's who brought it to England and left it\nat the cloak room at King's Cross, where it remained\nunclaimed with the labels torn off. I traced it thus far,\nonly to find 1 was a month too late, as it had been sold\nby auction as unclaimed property. The officer, Captain\n[Nigel MackintosK] had returned home on sick leave, and\nhe died at his home in Scotland before he could let me\nknow about the case he had brought. His mother wrote\nafter his death and told me all she knew.\n7. That is a brief paragraph and not written entire\nbecause we thought the sitting was over and Belle had\ngone. We had put our pencils and notebooks away and\nsat quietly waiting for the medium to awake. What\nfollowed was this :\nMrs. Brittain opened her eyes and suddenly stared over\nmy shoulder, looking startled and alarmed. I was sitting\nin a low chair facing her. She said with a gasp, \" Oh !\ndon't growl like that\u2014oh how dreadful !\n\" Then she grew\ncalmer and said, \" Have you a St. Bernard dog ? It is a\nbig one. He died of distemper.\" My daughter at once\nsaid, \" No, we haven't had a St. Bernard. Our dog is an\nAiredale.\" Mrs. Brittain instantly said, \" You never saw\nhim ; it was long before you were born. The dog is\nstanding by Mother\u2014he loves her and is very jealous of\neverybody who goes near her.\"\nThis was all perfectly correct. We had a St. Bernard,\nand he died of distemper when my boy was four months\nold. The dog was devoted to me and to my baby\n(Frank) but would not allow anybody to come near us.\nKatie Dawson-Smith.\nIn August, 1925, I sent a draft of my report on this\ncase to Mrs. Dawson-Smith, asking for a corroborative\nstatement from Miss Dawson-Smith concerning such points\nas came within her knowledge. I also pointed out that\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 309\n.since at the- sitting with Mrs. Leonard on J;uiu;iry 10,\n1921, and at the sitting with Mrs. Brittain on Febrnary\n24, 1922, there seemed to be alhisions to Miss Dawson-\nSmith's work in the W.A.A.C., it woukl be well to state\nwhether she attended the sittings in uniform, and I asked\nfor some further information concerning the extent of Mrs.\nDawson-Smith's knowledge about the \" missing case \" at\nthe time of the sitting with Mrs. Brittain. I received in\nreply the following corroborative statement attached by\nMiss Dawson-Smith to the report of the sittings as printed\nabove :\n.\nI have read the following report and certify it is correct\nin every particular. r,\nM. Daavson-Smith.\nI also received a letter from Mrs. Dawson-Smith, dated\nSeptember 1, 1925, from which I quote the following\nextracts :\n. . . My girl (Madge) was not in uniform on either\noccasion. She always wore mufti in England.\n... I had been trying to trace the missing case, but\nI had no real clue to go upon beyond the fact that I\nhad the letter from [Nigel MackintosJis] mother, after his\ndeath, telling me of his passing and long serious illness,\nwhen he had been too suffering to inform her of the case\nof which he had taken charge, and had merely said he\nleft it at \" the cloak room.\" I did not know even where\nthe cloak room was ! As far as I can recollect I was only\nthus far on my quest when I went to Mrs. Brittain and\nasked about the missing case. I then made further en-\nquiries, writing to all the London Termini with the de-\nscription given by \" Belle,\" and after long waiting I ran it\nto earth at the King's Cross Lost Luggage Depot and\nlearned that \" a case as I had described had been sold at\ntheir recent sale of unclaimed property.\" So that ended\nmy search, and but for \" Belle's \" close description I\nshould never have found out what had become of my\nboy's trophies. I suppose that when she said I should\n\"find the case\" she meant I should discover what had\nhappened\n.\n\f310 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nWith reference to my comment upon the coimterfoil\nincident that \" the enipliasis laid upon tlie importance of\nthe counterfoil . . . does not seem to imply any more exact\nknowledge of the future than would be within the scope\nof any person who had the circumstances of the case\nclearly in his mind \" (see above, p. 305), Mrs. Dawson-Smith\nwrites in the same letter :\nI think my boy knew what would happen and wanted\nto help me over the worry. He knew, of course, that as\nthe wife of a poor country clergyman I have to practise\nrigid economy, and the sum claimed, although to many\nwould be a trifle, to me it would demand many anxious\nmoments of i3lanning and contriving and ultimately some\nsacrifice to obtain. So, with his love and dear thought\nof sparing \" Mother \" if he could, he paved the way for\nme to meet the claim and so ease my burden of worry. . . .\nKatie Dawson-Smith.\n\u00a7 2. MISS DALLAS'S SITTINGS.\nI give below a record of two sittings with Mrs. Leonard\nsent to me by Miss H. A. Dallas, who was the sitter.\nIn the first case a young man purported to communicate\nwhom at the time of the sitting Miss Dallas was quite\nunable to identify ; he was subsequently identified by his\nbrother, referred to here as C. B. Vince7it (pseudonym),\nfrom the statements made at the sitting, Miss Dallas\nhaving at the time no acquaintance with this brother\nor with any other members of the young man's family.\nThe first information I had of the case was contained in\na letter from Miss Dallas, written on January 15, 1924,\nenclosing her notes of her sitting with Mrs. Leonard\nand a statement as to knowledge subsequently acquired.\nMiss Dallas asked me to return these notes, but offered\nto send me an account of the incident, with corroborative\nevidence, if I thought the matter worth recording. I\nreplied that I should be glad to have a record of the\ncase, and on February 13, 1924, Miss Dallas wrote to me\nagain enclosing the following statement :\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 311\nOn Oct. 4, 1923, I had a trance sitting with IVIrs.\nOsborne Leonard, and in the course of this Feda described\na j^oung man whom I could not recognise. I noted every\ndetail carefully ; I was at a loss as to how to identify\nhim. My only clue was the one word \" Manchester,\"\nuttered by Feda in this connection.\nA day or two before this interview I had received a\nletter from a complete stranger and it bore the postmark\n\" Manchester.\"\nI wrote to my correspondent, therefore, and mentioned\nthat I had been given the description of a flying man\ncalled \" Jack \" ; I added one or two details. She replied\nthat she was not able to identify him, but that she had\nshown my letter to a friend who had called to see her\nand that the details I had mentioned were claimed by him\nas applicable to his brother. I then copied my notes\nfully, asking him for a definite answer on each point, as\nfollows. I also asked for his [that is the dead brother's]\nphotograph to examine. He sent me three photographs.\nStatements made.\n1. A young man.\n2. Specially nice-looking.\n3. Rather tall.\n4. Strongly built.\n5. Well-proportioned.\n6. Square face.\n7.

Unverifiable.\nI need only add the affirmation that T had no know-\nledge of the existence of any of Jack's family, and that\nthe only clue which led me to enquire was the one word\n\" Manchester.\"\nH. A. Dallas.\nIn a subsequent letter Miss Dallas offered to obtain from\n\"Jack's\" brother, Mr. C. B. Vincent (pseudonym), a state-\nment as to his having had no previous acquaintance either\nwith Miss Dallas herself or with Mrs. Leonard. Mr.\nVincent wrote as follows :\nFeb. 20, 1924.\n1 wish to state that I had never met or corresponded\nwith Miss Dallas before her interview with Mrs. Osborne\nLeonard in October, 1923.\nI have never met or corresponded with Mrs. Leonard up\nto the present, nor had I ever heard of her before.\nC. B. [VINCENTl\nI questioned Miss Dallas as to what knowledge of\n\" Jack's \" family or of the circumstances of his death her\ncorrespondent in Manchester had had, and also whether\nthere had been any allusion to \" Jack \" in the letter\nreceived by Miss Dallas a few days before the sitting.\nMiss Dallas replied thus :\nFeb. 23, 1924.\n... I think that my correspondent (Miss Burrows)\nmust certainly have known the circumstances of \" Jack's\n\"\ndeath, as his brother and his wife had been friends of hers\nfor about two j-ears, but I do not know whether it had\noccurred to her that the letter might ajjply. I did not\ngive full details in that first letter. I can ask her, if you\nlike, and I can also ask her to send me a note to the\n\f314 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\neffect that she had not mentioned \" Jack \" in her letter\nto me. Miss Burrows' letter arrived just before I went up\nto town, and to the best of my memory I had not yet\nanswered it when I visited Mrs. Leonard on the following\nday.\nH. A. Dallas.\nConcerning the points mentioned above Miss Burrows\nwrote to me thus :\nlOth March, 1924.\nI wish to say that in my first letter to Miss Dallas I\ndid not mention either Jack [Vincent] or any of his\npeople ; and not until after Miss Dallas had sent the\nnotes did I tell her of the [Vincents]. Previous to my\nthird letter to Miss Dallas they were entirely unknown\nto her.\nSarah Emily Burrows.\nMiss Dallas also sent me the photograph of \" Jack \"\nwhich is referred to above, and I verified the details\nmentioned in the sitting. The description seemed to me\nquite good.\nMiss Dallas endeavoured in November, 1923, to obtain\nsome further communication from \" Jack \" through her\nfriend, Miss Bazett, and Miss Bazett has been kind enough\nto send us a record of the impressions she received.\nThere is some evidence in this record of information super-\nnormally acquired, but there is also a good deal of con-\nfusion and misstatement, so that I have not thought it\nworth while to quote the record here.\nThe second case contributed |\nby Miss Dallas is as follows :\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, September 13, 1920.\nSitter and Recorder : Miss H. A. Dallas.\nPeda. a gentleman, elderly, a little bent, cheek bones show,\neyebrows with long hairs, good forehead, good\nshaped head, rather thin hair on top, grey. W\nwill lighten the burden of material conditions. (Here\nintervened apparent reference to a personal matter,\nperhaps suggested by the word \" burden \" ; this\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 315\nseems to have nothing to do with the above). Still\nsomething they have to do in removing limitations.\nHe is interested in your writings, a new book, new\npeople broiight into touch, old conditions droppinf\naway, a new lead to help people.\nNote by Miss Dallas.\nI did not recognise the description as applicable to\nany one I know. The mention of a \" new book \" re-\nminded me of the MS. of a \" Manual of Prayers for the\nBereaved \" which I had tried to get published ; but the\npublishers did not care to undertake it, and \" material\nconditions \" did not admit of my publishing it at my own\nexpense, so I had accepted the \" limitation \" which these\nconditions imposed, and had put the idea of publishing\nquite aside for the present. A few weeks later I saw a\nrequest in Light for a prayer that could be used for the\nDeparted and wrote to that Journal (Oct. 6), offering to\nlend my MS. to any one who would care to see it. Several\napplicants wrote to me and among others a gentleman\nwhose first name was Walter ; he asked to see the MS.\nwith a view to publication. I did not quite understand\nwhat that might mean, so I wrote explaining that I had\nnot been able to secure a publisher. He then wrote again\noffering to take the MS. and publish at his own expense.\nThis surprisingly generous offer has been carried out. I\nnoted that his name began with W and when I saw him\nI observed that he answered to the description Feda had\ngiven to me ; I remarked to him that she had said that\nhis eyebrows were long-haired (this was not noticeable), he\nreplied : \"I have to cut them sometimes.\" He removed\n\" the material conditions \" which hindered the publication\nof this new effort \" to help people \" by financing the\nproject, and when I paid him a visit to talk over matters\nI was brought into contact with a circle of \" new people,\"\nto whom at his request I gave an address on psychical\nmatters. At a later date I found that I had a book on\nmy shelf in which this gentleman was mentioned in con-\nnection with a psychical experience ; I have no recollection\nof ever having read this, and wlien I received his letter\nX\n\fMrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nI did not recall the book or recognise his name. I\nsubjoin extracts from two letters received from him and\nfrom Mrs. Leonard in reply to enquiries from me as to\nwhether they had ever met.\nExtract from Letter from Mr. Waller [Jo7ics] (jjseudonym).\nFeb. 21.21.\nYour letter Feb. 16th duly received ; in reply I have\nnever (to my knowledge) met Mrs. Osborne Leonard.\nWalter [JONES].\nExtract from Letter from Mrs. Osborne Leonard.\nFeb. 23.21.\nI have no knowledge whatever of Mr. W. [Jones] of\nWorcestershire. Of course he may have come to me\nanonymously . . . but I have no knowledge of him at\nall. It is always a pleasure to me to answer anything\nof this kind. Evidence is most important.\nGladys Leonard.\nFurther Statement by Miss Dallas.\nIn order to make clear the significance of the next\nincident in the trance a brief statement is necessary as to\nmatters which preceded it :\nDurmg the war I made the acquaintance of a widow,\nMrs. Raymond D., whose husband had recently died from\nwounds received, and who was in great distress ; the result of\nour meeting was that she experimented carefully and with\nmoderation, and received communications she was able to\nverify, and which convinced her that her husband was in touch\nwith her and their children. Her own psychic faculties, and\nthose of the sister who experimented with her, were evidently\nvery strong. It was delightful to notice the change in her\noutlook, and the effect was so marked that her Vicar told\nme he regarded her as the best instance he had seen of\nthe value of attempting this sort of intercourse with the\nDeparted.\nOn May 5, 1918, Mrs. D. wrote to me saying that she\nhad been told (through table tilts) that her husband knew\nRaymond Lodge, and on July 5 of the same year the\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 317\ntable tilts, when spelt out, read : \"I know medium\nGladys.\" This seems to have been in reply to a question\nshe put a few days previously, asking her husband if he\ncould find a medium he would like her to visit. Mrs. D.\ndid not recollect any medium of that name and asked,\n\"Can you tell us more?\" \"No.\" \"Shall we ask Miss\nDaUas?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is the medium Gladys on your\nside ?\n\" \" Yes, guide.\"\nThese questions show that Mrs. D. had no conscious\nknowledge of the medium referred to.\nAt the tune I received her enquu-y I did not recall the\nfact that Gladys is Mrs. Leonard's name ; but I was with\nMrs. D. and her sister on July 18. We had a sitting\ntogether and after other communications the table tilted :\n\"Raymond thanks H. A. D.\" Then (for no obvious\nreason) I remembered vaguely that Gladys is Mrs.\nLeonard's Christian name, and I remarked that I thought\nthis was so; the table tilted \"Yes.\" \"Did you hear\nof her through Raymond Lodge ?\n\" \" Yes.\"\nWe then spoke of Mrs. Leonard and our thoughts\nwandered from the table until they were recalled by it\ntilting agam and spelling. \" Y gone ?\n\" It appeared\nthat we had broken the connection in much the same\nway as if we had hung up the telephone receiver ! Com-\nmunications of some interest connected with the war were\nthen resumed.\nAfter this Mrs. D. secured an appointment with Mrs.\nLeonard, Sept. 7, 1918, arranged anonymously by myself.\nOn this occasion she received a good description of her\nhusband and among other things Feda said : \"He tried\nto get through to you in two ways, through some one else\nand through you as Avell, tried to give message to some one,\nnot a professional ; you were afraid to take message through\nH, H, H (?), trymg to get through to H to send message.\nHe is leavuig no stone unturned to try to get into touch.\"\nMrs. D. writes :\nThere -was a great deal more which was most\nconvincing to me. . . . You know that I was not\nfully convmced. ... I do not think Mrs. Leonard\nat that time knew that I k]if>w yon.\n\f318 Mrs. IF. \/\/. Salter. [part\n3Iiss Dallas's Statement Continued.\nAs I made the appointment she probably inferred that\nI knew her (Mrs. D.), but this remark in Mrs. D.'s letter\nshows that she herself made no allusion to me at the sitting.\nMiss Dallas then goes on to suggest that the allusion in\nMrs. D.'s sitting to her husband having tried to \" get\nthrough ... in two ways \" refers to a sitting Miss Dallas\nherself had had on August 29, 1918, with Miss Violet\nOrtner (Mrs. Warren Elliott), at which Mrs. D.'s husband\nhad purported to communicate. Miss Dallas has sent us\nthe following extract from her record of the sitting :\nMrs. Waeeen Elliott. Raymond lias just appeared. I hear,\n\" Raymond is here.\" [Do you know] Raymond\nLodge ?\n(My note has only the names \" Raymond Lodge,\"\nbut, if I remember riglit, she put the remark in\nthe form of a question.)\nH. A. D. There is anotber Raymond I know.\nMks. W. E. Is tliere a distant connexion ? And somehow\nmarriage is mixed with it.\nHe sends a message to thank you for the help\nyou gave him.\nH. A. D. He lias done that before. I am very glad.\nMks. W. E. Will you send his people his love ? They are not\nleaving a stone unturned ; their efforts will be\nsuccessful. He is surjirised at the change which has\ntaken place and is grateful to you. If there is\nanything he can do for you, he will do it.\nWith regard to the reference to marriage Miss Dallas\nnotes that this was correct, as Mrs. D. is a distant\nconnexion of hers by marriage. She also called attention\nto the verbal correspondence between Mrs. D.'s sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard on September 7, 1918, and her own\nsitting with Mrs. Warren Elliott on August 29, 1918, in\nthe allusion to \" leaving no stone unturned.\"\nWe may now return to Miss Dallas's sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard on September 13, 1920. of which Miss Dallas\nhas sent us tlic following rocoi'd :\n\f'\u2022'] SiUings with Mrs. Leonard. 319\nFiirlhcr E.rinu:l.

This is slightly\nmisplaced, it occurs about half-way down. Only two\nnames beginning with M appear, and one is Marshall.\nTwo names, Broclchurst and Church Stretton, occur in this\nconnection ; neither of them are associated with both \\\npersons, but Brockenhurst has association with both the\ncommunicator and his wife.\n(h) On enquiry I found that Mr. De Brath had thought\nof writing, but not to ask a question. R. D.'s wife has i\nbeen in communication with Mr. De Brath, so R. D.\nmight be likely to know him. His name, Stanley, occurred\nin the Times at the spot indicated.\nThe last Times test in this series I could not verify.\nIn reply to an enquiry from me as to whether Miss\nDallas had mentioned the name Marguerite at her sitting\non September 13, 1920, she wrote to me as follows :\n\f99] Sitti)ig'^ tvtlh Mr.s. Lcoitard. 321\nJuly 5, l'J24.\n... I certainly did not mention the name Marguerite\nin this connection in Mrs. Leonard's presence, before Feda\nmentioned it. I am sure of this for two reasons : first\nbecause I am very cautious about giving away what\nmight spoil evidence, and if I occasionally make a slip\nI always notice it and regret it afterwards ;\nsecondly\nbecause, as I never have called Mrs. D. by her Christian\nname when addressing her, or S]3eaking of her to others,\nit would not be likely that I should use it inadvertently.\nWhether the name may have been mentioned in one of\nMrs. D.'s sittings I cannot say . . .\nH. A. Dallas.\nSubsequently I wrote to Mrs. D. to ask whether tlie\nname had occurred at any sitting she had had with Mrs.\nLeonard before September 13, 1920. There was some\ndelay in getting an answer, owing to illness in Mrs. D.'s\nfamily ;\neventually she wrote to me as follows :\n10.3.26.\n... In answer to your question about my name\u2014I had\na sitting with Mi-s.

I had arranged\nto have tea that afternoon with a lady from the United\nStates. When she arrived she brought with her a lady\nwho was quite a stranger to me, and not expected. In\nthe course of conversation I learned that she is the god-\ndaughter of the friend who had just communicated through\nFeda.\n\u00a7 3. EVIDENCE OBTAINED BY MRS. DRUMMOND i\nAND MRS. LE BLANC SMITH.\nMrs. Drummond, as she is called here, is a Member of\nthe Society who has had a considerable number of sittings\nwith Mrs. Leonard, at which her son Ian and her husband\nhave purj)orted to communicate. Incidents previously re-\nported to us by Mrs. Drummond have been printed in the\nS.P.R. Journal (Vol. XX. p. 128 and p. 398).\nIn May, 1923, Mrs. Drum.mond sent me an extract from\na sitting she had had with Mrs. Leonard on January 3,\n1923, with the following covering letter :\n25tli May, 1923.\nIs the enclosed incident of interest to you ? The type-\nwritten notes were sent to me by Mr. W. {Brown'] (pseu-\ndonym) with permission to send them to you. He is very\nemphatic that his identity should not be disclosed and he\nchose his own pseudonym. I don't think he is satisfied\nwith any evidence he has had throiigh Mrs. Leonard or\nany other medium.\nL. D. [DRUMMOND].\nWhen I sent the proof of this part of my report to\nMrs. Drummond m the early spring of 1926, she told me\n^ Pseudonym.\n\f99] Siifings ivith. Mrs. Leonard. 323\ntliat she lie]ieved tJiere T\\onld now be no objection to\nrevealing the fact that the jjerson referred to above as\nMr. Brown was in fact the late Mr. William Archer.\nAt Mrs. DrummoncVs suggestion I wrote to Mrs. William\nArcher and obtained from her and from Mr. William\nArcher's Executor, Colonel Archer, permission to publish\nthe name in this rejDort. Some of our Members will be\naware that at a meeting of the Society held on February\n18, 1926, a paper was read by Dr. William Brown, which\nincluded a report on some sittings with Mrs. Leonard at\nwhich Mr. William Archer had purported to communicate.\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 3, 1923.\nSitter and Recorder : Mrs. Drummond.\nFeda. You were thinking of [Archer'\\.\nL. D. D. Yes.\nF, And he [Ian] says, \" I see his boy over here many\n\"times and you know he helps his father to write,\nnot automatically, but to write things ; his father is\na clever man and he writes not only stories but\nplays, and his boy has been trying lately to write\nsomething very special with him, but it was founded\non some old matter of a long time ago which his\nfather had not used but has been thinking of using\nlately. Do you think you could let him know ?\nHe does know, but he wants telling, it is rather\nimportant. Just lately he has been going back and\nusing up some material that he had a good many\nyears ago, and now he has an idea of making\nsomething of it and his boy is very interested in it.\"\nNote by Mr. Archer.\nOn the very day of this sitting (January 3, 1923) I was\non the other side of tiie Atlantic, working at a play\nfounded on an Elizabethan subject (\" some old matter of\na long time ago \") which I had had in my mind ever\nsince 1920, but had begun to put in form only in November\nlast {\" just lately he had been going back and using iip\nsome material that he had a good many years ago\nThe references to this play are therefore exactly accurate ;\n\f324 Mrs. ir. \/\/. Sailer. [part\nand iiicy arc rendered all the mure curious by the faot\nthat I had never spoken to any human being of my in-\ntention of writing a play on this subject. I have had\nseveral sittings with Mrs. Leonard (the latest in August\n1922), but I am pretty sure she does not know my name.\nEven if she does, any telepathic explanation of this incident\nwould presuppose a power on Mrs. Leonard's part to read\n(at great distances) my unspoken intentions, and to ascer-\ntain what, at a given period, I was worldng at\u2014a matter\nquite unknown even to the people immediately around me.\nAt one of Mrs. Drummond's later Leonard sittings a\nreference, which proved veridical, was made to Mr. and\nMrs. Le Blanc Smith and their son Ralph. Mr. and Mrs.\nLe Blanc Smith have had numerous sittings with Mrs.\nLeonard, at which their son has purported to communicate,\nand evidential statements have been made.\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, February 14, 1924.\nSitter and Recorder : Mrs. Drummond.\nP'eda. Ian says :\n\" Ralph, I've been with him of course.\"\nL. D. D. What were you doing ?\nF. \" Yes, trying to help some one. I have got a little\njob to do with you, Mum. Ralph wants it.\"\nL. 1). D. What is it i.\nV. Oh, not exactly to get messages, but to lick something\ninto shape for him. Not a nice way to say \" lick,\"\nIan. \" You'll understand soon, but I think you\nought to have known already, something they\n(Ralph's people] want you to do. I can impress\nyou and help you about it and I am going to do\nit, something they want you to do with somebody\nelse for them, not psychic material, but about a\npsychic thing,\" he says, and he approves, and he\nwill help you in the aforesaid licldng process.\nL. D. D. Ralph wants me to help ?\nF. Yes, they were talking about it yesterday, I don't\nmean here, at home, and they were saying that they\nwould be so pleased if you could do it for them,\nbecause they don't ]<now the correct procedure, so\n\f99] Sittings -with Mrs. Leonard. 325\nI suppose you will sooii know about it, even if you\ndon't know now, and lie says, \" Yes, I bet you\nwill.\" Mr. Arthur [Mrs. Drummond's husband] is\nvery interested and keeps nodding his head and\nsaying \"good.\" It is not a lot of trouble, but Ian\nsays, \" I expect I will have to help you with it.\"\nShortly after the sitting Mrs. Drummond wrote to Mrs.\nLe Blanc Smith to ask whether the above references had\nany meaning for her. To this enquiry Mrs. Le Blanc\nSmith replied as follows: 7 o\n^ March 3, 1924.\nThank you so very much for your very kind letter. I\nknow exactly what Ian means. I said the other day I\nwanted very much to send you some information Ralph\ngave me at a sitting which I had no knowledge of and\nwhich I found was right in every particular, and that\nI wanted you very much, if you thought the test good\nenough, to send it to the S.P.R.\nWe further talked of you in this way another time, and\nI said how very much I Avanted to find some friend\n(especially a psychic one, if possible) who woiTld call on a\ngreat friend of mine who is going to live at Hensham,\nand somebody said, \" Doesn't [Mrs. Drummond'] live in\nSussex ? It would be splendid if she would.\" But of\ncourse you are miles and miles away, but Ian may have\ngot that too, and \" miles \" don't count with them. It is\nvery good, isn't it ? I will write out the sitting and take\nit over to the old woman whose relations (dead years and\nyears ago) it concerns and get her to sign her replies to\nit. She is over 80 and nearly blind, and the information\nis all correct as far as it goes.\nI think that Ian telling you I wanted to ask you this\nis a very good test, don't you ? Because I said it here\njust casually to my husband and Mrs. D who was\nstaying here then. I never thought of or mentioned it at\nMrs. Leonard's. ... ^ \u201e\nB.

She gave my children their first lessons, and \"Ralph,\"\nmy elder son, killed near Ypres on 26th November,\n1915, was very fond of her. She was their daily\ngoverness, and I never knew anything of her people, who\nwere dead before I knew her, beyond the fact that they\nhad been very respectable old-fashioned farmers. Some\nyears ago my son Ralph through a table sitting at Mrs.\nLeonard's asked me to go and tell \" M. F.\", as he called\nher, about spiritualism. He added, \"I've prepared her, it\nwill be all right, she'll understand.\" I went very reluc-\ntantly, but she was indeed \" prepared \" and took the\ndeepest interest in it, and it has been the joy and conso-\nlation of her lonely old age, with no relation or old friend\nliving, debarred from books by her almost complete blind-\nness. She is always happy and cheerful, full of confidence\nand hope in the future life.\nI had never heard she had an uncle, or any particulars\nabout her people, and knew nothing of the photos men-\ntioned.\nE.vtract from Sitting ivith Mrs. Leonard, December 4, 1923.\nPresent : Mr. and Mrs. Le Blanc Smith.\nFeda, Ralj)h says there is a lady here belongs to M.

I give first Miss Newton's coijy of an\nextract from Mrs. Fernald's notes of a sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard. The sitter on this occasion was Mrs. Fernald's\nhusband, Mrs. Fernald herself acting as recorder ; the\nostensi1>le communicator is their son.\n\f328 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, March 6, 1925.\nFeda. The young one's mind is divided between two places\n\u2014very interested in your being here and in another\nplace away from London. A curved part of the\ncoast, near the sea\u2014ships. He's very fond of this\nplace. You will be reminded of this place by\nhaving it put in front of you very soon. A ship-\nping place, used as a port\u2014an island close to it.\nHe shows me you holding something in your hand\n\u2014a paper or narrow book with printing or pictures.\nAs if you opened it suddenly and are suddenly re-\nminded of this port. You'll see it before you go,\nbut you'll go. Even within a few hours you'll be\nreminded of it. An island that you'll be reminded\nof. That's what it is. An island, and that is what\nit is called.\nNote by Miss Newton.\nMarch 30, 1925.\nMrs. Fernald read the notes of the sitting to me on\nMarch 9, 1925. She told me then that she had no doubt\nat all that the place described was San Francisco, a place\nher son was exceedingly fond of, near where they have a\nhouse overlooking the bay and Angel Island, one of three\nislands in the bay. She also told me that Feda had\nseemed to be trying to give the name of an island, and\nnot succeeding had concluded with \" Well, an island it is,\nand an island it's called.\"\nTo-day, March 30, Mrs. Fernald brought me [a] packet\nas she had received it. It consisted of five Sections, or\nNumbers, of Progressive California in Botagravure, issued\nby the San Francisco Chronicle, all dated March 11, 1925.\nSection E was placed first, and on opening the packet one\nwould be confronted by the picture on the cover, which\nwas a reproduction, 12^ by 10 inches, of a photogi-aph of a\n])art of San Francisco Bay showing Angel Island. (See\nPlate III.) The publication may be described as \"a\npaper or narrow book with printing or pictures.\" It is\n16^ in. long, \\\\\\ in. wide, and eacli Section contains from\n\fPlate III.\n\f\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 329\n16-32 pages covered with small reproductions of photo-\ngraphs illustrating current events, with brief printed notes\nregarding them.\nThe date of the postmark on the packet is illegible.\nThe name of the sender, Miss Livermore, is written on the\nwrapper. Mrs. Fernald told me that she is a friend from\nwhom she hears \" once in a blue moon,\" and that the\npacket was entirely unexpected.\nIsabel Newton.\nStatement by Mrs. Fernald.\nMarch 31, 1925.\nOn Saturday, March 28, I received a tightly rolled\nparcel through the post. On opening the roll a full-page\npicture of a part of San Francisco Bay showing Angel\nIsland was the first thing I saw. Immediately I recalled\nFeda's words in our Leonard sitting of March 6. [Quota-\ntion from sitting follows, see above.]\nThe confirmation of Feda's words was so striking that\nI took the roll of \" papers or narrow books \" to Miss\nNewton on Monday, March 30, in the original wrapper, as\nit had come through the post. There were five illustrated\npamphlets in the roll, showing different Californian views.\nThe Angel Island view was on the top and the first one\nto be seen as the packet was unrolled. The date on the\npamphlet (a newspaj)er supplement) was March 11 \u2014five\ndays later than the Leonard sitting.\nJosephine H. Fernald.\nMiss Newton wrote on May 9, 1925, to the Business\nManager of the San Francisco Chronicle, asking upon\n\" what date Section E of Progressive California in Rota-\ngravure was first on sale and available to the public.\"\nThe following reply was received :\nMay 29, 1925.\nReplying to your letter of May 9 in reference to the\ndate of publication of the Progressive California in Rota-\ngravxire, I beg to advise that this number was put on sale\nto the public on March 11. Ho\\^ever, various sections of\n\f330 Mrs. IF. H. Walter. [part\nthis publiccation were printed in advance. For example,\nthe first section was printed on February 2 and another\non February 25. . . .\n\u201e \u201e . .\n,\ntsau J^ranctsco Chronicle,\nby C. E. GiLROY,\nPurchasing Agent.\nMrs. Fernald wrote to her friend Miss Livermore to\nask her to record the circumstances in which the copies\nof Progressive California were despatched. In reply Miss\nLivermore wrote to Miss Newton as follows :\nSan Francisco,\nApril 25, 1925.\nMrs. Fernald has asked me to write you exact data in\nthe matter of my sending her those views of San Francisco\nHarbour which came to her as such a coincidence after\nhaving had a description of them in a sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard.\nThey were published as a supplement to the Daily\nChronicle and were delivered with the regular paper on\nMarch 11.\nAt once on seeing the pictures I thought of three friends,\nall absent Californians, who would be interested in seeing\nthem. I left the papers lying on my desk for about a\nweek\u2014undecided as to whether to send them to a friend\nin Paris, or to one of two friends in London. I can't\ntell you the precise date of my sending. I woke up that\nmorning with a brisk and firm decision to send them to\nMrs. Fernald\u2014more to clear my desk than for any other\nreason.\nAnd this is all I can tell you about it. It seems a\nremarkable coincidence and I am very glad to have given\nMrs. Fernald this pleasure. -r, -r\n^ Edith Livermore.\nIn reply to a further enquiry as to the circumstances in\nwhich the statement at the sitting of March 6, 1925, was\nmade, Mrs. Fernald wrote to Miss Newton as follows :\nApril 6, 1925.\nI sliall take my notes of the sitting to you to-morrow\n\u2014you will see that Feda gives her information about Van\n\f99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 331\nD3'ke's [the communicator's] mind being divided between\ntwo places quite out of a clear sky. There was nothing\nto lead up to it. Neither my husband nor- I had spoken\na word during the sitting. I was writing my notes at\nthe time as fast as I could get the words down, as appar-\nently unmoved by any of Feda's statements as if I had\nbeen taking notes on a lecture. My husband sat like a\ngraven image through the whole of the two hours. We\nhad never spoken to any one about our proposed visit to\nMrs. Leonard. From the first it had seemed of paramount\nimportance to us both that no one should know that we\nwere going to her\u2014and to Miss Walker, Sir Oliver Lodge's\nSecretary, through whom the appointment was made, we\nwere known as Mr. and ]\\Irs. Eliot.\nJosephine H. Fernald.\nMiss Newton did not in fact see the notes when Mrs.\nFernald brought them to the Rooms in April, but she saw\nthem at a later date and has sent the following note :\nOctober 22, 1925.\nI have examined the notes taken at the sitting. There\nis nothing in thein that might appear to have led up to\nthe incident recorded, or to suggest that the sitter and\nnote-taker had any interest in America or in any other\nplace away from London.\nMrs. Fernald told me that she and her husband have\nlived in London since 1907.\nIsabel Newton.\nIt would therefore appear that at the time of the sitting\nMrs. Leonard had no reason to associate Mr. or Mrs.\nFernald with California, although it is possible that some-\nthing in their voice or manner may have led her to think\nthey were Americans. It is worth mentioning that since\n1898, Mr. and Mrs. Fernald have spent only three years\n(1903-1906) in America. I am told by people who have\nmet Mrs. Fernald that her connection with America is not\nimmediately apparent. Mr. Fernald, it will be observed,\ndid not speak at all during the sitting.\nIt should also be noted that the view of San Francisco\nBay which was reproduced on the cover of Progressive\n\f332 Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. [part\nCalifornia, and to which reference appears to be made at\nthe sitting, is not an obvious or typical view, not the\nkind of view that would be likely to be suggested to\nMrs. Leonard if she had somehow formed the idea that\nher sitters were Californians. The general sweep of the\nbay is not shown at all, whereas the island referred to at\nthe sitting is conspicuous. On the other hand the view\nhas special associations for Mr. and Mrs. Fernald. On\nthis point Mrs. Fernald writes :\nOctober 22, 1925.\nOur house is on a slope of Mount Tamalpais overlooking\nthe more northern part of San Francisco Baj^, which has\naltogether a length of fifty miles. The house was built\nfor the view\u2014the most conspicuous feature in the fore-\nground is Angel Island. The other t\\^-o islands in the\nbay cannot be seen from our house.\nJosephine H. Fernald.\nMiss Newton and Mr. Dingwall corroborate Mrs. Fernald's\nstatement as follows :\nOctober 22, 1925.\nMrs. Fernald has shown us snapshots taken at the house\nin California which confirm her statement that Angel\nIsland is a conspicuous feature in the view from the\nhouse.\nIsabel Newton.\nE. J. Dingwall.\n\fReviews. 333\nREVIEWS.\nI.\nDer Okkultismus in Urkunden. Hrsg. von J\\Iax Dessoik.\nI. \" Der i:)hysLkalische Mediumismus \" : von Dr. med.\nW. V. Gulat-Wellexbueg ; Graf Gael v. Klixckow-\nSTE0E3I und Dr. med. Haxs RosE>;BrscH. Pp. xiii-f494.\nBerlin. 192.3.\nThis volume is one of the most important critical siu-veys of\nphysical mediumship which has hitherto ajjpeared. It is\nprimarily an examination of printed records supplemented\noccasionaUj^ by an account of the results of the authors\"\npersonal experiences. For many years it has been said that\nno serious critical study has been undertaken by those who\nfrankly dismiss the accumulated evidence in favour of the\nauthenticity of the alleged physical phenomena of spirituahsm.\nThat objection can now no longer be urged. For in the\nvolume before us the authors have evidently been at some\npains to examine the literary evidence, and in their ov.ii\nwords, they find that the final result of theii' inquiry is to\nconclude that no scientifically valid proof of so-caUed physical\nmediumship has hitherto been brought forward.\nThe authors of this remarkable work have been generous to\ntheir opponents in the choice of material. The volume opens\nwith a general introduction, which is immediately followed by\nan admirable chapter on methods of investigation, in which\nthe weaknesses and flaws in mediumistic inquiries are ruthlessly\nexamined. We are not sure how far Dr. v. Gulat- Wellenburg\n(who is the author of this section) is a\\\\-are that the defects\nhe notes are only too painfully famiHar to the workers in this\nfield. But the difficulties which confront the reformer appear\nalmost insuperable, and Count v. Klinckowstroem is right when\n\f334 E. J. Dingwall. [part\nhe says that so long as the investigator preserves the tra-\nditional methods of inquiry, methods which have remained\nalmost unchanged for decades, so long no way seems clear by\nwhich the phenomena can be properly interpreted (p. 95).\nAs an introduction to the detailed analysis of individual\ncases Count v. Klinckowstroem touches upon the Hodgson-\nDavey experiments, and also contribiites a short account of\nthe contents of the well-known book The Confessions of a\nMedium (London, 1882), which he might well have supple-\nmented by a similar reference to the rarer and more inter-\nesting Revelations of a Spirit Medium (St. Paul, Minn., 1891.\nKeprinted 1922). Although Count v. Klinckowstroem lays\nstress upon these confessions, he must be aAvare that the\ncontents have little value in a consideration of modern physical\nmediumship as investigated by competent observers. These\nvolumes present a picture of the ordinary spiritualistic \" circle\n\"\nat which the observers are merely tools in the hands of the\nmedium. Such performances are probably not now common\nin Europe, but they are still far from rare in the United\nStates, and we haA-e ourselves seen more flagrant examples\nthan anjrthing recorded in the Confessions of a Medium.\nThey are of value rather as psychological studies of states\nof mind, and it is note^'orthy that the AAriters of this volume\nconstantly insist upon this important and often neglected\nfactor.\nThe examination joroper is begun by Dr. Rosenbuseh, who\ntakes the inquiry of the London Dialectical Society as his\nfirst subject. The study is fair and judicious, although we\ncannot assent to his rather brusque dismissal of the incident\nrecorded by the Sub-Committee as described on p. 10 of the\nReport} On the other hand it can hardly be denied that the\nDialectical Society failed to produce the quality and standard\nof evidence which would prove acceptable among serious\ninquirers to-day. The fourth chapter is by Count v. Khnckow-\nstroem and treats mainly of Sir William Crookes's experiments\nwith Home and Florence Cook. It is the former that\nthe Aveakness of the criticism is most apparent.

It is true that criticism can easily\nbe levelled against certain isolated cases. But minor omissions\nand inaccuracies are small compared with the immense bulk of\nevidence regarding the amazing occurrences in his presence.\nSubstitution of hands and the surreptitious use of the feet\nsiniijly do not meet the case. The observers were either\nhallucinated or some at least of the phenomena really occurred.\nThere seems no escape from this conclusion, and Count v.\nKUnckowstroem cannot avoid one or other horn of this\ndilemma by vaguely discussing the incompleteness of Crookes's\nexperiments or the imperfect explanations of Mr. Podmore.\nOn the other hand his criticism of Florence Cook and the\nproblem of Katie King is sound, and we are glad to note that\nhe fully appreciates the difficulties which, in reference to this\ncase, confront those who maintain the teleplastic basis of\nmediumistic materialisations. Similarly \\\\e agree with his\ntreatment of Prof. Zollner's experiments, although the recent\nstory concerning Slade's alleged confession needs confirmation.\nIn Chapter VI. Dr. Rosenbusch discusses Palladino. This\nmedium is easier to deal with than Home, since all admit that\nshe occasionally resorted to fraud, but we cannot entirely\nassent to Dr. Rosenbuschs summing up of the problem.\n\" She was certainly a conjurer,\"' he writes, but was she\nsomething more ? Were there under the layer of false pheno-\nmena genuine ones also ? Was there even one genuine one ?\nDoes there exist one single compelling observation that shows\nthat a phenomenon occurred which was beyond her actual\nfaculties or the possibihty of fraudulent creation ? We have\nnever found such an observation in the abundant materials\nbefore us.\"\" In support of this opinion Dr. Rosenbusch has\nbeen at pains to examine the literature from the early days\nof Damiani, Chiaia and Barth down to the American sittings\nin 1909.^ But as with Home the criticism is weak, since no\n^ The examination of the original authorities is somewhat wealtened by a\nnumber of errors due mainly to difficulties in translation and to an im-\nperfect acquaintance with the whole of the literature. Mr. R. Lambert\nhas indicated some of these in Psi\/chische Studien for November, 1925.\n\f336 E. J. Dingtvall. [part\ndefinite theory is adduced to account normally for the pheno-\nmena observed by reputable witnesses. The argument rather\nruns on the assumption that since some tricks were discovered,\nthe remaining j)henomena Avere tricks also though undiscovered.\nThere is certainly something to be said for this hypothesis,\nand we might agree with it if the phenomena were all of the\nsame class : but to suppose that release of a hand or foot\nwhich explains some phenomena also explains those observed\nby Sir Oliver Lodge on the lie Roubaud, appears to involve\nsuppositions for which there is no valid basis whatever. Simi-\nlarly in the survey of the Society for Psychical Research sittings\nat Naples stress is laid on what is considered the weakness\nof Mr. Baggally's hand control, but to suppose that this made\nit possible for all the phenomena to be produced by the\nmedium's hands and feet, including the visible and tangible\nhands and black objects, seems to us to demand further\nevidence than that which Dr. Rosenbusch has offered. For\nto assume that one person is capable of producing 305 \" pheno-\nmena \" fraudulently when two expert witnesses are doing\neverything that they can do under the circumstances to prevent\nthat fraud, is to suggest a dexterity which does not, in our\nopinion, exist. The same criticism can, we thinlt, be apphed to\nDr. Rosenbusch's analysis of Mile. Tomczyk's phenomena, an\nanalysis which is the first of its kind. He confines himself\nalmost solely to the telekinetic phenomena, and his conclusion\nis that the medium attached normal threads or wires to the\nobjects and then hfted them. Now this again demands a\nbehef (we would almost call it a credulous behef) in the power\nof the conjurer which is quite unwarranted by the facts. For\nthe facts are these. Dr. Ochorowicz had his early experiments\nin WarsaAv in 1909. In 1914 MUe. Tomczyk was in London,\nwhere similar although weaker phenomena were observed.\nThat is to say that for six years this medium produced one\ntype of telekinetic phenomena. Supposing this to have been\na trick, the solution was simple. It is that indicated by Dr.\nRosenbusch himself. But not a single observer seems to have\nseen the necessary threads or wires being attached to the\nobjects to be moved or detached from them. If the trick be so\nsimple, it can be repeated. Can Dr. Rosenbusch discover a\nsingle conjurer who is willing to repeat these effects for any\n\f99] Reviews. 337\nlength of time ? We believe that if he proposes it, he will\nbe received with a laughing refusal. For, as Professor Hoffman\nhas said in Modern idagic, the first rule to be borne in mind\nis this :\n\" Never tell your audience beforehand what you are\ngoing to do,\" and\" it follows that you should never perform\nthe same trick ttvice on the same evening.\" In this case the\nmedium broke these two rules for six years. Can we indeed\nsuppose that her investigators were so amazingly incompetent\nthat they all failed to detect her methods of gaining possession\nof her threads and attaching, detaching and getting rid of\nthem ? Certainly if this be the case, thenh uman testimony\nis worthless in this branch of psychical research, since no\narguments such as those adduced from exjjeriments ui slate-\n\"RTiting and billet-reading have here any weight. For here\nthe obseiTfers know how the trick is done before they see it ;\nyet they camiot detect one move which is concerned with its\nperpetration. Such amazing lack of acute observation is almost\nunthinkable, apart altogether from the other factors pointing\nto the supernormal character of the phenomena, to which Dr.\nRosenbusch apparently attaches small weight.\nIn the eighth chapter Dr. Rosenbusch examines the Goligher\nphenomena and here builds up a strong case against the\nsupernormal character of the occurrences. The whole chapter\nshould be carefully studied, and we shall content ourselves here\nwith quoting a part of the final x^aragraph which sufficiently\nindicates Dr. Rosenbusch's judicious and penetrating analysis\nof this extraordinary case. The case of Crawford,\" he writes,\nis more interesting than the case of Miss Gohgher. . . . For\nbehind the fantastic misinterpretations of these scarcely original\nproductions of an unsavoury sorcery hes the more weight}^\nproblem of their deluded sponsor. These reports of Crawford\nare not to be explained by the imjierfection of human obser-\nvation. Here are to be discerned the more severe aberrations\nof mental life, and the range of their activities is astonishing.\nIs the case of Crawford unique ?

J. DingiuaU. [PAET\nHaving examined the cases of Sordi and Gazerra, Dr. v.\nGulat-Wellenburg passes to a detailed survey of the case of\nEva C. He contributes a discussion in which good use is\nmade of the many suspicious incidents which occurred with\nthis medium and prints certain of the more curious photo-\ngraphs to illustrate his criticisms- The treatment appears to\nbe restrained, and evidently a very careful study of the docu-\nments has been carried out. We are not clear, however, w^hat\nhis conclusions are, and there is small mention of the regurgi-\ntation theory, which aj^art from the confederacy of Madame\nBisson, seems the last (if very insecure) refuge for the sceptic.\nPerusal of the chapter will probably leave the critical reader\n^'^here he was before except that Dr. v. Gulat-Wellenburg 's\nacute analysis of the foot incident on May 29, 1911, and the\napjjearance of the \" sKpper on May 17 and 20, 1912, will incite\nthe student to attack the records of other sittings in the same\nspirit. The treatment of the Society for Psychical Research\nseries (pp. 353-365) is careful and the author deserves credit\nfor his painstaking and laborious work. On the other hand.\nCount V. Khnckowstroem is more superficial in an examination\nof Kluski and Willy Schneider in Chapters XI. and XII.\nMore might be made of evidence against the former, and too\nmuch stress has been laid on the incident where a mould of\nunexpected shape appeared at a sitting in Warsaw. Moreover,\nno mention is made of the articles of Nordmann and Morhardt,\nA\\hich are at least worth consideration.\nThe treatment of Willy Schneider is again weak, although\nCount V. Khnckowstroem is to be congratulated upon his fear-\nless attempt to cast doubt upon the results and methods of\ncontrol. We cannot agree to the importance he attaches to\nthe exposure by Mr. Seeger (pp. 414 seq.), and we consider\nthat the weight he gives to Professor Henning's alleged ex-\nperiences with a Russian \"medium\"^ is altogether out of\nproportion. He accepts Prof. Henning's statements without\nany proof being offered, and even without the signed state-\nments of the witnesses or the name of the medium. Yet\nafter deaUng with these occurrences of very doubtful authen-\nticity he writes, These amazing phenomena put the case of\nWilly considerably in the shade \"\n(p. 446). We are frankly\n1 See Proc, S.P.R., 1924., pp. 327 seq.\n\f99] Reviews. 339\nsurprised that Count v. Klinckowstroem has allowed himself\nto be diverted from the path of fair criticism by these\nphenomena reported by Prof. Hemiing. We have examined\nthis report with some attention, and evidence is totally\nlacking that the phenomena were in any ^^ay like those so\ngraphically described by Prof. Henning. On the contrary.\nProf. Hemiing's narrative leaves the impression that a few\nmiserable parlour tricks were presented to him and his friends,\nand that the performance was then raised to the dignity of\nan investigation in order to jjrovide material for just that\ncriticism that Count v. Klinckowstroem has used in comiection\nwith it. If Prof. Henning wishes to be considered seriously\nhe must permit other observers to see these marvels as Baron\nV. Schrenck-Notzing has done with Schneider, and as every\nscientific man does when he demonstrates some new pheno-\nmenon. We should like ourselves to examine Prof. Henning's\n\" Russian medium and to report faithfully our experiences.\nBut from ^^'hat we have been able to ascertain Prof. Henning\nis as shy of allowing psychical researchers to see his medium\"\nas the \" medium is of permitting any sort of adequate\ninvestigation. The criticism of Wdly Schneider is of the same\ntype as that of Home. Mere freedom of hand or foot does\nnot explain the phenomena, neither does the theory of an\ningenious use of a wire in the mouth. In our opinion the\nfacts compel the adoption of the hypothesis of supernormal\naction until it is shown that a normal theory fits the facts.\nThis Count v. Klinckowstroem has not shown in the case of\nWilly Schneider. He is much more successful with Guzik in\nChapter XIII., whereas in Chapter XVI. he reverts to appar-\nently unwarranted faith in the rehabihty of \\^'itnesses if their\nobservations are contrary to the medium's claims. In Chapters\nXIV. and XV. Dr. v. Gulat-WeUenburg deals with Nielsen and\nLaszlo, dismissing the claim of the former and appreciating\nthe importance of the latter.\nWhatever we may think of the conclusions of the authors,\nof this volume, it must, we think, be agreed that they have\ncontributed a permanent addition to the scanty material on\nphysical mediumship. The book is one for the student and\nnot for the propagandist : it presupposes a serious interest in\nthe problems apart altogether from their relation to survival\n\f340 E. J. Dingwall. [part\nof personality after death. This aspect of the question is left\nalmost untouched except in so far as it is indicated that the\nreligious atmosphere of seances is a factor in increasing super-\nstitious behefs on the jjart of the sitters. The question that\nthe authors have attempted to answer is whether any super-\nnormal physical phenomena occur as described. If we under-\nstand them rightly their answer is in the negative. They do\nnot deny the possibihty of such phenomena occurring. They\nmerely state that they have failed to discover any scientific\nevidence that they do so occur. We fear that the circle of\nreaders in this country will be small, both on account of the\nlength of the volume and also the difficulties involved in\ntranslation.

Pp. ix.+382.\nThis stately volume is one of a series under the editorship\nof Prof. Dessoir which is designed to instruct the general public\nin Germany on the subjects included in what the Germans\nprefer to call \" occultism.\"' \" Physical Mediumism,\" by three\nwriters, and \" Suggestion and Hypnotism, \"\nby Prof. Albert\nMoll, are the other volumes announced in the series, which,\nif one may judge by this volume, should fulfil its purpose\nvery well. It is composed of selected extracts from standard\n\" classical \" works on the subject, most of which are unknown\nand unprocurable in Germany, accompanied by critical com-\nments. The ground it covers is best indicated by an enumera-\ntion of the topics it discusses, viz. Kerner's Seer of Prevorst,\nTelepathy, Phantasms of the Living and the Dead, Clairvoyance,\nProphecies, and Spirit-communications, which consider Flournoy's\ncase of \" Helene Schmidt,\"' Mrs. Leonard, Raymond and Cross-\n\f99] Reviews. 341\nCorrespondences, with special attention to the Ear of Diony-\nsius.\" The selection, containing as it does a large amount of\nmaterial from '\nthe researches of the S.P.R. (for which Dr.\nBaerwald always expresses the highest ajipreciation and resj)ect),\nmust be pronounced excellent, and the narrative is lucid and\nwell-arranged. Besides his copious quotations from the S.P.R.,\nhe also gives interesting accounts of cases not so well knoAvn\nin this country, such as the experiments of Doctors Chowrin,\nNaum Kotik and WasiHewski, of Richet and Geley with\nOssowietzki, and of Dr. Pagenstecher with Maria Reyes de Z. ;\nand altogether his book is a competent and creditable piece\nof workmanship.\nIt is when it comes to theorizing and explaining the facts\nthat it becomes permissible to part comjaany Dr. Baer-\nT\\'ald. He beheves in telepathy and apparently in nothing\nelse\u2014except hyperaesthesia\u2014and tries to reduce everything to\nthem by extending their powers to an unlimited extent. He\nholds that telepathic communication, A\\hich he conceives on\nthe analogy of wireless radiation, is primarily between the\nunconscious parts of t^wo souls Avhich are en rapport, and is\nready to beheve also that all souls are thus unconsciously m,\nrapport, and that, consequently, any kno\\A'ledge in the possession\nof any mind may be tapped by a sensitive.\nMoreover, although the unconscious is officially described as\ninfantile m its mentahty, he tends to attribute to it a high\ndegree of practical intelhgence and remarkable feats of dra-\nmatic impersonation. It is obvious that, so lavishly conceived,\ntelepathy \" may be alleged to explain anything, and that it\nbecomes next to impossible to guard against it. No stress is\nlaid on the negativity of the conception, on the scantiness of\nthe direct evidence for it, and on the competition of alternative\ntheories. It becomes a key that turns in every lock, though\nit remains to be seen whether it will really open any doors.\nNor is it clear that it has a scientific status superior to that\nof other hypotheses AA'hich are equally wide and vague, say\nthan \" spirits, '\nor divine (or diabohcal) intervention. Wide\nand vague hypotheses are incidental to the initial stages in the\ngrowth of any science, and at present characterize all oiu- efforts\nto understand the subjects of psychical research. AH of them,\neven \" spirits,\" are capable of scientific use, all, even \" hyper-\n\f342 F. C. S. Schiller. [PAKT\naesthesia,\" are capable of blocking inquiry. There is no\noccasion, therefore, for any one of them to give itself airs and\nto pride itself on any inherent scientific respectabUity. For\nall at bottom suffer from the same weakness, which besets aU\ntheorizing in a subject not yet brought under experimental\ncontrol. We cannot verify them by accumulating evidence at\nwill, and we cannot make crucial experiments. So we camiot\nuse the pragmatic, i.e. the really scientific, test, and 7nake\nthem work. Until we can do so, it must remain open to every\none to beheve as much, or as httle, as he likes, and vain to\nbrowbeat dissenters with the threats of scientific authority.\nScience itself in modern times has modified its basic doctrines\nso rapidly and radically, and become so conscious of the prag-\nmatic nature of its method, that it has grown more and more\ncareless about the ideal of coerciveness foisted on it by the philo-\nsophers, and no longer expects its truths to comply with the\ndogmas extracted by former generations from their less adequate\nknowledge. If a truth is good and useful and the best to be\nhad, it is not essential that it shovdd be absolutely certain and\ncapable of extorting universal assent. It is recognized, not\nbecause we cannot help ourselves and there is no alternative,\nbut because it is the best available and we desire the power\nover events which it gives us. Now Dr. Baerwald too often\ntries to make capital for his pet hypothesis (which for all one\ncan tell as yet inai\/ turn out to be the best) by arguments\nbased on the false ideal that \" truth \" rests on coercion (cf.\np. 159) ;\nyet he too at times sees quite well that \" 7iearly\n(sic) all our human knowledge consists of probabihties,\" and\nthat an ever-growing probabUity with a gradual approxi-\nmation to certainty \" may be as valuable and sufficient in\npsychical science as in any other (cf. p. 79). That is the true\nmethod of science, if it is added that absolute certainty is as\nunnecessary as it is unattainable !\nToleration of alternative theories then is even more expedient\nin science than in rehgion ; and for all to recognize what a\nvariety of alternatives is possible, and then for each to work\nhis own theory for all it is worth (and no more !), seems the\npoHcy most hkely to conduce to progress in Psychical Research.\nF.

PIDDINGTON.\nThe complexity of cross-correspondences makes them diffi-\ncult things both to present and to follow. If they are\nsimplified too much, their true nature is misrepresented,\nand their value as evidence of intricate supernormal\nactivity improperly diminished. The cross-correspondences\nembedded in the scripts of our group of automatists are\nnot simple things ; neither are they neat and compact,\nbut extend themselves all over the place, intersecting and\ndovetailing with one another, so that it is hard to say\nwhere a given instance begins and where it ends. Years\nago, when they were first observed, it was an easier\nmatter to deal with them, because we then supposed\neach cross-correspondence to be an isolated thing, and to\nbe confined within narrow bounds ; and we had little or\nno suspicion of their ramifications, and of their inter-\nlacings with each other.\nWere I to attempt to trace in a single paper the devious\ncourse of a cross-correspondence from its source in the\nscripts, say, of 1901, to the point it has reached in, say,\n1926, few readers would have the patience to accompany\nme to the end of the journey, and I shall therefore confine\nmyself to rendering an account of a section of a cross-\ncorrespondence, a part of a much larger puzzle. At the\nsame time I must emphasise the point that it is only a\nsection. I must also explain that I have not found it\npossible to cut it out from its matrix without some\nragged ends adhering to it ; and that about these ragged\nends, when I do not ignore them, I am obliged for\nbrevity's sake to make statements unsupported by detailed\n^evidence.\nz\n\f346 J. G. Piddington [PABT\nThe section of a cross-correspondence which forms the\nsubject of this paper is extracted from the scripts of\nthree automatists, Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Salter, and Mrs.\nWillett.\nIt being convenient for purposes of reference for a paper\nto bear a distinctive title, I have called this one \" One\nCrowded Hour of Glorious Life.\" I have chosen that\nquotation as a title, not because it epitomizes or suggests\nthe main lines of thought running through the concordant\nscripts better than would several other phrases found in\nthem, but because it so happens that within a short\ninterval of time it occurred in the scripts of the three\nautomatists independently : that is to say, without any\none of them knowing of its occurrence in the script of\nthe others.\nMoreover, being myself unable to resist the conclusion\nthat many of the coincidences between the scripts of our\ngroup of automatists are due to some one's intelligent\ndesign, and are not to be set down to chance, to common\nassociations of ideas or to unmethodical, meandering,\ntelepathic interchange, I assume that this three-fold repeti-\ntion of \" One crowded hour of glorious life \" is meant to\nindicate a connexion between the three different contexts\nin which it was inserted. \" One crowded hour,\" though the\nmost salient, is not, however, the only link between the\nscripts to be discussed ; other links are \" The paths of\nglory lead but to the grave,\" certain allusions to Achilles,\nand quotations from Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the\nDuke of Wellington.\nThe scripts in question are as follows :\nScripts in Chronological Order.^\n(A) M.V. 151 {March 18, 1907).\nThere was no message for you this morning but to-night\nI want to say something.\n(Drawings of a ? cross-bow, a bow and arrow, a fledged\narrow, and a ? target.)\n^M.V. =Mrs. Verrall :\nH.

I\nthink it will be agreed that beyond the bare fact that\nScript A had referred to these lines, neither Mrs. Willett\nnor Mrs. Salter covdd have derived any hints of value\nfrom the context in which they there appear.\nMrs. Verrall in Script D puts together \" Not once or\ntwice in our rough island-story \" and \" The paths of\nglory lead but to the grave \" ; while Mrs. Salter in Script\nF puts together \" The paths of glory,\" etc., and \" One\ncrowded hour of glorious life \" ; Mrs. Willett finally, in\nScript K, jiutting together \" One crowded hour \" and\n\" The way to highest glory leads but to the grave.\"\nWhen Mrs. Salter wrote Script F she had not seen the\nfirst part of Script D, and when Mrs. Willett wrote\n\f100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 351\nScript K she had not seen either the first part of Script D\nor any part of Script F. They had both seen the second\npart of Script D from \" Now write this \" to the end ; but\nI do not see how this part of the script could have\nsuggested to one the combination of The paths of glory,\"\netc., with One crowded hour,\" or to the other the\ncombination of \" One crowded hoiu' \" with \" The way to\nhighest glory leads but to the grave.\"\nMeanwhile, as if to lay stress upon it, \" One crowded\nhour of glorious life,\" which had appeared first in Mrs.\nSalter's Script F, is repeated sixteen days later in Mrs.\nVerraU's Script G, and then again repeated some six months\nlater in Mrs. Willett's Script K.\nI want to draw attention to only one other verbal\ncoincidence, and to that one because it is possibly due to\na normal cause. Mrs. VerraU's Script H has \" Then dust\nto dust With moth and rust,\" while Mrs. Salter's Script J\nhas \" dust to dust \" and \" Lay not up to yourselves\ntreasure upon earth \" ; \u2014the original context of the second\nphrase involving a reference to \" moth and rust.\" Mrs.\nSalter had been told of \" Script H by Mrs. Verrall on\nAugust 24, 1910, i.e. some six weeks before Script J was\nwritten. \" Told of \" means, not that the text of the\nscript was shown, but that its general import was revealed.\nBut even if we assume that Mrs. Salter saw the full text,\nthough it will account for the verbal coincidence, it will\nnot, in my view at least, serve to account for the far\nmore striking coincidences of thought between Script J\na,nd Mrs. VerraU's jDrevious scripts.\nIt will be convenient at this point to state what other infor-\nmation about each other's scripts the automatists possessed.\nOn June 4, 1910, ]\\Irs. Salter was shown ScrijDt G, and\non June 5, 19)0, Mrs. Verrall saw Scripts E and F. This\nmay sound as if a lot of information was given away,\nwhich might account for at least some of the coincidences\nbetween the automatists. That is not my view ;\nand, if\nthe reader will make a careful study of the scripts, keeping\nwell in mind the dates when they were written and the\ndates when information about some of them was communi-\ncated, I believe it will not be his view either.\n\f352 J. G. Piddmgton [part\nHenceforward I shall be able to proceed without having\nto stop eyery now and again to state what knowledge of\neach other's scripts the automatists acquired at various\ntimes ; for I have given all the relevant information on\nthat head.i That information is derived from records\nkept by Mrs. Verrall ; and those members who know how\nscrupulous she was in such matters, will, I think, feel\nassured that no essential information has been omitted\nor withheld.\nSo far I have touched only on the verbal coincidences\nbetween the scripts, and have said nothing about the\ncoincidences of thought where there is no coincidence of\nlanguage. These I will do my best to bring out by\nmeans of a running commentary, in the course of which\nI shall at the same time give the literary sources of\nmost of the quotations in the scripts, and cite or sum-\nmarize the contexts of these quotations.\n\" The Paths of Glory lead but to the Grave.\"\nThe source of this is Gray's Elegy in a Country Church-\nyard :\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,\nAwait alike th' inevitable hour :\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\nThis quotation first appeared in Mrs. Verrall's Script\nand she made the following note on the original script :\n\" Wolfe had been mentioned at dinner. These words\nare said to have been Wolfe's last.\"\n1 1 do not count as rdemnt information tlie fact that Script B was\nseen by Mrs. Verrall on September 26, 190S, and by Mrs. Willett on\nFebruary 26, 1909, or the fact that Script C was seen by Mrs. Verrall\non September 7, 1909 ; for to suppose that the quotations in Script B\ncould have suggested to both, and the quotations in B and C have\nsuggested to Mrs. Verrall, '\"\nOne crowded hour of glorious life,\" seems\nto me altogether too far-fetched ; and there is nothing in the contexts\nof these quotations to suggest Claverhouse either. Nor do I include\nuiider the head of '\"\nrelevant information \" the fact that Mrs. Willett\ndid not see Sci'ipts C, E, F. G. H. I and J, till after the date on which\nshe wrote Script K.\n\f100] One Croivded Hour of Glorious Life 353\nI do not know what authority there is for these words\nhaving been Wolfe's last.^ Whether they actually were,\nhowever, does not matter : the essential point being the\nassociation of them in jVIrs. Verrall's mind with the death\nof WoKe. The E7icl. Brit, gives the following version of\nWolfe's last words :\nI .\n\" While he was lying in a swoon some one near him\nexclaimed, '\nThey run ; see how they run !\n' '\nWho\nrun ?\n'\ndemanded Wolfe, as one roused from sleep. '\nThe\nenemy,' was the answer ;\n'\nthey give way everywhere.'\nWolfe rallied for a moment, gave a last order for cutting\noff the retreat, and murmuring, '\nNow God be praised,\nI will die in peace,' breathed his last.\"\nNote in this connexion that the first quotation in Mrs.\nSalter's script (Script F) of The paths of glory \" is\npreceded by eV^^aros\" Xoyo?, which, though not classical\nGreek, may well be good vScript \" Greek for the last\nwords of a dying man. Note also that immediately after\nquoting \" The paths of glory lead but to the grave\n\"\nMrs. Salter writes \" One crowded hour of glorious life.\"\n\" One Crowded Hour.\"\nTo Chapter XXXIII. of Old Mortality Scott affixed as\na motto the following lines\u2014long thought to be his own,\nbut now known not to be :\nSound, sound the clarion, fiU the fife !\nTo all the sensual world proclaim,\nOne crowded hour of glorious life\nIs worth an age without a name.\nIt is clear that Scott chose this motto because of its\nappropriateness to the sentiments which in Chapter XXXIII.\nhe puts into the mouth of Claverhouse. Addressing\nhimself to Morton, who has just been greatly upset by\nthe sight of bloodshed, Claverhouse says :\nBut in truth, Mr. Morton, why should we care so much\nfor death, light upon us or around us whenever it may ?\nMen die daily\u2014not a bell tolls the hour but it is the\n1 See pp. 372-373 below for the facts.\n\f354 J. G. Piddington [part\ndeath note of some one or other ; and why hesitate\nto shorten the span of others, or take over-anxious care\nto prolong onr own 1 It is all a lottery .... It is\nnot the expu-ing pang that is worth thinking of in an\nevent that must happen one day, and may befall us on\nany given moment\u2014it is the memory which the soldier\nleaves behind him, like the long train of light that follows\nthe sunken sun\u2014that is all that is worth caring for,\nwhich distinguishes the death of the brave or the ignoble.\nWhen I think of death, jVIr. Morton, as a thing worth\nthinking of, it is in the hope of pressing one day some\nwell-fought and hard-won field of battle, and dying with\nthe shout of victory in my ear\u2014that would be worth\ndying for, and more, it would be worth having lived for !\nScott, no doubt, in attributing to Claverhouse the hope\nof some day dying in the moment of victory, had in mind\nthe real circumstances of his death. Claverhouse was\nmortally wounded at the battle of Killiecrankie, while\nleading his Highlanders to victory. As he lay on the\nground he asked :\n\" How goes the day ?\n\" of a soldier,\nwho replied :\n\" Well for King James, but I am sorry for\nyour lordship.\" \"If it goes well for him,\" said Claver-\nhouse, \" it matters the less for me.\"\nWhen in Script L Mrs. Salter repeats \" One crowded\nhour \" she follows it with two quotations : Fame is\nthe spur \" from Milton's Lycidas, which is said to be\n\" nearer the thought,\" and \" Slowly and sadly we laid\nhim down \" from the Burial of Sir John Moore. The\nlatter is rejected, not because it is wrong, but because it\nmerely repeats \" the same thoiight.\" What is the thought\ncommon to all three quotations ? If \" One crowded\nhour \" means, as the evidence shows it to mean, Claver-\nhouse's hope of dying in the moment of victory, then\nthe parallel with the death of Moore at the end of his\nvictorious retreat on Corunna is obvious ; and the parallel\nwith .young Lycidas cut off at the moment when poetic\nachievement was about to bring him earthly fame, if not\nquite so obvious, is clear enough :\n\f100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 355\nFame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise\nTo scorn delights, and live laborious dayes ;\nBut the fair guerdon when we hope to find,\nAnd think to burst out into sudden blaze,\nComes the blind Fury with th' abhorred shears.\nAnd slits the thin spun life. But not the praise\nPhoebus repli'd.\n\"Captain, my Captain.\"\nThe combination of One crowded hour \" with \" The\npaths of glory lead but to the grave \" found in Mrs.\nSalter's script, and there associated with the deaths of\nClaverhouse, Moore and Lycidas, is reproduced in Mrs.\nWillett's script (Script K) ; and it is there associated,\nby means of the words \" Captain, my Captain,\" with a\ndeath that struck down, not a soldier nor a scholar and\npoet, but a statesman in the verj^ hour of triumph :\n0 Captain ! my Captain ! our fearful trip is done.\nThe ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won.\nThe port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,\nWhile follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring ;\nBut 0 heart ! heart ! heart !\n0 the bleeding drops of red !\nWhere on the deck my Captain lies,\nFallen cold and dead.\nThese lines are the first verse of Walt Whitman's\npoem on the death of Abraham Lincoln.\nAchilles' Choice, and ^oXiKoa-y^iov t^^of-\nIn Script E Mrs. Salter combines \" He gave his bridle\nreins a shake \"\n\u2014which, as we have seen, represents the\nClaverhouse topic\u2014with \" the giens of Pelion . . . the\ntough ashen spear ^oXiKoa-yj-ov ejxoi. war\u2014the rivals face\nto face.\" Some of these phrases refer to Achilles' spear\n\u2014\nthe only spear in the Iliad that was at the same time\niKoa-^iov, ashen, and connected with Mount Pelion :\n\" the Pehan ashen spear, which Cheiron gave his father,\nplucked from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors.\"\nI\n\f356 J. G. Piddington [part\nIt was with this spear that he slew Hector, the champion\nof Troy. The rest of the phrases\u2014viz. \" war\u2014the rivals,\nface to face\"\u2014, as \"Achilles' choice\" in the very next\nscript of Mrs. Salter's makes certain, allude to Achilles'\nfight with Hector.\nIn Script F Mrs. Salter combines \" The paths of glory\n\"\nand \"One crowded hour\" with \"Achilles' choice.\"\nBy \" Achilles' choice \" is meant his resolve to do battle\nwith Hector, although, as he well knew, his own death\nwas fated to befall straightway after Hector's. From\nThetis, his goddess mother, he had learnt that twain\nfates were bearing him to the issue of death. He was\nfree to choose either : he could sail home from Troy,\nforgo all chance of fame, and live to a ripe old age ;\nor, if he stayed and fought, he could win imperishable\nglory, but never see his dear native land again. Rather\nthan life with dishonour, he chose death with honour,\nand he made his choice, I would ask the reader to bear\nin mind, believing, or at least fearing, that after death\nthere followed no life of Elysian bliss, but a forlorn exist-\nence among the phantoms of men outworn.^\nThis view of the after-life held by Achilles is referred\nto, and contradicted, in Script K ; for that is what is\nmeant by\nNo Shades but Reality incorporeal,\nand by\nthe capacity of soul which takes visible form in the\nMan of Action is not lost at death fight ever fight on.\n\" Fight ever fight on \" is a slightly incorrect quotation\n\u2014correctly given elsewhere in Willett script\u2014from Brown-\ning's Epilogue to Asolando :\nOne who never turned his back but marched breast forward,\nNever doubted clouds would break.\nNever dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,.\nHeld we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better.\nSleep to wake.\n^See Iliad.

For this fear of death is indeed the pretence\nof wisdom, and not real wisdom, being the appearance of\nknowng the unkno-wm ; since no one knows whether\ndeath, which they in their fear apprehend to be the\ngreatest evil, may not be the greatest good.\nIn this particular passage he speaks of the possibility\nof death being the greatest good ; but later on in the\nApology he expresses the hope that after death he will\nhold converse with the great heroes of time past and\nchange replies with all the circle of the wise,\" and\n\" above all \" be able to continue the pursuit of philosophy\n\f358 J.

The lines in the\nPassing of Youth I need not quote, because their point\nis sufficiently given by the passage in Fragments, which\nruns thus :\nI am well aware that my temper is in disaccord with\nthat of Buddha, of Cleanthes, of Marcus Aurelius.

If I quote these two\nstanzas, it will be seen why Script I associates Myers's\n\" to dare and still to dare \" with them :\nThen, welcome each rebuff\nThat turns earth's smoothness rough,\nEach sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go !\nBe our joys three-parts pain !\nStrive, and hold cheap the strain ;\nLearn, nor account the pang ;\ndare, never grudge the throe !\nFor thence,\u2014-a paradox\nWhich comforts while it mocks,\n\u2014\nShall life succeed in that it seems to fail\n;\nWhat I aspired to be.\nAnd was not, comforts me :\nA brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale.\nThe second of these two stanzas is closely connected\nwith the two following later stanzas :\nTherefore I summon age\nTo grant youth's heritage,\nLife's struggle having so far reached its term :\nThen shall I pass ajoproved\nA man, for age removed\nFrom the developed brute ; a god though in the germ.\n\f100] One Croivded Hour of Glorious Life 363\nAnd I shall thereupon\nTake rest, ere I be gone\nOnce more on my adventure brave, and new :\nFearless and unperplexed,\nWhen I wage battle next,\nWhat weapons to select, what armour to indue.\nThe reader should bear these stanzas from Rabbi ben\nEzra in mind while he reads the following phrases that\nform part of Script I :\nAll that I strove to be . . .

At the same time there are\nseveral references in the scripts to Medea's herbs, and it\nmay be that some connexion is intended between them\nand the Achilles topic ; but if so I have no explanation\nto offer.\nThe extract from Script K opens with the words :\nSound the trumpets Beat the not ploughshares\nThe general sense is plain : namely, that martial exploits,\nnot the achievements of peace, are the theme. The\nphraseology is reminiscent partly of Isaiah ii. 4, or Micah\niv. 3, or Joel iii. 10, and partly of Dryden's Alexanders\nFeast :\nThe joUy god [Bacchus] in Triumph comes ;\nSound the Trumpets ; beat the Drtims.\nThe script, however, is referring to War, not to Bacchus ;\nand the line about Bacchus has simply been used to suggest\nthe following verse in another poem of Dryden's, his\nSong for St. Cecilia's Day :\nThe Tkumpets loud Clangor\nExcites us to Arms,\nWith shrill notes of anger\nAnd mortal alarms.\nThe double, double, double beat\nOf the thund'ring Dkxjm\nCryes, heark the Foes come ;\nCharge, Charge, 'tis too late to retreat.\n\f366 J. G. Piddington [part\nIn this same script\u2014K\u2014the words \"from white Cloud\nfree\" belong to the preceding \"No Shades but Reality in-\ncorporeal \" ; \"If you will from white Cloud free \" meaning :\n\" If you prefer, instead of '\nReahty incorporeal ' you can\nsay '\nfrom white Cloud free '.\"\nThe expression is taken from Blake's Little Black Boy,\nand means simply \" when this mortal shall have put on\nimmortality,\" the Cloud symbolizing the body which\nvanishes at death and no longer envelops the soul.\nBlake's poem is about two little boys, one black and the\nother white ; their bodies being spoken of respectively\nas a black cloud and a white one. In Script K \" from\nwhite Cloud free \" is used in just the same sense as in\nthe poem ; but \" there were Black Clouds too,\" though of\ncourse suggested by the poem, seems to bear a different\nsense, and to serve as a transition to the idea of a great\nnational danger or disaster, such as the American Civil\nWar,\u2014or at least that is how I read the context :\nthere were Black Clouds too and much pestilence Cap-\ntain my Captain But the end was not yet,\nthe \" pestilence \" and \" the end was not yet \" being\nreminiscences of the \" wars and rumours of wars \" passage\nin the Gospels. This interpretation anyhow suits the\nnext paragraph of the script (not included in the extract\nprinted on p. 349 above), which explicitly refers to the\nBattle of Philippi, one of the great battles of the Roman\nCivU Wars.\nWe have here a good example of what I have called\na \" ragged end,\" for \" there were Black Clouds too\n\"\nmarks a point where the \" One crowded hour \" train of\nthought branches oS into another train.\nI turn now to Script D. It will be remembered that\nthe second part of this script, from \" Now write this\n\"\ndown to the end, was shown to Mrs. Salter and Mrs.\nWillett before either of them made her contribution to\nthe cross-correspondence.\nWhether the words about a search beginning in fear\nand ending in joy have some definite application I do\n\f100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 367\nnot know ; but at any rate they obviously lead up to\nthe assertion that\nas long as there is life there is neither beginning nor\nend\u2014only continuous development\n;\nand this assertion, especially considering the quotation\nfrom the Wellington \" Ode that precedes it, we may,\nI think, regard as expressing in general terms the doctrine\nformulated later in a less general way, that \" the capacity\nof soul that takes visible form in the Man of Action is\nnot lost at death.''\nMrs. Verrall communicated this part of her script to\nMrs. Salter and Mrs. Willett, because she fancied that\nit might relate to a matter in which both of them felt\na personal interest. Whether it did or not\u2014and, speaking\nfor myself, I do not believe it had the slightest relation\n\u2014\nI can assure the reader that the meaning tentatively read\ninto the second part of Script D by Mrs. Verrall bears\nnot the remotest resemblance to the meaning which\ncollation of this script with the other scripts under review\nhas led me to place upon it. Had the ivhole script been\n-\ncommunicated to Mrs. Salter and Mrs. Willett, it is con-\nceivable that both might, consciously or subconsciously,\nhave traced the connexion between not once or twice\nin our rough island-story \" and the thought of death\nproving no bar to the development of talents and capa-\ncities possessed and displayed in this life. But the whole\nscript was not shown them ; and we must therefore look\nelscM^here for an explanation of the coincidences between\nScript D on the one hand and Mrs. Salter's and Mrs.\nWillett's scripts on the other.\n\\\nLeading Ideas.\nIt remains for me to try to state what are the leading\nideas traceable in the group of scripts before us ;\nand\nhow they are distributed between the three automatists.\nI take first Death with Honour. It is illustrated\nby Achilles' Choice (peculiar to Mrs. Salter's script), and\nby Claverhouse's speech to Morton, referred to by all\nthree automatists by means of \" One crowded hour of\n\f368 J. G. Piddington [part\nglorious life.\" If, by \" Achilles' Choice \" allusion is\nintended as well to the death of Socrates, his would be\nanother example of Death with Honour.\nAnother leading idea is that of Duty done in the face\nof pain or despair, of mortal danger or of certain death.\nThis is illustrated by Sarpedon's, and possibly by Granville's,\n'!ofj.ev ;\nby the \"Dare and still to dare\" passages in\nMyers's Passing of Youth and Fragments of Inner Life,\nand by Browning's Rabbi ben Ezra. These illustrations\nare confined to Mrs. Salter's script.\nA third leading idea is that of Death in the moment of\nvictory or achievement. Illustrations of this are Claver-\nhouse's speech to Morton, common to all three automatists ;\nthe Death of Lincoln, found only in Mrs. Willett's script ;\nthe Death of Moore at Corunna, and the Death of Lycidas,\npeculiar to Mrs. Salter ; the Death of Wolfe, associated\nby Mrs. Verrall only with \" The paths of glory lead but\nto the grave \" ; and the Death of Achilles, implicit in\nthe reference to Achilles' Choice. I rather suspect that\nDeath in the moment of Victory is what is really implied\nby \" The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\" This\nis not, of course, the meaning of the words in Gray's\nElegy ; but scripts on their own admission, if such an\nexpression may pass, not infrequently use quotations\nin a sense other than their original sense.\nThe last of these leading ideas that I have to mention\nmay be thus expressed :\n\" Death does not end or interrupt\nmen's activities ; but on the contrary offers new and\ngreater opportunities for the exercise of enhanced powers\nof work.\" Of this thought there is a considerable variety\nof expressions :\n(1) Browning's Epilogue to Asolamlo (Mrs. Willett only)\n(2)\n\" The end is after all only a beginning\u2014and as long\nas there is life there is neither beginning nor end\u2014only\ncontinuous development \" (Mrs. Verrall only) ;\n(3) Ode 071 the Death of the Duke of Wellington (Mrs.\nVerrall and Mrs. Salter) ;\n(4)\n\" The capacity of soul which takes visible form in\nthe Man of Action is not lost at death. ... No Shades,,\nbut Reality incorporeal \" (Mrs. Willett only) ;\n\f100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 369\n(5) Browning's Rabbi ben Ezra (Mrs. Salter only) ;\n(6) The \" dare and still to dare \" passages in Myers's\nwritings (Mrs. Salter only) ;\n(7) Possibly \" Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon\nearth \" (Mrs. Salter only) ;\nand I may remind the reader in this connexion of the\nhope of which Socrates spoke during his trial of being\nable to continue his pursuit of philosophy after death.\nConcluding Remarks.\n% No one outside a lunatic asylum would deny the existence-\nof at any rate most of the coincidences between the\nscripts under review, or would attribute them to chance.\nThough it would not be quite so absurd to attribute\nthem to fraudulent conspiracy between the automatists,\nI shall assume that there is no need to discuss that\nhypothesis, until at least some one has been bold enough\nto advance it. A less unreasonable hypothesis would be\nthat the coincidences are the result of unfair selection by\nthe commentator, who, ranging over a mass of scripts,\nhas arbitrarily picked out one here and another there,\nhis choice having been guided by a desire\u2014conscious or\nsubconscious\u2014to make a pretty story out of the batch.\nI would most readily allow that any commentator possessed\nof much patience and of a modicum of ingenuity, especially\nif unhampered by scruples, could concoct any number of\npretty stories out of the scripts. I would myself under-\ntake, for a sufficiently attractive reward in hard cash,\nto discover in the scripts the story of the Tichborne\nCase or of the Third Crusade or of Ahce in Wonderland,\nor evidence of the Baconian authorship of Shakespeare's\nPlays, provided that I was free to pick and choose such\nscripts, and particularly such fragments of scripts, as\nsuited my purpose, in an arbitrary way : that is to say,\nregardless of whether there was evidence of some bond\nbetween the scripts and fragments so selected other than\nthat created by my own fanciful theory.\nBut the cross-correspondences published in Proceedings\nare not the product of arbitrary selection. I have\n\f370 J. G. Piddington [part\nendeavoured to set forth on pp. 443-451, 457-459 of Proc.\nVol. XXXIII. some of the rules which we observe in this\nmatter ; and these rules not only follow the instructions\nas to the grouping of scripts explicitly or implicitly laid\ndown iia the scripts themselves, but are also, I venture to\nthink, in accordance with common-sense and logic.\nThe scripts dealt with in this paper are thirteen in\nnumber, and for the purpose of easy reference are marked,\naccording to their chronological order, A. B, C, etc.,\ndown to M. The reasons for grouping together these\nthirteen scripts may be thus stated ;\ni|\nF is joined to G, K and L because all have the quota-\ntion \" One crowded hour of glorious life.\"\nF is joined to E because both allude to Achilles.\nE is joined to C and M because all three have \" He\ngave his bridle reins a shake.\"\nM has \" the cavalier's song\u2014to horse and away,\" a\nquotation from the third of Browning's Cavalier\nTunes, \" Boot and Saddle,\" found also in B and\nI, which are accordingly joined to M.\nF has ' the paths of glory lead but to the grave,\"\nfound also in D and J, which are therefore joined\nto F.\nD has \" Not once or twice in our rough island-story,\"\npreviously quoted in A, which is therefore joined\nto D.\nJ has \" dust to dust \" found also in H, which is\naccordingly joined to J.\nEveryone of the thirteen scripts from A to M is\naccounted for in this list.\nBut let us test the matter in another way. The thirteen\nscripts include\n(a) the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th occurrence in all the\nscripts of all the automatists - of \" One crowded\nhour of glorious life \" (see F, G, K, and L.) ;\nII mean by this not merely in all Mrs. VerralJ's, Mrs. Salter's and\nMrs. Willett's scripts, but in all the scrijjts of the whole group of S.P.R.\nautomatic writers.\n\fiOO] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 371\n(6) the 1st and 2nd occurrence in all the scripts of all\nthe automatists of Not once or twice in our\nrough island-story \" (see A and D) ;\n(c) the 1st, 2nd. 3rd and 4th occurrence in all the\nscripts of all the automatists of \" The paths of\nglory lead but to the grave \" (see D, F, J and K) ;\n{d) the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th allusion\n(\" Boot and Saddle,\" \" He gave his bridle reins a\nshake,\" and One crowded hour \" being sq\naccounted) to Claverhouse (see B. C. E. G. I. K,\nL and M).\nThis hst leaves every one of the thirteen scripts\naccounted for except H, and the reasons for including H\nare given on pp. 358-359 above.\nIn the face of these facts can it be plausibly argued\neither that the thirteen scripts have been selected arbi-\ntrarily ; or that the interval of time\u2014August 3, 1909, to\nNov. 13, 1910\u2014that separates the first from the last of the\nscripts constituting the cross-correspondence proper is so\nlong as to diminish to any serious degree the force of the\ncoincidences ?\nThere remain two other hjiDotheses ;\none, that the\ncoincidences were mainly, if not entirely, due to some\nsupernormal cause ; the other, that they were the result\nof a normal cause : namely, a certain amount of know-\nledge of each other's scripts normally acquired by the\nautomatists. An advocate of this last hypothesis would\nhave to start from the following facts :\n(1) the knowledge of Script A acquired by ilrs. Salter\nin 1907, and by Mrs. Willett in 1909 ;\n(2) the knowledge of the second part of Script D\nacquired by Mrs. Willett in Oct. 1909, and by\n]\\Irs. Salter ui Nov. 1909 ;\n(3) some acquaintance with the subject of Script H\nacquired by ]\\Irs. Salter on Aug. 24, 1910 ;\n(4) the knowledge of Scripts E and F acquired by Mrs.\nVerrall on June 5, 1910 ; and\n(5) the knowledge of Script G acquired by Mrs. Salter\non June 4, 1910.\n\f372 J. G. Piddington [part\nHe would then have to show how the possession of\nthis information enabled the automatists to develop\ncertain similar or identical trains of thought ; aid, tO'\nmake his argument plausible, he would have to trace the\nprocess step by step. I do not envy our imaginary\nadvocate his task, and I fear he is likely to remain\nimaginary. But should he present himself, I should be\nvery curious to learn his explanation of the appearance\nin the scripts of all three automatists of \" One crowded\nliour of glorious life,\" and especially, perhaps, his explana-\ntion of Script K. Meanwhile, until detailed explanation\non normal lines is forthcoming, I shall prefer to believe\nthat the coincidences were either due to some remarkable\nform of telepathic interchange between the automatists,\nor else were the work of some directing intelligence,\noperating on them ab extra. And of these two theories I\nprefer the second.\nMa^J 25, 1926.\nPostscript.\nExcept for some merely verbal changes and for the\naddition on pp. 369-370 above of a passage dealing with the\nquestion of manufacturing coincidences by arbitrary\nselection of scripts, the foregoing paper is printed as\noriginally written in May 1926. In the following July\nI came across a passage in A. G. Bradley's Wolfe which\nhas a bearing on Sarpedon's 'lo\/uei\/ if taken in connexion\nwith \" The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\" As\nmentioned on p. 352 above, Mrs. Verrall assumed \" The\npaths of glory lead but to the grave \" to have been the\nlast words spoken by Wolfe. Though I knew that there\nwas a story to the effect that shortly before his death\nWolfe had said he would rather have written Gray's\nElegy than take Quebec, I did not trouble to ascertain\nwhat authority, if any, there might be for these words\nfrom the Elegy having been the last spoken by Wolfe,\nbecause I thought (and I still think) that the essential\npoint is the association in Mrs. VerralVs mind of these\nwords with the death of Wolfe.\n\f100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 373\nIt appears to be certain that Wolfe did quote \" The\npaths of glory \" and its context shortly before the battle\non the i\nPlains of Abraham ; but the precise momeiat is\nuncertain. It is, however, certain that these were not\nhis last words.\n^\nI suggested on p. 368 above that \" The paths of glory\nlead but to the grave \" stands for Death in the moment\nof Victory ; while I took Sarpedon's speech to Glaucus\n\u2014\nthe 'lofxev speech\u2014to be an illustration of Duty done\nin the face of pain or despair, of mortal danger or of\ncertain death ;\n- and though I did not directly and explicitly\nconnect it with the The paths of glory,\" I think I\nmade it plain that Sarpedon's 'lonev and \" The paths of\nglory \" belong to the same range of ideas. But that\nthere was any historical ground for associating Sarpedon's\nspeech to Glaucus with ^'\nThe paths of glory \" was quite\nunknown to me till in July 1926 I read for the first time\nthe last paragraph of A. G. Bradley's Wolfe, which runs thus :\nIn the pocket of the coat in wliich he fell was found\na sheet of paper containing these lines from Pope's version\n1 The following extract from a letter which Mrs, Salter wrote me on\nJune 24, 1926, after i-eading my jDaper in MS., shows that at one time\nMrs. Verrall knew that The paths of glory were, not Wolfe's last words :\n\" I am rather puzzled at my mother's note to Script D that \"\nThe\npaths of glory,' etc., are said to have been 'Wolfe's last words. No\ndoubt that is what she thought when she wrote the note, but I have\na perfectly distinct and vivid recollection of hearing my mother, many\nyears ago, when I was a child, tell to me and to some other children\nwhat I believe to be the true story about 'Wolfe and Gray's Elegy.\nThe story was that when he was on his way across the river for the\n^issault on Quebec, 'Wolfe read (or spoke) that particular verse to the\nofficers standing round him, and said :\n'\nI would rather have written\nthose lines. Gentlemen, than take Quebec' And that is why the last\nline, The paths of glory lead but to the grave,' was inscribed on his\ntombstone. (If not on the tombstone, then on some memorial to\n'Wolfe ; I am not clear on this point) . . .\nThis . . . seems to me worth mentioning, because it shows that there\nwas a clear association between Wolfe and the line from Gray's Elegy not\nonly in my mother's mind (which you mention), but also in my mind.\"\n- \" Duty done in the face of pain or despair, of mortal danger or of\n-certain death can be applied with cui'ious exactness to the behaviour\nof Wolfe during the last weeks of his life. When I -wrote the words,\nhowever, I was not thinking of W^olfe.\n\f374 J. G. Piddington [part\nof Sarpedon's speech to Glaucus in the tweKth book of\nthe Iliad. Whether the variations from the origmal are\ndue to the accident of his having transcribed the Hnes\nfrom memory, or from his having altered them to suit\nhis own mood, must be uncertain ; but never surely has-\na memorable passage been illustrated in a fashion so\nstriking and so glorious.\nBut since, alas ! ignoble age must come.\nDisease, and death's inexorable doom,\nThat life which others pay, let us bestow.\nAnd give to fame what we to nature owe,\nBrave let us fall, or honoured if we live.\nOr let us glory gain, or glory give.\nSuch, men shall own. deserve a sovereign state,\nEnvied by those who dare not imitate.^\nIt seems, then, probable that '\/o\/xei' in Script I includes\nan allusion to Wolfe's death, and that it should be con-\nnected with the four quotations of \" The paths of glory\nlead but to the grave \" in Scripts D, F, J, and K.\nTo illustrate the general meaning of (o\/xer I cited from\nJebb's Romanes Lecture the story of Lord Granville's\nquoting Sarpedon's speech to Glaucus, when the pre-\nliminary articles of the Treaty of Paris were brought to\nhim for consideration during his mortal illness. It was\nthis Treaty of Paris which settled the affairs of Europe\nat the close of the Seven Years' War ; and of this\nWar Wolfe's capture of Quebec was one of the out-\nstanding events. It is strange that there should be this\ntwo-fold association of the Seven Years' War with Sar-\npedon's speech.^ That the intelligence responsible for the\n^ I have examined five or six different Lives of Wolfe, and none\nof them gives this story except Bradley. The writer of the article\n\" Wolfe in the Diet, of National Biograph'j makes a very brief reference\nto it. Mrs. Salter tells me that she had never heard the story, and\nhas never read A. G. Bradley's Wolfe.\n2 Robert Wood, the original authority for the story about Granville,\nends his account thus .\n\" After a serious pause of some minutes, he desired to hear the\nTreaty read, to which he listened with great attention, and recovered\nspirits enough to declare the approbation of a dying statesman (I use\n\f100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 375\nscripts was familiar with both associations I do not claim ;\nbut it seems to me highly probable that it knew the\nassociation with Wolfe, and possible that it knew the\nassociation with Granville.^\nhis own. words) '\non the most glorious war. and most honourable peace,\nthis nation ever saw.'\nThis suggests that Sarpedon's speech was associated in Granville's-\nmind, not only with his own condition, but with the Seven Years' War.\n^ Although when she first read my paper in MS. Mrs. Salter did\nnot remember the Granville story, it is practically certain that she had\nonce read it. Sir Lawrence Jones, when my paper was read at a.\nPrivate Meeting of the S.P.R., pointed out that the story is told in\nMatthew Arnold's On Translating HoniPr ; and a few days later Mrs.\nSalter wrote to tell me that, as she had read Arnold's book in her\ncollege days, she must once have known the story. She informed me\nlater that the Granville anecdote is given in the second edition of Walter\nLeafs Iliad published in 1900, which she thinks she has made use of. She\nhas, however, no conscious recollection of having read it in this Ijook.\n\\ATiile it is thus practically certain that Mrs. Salter had at one time\nknown of the association of Sarpedon's 'ioixiv with Granville, she has\nno recollection of having loiown of its association with Wolfe ; and\nit is to the association with Wolfe that the scrijjts point. Not that\nit matters one way or the other ; for even if it were certain that\nMrs. Salter had once upon a time Imown of the association with Wolfe,\nthis would not make it any easier to explain the coincidences between\nthe scripts in a normal way.\n\f376 T. W. Mitchell [part\nREVIEWS.\nI. An Outline of Abiiortnal Psychologij. By William M'Dougall,\nF.R.S. London: Methuen & Co. Ltd. Pp. xvi + 572.\nPrice 15s. net.\nThis book will be welcomed by students of both normal and\nabnormal psychology. It is a complement to the author's\nwell-known Oufliae of Psi\/chology, and the two A^olumes are to\nbe regarded as parts of one work. The inclusion of abnormal\npsychology in a work on general psji-chology is of great advan-\ntage to the student, for when he comes to the study of morbid\nmental processes he is already acquainted with the author's\noutlook on all questions of normal psychology. The importance\nof this is particularly great in a science like psychology, in\nwhich, even u]Jon fundamental principles, there is still so much\ndifference of opinion.\nThis book is not a text-book of psychiatry or of psycho-\ntherapeutics. Its standpoint is that of the student of human\nnature and human behaviour. The author is not concerned\nwith the classification of diseases or with the psychology of\ndefinite clinical types of mental disorder. He deals rather with\ntypes of abnormal mental j^rocess, such as dissociation, halluci-\nnation, delusion, and seeks to understand them in terms of the\ngeneral principles laid down in the earlier volume. He dis-\ncusses such topics as hypnosis and suggestion, conflict and\nrepression, autoniatisms and somnambulisms, not from the point\nof view of medical practice but from that of psychological\ntheory.\nDr. M\"Dougall gives an outline of the various schools of\nabnormal psychology existing at the present time, and declares\nhimself more in accord with the views of the psycho-analytical\nschool than with those of any other well-marked group. The\npure mechanists and behaviourists are anathema to him ;\n\fICO] Revieivs 311\nJanet's intellectualistic and sensationist descriptions and inter-\npretations of abnormal mental phenomena are the product of a\nsystem of psychology against which Dr. M'Dougall has long\nprotested ;\nonly when psycho-jDathologists describe disorderly\nmental process in terms of a hormic or purposive psychology\ndoes he consider their work to be truly fruitful. Therefore he\nbelieves that Professor Freud has done more for the advance-\nment' of psychology than a,ny student since Aristotle.\" Yet he\nby no means accepts all Freud's teaching, and a great part of\nthe book consists of a running commentary on his views,\nespecially those to which Dr. M'Dougall is most strongly\nopposed. He thinks both Freud and Adler are addicted to the\nvice of over-generalization and exaggeration in the exposition of\ntheir theories, and that Jung has given psycho-analytic theory\na turn in the right direction. But Dr. M'Dougall is not a\nJungian and he is not a Freudian. He afhliates himself to a\ngroup, represented in America by Dr. Morton Prince and in\nEngland by the late Dr. Rivers, who have seen both the truths\nand the errors of Freud's teaching, and have sought to incor-\nporate the truths in the general body of psychological science.\nThere are several sections of the book which are of special\ninterest to students of psj^chical research. There are three\nchapters dealing with hypnosis and the theories of hypnosis and\nsuggestion ; three chapters in which are discussed such topics\nas dissociation, repression, and automatisms ; and five chapters\ndevoted to multiple personality and the theory of personality\nand of its dismtegration.\nDr. M'Dougall's views on the nature of hypnosis and his\ntheory of suggestion are well kno\\An from his former \"writings.\nHe gives here an admirable account of the hypnotic state and\nof its most characteristic phenomena. On the theoretical side\nhe reproduces part of his paper on The State of the Brain\nduring Hypnosis \" which was published in Brain in 1908. He\nis of opinion that any theory of the hypnotic state must\nconsist of t^\\o parts : it must describe the condition of the\nbrain during hypnosis, and it must explain the nature of\nrapport. This is, perhaps, to ask too much. In the present\nstate of our knowledge we can do little more than guess about\nthe state of the brain during hypnosis, just as we cannot do\nmuch more than guess about the state of the brain during\n2b\n\f378 T. W. Mitchell [part\nordinary waking life. We should be content for the present if\nwe can give an intelligible account of the state of the mind\nduring hypnosis. To explain the nature of rapjwrt is the\nessential problem for any theory of the hypnotic state. Dr.\nM'Dougall has arrived at what is practically the same con-\nclusion as that put forward by Freud : ra-pport depends upon\nthe coming into play of an \" instinct of submission.\" These\ntwo authorities differ, however, in so far as Dr. M'Dougall\nregards submission as a primary instinct, an irreducible element\nof mental life, ^\\hile Freud derives submission, in the form of\nmasochism, from the sexual instinct.\nThere is an interesting chapter on dissociation in which Dr.\nM'Dougall maintains that this process should not be confused\nwith repression. He points out that since repression has come\nto be widely accepted as the chief cause of forgetting, many\nwriters treat of repression and dissociation as though the two\nterms were synonymous. He, on the other hand, thinks there\nare good grounds for distinguishing the process of repression\nfrom that of dissociation, as also the state of continued repres-\nsion from a continuing state of dissociation. He does not deny\nthat repression may prepare the way for dissociation, and that\nactive repression may maintain a dissociation, but he does not\nthink the evidence warrants the belief that dissociation is\nalways j^receded by repression. In locahsed dissociation the\nonset seems to be, as a rule, sudden, and in many cases it sets\nin at the moment of some emotional shock. Dr. M'Dougall's\ndiscussion of this topic is timely, for many students of abnormal\npsychology have felt that psycho-analysts have shirked the\nproblem of the wide differences between the massive dis-\nsociations of hysteria and the so-called '\ndissociation '\nproduced\nby repression in the other psycho-neuroses and in normal\npeople.\nIn dealing with multiple personality Dr. M'Dougall discusses\nbriefly the alternating type, and at greater length the co-\nconscious type and trance personalities. He cites as examples\nof alternating personality the case of Mary Reynolds and the\nHanna case ; and he is inclined to include in this class the\ncases which Janet calls dominating somnambulisms,\"' e.g. his\nLeonie, Felida X. and Marcelline. Of co-existing or co-con-\nscious personalities he selects the B.C.A. and Beauchamp cases\n\f100] Reviews 379\nof Dr. Morton Prince, the case of Maria, recorded by Professor\nC. E. Cory, and the Doris Fischer case. In illustration of the\nmain features of trance personalities he describes shortly\nFlournoy's case of Helene Smith.\nDr. M'Dougall enters a protest against the attitude of most\nmen of science towards the problems raised by trance per-\nsonalities. He says that when such men as Henry Sidgwick,\nWilliam James, Henri Bergson and Hans Driesch \"'\nhave studied\nthe evidence over many years and have pronounced themselves\nconvinced that it is of a nature that demands further careful\nstudy, it is surely a little presumptuous for young scientists\nwho have never deigned to pay any attention to it to dismiss\nit with indifference or contempt.\"\nIn his closing chapters on the theory of personality and of\nits disintegration Dr. M'Dougall adheres to the monadic view\nof personahty which he put before our Society in his presi-\ndential address in 1920.

Proceedings of the Boston Society for Psychic Research.\nVol. I. 1926. \"The Psychic in the House.\" By\nWalter Franklin Prince. Pp. vi + 284. Boston, 1926.\nThis volume is the first official issue of the new Boston Society\nfor Psychic Research, a society that has been founded, since the\nreorganisation of the American Society for Psychical Research,\nto try to preserve a scientific attitude towards the problems of\npsychical research.\nThe present contribution to serious discussion constitutes, in\nour opinion, one of the most interesting studies that has\nhitherto appeared in a neglected field. For it is a study rare\nin psychical Hterature : a story of haunting recorded apparently\n\f380 E. J. Dingwall [part\nwith scrupulous accuracy by an expert observer, and enriched\nby a series of supplementary descriptions based on contem-\nporary visions experienced by, and experiments with his foster\ndaughter, Theodosia B. Prince, for whom he claims supernormal\npowers, a claim which it is difficult to resist. In three houses\nout of seven in wliich T.^ has lived phenomena have occurred of\nwhich certain of the auditory class were heard by P., who had\nnever heard such sounds in twenty-six previous residences.\nMoreover, these auditory and other phenomena in one of the\nhouses were, seemingly at least, connected with past events,\nwhich were revealed by T. in a series or group of crystal\nvisions, veridical portions of which were confirmed later by\nrelatives of the former inhabitants of the house. This in rough\noutline is the story of the Psychic in the House. The Psychic\nis T., and the House is each of the three houses in which she\nlived since psychogenetic occurrences began. The first question\nthat naturally arises is as to the real character of the occur-\nrences. Were these raps and other auditory phenomena due\nto some purely normal cause, or Avere they mere figments of\nthe imagination : hallucinatory experiences due to some un-\nexplained set of contributory factors ? Or were the crystal\nvisions (proved in part to have been veridical) mere guesswork\non the part of T. or due to information normally acquired and\nthen reproduced in the form of pretended visions in the\ncrystal ? Or to stretch the normal hypothesis still further :\nare Ave to suppose that the whole record is a carefully pre-\npared hoax by P., with his wife and daughter as collaborators,\nand designed for the purpose of self-advertisement or cynical\namusement 1 Taking the record as it stands, with personal\nknowledge of all the chief parties in the case, this last sup-\nposition appears to me too grotesque for discussion. With\nregard to the other hypotheses, we will consider the crystal\nvisions first.\nScrying is too common a faculty to excite surprise, nor need\nit disturb us that T. should be a successful crystal-gazer.\nP. has shoAvn that the possibility of T. having become\nacquainted normally with the facts revealed in the visions is\n^ In the following review the letter T. will denote Theodosia B. Prince\n(the Doris Fischer of the former case of multiple personality) and P. will\ndenote Dr. W. F. Prince, the author of the volume under consideration.\n\f100] Reviews 381\nso remote that it can be dismissed as a reasonable hypothesis.\nAccepting P. as a bona fide witness this would appear to be\nthe case, and as any serious discussion of the book pre-\nsupposes the theory of P.\"s integrity the hypothesis need not be\nconsidered. Therefore in the following discussion I shall assume\n[a] that T.'s \" crystal visions \" are what is usually meant\nby that term, and (6) that in addition they reveal knowledge\nof events supernormaUy acquired.\nThe question of the auditory and other phenomena appears\nto be of a rather different nature. Taking the raps alone we\ncannot assume, I think, as P. seems inchned to do, that aU\nthese sounds were supernormaUy produced. Not only did raps\noccur in the houses, but they also occurred in P.'s New York\noffice and also in the office of a Dr. G. It is difficult to\nassume that all these sounds were normal, a supposition that\nwould not be so hard were P. not the narrator of the incidents.\nBut possibly it can be assumed that some were normally\nproduced, and of these, some of those in P.'s office might be\nconveniently selected. These appear only to have occurred\nwhen P. was left alone. Thus at 1.35 p.m. on November 30,\n1919, Miss T. and Mrs. S. had left w^hen a sharp rap was\nheard. The same thing occurred on December 2, at 9.10 a.m.\nP. asks, \" If normal, why have I never heard one when another\nperson is about ? And why must I be alone if they are\nsupernormal ?\n\" The answer to this question does not seem to\nbe difficult. P. hears them (assuming their normal character)\njust because he is alone. When others are present such sounds,\nif they occur at all, are supposed to be connected with those\npresent. When the observer is alone, sounds cannot be thus\nexplained and often are therefore inexplicable. For the purpose\nof example it may be instructive to consider the following\nillustration of my meaning. While writmg this review raps are\noccurring in my room. The last sounded as if the curtain rod\nhad been struck by a hght metal object. Other raps followed in\ndifferent parts of the room, and if I direct my attention to the\ndetection of somids a number are instantly remarked which\nbefore were unnoticed. The wicker chair emits rustUng and\ncreeping sounds ;\ntaps occm- on the panes of the window ; and\nfrom the legs of a smaU table at the other side of the room\ncome sharp cracking sounds. I get up and try to trace the\n\f382 E. J. Dingwall [part\norigin of certain of these raps, but a goodly proportion elude\nme, and I can discover no cause for the sharp metallic rap\nwhich I localised as upon the curtain rod. Now because I fail\nto determine the cause of these sounds I do not therefore\nconsider them supernormal. It is true that the thought comes\ninto my mind that they may be so, but on analysing my\nreasons I find that the chief is that the medium Willy Schneider\nis in the next room and that such disturbances on a greatly\nincreased scale have already been reported upstairs. It is only\nwhen there are some apparent grounds for the belief that\nnormal sounds are considered as possibly supernormal. Thus\nin an alleged haunted house, numberless happenings which are\nof almost everyday occurrence in ordinary houses become\nvested with a mysterious import and take their place along\nwith other \" occult phenomena which demand explanation.\nP. is concerned with raps : the sounds may be produced by\nspirits for his edification : spirits with their alleged extended\npowers of locomotion can easily follow him, so what is more\nnatural than that they should rap in his office ? He hears\nnothing (just as I hear nothing) when others are present : when\nhe is alone and more easily disturbed by chance sounds, the raps\nare noticed and immediately they assume importance, not\nbecause of their intrinsic character, but because of the associa-\ntions which they arouse.^\nThese considerations, however, do not invahdate the other\nsounds heard by more than one person and sometimes re-\nsembling bangs as if by a stuffed club and the trampings of a\nperson on the stairs. These sounds are common to haunts at\n^ Since writintc this paragraph raps seem to have begun in my room\nat the S.P.R.\nThe fact of my remarking them is doubtless due to my consideration\nof those heard by P. in relation to the arguments outlined above.\nThus this morning a sharp rap occurred which I localisgd as upon the\nglass shade of a lamp standing in an isolated position near the window.\nA visitor who happened to be present also heard this rap, but thought\nthat it occurred away from the window whilst agreeing that it was\ncertainly something apparently striking glass. On audibly requesting a\nrepetition of the sound nothing was heard for some thirty seconds, when\na startlingly loud rap came clearly from a large mahogany piece of\nfurniture at another side of the room.\nI have no explanation for these soxmds, but have little doubt as to\ntheir normal nature.\n\f100] Reviews 383\nall times and in all places, but \\v\\mt appears to me more\ninexplicable than the sounds themselves is P.'s attitude regard-\ning them. We are told on page 68 that night after night\nthe most, or at least a large percentage, of the raps seemed to\ncome from the desk. I tested my judgment in every way\nI could think of and became certain that I was right.\" And\nagain on page 266 : \"I am not able to think of a precaution\nwhich I did not take or a theory however wild which I did\nnot test.\"'\nNow if there is one controversy that can easily be set at\nrest, it is that concerning the objective or subjective nature of\nthe phenomena of hauntings. Are the sounds and impressions\nin some way mentally received and then externalised ; or are\nthey objective realities in the sense that air waves are set in\nmotion from a distant point and aurally received as is the case\nwith other normal sounds ? We cannot discover in P.'s work\nany interest regarding this fundamental problem. Yet he\nadmits that he is a slightly deaf person \"\n(p. 52) and that\ncertain of the raps were \" below the threshold of my imperfect\nhearing \"'\n(p. 142). At the same time he hopes \" that it is\nnot necessary to explain to readers that a shghtly deaf person\nis as able to give as trustworthy testimony regarding sounds\nwhich he does hear as persons with normal hearing are regard-\ning the fainter sounds which they only can hear \"\n(p. 52).^\nNow since he asserts that not only were the majority of the\nraps seemingly centered about a desk, but also that the\nshakings of a bed were so common that they settled down\ninto a formula ''\n(p. 91), it would appear that here was an\nideal opportunity to make use of self-recording electrical appar-\natus. It would have been easy to amplify the raps in the desk\nand to devise experiments with a view to determining the\nactual or apparent movements of the bed. It is true that\nnow and then P. used an instrument to magnify the sounds\nfor the benefit of his own hearing, but no automatic record was\never taken of any of the physical phenomena. This amazing\nneglect is all the more remarkable when it is remembered that\nP. is fully cognisant of the controversy mentioned above. But\n^ This is true, but the inability to hear what may be the commences\nment of a series of normal sounds which culminate in a loud one may\nbe a serious hindrance in discovering the origin of the sound in question.\n\f384 E. J. Dingioall [PAET\ntaking the record as it stands, it is difificult to devise any\neffective reply to the critic who assumes that all the physical\nphenomena were hallucinatory.\n^\nFrom what P. has written, however, it seems clear, and at\nany rate we shall assume it to be so, that certain supernormal\nphenomena occurred A^hich were closely linked up with the\nhouse, the previous inhabitants, and the psychic T. What\nthat connexion is, is a problem as old as haunting itself. The\nraps and peculiar sounds as of walking on the stairs later\nidentified as bemg connected with a former inhabitant now\ndeceased : the connected series of visions referring to a past\ntime : the odd behaviour of a dog M'hich apjDeared to act\ntowards apparitions seen by a percipient as if it saw them\nalso : the additional supplementary evidence of other persons\nwho under similar circumstances experienced identical sensations\nof an unpleasant and terrifying nature : all these occurrences\ndemand some theory, but can that theory be supplied ? P., if\nwe read him rightly, inclmes to a spiritistic interpretation,\nalthough we cannot pretend to believe that the support he\nbrings to it will bear the Aveight of that hyj)othesis. For\ninstance, on the night of January 17, 1924, the apparition of\nT.'s grandmother appears to her (according to her report).\nShe had just put out the light after reading the paper when\nher little dog lying near the radiator \" leaped into the air.\"\nT. looked at the place where the dog was apparently looking\nand saw the phantom standing at the foot of the bed. P. in\nhis discussion of the case is at pains to explain the action of\nthe dog in its relation to the apparition. He can offer no\nreasonable hypothesis either for the' dog's conduct or for the\nfact that T. saw a grandmother whom she had only seen for\na period of about three months when alive. Now P. has yet\nto show that the dog savj the ajojMTiHon at all. Suppose the\nradiator was very hot and the dog had snviggled close to it\nand suddenly got burnt (it was a January night). In addition\n1 The work of such a critic is made more easy by the fact that there\nis an almost total lack of independent witnesses outside the family\nregarding the raps inside the house. Mr. Mansfield was at the house\nin January 1925, and heard various sounds which he could not explain;\nbut ills account is scarcely convincing, and apparently he made no\nattempt to investigate the sounds at the place from which it seemed,\nthey were proceeding.\n\f100] Reviews 385\nthe light went out at that moment and the \" moon probably\nshone \"\n(p. 164) into the room. The dog jumped up and\nhowled. Is this action so pecuhar ? Is it necessary to suppose\nthat the dog saw the apparition 1 We cannot see the necessity,\nneither can Me understand what is so very remarkable in the\nappearance of the grandmother instead of anyone else. We\ncannot begin to understand why a selective factor operated\nuntil (for example) we can discover what associations were at\nthat moment latent or alive in the percipient's consciousness.\nT. had been reading a paper. Can it not plausibly be sug-\ngested that some stimulus was derived therefrom residting in\nan apparition ? \"If the grandmother's spirit does actually\nsurvive the death of her body . . . \/' P. writes, she might,\nfor aught we can say, have the curiosity to take one peek at\nher granddaughter and be content with that to all eternity\n(p. 165). Very possibly, but why does the spirit of a grand-\nmother terrify a dog ; and whj^ does she content herself with\none peek \"\"\nand not many peeks \" 1 It has yet to be\nshown u23on P.\"s hypothesis that spirits in order to observe\nthose on earth have in so doing to show themselves to those\nwho can see them, and I can hardly suppose that P. would\nassent to such a proposition, although his expressions such as\nthe \" single journeys \" taken by \" intelUgent entities \" might\nlend weight to that assumption.\nWith regard to the group of crystal visions it would seem\nclear that part at least of the information was derived super-\nnormally, and P. suggests there is worth considering evidence\nfor spirit causation in the main mass of the visions \"\n(p. 202).\nThis might have been plausibly urged had it not been a fact\nthat all, or at least the vast majority, of the statements had\nbeen known to the two Misses Tubby who subsequently verified\nthem. And unfortunately, immediately after the Princes had\nmoved into the house formerly occupied by the Tubby family\nand phenomena began, P. told Miss G. 0. Tubby of the first\nexperience.^ Now this must have awakened in the sisters\nTubby a mass of buried memories, and knowing the results\nobtained through T.'s mediumship in other directions may have\naroused just that suitable condition in which subhminal material\ncan be tapped. One of the IVIisses Tubby is herself an auto-\n1 Cf. also p. 183.\n\f386 E. J. Dingwall [part\nmatist, and the other a lady with much experience of seances\nand the mental and psychical temperament Avhich we are beginning\nto associate with persons who obtain successful results with\ntrance mediums Avhere non-experimental telepathic processes are\nconcerned.\nThe attraction that the spiritistic interpretation has for P. is\nwell illustrated by another incident. On November 23, 1919,\nT. described an apparition before her which was recognised as\na figure occurring in the visions whom P. calls Pelmore. T.\ndescribed the figure, and in the course of her description\ndeclared that it was touching P. Avith its finger. P. writes :\n\" I had my hands clasped in front of me. Before I could\nglance at my hands or notice consciously how they were\nplaced, I noted, at this instant, a chilly feeling on the index\nfinger of my left hand, and before I was able to speak, a\nmuscle just before the joint which joins the finger to the hand\nbegan to twitch. ... I had no thought of the finger until\nmy attention was thus directed to it.\" P. then asks T.,\nWhere is he touching ?\n\" T.'s answer is, \" On the first\nfinger of your left hand \"\n(p. 77). This sudden sense of chill\nin one j^articular part of the body, and that one Avhich was\nlater alleged to he the part touched by the apparition, is\ncertainly curious and at first sight might appear to lend\nsupport to the view that certain at least of the phenomena of\nhaunting are objective in character.^\nThe view commonly held in England that all the phenomena\nare subjective appears to be made more complicated by the\nfact that it is never urged that all poltergeist phenomena are\nsubjective, and it is difficult to draw a hard and fast line\nbetween the two classes of occurrences. When the distinction\nis discussed seriously at all, the only way out of the dilemma\nappears to be to maintain that all poltergeist phenomena are\nfraudulent or all haunting phenomena imaginary, a position\nI do not believe to be tenable.\nWhatever may be the ultimate solution of these questions,\nthe fact remains that the method adopted by Dr. Prince,\n^ For the sensation of cold in relation to apparitions, of. Cases 28, 223,\n286, .302, and 540 in \" Phantasms of the Living,\" Proceedings, 1922,\nxxxiii. 367 (Case G201); and for a medical view, cf. Zeitschrift f. krit.\nOhkultismus, 1926, i. 217-222.\n\f100] Bevieivs 387\nsupplemented wherever possible by the use of mechanically\nregistering instruments, is likely to be the only one which can\nfurther our knowledge of the phenomena of haunting. That\nthere are contributory factors both in the house and in the\npercipient appears to be a reasonable assumption. Whether\nthere are yet other factors remains to be seen. It is to be\nhoped that the author's observations will continue and that\nefforts may be made so to control the auditory phenomena\nthat permanent records may be made under irreproachable\nconditions of control. Even if we have no doubt concerning\nthe integrity of the compiler of the records, it must be remem-\nbered that personal judgments, although of value, are by no\nmeans final in scientific matters, and thus the automatic\nregistration of the phenomena of haunting, and confirmation by\nindependent, experienced and reliable observers are indispensable\nin investigations of this nature.\nj Dingwall\nIII.

Stuttgart-Berlin-Leipzig\n(Union Deutsche Verlagsgesellschaft), 1926.\nThis volume, commonly known in Germany as the \" Sieben-\nmannerbuch,\" is in the nature of a reply to the work, Der\njphysikalische Mediwmismus, by Dr. Gulat-Wellenburg, Count\nCarl von Khnckowstroem and Dr. Hans Rosenbusch (the\n\" Dreimannerbuch \").^\nDr. von Schrenli-Notzing opens the discussion in an intro-\nductory chapter in which he deals with methods of investigation\nand sources of error. His task is rendered difficult and some-\nwhat delicate by the fact that any adequate reply to the\n1 See the review in the Proceedings, Pt. 99, July 1926, pp. 3.33-,340.\nThe work now under consideration is primarily a defence against the\ntheories advanced in the \u2022'\nDreimannerbuch,\" and is also in many respects\n^ counter-attack against the authors of that work.\n\f388 E. J. Dingwall [part\nobjections in the \" Dreimannerbuch \" would mean the partial i\nbetrayal of his present associates whose standards of evidence !\n(if we can judge them from the contents of this volume) are\nsomewhat different from his own.\nThe authors of this book appear to be of the opinion that\nthe majority of workers in psychical research are reliable in the\nstatements they make concerning the conditions under which\nthey work and the appearance of the phenomena which are\npresented to them. But unfortunately this faith in authority\nis not justified by the facts. Let us take a single example.\nIn his discussion of the evidence against the medium Eva C,\nDr. von Schrenk-Notzing rightly insists on the fundamental\nimportance of the hand-control. He quotes various authorities,\na.nd on page 213 he adds the testimony of that eminent\ninvestigator, the late Dr. Gustave Geley. He writes :\n\" Through-\nout the investigations of Dr. Geley which lasted for several\nyears the hands [of the medium] were always controlled,\" and\nadds the direct statement of Dr. Geley from his Ectoplasmie et\nClairvoyance (Paris, 1924, p. 198) :\n\" Je repete que ses mains\nrestaient tozijours en rue et tenues en dehors des rideaux.\"\n[Italics Geley's.] Now the authors of the \" Dreimannerbuch\nhave insisted on the unreliability of even expert observers in\nthe field of psychical research. They doubt the accuracy of\ntheir statements, for they know that the assurances of rigid\ncontrol are often baseless. The spirit of fundamental scepticism\nwhich pervades their work is created largely by an omnipresent\ndoubt concerning the accuracy of any record which may be\npresented for their criticism.\nIn a reply to their objections it might have been thought\nthat care would have been exercised in selecting examples\nwhich support the contentions of the seven writers that the\naccounts of observers can be considered reliable. Fortunately\nwe have an instance here of a direct statement by an acknow-\nledged expert and by one whose experiments are often men-\ntioned in the \" Siebenmannerbuch.\" Moreover, the crucial part\nof that statement is italicised by their author in the authori-\ntative work from which they are taken. Can that statement\nbe tested ? It can, and by irrefutable photographic evidence\nobtamed during the sittings themselves, and pubhshed by Dr.\nGeley in the same volume. What do we find 1 We find that,\n\f100] Reviews 389\nthe photographs show that in the four which show both hands,\nin one only is one hand held. What becomes of Dr. Geley's\nstatement, quoted by Dr. von Schrenk-Notzing, although pre-\nviously exposed in the Proceedings S.P.R., 1924, xxxiv, p. 332, in\na review of Dr. von Schrenk-Notzing's own work ? Can it be\nthought so unreasonable that serious inquirers refuse to credit\nthe reports of psychical researchers when in these fundamental\nparticulars misstatements are published and reported by the\nprincipal workers in this field 1 What becomes of the oft-\nrepeated stories of Kluski ? Had he one hand free as the\nphotographs show was the case with Eva C. during her series\nof sittings at the Institut Metapsychique Internationale ? The\nhasis of the scepticism which the authors of this volume so\nmuch deplore is founded on the works of psychical researchers\nthemselves, and I claim no exception for myself. Distrusting\nmy owTi observations, I distrust those of others, and I have\nalready seen enough to provide ample grounds for that distrust.\nObservations in this field, in order to be of value, must be\nchecked and counter-checked by independent witnesses of irre-\nproachable antecedents, and if possible registered by mechanical\nrecording instruments. Moreover, the mental attitude of the\ninvestigator is probably even more important than his powers\nof accurate observation. The authors of the \" Dreimanner-\nbuch have recognised this fact, and Herr Lambert, in his\nadmirable survey of the Palladino case in the present volume,\nindicates that he has partially grasped this cardinal principle in\nconnexion with this medium, although it is to be hoped that\nhis distrust of authorities will increase as he pursues his\nstudies. For, together with his collaborators, he is too apt to\naccept stories at their face value without an appraisal of the\nsources from which those stories spring. In this respect Pro-\nfessor Oesterreich\"s defence of the validity of Miss Goligher's\nphenomena is especially interestmg. His attack on Dr. Rosen-\nbusch needs no reply, for he has failed to grasp the essential\npoints of the criticism of that author. For Professor Oester-\nreich apparently believes all that Crawford said he observed\nand all the stories that visitors related after leaving the seance\nroom. Dr. Fournier D'Albe, in his criticism of Dr. Crawford,\nwrote that it seemed to him that Dr. CraAvford had \" estab-\nlished a habit of thought which became impervious even to\n\f390 E. J. Dingicall [part\nfairly obvious evidence of artificiality.\" ^ The importance of\nthat observation, not only in connexion with Dr. Crawford but\nin connexion with other investigators, cannot be overestimated.\nThe study of occultism has so odd an effect on the human\nmind that even after a few years, when the conviction of the\nreality of supernormal phenomena has become fixed, the most\ntransparent deceptions are gravely cited as marvels of medium\n-\nship. Moreover, it need not imply that the critical faculty is\nlost in other directions or that technical ability is in any way\nweakened. The belief in the integrity of the subject causes\nthe results to be accepted without question, and quite irrelevant\nreasons are often advanced for this trust iii the reliability of\nthe medium. The psychic is either religiovis, or in a high\nsocial position, or is a serious inquirer himself, and therefore (so\nthe argument runs) the phenomena must be genuine, thus\nrendering all adequate precautions both damaging and offensive.\nThe investigators are thus led deeper and deeper into the work,\nand in proportion as their beUef is confirmed, the less do they\nsee, and the more likely they are to put a favourable con-\nstruction uj^on the little accidents of the seance room. If a\nthread is seen it is an \" ectoplastic filament \" ; if toes or feet,\nand even the nails are felt, it is not a foot but a structure\n\"\n(E. E. F. D'Albe, lb., 50). If the medium continually kicks\nthe investigators under the table (Frau Silbert), the kicks are\ncaused by psychic levers, the suckers of which, although strong\nenough to grip the skirts of the ladies with a powerful grasp,\nwither away under the devastating effect of the human eye\nwhen it glances under the table. Similarly with the same\nmedium so feebly supported by Professor Daniel Walter in the\npresent volume, the investigator must not suppose that the\nwarm object supplied with toes and clothed in a stocking\nmaterial which hands the investigator objects below the table,\nis the medium's foot ; it is a \" psychic structure \" possessing\nthese strange qualities. Evidence is adduced, not because the\nphenomena can in any Avay be proved, but because of past\nexperiences which must have been gemiine \" (cf. Guzik, p. 236),\nor because the investigators have no inkling of how normal\nmethods could produce the results. If their mmds did not in\nsome strange way become influenced by their occult experiences,\n1 The Goligher Circle (London, 1922), p. 49.\n\f100] Rerieivs 391\nsuch methods of reasomng would be impossible. Their passion\nfor the supernormal, derived either from their hope in it as a\nmeans of assisting faith in the reahsation of survival after\ndeath or from the pleasure that the eerie atmosphere of the\nseance room brings to them, has made them accept phenomena\non evidence which would be dismissed contemptuously in any\nother field.\nDr. Tischner continues the defence m a chapter dealing with\nthe reports pubUshed in the older hterature ; but his work,\nlike other contributions to this volume, is somewhat weakened\nby his almost naive faith in the truth of what observers state\nin their reports, and it is curious to note that the authors of\nthe \" Dreimannerbuch exhibit the same peculiarity, although\nin their case it is usually the reports against the authenticity\nof psychic phenomena to which credit is given.\nIn the ordinary physical sciences the reports of scientific\nobservers can usually be believed when deahng with broad\njorinciples of investigation, and, if more deUcate experiments are\nconcerned, their results can usually be checked by other com-\njjetent workers in the same field. But in psychical research,\nwhere the material for investigation is so rare, and where the\nopportimity for verification by other observers is often im-\npossible, it is of paramount importance that some reasonable\nguarantees should be provided that the conditions are actually\nwhat the observers state that they are.\nThus we see that in the present volume the defence of Miss\nC4oligher, Jan Guzik, Nielsen and Frau Silbert is no defence at\nall ; it is simply a collection of vague statements of which\nscarcely one can be properly verified. On the other hand, the\nrepUes to the criticisms of Palladino, Tomczyk, Eva C. and\nSchneider are good, although more might have been made of\nthe importance of the Schneider mediumship in relation to the\nhistory of investigation. The volume has fulfilled one purpose\ncompletely. It has shown the unanswerable character of the\nmain contentions of the authors of the '\"\nDreimannerbuch.\"\nThat contention is that up to the present no adequate evidence\nhas been adduced which would lead a critical mind to accept\nthe existence of physical phenomena from a mere acquaintance\n\\dth the literature only. Such phenomena (if they reaUy occur)\nare at present so rare that it ^^\u2022ould seem that scientific men\n\f392 E. J. Dingwall [PAJRT 100]\ncan scarcely hope to have any extensive practical acquaintance\nwith them. It therefore behoves every worker in this field to\nconduct his observations in such a way that posterity may\nhave some grounds for accejjting them as reliable and accurate.\nJudging from the standard of certain of the authors of the\n\" Siebenmannerbuch \" that does not seem at present to be a\nlikely possibility.\nThe book is well printed and arranged, although it is difficult\nto understand ^^'hy an index has been omitted.\nE. J. DlNG^VALL.\n\fTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF PL0TINU8, AND ITS INTEREST\nTO THE STUDENT OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nBy Mr. G. W. Lambert.\n{This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society\non June 2, 1926.)\nReferences to the philosophy of Plotinus are not in-\nfrequent in the Uterature of psychical research, and have\naroused a certain amount of interest in his work on the\npart of students who would gladly learn more about it.\nUnfortunately the literature on the subject is scanty, and\nin some respects defective, and the English reader who\ndoes not know Greek will find the task of informing himself a\ndifficult one. This paper is intended to assist such enquirers\nby giving them a summary of Plotinus' psychological\ntheories, in so far as they deal with the subject matter of\npsychical research ; and as the paper is intended for the\nstudent of that subject, and not for the classical scholar,\nI have endeavoured to relegate matters of purely academic\ninterest to footnotes. In dealing with Plotinus it is not\npossible to dispense altogether with the apparatus of\nscholarship, because his Greek is difficult, and the text is\nfaulty. In a brief essay of this kind it is manifestly\nimpossible to stop and discuss every debatable interpre-\ntation of Plotinus' thought, and I hope the references\nI have given will enable those who are in a position to\ndo so to test the accuracy of what is necessaril}'- a very\ncondensed summary. I have appended a brief bibho-\ngraphica^ note (see p. 412), and if the reader consults the\nworks there mentioned he will find more complete biblio-\ngraphies should he wish to extend his study of the subject.\n\f, G. W. Lambert [part\nIt is unfortunate that the best critical work in English\non The Enneads^ is by a writer who has a distinct bias\nagainst psychical research, and this paper is to some\nextent an attempt to correct that bias. For instance,\nDr. Inge refers to telepathy as a \"superstition\" of the\nthird and twentieth centuries, ^ and suggests that Plotinus\nwould have no sympathy with the efforts made by\nstudents of psychical research to throw light on the\nproblem of survival.s I deal with the latter point below\n(see p. 402), and only mention it here to emphasise\n'\nthe\nfact that the enquirer who needs guidance is not well\nprovided for by current Uterature on the subject. For\nthat very reason I have tried to avoid ground which is\nabeady adequately covered by pubhshed works.

From time to time\nattempts have been made on one side or the other to\nprevent his exploitation by the opposing party, but in\nspite of all Plotinus maintains his unassailable ascendancy,\nan \"eagle soaring above the tomb of Plato.\" It is clear,\ntherefore, that he can only be acclaimed as a patron of\npsychical research in so far as that study connotes the\nfearless pursuit of truth.\n1 The PJiilosoph,, of Plotinus, W.

The extent of Myers' debt\nto Plotinus is not to be measured simply by counting the\nnumber of qvxotations from and allusions to The Enneads\nin Myers' works. His influence is traceable throughout\nMyers' prose and poetry, and did not desert him even in\nthe dry task of inventing technical terms ^ for the new\nscience to which he devoted the best part of his life.\nMoreover, it was Myers' deep interest in Neoplatonism\nwhich led some of his friends to choose a quotation from\nthe Fifth Ennead as a test in some \"cross-correspondence\"\nexperiments conducted some years ago (see below, p. 409).\nIt is also remarkable that certain psychologists on the\nContinent are beginning to put forward theories in explan-\nation of psychical phenomena which bear a strong resem-\nblance to those of Plotinus. Probably these thinkers are\ninfluenced by Fechner and Wilham James, and not by a\nstudy of The Enneads themselves, but the fact lends\ninterest to the subject, and should encourage a careful\nexamination of the older theories.\nNatural Science.\nIn the third century, as in the ancient world generally,\nthere was a tendency to interpret physical phenomena in\npsychological terms. The direction of thought is now\nreversed, and we are accustomed to interpret psychological\nphenomena in the terms of physical science. While,\ntherefore, as the reader would expect, the physical theories\nof Plotinus are of a primitive character in themselves,\nthey are of value as an aid to the understanding of his\npsychological theories, and for that reason I will give a\nbrief summary of them here.\nPlotinus held that the physical universe consisted of\nfour elements, earth, water, air, and fire ; earth and water\n\" down here \" in the lowest region of space ; above them\n1 E.g. the word \" metetherial \" : see the glossary to Human Person-\nality, vol. i. p. xix.\n\f396 G. W. Lambert [part\nair, extending to a limit somewhere this side of the moon ;\nand beyond that, \" fire,\" by which he meant a continuous\nsubstance, filhng the whole heaven, which in its incandes-\ncent state glows with a white light. This conception is\nthe nearest approach the ancients made to the theory of\nthe luminiferous ether.\nNow this universe of the four elements would be utterly\ndark and inert, a mere \" corpse \" of an universe, so to\nspeak, if it were not animated through and through by\n\" soul.\" The Great Soul which permeates the whole\nuniverse is the cause of all movement, including those\nmovements which we regard as mechanical. Its presence\nmakes the universe a living animal, the various parts of\nwhich are in sympathetic relation with one another.^\nThere never was a time, he tells us, when this universe\nwas not ensouled,^ but in imagination we can picture to\nourselves the flooding of soul into it as if it were an\nevent in time. One passage,^ of which this is the theme,\nhas acquired a special interest for students of psychical\nresearch, and is dealt with below (see page 409).\nIn another place he describes the universe as pervaded\nby soul in much the same way as a net let down into\nthe sea is swept through and stretched out by the sur-\nrounding water.* But he is careful to make it clear that\nsoul is not a form of matter, as some thinkers wrongly\nsupposed. It is rather something which transcends matter.\nBesides the Great Soul, there are in the universe many\nindividual souls, which can embody themselves in various\nkinds of matter. There are divine souls which embody\nthemselves in the ether, and make their bodies glow with\na pure white light. These are seen by us as stars. This\ndoctrine that the stars are living beings is one which\nfalls strangely on modern ears, but it has commended\nitself to several notable thinkers, including Leibniz and\nFechner. Dr. Inge, so far from classifying it with tele-\npathy as a superstition of the third century, says, \" The\ndoctrine itself does not seem to me ridiculous or improb-\nable.\" ^ This is not the place to discuss the subject\nMv. 4. :J2. ^iv. 3. !l. ^v. 1. 2. * iv. :!. !).\nP\/i. of PL, vol. i. p. 211.\n\f101] The Psychology of Plotinus 397\nfurther, and I would \" come down to earth \" at once,\nwere it not necessary to ask the reader first to hear what\nPlotinus has to tell us about the souls which inhabit the\nintervening region.\nThe souls next in rank below the Gods are the\n\" daimones.\" Plotinus does not say very much about\nthem, probably because he was well aware of the amount\nof superstition and credulity associated with the doctrine.\nWhat little he did say is calculated to remove current\nerrors and to reduce the doctrine to something which\nwould fit organically into his general system. He accepted\nthe current view that the daimones were living beings\nwhose natural habitat was the air belt between the moon\nand the Earth, and apparently believed that they could\ninvest themselves in bodies of gas and luminous ether,\n^\nand utter sounds. ^ Nor was it unreasonable to suppose\nthat they could be summoned by magical processes.^ He\nconsidered man, in respect of the divine part of his\nnature, to be superior to the daimones, and, if we are to\nbeheve Porphyry, he shocked his superstitious friends by\nsaying that it was for the daimones to come to him, and\nnot for him to go to them.* He rejected the current\nview that diseases were due to daemonic agency, and\nattributes them to \" exhaustion or excesses or deficiencies\nor mortification and other changes originating either outside\nor inside the body.\"^\nThe manner in which Plotinus deals with the doctrine\nthat each person has a tutelary daimon leaves the reader\nin some doubt whether he took it in the same sense as\nmost of his contemporaries. It is clear that he attempted\nto rationalise the belief, but it may have been necessary\nfor him to conceal his attitude to some extent ;\notherwise it\nis difficult to account for the very laboured and obscure\nlanguage of his short treatise on \" The Daimon which is\nallotted to us.\" ^ Some of the functions of the tutelary\ndaimon are now attributed to that equally elusive entity,\nthe \"censor\" of the Freudian school, and it will be inter-\nesting to see whether in the future science will restore to\n^ iii. 5. 6. 2 3^ (last sentence). * iv. 4. 43.\n^ V.P. \\0 svh fin. 5 ii. 9. 14. \" in.\n\f398 G. ]V . Lambert [past\nthe daimon any of the other powers of which he has been\ndeprived.\nSo far, then, as The Enneads show, Plotinus was by no\nmeans a credulous beUever in the crude spirituaUsm of his\nday. Nor, apparently, was he averse from experiments in\nthis field. Porphyry tells us he readily consented to\nattend an experiment for the evocation of his own daimon\nby an Egyptian priest, the result of which so terrified one\nof the attendants that the affair was brought to a sudden\nand premature conclusion.\n^\nNext in rank below the Gods and daimones came the\nsouls of men and animals, and in the following section\nI give an outline of Plotinus' views on human psychology.\n.Human Psychology.\nPlotinus deals at some length with the problem of the\nrelationship of the soul and body, and disposes of various\ninadequate hypotheses.^ If he had enlarged even more\nthan he does on this subject, it would not have been\nsurprising, considering that Porphyry argued the question\nwith him for three whole days.^ The conclusion he comes\nto is that it is truer to say that the body is in the soul,\nrather than that the soul is in the body.* The soul of\nthe individual is in continuity with all other souls and\nwith tlie Great Soul. This is proved by the fact of tele-\npathy.^ In this connection it is relevant to quote a\nfirst-hand story told us by Porphyry.\u00ae Porphyry was\ncontemplating suicide in his own house, when Plotinus\n\" perceived \" it in some supernormal fashion, and suddenly\nconfronted him, and dissuaded him from doing violence\nto himself. The event made such an impression on\nPorphyry that he never repeated the attempt.\nThe human soul, according to Plotinus, has three\nelements, which are sometimes spoken of as if they are\nparts, and sometimes as if they are themselves separate\n1 V.P. 10. - iv. 3. 20-23. ^ V.P. 13. \u2022\u00bb\niv. 3. 20 and 22.\n^ iv. 9. 3.

They correspond with the three levels of the\nphysical universe, an assumption which has the merit of\naffording a consistent background of metaphor for the\npurpose of describing psychological states and processes.\nThey are :\n(1) the divine (superconscious) part,\n(2) the reasoning (conscious) part,\n(3) the unreasoning (subconscious) part.\nThe subconscious soul embraces the principles of nutrition,\ngrowth and sex, and their connected instincts. It is this\npart of the soul which is acted upon by hypnotic influences,\nand by incantations and prayers. Magicians, with their\ndramatic ritual and singing, are well aware of this, and\nbehave accordingly, working upon the unreasoning part of\na man's soul. If the heavenly bodies play any part in\nthe transaction, they know nothing about it.^ If incan-\ntations and prayers can work effects at a distance, it is\nthrough the medium of the Great Soul.^ All souls are\nin continuous rapport with one another, but the j)ulses\nbetween them are for the most part unperceived, and the\nimpressions do not necessarily rise above the threshold of\nconsciousness.*\nPlotinus also deals at some length with the question of\nmemory. It must suffice to record here that he held\nmemory to be a piurely psychical activity, which is\nobstructed by the body,^ and when freed from that\nobstruction is greatly extended in range and power. His\nviews about the retention of memory after the death of\nthe body are dealt with below (see p. 403).\nThe similarity of certain of these views to those which\nare now being put forward by modern students to explain\nthe phenomena of hypnotism and telepathy is remarkable.\nFor instance. Dr. Tischner, in his recent book entitled\nTelepathy mid Clairvoyance, spealdng of the supernormal\nacquisition of information by mediimis, says :\n\" It gives us the impression that the subconscious mind\n-\n\u2014to make use of a spatial image\u2014is not so clearly\n1 iv. 4. 28. - iv. 4. 40-43. ^ q_ 3,\n* iv. 9. 2.

If we descend from our surface\nconsciousness, we gradually reach subconscious regions\nwhich cease to belong to a single individual. . . . These\nvery deep layers of the subconscious mind would then\nshare in a non-individual or superindividual mind, and so\nhave a knowledge of things which are quite unattainable\nto the individual mind. The difficulty of raising this\nknowledge to the surface consciousness would account for\nthe scarcity of the phenomena.\" ^ Again, \" We can say\nthat these phenomena might readily be deduced, nay,\nj)redicted, from the superindividual mind and the absolute\nsubject. For if the superindividual mind projects more\nor less deeply into every individual, it is not only com-\nprehensible but to be expected that mental connection\nshould exist between two individuals. . .\n.\" ^ This is very\nlike the Plotinian theory, though I do not suppose that\nDr. Tischner is indebted to Neoplatonism. It must, how-\never, be observed that Plotinus, who is always clear and\nconsistent in his mental imagery, would never have allowed\nhimself to suggest that if you go dow7i to deep levels of\nthe subconscious mind, you will come to a swpenndividual\nmind, which projects more or less deeply into each indi-\nvidual.\nI have necessarily had to leave out much that is of\ninterest from the point of view of normal psychology, and\nonly observe in passing that Plotinus has a theory of\nemotion which closely resembles that of William James\nin the importance it assigns to the organic sensations\naccompanying the emotion.^ He does not deal with the\nproblem of dreams, a rather surprising omission. As the\nsubconscious for Plotinus was not only the seat of desire,\nbut also the channel of telepathic impulses, he would have\nhad no difficulty in explaining dream material in a manner\nconsonant with that of modern research.\nI cannot in this paper describe at length what Plotinus\nhas to tell us about the superconscious, or divine, part of\nthe soul. It must suffice to observe that this part of the\n1 Op. cit. p. 219. 2 Op p 221. a jy. 4. 28.\n\f101] The PsychoI(u\/!\/ of PJotinns 401\nsoul is never actually \" embodied,\" and even during our\nlife here maintains its calm existence in the world of\nimmaterial existences \" yonder.\" It has its own powers\nof vision, but different from those of bodily eyes, for the\nthings it sees are not of this world.\n^\nTheory of Survival.\nPlotinus treats the problem mainly from the theoretical\nstandpoint, and writes at length to refute the arguments\nin favour of a material soul which is dispersed at death.\nThere is no need to recapitulate his arguments here, many\nof which are couched in terms very difficult to translate\nbecause they echo the clamour of long forgotten con-\ntroversies. I will give only one example. In Plotinus'\nday many, especially in the medical profession, held that\nthe soul was a kind of wind (\" pneuma \") or gas (to use a\nmore modern term), i.e. a material substance, which circu-\nlated through the arteries. The \" pneuma \" in a living\nbody was said to be \"in a certain state,\" which gave rise\nto the phenomena of life.^ Plotinus makes short work of\nthis theory. In doing so, he claims as common ground\nwith his opponents that there are, of course, many in-\nanimate gases, ^ and asks what difference there is between\nthese and gases which are souls\u2014a very difficult question\nfor the upholders of the \" pneuma \" theory to answer.\nI have referred to this passage in order to put the reader\non his guard against attributing to the word \" pneuma \"\nin The Enneads any other than a material signification.\nIt must not be given its more familiar New Testament\nmeaning of \" spirit \" as opposed to matter.\nPlotinus' theory of survival is so comprehensive that\neach reader who comes to The Enneads with any theory\nof survival at all is likely to find his own ideas on the\nsubject reflected in this or that passage, and he must\nresist the temptation to fasten on these, to the exclusion\n1\ni. 6. 8, and iv. 3. 24. 2 j^, 7, 4,\n3 TrvivfxaTo. afuxa.

Lamhert, [PAET\nof others which would modify his own partial view. For\ninstance, Dr. Inge says :\n\"It is plain from this passage and from all that\nPlotinus says about the eternal world, that his conception\nof eternity is widely different from the hope of continued\nexistence in time to which many persons, though by no\nmeans so many as is often supposed, cling with passionate\ndesire. Ghost stories have no attraction for the Platonist.\nHe does not believe them and would be very sorry to have\nto believe them. The kind of immortality which '\npsychical\nresearch ' endeavours to establish would be for him a\nnegation of the only immortality which he desires and\nbelieves in. The difference between the two hopes is\nfundamental.\" ^\nThat the author is here voicing his own views rather\nthan those of Plotinus will, I think, appear to the reader\nfrom the following summary. Plotinus' theory of sur-\nvival is in strict conformity with his theory of the\nstructure of human personality, as described above. At\nthe moment of death the soul-body system which consti-\ntutes the living person is temporarily dislocated. The\nlowest soul element, which is in immediate contact with\nthe body, is parted from the higher portion, embracing\nthe conscious and spiritual selves. That the lowest part\nof the soul does not leave the body at once is proved\nby the fact that hair and nails grow on a body after\ndeath, and by the fact that when animals are cut to\npieces, the scattered parts make movements for some time\nafter. But in a short time the three psychic elements\nreassemble, and are hurried to their doom. Their fate is\ndetermined by the level at which the man has lived\nduring his earth life, and the souls of the dead find their\n\"level\" by a process as regular as that of gravitation.^\nThe higher the soul rises, the more tenuous its body\nbecomes, until, in the best event, it leaves the sphere of\nmatter altogether for the \" Beyond.\" So long as the\nsoul remains in the material universe, it is linked with a\nbody, whether of flesh, or of some more rarefied matter,\ngaseous or etheric. The sage's task is to rid his soul of\n^Ph.PL, vol. ii. p. 96. = iv. 4. 29. .\n= iv. 3. 24.\n\f101] The Psychology of Plotinns 403\nall matter, in order that after death, if not before, it may\nrise to that which is both its source and its goal.^\nWhen the soul leaves its body o\u00a3 flesh and blood, its\npower of memory increases in proportion to its freedom\nfrom matter, 2 for, as I have pointed out above, memory\nis a psychical activity which is impeded by the body.\nAt the same time, another law comes into operation,\nnamely, that a man only exercises his power of memory\nin regard to things which interest him. Indeed, he tends\nto become that which he calls to mind.^ The departed\nsoul finds itself in a new environment, which occupies\nmost of its attention, and as the soul rises, its absorption\nin its environment becomes more and more complete, as\nthe obstacles to action diminish. Consequently, although\nthe power of memory increases as the soul rises, the calls\nupon it grow fewer until the soul leaves the celestial\nsphere for the Beyond.* In that sense the soul grows\nmore forgetful as it progresses,^ and eventually reaches a\nstate in which the circumstances demanding the use of\nmemory are altogether transcended. Similarly, on the\ndownward journey, the soul does not begin to exercise\nmemory until it leaves the Beyond for the celestial region.\nSouls which call to mind the memories of earth life tend\nto return here ^\n\u2014a doctrine, it may be noted in passing,\nwhich is implied in certain statements purporting to have\ncome from F. W. H. Myers since his death (see, e.g., those\ncited by Sir Ohver Lodge on pp. 301 and 302 of The\nSurvival of Man).\nAt the same time it is necessary to correct a false\nimpression that might arise from the imagery of the soul\nrising and descending. It would be more in accordance\nwith Plotinus' ideas to imagine the soul as a kind of\npsychical continuum reaching from \" above the heaven\n\"\ndown to earth, ^ which cannot lose anything which it has\nacquired in experience, but is only active in that par-\nticular sector upon which the focus of personality is centred\nat any given time. The focus moves up or down accord-\ning to the direction given to it by the character of the\n1 i. 8. 13. 2 3 27. = iv. 4. 3. * iv. 4. 5.\n5 iv. 3. 32. \" iv. 4. 3.

Lambert [part\nindividual, and the psychological characteristics of person-\nality after death depend iipon the level at which the\npersonality in question is active. Many of the departed\nremain at relatively low levels, where their desires,\nmemories and activities are those of earth life.^ Yet even\nthis language is inadequate, because the soul, being an\nentity which transcends matter, can be wholly present in\nany \" part \" of itself.^ The \" part \" of a soul which is\nin immediate contact with the matter which it organises\ninto a body (whether of flesh and blood or of some more\ntenuous matter), forms with that body a kind of com-\npound entity which Plotinus calls by several names.^ In\nthe case of those departed souls which have not escaped\nfrom the physical universe altogether this psycho-physical\ncompound is, objectively regarded, the \" eidolon \" or\nliving ghost. Plotinus does not cite any cases of ghostly\napparitions coming within his own experience, but adduces\nthe traditional instance of the Shade of Herakles, which\nwas to be distinguished from the Herakles in heaven.*\nThat he believed in the possibility of communications from\nthe dead is clear from the following passage with which he\nconcludes the Seventh Book of the Fourth Ennead :\n\" Thus far we have offered considerations appropriate to\nthose asking for deductive proof ; those whose need is\nconviction depending on observation are best met from\nthe abundant records relevant to the subject : . . .\nThere are (he proceeds) not a few souls, once among men,\nwho have continued to serve them after quitting the body,\nand by revelations, practically helpful, make clear as well\nthat other souls, too, have not ceased to be.\" \u00b0\nThese are not the words of a man who rejects the\nevidence of what we should call psychical research, and\nthey seem to have escaped the notice of Dr. Inge when\nhe wrote the passage quoted above.\nThus in Plotinus' system there is room not only for the\nimmortality of timeless existence in a wholly transcen-\ndental world to which Dr. Inge looks forward, but also\n1 iv. 4. 24-27. 2 iv. 1. 1.\nTO KOLvbv, TO (TiwdeToi', TO avvo.ixfpoTepov, see esp. i. 1.\n^ i. 1. 12, iv. 3. 27 and 32. ^iv. 7.15.\n\f101] The Psychology of Plotinus 405\nfor survival in conditions not very far removed from those\nof earth life, of which many students of psychical research\nare satisfied that they have obtained experimental proof\nby communications from \" souls once among men.\"\nThe student who adopts Plotinus' far-reaching theory of\nthe nature of man's psychical constitution, with its\nimmense range and organic structure, will find that it\nthrows new light on many current problems. He will,\nhowever, find himself more than ever impressed with the\ndifficulty of estabhshing the identity of \" communicators.\"\nThe question whether a given \" communicator \" is identical\nwith some particular deceased individual raises the whole\nquestion of the structure of the two personalities one is\nattempting to identify. Both Plotinus and Frederic Myers\nf were profoundly right in making a theory of human\npersonality the groundwork of their theories of survival,\nand many of the difficulties experienced in co-ordinating\nthe data of research are no doubt due to imperfect and\none-sided theories of personality. Plotinus' theory at any\nrate gives us a scale by which to classify the various kinds\nof identity tests which are applied to trance personalities.\nLooking at the matter from the Plotinian standpoint, the\ntests fall into four categories.\n(1) In the lowest class come those tests which measure\nand compare psychophysical reactions not under conscious\ncontrol, such as pulse rates and psychogalvanic reflexes.\nIf individual reflexes are highly characteristic, it would be\ninteresting to have them recorded, in order that they\nmight be compared with those of any controls who, after\nthe death of the person under observation, claimed identity\nwith him. It may be that reactions normal in one body\nare not easily reproducible in another, but jucl'^ing from\nthe curious physiological manifestations displayed by some\ncontrols, the results might be distinctly interesting.\n(2) Next in order would come characteristic mannerisms\nof speech and so forth, which impress some sitters very\nstrongly. But Plotinus would never have accepted these\nas proof of the survival of more than the body-\nsubconscious soul \" compound,\" ^ in which habits of all\n1 i. 1. 10.\n\f406 G. W. Lambert [part\nkinds are registered. They would not necessarily prove\nthe continued activity of the \" higher soul.\"\n(3) In the third class come tests based on comparisons\nof memories. I have akeady pointed out that, according\nto Plotinus, the more intellectual type of mind loses\ndetailed earth memories after death, and he would not\nhave been at all surprised at the serious failures of memory\ndisplayed by certain of the controls claiming identity with\nimportant members of this Society who have died and\nsince purported to communicate. This possibility, coupled\nwith our ignorance of the range of clairvoyance and tele-\npathy, makes memory tests a very inconclusive kind of\nevidence, whether they are apparently successful or the\nreverse.\n(4) In the highest class we must place those tests which\nrely on showing, on the part of controls or communicators,\ncontinued intellectual powers of a high order, which are\nalso \" characteristic,\" such as those originating correlated\nscripts of a complicated and ingenious type, like the \" Ear\nof Dionysius \" case.^\nLooked at from the Plotinian standpoint, each of these\ntests taps the problem, as it were, at a different psycho-\nlogical level. None of the types of test is open to a\nquite unambiguous interpretation, but if a control, pur-\nporting to be a deceased individual, successfully passed\ntests in each of the four categories mentioned above, the\ncumulative evidence of survival would be very strong.\nUnfortunately there is a tendency on the part of experi-\nmenters to specialise on one type of test ; this circum-\nstance, in its turn, tends to limit the psychical \" educa-\ntion \" of mediums, and the result is a mass of data more\ndifficult to coordinate than would have been the case if\nthey had been collected over a wider psychological range.\nContemplation and Ecstasy.\nNo essay on the psychology of Plotinus would be\ncomplete without some account, however brief, of his\ntheory of contemplation. His teaching on this subject\n1 iv. 3. 27. - Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxix, p. 1*97 ff.\n\f101] The Psychology of Plotinus 407\nalone has earned for him an imperishable name as one\nof the great mystics of all ages, and he has influenced the\nthought of men so far removed from one another in\ntemperament and in time as St. Augustine and Lord\nTennyson.\nMany pages could be written on the meaning of the\nword \" contemplation \" in Plotinus. He uses it in a\nsense to which we are not accustomed, different from that\nwhich it has acquired as the result of centuries of subse-\nquent religious development. Contemplation, far from\nbeing the antithesis of action, is the fundamental activity\nof all life.^ The Soul of the World contemplates the\nthings that are \" yonder,\" or, as we might say, in the\nspiritual world, and this act of contemplation results in\nthe creation of a faint copy, which we see as Nature.\nIn a sense the visible universe is a sort of by-product of\ncontemplation by the World Soul, but inasmuch as the\nworld of sense is in a less pure substance than the world\n\" yonder,\" it is a shadow rather than a rephca. I must\nnot trace this theory to its source in Platonism, nor stop\nto translate certain splendid passages in which Plotinus\ndescribes the attitude of silent sympathy which man must\nadopt if he would understand the secret and silent pro-\ncesses of nature.^ It must, however, be observed that the\ntheory is bound up, in the case of Plotinus, with certain\npsychical experiences of his own. He was convinced that\non more than one occasion he had penetrated in moments\nof ecstasy into that world \" yonder,\" which lies behind the\nveil of this world.^ It is also bound up, if I am not\nmistaken, with a curiously primitive and erroneous theory\nof normal vision. I need hardly say that the problem\nof vision was one which always puzzled the ancients, and\nabout which they had ideas very far wide of the truth.\nA sceptic might therefore be inclined to discard at once\nall that Plotinus has to say about contemplation, on the\nground that, on the psychological side, the theory is rooted\nin the self-delusion of ecstasy, and, on the physical side,\nin a false optical theory. But here again Plotinus seems\nto me to throw out a valuable suggestion, which shines\n1 Vide iii. 8. \u2022passim. - iii. 8. 4. ^ g_ i .\ny p 23.\n\f408 G. W. Lambert [PAET\nout all the more brightly because of the dark background\nof scientific ignorance from which it proceeds. There does\nseem to be some form of psychical activity which results\nin a contemplated image becoming actually reproduced.\nI refer to the obscure phenomenon of stigmatisation. In\nthe case of stigmatics we see at work some curious psycho-\nphysical process by which a visually received image\nbecomes reproduced, in a sense, in the body of the\nstigmatic. In what circumstances an image can penetrate\nso deeply into the subconscious as to affect the plastic\nfunctions in this way we cannot at present understand.\nMay not a similar process assist in the acquisition of\nprotective colouring by animals, especially in those remark-\nable cases where the animal adapts its colour to the back-\nground against which it is seen ?\nIt has also been suggested, I think, that the formation\nof teleplastic structures is an extreme example of the same\nprocess. The generation of these seems to involve a\nprofound disturbance of the plastic functions of the psyche,\nand these, according to Plotinus, are closely associated\nwith the sexual nature in the subconsciousness. May not\nthis circumstance afford an explanation of the conjunction\nfrequently observed between the phenomena of physical\nmediumship and sexual disturbance ? ^ This conjunction of\nsymptoms, if we may so term them, is a source of anxiety\nto many people ; it has also been noticed, of course, in\nthe annals of mystical religious experience. The truth\nseems to be that we have not yet gained selective control\nover the mechanisms at work, and the phenomena we wish\nto study are liable to be confused by disturbances we must\nhope one day to eliminate. Rather than attribute the\npathological symptoms to the Devil or to malicious spirits,\nI would attribute them to an inevitable clumsiness of\nmanipulation in what is at present an obscure field of\nexperiment.\nFor the purpose of the foregoing summary of the psycho-\nlogical views of Plotinus it has been necessary to draw\non chapters in The Enneads which are for the most part\ndry and technical. I have had no opportunity of quoting\niCf., e.g., E. Morselli, Psicologia e \" Spiritismo\" (Torino, 1908), II. 14.\n\f101] The Psychology of Plotinus 409\nfrom any of those soaring passages which have earned for\nPlotinus an immortal name in literature. There is,\nhowever, one such passage ^ which has become famous in\nthe annals of this Society, and for that reason some\nreference to it here will not be out of place.\nMany readers will remember that Mr. J. G. Piddington,\nin his paper entitled \" A Series of Concordant Automa-\ntisms,\" elucidates a remarkable series of cross -corre-\nspondences originating from a test question put by Mrs.\nVerrall to \" Myersp \" in the form of three Greek words\nfrom the Fifth Ennead which were known to have\ndefinite associations in the mind of Frederic Myers. ^ This\nis laiown as \" the ai'ro? ovpavo'; aKu\/uwu incident.\" The\npassage from which these words are taken comes near the\nbeginning of the Fifth Ennead. It is translated by Myers\non p. 291 of Vol. II. of Human Personality, and is closely\ncoupled by him with another passage from the end of\nthe Third Book of the same Ennead. His translation is\nas follows :\n\" So let the soul that is not imworthy of that vision\ncontemplate the Great Soul ; freed from deceit and every\nwitchery, and collected into calm. Calm be the body for\nher in that hour, and the tumult of the flesh ;\nay, all\nthat is about her calm ; calm be the earth, the sea, the\nair, and let heaven itself be still. Then let her feel how\ninto that silent heaven the Great Soul floweth in. . . .\nAnd so may man's soul be sure of Vision, when suddenly\nshe is filled with light ; for this light is from Him and\nis He ; and then surely shall one know his presence when,\nlike a god of old time. He entereth into the house of\none that calleth Him, and maketh it full of light.\"\nThe first passage, down to \" the Great Soul floweth in,\"\ncontains the three Greek words auro? ovpai'6^ aKv\/mm',\nwhich literally mean \" the very heaven waveless.\" For\nthe purpose of the experiment it was sufficient to show\nthat the script intelligence understood the passage in the\nsame sense in which Myers understood it during his life-\ntime, and this seems to have been the case. But it must\niv. 1. 2. 2P\/'oc. S.P.R., vol. xxii. p. 107.\n2 D\n\f410 G. W. Lambert [part\nbe observed that Myers, misled by the editors of the text,\nfailed to grasp the real significance of the passage, the\nmeaning of which has only recently been elucidated.\nProfessor Dodds has pointed out that Plotinus is not here\nconveying an injunction to meditate on the World Soul\n\" only when atmospheric conditions are favourable.\" ^ On\nthe contrary, he is asking the reader to still his own soul,\nin order that it may be able to picture to itself the\nUniverse of the four elements in a state of motionless\nquiet before the World Soul entered into it. \" There\nnever was a time,\" he has told us elsewhere, \" when this\nUniverse was not ensouled,\" ^ so that it is a vision of the\nimagination, and not of an historical event that he is\nasking us to contemplate. Before the entry of Soul we\nmust picture the four elements earth, sea (water), air, and\n\" heaven \" as motionless and dark. That moment is like\nthe moment of darkness before the dawn, before the day-\nlight flooding over the horizon wakes all things from the\nsilence of sleep. Thus in this passage there is a vision\nof dawn, and behind it a still grander visioia of the\ndawning of life on the Universe. With this explanation,\nI will give a rendering of this passage, going beyond the\npoint where Myers left it so as to give the full context.\n\" Another soul that would behold the Great Soul must\nherself be great and not unworthy of that vision, freed\nfrom deceit and every witchery, and composed in silence.\nSilent be the surrounding body and the turmoil of the\nflesh, and all the environment beside ; silent the earth,\nsilent the sea and air, and silent the unmoving ^ heaven\n^Classical Quarterly, April 1922, p. 96. 2 iv. 3. 9.\n^ I have provisionally accepted Professor Dodds' conjecture afxa. ixhwv\nto replace the afxeifup of the MSS. The word 6.kvixwi', whicli Myers\nread, is a conjecture of Kirchoft' which is certainly wrong, and may have\nbeen responsible for the continued failure to understand this passage.\nAn adjective meaning \" not revolving \" is appropriate, as there is\nemphasis on the point that it is the entry of Soul which sets the\nheaven, previously stationary (karQiTa), in motion. But it seems to me\nthat editors may have been too hasty in condemning ijj.eivwv as corrupt.\nIn iv. .3. 1 7, where Plotinus is describing the entry of individual souls\ninto the (physical) heaven, he says d yap ovpafbs ev ti2 ai7drjT(2 tottlo\nap.elvwv, as if the superior nobility or fineness of heaven was a generally\n\f101] The Psychology of Plotinus 411\nitself. Then, behold, into that motionles.s heaven from\nevery side Soul comes flowing and flooding in, and enters\nin and enlightens it ; as the sun's rays light up a dark\ncloud and kindle it to a golden glory, so Soul, entering\ninto the body of heaven, gave it life and immortality, and\nawakened it from rest. And heaven, set in motion ever-\nlasting by the power of Soul wisely guiding it, became\na happy living creature, glorified by ^the Soul that has\ntaken up her abode there ; for before the advent of Soul\nit was a mere corpse of earth and water, or rather a dark\nchaos, a '\nnothing,' '\nan abomination of the gods,' as a\npoet has said.\"\nThe second passage quoted by Myers, beginning \" And\nso may man's soul be sure of vision,\" is taken from a\ndifferent context, nearly three books further on.^ It\ncontains a train of thought very characteristic of Plotinus,\nbut so unfamiliar to-day outside the region of poetry that\na word of explanation may not be out of place. The\nreader will remember that a Plotinian god, if he endows\nhimself with a body, creates one of a fiery texture which\nis self-luminous. Indeed, a strong eflulgence accompanying\nan apparition was a sure indication of a heavenly visitor,\nas distinct from one of lower rank.\"^ The vision of some\ngod flooding with light \" the house of one that calleth\nhim '\n' illustrates the sudden illumination of the purified\nsoul which has cast aside all impediments, and has at\nlast, in a moment of ecstatic union, beheld the beatific\nvision of The One, the Ineffable Source of all things\nwhich is the Goal of all her endeavour.\nThese meditations, and others not less sublime, have\nwon for Plotinus a few earnest disciples in almost every\ncentury, and, if we may adapt his own phrase, have\n\" kindled a golden glory \" on many a later page of litera-\nture. They have earned for him a reputation as one of\naccepted fact, which rendered it antecedently probable that heaven wag\nthe first region in the Universe to receive souls. In each of these\npassages may not Plotinus be deriving his imagery from some earlier\nsource, not known to us, which would lend to the epithet ajxdvwv an\nappropriateness easily recognised by his hearers ?\n\f412 G. W. Lambert [part\nthe great mystics, and many people are thus left with the\nimpression that he was a vague and dreamy thinker. But\nif the surface difficulties are surmounted, it will be found\nthat his thought is fundamentally simple, restrained, and\nthoroughly systematic, after the best Greek model.\nPassages which sound to the modern ear like highly\nimaginative poetry were written by him in the firm belief\nthat they were at the same time the most profound\nscience. So long as men of his faith remain, they will be\nprepared to wrestle with his difficult Greek, in order that\nthey may become initiates in his school of wisdom ; and\neach of them, when the day of his illumination has come,\nmust have exclaimed in words that Plotinus himself once\nused of his own master, \" This is the man I was looking\nfor.\" 1\nBibliographical Note.\nText.

I have re-\nceived certain communications from Mr. Hoagland and Mr.\nCode which, inasmuch as they dispute the accuracy of many\nof the facts on which I had relied and supply an explanation\nof the conduct to which I had taken exception, ought, in my\nopinion, to receive the same publicity as my original criticism.\nThis correspondence, which is too long for complete reproduc-\ntion and has required certain modifications immaterial to the\nquestion here at issue, which the writers have left to my\ndiscretion, I now forward, and trust you will find room for it.\n\f101] \" Report on Sittings with Margery\n\"\n415\nIt will be remembered that, though Mr. Hoagland had said\nnothing of it in his Report, it appeared from other sources\nthat Mr. Code alleged that, after an interview with \" Margery\n\"\nin which he had told her that the committee had discovered\na normal explanation of the phenomena, he had adjourned\nwith her to the seance room and held a daylight seance for\nthe purpose of discussing the situation with \" Walter \" and\nhad arranged with him to assist him at the forthcoming\nofficial seance by releasing \" Margery's \" hand. The holding\nof this seance with \" Walter \" was denied by both \" Margery\n\"\nand Dr. Crandon. Mr. Code now sends me the actual notes\nhe made of it, with an introduction explaining the events\nwhich led up to it. In face of this, I, ])ersonalIy, without\nexpressing any view on the major issue of whether there are\nstill grounds for a belief in the \" Margery \" mediumship,\nfind it impossible any longer to doubt the good faith of Mi-.\nCode, though, while crediting him with the best intentions, I still\nquestion the wisdom of a course which led to such a dubious\nposition.\nI have to thank both Messrs. Hoagland and Code for the\ngood temper with which they have received my strictures.\nAt the end of my Reviert' I questioned whether, in the light\nof later reported instances of \" Margerj'^s \" mediumship, viz.\nthe continuance of the phenomena while the medium is\nseated in a glass cabinet with her hands bound outside it,\nand her ability to produce the direct voice of \" Walter \"\nnotwithstanding the application of Dr. Richardson's voice\nmachine, the Hoagland Report could be \" accepted as de-\nfinitive.\" As regards this Mr. Code in a later letter sent me\nwhat he considers wholly adequate explanations of both these\ndevelopments, which he claims to have imitated successfully\nunder similar conditions.

HOAGLAND TO MR. FEILDING.\n18 Traill St.,\nCambbidge, Mass., September, 3rd 1926.\nDear Sir,\nIn your review, appearing in the June Proceedings of\nyour Society, of my report on the Margery Case in the Nov.\n1925 Atlantic Monthly, you have, unfortunately, been led far\nastray by radical misstatements of fact made by the Bird-\nCrandon group. I shall list a few of these.\nIn the first place, you have been led to believe that the\npamphlet \" Margery-Harvard-Veritas,\" contains the complete\nnotes of the Harvard sittings. In a review of the case\nprinted in the July number of the American Journal of Psy-\nchology, Dr. Walter Franklin Prince points out that the notes\nin the pamjihlet contain numerous changes, additions, sub-\ntractions, omissions and deliberate misdirections. In all,\nsome 1,440 words have been omitted from our notes, including\nimportant observations fatal to the Crandon cause. Changes\nof important sentences have been made which completely\nalter their meaning. Dr. Prince found that pen lines had been\ndrawn through some deleted parts of Dr. Crandon's copies\nof the notes, presumably for the printer's benefit.\nYou consider it an advantage to have read what you term\nan \"exceedingly able and fair-minded production,\" by Mr.\nBird. In this connection I should like to state that there is\ndocumentary evidence in the archives of the Boston Society\nfor Psychic Research, which proves that Mr. Bird twisted and\ndistorted facts in his possession, including some jjlainly recorded\nin the official notes of the sittings. The American Society\nfor Psychical Research refused to publish an article by Dr.\nPrince showing these divergences from fact.\nThe entire group from Harvard was imanimous in its verdict\nof trickery, the only possible disagreement being whether to\nany degree the trickery was unconscious. See statement\nsigned by nine members of the group in the New York Times\nand Bostoyi Herald of October 23, 1925. This statement also\ncontained an item to the effect that my Atlantic Monthly\nreport was representative of their judgment regarding the\nphenomena. Mr. Code did not sign the statement because he\n\f]0i] \"Report on Siltings ivith Mmyjerij'^ 417\nwas several hundred miles aAvay and unavailable at the time.\nHe has since declared that he would gladly have signed it\nhad he been given the opportunity.\nThere was no pledge to silence on the part of the Harvard\ngroup. Ultimate publicity was planned and understood by\nall regardless of the, nature of the results. To quote from the\nforementioned review by Dr. Prince in the American Journal\nof Psyclwlogy,\n\" Dr. Crandon protested that this [Hoagland's\nreport in Atlantic Monthly] was a violation of agreement. On\neight grounds appearing in the documents I think this con-\ntention imjustified. There is space but to allude to the\nprincipal of these, viz., that Dr. Crandon formally assented\nin May to Mr. Hoagland's plan to use the results, if suitable,\nfor a Ph.D. thesis ; that no intention finally to suppress them\nwas ever broached ; that Dr. Crandon allowed, against protest,\ndata about the sittings to be printed in four issues of the\nBanner of Life ; that solely for defence of himself and col-\nleagues against premature gossip. Professor Shapley on June\n29th stipulated that names should not be given out without\nspecific authorization and that attempts should be made to\navoid publicity ; that this agreement was not signed by Dr.\nCrandon and was binding only on those who did sign it ;\nthat' nine members of the group did authorize giving out a\nreport after the sittings ended ; that Dr. Crandon wrote a\nletter on July 6th, saying that he agreed (to Code) not to\npubhsh the Harvard sittings except with the consent of the\nmajority of the signers, yet without obtaining such consent he\nfurnished the notes from which a garbled account appeared\nin several issues of the Boston Herald, before the report by\nHoagland came out in Atlantic Monthly.\"\nI should like to add that Professor Shapley who attended\nfour out of the eight sittings was in favour of giving our\nresults to the dail^ press. He heartily approved of the Atlantic\nMonthly as a source of publication, which incidentally had been\nsuggested to me by another of the scientists in the group.\nProfessor Shapley proof-read my report and asked me to add\na footnote stating that he regarded the trance as a hoax.\nIt should be borne in mind that the Margery case had first\n'\nreached the public through the pages of a popular magazine,\nthe Scientific American, and that there had previously been\n\f418 3Ir. Feil<ii)ig\\s Revieic of Mr. Hudson HoaglaiuVs [part\nwidespread newspa^oer i^ublicity regarding it. Our report was\nnot offered to the American Society of Psychical Research for\nreasons which should be apparent. It seemed ahnost certain\nthat such an offer would have been hopeless. Certain members\nof the board of the Boston Society of Psychic Research had\nalready reported adversely, and this\" Society preferred not to\nprint our rej^ort because it might appear that these persons\nwere motivated by animus toward the case. Moreover, news-\npaper controversy would have inevitably followed a report in\npamphlet form, and we should have been forced to make a\nsuperficial digest of the investigation for the daily press which\nwould have been inadequate for our purposes. The Atlantic\nMonthly seemed to be the only organ available to the large\npublic already interested in the affair.\nMr. Code has stated to me in writing that he promised\nnothing to Dr. Crandon on behalf of the group. Of course,\nMr. Bird was informed of things in confidence. Because of\nMr. Code's sincere friendship for Dr. Crandon and his fear of\nthe consequences of the possible shock of exposure he urged\nus to refrain from publicity, which we did for several months.\nDuring this time Dr. Crandon pressed on with the mediumship\nand wrote abusive letters about our group. Since many\nknew of our investigation and since our silence was being used\nagainst us, a report was made calculated to stress the possi-\nbilities of abnormal psychology as a determinant in the case\nand so allow the Crandons to retire as gracefully as possible.\nTheir retort was more misrepresentations and new tricks.\nMr. Bird's witness of Code's duplication occurred one after-\nnoon quite informally when the former dropped in for tea.\nIn the presence of Professor Boring, Professor Shapley and\nmany others, a dark seance was given at another time and\nall of the effects duplicated under precisely the same control\nas had been used at the Margery seances. *\nNotes dictated on\nthis occasion read in every respect like those made with\nMargery. Her whole repertory was performed and photo-\ngraphs were taken of \" teleplasm \" under Lime Street^ con-\nditions, one of our group, Mr. Damon, acting as Dr. Crandon.\nThere is no secret regarding Mr. Code's conduct. His\n1 Dr. Crandon's house, at which the sittings took place, is in Lime Street.\n\flitij \"Report on. Sittings ivith Manjani'' 41\".)\nvoluminous correspondence with various members of the group\nis open to inspection at the Boston Society for Psychic Re-\nsearch, along with other documents, including certain letters\nchanged and deleted as published in \" Margery-Harvard-\nVeritas.\" These letters will show that Mr. Code acted in\naccordance with the best of motives to aid persons whom\nhe then considered worthy of his consideration. Among the\ndocuments is a report of an interview taking place between\nMargery and ]VIr. Code on the afternoon of the last sittmg.\nIt clearly shows \" Walter's \" abject surrender. Cojjies of\nthese notes have been sent with this manuscript to the Society\nfor Psychical Research. Notes of this conversation were made\nby Mr. Code within 24 hours of the interview. No mention\nwas made of this conversation in my Atlantic article because\nMr. Code wished this regarded as confidential at the time to\nspare the Crandons. It was also, in a sense, irrelevant to the\nobjective problem. Reasons for Mrs. Crandon's willingness to\nco-operate with Mr. Code and artifices that she was prepared\nto employ had he failed her at the last minute are also on\nrecord.\nThe glass cabinet and voice machine tricks are compara-\ntively simple. Competent observers have reported several\nways by which each of these tricks may be done. A report\nexposing them, by two members of the American S.P.R.,\nJ. B. Rhine and Louisa E. Rhine, both Phil.D.'s in biology,\nis soon to appear. Another gentleman, a physicist of mter-\nnational reputation, employed by the A.S.P.R. to investigate\nthe Crandons has reported adversely. The Crandons are\nmasters of the psychology of deception. Is it necessary to\ngo on indefinitely proving a medium to be a fraud with every\nlittle trick that she can concoct 'i\nI should like to say in closing that all of the notes and\ncorrespondence of the group from Harvard, including notes on\nthe notes made at the time are available at the Boston\nSociety for Psychic Research for inspection and study by\nmembers of the English Society for Psychical Research. The\nAmerican Society for Psychical Research has shown no interest\nwhatsoever in more complete data offered them by our group.\nI do not wish to trust these things in the post, but on my\nnext visit to England, which I hope will be m the not distant\n\f420 Mr. Fcildi'iig's JReview of Mr. Hudson HoaglanrFs [part\nfuture, I shall bring them with me and' deposit them tem-\nporarily with the English Society.

FEILDING.\nUniversity of Delaware,\nNewark, Delaware,\n^rd September, 1926.\nMy Dear Sir,\nMl'. Hudson Hoagland has recently sent me a copy of\nthe Proceedings for June, which I had not previously seen,\nand has asked my permission to send you the notes on my\nprivate sitting with Margery of June 30th, 1925, for which\nhe has asked me to write an introduction. This I have done.\nI symjDathize with you in your difficulties when you try\nto arrive at a fair estimate of the recent Harvard investiga-\ntion on a basis of Mr. Bird's tendencious and inaccurate\nreview and the equally inaccurate \" Veritas \" pamphlet of\nDr. Crandon and others. I am neither surjDrised nor offended\nto discover the opinion you have formed of myself, and yet\nI can scarcely let that opinion pass unchallenged.\nYou ask three questions concerning my behaviour. (1) Is\nCode telling the truth about the private interview ? I can\nonly assure you that I am and ask you to consider carefully\nthe notes which I am furnishing you through Mi'. Hoagland.\n(2) Was his imitation of the phenomena really as successful\nas claimed, and was it performed in the same conditions of\ncontrol ?\nOn the evening of June 29th, immediately after the sitting,\nI endeavoured to convince Mr. Damon and Mr. Hoagland that\na large part of the phenomena which we had witnessed at\nthe Harvard sittings could be performed by freeing the feet\nin the maimer described. I wore a luminous mark on my\nforehead, luminous wristlets, and luminous anklets. JNIr.\nDamon held one of my hands, Mr. Hoagland the other. That\ngives you the conditions of control. I constantly urged Mr.\n\flul] \"Report on Sittings with Margery\" 421\nDamon and IVIr. Hoagland to watch my feet. At first I wore\ntennis shoes over socks. I found that I could not work\neasily with socks over my toes. I then removed the socks\nand wore the tennis shoes over my bare feet. The shoes were\nloose enough to shj^ out of. Mrs. Crandon had worn satin\nslippers over bare feet. The apparatus was the same that\nhad been used during the sitting. That gives you the con-\nditions. Mr. Damon and Mr. Hoagland could not detect\nvisually my evasion of the luminous ankle control. I ran\nthrough the principal phenomena of the seance rapidly. As a\nresult of using the foot, I produced without intending to do\nso various effects incidental to the phenomena, such as the\nmovement of the handle on the weight lifting machine in a\nparticular direction for a particular distance, effects that\ncorresponded to the effects produced by Walter.\nMy elaborate seance for the Harvard group, to which Mr.\nHoagland and Dr. Boring make reference, was produced under\nprecisely Margery's conditions of control. I can furnish you\ndictaphone notes and photographs if you are interested. As\nfar as the spirit extras are concerned, the photographic effects\nare crude. The extras were intentionally burlesque. But the\neffects could be improved by practice in spirit photography.\nThis seance differed from one of Margery's in that I produced\nat one seance and under one set of conditions phenomena\nwhich I had seen Margery produce at a number of seances\nunder varying conditions.\nThe seance I gave for Mr. and Mrs. Bird was hastily im-\nprovised one afternoon. I beheve I reproduced the bellbox\nphenomena, the telekinesis, and the silhouetting in good\nLime Street style. My teleplasms would not stand tactual\ninspection. I am no svngeon and have no supply of anatomi-\ncal specimens. The white lacy teleplasm I had never seen\nMargery produce and had imitated from a photograph. Mrs.\nBird criticized it severely and indicated how mine differed\nfrom Margery's. I have since produced that effect better.\nLater in the seance, I was making no attempt to deceive Bird,\nbut was simply trying to see how near I could come to\nvarious effects he described which I had never seen. My\nlevitations in red light were bad. My methods of loading\napparatus into the cabinet to evade detection by physical\n\f422 Mr. FeUdinc\/s Review of Mr. Hudson HoaglancVs [part\nexamination I believe opened Bird's eyes. My chief reason\nfor thinking so is that a fairly elaborate series of experiments\nat Lime Street in which he was interested were dropjjed soon\nafter I had told him how I thought the effects could be pro-\nduced and had demonstrated as best I could with the materials\nat hand.\n(3) Your third question : assuming the freedom of a leg\nin the first six sittings prior to that of June 29th, could all\nthe phenomena then manifested have been produced by it 1\nNo. The freeing of the right hand from Dr. Crandon's con-\ntrol and the use of the fake hand were necessary for some\neffects. See the accounts of silhouetting in the notes. The\n\" star-fish \" was the fake hand. It could not have been the\nfoot.\nI pass over your compliments on my lack of common sense.\nMy associates on the faculty of Harvard College (who have\nknown me longer than Bird or the Cranclons) or General\nSummerall and other officers of the First Division, American\nExpeditionary Forces, to the staff of which I was attached\nduring the recent war, might enlighten you on that score.\nBy the way, I am not so excessively young as Mr. Bird might\nlead you to svxppose.\nSince I have never been given an opportunity to state my\nopinions about the mediumship publicly, you naturally form a\nvery inadequate notion of them from the satirical statements\nof persons hostile to myself. My opinions are defined at some\nlength in correspondence on file at the Boston Society for\nPsychic Research, where any responsible person may inform\nhimself.\nI have never contended that the entire mediumship was to\nbe explained by innocent subconscious fraud. Dr. Crandon\nhas frequently stated in my presence that he considers it\njustifiable to help out when normal means fail. I have,\nhowever, stressed the possibilities of subconscious automatism,\namnesia, and posthypnotic suggestion, as well as the mystifica-\ntion produced when several tricksters sit in the same circle\nand all contribute to the effects. Although I am convinced\nof the disingenuousness of both the Crandons and Bird, I have\nto note that they all appear to preserve some faith in the\ngenuinfiness of the mediumshij^. To a person who has been\n\f101] \"Report on Sittings ivith Margery'' 423\nassociated with them for some time, this apjjearance of behef\nis very impressive and Avants explanation. My notes on the\nprivate sitting will clarify your further speculations on that\nscore.\nIf there are any questions which you or any member of\nthe Enghsh Society for Psychical Research would like to ask\nme, I shall do my best to answer them. I shall be glad to\nfurnish copies of any documents in my possession for your\ninspection, with the understanding that I do not feel at liberty\nto contribute to a public discussion of the Crandons as private\njDersons.\nYours resj^ectf Lilly,\nGrant H. Code.\nP.S.\u2014I observe that you accuse me of falsifying the records of\nJune 30th, on the basis of dictated statements that you find it\ndifficult to reconcile. Throughout the seance my hand lay palm\nup on Mrs. Crandon's right knee or leg (the position shifted).\nMy fingers clasped her right hand, wrist, or forearm. She\nvaried the position of the wristlet by forcing her arm down\nthrough it or dra\\^'ing it back to position against my fingers.\nI actually had perfect tactual control throughout the sitting\nand so reported. I did not report the movement of the\nwristlet nor the manipulation of the arm and hand till after\nthe sitting. In dealing with IVIi's. Crandon I acted on the\nassumption that her trance was genuine and that Walter was\nresponsible with me for the trickery. Before reporting to my\ncolleagues, I described the seance to Mrs. Crandon as if she\nhad been miconscious of the events of it as she pretended to\nbe. She agreed with me that it was necessary to report\neverjrthing to my colleagues.\n{(I) MR. CODE'S PRIVATE SITTING WITH ''MARGERY.\"\nIntkodxjctory Note.\nThe following notes on a private sitting with Margery,\"\nthe Boston medium (Mrs. Le Roi G. Crandon), are part of a\nmass of information which I have been unwilling to publish.\nIn giving this document publicity I am, therefore, obliged to\n\f424 Mr. Feilding's Review of Mr. Hudson Hoagland's [part\nexplain, in the first place, why I was unwilling to publish\nany part of my information in this case, and, in the second\nplace, why I now publish a document which I was formerly\nunwilling to publish.\nI was first introduced to the Margery mediumship on October\n25th, 1924, not as an investigator, but as a friend of a friend\nof the Crandons. From that time until I left Boston in the\nautumn of 1925 to begin work at the University of Delaware,\nDr. Crandon received me as a friend, treated me with his\nwell-known hospitality and gave me frequent opportunities to\nobserve the phenomena of the Margery mediumship. When\nMr. Hoagland began the series of private sittings which eventu-\nally led to the formal investigation in the psychological labora-\ntory of Harvard University, it was \" Walter,\" the control, who\nmarked my absence and insisted on inviting me to be present\nat the next sitting. Thus, it was directly due to my friend-\nship with the Crandons that I became a member of Mr.\nHoagland's committee.\nMy friendship for the Crandons affected my position as an\ninvestigator in several ways. It gave me an especial interest\nin the human problem involved in the mediumship, quite apart\nfrom the physical phenomena of it. It made me consider the\neffects of my discoveries as an investigator upon the Crandons\nas persons to whom I was attached by bonds of friendship.\nWhen I was finally convinced by personal observation, supported\nby the testimony of others, that the physical phenomena of\nthe mediumship were produced by trickery, I could not\nbring myself to believe that a description of these tricks was\nan adequate explanation of the entire mediumship. In fact,\nit seemed to me that an account of these tricks published\nwithout a study of the subjective phenomena and of the\nhuman relations behind them would give, not a true, but a\nfalse idea both of the mediumship and of the persons involved\nin it. Yet, as a member of an investigation committee, I had\nbeen limited to a study of the jihysical phenomena. Upon\nthese phenomena only could I make a public report. The\nevidence which I could give that bore on the subjective pheno-\nmena and on the human side of the mediumship I felt that\nI had obtained in confidence and could not publish. Therefore\nr gave my complete view of the case to the Crandons and to\n\f101] ' \" Report on Sittings with Margery \" 425\nmy fellow investigators and opposed as far as I was able\npublicity of any kind.\nIt so happened that my observations of the trickery in-\nvolved in the physical phenomena were important to Mr.\nHoagland's case against the mediumship. The Crandons and\ntheir pubKcist, Mr. Bird, decided that the easiest way to dispose\nof the results of the Harvard investigation was to destroy my\ncredit as a witness. Indeed, Mr. Bird was so frank as to\nwrite me that he could not make good his case without making\nhis review of Mr. Hoagland's article in the Atlantic Monthly\nsomething in the nature of a personal attack on me ! In a\nseries of letters, Mr. Bird warned me of the attack that would\nbe made on me, outlined the attack, and advised me that the\nless I had to say the better I Mrs. Crandon wrote me that if\nI thought the phenomena were all tricks she wished I would\nnot write anything about them. I disregarded these warnings\nin a public letter to the New York Tribune in which I sup-\nported the Harvard group.\nIn the daily papers, in an article by Mr. Bird published in\nthe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research,\nin a pamphlet published by Dr. Crandon and some of his\nfriends in public addresses, and in private letters and conversa-\ntion, Mr. Bird's threats have been made good in every particular.\nThe most fantastic falsehoods have been circulated against me.\nThe notes on the private sitting contain my promise to Mrs.\nCrandon and to \" Walter \" not to inform Dr. Crandon of that\nsitting. With Mrs. Crandon's knowledge, I informed the other\ninvestigators (excepting Mr. Bird, who was not a member of\nour committee) in confidence. On our side, that confidence\nwas preserved. Neither the official notes, ]\\'Ir. Hoagland's\narticle, nor any statement by any member of our committee\ncontains any reference to it prior to ]\\Ir. Bird's own account,\nin connection with which, on the authority of Mrs. Crandon, he\nattacked my entire good faith in the investigation. In spite of\nmy silence concerning this sitting, the Crandons have referred\nto it repeatedly.\nIn the Boston Herald and the New York Times, of October\n23rd, 1925, appeared a letter signed by Dr. Crandon and\ncontaining the following statement :\n\" An alleged private sitting\nof Mr. Code with Margery never occurred.\"\n2e\n\f426 Mr. Feilding's Reviexv of Mr. Hudson Hoagland's [part\nIn an interview published in the same places on October\n24th, 1925, Mrs. Crandon is quoted as saying :\n\" Mr. Code, I\nunderstand, says he had a private sitting at which I confessed.\nThis is not true.\"\nBoth of these references are prior to the publication of Mr.\nHoagland's article, which the Crandons evidently feared would\ncontain an account of the private sitting in violation of my\nword given to Mrs. Crandon.\nOn page 720 of Volume XIX. of the Journal of the American\nSociety, Mr. Bird discusses the private sitting and alleges that\nDr. Crandon first heard of it through the public prints. The\nfirst public reference to the sitting that I have been able to\ndiscover is contained in Dr. Crandon's own letter.\nIn a footnote on page 25 of the Crandon pamphlet, ironically\nentitled \"Veritas,\" the fact of the private sitting is denied\non the authority of two anon3Tnous affidavits.\nAssuming, in view of Dr. Crandon's public letter of October\n23rd, that by some means he had received inaccurate informa-\ntion concerning the private sitting, on October 24th, I sent\nJVIrs. Crandon a copy of my notes on the sitting and asked\nher to give them to Dr. Crandon. In response to subsequent\ninquiry, I had a letter from Dr. Crandon dated November 10th,\n1925, and an undated letter from Mi-s. Crandon postmarked\nNovember 20th, 1925, stating that they had not received my\nletter and notes. On November 18th, 1925, I sent each a\ncopy of the notes by registered post. Mrs. Crandon wrote\nthat she couldn't remember the sitting and that Dr. Crandon\ndid not believe my account of it. She added that her letter\nwas \" purely intellectual, not personal,\" and that she would\nbe glad to do anything that she could for me. I took that\nto mean that telling the truth was not a thing she could do\nfor me.\n'What Dr. Crandon's state of belief concerning this sitting\nmay be, I can only surmise. It is quite possible that he is\nhonest in supposing me to be a har. Certainly, Mrs. Crandon's\ndenial of the facts leaves me free, if it does not actually\noblige me, to affirm them.\nGrant Hyde Code.\n\f101] \" Report on Sittings witli Margery \"\n427\nRecord of a Private Sitting at 10 Li.me Street,\nJune 30th, 1925.\nConvinced that the physical phenomena were in a fair way\nto explanation, I directed my attention to the human problem.\nThe Harvard sittings had pretty well eliminated Dr. Crandon\nas an accomplice, except that his hand control was suspect\nand that, once the ease with which the luminous bands could\nbe removed was shown, there was no certainty that he had\nnot been able to remove his left Avrist band or his ankle band\nand thus assist in the manipulation. Fortunately, Hoagland's\nasking Walter to have Dr. Ci'andon permanently removed from\na position of control, and Walter's appointment of me to take\nDr. Crandon\"s place, had put me in a position to observe the\nbearing of Dr. Crandon's control on the phenomena. At the\nsame time, I was fairly sure that all the phenomena at the\nHarvard sittings could be explained by operation by the Psychic.\nConsidering the effect of a blank sitting, I inferred that it\nwould confirm the opinion of the observers that the phenomena\n\\\\'ere produced by physical manipulation on the Psychic's part,\nthat this opinion would be revealed to the Ci'andons, and that\nthe sittings on which the Crandons had been led to Ijase so\nmuch hope would be brought to an abrupt end. All my\nobservations of Dr. Crandon had pointed to his belief in the\nphenomena and a profound religious faith ^\\\u2022hich he based on\nthem. I therefore feared that a sudden exjjosure on the part\nof a group of observers in which he had placed so much trust\nwould give him a shock that might be dangerous. I accordingly\ndecided that a blank sitting must be prevented at all costs.\nEarly in the afternoon of June 30th, T called on Mrs.\nCrandon and found her alone. As far as her part in the\njjhenomena was concerned there were two hypotheses : that\nshe was acting voluntarily and consciously with complete kno\\\\'-\nledge and memory of what she was doing, or that her behaviour\nwas largely automatic and the amount of lier volition, con-\nsciousness, and memory was indeterminate. I was prepared\nto test both hypotheses and to bring about a successful seance\nin either case.\nAccordingly, I began by describhig the foot episode of the\nnight before and exjalaining my observations of the manipula-\n\f428 Mr. Feilding's Review of Mr. Hudson Hoagland's [part\ntion of the aiilile bands and apparatus as well as my subse-\nquent duplications in some detail. I told her that I had i\nnot come to her to get any sort of statement, and did not I\n^vant her to tell me anything, but simply wanted to protect ,\nher and Dr. Crandon from the possible serious effects of an i]\nexposure. Her reaction toward the description of the\noperation of the feet was incredulity and bewilderment.\nI further impressed her with the possible serious consequences\nof a blank and told her that I would be willing to \" manifest\n\"\nmyself in order to prevent a blank. Her reaction was some-\nthing like this :\n\" You frighten me, Code. I see how serious\nthe situation is, I'll do anything you say. But I don't know\nwhat to do. I'll do something for you I've never done for\nanyone else. I'll give you my word of honour that I never\nhave done any of these things.\" My impression was that she\nv\/as really frightened at the possible consequence of a blank,\nsincere in saying that she kncAv nothing about trickery, sincere\nin her bewilderment at the evidence I gave her that the\nmaterial manifestations were really produced by her right foot.\nI then*] suggested automatic action of which she would be\nunconscious. Her reaction was that she dislUted the idea of\nautomatism, because it seemed to her to mean that there was\nsomething the matter^ with her. As I continued my explanation\nof the possibilities of automatism imder hypnotic influence, her\nreaction was fear as she saw the possibilities. I explained that\nthe means of producing trance, the means of beginning the\nsittings in general, were in line with hypnotic methods ;\npower-\nful suggestions that certain effects were to be produced, placing\nthe subject in a situation that inhibited voluntary movement,\nthe use of monotonous sound to dull the attention, repeated\nlow music and the conversation of Dr. Crandon, continued\nsuggestion. Her reaction was increasing conviction and fear.\nI was now fairly sure of my ground, and in order to prevent\nany serious effect on her by too sudden realisization of the\ncomplete situation, I distracted her attention Avith further\nconsideration of what Avas to be done about the seance\nscheduled for that night. She was willing to do whatever I said.\nI represented that it would be dangerous to do anything\nwithout consulting Walter, because if the Psychic and I tried\nto trick, Walter would come through, expose us, and produce\n\f101] \" Report on Sittings with Margery \" 429\na worse effect than a blank. I accordingly asked whether we\ncoukl not call up Walter. She said that Walter's coming\nthrough in the day time was almost unheard of, and that she\nwas sure he wouldn't. I enlarged upon Walter's character,\nsaid I had observed that he never failed in an emergency,\nand that I was sure he would be listening in on our conversa-\ntion and would come through. Mi's. Crandon hnally consented\nto sit.\nWe then went to the seance room, which 1 darkened as\nmuch as possible, the bk.ck curtains in daylight producing not\ndarkness, but a dim light sufficiently clear for perfect observa-\ntion. I took Dr. CIrandon's usual place on the stool at Mrs.\nCrandon's right, and, holding both of the Psychic's hands,\nbegan a low conversation, telling stories about the sitters, etc.\nPresently trance came on, with the Psychic's head turned as\nfar away from me as possible. Convulsive movements freed\nher left hand, which I permitted to escape. It then took a\nposition as if held by a sitter on the other side, the tips of\nthe fingers lightly clipping the edge of the cabinet. Then\nWalter's voice came through the lips of the Psychic. It was\nthrown against the wall of the cabinet and reflected so that\nthe exact position of the sound was very deceptive to the ear.\nI reproduce the conversation as exactly as possible.\nWalteb. Hello, Code.\nCode. Hello, Walter. Good boy ! Great ! I knew\nyou would come through in an emergency.\nWalteb. What's the matter. Code ?\nCode. You see, Walter, we are all pretty much dis-\n. turbed about the Psyche's right ankleband\nbeing off at that last sitting.\nWalter. Of course it was off.\nCode. Good for you, Walter.\nWalter.

Authorised\nTranslation under the supervision of Joan Riviere. The\nHogarth Press and The Institute of Psycho-Analysis.\n4 Vols. 1924-1925.\nPerhaps no Avriter of the present day has so often had reason\nto cry \" Save me from mj friends \" as Professor Freud.\nDuring the past few years many books, purporting to expound\nthe doctrines of psycho-analysis, have been published in this\ncountry and in America, and have been read by those who\nhave not had the opportunity or the desire to read Freud's\nown works. One of the consequences of this has been that\nthere is wide misunderstanding of what Freud actually teaches ;\nfor many of the writers of these expository books were them-\nselves imperfectly acquainted with the subject they set out to\nexj)ound. Now, however, there is no excuse for any serious\nstudent being ignorant of what Freud's doctrines really are,\nfor an admirable series of translations of his works is being\nbrought out in this country, under the general editorship of\nDr. Ernest Jones. Not the least important of these are the\nfour volumes of Collected Papers which form the subject of\nthis notice. Under the super\\'ision of Mxs. Riviere the trans-\nlators of the first, second and fourth volumes have maintained\na remarkably high level of excellence ; and this is also true\nof the third volume which consists of five case-histories trans-\nlated by Ml\", and Rlrs. James Strachey.\nSome people seem to imagine that the doctrme of psycho-\nanalysis sprang fully-formed from the brain of Professor Freud.\nThe truth is, however, that the develoiiment of psycho-analytic\ntheory and practice has been a very gradual process. In the\ncourse of that development many changes have occurred, and\nthe student v\/ho has not followed closely the various steps in\n\f434 Review [part\nthe process may have some difficulty in reconcihng the present-\nday teaching of psycho-analj'sts with some of the statements\nin their earlier wiitings. As their clinical experience widened\nfresh problems arose whose solution necessitated the introduc-\ntion of new hypotheses and the abandonment of some of those\nformerly employed.\nFrom the beginning Freud has l)een his own acutest critic,\nand the most important changes that have taken place, both\nin theory and in practice, have been introduced by himself,\nalthough several important suggestions have come from some\nof his more distinguished followers. When in the course of\nhis investigations some new point of view occurred to him,\nor some modification of his former teaching became necessary,\nho usually juade public his discovery or his changed attitude\nthrough the medium of Journals specially devoted to psycho-\nanalysis. Those who were not professional students of the\nsubject were not likely to see these papers, and when the\nviews put forward in them were accepted by some more popu-\nlar writer and were referred to without any explanation of\nhow the changed point of view liad come about, the reader\nsometimes found it difficult to reconcile the new teaching with\nthe old.\nIn these volumes the sequence of the changes introduced\ninto Freudian Psychology in the course of its growth may be\nfollowed with ease, and it may he anticipated that their publica-\ntion will he followed by a more adequate understanding of\nthe doctrines of psycho-analysis by those who desire to know\nwliat bearing these doctrines have on their own life and work\nor wliat part tJiey may play in the movement of thought in\nour time.\nThe first volume contains Freud's early papers, and carries\nus from 1893 to 1905. The second volume includes all papers\npublished between 1906 and 1924, except those on the special\ntopics to which the third and fourth volumes are devoted.\nThe third volume is in some respects the most important, for\nit consists of records of cases studied analj^ically by Freud\nhimself. The fourth volume contains the most difficult of\nFreud's writings, his papers on what he calls Metapsychology,\nand several essays dealing with some applications of psycho-\nanalysis to non-medical tojDics.\n\f101] Review 435\nAmong the papers on Metapsychology is included the article\non the Unconscious which Professor Freud wrote specially for\nour Proceedings in 1912 ; and among those on applied psycho-\nanalysis is one on dreams and telepathy which should be of\ninterest to our readers. Freud exj^laius the paucity of the\nmaterial on which this latter paper is based\u2014two communica-\ntions from correspondents in Germany\u2014by the fact that he\nhas never experienced a telepathic dream himself, and during\ntwenty-seven years of work as an analyst (this paper was\npublished in 1922), he ha.s never been in a position to observe\na truly telepathic dream in any of his patients. In the\ncourse of the paper Freud writes as if he were a believer in\nthe occurrence of telepathy, but at its close he takes care to\nremove this impression ; he says he has no opinion on the\nmatter and knows nothing about it. But for his purpose he\nassumes that telepathy does occur, and he shows how it is\nrelated to the psycho-analytic theory of dreams.\nHe thinks that not everything going on in the mind diuring\nsleep should be called dream, for, \" a dream without condensa-\ntion, distortion, dramatization, above all, without wish-fulfil-\nment, surely hardly deserves the name.\" But he refers to\n\" the incontestable fact that sleep creates favourable conditions\nfor telepathy,\" and he would regard a \" pure telepathic dream,\"\nthat is to say, a telepathic experience in a state of sleep,\"\nas having no more to do with dream than any experience in\nwaking life. A dream is a product of the dreamer's mental\nLife, Avhereas a purely \"\"\ntelepathic dream \" is a \" perception of\nsomething external.\" On the other hand it is possible for a\ntelepathic experience during sleep, such as a message or an\nintimation of events taking place at a distance, to be worked\ninto the structure of a dream properly so called. When this\noccurs the telepathic material is utilized in the dream-making,\nin the same way as any other content of the mind may be,\nand the psycho-analjrtical interpretation of the dream is m\nno way affected thereby.\nT.

Arrangements were,\ntherefore, made for Mr. Wallenias to bring to Groningen\none of the subjects of Professor Alrutz's own experiments\nin order that the results obtained might be demonstrated.\nBefore describing the demonstration given by Mr.\nWallenius, it may be as well to give a brief account of\nthe results claimed by Professor Alrutz, and of the\nmanner in which they conflict with currently accepted\ntheories of hypnosis.\n^ This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society on Decem-\nber 21st, 1926.\n^ An account of this research was published in Swedish as Till nerv-\nsystemets dynamik, etc. Summaries of the work were also published in\nEnglish in The Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Eesearch, Vol.\nXXXII., 1921, and in the Scandinavian Scientific Review, Vol. III., 1924.\n2f\n\f438 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [PART\nThe theory of hypnosis which would be most generally\naccepted at the present day is one which owes something\nto Braid and something to Liebault. It is regarded as\na condition closely resembling, and in many respects\nidentical with, normal sleep \u2014a sleep, however, which has\nbeen artificially produced by another person, and which\nis characterised by a rapport with that other person.\nThe efficacy of difi^erent methods of indvicing the hypnotic\nstate is supposed to be largely determined by the expecta-\ntion of the subject that they will produce the state\u2014an\nexjjectation induced by indications (verbal or otherwise)\nfrom the experimenter. In other words, the production\nof the state is supposed to be largely the result of sugges-\ntion. Similarly the phenomena developed during hypnosis\n(other than those characteristic of all sleep and the rapport\nitself), i.e., automatisms, local anaesthesias and disturbances\nof sensibiUty, etc., are supposed to be products of sug-\ngestion. This is the part of the modern theory of hypnosis\nwhich we owe to Liebault.\nIt is also recognised, however, that certain kinds of\nstimuli (constant or constantly recurring sounds, rhythmical\npasses made before the subject's body, the strained visual\nfixation of bright objects, etc.) may tend to produce the\nhypnotic state independently of the expectation of the\nsubject. In this belief, the modern theory follows Braid.\nIt still, however, cliflers sharply from the original theory\nof Mesmer in believing that, in order to produce their\neffect, stimuli of this order must be perceived by the\nsubject. Mesmer, on the other hand, believed that\ndownward passes produced their hypnotic efl^ect by the\ndirect action of an influence from the nervous system\nof the hypnotiser on the hypnotised subject, and that\nthis efiiect would occur even if the hypnotised subject\nhad no knowledge of what the hypnotiser was doing, and\nthat passes in the opposite direction removed the hypnotic\ncondition in the same way.\nIt was the truth of this hypothesis of the direct action\nfrom the nervous system of the operator in the production\nof hypnotic phenomena that Professor Alrutz claimed to\nhave proved. His method of experimentation was as\n\f102] Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 439\nfollows. The subject of the experiment was put into a\nLight hypnotic trance in which (as is usual) sensory\nhyperaesthesia appeared. This hyperaesthesia was shown\n(as well as in other ways) by the subject feeling as\npainful the contact of an adjustable needle algesimeter\nadjusted to give a pressure of 2 gms. which was felt\nonly as a light contact in the normal condition of the\nskin.\nThe head of the subject was covered with a black\nvelvet cloth in order that he might not see what the\noperator was doing, and the arms were covered with\nsheets of glass in order to eliminate the possibility of\nfeeling the direction of passes made over them. The\neffect of making upward or downward passes over either\nof the arms was then investigated. Professor Alrutz\nreported that he found that making downward passes\nover either arm caused that arm to become anaesthetic\nand analgesic while the arm on the opposite side of the\nbody showed an increased hyperaesthesia. Making upward\npasses over one arm, on the other hand, caused that\narm to show increased hyperaesthesia while the opposite\narm showed diminished sensitivity. The intervention of\nglass or plates of metal between the subject's arm and\nthe hand making the passes did not prevent the effect of\nthe \" effluence,\" but thick cardboard and flannel were\nimpervious to it. If, therefore, a wad of flannel or\ncardboard were interposed between two metal plates and\nthe whole were placed over the arm before the passes\nwere made, it was found that the sensibility remained\nunchanged over that part of the arm covered by the\nimpervious material, while the rest of the arm showed\nthe changes resulting from the particular Idnd of passes\nmade. Professor Alrutz also said that the expected results\nfoUowed from this method even when the passes and the\nexamination of sensibflity were made by someone who was\nin ignorance of the position of the impermeable pad.\nThis he calls the non-informed method.\nAmongst other phenomena described are irradiation, or\nthe spreading of the hyperaesthesia on one side of the\nbody and the anaesthesia on the other, over the whole\n\f440 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Tliouless [part\nof the sides of the body so that \" the middle sagittal\nline of the body becomes strictly the borderline \" {8.P.B.\nProc, Vol. XXXII. p. 159). The changes in sensibility then\naffected the special sense organs on the two sides ; the nostril\nand eye on the hyperaesthetic side became hyperaesthetic while\nthose on the other side became anaesthetic. Alrutz also stated\nthat the nervous effluence could be transmitted along a\nrod of glass, and that this transmission was shown by\nthe effect of the ojjerator pointing with a glass rod at\nthe base of one of the fingers, Avhich was found to cause\nthat finger to be extended.\nThe time that it was possible to devote to Mr. Wallenius's\ndemonstration at Groningen was very strictly limited.\nWe, therefore, concentrated on a repetition of the experi-\nment by the non-informed method in which passes are\nmade over one arm covered by two sheets of zinc with\na pad of thick card-board between them, and it is claimed\nthat while the sensibility of the rest of the forearm is\nchanged by the passes there remains under the pad a\npatch of unchanged sensibility.\nWe chose this experiment because it was one in which\nit was easy to gauge the success obtained, and to apply\nto it various methods of control. If, moreover, it suc-\nceeded under satisfactorily controlled conditions it would\nbe a crucial proof of the necessity for some such hypo-\nthesis as Professor Alrutz put forward. Mr. Wallenius\nhas made a protest (printed below), against our procedure.\nHe apparently wished to give a demonstration of his\nwhole research. That would have been interesting, but\nquite unconvincing to those who required pi'oof that there\nwas any agent at work other than the normal processes\nof suggestion and perceptual hyperaesthesia in hypnosis.\nTime did not permit of both an extended uncontrolled\ndemonstration and of a single properly controlled experi-\nment, and of the two alternatives there could be no\ndoubt as to which we should choose.\nOur reason for not choosing the extended demonstration\nwas not only that such a demonsti-ation is always incon-\nclusive as evidence when the reality of a phenomenon is\nin question. There were also special reasons connected\n\fiifi] Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 441\nwith the unsatisfactory technique of Mr. Wallenius.\nProfessor Alrutz himself states that he carried out his\nexperiments in absohite silence. This is obviously a\nnecessary precaution to avoid the possibility that the\nsubject may discover, if not by the actual words of the\nojjerator, at least by his tone, whether the results which\nwere being produced w^ere in the direction expected.\nThis i^recaution Mr. Wallenius did not observe, and his\nfrequent remarks to the subject and ejaculations, would\nhave rendered any experiments made by any other than\nthe non-informed method of no value at all as evidence.\nBefore the demonstration, Mr. Wallenius himself in-\nspected all arrangements and apjaaratus and cut also in\nour presence and in that of the subject, the piece of\ncardboard, its size being about 10 cm. long and as wide\nas the zinc box itself, so that it might be sufficiently big\nto give a distinct projection on the underlying arm.\nFirst Demonstration.\nSeptember lOfh, 11.15 a.m., in a room of the j^sycbological\nlaboratory in the University building of Groningen.\nPresent, besides Mr. Wallenius (G. W.) and the subject\n(S) a young Swedish man : Prof. P. Janet, Prof. W.\nMacDougall, Dr. F. H. G. van Loon, Prof. F. Roels,\nProf. C. Spearman and Dr. R. H. Thouless.\nIt was arranged that Dr. van Loon should act as\ninterpreter and write a detailed record of the experiments,\nwhilst Dr. Thouless would stay outside the room and put\nthe piece of cardboard into the zinc box. This box was\nmade of two zinc plates, and after the cardboard was\nput in, it was closed all round the margin by means of\nsticking-plaster.\nDuring the last part of the experiment, Dr. Thouless\nstayed outside the demonstration room. This was arranged\nso that not only could the position of the piece of cardboard\nnot be perceived by sight or feeling, but also that no\ninfluence could be exerted through telepatlw from a person\nin the same room.\nDuring these experiments the sensibility of the arm\nto pain was examined with an aesthesiometer, the pressure\n\f442 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part\nof which could be varied. The two grams pressure which\nwas used gave a slight sensation of pain to a normal\nperson.\nThe subject is sitting in a chair with support for his\nhead, his arms resting in open cardboard boxes covered\nwith glass plates. The face is covered with a thick\nblack cloth.\nAt first a few demonstrations are made which are not\nconnected in any way with the experiment which was\nasked for (reading of optotypes, solving a few simple\nmultiplying problems : 7 x 8\u2014answer 56, 5 x 6\u2014answer 30).\nThen the sensibility of the subject for pain (by aesthe-\nsiometer), light touch (with a pad of cotton wool) and\ncold (with a metal rod) are examined by G. W. These\nappear to be normal, right and left the same. The\nsubject says that he feels at ease. He is then brought\ninto a hypnotic state by G. W. who stares into his eyes\nfrom a short distance away (about 15 cms.).\nWhen asked after a few moments to open his eyes, he\ncannot do so. G. W. then gives him the verbal sugges-\ntion not to sleep too deeply.\nAn examination of sensibility (by G. W.) : needle\npricks (with same aesthesiometer) are now felt as pain,\nright and left arms the same, apparently stronger than\nbefore. Light touch and cold are well perceived, both\nright and left.\nThe subject now makes a few spontaneous movements\nwith his head and arms. When asked by G. W. whether\nhe feels at ease he complains of feeling hot under the\ncloth. This is taken off for a few moments, then laid\nover his head again.\nAt 11.30, G. W. starts making passes. These are made\nin a quiet tempo with both hands and arms downwards\nand making stroking movements above both arms of the\nstibject (but withoiit contact). He is standing in front\nof the subject and the passes are performed so that his\nfinger tips remain at about 1 or 2 cm. distance from the\nglass cover. After the downward stroke G. W. brings\nback his arms in a somewhat quicker upward and outward\nmovement.\n\f102] Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 443\nAfter five passes, examination of sensibility of arms by\nG. W. : light touch on both arms felt as itching, pain on\nboth arms strongly felt more than before the passes.\n[Result irregular\n\u2014\ni.e., not in accordance with Professor\nAlrutz's theory.]\nAfter another five passes the same result.\nNow G. W. stands more to one side of the subject and\nperforms the passes with his right hand only over the\nsubject's right arm and in an upward direction.\nAfter five passes pricks felt more strongly right than left.\nAfter seven more upward passes : pricks with needle\n(aesthesiometer) no longer felt as pam on left arm, no\nreflex movements. On right arm and hand pricks jjro-\nduce a painful sensation shown at once by reflex move-\n\u00bb ments, (lifting up of hand). [Result regular.]\nIt seems to the observers that G. W. whilst examining\n^ the sensibility, makes more movements and talks more\nthan is necessary. Also the reflex movements of the\nsubject seem to be a little \" exaggerated \" ; he is obvi-\nously less quiet than at the beginning.\nSix more upward passes : pricks on right arm now\nperceived again less intensely as \" itching.\" (\" Es kitzelt\nrechts,\" G. W. explams.)\nFour passes more : only itching on right arm when\npricked with needle. Light touch with pad of cotton\nwool : itches on left arm, no reaction on right arm.\nSeven more passes : examination of sensibility gives\nno result, the subject not showing any sign of pain.\nG. W. waits a few moments, then starts again upon a\nseries of five passes, upward over the right arm. After\ntwo series there appears again to be a difference in sensi-\nbility between right and left arm, however rather indis-\ntinct.\nAfter five more upward passes, pricks are felt much more\nstrongly on right arm than on left.\nAt 11.45 G. W. suddenly takes off the cloth and now\nshows us that the whole left side of the subject's body is\nanalgesic {to the pai^i stimtdiis used) and insensible to\nlight touch as well. After readjusting the cloth, G. W.\nagain makes several upward passes over the right arm.\n\f444 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part\nThen, on a sign from G. W., Dr. van Loon brings in\nthe zinc plates, between which Dr. Thouless in another\nroom has already fixed a piece of cardboard in the\nmanner already described. This zinc box is now fixed\nover the left (insensible) arm so that it is quite free\nfrom the underlying arm (the glass plates already having\nbeen removed).\nG. W. again makes upward passes over this left arm.\nAfter the first series of five passes G. W. examines the\nsensibility and the subject shows signs of pain when\npricked near the elbow.\nAfter a second series of passes, i>ain is now also shown\non the back of the hand just above the knucldes.\nAfter a third series, the areas of sensibility are increas-\ning, from the middle of the fingers to half-way along\nthe back of the hand and from the elbow to about 10 cm.\nbeneath it.\nAfter the fourth series, pain felt from second phalanx\nto a little above the wrist, and in a zone of about 12 cm.\nunder the elbow.\nAccording to this result the cardboard must be on\na spot from a little above the wrist to about 12 cm.\nbelow the elboAv. This place and its limits are marked\nupon the zinc box, which is taken into the other room\nand opened in the presence of all who assisted at the\ndemonstration, with the exception of G. W. and his\nsubject.\nThe piece of cardboard is not found on the marked\npart but above it, overlapping it by about 1 cm. (See Fig. 1.)\nDuring the oj)ening of the box, G. W. was alone with\nthe subject. The result of the experiments was not told\nto him.\nSecond Demonstration.\nConditions similar, but Dr. Thouless and Mr. F. C.\nBartlett were also present whilst Prof. Roels prepares the\nzinc box and Dr. van Loon examines the sensibility.\nThe riglit hand and arm are now made insensible by\nmeans of ujiward passes over the left arm. After a few\nstrokes this is already attained. [Result regular.]\n\fPLATE I.\n\f\f102] Report of Demonstration .of Experiments on Hypnotism 445\nThe zinc box is now brought in again and put on the\ncardboard box over the right forearm.\nAfter a few upward passes the sensibihty is examined :\npricks are now felt with sensation of pain (shown by\nhfting up the hand) on the middle of the forearm. By\na few more series of passes the whole forearm gradually\nbecomes sensitive again with the exception of a zone on\nthe back of the hand of about 10-12 cm. breadth above\nand below the wrist.\nWhen now the zinc box is opened in the other room,\nthe cardboard again is not found on the marked area but\ntotally below it in the lowest end of the box (over the\nfingers). See Fig. 2.\nThe result of both experiments is thus totally negative.\nThird Demonstration.\nThe next day {l\\th September), G. W. continues his\ndemonstration at 11 o'clock a.m. in the same room in\nthe presence of Mr. F. C. Bartlett, Prof. K. H. Bouman,\nDr. F. H. G. van Loon, Dr. C. S. Myers and Prof. H.\nZwaardemaker, whilst Dr. R. H. Thouless is again in the\nadjoining room jjreparing the zinc box and placing the\npiece of cardboard.\nG. W. is asked to rejaeat once more the same experi-\nments as on the previous day.\nAt 11 a.m. the subject has been brought into a hypnotic\nstate by G. W. ; he now wears a pair of blind spectacles\ninstead of the black cloth.\nAfter two series each of five or six i\\pward passes on the\nright arm, this one apj)ears to be hypo-sensitive, the left\none hyper-algesic. After a few more passes, the right\narm is anaesthetic. [Result irregular.]\nNow G. W. gives a few more passes, with the result\nthat now the sensibility returns in both arms and after\nstill more series of passes over the right arm, no difference\nin sensibility appears to exist between the two arms.\nNow G. W. again places himself immediately in front\nof the subject and performs several downward passes\nwith both arms. He then again makes the upward strokes\n\f446 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part\nover the right arm, but after three series (of about six passes)\nno distinct result is yet attained.\nThen suddenly after a few more passes the right arm\nis said to be insensible.\nAt 11.15 the zinc box is placed above the right arm\nand G. W. again performs his- upward passes with the\nresult that after a few minutes an insensible area is\nlocalised on the back of the hand from the knuckles to\nabove the wrist.\nThe position of the anaesthetic patch having been\nmarked exactly on the upper zinc plate, the box is opened\nin the adjoining room. Again the piece of cardboard is\nfound to be in quite another place, above the marked\nspot, with a free space of about 5 cm. between them.\n(See Fig. 3.)\nAt 11.45 one more experiment in the same circumstances\nis demonstrated in the presence of Mr. F. C. Bartlett,\nDr. C. S. Myers and Dr. F. H. G. van Loon, Dr. R. H.\nThouless again preparing the zinc box.\nAfter the latter has been put on the insensible right\narm and the upward passes by G. W. have been per-\nformed, Dr. van Loon again examines the sensibility.\nFairly soon a distinct analgesic zone (on the back of\nthe hand again) appears and a less distinct one three\nfingers heloiu the elbow. G. W. now examines the sensi-\nbility himself. He too finds a second analgesic zone (of\nabout 10 cm. width) a little below the elbow and under\nhis examination the outlines of this area become more\nprecise.\nBoth zones are marked precisely on the zinc box and\nthis is again opened. It is found that the box is absol-\nutely empty. (See Fig. 4.)\nThe results of both experiments, of the second day were\ntherefore also totally negative. The last experiment,\nwhere two insensible zones had been projected on to the\narm, whilst the zinc box did not contain any cardboard\nat all, is specially instructive, for it shows the clear\ninfluence either of the subject's expectation, or that of\nthe experimenter.\n\fPLATE II.\n\f\f102] Beport of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 447\nLast Demonstration.\nAfter these totally negative results, G. W. asked to\nperform another demonstration\u2014an experiment in which\nby pointing with a glass rod at one of the subject's\nfingers (the subject being blindfolded and in the hypnotic\nstate) he makes the latter stretch the finger pomted at,\nthus showing the transmission of the effluence through a\nglass rod.\nFirst Experiment. G. W. points at second finger of\nright hand. The subject after a few minutes stretches\nfour times his left thumb, then his right thumb, then the\nright second finger and immediately afterwards his left\nthumb again.\nSecond Experiment. G. W. points successively at the\nfifth, fourth and middle fingers of the left hand without\nany reaction of the subject.\nThen while the left middle finger is being j)ointed at\nthe subject says he feels tickling at his left wrist.\nThird Experiment. The glass rod is pointed at several\nspots on the left forearm, again without result.\nG. W. now again makes upAvard passes on the left arm,\nwith the result that the right arm becomes hyper-sensitive.\n[Result again irregular.]\nHe then brings the subject into a deeper state of\nhypnosis, and again performs the same upward passes\non the left arm, but now the right arm has become\ninsensitive, the left one hyper-sensitive. [Result now\nregular.]\nFourth Experiment. G. W. j)oints at the second left\nfinger.\nAfter some time several stretching movements of the\nright and left thumb are seen and once also of the\nsecond left finger.\nWhen asked by G. W. the subject says he is sleeping\nvery deeply and badly understands what G. W. intends\nto say and communicate to him.\nFifth Experiment. G. W. points at the left fourth\nfinger. The subject makes several bending and stretching\nmovements with the left forearm and hand and stretches\nseveral fingers.\n\f448 F. H. G. Van Loon and B. H. Thouless [part\nSixth Experiment. G. W. again points at the left\nfoiirth finger. Successively the thumb (once), the second\nfinger (three times), and the middle finger (twice) are\nstretched.\nG. W. who during the last experiments had already\nnearecl the skin very closely, now seemed unconsciously to\ntouch the subject's skin betAveen the knuckles of the third\nand fourth finger. The subject after a moment, points\nwith his other hand at this spot and rubs it. G. W.\nnow says that the subject appears to be able to point\nat the exact spot but not to stretch the finger. He does\nnot know why. When asked, G. W. states that he thinks\nthe pointing experiments have succeeded.\nIt is not necessary to emphasize the completely negative\ncharacter of these results. A study of the records of the\ndemonstrations shows that even the primary effect of the\n23asses (anaesthesia on the same side and hyperaesthesia\non the opposite side for downward passes and vice versa)\nshowed irregular results about as often as results pre-\ndicted by Professor Alrutz's theory. Figs. 1, 2 and 3\nsho^v the total lack of any relation between the position\nof the cardboard and the anaesthetic patch when the\nnon-informed method was used.\nMr. Wallenius in his statement (printed below) attributes\nthese discrepancies to a displacement of the projection\nof the cardboard pad as a result of the interval between\nthe metal plates and tlie subject's arm. There are a\nfew comments which must be made on this explanation.\nFirst, the displacements are in both directions although\nill all of these experiments, the passes were made in the\nsame direction. Secondly, the distance between the\nmetal plates and arm was at least as small as that\nshown in the published photographs of Professor Alrutz's\nexperiments. Thirdly, there is no' more relationship be-\ntween the positions of the anaesthetic patch and the pad\nthan would be the result of pure chance. We believe\nthat Mr. Wallenius wrote without exact knowledge of\nthe recorded positions of the anaesthetic patch and the\npad (since, for obvious reasons, the results were not\n\f102] Report of Demonstration of Experiments 011 Hypnotism 449\ncommunicated to him during the course of the experi-\nment). If, with this knowledge, he were still prepared to\nexplain the discrepancy in this way, this would simply\nmean that he was prepared to explain any spatial dis-\ncrepancy whatever as a satisfactory positive result. This\nwould rob any assertion of positive results of all evidential\nvalue. We j)refer to think better of Mr. Wallenius's\ncritical judgment.\nThe results of the experiments were clearly negative.\nThe subject had seen the cardboard patch being cut and\nwas able in hjrpnosis to produce subconsciously an anaes-\nthetic patch of that size on his arm, but since there was\nno clue to the position of the pad, the position of the\npatch had no relationship to it. We have no doubt\nwhatever of the good faith of both Mr. Wallenius and the\nsubject, but we are satisfied that all that we saw was\nexplicable on the ordinary theory of suggestion.\nWe are aware of the fact that the results of this\ndemonstration are inadequate to prove conclusively that\nMr. Wallenius has not ever produced phenomena inexpli-\ncable on the ordinary theory of the reproduction of\nhypnosis. Still less are they adequate to show that the\nlate Professor Alrutz did not prove the existence of a\n\" nervous effluence.\"\nWe are impressed, however, by the fact that the\nresults expected were obtained {i.e. anaesthetic patches\nthe size of the cardboard appeared), but in a manner\nwhich showed that their appearance was due solely to the\nexpectation of the subject. Moreover, a study of the\naccounts of his work published by Professor Alrutz in\nEnglish does not satisfy us that sufficient precautions\nagainst this possibihty were taken by him, although he\ndevised many ingenious arrangements of his experimental\nmethod in order to eliminate it.\nIt is with reluctance that we venture to criticise the\nwork of one who is no longer able to reply, but it is\nnecessary to draw attention to a few points in Professor\nAlrutz's own communications which seem to us to make\nhis conclusions unconvincing. Experiments by the non-\ninformed method are alone able to prove the existence\n\f450 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part\nof this phenomenon, and it is with these only that our\nfirst two points are concerned.\nFirst, when Professor Alrutz describes his experiments\nby the non-informed method, he does not state that the\nperson who placed the pads was kept out of the room while\nthe examination of sensibility was being made. If he\nwas not, this appears to be a serious defect in method,\nsince a person in light hypnosis may easily be guided by\notherwise imperceptible indications from persons present\n(if not by true telepathy).\nSecondly, the statistical evidence produced by Professor\nAlrutz is inadequate for a precise determination of the\nprobability that successful results by the non-informed\nmethod were due to chance alone. In his article in the\nScandinavian Scientific Review he gives the following figures\nfor the combination experiment (28 experiments, of which\nonly 10 were by the non-informed method) : 17 completely\ncorrect, 8 incomplete insensibility or insensibility after\ncontinued excitation, 0 negative (no effect), 2 irregular in\ncertain respects, 7 rejected experiments. The 7 experiments\nrejected (for some defect in the experiment or because of\nthe intervention of some irrelevant factor) were ones in\nwhich the expected result did not appear. They must,\ntherefore, be counted as failures in a statistical analysis.\nWe have left, therefore, 17 successes against 11 not successes.\nWe do not know how many of these 17 successes were by\nthe non-informed method. Now the probability that this\nnumber of successes was due to chance depends partly\non how accurately the anaesthetic patch had to coincide\nwith the pad in order to be counted as a success. There\nare not a very large number of positions in which a\nj)ad as large as the one Mr. Wallenius required us to use\ncould be put on the forearm, and unless we have actual\nmeasurements of the position of the j)ad and of the\nanaesthetic patch in all experiments by the non-informed\nmethod we cannot be sure how positive these results are.\nSuch measurements may have been j)ublished in Professor\nAlrutz's book, but they are not to be found in either of\nhis English articles.\nLastly, there is one respect in which Professor Alrutz's\n\f102] Beport of Demonstration of Expe7'iments on Hyjmotism 451\nown results strongly point to a suggestion effect. This is\nin the phenomenon of \" irradiation.\" It is a recognised\nprinciple for distinguishing between physiologically and\npsychically produced anaesthesias that the former follow\nin outline the anatomical distribution of the sensory nerves,\nwhile the latter show no dependence on nerve distribution,\nbut follow the outlines of the external features of the\nbody. A hysterical or hypnotic anaesthesia, for example,\nmay include the whole of the hand or of the foot, although\nthe anaesthetic part is supplied by more than one sensory\ntrunk nerve and the same sensory trunk nerves supply also\nadjacent skin areas which are not anaesthetic.\nProfessor Alrutz's \" irradiation \" supplies a typical\nexample of such independence of structural nervous\ngroupings. The spreading of anaesthesia from one arm\nand the consequent spreading of hyperaesthesia from the\nother arm must take place through the central nervous\nsystem. The anaesthesia should, therefore, spread to\nthose parts of the body supplied with sensory nerves\nfrom the same side of the brain as the anaesthetic arm.\nThis should be the whole of that side of the body up to\nthe neck, the opposite side of the head, the opposite\nnostril, and the opposite half of both retinae. Alrutz\nreports, on the other hand, that the anaesthesia spreads\nto the whole of the same side of the body, including the\nnostril on that side of the body, and both sides of the\nretina on that side of the body, while the retina on the\nopposite side shoivs hyperaesthesia all round. While this\ndistribution of the anaesthesia is anatomically incredible\non Alrutz's theory that it is physiologically caused, it is\nexactly the kind of distribution we should expect if the\nirradiation were a suggestion effect.\nThe burden of proof rests with a theory challenging\none which rests on such a firm basis of scientific investi-\ngation as does the current theory of hypnosis. It is\nour opinion that the theory of \" nervous efiluence\n\"\nremains unproved, and that it is probable that the\nresults attributed in good faith to its action are, in\nreaUty, due to the combined action of auto-suggestion\nand hetero -suggestion.\n\f452 F.

The follow-\ning short summary was, however, read and agreed to by\nall of those who were present at any of the demonstrations.\nSummary.\nAt the 8th International Psychological Congress at\nGroningen (6-1 1th Sept., 1926), Mr. Wallenius gave a\ndemonstration of experiments, which were a repetition of\nthose performed by the late Professor Alrutz. These\nexperiments were claimed to show that hypnotism is the\neffect of a \" nervous effluence,\" and that it is not, as\nordinarily supposed, a psychological function.\nAt the first sitting (Sept. 10th) were present, as well as\nMr. Wallenius and the subject of the experiment (a\nSwedish metal-worker) : Prof. Janet, Prof. MacDougall,\nProf. Roels, Dr. van Loon, Prof. Spearman, Dr. Thouless,\nand (for the last part of the demonstration) Mr. Bartlett.\nThe experiment which was claimed by Prof. Alrutz to be\na crucial proof of his theory was performed under strictly\ncontrolled conditions. The next day, the same experiment\nwas performed twice more in the presence of Mr. Bartlett,\nProf. K. H. Bouman, Dr. van Loon, Dr. Myers, Dr.\nThouless and Prof. Zwaardemaker.\nThe methods and [the results obtained will be fully\nreported in a longer communication which we hope to\n\f102] Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 453\npublish in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical\nResearch (London). We can, however, say definitely that\nno phenomena occurred in this demonstration which could\nrequire the theory of nervous effluence.\nAll those before whom the experiments were demon-\nstrated agreed that the results obtained pointed to the\nordinarily accepted theory of suggestion in hypnosis as an\nadequate explanation of all the phenomena observed.\nThe following statement has been received from Mr.\nWallenius :\nStatement Received from Mr. Wallenius.\nTo the Committee constituted at the Psychologists' Congress\nat Groningen for judgment of the results of Dr. Alrutz's\ninvestigations on a hind of nervous effluence or radiation\nfrom the human hody.^\nOn account of the experiments made in my demonstra-\ntion of Alrutz's phenomena of nervous ra.diation, I\nconsider I ought to make the following notes. My task\nwas to demonstrate the method and eventually the very\nphenomena. According to Prof. Thouless the Committee\nwanted to test the permeability of the effect of the\npasses through different substances by that kind of\nexperiments, which afterwards were executed, in which\ntwo zinc plates with a piece of cardboard between them\nwere placed over the insensitive forearm, and ascending-\npasses were made. Disinclined for this kind of experi-\nments I mentioned a better arrangement for this examina-\ntion : to apply a plate of cardboard with a cutting out\nfor one of the fingers of the hand and a zinc plate over\nthe cardboard. The Committee, however, decided on\nthe former arrangement, and I agreed to its performance.\nThe arrangement proved to be unsatisfactory, as there be-\ncame a displacement between the place of the piece of card-\nboard and the corresponding insensitive zone of the skin.\nEvidently, it depended on that source of faults, which\nhere had influenced the unequal distance between the\nzinc plate and the surface of the skin. The supposition\n^ Scandinavian Scientific Review, Vol. III., 1924.\n2g\n\f454 Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism [PART\nfor an exact result is that the plates are placed quite\nclose to the skin. This, however, was not to be done by\nthe provisional arrangements being at my disposal.\nThe next day I asked Prof. Thouless to make some\nother experiments. The Committee, however, wanted at\nfirst to repeat the same experiment as before ;\nyet I got\nthe jDromise afterwards to show other things myself.\nThen I showed the effect of aiming with a glass rod on\nthe skin. Yet I never got the opportunity for anything\nmore. The experiment with the fingers of the hand, I\nmentioned, is not so dependent on the interspace between\nthe skin and the plates appHed above, as certainly a\ndisjolacement can take place here in the direction of the\nlength, but with difficulty across the hand between the\nseparated fingers.\nWith regard to the provisional arrangements it was\ntherefore an unfortunate choice of experiments that was\nmade, and it seems to me very peculiar that the Com-\nmittee did not pay any attention to other experiments,\neither to the physiological\u2014as this\u2014or to the more\npsychological.\nIn a general demonstration and also privately to\nProf. Kiesow and Dr. Gatti I showed other trials, among\nthem the finger test, and I think that at least Prof. K.\ngot an impression of the regularity of the phenomena and\ntheir inexplicability only by suggestion.\nI may request that this explanation of mine may be\nconsidered, when the Committee is to deliver its report.\nGtjstaf Wallenius.\n.

CAN cross-correspondences provide evidence for sur-\nvival ?\n2. Do cross-correspondences provide evidence for survival ?\n3. Does '\nOne crowded hour of glorious life ' provide\nevidence for survival ?\nThese are the questions which Mr. Piddington's article\nraises ^\n; and the present situation in psychical research\nmakes it in our opinion important that they should be\nseriously faced. The time has arrived when survival is\naccepted (on the evidence provided by jisychic phenomena)\nby so many men and women of high scientific standing,\nthat it is possible for those who take their beliefs on\nauthority to take this belief on good authority. This is\nvery satisfactory. However, it none the less behoves us\nto scrutinize very closely such evidence as comes before\nus ; and I venture to suggest that if in the future psychic\nphenomena continue more and more to convince, then so\nmuch the more, and for that very reason, should our\ncriticism become stringent.\nLet us consider our first question :\n'\nCAN cross-corre-\nspondences provide evidence for survival ?\n'\nAn imaginary\ncase will help us. I think the following might be taken\nas a strong case.\nOn the 5th November, 1927, an English automatist\nshould write :\nMessage from your deceased uncle A. B.\n176 A 39 X 6\nCommunicate XY, such and such an address, Peking.\n^Proc. S.P.R.\u2014Vo\\. XXXVI., pp. 345-375.\n\f456 A. F.

B. deceased :\n176 A 39 X 6 (in Arabic numerals and Roman letters)\nAwait communication.\nLet XY be ignorant of any language except Chinese.\nFor the sake of simplicity I have taken only two scripts ;\nthe case would be strengthened of course were they\nmultiplied. The whole argument would be strengthened\nwere such cases numerous.\nThis hypothetical case, if not ideal, I think may justifi-\nably be considered strong. If some would care to call it\ngrotesque, I would point out that it is not in the least\ngrotesque (it is very simple), and that it apjjears grotesque\nonly because, unfortunately, it has never happened. It is\nmost desirable that this point should be grasped.\nThere may be more, but there are three obvious possible\nexplanations of this case.\n(ft) Fraud.\n{h) An exciting species of telepathy.\n(c) Work by an independent and external intelligence\nwho may or may not be A.B., and who may or may not\nbe a surviving human intelligence.\nWe may at once eliminate (ft), for the question of fraud\ndoes not here interest us, and in our hypothetical case no\nprecautions have been taken to safeguard against it.\nWlien we come to consider the balance of probability as\nbetween (h) and (c), the verdict will be found to vary\naccording to the disposition and mental content of the\njudge ; and we shall be reminded yet once again that\nthe '\nreason '\nto which we refer our problems is nothing\nmore in reality than common sense, and that common\nsense in spite of its reassuring name is no longer '\ncommon '\nonce we pass beyond the very commonest of commonplace\naffairs. Quot Jiorimies, tot sententiae.\nBefore attacking our second and third questions we must\npause to analyse our hypothetical case in order to discover the\nconditions which are ideally required to make a cross-corre-\nspondence case '\nstrong ' as evidence of survival. It is\n\f102] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 457\nunnecessary to emphasize the point that even our strong\ncase provides, not proof of survival, but persuasive evi-\ndence at the most.\n1. The tAvo scripts are synchronous. This is required\nbecause a lapse of time between the one and the other\nwould allow for leakage of information whether trans-\nmitted normally or telepathically. Although we do not\nunderstand the working of telepathy, this is a desirable\ncondition.\n2. The two automatists are absolutely unknown one to\nanother. This condition needs no comment.\n3. They are of widely different race and nationality.\nIt is important that their habits of thought, life and\nlanguage should be as different as possible, smce, as most\nwill agree, the weakest spot in the armour of cross-\ncorrespondence is the danger of common sources of thought\nand word association.\n4. The message is purely conventional, and is numerical.\nWe can discard at once the possibility of coincidence on\nmathematical grounds, and that of common association of\nideas from the nature of the message.\n5. The Chinese autoniatist uses Arabic numerals and\nRoman letters. This fortifies the probability that the work\nis supernormal and of '\nEuropean '\norigin ; it also makes\nthe identity of the messages as close as is possible.\nIf it is added here that we do not understand the\nmodus operandi of automatic writings, we may close the\nfirst section of this paper in the hope that nowhere has\ncontroversial matter been introduced.\nAs regards question No. 2 : Do cross-correspondences\nprovide evidence for survival ? I have, owing to un-\nfamiliarity with automatic scripts, no remark to make\nbeyond suggesting that the more cross-correspondences\nfulfil the above conditions the greater will be the value of\ntheir evidence for survival ; and conversely\u2014the less,\nthe less.\nWe pass now to our third question : Does '\nOne crowded\nhour of glorious life ' provide evidence for survival ?\nWithout any discussion it may be seen at a glance that\neach of the five conditions is harshly violated.\n\f458 A. F. Hall [PART\n1. The cross-correspondences occur not on one day but\nduring a i)eriod of several years.\n2. The automatists are not unknown to each other\n;\ntwo of them are actually mother and daughter ; the third\nis either a friend or an acquaintance\u2014so far as one can\njudge from the meagre information given.\n3. They are all, presumably, of the same race and\nnationality, and for two of them at any rate we must\nassume similar habits of thought, life and language.\n4. The '\nmessage ' is verbal not numerical. It is not\nconventional. It is not identical.\n5. There is no evidence in any of the scripts of anything\nintrinsically sujoernormal.\nSuch being the case, either the evidence here given faUs\nvery far short of what is required : or the conditions imposed\nare too stringent. But since the hypothetical case from\nwhich the conditions are deduced provided nothing more\nthan persuasive evidence, and fell short of anything that\ncould be called proof, it does not seem wise to mitigate\nthem.\nIt is unfortunately necessary to add that in this case\nthe three automatists were, it appears, in the habit of\nsometimes transmitting to each other a knowledge of\nportions of their own scripts. One would like to know to\nwhat extent automatism in general, and their own scripts\nin particular, were discussed. This information is surely\nvital to the discussion.\nThere must be many hardened sceptics who laid down\nthis article with a sigh and thought no more about it.\nThese may be balanced against those who saw in it con-\nclusive evidence of survival. The present writer belongs\nto an intermediate class. To such a one, wherein lies the\nvalue of this case ? Well, firstly (and by way of digres-\nsion) it may be said that cross-correspondence of any sort\nmay prove the key to the elucidation of the mystery at\npresent surrounding the problem of automatic writing\nitself ; and to use this digression in the immediate business\nin hand, it may serve to remind us that the automatism\nfrom which we try to extract messages from the departed\nis itself an unexplained process.\n\f102] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 459\nTo resume our context : it has already been pointed out\nthat our hypothetical case sounded grotesque for no other\nreason than that such things do not happen. It is not\ngrotesque in any other way. How can we explain why\nsuch a thing does not happen ? Such a thing does not\nhappen either because departed intelligences are as a fact\nnot trying to communicate with us ; or because they, in\ntrying to communicate, are, owing to various difficulties,\nunable to transmit so clear evidence of their attempts.\nThere is a third possibility ;\nthey may not know that\nthey are communicating. It is not inconceivable that at\nthis moment, writing on such a topic, I may be trans-\nmitting messages, of what nature I know not, to those\nI have left behind in a previous mode of existence. Am\nI then to be blamed by the sceptics of that world for\nmy muddled messages ? Or are their recipients to be\nblamed for their credulity ? Clearly not.\nIt is only after making this assumption that there are\ndifficulties in transmission, that this cross-correspondence\ncan be accepted as ofiering any evidence at all of survival.\nUntil methods improve sufficiently to produce results\nsimilar to those in our '\nstrong ' case, we must put up\nwith limitations ; but we may not use these limitations to\nassist us in argument. It is not fair to argue that very\nmuddled reception proves difficulties of transmission, and\nthat difficulties of transmission prove a conscious super-\nnormal attempt at transmission. It is more modest to\nsuppose that muddled reception is the result of (perhaps\nmuddled) transmission of something from some muddled\nsource, e.g. subconscious ideas.\nAt this stage it seems worth while to make the sugges-\ntion that cross-correspondence cases similar to the\n'\nCrowded hour ' fall so far short of the standard de-\nmanded by the conditions deduced from our hypothetical\ncase, that they should not be considered seriously as\noffering evidence for survival. We may make any allow-\nance we like for difficulties of transmission ; but to make\nan allowance in our own favour is the very worst method\nof establishing a thesis. It is true that cumulatively even\na small number of these cases would prove absolutely their\n\f460 A. F. Hall [PART\nvalidity as against tlie explanation of sheer coincidence\n;\nbut, however many times they v>\"ere multiplied their\nevidence for survival as against their evidence for common\nassociations or telepathy would not be one iota increased.\nThis means that, unassisted by other phenomena, they are\nquite valueless as an argument. Were there no other\ntypes of psychic phenomena, would anyone have been\nled to a theory of survival by this type ? But cross-\ncorrespondence cannot borrow light, it can only volunteer\nits ovnx little beam\u2014in our opinion a very little one.\nWe \"nill now turn to the three scripts themselves and\nconsider to what extent it is necessary to postulate super-\nnormal causes (such as telepathy) in their elucidation.\nWe have tried to show that, although external supernormal\nagency may be the explanation, we have no right to\nsuggest it except in the absence of other explanations.\nOur right to postulate telepathy, if necessary, is based on\nthe fact that telepathy is an admitted j)henomenon\u2014on\nrare occasions at any rate, if not in every-day life.\nSurvival is in a different category.\nAs regards the scripts M.V. and H.V. it is almost im-\npossible to exaggerate the chances of common sources of\nassociation ; and although some attempt has been made\nto indicate what some of these common sources may be,\nit must be obvious that such an attempt is hopelessly\ninadequate ; for when we remind ourselves that these\nsources may be recent or remote, may be conscious or\nsubconscious, and must be so numerous as to be almost\nunlimited in number, we shaU realise that M.V. and H.V.,\nif they set themselves to enumerate them, could them-\nselves suppty but a very smaU fraction of them. If it\nbe argued that only such of them as are relevant here\nneed be known, the reply must be made that our feeble\nunderstanding of mental processes in general and of auto-\nmatism in particular does not allow us to know which\nare relevant here. Judging from p. 372, as well as from\nhis manipulation of associations (pp. 352-369), we find that\nMr. Piddington thinks the sleuthing of mental processes an\neasy matter ; but surely this is an operation often beyond\nour powers even in the case of our ovm normal conscious\n\f102] One Crowded Hour of Gloriou-s Life 461\ncerebrations : how much harder must it not be in the\ncase of automatic A\\Titing by people unknown to us 1 In\nother words it does not seem to be true that a critic's\nargument, based on the likelihood of common sources of\nassociation, would be invalidated if he could not '\ntrace\nthe process step by step '\n(p. 372). Indeed we would\nsuggest that even if no evidence at aU were available of\nthoughts common to M.V. and H.V., the fact of their\nrelationship alone would make highly precarious any\ntheory as startling as that of survival based on a few\ncross-correspondences in their automatic scripts. But as\na matter of fact the verbal cross-correspondences here are\nof a nature which we would suggest would not be very\nsurprising if they were noted in the scripts of two complete\nstrangers, so long as those two complete strangers both\nbelonged to the literary (or even merely literate) portion\nof the English speaking race, and were both exposed to\na common literary stimulus such as '\nNot once or twice,\netc' Such being the case we may now include the W.\nscript -nith the other two in our discussion. It is most\nunfortunate that the reader is quite unable to form any\nopinion as to the closeness or other^-ise of W.'s connexion\nwith M.V. and H.V. We will, therefore, assume that she\nis almost a complete stranger to them. Should she, in\nfact, be an acquaintance, a friend or a close companion,\nanything which appears remarkable in the cross-corre-\nspondences A\\ill (if they originate in telepathy or common\nassociations) be the less remarkable in the same order and\ndegree.\nTo illustrate the absolute association between the three\nkey quotations may we allow ourselves to imagine a\nconversation somewhat as follows ?\nOptimist : Xot once or twice in our rough island-story,\nthe path of duty was the way to glory.\nPessimist : The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\nOptimist : True ; but one crowded hour of glorious life\nis worth an age without a name.\nIt is of no importance, since his meaning is clear, that\nthe pessimist has distorted the meaning of Gray's line ;\nand this distortion and its use in this other context has\n\f462 A. F. Hall [PART\nbeen noted by Mr. Piddington in the scripts. Should the\noptimist wisla to illustrate his moral from literary sources,\nit appears to me that Socrates, Achilles, Sir John Moore\nand Wolfe almost shout their claims to selection. Mr.\nPiddington has neglected, I believe, to note that the\nauthor of '\nThe Burial ' was named Wolfe.\n\" Not once or twice in our rough island-story\nThe path of duty was the way to glory.\"\nTennyson.\nOne shudders at the very thought that they might have\nbeen omitted, but these lines very rightly are included in\nthe series since they may have influenced the subsequent\nscripts of all three automatists. Indeed, as Mr. Piddington\npoints out, there seems internal evidence in K of this\ninfluence. They have been mentioned earlier in this\narticle as a literary stimulus which might very naturally\nelicit '\nThe paths of glory ' and '\nOne crowded hour.'\nWith this suspicion in my mind I handed to a friend a\nnote which to the best of my memory ran as follows :\n\" Not once or twice in our rough island story\nThe path of duty was the way to glory.\"\nWill you jot down any lines from poets or any incidents\nliterary or historical which are suggested by any word, phrase\nor idea in above ? Associations may be free or casual, and\nneed not be reasoned. It is absolutely essential there should be\nno collaboration.\nThis note I asked him also to show to his wife. He\nis a man steeped in the classics ; his wife has strong\ninterests in modern literature. I judged the pair suitable\nfor experimental purposes in this connexion. I feared at\nfirst I should obtain no result as my friend was reluctant\nto waste time, and I refused stubbornly either to explain\nthe object of this strange request or to give examples of\nthe sort of material I required. As a result probably of\nthis reluctance I was unfortunate in extracting no more\nthan seventeen quotations altogether, while there is no\nreturn at all to my demand for incidents literary and\n\f102] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 463\nhistorical. This to me was highly disappointing as I had\nhoped for more conclusive results, and could not believe\nthat the deaths of Socrates, Achilles, Moore and Wolfe\n(particularly of the last two from our island-story) could\nescape some mention. On the other hand the paucity of\nquotations very much enhances the value of what positive\nresults accrued.\nI give the two scripts for the sake of interest and in\nparticular to show how unexpected some of the associations\nmay be ;\ne.g. Script A.

In the\ncase of W.'s script (W. 225), we have no evidence of the\nquantity of script jDroduction since the automatist received\nher stimulus in the year previous. This is a suitable\noccasion for registering our regret that only one W. script\nis cited, so that we are unable to form any opinion as to\nantecedent tendencies. For instance it would be inter-\nesting to know whether W. had any bias towards any\nparticular word in our stimulus, e.g. '\npath,' '\nduty,' '\nglory.'\nAs illustration I suggest that our Script B has a natural\nbias in favour of the word (and its connotations) '\npath.'\nHad B had a like bias instead towards the word '\nglory,'\nwe might have obtained \" One crowded hour of glorious\nlife.\" (I apologise for introducing suggestion into my\nargument.) As comment on the single cross-correspondence\nin scripts A and B I should like to ask whether Mr.\nPiddington (' for a sufficient reward in hard cash '\nperhaps)\nwould undertake to discover in the current stock of\nEnglish '\ntags '\nany line more powerfully suggested by our\ntwo lines from Tennyson than '\nThe paths of glory lead\nbut to the grave.'\nFor the benefit of any readers who may have found\ninterest in scripts A and B, I will quote from a letter\nreceived from A in reply to one from me enquiring whether\n\f102] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 465\nmy stipulation as regards collaboration had been under-\nstood. He writes :\nI will strive to give an exact reialy, I handed [my wife]\nyour piece of paper with the remark, '\nHall has just given me\nthis, and requires an immediate answer : you will see that no\ncollaboration is allowed.' [She] thereupon began at once to\nflow. I did not look at either her quotations or the paper till\nevening, when I wrote do\\^'n the few scraps which had collected\nin the back of my mind in the meantime.\nBut perhaps there was little need of experimental\nmethods to establish an association which from the first\nwas almost inevitable. If association of ideas plays any\npart in automatic wTitings, we must expect '\nThe paths of\nglory '\n(so far as we must expect anything) in all three\nscripts ; for this is the association to '\nThe path of duty\n'\nmost likely to strike literate English folk, if you asked\nthem in their normal condition ;\nalthough w^e are in no\nposition to infer the associations likely to strike auto-\nmatists in their abnormal condition.\n'\nThe crowded hour '\nhowever, is not an inevitable asso-\nciation. It has nevertheless a close logical connexion as\nappears from the conversation bet\\veen the optimist and\npessimist. As it calls up before the present writer a\nmental picture of a copy of '\nLyra Heroica '\nwdth the four\nlines, '\nSound, sound the clarion, etc' in gilt letters on its\nred cover, he is prejudiced and in no position to assess the\naverage chances of its appearing in three scripts during\nsome fifteen months as reaction to the Tennyson stimulus.\nIt has to be remembered, however, that if this is the\nresult of normal association, the common stimulus should\nperhaps be considered to be not the Tennyson lines alone,\nbut those two lines plus their inevitable progeny, '\nThe\npaths of glory.' This stiffening of the stimulus must very\nmuch increase the chances of the reaction, '\nOne crowded\nhour of glorious life,' both logically as a thought associa-\ntion and verbally as a '\nglory '\nassociation ;\ne.g. script F :\n'\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave\u2014glory\u2014one\ncrowded hour of glorious life . . .\n.' This is the sort of\nmethod we should normally adopt if we attempted to\n\f466 A . F. Hall [PART\nindicate the process of association step by step. If this\nis a justifiable contention we shall not be surprised to find\nthat both H.V. (script F) and W. (script K) give these two\nquotations in conjunction, while in K the mental presence\nof '\nThe path of duty ' also is, as Mr. Piddington shows,\nactually suggested by the wording '\nThe way to highest\nglory leads but to the grave.' As regards M.V., '\nThe\ncrowded hour ' (G) follows immediately '\nThe paths of\nglory '\n(D) in the scripts as given, although there is a gap\nof 40 unpublished scripts between these two, and an interval\nof over six months.\nLyra Heroica is a book of verse for boys of which its\ncompiler, W. E. Henley, writes in his preface that it is\n'\nto set forth, as only art can, the beauty and the joy of\nliving, the beauty and the blessedness of death, the glory\nof battle and adventure, the nobility of devotion\u2014to a\ncause, an ideal, a passion even\u2014the dignity of resistance,\nthe sacred quality of i:)atriotism.' As text for such a\ncollection he chooses, and gives on the title page, these\nwords :\nSound, sound the clarion, fill the fife,\nTo all the sensual world proclaim\nOne crowded hour of glorious life\nIs worth an age without a name.\nThe same text has been chosen by Mr. Piddington for\nhis extracts from three automatic scripts, because he argues\nthat '\ndue to some one's intelligent design it is meant to\nindicate a connexion between the three different contexts\nin which it was inserted.' Tlie text is in both instances\napt ; its aptness in the second instance, however, will\nsupport a normal as readily as a supcrnomial explanation ;\nfor associations are apt to (jo aj)t\n\u2014\ntho only ones we\nnotice at any rate ; and the normal explanation rests on\nthe argument tliat some associations are so af)t as to\nbe inevitable.\nBut a far more serious objection to the supernormal\nexplanation is involved. If some one's intelligent design\ncan deliberately fjroduco in] - three scripts a quotation\nspecially chosen for the purpose of indicating something,\n\f102] One Crowded Hour of Olorious Life 4(i7\nwhy cannot it produce a striking convention;\u00bb.l iu(\\ss;i!;hi\nsuch as was deliberately produced in our liypothetica.1\ncase ?

F. Hall [PART\nNote on Lyra Heroica.\nIn appending a note on Lyra Heroica I wish to make\nquite clear the bearing which this reference lias on the\nargument. (1) It is a comment on the analytic methods\nused by Mr. Piddington : but it is something much more\nthan that. (2) It may turn out that the book may at\none time or another have been seen by one or more of\nthe automatists : but even this interesting point is im-\nmaterial to the argument. (3) The argument is that there\nis a probability that the cross-correspondences are the\nresult of normal association. We can only test this by\nseeing what the normal associations actually are. Scripts\nA and B offered us some assistance here. But we are\nfurther assisted by the fortunate fact that there exists\njust what we want, a collection of hackneyed English\npoems dealing with the theme :\n'\nOne crowded hour of\nglorious life is worth an age without a name.' Here we\nhave an objective standard for comparison. Do the poems\nshow correspondences similar to those of the scripts ?\nThis is important ; for the correspondences between the\npoems must be precisely what Ave suggest the script corre-\nspondences are : that is, normal.\nIt will have been noticed that our attention has been\nconfined almost entirely to the verbal cross-correspondences,\nand but little reference made to the section (pp. 352-369),\ndealing with supposed thought connexions. This is because\nthat section appears to the present writer to be an\nelaboration of what may be termed the normal or '\nassocia-\ntion '\ntheory\u2014an elaboration far beyond his own powers,\nbut, nevertheless, confirmatory of the theory he has\nsupported in explanation of this case. As postscript to\nhis general argument he proj)oses here to devote a few\nwords, in this connexion, to the contents of Lyra Heroica.\nThis collection of verses has been mentioned before. The\nfew lines quoted from its preface, if not its title alone,\nare sufficient to describe its nature. The '\nCrowded hour\n'\nquotation is its text.\n\" Fight ever fight on ... .

Hall says that my paper called \" One Crowded Hour\nof Glorious Life \" raises three questions :\n(1) Can cross-correspondences provide evidence for\nsurvival ?\n(2) Do cross-correspondences provide evidence for\nsurvival ?\n(3) Does \" One crowded hour of glorious life \" provide\nevidence for survival ?\nWhen he writes \" these are the questions which Mr.\nPiddington's article raises,\" I understand him to mean\nthat \/ raised these questions, or at any rate the third\nquestion ; and as most readers of Mr. Hall's article will,\nI feel sure, so understand him, I had better begin by\nsaying that I neither raised, nor intended to raise, any one\nof these three questions.\nThe conclusion to which consideration of the \" One\nCrowded Hour \" group of scripts led me I expressed thus :\nUntil detailed explanation on normal lines is forth-\ncoming, I shall prefer to believe that the coincidences\nwere either due to some remarkable form of telepathic\ninterchange between the automatists, or else were the\nwork of some directing mtelhgence, operating on them\nab extra. And of these two theories I prefer the second.\nI used, of course, the neutral phrase \" some directing\nintelligence, operating . . . ab extra \" dehberately, in order\nto leave the identity of this intelKgence an open question.\nIf, then, Mr. Hall means that \/ put forward the \" One\nCrowded Hour \" case as evidence for survival, I need\n\f472 J. G. Piddingfon [PART\nonly repeat that I did not ; and if he means that others\nare hkely to find in it evidence for survival, I can only\nsay that tliat is not niy concern.^\nI welcome Mr. Hall's experiment of giving the game\nliterary stimulus to two friends and getting them to\nwrite down independently their associations therewith,\nbecause, with the conditions somewhat altered, a series\nof experiments of this kind might afford guidance to us\nwhen we try to estimate what sort of coincidences between\nthe scripts of various automatists may reasonably be\nattributed to common associations of ideas, and what not.\nThat the particular experiment proved \" highly dis-\nappointing \" from Mr. Hall's point of view will not, I\nhope, deter him from making further experiments ; for\nif it can be shown that coincidences as complex and\nelaborate as those which characterize cross-correspondences\ncan be produced by people with no pretensions to super-\nnormal faculty, then the sooner that is established the\nbetter. Only I would suggest that the conditions of\nsuch experiments should be made to correspond more\nnearly to ,\nthose under which the automatists work, as\notherwise the results will not be instructive. On Mr.\nHall's plan of providing a common starting-point, coin-\ncidences are bound to occur. I am not finding fault\nwith Mr. Hall for having adopted this plan, because\nhis object was to see what kind of coincidences would\nbe elicited by a particular theme. But I want to point\nout that coincidences between scripts of the type under\ndiscussion are not the result of the automatists' having\nbeen given a common starting-point. They may occur\nbecaiise the automatists have independently chosen a\ncommon theme. In the \" One Crowded Hour \" case,\nfor instance, Mrs. Salter and Mrs. Willett may have both\nstarted from a common point : namely, \" not once or\ntwice in our rough island-story,\" which both knew had\nappeared in a script of Mrs. Verrall's. But if they did\nboth start from this same theme\u2014and that is pure\n1 If Mr. Hall, or any one else, cares to learn my view of the bearing\nof cross-correspondences on the evidence for survival, he will find it\nexpressed in the Journal for December 1910 (Vol. XIV., pp. 400-402).\n\f102] A Reply to Mr. Hall 473\nhypothesis\u2014they did not do so because it was, so to\nspeak, imposed upon them,\u2014at any rate in any normal\nmanner. If each selected it, why did they select that\nparticular theme for development out of many scores of\nother themes equally open to them ? Moreover, why\ndid both develop the theme, which they had thus inde-\npendently and by some happy chance mutually fixed\nupon, in the same way, though it was one that lent\nitself to variation in many directions ? For both Mrs.\nSalter's and Mrs. Willett's treatment of the (assumed)\ncommon theme runs on much the same lines, both laying\nstress on two ideas, death in battle and death in the\nmoment of victory or achievement, which are not in-\nevitably, nor, I think, obviously, suggested by it. In its\noriginal context\n\" Not once or twice in our rough island-story\nThe path of duty was the way to glory\n\"\nhas nothing to do with death in battle or death in the\nmoment of victory. The lines form part of a eulogy\nof the Duke of Wellington, who came through many\nbattles unscathed, lived to a ripe old age, and died in\nhis bed\u2014or, to be precise, in his armchair.\nIf, too, \"not once or twice,\" etc., was the common\nstarting-point selected independently by Mrs. Willett and\nMrs. Salter, it is strange that Mrs. Willett gets only a\nconfused allusion to it, and Mrs. Salter none at all.\nBesides the coincidence of Mrs. Salter's and Mrs. Willett's\nindependent choice of the same theme, there is the\nfurther coincidence of Mrs. Verrall's having developed\nthis same theme on the same lines as the other two ;\nfor she connected with it \" the paths of glory lead but\nto the grave,\" which I suggested\u2014and Mr. Hall, I under-\nstand, does not dissent from the suggestion\u2014represents,\nthrough its association with Wolfe, death in battle and\ndeath in the moment of victory. The triple coincidence\nis further enhanced by the well-timed appearance, for\nthe first and only occasion in Mrs. Verrall's scripts, of\n\" One crowded hoiu' of glorious life,\" just sixteen days\nafter its first appearance in Mrs. Salter's script.\nMr. Hall calls attention to the likelihood of common\n\f474 J. O. Piddington [PART\nassociations specially affecting the scripts of Mrs. Verrall\nand Mrs. Salter by reason of their close relationship. I\nshould certainly have expected the scripts of a mother\nand daughter, particularly when, as in the case in point,\nthey had received the same kmd of education, to exhibit\nmore numerous and more marked instances of common\nassociations than the scripts of two friends, or two\nacquaintances, or two strangers.^ That Mrs. Verrall and\nMrs. Salter possessed more associations in common than\neither had in common with any of the other automatists\nof our group is certain ; but I have no hesitation in\nsaying after many years' close study of their scripts\nthat this common fund of associations has been drawn\nupon in their scripts to a surprisingly small extent.\nNot merely are the tone, the style, the literary character\nand emotional colouring of their respective scripts notably\ni;nlike, but also their processes of thought and associations\nof ideas. If both independently make the same literary\nor artistic or historical allusions, such coincidences between\nthem are not more frequent than they are between cither's\nscripts on the one side and the scripts of the other\nautomatists on the other side.\nMr. Hall comjslains of being \" quite unable to form\nany opinion as to the closeness or otherwise \" of Mrs.\nWillett's connexion with Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Salter.\nHe must either have forgotten, or else be unaware, that\ninformation on this point has already been given in\nProceedings : information that a student may reasonably\nbe expected to look up for himself, and not to have\nrepeated every time that the concordant phenomena of\n\" these automatists come up for discussion.\nYet at the same time Mr. Hall would not, I gather,\nattach much importance to such information when pro-\nvided, on the ground that, however detailed, only a\nvery small fraction of all the possible common sources\nof association derived from the intercourse of relations,\nfriends, or acquaintances, could, even with the best will\nin the world, be set down in black and white. And there\nI entirely agree with him.\n1 kScc in this connexion, Pioc, Vol. XXTX., p. 11.\n\f102] A Reply to Mr. Hall 475\nAs regards \" Lyra Heroica,\" Mrs. Salter tells me that\nshe is not acquainted with it, and she believes that her\nmother did not possess a copy of it. I have not troubled\nto find out whether or not Mrs. Willett knows the book,\nfor the point seems to me immaterial, when we are\nconsidering the phenomena of automatists so widely read\nin English literature as Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Salter, and\nMrs. Willett. There are other anthologies, e.g. The Ojford\nBook of English Verse and The Golden Treasury, with\nwhich all three automatists were familiar and from which\nthey could have got some of their quotations. I find\nit easier, however, to suppose that it was not this or\nthat Anthology, but their general reading that supplied\nthem with the necessary material. None of the three would\nhave found any difficulty in illustrating with apposite\nliterary allusions derived from their general reading any\nof the themes that run through the \" One crowded\nhour \" group of scripts, or plenty of other themes. But\nthe wider their acquaintance with English literature, the\nnarrower the chance of their hitting on the same illu-\nstrations.\nAlthough, legitimately for his particular purpose, Mr.\nHall reviews the \" One Crowded Hour \" case as an\nisolated phenomenon, if a proper estimate is to be found\nof its worth or worthlessness as evidence for some form\nof supernormal activity, it must be considered as one of\na series\u2014a long series\u2014of similar cases. If, when Mr.\nHall speaks of his \" imfamiliarity with automatic scripts,\"\nhe means that he is not familiar with the numerous\npapers dealing with cross-correspondences that have\nappeared in Proceedings, it might interest, and perhaps\nperplex him to read some of them ; for among\nthem he will find instances where the coincidences cannot\nhave started, as hypothetically those involved in the\n\" One Crowded Hour \" case may have started, from a\ncommon stimulus normally experienced by the contributing\nautomatists. But if this is asking too much, he would\nperhaps undertake a lesser labour and do me the honour\nof reading the following pages, in which I give an account\nof a cross-correspondence (not presented as evidence for\n\f476 J.

The first of the four central scripts,\nscript C, though written some four years earfier than the\nother three, is an obvious prelude to the second and\nfourth. The remainder, scrijits D, E, and F, were all\nwritten within a period of twenty-eight days ; and it is\nin these three scripts that the heart of the matter lies.\nAt the same time, although I do attach importance\nto the nearness in date of D, E, and F, my own view is\nthat it is only artificially that the cross-correspondence\ncan thus be limited to the four central scripts ; and that,\nin spite of the interval of over ten years between scripts\nA and J, it really spreads over all ten scripts. The coinci-\ndences seem to me of too distinctive a character to be\ndiscounted on the ground that in so protracted a period\nof time they might occur by chance.\nThe two automatists concerned, Mrs. Salter and Mrs.\nKing, are only slightly acquainted, having met but two\nor three times, and then only for a few minutes. It will,\nperhaps, be a relief to the reader to learn besides that\nuntil December 1926\u2014that is, nearly two years after\nthe date of script J\u2014Mrs. King knew nothing whatsoever\nabout any script of Mrs. Salter's quoted or referred\nto in the present paper ; and that until January or\nFebruary 1927 Mrs. Salter knew nothing whatever about\nany script of Mrs. King's that I am going to quote.\nMoreover, no script of either automatist mentioned in this\npaper has hitherto appeared in the Proceedings or Journal,\nor elsewhere.\nBefore dealing with the four central scripts, I would\n\f480 .\/. G. Piddmgton [PART\nask the reader to note the relation of A and B to C, D,\nand F, which may be thus tabulated :\nTlie uttermost ends The topmost pinnacle The comerst\nThe uttermost ends Finistcrre\nFinisterrc Tiie topmost phuiacle The master builder\nThe master builder\nThe master builder The cornersi\n.Script A contains the first occurrence in all Mrs. Salter's\nscripts of the uttermost ends,\" of \"the topmost pinnacle,\"\nand of \" the cornerstone \" ; while B has the first mention\nof \" Finisterre \" and its equivalent \"Finis terrae \" (the\nend of the earth). As all these phrases re-appear in\nthe three scripts that furnish Mrs. Salter's contribution\nto the cross-correspondence, it will be as well to discuss\nthem at this point.\nThe uttermost enrls. In B .\n\" the uttermost ends of the\nearth shall not encompass it \" is immediately preceded\nby \" Finisterre \" and \" Finis terrae,\" and immediately\nfollowed by a quotation from Tennyson's Ulysses, which,\ntogether with its context, runs thus :\nfor my purpose holds\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\nOf all the western stars, until I die.\nIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down :\nIt may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\nAnd see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\"\n\" Finis terrae \" must reflect the idea of Ulysses voyaging\nto and beyond the limits of the world ; and taken in\nconnexion with \" the uttermost ends of the earth shall\nnot encompass it may point to the lines in Tennyson's\npoem in which Ulysses speaks of his unsatisfied craving\nfor ever fresh adventure, and of his desire\n\" To follow knowledge like a sinking star.\nBeyond the utmost bound of human thought.\"\nIn Script C \" Finisterre \" is followed by \" Over the\nedge,\" a phrase that re-appears in the following form\nand context in H.V. 551 :\n\" Over the edge of the world\u2014 to the end.\"\n\f102] The Master Builder 481\nHere \" to the end \" is a reference back to H.V. 432 :\n''\nTo endure to the end\u2014the uttermost\u2014to the\nworld's end.\"\nThese associated phrases\n\u2014\" Finisterre,\" \" Finis terrae,\"\n''the uttermost ends,\" \"Over the edge,\" \"Over the\nedge of the world,\" \"To the world's end,\" \"To endure\nto the end,\" \" The uttermost \"\u2014all belong to the\nUlysses topic, and represent the life-long pursuit of the\nunattainable. Although the Ulysses topic is beyond doubt\nwoven into the group of Mrs. Salter's scripts under dis-\ncussion, it does not enter into the cross-corresi^ondence,\nand so, for the present, the reader may dismiss it from\nhis mind, after first taking note that I regard \" Over\nthe edge \" as common to, and linking together, the topic\nof Ulysses with that of the Master Builder. ^\nThe topmost pinnacle. This phrase appears first in A,\nand then again\u2014for the only time\u2014in C, where it is\nimmediately followed by \"the kingdoms of the earth.\"\nThe juxtaposition clearly indicates that the reference is\nto two of Christ's temptations : the devil's offer of \" all\nthe kingdoms of the world,\" and the deviFs suggestion\nthat Christ should j)rove His divinity by casting Himself\ndown from a pinnacle of the Temple.\nThe cornerstone. In the form \" the cornerstone of the\nbuilders \" this first appears in A in immediate connexion\nwith \" the topmost pmnacle \" ; next in H.V. 433 as\nfollows :\nStriving somethmg about striving\u2014the homeward way\n[i.e. Odysseus = Ulysses \"striving to save his own life,\nand his comrades' homeward way \"]\u2014union\u2014a united band\n\u2014despised\u2014the cornerstone ;\nnext in H.V. 455 in the following form and context :\nThe temple of Solomon\u2014Solomon in all his glory\u2014the\nstone that the builders rejected ;\nand then in Script F, sandwiched between \" the master-\nbuilder \" and \"'\nthe church tower.\" What meaning may\n^ For a suggested explanation of tlie connexion of these two topics\nsee Appendix B.\n\f482 J.

Over the edge\n. . . down down down '\"\nand \" the church tower \"\u2014would\nhave sufficed to fix the reference.\nIn order to make intelligible the references in the\nscripts to Ibsen's Master Builder, I append a summary\nof some of the events antecedent to the action and of\nparts of the plot, ignoring, however, as irrelevant to the\nimmediate purpose, large tracts of the play.\nSummary of Parts of Ibsen's \" Master Builder.\"\nTen years before the play opens, Master Builder Solness\nhad been engaged on building a high tower on an old church\nat LySanger. When the tower was finished, there were\n\" grand doings in the town,\" and crowds came to watch\nSohiess, in accordance with ancient custom, climb up the\nscaffolding to the very top of the tower, and hang a wreath\non the weather-vane. Among the crowd was a party of\nschool-girls, di'essed in their best and carrying flags, which\nthey waved as Solness stood at the top. One of these school-\ngirls, Hilda Wangel by name, then between twelve and thirteen\nyears of age, was especially enthusiastic, and yeUed out\n\" Hurrah for Master Builder Solness !\n\" The ceremony over,\nSolness, after first attending a dinner in his honour at the\nlocal club, went to supper at the house of the district doctor,\nHilda Wangel's father. On entering the house, he found\nHilda alone in the room, and feeling, as he puts it in the\nplay, \" so buoyant and free that day,\" told the girl she was\nlooking lovely, promised to come back in ten years' time to\n\f102] The Master Builder 483\nmake her his princess and carry her off to a fairy kingdom ;\nand wound up the tete-a-tefe by putting his arms round her\nand kissing her agam and again.\nIn spite of his profession, it was no ordinary thuig for\nSohiess to chmb to the top of a high tower as he did at\nLysanger, for it made him giddy to stand even on a second-\nstorey balcony. Once and once only, and that was at\nLysanger, had he been able to nerve himself \" to do the\nimpossible \" and chmb to a great height ; and it was this\nsoHtary exploit that had excited the enthusiasm of Hilda,\nthough she had no suspicion of what it had cost him.\nWhen the play begms, exactly ten years to a day have\npassed since the ceremony at Lysanger. Solness meanwhile\nhas forgotten all about HUda. She, however, has not forgotten\nhim ;\nand, as he has not come back at the end of ten years\nto make her his princess, she leaves her home at Lysanger,\nand comes to Solness's house to claim the fulfilment of his\npromises. She finds him on the point of completing the\nbuilding of a new home for himself. A featiu:e of Solness's\nnew house is a very high tower. There is to be the usual\nceremony on completion of the building ; and HUda, after\ntaunting Sohiess for not daring to climb as high as he builds,\neventually goads him into j^romising to perform the ceremony\nhimself : which meant climbing to the top and hanging the\nwreath \" on the very pimiacle of the tower.\" The result is\nfatal to Solness, who, after reaching \" the topmost planks\n\"\nof the scaffolding and hanging the wreath round the vane,\nturns dizzy, falls, and is kUled on the spot.\nIt is to the Master Builder's ascent of the Church\nTower at Lysanger, and to his fall from the tower of\nhis own new house, that reference is made in Scripts C\nand F by means of the following phrases :\nSomething about a church\u2014a high pointed spire . . .\nOver the edge . . . down down down\u2014the master builder\n. . . the chmch tower ;\nand to these phrases should, I think, be added \" the\ntopmost pinnacle \" in C ;\nfor, though primarily the words\nrefer to the pinnacle of the Temple at Jerusalem, they\nmay well include a reference to \" the very pinnacle of\n\f484 J. G. Piddington [PART\nthe tower \" on which Sohiess, having climbed to \" the\ntopmost planks \" of the scaffolding, hangs the wreath.\nIn connexion with the use of the phrase \" the topmost\npinnacle \" reference to Christ's Temptation, it should\nbe noted that neither in St. Matthew's nor in St. Luke's\nGospel (our only authorities for the story) is the to-pmost\npinnacle spoken of : both Evangelists saying simply\nthat the devil set Christ \"on a pinnacle of the temple.\"\nIs there, then, any point in the script's variation ? I\nhave already suggested that \" the topmost pinnacle\n\"\nmay allude to \" the topmost j^lanks \" and \" the very *\npinnacle of the tower \" in Ibsen's play ; but the phrase\nin the script involves another literary allusion, and one\nwhich\u2014when all the evidence has been presented, though\nnot till then\u2014will appear not conjectural, but certain.\nMilton, who follows the order of St. Luke's narrative,\nbrings Paradise Regained to a conclusion with the tempta-\ntion on a pinnacle of the Temple. His account of it\nbegins thus :\nSo saying, he [Satan] caught him up, and, without wing\nOf hippogrif, bore through the air sitblime,\nOver the wilderness and o'er the plain ;\nTill underneath them fair Jerusalem,\nThe holy city, lifted high her towers,\nAnd higher yet the glorious temple rear'd\n'\nHer pile, far off appearing like a mount\nOf alabaster, topt with golden spires :\nThere on the highest 'pinnacle, he set\nThe Son of God.\nThough the meaning of \" the topmost pinnacle \" and\nof \" the highest pinnacle \" is exactly the same, the verbal\ncoincidence is not exact ; and it might be urged that,\nthough \" the bottomless abyss \" in C is suggestive of\nMilton's phraseology, the coincidence is too slight to\nwarrant the script's \" the topmost pinnacle \" being attri-\nbuted to a reminiscence of this passage in Paradise\nRegained. I should not quarrel with that objection ;\nbut I will ask the reader to suspend judgement on the\npoint till later, and meanwhile to turn to Scripts D and E,\n\f102] The Mnsfer Builder 485\nD contains tiae first and only mention by name of\nOedipus in all Mrs. Salter's scripts, while E contains the\nfirst mention of Oedipus in all Mrs. King's scripts.\nSixteen days separate the two \" Oedipus \" scripts, which\nwere written on Dec. 5 and Dec. 21, 1918, respectively.^\nI have no explanation to offer of the phrases in D\nthat follow \" the master builder,\" viz. :\nthe doorway of the mind\u2014open or shut\u2014before the\nthreshold\u2014the watcher at the gate.\nIn Oedipus Tyrannus 391 the Sphinx is called '\/ \/'u\\|\/w^09\nlamv (literally, the song-recitiiag dog) ; and Jebb renders\nthese words by \" the Watcher who wove dark song,\"\nexplaining in a footnote that the Sphinx is called Kvm'\nas being \" the watchful agent of Hera's wrath.\" But,\nso far as I know, no version of the story represents\nthe Sphinx as keeping watch before the gate, or gates,\nof Thebes ; and my instinct is to see no allusion to\nthe Sphinx in \" the watcher at the gate.\" Nor do I\nbelieve that \" the doorway of the mind\u2014open or shut\n\"\nhas anything to do with \" the younger generation\n\"\nknocking at Solness's shut door, or to Hilda's urging\nhim to open it.\n1 In November, 1918, there had been published in the Proceedings\na paper of mine called Fresh Light on the '\nOne-Horse Dawn '\nExixri-\nment, in which a good deal is said about the death of Oedipus at\nColonus. Mrs. Salter, in her capacity of Editor of Proceedings, had\nread this paper in MS. or proof at least as early as February or March,\n1918. If Mrs. King read it on its publication in November, 1918,\nthen possibly the emergence of the references to Oedipus in D and E\nmay have been facilitated by both automatists' having read the paper.\nIt contains two passing and absolutely imimportant allusions to the\nguessing of the riddle of the Sphinx by Oedipus : one being the motto\nprefixed to the paper, Kairoi to 7' aLviy\/x ovx'l tovttl'ji\/to's fiv |\ndvSpos Otei-rray\n(which Mrs. King would not have understood, as she does not\nknow Greek) ; the other being a quotation from Mr. Bayfield's Memoir\nof A. W. Verrall in which he speaks of Dr. Verrall's \" more than\nOedipodean acuteness as a solver of riddles.\" Beyond these two\nincidental allusions, there was nothing in the paper to draw attention\nto this incident in Oedipus' early life, its interest, on the contrary,\ncentring roimd his death in old age.\n2l\n\f486 J.

In\nMet. XV. 429 (regarded, by the way, as spurious by\nsome editors), Thebes is called Oedipodean, \" Oedipodoniae\nThebae \"\u2014a decorative epithet comparable to Constan-\ntinian York, or Godiva's Coventry, or King Alfred's\ncity of Winchester. In I. Tristia 1. 114 Ovid calls\ncertain of his poetical works \" Oedipuses,\" because they\nbrought misfortune and ruin upon the author of their\nbeing as Oedipus broiight destruction upon his own\nfather. Neither of these instances can be properly\ncalled a \" reference to Oedipus.\" The only personal\nreference to Oedipus that I can trace in Ovid is the\nfollowing one in Met. VII. 759-761 :\nCarmina Laiades non intellecta priorum\nSolverat ingeniis, et praecipitata iacebat\nImmemor ambagum vates obscura suarum.\n(\" The son of Laius had solved the riddle which had\nbeen inscrutable to the understanding of all before ;\nfaUen headlong she lay, the dark prophet, forgetful of\nher own riddle.\"\u2014F.

Miller's translation.)\nNot another word is said in the context about Laiades\n\u2014i.e. Oedipus, the son of Laius ; the reference to his\nguessing the riddle of the Sphinx and to the Sphinx's\nself-destruction serving merely to mark the approximate\ndate of a particular incident (the pursuit of another\nmonster that was terrorizing Thebes) in a very long\nand dull story about a dull person called Cephalus.\nIt is as if an English writer were to indicate the date\nof an event by sayuig that it took place some time after\nKing Alfred had burnt the cakes.\nAlthough, like Lord BoHngbroke, \" I approve the\ndevotion of a studious man at Christ Church, who was\noverheard in his oratory entering into a detail with\nGod, and acknowledging the divine goodness in furnishing\nthe world with makers of dictionaries,\" I know the\nfallibility of compilers too well to place complete faith\nin any index or concordance.

VII. 759-761, it corresponds with \"a\nking's son\u2014known of old\u2014Oedipus\u2014the riddle \" in\nScript D of sixteen days earlier. The coincidence between\nthe two scripts, moreover, is of a rather subtle kind ;\nfor Mrs. Salter's script, before giving the name \" Oedipus,\"\nfirst alludes to him as \"a king's son\u2014known of old \" :\na form of allusion that corresponds neatly with Ovid's\nway of designating Oedipus as \" Laiades,\" i.e. the son\nof Laius (king of Thebes).\nWhile, however, Mrs. Salter's script refers only to the\nguessing of the Sphinx's riddle by Oedipus, Mrs. King's\nscript goes a step further, for the \" reference to Oedipus\nin Ovid \" involves a reference also to the Sphinx's head-\nlong fall.\nAs already mentioned, I was not inclined to take the\ninjunction in Script E to \" verify reference to OEdipus\nin Ovid \" seriously. It had such an apocryphal smack\nabout it that when, as often happened, I came across\nit in looking through Mrs. King's scripts, it was apt to\nmake me smile. What eventually led me to pay serious\nattention to it was this : In December, 1926, I was\nconsidering the three alKisions in Mrs. Salter's scripts\nto the master builder \" and their contexts. After\nreading Ibsen's play it was obvious to me that there\nwas a sort of parallel between the devil setting Christ\non a pinnacle of the Temple and Hilda half goading,\nhalf coaxing Solness to climb to the top of the tower ;\nbut I was puzzled by the want of a parallel with the\nMaster Builder's fall from the tower, and also by the\nrepetition of the unbiblical phrase \" the topmost pinnacle.\"\nIt occurred to me to look up Milton's account of the\n\f102] The Master Builder 489\nTemptation in Paradise Regained. This at once gave\na satisfactory explanation of \" the topmost pinnacle,\"\nsince, as we have seen, Milton makes Satan place Christ\non \"the highest pimiacle.\"' Then, as I read on, I foimd\nthat IVIilton furnishes a parallel to the Master Builder's\nfall, for, departing from the Biblical story, he makes\nSatan, when Christ has refused to cast himself down, fall\nhimself :\nThere, on the highest pinnacle, he set\nThe Son of God ; and added thus in scorn :\nThere stand, if thou wilt stand ; to stand upright\nWill ask thee skill : I to thy Father's house\nHave brought thee, and highest placed : highest is best :\nNow show thy progeny ; if not to stand.\nCast thyself down ;\nsafely, if Son of God :\nFor it is written,\u2014He will give command\nConcernmg thee to his angels : in their hands\nThey shall iiplift thee, lest at any time\nThou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.\nTo whom thus Jesus : Also it is written,\nTempt not the Lord thy God. He said, and stood :\nBut Satan, smitten with amazement, fell.\nFortunately, I read on a little further still, and so\nfound the explanation of the reference in Mrs. Salter's\nScript D to Oedipus and the Sphinx's riddle, which there\nfollows \" the master builder.\" Immediately after the\nline\nBut Satan, smitten with amazement, fell,\nMilton compares Satan's fall to the many falls which\nHeracles inflicted on the giant Antaeus before he finally\novercame him ; and he then goes on to compare Satan's\nto another legendary fall :\nSo, after many a foil, the tempter proud,\nRenewing fresh assaults amidst his pride.\nFell whence he stood to see his victor fall :\nAnd as that Theban monster, that proposed\nHer riddle, and him who solved it not devour'd ;\n\f490 J. G. Piddington [PART\nThat once found out and solved, for grief and spite\nCast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep :\nSo struck with dread and anguish, fell the fiend.\nAlthough the reference in Script D is merely to the\nguessing of the riddle and not to its effect upon the\nSphinx, I felt certain that behind Scripts C and D (both\n\" master builder \" scripts) lay this passage in Paradise\nRegained.\nSome time later it occurred to me that Mrs. King's\n\" verify reference to Qildipus in Ovid \" might be con-\nnected with Mrs. Salter's \" Oedipus\u2014the riddle.\" After\nnoticing how near in date these two \" Oedipus \" references\nare, and having ascertained that neither automatist had\never mentioned Oedipus by name previously, I thought\nI would look up a passage in the Purgatorio where, as\nI vaguely remembered, Dante, misled by a corruption in\nthe text of Ovid, speaks of the Naiades (instead of\nLaiades, i.e. Oedipus) as expounders of riddles. Dante\nsays nothing about the Sphinx casting herseK from her\nrock ;\nbut, as I found on looking it up, the original\npassage in Ovid to which Dante is referring (it is the one\nquoted on p. 487 above), contributes the precise point\n\u2014\nnamely, the fall of the Sphinx\u2014wliich was wanted to\nclinch the allusion to the lines in Paradise Regained. So\nfar, so good ;\nyet it did not seem likely a priori that\nthere would be any justification for fixing on this par-\nticular passage in Ovid as the one meant by Mrs. King's\nscript. StUl I thought I ought to see what the references\nto Oedipus in Ovid were, and accordingly looked them\nup ; and so found to my considerable surprise that there\nappears to be but one personal reference to Oedipus, and\nthat one of a character to produce what seems to me to\nbe a remarkably well-designed cross-correspondence be-\ntween Mrs. King's single script and Mrs. Salter's three\nscripts.\n1 \" And perchance my [Beatrice's] prophecy, obscure as Themis and\nSphinx, dotli less persuade thee, because after their fashion it darkens\nthy mind ; but soon the facts shall be the Naiades that will solve this\nhard riddle\" [Purgatorio XXXIII. 46-50).\n\f102] The Master Builder 491\nSo far as I am aware, Mrs. Salter's scripts contain no\nother at any rate certaia references to Ibsen's Master\nBuilder than those already mentioned, unless\nStanding alone the highest pinnacle\nin Script H be so accounted. These words may perhaps\nbe applied to the Master Builder standing alone on the\ntop of his tower ; but more probably they refer to Christ,\nas conceived by Milton, standing alone on the highest\npinnacle of the Temple. \" Standing alone \" sviits well\nMilton's \" There stand, if thou wilt stand ; to stand\nupright will ask thee skiU ... if not to stand. Cast\nthyself down . . . He said, and stood ; and furthermore\nhere for the first time, in place of the previous \" the\ntopmost pinnacle,\" appear the actual words used by\njVIilton, \" the highest pinnacle.\"\nThe only other automatist besides Mrs. Salter whose\nscript contains references to Ibsen's Master Builder is\nMrs. King ; and her references, so far as I know, are\nall subsequent to Mrs. Salter's (unless script H be taken\nto refer to Ibsen's play). Not that this in the least de-\nprives them of their mterest, for Mrs. King knew nothing\nwhatsoever about Mrs. Salter's references to The Master\nBuilder. Though Mrs. King's references do not fall within\nthe artificially prescribed time-limits of the cross-corre-\nspondence, they are of too great interest, when compared\nwith Mrs. Salter's, to be passed over in silence. To\nthe best of my loiowledge, there are altogether four of\nthem, and three out of the four are effected by means\nof the same quotation from Ibsen's play. I propose\nto deal with the first three only, which will be found\nin Scripts G, I, and J. Common to G and I are the\nwords, \" The harps in the air.\" \" Harps in the air \" is a\nquotation from The Master Builder ; and if some one had\nwanted to pick ovit a single phrase from Ibsen's play\nwhich would bring together the two events ui the life of\n\f492 J.

Here\nis part of the dialogue between her and Solness :\nHilda.\nOh, it was so gloriously thrilling ! I could not have believed\nthere was such a builder in the whole world that could build\nsuch a tremendously high tower.

The reference is pretty certainly either to\nCatullus LXI., the Epithalamium of Junia and Manlius,\n\f494 J. G. Piddingtoyi [PART\nor to CatuUuvS LXII., generally known as the Epithala-\nfnium Catulli. In both poems the mvocation to Hymen\n\u2014\n\" 0 Hymenaee Hymen, Hymen 0 Hymenaee, lo Hymen\nHymenaee io,\" \" Hymen o Hymenaee,\" and so on in\nslightly variant forms\u2014recurs again and again. This\ncurious coincidence between Mrs. Salter's Script C and\nMrs. King's Script G is the sort of coincidence that\napparently some people are light-heartedly prepared to\nattribute with confidence to chance.\nIn Script I \" the harps in the air \" is preceded by\n\" Held above the floods,\" which a few weeks later re-\nappears, for the only time, in Mrs. King's script J in\nthe form \" held aloft above the flood.\" If we assume\nthese two very similar phrases to be a connecting link\nbetween Scripts I and J, we get the following text from\na union of the two :\nHeld above the floods . . . The song is sung far\nabove\u2014 The harps in the air ...\nThe cornerstone of the building is set ... I see a\nkind of trophj'^ with a stick and a wreath twisting round\nit. It stands for some kind of triumph, held aloft above\nthe flood.\nWith the trophy and the wreath on the stick we may\ncompare the wreath that Solness hangs on the top of\nthe two towers. \" The song is sung far above \" is the\nsong that both at Lysanger and ten years later Hilda\nimagines that she hears Solness singing on the top of\nthe tower. Besides the cjuotation from Ibsen's play\nalready given on p. 492 above, compare the following\nsentences all spoken by Hilda :\n\" That was the song that I heard through the air !\n\"\n\" Now I see you again as I did when there was song\nin the air.\"\n\" Then do you hear no song in the air, either ? . . .\n\/ hear a song\u2014a mighty song !\n\"\n\" The cornerstone of the building is set \" in J suggests\nthe ceremonial laying of the foundation-stone of a\nbuilding, and so can hardly apply to the completion of\n\f102] The Master Builder 495\nthe Church Tower or of the house-tower m Ibsen's play ;\nbut it may be mtended to suggest '^a ceremony connected\nwith building, and so either or both of the two ceremonies\nperformed by Solness. In any case, it should be compared\nwith \" the cornerstone of the builders \" m A, and with\n\" the master builder the cornerstone\u2014the church tower\n\"\nin F.\nIt is unlikely that a reason for such a conjunction\nof topics as the Master Builder and \" Hymen Hymenace \"\nin C, or of the Master Builder and \" Epithalamium \" in G,\nwill be discoverable by comparing Ibsen's play with\nCatullus', or any one else's, Epithalamium. |^But this\nis not so with the conjunction of the Master Builder\nwith the Temptation scene in Paradise Regained, for\nobviously a fall from a great height is common to both.\nBut the parallelism, I believe, goes deeper than that :\nfor, in the first place, as I will show in detail presently,\nIbsen's Master Builder Solness, like Milton's Satan, is\na defier of God ;\nand, ui the second place, Solness, like\nMilton's Mammon, is a builder of High Towers, and in\nMrs. Salter's scripts Milton's Mammon is identified with\nLucifer whom Milton identifies with Satan. The evidence\nfor these two identifications will be found in Appendix C\n(pp. 502-505 below).\nIn calling Master Builder Solness a builder of High\nTowers I am not thinking only of the \" tremendously\nhigh \" Church Tower at Lysanger and of the High Tower\nof his own house, but of certain passages in the play\nwhere his tower-building is stressed. Thus Hilda says\nto Solness : \"I thought, if you could build the highest\nchurch-towers in the world, you could sui'ely manage\nto raise a kingdom of one sort or another as well \"\n;\nand when Solness mentions that he has built a tremendous\nlot of late years, and Hilda asks, \" Many church-towers\namong the rest ? Immensely high ones ?\n\" his answer,\n\" No. I buUd no more church-towers now,\" implies\nthat he had built them in the past. Then, later on,\nwhen he explains that he now builds only \" homes for\nhuman beings,\" and Hilda asks \" But homes with high\n\f496 J. G. Piddington [PART\ntowers and pinnacles npon them ? \", he answers \" If\npossible.\" Finally, Solness announces his intention of\ngiving up the building of homes for human beings in\norder that he may build a Royal Castle \" to pleasure the\nprincess he loved,\" an ideal castle in the air with a\nhigh tower.\nOf Mammon, architect and builder of Pandaemonium\n\u2014\nwhom Mrs. Salter's scripts identify with Lucifer\u2014Milton\nsays :\nhis hand was known\nIn heaven by many a tower d structure high,\nWhere sceptred angels held their residence,\nAnd sat as princes ...\nNor was his name unheard or unadored\nIn ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land\nMen called him Mulciber ; and how he feU\nFrom heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove\nSheer o'er the crystal battlements . . .\n. thus they relate\nErring ; for he with this rebeUious rout\nFell long before ; nor aught avail'd him now\nTo have built in heaven high towers ; nor did he 'scape\nBy all his engines ; but was headlong sent\nWitli his industrious crew to build in hell.\nI will now give the evidence for the statement made\nabove that Ibsen's Master Builder Solness resembles\nMilton's Satan in that he is a defier of God. In the\nthird Act Solness tells Hilda that he is afraid of retribution,\nand then proceeds to explain why. He came, he saj'S,\nfrom a pious home, and as a young man it seemed to\nhim that the noblest task he could set himself to was\nthat of building churches to the glory of God. So\nhe began his career as a church-builder, and worked with\nsuch devotion that he felt that God ought to be pleased\nwith him. Yet he knew instinctively that He was not ;\nfor it was God who had brought about the burning of\nhis old home, and the death of his two children, hi order\n\f102] The Master Builder 497\nto turn him into a perfect master of liis craft with\nthe skill to erect still more glorious churches in God's\nhonour. This view of God's dealings with him had\nflashed upon him when he was building the church at\nLysanger. He then had realised for the first time how\nGod meant him to go through life without love or happi-\nness, a mere Master Builder building churches for God.\nIn bitter revolt he plucked up courage to \"do the\nimpossible,\" climbed to the top of the Church Tower,\nand there, as he was hanging the wreath over the vane,\nhe thus, as he tells Hilda, set God at defiance :\nHear me now, thou Mighty One ! From this day\nforward I will be a free builder\u2014I too in my sphere\n\u2014\njust as thou in thine. I will never build more churches\nfor thee\u2014only homes for human beings.\nAt this point in his account of his inner life Hilda\nbreaks in with\nThat was the song that I heard through the air !\nNevertheless, building homes for human beings, Solness\ngoes on to confess, brought him no more contentment\nthan building churches ; and so, as he tells Hilda, from\nnow on he is going to build only Castles in the air ;\nand, when he is at the top of the tower of his new\nhouse, he is going to notify God of his new resolve :\nI will say to him ; Hear me, Mighty Lord\u2014thou\nmay'st judge me as seems best to thee. But hereafter\nI wiU build nothing but the loveliest thing in the world\n. . . build it together with a princess, whom I love . . .\nAnd then I Avill say to him : Now I shaU go down and\nthrow my arms round her and kiss her . . . Then I\nwill wave my hat^\u2014and come down to the earth\u2014and\ndo as I said to him.\nHere Hilda exclaims :\nNow I see you again as I did when there was song\nin the air.\nTo the Master Builder's strife with God there is one\nmore allusion near the end of the play. When Solness\n\f498 J. G. Piddington [PART\nis standing at the top of the house-tower, the following\ndialogue is exchanged between Ragnar (a draughtsman\nemployed by iSolness) and Hilda :\nRagnak.\nI feel as if I were looking at something utterly impossible.\nHilda.\nYes, it is tfi,e impossible that he is doing now. [With the\nindefinable expression in her eyes.] Can you see any one else\nup there with him ?\nRagnae.\nThere is no one else.\nHilda.\nYes, there is one he is striving with.\nRagnab.\nYou are mistaken.\nHilda.\nThen, do you hear no song in the air, either ?\nRagnar.\nIt must 1)0 the wind in the tree-tops.\nHilda.\n\/ hear a song\u2014a mighty song.\nThe song in the air that sounded like harps is, it\nshould be observed, each time associated with Solness's\ndefiance of God.\nIt would be superfluous to illustrate at length the\nMiltonic Satan's defiance of God ; but one passage may\nbe cited, as it is perhaps reflected in Script C in the\nwords \" the bottomless abyss\u2014depths unplumbed\u2014down\ndown down \" :\nHim the Almighty Power\nHurl'd headlong flaming from the ethereal sky\nWith hideous ruin and combustion, down\n\f102] The Master Builder 499\nTo bottomless perdition, there to dwell\nIn adamantine chains and penal fire,\nWho dm-st defy the Omnipotent iii arms.\n{Par.

Reg. II. 358-361.)\nIt may, I think, be fairly claimed that \" the harps\nin the aii' \" of ]Mrs. King's scripts involves reference to\nSolness's ascent of the Church Tower, his ascent of and\nfall from the tower of his own house, and his strife\nwith God. And these are the very points in Ibsen's\nplay to which Mrs. Salter's scripts allude. But Mrs.\nSalter's scripts imply a parallel, not implied in any\nscript of ]\\Irs. King's so far discussed, between the Master\nBuilder's and Satan's spirit of revolt. An attempt to\nsupply the deficiency, how'ever, is perhaps traceable in\na script of Mrs. King's of which hitherto no mention\nhas been made. This particular script, it so happens,\ncontains the third and last reference to Oedipus in all\nher scripts,^ and runs thus :\nKing 509 {Aug. 12, 1920).\nKeep (Edipus in mind, new references to the broken\ncolumns fortuitous.

Mrs. King saw the play per-\nformed in 1893 ; Mrs. Salter about 1912 or 1913.\nMrs. King has read no Ovid.\nMrs. Salter has no recollection of ever having read the\npassage in Ovid, 3Iet. VII. 759-761 (\" Carmina Laiades,\"\netc.). She writes on March 17, 1927 : 'I read a certain\namount of Ovid, of course, in my school-room and college\ndays, and cannot be certain that my eye has never fallen\non that particular passage. But, as I say, I have no\nrecollection of it.\"\nIn December, 1926, withovit giving any hint of my\nreasons for doing so, I read to Mrs. King Purgatorio\nXXXIII., 46-50 (see p. 490 above), where Dante alludes\nto Ovid, Met. VII., 759-761, and asked her if she knew\nthe passage. I did this because I thought it just con-\nceivable that, if she had read the Dante passage in an\nannotated edition of the Purgatorio, she might from the\nnotes ad loc. have learnt about the Ovid passage. She\nassured me that, to the best of her knowledge and belief,\nshe had never read the lines in the Purgatorio ; and she\nhadn't the sliglitest idea of what Dante meant by \" the\nfacts shall be the Naiades that will solve this hard\nriddle.\"\nIn March, 1927, Mrs. Salter, at my request, looked\nup the passage in the Purgatorio. After doing so, she\nwrote to say that she had no recollection of ever having\nread it before, and added :\n'\" My knowledge of Dante is\n\f102] The Master Builder 501\nvery slight, as I decided many years ago that, however\ngreat a poet he might be, he was not my man !\n\"\nIn December, 1926, without explaining why, I read to\nMrs. King the following lines in Paradise Regained apart\nfrom their context :\nAnd as that Theban monster, that proposed\nHer riddle, and him who solved it not devour'd ;\nThat once found out and solved, for grief and spite\nCast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep,\nand asked her if she recognised them, if she understood\nthe reference generally, and if in particular she knew\nwho was meant by \" that Theban monster.\" Her answer\nto all three questions was \" No.\" When I told her the\nsource of the lines, she said that, though she has read\nbits of Paradise Regained, she believes she has never read\nit through.\nMrs. Salter has read Paradise Regained more than once.\nBoth automatists inform me that they had never heard\nof a parallel being drawn between Milton's Satan and\nIbsen's Master Builder Solness.\nWhen, in December, 1926, I told Mrs. King about the\ncross-correspondence between her Script E and Mrs. Salter's\nScripts C, D, and F, she said that she felt sure that there\nwere references to the Master Builder in her own scripts\ntoo. This was news to me, so I asked her what they\nwere. She couldn't remember ; and I then asked her\nwhat quotations from the play she remembered best. She\nmentioned the repeated references to \" the younger\ngeneration,\" and Mrs. Solness's nine dolls ; but failed to\nrecall anything else. Some time later, having read\nthe play, I asked her if she remembered \" the harps\nin the air \" coming in her script ;\nand, if so, what\nshe thought it meant. She said she remembered the\nwords perfectly, and associated them with some musical\nphrase, or with a song ; but she could not identify the\nmusical phrase or the song. After an interval, during\nwhich other subjects were talked of, I said to her :\n\" Do you remember me telling you about a cross-corre-\nspondence between you and Mrs. Salter on the subject\n2k\n\f502 J. G.

That is a fair\ndescription of the theme of Tennyson's Ulysses, and it\nis at least a defensible description of the theme of Ibsen's\nMaster Builder. William Archer, in his Introduction to\nthe English translation of the play, records that Ibsen\nwrote in the album of the lady who was \" the principal\nmodel for Hilda \" the following words :\n\" Hohes, schmerzliches Gliick\u2014\n\u2022\num das Unerreichbare zu ringen !\n\"\nThese words he renders \" High, painful happiness\u2014to\nstruggle for the unattainable !\n\" ; and he adds that \" we may,\nif we like, see \" in them \" a foreshadowing of the Solness\nframe of mind.\"\nAPPENDIX C.\nSatan, Lucifer, and Mammon.\n(See p. 495 above.)\nIn Paradise Lost I., 678-751, Milton describes the building\nof Pandaemonium by Mammon and his crew. Mammon,\nthe architect and builder of this palace of Satan, had, he\nexplains, before his fall been\nknown\nIn heaven by many a tower'd structure high\nNor was his name unheard or unadored\n\f102] Tlie Master Builder 503\nIn ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land\nMen called him Mulciber ; and how he fell\nFrom heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove\nSheer o'er the crystal battlements : from morn\nTo noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, . .\nA summer's day ; and with the setting sun\nDropp'd from the zenith like a falling star\nOn Lemnos, the ^gean isle ; thus they relate.\nErring ; for he [i.e. Mammon] with this rebellious rout\nFell long before ; nor aught avail'd him now\nTo have built in heaven high towers ; nor did he 'scape\nBy all his engines ; but was headlong sent\nWith his industrious crew to build in hell.\nThree extracts will suffice to show that Milton's\nMammon-Mulciber is identified in Mrs. Salter's scripts\nwith Lucifer. Thus :\nH.V. 332 {Oct. 17, 1913).\n. . . fallen angels\u2014write that too\u2014from morn to\ndewy eve\u2014a summer's day . . .\nH.V. 458 {Dec. 19, 1915).\n. . . the gates of Hell\u2014 Lucifer son of the morning\n\u2014From morn to dewy eve . . .\nH.V. 463 {Feb. 24, 1916).\n. . .

Thus, with\n(1) compare \" Lucifer, son of the morning \" in H.V.\n458 and 463 above.\nWith (2) compare H.V. 573 of Sept. 2, 1922 :\nThe brighter star than all One star To climb the\nheavens [cf.

Some of the points in Milton's description of\nMammon in Book I. of Par. Lost are admittedly borrowed\nfrom Spenser's description of Mammon in Book II., Canto\nVII., of the Faery Queen. In Par. Regained (II. 406-486)\nMilton, departing from the Biblical accounts, represents\nSatan as tempting Christ with an offer of riches ; and\nseveral of the commentators point out that the speech in\nwhich the offer is made is more or less reminiscent of\nthe one put by Spenser into the mouth of Mammon when\nhe places all his riches at Sir Guyon's disposal on condi-\ntion that the knight serve and follow him. In Par.\nRegained (IV. 536) Satan refers to Christ's rejection of his\nproffer of riches immediately before he carries Him up to\nthe highest pinnacle of the Temple.\nThe identification, then, of Mulciber-Mammon with\nLucifer in the scripts has some sort of literary warrant.\nAt the same time I see no reason to suppose that any\nattempt has been made in the ' scripts to connect Spenser's\nMammon with Milton's Mammon, or Mammon's temptation\nof Sir Guyon with Satan's temptation of Christ as\nimagined by Milton. All that the scripts do is to associ-\nate together Lucifer and Mulciber-Mammon ; and the\nreason for the association is to be found in the fall which\nboth suffered.\n\f506 Review [PART\nREVIEW.\nThe History of Spirihialism . By Aiithue Conan Doyle.\n2 vols. Pp. 684. Constable. 42s. net.\n\" Spiritualism \" is a very comprehensive term : in this book,\nfor instance, it is necessary for the leader to bear in mind\nthat the anthor uses it in two entirely different senses. All\nwho believe in human survival of bodily death and the possi-\nbility of communication between the dead and the living are\nSpiritualists, but within this larger group there exists an inner\ncircle who base their belief in survival and communication on\na historical series of incidents, alleged to be supernormal, or\nas Sir Arthur Conan Doyle calls them \" preternatural \" ; and\nfor the purposes of this review 1 j^ropose temporarily to borrow\nwith a slight change of sense the French distinction between\n\" Spiritualist \" and \" Spiritist,\" and to apply the latter term to\nthe inner group. It must be emphasised that the distinction\nbetween Spiritualist and Spiritist applies solely to the basis of\nbelief, and does not imply any less degree of conviction in\neither party.\nThe incidents which are the basis of the Spiritist's faith\nbegin with the Hydesville occurrences in 1848, so that the\n\" cult \" (as Sir Arthur terms it) is just eighty years old. It\nis therefore by now well launched on its career, and in view\nof its remarkable growth it was high time that a connected\naccount of the movement should be written by one occupying\nso jDrominent a place in it as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nThe \" cult \" flourishes partly within the older religious bodies\nand partly through sej)arate \" churches \"'\nfounded to jiromote\nit. It has already developed an authoritative canon of miracles\nand martyrs, and the Spiritualist who is rash enough to doubt\nany one item of the canon seems to be regarded with less-\nfavour than the complete unbeliever.\n\f102] Revieiv 507\nTo write a history of Spiritism from within requires a high\ndegree of courage. The miracles of Spiritism, whatever parallels\nthe Spiritist may draw between them and those of older\nrehgions, have this pecuharity that they owe nothing to any\nsuperior moral quaUties on the part of the persons by or\nthrough whom they were manifested. It is not surprising\ntherefore that earlier Spiritists have shrunk from the task of\nattempting a consecutive history, almost every chapter of\nwhich must contain a regretful reference to some serious\nshortcoming on the part of the particular medium Avhose powers\nare being discussed.\nEarlier histories there have been, notably Podmore's books ;\nbut Podmore was not within the cult, and the mention of him\nin Sir Arthur's Preface is so grossly unfair that a passing\nreference to it must be made. \" IVIi-. Frank Podmore,\" says\nthe Preface, \" brought together a large number of facts, and\nby ignoring those which did not suit his purpose, endeavoured\nto suggest the worthlessness of most of the rest, especially the\nphysical phenomena which in his view were mainly the result\nof fraud.\" This statement can be so easily disproved by\ntaking almost any chapter of Podmore's Modern Spiritualism at\nrandom, that we can only suppose that Sir Arthur's activities\nhave not allowed him time to read that book with the attention\nit deserves.\nThe truth is that Podmore gives infinitely more facts as to\nalmost any medium that can be mentioned than Sir Arthur,\nfacts favourable to the medium's supernormal powers as Avell as\nunfavourable. Even from the purely spiritistic point of view\nPodmore's detailed and documented accounts, say of D. D.\nHome or Stainton Moses, are in every way superior to the few\nsketchy pages Sir Arthur Conan Doyle allots to them, so that\nany Spiritist who wished to explain to an enquner Avith no\nprevious knowledge of the subject why these men made the\nimpression they did would do -well to lend him Modern\nSpiritualism rather than the History of Spiritualism. As to\nHome, Podmore quotes incident after incident which he admits\nhe cannot explain by simple trickery.\nPodmore of coiu-se was very sceptical as to the super-\nnormality of physical phenomena, and it is quite legitimate for\nSir Arthur to contest his conclusions. \"What is not legitimate\n\f^08 Bevieiv [PART\nis for Sir Arthur to charge Podmore^s book as a whole with a\ntendencious selection or supjaression of relevant facts, an\naccusation which can much more justly be brought against\nSir Arthur himself.\nPodmore died some time ago, and since his death there have\nbeen several interesting developments in Psychical Research,\nboth on the physical and mental side. A book that should\ntreat these later developments on the lines on which Podmore\ntreated the earher phenomena is badly needed.\nIt would matter little whether such a book were written\nfrom Podmore's point of view or the opposite, provided it\nconformed to Podmore's standards of fullness and documenta-\ntion. Alike where Sir Arthur covers the same ground as\nPodmore, and where he deals with new matter, he faUs very\nfar short of these standards, and he would have been well\nadvised for his own sake not rashly to have provoked the\ncomparison.\nAs an example let us take the accounts in the two books of\nthe Davenport brothers' performances at Liverpool in 1865.\nAt Liverpool in February two members of the audience\ntied their (i.e. the Davenports') hands so brutally that\n.\nblood flowed, and Mr. Ferguson cut the rope and released\nthem. (Sir Ai-thur Conan Doyle, History of 82nritualism,\nvol. i. p. 229.)\nOn the Committee appointed on the first night were two\ngentlemen who possessed the secret of a special knot,\ncalled the Tom Fool's knot. This knot they apphed to\nthe wrists of the Davenport Brothers. Each jarotested that\nthe knot was unfairly tight and injured the circulation.\nA doctor summoned to the platform gave it as his opinion\nthat no injury to the circulation was to be apprehended,\nand that, in view of the smallness of the mediums' hands,\nthe loiot was not unnecessarily tight. The Davenports\nrefused to proceed with the performance under such con-\nditions, and Ferguson was ordered to cut the knots.\n(Footnote) Liverpool Daily Post, 14th, 15th, 16th Feb. 1865.\nIn the Post of the 23rd Feb. a picture of the baffling knot\nis given. (Podmore, Modern Spiritualism, vol. ii. p. 60.)\n\f102] Revieiv 509\nAfter the lapse of sixty years there may be doubt as to\nexactly what happened in this instance : what is not doubtful\nis that Podmore's narrative carries conviction in a way Sir\nArthur's does not.\nIf Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wishes to discredit Podmore with\nintelligent readers, if he is aiming at anything higher than\npropaganda among the ignorant and uncritical, he must quote\nchapter and verse from contemporary records of eye-witnesses\nto support his version : to show, e.g. that what Podmore says\nas to the medical examination is unfounded.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle's treatment of this incident is highly\ninstructive. No sane person presumably would nowadays base\nhis faith in a future existence on the exact natiu-e of knots\ntied in the year 1865 round the wrists of two men who at the\ntime made no claim to assistance from the spirit world in their\njierformances (vol. i. p. 234). But notwithstanding their own\nambiguous attitude to the cult the Davenports have by now\nbeen completely canonized. It is no longer necessary to defend\nthem : it is sufficient to talk of \" brutal opposition and even\npersecution \" without going too closely into the facts. But\nthere are other mediums, who seem not yet to have attained\nthat fortunate state, for whose apparent lapses excuses have to\nbe offered : e.g. the wandering hmb foimd moving the furniture\nwas \" ectoplasmic \" (vol. i. p. 306, and Index) : alternatively\nevil spirits made the medium cheat for a joke (vol. i. p. 75 ;\nii. p. 208) : in the further alternative persons of otherwise good\ncredit and character conspired to \" frame up \" an exjjosure\n{vide sub EgUnton and the Crewe Circle). With these, and\ndoubtless other, Unes of defence to fall back on there is not\nmuch in Sir Arthur's claim that in the course of a long career as\nan investigator he camiot recall one smgle instance where it was\nclearly shown that he had been mistaken upon any serious point,\nor had given a certificate of honesty to a performance which was\nalterwards clearly proved to be dishonest !\n\" \" Clearly shown \"\nand \"clearly proved\" to whom? To Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?\nThis claim follows very shortly after the author's account of\na sitting in Australia with Bailey, the apport medium, who\nproduced a small bird's nest with a white egg in it, stated by\nthe Hindoo \" control,\" to be the nest and egg of the Indian\nJungle Sparrow.\n\f510 Review [PART\nThe medium, or rather the Hindoo control acting through\nthe medium, placed the egg on his palm and broke it,\nsome fine white albumen squirting out. There was no\ntrace of yolk. \" We are not allowed to interfere with\nlife,\" said he. \"If it had been fertilised we could not\nhave taken it.\"' . . . Surely it is a fair argument that\nwhile it is conceivable that such birds might be imported\nand ]5urchased here, it is really an insult to one's reason\nto suppose that nests with fresh eggs (italics ours) in them\ncould also be on the market.\nIt is really an insult to the reader's reason to suppose that\nhe is incapable of seeing that by breaking the egg in this way\nthe medium (or the control, if that is preferred) made it\nimpossible either to identify the egg as being that of any\nparticular species, or to form any opinion as to its freshness.\nMoreover the reason given for breaking it is absurd : eggs can\neasily be tested for fertility without breaking them, and this is\nin fact done on an average several thousand times a day in\nthis country alone.\nWe are sure that, if no question of Spiritism were involved,\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle would be the first to reahse the worth-\nlessness of this incident as evidence of anything except the\nduplicity of the medium, whom Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself\ncaught Ij^ing on another occasion.\nThe \\\\'hole attitude of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to what are\ncalled \" the physical phenomena of spiritualism \" presents a\ncurious psychological puzzle. He regards them as of a com-\nparatively low order, speaks of the lowly and occasionally\nsordid atmosphere \" surrounding them, and very candidly notes\nthe moral shortcomings of several of the mediums producing\nthem. He recognises that the type of phenomena to the study\nof which the S.P.R. has devoted much attention, the trance\nutterances of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Leonard, the cross-corre-\nspondences, etc., are (assuming their supernormahty) of far\ngreater value and imj^ortance. But while these may be freely\ncriticised without arousing his indignation, any criticism of the\nphysical johenomena is rigidly taboo. What is the cause of\nthis anomalous attitude ?\nMainly, we think, a historical one. It was not on cross-\n\f102] Review 511\ncorrespondences or an3rthing of a like nature that the \" cult\n\"\nwas founded, but on raps, levitations, materialisations, and so\non. Criticise these and you undermine, not the basis for the\nbelief in survival, but the basis on which rests the actual\n'structure of Spiritism as an organised cult.\nIn the second place we have to reckon with the repugnance,\nwhich the Spiritist shares with those Psychical Researchers most\nopposed to survival, to admit the full reahty of anything not\nperceptible to the five senses. This it is Avhich lies at the root\nof the French division of psychical phenomena into \" objec-\ntive \" and \" subjective.\" Thoughts and ideas are merely\n\" subjective \" : ectoplasm is the real thing : you can see^\ntouch, smell it (if the resemblance to the entrails of a not\nvery recently slaughtered animal does not offend your senses) ;\n\" it mtist be supernormal,\" says the metapsychisfc : \"it tmisi\ncome from the Spirit world,\" adds the Spiritist.\nIf Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had called his book \" The\nMythology of Spiritism,\" there would be little cause for com-\nplaint. The adherents of every cult must be allowed a fairly\nwide choice of myths, and if the Spiritists experience a par-\nticular devotion to the Davenport brothers or Mr. Bailey's eggs,\nthat is primarily their concern. But such illustrations as those\nfacing vol. i. p. 244 and vol. ii. p. 108, are altogether out of\nplace in any work claiming the title \" History.\" In the latter\nillustration Prof. Richet, Count de Gramont, Dr. Geley and the\nmedium Kluski are shown seated at a table, at one end of\nwhich stands a majestic spnit-form, pointing triumphantly to\ntwo paraffin moulds, while Prof. Richet gazes with rapture at\nhim. Considering that Prof. Richet has never accepted the\nspiritistic hypothesis in any shape, to describe this picture as\n\" an ideahsed non-evidential impression \" hardly seems to do\njustice to its supreme absurdity.\nIn conclusion it may be well to contradict a few incorrect\nstatements of Sn Arthur Conan Doyle about our Society and\nsome of our prominent members, before they become finally\nincorporated in the spu-itist mythology.\n(1)\n'\u2022\nSpirituahsts and particularly mediums, look upon the\ninvestigators \" {i.e. of the S.P.R.) \" and their methods with\naversion \" (vol. ii. p. 86).

Proceedings for the last, say, ten or\ntwenty or thirty years does not suggest that the Society is or\never was dominated by persons hostile to evidence of the\nsupernormal in general, or evidence for survival in particular.\n(3)\n\" The report \" {i.e. on Eva C.) . . .\n\" is a contradictory\ndocument, for whereas the casual reader would gather from it\nthat no results\u2014or none worth recording\u2014were obtained . . .\nDr. Geley pubhshed an incisive paper in the \" Proceedings \" of\nthe Institut Metapsychique in which he exposed the fallacies of\nthe investigation and the worthlessness of the rejaort \" (vol. ii.\np. 87). Our Proceedings are not meant for \" casual readers,\"\nalthough apparently they found one in Dr. Geley ; it is a poor\nservice to his memory to recall attention to his \" incisive\npaper,\" which was not one of his happiest efforts. The Com-\nmittee's Report, which was scrupulously fair, was warmly\npraised by Monsieur Sage, whom Sir Arthur elsewhere quotes\nwith approval.\n(4)\n\" The whole history of this case \" (i.e. Mr. Price's ex-\nposure of Hope) \" and the refusal of the Society to face the\nfacts when they were pointed out to them, leave a shadow on\nthe record of all concerned.\" (Same page.) The \" all con-\ncerned \" include several prominent spirituahsts, such as Sir\nOHver Lodge, to whom Sir Arthur dedicates his book, and who\n\u2022expressly endorsed the Society's action. As to \" the facts\n\"\npointed out to the Society, there were none. Certain infer-\nences were drawn by Mr. Hope's supporters from the facts\nprinted by the S.P.R. and the S.P.R. gave the same pubhcity\nto these inferences (for what they were worth) as was given to\nMr. Price's exposure. Sir Arthur further omits to mention\n(1) that the S.P.R. also offered like pubhcity to any well-\nauthenticated evidence in favour of Hope's supernormal powers,\nand printed the only case submitted which had the shghtest\nevidential value, and (2) that the S.P.R. offered Hope a fresh\n\f102] Review 513\ninvestigation by a Committee to be appointed half by tlie\nS.P.R. and half by Hope himseK, and that Hope backed out\nat the very last moment.\n(5) Concerning the investigation of \" Margery \" by the\nScientific American Committee, \" Dr. Prince was very deaf,\nwhile Dr. M'Dougall was in a position where his whole academic\ncareer would obviously be endangered by the acceptance of an\nunpopular explanation \" (vol. i. p. 341). Dr. Walter Prince\ndoes, we believe, suffer from deafness, but this does not\nprevent his being a finst-class investigator. The insinuation\nagainst Dr. M'Dougall is as absurd as it is disgraceful, having\nregard to the boldness with which he has always championed\nPsychical Research, regardless of the indifference or hostility of\northodox science.\n(6) On pp. 59 and 60 of vol. ii. a long extract is given from\nMr. E. T. Bennett's Twenty Years of Psychical Research (1904)\nin which he comments on the smallness of the results obtained\nin the investigation of physical phenomena. Sir Arthur adds,\n\" These sweeping charges against the Society are made by a\nfriendly critic.\" The passage quoted from Mr. Bennett con-\ntains no charges whatever against the Society, and the context\nmakes it plain that the sole point of Mx. Bennett's remarks\nwas that the investigation of physical phenomena is not as\neasy as it looks.\nIt is only fair to add that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is not\nunreservedly hostile to our Society. He speaks of its \" strangely\nmingled record of usefulness and obstruction,\" and expresses\nthe hope that \" the period of sterility and barren negative\ncriticism may be drawing to an end.\" We must be thankful\nfor small mercies, of course, but the fact that the Society has\ncollected, analysed and pubhshed in large quantities the only\nkind of evidence for survival which appeals to whose who are\nnot prepared to stake their faith in a future life on sparrows'\neggs crushed in the medium's hand, and that the best of this\nevidence has been obtained during the alleged \" period of\nsterility,\" surely calls for a rather more generous tribute from\na leader of \" Spiritualism.\" And if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\nwere more of a Spiritualist and less of a Spiritist such a\ntribute would no doubt be forthcoming.\nW.

CHAFFIN.\nIndex No. G. 293.\nWe are indebted for the following case to one of our\nCanadian members who, having had his attention\ndrawn to it by a newspaper report, instructed a lawyer\nresident in the State (North Carohna), where the\nevents occurred, to investigate the facts on his behalf.\nThe facts had already been put in evidence in a con-\ntested law-suit, so that they have on two occasions\nundergone the scrutiny of persons professionally trained to\nsift and weigh evidence. The lawyer instructed by our\nCanadian member, j\\Ir. J. M'N. Johnson, Attorney-at-Law,\nof Aberdeen, North Carohna, has forwarded to the Society\na very full report including (1) the original newspaper\narticle, (2) official records of the proceedings in the\nSuperior Court of Davie County, N.C., and (3) a sworn\nstatement by ]\\Ir. Johnson as to interviews he had with\nsome of the principal persons in the case, together\nwith sworn statements by two of these jDersons themselves.\nWhat foUows is partly an abstract of these documents,\nand partly quotations from them. The full case can be\nstiidied by those who desire to do so at the Society's\nRooms.\nJames L. Chaffin, the TcvStator, was a farmer in Davie'\nCounty, N.C. He was married and had fom: sons, in\norder of age John A. Chaffin, James Pinkney Chaffin,\nMarshall A. Chaffin, and Abner Columbus Chaffin.\nOn the 16th November, 1905, the Testator made a\nwill, duly attested by two witnesses, whereby he gave his\nfarm to his tliird son, Marshall, whom he appointed sole\nexecutor. The widow and the other three sons were\nleft unprovided for.\nSome years later he appears to have been dissatisfied\n\f518 Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin [part\nwith this disposition of his property, and on tlie 16th\nJanuary, 1919, he made a new will as follows :\nAfter reading the 27th chapter of Genesis, I, James\nL. Chaffin, do make my last wiU and testament, and here\nit is. I want, after giving my body a decent bm-ial,\nmy little property to be equally divided between my\nfour children, if they are living at my death, both personal\nand real estate divided equal if not living, give share to\ntheir children. And if she is living, you all must take\ncare of your mammy. Now this is my last will and\ntestament. Witness my hand and seal.\nJames L. Chaffin,\nThis January 16, 1919.\nThis second will, though unattested, would according to\nthe law of North Carolina, be valid as being written\nthroughout by the Testator's own hand, on sufficient\nevidence being adduced that it was in fact in his hand-\nwriting.\nThe Testator, having written out this will, placed it\nbetween two pages of an old family Bible, formerly\nbelonging to his father, the Rev. Nathan S. Chaffin,\nfolding the pages over so as to make a sort of pocket.\nThe pages so folded were those containing the 27th\nChapter of Genesis, which tells how the younger brother\nJacob supplanted the elder brother Esau, and won his\nbirthright and his father's blessing. The sole beneficiary\nunder the first will was, it will be remembered, a younger\nbrother.\nThe Testator never before his death, so far as can be\n\"ascertained, mentioned the existence of this second will to\nanyone, but in the inside pocket of an overcoat belonging\nto him he stitched up a roll of paper, on which he had\nwritten the words \" Read the 27th chapter of Genesis in\nmy daddie's old Bible.\"\nOn the 7th September, 1921, the Testator died as the\nresult of a fall. His third son, Marshall, obtained Probate\nof the first will on the 24th September of that year.\nThe mother and the other thi'ee brothers did not contest\nthis will as they knew of no valid reason for doing so.\n\f103] Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin 519\nFrom tliis point it \\A'ill be convenient to follow the\nwords of the sworn statements obtained by Mr. Johnson\non liis visit to the locality on the 21st April, 1927.\nExtract from statement of James Pinkney Chaffin, Testator's\nsecond son.\nIn all my life I never heard my father mention having made\na later wiU than the one dated in 1905. I think it was in June\nof 1925 that I began to have very vivid dreams that my\nfather appeared to me at my bedside but made no verbal\ncommunication. Some time later, I think it was the latter\npart of June, 1925, he appeared at my bedside again,\ndressed as I had often seen him dressed in life, wearing a\nblack overcoat which I knew to be his own coat. This\ntime my father's spirit spoke to me, he took hold of his\novercoat this way and pulled it back and said,\n\"'\nYou\nwill find my will m my overcoat pocket,\" and then\ndisappeared. The next morning I arose fuUy convmced\nthat my father's spirit had visited me for the purpose\nof explaming some mistake. I went to mother's and\nsought for the overcoat but found that it was gone.\nMother stated that she had given the overcoat to my\nbrother John who lives in Yadkin County about twenty\nmiles northwest of my home. I think it was on the 6th\nof July, which was on Monday following the events stated\nin the last paragraph I went to my brother's home in\nYadkin County and found the coat. On examination of\nthe inside pocket I found that the Immg had been se^d\ntogether. I immediately cut the stitches and found a\nhttle roU of paper tied with a string which was in my\nfather's handwiting and contamed only the following-\nwords :\n'\nRead the 27th chapter of Genesis m my daddie's\nold Bible.'\nAt this pomt I was so convinced that the mystery\nwas to be cleared up I was unwilling to go to mother's\nhome to examme the old Bible without the presence of\na witness and I induced a neighbour, Mr. Thos. Black-\nwelder to accompany me, also my daughter and Mr.\nBlackwelder's daughter were present. Arriving at mother's\nhome we had a considerable search before we found the\n\f520 Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin [part\nold Bible. At last we did find it in the top bureau drawer\nin an upstairs room. The book was so dilapidated that\nwhen we took it out it fell into three pieces. Mr. Black-\nwelder picked up the portion containing the Book of\nGenesis and turned the leaves until he came to the 27th\nchapter of Genesis and there we found two leaves folded\ntogether, the left hand page folded to the right and the\nright hand page folded to the left forming a pocket and\nin this pocket Mr. Blackwelder found the wiU which has\nbeen probated. [i.e. was probated in December, 1925.]\nDuring the month of December, 1925, my father again\nappeared to me about a week before the trial of the case of\nChaffin vs. Chaffin and said '\nWhere is my old will,' and\nshowed considerable temper. I believe from this that I\nwould win the lawsuit as I did. I told my lawyer about\nthis visitation the next morning.\nMany of my friends do not believe it is possible for\nthe living to hold communication with the dead but I\nam convinced that my father actually appeared to me on\nthese several occasions and I shall believe it to the day\nof my death.\nStatement of the said Thos. A. Blackwelder:\nMy name is Thomas A. Blackwelder. I am 38 years\nold and the son of H. H. Blackwelder. My home is on\na farm in CaUihan township about one mile from the\nplace where Jas. L. Chaffin died in 1921. I think it was\non July 6, 1925, that Mr. J. P. Chaffin, the son of Jas. L.\nChaffin and a neighboiu- of mine came to my house and\nasked me to go with him to his mother's home and at\nthe same time stated that his father had appeared to\nhim in a dream and instructed him how he could find his\nwill. Mr. Chaffin told me at the same time that his\nfather had been dead about four years and had appeared\nto him in a dream and made known to him that he\nshould look in the breastpocket of his old overcoat and\nthere he would find something of importance. Mr.\nChaffin further stated that he had gone to this overcoat\nand had foimd a strip of paper in his father's handwriting\nand he wanted me to go with him to his mother's and\n\f103] Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin 521\nexamme the old Bible. I went with him and we made a\nsearch for the Bible and after some time we found it in a\nbureau drawer in the second story of the house. We took\nout the Bible which was quite old and was in three\ndifferent pieces. I took one of the three pieces of the\nbook and Mr. Chaffin took the other two pieces but it\nhappened that the piece I had contained the Book of\nGenesis. I tm-ned the leaves untU I came to the 27th\nchapter and there found two leaves folded inward and there\nwas a paper writing folded in these two leaves which\npurported to be the last will of Jas. L. Chaffin.\nIt appears from Mr. Johnson's own statement that,\nin addition to Mr. J. P. Chaflfin and Mr. Blackwelder,\nMrs. J. P. Chaffin, their fifteen year old daughter, and\nTestator's widow were present when the Bible was found.\nSoon after its discovery, the second will was tendered\nfor Probate. The son, Marshall, who had proved the\nfirst will, had died within a year of his father's death :\nhe left a son, R. M. Chaffin, who was made a defendant\nin the suit to prove the second wiU^ and who, being a\nminor, appeared by his mother as guardian ad litem and\nnext friend.\nThe cause came on for hearing in December, 1925. A\njury was sworn (this usually takes some time in the\nUnited States) and the court then adjourned for lunch.\nWhen the hearing was continued one of the lawyers\narmounced that diiring the interval an amicable adjust-\nment of the issues had been arrived at, and that the new\nwill would be admitted to probate without opposition.\nThe following is taken from an official copy of the minute\nof the Judge presiding :\nJudgement by Consent.\nIn Re Will of J. L. Chaffin Deed.\nNorth Carolina, Davie County. In Superior Coiu't,\nDecember Term, 1925.\nJudgement, Decree :\nThis cause coming on to be heard, and being heard and\nthe following issues having been submitted to the Jury\n'\nIs the paper writing dated January 16th, 1919, and\n\f522 Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin [part\nevery part thereof the last Will and Testament of the\ndeceased\u2014Jas. L. Chaffin ?\n'\nAnswer\u2014' Yes.' -\nAnd the Jury having answered said issue Yes, It is\nnow on motion of E. H. Morris, A. H. Price and J. C.\nBusby, attorneys for the Plaintiffs Ordered, Decreed, and\nAdjudged that the said last Will and Testament of James\nL. Chaffin deceased be recorded in the office of the Clerk\nof the Superior Court of Davie County in the Book of\nWills and that the Will dated November 16th, 1905, and\nprobated on September the 24th, 1921, Will Book No. 2,\nPage 579, purporting to be the Last Will and Testament\nof the deed. James L. Chaffin is hereby cancelled, rescinded,\nannulled and made void.\nWhen the trial commenced, Marshall's widow and son\nhad been prepared to contest the second will. However,\nduring the luncheon interval they were shown the second\nwill. Ten witnesses were prepared to give evidence that\nthe second will was in the Testator's handwriting, and\nthe widow and son themselves seem to have admitted\nthis as soon as they saw it. At any rate they at once\nwithdrew their opposition. The public, which had\ncrowded the court in the hopes of watching a bitter family\nfeud fought out, retired disappointed.\nSo much for the facts stated in the documents. In\nconsidering whether they can be accounted for without\nrecurrence to the supernormal, we must riile out any\nexplanation which presupposes either that the second\nwill was a \"fake,\" or that any of the parties interested\nunder the second will had normal knowledge of its exist-\nence prior to Mr. J. P. Chaffin's and Mr. Blackwelder's\nsearch for the old Bible in July, 1925.\nAs to the hypothesis of a \" fake,\" it is indeed curious\nthat the Testator should have been so anxious to remedy\nthe injustice done by the first will as to make a second\nwill on entirely different lines, and at the same time have\nbeen so remiss in taking precautions during his lifetime\nfor the carrying into effect of his second will. Possibly he\n\f103] Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin 523\nintended to reveal its existence on his death-bed, and the\ncircumstances of his death as the result of an accident\nfrustrated his intention. But the fact that ten witnesses\nwere prepared to swear that the second will was in the\nTestator's handwriting, and that Marshall's widow and\nson, after seeing the document, admitted its genuineness,\nseems decisively to negative any hypothesis of a ''\nfake\n\"\nwill. Moreover, Mr. Johnson, who interviewed and ques-\ntioned IVIr. J. P. Chaffin, his wife, mother and daughter\nin April, 1927, was, to use his own words, \" much im-\npressed with the evident sincerity of these people, who\nhad the appearance of honest, honourable country people,\nin well-to-do circumstances.\"\nMr. Johnson in his statement suggests, only to dismiss,\nanother possible explanation. \" I endeavoured with all\nmy skill and ability by cross-examination and otherwise\nto induce some admission that possibly there was a\nsubconscious knowledge of the Will in the Old Bible, or\nof the paper in the coat pocket, that was brought to the\nfore by the dream : but I utterly failed to shake their\nfaith. The answer was a quiet :\n'\nNay : such an explana-\ntion is impossible. We never heard of the existence of\nthe will till the visitation from my father's spirit.'\n\"\nClearly, they none of them had any conscious recollec-\ntion, at the date of the Testator's death, of any mention\nof a second will, or they would not have allowed the\nfirst will to be proved without opposition. Nor was it a\nmatter which, if once mentioned, they were likely to\nforget, during the short period which intervened between\nthe making of the second will (January, 1919) and the\nTestator's death (September, 1921). The hypothesis\ntherefore of the '\nexterioralisation '\nin the form of a\nvision, of knowledge normally acquired by Mr. J. P.\nChaffin, but only remembered subconsciously, is open to\ngrave objection.\nIt is hard to suggest a satisfactory explanation of the\nfacts on normal lines. If a supernormal explanation be\naccepted, it is to be noted that the present case is of\na comparatively infrequent type, in which more than one\nof the percipient's senses is affected by the phantasm.\n\f524 Case of the \\Vill of James L. Ghaffin [part\nMr. J. P. Chaffin both \" saw \" his father and \" heard \" him\nspeak. The auditory impression was not strictly accurate :\nwhat was in the overcoat pocket was not the second will,\nbut a clue to its whereabouts ; but the practical result was\nthe same. Mr. Johnson was unable to obtain a clear\nstatement from Mr. J. P. Chaffin as to whether he was\nawake or asleep a.t the time of the apparition. He\nfirst said he was awake but on a \" rather rigid examina-\ntion \" admitted that he might have been in a \" doze.\"\n\" I beheve he does not know himseK.\"\nA somewhat similar case, also from America, is printed\nin Myers's Human Personality, Vol. II., pp. 37-40, in\nwhich a woman, who fell into a swoon on hearing of her\nfather's sudden death, stated on coming out of the swoon\nthat her father had appeared to her, and told her there\nwas a considerable sum of money sewn in a pocket\ninside the shirt he was wearing at the time of his death.\nThe clothes had been tlurown away : they were recovered\nand bills amounting to $35 were found in the pocket as\ndescribed. The daughter appears to have had no normal\nknowledge of the facts revealed by the apparition. In\nthat case, however, the apparition followed very shortly\nafter the death and may have been due to an impression,\ntelepatliically conveyed from the father immediately before\nhis death, being delayed in emergence. In the present\ncase nearly four years intervened between the death and\nthe apparition, so that the hypothesis of delayed telepathy\nis hardly applicable.\nA\n\f103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 525\nAN EXPERIMENT IN PSEUDO-SCRIPTS.\nBy W. H. Salter. 1\nThe purpose of this paper is to give an account of an\nexperiment conducted with a view to ascertaining how\nfar a series of \" pseudo-scripts \" would produce results\nin any way comparable to the cross-correspondences\nwhich have been found in the scripts of the automatic\nwriters often referred to as the S.P.R. group,\" and with\nthe further object of elucidating, if possible, the problem\nof the causes underlying and the agencies producing\nsuch cross-correspondences. What is meant by pseudo-\nscripts will be explained more fully later, but it may\nbe convenient at this stage to say that fourteen members\nof the Society, who kindly consented to co-operate in\nthe experiment, were given a certain number of phrases\nto choose from, and were asked to write down any words\nor sentences that suggested themselves and to post the\nresults to me before a definite date.\nSuggestions have from time to time been made {e.g. by\nDr. Broad in Chap. XII. of The Mind and Its Place in\nNature) that experiments of this kind ought to be con-\nducted, and one experiment has in fact been made and\nreported on in the Journal (Vol. XV.). In that case the\nexperimenters were not given any starting point or points\nfor their pseudo-scripts but were asked to take passages\nof literature at random and work on those. It seemed\ndesirable to repeat the experiment with the variation\nof giving the pseudo-automatists a Hmited choice of\nstarting points in view of the fact that \" the S.P.R.\nThis paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society on\nJuly 8, 1927.\n\f526 W. E. Salter [part\ngroup \" had a certain amount of knowledge of each other's\nscripts.\nI have spoken of \" ehicidating the problem \" of the\nreal scripts, but I am aware that suggestions have been\nmade that there is no problem requiring elucidation, except\nin so far as a fictitious problem has been created by the\ncommentators. The illusion of coherent design in the real\nscripts has, it is hinted, been produced by the arbitrary\nselection and grouping of detached fragments, eked out by\nan unfair straining of literary allusions.\nOpinions will no doubt differ as to the precise meaning\nof scripts admittedly full of allusive symbolism, but a\ncareful reading of all the published scripts and the com-\nmentaries thereon leaves me with the conviction that the\nnumber of instances in which topics and allusions in these\nscripts have been wrongly identified is so small as to be\nnegligible.\nThe charge of unfair selection can only be judged by\nthose who have complete knowledge of all the scripts\nof \" the S.P.R. group.\" This knowledge is confined\nto the commentators themselves, who have from time\nto time explained in some detail the principles on which\nthey work : as they are persons of extreme accuracy, it\nseems gratuitously rash to suspect them of unfairness\nin those cases where they have not given their reasons\nfor grouping scripts in a particular way.\nOn the assumption then that we are confronted with\na genviine problem, five possible explanations suggest\nthemselves, of which three may be grouped as normal,\nnamely (1) chance, (2) collusion. (3) common association\nof ideas, and two as supernormal, namely, (4) telepathy\nfrom some living person, and (5) the influence of some\ndiscarnate intelligence. i\nOf these explanations the first, i.e. chance, pure and\nsimple, may be immediately rejected. Whatever goes to\nthe production of the scri2)ts of \" the S.P.R. group,\" they\nare something more than a fortuitous concourse of words\nfrom a dictionary or quotations from a concordance.\nThey obviously owe something to selective human intelli-\ngence, if only to the conscious or subconscious minds of\n\f103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 527\nthe automatists. Chance no doubt plays a part, as in\nall human affairs, but it must be auxihary or subsidiary\nto some more effective agency.\nIn the case of these particular automatists, collusion\nmay also be left out of account. Although I mentioned\nit among the possible \" normal \" explanations, it seems\nto me, having regard to all that is laaown of the members\nof the group, to be highly abnormal and even fantastic.\nPutting then chance and collusion aside, we are left\nwith two possible explanations, other than the influence\nof discarnate intelligence, namely, common association of\nideas, and telepathy. It was to test the operation of these\ntwo agencies that the experiment was designed.\nIt need hardly be said that no experiment of this\nkind, whatever the results obtained, could constitute a\nconclusive proof as to the cause or causes underlying the\ncross-correspondences of \" the S.P.R. group.\" Supposing\nthat the pseudo-scripts shoidd show (as they in all\nprobability would) correspondences inter se, questions\nwould arise which different people might reasonably\nanswer in different ways. For instance : Are the corre-\nspondences in the pseudo-scripts more or less remarkable\nthan those in the real scripts ? How is it j)ossible in\neither real or pseudo-scripts to differentiate between the\nresults of telepathy and of common association of ideas ?\nMost difficult question of all, what guarantee is there\nthat if, as is sometimes claimed, the real automatists\nwere influenced by discarnate intelligences, the pseudo-\nautomatists were not amenable to the same influence ?\nBut even though the result of the experiment could\nnot be final or conclusive, it might help to elucidate\nthe modus operandi of the real scripts.\nThe fourteen pseudo-automatists were selected by Miss\nNewton and myseff, and the only persons besides ourselves\nwho knew of the composition of the team were my\nwife, and a temporary clerk in the S.P.R. office, to whom\nsome of the necessary papers were given to be typed.\nIn Part II. of the experiment, in which twelve out of\nthe original fourteen took part, I divided the pseudo-\nautomatists by lot into two groups of seven and five\n\f528 W. li. Baiter [part\nrespectively, and informed each member of the grovip of\nseven who the other six members of that group were.\nIn selecting our team Miss Newton and I deuberately\nexchxded all members of \"the S.P.R. group,\" and all\npersons who have been actively engaged in elucidating\nthe scripts of \" the S.P.R. grouj).\" The fourteen are\ndenoted by the letters A to N inclusive, and of these\nwe knew that C and D j)ractised automatic writing, and\nhad achieved success as telepathic \" agents,\" and that\nM had also given evidence of possessing telepathic powers.\nB and M are ladies ; A and F clergymen. B and J\nare distinguished classical scholars. D and I have strong\nliterary tastes, while E, G and L have all specialised in\nsome branch of science. C combines literary and scientific\nattainments. Almost all the fourteen have taken an\nactive part in the Society's work.\nAs a team they are much more homogeneous than\n\" the S.P.R. group.\" Apart from the relationship between\nMrs. Verrall and my wife (Miss VerraU), \" the S.P.R. group\n\"\nhad, except through their scripts, little to link them\ntogether. Several members were personally quite unknown\nto other members. The educational standards of different\nmembers varied considerably. Two were born and brought\nup in America : two had resided long in the East.\nSome were not members of the Society.\nAmong the pseudo-automatists on the ' other hand there\nis a much more level standard of education. All are\nmembers of the Society. All, I beheve, are British by\nbirth and normally resident in this country. We might\ntherefore reasonably expect common association of\nideas to work more powerfully among the pseudo-\nautomatists than among \" the S.P.R. group,\" and on the\nassumption that such association is the main, if not the\nsole, cause of correspondences between the real scripts,\nto find, other conditions being equal, more numerous\nand striking cases of correspondence among the pseudo-\nscripts.\nThe joossible influence of telepathy has, of course, also\nto be considered. Unconscious telepathic \" leakage \" of\nthe land postulated by Prof. Pigou (see Proc, XXIII.\n,\n\f103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 529\npp. 286-303) cannot be experimentally proved or dis-\nproved ; it rests entirely on surmise, without any evi-\ndential foundation. But, in order to test telepathy as\nfar as practicable, attempts were made, as will be ex-\nplained more fully later, to influence the pseudo-scripts\nby dehberate, conscious telepatlty.\nIn each of the two parts of the experiment each pseudo-\nautomatist was requested to produce between 200 and\n300 words of pseudo-scrij)t. I have not counted how\nmuch each sent in, but taking 250 as a rough average,\nwe have altogether 14x250 = 3500 words for Part I., and\n12x250 = 3000 words for Part II., 6500 words altogether.\nFrom start to finish the experiment lasted twenty-four\ndays, from the 3rd to the 27th March, 1927. This is of\ncourse very much less than the time required for the\nproduction of many of the real cross-correspondences, but\nthen many of the real scripts are short, there are often\nlong intervals of time between them, and the largest\nnumber of real automatists concerned in any case is, I\nthink, six, and in most much less.\nA production of 6500 words of pseudo-script in twenty-\nfour days would seem to be fairly comparable to the\ntotal output of real script by \" the S.P.R. group \" over\na much longer period. It would at any rate be enough\nin quantity to form a pretty good basis for comparison.\nAs, however, the pseudo-automatists might be considered\nto be handicapped by shortness of time, I decided to\ngive them a countervaihng advantage over \" the S.P.R.\ngroup,\" by giving them a limited choice of starting-\npoints. In Part I. I set them twelve short phrases, one\nor more of which they were at hberty to choose as texts,\nand for Part II. I added a passage of thirty-six words,\nconsisting of several short phrases.\n\" The S.P.R. group \" were not bound by any such\nlimitations. The world was all before them, where to\nchoose their several starting points. They might start\nfrom one of the real scripts known to them through\npublication in Proceedings or otherwise, but the mass\nof script material known to them offered a very wide\nchoice, and they were in no way confined even within\n\f530 W. H. Salter\n'\n'\n[paet\nthese very wide limits. Assuming, therefore, that common\nassociation of ideas is the main cause of correspondences\nbetween real scrijDts, such correspondences should, ceteris\nparibus, occur with much greater frequency in the pseudo-\nscripts. Taken together, the greater homogeneity of\nthe pseudo-automatists, and the hmitation of their points\nde repere seem to me greatly to outweigh any advantage\naccruing to the real scripts by reason of the short time-\nlimit imposed on the pseudo-automatists.\nI devised the main lines of the experiment in January\n1927, and on February 9 I handed Miss Newton the\ntwelve phrases I had chosen, and a draft of the instruc-\ntions to accompany them. She and I at the same\ntime drew up a list of members of our Society who were\nto be invited to co-operate. On February 14 or 15,\nMiss Newton handed the phrases and instructions to a\ntemporary clerk to be copied. For reasons appearing\nlater the fact that the phrases were finally selected, and\nthat my original draft of them had passed out of my\npossession in the first half of February, is of importance.\nThe instructions and the twelve phrases sent to each\nof the fourteen pseudo-automatists were as follows :\nINSTFvUCTIONS.\n1. Please do not while this experiment is in progress {i.e. till\n13th March, 1927) discuss it with anyone else or mention the\nfact that you are engaged in it.\n2.

On March 1\nhe sent Miss Newton a sealed envelope with instructions\nthat it was not to be opened without his authority.\n\"The sources of the quotations, and the translations of phrases 9 and 12,\nshown in square brackets, were not commtmicated to the pseudo-automatists.\n2 m\n\f532 W. H. Salter [part\nThe envelope contained the following passage from Anatole\nFrance's short story Putois :\nExtract from Anatole France's Putois {Crainquebille, Putois,\nPiquet, et 2^1'usieurs autres recits projitables, Calmann-Levy, Paris)\nchosen by J. G. P. for pseudo-C.C. experiment.\nQuant a notre mere [i.e. the mother of M. Lucien\nBergeret and MUe. Zoe Bergeret], eUe se reprochait im pen\nla naissance de Putois, et non sans raison. Car enfin\nPutois etait ne d'un mensonge de notre mere, comme\nCaliban du mensonge du poete. Sans doute les fautes\nn'etaient pas egales et ma mere etait plus umocente que\nShakespeare. Pourtant elle etait eifrayee et confuse de\nvoir son mensonge bien mince grandir demesurement, et sa\nlegere imposture remporter un si prodigieux succes, qui ne\ns'arretait pas, qui s'etendait sur toute une ville et mena9ait\nde s'etendre sur le monde.\nI knew nothing of the contents of the envelope until\nMarch 30, several days after both parts of the experiment\nwere concluded.\nMr. Piddington informs me that he did not let a day pass\nwhile the experiment was in progress without deliberately\nthinking of this passage from Putois.\nThe object was to ascertain whether the contents of\nthe sealed envelope would influence or show any connection\nwith the pseudo-scripts. It will be remembered that in\nthe \" Sevens Case \" {Proc. XXIV.), the contents of a\nsealed envelope deposited by Mr. Piddington bore a\nstriking relation to the scripts of six automatists of\n\" the S.P.R. group \" written shortly after. It has been\nsuggested that Mr. Piddington inspired the comjilicated\nreferences to the number \" Seven \" in the scripts of\nthese automatists, and I thought it would be interesting\nto see whether his alleged inspiratory influence extended\nto my team.\nBut I did not see why Mr. Piddington should be the\nonty begetter of cross-correspondences, and I determined\nto try my own luck at the game. I accordingly fixed\non two literary topics on which I would keep my mind\n\f103] A7i Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 533\nmore or less continuously during the experiment, and\nI chose some of the twelve phrases with a view to their\nserving as rather distant clues to these topics. The\nintention was that the clue-phrases should not be near\nenough to make it hkely that any of the pseudo-auto-\nmatists would jump to either topic by pure unaided\nreason, but that they might serve as a spark to fire a\ntelepathic train.\nPhrases 1, 2, 10 and 11 (the quotations from Shake-\nspeare, Milton, Wordsworth and Coleridge) were chosen\nmore or less at random as being well-known lines from\nfamous poets. They had not any particular associations\nin my mind : the others had.\nPhrases 3 to 9 inclusive were intended to refer obscurely\nto the subject of two books I happened to have been\nreading last winter, namely Statius' Thebais and\nAeschylus' Seven Against Thebes.\nThe subject of these two poems is the same, the Argive\nexpedition against Thebes occasioned by the quarrel\nbetween the two sons of Oedipus. The Theban legend\nis a long and complicated one : for the purpose of my\nexperiment I confined myself to the latter part of the\nstory, i.e. to the events succeeding the fall of Oedipus\nfrom the kingship, and to one particular episode in that\npart, namely, the fate of three of the Seven Argive\nChampions. I shall not inflict on the Society a full\nexplanation of all the Uterary allusions I embodied in\nthese seven phrases as clues to the topic I had in my\nmind. They were deliberately far-fetched and involved\nin order that not even the accomplished classical scholars\nin my team could reasonably be expected to get the\nright answer by guesswork, however brilhant, unaided by\ntelepathy. All, as I have said, related to a particular\nepisode in the latter part of the tale of Thebes, except\n(and the exception is of importance) that in phrase 3,\nthe first of this group of phrases, I introduced an allusion\nto the Sphinx and repeated the allusion by putting\nphrase 5 in the form of a riddle. The Sphinx and her\nriddle belong to the earlier part of the legend and have\nonly a very remote connection with the main topic of\n\f534 W. H. Salter [part\nthe puzzle. She is, therefore, you may say, dragged in\nby the taiL\n\" The World is weary of the past \" is the penultimate\nline of the final chorus in Shelley's Hellas, from which\nI will quote two stanzas :\nO, write no more the tale of Troy ^\nIf Earth Death's scroU must be,\nNor mix with Laian rage the joy '\nWhich dawns upon the free, '\nAlthough a subtler Sphinx renew\nRiddles of Death Thebes never knew.\n0 cease ! must hate and death return ?\nCease ! must men kill and die ?\nCease, dram not to the dregs the urn\nOf bitter prophecy.\nThe world is weary of the past :\nOh ! might it die or rest at last.\nPhrase 12 contains another literary puzzle of a simpler\nkind. The line is part of the greeting addressed by the\nnymph Calypso to Hermes : the meaning of the line\nis irrelevant to the experiment, and so is the context.\nBut the same line (with change of gender) occurs in\ntwo other places in Homer {Iliad, XVIII., 386 and 425),\nand the context of the passages is significant. The\nwords are addressed to Thetis, first by the wife of\nHephaestus (\n= Vulcan =Mulciber) and then by Hephaestus\nhimself. Between the two greetings Hephaestus narrates\nhis fall from Olympus. The Iliad tells this story in two\ndifferent ways : according to Book I. he was lame because\nhe fell ;\naccording to Book XVIII. he fell because he\nwas lame. In Book XVIII. he falls into the sea : in\nBook I. on the isle of Lemnos, and that is the story I\nwas getting at. Phrase 12 is a clue to it at two removes.\nI chose this topic, the fall of Hephaestus on Lemnos,\nfor two reasons. One reason was similar to that which\nguided my choice of the Theban legend. In November\n1926 I had read a paper (quite unconnected with Psychical\nResearch) to a small Society meeting in my part of the\ncountry, and in that paper I had occasion to refer to\n\f103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 535\nHomer's story of tlie fall of Hephaestus, and to quote\nMilton's description of it in Book I. of Paradise Lost.\nThe topic was thus fresh in my mind.\nThe second reason was that some years ago, during\nthe War, when my wife and I were doing table-tilting\nexperiments together, there had been references to Lemnos :\nI have since ascertained that there was one in our first\ntable-tilting in November 1916. These references had\npuzzled us both at the time, and we then supposed that\nthey were connected with the War, and particularly\nwith the death of a friend in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nBut on my mentioning the matter some time later to\nMr. Piddington, he replied briefly that they referred to\n\" Mulciber.\"\nI felt sure that none of the pseudo-automatists knew\neither that there had been table-tilting allusions to Lemnos,\nor what those allusions meant. I did not myself then\nknow what were the script associations of the Mulciber-\nLemnos story, and it seemed to me it would be instructive\nto see not only whether any of the pseudo-automatists\ngot on to that topic, but whether, if they did, they\ndeveloped it on the same lines, whatever those might\nbe, as the real scripts.\nThe introduction of these two literary puzzles was\nintended, among other things, to serve as a means for\ndistinguishing between the operation of telepathy and\nof common association of ideas. If the only points of\ncontact discoverable between the pseudo-scripts were\nconnected with the topics of these puzzles, that would\nsuggest telepathy, and the case for telepathy would be\nparticularly strong if any of the pseudo-automatists,\nother than those who had specialised classical knowledge,\narrived at or approximated to a solution of either puzzle.\nIf on the other hand any points of contact occurred in\nconnection with other phrases and other topics, that\nwould suggest common association of ideas rather than\ntelepathy.\nIf no one of the fourteen caught on to either of my\ntwo topics, or to the topic (then unknown to me) lying\nhidden in Mr. Piddington's envelope, it seemed to me\n\f536 W. H. Salter [part\nthat deliberate and conscious telepathy having been given\nthree chances with fourteen persons and having failed\nevery time, unconscious or subconscious telepathic \" leak-\nage \" would be, I do not say disproved, as an explanation\nof cross-correspondences, whether in real scripts or pseudo-\nscripts, but at least considerably blown upon. A long\nstep would have been taken towards relieving Mi\\ Pidding-\nton of the odious suspicion of having instigated the\n\" Sevens \" cross-correspondence.\nNone of the pseudo-automatists in Part I. in fact got\non to any of the thxee topics which Mr. Piddington and\nI indejDendently were trying to transmit : none of them\nmade an unmistakable, even if distant, approach thereto.\nM and J come the nearest.\nM in a pseudo-script covering an immense variety of\ntopics mentions one of Anatole France's stories {L'lle des\nPingouins) ; this is a long story not included in the\nvolume of short stories containing Putois.\nJ, working on the Odyssey line I had given as one of\nthe twelve phrases, begins \" Elpenor\u2014but I don't see\nthe connection.\" Elpenor is a very minor character\nin the Odyssey about whom all we are told is that he\nbroke his neck falling off a roof where he had gone\nto sleep, and that his shade is the first to greet Odysseus\nin the Land of the Dead. J, therefore, gets the idea\nof a fall, which is part of the Hephaestus-Lemnos topic.\nThat appears to be the best either Mr. Piddington or\nI could do in the way of conscious telepathic trans-\nmission, and it is not much to boast of.\nThere are, on the other hand, a few points of resem-\nblance between the different pseudo-scripts which, having\nregard to the failure of Mr. Piddington's and my efforts\nat telepathy, and to the fact that the pseudo-automatists\nwere given a limited choice of starting points, seem prima\nfacie to be the result of the common association of\nideas. Viewed in this hght most of these correspondences\nseem to me obvious and almost inevitable : the surprising\nthing would have been their non-occurrence : some seem\nto be not quite so obvious, and one or two are perhaps\nrather beyond what might have been expected.\n\f103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 537\nI will mention all the correspondences I have noted,\nplacing them in an ascending scale, beginning with the\nmost obvious ones : complete specimen pseudo-scripts\nwill be printed in the Appendix, so that a general idea\ncan be formed as to how far they resemble the real\nscripts of \" the S.P.R. group.\"\nIn connection with the phrase \" The world is weary\nof the past,\" two pseudo-automatists suggest that it\nmay become even more weary of the future, a thought\nwhich has probably occurred to all of us during the\naftermath of the \" War to end War.\" Another pair\nrefer in slightly varying language to the scriptural precept\nabout the dead burying their dead : this, like the first\nseems to me so obvious a development of the idea of the\nphrase as hardly to be worth mentioning.\nFor the remaining correspondences I will quote sufficient\nof the context in each case to indicate the train of\nthought. The passages in square brackets represent the\npseudo-automatists' own annotations.\nI. J's Script : 12th March.\n[Here began to think about \" not marble nor the gUded\nmonuments \"] . . .

The line, \" Oh for the touch,\"\netc., fits in quite appropriate^ in K's series of proverbs\nand gnomic sayings about the past. But it is odd that\nJ should get to the same point starting from the Odyssey\nline which, as explained, has nothing to do with Elpenor.\nTaking J's pseudo-script backwards, it is easy to trace\n\f103] An Experiment in Psendo-Scripts 541\nthe connection of Tennyson's words with J's thought\nof liis friend killed in the War, and from that to trace\nthe connection to Odj'-sseus' dead comrade, Elpenor.\nBut why drag in Elpenor ?

The general tendency of the script was no\ndoubt influenced by the knowledge that the experiment\nhad a bearing on evidence for siu-vival.\" In point of\nfact I had deliberately excluded from my choice of phrases\nany that had in n]y own mind any association with the\nidea of survival, any references, e.g. to Lethe or Pro-\nserjiine.\nThis is the one and only case where it seems to me\na correspondence has been produced outside what might\nhave been anticipated from the common association of\nideas.\nt Nearly all my pseudo-automatists had kindly agreed\nto take part in a second round, and even before Part I.\nwas launched, I had formed a scheme for modifying the\nconditions in two respects.\nOne modification was to divide the team into two\nhalves, so that Group I. should consist of persons knowing\neach other's identities, but not the identities of the\nmembers of Group II., while Group II. should remain as\nmuch in the dark as before. The purpose was to ascer-\ntain whether this knowledge would affect any corre-\nspondences wliich might occur : whether they would\nbe greater or less within Group I. than within Group II.\nFor unavoidable reasons E and J were unable to\ncontinue for the second part of the experiment, so that\nthe team was reduced to twelve. My intention was to\nselect six by lot for Group I., but accidentally, owing to\ntwo pajjer slips sticking together when the lots were\n\f542 W. H. Salter [part\ndrawn, Group I. actually contained seven members, and\nGroup II. five.\nThe second modification was to set as a text a piece\nof real unpublished script produced by a member of\n\" the S.P.R. group,\" with a view to seeing whether any\nof the pseudo-automatists would follow the same develop-\nment of ideas and phrases as was shown in the real\nscripts. I accordingly wrote to Mr. Piddington on\nMarch 9, explaining my intention, and leaving the selection\nentirely to him. He rej)lied on March 10, enclosing the\nfollowing script :\nSomething about a church\u2014a high-pointed spire against\nthe sky\u2014Over the edge\u2014the bottomless abyss\u2014depths un-\nphimbed\u2014down down down\u2014the topmost pinnacle\u2014the\nkingdoms of the earth\u2014a king's son\u2014known of old\n\u2014\nOedipus.\nPart II. of the experiment began on March 15 and\nended on March 25. Mr. Piddington's selected script\nwas sent to each of the twelve pseudo-automatists with\ninstructions to treat it as additional to the twelve phrases\nsent them for Part I. A, B, C, D, H, K and L, the\nmembers of Group I. were informed of each other's\nidentities.\nTwo of the twelve (H and N) continued their associa-\ntion with phrases set in Part I, without, however, scoring\nany fiu'ther success. The remaining ten took Mr.\nPiddington's selected script as their text.\nReaders of Mr. Piddington's paper in Part 102 of\nProceedings will already have recognised the selected\nscript, which is in fact an amalgamation of two scripts\nof my wife's. For the benefit of those who have not\nread that paper, it may be stated that it elucidates a\ncross-correspondence between certain automatic scripts\nof Mrs. King and of my wife (the latter including the\n\" selected script \"), and that this cross-correspondence\ncombines references to four falls from a height, namely\n(1) the fall of Mulciber-Hephaestus on Lemnos [Milton,\nParadise Lost, Book I.] ; (2) the fall of the Sphinx after\nOedipus had guessed her riddle [Ovid, Met. VIL] ; (3) the\n\f103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 543\nfall of Satan from the pinnacle of the Temple [Milton,\nParadise Regained, Book IV.. 11. 540-576] ; and (4) the fall\nof master-builder Solness at the end of Ibsen's play of\nthat name.\nMr. Piddington's selection of this piece of script for\nPart II. of the experiment was prompted, as he informs\nme, by his having been for some time before working on\nthis cross-correspondence.\nNone of the pseudo-automatists knew anything about this\ncross-correspondence until after Part II. of the experiment\nhad been completed. I first heard vaguely of a cross-\ncorrespondence involving Oedipus and the Master Builder\nafter I had chosen the phrases for Part I., but knew nothing\ndefinite about it until after the end of Part II.\nNone of the ten pseudo-automatists combines as much\nas two of these four topics. None of them specifically\nrefers to any single one of them. There are, as was\nto be expected, several allusions to the story of the\nTemptation as told in the Bible, and. one of the ten (C),\nquotes part of the relevant passage from Paradise Regained\n(Book IV.). His quotation is as follows (11. 549-552) :\nThere on the highest pinnacle he set\nThe Son of God, and added thus in scorn :\n\"There stand, if thou wilt stand: to stand upright\nWill ask thee skiU.\"\nAt that point he stops. He also mentions the Sphinx, the\nonly one of the ten who does so. His reference is as\nfollows\n:\nOedipus and the Eiddling Sphinx. \" What goes on four\nfeet, on two feet, on three, but the more feet it goes on\nthe weaker it be.\" \"A Sphinx without a secret \" Oscar\nWilde (short story) The Oedipus Complex.\nAfter further allusions to Oscar Wilde's works and his\ntomb, C passes on to the Egyj)tian Spliinx, a wholly\ndifferent creature.\nAs Mr. Piddington's selected script contained the words\n\" topmost pinnacle \" and \" Oedipus,\" there is nothing remark-\nable in a man of C's wide reading touching on the Temp-\ntation on the Temple as narrated hj Milton, or on the\n\f544 IF. \/\/. Salter [part\nSphinx. What is, I think, interesting and instructive, is\nthat C should come so very near combining two of the\nfour topics in Mr. Piddington's paper, and should have\nmissed them both. C has an unusual knowledge of Eng-\nlish poetry, and particularly of Milton, as his pseudo-\nscripts show. He quotes from the same passage in Paradise\nRegained as Mr. Piddmgton up to a point, and then diverges\nto the Temptation on the Mountain. Had he gone on with\nhis quotation another ten lines he would have hit on one of\nthe four falls of the cross-correspondence, \" But Satan, smitten\nwith amazement, fell.\" Had he gone on for a further\neleven lines he would have come on the \" Theban monster\n\"\nand her fall. He knows his Milton well : after quoting\nMilton's account of the Temptation on the Temple he\nalludes to the Theban Sphinx : he does not combine the\ntwo as Milton does, and as the scripts in Mr. Piddington's\npaper do. That he should have come so near the real\nthing, and yet wholly have missed it, suggests that caution\nshould be used before imputing to \" the S.P.R. groxip,\"\nwhose average literary knowledge is far below that of C,\nunhmited powers, tlirough common association of ideas, of\ncombining in an intricate design passages from literature a\ngreat deal more recondite than Paradise Regained.\nSo much as to connections between the pseudo-scripts\nin Part II. and Mr. Piddington's selected script. Corre-\nspondences between the pseudo-scripts themselves there in-\nevitably are. Three of the ten take the spire to be that\nof Salisbury Cathedral : as this is the highest spire in\nEngland there is nothing noteworthy in that. Two, com-\nbining the j)lii\"<ises \" church \" and \" depths unplumbed,\"\narrive at the idea of submerged churches : but as there are\nwell-known stories of churches submerged in the sea at\nvarious points round our coasts, this again comes to very\nlittle. Then there are obvious and inevitable references to\nthe Temptation, i.e. to the Scriptural, as distinct from the\nMiltonic narrative. Apart from these, I have failed to\ntrace any correspondences. Group I., the \"informed\"\ngroup, fares no better than Group II., the \" non-informed.\"\nTo sum up both parts of the experiment, the con-\nsiderable mass of pseudo-scrij)ts received shows no point\n\f103] A71 Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 545\nof contact with any one of the three test topics chosen\nindependently by Mr. Piddington and myself in Part I.,\nor with the script selected by him for Part II., unless\nJ's reference to Elpenor be a very distant approach to\nthe fall of Hephaestus or the other falls referred to in\nMr. Piddington's paper. Of the correspondences between\nthe different pseudo-scripts, if we take into account the\nstrictly hmited choice of starting-points allowed to the\nwriters, nothing seems clearly to pass the Hmits of the\nobvious, except, again, J's contribution, his allusion to\nTennyson's \" touch of a vanished hand,\" which he arrives\nat via Elpenor. One may in fact say that if some un-\naccountable impulse had not resurrected the dead Elpenor\nin J's mind, the experiment would have been notably\nbarren of results in any way resembling the cross-corre-\nspondences of the real scripts of \" the S.P.R. group,\"\nalthough, for reasons already stated, the conditions of\nthe experiment were far more favourable to the production\nof correspondences by common association of ideas than\nthe conditions under which \" the S.P.R. group \" function.\nThat at any rate is my opinion. Possibly some one\nmay be found to maintain that the experimental cross-\ncorrespondences are quite up to the level of the real ones.\nThere is no accounting for tastes, but if such a person\ncomes forward I would point out (1) that none of the\npseudo-automatists, singly or jointly, produce any allusion\noutside the range of their normal Uterary knowledge, in\nthe way that the members of \" the S.P.R. group \" fre-\nquently do ; and (2) that such correspondences as were\nproduced were of the simplest possible kind ; there is a\nmomentary contact, after which the streams of association\ndiverge without the tendency characteristic of the real\nscripts to come back again and again to a common point\nof meeting. Nor are the pseudo-scripts, with a few ex-\nceptions, in the least hke the real article in general\nappearance. They are, to take a single point of difference,\nobviously much more influenced by the writer's own per-\nsonal doings and experiences : when confronted with a\nchurch spire, the clerical members of the team think of\nchurches with which they have had personal associations.\n\f546 W. H. Salter [PAKT\nsuch of the lay members as served in the War think of\ntheir training on Sahsbury Plain or the shattered churches\nof the War zone. Any one who would, after studying\nboth series, maintain that the same mental processes went\nto the making of the pseudo-scripts and the scripts of\n\" the S.P.R. group \" would, I think, prove himself de-\nficient in literary sense.\nCuriously enough, the correspondences of this experiment\nappear to be no better than those of the previous ex-\nperiment in jDseudo-scripts, although the conditions in that\ncase were less favourable, as the pseudo-automatists had\nno common starting-point or points.\nThe inferiority as regards correspondences of the pseudo-\nscripts in this experiment to the real scripts would not, of\ncoiirse, prove that the latter could not be the result of\ncommon association of ideas and \/ or telepathy. There is\nthe human equation to be considered, and \" the S.P.R.\ngroup \" may be\u2014there is no reason to suppose they are\n\u2014\nmore readily influenced by these agencies than the pseudo-\nautomatists. What the experiment seems strongly to in-\ndicate is that the hypotheses of telepathy and common\nassociation of ideas must not be rashly invoked as obvious,\ncomplete, satisfactory explanations of the phenomena of\nthe real scripts. They may be the true explanation, or\nthey may not : the onus probandi rests just as heavily on\nthose who propound them as on those who look for an\nexplanation elsewhere.\nTo complete the record of this experiment it is necessary\nto refer briefly to one other correspondence, in which the\npseudo-automatists took no part, I mean the correspon-\ndence between the two literary puzzles I had embodied in\nthe phrases handed to Miss Newton on February 9, and the\nscript selected by Mr. Piddington and sent me on March 10.\nIt is a very small and simple correspondence, but the\nexperiment produced such a poor crop within its designed\nlimits, that one cannot afford to neglect the unexpected\ndiscovery outside its limits of so humble a specimen.\nThe reader will best be able to appreciate this corre-\nspondence if he compares Mr. Piddington's paper in Part\n102 of Proceedings with what I have already said as to\n\f103] An Experime^it in Pseudo-Scripts 547\nmy two literary puzzles, but a brief recapitulation may be\nuseful. The first of these two puzzles introduced, rather\nirrelevantly, two definite allusions to the Theban Sphinx ;\nthe second was a hidden allusion to the fall of Hephaestus\n(Mulciber) on Lemnos. I have already explained the\nreasons which led me to choose these two topics. There\nwas no conscious association between them in my\nmind.\nMr. Piddington, at my request, but without any prompt-\ning on my part as to what he should choose, a month\nlater selects a piece of real script forming part of a cross-\ncorrespondence between Mrs. King and my wife which\ncombines these two topics in a way I had never antici-\npated. His reason for the selection was that the selected\nscript lay ready to hand : he chose it, as he put it,\n\" largely to save myself trouble.\"\nWe acted quite independently of each other, and each\nhad quite natural and normal reasons for selecting what\nwe did. For some obscure reason we succeeded in pro-\nducing a correspondence which, if a molehill compared with\nthe achievements of \" the S.P.R. group,\" is a mountain\ncompared with anything the fourteen pseudo-automatists\nwere able to produce, notwithstanding the advantage they\nderived from having a limited choice of starting points.\nAPPENDIX.i\nI.

Irving.\nIt is scarcely possible, I think, to take a lengthy series\nof sittings with trance mediums without coming to certain\nconclusions of one's own on points of detail. These may\nnot be of much value, but may possibly interest other\nresearchers in the same field of enquiry ; and so I am\nventuring again to put forward a few of my own thoughts\non trance phenomena in the hope of learning whether\nthey coincide with the thoughts of other investigators.\nAlso ; I have received, from time to time, statements\nfrom my communicator, generally in \" Personal Control,\"\nas to the difficulties that she says she encounters in\ncommunicating. Some of these have seemed to me to\nbe original, and some of no little interest, so I am dealing\nwith a few of these below.\nFirst I want to suggest ^ two more reasons why it\nwould seem to be risky to interrupt a control, by asking\nquestions, much as one often wants to do so ; or by\nasking the control to \" wait \" while one takes the material\ndown. The communication received may not then, I\nthink, be what the communicator wishes to give.\nIt has been told me that there is danger of waking\nthe medium's subconscious mind to take an active interest\nin what is being given, especially if the subject of the\ncommunication be one in which the medium would nor-\nmally be interested. The subconscious mind, according to\nthis theory, would seem to be liable at times\u2014especially\nif stimulated in any way\u2014to wake to active interest, and\ntake a hand, as it were, in what is going on : cutting\noff the communicating intelligence, and continuing the\nconversation, though to the sitter there is no visible\n^See also Jour. S.P.R., Vol. XXI., pp. 82-87.\n\f556 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part\nbreak, or sign\u2014apart from the contents of the material\u2014\n\u2022\nthat such a change has taken place. Indeed I think that\nI have had instances of something of this sort, quite\nrecently, in my own sittings when I have not interrupted\nthe control in any way. It may be that it often happens.\nFor instance, in the \" Personal Control,\" through Mrs.\nLeonard, on April 20, 1926, almost directly after \" D.G.I.\n\"\nhad brought up the subject of my cats, the tone of the\ncontrol changed, and became Feda-ish. The suggestion\nwas put forward that arrangements should be made that\nwhen anything happened to me, the cats should not be\nleft behind ! Feda's great interest in cats will be familiar\nto aU who have sat with Mrs. Leonard. This possibility\nof the communicator being thus \" cut off \" suddenly was\nfirst brought to my notice by the \" D.G.I. Control\n\"\nat a sitting on September 20, 1923. I had better quote\nexactly what was then said as to this :\nD.G.I. WUl you be seeing Belle next time you come ?\nI ought not to have asked. (It doesn't matter. Why\ndid you ask ? ^) I can only say \" Because Belle's in my\nmind,\"\u2014Isn't it absurd ! Belle's fresh in my mind, do\nyou see ? (What makes the difficulty ?) The fact of the\nother brain. I have to be so careful not to let the\nbrain question. Sometimes I state a thing as a matter\nof fact, as if I didn't understand the importance, and\nthen afterwards I explain that I did understand. Sup-\nposing, just then, when I said that about Belle, that I'd\ntried to explain I'd seen Belle lately, the medium's brain\nwould have jumped at me saying \" Have you ?\n\" \" How ?\n\"\n\" When ? \" and would immediately have raised a wall of\nquestioning ; but if I just squeeze a little natural state-\nment through that doesn't raise any curiosity, I can\nfoUow it up after. I think that's why questions are so\ndiffictdt to answer\u2014because the medium's brain starts\nasking questions, not her normal brain, but her automatic,\nsubconscious, part of her brain.\nI had had a sitting with Mrs. Brittain, whose control\nis \" Belle,\" three days previously.\n1 Remarks by the sitter are in round brackets throughout.\n\f103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 557\nShould this \" cutting in \" be a common occurrence it\nmay well explain some of the remarkable statements that\nat times are made through mediums with regard to the\nnature and character of life after death. Few subjects\nwould, I suppose, be more likely to awaken the interest\nof the medium's brain, and it may be that true informa-\ntion as to these things is well nigh impossible to get\nthrough\u2014unless, perhaps, it be in the form of book-\ntests, when the medium, presumably, does not know what\nis being given.\nThe second suggestion that I want to make, as to why\nit is risky to interrupt a control, is that it would seem\nto be possible that sentences may be missed by the\ncontrol during the brief time that elapses while a question\nis being asked, or wliile the control is waiting the con-\nvenience of the sitter, and for the communicator to be\nignorant of this. At a sitting with Mrs. Leonard on\nNovember 22, 1923, I found out, by chance, that this\nhad happened, and, if once, probably it happens not\ninfrequently. A book-test had been given by Feda\nfrom my drawing-room, which was followed by some\ndefinite descriptions of things in the room. After that,\nFeda continued, \" Why do you think ? Why does one\nsuddenly think of time in this room ? Time seems to\nworry you a bit in this room.\" She feels you suddenly\nstarting up, and saying, ''What's the time ?\n\" As I do\nnot use my drawing-room, I saw at once that something\nwas wrong, and I asked \" Which room are you talking\nabout ?\n\" Feda replied :\nShe says, go back a bit, and I'll go over this a little.\nFirst of all we were in the room where the books were\nthat you go in straight from the door, and they were\nopposite. She says, \" I am not in that room now.\"\nYou didn't teU him, Dora ! She's glad you asked that.\nYou must teU Feda ! Sometimes she says something, and\nwhen I ivait I forget somethmg. . . . Now she's in another\nroom\u2014one you think of the time in.\nSince writing the above, a third danger in asking\nquestions, or suggesting, has been mentioned by my\n\f558 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part\ncommunicator. It was at a sitting on November 18,\n1926, and arose in this way. \" D.G.I.\" had spoken of\nhaving met \" someone who's passed over . . . someone we\nboth knew.\" Certain particulars were given, but no\nname. This it seemed to be impossible to give. Wishing\nto see what the result would be I said, \" Shall I suggest ?\n\"\nI now quote from the Script :\nD.G.I. No ! Better not ! Will ! There are times when\nyou suggest, and I can answer \" No,\" but one doesn't\nwant to waken anything of the brain. When a question,\nor a suggestion, comes from your side, it's likely to bring\na response from your side. You might affect the brain\nof the medium, because her brain belongs to the physical\nworld you belong to. Its only with a certain amount of\ndifficulty I operate on it. I'm perfectly certain that\nif you came with a very strong, and persistent, desire\nto suggest\u2014shall we say \" Horace had passed over\n\"\nthat you might get that, because you would play on, and\naiiect, that part of the medium which responds to your\nside of things. . . . The more perfect the psychic develop-\nment, the longer it would take you : for the well- developed\nmedium is trained to accept from our side only, but\nthat doesn't mean that they can never possibly get\nsomething from yours. . . . The object of a good \" Control\n\"\n\u2014a good \" Spirit Control,\" I mean\u2014is to get the medium\nto respond to her, and to us\u2014that is to the control,\nand to us. It's just as well to know where we stand.\nIt's possible for a medium to get things from you, but\nnot desirable, and that's why we like to give things\nourselves instead of your suggesting them\u2014then we're\non sure ground. Will ! The more sure we are\u2014the more\nwe understand\u2014the more quickly we shall get on. I\nthink that you and I have shown people we can get\nthings outside of telepathy, that couldn't by any stretch\nof imagination be attributed to telepathy between you and\nthe medium. Of course there always is between me and\nFeda\n\f103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 559\n(2)\nNext I want to put forward the suggestion that the\nsubject of communications is limited to some considerable\nextent by certain factors, little known as yet by us, but\none of which is the material to be found at the time\nwithin the medium's brain. This, also, was told me by\nthe \" D.G.I. Control,\" on April 28, 1925, and I think her\nwords are worth quoting at some length. I must just\nsay first, however, that I had recently come up to town,\nand had brought sandwiches with me instead of having\nlunch on the train as I usually do. I now quote from\nthe Script\n:\nD.G.I. Will ! Do you remember a very good test that\nI gave once that was spoilt, or partly spoilt, by someone\nsaying something here ? . . . Will ! (Yes . . .) Were you\nthinking about taking food with you a little while ago ?\n(Yes). I seemed to get it from you. (Yes. I brought\nsandwiches with me instead of having lunch on the train.)\nI seemed to get that from your mind. I'll teU you why\nI'm mentioning that. It reminds me of something you\nand I used to do together\u2014taking food with us hke\nthat ... I used to get it ready, wrap it up nicely, and\nmake it ready ... (I wonder if you could remember\nsomething in connection with that ?) I'm thinking of\none special time that I'm reminded of (What happened\nto it ?) Now I want to laugh ! Spoilt, sp>oilt. Will,\nbut in rather a funny way. It's the way it was spoilt\nwas so funny. On it. On it.\nThe communicator then tried to describe, at some length,\nwhat had happened to the sandwiches\u2014which had been\nI\nalmost impossible to eat through having been put in a\nnewly varnished bag\u2014but that in passing ! It is of her\nstatements immediately after this that I want to speak,\nshe continued :\nWhen I talked about yovir sandwiches, I only did so\nto lead up to this. I try to go from one thing to another,\nit's the only way in which I can approach things. We\ncaU it over here \" The Law of Associations,\" and that is\n\f560 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part\nhow we work in every thing that we do. When we're\nworking with a medium\u2014especially a normal one\u2014we try\nto find something in their normal consciousness that fits\nwith, what we want to talk about, and we work from that,\nvery often. ... If I'd got an important test, I should\nlook for something that Imked up with it in the medium's\nmind. If I wanted to tell you the house had been on\nfixe, I should try to find something in the medium's mind,\nlike \" fire.\" \" Striking a match,\" \" Lighting a candle,\"\nwould do. That is what you would caU colouring Then\nI could work from that. When you find afterwards, the\nmedium's been doing a certain thing, you account for the\ntest in that way\u2014which is quite correct. We often\nwait to give a thing through till we find something that\ncorresponds to it in the medium's normal consciousness.\nWill ! In everything we do, in everything we tell you,\nwe're working in some way in a link\u2014through a link.\nDon't you notice I use you in that way ? I watch you\ndoing some httle thing. Like I watched you with the\nsandwiches, because it was making a httle link, in the\npresent conditions, with what I wanted to speak of\u2014what\nwe had done. I used you as a foundation. Will ! That's\nwhy names are so difficult\u2014one can't get a foundation for\nthem.\nIn the above, I take it that the key-word found in\nthe mediuni's brain, and used as a foundation, was the\nword spoilt ; and that my having been recently concerned\nwith food in a train was a stimulating factor that, also,\nhelped the communicator to speak on the subject of past\nassociations with food. Studying back sittings, with\nthese thoughts in mind, I find that, so far as I can\ngather, this sort of tiling may be continually happening\n\u2014\nalthough it is not often easy to learn both ends of the\nlink. The link in my mind can generally be traced by\nme, but the link with the medium's brain must generally\nbe taken for granted. Occasionally, however, one may\nget both. For instance, at my sitting with. Mi^s. Leonard,\non September 23, 1926, I showed her just before the\nsitting, in the presence of my note-taker, a cutting\n\f103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 561\nfrom Light that I thought would interest her. The\nword, therefore, was in her brain. One of the first httle\ntests that my communicator gave\u2014a trifling, preliminary\nlittle test\u2014concerned, apparently, some remarks that I\nhad made to Dr. Woolley about Light the day before.\nThe Script runs :\nFeda. Mr. Bill ! Try and remember, after, if you were\nreminded, or talking about, anything to do with lights\nyesterday ? For Dora keep saying \" Light,\" \" light,\"\npointing to herseh, and then to you, and saying \" Light.\"\nOne more example, in which only one end of the link\ncan be traced. At a sitting on April 30, 1925, \" D.G.I.\"\nbegan to tallc about a girl named \" Ada,\" and tried to\ngive her surname. She did not get it, but got something\nlike part of the sound, after several attempts. A few\ndays before the sitting I had met another \" Ada.\" This\nmeeting had not, so far as I can remember, recalled the\nformer \" Ada \" to my mind. They were neither of them\nof any interest to me. But the necessary, or helpful,\nlink with the past would seem to have been, on one\nside, established. The other, if other there were, is not\nknown.\nIt is, perhaps, possible that the curious way in which\npast events are sometimes identified by unexpected names\nmay be due to something of this sort. My communicator\nwas once trying to remind me of a time in our past\nlives, when we frequently had to post what we then\nthought to be important letters. She led me to identi-\nfication of the place by giving the surname\u2014an unusual\none\u2014of the vicar of a neighbouring parish to the one in\nwhich we were working. True we lived in that parish,\nbut we had practically nothing to do with that vicar.\nThe result was successful. I, at once, recalled the events\nof which she was trying to remind me, but the method\nshe had used puzzled me greatly at the time. It would\nhave seemed to be so much more sensible to have given\nthe name of my own vicar, or of the city in which we\nthen had lived.\n\f562 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part\n(3)\nThe personal likings, and dislikings, of the mediums\nthemselves\u2014the things too that they are most interested\nin\u2014would seem to be factors in assisting communication\nabout certa'in subjects. For instance\u2014my wife came of a\nfamily devoted to music. She was accustomed as a\nchild to play in a small orchestra composed mainly of\nmembers of her own family. Later, she became a quite\nbrilliant musician, played the violin and piano unusually\nwell, and sang songs to her own accompaniment. She\nwas always devoted to music ;\nyet, at many sittings with\nMrs. Leonard and Mrs. Brittain, music was hardly\nmentioned except in a few casual remarks about her\nsongs, etc. On going to Mr. Vango, however, for three\nsittings, the subject of music was brought up as being\nimportant to her. On July 28, 1922, \" Sunflower \" (Mr.\nVango's Control) said :\nShe was particularly fond of music. . . She was a musician,\nshe played. I don't mean to say she was a professional\nmusician, but she did something with it. She did some-\nthing with her music. I don't see her taking money\n\u2014\nnot sure : she brought music to the front\u2014not only played\nin her drawing-room at home. She sang sometimes . . .\nAnd on November 17, 1922, \" Sunflower \" said :\nShe has a beautiful voice. She sat down, and played\nher accompaniments. She's sitting at the piano now,\nand playing, and turning round to you, and smiling.\nShe has a meaning in that. I can't get any particular\nair, but she's trying to convey to me something special.\nShe wouldn't always sing religious airs, would she ?\nShe sang the airs of the day as at an ordinary concert.\nAfter one of these sittings, the subject of music was\nbrought up by Mr. Vango, and he told me that he was\nvery fond of music, and that he, and I think he said his\nsons, formed a little family orchestra, and often played\ntogether. I had another illustration of the same sort of\nthing\u2014nnitual interests of medium and communicator,\n\f103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 563\napparently furthering easy communication on a particular\nsubject, at sittings with Mr. Vout Peters. In this case\nthe subject was a very different one. My wife, as the\nwife of a parish clergyman had, of necessity, much\nparochial work to do, and many diiSculties to en-\ncounter. The position of a clergyman's wife\u2014especially\nwhen the clergyman is an assistant curate\u2014is seldom\neasy. She has no official position, yet much is expected\nof her, and great tact is often required if troubles are\nto be avoided. Little was said of past vicars, or parishes,\nor parish worries, however, at my sittings, until I went to\nMr. Vout Peters. Mr. Peters, though not, I think, a\nmember of the Church of England, is interested in religion\ngenerally ;\nreHgious matters are much in his mind. This\nwould seem to have facihtated veridical taUi on such\nsubjects, and many little tilings from the past have been\nrecalled through this medium, vicars described and\ncriticised, housing difficulties recalled, former hopes and\nambitions spoken of, and in a markedly more realistic\nway than the way in which this one subject has been\ndealt with through others.\n(4)\nWhen giving book-tests, my communicator has stated\nat times, through Feda, that certain places are good to\nget tests from. For instance, with regard to the house\nof \"Mr. Y\" at Hampstead {Proc. Vol. XXXVL, Part\n99, pages 239-250), Feda said, on September 21, 1925 :\nIt was a good place to get tests from . . . This house\nhas quite a good condition for her, though, at any time,\nand she thought perhaps you had wondered why she didn't\ngo back there more often instead of choosing other places\nwhich she hears you groaning and grumbling at inwardly.\nOn January 26, 1926,^ Feda said, of a room in this\nhouse :\nIts got a kind feeling, like a nice\u2014you know\u2014like a\nroom that's lUie a nice fat kind aunt. (Aunt ?) Yes.\nigee also S.P.R. Jour., Vol. XXIV., p. 4.\n2 o\n\f564 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part\n\" Well,\" Dora says, \" It's got a lived in feeling, a homely\nfeeling.\" . . . She says it has given her a good condition\nbefore when she's tried. Mr. Bill ! She says it isn't the\nrooms themselves, you know, its the people who've had\nthe rooms, that make it easy, or difficult for her.\nWith this thought in mind, I have studied my book-\ntests to see if certain places do seem to be better than\nothers with regard to obtaining successful tests, and I\nfind that there is ample evidence of the correctness of\nthe statement. From some houses the book-tests are\nnearly always successful, from others nearly always\nfailures, or so confused as to be useless for evidence.\nWith regard to the reason for this, I have no suggestion\nto make. I am hoping that someone else may be able\nto find a clue. My best series of book-tests have been\ntaken from the house just mentioned. The people are\nnot Spiritualists, and were but mildly interested in the\nsubject of Psychical Research when I tried to tell them\nsomething about it. I knew little of the house\u2014had only\nonce been to it when the first series of tests was given,\nand Mr. and Mrs. Y. do not know Mrs. Leonard. They\nwere, however, very fond of my wife in life. My next\nbest series of book-tests\u2014with perhaps one exception from\nmy own house\u2014have been from a house into which I\nhave never entered. The verification was kindly done\nfor me by an \" S.P.R.\" official. I have only met the\nlady who b'ves in this house once or twice ;\nbut, in this\ncase I understand that she has herself had a few \" Leonard \"\nsittings. My communicator claims to have met her hus-\nband, who has passed from this life, and to have gone\nwith him to get the tests. Other book-tests of mine,\nfrom a house which at the time I knew fairly well, and\nwhose occupant was a regular sitter with Mrs. Leonard,\nwere mainly failures. The average at my own vicarage\nis pretty good, but not so good as at the two houses\nmentioned above, I think.\nThere is one more statement of my communicator that\nI should like to quote, this being with regard to a diffi-\nculty that she says she finds in giving \" Impression \"\n\f103] \u2022 More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 565\ntests ;\nthough, if correct, it must, I think, apply equally\nto book-tests. At a sitting with Mrs. Leonard on\nJanuary 26, 1926, she said, tlirough Feda :\n\" You know I sometimes think there are more important\nthiags than I tell you, that are happening in the places\nwhere I go, but I have to tell you not only what I've\npicked up at the time, but what I can re-remember, re-\nremember.\" There ain't such a word, Dora !\n\" Yes ! I\ncall it that because it explams what I mean. What I\nremember when I come here again.\" She says, \" I have\nto remember the information in my own condition, my\nown condition. Then, I have to re-remember it in this\ncondition again,\" she says, \" and that's where the difficulty\nis,\" she says. \" Not at the picking it ujd\u2014not in the\nknowing it in my own condition\u2014but in bringing it through\nagain into your condition, and all our difficulties consist\nin that one operation.\"\nTo test the truth of this is not easy, but I have found\ntwo rather good instances, in my book-tests, of what look\nlike mistakes of tliis kind, mistakes due to failure of\nmemory. In the one case tests were given from two\ndifferent pages of a book which was said to be the fifth\nbook from the left on a certain shelf : they were fairly\ndefinite tests, but appropriate sentences were found not\nin that book, but in a book which was the fifth book\nfrom the right.\u2014One of these, however, was on the back\nof the page. In the other case a very definite test was\ngiven from the sixth book from the left in a certain\nsheK, and it was said also, \" Is there anything looking-\nlike a bird near to these books ? I wonder why she\nkeep showing me a picture of a Httle bird.\u2014It's something\nI think you'll notice v\/hile you're picking out these books.\nThe idea of a bird awful strongly.\"\nThere was nothing appropriate on the test page from\nthe sixth book from the left, on the shelf indicated\n\u2014\nbut there was on the sixth book from the left in the shelf\nabove, from which shelf a book-test had been given a feiv\nmoments before ;\nand, in addition to this, on the back of\nthe cover of the eleventh book from the left, on this\n\f566 Rev. W. S. Irving [part\nhigher shelf, was a Httle bird in gilt, just over half an\ninch in size from tip of beak to end of tail. Assuming\nthat these were the tests intended, the mistakes would\nseem to be due to lapse of memory on the part of the\ncommunicator.\n(5)\nOne of the most interesting problems that confronts\nus in connection with book-tests is the answer to the\nquestion \" When are they taken ?\n\" The communicators\ngenerally claim that they are prepared beforehand\u2014some-\ntimes a considerable time before the sitting at which\nthey are given ; but the communicators are, by the\ncircumstances of the case, unable to prove their point ; and\none has often had an luicomfortable feeling, while taking\ndown a book-test, that the medium may really be reading\noff the tests by direct clairvoyance as she gives them.\nIn three of my comparatively recent sittings, however,\nthere has been evidence that seems to corroborate the\nstatements of the communicators, and also to show know-\nledge of the surroundings of the books referred to at two\ndifferent periods.\nOn April 22, 1926, at a sitting with Mrs. Leonard, Dr.\nWoolley recording, an Institution was described which it\nwas said I should shortly visit. This I identified as the\nGloucester Infirmary. My wife was in her life interested\nin hospitals, and collected locally for the \" Gloucester\nRoyal Infirmary League.\"\nFeda then began a book-test which she said was from\nmy home in a room I am often in. \"There are some\nbooks but I don't feel many . . . the one complete\nrow . . . little bit higher than back of your chair.\" She\ncould not say whether it was a shelf, or the top of\nsomething the books have been put on ... \" something\nyou can open and shixt near them\u2014pull something in and\nout . . . not all the same size, and they don't quite\nmatch each other.\"\nThe description reminded me of books on the chest of\ndrawers in my bedroom ; and the identification was sup-\nported by Feda's later remarks about \" renewing wood,\"\n\f103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 567\nand my \" looking at the floor \" neiu' there. I now quote\nthe full script :\nFeda. Mr. Bill, you've altered them somehow. They\ndon't feel to her m the same order they were in\nbefore. And, Mr. Bill, do you know if somebody's took\nsome, and put them this way. [Feda illustrates hori-\nzontally.] Instead of straight up has someone put them\nlying on each other, because, she says, at the end she had\nsome difficulty in being sure how she should count. (It's\nnot the place, Feda.) And, she says, she felt that\neither someone had put them that way, or that they had\nslipped, but there's something that makes them very much\nout of their regular order\u2014not standing up quite straight.\nIt didn't matter very much, Mr. BiU, because she's been\nable to count, and she was careful not to take the first\ntwo. You'U see why dhectly you look at them again. . .\nNow the book she want you to take first is the fourth\nbook from the left. Open it the very beginning, and\nyou'll see there a description of, or aUusion to, a place\nwhich taUies, taUies, taUies, with what she said about the\nInstitution at the beginmng of the sitting. Renewmg\nwood, renewing wood. You've said something about\nrenewhig wood, renewing wood, just here. (Yes. I\nhave.) Wait a minute ! What have you been looking\nat the floor for 1 Dora couldn't see what you were\ndoing, but do you remember looking at the floor, or\nsomething very low down at the floor ? (Yes.) 'Cos\nthat's what she felt you were doing. . . .\nOn my return from London, on Saturday, April 24,\n1926\u2014two days before my visit to the Royal Infirmary\n\u2014\nI, at once, asked my house-keeper to go with me to my\nbedroom to witness the position of certain books on the\nchest of drawers in that room. This she did. I found\nthe books, just as I had left them, all standing upright.\nOn asking Mrs. Jones if she had moved any of the books\ndurmg my absence, she said \" No \"\n\u2014but on Tuesday,\nApril 20, the day after I left home, she had cleaned out\nthe room, and soon after she began to do so the books\nat the left-hand end had slipped down on top of each oth^r.\n\f568 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part\nShe said that as I had told her on no account to move\nany books during my absence, she had left them as they\nwere all the morning, while she had lunch, and till she\nhad finished the room in the afternoon, when she had\njiushed them ixp again into their original upright position.\nMrs. Jones is very vague about time, but, so far as I\ncan gather, the books were down from about 9.30 a.m.\ntill between 3.0 omcI 4 _p.m. on the same day.\nOn that day I had had another sitting with Mrs. Leonard\nin the afternoon.\nIn the centre of the chest of drawers is a work-basket\nof my wife's. To the left of this are the four books\nwhich slipped down. To the right of the work-basket are\nseven books. The fourth of these seven books, counting\nfrom the left, was Dear Enemy, by Jean Webster (Hodder\n& Stoughton). This was another of my wife's books,\nand, I think, rather a favourite of hers. I read it about\nseven years ago, and also most of the other books here.\nIn the early pages of this book a description of an Insti-\ntution is given corresponding at various points with the\ngeneral appearance of the Gloucester Infirmary, to which\nallusion had apparently been made earlier in the sitting.\nThe last point about \" renewing wood \" is quite clear.\nShortly before leaving home, I found that wood-worms\nhad got into a clothes-basket, which stands in a dressing-\nroom, five feet to the left of the chest of drawers. I\nexamined the floor and thought I found traces of them\nburrowing into the jd^^^^^^^s beneath the clothes-basket.\nI spoke to my house-keeper about this, and she took the\nmatter in hand while I was in town. I have, before,\nhad similar trouble in the boards in the passage, and a\nvague reference was, I think, made to it through Mi-s.\nW. Elliott in November, 1925. At my request, a neigh-\nbouring vicar\u2014Rev. W. T. Shaddock, Rector of Preston\n\u2014\ncame to my house on May 3, and questioned my house-\nkeeper about the books that slipped. His certificate,\nshowing the correctness of the details I have given about\nthis, is in the hands of the Editor of Proceedings.\nMy second case of a book-test containing evidence as\nto when it was taken occiirred at a sitting with Mrs.\n\f103] ilfore Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 569\nLeonard on September 20, 1926. The tests from the\nbook I need not give as, although appropriate sentences\nwere found in the places indicated, they were not especi-\nally striking. For the sake of brevity, I am also cutting\nout all material that is not essential to the understanding\nof the case.\nFeda. Mr. Bill has got a book not on a sheK at all ?\nOh dear ! Where has he got it ! . . . She keep on\nsaymg \" New book, new book.\" Then \" not read properly\nyet.\" She says ...\" I don't know whether you've read\nany of it . . . but it's a book that's in your possession,\nand you may know something, or have read something\nof it. I don't think you've read much, and you may\nhave read nothmg, but I want to show you I Imow\nsomething about it.\" . . . (Where is the book ? ) Not in\nany shelves at home. She feels it's chfferent\u2014by itself.\nHas it been taken away from others, and been put by\nitself ? . . . It's been carried recently, she says, like lifting m\nthe hand ... I don't thmk she knows where it is this\nminute, but you're gomg to get hold of it, and read it\nsoon. \" In a sense,\" she says, \" I've got to say its yours\nnow, though I don't thinli you've read it,\" she says.\nNot near other books, and \/ don't think she knows the\nspot it's in at the minute. (That's hvely !) . . . He [the\nsitter] says it's very hvely ! You're going to hold this\nbook in your hand, she is putting it in your hand, as if\nit will be put in your hands at once. (Can you answer a\nquestion ? Is it the Library book at home I haven't\nread, or is it the Library book I've taken out to-day ?) . . .\nIt's the first one\u2014not the second\u2014it is the first . . .\nThis book is given as a \" new book \" that had \" been\ntaken away from others,\" and \" been put by itself.\" I\nhad bought no new books of late, but on\u2014I think\n\u2014\nWednesday, September 1, that is four or five days before\nleaving home for my summer hohday, wlhch I was still\nenjoying\u2014I had changed my Library books at \" Boots\n\"\nin Gloucester, and brought home two books. They were\nboth \" A \" Class\u2014that is newly published books. One of\nthese I had read before leaving home\u2014the other I had\n\f570 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part\nnot. This latter book seemed to be indicated. It was\nTlie Secret of the Ashes by Alfred Ornstien (Hutchinson &\nCo., Ltd.). I may have opened the book and read a page\nor so\u2014not more. I am not sure of tliis. When I read\nthe book after my return from London nothing seemed\nfamiliar except the name \" Malcolm \" on page one. This\nbook I lent to a friend\u2014I think the day after I got it.\nThursday, September 2. He returned it on Sunday\nnight, September 5, while I was preparing for my early\ndeparture next morning. The book was probably put\non a table in my dining-room then.\nOn my return home on September 25th, I looked for\nthe book, and could not find it. On asldng my house-\nkeeper if she had seen it, she said that on Tviesday,\nSeptember 7\u2014the day after my departure\u2014the friend\nmentioned above had called to make some repairs to my\nwireless set that he had promised to make, and had gone\noff with two books. She did not know what they were.\nI went across to his house, therefore, and- asked if he\nhad borrowed a Library book of mine, and he replied\nthat while looking at my wireless set he had seen this\nbook near it which he had returned before, and had taken\nit for his wife to finish. He had only taken one book,\nand he gave it back to me then.\nIf I interpret the evidence rightly, the communicator\ntook the test wliile the book was in my house before I\nleft home\u2014that is at least fourteen days before the\nsitting. She went back to refresh her memory by\nverifying it before the sitting, as she would seem to have\nalso done with the former test, and found that the book\nwas gone.\nMy last case, of the same kind, was given at a sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard, three days later, on Sej)tember 23,\n1926. The tests were from books on the chest of drawers in\nmy bedroom again. After describing the place Feda said :\nShe doesn't suppose that you would have such a\nthing on the shelf, couldn't have, and yet it was while\nshe was standing by it that she felt it, Mr. Bill, very\nstrongly\u2014A bowl, bowl, bowl. . . . She didn't see it, Mr.\nBill, but she got the idea \" bowl \" strongly. She thinks\n\f103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 571\nthat you'll see what she means directly you look at it\n\u2014\nbowl, bowl.\nFeda then gave the tests.\nAt the time of the sitting I could think of nothing\nlike a bowl that would be likely to be near the chest\nof drawers. On questioning my house-keeper, however,\nshe said that after I had left home she found that I\nhad left a large brealtfast-cup full of water on the dressing\ntable which is just over a foot to the right of the chest\nof drawers. It was, probably, where she found it from\nlate on Sunday evening, September 5, or early on\nMonday morning, September 6, till about 11.30 a.m. of\nthe latter day. The weak point, in this test, as fixing\nthe time when this book-test was taken, is, of course,\nthat the presence of the breakfast-cup must, presumably,\nhave been known to my subconscious mind\u2014which may\nhave influenced the sitting. On the other hand, it falls\nin line with the other two tests, and may well be from\nthe same source.\n\u2022 (6)\nThe question of the influence, on sittings, exercised by\nthe note-taker should be worth studying. Frequent\nchange of note-takers is detrimental to any series of\nsittings\u2014but that is obvious. What is less easy to learn\nis the kind of note-taker with whom the best results\nmay be obtained. For a suggestion as to this I am\nindebted to Mrs. Leonard. I had written to her in\nSeptember, 1924, with regard to my next sitting, and said\nthat I was bringing my usual note-ttiker Mrs. Leonard,\nin reply, said, \" Am so glad you will be able to bring . . .\non Nov. 19. She brings a good condition. People who\nhave the gift of accuracy are always helpful in a\nsitting. I would rather have a sceptical accurately-\nminded sitter than a careless-minded one who was credu-\nlous. The first would be the easier. That's why most\nof the S.P.R. people are such good sitters, I suppose.\"\nI have obtained Mrs. Leonard's permission to quote the\nabove. With this in mind, I have examined my past\n\f572 Rev. W. 8. Irving\u2014Trance Phenomena [part\n\" Leonard \" sittings. A large number of these have been\nrecorded by Mrs. Dingwall who has most kindly given\nmuch time to helping me in this way ;\nbut, at one time\nand another, nine people have taken notes for me at\nthese sittings. I find that Mrs. Leonard's suggestion\nseems to be justified by a study of the Scripts\u2014so far\nas they go. The sittings recorded by Mrs. Dingwall,\nDr. Woolley (who has recently helped me in this way at\ntwo sittings) and Mrs. Savy (one) show a higher percent-\nage of accuracy in tests\u2014so far as I can gather\u2014than\ndo most of the others. Mrs. Savy is foreign corre-\nspondent and tyjiist to a member of a City firm, and is\ncertainly gifted with accuracy ; she is not a spiritualist.\nWith regard to sittings with other mediums, it does not\nseem possible to come to any definite decision, as to the\ninfluence exercised on them by the note-taker, as the\nquality of the sittings is more variable. According to\nFeda, it is not wise to act as note-taker, if one wishes\nto have good sittings oneself. This belief of hers is not\neasy to test, but it is, I think, worth noting. At a\nsitting of mine on January 25, 1927, Feda remarked :\nI don't get such good sittings for people who are note-\ntakers. I do for a time, and then something wears out\n\u2014\nlike boots. . . . It's something in her brain\u2014in Gladys' brain.\nSomething, you know, that I can't quite separate ; and\nwhen I get back to a note-taker, I get something in her\nbrain that keeps jumping over\u2014back to the sitting that\nhe used to take notes for . . . She wouldn't beheve it\nmade any difference for a long time ;\nbut, Mr. Bill, using\nanyone's brain for a long time is like a bicycle\u2014you've\ngot to steer him. It's just as if it's fastened to something\nto do with the sitting, and it gets pulled over the wrong\nway.\n\f103] Review 573\nREVIEW.\nThe Case of Patience Worth : A Critical Study of Certain Unusual\nPhenomena. By Walter Franklin Prince. Boston Society\nfor Psychic Research. Boston, 1927. Tp. 509.\nTo students of Psychical Research the case of \" Patience Worth \"\nwill not be entirely unfamiliar. The first accounts of it, by\nMr. C. S. Yost, a St. Louis journalist, appeared in Mr. Henry\nHolt's Unpojmlar Review so far back as 1915, and in 1916\nappeared his Patience Worth : a Psychic Mystery, while a number\nof her tales and selections from her poems have also been\npublished by the Patience Worth Publishing Co. and in the\nPatience Worth Magazine, which existed for a time. But Dr.\nWalter Prince has j^roduced the first comprehensive study by an\nexpert hand of what is certainly one of the most remarkable and\ninteresting cases of automatic writing hitherto recorded.\nThe story runs as follows. In the summer of 1913 Mrs. Pearl\nLenore Curran was induced by her friend Mrs. Hutchings to join\nher in experimenting with a ouija board, and almost at once\ncommunications came from \" Patience Worth,\" who professed to\nhave been an English girl, born in Dorset and killed by Indians\nin America in 1694 (or 1649), and who wrote in an archaic and\nvery distinctive and pungent English style, utterly different from\nthe colloquial American of the Middle West, which was, it seems,\nthe only language normally known to Mrs. Curran. For Mrs.\nCurran had left school at the age of fourteen, and never studied\nor manifested any interest or aptitude for literature. \" Patience,\"\non the other hand, could write in a variety of styles, poetic,\naphoristic, rustic, narrative, ancient and modern, without giving\nherself away in any glaring way, and while always giving the\nimpression of a very vivid personality. She imj^rovises poems on\nany suggested subject on request, and dictates her tales as fast\nas they can be recorded. Her original mode of communication\nthrough a ouija board has long been discarded, and her messages\n\f574 Review [part\nare now spoken by Mrs. Ciirran, who simultaneously sees pictorial\nimagery representing their contents. It is, however, admitted that\nthis method sometimes leads to interference by Mrs. Curran's\nconsciousness with the automatisms.\nThere is nothing then in their mode of production that renders\nthe \" Patience Worth \" messages remarkable. Their claims rest\nentirely on their contents, which seem very definitely to transcend\nthe powers of Mrs. Curran's mind. That this is really the case\nDr. Prince seems, pretty completely, to establish, by printing an\nautobiography and a paper by Mrs. Curran, and by the testimonies\nof a number of witnesses who knew her before she became an\nautomatist. He also cross-examined her as to her general and\nhistorical knowledge, and found depths of ignorance compatible\nenough with her education, but not with the extensive and peculiar\nknowledge displayed in \" Patience's \" historical romances. For ex-\nample, she supposed that Henry VIII. had had his head cut off (as no\ndoubt he deserved), thought that Daniel Webster \" made the dic-\ntionary,\" knew nothing about Andrew Jackson, and did not think\nshe had ever read a chapter of the Bible through (p. 18). Her own\nlife, moreover, had been confined to the Middle West. She had never\nseen the sea, and had never been east or north of Chicago nor\nwest or south of Fort Worth, Texas, when \" Patience Worth\n\"\narrived.\nIn sj)ite of these limitations she has somehow contrived to\nproduce a literary output estimated at 3,000,000 words, which,\nthough varying with the subject, was all written in unexceptionable\nEnglish English, and carried through consistently. It is certainly\nimpressive to be told (pp. 359-60) that one of her tales, Telka,\nextending to 60-70,000 words, exhibits a vocabulary \"as to 90 per\ncent, of Anglo-Saxon origin,\" and contains \" no word of later entry\ninto the language than 1600,\" except \" amuck \" (which is first\nrecorded in the second half of the seventeenth century), and no\nword wrongly formed among those which are not on record.\nWhen we are told further that the Authorized Version has only\n77 per cent, of Anglo-Saxon, and that it is necessary to go back\nto Layamou (1205) to equal Patience Worth's percentage, we\nrealize that we are face to face with what may fairly be called a\nphilological miracle.\nThe literary value of Patience Worth's writings is not so\nsusceptible of exact calculation, and opinions are more likely\nto differ ;\nstill, not only Dr. Prince but other good judges\n\f103] Review 575\nhave not hesitated to use the word \" genius \" in describing-\nit. I am not sure that I should like to go so far ; but what\nwriter need be ashamed of bits of proverbial philosophy Hke\n\" beat the hound and lose the hare,\" \" it taketh a wise man\nto be a good fool,\" \" a basting but toughens an old goose,\"\n\" nimble words are not nimble wits,\" \" wisdom patches the seat\nof learning,\" and \" give me not wisdom enough to understand the\nuniverse but folly enough to tolerate it \" ?\nSuch being the problem presented by the case of \" Patience\nWorth,\" what shall be said of its solution 1 There are obviously\nthree hypotheses to be considered, in the way of each of which\nthe case puts specific obstacles. (1) The spirit-possession theory is\nundoubtedly the one most immediately suggested ;\nbut even those\nmost free from prejudice against it may well feel that this case\ngoes considerably further than any that has so far been recorded,\nand seems too good to be true. Never before has a \" spirit\n\"\nfound such complete and unobstructed expression through a\n\" medium \"\n; never before has a \" spirit \" given such convincing\nproofs of the reality of progress in the spirit-world, as those\nwhich have turned \" Patience Worth \" from an illiterate servant\ngirl of the seventeenth century into the literary character of the\ntwentieth. If she is indeed a spirit she must be congratulated\non her success in surmounting difficulties which have baffled many\nmore pretentious communicators.\n(2) The next alternative is to credit \" Patience Worth \" to the\nsubconsciousness of Mrs. Curran, and to regard her as a secondary\npersonality, in spite of the present lack of direct evidence in\nsupport of this attribution. This hypothesis would not seem quite\nso fantastic if psychologists had been more careful to record and\nemphasize the intellectual performances of which the subconscious\nappears to be capable. It may be objected that \"Patience\nWorth \" goes definitely beyond anything on record ;\nstill, the\ncomposition of Kubla Khan and Jehyll and Hyde, and the dis-\ncovery of \" Verner's Law,\" were no mean achievements. And on\nthe principle of omne ignotum pro magnifico it may be possible so\nto extend the powers of the unconscious as to cover the case of\n\"Patience Worth.\"\n(3) Once started on the path of hypothetical extensions of per-\nsonality some philosophers are loth to stop till they have reached\nthe Absolute. We must, therefore, be prepared for suggestions\nthat the\n\" Patience Worth \" literature is an authentic revelation\n\f576 Review [PAET 103]\nof the Absolute, or perhaps has somehow trickled through from\nsome \" cosmic reservoir \" which has pooled the literary efforts of\nthe ages. In its second form this theory manifestly overlooks\nthe problem of selection ; in its first, it involves the further\ndifficulty that \" Patience Worth \" is a revelation of a very much more\nhumorous Absolute than its philosophers have ever led us to\nexpect. If the reply to this be that all finite personality must\nin any case be a selection from the Absolute, we must retort\nthat it proves too much, and that if \" Patience Worth \" be a\nselection from the Absolute, so is every one else, and that there-\nfore, so far as this argument goes, she is as good a \" spirit \" as\nany!\nWhat, then, shall we do ? I suppose that at present it is still\nsafer to credit \" Patience Worth \" to the unconscious and to\nclass her, officially, as Mrs. Curran's \" secondary self.\" But it is\nimpossible to be comfortable about this theory, and it should\ncertainly not be held fanatically. And, personally, I am quite\nwilling to subscribe to Dr. Prince's conclusion that \" either our\nconcept of what we call the subconscious must he radically altered,\nso as to include potencies of which we hitherto have had no know-\nledge, or else some cause operating through but not originating in the\nsubconsciousness of Mrs. Curran must be acknowledged.\" The general\nimpression of the case on my mind is to deepen the conviction\nthat orthodox psychology and orthodox j)hilosophy are both very\nfar from having plumbed the depths of the soul, and, that it is\nunreasonable to require an open-minded man to endorse their\nprejudices.
