Perhaps some of our members may be induced to become\ncompetitors.\nBetween certain persons, and specially among the members of a\nfamily or persons who are constant companions, there has been found\nto exist sometimes the faculty of the direct transference of impressions\nfrom one mind to another without the intervention of the ordinary\nchannels of sense. To ascertain to what extent this faculty exists the\nabove prizes are offered.\nThose who wish to. compete are recommended to commence tho\nexperiments as a pastime, as this method conduces best to success. Let\none person be blindfolded and touch hands with another person who is\nsteadfastly looking at some object, and presently, if he or she possesses\nthe faculty in question, the image of the object so regarded may\ngradually emerge into peculiar distinctness. Th~ objects to be experi.\nmented with should be simple in shape and distinct in colour, such as\npieces of coloured ribbon or paper cut into a variety of shapes, letters,\nor playing-cards, &c. They should be exhibited on a plain white or\nblack background, well illuminated, aud should be so placed as not to\nbe seen with other things at the same time.\nWhen it is discovered that anyone possesses the power, then the\nexperiment should be repeated without contact, and, if still successful,\nconditions should be imposed which absolutely exclude the possibility\nof even unconscious perception of the object through any recognised\nchannel of sense. The most perfect experiment, and that insisted\nupon for the prize competition, is thus arranged. The percipient is\nseated on a chair, blindfolded, all mirrors or reflecting surfaces being\nDigitized by Google\n\fU4 Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. [June, 1881.\nremoved or covered up. The agent or operator leaves the room and\ndraws very distinctly in black crayon upon a piece of paper, say 6 by\n4, an outline or diagram of not too complex a character, and, bringing\nit into the room enclosed in a small folio, places it upon a screen behind\nthe percipient. The operator then takes his seat in front of the\ndiagram, which is now exposed to view, and announces that he is\nready. Silence is maintained while the willer or agent concentrates\u00b7\nhis gaze upon the diagram, until the percipient announces that he or she\nthinks the correct impression has been received. Upon this the folio\nis closed, the percipient is freed from the blindfolding, and supplied\nwith a piece of papel\" and crayon pencil, with which the impression\nproduced on the mind is recorded.\nThe result may afford adequate evidence of thought-transference\nwithout being an exact reproduction; sometimes the reproduction is\ntransposed from right to left, or sometimes, if the diagram is complex,\npart only is produced or the parts are put together differently.\nWhatever the result may be, a memorandum should be made on the\ndrawings of the conditions of the experiment,-date, names of experi-\nmenters, with or without contact, length of time, &c., and also of any .\nremarks made by the percipient during the experiment. The agent\nshould maintain silence, but if he should say anything this also should\nbe recorded. Corresponding numbers should be placed upon the\noriginal and reproduction. If different distances are tried, these also\nshould be recorded.\nThe experiments should not be so long continued lIor so frequently\nrepeated as to cause fatigue.\nIt is desirable that some scientific friend should be called in early\nin the case of successful experiments, so as to secure that no essential\ncondition is overlooked.\nNo public use will be made of the names of the competitors without\nconsent.\nPrizes of .\u00a310 each will be given for the 10 best sets of 10 drawings,\nproduced as described, in one or two sittings; but it is an essential\ncondition that the competitors should show the same ability to the\nsatisfaction of one or two gentlemen who will be appointed to test the\ncapacity of the competitors. Should less than 20 persons compete,\nthe number of prizes given will be reduced to one-half the number of\nthe competitors.\nThe drawings must be sent in by July 15th, and will be adjudicated\nupon before August 1st.\nAddress, ALPHA, R.

P.\n1885.\nIt was in the year 1870, in the month of February, that I took as a\nfurnished house No.4, -square, Brighton. I occupied it with my widowed\nfriend, Mrs. F--t, and three children of my own, four, five, and six years\nrespectively.\nMrs. F--t slept in the top front bedroom (second floor), and after she\nhad occupiE'd the room for two or three months, she complained of being\nannoyed by a feeling of some one leaning over her bed, and breathing close\nto her, which caused her to wake up suddenly and put out her hand to see if\nanyone was there. The child, too, who slept with her later on, and who of\ncourse was put to bed early, used to wake from her sleep crying bitterly and\ndeclaring that she saw \"angel!!\" and heard \"rattlings.\" The child told me\nthis whell I went up to comfort her one evening. My friend, Mrs. F--t,\ntoo (who is a woman of strong physique and good common-sense), told me\nthat she was annoyed in passing upstairs in the dusk (there was no gaB in\nthe upper part of the house) by feeling herRelf frequently pushed forcibly aside\nby some one or some thing, for whom she had to make way. At last she\nbecame so nervous from disturbed nights and broken sleep, that she gave up\nsleeping in that bedroom, and came down and slept with me in the room\nbelow, and the child was put to sleep with one of the servants, and the room\nwas only used by Mrs. F--t as a dressing-room: About this time, while\nI was away from borne, Mrs. F--t wa~ disturbed by hearing sounds as if the\nservants were entertaining some friends in the drawing-room below, laughter\nand clatter of forks, &c. She said nothing to me, as she did not wish to make\nmischief, and left me to find them out for myself. 011 my return we were\nsleeping together in the room below (on the first floor), when we were awoke\nalmost simultaneously between 12 and 1 p.m. by a great noise pro-\nceeding from the drawing-room below, on\u00b7 the ground floor-sounds of\ntalking and laughter, the jingling of glasses, the rattling of plates, and of\nchairs being moved about, as if the servants were entertaining a supper-\nparty, which in fact was what we thought. The sounds were most distinct,\nand we could not be mistaken; they certainly did not proceed from the next\nhouse. We put on our dressing-gowns ill haste and went down stairs together,\nto find the drawing-room ill darkness and solitude as we left it! About the\nsame time Mrs. F--t and I were sitting one evening in the back drawing-\nroom, OIl a still summer evening, with the window (not a casement) open, and\nnot a breath of air stirring, when it was suddenly and violently shaken, the\nnoise produced being very considerable.* We looked at one another in\nastonishment, and left the room at once to see if the servants were in the\nroom above or below, but found them sitting in the front kitchen, having\nheard nothing. The road at the back was at some distance from the house.\n*Mrs. B. illustrated the noise by shaking the window in her sitting-room\nforcibly with her hands.-F. P.\nDigitized by Google\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1887.\nI must now tell you that there was a small room at the top of the house-\nsecond floor front-which the proprietor of it had locked up. And as an old\nfriend and school-fellow was coming to stay with me in June, and be married\nfrom my house, I needed every available room, and applied to my landlady\nfor the use of it. She demwrred very much, saying she had boxes stored there,\nand needed the room; but after much pressing, she was obliged to give way.\nTo our astonishment, when we unlocked the room, we found it empty, save\nfor one or two old trunks which occupied no space whatever. The wedding\ntook place in due time, &c., and afterwards (in September or October, r\u00b7\nthink) my friend, Mrs. F--t, went away on a visit, leaving me alone in the\nhouse with the servants and children. It was while my friend was absent\nthat I was going upstairs one night to bed, with candle in my hand, when\nstanding in the open doorway in front of me (which led into the bedroom\nbeside mine and immediately under the shut room) I saw distinctly a man\nstanding looking at me. The only light was from my candle; the square\nwas very badly lighted so that no light came through the window. He was\na tall, dark man, dressed in a grey suit, with heavy dark beard and\nmoustache; and at first I thought that he was some strange man who had\nbeen surreptitiously introduced by the servants, anti my first expression was,\nI am afraid, not ladylike, for I exclaimed, \"Hulloa !\" anrl walked straight\nup to him, intending to ask him who he was and what he was doing there.\nHe never moved, and by some unaccountable impulse I walked 8traight\nthrough him, into the room. When I turned and looked, he was gone! and\nI found myself trembling from head to foot. I sat down on the bed to\nrecover myself and to consider what had happened, and at first thought of\ncalling the servants; but on consideration did not do so, as I thought they\nmight laugh at me. I longed to go down for some brandy, but did not dare;\nand after a while I summoned up courage to creep into my room, which was\nnext door. I then locked the door (contrary to my usual custom) and passed\nthe night undisturbed, sleeping soundly. I am naturally a very courageous\nwoman, and Dlay say I hardly know what fear is, and my sensation was more\none of astonishment, nor did I up till that time place the smallest belief in\n\" ghosts.\" When I woke next morning, and upon calm reflection considered\nwhat I had seen the night before, I began to think I must only have had an\noptical illusion. But I have never on any other occasion been the subject of\na hallucination either of sight or sound. The next night I went up to bed\nas usual, when, to my surprise, I saw him again, standing where he stood\nthe night before.. This time I called the two servants from below, and they\ncame up behind me, and I asked them if they saw anything there, but they\nanswered, \"No!\" I saw the figure, however, the whole time. Saying no\nmore to them, I sent them down stairs again, and passed right by him,\nleaving him standing in the doorway, into my room, and locked the door\nbehind me. Each night for a whole week I saw him at the same door, till I\nbecame quite accustomed to him, aud felt inclined to speak, and ask him\nwhat he wanted, but dreaded lest he should raise his arm. The figure u\"ver\nmoved, however. After this he disappeared, and I myself never saw him again,\nalthoJlgh we remained in the house six mouths after or more. When M1'I!.\nF--t returned, I told her what I had seen, and we agreed to keep it quite\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1887.)

But after\nfurther discussion we determined to tell the landlady that we lcnew her house\nto be haunted. So on going next time to pay the rent, a friend went with\nme, and we agreed to watch the effect of the tidings upon the landlady. So\nafter a few preliminary remllrks, I said, \"I think, Miss P., you should have\ntold me that your house was haunted,\" and she started visibly, and ex-\nclaimed, \"Oh! so you have seen him, have you 1\" She further said that if\nshe had told anyone she would never have let the house, and said that if we had\nkept that room locked we should not have been troubled. We had a friend,\nMrs. F---r, living at No.7, three rloorsoff from us, with whom we were very\nintimate, and we told her about all we had seen and heard, when she remarked\nimmediately, \"Why, that's my ghost! \" and told us that she and her children\nand servants had all seen precisely the same man. They seemed to be quite\nfamiliar with him. This puzzled us much; but we soon learnt--I can't now\nremember from whom I heard thie-that the four houses at the top end of the\nsquare had originally been one; that the square had once had a very bad\nname, and that the block of houses had once belonged to the Rothschilds,\nand that grass had grown, through neglect, in the middle of the square.\nA few months later this same lady let her house and came and lived with\nme for a month; and as she was accustomed to the ghost I gave her the room in\nwhich he had appeared, as a sitting-room. One evening, in the dusk, before\nthe lamps were lit, in November, a young Australian gentleman *- (Irish by\nbirth), a friend of hers, called to see her; and as I occupied the drawing-\nroom, I sent him up to her sitting-room to await her. He had not been\nthere many minutes before he came running down to me in the drawing-\nroom, looking as pale as a sheet, exclaiming, \"For God's sake give\nme some brandy!\" I said. \"Why, what's up 1\" \"and he said, as he\nthrew himself on the sofa, \" I've seen your ghost.\" He said he had been up\nin the sitting-room waiting for the lady, and was leaning out of the window,\ndrumming on the window-sill, when he felt a draught of cold air, and\nlooking round he expected to see Mrs. B., when, to his surprise, he saw a\nman standing inside the doorway, dressed in grey, and with his head lowered\nforward and a horrid sneer upon his face. It disappeared directly, and he\nhad then run downstairs in a great fright to me (as described). On another\noccasion, when I was away from home, Captain T., of the Guards, who was a\nmesmerist, and a great friend of Home (the Spiritualist), was calling on my\nfriend, Mrs. F--r; they were sitting chatting in the drawing-room, when\nhe turued suddenly pale and said, \" I am sure there is a spirit in this house! \"\nHe had been told about the house. After I had left the house it was let to\nsome people from Ryde, Isle of Wight, who only stayed in it six months\nbecause no one could sleep in the top room.t The lady who occupied the\nhouse three doors off, and who had also seen the same figure, told me she had\nseen it twice. On the first occasion she awoke on a bright moonlight night,\nfeeling strange, and on sitting up in bed distinctly saw, reflected in a large\ncheval glasswhich faced herbed at the foot, the same figure as I did, but slightly\n*-Believed to be in Australia now.\nt Mr. C. Godfrey went over the house in Christmas, 1883. The house was\nthen a lodging-house, but no lodgers were in it.-F.

The window\nwas close to the head of the bed, and she immediately jumped out of bed, and\ndrew aside the blind to see if anyone could be there. But nothing was to be\nseen, and the window was BOme height from the ground, wit,h a deep kind of\narea and high wall at the back. On another occasion she had been having\nlunch in her dining-room on the ground fioor, and on going upstairs she\npassed the drawing-room door, which was open, and saw apparently a gentle-\nman in a grey suit of clothes sitting near the window, with his head half\nturned away. He had dark hair and beard, and seemed to be waiting. She\nwent into her bedroom for a minute or two and then entered the drawing-\nroom, expecting to see a visitor; but the room was perfectly empty, and on\nquestioning the servant she found no one hadcalled. The hall door could not\nbe opened from the outside. An old servant who lived with her at one time\nsaid that she, like Mrs. F--t in my house, had met something on the stairs\nwhen going up or down in the dusk or early morning that she had to make\nway for. Another servant, a young widow, who slept in the basement, rushed\nup to her mistnss's bedroom one night when the latter was going to bed, in\nher nightdress and half beside \u00b7herself with fright. She declared she was\nkneeling up in bed, saying her prayers, with her hands clasped, in the dark,\nand someone took hold of her hands and tried to unclasp them, twice. She\nwas then so terrified that she jumped out of bed and ran to the door, which\nwas not previously locked, but on trying to open it it seemed to be held\nfrom the other side. She pulled at it in vain for a minute or two, but on her\nuttering a prayer it suddenly yielded and she rushed up to her mistress's\nroom. She would not stay in the house a day longer. On another oCl.'asion,\none of this lady's sons, a fine intelligent boy of about 12, was ill with\nmeasles; his mother was in the drawing-room, but had left the doors open so\nthat she might hear if he called for anything. At last he called out loudly,\nand on his mother going up, he said, \"Mother, do turn out that horrid man,\nhe has been standing there sneering at me.\" The boy described the same\nfigure we had both seen, and said he was leaning against the chest of drawers,\nrather stooping, and B1!eering at him. His mother did not see the figure on\nthis occasion.\nIn answer to our inquiries, Mrs. B. adds:-\n27th March, 1885.\nI had the account of what she, her boy, and the servants saw, &c., from\nMrs. F--r's own lips. Never said anything of it to her son or the\nservants.\nFrom Mrs. F--t.\nThe sensations I am about to relate occurred to me when I was living\nwith my friend Mrs. B., at No.4, --square, Brighton, in the year 1870-71.\nI was given a room, which we called the front room, at the top of the house\nand it was next to the little room afterwards opened. I had been a widow\nnearly 20 months, but still there were times when I felt very lonely and\ndisturbed, as I had been a constant nurse and companion to a sick husband\nboth night and day, so that when I was first awakened by the feeling of some\none breathing over me, and hearing a sort of whisper, I used to sit up and\nsay\" yes,\" calling my hUl\\band by name, and ask, \"do you want anything 7\"\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune,1887.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 119\nthen when I was quite awake I felt I must push something away that was\nleaning over me, a dark masso-then or afterwards I never saw any distinct\nobject. This went on for some two months or so, then I began to get ill,\nout of sorts, as I never went to bed without feeling I should not get a good\nnight's rest, but I put it all down to the unhappy state of my mind. At last I\ncould stand it no longer, so told Mrs. B. I could not sleep by myself, and it\nwas then I used to go down to her bed every night. In April, I think it; was,\nMrs. B. went to stay with an old schoolfellow, and she left her children,\nservants, and house in my charge. After a little while the youngest child\ntook cold, and I had ht'r downstairs in Mrs. B.'s room to nurse. For three\ndays she was in danger, and I never left her, and used to go to bed soon\nafter 9 O'clock, so as to have the room shut up, and not to disturb the child.\nAs I was very tired I fell off to sleep with the child in my arms, when\nsuddenly I was awoke by loud talking, and the clatter of plates, knives and\nforks. I turned to look at the clock, and saw it was nearly 12. The servants\noUl\/ht to have been in bed an hour before, but as the child was sleeping, I\ndid not move. Again, when the child was nearly well, the same noise was\nrepeated a.bout the same time of nigbt. I thought to myself tha.t I must tell\nMrs. B. when she comes home that her servants have been taking advantage\nof her absence. However, when she did return, I changed my mind, for both\nthe servants had been very attentive to me, and had helped me in every way in\nnursing the little girl. It was after Mrs. B.'s return that the little room was\nopened. I wasaway for months on and off, but when I returned in the following\nJanuary, in a very happy state of mind at the iol'.IIo of our all being together\nagain, I was taking some of my small belongings up to the top front room,\nwhen on reaching the last flight of stairs I had to push past a mass of\nheaviness, and was stopped by knocking my nose against the wall, at which\nI laughed and thought myself very stupid. The next sensation was when I\nwas sleeping with my friend, and we both awoke at the same moment, when\nshe said, \"Did you hear 1\" and I said, \" Yes, it's those servants again, let us go\ndown and catch them.\" We went down, as my friend has related, and saw\nnothing; we only looked at one another and returned upstairs aDd got\ninto bed without speaking, to the best of my recollection. The only\nother time I can mention was when I brought an old lady friend from\nLondon who wanted a change, and as I knew Mrs. B. was away from home,\nand would have no objection, I asked her to come down with me, which she\ndid, but on condition that I would sleep in the next room to her, which\nhappened to be the very room in which the grey man, as we afterwards\n-called him, was seen by Mrs. B. some months later. I can truly say I\nnever went to slet'p in that little room until 4 or 5 in the morning, though at\nthat time no one, to our knowledge, knew that the house was haunted; I\nalways, during the 10 nights I occupied that room, felt as if I \"hould be-\n.smothered if I did go to sleep. After that time I stayed a great deal with\nfriends in London and elsewhere, and it was during that time that my friend\nwrote and told me that she had seen a ghost, and when we met in September\nI told her for the first time of all my sensations. We did not use the top\n-front room after that time, but turned a sitting-room into a bedroom, so\n-that I and Mrs. B. slept on the same floor, being the two rooms over the\nDigitized by Google\n\f120 JOU1'nal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1881.\ndining and drawing rooms. The little girl, though wishing to sleep with me\nwhen I used the top front room, always began to cry and say, \"May I stop\nwith the others until auntie comes up to bed 7\" and when the room was Ull-\noccupied, in the twilight the two eldest children used to say, \"Do come\n. upstairs and see Katie's angels and coloured lights,\" but we could never get\nanything out of the litt-Ie one, but that she did not like to be in the room by\nherself because there were lights on the ceiling, and the windows used to\nshake. I remember there was a horrid old brindled cat in the house, and\nit used to fly about the place and never go out beyond the yard with a very\nhigh wall all round; it never made friends with any of us, and after the\nlittle room at the top of the house was opened it disappeared altogether.\nIt used to sit and moan on the stairs and behave as I never heard or saw a\ncat before or since. CAROLINE F---T.\n.April 6th, 1885.\nIn answer to inquiries, Mrs. F--t stated that she had read Mrs. B.'s\naccount (printed above) before writing her own. She declined to state\nwhether she had experienced any other hallucination.\nMrs. B. stated that she had not experienced any other hallucination.\nIt is feared that it will not be possible to trace Mrs. F--r.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nPROFESSIONAL MEDIUMSHIP.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR,--I wish to make a few remarks with regard to the possibility of\ninvestigation of \"Phenomenal Spiritualism,\" and to point out (I) some\ndifficulties that are likely to befall the scientific or serious inquirer, under\nthe present circumstances, and with so few opportunities afforded to him;\n(2) some striking incongruities on the part of seance-room\" spirits\" in general;\nand (3) the incompetency of the average Spiritualist as regards the observa-\ntion and verification of the various phenomena and usual occurrences which\nmay be witnessed in the presence of mediums.\nThe recent controversy in the Jowrnal on the BUbject of \"Physical\nPhenomena\" will, I think, induce many members of the Society to\npersonally investigate these mysteries. It is especially to those that my\nremarks are addressed. I must confess that my experience was obtained\nalmost exclusively in London, and that consequently I may have missed the\nopportunity of witnessing more conclusive phenomena which may occur in\nother localities. Whether my remarks will also apply to the \"spirits\"\nmanifesting with mediums in other countries is more than I dare affirm just\nnow; for, it may be that matters look different and brighter elsewhere.\nHowever, since the headquarters of the Society for Psychical Research are,\nlike the majority of its members, established in London, the principal work\nof systematic research will have to be carried out within a radius of seven\nmiles from Charing Cross. It may, perhaps, be of some advantage that for\nthis very reason my evidence is likely to be more readily verifiable.\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1887.] Joul'nal of Society for P8'!Jchical Research. 121\nThere may be some difficulty just at present for the inquirer to get\nadmission to seances for physical manifestations, because at the few seances\nnow held in London only confirmed believers are admitted. In most cases,\nhowever, the inquirer will be welcome if introduced by a Spiritualist known to\nthe medium, upon his declaration that he is prepared to believe in the\nreality of the phenomena which occur ill the medium's presence. But even\nwhen admitted, the inquirer has no alternative but to either allow himself\nto be converted, on the spot, or to submit himself to considerable loss\nof time lind othel\" annoyances. There are two ways open to him: to believe\nfrom the literature on the subject that may have come into his hands or from\nthe statements made by Spiritualists; or to patiently wait until he has\naccumulated sufficient evidence to judge for himself. He cannot, as a\nneophyte, propose tests and experiments because he is supposed not to\nentertain any doubts as regards the nature and origin of the phenomena.\nShould he succeed in\u00b7 gaining the confidence of the medium and circle, and,\nafter his more or less regular attendance at these seances, be allowed to\nintroduce a test experiment, conducted upon common-sense principles, ht'\u00b7\nwill find that the results do but partly satisfy his object in view, or that the\nexperiment fails in toto.\nAs a mle, the excuses made by the circle are to the effect that probably\nthe conditions were unfavourable, or that the medium was not very well that\nevening, or the\" power\" was used up. A promise is given that the inquirer's\nrequest will be attended to on a future occasion. He is kept in prolonged\nsu~pense until at some remote period the ligid test is actually repeated. If\nit succeeds to some extent-(for it never succeeds in all respects to prove the\nillterventim~ 0\/ spirits of deceased human beirtgs)-more experiments are\nnecessary; but no matter how often a test may be introduced, there will be\nalways some discrepancy one way or another. In most cases, however, tht'\u00b7\nresults are nil or they point in the direction of trickery. I know of not a\nsingle case where results obtained were of a convincing nature unless tht'\nexperimenter was at least a little on his way to become a believer in the\nSpiritualist's theories. Here, it will be seen, lies a very grave difficulty which\nentirel), blocks the avenue to conviction upon reasonable terms. The\nexperiment fails-and the failure is attributed to the inquirer's sceptical or\nantagonistic attitude. The scientific investigator wishes to be convinced of\nthe tmth of the assertion that the phenomena are real and produced by, or\nthrough the intervention of, \"spirits,\" and for this he requires absolute\ndemonstrable facts; yet he cannot obtain the facts because his mind is so\nconstituted as to entertain no reasonable ground for a belief in either the\n\"spirits\" or the facts! This may seem an anomaly, but in the investigation\nof spiritualistic phenomena it is nevertheless a truism that success depends\nupon faith. It is much to be regretted that, under such circumstances,\nSpiritualists should ever have called upon\" Science\" to prove their assertiuns\nor demonstrate the truth of their theories.\nWhat seems to be an important clue to the explanation of some of the\nphenomena is, that they are not affected by any supposed counteracting\ninfluence if the medium and circle are unaware that a certain amount of\nscepticism is lurking in the mind of a neophyte present. The necessity of\nDigitized by Google\n\f122 J01trnal of Society for Psychical RP.search. [June, 1887.\n\" harmony,\" as an induction to good results, should be well taken into con-\nsideration by any newly-introduced investigator. Doubts as to the possible\nintentions of the latter, arising in the minds of the circle or, more directly,\nin tbe minds of the medium, will not only interrupt the proceedings but almost\ninvariably bring the s~ance to a sudden termination; for, it would appear\nthat the medium, in order to allow the\" spirits\" to act through his organism,\nmust atlSUnle a condition somewhat analogous to that of self-induced trance, or\na submission to the operator's (\" spirit's\") will, as in the case of a \" subject\" in\nhypnotic sleep. If not ccmfortable and confident, the medium will naturally\ncounteract the influence, or decline to submit himself to it altogether. Hence,\nif there is no trance, nOlle of the phenomena can follow because these latter\nare mostly produced automatically by the medium himself when in the con-\ndition called trance. I will deal with this point more fully ill the records of\nmy observations of \" materialispd forms\" and pass on to my general remarks.\nAt seances held in private, viz., where the medium is a friend or member of\nthe family and not a paid medium engaged for the occasion, the inquirer, if\nadmitted at all, will find little that can instruct him. The members of private\ncircles show no disposition to submit their\" spirits\" or their medium to scienti-\nfic scrutiny or cross-examination. Besides, in but few,of such meetings would\nhe (the inquirer) discover any objective phenomena except\" table-tilting.\"\nPerhaps he might, occasionally, meet with cases of moving luminosities or\n\"spirit-lights,\" so-called, or of raps and movements of objt'Cts occurring\nwithout visible contact. But much as the investigator may be struck or\npuzzled by these phenomena, he cannot discllss them in scientific terms.\nstill less try their reality by experiment.\nI feel also bound to state that, in my opinion, and as far as my experience\ngoes, the records or phenomt\"na said to have occurred at private circles are\ngrossly exaggerated; that, furthermore, most of the remarkable phenomena\nwere obtained with paid mediums engaged for the evening. Consequently\nthere exists no reasonable ground to assume, as most Spiritualists are wont\nto do, that the spiritual manifestations to be witnessed at private seances are\nin any way of a more powerful or more exalting nature than the usual\n\"occurrences\" characteristic to heterogeneous 01\" public seances at \"so\nmuch\" per head. The difference in quality of manifestations witnt\"ssed at\neither the one or the other class of meetings appears to be simply this: at\nprivate meetings messages of a private nature are rapped out or given by\ntilts, and\" forms\" appearing are generally said to have been recognised as\nspirits of deceased relatives; whilst the \"forms\" appearing with public\nmediums are only \"John Kings,\" \"Peters,\" \"Charlies,\" &c., but who\nwill, if an opportunity is afforded them, pe1\"aonate spirits of deceased\nrelatives. At the public seances the programme includes the exhibition of\nfun, which chiefly consists in a rather rough behavio\\lr on the part of the\n\"spirits\" present, who seem to delight in throwing furniture about the room,\nor whose principal occupation is to fly the\" fairy bells,\" &c. Private\" physical\nmediums,\" viz., persons through whose agency or organisation the usual\nseance-room phenomena are produced, and which consist in materialisations\nof spirits, levitation, or the passage of matter through matter, do not, 80 far\nas I am aware, exist in London at the present moment; or they are kept in\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune,I887.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 123\nprofound seclusion-\u00b7at any rllte, they are inacce88ible to those who take a\nreal interest ill the subject. There are, however, persons who claim to\nposse88 physical mediumship, but my personal experience is that the\nphenomena occurring in their presence are limited to table tilts, rappings,\nand\" spirit voices,\" so-called (the latter being especially unverifiable), and\nthat the more decided spirit manifestations, as understood by the Spiritualists\nthemselves, do not occur at their seances.\nMy experience of \"private mediums\" has induced me to arrive at the\nconclusion that they are\" amateur mediums.\" They write with planchette\n{)r hold impromptu addreSBes, and consider themselves guided by spirits or\nunder direct\" spiritual contro!.\" The investigator into the rt'alms of occult\nmystery can find nothing that will interest him at their seances or meetings,\n-except an occasional indication of telepathy between the circle and medium,\nthe latter being invariably the recipient. Yet a mere suggestion, which\nmight be made by the inquirer, as to the po88ibility of thought-transference\nbeing an explanation of the frequent \"lucky hits\" made by the medium\n(sometimes called the clairvoyant) would be treated with scom. It should\nalso be borne in mind that, as regards private mediums and their alleged\nphenomena, a good deal depends upon the definition of the term\" private.\"\nSpiritualists generally confine that term to aU persons who ohtain certain\nresults ill planchette-writing, trance-speaking, clairvoyant descriptiol1s, and\n-even to sensitives to mesmeric influence; or, what is somewhat exceptional,\nto certain persons suffering from certain forms of Ry.teria, insanity, &c.,\nand who are considered to be possessed of some\" evil\" or \"unruly\" spirit.\nAll sl1ch persons are considered private mediums so long as they do not offer\nthemselves publicly as subjects for scientific experimentation or receive any\nhonorarium for their services. Nevertheless, and this is a fact well known to\nSpiritualists, nearly all the now existing paid mediums were at one time\n.. private,\" and seances held with them have been described as \"private,\"\nalthough no mention is made that these mediums were then what is termed\ndeveloping for physical mediumship. The real fact is that paid mediums,\nduring their novitiate, were by nece88ity compelled to \"sit\" with circles\ngratuitously because they could not then depend, with any amount of\ncertainty, upon the production of any phenomena. The\" occurrences,\" if\npresenting themselves at all, were too imperfect and too coarse in their\nnature to allow such mediums to hold public seances where success depends\nupon the regular production of certain characteristic phenomena.\nAnother Kind of Spiritualistic seances to which I will briefly allude is\nthat where \"friends\" assemble for the purpose of holding what they con-\nsider to be communion with the spirits of deceased relatives, but where\nspiritual phenomena are conspicuous by their absence. There is usually a\ngood deal of table-movement, and by the tilts messages are spelled out.\nSometimes the \"friends\" assembled will speak a few words under\" spirit\ninfluence.\" Then this influence (or some other influence) will affect another\nfriend present, who also holds a short addre88. I have noted down a few of\nthese speeches as specimens, but prefer to keep them under cover because\nit is not my intention to trouble the inquirer with samples of productions of\ndiseased minds. A scientific inquirer cannot, as a rule, get admi88ion to\nDigitized by Google\n\f124 Jo'U'1'1tal of Society fOT P8ychical Research. [June, 1887.\nthese places-which he need not regret-since the chief object of the circle is\nto converse with the spirits of their more intimate relatives and friends,\nchiefly about matters that cannot interest a stranger.\nHaving thus far dealt with the different kinds of localities where spirits\nare said to be present, I will now describe my experience as regards the\u00b7\nsupposed spirits themselves. The investigator's first difficulty will be to.\nobtain satisfactory evidence of the identity of what I will call s6ance-room\n\"spirits\"-e.g., those strange beings who are the regular attendants (guides) of\nthe mediuDl. By holding s6ances alternatively with medium A, B, and C,\nit will be noticed that spirits who are said to appear through the mediumship\nof A, B, and C, who claim to be the same individualities in each\ncase, are, nevertheless, distinct beings (if beings), each belonging to.\na particular medium. For instance, the \"John King,\" \"Peter,\" and\n\"Charlie\" of medium A, profess to manifest likewise through medium B\nand C. Yet, after attending a series of s6ances with A, the investigator will\ndiscover, on attending a s6ance with B or C, that he is a perfect stranger to.\nthe\" spirits\" appearing there. To be more explicit I will give a few examples.\nThe \"John King,\" \"Peter,\" and \"Charlie\" I had met a hundred times\nat seances with Mr. Husk as medium, did not recognise me when at a\ns~ance with Mr. Hearne, although the above-named \"spirits\" of Husk had\noften told me that they did regularly manifest through Hearne and o.ther\nmediums. They had even promised to give me a test of their identity,\nshould I ever be present at s6ances with these other mediums. At Mrs.\nJencken's I received a written message from a \"John King.\" The next day\nI met \"John King\" at Husk's. Asked whether\u00b7 he had met me the day\nbefore, his reply was in the negative. At Hearne's I met\" John King,\" who\u00b7\nsaid he knew me; but he, nevertheless, declined to reply to the questions I\nput to him. A few days afterwards the \"John King\" at Husk's\ninformed me of my visit to Hearne, but gave no particulars of what\nhappened there. N.B.-A gentleman present at Hearne's referred, in\nthe presence of the medium's wife, to my regular visits to Husk. This\nat once led me to presume that the mediums had been in communica-\ntion or that some one else had given certain information. At Hearne's\nI had intentionally declined to give my name, which was, besides, not\nknown to the gentleman mentioned, who only knew me as a visitor at\nHusk's. The next day I returned to Hearne's s~ance and met \"Charlie,\"\nwho pretended to know me. Said \"Charlie,\" \"I did recognise you all the\ntime but I felt such a delight in puzzling you.\" Asked whether he would tell\nmy name the reply was: \"Now then, there'sa lark; well, you are Mr. Keelar \"\n(aie). After \"Cha.rlie's \"fiasco and \"John King's\" unwillingness to satisfy\nDly curiosity, I felt no. Io.nger induced to co.ntinue my visits at Hearne's.\nI am under the impression that, as a generality, \"spirits\" know no more o.f\nworldly matters than their mediums do., and that the knowledge they appear\nto possess with regard to the circle is in direct proportion to the information\nthe mediums have succeeded in co.llecting. Still, it has, on the other hand,\nbeen my experience that mentio.n was made by the \"spirits\" at the public\ns6ance-room of facts which the medium could no.t be supposed to. have known ;\nor that descriptions, even to the most minute details, were given of objecta\nDigitized by Google\n\f.June, 1887.] JO'U1\"1Utl of Society for Psychical Research. 125\nand the colour of dress, &c., worn by those assembled at the sOO,nce, and\nwhich it would seem could hardly have been lIoticed by the medium. I do\nnot state that it was absolutely impossible for the mooium to have become\n-acquainted with, or cognisant of, these quasi\u00b7secrets. My experience would\nrather lead to the conclusion that the\" spirits\" are ignorant of facts which the\nmedium has had no opportunity to acquaint himself with in the ordinary\nway; but that a medium, when in the condition termed\" trance,\" or when\nin some analogous state, may be endowed with higher powers of perception,\nand thus communicate uncollsciously, such perceptions to the invisible\nbeings (or\" spirits\") attached to him; or he may automatically act the part of\nthe \"spirit\" under the latter's control, like a subject in the hypnotic trance will\nfollow the suggestions of his agent-his\" willer.\" But it appears that in\nmost cases these conditions are either disturbed or totally absent, and that\nthe medium is compelled to guess and try the best he can. I will quote an\n\u00b7example which will, I think, fully demonstrate the truth of my assertion.\nAt a seance, held in private but with a paid medium, the\" spirits,\" who were\nheard moving about the room, only recogllised those persons whom the\nmedium knew to be present before the lights were extinguished. A stranger,\nwho had been accidentally overlooked by the medium, was notonly not found\n\u00b7out by the\" spirits,\" but his presence actually denied by them.\nI will now deal with the cases of recognitions, by the circle, of the\n\"forms,\" viz., the presumed \"materialised forms\" of spirits, appearing at\nseances. Without wishing to misrepresent the position of Spiritualism, I\nfeel bound to state that, so far as my experience goes, the capital tenet of its\ncrero rests upon insufficient grouuds. From what I have been able to\ndiscover, I cannot but unhesitatingly declare that all the so\u00b7called recognitions\nare delusions. The circumstances uuder which these\" forms\" appeared made\nit impossible for the persons present to observe any features whatsoever, or\nto recogniRe the voices of any of the \"forms\" which came, sometimes but\npartly, forward. To make myself well understood I will mention two\ntypical cases which have come under my observation.\nAt private s6ances, held weekly, at the residence of a lady, a paid\nmedium* being engaged, a \" spirit\" performs the r{)le of the lady's deceased\nhusband. This\" spirit\" I could readily recognistl by the strange intonation\n\u00b7of its voice. It ouly shows itself if the medium is allowed (or is directed by\nhis \"spirits\") to sit apart. It never showd any features, as the head is\ninvariably covered with drapery-the excuse made by the \"spirit\" for not\nuncovering its head being\" that the face is but partly materialised and not\nfit to be exhibited\" (sic). The spirit's voice, however, joins in the topical\nconversation, addresses the lady by her Christian name, and gives little bits\nof advice, if required. I have noticed that this particular \"form\" is just\nthe size of the medium, but appears shorter on account of its somewhat bent\nand contracted attitude. The voice is apparently weak-which, like the\nattitude aBsumeil, is-so the\" spirit\" declares-the result of its having died\nfrom a long and painful illness! Yet the lady recognises this \"fonn\" as\nher husbanrl. But it so happells that the same medium holds seances at his\nown residence for Spiritualists and, to some extent, admits enquirers.\n*The names and addresses are given in confidence to the editor.\nDigitized by Google\n\f126 Jov,1\"nal of Society \/0'1' Psychical Research. [June, 1887.\nAt these s6ances the same \"form,\" with its weak voice, appears somewhat\nirregularly, and performs the \"spirit\" of the deceased husband of another lady.\nIII t.he earlier times of my visits at these seances this\" form\" attempted to\u00b7\npass itself off as one of my deceased brothers. Unfortunately for the\" spirit,\"\nthe wonld-be brother did not know my Christian name, nor his own, and to-\nmake things still more absurd, spoke in English, which my brother had never\nspoken. But to retUMl to the widowed ladies, who each received visits from\ntheir departed husbands. Mrs. A. holds s6ances at her residence, and rarely\nvisits the medium at his own house, while Mrs. B. invariably goes to the\u00b7\nlatter place. The ladies are strangers to each other. By accident, Mrs. A.\nonce visited the medium at his public seances the very evening when Mrs.\nB. was there. It occurred to me that the\" spirit\" would this time get into-\ndifficulties. I was anxiously awaiting the solution of the problem, expecting\neither the discovery of fraud by, or a dispute between, the two ladies\nconceMled. But the thing was cleverly managed after all, and both ladies.\nreceived the customary visits of their respective husbands to their entire\nsatisfaction. This is how it was arranged ;-\nFirst, Mrs~ B. was favoured with the exhibition-by a sheet of luminous\npaper-of a \"form\" showing only part of the head, the face being covered\nwith drapery, so arrangecl as to allow only Mrs. B. to see the forehead and\neyes. To the remaining portion of the circle, with the exception of one or\ntwo persons sitting at her right side, the features were hidden. However,.\nthe\" spirit\" never uttered a solind, which was contrary to its habits, and\ndisappeared without evell wishing her his customary \"Good-night, God\nbless you.\" As a sign of recognition, Mrs. B. exclaims the name of her dead\nhusband! A few seconds after a spirit-voice (one of the\" guides\") addresses\nthe circle, informing them that Mr. B. had appeared to his wife, but felt\nrather weak, and that hence he could not materialise a voice (sic). Towards.\nthe end of the seance, a soft, trembling voice was heard to whisper close to\nthe ears of Mrs. A., another \" spirit-voice\" announcillg the arrival of Mr. A.\nSilence was requested by the medium's wife, all the voice of Mr. A. was\nweak. The usual compliment was made, the invariable blessings invoked by\npseudo Mr. A., when Mrs. A. expressed her surprise at not beholding her\nlong-lost husband ill the\" materialised\" form. Then the whispering spirit,\nby way of an explanation for his shortcomings, excused itself by stating that\n\" power was getting exhausted\" and that a materialisation of a body could\nnot be accomplished without injury to the medium, but that she (Mrs. A.)\u00b7\nmight expect better results next time at her own circle! It should be noted\nthat the \"spirit,\" in order to avoid discrepances, showed part of its face,\nwithout using its Yoice, when near Mrs. B., and that it used its whisper but\ndid not show its form when addressing Mrs. A. It need not be mentioned\nthat both the ladies failed to discover the trick, and that each left the\nseance-room under the pleasant satisfaction of having once more communed\nwith her departed husband.\nA few days after, Mrs. B. again attended a s6ance at the medium's house,.\nwhen, as might have heen expected, a \"spirit\" claiming to be Mr. B. appeared\nto the lady. Up to that evening Mrs. B. had not put allY questions to hel'\nsupposed husband, but had satiEfied herself with listening to what the\" spirit\"\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1887.J Journal of Society for P8ychical Research.. 127\nsaid to her, or rather seemed to attempt to say to her, since, as Mrs. B.\ninformed me herself, she did not very well understand what her husband\nsaid. I believe doubts as to the genuineness of the apparition began\nto arise in Mrs. B.'s mind. . Whether some one had prompted\nher to try a test she did not say, but a test she did introduce,\nand a good one it turned out to be. Mrs. B.'s husband (her real husband)\nwas a Belgian, and conversation between husband and wife was\nusually held in the French language. When the \"form\" appeared, Mrs.\nB. addresses it in French, asking-not without emphasis-\"G., IU-tua me dire\nquelque chose f\" to which\" Monsieur G.'s materialised spirit\" replies with a\nseries of monosyllabic utterances sounding like boo-boo-boo, and he\nterminates his reply by a repetition of the last word of the question, chose.\n(It will be noticed that this word would not have been likely to recur in an\nanswer to the question.) A few days later on, a seance is given at the house\nof a Spiritualist, with the same medium, Mrs. B. being again present, and, at\nthe\" form\" of her presumed husband making his usual appearance, she once\nmore repeats the question and, needless to lLdd, with exactly the same\nresults. Yet, after all this worthless evidence, all these badly-played tricks,\nthe Medium and Daybreak, a Spiritualistic newspaper, records the seance in\nits next appearing number, and quotes as a specially convincing event the\nfact that a French lady present met her deceased husband and actually\nconversed with him in her native tongue!\nI have mentioned only these two cases out of many of a similar quality;\nin fact at almost every seance I was present snch similar \"recognitions\"\nwere the order of the evening. Not only did husbands, fathers, mothers\nappear to the circle, but even little\" forms\" were seen and\" recognised\" as\nthe children of some of the members of the circle, although these \"thingR\"\nkept at the respective distance of many yards, and never ventured into the\nlight, if such were allowed in the room, or used the luminous slates for\ntheir exhibition when the seance was a dark one.* Besides the\" relatives\"\nmet at seances for physical manifestations I must also refer to the exhibition\nof periodical spirit-celebrities-like the Prince Imperial, Colonel Burnaby,\nGeneral Gordon, some recently-executed criminal, all of whom are said to be\nrecognised by the circle.\nFrom what may be seen and experienced at these seances, it would appear\nthat the obvious mistakes and unfounded recognitions on the part of the\ncircle are caused by a combination of influences acting simultaneously, such\nas, for instance, fear, an:xi~ty, expectation, firm belief in the possibility of\nspirit return, and trust in the assertiolls of other believers. Besides, it\nwill be found that there is a marked deficiency in the powers of observation\nin all those persons who believe in having met a spirit-friend or relative in\nthe materialised condition. Further, there are a great many Spiritualists, good\nobservers, UPOll whose co~petency as leaders and advisers many inquirers\n* On one occasion, however, a little form ran through the seance.room, exhi\u00b7\nbiting itself sufficiently to show that the proportions were those of a. child.

In fact, if hallucinations come into play at all, or anywhere,\nit must be here in these very places. I will not. quote such cases where the\nmembers of a circle, or some of them are obviously suffering from a peculiar\nform of insanity (though these sufferers appear to be more numerous than\nis generally supposed), and with whom the enquirer will often find himself\nobliged to mix-persons, I mean, who illsist upon his unconditionally\na.ccepting all the miracles they will tell him of-who see a spirit behind\neverybody; who observe the\" spirits\" assisting Mr. Maskelyne at his enter-\ntaillments, and of whose glaring absurdities the scientific im\u00b7estigator cannot,\nas a matter of course, take the slightest notice.\nWhat I wished to direct special attention to is, that the very stronghold\nQf modern Spiritualism rests upon no other foundations than the rash\nassertions on the part of unqualified recorders who are guided by infatuation\nrather than by reason. In all the cases of supposed recognised apparitions\nat s6ances where I happened to he present, the necessary conditions to\ndiscriminate between the genuine and the fraudulent were invariably\ndisregarded. The medium was directed by the spirit-voice to sit away from\nthe circle, and, consequently, there were no means to ascertain whether the\n\"forms\" appearing Wl're being disconnected f,om the medium, or the\nmedium himsl'lf acting under hypnotic impulse, or a fraud. Direct proof of a\n\" form's\" identity was not even required; it seemed sufficient for the\" form\"\nto merely answer the question, \" Are YOIl so-and-so 1\" in the affirmative. After\nthis, the circle proclaimed unanimously the apparition of so-and-so. If, what\noccasionally happens, the \"form\" volunteered additional evidence, it was\nalways the world's property, or previously \"let out,\" i.e., offered to the\n\" spirit\" to help him along, by the circle itself.\nBut my object in alluding to the various ills of the present-day seance-\nroom is not, as might be supposed, to warn the intended investigator against\nthe subject of Spiritualism in toto. In how far all the usual occurrences are\ntrue or not true is a qUl'stion which I must leave the inquirer to find out for\nhimself. My opinion is, that (1) genuine spiritual phenomena occur some-\ntimes; (2) that some of the occurrences are explk-able by telepathy and\n\" psychic-interaction\" on the part of the circle and medium; and, lastly,\nthat most of t.he \"form presentations\" are frauds for which the medium may\nnot be entirely respollsible. The facts I have quoted were mostly accidl'ntal\ndiscoveries marie during long continued, patient, and vigorous investigation\nin all directions, and with every accessible medium, private or public, as\ncircumstances permitted. I merely wished to have my remarks made public\nto save the intended inquirer-who may be a total stranger to the subject-\nmuch disappointment in the ..xpectations he may perhaps entertain. To those\nlikely to precipitate themselves into this dark abyss it may be useful to learn\nsome of the results of my experience of nearly 400 seances, in the more\ncompressed form of a few pages of letter-press.-I remaiu, Sir, yours\nobediently, J.
