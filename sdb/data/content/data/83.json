She had a life-long interest in paranormal phenomena, carrying out experiments and investigations, and was for many years vice-president of the Society for Psychical Research.

She became an accomplished amateur classical musician, playing the cello, and studied English at Oxford University, followed by law. She spent most of her working life in the legal profession, as a barrister and solicitor. As a supporter both of animal rights and the right to euthanasia, she drafted parliamentary bills that gained support in the House of Lords.1   Parapsychological Research\n\nAt Oxford, Barrington joined the university\u2019s psychical research society, later becoming its president. She joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1957. Her main work within psychical research started after 1962 when she was invited to join the Council.\n\nBarrington carried out informal experiments in dowsing, telepathy, table-tilting, remote viewing and psychometry, often at her home with other SPR members. She also carried out field investigations of spontaneous phenomena, notably of poltergeist-type disturbances. In 2001 she joined Maurice Grosse, the principal investigator of the Enfield poltergeist, to investigate the case of a young boy who appeared to be the epicenter of paranormal rappings.2   Flying Thermometer Case\n\nIn 1964, Barrington investigated the case of a seven-year old child who was obsessed with the thought that the family home was haunted. The child\u2019s parents reported that objects had moved inexplicably, notably a bath thermometer that fell to the ground despite being fastened securely to the wall. The family also described unpleasant smells from an unknown source, creaking floorboards and \u2018moaning\u2019 sounds. The parents, a professional couple, seemed reliable witnesses. Barrington concluded that the phenomena were real and that the child could be acting as a physical medium.3 She returned to the topic in later articles.4  JOTT\n\nA particular interest of Barrington\u2019s was the reported phenomenon of ordinary objects seeming to disappear and then appear again in inexplicable ways, for which she coined the term JOTT (Just One of Those Things).5 In her 2018 book, JOTT: When Things Disappear ... and Come Back or Relocate \u2013&nbsp;<\/a>and Why it Really Happens, she described a variety of categories, giving around 180 examples from her own research, and reasons why these could not all be explained in terms of fallible memory or coincidence. In such cases she concluded that mind is acting on physical matter.\n\nFor more on JOTT,&nbsp; see a review of her book by Robert Charman. See also her Psi Encyclopedia article  on the subject.  Mediums\n\nBarrington found some reported feats of clairvoyance and mediumship particularly impressive, notably those of the Polish medium Stefan Ossowiecki, which she described in A World in a Grain of Sand, with contributions from Ian Stevenson and Zofia Weaver&nbsp;(2005). Elsewhere, she defended DD Home, Franek Kluski and Eusapia Palladino from attacks by sceptics.6  Possession and Reincarnation Cases\n\nIn 2005, Barrington reported an investigation in Hungary of Iris Farczady, a teenage girl who had undergone a dramatic change of personality, becoming that of a recently-deceased middle-aged Spanish woman who called herself Lucia and spoke fluent Spanish.7 Although this may be an example of replacement reincarnation, Barrington preferred to see it as possession.\n\nShe also investigated claims by Jenny Cockell to remember the life of Mary Sutton in early twentieth-century Ireland, which she concluded were soundly based.8  Works  Books\n\nCrookes and the Spirit World (1972, ed. with RG Medhurst &amp; KM Goldney).
