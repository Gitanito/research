He carried out paranormal investigations, notably of the Amityville haunting, but his claims were viewed with suspicion by some other parapsychologists.\n\n&nbsp; Contents   \tLife and Career  \tPsychical Research   \tControversy \tSelected Books \tLiterature \tEndnotes     Life and Career\n\nHans Holzer was born in Vienna in 1902. His family fled to New York in 1938 when Austria was annexed to Germany. There he studied at Columbia University and also became captivated by show-business, writing musical sketches and reviews. He later claimed to have a PhD from the London College of Applied Science, but this was disputed.1 He \u2018went on to teach parapsychology at the New York Institute of Technology\u2019.2 In 1962 he married Countess Catherine Genevieve Buxhoeveden, said to be a distant relative of Catherine the Great of Russia.  Psychical Research\n\nHolzer wrote more than 140 books on paranormal subjects. Calling himself a \u2018ghost hunter\u2019 Holzer investigated haunted houses and recorded the details in his many books (see below). His most famous investigation, carried out with Ethel Johnson-Meyers, a medium, concerned alleged hauntings and poltergeist activity at Amityville, which spawned best-selling books and horror films.\n\nHolzer also wrote about reincarnation, claiming to remember a past life in which he was at the Battle of Glencoe in 1692 in Scotland, and another in which he was a Wiccan high priest.3\n\nHe appeared frequently on television programmes describing his experiences and eventually hosted his own US television show Ghost Hunter.4  Controversy\n\nJoe Nickell, a sceptic investigator, disputed the legitimacy of the sources Holzer used.5 &nbsp;Peter Underwood, a British ghost hunter, considered Holzer\u2019s Amityville findings to be \u2018erroneous\u2019.6\n\nHolzer\u2019s book Window to the Past received a scathing report in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, which found his treatment of his historical sources to be \u2018so unsatisfactory \u2026 as to cast considerable doubt on the objectivity and reliability of his work as a whole\u2019.7  Selected Books\n\nGhost Hunter (1963).
