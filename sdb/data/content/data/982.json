I name no body.\nI HAVE, I believe, as true a Notion of the Power\nof Imagination as I ought to have, and you fhall\nhear farther from me upon that Head 5 I believe we\nform as many Apparitions in our Fancies, as we fee\nreally with our Eyes, and a great many more j nay,\nour Inwginations fometimes are very diligent to\nembark the Eyes (and the Ears too) in the Delufion,\nand perfuade us to believe we fee Spcftres and Ap-\npearances, and hear Noifes and Voices, when in-\ndeed, neither the Devil or any other Spirit, good\nor bad, has troubled themfelves about us.\nBut it does not follow from thence that there-\nfore there are no fuch Things inNature> that there\nis no Intercourfe or Communication between\nthe World of Spirits, and the World we live in;\nthat the Inhabitants of the invifible Spaces, he thofe\n\"where youpkafe^ have no Converfe with us, and that\nthey never take the Liberty to flop down upon this\nGlobe, or to vifit their Friends here 5 and in ihort,\nthat they have nothing to do with or fay to us, or\nwe with or to them. The Enquiry is not, as I take\nit, whether they do really come hither or no, but\nwho they are that do come?\nSpirit is certainly fomething that we do not\nfully underftand, in our prefent confined Circum-\nftanccsjand as we do not fully underftand the thing,\nfo neither can we diftinguiih of its Operations. As\nwe at prefent conceive of it, 'tis an unreftrain'd,\nunlimited Being $ except by fuch Laws of the invi-\nfible\n\fof A?P ARlflONS.\nfiblc State, which at prefent we know little ofj its\nway of converfing wc kilow nothing of^ other than\nthis, that we believe, and indeed fee Reafon for it,\nthat it can ad in an invifibleand imperceptible man-\nner ^ it moves without being prefcrib'd or limited\nby Space, it can come and not be feen, go and not\nbe perceiv'd j 'tis not to be fliut in by Doors^ or\nfliut out by Bolts and Barsj in a Word, it is un-\nconfined by all thofe Methods which we confine\nour A6tions by, or by which we underfland our-\nfelves to be limited and prefcrib'd.\nYet iiotwithftanding all this, it cortverfes here^\nis with us, and among us j correfponds, tho' un^\nembodied, with our Spirits which are embodied j\nand this converfing is by not only an invifible, but\nto us an inconceivable way > it is neither tied dowii\nto Speech or to Vifion, but moving in a fuperior\nOrb, conveys its Meaning to our Underftandings^\nits Meafures to our Conceptions > deals with thei\nImagination^ and works it up to receive fuch Im\u00ab\nprefiions as ferve for its purpofej and yet at thd\nfame time we are perfeftly paffive, and have no A-^\ngcncy in, or Knowledge of the Matter.\nB Y this filent Converfe, all the kind Notices of\napproaching Evil or Good are convey'd to us^\nwhich are fometimes fo evident^ and come with\nfuch an irrefiftiblc Force upon the Mind, that we\nmuft be more than ftupid if we do not perceive\nthem i and if we are not extremely wanting td\nour felves, we may take fuch due Warning by\nthem, as to. avoid the Evils which we had No-\ntice of in that manner, and to embrace the Good\nthat is ofFer'd to us : Nor are there many People\nalive who can deny but they have had fuch\nNotices, by which, if they had given due Atten-\ntion to them, they had been affifted to fave them-\nfelves ft'om the Mifchiefs which followed} or had^\non the other hand^ taken hold of fuch and fuch\nB ^ Ad^\n\fThe H'tftory and Reality\nAdvantages as had been offer'd for their Good : for\nit is certainly one of the grand and moft impor-\ntant Difficulties of human Life, to know whether\nfuch or fuch things, which prefent in our ordinary\nor extraordinary Circumftances, are for our good,\nas they feem to be, and as may be pretended, or not,\nand whether it is proper for us to accept them or\nno 5 and many unhappily fland in the Way of their\nown Profperity, for want of knowing what to ac-\ncept of, and what to refufe.\nNow by what Agency muft it be that we have\nDireftions, for good or foreboding Thoughts of Mif-\nchiefs which attend us, and which it is otherwifc\nimpoffible we fhould know any thing of 5 if fome\nintelhgent Being, who can fee into Futurity, had\nnot convey 'd the Apprehenfions into the Mind,\nand had not caufed the Emotion which alarms\nthe Soul?\nAnd how fhould that intelligent Being (what-\never it is) convey thefe Forebodings and fudden\nJVlifgivings, as we rightly call them, into the Mind,\nif there was not a certain Gorrefpondence between\nthem, a way of talking perfe6tly unintelligible to\nus, uncommon, and without the Help of Sounds or\nany other perceptible Way ?\nTor Sprits ^without the Help of Voice converfe,\nA S thus there is a Gonverfe of Spirits, an Intel-\nligence, or call it what you pleafe, between our\nSpirits embodied and cafed up in Flefh, and the\nSpirits unembodied j who inhabit the unknown\nMazes of the invifible World, thofe Goafts which\nour Geography cannot defcribej who, between So^iie*\n'where and No-where dwell, none of us know where\n^\nand yet we are fure muft have Locality, and for\nought we know, are very near us; why fhould it\nbe thought fo ftrange a thing, that thofe Spirits\nfhould\n\fof APPARITIONS.\nIhould be able to take upon them an Out- fide or\nCafe? why ihould they not be able, on Occafion, or\nwhen they think fit, to drefs themfelves up as wc\ndo a la Mafquerade^^ in a Habit difguis'd like Flefli\nand Blood, to deceive human Sight, fo as to make\nthemfelves vifible to us ? As they are free Spirits,\nwhy may they not be like what my Lord Rochefler\nexprefTcs in another Cafe, > .\nA Spirit free to chufe for their own Share\nWhat Cafe of Flefh and Blood they pleafe to wear ?\nRoch. Sat. againfiMan.\nI do not by this affirm that it is fo, and that a\nSpirit may thus aflume a real Cafe of Flefh and\nBlood y for I refolve to affirm nothing that will not\nbear a Proof, and to fuggeft nothing without Pro-\nbability, in all this Work.\nB u T it is enough to the prefent purpofe if thefe\ninvifible Inhabitants can affijme an Appearance, a\nForm fufficient to make them perceptible to us;\nat the fame time not being at all vefted with\nany Subilance, much lefs of the Species which they\nreprefent.\nI F they can aflume a viflble Form, as I fee no\nReafon to fay they cannot, there is no room then to\ndoubt of the Reality of their appearing 5 becaufe\nwhat may he we cannot but believe fometimes to\nheen^ as what has been^ we are fure may be.\nT o fay that the unembodied Spirits can have no-\nthing to do with us, and that we have Reafon to\nbelieve they are not at all acquainted with human\nAffairs, is to fay what no Man can be afliired of,\nand therefore is begging the Queflion in the grof-\nfcll manner.\nI SHALL therefore fpend but very little time to\nprove or to argue for the Reality of Apparition,\nLet Mr. Glanville and his Antagonifts, the Hohbifis\nB ; and\n\f^ The Hifiory and Reality\nand Sadduces of thofe Times, be your Difputants\nupon that Subjcftj nor fliall I trouble you with\nmuch Antiquity or Hiftory: a little that is moft\nunexceptionable may be neceffary. If there is an\ninviiible World, and if Spirits refiding or inhabit-\ning are allowed to be there, or placed there by\nthe fuprcme governing Power of the Univerfe j it\nwill be hard to prove, that 'tis impoflible they\nfhould come hither, or that they (hould not have\nLiberty to ihow themfelvcs here, and converfe in\nthis Globe, as well as in all the other Globes or\nWorlds, which, for ought we know, are to be\nfound in that immenfe Space j Reafon does not\nexclude them. Nature yields to the Poflibility,\n5ind Experience with a Cloud of Witnefles in all\nAges confirm the Reality of the affirmative.\nThe Queftion therefore before me is not fo\nIDUch whether there are any fuch things as Appari-\ntions of Spirits J but WHO, and WHAT, and\nfrom WHENCE they are > what Bufinefs they\ncome about, who fends them or direfl:s them, and\nhow and in what manner we ought to think and\naft, and behave about them, and to them j and this\nis the Subftance of this Undertaking.\nThe Angels are fa id to be mimftring Spirits^ and\nwe know they have been made ufe of (as fuch) on\nmany Occalions, by the fuperior Appointment of\nhim that created them \\ why then it may not be\nthought fit by the fame Power, to make or fubfli-\ntute a Miniftration of thefc unembodied Spirits to\nthe Service of the embodied Souls of Men, which\narc alfo God's Creatures, we cannot telL\nUpon what foot, and to what end, either on\ntheir Side or on ours, and from what Appointment,\nis very difficult to afcertain j and yet fomc probable\nGueffes might be made at ittoo,if it was the proper\nWork before me> but I am rather adjufling the\nFaft, and afcertainin.g the Reality of Apparitions ia\ngeneral^\n\fof APPARiriO N S. 7\ngeneral, than inquiring into the Reafon^ of them\n;\ncither the Reafons in Nature, or in Providence,\nwhich are perhaps farther out of our Reach than\nfome People imagine.\nI T is as difficult too to determine whether the\nSpirits that appear are good or evil, or bothj the\nonly Conclufion upon that Point is to be made from\nthe Errand they come about 5 and it is a very juft\nConclufion, I think > for if a Spirit or Apparition\ncomes to or haunts us only to terrify and affright,\nto fill the Mind with Horror, and the Houfe\nwith Diforder, we cannot reafonably fuppofe that\nto be a good Spirit 5 and on the other hand, if it\ncomes to dire6b to any Good, or to forewarn and\npreferve from any approaching Evil, it cannot then\nbe reafonable to fuppofe 'tis an evil Spirit.\nThe Story of an Apparition diflurbing a young\nGentleman, at or near Cambridge^ is remarkable to\nthis Purpofe: He fet up, it feems, for a kind of\nprofefs'd Atheifm j but hearing a Voice, fuppofed\nit was the Devil fpoke to him, and yet owned that\nthe Voice afTured him there was a God^ and bid him\nrepent. It was a moft incongruous Suggeftion that\nthe Devil fhould come Voluntier to an Atheift, and\nbid him repent; or, that the Devil fhould with a\nlike Freedom afTert the Being of a GOD.\nI F then it was a real Apparition of, or a Voice\nfrom an invifible Spirit 5 (Ifayi\/\", becaufe it might be\na Phantom of his own Imagination) itmuftbe from a\ngood Spirit, or from an evil Spirit over-rul'd by a\nfuperior and beneficent Power ; and if that were to\nbe fuppofed, then it would juftify our taking far-\nther Notice of thofe things called Voices and\nApparitions, than I fhall venture to advife.\nThe PofSbility however of Apparitions, and the\nCertainty of a World of Spirits, as I can by no\nmeans doubt, fo I fhall take up none of your\ntime to anfwer the Objedions and Cavils of other\nB 4 People\n\f8 The Hijlory and Reality\nPeople about it \u2022, becaufc I think the Evidence will\namount to a Demonftration of the Fa6ts, and De-\nmonitration puts an end to Argument.\nCHAP. I.\nOf Apparitions in particular^ the Reality\nof them^ their Antiquity^ and the 2)\/^-\nrence between the Apparitions offormer\nTimeSf andthofe which we may call Modern ;\nwith fomething of the Reafon and Occafion\nof that difference,\nNOTHING can be a ftronger Tcftimony of\nthe Reality of Apparitions m General, than\nto defcend to the particular Appearances which we\nare aflur'd have been feen and convers'd with from\nthe fuperior World. And firft I begin with fuch\nas have been evidently from Heaven it felf, and by the\nfoveraign Appointment of Providence upon extraor-\ndinary Occafions. And tho' I fhall trouble my Rea-\nders with as little as poflible out of Scripture, ef-\npecially at the Beginning of my Work, becaufe I\nam unwilling they fhould throw it by, before they\nread it out, which there would be fome Danger of,\nif I ihould begin too grave\n!\nYet, as I cannot go back to Originals, or be-\ngin at the Beginning, without a little Hiftory\nout of thofe ancient Times, you muft bear with\nmy juft naming the Sacred Hiflorians. I'll be as\nfhort as I can.\nNothing is more certain, if the Scripture is at\nall to be believed among us, than that God him-\nfelf was pleafed, in the Infancy of Things, to ap-\npear Vifibly, and in Form, to feveral Perfons, and\noa\n\fof APPARITIO NS.\non feveral Occafions, upon Earth j afluming or\ntaking up the Shape of his Creature Man, when\nhe thought fit to converfc with him, that he mighc\nnot be a Terror to him.\nThus jldam was frequently vifited in Eden^\nand we have no room to doubt but it was in a\nvifiblc Form, becaufe Mam both heard him fpeak,\nand as the Text fays, I'hey heard the Voice of the\nLord God ^walking in the Garden in the Cool of the\nDay. Gen. iii. 8.\nB Y all the Hiilory of the Antediluvean World,\nwe have reafon to believe, that as God did fre-\nquently fpeak to Men, fo he as frequently appear'd\nto them \u2022, for we find they converfed with God Face\nto Face. C^\/t\/, tho' wicked, talk'd with God, and\nGod with him, when he was charg'd with the Mur-\nther of his Brother Ahehy and the Text is exprefs.\nGen. iv. \\6. that after it, Cain went out from the\nPrefence of the Lord. So that God not only fpokc\nto him by a voice, but was Vifible and Prefent to\nhim.\nAnd as I muft carry the Devil along with me,\nhand in hand, in every Period of Time, To even in\nParadife the Devil aflum'd a Shape. For we muft\nallow Satan to be a Spirit, and indeed, we have\ngood reafon to fay he is a Spirit^ free to Chuse\nwhat Cafe of Flejh and Blood he pleafes to put on,\nor at lead: feemingly to put on.\nThus he without doubt fpoke in the Mouth of\nthe Serpent in the Garden, or clfe took upon him-\nfelf that Shape, tho' the former is the moll: proba-\nble 5 becaufe the Serpent was curft for being but\nthe Inftrument, however paffive he might be.\nMr. MlftON makes no doubt of the Devil's\nafluming a Shape of any kind, B^ajl as well as Man^\nwhen he brings him in whifpering to Eve in her\nSleep, and placing himfelf clofe at her Ear, in the\nShape of a Toad, which he cxprefles in his Sub-\nlime\n\flO The Hijiory and Reality\nlime Poem, and with that inimitable Manner, pe-\nculiar to himfelf.\nFirst he brings Satan leaping over the Mound\nor Fence, which God had placed round the Gar-\nden, as a Wolf leaps over the Hurdles into a\nSheep-fold 5 and being gotten into Paradifc, he\nplaces himfelf upon the Tree of Life, in the Shape\nof a Raven or Cormorant, There's the Devil's iirft\nApparition.\nThence he views the whole Garden, and all\nthe Creatures in it, and at laft he fpies ^dam and\nJEve, to his great Surprife. But after a while fpent\nin admiring their Form, their Beauty, Felicity and\nInnocence, as he refolv*d to ruin them, fo he comes\ndown from the Tree to be nearer themj and\nmixing among the Cattle, where he takes upon\nhim now one Shape, then another, as it beft\nfuited him, to be near j^dam and Eve^ and yet to\nbe unperceived by themj this the Poet defcribes\nthus J\n5n?en from his hfty Stand on that high Tree^\nDown he alights among the fportful Herd\nOf thofe four-footed Kinds y himfelf now one,\nNow other, as their Shape hefi ferv'd his End\nNearer to view his Prey^ and unefffd\n^0 mark what of their State he more might learn,\n\u00ab -\n\u2022 \u2014^bout them round\nj\nA Lion now he fialks with fiery Glare -,\nThen as a Tiger,\nMilt.

Gen. xv. 1.4,\nto the 7th.\nBut there are other expreis Places in which \\t\nis faid in plain Words, God appeared to him. Gen.\nxii. 7. 'The Lordappear d unto Abram : and Gen. xvii. i.\nThe Lord appeared to Abram^ and [aid unto him : and\nver. 21. And he left off talking with him^ and God\nwent up from Abraham. 'Tis undeniable that God\nappeared, and was with him, and left off talking\nwith him, and went from him : all Marks of a vifi^\nble Apparition.\nAgain, Chap, xviii. here it is ftill more ex*\nplicit, and God not only appeared, but appeared\nin a Human Shape. Ver. i . And the Lord appeared\ntd him in the Plains of Mamre^ as he fat in the.\nDoor of his Tent, Firil 'tis faid, he lift up his Eyes\nand looked, and behold, three Men flood by him.\nSo vifible were they, that he entertains them,\n7 invites\n\fIt The H'tftory and Reality\ninvites them to Dinner, and prepares a fat Calf to\nbe drefs'd, and Cakes, and Butter, and Milk. In\nfhort, he made a Feaftj fo much was he, as it may\nbe faid, deluded j fo real was the Appearance j nay,\nwhen he fat it all before them, 'tis faid thy did\nEAT.\nNow, ver. 13. 'tis faid expreflyone of thefe was\nthe Lor Di nay, in the Original it is Jehovah j\nthat was when he charged Sarah with laughing,\nand flie deny'd it.\nN. B. Sarah was the firft of Human Kind,\nthat ever told God a Lye to his Face.\nBut fhe was frighted, that's certain i the\nText fays fo.\nI N the 17th Verfe, when God tells Ahraham what\nhe had refolv'd to do to Sodom-, 'tis plain, he fpeaks\nin the firfl Perfonas God j j^nd the Lord faid^ Jhall I\nhide from jlhraham the thing that I do? Hereupon\nAbraham takes upon him to plead with God in be-\nhalf of Sodom 'y and in this he fpeaks as to God him-\nfelf, ver. 30. O let not the Lord he angry^ ayid I will\nfpeak : and before that, ver. 27. Behold now I have\ntaken upon me to fpeak unto the Lor d, which am\nhut Dtift and AJJoes.\nThus I think 'tis evident, that God himfclf\ndid appear in Humane Shape to Abraham^ and that\nmore than once. The next Chapter is as plain, that\nhe did the fame to L o t j or if it fhould be obje-\nded that it is not fo clear that it was God himfelf,\nit was two Angels 5 tho' Interpreters do generally\nagree, that it was Chrift himfelf, who is called\nan Angel, the Angel of the Covenant. But ii that\nwere doubtful, then it will flill be allow'd thac it\nwas an Apparition of Angels in Human Shape,\nwhich will itand good in my next Article.\nBut as I am upon the Higheft and Supreme\nInltances firft, I muft finifli it by two particular\nQuota*\n\fof APPARITIONS. 13\nQuotations, which cannot be difputed. (i.) One is\nof Jacobs Gen. xxxii. 24. fhere wreftled a man with\nhim: and ver. 28. the Man is faid to be God him-\nfelf, as a Prince haft thou Power with God, and haft\npre'vaird: and ver. 2,0, after he had bleiTed him,\nJacob caird the Place Peniel^ that is the Face of \/\nGod. For, fays he, \/ have feen God Face to Face,\nAgain Jacob fays, Gen. xlviii, 7^, God Almighty ap-\npeared to me at Luz in the Land of Canaan^ and blef-\nfed me.\n(2.) But there is yet a flronger Teftimony than\nall this, for it is fpokcn from the Mouth of God\nhimfelf upon a very particular Occafion, which was\nto honour Mofes^ and eftablifli him in the Reve-\nrence and Regard of the People, when the Se-\nventy Men or Elders were appointed to take Part\nof his Work off his Hands, and judge of fmaller\nMatters among the People j which is nobly cx-\nprefs'd. Numb. xi. 17. i'hey ftoall bear the Burthen\n6f the People with thee. In the next Chapter Miriam^\nand even j^aron himfelf, fpake againft Mofes-y that is\nin fhort rofe in Rebellion j and God, to honour his\nServant, tells them how he had, and would diftin-\nguifh Mofes from all the reft. ver. 8. With him will\nI fpeak Mouth to Mouthy even Apparently, and\nnot in Dark Speeches^ and the Similitude of the Lord\nfhall he Behold.\nHere is a pofitive Declaration from Heaven,\nthat God would appear vifibly to Mofes -^ the like\nInftance is not to be feen in the whole Bible. The\nWord Apparently is plain, it can be no otherwife\nunderftood, without grofs Equivocating with the\nText.\nCome we next to the Times of our Bleffed Sa-\nviour, and there we have two eminent Appear-\nances within the Compafs of our prefent Argu-\nment.\nI. The\n\ff 4 'The Hifiory and Reality\n1. The Holy Ghost appearing in the Shipd\nof a Deve.\n2.. The Appearance of Jesus Christ after his\nRefurreftion, when in the glorify'd Body where-\nwith he afcended 5 and that this was an Apparition,\nis plain, from the feveral Circumftances of his Ap-\npearance.\nFIRST, When he join'd the two Difciples go-\ning to Emaus : that he appeared as a Man, the Text\nis plain from his walking with them, and Difcourfe\n10 them 5 and that it was but an Apparition is\nalfo plain. Luke xxiv. i<S. Their Eyes wsre holden\nthat they JJjould not know him : and ver. 5 1 . when their\nEyes were opened to know him he vani(hed out of\ntheir Sight.\nSECQNDLT^ When he appeared to Mary Mag^\n^^\/^\/^ at the Sepulchre, but forbad her to touch him,\nJohn XX. 17. And again 'ver, ip. when he came\ninto the Room where the Difciples were aflembled,\nand when the Doors were iTiuc, and faidj Peace h&\nunto to you. Thus it is evident Chrift has appear'd^\nand he has told us he ihall appear again^, coming\nin the Clouds of Heaven j and we look for that\nblefled Hope, and glorious Appearing.\nThus then you have God himfelf, Father^ Sort\nand Holy Ghoft, appearing in difl:in6t Times, in fe-\nveral Shapes or Forms of Appearance, all giving,\nTeftimony in general to the Reality of this Truth,\nThat Spirits can afTume Humane or other Shapes,\nand be made vifible to Mankinds and this is what;\nv\/e call Apparition.\nHaving thus brought an Inftance of the mod\nexalted Kind, even the Appearance or Apparition\nof God himfelf, 'tis needful to ftate a little the\nDifference between thofe Appearances, and that\nwhich we are now to difcourfe of.\n'Tis an Objedion natural to the Cafe in hand^\nWe do not queftion, much lefs enquire, whether\ninfinite\n\fof APPARITIONS. If\ninfinite Power, to whom all things are not pofllblc\nonly, but eafy, can aflume a Humane Shape, or any-\nother j and appear, when^ where^ how^ and in\nivbat Forjn he thinks fit j and that he has- or may-\nhave fo appeared. But there is a manifefl Difference\nbetween what God is able, or may pleafe to do up-\non extraordinary Occafions, and what any of his\nCreatures may or can do.\nBesides 'tis evident, or at lead wc have rea*\nfon to believe, that God himfelf did appear in thofc\nTimes upon thofe extraordinary Occafions only,\nand that he has never appear'd fince^ except that\nfhould be call'd an Appearance or Apparition which\nfpoke to St. Paul at his Converfion, when it is ex-\nprefly faid, he faw a Light, and heard a Voice, but\nfaw no Man 5 tho* afterwards he calls it feeing him^\nI Cor, XV. 8 .\nLaft of all he wasfeen of me alfo. Wh ere*\nas St. Paul^ we all know, did fpeak there of feeing\nChrift in the Flefli, while he was on Earth. But\nI fay, except this, we have no Example of any\nAppearance of the Divine Majefly in Humane\nShape, or in any other manner whatfoever.\nThat therefore we muft diftinguiih this from\nthe Subje\u00a3l we are now entering upon, for that the\nAppearances of God are extremely different from the\nApparitions of Creatures, whether Angels, Devils,\nor Souls of Men. That the Qucflion is nor. Whe-\nther God can do this or that> bur. Whether the Spi-\nrits, Spirits Inferior, can do it : and, which is yec\nmore to our Purpofe, Suppofe it has been fo for*\nmerly, and in ancient times, whether they do con-\ntinue to do fo flill, or have power to do ir, let\nthe Occafion be what it will.\nThus the Enquiry is reduc'd to a narrower\nCompafs. I take upon me the Affirmative j and we\nare now to look back into Time for the Confirma-\ntion or Proof of it, and by enquiring what has been,\ninform our felves of what may be, is, or is to be\ncxpeded, as occafion may require. And\n\fThe Hijiory and Reality\nAnd firft to defcribe the Thing, and expkin\nwhat is generally underftood by the Apparition of\nSpirits; that I may not hold you in Sufpence, or\nCriticife upon the bare Words Spirit and ^ppari*\ntion^ I come plainly to the Meaning, as I am to\nbe underftood in this Work : By Jpparition of Spi-\nrits, then, 1 mean, when the Invifible Inhabitants\nof the unknown World, be they who they will,\nafllime Humane Shapes, or other Shapes, and fliow\nthemfelves vifibly to us, fo as that we can fee them,\nfpeak to them, hear them fpeak, and the like.\nThis is what our People vulgarly qt^ Walkings\nand when any fuch thing appears, they know not\nwhat otherwife to call it, they fay Something walks ^\nand if it be , the Appearance of any known Perfon\nlately dead, they fay Such a one IValks.\nThus I lay every thing down with the utmoft\nplainnefs, that I may leave the Reader in no Un-\ncertainty about my Meaning in the Subject I am\nupon, or give room for CaviUngs or Difputings,\nat either the Thing it felf, or the manner of Ex-\nprefEng ti.\nWe fpeak in Vain\nOf Truth it felf^ unlefs *we fpeak it Plain,\nWords wrapt in Clouds^ till theirfull Meanings known\nj\nSuch Words are not the Hearer's^ but our own,\n^je End of Speakings lofi\n^or Speech was given to be underfiood.\nAsking Pardon for giving this Loofe to my\nThoughts, I return to the Subje6t, left I fhould\nbe but an Apparition my felf\nThe Apparitions I am to fpeak of are thefe.\n1.

II.\nOf the Appearance of Angels immediately in\nM'tffion as from Heaven ; and why we are\nto fuppofe thofe kinds of Apparitions are at\nan End.\nTHAT Angels have appeared to Men, wc have\nabundant Teftimony in the Hiftories of\nTimes Pail, as well Sacred as Prophane j nor {hall\nI fpend one Moment of your Time to examine, or\nconfirm it, except as it comes neceflarily in by\nthe occafion of other Difcourfe: For it is nouthe\nAppearance of Angels as fuch, but the Appearance\nof Angels in the Shape of Men, that is the prefenc\nEnquiry.\nThat this has been, is evident, and in general\nthe Scripture gives this Teftimony to it: when the\nApoftlc advifes to Hofpitality, and to entertain\nStrangers, he adds. For thereby fome have entertairCd\nAngels unawares, Heb. xiii. z. This muft be meant\nof Angels in Humane Shape, otherwife the hofpi-\ntable Perfon could not be miftaken in fuch a manner:\nBefides, it plainly refers to Abraham^ Gen. xviii. i.\nfitting in the Door of his Tent, ver. z. three Men\nItood by himj two of thefe were certainly Angels j\nwho the third was, I have (hewn already. It may\nlikewife include Lof, in whofe Story, Gen. xix. it is\nexprefs'd, ver. i. that they were two Angels, and\n'ver. 8. Lot calls them tbe\/e Men, and ver. lo, 12,\n16. they are called the Men-, fo that Lot believ'd\nthem to be Men only, and as fuch he not only in-\nvited them unto his Houfe, ver. z. but he made\nthem a Feall, and they did cat, ven j.\nThese\n\fof APPARITIONS.\nThese Apparitions of Angels, in the Shape of\nMen, are undeniable on other Occafionsj but when\nthey appear as Angels, it is faid fo plainly, and in\nfo many Words > as in the Cafe of Abraham^ when\nhe was going to offer his Son Ifaac^ Gen. xxii. 1 1.\n*the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham out of Hea*\n'ven J and again ver. i\nf. ^he Angel of the Lord called\nthe fecond time.\nThere are innumerable Examples of Angels\nappearing as Angels j but we are upon the Ap-\npearance of Angels as Men, and in the Shape and\nHabit of Men. The next Inflance is, of an Angel\nappearing to Jofhua^ and who is called the Captain\nof the Lord's Ho{l,< JofJo. v. 13. Jofhua looked^ and\nheboid there flood a Man over-againft him^ with a\nSword drawn in his Hand, Immediately JofJma^ Sol-\ndier-like, gives him the qui vi've^ or in EnglifJj^ who\nare you for? art thou for us, or for our Adverfaries?\nand the Spe<5tre or Apparition fpoke immediately\nagain, ver. 14. and then Joflma perceived that it\nwas not a Man, but an Angel in Apparition 5 and\nin the Heads or Contents of the Chapter, 'tis ex-\nprefly faid, an Aiigel appears to Jofhua.\nANOTHERExample is, of the Angel that ap-\npear'd to Manoah the Father of Sampfon-y his Wife\nindeed calls him a Man of God, and that he ap-\npeared to her 5 but fays, that his Countenance was\nlike an Angel of God, very terrible 5 Judges xiii. <5.\nBut ftill when he appeared a fecond time, it was in\nthe Shape of a Man, or elfe why did Manoah de-\nfire him to (lay 'till he could drefs a Kid for him ?\nand the Words are exprefs, ver. 16. He knew not\nthat it was an Angel of the Lord,\nThere are other Examples in Scripture, where\nthe Angels have appeared in Humane Shape, and\nconvers'd with Men upon Earth, befides fuch as\nhave appear'd in their real Angelick Form as An-\ngels. How and \\\\\\ what they were known to be\nC i Angels,\n\f7he Hiflory and Reality\nAngels, in what Form they have been feen, and in\nwliat Voice they fpoke, is not difcover'd to us in\nthe Scripture. Some are of Opinion, that even\nthofe Angels appear'd in the Shape of Men, and\ncloathed as Men 5 as the Angel that met Balaam\nwith a flaming Sword in his Handj the Angels\nwhich \"Jacob faw afcending and defcending on the\nLadder 5 the Angels that fpoke to Zacharias in the\nTemple, to the Virgin Mary in the Chamber,\nand that fat in the Sepulchre after Chrift was rifen,\nand asked the Difciples,'Z\u00a3;\/j'j\/y^^i: j^^ the Living among\nthe Dead? and fo in feveral Cafes: All that can be\nanfwer'd is, that the Text callM them Angels, and\nfo far we are not to doubt it j but I mull alfo al-\nlow, that they feem to me to have been in the\nFigure of Men 5 as for thofe in the Sepulchre,\nSt. Luke fays exprcfly, they faw two Men in fhining\nGarments, Luke xxiv. 4. and in the fame Chapter,\nver. 25. 'tis faid, they had feen a Vifion of Angels.\nThus far it relates to good Angels, fuch as\nkave been feen on Earth in Apparition, but have\nmade fuch an Appearance by vertue of the fuperior\nMillion, as the Angel Gabriel^ who tells Zaoharias^\nI am fent to \/peak unto thee.\nThat thefe have upon many occafions been\nfeen in Humane Shape is evident j and tho' much\nmore time might be fpent upon the Proof, I think\n'tis needlefsj indeed the Evidence is fufficient.\nThere is a Queflion dill remaining, relating\nto this Part, (yiz) How comes it to pafs that all\nthis is ceafed, and that the Angels have done\ncoming, or are no more fent offuch Errands ? but that\nall the Angels we have any Account of in thefc\nDays, are of a worfe kind, and generally come\nupon worfe Errands ? and which particular Obfer-\nvation is the very reafon of our Doubts, whether\nthe Appearance of the other is real or not.\nThis\n\fof APPARITIO NS. IX\nThis Queftion might be anfwer'd many Ways,\nbuc 'tis too grave, for the Times j and as we are\nnot writing Divinity, I fhall not load you with\njferious Points : The fhort Account of it is this :\nIVe have now.^ more fure Word of Prophecy : (that\nis) that lince the Preaching of the Gofpel, and\nthe Revelation of God by a written Word, there\nis no more need of what the Text calls a miniftra^\ntion of Angels, The Scripture is a daily Revelation,\nand the Spirit of God, who is promifed to lead us,\nis a daily Infpiration, there is no more need of\nVifion and Apparition 5 and this is that glorious Dif-\nference between the Revelations of thofe Days,\nand thefe of ours, and the reafon of the Difference\nbetween the Apparitions of thefe Times and of\nthofe.\nWhen I am fpeaking things ferious, I am to\nfpeak very fhorc, that I may not fhock your rea-\nding 5 the Tafte of the Times happening at this Jun-\ncture to lye another way : but my next Article per-\nhaps may make you amends, I mean the Appear-\nance of the grand Arch-Angel of all, and, as I fup-\npofe, the only Arch- Angel out of Heaven, namely\nthe Devil.\nCHAP. Ill\nOf the Appearance of the Devil \/\/\/\nHumane Shape.\nPRAY obferve, when I am fpeaking of the Ap-\npearance of the Devil, it is not to tell you\nthat he can and does appear among us at this\ntime 5 fo you need not look over your Shoulders\nto fee for him, or at the Candles, to fee\nC 3 if\n\f12 The Hijiory and Reality\nif they burn Blue, at leafl: not yet > 'tis time\nenough for that by and by.\nBut I am examining now the matter of Fa\u00a3t\nonly, as (i.) Whether the Devil can appear here, yea\nor no 5 whether he is allowed to come, that his Chain\nreaches fo far, and that his Tether is long enough?\nalfo, (i.) Whether he is ever fent or direded to\ncome, or that he comes of his own accord, and a-\nbouthis own Bufinefs? And as all thefe will lead me\nto enquire what has been 5 from thence we may\nbefl judge, what is, or may be.\nThat he has upon fpecial Occafions appeared\nin former Times is certain, as well from Scripture as\nancient Hiftory, and a fmall Retrofpe6b will fatisfie\nyou in that Point. If it appears that he has been\nhere, then 'tis very probable his Chain is long e-\nnough, and that he is allow'd the Liberty to come\nfo far from Home. For we have no Authority to\nfay, or to believe, that his Tether is fhorten'd, or\nthat he is more reftrain'd now than ever he was\nbefore.\nHis cntring the Garden of God in the begin-\nning of Time, and the Havock he made there, the\nturning Jdam and E^ve out, and even turning the\nwhole frame of Nature upfide down by his vile\nDoings there j all this I have mention'd : But we\nhave more yet to fay of him 5 for he is ftill in Being,\nand ftill the fame malicious Devil, the fame De-\nftroyer and Accufer that ever he was j the Flame of\nFire fet to guard the Garden, did not burn himj\nthe Deluge didn't drown him : Nor has Juftice\nthought fit yet to take him into its Iron Hands,\ntho' it will certainly do it at laft; and, as the Scri-\npture fays in another Cafe, his Damnation flum*\nbereth not 5 for Juftice is truly reprefented\nWith Leaden Feet and Iron Hands^ to Jhow\nIt will be eertainy tho' it may he flow.\nThe\n\fof APPARiriO N S. 13\nThe firft time we meet with the Devil's per-\nfonal Appearance upon Earth, I mean after the \u2022\nFlood, is in the Story o^Job-y nor by all the Cal-\nculations of Times, which the learned Chronolo-\ngcrs of thofc Days have made, could that be long\nafter it j for Eliphaz the Temanite could not be far-\nther off than the Grandfon of Efau^ or thereabouts.\nGen. xxxvi. ii.\nI N Job's Time, the Text fays that the Sons of\nGod came to prefent themfelves before the Lord^ and\nSatan came alfo among them. So that it feems the Angel\nof Light was drefs'd up like the Sons of G o d,\neven in thofe ancient Days> and it is not likely that\nthis was the firft Time neither: Again, it feems\nby the Text, that tho' God himfelf might know\nSatan in that Difguife, yet the People, among whom\nhe came, did not know him.\nThe Anfwerlikewife which he makesto the Qiie-\nllion, implies ftrongly, that Satan had been wonE\nto walk among thofe Sons of God in Difguife long\nbefore that > for when God fays to him, whence\ncomeft thou ? his Anfwer feems to be a kind of gene-\nral, 1 come from following my known Bufi-\nnefs, my old Trade j doeft thou know I am a roar-\ning Lion, and doeft thou ask me whence I come?\nWhy, I come from feeking who I may devour,\nranging the World, going to and fro in the Earth,\nand walking up and down in this Difguife, as thou\nnow feeft me, that I may do all the Mifchief I can.\nGod's Return again to Satan confirms it, as if\nthe Lord had faidj Well, Satan, then thou muft\nhave feen my Servant Job ? Haft thou confider'^d him,\ntloat there is none like him in the Earth ?\nThe Devil makes an Anfwer that implies he\nIcnew Job very well. Do 1 know him to be a good\nMan! yes: But then I know him to be a rich Man\ntoo : 'Tis an cafy thing for a Man to be honeft,\nthat is fo richj he can have no room for asking\nC 4 more:\n\f24 7\/6^ Hijlory and Reality\nmore: What fhould he fteal for, or be a Knave for,\nthat is the richeil Man in the World ? What fhould\nhe covet, that has no room for Defire? But if thou\nhaft: a Mind to try his Honefty, and his Piety, his\nFear of thee, and his Hatred of Evil, blaft: his\nWealth, and take his prodigious Flocks and Herds\nof Cattle awayj level him, bring him to be like\nother Men in Riches, and reduce him to Beggary,\nand then fee if he won't be like other Men in Crime >\nnay, he'll be raging and furious, and curfe thee t9\nthy Face.\nThis, tho' it may feem remote, is to my Pur-\npopfe thus : it fhows that the Devil was no Stran-\nger among the People. He had walk'd up and\ndown in Difguife, fo as to know them all, and their\nCircumfl:ance J He had been drefs'd up like one of\nthe reft in Human Shape, fo that he could not be\nknown from the very befl: of Men, no not from\nthe Sons of God.\nSome are of Opinion, by the Sons of God there,\nis meant the patriarchal Heads of Families, who had,\nin right of Primogeniture, thePriefthood in Courfe,\nand were the only Sacrificers at that Time, as Abra-\nham^ and as Job were \\ fo that in fhort Satan has long\nago drefs'd himfelf in the Habit of the Clergy. BleS\nus all! we hope he does not do fo ftill \\ for if the\nDevil fhould put on the Gown and Caflbck, or the\nblack Cloak, or the Coat and the Cord, and be\nwalking about the World in that Difguife now,\nhoweafilymay we be cheated, and miflake the Sons\nof God for the Prince of Darknefs.^ and how\ncould we tell one from t'other ?

I have ftarted a Quellion j poffi-\nbly my Opinion is with the affirmative, at leaft I\nthink it poffible, and that it is Rational to believe it 5\nperhaps I may name you as improbable a Notion,\nand much more inconfiftent with the Chriftian\nReligion, which yet Philofophy bids us call rational,\nand diredts us to believe.\nHow are we put to it to form Inhabitants for\nthe Planetary Worlds : Philofophy fays they are ha-\nbitable Bodies, folid, opaac, as this Earth, and we\nwill have them be inhabited alfo, whether it be\nwith or without, for or againft ourReafon and Un-\nderftanding j 'tis no Satisfadion to them, or will it\nflop\n\fef APPARITIONS. 17\nflop their Cavils, to fay 'tis not Faftj that they are\nnot habitable J that both Saturn and Jupiter are un-\ncomfortably dark, unfufFerably cold, would congeal\nthe very Soul (if that were poflible) and fo are not habi-\ntable on that Account j that Mercury and Venus are\ninfufferably hot, that the very Water would always\nboyl, the Fire burn up the Vitals j andthat,inniort,\nno human Creatures could fubfift in fuch Heat;\nBut this is not fatisfa6tory neither > but rather than\nnot have all thofe opaac Worlds be inhabiied, and\neven their Satellites or Moons about them too, they\nwill have God be obliged to create a Species of Bo-\ndies fuitable to their feveral Climates.\nI N Saturn they are to live without Eyes, or be a\nKind fo illuminated from their own internal Heat\nand Light, that they can fee fufEciently by their\nown Beams.\nIn Jupiter there muft be another Kind, that can\nlive in Twilight, and by the Refleftion of its own\nMoons, and fubfift in continued Froft.\nIn Mercury the Species muft be all Salamanders,\nand live in the continued Fire of the Sun's Beams,\nmore intenfe than what would be fufficient to burn\nall our Houfes, and melt our Copper, Lead, and\nIron in the very Mines 5 fo the Inhabitants muft be\nof a Kind better able to bear the Fire than thofe\nMetals, and would ftill live tho' they were continu-\nally calcining if not vitrifying into Giafs.\nI N Fenus the Heat would boil the Water, and con-\nfequently the Blood in the Body, and a Set of hu-\nman Bodies muft be form'd that could live always\nin a hot Bath, and neither fweat out their Souls,\nor melt their Bodies.\nI N MarSy fo very dry in its Nature, no Vegetables\nor Senfatives could fubfift that we have any Notion\nof, for want of Moifture y and the Men that liv'd\nthere muft be dried up fufHciently for pulverizing\non any fuitable Occafion, I wean human Beings, and\nof our Species. Now\n\fThe Hiftory and Reality\n'\nN ow if God muft not be fuppofed to have crea-\nted fo many habitable Bodies without peopling them,\nand that it would refle6t upon his Wifdom to lay\nfo much of his Creation walte 5 that all the Planets\nfhould feem to be made for nothing but to range\nabout the Wafte as a kind of dark Inhabitants 5 of\nno ufe but to fhine a little, and that with but bor-\nrow'd Beams too, upon this little Point called\nEarth, where only a Set of Rationals can exift 5 I\nfay, if this muft not be fuppofed, but on the con-\ntrary there are certainly People of one Kind or\nanother in all thofe Bodies, let the Trouble of ma-\nking them be what it will; if this be the Cafe,\nand that this muft be believed in fpight of fo ma-\nny Difficulties and Inconfiftencies 5 then allow mc\nto argue a little upon the following Enquiry.\nWhy may I not as well fuggeft, and that with\nevery jot as much Probability, that there are, or at\nleaft may be, a certain Number of appointed Inha-\nbitants in the vaftly-extended Abyfs of Space, a\nkind of Spirits (other than the Angels good or bad,\nand other than the unembodied or uncafed Souls of\nMen) who dwell in the invifible World, and in the\nVaft No'where of unbounded Space, of which wc\ncan neither fay what it is, what it contains, or how\ndetermined : That Great Wafte, of whofe Extent\n'tis hardly poffible even the Soul itfelf can conceive,\nand of which all the Accounts we give, and Guefles\nwe make, are fo remote, look fo Enthufiaftic, fo\nimprobable, and fo like impoflible, that inftead of\ninforming the ignorant Part of the World by it,\nwe only arm them with Jeft and Ridicule, and re-\nfolve them into incurable Unbeliefj depending that\nwhat it is not poffible to Conceive of, is not poffi-\nble to Be.\nNow is this immenfe Space indeed a Void? is it\nall a Wafte? is it utterly defolate? or is it inhabited\nand peopled by the Omnipotent Maker, in a manner\nfqited\n\fof APPAR ITIONS.\nfuited to his own Glory, and with fuch Inhabitants\nas are fpirituous, invifible, and therefore perfedly\nproper to the Place?\n1 MUST needs fay, 'tis much more rational to\nfuggeft this to be, than to bring out a Species of\nhuman bodies to live in the Intenfe Heat of Mer-\ncury^ or the acute Cold of Jupiter and Saturn. The\nlatter is agreeable to the general Underftanding\nwe all have of fpirituous Beings : We* are well af-\nfured there are feme always there, and* that they\ncan very well fubfiil there 5 that the Place is fuit-\nable to them, and that there arc Spirits of fome\nKind or others and why not fuch as we fuggeft ?\nIt remains then only to examine what Commu-\nnication thefe Spirits have with us, whether they\nare or are not able to hold Converfation with us,\nand whether they really do converfe familiarly with\nus, yea or no?\nI F it ihould be granted that there are fuch Spi-\nrits in Being, and that they pafs and repafs, exift,\nand have Egrefs and Regrefs there 5 that they inha-\nbit, as a certain bombaitic Author has it,\n'Thro' all the liquid Mazes of the Sky ;\nI fay, if this fhould be granted, then it remains\nthat here is a fourth Species that may aflume Shapes\n5\nfor Spirits may do that, and may appear among us,\nmay converfe with our embodied Spirits, and from\nthofe we may receive abundance of additional In-\ntelligence from the World of Spirits, whether by\nDream, Vifion, Appearance, or any fuperior way,\nfuch as to them in their great Knowledge of things\nIhall feem meet. To fpeak as diftin6fcly of this nice\nPart as I can, admit me to explain my felf a little.\nIf we grant that Spirit, tho' invifible in it felf,\nmay aflume Shape, may veft it felf fo with Flefh\nand Blood, that is feemingly, fo as to form an Ap-\npearance,\n\f3^ The Hijlory and Reality\npearance, then all Spitic may do itj fince wc have\nno Rule given us by which we may diftinguiih\nSpirits one from another, I mean as to their a6t-\nings in the Capacity of Spirits : Wc may indeed,\nas I have faid already, diftinguifh them by the Ef-\nfed, that is to fay, by the Errand they come on,\nand by the manner of their Operations, as whe-\nther they are good or evil Spirits j but not by\ntheir Nature as Spirit. The Devil is as really\na Spirit, xho' a degenerated, fallen, and evil\nSpirit, I fay, he is as much a Spirit to all the In-\ntents and Purpofes of a Spirit that wc are capable\nto judge of, as an Angel j and he is called the evil\nSpirit > He has Invilibility, and Multiprefence,\nas a Spirit has j he can appear tho' the Doors be\n{hut 5 and go out, tho' bolted and barr'd in> no\nPrifon can hold him, but his laft eternal Dungeon ^\nno Chains can bind him, but the Chains faften'd\non hina by Heaven, and the Angel of the bottom-\nIcfs Pit J no Engine or human Art can wound him j\nin {hort, he is neither to be feen, felt, heard, or\nunderftood, unlefs he pleafes > and he can make him-\nfelf be both feen and heard too, if he pleafes j for\nhe can affumc the Shape and Appearance of Man\nor Beaft, and in thefe Shapes and Appearances can\nmake himfelf vifible to us, terrify and affright us,\nconverfe in a friendly or in a frightful manner\nwith us, as he thinks fitj he can be a Companion\nand Fellow-Traveller in the Day, an Apparition\nand a horrible Monfter in the Night : in a Word,\nhe can be among us, and a6t upon, and with us,\nvifibly or invidbly as he pleafes, and as he finds\nfor his purpofe.\nNow if he does, and can do thus, meerly as he\nis a Spirit, and by his fpiritual Nature, we have\na great deal of Reafon to believe, that all Spirit may\ndo the fame 5 or at leaft I may ask. Why may not\nall Spirit do the fame ? and if there are any Kinds\nof\n\fof APPARITIONS. 31\nof Spiritjas is not improbable, befides thofe we have\nhitherto conceiv'd of, they may be reafonably fup-\npofed to be vefted with the fame Powers, ani may\nexert thofe Powers in the fame or a hke manner.\nI F any Man asks me how I make out the Pro-\nbability of thefe differing Species of i>pirits? I an-\nfwer as above, by this. That it appears there are\ninvifible Operations and a fecret Converfe carried\non among Men from the World ofSpirits, where-ever\nthat is, which cannot, at leafl to our Underftandings,\nbe fuppofed to be the Work either of thofe particular\nor proper Angels which refidc in Heaven, or the in-\nfernal Angels either 5 that thefe Spirits, or if you pleafe\nto call them Angels, appear and converfe for Good,\nand therefore may not be fuppofed to be the De*\n*z;\/7,or from theZ)m\/; It is faid indeed, that they a6b\nby a vifible kind of Reftrainr, in doing Good with\nafort of anlmperfeftion and manifeft Debility 5 foas\nfometimes to aft, as it were, to no purpofe, being\nnot able to make the Good they aim at effedual,\nand therefore cannot be from Heaven, the Foun-\ntain of Good ; who, as he is Good, fo he is in-\nfinitely able to do all the Good that be appears\nwilling to do; But this, I think, confirms rather\nthan confutes my Opinion 5 for, it proves them to\nbe fent, and under particular Commiffion ; it only\nfuggefts, that 'tis probable there are Spirits who\nmay be more confin'd and reflrain'd in their Power\nof adting, fome than others, and this is not at all\njnconfiftent with the Nature of the thing.\nThe great, and perhaps the ftrongeft Argu-\nment which our learned Men produce for the\nCredit of their new Philofophy is, that by this\nthey can the better folve the Difficulties of feve-\nral other Phoenomena^ which before were hardly\nintelligible, or at lead which they could not ac-\ncount for any other way.\nIn\n\f3 2 The Hijlory and Reality\nI N like manner, tho* the Certainty of my Sug-\ngeftion cannot be arrived to, or fuppofing it can-\nnot, and that at bell it is but a Speculation,\nfcarcely can be called an Hypothefts^ and that no\nEvidence can be given for it, yet this mud be faid of\n\u00bb\nit, that by this Notion we may folve feveral other\nDifficulties which we cannot underftand any other\nWay: fuch as^\nFIRSTj How it is, and from whence, or by\nwhofe Agency we frequently receive fuch kind No-\ntions of Good or Evil as 'tis certain we do, and\nyet without receiving any farther Affiftance, which\nperhaps it is not in the Power of the kind Infor-\nmer to give us, either for the avoiding or embracing\nthe Evil or the Good which they give us No-\ntice of?\nWhat can it be that communicates thefe ap-\nproaching diftant things, and which it is fo much\nour Intereft and Concern to know ? If it were an\nevil Spirit, I mean a Devilj as 1 have faid above, he\nwould never concern himfelf fo much for our Bene-\nfit, feeing he is known to will our Ruin to the ut-\nmoll of his Endeavour, and to wifli us to fall into\nall poffible Mifchief and Difailer.\nO N the other hand, it cannot be from Heaven\nor from the Angels > for the Works of God are all,\nlike himfelf, perfed, and he would not fo far difho-\nnour his Meflengers, as to allow them, nay to fend\nthem (for they could never come unfent) to give\nus Notice of Evil, and yet take it out of our Power^\nto avoid it 3 or to foretell good things at hand, and\nthen give us no Power to embrace them, or to lay\nhold of them i\nand it would neither confift with\nthe infinite Goodnefs, or with the infinite Juftice,\nto do thus by his Creatures.\nBesides, 'tis a kind of incongruous a6ting, un-\nworthy of the fupreme Power, unworthy an An-\ngel's appearing s it rather fhews that it is the Pro-\n4 dud\n\fof APPARITIONS. 33\nduft of fome intelligent Being, who tho* it means\nGood, and has a beneficent Nature that would\ncontribute to our Safety and Profperity if it could^\nyet is under fome Limitations of its aftings, is not\nable to proceed in the Good it has attempted, that\ncan juft do us fo much Service as to give us Notice\nof what may await us behind the dark Curtain of\nFuturity 5 but has no Power to go any farther, 01^\nto give'any AfSftance to us in purfuing proper Me-\nthods for our Deliverance 5 no, not fo much as to\ngive Diredions, much lefs Powers to ad j as\na Child difcovering a Fire begun in a Houfe,\nmay cry out and alarm the Family, but is able to\ndo no more, no not fo much as to tell them where*\nabout it is, or which way they fhould go about to\nefcape from it, much lefs to quench or prevent it.\nThese imperfe6b Notices, I fay, feem to proceed\nfrom fome good and kind Being, which is near us^\nexifling, tho' out of our Knowledge, yet not fd\nremote, but that it is in Condition to fee and\nknow things good or evil, which tho' approaching^\nis yet out of our View, and which, if we could\ntake the filent Hint, it might be infinitely for out ^\nAdvantage, but is able to do no more*\nNow, if fuch Notices, whether to the Mind\nby Dreams when afleep, or by waking Im^ulfe, or by\nVoice, or by Apparation > if they were from Heavea\nthey would never be fo imperfeft and unaffiftingj\nwe cannot fuppofe Heaven would concern irfelf to\ngive us Notices of Danger impending, of Enemies\nlying in wait, of Mifchiefs approaching, and would\nthen leave us to fall into the Snare by an unavoid-\nable Neceflity.\nAs to what thefe Spirits therefore are, where\nthey refide, what Circumftances they are in, and\nhow they have accefs to our Underltandings, I ac-\nknowledge the Difficulty to be great, and do not pre*\ntend to enter upon it here 5 that they may fometimes\nappear is not improbable: But I hope I may fay,\nD that\n\fJ 4 The H'tfior^ and Reality\nthat all Apparitions arc not the Devil^ nor yet may\nthey be Angels immediately from Heaven, for ma-\nny Reafons.\nFIRST', From theMcanncfs of the Occafions, I\nmean of fome of the Occafions, on which thefe\nthings happen. That there are Angels fent from\nHeaven on particular MefTages and Errands, to ful-\nfil the Mind and Will of their Maker and Sove-\nreign, all Men muft grant j I have already prov*d it,\nand abundance of Examples may be given of it, be-\nfides thofe already named } but we never find thofe\nAngels coming upon trifling Errands, and for things\nof mean Import, 'the j^ngel of the LO RD appeared\nto Gideon at the Threfhing- floor, to fummon him\nto the Deliverance of the whole Nation of ISRAEL :\n^he Jngel of the LO RD appeared to David with\nhis drawn Sword, threatning Deftruftion to Jeru-\nfalem : The Angels appear'd to the Shepherds to fig-\nnify the Birth o\u00a3 CHRIS f-y as an Angel had done\nto the Virgin to falute her, and tell her what great\na Work was to be wrought in her : Angels ap-\npear'd to minifter to CHRIST' after his Temp-\ntation in the Wildernefs> and an Angel appear'd\nflrengthening him in his Agony, and Angels have\nappear'd on m.any oiher fuch eminent Occafions;\nbut not except fuch Occafions were eminent, and\nthat particularly fo.\nBut here you have an old Woman dead, one that,\nit may be, has hid a little Money in the Orchard or\nGarden; and an Apparition, is fuppos'd, comes and\ndifcovers it, by leading the Perfon it appears to,\nto the Place, and making fome Signal that he\nfhould dig there for fomewhat ; or a Man is dead,\nand having left a Legacy to fuch and fuch, the\nExecutor does not pay it, and an Apparition comes\nand haunts this Executor 'till he docs Juftice.

To\nfay it is the Soul or Ghoft of the departed Perfon,\nand that he could not be at reft, 'till the injur'd\nPerfon be Righted, is advanced upon no PrincipJe\nthat is agreeable to the Chriftian Doftrine at all;\nfor if the Soul is happy, is it reafonable to believe\nthat the Felicity of Heaven can be interrupted\nby fo trivial a Matter, and on fo flight an Occafion?\nif the Soul be unhappy, remember the great Gulph\nfix'dj there is no room for us to believe that thofc\nmiferable Souls have any Lcifure or Liberty to come\nback upon Earth on an Errand of fuch a Nature.\nIn a word, there is nothing but Difficulty in it on\nevery fide : Apparitions there are, we fee no room\nto doubt the Reality of that Part j but what, who, or\nfrom whence, is a Difficulty which I fee no way to\nextricate our felves from, but by granting that there\nmay be an appointed, deputed fort of ftationary Spi*\nrits in the invifiblc World, who come upon thefe Oc-\ncafions, and appear among us i which Inhabitants or\nSpirits (you may call them Angels if you pleafc) Bo-\ndies they are not, and cannot be, neither had they\nbeen ever embodied 5 but fuch as they are, they have a\nPower of convcrfing among us, and particularly wi^h\nSpirits embodied, and can by Dreams, Impulfes and\nllrongAvcrfions, move our Thoughts, and give Hope,\nraife Doubts, fink our Souls to-day, elevate them\nto-morrow, and many ways operate upon our Paf-\nfions and Affe6i:ions } may give Intimations of Coed\nor Evil 5 but cannot, thro' fomc unknown Reftraint\nupon their Power, go any farther, fpeak any plainer,\nor give the leaft Affiftanceto us, no, not by Gouuqil\nor Diredion to guide us or cell us hgw to ad forour\nown Prcfervation. D z I\n\f^6 The Hiflory and Reality\nI A M told that thefe may be good Angeh for all\nthat, and that it is no juft way of arguing, to fay\nfuch things are too trifling to fend an Angel from\nHeaven upon fo mean an Errand, and upon fo in-\nconiiderable an Affair j fince we fee Providence\ndaily giving Teftimony, not of its Government\nonly, but of its Care and Concern, in and about\nthe meaneft Affairs of Life: and that the Scri-\npture it fclf frequently gives Examples of it, in his\nfeeding the Ravens, taking care of the Sparrows,\nclothing the Grafs of the Field, numbring the\nHairs of our Head, t3c. So that Infinite is not li-\nmited or ty'd up, to or from any degree of afting.\nNor is there any thing great, or any thing fmall, but\nas God is feen in his leaft Creatures, Infefts, Mites,\nand the likej fo he is aftive in the moft trifling\nEvent: Nor does that Providence, who yet pro-\ntedts us in, and delivers us from Danger, always a6k\nalike, but as the Sovereignty of his A6tings is not\nto be difputed, fo neither is his Wifdom impeach'd\nby fuffcring Evil to fall upon Man, which the\nleaft hint from his Light might have guided him\nto prevent.\nI THINK this is the utmoft that can be faid in\nthe Cafe, and yet it does not reach us at all 5\nfor this is not the meaning of my Objection, no,\nnor is it the Subftance of it > I am not fpeaking of\nProvidence concerning it felf in the Care of its\nCreatures, I acknowledge all that 5 but then this Pro-\nvidence a6ls in its own Way, and by its own invifi-\nble Operations 5 nor is rhtre any occafion for the\nAgency of fuch extraordinary Inftruments, and\ntherefore it may be, that Angels are never fent as\nExprefTes upon fuch Things.\nThe King or Government of a Nation may in-\nfluence the whole Body of the People, at what-\never Diftance, by the Power of his Laws, direfting\nthe Magiflrates, and the Inferior Officers, to aft in\nthe\n\fof APPARITIONS. 37\nthe Name of the Supreme > and this is done with-\nout any Step out of the ordinary way of the Admi-\nniftration. But if any extraordinary Occafion re-\nquire, then a Meflenger is difpatch'd with particu-\nlar Inftruftions, and fpccial Power, as the particular\nCafe may require.\nSo Providence, (which is, in a word, the admini-\nilration of Heaven's Government in the World)\nads in its ordinary Courfe, and in the ufnal Way,\nwith an univerfal Influence upon all Things, and\nnothing is below its Concern > but when extraordi-\nnary Things prefent, then th? particular exprefs\nMefTengers from Heaven, {viz. the Angels) are fenc\nwith Inilruftions on that particular Affair which\nthey are difpatch'd about, and no other. And I may\nventure to fay, thefe are never fent upon Trifles,\nnever fent but on extraordinary Occafions, and to\nexecute fome fpecial Commiflionj and this comes\ndire\u00a3tly to the Cafe in hand.\nI N the next Place I demand, when cou'd it be\nfaid, or what Example can be given, where an\nAngel from Heaven has been fent to give any par-\nticular Perfon Notice of approaching Dangers, and\nat the fame time left the Mind unalarm'd, and in a\nftate of Indolence, not capable of rouzing it felf\nup to fhun and avoid the Danger threaten'd, or\n\u2022without Direction and Affiftance to prevent or ef-\ncape it J this is what I alledge is unworthy of the\nDivine Wifdom and Goodncis.\nLook into all the Meflages or Notices that have\nbeen given from Heaven on fuch Occafions, in all\nthe Hiftories of the Scripture, or almoft elfewhere,\nand you will fee the difference evidently. Take a few\nfor Example.\nTwo Angels are fent to Sodom, not only to de-\nftroy the City for its Wickednefs, but to fave Lot.\nWell, they come to him, they tell him what they\nare about to do, and that they are fent to do itj\nD 3 namely.\n\f3? The Bijiory and Reality\nnamely, to burn the City. This might have been\nenough 5 and perhaps, had it been noric'd to him by\nthe Spirits I am fpeaking of, this had been allj and\nif Lot had not taken their kind Information, it had\nbeen his own Faulty nay, as it was, the Text faysj\nLot lingered, and 'tis plain he left the City with a\nkind of Relufbance.\nBut the kind McfTengers do not fatisfie them-\nfelvcs with giving him the Warning, but they roufe\nup his Indolence.

The kind Monitor does not\nname the Traytors and AfTaflinators to him, and fay\nBrutus^ and Caffius^ Cafca^ and others, wait there to\nkill you 5 as the Angel to Jofeph^ Herod will feek the\nyoung Child to dejlroy him.\nA ND on the other fide, C^farjhold and unalarm'd,\nindolent, and having things not fufficiently explained\nto him J (and th \" good Spirit, as may be fuppos'd,\nable to do no more for him j) goes on, enters the\nSenate Houfe, moc';s the Southfayer, and tells him\nthe\n\fof APPAR ITIO NS.\nthe Ides of March are come^ who (harply return'd.\nBut they are not paft.

V.\nOf the Appearance of departed Unembo-\ndied Soul.\nI\nNOW come to the main and moft difputed\nPart of ftiadowy Appearance, 'viz, the Appari-\ntion of Unembodied Soul.\nI T is a material Difficulty here, and ought to be\nconfider'd with the utmoft Plainnefs, (yiz) what\nwe mean by Unembodied Souhy whether we under-\nfland Souls which have been encas'd in Flefh, but be-\ning unhous'd are now moving abou'-, in what State\nwe know not, and are to be fpoken of as in their\nfeparate Capacity: Or whether there is any fuch\nthing as a Mafs of Soul, as a learned but pretty\nmuch inconfiftent Writer calls it, which waits to\nbe embodied, as thefuperior Difpofer of that Affair,\n(be chat who or what he pleafes) may direct.\nThis I confefs is to me fomething unintelligi-\nble, looks a little Platonick^ and as if it were a-kin\nto the Tranfmigration-Whimfie of the Ancients j\nbut if they would found it upon any thing rational,\nit muft be upon the Suggeftion mentioned above,\nviz. of a middle Clafs of Spirit, neither Angclick-\nHeavenly, or Angelick- Infernal : But Spirits inha-\nbiting the invidble Spaces, and allow'd to a6t and\nappear here, under exprefs and greatly llrain'd Li-\nmitations, fuch as arc already defcrib'd, and of which\nmuch more may (till be faid.\nBut that I may clear up your Doubt as to the\nPart I am upon, 1 have added at the Head of this\nSe6i:ion, the Word Departed^ to intimate to you,\nthat I am Orthodox in my Notion j that I am none\nof the Seft of Soul- Sleepers, or for iroprifoning\nSouls\n\fof APPARITIONS. 4y\nSouls in a Limhus of the Ancients; but that, in a\nfew Words, by the Appearance of Souls Unembo-\ndied, I mean fuch as having been embodied or im-\nprifon'd in Flefli, are difcharg'd from that Confine-\nment, or as I call it unhoused and turn-d out of\nPoficffion. For I cannot agree that the Soul is in\nthe Body, as in a Prifon j but rather that, like a rich\nNobleman, he is pleas'd to inhabit a fine Country\nSeat or Palace of his own Building, where he\nrefolves to live and enjoy himfelf, and does fo, *till by\nthe Fate of things his fine Palace being over-turn'd,\nwhether by an Earthquake or othcrwife, is bury'd\nin its own Ruins, and the noble Owner turn'd out\nof Pofleffion, without a Houfe.\nThis Soul, we are told, and I concur in theO-\npinion, has fometimes made a Tour back into this\nWorld J whether Earth, or the Atmofphere of the\nEarth, call it where you will, andexprefsit howyou\nwill, it matters not much; Whence it comes, how far\nthe Journey, how, and why it came hither, and a-\nbovc all, how it goes back again, and what thofe\nvarious Apparitions are which counterfeit thefe\nSpirits: enquire within, and you fhall know\nfarther.\nThat the Unembodied Souls of Men Dead,\nas we fay Departed, have appeared, we have af-\nfirm'd from the Authority of the Scripture; which\nI muft allow to be an authentick Document, what-\never the Reader may pleafe to do; 'till a Hiftory\nmore authentick, and of better Authority may be\nproduc'd in the Room of ic.\nA s to the Appearance of Samuel^ rais'd by the\nWitch, I defpife it, as it is ofFer'd in the Capacity\nof a Soul, much more as the Unembodied Soul of\nSamuel \\ which iho' it might have been caus'd to\nappear, as the Sovereign of all Spirits, with whom\nthe Soul of Samuel is at Red:, had thought fit ; yet\ncould no more be fummon'd from that Reft, by\nthe\n\f4^5 The Hijlory and Reality\nthe Conjuration of an old Witch, than the Devil\ncould fetch it out of Heaven by Force. Nor was it\nlikely that God, who refus'd fo much as to fpeakto that\nabandon'd Prince, whom he had fo righteoufly re-\njc6ted, and that would anfwer him neither by Urim^\nor by 'Thummim^ that would neither hear his Prayer,\nor accept his Offering, would hear a Witch, a\nCreature likewife fentenc'd to Death by his own\nrighteous Law, and fend Samuel at her Infernal\nPaw-wawing from Heaven, to tell Saul that to-\nmorrow he fhould be cut in Pieces by the Phili\"\nfiines'y there feems to be no Confiflency at all\nin it, no, none at all.\nThe Appearance of the Thing calPd Samuel^\nwas, in my Opinion, neither more or lefs than a\nPhantafm or Spedtre, which (as the Devil is allow'd\nto do) might perfonate the old departed Prophet,\nand who, at the Witch's Summons, and by Hea-\nven's Permiilion, came up to pronounce the dread-\nful Sentence upon Saul^ and let him fee what was\nthe Effe6t of his forfaking God, and rejefbing his\nProphet Samuel, And thus it might be allow'd alfo\nto fpeak in the firft Perfon of the Prophet, as it\ndid> nor do i fay, or think, as fome do, that it was\nthe Devil in Samuel'^ Likenefs 5 if it had, 'tis not\nlikely the old Woman would have been fo frighted\nas to cry out, feeing fhe was better acquainted\nwith the Devil^ than to be furpriz'd, if it had been\nher old Familiar.\nB u T fhe faw fomething fhe did not cxpefl:, and\nperhaps had never feen before j for fhe tells the\nKing, fhe faw Gods afcending out of the Earth\n;\nby which I cannot but underftand, fhe faw fome\nof thofe Spirits which I have mention'd, which\nare not Infernal, and who might forefee what the\nDevil himfelf cannot 5 for I have no reafon to be-\nlieve that Satan knows any thing of Futurity.\nIf\n\fof APPARITIONS. 47\nI Fit be asked here, by what Authority the Witch\ncould bring up one even of thefe Spirits 5 that in-\ndeed may be difficult to anfwer, other than thus,\nthat it might be as Balaam was over-rul'd to blefs,\nwhen he mtended to curfej and that at her Call,\nand to pronounce the approaching Fate of Saul^\nand Jfrael^iih him, fhe might beover-ruPd, and fo\ncaird up, or call'd in, a good Spirit inllead of the\nDevil.\nAs for the Speftre's fpeaking in the Name of\nSamuel in the Scripture, and the Text reprefen-\nting it as if it were really Samuel himfelf, i Sam,\nxxviii. If. JndS^mvitl [aid to Saul, why haft thou\ndifquieted me^ to bring me up? I take it to be an Ex-\npreiHon^i Hominem^ to the common Underflanding,\nand to be underftood as all Allegorick or Figurative\nExpreffions are underftood j and it no more proves\nthat it was Samuel^ and is no more to be taken lit-\nterally, than the other Words in the fame Verfe\nare to be litterally underftood.\nI. WHT haft thou di[quieted me? as if it was in\nSauV^ Power, by the Conjurations of an ab-\nhorr'd condemned Limb of the Devil^ a profcrib'd \u2022\nWitch, to difquiet the departed Soul of Samuel-^\nthe Meaning is no more than this, What is your Bu-\nfinefs with me, what do you trouble me -for? You\nthat defpifed me, and a6ted contrary to all my Di-\nre6tions, and would go on in your Perverfenefs in\nfpite of me, and of all I could fay to youj what\ndo you come to me for, now I am dead ?\n1. 'to bring me up? intimating that Samuel was\nbelow, or was called ab InferiSy which is contrary\nto Reafon as well as Religion, and neither confifts\neither with our Notion, or any body's elfe, except it be\nthe Soul-fleepers, who tell us, the Soul fleeps with\nthe Body in the Grave 'till the Refurredlion 5 and if\nfo, then muft the old Woman have had Power to\nawake him whenever Ae pleas'd.\nf Upon\n\f4 8 The yjjifiory and Reality\nUpon the whole, it feems this Woman was ^\nWitch of Tome Eminency, and had more than or-\ndinary Power in her way. For when Saul applies\nto her, fhe asks him, Whomflialll bring up? mti-\nmating that fhe was able to bring up who flic\nwould, either from Heaven or Hell,\nThis Boldnefs plainly infers, that flie had no\nPower at all, but this j that being a Witch, and one\nthat had a Familiar Spirit, flie could caufe her Familiar\nor Devil, call it what we will, to appear and perfonatc\nwho flie pleas'd to name. For why fliould not the\nBevil be as able to drefs himfelf up like one dead\nPerfon, as another ? and why not appear as well in\nthe Shape of a dead Man, as of a living One?\nS o that to me there is no more Difficulty in his\nDrefTing himfelf like Samuel^ than there was in calling\nhimfelf fo, or than fpcaking in the firfl: Perfon of\nSammU'3,% above 5 Why difquiet Me, and why bring\nMe up? AH that feems inexplicable in it is, how he\n(hould be able to tell Saul what fliould happen,\n(viz,) that God would deliver Ifrael into the\nHands of the PhilifiineSy and him (Saul) with them,\nand that to-morrow he fliould be with him 5 that is,\namong the Dead, fliould be killed in the Battel.\nThis mdecd has fomething difficult in it, becaufe\nthe Devil is not allowed to be a Prophet, or able to\npredifi what is to come. But thefe things may be\nall anfwer'd by the Story of Balaam^ where the\nwicked Creature, tho' a Wizard, and a Conjurer,\nyet was diredled, not only to blefs Ifrael in fpite\nof all the Gifts and Rewards that the King o^ Moab\nofFer'd him, but was enabled to prophefy of Chrill,\nand foretel the glorious appearing of the Meffiah >\nNumb, xxiv. 17. IJhallfee him hut not now, IJhall\nhohold him but not nigh j ^here Jhall come a Star out\nof Jacob, and a Scepter ^^\/\/ arife out of Ifrael j and\nagain, out of J A cob Jhall come he that Jhall have\nDominion, This was a plain and dircdt Prophecy\n\fof APPAR IT 10 NS. 49\nof Chrift, who is call'd in the Revelations the\nMorning-Star 5 and yet this Balaam was a Witch,\na Dealer with an Evil Spirit, and receiv'd the M^ages\nof Unrighteoufnefs.\nThe next Teitimony which we find in facred\nHiftory, of the Reality of Apparitions, as it refpefe\nthe Souls of depai'ted Perfons, is the Appearance of\nMofes and Ellas with Jefus Chrlji in the Mount, at\nhis Transfiguration 5 they not only were there, really\nand perfonally, in their Habits, and fo as to be known\nto the Difciples, but they appear'd talking with\nChrift y fo that it was a Perfe\u00ab5t and Compleat Ap-\nparition, {viz.) the particular Perfons appearing, and\nknown by the Perfons to whom they appear'd.\nMat. xvii. ?. And in another Place, the manner of\nthe Apparition is defcrib'd, as alfo what they talk'd\nof, Luke ix. 38. Who appeared in Glory^ and talk'd\nof his Deceafe^ which he jhould accompliJJo in Jeru-\nfalem.\nThis is fo plain and unqueflionable an Appear-\nance of departed Souls, that they who difpute it,\nmuft not only doubt of the Divinity of Scripture,\nbut mufl difpute its being an authentick Hiftory j\nwhich its Enemies will hardly deny.\nWE have yet another Teilimony, and this is as\npofitive and exprefs as the reft 5 Matth. xxvii. yi.\n^nd the Graves were opened^ and many of the Bodies\nof the Saints which flept arose, and came out of the\nGraves after his Refurredlion^ and went into the holy\nCity^ and appeared unto many-\nT H I s is a remarkable Place, and would admit of\na long Expofitionj but I muft not preach, and if I\nmight, I am no Annotaror; as far as it is to my\nprefent Purpofe, the Bodies arofe^ that was extraor-\ndinary j but that their Souls were alfo with their\nBodies, is not to be douted, at leaft by mej for I\nhave no Notion of the Body walking about without\n;he S0UI5 nor do we ever read of bodily Apparitions.\nt- E An\n\fjo 'J'he Hijlory and Reality\nA N Apparition is vulgarly call'd by u? a Ghoft,\nby our Northern People a Gheji-y now the Ghoft is\na Spirit, and the Apparition of a Spirit has fomc\nSenfe in it j the Spirits alfoafTuming a Shape or Body,\nwhether Real, or in Appearance only, has fomething\nin it to be talked about 5 but the Apparitions of\nBody, moving, appearing, walking, or whatever we\nmay call it, without Soul or Spirit, is what was ne-\nver heard of, and fcarce ever fuggefted.\nI T may be obferv'd, that thofe Apparitions quo-\nted from the Scripture, are not Apparitions in Vifi-\non 5 Dreams in the Night, or fuppofed Appearances\nonly, but plain, open, day-light Vifionsi the for-\nmer would not be to my purpofc at all. Thele\n'\nwere Apparitions that were fpoken to, and con-\nverfed with 5 and this is a Proof of what I al-\nledge, viz. that Spirits Unembodied may appear,\nmay reaflume humane Shape, their own former\nLikenefs, or any other, and may fhow themfelves\nto the World, or to as many Perfons as they pleafe.\nThe Difficulties which attend this are not a few,\ntho' none of them dcilroy the thing it felfj as (i.)\nWhether the Souls of good or bad People unembo-\ndied, are really in a State, or Condition for fuch an\nAppearance? and whether it confifts with the juft\nNotions we ought to have of the unalterable State?\n1 mean fuch Notions as conform to the Scripture,\nwhich, if the Parable of the rich Man and Lazarus\nbe a juft Reprefentation of it, fcems impoffible to\nbe, except on fuch an extraordinary Occafion as\nthat of our Saviour's Transfiguration and Refur-\nre6tion 5 that is, by Miracle.\nLJZARUS^hys the Text, was, upon his Death,\ncarried by the Angels into jibraham's Bofom> the\nrich Man died, and in Hell he lift up his Eyes.\nThat this is fuppos'd to be immediately, is evident,\nbecaufe the .rich Man fpeaks of his Brethren that\nwere then alive: If he was not carried thither im-\nmediately,\n\fof A?P ARITION S. yi\nmediately, he would certainly not have been carried\nthere at all 'till after the Great Audit \\ fo that it\nwas plain he was there prefently after his Death :\nand that Lazarus was carried immediately to Hea-\nven is evident alfo j becaufe the rich Man is brought\nin feeing him there, and deiiring he may be fcnt\nto him.\nTo fay this is but a Parable, is to fay what may\nbe granted without Prejudice to the Point, in hand.\nFor as it is a Parable, it would not have been ap-\npofite, if it had not reprefented things as they were\nreally to bej it would have been a Delufion, and\nbrought to deceive j whereas it is a Parable of our\nLord's own bringing, and all thofe Parables that\nChriit uttered, were the mofl: perfe6t Reprefentati-\nens and Illuftrations of the things which they were\nbroi^ght to fet forth j nor is any one of them lame\nin their Allufions, but inftruftive in every Article 5\nas the Parable of the Prodigal Son, for Example,\nand the Parable of the King making a Marriage for\nhis Son, and fo of the reft. And why muft this a-\nlone be lame, and unapt for the purpofe ?\nI F then this Parable is fuited to reprefcnt the State\nof the Souls of the Departed, thofe Souls then can no\nway be concern'd in the Apparitions which we are\nfpeaking of5 except as is before excepted, viz. on\nfuch extraordinary Occafions, as that of our Savi-\nour above muft be acknowledged to be.\nIf then, neither the Souls or Spirits pf the Blef-\nfed or the Curfcd, the Happy or Mifcrable, the\nSav'd or the Condcmn'd, are concern'd in thofe\nAppearances, who then are thefe Inhabitants of the\ninvifible World ? What are they that conftituce and\npoflefs this World of Spirics, fo much talk'd of ?\nAnd if the immenfe Spaces are taken up, if they\nare peopled by any fpirituous Creatures, if any\nthing but Stars and Planets range through the\nempty Place^ as Job calls it. Job xxvi. 7. what are\nE i they,\n\fyi The Hijlory and Reality\nthey, and what are the Spirits that inhabit thofc\nWorlds?\nThere muft certainly be a World of Spirits,\nor of Spirit, from %vhence we receive the frequent\nVifits in Publick, and the frequent Notices in Pri-\nvate, which are fo perceptible to us, and which we\nare fo uneafy about: if they are neither good Spirits\nor bad, if they have neither Power to do us Good\nor Hurt, as I fee a great deal of Reafon to believe,\nthen we have not fo much Reafon to be terrified\nabout them as we generally are : but of that here-\nafter.\nAs to the Locality of the Devil^ and his Ap-\npearance, that indeed is another Article, and he\nmay, as is [aid already^ cover himfelf with what\nShapes, human or brutal, he pleafes 5, but then\nthis would bring all Apparition to be by the Ap-\npearance of the Devil^ and all the Empire of the\nAir to be pofTelVd by him 5 which I cannot grant\n:\nParticularly, bccaufe, as I faid, fome of thcfc\nApparitions come of good Errands, to prevent Mif-\nchief, to proted Innocence and Virtue, and to dif-\ncover Injury, Injuftice and Oppreflionj all which\nare things very much out of the DeviVs way, re-\nmote from his Pra6i:ice, and much more remote\nfrom his Defign ; The Spirits I fpcak of muft be of a\nhigher Original \u2022, they muft be Heaven-born, of the\nglorious Original of angelick Species > and as all\nthings are known by their Confequences, fo they\nare known by their A61:ings> they do Heaven's\nWork, are under his immediate Government and\nDiredion, and are honour'd with his fpecial Com-\nmifHonj they are employed in his immediate Bufi-\nnefs, namely, the common Good of his Creature\nMan: They that do Good, demonftrate in the beft\nmanner that they are good.\nSo that every way we Ihould meet with fome\nDifficulty in this Cafe, unlefs folv'd, as I faid before,\nby\n\fof APPARITIONS. 53\nby the denominating another Clafs of Spirits nei-\nther immediately celeftial, or at all infernal > neither\nembodied, or that have been embodied, or that fliall\never be embodied.\nI T cannot beexpe\u00a3l:ed I fhould defcribe what thefe\nare, and in what Condition j iris fufficientthat I only\nfay Such may be there, and that they may be fuch\nas he thinks good to place there who made that\nempty Place ; I may as well ask the Enquirer\nwhat fort of Inhabitants they are who pof-\nfefs the Moon or any of the Planets, and whether\nthey dwell in a State of Innocence, or have con-\ntracted Guilt-, and if the latter, whether there is a\nglorious Eftablifhment of Redemption, and a Co-\nvenant of Life granted for them, as there is here,\nby the Purchace and Merit of a Saviour?\nI T is no fair Queflion to ask me a Demonftra-\ntion for an HypotheftSy or is it reafonable to tell me\nthey will not believe ir, becaufe I cannot prove the\nAffirmative of what I do not affirm.

nor\nwas this Speftre fo infincere as to conceal it felf\nall the while from him, but difcover'd to him that\nhe was but an Apparition, without Body, Subftance,\nor any thing but Shape.\nIf the Account 1 have of this Apparition be\ntrue, and I have had it by me many Years, he did\nhim Good, and not Hurt; he guided him thro' De-\nfarts and over Mountains, over frozen Likes, and\nlittle Seas cover'd with Snow; he diverted him\nwith Difcourfes of various Subje61:s, always ifluing\nfor his Good, and for the Encreafe of Knowledge\n:\nHe went with him over the Sea from Ireland ro rhe\nCoaft of Norway: He procur'd Winds for him,\nwithout buying them of Witches and Laplanders:\nHe did not raife Storms for him, becaufe being a\nTraveller and upon a Voyage, he had no Occafion\nof them;

In this Tempeft the Ship\nwas driven upon the Coaft of Rugen^ an Ifland on\nthe German fide of the Baltic^ where with much\nDifficulty they put into Straelfund^ a Sea-Port of\nPcmereUy and there the Traveller went on Shore.\nHere walking penfively and concern'd about\nthe event of his Fortune, and fearing the Ship\nwould really be loft, as his firft Man had foretold\nhim> I fay, walking very anxious upon the Key at\nStraelfund^ there meets him a Man who he was ut-\nterly a Stranger to, but who faluces him in Engliflj^\ncalls him by his Name, and asks him what^e did\nthere.\nS u R p R I z ' D with fuch a Salutation, and glad\nto fee any Man in fuch a flrange remote Country\nthat he was like to be acquainted with, and much\nmore that could call him by his Name, he returned\nhis Compliment, and anfwer'd that indeed he had\nnot much Bufinefs there, but that he came thither\nby a very unfortunate occafion.\nI K NO w you are, fays the Gentleman j you came\nin here laft Night m yon Ship j pointing to the\nVeflel which lay in the Road betwcn the City and\nthe Ifland of Rugen.\nI D I D fo, fays the fra-velkr^ and I am like to\nhave but ill Luck with her.

Will you not let me\nknow, SiV, who it is I am thus much oblig'd to ?\nFirst, returns he, let me fee and get you fome\nhelp, that you may go cheerfully about your Bufi-\nnefs, and we'll talk of that afterwards > fo he bad\nhim walk a little there, and he would come to him\nagain.\nH E had not walked long but he fees a Meflen-\nger coming to him, to tell him, that there was an\nEnglijh Gentleman defir'd to fpeak with him atfuch\na Houfe, and that he was to guide him to the\nplace.\nAccordingly he follows the Meflenger,\nwho brings him to a Publick Houfe where were\nThree Gentlemen fitting in a Room, and the Man\nhe had converfed with made a fourth, who calPd\nhim in, and bad him fit down,which he did.\n4 The\n\f^4 The Hljlory and Reality\nThe Three Gentlemen faluted him very kindly^\nand one of them alfo in Englijh^ and told him they\nhad received an Account of his Circumftances from\nthat Gentleman, and that theyfent for him to com-\nfort and affift him.\nThis was a kind and agreeable Surprize to him,\nand he could not but receive it with all Civility\nand Acknowledgment poflible. After which they\nask'd him to Sup with them,which he accepted of,\nand at Supper hearmg the whole of the Cafe, they\nfent for a Merchant of that City to come to\nihem.\nWhen the Merchant was come they recom-\nmended the Stranger's Affair to him 5 and he, the\nMerchant, was foafliftant to the Stranger that he\nbought all his Cargo of FiHi, or procured others to\nbuy it, giving him a Price to his Satisfaction, and\ngave him as much Money there as he requir'd, and\ngood Bills payable at Dantzick for the reft.\nI N the mean time, (for this was tranfacling fe-\nveral Days) the Three Gentlemen continued ex-\nceeding courteous and obliging to him 5 and after\nmany other Civilities, they being travelling into\nPoland-, invited the Traveller to go with them as\nfar as Dantzick^ which they knew he was bound\nfor, and that they would fublill him at their own\nCharge fo far. The Traveller confidering his own\nCondition, and that the Ship he came in was not in\nCondition to purfue the Voyage, rcfolv'd to ac-\ncept of the Offer, and accordingly prepared to go\n\"with them : But he was extremely concerned that\nhe could not fee the kind Stranger who had firft\nfaluted him as above, and who brought him to the\nGentlemen that were now fo extraordinary civil\nto him > he enquired after him of the McfTenger\nthat fetched him to that Houfe, but he knew him\nnot 5 he ask'd the People of the Houfe, but they\ncould give no Account of himj he ask'd the three\nGen-\n\f6f APPARITIONS, 6s\nGentlemen about him, but they knew nothing\nof him 5 the Englijh Gentleman among them faid,\nhe thought he belonged to that Gentleman, point-\ning to another of the three who was a Germany the\nGerman anfwer'd that he underftood he was the third\nGentleman's Friend, who\" was a Swede^ that is a\nPomeranian^ for Pomeren is under the Dominion of\nthe Swedes. But the Swede faid he thought he was\nthe Englijh Gentleman's Brother, for he fpoke\nEnglijh very welU in a word, no body knew him,\nand he faw him no more.\nI N a Week more or thereabout the four Gen-\ntlemen (for now they were fo many) fet out toge-\nther,with every one a Servant 5 except our Traveller^\nwho had none. Every one that knows the Coun-\ntry from Stetin to Dantzick and Poland^ knows that\nit is a defart and wild Country very thin of Inha-\nbitants, and confequently not full of Towns 5\n\"with feveral Woods and Wafts in their Way, very\ndifficult to Travel, and this oblig'd them feveral\ntimes to take Guides by the Way^ fo that they\nmade up with their Guides always Eight, fome-\ntimes Ten in Company, very wellarm'd, and tolera-\nbly well mounted.\nThe third Day after they were paft the Oder^\nand began to come out of that Part o\u00a3 Pomeren\nwhich lies Eaft of Stetin^ and is call'd the.

They obferved that Riding over a large\nPlain, where there were fome few fcattering Houfes\nwhich lay on the other fide ofthe Road South, (for\nhe kept all along (before) on the North fide of\nthem) I fay, pafling over this Plain, the Traveller\nkeeping a little behind them crofs'd the Road,\nand going up to one of the faid fcatter'd Houfes,\nknock'd at the Door and went in.\nUpon this they refolv'd if pofiible to get fome\nknowledge of him j fo they rode all up to another\nof thofe Houfes : Here calling to the Inhabitants,\ntho' it was no Inn or Houfe of Entertainment,\nbut a Poor Husbandman's Cottage, they got\nLeave to refrefh thcmfclves, having Provifions and\n,Wine of their own, and giving the good Wife a\nfmall\n\fof APPARITIO NS. 67\nftnall Bottle of about half a Pint of Brandy at part-\ning, the People were abundantly latisfied.\nHere talking of the Traveller, and at what\nHoufe he call'd in the Village, (for tho' the Houfes\nflood fcragling over the wade, yet as ihcre were near\ntwenty of them jh all it was call'd a Town) here^\nI fay, talking of the Traveller and of his knocking\nat the Door of one o\\ the Houies, the Woman of\nthe Houfe underftanding their Language,haftily ask'd.\nWhat, fays fhe, have you feen the Owke Mouraski ?\n> Who fhe meant, they did not know; but defcribing\nthe Perfon to her,and fhe alfo to them, they began to\ncome to an Under(landing'.

Here the Woman enquired more exa5lly\nabout the Houfe where the \"Traveller called^ and\nthe Gentleman going to the Door pointed it out\nto her^ at which fie left off crying^ and then\nrejoyc'd as much as jhe had lamented before 5 for\nit feems floe had mifiaken it for another Houfe\nwhich flood near it^ and where her own Father\nand Mother lived.\nThen he asked her what Countryman the Tra^\nveller was.\nShe faid, they did not know that, for no Body\never fpoke to him, they were afraid.\nWhy, fays he^ when he knocks at the Door\ndon't ye fpeak to him ?\nNo, fays fle^ nor does he fpeak a word> but jufl\nas he goes away he will fometimes fay re-\npeating a word which I do not remember, but\nfignifies be comforted -y and then they are fure the\nPeifon fhall be fick only, but (hall not die.\nBut, fays he^ do they entertain him, or give him\nany thing?\nY BS^ fays flje^ they fet Bread before him, and\nhe takes a fmall Piece in his Hand 5 but no Body\ncan fay they ever faw him Ear.\nBut what do you take him to be then ? fays he.\nA\n\fof APPARITIONS. 6c,\nA GOOD Angel, fays the Woman j adding ano-\nther hard Word of their own, fi^nifying that he\ndid no Hurt to any body j and, fays fhe, to feme\nFamilies he is a MefTenger of Good. All this gave\nthem Amufement, but no particular Satisfa6bion, and\nrather prompted their Curiofity to make farther En-\nquiry about him. After about an Hour's refre{liing\nthemfelves at this poor Cottage, they proceeded on\ntheir Journey, and having rode about two Miles,\nthey faw- their old Objedt again on the left or north\nfide of their Road, as before, and he kept in their\nfight in the fame manner all the reft of the Day.\nThere was a Town, I think 'tis call'd Kint-\nzigen, or fome fuch like Name, at a few Miles di-\nftance, and where their Guide told them they fhould\nlodge, and before they came to the Town there was\na River, not a great or very wide River, but too\nlarge to ride thro' ir, and at the Town there is a ve-\nry good flone Bridge j built, as they were told, by\nthe Anceftors of the Kings oiPrujJia^ that is, as I\nfuppofe, the old Dukes of Pomerania.\nAccordingly they pafs'd this Bridge, and\nthen went into the Town. It was moft natural to\nthem to obfervc what Courfe the Traveller would\ntake to pafs the River, who as he went on muft nc-\nceflarily come to the Bank, \u2022\nat near a Mile diftance\nfrom the Town, fo they halted a little, one of them\nalighting from his Horfe, as if fomerhing had re-\nquired their ftay, that the Traveller might go on\nbefore them, which he did.\nObserving him as narrowly as poiHble, they\nfollow'd him (with their Eyes) down to the very\nEdge of the River, nor did he flop or take notice\nof them, tho' they faw him ptainly to the very Bank }\nbut here not being able to keep him exadly \\n their\nlight every Moment, they immediately faw him\ngoing up the rifing Grounds, on the other fide,\nF J without\n\f70 The H'tjiory and Reality\nwithout being capable of giving the leaft account\nhow he pafs'd the Water.\nThis was the other Paflage, which, I fay, amu-\nfcd them very much.\nAs foon as they came into the Town where they\nwere to lodge, their Guide looking beyond the\nHoufe where they ftop'd, called to them, Look\nyonder, fays he, is your Traveller fitting at the\nDoor of fuch an Inn or Houfe, pointing to the\nPlaces and there they faw him plain at rhc Door ea-\nting a piece of Bread, and having a Pot or Jug of\nPolijh Beer {landing by him. One of the Gentlemen\n(refolving, if poflible, to fpeak with him) walk'd up in\nhis Boots to the Place, feeing him fitting all the while\nhe was going, 'till coming very near, and happen-\ning to turn his Eyes but one Moment from him,\nwhen he look'd again, the Man was gone.\nH E ask'd the People of the Houfe about him,\nbut they knew nothing of him, only that as they\nfaid there was fuch a Man, but he was gone, and\nthey neither knew who he was, or whither he was\ngone.\nThen he ask'd them if they did not know the\nOwke Mouraski j they faid Yes, they had heard of\nbut they did not know him.\nWhy, fays the Gentleman-i don't you know that\nthis was he that fat upon the Bench ?\nNo, they faid^ that could not be he, that was a\npoor Countryman, a Traveller.\nThe Gentleman afiured them that was he j at\nwhich they fecmed very much concerned, but feemed\nvery willing not to believe him.\nW h y, fays he^ are you afraid of him ?\nNo, fays they^ but we don't like his coming to\nus, for, they fay, he brings no good to the Family\nwhere he comes.\nBut this Difconrfe ended, and the Gentleman\ngain'd no Information there.\n7 The\n\fof APPARITIONS. 71\nThe next Day they had his Company again, as\nbefore j and palding by a fingle Houfc upon the Road,\nnear a Village, but {landing quite out of the Road,\nthey obferv'd the Traveller to (top at that Houfe,\nand go in.\nBy this time their Curiofity was very much\nheightened, and they began to be fomething uneafy\nabout him 5 it was not very pleafant, they thought, to\nhave the Devil fo near them, and they could think\nhim to be nothing iefsj {o they all turn'd back, and\nrefolv'd to go to the Houfe, and if he was there to\nfpeak with him, if pofIible> and if nor, to inform\nthcmfelves as much as they could about him.\nWhen they came within about a quarter of a\nMile of the Houfe, they faw the Traveller on the\nother fide, having gone out at the back Door, and\ntravelling forward as unconcern'd, and taking no\nnotice of them, juft as before.\nThis furprized themj however they went up to\nthe Houfe, and enquired about him, as they did\nbefore: but here they received a quite differing Ac-\ncount of him j here the People blefs'd him, called\nhim by the fame Name, but took him for their\ngood Angel, (as they call'd him,) that he always\nbrought them good Tidings, that they were fure ic\nwould fare well with them afcer he had been with\nthem; and a great deal more.\nBut to bring this Story to a conclufion, fo far\nas it ferves the prefent Occafion : This Spedre, or\nApparition, for fo I mufl call it, attended theirt\n'till they came within two Leagues of Dantzick^\nwhere the Gentlemen feparated, after a Day or two\nflaying in the City 5 the three Gentlemen going\nfrom thence to MariemburgJj in Polijh PruJJia^ and\nour Traveller was left in Dantzick.\nWhile he was here a Man made acquaintance\nwith him who was bound to Koningsberg^ and our\nTraveller beinj refolv'd to go for Petersburg-^ was\nF 4 glad\n\f72 The Hijlory and Reality\nglad to have this-new Acquaintance, which he had,\nas we may fay, pick'd up, to go v\/ith him 5 To they\nembark'd together in a fmall Hoy, upon the Sea or\nJ^ake call'd the Ffifihaff^ which carry'd them to Ko-\nningsberg. He gives a ilrange tho' diverting Account\nof his Converfation with this Man, who told him\nfo many Stories of feveral kinds, that it amaz'd him >\nand he look'd as if he knew all the World, and all\nthe People in it, and all things that had happened\nin it, or would happen in it for ever to come, and\nfomething longer.\nHowever, as the Frifchaf \\s not above three\nor four Days fail, and they were quickly at Ko-\nTiingsberg^ the Converfation was foon over, and this\nnew Acquaintance ended 5 but the Traveller conti-\nnuing his Journey, enquired in the City if there\nwere any Paffcngcrs or Gentleman travelling to-\nwards Riga^ either by Land or by Sea 5 and being\ndire61:ed to a Houfe where Strangers ufed to refort,\nhe found there feveral People bound for Riga^ fome\nMerchants, lome Country-People, fome Seafaring-\nPeople, but msoft enclin'd to go by Sea, there be-\ning VcfTels always ready at the Pillau^ which is a\nTown at the Mouth of the Haff^ ready to Sail for\nRiga^i if Goods or PafTengers prefented.\nBut among them all there was an ancient Man,\nhabited like a Rufs^ or rather like a Greek Prieft,\nwith a long venerable Beard, a purple Robe or long\nGarment, fuch as the Ruffians wear, a high ftiff-\ncrown'd Furr-cap, and a clofe Veil about his Body,\ngirded with a Silk Saihj and he declared himfelf\nfor Riga-y but that being an old Man, he would not\ngo by Sea, but that he had two Horfes in the City\nbefidcs his own, having brought two Servants with\nhim from Grodno m Lithuania^ but one of them had\nleft him j fo he ofFer'd the Traveller to lend him\npnc of his Horfes for his Company, if he would\ntravel\n\fof AP PARITIO NS. 73\ntravel with him to Mittau in Courland^ and thence\nto Riga.\nI T will take up too much Room here, to give a\nfull Account of the Travels of this wandring\nPerfon, and how in almoft every Place he found\na new Shape ready to thruft into his Company, and\nthat for four Years intimate Ramble 5 but that at\nlaft, being in I'tirkey^ his lateft Companion difco-\nver'd to him that he was an Inhabitant of aninvifi-\nble Region, that he had been in his Company in\nall his Journey in all the differing Figures that he\nhad met with, and that in a Word he was the fame\nPerfon that embark'd with him in Ireland^ landed\nwith him in Norway^ left him at Gottenburg^ found\nhim at Straelfund^^ dogged him upon the way to\nDantzick^ failed with him 10 Koningsberg^ lent him a\nHorfe to go to Riga^ and fo on 5 and that he had\nonly put on fo many Shapes and Appearances, that\nhe might not be uneafy with him, and tired of his\nCompany.\nHow they went on together after that, and the\nConverfation that pafs'd between them after the\nDifcoveryj how familiar Friends they were for fome\nMonths after, and what Reafons he gave why he\nwould never believe that it was a Devil, but a good\nand kind Spirit fent to take Care of him, and aflid\nhim in his Travels; all that, as foreign to my pre-\nfent Purpofe, I omit. Perhaps the Story may fee\nthe World by itfelf, and well worth reading it will\nbe, if it docs. But of that by the by.\nAs I do not here enter into the Authority of the\nStory, (tho', as I faid, I have feen it in Manufcript\nmany Years ago) fo I have no more to fay from it\nthan this, that if fuch good Spirits are converfant\nwith Mankind, and refident in the invifible Spaces,\nwe know not vv here > ifwe have reafon to believe they\nare not Angels, and yet really by their Adions can-\nnot be Devils 5 then it follows that there are a\ncertain\n\f74 'T'he Hifiory and Reality\ncertain middle Species of Spirits in Being j let them\nbe what they will, let them be employ'd, directed,\nlimited and reflrain'd, how and in what manner he\npkafes who is their Maker, and who ought to be\ntheir Guide and Diredorj that's not the matter, nor\ncan it be enquired into here 5 the Queftion before\nus is only whether fuch there are, or no ?\nNow if it be granted that there are fuch, and\nthat brings it down to the prefent Cafe, if there\nare fuch, then all Apparitions are not Devils j no,\nnor are they walking difturbed Souls of Men lately\nembodied and departed : a Notion empty and not\nto be defended 5 incongruous, and inconfiftent either\n-with Scripture, the Chriftian Religion, or Reafon,\nand founded only in the bewildred Imaginations and\nDreams of ignorant People, who neither know how\nor by what Rules to judge of fuch Things, or are\ncapable of right Conceptions about them j who do\nnot give thcmfelves time to exercife that little Power\nof thinking that they are Mafters of, and fo are\nleft to the Darknefs of their own Fancies, thinking\nevery thing they fee is a Devil, meerly becaufe they\nknow not what elfe to make of it, what other Name\nto give it, or that it can be podible any thing but:\nDevils or Angels can come of fuch Errands.\nB y this Miftake they give the Devil the Ho-'\nnour of many an A&ion, which he is too much a,i\nDevil to have any hand inj alcribe Works of Cha-\nrity and Benevolence to him 5 make him move inju-\nrious and knavifli Men to do Juftice, Thieves to*\nmake Reftitution, cruel and inhuman Wretches toi\nbe merciful, Cheats to turn honeit, Robbers to de-\nli ft, and Sinners to r^penr.\nStory tells us, that Hind that famous out-law'd\nRobber, the moll famous fince Robin Hood^ met\na Spectre upon the Road, in a Place called Stangate^\nHok^ in Huntingtonjhin^ where he ufed to commit\nhifS\n\fof AP PARITIO NS. 75\nhis Robberies; and famous for many a Highway\nRobbeiy fince that.\nThe Spedre appeared in the Habit of a plain\nCountry Grazier > and as the Devil, you may fup-\npofc, knew very well the Haunts and Retreats than\nthis Hind ufed to frequent; he comes into the Inn,\nand taking up his Quarters, puts up his Horfc, and\nmakes the Hoftler carry up his Portmanteau, which\nwas very heavy, into his Chamber; when he was in\nthe Chamber he opens his Pack, takes out his\nMoney, which fecmed to be in feveral fmall Parcels,\nand puts it together into no more than two Bags,\nthat it might make an equal weight to each fide of\nhis Horfe, and make as much fhow of it as poffible.\nHouses that entertain Rogues are feldom with-\nout Spies to give them due Intelligence; Hind gets\nNotice of the Money, fees the Man, fees the Horfe,\nthat he may know him again; finds out which\nWay the Countryman travels, meets him at Stan^\ngate-Hole^ jaft in the bottom between the two Hills,\nand ftops him, telling him he muft deliver his\nMoney.\nWhen he nam'd the Money the Grazier feigns\nhimfelf furprized, puts on the Pannick, trembles,\nand is frighted, and with a pitiful Tone fays, \/ am\n(as you fee) hut a poor Man 'y indeed^ Sir^ I have no\nMoney ; [there the Devil fhew'd that he could fpeak\nTruth when it ferv'd his Occafion.] O you old Dog^\nfays he, have you no Money .^ Come, open your\nCloak-bag, and give me the two Bags, one on one\nfide your Saddle, and one on t' other : what, have\nyou no Money, and yet your Bags were too heavy to lie\nall on one fide? Come, come, deliver, or I'll cut you\nto Pieces this Moment. (There he was out too, and\nthreatened more than he cou'd do.) Well, the poor\nDevil whines and cries, and tells him he muil be\nmifVaken, he took him for another Man fure, for\nindeed he had no Money.\nCome,\n\f\u2022J\n6 The Hiftory and Reality\nCome, come, fays ^\/W, come along with me;\nand fo he takes his Horfe by the Bridle and leads\nhim out of the Road into the Woods, which are\nvery thick there on both fides, and the bufinefs\nwas too long to ftand in the open Road all the while\nto do it.\nWh e n he had gotten into the Woods, Come, Mr.\nGrazier, fays he, difmount, and give me the two\nBags this Minute. In fhort he difmounts the poor\nMan, cuts his Bridle and his Girts, and opens his\nCloak-bag, where he finds the two Bags. Fery welly\nfays Hindy here they are, and heavy as before > fo\nbe throws them on the Ground, cuts them open, in\none he finds a Halter^ and in the other a piece of\nfolid Brafs in the exa6t fhape of a Gibbet, and the\nCountryman behind him call'd to him, there's your\nFate^ Hind, take care.\nI F he was furprized at what he had found in the\nBags, (for there was not a Farthing of Money but\nin the Bag where the Halter was, of which pre-\nfently,) 1 fay, if he was furprized at what he found\nin the Bags, he was more fo at hearing the Coun-\ntryman call him by his Name, and turn'd about to\nkill him, becaufe he thought he was known } but\nhe had no Life nor Soul left in him, when turning\nabout, as I fay, to kill the Fellow, he faw nothing\nbut the poor Horfe. He funk down to the Earth,\nand lay there a confiderable time 5 how long, that\n(being alone) he could not tell, but it muft be fome\nMinutes. At laft coming to himfelf he goes away\nterrified to the lad degree, and aihamed, wondring\nwhat it fhould be.\nI HINTED that there was no Money but one\nPiece found, which the Story fays was Scots^ a Piece\ncaird in Scotland a Fourteen^ in Englijh^ a Thirteen\nPence Half-Penny^ to pay the Hangman with > from\nwhence it may be fuppos'd that Saying is ufcd to this\nDay,\n\fof APPARITIONS. 7j\nDay, that thirteen Pence Half-Penny Is Hangman's\nWages.\nNow tho' the Story has fomc Mirth in it, and\nmay with the many Stories of that Robber be\nlaid by as Romances, yet it is thus far to my\nPurpofe 5 That this was a Spirit , that mud' be ac-\nknowlcHg'd, A good Angel from Heaven wou'd\nhardly have been fent to give him fuch an inefFe6tu-\nal infignificant Hint, which had no fufficicnt Effe6b,\nwhatever it might have juft then to furprize him,\nfor he rob'd continually after that, and was hang'd\nat laft for it.\nThe Devil^ as before, cannot rationally be fufpe-\nfted in the Cafe 5 for why fhould the Devil both ^bauk\nhim, threaten and caution him? threaten him with\nhanging him, fright him with the Gibbet and Hal-\ntar, and caution him to take care. This was not\nfor the Devil's Purpofe, it was more for his Inte-\nreil to have him go on, though he came to the\nGallows at laft.\nIf then it was neither ^00^ Angel or Bad^ what\nmuft it be, and how mult we judge of it ? what\nNamemuftwe give him, and who was this Country\nGrazier ?\nTo come off of this, fome will have it be, that\nit is the Devil'undcx Conflrainr, the Devil in Com-\nmiffion, that he is fent on fuch Errands by a fupe-\nrior Power that has him at Command j and that\nwhen he is direded to do fo and fo^ he muft obey,\nhe dare do no otherwife. This is begging the Que-\nftion in the grolTelt manner imaginable. Befides,\nwhy the Devil fent of fuch Errands ?\nlA T is not probable^ it is not to be gather'd from^\nthe ordinary Courfe of Providence. The Devil in-\ndeed was permitted, or, if you will have it, he\nwas commiflion'd to ftrip and affli6t Poor Job-y and\nhe was again permitted to enter into the Herd of\nSwine 5 but this does not amount to a Paralel: la\nboth\n\f78 The Hijiory and Reality\nboth thofe Examples he was only employ'd as an\nInftrument, and^ as we may exprefs it, in his ordi-\nnary Bufinefs, in the way of his Calling, that is to\nfay in doing Mifchicf : But here he is fuppos'd em-\nploy'd in doing Good, cautioning a hardened\nRogue to leave off his wicked Courfe, and efcape\nthe Gallows. Now this is quite out of Satan's\nroad of Buiinefs > 'tis alfo out of the ordinary courfe\nof Heaven's Condudi:, for when do we find God\nemploying the De'vil in any good Work ? I do not\nremember one clear Example of it, in all the facred\nHiftory.\n2. I T would argue that Heaven fliould want In-\nUruments, which is not at all juft to infer j will\nthey pretend, that, for want of more proper Agents^\nGod {hould employ the Devil to fave a High-way\nMan from the Gallows? and, which is more than all\nthe reft, fhould not bring it to pafs neither? But if\nyou will allow that this was one of the Imaginary\nfpccies of Spirits, who, willing to fave a poor\nWretch that was running head long to the Devil^\ntook all thefeMeafures to alarm him, and bring him\nto juft Refle6lions, but was not able to reclaim\nhim, was not admitted to give him Notice, when\nhe was about the fatal Ad he was furpriz'd in, or\nto warn him when the Officers came to apprehend\nhim, this feems rational.\nI F the Devil ftiould be fuppos'd to be employ'd\nin fuch a Work as this was, and fo contrary to his\nInclination, either he would perform it like him-\nfelf, treacherous and unfaithful, or at beft, reludant\nand unwilling. Perhaps you will fay he durft not\nperform it treacheroufly and unfaithfully j and it\nmay be not : But why muft it be fuppos'd Heaven\nIhould employ his worft and wickedeft Creature,\nwhom he had long fince disbanded, and caft out\nof his Service, rejeding him as unworthy to be em-\nploy'd j and who, if he was employ'd, and durft\nnot\n\fof APPARITIONS. 7p\nnot decline the Work, yet, it muft be acknow-\nledged, would obey with the utmoft Averfion and\nUnwillingnefsj when at the fame time Millions of\nfaithful Agents, willing and chearfully-obedienc\nServants, are ready at command, to execute his\nWill with the utmoft Vigour and Fidelity?\nBut to leave arguing upon Infcrutables, let us\ncome to Narration of Fa(5i:s.\n1 HAVE another Account received from a parti-\ncular Acquaintance in a neighbouring Nation. I\ncould name Perfons and Places in a more exa(5fc\nmanner to thefe Accounts > but fome Reafons of\nState forbid us at this time to enter into the Cir-\ncumilances or Families. For where Matters of Ap-\nparition and Witchcraft are the Subitance of the\nHiftory, it has never been found reafonable to name\nHoufcs and Families j and as this Apology will be\nallow'd to be juft, I expe6fc it will be accepted by\nthe Reader in all the Examples I fhall give of this\nkind.\nA CERTAIN Perfon of Quality, being with\nhis Family at his Country-Seat for the Summer-\nSeafon, according to his ordinary Cuftom, was\noblig'd upon a particular Occafion of Health to leave\nhis faid Seat, and go to yJis La Chapplle^ to ufe\nthe Baths there : This was it fcems in the Month\no^ JugMft^ being two Months fooner than the ufual\ntime ot his returning to Court for the V'inter.\nUpon thus removing fooner than ordinary, he\ndid not then disfurnifh the Houfe, as was the ordinary\nUlage of the Family, or carry away his Plate and\nother valuable Goods, but left his Steward and\nthree Servants to look after the Houle. and the\nPadre or Parijh Prieft was defired to keep his Eye\nupon them too, and to fuccour them from the\nVillage adjoining, if there was Occafion.\nThe Steward \"had no publick Notice of any\nHafm approaching J but for three or four Days fuc-\nceffively\n\f8q The Hijlory and Reality\nceffively he had fecrec flrange Impulfes of Dread\nand Terror upon his Mind that the Houfe was be-\nfet, and was to be aflaulted by a Troop of Banditti,\nor as we call them here, Houfe-breakers^ who would\nmurther them all, and after they had robb'd the\nHoufe, would fet it on Fire \\ and this followed him fo\nfall, and made fuch Impredion upon his Mind, that\nhe could think of nothing elfe.\nUpon this the third Day he went to the Padre^\nor Parijh Prieft^ and made his Complaint > upon\nwhich the Pried and the Steward had the follow-\ning Difcourfe, the Steward beginning thus :\nFA'tHER'i [aid hey you know what a Charge I\nhave in my Cuftody, and how my Lord has intru-\niled me >vith the whole Houfe, and all the rich\nFurniture is {landings I am in great Perplexity a-\n'\nbout it, and come to you for your Advice.\nPa. Why, what's the Matter? you have not\nheard of any Mifchief threatned, have you ?\nSt. No, I have heard of nothings but I have\nfuch Apprehenfions, and ithasmade fuch Impreffion\nupon me for thefe three Days, that=^\n* Here he told him the particulars of the Unea-\nJinefs he had been in^ and added^ bejides what is [aid\nabovey that one of the Servants had the fame^ and\nhad toldhim ofity thd* he had communicated nothing\nto that Servant in the leajl.\nPa. It may be, you dream'd of thefe things?\nSt. No indeed, Padre^ 1 am fure I could not\ndream of them, for I could never fleep.\nPa, What can I do for you? What would\nyou have me do ?\nSt. I WOULD have you firfl of all tell me what\nyou think of thefe things, and whether there is a-\nny Notice to be taken of them^\n*'\nHere the Padre examined him more Jiri5ily a*\nbout the ParticularSy andfent for the Servant and\nexamined him apart y and being a very judicious\nhonefi Man^ he anfwefd him tJpus: Pa,\n\f0\/ APPARITIONS. 8i\nPa. Look you, Mr. Steward^ I do not lay a very\ngreat Strefs upon fuch things, but yet I don*t think\nthey are to be wholly flighted ; and therefore I\nwould have you be upon your Guard^ and if yoii\nhave the leaft Alarm let me know.\nSt, That is poor Satisfadion to me to be up-\non my Guard, if I am over-power'd.

Why, compofe your Mind, and keep up\nyour Heart, and don't let my Lord fpend two or thred\nhundred Livres here, to cure yoii of the Vapours.\nSt. Why, you faid your felf, Padre^ that it was\nnot to be wholly flighted ?\nPa. T H A T 's true 5 but I faid alfo, I would not\nlay too great a Strefs upon it.\nSt, What inuft I do then ?\nPa, Do! Why, difmifs the JVfen again, and take\nIvhat Care you canj and if you have any Notice of\nMifchief that may be depended upon^ kt me hav6\nNotice too, and I'll affift you.\nQ SU\n\f8 1 The Hijlory and Reality\nSt. Well then, the good Angel muft protedt\nmy Lord's Houfe, I fee, for no body elfe will.\nAmen^ fays the Padre^ I truft the good Spirits\nwill keep you all: So he blefs'd the Steward, (in\nhis way) and the Steward went away grumbling\nvery much that he took away his Garrifon, and left\nhim to the good Spirits.\nIt feems, for all this, that the Steward's Notices,\nhowever fecret, and from he knew not who, were:\nnot of fo light an Import as the Padre thought:\nthey were 3 for as he had this Impulfe upon hi\u00ab>\nMind that fuch Mifchief was brewing, fo it really\nwas, as you will fee prefently.\nA SET of Robbers, who had Intelligence that\nthe Nobleman with his Family was gone to Ah\nLa Chapelle^ but that the Houfe was left furnifh'dj,\nand all the Plate, and the things of Value were left\nin it, had form'd a Defign to plunder the Houfe..\nand afterwards to burn i:, iuft as the Steward hac\nfaid.\nThey were two and twenty ftrong in the whole,\nand thoroughly arm'd for Mifchief Yet while the\nadditional Force, which the Padre had plac'd t(\nreinforce the Steward, were in the Houfe, o^\nwhom, including the other four, three fat up every\nNight, they did not dare to attempt it.\nBut as foon as they heard that the Guard wai\ndifmifs'd, they form'd their Defign anew, and, t\u00ab\nmake the Story ihort, they attack'd the Houfe ai\nbout Midnight. Having, I fuppofe, proper Ini\nilruments about them, they foon broke open a Win\ndow, and twelve of them got into the Houfe\nthe reft ftanding Centinel at fuch Places as the*\nthought proper, to prevent any Succours from thi\n\u2022town.\nThe poor Steward and his three Men were\ngreat Diftrefsi they were indeed above Stairs, am\nhad barricadocd the Stair-Cafes as well as thi\ncoulc\n\fof APPARITIONS. 85\ncould, hearing the Fellows were breaking inj but\nwhen they found they were got in, they expected\nnothing but to be kept above Stairs 'till the Houfc\nwas pluiidcr'd, and then to be burnt alive.\nBut it feems the good Spirits the Pricft fpokc\nof, or fome body elfe, made better Provifion for\nthem, as you will fee prefently.\nWhen the firft ot the Fellows were gotten in-\nto the Houfe, and had open'd the Door, and let in\nas many of their Gang as they thought fit, which\n(as above) was twelve in Number they fhut the Door\nagain, and fliut themfelvcs in % leaving two without\nthe Door, who had a Watch-word, to go and call\nmore Help if they wanted it.\nThe twelve ranging over the 'great Hall, found\nlittle there to gratify their greedy Hopes j but brea-\nking next into a fine wcll-furnifh'd Parlour, where\n:he Family ufually fat, Behold, in a great eafy\nChair, fat a grave ancient Man, with a long full-\nDottom'd black Wig, a rich brocaded Gown, and\nI Lawyer's lac'd Band, but looking as if in great\nSurprize, feem'd to make Signs to them for Mercy,\n3Ut faid not a Word, nor they much to him, ex-\ncept that one of them flatting, cry'd, H a !

I\nThpy were not much concern'd at firft, but\nthought he had come in by another Door, and be-\ngan to fwear at him, for putting them to the Trou-\nble of breaking open the Door, when there was an-\nother way into the Room.

Upon which the firft fwore at him\nthat if he did not immediately fhow them where i\nwas, he was a dead Dog that Moment.\nUpon this furious Ufage, he points to the Door\nwhich opened into the Salon^ which being a thii\nPair of Folding- Doors open'd prefently, and ii\nthey run into the great Salon\\ when looking at ih\nfarther end of the Room, there fat the ancien\nMan again, in the fame Drefs and Pofture as be\nfore.\nUpon this Sight, thofe that were foremoi\namong them cry*d out aloud. Why, this old Fel\nlow deals with the Devil fure, he^s here afore u\nagain.\njBtTT the Cafe difFer'd a little now 5 for whe\nthey came out of the firft Parlour, being eager fo\nthe Plate and Money, and willing to find it a l l\nthe whole Body of them run out into the fecon\nParlour J but now the ancient Man pointing to th\nthird Room, they did not all immediately rufh ou\ninto the Salon^ but four of them were left behin\nin the Parlour or Gijwning-Room mention'd ju\nlaowj not by order or defign, but accidentally.\nB\n\fof APPARITIONS. 8y\nBy this Means they fell into the following Con-\nfufionj for while fome of them call'd out from the\nSalon^ that the old Rogue was there before them again '^\nothers anfwer'd out of the Parlour, How the Devil\ncan that be ? why, he is here ftill in his Chair, and\nall his Rubbifli : with that, two of them run back\ninto the firfl Parlour, and there they faw him agi ti\nfitting as before. NotwithftaiKling all this, far from\nguefling what the Occafion fhould be, they fancied\nthey were gamed, or fuggefted that they were but\njelled with, and that there were three fevcral old\nMen all drefs'd up in the fame Habits for the very\nfame Occafion, and to mock them, as if to let them\nknow that the Men above in the Houfc were not\nafraid of them.\nWv^i^iu^ fays one of the Gang^ I'll difpatch one\nof the old Rogues, I'll teach one of them how to\nmake Game at us: upon which, raifing his Fuzee\nas high as his Arm would let him, he flruck at\nthe antient Man, as he thought it was, with all his\nForcej but behold! there was nothing in the Chair,\nand his Fuzee flew into a thoufand Pieces, wound-\ning his Hand moil grievoufly, and a Piece of the\nBarrel ftriking him on the Head, broke his Face,\n^nd knock'd him down backward.\nAt the fame time, one of thofe in the Salon run-\nning at the antient Man that fat there, fwore he\nwould tear his fine brocaded Gown off, and then\nhe would cut his Throat: but when he went to\ntake hold of him, there was nothing in the Chair.\nThis happening in both Rooms, they were all\nin moft horrible Confufion, and cry'd out in both\nRooms at the fame Moment, in a terrible manner.\nAs they were in the utmoft Amazement at the\nthing, fo after the firft Clamour they flood looking\nijpon one another for fome time, without fpeaking\na Word morej but at length one faid.

And it was my Opinion, when\nI firft read the Story, the Rogues were fo\nfrighted, that their Imagination afterwards form'd\na thing m their Thoughts more terrible than the\nf)evll himfelf could appear in.\n5 But\n\fof AP PARITIO NS.\nBut be that as it will, his Figure was fuch,\nthat when they came up to him, not a Man of\nthem had Courage to look in his Face, much lefs\ntalk to him j and he that was fo bold, and thus\ncame arm'd with half a Regiment of Saints in his\nMouth, fell down flat on the Ground, having\nfainted away (as they call it) with the Fright.\nThe Steward and his three Men were all this\nwhile above flairs, in the utmoft Concern at\nthe Danger they were in, and expelling every\nMoment the Rogues would drive to force their\nWay up, and cut their Throats > They heard the\nconfus'd Noife that the Fellows made below, but\ncou'd not imagine what it was, and much lefs the\nMeaning of it : but while it lafted it came into\nthe Mind of one of the Servants, that as it was\ncertain the Fellows were all in the Parlour, and\nvery bufy there, whatever it was about, he might\ngo up to the Top of the Houfe and throw one of\ntheir Hand-Granadoes down the Chimney, and per-\nhaps it might do fome Execution among them.\nThe Steward approved of this Defign, only\nwith this Addition 5 if we throw down but into\none Parlour, they will all fly into the Gaming-\nroom, and fo it will do no Execution j but, fays he,\ntake three, and put down one into each Chimney,\nfor the Funnels go up all together, and then they\nwill not know which Way to run.\nWith thefe Orders two of the Men, who ve-\nry well knew the Place, went up, and firing the\nFuzees of the Granadoes, they put one Shell into\neach of the Funnels, and down they went roaring\nin the Chimney with a terrible Noife, and (which\nwas more than all the reft) they came down into\nthe Parlour where almoft all the Rogues were,\njuft at the Moment that the Fellow that fpoke to\nthe Spe6tre was frighted into a fvvooning Fit, and\nfallen on the Floor.\nG 4 The\n\fgg iToe Htfiory and Reality\nThe whole Gang was frighted beyond Ex^\nprcflion 5 feme run back into the gaming Parlour\nwhence they came, and fome run to the other\nDoor which they came in at from the Hall 5 but all,\nat the fame Inftant, heard the Dm\/, as they thought\nit was, coming down the Chimney.\nH A D it been poffible that the Fuzees of the Gra*\nnadoes could have continued burning in the Funnel\nof the Chimnies, where the Sound was a thoufand\ntimes doubled by the hollow of the Place, and\nwhere the Soot burning fell down in Flakes of Fire,\nthe Rogues had been frighted out of their Under-\nilandings 5 imagining, that as they had one dreadful\njDm\/jull among them in the Chair, fo there were\nten thoufand more coming down the Chimney to\ndeftroy them all i and perhaps to carry them all\naway.\nBut that could not be 5 fo after they had been\nfufficiently feared with the Noife, down came thp\nShells into the Rooms, all three together : It happen'd\nas luckily as if it had been contriv'd on purpofe,\nthat the Shell which came down into the Parlour\nwhere they all were, burft as foon as ever it came\nto the Bottom, fo that it did not give them time\no much as to think what it might be, much lefs\nto know that it was really a Hand-Granadoej but\nas it did great Execution among them, fo they as\ncertainly believ'd it was the Devil^ as they believed\nthe Spe6tre in the Chair was the Devil.\nThe Noife of the buriling of the Shell was (b\nfudden and fo unexpected, that it confounded them,\ni|nd the Mifchief v\/as alfo terrible 5 the Man that\nfainted and who lay on the Ground was killed out-\nright, and two more that ftond juft before the\nChimney J fiveofthcm were dciperately wounded,\nwhereof one had both his Legs broke, and was fo\n*\n^efpci^aie, that when the People from the Country\ncam\u00a9\n\fef APPARITIONS. 8p\ncame in, he fhot himfelf thro' the Head with his\nown Piftol^ to prevent his being taken.\nHad the rclt of them fled out of the Parlour\ninto the two other Rooms, 'cis probable they had\nbeen wounded by the other Shells 5 but as they\nheard the Noife in both the outer Rooms, and be-\nfides were under the Surprife of its being not a\nHand-Granado, but the Z)^^\/, they had no Power to\nftirj nor, if they had, could they know which way\nto go to be fafe : fo they ftood flock dill 'till both the\nShells in the other Rooms burft alfoj at which be-\ning confounded, as well with the Noife as with\nthe Smoke, and expe61:ing more Devils down the\nChimney where they ftood, they run out all that\nWay, and made to the Door, helping their wound-\ned Men along as well as they could 3 whereof one\ndied in the Fields after they were got away.\nIt muft be obferv'd, when they were thus\nalarmed with they knew not, what coming down\nthe Chimney, they cryed out, that the Devil in\nthe Chair had fent for more Devils to deftrby them\n;\nand 'twas fuppos'd that had the Shells never come\ndown they would all have run away. But certain it\nwas, that the artificial Devil joyning fo critically\nas to Time with the vifionary Devils^ or whatever\nthey were, com pleated their Diforder, and forced\nthem to fly.\nWhen they came to the Door to the two\nMen, they made fignals for their Comrades, who\nwere ported in the Avenues to the Houfe, to come\nto their Reliefi who accordingly came up, andaf-\nlifted to carry off their Wounded Men : but after\nhearing the Relation of thofe that had been in the\nHoufe, and calling a fhort Council a little way\nfrom the Door, (which, tho' dark as it was, the\nSteward and his Men could perceive from the Win-\njdow,) they all refolved to make off.\nThere\n\fj)0 7^^ Hiflory and Reality\nThere was another concurring Accident^whicli\ntho' it does not relate to my Subjefl:, I mud fet;\ndownro compleat the Story, i;\/2;.That two of thefe\nGranadoes by the Fire oftheir Fuzes fet the Chim-\nneys on Firej the third being in a Funnel that had\nno Soot in it, the Room having not been fo much\nufed, did not. This Fire flaming out at the top, as\nis ufual, was feen by fome Body in the Village,\nwho run immediately and allarmed the Prieft or\nPadre^ and he again rais'd the whole Town, be-\nlieving there was fome Mifchief fallen out, and\nthat the Houfe was fet on Fire.\nHad the reft of the Gang not refolvM to make\noff, as is faid above, they had certainly fallen into\nthe Hands of the Townfmen, who ran immediately\nwith what Arms came next to Hand, to the\nHoufe. Bat the Rogues were fledjleaving, as above,\nthree of their Company dead in the Houfe, and\none in the Field.\nI M u s T confefs, I cannot draw many Inferences\nto my purpofe from the Particulars of this Story,\nwhich however I have told for your Diversion j\nbut from the General I may 5 namely. This Apparition\nwas certainly not in favour of the Robbery 5 and if\nall the Particulars are true in Faft as related, we can\nhardly with Juftice place them to Satan's Account.\nTake him as a Deftroyer and a Father of Mifchief,\nhe could not be fuppos'd to have appeared to pre-\nvent the Robbing the Houfe,or to aflift the Steward\nin the Houfe in defence ofhis Mafter's Goods: what\nGood Spirit this muft be, and from whence, is then\na remaining Queftion, and that brings it to my\npurpofe again.\nI SHALL give you another Story out of more\nAuthentick Records, tho' related in a different\nmanner by feverai People, as their feveral Interefts\ninclin'd them.\nJJMES\n\fof AP PARiriO NS. pi\nJAMES IV.

This Man was (as it feems by the Story) per-\nceived by the King before he came clofe up to him,\nand before he was feen by any of the People 5 and\nthe King aho perceiv'd him to be earnellly looking\nat him, and at the Noble Perfons about him, as if\ndefiring to fpeak to him.\nAfter fome little time he prefs'd thro' the\nCrowd, and came clofe up to the King, and, with-\nout any Bow or Reverence made to his Perfon,\ntold him with a low Voice, but fuch as the King\ncould hear very diftindly.

But the People con-\njftantly and with one Voice affirmed that it was an\nAngel, and that it immediately difappear'd after the\nMeffagewas delivered-, that they plainly fawhimand\nfelt him thrufting to get by them as he went up,\nbut not one could fee him go back.\nThe King upon this was fatisfied that 'twas not\na real Body^but an Apparition > and it put him into a\ngreat Coniiernation, and caufed him to delay his\nMarch a-while, and call feveral Councils of his No-\nbility to confider what to do.\nBut the King being ftill over-perfwaded by\nthofe Engines who were cmploy'd by Mon-\nfieur La Motte, the French Ambafladorj con-\ntinu'd in his Defigns for a War, and advanced after-\nwards with his Army to the ^weed^ which was in\n\u2022\nthofe times the ufaal Boundary ofthe two Kingdoms.\nHere the Army refted fome time, and the\nKing being at Jedburgh^ a known Town in thofe\nParts, as he was fitting drinking Wine very plen-\ntifully in a great Hall of the Houfe, where his Head-\nQuarters was then held,fuppos'd to be the old Earl\nof Morton's Houfe in that Town j the Spedre came\nto him a fecond time, tho' not in the Form which\nit appeared in at Lithgo^ but with lefs regard or rc^\nfpc6t to the Prince, and in an imperious Tone told\nhim, he was commanded to warn him not to proceed\n\\x\\ that War, which if he did, he fhould lofe not\nthe Battel only, but his Crown and Kingdom : and\nthat after this, without ftaying for any Anfwcr, like\nthe Hand to King Ahafuerus^ icwenp to the Chim-\nney,\n\fof APPARITIONS. jj\nney, and wrote in the Stone over it, or that which\nwe call the Mantle-piece, the following Diftich,\nLdeta fit ilia dies^ Nefcitur Origo fecundi\nSit labor an refuies^ fie tranftt gloria Mundi.\nThat the King did not liften to either of thefc\nNotices, our Hiftories,as well as Buchanan the Hi-\nftorian of Scotland^ take Notice of very publickly\n;\nand that he marcht on, fought the Englifij at\nFlodden-Field^ and there loft his Army, all his for-\nmer Glory, and his Life, isalfo recorded ^ I need\nfay no more of it.\nThese two Apparitions were certainly from fuch\nSpirits as we are fpeaking of, viz. fuch as mean\nwell to Mankind, and being Good and Beneficent\nin their Nature, would prevent the ruin or de-\nftru6bion of thofe whom they appear to : But\nhave not always Power to dired the Meafures, or\nto oblige the Perfons to hearken to their Advice.\nHad it been a Heavenly Vifion, 'tis more than\nprobable it would have laid hold of the King's\nHand, as the Apparition of iVngels didtoLo\/,and as it\nwere dragg'd him away, and faid You fhall not go\nforward, that you may not be defeated and flain,\nboth you and your Army.\n.

I might enlarge upon\nthe Nature of this Apparition of the Saints which\nflept 5 the manner of it, and efpecially the Reafon\nof it, and fhew you how it was really miraculous,\nand done to convince the doubting Difciples of the\nTruth of the Refurredion, which fome of them,\nbeing perhaps originaly Sadduces, might ftill que-\nftion i but my Bufinefs is with an Age not too much\ndelighted in ferious Excurfions, fo I muft not make\nany Trefpafs, however feafonable, or turn grave,\nhowever ufcfuL Let\n\fi6 The Hijiory and Reality\nLet it then be fuffieient to the Purpofc, thi\nApparition of Souls was extraordinary and mira\nculous, and we are to expeft them no more 5 thei\nState is determined, the happy are too happy, an\ntheir Happinefs too firmly fix'd, to fufFer any fuc\nInterruption 5 the Unhappy have their Confine\nment too firmly fix'd, to break Prifon, and ge\nout 5 in a word, thefe cannot, and the other woul\nhot if they could 5 and we are not to cxpeft t\nfee or hear from them any more on this Earth\n'till the Reftitution of all things, and 'till the\niliall be all fummon'd to that grand Appearance, whic\nwe believe will one Day happen, whatever 01\nflaming Age pretend to fay to the contrary.\nAll Apparition then of thefe two Heads c\nSpecies being concluded impoffible in Nature, an\nJiot to be expected, we muft look for it then i\nmong the Angelick Spirits j and here indeed it is t\nbe found : Angels of all the Kinds have appear'c\nmay and do appear, and of them alone are all i\\\nApparitions, which have any Reality in them, form'(\nThis is bringing the Matter into a narrow\nCompafs, and putting an end to Cavil and Quai\nrel about it j there is no need to wrangle upc\nit any morej but when you at any time fc\nan Apparition, or Appearance of Spirit aflumin\nShape and Voice, and you are furc it is really a\nApparition, not a Deceptio Fifus^ a Cloud, a V;\npour of the Imagination 5 I fay, whenever you fc\nfuch an Apparition, depend upon it 5 'tis an Ange\nor a Devil.\nI HAVE only one DIftinftion to make hen\nwhich tho' it be neceflary, fhall be very fhort ar\nclear, viz. That when I fpeak of Angels I mu\nbe underjftood as follows,\nFIRST, The Word Angel is to be underftoc\nof good Angels j for the Devils, as I have faid, ai\nalfo Angels : Satan is called an Angel qf Light\nbi\n\fof APPARITIONS. \\if\nbut the evil Angels I fliall always treat v\/ith their\nnew Sirname, Devih, fo that when 1 fpeak of An-\ngels, I am always to be undcrilood of the good\nAngels.\nSECONDLY, But of good Angels, thefe I di-\nftinguiih alfo into two Kinds;\n(I.) The Angels which are aftually in Hea-\nven, fuch as we read of, Gabriel^ Michael, and\nothers not diftinguifhed by Name 5 thefe have ap-\npeared amongft Men, upon this Earth, as I have\ni\nalfo faid before at large j but even thefe, we have\nI\nReafon to believe, we fhall fee no more > God having\nI\npleafed to difcover himfelf to his People now in a-\nI\nnother Way, by another Miniftration, namely, by\nI\nhis Spirit, and by an Evangelick, not an Angelick\nMiniftry.\n(z.) That Rank of Angels or Spirits, call\nthem as we pleafe, (and whether inferior or not,\n; we are not to determine,) who are placed by\nj\nthe Direflrion of God himfelf in a nearer Situation\n[j\nto us 5\nplaced, I fay, by their Maker, under his fu-\nj\nperior Providence, for the Direftion and Condu6t\nof human Creatures, and of their Affairs, or at lead\nto Guard them from the Invafions, Threatning,\nand Hellifh Defigns of the Prince of Darknefs and\nhis Angels i and thefe, as I faid, might well becall'd\nGuardian Angels to the whole Earth.\nNow, thefe two forts of Spirit, viz. the Guar-\ndian Angels, the good Spirits detach'd, as I may\nand did call it, from Heaven, to have the Infpedion\nover, and Care of his new Creation, as well here\nas elfewhere; thefe, and the Devils, that other fore\nof Angels, of whom I may have Occafion to fpealc\n(more than a great deal) in this Work ^ Thefe, I fay,\nmay, and do appear, and all Apparition is really be-\ntween them 5 all Spirit you can fpeak of, or pretend\nto fee the Appearance of, muft be one of thefe two,\nmuft be Jngel or Devil, there is no other, there\ncaQ\n\f1 28 The Hifiory and Reality\ncan be no other: Miracle, and fomething more than\nmiraculous, and Things which we have no Reafon\nto look for, only excepted.\nBut on the other hand, as certain as that no o-\nther Spirit does, or can, and as certainly as they\ndo not, or cannot appear > fo as certain, and paft\ndifpute is it, that thcfe Spirits, both good and bad,\ndo appear to us upon all Occafions -, I mean all\nOccafions which they judge needful, and which,\nhappens to them, whether by choice or conftraint.\nIt is not indeed in us to determine how they are\nmov'd to go upon thefe Errands, or in what man-\nner 5 I may perhaps give fome probable Opinions\nabout the Manner and Caufes both of their Miffion.\nand Permiffionj for I take thofe two Heads to con-\ntain the Regulation of their Aftings j I fay Commtf-\nfion and Permijjion^ and without thefe we are fure\nnever to be vifited in this manner, either by one or\nother.\nI T is true that this gives a confiderable San6bio\u00bb\nto the Thing call'd Apparition in general, and\nmakes it appear to be more folemn than we are\nwilling to make its for by this Rule, neither De-\n*vil or Angel appears but upon fome extraordinary\nOccafionj and if it be fo, I do not fee why we\nfhould like it the worfej for if they were to ftiew\nthemfelves upon every trifling Occafion, they\nwould either terrifie Mankind fo as to make the\nWorld intollerable to him, or famiharife themfelvcsi\nfo as not to be regarded.\nNow as it would be the Devil^ not the good\nSpirits, that would thus haunt the World upon\nTrifles J (for the other cannot be fuppofed to do it)\nfo they would carry on the Familiarity too far, and\nMen would be fo far from being frighted and ter-\nrified at him, that in fliort there would be more\nDanger in the Intimacy 5 and, as we fliy in another\nCafe,,\n\fof AP P ARiriO^S. ijp\nCafe, Mankind and the Devil might be too well\nacquainted.\nBut firft to the Fad, that thefe Spirits, both\ngood and bad, D o thus A p p e a r j and then to the\nReafon of it. That they do appear, the Hiflory,\nExperience, and Report of all Ages confirm it^\nthey always have, and ftill do. The Appearances of\nSpirits are confirmed many ways, Hiftory is full of\nExamples > and facred Hiilory itfelf, tho' it does not\ngive Relation of particular Apparitions, yet con- \u2022\nfirms the thiiig, as a Reality, and out of Queftion*\nChrist himfelf, after his Refurreftion, feeing\nhis Dilciples frighted and terrified at his Appearance,\ntakes a great deal of Pains to convince them that\nhe was not a Spirit or an Apparition, as they feared :\nLuke'Kxiv. yj. T'hey were terrified and affrighted^ and\nfuppos'd that they had feen a Spirit. This would be\nwhat it is too diihonourable to fay of the facred\nWrit, if Apparition of Spirit in the Shape of Bo-\ndy did never come, and that there were no fuch\nthing in Nature.\nSee then what our blefled Lord fays to them\nupon it, v, 3 p. Behold my Hands and my Feet^\nthat it is Imyfelf: handle me^ and fee -^ for a Spirit hath\nnot Flefi and Bones, as ye fee me have. This is as\ndire6b and pofitive as any thing of its kind can\nbe fuppos'd, or defir'd to be. If there were no\nfuch things as Spirits appearing, how could Jefus\nChrift have exprefied himfelf in fuch a manner ? the\nLanguage is plain, You think you fee a Spirit, that\nis an Apparition, and you may have fome Reafons\nfor your Apprehenfion, becaufe I came in thus un-\nfeen, when the Door was ihut : Now a Spirit\nmay indeed aflume a Shape, and look like the Per-\nfon it appears for j but if you were to come near\nto it, you would find a Spirit, an Apparition, has\nonly the Appearance, it has not Flejh and Bones as\n\fijo The Hijlory and Reality\nyou fee me have : Therefore 1 am not a SpeElre or\nApparition^ but a real Body.\nSo when he came walking upon the Sea to his\nDifciples, and they were fo frighted that they cried\nout, believing that they had feen a Spirit 5 it muft\nbe out of Queftion that there were fuch things, and\nthat they, the Difciples, had heard of them 5 nay,\nperhaps, they had feen fuch Apparitions themfelves\nbefore that 5 why elfe fhould they be fo frighted as\nto cry out, Matth, xiv. 26. And when the Difciples\nfaiv him walking on the Sea^ they were troubled^ fay\"\ning^ It is a Spirits and they cried out for fear. And\nwhy, when our Saviour fpoke to them, did he not\nreprove them for being frighted at their own Ima-\ngination, and fancy, (like Children,) that they faw a\nSpirit, when there were no fuch things in the\nWorld, and no Apparitions to be feen?\nOn the other hand he fpeaks kindly to them,\nknowing that Apparitions are frightful Things to\n^People not ufed to fee them, and bids them be of\ngood Cheerj it is not a Spirit, it is \/, he not afraid -^\n'tis no Apparl^'on, but myfelf in reality. So alfo\nyou have the Story, Mark vi. fo.\nAgain, you have a perfe\u00a3t Defcription of an\nApparition in the very manner we are jull now\ndifcourfing about it, Job iv. if, 16. 'Then a Spirit\npajfed before my Face^ thh Hair of my Flejh foodup. It\nfioodjiill^ but I could not difcern the Form thereof: an\nImage was before mine Eyes^ there was ftlence^ and I\nheard a Voice. Eliphaz was a Man of Senfe, he was\nnot deluded to fpeak of Things not in Being, he\nfaw an Apparition, not a Fancy.\nAgain, Jojhua faw an Apparition, as I mention'd\nonce before, Jofi. v. 1:5. A Man with a drawn\nSword in his Hand, This was an Angel, that is to\nfay a Spirit, and yet it fpoke to him, and had the\nShape of a Man in Arms, with a Sword in his\nHand.\n\fof APPARITIONS. 131\nHand. Had Jojhua ofFer'd to touch it, or been per-^\nmitted to touch it, he would not have found it had\nFlejh and Bones -y we have our Saviour's Words for\nit, A Spirit has not Flesh and Bones; an Ap-\nparition is a Spirit afluming a Shape of Fleih and\nBlood, but without the Reality.\nAnd this Anfwers all thole fanciful People who\nfay to us, that they faw fuch or fuch a Perfon : I\nfaw him, fays the Ignorant frighted Vifionift, per-\nfeftly! I know him well enough! I am fure 'twas\nhim ! I faw him plainly ! Hence they conclude ic\nmuft be the Soul of fuch a Perfon, becaufc, fay\nthey, it had his very Countenance and his Cloaths\non : nay, riding on the fame Horfc as he us'd to ride\non : when the truth of the Cafe is this, the Man is ^\ndead, his Body rotting in the Grave, his Soul car-\ntied into the remote Regions of eternal Felicity\nor Horror unalterable, and that immoveable, as to\nreturning this Way : his Cloaths that were feen,\nt are lying in the Cheil, or the Prefs, where they\nufually lay, and the poor Horfc grafing in the\nField, or perhaps quiet in the Stable, and not at\nall difturb'd. All that is to be faid, the good An-\ngel that perhaps had fome fecret Commiflion to the\nRelid: or Remains of the Man's Family j to give\nthem Notice of fome Evil, to warn, to admonifh, (^c,\naflumes the Shape and Appearance of the Man him-\nfelf, cloaths himfelf in his Likenefs, forms the\nApparition in Air, of his Cloaths, his Countenance,\nhis Horfe, as a Painter cloathes the Cloth he paints\non with Faces, Poftures, Habits, Garments, all in\nColours, while the paffive Perfon reprcfented is no\nway affeded with, or concerned in the Draught\nrcprefenting him.\nAnd why ihould not this Spirit, thus commif-\nfion'd to go on fuch an Errand, be able to amufe\nus with the Appearance of a Perfon departed; ta-\nking up his Shape, Countenance, Cloath?, i^c.\nK z tho'\n\f132. 7he Hiflory and Reality\ntho' the Soul of the Perfon is not aflFe61:ed with,\nor concern'd in it? when it is known that we of-\nten fee Apparitions of Perfons living, whom we fee\nand fpeak to, and converfe with j know their Faces,\ntheir Voices, their Cloathsj and yet the Perfons\nthemfekes know nothing of the matter.\nI HAVE by me a very diverting Hiflory upon\nthis Subjeft, which I Ihall abridge for the prefect\npurpofe, as follows, viz,\nA CERTAIN young Lady of born in\nthe County of had been long courted by\na young Gentleman, whofe Father had a very good\nEftate in the fame Town : fhe had kept him Com-\npany too openly, but had not yielded to his Im-\nportunities for a criminal Converfation, tho' her\nReputation fuffer'd for it as if ihe had; but at\nlength (he was fo far over-perfuaded, that fhe made\nan Appointment to be at fuch a time at a Far-\nmer's Houfe, a Tenant of his Father's, and who\nwere, it feems, let into the wicked Secret.

She did not tell the Woman what had hap-\npen'd to her, but that fhe was taken with a fit of\ntrembling, and that if Ihe had not fat down fhe\nmufl have fallen down \u2022, all which was true : fo the\npoor Woman help'd her up, and led her home,\nwhere fhe continued very ill of the Fright for fe-\nveral Days.\nIn this time fhc had a very great defire to fee the\nGentleman, for by what the Apparition faid to\nher fhe made no doubt but he had feen ic too.\nAfter feme time he had heard that fhe was\nvery ill, and thinking what he had faid to her\nmight have had fome influence upon her, to hurt\nher, he refolv'dto go and fee her 5 for tho' he lUd\nruffled her pretty much j yet, as he faid afterwards,\nhe\n\fof APPARITIONS. 149\nhe lov'd her very well > and the better for her To\nfeafonably recovering her Virtue and good Princi-\nples 5 and much better than he belicv'd he fhould\nhave done, if he had had his Will of her, as he\nihould certainly have had, if fhe had met him that\ntime at the Farmer's.\nWith thefe kind Thoughts he went to vifit\nher> and tho' fhe was very ill, yet fhe would be\nbrought out of her Chamber to fee him.\nAfter fomc Civilities, he frankly told her the\nreafon of his Vifit word for word as abovCj and\nthat he came to chear her up a little.\nShe thank'd him j but told him it was true it\nhad extremely troubled her, to think firft how\nnear fhe had been to her utter Ruin, and then how\nneedlefly fhe had been exposed for it j and that tho'\nfhe had no Guilr, as he very well knew, other than\nthat which was in the firft wicked Confentingj yet\nfhe had been as much expos'd, as if fhe had been\nreally his Whore.\nHe protefled to her that he never had opened\nhis Lips of it to the Do6tor, or any one elfe 5 and\nthat it was the Refentment at*the charging him\nwith it, that had made him fo angry, and nothing\n\u20aclfe i for that he fcorn'd any thing fo bafe.\nShe told him it was impofUble for any one to\nbelieve otherwife before 5 but that fhe believ'd he\nwas fatisfied how it all was, nowj and that fome-\nthing had happen'd fince, which had open'd her\nEyes, tho' it hadalmofl kill'd her j arid fhe believ'd\nhe knew fomething of it too.\nH E wanted to know what it was, for he pro-\ntefted he knew nothing. What fays he^ is there\nany more Myileries ?\nSHE faid^ fhe could not tell him, becaufe fhe\nfuppos'd he would not believe her.\nHE anfwer'd^ he would believe her in every\nthing, that he ought to believe any body in.\nL J\nSHE\n\fI JO The Hijloyy and Reality\nS HE told him^ fhe believ'd there would be nc\noccafion to tell him, for that fhe did not doubi\nbut he would be inform'd the fame way that fhc\nwas, if he was not already.\nHe importun'd her earneftly to let him \u00a3ho\\K\nwhat it was; and that with fuch a ferious kind o\nDifcourfe, that fhe fancy'd he had feen fomethin^\ntoo 'y but it feems he had not : However he en-\ntreated her fo much, that at laft fhe let him kno>^\nthe whole Story, as above.\nThere is a great deal more belongs to thi;\nStory, which would be very diverting, and . noi\nwithout its Ufes too j but as the particular Rela-\ntion does not come within the verge of my owr\nKnowledge, I cannot vouch all the Particulars, at\nleafl not fufficiently.\nHowever, 'tis enough to the Cafe in hand ;\nIf the Apparition came to prevent this poor de-\nluded young Lady from proflituting her felf to gi\nMan that had wheedled her in upon fuch difhonou\nrable Terms ; it could not certainly be the Devil\nor any Spirit of his Clafs, or under his Govern-\nment and Diredion; he would never have exhorted\nher to go back, reproach'd her with the Crime,\nand prevail'd upon her to believe it had been re\nveal'd to him by the Treachery of her Lover.\nThis muft be certainly one of thofe Angelicfci\nGuards which the God of Nature, in Mercy ta\nMankind, has placed as a detach'd Body of Spirit;\nto counter-aCt the Devil^ prevent the Arch-ene*\nmy feducing his Creatures, and over-whelming the\nWorld with Crime; and if the Story be as 1 have\nreceiv'd it and now handed it down, it feems a\nmerciful Difpofition of Providence in Favour of\nthe Gentleman, as well as the Lady; and be it a Pa-\nrable or a Hiftory, the Moral is the fame, and the\nImprovement of it the fame too : They that are\nrunning the fame Courfe of Folly would have Rea-\nfon\n\fof APPARITIONS. lyr\nfon to be very thankful if they were fure to meet\nwith the fame kind of Difappointment, and would\nnever fay it was the Devil that told it them.\nThe Gentleman it feems did not flight the\nStory fo much as flie cxpe6led he would, nor did\nhe queftion the Truth of any or every Part of it ;\nfor fhe told it with fo much Steadinefs, always a-\ngreeing in every Particular, and gave fo concur-\nring Accounts of the Circumflances as they related\nto what had happened before, that it was appa-\nrent 'twas no Delufion.\nThat which made him mofl uneafy, was that\nthe Apparition feem'd to promife to appear to\nhim 5 and he had no Defire to be convinced that\nway. Indeed the Story, at lead fo far as I have the\nParticulars, breaks off a little abruptly there and\ndoes not fay whether he ever faw any thing or no.\nBuc it faid, it made him be quite another Man in\nhis Way of living than ever he was before; and\nparticularly he was very thankful that he had been\nprevented being fo wicked with her as in all Pro-\nbability he had been, if this had not happened.\nNow this Apparition, as is faid above, could not\nwith any manner of Reafon, be fuppofcd to be the\nDevil '^ for why fhould an Evil Spirit appear, to\nkeep any Perfon from doing Evil ? Why fliould it\naflume a real Shape, namely that of a Mini iler in his\nGown and CafTock, and that ic was in Appearance\nthe very Minifter of the Pari(h; for all this fhe con-\nftantly affirm'd, and two things are natural Infe-\nrences from it.\nFIRSTy That the Appearance was real.\nSECONDLY^ That it was a good Spirit.\nLet the Divines read us Ledures upon the\nNature of Spirits, and upon how far they can or\ncannot take Cognizance of human Affairs ; That I\nhave nothing to do with here ; ray Bufinefs is to\nohferve the Matter of Fa\u00a3t, viz, that they do come\nL 4 hitherj\n\fijt The Hifiory ctnd Reality\nhither, do appear, and are feen, talk'd to and con\u00ab\u00ab\nvers'd with, and that they do come on good Errands,^\nand therefore are not likely to be evil Spirits or\nDevils.\nTake another Hiftorical Relation, which, tho'\nI name no Names, I have very good Authority for\nthe Truth of, and that more particularly than for\nthe other.\nAGentleman of a very good Eftate mar-\nried a Lady of alfoa good Fortune, and had one Son\nby her, and one Daughter, and no more, and after Jii\nfew Years his Lady died. He foon married a fecond\nVenter 5 andhisfecond Wife, tho' of an inferior Qua'\nlity and Fortune to the former, took upon her to dif-\ncourage and difcountcnance his Children by his firft\nLady, and made the Family very uncomfortable,,\nboth to the Children and to their Father alfo.\nThe firft thing of Confequence which this Con-\nduft of the Mother-in- Law produced in the Family,\nwas that the Son, who began to be a Man, ask'd the\n]F^ther's Leave to go abroad to travel. The Mother-\nin-Law, tho' willing enough to be rid of the young\nA4an, yet becaufe ic would require fomething con-\nsiderable to fupport his Expences abroad, violently\noppos'd it, and brought his Father alfo to refufe\nhim, after he had freely given him his Confent.\nThis fo affefted the young Gentleman, that\nafter ufing all the dutiful Applications to his Father\nthat he could pofHbly do, as well by himfelf as by\nfome other Relations, but to no purpofej and being\na little encouraged by an Uncle, who was Brother\nto his Mother, his Father's firft Lady, he refolv'd\nto go abroad without Leave, and accordingly did\nfo.\nWhat Part of the World he travelled into\nI do not remember 5 it feems his Father had con-\nilantly Intelhgence from him for fome cime, and\n^AZ prevailed ,with to make him a reafonable Al,-\nlowangq\n\fofAPPAR ITIONS.

And when he\ncame to the Counting-houfe Door, there fat his\nMan with the Book-keeper alfo, writing as he left\nhim.\nIt happen'd juft that Moment, fome occafion\nextraordinary oblig'd him to flep back again, and\ngo up Stairs to the Dining-Room, from whence he\ncame J and intending not to ftay, he did not fpeak\nto the young Man, but left him in the Counting-\nhoufe, and went immediately up Stairs.\nI T was not poflible that he, or any one elfe, ex-\ncept fuchascould walk invisible, could go by, or pais\nhimunfeen: Good Manners would have hindered the\nyoung Man from thrufting by his Mailer upon the\nStairs, if he had been going up j but he is pofitive\nhe did not, and cou'd not pafs, without being\nfeen.\nBut when he came to the top of the Stairs\nthere fat the young Man at Dinner with the other\nServants 5 the Room they din'd in being a little\nParlour, which opcn'd juft againft the Stairs, fo\nthat he faw him all the way of the upper Part of\nthe Stair-cafe, and could not be deceived.\nThe Mailer did not fpeak to him, which he\nwas very forry for afterwards 5 but the Surprize\nmade him pafs by the Room, and go into the Di-\nning-Room, which was to the right Hand of it,\nbut he fcnt one immediately to look, and he was\nthere really at Dinner 5 fo that what he (the Ma-\niler) faw below in the Counting-houfe, mud be the\nApparition, as it certainly was.\nBut this was not all : The young Gentleman em-\nbark'd as above, and arriv'd fafe with all his Effe6ls\nin America^ tho' he never liv'd to return. However,\nI cannot fay his Apparition in the manner as related\ncould have the lead Relation to his being fick,\nand dying abroad, which was not 'till thv^e\nYears\n\fof APP ARirjO NS. i6p\nYears afterwards. But what follow'd was of another ,\nkind.\nThis young Man had an elder Brother, who\nliv'd in London 'y he was a fine Gentleman, and\na Scholar, and was at that time ftudying Phyfick.\nHe was alfo a llout brave Gentleman, and in parti-\ncular underftood a Sword, that is to fay how to ufc\na Sword, as well as mod Gentlemen^in England,\nHe had an accidental Rencounter with a Gentle-\nman in the Street, in that fhort Street which goes\nout of Fket'fireet into Salisbury-Court -^ and being\nfo compleat a Mailer of his Weapon, he wounded\nhis Antagonift, and drove him into a Tavern in the\nStreet, from whence came out two Men more up-\non him with their Swords, but both of them found\nthe Gentleman fo much an Over-match for them,\nthat they left him as fail as the firftj whereupon a\nfourth came our, not with a Sword, but a Fire-\nFork taken haftily up out of the Tavern Kitchen, and\nrunning at this Gentleman with it, knock'd him\ndown, and broke his Skull, of which Wound he\nafterwards died.\nWhile this was done in London^ his Brother,\nas far off 2iS Bofton in New-England^ writing to his\nMafter the Merchant, (and who gives this Account\nof it) after other Bufinefs, writ this Poftfcript.\nS IR^ I beg you will be pleas'd in your Return to\nthis to let me havefame Account^ as much as conve-\nniently may hey of how my Brother doesy and\nwhat Condition he is in ; which you will excufa\nmy Importunity for^ when you read the follow^\ning Acccount^ (viz.)\nTHE 1.0th of\u2014 lafl^ about fix a Clock in the\nMorningy lying in my Bedy and broad awakcy my Bro-\nthery or an Apparition of my Brothery came to the\nBed's Fecty and opened the Curtainy looking full in my\nFace^ hut did not fpeak, I was very much frightedy but\nJpoweijer\n\f170 The Hifiory and Reality\nho'wever I fo far recovered as to fay to him^ Brother^\nwhat is the matter with you ?\n^ HE had a Napkin-Cap on his Headf which was\n' very bloody^ he lookd very pale and ghafily^ and\n* faid^ I am hafely murther d by \u2014-^ naming thi\n' Perfon^ but 1 fhall have Jufiice done me 5 and\n^ then difappear d.\nNow this Letter was fo dated, that it was im-\npoffible any Account could be fent of the Difafter,\nthat could reach thither in that timej for it was\nnot dated above fourteen Days after the Fa6t was\ncommitted in London -y\nand that it was Genuine I\nam well afllir'd, becaufe I faw the Letter within\nan Hour after it was received in London^ read it my\nfelf, and knew the young Man's Hand, and the\nyoung Man aifo perfe6i:ly well, as I did his Brothei\nthat was kiU'd alfo, very intimately.\nThe young Man was fober, religious and fend-\nblc, not given to Whimfie, or light-headed Fancies,\nnotvapourifhordiftemper'd, not apt to fee double, 01\nto dream wakmg, as many of our Apparition-making\npeople arej he was bcfides that a Scholar, and\nvery ferious : the firll I mention as a Prot\u20ac6kion tc\nhim from foolifh Imagination, and the laft fronc\nFalfhoodj and I am fatisfy'd, the Reader may de-\npend upon both the Stories, 1 mean as to the TrutF\nof them.\nI N my fpeaking of Apparitions as I have ftatec\nthe Cafe, I muft take leave to differ from the No-\ntions of the .Ancients, who 'tis evident underftooc\nall Apparition to be the Souls, or as we call them,\nthe Ghofts, of departed Perfonsj but when the)\ncame to make rational Conclufions from thofe firfi\nOpinions, What wild Additions were they driver,\nto make, to the firfb juft Conceptions which the)\nJiad form'd in their Mmd% ?\n\fof AP P ARITIO N S. 171\nTheir firft Conceptions, \/ fay^ were indeed juft,\nlonfiflenc with Reafon, and with Nature > for they\nroncluded, that when the Body is dead, and the\n>oul feparated, the State was determin'd.

And Plutarch gives us the fame\nDefcription at large.\nWhat learned Nonfenfe, and wiiat a greai\ndeal of it is here, to reconcile a thing, which upor\nthe Chriftian Foundation is made as eafie, as an}\nthing not immediately vifible to the common Eye,\ncan be made ?\nNature di\u00a3bated, and Reafon confirm'd, thai\nthe firft Principle, namely, the Soul, or as the)\ncall it, the Mind or Underflanding, fled to Heaver\nimmediately after Death, and return'd no more.\nThus Andromache mourning for the Lofs of hci\nHusband He^or^ is brought in fpeaking according\nto the Dodrine of the Ancients :\nT'hou to the difmal Realms for ever goney\nAnd I ahandou'd. =\nThe Dead once pafs'd to the difmal Realms (a;\nthey caird the Shades hdoyff) vjcrt gone for ever^ anc\nto return no more j but then they were perplex'd tc\nfind that they did return, as in this Cafe of Patro-\nclus to Achilles j tho' that (by the way) was a Drcan:\nonly, not an Apparition, or as we may call it ar\nApparition in a Dream, and no more.\nBut they had their Apparitions, and we read ol\nmany Apparitions of the Dead to the Livings ai\nparticularly in the famous Example of C^far ap-\npearing to Brutus: and this perplex'd them fo, that\nthey knew not how to fupport the Principle of the\nSoul not returning, under the Experience of Souls\nadtually returning in Apparition, vifiting and con-\nverfing with then* Friends, which was incontefli-\nble, daily Experience making it known to all\nParties.\nTo reconcile this they fled to Invention, and\nfirft to that of the Interval between the Death and\nthe\n\fof AVVARir ION S. i7y\nthe Funeral of the departed Souls j of which be-\nfore.\nBut this is liable to fo many jufl: Exceptions,\nfo many Abfurdities, that it could not facisfic Men\nof Senfe > for firft they were obliged to fay and\nprove, (which would be very difficult) that none of\nthe Souls of the Dead ever appear'd after the Func*\nral Rites were folemnizedj which if one Example\nhad contradifted, all the Arguments in the World\ncould not then have fupported the Fiftionj and\nthis I cannot doubt was contradided on many Oc-\ncafions.\n. And this no doubt made the ancient Syftem of\nthe JEgypians be reviv'd, and pafs better among\nthem afterwards 3 tho' whether the Romans received\nit or no, we do not find afcertain'd in any Part of\ntheir Hiftory.\nBesides, there was an Abfurdity in the very\nDo6trinc it felf j for if the Apparition of a departed\nSoul was limited by this Circumftance of burning\nthe Body, or performing the Funeral Rites > it put\nthe State of the Dead in that particular Refpcdt into\nthe Power of the Living : for Example^ If the Living,\nwho had PofTeflion of the dead Bodies of Perfons\n(lain, fuppofe them Friends, had PofTeffion of the\nBody, the Soul of that Body, tho' unembodied and\ndifmifs'd, could not be admitted to reft, or as they\nexprefs'd it,couidnot pafs into the Shades or Realms\nbelow > fo if the Enemy had PofTeflion of the Body,\nit was in the Power of the Enemy to keep the\nSoul out of Heaven : an Abfurdity fo grofs, one\nwould think the wifer Heathens could never enter-\ntain fuch a Thought: Yet that fuch it was, the\nWords of Patrocim\\ Ghoft quoted from Homer\nmakes evident.\nLet my pale Corfe the Rites of Burial know^\nAnd give me Entrance in the Shades helow,\nUnhap-\n\f1 7(J The Hijlory and Reality\nUnhappy Patroclus! How grofs would this\nfound, how harih and unmufical in our Times,\nwhen Chriftianity has given us more juft Ideas of\nthings? Patroclus could not get leave to go to the\nShades below, 'till his Funeral Rites were per*\nform'd 'y that is, in our Senfc, could not be admitted,\nno not into Hell it fclf, 'till his Body was burn'd\non the Funeral Pile or Pyre, and his Afhes depo-\nfited in an Urn -, that is, buried like a Gentleman.\nB Y which Rule, the Souls of thofe poor Crea-\ntures who were killed in the Wars, and were left\nunburied in Heaps in the Field, or only a Pile of\nStones thrown upon them, as was often the Cafe,\nare wandring Hill, and neither admitted into Hea-\nven or Hell.\nAgain, it was in the Power of the Enemy, if\nhe had a Body in Poflcffion, to prefervc his Hatred\nagainft that Enemy even beyond Death, and by keep-\ning him unburied, keep his Soul or Spirit fufpended,\nwandring, and forgotten in the Air, and neither ad-\nmitted to one or other Place, whether above or\nbelow.\nThus Jchilles had the Body of Hedlor in his\nPower twelve Days, and Hom$r brings him in\ntriumphing over his Enemy in that cafe, and in a\nmanner unworthy of a Man of Honour. When he\nfpeaks to the Ghoft of his j^riend Patroclus^ and\nvows to facrifice twelve Trojan Prifoners ac his Fu-\nneral Pile i he adds,\nAchilles' Promife is compleat^\n^e bloody He&or J^retch'd before thy Feet^\nLof to the Dogs his Carcafe I refign.\nGloomy he faidy and horrible in Fiew^\nBefore the Bier the bleeding Hedor threWy\nProne on the Dufl,\nIliad lib. xxiii. line 3f.\n\fof APPARITIONS. 177\nSo again, Achilles mourning over the Body of Pa^\ntroclus as it lay on the Funeral Pile, and the Fire\nnot yet J<:indled j I fay, there again he threatens to\ndeny Hedior a Soldier's Burial.\nBut heavier Fates on Heftor'j Corfe attend.\nKept from the Flames for hungry Dogs to rend.\nThis was a terrible Curfe, and very cruel to poor\nHeBor after he was dead, not to fuffer his Soul to\nenter into the Shades below, which would be (to fpealc\nic in our Language) not to give him leave to go to\nHell > that the Gods it feems thwarted AchilleSy\nand would not let his Cruelty take place, but he\nwas oblig'd to grant Priam a Truce, and let the\n^Trojans bury him.\nSo [pake he, threatning: But the Gods made vain\nHis I'hreat, and guard inviolate the Slain,\nCeleftial Venus hover''d o\\r his Head,\nAnd ro\nfeat Unguents, heavenly Fragrance I fhed^\nShe watch'd him all the Night, and all the Day,\nAnd drove the Blood-hounds from their deflin'd Prey,\nSo that the Burying of HeBor was made the Care\nof the Gods, defeating the cruel Vengeance of\nAchilles,\nTo what Length did this foolifli Notion of the\nAncients carry this Point ! putting it into the Power\nof a Man's Enemy to keep his Soul out of Heaven\nitoo, as long as his Enemy thought fit to keep the\nBody out of the Grave.\nHappy it is for us in thefe malicious Days that\ntit is otherwife herej when not Enemies only, but\nleven cruel Creditors, might arreft the dead Body of\nitheir Debtor, and even fend the Soul of him to the\nDevil, or keep it hovering and wandring in the Air\n'till their Debts were paid : As Times go now, and\nN as\n\f178 The H'tfiory and Reality\nas Chanty ftands now rated among us, no poor\nDebtor could be at Reft any more after he was Dead,\nthan he could before, 'till his Debts were all paid.\nNay, tho' it had pleas'd a merciful Father to\nforgive him his Sins, and as we allow it*s poflible,\nin fpi^e of the cruel 2\" S that a\nBrankrupt may die in the State of a pardoned Peni-\ntent > yet I fay 'till the Debt was paid the more\ninexorable Creditor fhould refufe to let him be ad-\nmitted into Heaven 'till he was paid the utmoft\nFarthing.\nI MUST confefs if this were the Cafe among\nus, I believe it would be the hardeft thing in the\nWorld to get a poor Bankrupt's Compofition ac-\ncepted, or his Certificate fignedj for if it was in\nthe Power of the Creditors to fend their Debtor?\nto the Devil^ I fhould be apt to fay with the Di-\nfciples of our Lord, Who then jhall he fa-ved?\nHow often do we find a Creditor give it foV ai\nAnfwer, when a folliciting Friend comes beggin\nhim to compound, and to accept the utmoft Shi\nling that the Debtor has to offer: How often,\nfay^ do we find the cruel Creditor reply, No not 1\nnifign none of it^ the Devil Jhall have him before \/'i\nfign it?\nNay, if his Soul was to hover in the Air, ;\nthe Ancients fiuicy'd, 'till the Body was buried 5\nqueltion whether they would let the Debtor go eii\nther to Heaven or Hell 'till they had their Money\nefpecially if the hovering or wandering in the A,\nwas a worfe Condition, as 1 don^t know but, whi\nthe Devils are faid to be there, it may.\nBut to return to the Ancients and their Not)\n^on of Futurity, and of Souls departed, the Dil\n'\nculty, as I have obferved, was very perplexinj^\nThey granted that after the Souls of Men wci\nonce determined, and tranfported in Charon's Ferr|\nboat 10 the other fide of the River *S'\/jvv, or tji\nSty\n\fof APPARITION S. 179\n'iJ^\/^^Gulph, they could return no more 5 and all\ntheir other Fables upon that Suhje6t would have\nbeen overthrown and come to nothing, if it had\nbeen otherwife j fuch as Cerberus barking continual-\nly at the Gate, Charon the Ferry-man carrying all\nover but bringing none back, and the like.\nBut notwithllanding this, as I have laid, they\nfound feveral of thefe Souls viliting the World in\nApparition, and this quite deftroy'd all the Scheme\nof their being in a determin'd States fo that they\nknew not what to think of next.\nHow would it have unravell'd all thofe hard\nKnots, and made every thing eafie to their Undcr-\nflanding, had they been let into this juft way of\nreafoning ?

Patroclm\nwould never have troubled Achilles with a Vifit\nfrom the Air, upon pretence of his being left to\nbe wandring about the Atmofphere for want of\nhis Funeral Rites j the Dogs, or the Crows, or the\nWorms might have feafted themfelves on He^of^\nCarcafs, it would never have difturb'd He6ior in the\nleaft, much Icfs would her Goddefs-fhip Ferns have\nconcern'd herfelf to proteft his Corps 'till the fu-\nneral Pile was prepared.\nThe Dodrine of the Soul's being a Shell or\nCafe form'd into a Shape, as a Mould is form'd into\nShape to receive the Brafs or Copper, and throw\ncut a Statue or Figure of this or that Heroe, which\nit is appointed to form > I fay, this abfurd Do6brine\nof the Soul, Body and Mind being three diftin6t\nPerfons in every Man, would not have found Place\nin the World j but all things would have been\nconceiv'd regularly of, and the World would have\nbeen rightly informed of future things, as well as\nof things prefent.\nHowever, to bring it down to our Cafe, all\nthis concurs to the Do&rine of Spirits, and the\nReality of their Appearance, which is the Cafe be-\nfore us: Their Friends departed did appear 5 what\nit was appeared they knew not, only negatively\nthey knew it was not their Bodies, however the\nShape might be aflumed 5 nor could they reconcile\nthat Part to their Underftanding. How it could\nbe, that the Body feem'd to appear and did not\nappear} or, as we might fay, appear'd as if they\nhad appear'd 5 but when a Tryal was ofFer'd, no\nBody could be found, as was the Cafe of PatrO'\n(lus and Acbillcs in Homsr^ which Mr. Pope thusi\ntranflates,\n\fof APPARITIONS. i8i\nHe faid^ and with his longing Arms ejfafd\nIn vain to grafp the vijionary Shade,\nLike a thin Smoke he fees the Spirit fly\nj\nAnd hears a feeble lamentable Cry,\nHow grofs an Ignorance is here in fo great a\nMan as Achilles ? to go about to grafp a Vifion ! to\nfeel a Shade ! One can hardly exciife the Poet for\nallowing Achilles^ who was the Heroe of the whole\nPoem, CO be fo weak, even in thofe Daysj but ic\nmuft be allowed 'twas all in a Dream, and imagi-\nnary, and it niight well awake him indeed, as ic\ndid, to grafp at a Man in Armour, and find nothing\nin his Arms but Smoke.\nThe Refult of it all is this, namely, the Re-\nality of Apparition was a certain, undoubted, and\nreceived thing > 'tis evident that they were noc\nqueftioned j for upon the Reality of the Appear-\nance of Souls, all thofe Pains were taken to fettle\nthe Poffibility of it. That it was fo, the Fre-\nquency of the thing left them no Room to que-\nftionj it would have been ridiculous to have dif-\nputed it 5 but how it could be, how to reconcile\nit to all the Notions of Soul and Body, the fu-\nture and the prefenc State, that was what no bo-\ndy could explain, and no body could undcrftand 5\nwhich Ignorance put their Invention fo much on the\nRack to find out and form Schemes for the bringing\nthe Particulars together, and making the Appearance\npoffible, whichthey daily found was in Fad real.\n'TwAs a little ftrange that tho' they were\nfatisfied by daily Demonftration that the Thing\nwas true, yet they were obliged to believe it was\nnot true at the fame time. They frequently faw\ntheir Friends appear, and yet knew they were noc\nin a Condition from whence they could return to\nappear. But the ftrangcft thing of all, at leaft to\nN J me^\n\fiSz The Hifiory and Reality\nme, is, that they iliould not, all this while, con-\nceive the* Poflibility of Spirits aflliming human\nShape, and appearing in their Figures, in their\nShapes, and in their Names.\nThis would have put an end to all the Dif-\nficulty, and have reconciled all the Doubts that\nattended it, and at the fame time would have led\nthem into feveral fublime Truths, fuch as they\nwere perhaps perfeftly ignorant of; as particularly\ninto the great Do6trine of the Unity of infinite\nPower > the univerfal Empire of Providence, and its\nGovernment and Influence of and upon all the\nAffairs of this World, even the moft minute things\nin Life; and many other valuable Inquiries.\nThat Apparitions were believed to be real in\nthofe Days, is evident from many Inftances of it given\nin Hiftory, tho' I have not room to look far back.\n'Tis faid that Alexander the Great was haunted by the\nGhoft of his Friend Clitus^ whom he had mofl un-\ngratefully tortur'd to Death, after a long Series of\nthe moft faithful Services, and fuccefsful alfo; but\nthere is no particular Account of it in Plutarch.\n\/.The Apparition of the Ghoft of Julius Cafar\nto Brutus a little before the Battel at Philippic tho'\nit be certain, is neverthelefs varioufly reported 5\nfeme Accounts relate it to be the Ghoft of Julius\nCafar^ and vulgar Opinion concurs with that Re-\nport; which is fo receiv'd at this time, that they\nfhow you an original antient Piece of fine Italian\nPainting at Naples^ where the Phantome is repre-\nfented bloody and wounded, with Cafca's Dagger\nfticking in his Shoulder, which he, Cafca^ reaching\nhis Arm over his Shoulder fix'd in or near his Col-\nlar Bone before, and left flicking there; according\nto which our Frontefpiece to this Work is at lealt\ndefign'd: Whether that Part of the Story be right\nreprciented or not, is difficult to determine.\nBut\n\fof APPARITIONS. 183\nBut according to other Accounts, the Appari-,\ntion was only of a Man, without any Similitude\nof C<efars and that when Brutus^ who was bufy\nwriting Difpatches for his Army which was then\ndrawing together to fight the O^avian Troops,\nlook'd up and faw him, he boldly ask'd, JVJoat art\nthou ? and the Apparition anfwcr'd,\/*^;;; thy evilGemuSj\nand I will meet thee again at Philippi > to which the\nundaunted Hero, unconcern'd at the Sight, and as\nif he defir'd him not to difturb him at that time,\nhe being then otherwife engaged, anfwer'd, J-Fell^\nril meet thee there^ and fo went on with his wri-\nting.\nB RUfUS was, without doubt, a Hero in his\npcrfonal Valour, and more fo in his Principle, viz,\nthe Love of Liberty, and of his Country j and as\nnothing but the Zeal for the Liberty of his Coun-\ntry could have embark'd him againft the Life of\ndefar^ who was otherwife his Benefa6]:or, fo he\nwas above the Fear of Death, and could not be in\nthe lead daunted at the Fore-knowledge of his Fate\n^x. Philippic feeing he had the Notion of Life which\nwas general at that time, namely, that a true He-\nroe could never be miferable, fince it was always\nin his Power to die a Freeman, and not to out-live\nany threatned Calamity, whether Perfonal or Na-\ntional.\nUpon this foot he enter'd that unequal Battel\nagainfl the OEiavianTroo^s with an undaunted Chear-\nfulnefsj for he was fare one way or other to come\noff vidorious i that is to fay, that if Augufitts con-\nquered his Army, he knew how to conquer J!f^\/^\/^\/\/\/ii\nif by the Slaughter of his Troops Cafar had the\nbetter of him, and defeated his Defigns for the Li-\nberty of his Country, He, by the Slaughter of him-\nfelf, knew how to defeat Aiiguftus in his Deligns of\nconquering ^n\/;f\/\/J, lince he refblv'd to die free, and\nnot furvive the Roman Liberty 5 and fo he did.\nN 4 And\n\f184 The Hijlory and Reality\nAnd upon this Foundation it was, that he was\nfo unconcerned at his approaching Fate, and fo\nundaunted in his looking at and fpeaking to the\nSpeftrc that appeared to him.\nBut we have yet abundance more Proofs by\nExample of the Reality of Apparitions.\nALA RICH the famous Gothick King, who o-\nver-run fo much of the Roman Empire, had an Ap-\nparition which came to him, and told him he\nihould undertake his Expedition againft the Romans^\nand that promised him Viftory and Succefs j fomc\nfaid it was an Angel, others that it was the Ghoft\nof his deceafed PredecefTor Rhadagaifeus, When he\nfirft undertook to raife his Army he v\/as intending\nto go upon a glorious Expedition to the Eaft, to\nwity againft the Hums and the Heruli 5 that is to\nfay, into Poland^ Sdavonia and Hungaria^ and per-^\nhaps Mufeovy or Ruffta. But upon the iVpparition\nfpeaking to him, he was encourag'd to undertake a\nWar againft the Romans in Italy-y where notwith-\nflanding he was routed and utterly overthrown by\nStilko 5 he afterwards returned into Italy^ kilPd\nStilico the Roman General, over- run the Country^\nand took and plundered the City of Rome it felf 5\nthis was Ann. 409 : fo that the A pparition,of what-\never kind it was, muft be fo far Angelic as to fore-\nknow Events and Iflues of things on Earth, which\nmuft be fuitable to the Angelic Heavenly Spirits,\nand fuperior to the Diabolic Spirits who know\nnothing Prophetic.\nNor is it any thing inconfiftent with the An\"-\ngclic exalted and good Spirits} for this was not\nencouraging Evil, but ftirring up a powerful\nPrince, who was to be Flagellum Dei^ to exe-\ncute the Divine Vengeance upon that wicked Peo-\nple the Romans^ whom God had refolved to deftroy,\nor at leafl to reduce very low : like as God is\nfaid\n\fof APP\/IRITIO NS. i8j\nfaid to flir up Nehuchadnezzar King of Bahylon to\ncome up againft Jerufakm.\nI s A Y this could not be the Devil, be-\ncaufe (as I have always infifted upon it^fo I do ftill)\nthat he knows nothing of what is to comej the\nDevil is no [Prophet, he cannot foretell or predi6t,\nother than by probable Guefles, rational Confe-\nquences, and fuch Circumftances in which he can\ngo farther than other People.\nYou have an Example of this in the famous\n5orcerefs Ja^uelim ; flie pretended to fpeak in the\nName of the Devil, and fometimes to have the\nDevil fpcak in her, jind fo to give Anfwers as by an\nOracle, and refolve Doubts and difficult Queftions,\nwhich fhe did to Admiration 5 and thereby got both\nFame and Money. Now it was obferv'd that when\nPeople came to her with Doubts and difficult Cafes,\neven fuch as none could refolve, relating to things\npaft or prefent, her Anfwers were furprizing j but\nif they came to her to ask any Opinion of things\nfuture, and what fhould be to come, the Devil was\nalways Nonpluft, and generally lyed in his Anfwers\n5\nfo that none eould depend upon any thing he faid.\nIn a word the Devil was not able to foretell any\nthing 3 and hence I infer, as I have always faid, the\nDevil is no Prophet, he can predift nothing, for\nhe knows nothing 5 and thatif any Apparition comes\nto be feen or heard, who takes upon it to tell\nwhat fliould come to pafs, you may depend upon it\nthat Apparition is not from the Devil.\nHence 1 think we may readily account for\nthat Story fo well publifli'd, whether fo well\nknown or no,of which Mr. j^uheyh^s given us the\nlafl: Relation, as follows\n:\n\"Two Perfons (Ladies) of Quality, both not\n\" being long fince deceafed, were intimate Acquain-\n''\ntance,and lov'd each other intirely : It fo fell our,\n*'\nthat one of them fell fick of the Small-Pox, and\n\" deiired\n\f1^6 The Hifiory and Reality\n\u00ab' defired mightily to fee the other, who would\n\" not come, fearing the catching of them j the\n'' Afflided at laft dies of them : llie had not been\n\" buried very long, but flie appears at the other's\n*' Houfe in the drefs of a Widow, and asks for her\n'' Friend who was then at Cards, but fends down\n*' her Woman to know her Bufinefs > who in\n*' fhort told her, flie muft impart it to none but\n*' her Lady, who after (he had received this An-\n\" fwer, bid her Woman have her into a Room5and\n\" defire her to flay till the Game was done, and\n^' ilic would wait on her. The Game being done,\n*' down Stairs fhe came to the Apparition, to know\n*^ her Bufinefs. Madam^ fays the Ghofl turning up\n^' her Veil, and her Face appearing full of the\n*' Small- Pox, Tou know \"very well that you and I\n*' lov'd intirely^ and your not coming to fee me I took\n\" fo ill at your Hands^ that I could not reft ''till I had\n^^\nfeen you^ and now I am come to tell you^ that you\n*' have not long to live^ therefore prepare to die 5 and\n*' when you are at a Teaft^ and make the thirteenth in\n*^ Number^then remember my Words > and fo the Ap-\n*^ parition vanifh'd. To conclude, fhe was at a\n^' Feafl where fhe made the thirteenth Perfon in\n'^ Number ^ and was afterwards asked by the de-\nceafed's Brother, whether his Sifter did appear to\nher, as was reported 3 fhe mads him no Anfwer,\nbut fell a weeping, and died in a little time after.\n^' The Gentleman that told this Story, fays, that\n\" there is hardly any Perfon of Quality but what\n'^ knows it to be true.\n'\n|\nI D o not enter into an Enquiry here whether the\n'\nStory is true or no, I believe it in Common, for it\nwas generally believ'd to be true : But 'tis flrange\nto have this brought for an Evidence of the Pre-\nfcienceoftheD^w73 whereas on the contrary it con*\nfirms what I have faid, vi%. That this cou'd not be\nthe Devilyox what we call the Appearance of the De*\n\fof APPARITIONS, 187\ni)\/7, no, nor could it be the Soul of the departed\nPerfonj and for the Apparition faying it could not\nbe at Reft, either it may be put in by fome of the very\nmany Authors relating the Story j or it might be\nfaid by the good Angel or Spirit appearing, to in-\ntroduce her Meflage, and to rouze the Mind of the\nPerfon fpoken to by fomething that fhould touch\nher more to the quick, be the more feeling, and\nfenfible to her, and fo make a due Impreflion upon\nher of the Truth of that which was to follow.\nBut firft, for its not being the Devil y for I\nhave granted that the Devil may make an Appari-\ntion, tho* far from inferring from thence that all\nApparitions are the Devil: But 1 fay as to its not\nbeing the Devil that appear'd here, in the Shape of\nthe deceas'd Lady, 'tis Evident,\nFIRSI'^ Becaufe, as I faid above, and have re-\npeated often, the Devil cannot prcdift, he has no\nPrefcience of things before they are in Views he\ncan juggle and play fcurvy Tricks of many kinds,\nas when he prophefied to the Farmer the Fall of\nhis Stack of Corn, and then rais'd a fudden Storm\nand blew it down. It may be he can fee atifomc\nfarther Diftance than we can, and judge of the Confe-\nquences of fuch and fuch Caufes better than we\ncan, and with a more perfe6b and exa6t Judgment,\nBut to predict things which are only concealed in\nthe Womb of Time, and behind the Curtain of\nProvidence, as this of Life and Death was, it is\nnot in Satan to do it j and therefore this could not\nbe from the Devil : the Lady was in Health, was\nChearful, nay Merry, was at a Feaft and at Cards.\nHere was no Signal of Death, or fo much as of\nSicknefs : I fee no token of the Devil in ithis Ap-\nparition 5 except it be his extraordinary Civility\nthat he would not interrupt her Game.\nSECONDLT^ It could not be the Devil^\nbecaufe of his bidding the Lady prepare for Deaih >\nwhich,\n\fi88 The Hijlory and Reality\nwhich, as I have often obferv'd, does not feem to be\nmuch of Satan's Bufinefs, not being very fuitable\nto his Difpofition, and lefs to his Defign.\nThere is fome little Incongruity in this Story\ntoo, which renders it inconfiftent, not with the De-\n<vil only, but even with the Nature of a Spirit or\nApparition: As (i) Why fhould the Apparition come\nwhen the Lady was engag'd and could not fpeak\nto her ? as if flie, being a Ghoft or Spirit as we\nvulgarly exprefs it, did not know what ilie\nwas doing, as well as where fhe was? (2,) How docs\nher taking ill the living Lady's notvifiting her, ob-\nlige her to come and give her this kind Notice of\nher Death ?j \/ took it fa ill at your Hands^ that 1\ncould not refi ^till I hadfeen you.\nTho' this does not ihock my Belief of the\nApparition it felf 5 yet it feems to hint that the\nfeveral Hands thro' which the Relation has pafs'd,\nhave made up the Speech for the Ghoft, and com-\nmitted fome Blunders in it,that are indeed fliocking\nto the Reader.\nI T feems more rational to be as I have read the\nStory, that the Ghoft fhould fay thus : 'I'ho' I took\nit 'very ill at your Hands that you wou'd not come to \\\nfee me-y yet I could not reft 'till I had feenyou^ to^\ntell you that you have not long to live^ and that you\nJhould prepare^ 6cc. This is much better Senfe, and\nmore agreeable to the Nature of the thing j for\ncertainly coming in that manner to give the Lady\nNotice of the Approach of her End, and tocoun-\nfel her to prepare accordingly^ muft be allow'd to be\nan a6t of Kindnefs, not of Refentment, and a Te-\nftimony of the AfFeftion that was between them 5 and\ntherefore her taking it ill that fhe had not been to\nVifit her in her lllncfs, could not rationally be\ngiven as a Reafon for it.\nBut as to the Apparition it felf, fince it could\nnot be the Soul of the deceas'd Lady, and for the\nReafons\n\fof APPARITIO NS. i8<?\nReafons above was not likely to be the Devil^ or I\nmay venture to fay pofitively was not the Devil ^\nWhat then was it ? 1 anfvver with a Queftion :\nWhat could it be but a good Angel, or Angelic\nSpirit from the Invifible World, lent with a Mef-\nfage of Goodnefs, and a merciful Notice of her\nApproaching Death j that {he might receive a due\ncaution, preparing her Mind and turning her\nThoughts to a proper Meditation upon fo ferious a\nSLibjed y in a word, warning her of Death that ftie\nmight prepare for it ?\nThe Story of Sir John Burroughs^s Son, who\nforfaking a Miftrefs in Italy flie murther'd her felf,\nand then haunted him as long as he liv*d, this is\nof like kind with the reft > and tho' the Devil to\nworry and perplex him might take up the Appea-\nrance of his Whore, as well reproaching him with\nthe Crime, as with her Tragical Endj yet it goes\nno farther than this, that the Devil may appear, and\nmay harrafs and terrify thofe he appear'd to, and\nthis I make no doubt of j and it rather adds to\nwhat is infifted on, I mean the Reality of Appari-\ntions \u2022, but the Devil gave this Gentleman no good\nadvice to repent,or prepare, and the like 5 but only\nappear'd, frighted, and terrify'd him to the very\nDay of his Death.\nI T is alfo remarkable, that tho' this Devil in\nApparition fhewed it felf to him the very Day of\nhis Death, (for he was kill'd that Day in a Duel)\nyet it faid not a word to him of what was to befall\nhim, or of what he was going to do, and 'tis very\nprobable did not know it.\nThere is another Story fomething but darkly\nrecorded of Charles VII. of France^ which feems\nlikely enough to be an Apparition of the Devil.\nThat King had been diftemper'd and very ill two or\nthree times, but was recover'd again tolerably well,\n\u00bbnd was riding for the Benefit of the Air in the\nForeft-\n\fipo The Hifiory and Reality\nForcfl of Mans : On a fudden a Spedre ftarts up 01\nout of the Woodsj being a tall meagre ill-look'c\nold Man, of ghaftly Countenance and half naked,\nand coming diredly to the King takes hold of hi:\nHorfe's Bridle, and fays, Stop^ King: Whether go you \\\nyou are hetrafd : and then immediateiy vanifhed\nNow firft of all, this was a falihood in Faft, fo]\nthe King was not betray'd by any body 5 neithe\n\"was there any Plot againfl him, or againfl: any thai\nbelong'd to him, ever heard of before, or after\nwards j on the contrary. Secondly^ his Reign wait\nat that time peaceable and quiet, his Subje6ts al\neafyj and for his Perfon, he hadfo^few Enemies tha\nhe was call'd Charles the Beloved^ and was exceed-\ningly tendred by the generality of his People.\nA GOOD Spirit, an Angelic Spirit, one of th<\nSacred Guard I have fuppos'd to be placed abou\nthis Earth, or in the Regions adjacent, and em-\nployed by their Bountiful Maker for the good o\nMankind, would never \\\nhave come in fuch a man-\nner, furprifing, and at unawares. It would nevcii\nhave put on a fierce and frightful Countenance.\nthus to have terrified a poor diftemper'd Prince\nwhofe Brain was already diforder'd 5 taking the ad-\nvantage of his Weaknefs, and fo to encreafe th(\nFrenzy and Diftradion of his Mind even to hij\nDeftru6bion, for he never more perfectly rccover^c\nhis Senfes.\nThis mightily differ'd from the Condu6b of the\nfeveral Spirits appearing in the Examples mention'c\nbefore, and who kindly warn'd the Perfons of Dan-\nger, foretold Events that they might avoid them,\nor prepare for the Confequencesj in a word, this\nwas an Apparition purely Devilijh^^ox it wasmeerlj\nto do Evil, and to the ruin of the Perfon to whoi\nit appear'd.\n1 THINK nothing can be a jufler Rule for us toi\ndidinguifli Apparitions by : the Evil Spirit, Devi\\\nlike,\n\fof APPARITIONS. ipi\nlike, comes to deceive, he is the Father of Lyes;\nand comes to do hurt, he is a Lover and the Au-\nthor of Mifchief. The good Spirit is from God, the\nFountain of all Good, and appears always for good\nand merciful Purpofes j and this I think is a juit\nObfervation, and a Rule for us to judge of the Na-\nture of whatever Apparitions we hear of.\nCHAP. X.\nOf the different Nattire of Apparitions ;\nhow we Jhould behave to them ; when to\nbe afraid of or concerned about them^ and\nwhen not,\nDANGER maybe the Reafon of Caution;\nbut Guilt only is the reafon of Fear. Caution\nis the Mind's juft Regard to the Evil in view> but\nFear is a Horror of the Soul, in apprehcnfion of\nfome farther Evil yet out of view ; unfeen, and\ntherefore terrible 5 merited, and therefore dreadful.\nIf there were no Guilt in the Mind, Death it\nfelf would be no Evil, and therefore not the Sub-\nje6t of our Fearj nor is Death it felf our Fear now\nas it is in it felf a meer pafHng out of life, otherwife\nthan as it is an inlet of (brae terrible State beyond ic.\nIt is not what v\/e pafs out of, that is the bitternefs,\nbut what we pafs into 5 not what we part with, but\nwhat the Exchange will be 5 not the leap out of\nLight, but the leap into the Dark : and to come\nnearer to it, the Thought of what is beyond Death\nis only made better or worfe by what we know\non this fide of it \\ the Dread of what is to come, is\nfounded on our confcious fenfe of what is paft.\nThis State beyond Death is made our Terror,\nas we expeCt in it the Punifliment of Offences, a\nRetri-\n\fip2 The Hijlory and Reality\nRetrbitution for an ill-fpent Life, and as we have\nupon our Minds a Senfe of Guilt 5 that is to fay, a\nConfcience of having ill-fpent our paft time, and\ndreading the Juftice of the Superior Hand, in whom\nis the Power of Rewards and Puniihments. Now\nto bring it to the cafe in Hand.\nAll. Apparition is look'd upon as a fomething\ncoming, or fent tous,from that State o^ Beingwhich\nis beyond Death, and therefore is look'd upon with\nthe fame Terror and Fright, which we are feiz'd\nwith at the Thoughts of Death it felf\nHence, if we could confider calmly the Nature\nof the Apparition which we fee, we might pre-\nfcntly know whether we had reafon to be terrified\nat the Apparition,^^^^ or no: If the Apparition comes\nwith a MefTage of Peace, if it reprehends with\nKindnefs and Tendernefs, if it admoniihes with Gen-\ntlenefs, and gives Advice to amend and reform, it\ncertainly comes from a good Hand, and we need be\nunder no concern at all about it, becaufc it has no\nEvil in it felf.\nI F it come in all its threatning Poftures, ghaftly\nas the Devil can make it, horrible as himfelf in Per-\n^n 5 yet were there no Guilt there would be no\nfear from the Apparition, or even from the Devil ap-\npearing in Perfon j becaufe we fhould know our\nfelves to be out of his Power.\nAs then the Good or Evil of the Meflage,\nwhich the Apparition brings, diftinguifhes the Ap-\nparition it felf, and tells us of what kind it is 5 fo\nas our Minds are, or are not intimidated by our own\nGuilt, fo we have or' have not reafon to be fur-\npriz'd at the Appearance of a Meflengerjor Meflen-\ngers, from the inviQble World, or at whatever he\niball fay.\nHie murus aheneus eflo^\nNil eonfcirefibi mlh pakfcsre culpa.\nMr.\n\fof d??

That\n\fef AP PARITIO NS, ipj^\n1. That where the Devil appears, he always\niocs it like a Devil^ for fome wicked Purpofc or\n)ther.\n2. Where he cannot prevail and excite to do\nVlifchief, he aflaults with Rage, and threatens\nivith fuffering Mifchief.\nThe good Spirits or good Angels are quite of\nmother Kind j and as they come, or are fent from\n)ther Hands, fo they come of other Errands and\nn another manner, as I ihall give a more parti-\n:ular Account of prefently.\nBut let us from hence enquire into an Opini-\nDn which I have met with, and that of fome Men\n3f Learning and Judgment, viz. That take the\n\/apparitions in general, whether of good or bad\nSpirits, they never, or very rarely, do any harm.\nAs for the good Spirits, we know, as above, they\nwill do none} and if the bad do not, 'tis be\u00bb\ncaufe they can't.\nThe good Spirits, 'tis certain, will do no\nharm} it is by their general appearing for good,\nthat we determine them to be good Spirits} and that\nkind of Judgment is certainly very juft: but if\nthe evil Spirits, which do appear, do no harm\nneither, it is becaufe they are under fome extraor-\ndinary reftraint of Divine Power} fo that tho' they\nmay come about in the Air, they are not fuffer'd\nto do any confiderable Mifchief in the World. In\nboth which cafes all the Occafion of our Terror\nabout them is taken away} for whether they are\ngood Spirits, or evil Spirits reftrain'd, 'tis much\nthe fame } one will do you no hurt, and the other\ncannot} and there remains no room then for the\nPannick, which is fo much upon us, when we\nhear of them.\nIt is true that Angels have fometimes been\nfent in Judgment from Heaven, and have execu-\nted God's terrible Threatmngs upon Men in an\nO 4 apparent\n\f20\np\n-The Hifiory and Reality\napparent Shape 5 as the Angel call'd the Dcflroy-\ning Angel, which David faw in the Air, with his\nSword drawn and ftretch'd over JerufaJem to de-\nflroy it, I Chron. xxi. if. So the Angel of the Lord\nthat flew 1800CO of the Ajfyrians in one Night j\nand it is not improbable that an Hod of Angels\nor Apparitions appeared in the AJfyrian Camp, and\ncut in Pieces the ^\/^n^;? Army, with a Terror that\nthey were not able to refill.\nThese are extraordinary and miraculous Cafes j\nfo likewife is that when the Angel appeared to\nBalaam with a flaming Sword, and told him that\nif the Afs had not turn'd away from him, he (the\nAngel) had flain him, Numb. xxii. 33. But we\nare not now fpeaking of Angels fent out with\nefpecial Comjniflions to execute God's Vengeance,\nbut of the Apparition of good Spirits or Angels\nfrom the invifible World of Spirits, who frequent-\nly appear, and fometimes upon fmall and very tri^\nfling Occafions, and who vifit People as well by\nNight as by Day> this we call Walking, and Ap-\nparition, and this is fuch as is the Subje6t of our\nprefent Enquiry.\nOf thefe it is that I fay, hov\/ever they may\ndifturb us, and however terrified we are about\nthem, I hey very rarely do any harm.\nI HAVE heard of an Apparition which came to\na Farmer in Surry^ and threatned him that he\nwould burn his Houfe and his Barn, and all his\nCorn and Hay j what his Pretences were the Story\ndoes not relate, or what the poor Farmer had done\nto difoblige him 5 but the Man was, it feems,\nin the utmofl Confternation, and expoflulated\nwith the Apparition a great while > but at laft he\npluck'd up his Spirits, and fpoke with a little more\nCourage to it.\nWhat art thou, fays he, that threatneft mc\nthus without a caufe, and fayefl thou wilt ruin me,\nnotwith-\n\fof APPARITIONS. zot\nnotwithftanding I never did thee any wrong? thou\nihouldft be the Devilry thy ufage of me, for good\nSpirits never do any Injuftice.\nTo this the Devil anfvver'd in a long, and to\nappearance, a threatning Speech, but in a Language\nthe poor Man did not underftand one Word of.\nJ KNOW not what thou fayeft, fays the Farmer^\nbut I tell thee again thou feem'fl: to me to be the\nDevil^ or one of his Angels, and I fuppofe thofe\nare Words underftood in the bottomlefs Pitj but\nthreaten me no more with thy Rage, and with\nburning my Houfe and Corn 5 thou art a greatDra-\ngon indeed, but thou art chained, and canft do no-\n'\nthing but what thou art permitted to do by thy\nMaker, and I fear thee not. Upon which the poor\nMan pray'd Mentally that he might be deliver'd\nfrom the Power of the Devil, and away run the\nSpe6l:re, and did him no harm.\nThis was certainly a commendable Courage,\nand had fomething of the Chriftian in it too j and\nfuch a Courage, and upon the like Foundation,\nwould, for ought I know, lay all the Devils that\never walk'd, and drive away all the Apparitions\nand Spirits that People are fo terribly haunted with,\nand fo terrify'd about.\nCHAP. XI.\nOf Apparitions in T)ream, and how far they\nare or are not real Apparitions,\nTHERE may be Dreams without Apparition,\nas there may be Apparitions without Dreams j\nbut Apparition in Dream may be as really an\nApparition as if the Perfon who faw it was awake:\nThe difference may be here, that the Apparition\nin\n\fxot *The Hiflory and ReaUty\nin a Dream is vifible to the Soul only, for the\nSoul never fleeps j and an Apparition to the Eye-\nfight is vifible in common Perfpe6live.\nHow is it then that we fee in our Dreams the\nvery Faces and Drefs of the Perfon we dream of5\nnay, hear their Voices, and receive due ImprefSons\nfrom what they fay, and oftentimes fpeak to them\nwith our own Voices articulately and audibly, tho'\nwe are fall afleep ? What fecret Power of the Imagi-\nnation is able to reprefent the Image of any Per-\nfon to itfelf, if there was not fome Appearance,\nfomething plac'd in the Soul's view, by a fecret,\nbut invifiblc Hand, and in an imperceptible man-\nner? which Something is in all Refpefts, and to all\nPurpofes, as compleatly an Apparition, as if it was\nplac'd in open fight when the Perfon was awake.\nThe Scripture confirms this Opinion by many\nExpreffions direftly to the purpofe, and particu-\nlarly this of Appearing, or Apparition in Dream,\nGen. XX. 3. God came to Abimelech i;^ a Dream*,\nhad it been faid that Ahimelech dream'd that God\ncame to him, there might have been fome excep-\ntion to the Parallel j but God a6tually came to him\n:\nand what tho'.^\/^\/;\u00bb^\/^J^ was afleep, and in a Dream,\nit was not the lefs an Apparition, for God came\nto him, and fpoke, and faid to him: and in the 4th\nVcrfe Ahimelech fpoke to the Apparition. What-\never the Shape was, that the Text does not men-\ntion 5 but Ahimelech knew who he talk'd with too,\nthat's evident, for the Text mentions it fully,\nAnd he faid. Lord, 'wilt thou flay alfo a righteous,\nNation ? and fo he goes on, Verfe the fifth, to\nexpoftulate and plead for himfelf and his People,\njfaid he not unto me^ flje is my Sifler? fo that he'\nknew he was fpeaking to the Lord. The Text is\nvery remarkable, it is plain that there was an Ap-?\nparition, hue the Man was afleep and in a Dream.\nAgajn\n\fof APPARITIONS, 205\nAgain in the cafe o{ Laban purfuing Jacoh^\nGen. xxxi. 24. God came to Laban the Syrian in a\nDream by Nighty and[aid unto him. Here again is an\nApparition, and a fpeaking Apparition too 5 God\ncame to him, and God fpoke to him 5 and Laban\nowns, not that he dream'd of God's appearing,\nbut that God really fpoke to him, 'u. 19. the God,\nof your Father fpake to me Tefter-night^ Joying-\nCertainly Dreams in thofe Days were ano- <\nther kind of thing than they are now. God fpoke\nto them, and they anfwer'd 5 and when they were\nawake tjficy knew that it was God that fpoke, and\ngave heed to the Vifion or Apparition of God to\nthem.\nThere are many more Inftanccs of the like in\nthe facrcd Hiftory^ as firft in the remarkable cafe\nof King Solomon^ i Kings iii. f. 'The Lord appeared\nto Solomon in a Dream by Nighty and God faid^\nask what IJhall give thee.\nThis is call'd in the Scripture a Dream, v, if.\nand Solomon awoke^ and behold it was a Dream > and\nyet it is all confirmed 5 and the Petition that So^\nlomon made, tho' in his Sleep, or Dream, is ac-\ncepted and anfwer'd as his real A\u00a3t and Deed, as\nif he had been awake. A good hint, by the way^\nthat we may both pleafe and offend in our Dreams,\nas really as if we were awake 5 but that is a hint,\nI fay, by itfelf.\nThat PafTagc of Solomon is very remarkable to\nthe cafe in hand. If my Readers pleafe to believe\nthat there was fuch a Man as Solomon^ and that he\nhad fuch a Dream > they muft allow alfo that it\nwas a real Apparition, God appeared to him in a\nDream.\nTo bring it down a flep lower: as God has thus\nPerfonally appeared to Men in Dreams, fo have\ninferior Spirits, and we have Examples of this too\nin the Scripture. Matt, \\. 20. While he thought on\nthefe\n\f204 ^^^ Hifiory and Reality\nihefe Things^ behold the Angel of the Lord appeared\nunto him in a Dream: and again, Matt, ii. 13.\nBehold the Angel of the Lord appeared unto Jofeph in\na Dream^ f'^y'^^g'-\n^^^ ^ third time 'tis repeated, the\nAngel came again to him in jEgypt^ v. ip. of\nthe fame Chapter J when Herod was dead, Behold\nan Angel of the Lord appeareth in a Dream to Jofeph\nin iEgypt.\nI w I L L for once fuppofe, that no Man need de-\niirc any farther Evidence than thefe for the Reality\nof the thing it felf > we may bring it down from\nhence by juft Parallels to Matters within our own\nReach, Experience will furniih us with particular\nPafTages fufficient j and fome Account I fhall give you\nwithin the Corapafs of our own Times > in which if I\ndoasmuch aspoffible, as I have done all along, omit\nall thofe Accounts which others have publifh'd, re-\nfering you to thofe Publications for the particulars,\nand only give you new and more modern Accounts,\nfuch as come within the Verge of my own Know-\nledge, or of the Knowledge of fuch as I have good\nReafon to give Credit to 5 1 believe the Variety\nwill be as acceptable, and much more ufeful than a\nbare Repeating of what others have faid. If I find it\n.\nneedful to quote what others have publiih'd, you\nfliall have it juftly mark'd as a Quotation, that you\nmay fearch for the Truth in its Original.\nBut before I come to Quotation, or to Col-\nlection of Story, 'tis needful to obferve here alfo,\nthat as it has pleas'd God to appear in this Man-\nner, and to caufe Angels to appear alfo in the fame\nManner, and upon fpecial Occafions, fo I make no\nQueflion but the Devil often appears in Dreams\ntoo \u2022, and I might give but too many Examples of\nit, as particularly one in the Scripture.\nI T is apparent that God gave Satan a kind of\ngeneral Liccnfe to atHi\u00a3b Job^ only not to kill him ;\nwith fuch a ternble Commillion it might be ex-\npcftcd\n\fof APPARITIONS. 205-\npefted the De'vil would fall upon him with the ut*\nmofl Fury he was capable of, or at leaft that he was\nallow'd to take 5 he ruin'd his Fortunes, reduced\nhim to Mifery, murther'd his Children, tormented\nhim with Boils and Sores j in fhort, left him no-\nthing but Potfherds, and an ill Wife to relieve him j\nand as he had worry'd him, to ufe a modern Phrafe,\nwithin an Inch of his Life^ he foliowM him in the\nNight with Apparition, left he ihould recruit Na-\nture with Reft, and be a little refrefh'd with Sleep.\nJob himfelf complains of it, Job vii. 14. I'houfearefi\nme with D r e a m s, andterrifleft me with Visions.\nNot that God appear'd to Job in any frightful or\nterrible Form 5 but the Devil^ to whom God was\npleas'd to give a Liberty of afflifting Job^ took that\nLiberty, and exerted his Malice to the utmoft in\nfuch a Manner. We are not indeed told whac\nMethods the Devil took to fcare and terrifie that\npoor diftrefs'd Sufferer 5 but as he can fhow us no-\nthing uglier, and more frightful than himfelf, fo\nit is very likely he appear'd to him in Pcrfon,\nand that in the moft furprizing Manner pollible,\nwith all the Circumftances of Horror that he was\nable.\n'Tis thought by fome, who critically note that\nPart of the Text where Pilate's Wife warn'd her\nHusband to have nothing to do in condemning\nChrift to be crucified, that it was the Devil thac\nilirr'd her up to oppofe it. Satan^ as foon as he\nperceiv'd that the Death of Chrift, however inten-\nded for Mifchief by the Jews^ and purfued violently\nby them in their Rage and Malice at our Lord per-\nfonally, was yet a thing appointed by the determi-\nnate Council of God, for the Salvation of Man-\nkind : I fay, as foon as he perceiv'd that Part,\nwhich 'tis probable he did not know before, heftrove\nall he could to prevent it 5 and as fierce as he had\nbeen to irritate the Jews before, and raife their\nFurv\n\f20\n6\n75&^ Hijlory and Reality\nFury and Malice up to a Pitch, even to almoft ral>-\nballing the Governor into itj now he under- handj\nItrpve to prevent it, and us'd this Stratagem amon^\nothers by attacking P\/7^\/^'s Wife in the Night, an^\nfetting her to perfuade her Husband, that he ws\ngoing to deliver up an innocent Perfon to grati fie th(\nJews i and that he fhould have a care what he did\nMatt, xxvii. ip. ^hen he^ was fet down on the Judg^\nment'feat^ his JVife fent unto htm^ faying^ Have thouk\nnothing to do with that juft Man : For I have fuffer\nmany things this Day in a Dream^ hecaufe of him.\nWhether it was fo or not, 'tis very probable\nthe many things fhe fufFer'd muft be from the\nDevil 'y\nbecaufe Heaven, by whofe determinate\nCouncil and Fore-knowledge the Death of Chrif\nwas appointed, would have done nothing to have\nprevented or interrupted his own Appointment.\nNow as the Dreams in thofe Days, and our\nDreams at this Time, are exceeding different > anc\nthat as our Heads are fo full of impertinent\nThoughts in the Day, which in proportion crowc\nthe Imagination at Night, fo our Dreams are tri-\nfling and foolifli : How fhall we do to know when\nthey are to be taken Notice of, and when not?\nWhen there is a real Apparition haunting us, or\nihowing it felf, to us and when not ? in a word,\nwhen an Angel, or when a Devil^ appears to us in a\nDream ?\nI T is a nice Queftion, and as it docs not parti-\ncularly relate to the prefent Enquiry, fo it wouk\nrequire too long a Digreffion to difcourfe Critically\nupon it \u2022, but I (hall difmifs it with this fhort An-\nfwer.

Whether, fuppofing the Cafe to be littc-\nrally true, was this an Apparition, or was it on-\nly a fimple Dream ? I affirm it muft be an Appari-\ntion, that is to fay, a Spirit came to him in the\nPerfon of, or perfonating his Wife.\nThe following Story I had from the Mouth of\nthe very Perfon who was chiefly concerned in it, I\nmean the Captain of the Ship itfelf.\nOne Captain Thomas Rogers^ Commander of a\nShip called the Society^ was bound on a Voyage\nfrom London to Virginia about the Year 169\\.\nThe Ship was hired in London^ and being fent\nlight, as they call it, to Virginia for a Loading of\nTobacco, had not many Goods in her outward bound,\nfuppofe about two or three a hundred Ton, which\nwas not counted a Loading, or indeed half her\nP 2 Load^\n\f'ti4 7\/&<? tiiftory and Reality\nLoading 5 the Ship being very large, above five\nhundred Ton Burthen.\nThey had had a pretty good Parage, and the\nDay before had had an Obfervation, whereupon\nthe Mates and proper Officers had brought their\nBooks and cafl up their Reckonings with the Cap-\ntain, to fee how near they were to the Coafts of\nAmerica 5 they all agreed that they were at leaft about\nan hundred Leagues Diftance from the Capes of Vir^\n^m^.Upon thcfe curtomary Reckonings, and with-\nall heaving the Lead, and finding no Ground at\nan hundred Fathom, they fet the Watch, and the\nCaptain turn'd in (as they call k at Sea) that is,\nwent to Bed.\nThe Weather was good, a moderate Gale of\nWind, and blowing fair for the Coaft, fo that the\nShip might have run about twelve or fifteen Leagues\nin the Night after the Captain was in his Cab*\nbin.\nH E fell afleep, and flept very foundly for about\nthree Hours, when he waked again, and lay 'till\nhe heard his fecond Mate turn out^ and relieve the\nWatch j and then he call'd his chief Mate as he\nwas going off from the Watch, and ask'd hiitt\nhow ail things far'dj who anfwer'd, that all wa^\nwell, and the Gale frefhen'd, and they run at t\ngreat Rate> but 'twas a fair Wind and a fine clear\nNight 5 fo the Captain went to ficep again.\nAbout an Hour after he had been afleep again^\nhe dream'd that a Man pull'd him or wak'd him,\ndnd he did wake. I am not fure, but I think he\nfaid the Thing that wak'd him bad him get up^\nthat is, turn out and look abroad. But whether it\nwas fo or no, he lay (till and compos'd himfelf to\nilcep, and drop'J again, and fuddenly awak'd again,\nand thus feveral times 5 and tho' he knew nothing\nwhat was the Reafon, yet he found it was impofli*\nble for him to go to fleep, and ftill he heard the\nVifion\n\fof APPAR IT IONS. iij\nVifion fay, or thought he heard it fay, turn out and\nlook abroad,\nH? lay in this Une^finefs near two Hours, but\nat laft it encreas'd fo upon him, that he could lie\nno longer, but gets up, puts on his Watch Gown,\nand comes out upon the Quarter-deck j there he\nfound hisfecond Mate walking about, and theBoat-\nfwainupon the Forecaflle, the Night fine and clear,\na fair Wind, and all well as before.\nThe Mate wondering to fee him, at firft did\nnot know him i but calling, Who's there? the Cap-\ntain anfwer'd, and the Mate returns, Who, the\nCaptain ! what's the matter, Sir ?\nSATS the Captain^ I don't know, but I have\nbeen very uneafie thefe two Hours, and fome body\nor my own Fancy bid me turn out and look abroad,\ntho' I know not what can be the meaning of it.\nThere can be nothing in it, but fome Dream,\nfays the Mate,\nSATS the Captain^ How does the Ship Cape?\nSouth-West by South, fays the Mate j fair\nfor the Coaft, and the Wind Eaft by North.\nT H A t's all very good, fays the Captain j and\nfo, after fome other ufual Qiieftions, he turn'd about\nto go back to his Cabin > .when, as if it had been\nfome body that flood by him had fpoke, it came\ninto his Mind like a Voice, Heave the Lead^ heav9\nthe Lead.\nUpon this he turns again to his fecond Mate,\nMate, fays the Captain^ when did you heave the\nLead? what Water had you?\nAbout an Hour ago, fays the Mate^ fixty Fa-\nthom.\nHeave again, fays the Captain,\nThejie's no manner of Occafion, Siv^fays the\nMate^ but if you pleafe it fhall be done.\nI don't know, fays the Captain,^ 'tis needlefs in-\ndeed, I think \\ and fo was going away again,\nP 4 but\n\fThe Hifiory dnd Reality\nbut was, as it were, forc'd to turn back as before,\nand fays to the Mate, I know not what ails me,\nbut I can't be eafie 5 come call a Hand aft, and\nheave the Lead.\nAccordingly a Hand was called, and the\nLead being caft or heaved, as they call it, they\nhad Ground at eleven Fathom,\nThis furpriz'd them all, but much more when\nat the next Caft it came up feven Fathom.\nUpon this the Captain in a Fright bad them\nput the Helm a Lee, and about Ship, all Hands being\norder'd to back the Sails, as is ufual in fuch Cafes.\nThe proper Orders being obeyed, the Ship\nftay'd prefently and came about j and when fbe was\nabout, before the Sails fiU'd, ihe had but four Fa-\nthoms and a half Water under her Stern 5 as foon as\nfhe filled and flood off, they had feven Fathom again,\nand at the next Caft eleven Fathom, and fo on to\ntwenty Fathom 5 fo he ftood off to Seaward all the\nreftof the Watch, to get into deep Water, 'till Day-\nbreak J when being a clear Morning, there were\nthe Capes of Virginia and all the Coaft of America,\nin fair View under their Stern, and but a very\nfew Leagues Diftance ; Had they ftood on but\none Cable's length farther, as they were going,\nthey had been Bump a-jhore (fo the Sailors call it)\nand had certainly loft their Ship, if not their\nLives.\nNow, what could this be? Not the Devil^ that\nwe may vouch for him, he would hardly be guil-\nty of doing fo much good 5 hardly an Angel fent\nfrom Heaven Exprefs, that we dare not prefumej\nbut that it was the Work of a waking Providence, by\nfome invifible Agent employ'd for that Occafion,\nwho took Sleep from the Captain's Eyes > as once\nin a Cafe of infinitely more Importance was done\nto King Ahafuerus-y This we may conclude. Had\n%\\i^ Captain il^pt as ufual, and as Nature requir'd,\nthey\n\fof APPARITIONS. 7.17\nthey had been all loft 5 the Shore being flat at a\ngreat Diftance, and, as 1 fuppofe, the Tide low, the\nShip had been a-ground in an Inftant, and the Sea,\nwhich run high, would have broke over her, and\nfoon have dafh'd her in Pieces.\nHow it happen'd that the Mates and other\nNavigators on Board (for it being a very great\nShip, they had fcveral experienc'd Men among them)\n(hould all of them have kept, and yet all be out in\ntheir Reckoning, and that fo much as to think them-\nfelves an hundred Leagues from the Coaft, when\nthey were not above twenty or twenty five, that\nwas to be accounted for among themfelves j but cer-\ntain it was, if it had not been for thus being\nwak'd and jogg'd in the Night, and kept awake\ntoo in fpite of his own Drowfinefs, the Captain\nhad lain ftill, and the whole Ship's Company been\nin the utmoft Hazard.\nI F this was not an Apparition, it muft be what\nthe Scripture calls it in another Cafe, being warned\nof God in a Dr$am j which by the way is the fame\nthing > but here was fomething more than being\nwarned, for the Captain own'd he ivas in no Dream.\nHe dream'd nothing at all, much lefs any thing\nof Danger 5 he went to his Bed or Cabbin with\nall the prudent Caution that any Man in that im-\nportant Truft of a Ship in the Ocean could do ;\nand then after having made their Calculations, caft up\ntheir Reckonings, fet their Watch, and made every\nthing fure, he laid down with all the Satisfa6tion\nthat it was poffible for any Man in a like Cafe to\nhave.\nT o any Men that underftand the Sea AfFairs,\nthis Cafe will be more feelingly and fenfibly read;\nthey will be more touch'd with the Surprize\nthe Ship's Company muft be all in, to fee them-\nfelves juft running a-ground, when they believed\nthemfelves an hundred Leagues from the Shore, to\nfind\n\fz I\nS\nThe Hifiory and Reality\nfind thcmfelves within two Inches of Death, when\nthey believed themfelves as fafe ai a Ship at Sea\n^ith a moderate Gale and a fair Wind could be\niuppofed to be.\nAnd how will thofe modern Wits, of which our\nAge is fo full, account for this, who allow no God\nor Providence, no invifible World, no Angelick,\nkind and waking Spirits, who, by a fecret Corre-\nfpondence with our embodied Spirits, give merci-\nful Hints to us of approaching Mifchiefs and im-\npending Dangers, and that timely, fo as to put the\nMeans into our Hands to avoid and efcape them ?\nWhich wa,y will fuch Men folve the main\nDifficulty in fuch a Cafe as this, viz. What this\nfhould be? Will they refolve it all into fortuitous\nChance, meer Accident, ameer Circulation of things\nin the ordinary Courfc ? As they fay Shoals are raifed\nto bar up a Haven, which they tell us, is nothing but\ntheSand and Stones driven down the Streamof a Ri-\nver, which lodge here or there, as their own Weight,\nor the abating Force of the Water, or this or that\nEddy and Countcr-llream checks them, fo deep'ning\none Channel where it was Shoal, and choaking up\nanother where it was deep, and all by meer Acci-\ndent: But this is very grofs arguing.\nI T were eafie to confute thefe weak pretences\nto Chance and Incident, and to {how the neceffity\nof an intelligent Being 5 but that is not my work :\nI am not upon the Reality of fuch an intelligent Be-\ning, but the Reality of its ordinary and extraordina-\nry aftings, the Agents it employs, and the manner\nof their executing the Commiflions they receive j\nwhich 'tis evident they faithfully perform, and\ncfFedlually too j fometimes by one method, fome-\ntimes by another, and particularly by this of Ap-\nparition, as well to the Ey\u20acs of the Soul, as to the\nEye of the Body, deeping or waking 'tis the\nferae.\nOur\n\fof APPARITION S. 2i5>\nO tj R Friends the Criticks may Humble here,\nperhaps5at the Teeming contradiflion in the Terms,\nas particularly this of invifible Apparition. Buc\n*ds eafily folv'd, by anfwering that it is but a feem-\ning Contradi6lion5 for both the Apparitions are vi-\nfible, only not to the fame Optick Powers 5 the Ap-\nparition in Dream is vifible to the intelle6i:ual fight,\nto the Eye of the Soul 5 and the Day-light Appari-\ntion is vifible to the common ordinary fight : and\nyou have an Expreflion in the Scripture often made\nufe of, which gives an unqucftion'd Authority for\nthis way of fpeaking.\n'\nThe expreffing things dream'd of, as things\nieen, is very frequent in the Sacred Text. Jacob\ndream'd a Dream about Laban's Cattle, Gen. xxxi.\nto. where 'tis thus exprefled, and I faw in a\nDream. Again DanieL vii. i, 2,. Daniel had a Dream\nand Vifions of his Head upon his Bed, v. 2.\nand I [aw in my Vifion by Night : v. 7. after this I\nfaw in tbe Night Vifions^ and behold a fourth Beaft :\nand V. I ^. Ifaw in the Night Vifions^and behold -y and\nbefides this, we have the fame way of fpeaking ten\nor eleven times in the fame Chapter, and as many\nor more times in the next.\n'Tis the like in relating the Dreams o^ Pharaoh\nand of Nebuchadnezzar^ or the Apparitions rather\nwhich appeared to thofe Kings in Dream. Pharaoh\nfays to Jofeph^ Gen. xli. 17, 18, 19.

So\nthat an Apparition in Dream is vifible to the Soul,\nthe Imagination kts^ tho' the Eyes of the Body arc\nclos'd.\nThis Digrefiion is owing to the nice Judgment\nof our Criticks, whofe exa6fcnefs you fee I mightily\nreverence, and am wonderful careful not to fall un-\nder\n\f2 20 The Hifiory and Reality\nder their dreadful Hands, in a thing fo eOential to\nmy Subjeft 5 as for Trifles, I leave them to trifle with\nthem to the utmoft oftheir more maliciouslmpotence.\nBut I come now to another Relation of Fa6tj\nwhich alfo I take upon me to vouch the Reality o^\nhaving been prefenc at the very inftant of cverjij\npart of it.\nA Person, whofc Name it is not fo proper tew\nmention here, but who may be produc'd if there\nihould be occafion, being ftill living, was under the\ndi^ifter, about the Year 1701, to fall under a Party\nCenfurc, (the occafion is needlefs to the prefent\nCafe.) In hopes, upon the Recefs of the Houfe, which\nwas not far off^, he fliould (as is ufual ) be at Liberty,*\nhe withdrew himfelf, and avoided being taken up as\nmuch as he could 5 but the Houfe refenting it, a\nVote was paft, ordering the Secretary of State to\nprofecute him at Law j which oblig'd him to refolve\nto leave the Kingdom, and in the mean time tO'\nconceal himfelf with more exaftnefs j the Govern-\nment having iflued out a Proclamation for appre-\nhending him, with a Reward to the Perfon who\nfliould difcover where he was, fo as he might be\ntaken.\nI N order to conceal himfelf more effeftually, he\nleft his Lodging where he had been hid for fome\ntime, and remov'd to Barnet on the Edge of Hert-\nford\/hire y intending, as foon as he had fettled fome\nFamily Affairs, to go away North into Scotland\nBut before he went away he was oblig'd to come\nonce more to London^ to fign fome Writings for\nthe fecuring fome Eltatc, Which it was fear'd might\nbe feiz'd by Out-law, if the Profecutio*ii had gone\non fo far.\nThe Night before he had appointed to come to\nJLondon^ as above^being in Bed with one Mr.i^^\nD he dream'd that he was in his Lodgings ac\nLondon^ where he had been concGal'd as above, and\niD\n\fof APPARITIO NS. 2ZI\nin his Dream he faw two Men come to the Door,\nwho faid they ^tvt Mejfengers^ and produc'd a War-\nrant froni the Secretary of State to apprehend him,\nand that accordingly they feiz'd upon and took\nhim.\nThe Vifion furpriz'd and wak'd him, and he\nwaked Mr. D his Brother-in-law, who was in\nBed with him, and told him the Dream, and what\na Surprize he was in about it.

The very Day they took Horfe to\ngo down, but fome Hours after they were gone,\na Letter came in to the elder Brother's Houfe from\ntheir Father 5 the Contents of which I ihall take\nNotice of prefently.\nAnd firft I am to obferve that when they came\nto their Father they found him at home, and ve-\nry ill, nor had he been from home 5 and was great-\nly concerned for the Safety of his Sons, upon the\nfollowing Occafion.\nThe Night before he wrote the Letter, fpoken\nof above, he was furpriz'd in his Sleep with a\nDream, or rather a Vifion, that his two Sons had\nfallen out about a Mifl:refs> that they had Quar-\nrcird to that degree, that they had challeng'd one\nanother, and were gone out into the Fields to\nfight J but that fome body had given him Notice\nof it, and that he had got up in the Morning by\nfour a Clock to meet and prevent them.\nUpon this Dream he awak'd in great Diforder\nand Terror ; however finding it but a Dream he\nhad compos'd his Mind, and gotten to fleep again:\nbut that he dream'd it again in fo lively a man-\nner, that he was forc'd to call up his Man that\nwaited on him to fit up the red of the Night\nwith him j and he was frighted, and much out of\norder with the Fright.\nThat, in Confequence of this Dream, hchadfent\na Servant up Exprefs, with Orders to ride Night\nand Day, to enquire how his Sons did, and to\nbring him word if there had been any fuch breach\namong them 5 and earneflly to prefs them, if fuch\na breach had been, that they would confent to lee\nhim mediate between them, that it might go no\nfarther 'till he could come up, that fo he might\nput an end to their Refentments, and make Peace\namong\n\fof APPARiriO N S. z^f\namong them, according to his Dreams : and this\nwas the Letter, mention'd above, that came to\nHand in a few Hours after they were fet out.\nIt cannot be doubted but it was very con-\nfounding to his Sons to hear the Account their\nFather gave them of his Dream, or Vifion rather,\nabout their Quarrel ; and it was equally amazing\nto fee it confirmed by all the true Particulars 5 alfo\nthat the old Gentleman, to be fure, had been fo far\nfrom being at London^ that he had fcarce been a\nwhole Day off from his Bed.\nThey conferr'd together ferioufly upon the\nprivate Queftion, (viz.) whether they fhould\ntell their Father the Story of their Quarrel,\nbut efpecially of their feeing him feverally, and\nhis really parting them, or preventing their fight-\ning.\nUpon the whole, they concluded not to let\ntheir Father know of his Likenefs (as theycall'd it)\nappearing to them, left it might difquiet him too\nmuch; and for the reft, as they were perfedly re-\nconcil'd again, they faid there was no manner of\nOccafion to mention it at all 5 fo they only paid\ntheir Compliment as a Vifit of Duty, to fee how\nhe did, and to ask his Bleffingj IVill having told\nthem that he was out of Order : and as for his\nLetter, they could happily tell him they had not\nfeen it.\nAccording to this Refolution they per-\nform'd the Ceremony of Vifiting their Father, and\nmade hafte away again, that they might converfe\nthe more freely about this ftrange Conjun6tion of\nCircumftances, which had in it fo many things\nfurprizing to their Thoughts, and even to their Un-\nderftandings j for they knew not what to make of\nit, nor, indeed, could they refolve it into any thing\nbut this, which is to my purpofe exa6lly, and\nwhich is the reafon of my mentioning the whole\nR ^ Story,\n\fThe Bijiory and Reality\nStory, namely, that here was a double Apparition\nwithin the compafs of our propos'd Syftem.\n1. Here was the Apparition of the living Pei>\nfon of their Father, without his participation in\nthe Aftion 5 his Face- Voice, and, perhaps, Habit\nWas aflum'd, and yet he himfelf knew nothing of\nthe Matter, was not in the ieaft concerned in ir^\nor acquainted with it.\n2. Here was an Apparition to the Father m\nDream j 'twas a plain Vifion, the thing that was\ntrue inFaft was reveal'd to him in his Sleep, which\nis the very Subjeft I am now fpeaking of.

Nay, it confirms the grand Truth which I\nhave infifted on 5 namely, that Souls departed know\nj!ot any thing, and can communicate nothing, tho'\nunembody'd Spirit may.\nFor could the departed Souls ofdeceas'd Relati-\nons have known that their Fathers, or Children,\ncr Brothers, or Relids, (^c, were the next Day to\nbavc been murther'd, can we doubt but they would\nhave given them all the Notice, that it was in\ntheir Power to do, and at leaft have alarm'd them\nio^ as to put them upon their Guard, and give\nthem an Opportunity to die like Hero's, as many\nof them were? and as they did not do thus, Ithinkj\nwithout Injuftice, or Prefumption, we may con-?\nelude they cannot > they could not then, neither\ncan others do the like now.\nAnd yet as to fuch Notices as the Inhabitants\nof the invifible World were allow'd to make, I\nbelieve they were not without them at that time,\niho' it was not thought fit by the Appointment\nof Heaven to have the wicked Rcfolution of Mur-\nther\n\fof APPARITIONS. i6t\nther and Maflacre defeated : as to the Rc.ifons\nwhy, which is what we have nothing to do to\ndifpute, that we leave in Silence, as we may well\ndo.\nThe Hiftories of thofe Times arc full of the\nfecret Warnings and Notices then given by the kind\nApparitions of thofe invifible Agents (whoever they\nare) in Dream.

In the Year \\66t^\nan Apparition meecs one Francis Taverner on the\nHighway *, the Man having Courage to fpeak to it,\nasks it what he is ? and the Apparition tells him\nhe is James Haddock^ and gives him feveral Tokens\nto remember him by, which faverner alfo calling\nto mind owns them j and then boldly demands of\nthe Apparition what bufinefs he had with him 5\nT 2. the\n\fzy6 \"The H'tjlory and Reality\nthe Apparition did not tell his Bufinefs that Night j\nbut would have had \"Taverner YodiC. back his way with\nhim, and he would tell him his Bufinefs, which\n'Tavenier refus'd, as well he mighty and that part\nindeed feems the only improbable part of the\nStory.\nHowever the next Night the Apparition\ncomes to him again, and then tells him the Bufi-\nnefs, which was to defire him to go to his Wife,\nwhofe Maiden Name was Eleanor IVelJh-y but was\nthen marry'd again to one Davis^ which Davis\nwith-held the Leafe from the Orphan, Haddock^ Son,\nand tell her fhe ihould caufe Juflice to be done to\nthe Child.\ntAFERNER neglefted to perform this Er-\nrand, and was fo continually foliow'd by the Ap-\nparition, that it v\/as exceeding terrible to him 5\narid at lafl it threatened to tear him in Peices, if he\ndid not go of his Errand.\nUpon this he goes and delivers the MefTage to.\nthe Woman, who it feems took but fmall Notice\nof it 5 and then the Apparition came again, and\ntold him he mufl go to his Executor, and do the'\nfame Errand 5 which he was it feems afraid to do,\nfor fear of Davis -, but the Apparition threatened\nDavis if he fhould attempt to do him {Ttaverner)\nany Injury.\nN. B. Here I am to Note^ that this Story made\nfo much Noife in the Country^ and the Parti^\nculars appear'd to be fo faithfully related by Ta-.\nverner, that abundance of Perfons of Note\ncame to him to have the Relation from his own\nMouth 'y and among the reft the Lord Bijhop of\nDown and Connor^ who I name in Reverence\nj\nmt to his Dignity only^or fo much^ as in Reve^\nrence of his known Piety and Serioufnefs in Reli^\ngion : Being the fam'd Do5ior Jeremy Taylor,\nAuthor of a known Book caWd Rules of Holy\nLiving and Dying. This\n\fof APPAR ITIO N S. 277\nThis Reverend Father fent for the faid Francis\n^averner^ to examine him about this firange fcene of\nProvidence^ fo the Bifhop call'd \\\\ s and he did\nexamine him ftridtly about it, and the Account\nfays, hisLordfhipwas fully fatisfied, that the Appa-\nrition was true and real 3 that is to fay, that it was\ntrue that there was really fuch an Apparition.\nNow all this is within the Bounds of what I\nhave laid down, viz. That there are really Appa-\nritions, and thefe Apparitions do perfonate fuc!! and\nfuch Bodies or Shapes, whofe Names they take\nupon them, and whofe Perfons they reprefent.\nBut for the reft, I think all the Notions that\nthe People then entertain'd of it, and even the Bi-\nfhop among the reft, muft be very erroneous and ^\nmiftaken. For,\nI. The Biftiop entertain'd the Story, as if this\nApparition was really the Soul of the departed\nJames Haddock^?L^ appearM by a fecond Examination\nof 'faverner by his Lordftiip 5 for the Lady Cm-\nway^ and other Perfons of Quality, hearing the\nBifhop had fent for T^averner to examine him, went\nall away to be prefent at the Examination: And the\nBifhop being gone to a Town caird Hillshro^ three\nMiles off, the Company went all thither, and fa-\nverner was fent for to them, and there examin'd\nof all the Particulars again, and anfwer'd again to\nthe Satisfadion of all the Company.\nBut here (and for this reafon I relate this part)\nhis Lordftiip, after asking many more Queftions,\nconcluded by advifing 'Taverner to ask the Appari-\ntion when it came again, Whence are you, are you\na good or an evil Spirit? by which is fuppos'd his\nLordftiip underftood, Are you in a good or bad\nState 3 for his next Qiieftion was. Where is your\nAbode? what Station do you hold ? how are you\nregimented in the other World? and what is the\nReafon that you appear for the Relief of your Son\nT 3\nin\n\f%y% The Hijiory and Reality\nin fo fmall a Matter, when fo many Widows and\nOrphans are opprefs'd in the World, being de-\nfrauded of greater Matters, and none from thence\n. of their Relations appear to right them ?\nAnd the very fame Night 7'averner meeting\nthe Apparition again, who, it feems, was fully fa-\ntisfy'd with what he had done in delivering the\nMeflage to the Executor; at this Appearing 7'a^\nverner ask'd him the Queftions above, but it gave\nhini^no Anfwer 5 and indeed it could not be ex-\npe61:ed that Cuviofity fhould be anfwered.\nFor, as I faid above, it is evident by the\nQueftions, the Bifliop, in all thefe Examinations,\nfell in wr^h the vulgar Error of the Time about\nfuch apparitions, namely, that it was the Soul of\nJames Haddock -y and well indeed might he ask how\nhe came to Appear, when others in Cafes of\ngreater Moment did not.\nBut he fhould have ask'd. How is it poflible\nyou that are dead fhould be acquainted with thefe\nCircumftances, when the Word of God fays ex-\nprefly the Dead know qot any thing, and that all\ntheir Love and Hatred is perifhed ? Had he ask'd\nhim, that, perhaps he might have told him that he\nwas not the Soul o^James Haddock^ but a good Spiric\nfent from the invifible World by the efpecial direfti-\non of Heaven, to right a poor, ruin'd, opprefs'd\nOrphan, abandon'd to Injury by its own unnatural\nMother. But to talk of the Soul of James Had^\ndock^ and what Station it held in the other World^\nthe Apparition might well go away, and give no\nAnfwer to it.\nNor in any of this Difcourfe did the Appari*\ntion pretend it was not at Reft, or could not be\nat Reft 'till Juftice was done to the Child, or 'till\nthe MeiTage was deliver'd: the Apparition was too\njull to itfelf to fay'fo: and on the other Hand,\n*tis to me one of the moft convincing Proofs, thac\nit\n\fof APPARITIONS. 17^\nit was really an Apparition or Appearance of a\nSpirit.\nNow, as in other Cafes, what Spirit it was may\nbe worth taking Notice of 5 here is not the lead\nroom to fuggcft that it was the Devil^ or an evil\nSpirit i and therefore the Bifhop was wrong in\nthat too, to ask if it was a good or evil SpiHtj for\nhow ihould his Wifdom judge, who was himfelf\na good Man, that an evil Spirit fhould come of 4\ngood Errand, to right an injured Orphan, an op- .\nprefs'd Fatherlefs Child ? the Devil^ or any evil\nSpirit, could hardly be fuppos'd to move about\nfuch Bufinefs.\nI T is to be obferv'd here, and fliould have bcei>\nadded to the Story, that the faid Davis and his\nWife, tho' it fcems much againfl: his Will, did\ngive up the Leafe to the Child, the Soi; of that\nJames Haddock 5 with this difmal Circumftance, at-\ntending it, 1)1%. That about five Years after, and\n-when the Bifliop was dead, one Coftlet^ who was\nthe Child's Truftee, threatned to take away the\nLeafe again, raiPd at I'averner^ and made terrible\nImprecations upon himfelf if he knew of the Leafe,\nand threatned to go to Law with the Orphan.\nBut one Night being drunk at the Town of Hill\"\nHall^ near Lishurne in Ireland^ where all this Scene\nwas laid, going home he fell from his Horfe and\nnever fpoke more, and fo the Child enjoy'd the\nEflate peaceably ever after.\nI N a Word, the little injur'd Orphan feem'd to\nbe the Care of Heaven in a particular manner;\nand the good Angel which appcar'd in its behalf\nwithout doubt executed God's Juftice upon the\nwicked drunken Oppreflbr, the Trufteej and as\nhe imprecated Vengeance on himfelf, fo that fame x\nSpirit might be Commiffion'd to fee it fall upon\nhim.\nT 4 Ano\n\fi8o The Hijlory and Reality\nAnd here it mofl naturally occurs to obfervc\nthat the departed Souls of Men and Women dead\nand buried, cannot be fuppos'd to have any Com-\nmiflion to execute particular Vengeance on any\nin this World j the Suppofition of this would\nbring a^ confus'd medly of Notions upon us, fuch\nas would be inconfillcnt not with Religion only,\nbut even with common Senfej and which need\nnot take up any of our Pains to confute them.\nNothing has more fiU'd the idle Heads of\nthe old Women of thefe latter Ages than the\nStories of Ghofts and Apparitions coming to Peo-\nple, to tell them where Money was hidden, and\nhow to find it j and 'tis wonderful to me that\nfuch Tales fhould make fuch Impreflions, and that\nfometimes among wife and judicious People too,\nas we find they have done. How many old Hou-\nfes have been almoft puU'd down, and Pitts fruit-\nlefly dug in the Earth, at the ridiculous Motion\nof pretended Apparitions? of which I ihall fpeak\nmore in its Place.\nI HAVE hitherto lludioufly avoided giving you\nany Accounts, however extraordinary, that have\nbeen already made publickj but this one, which\nrelates to the Afiaffination of the great Duke of\nBuckingham^ (whether famous or infamous I know\nnot which to determine him) in the time of the\nlate King Charles I, I cannot omit, becaufe the va-\nrious manner of its being related fo eminently\ntouches the Cafe in Hand.\nThat the Duke of Buckingham was flabb'd by\none Lieutenant Felton at Portfmouth^ as he was go-\ning upon an Expedition for the Relief of Rochelle^\nHiftory is fo full of it, and all that know any\nthing of our Englijh Annals are fo well acquainted\n\"with the Story of it, that I need fay nothing to\nintroduce that Part: Mr. Aubrey takes upon him\nto relate the Story of an Apparition upon this Oc-\neafion in the following manner\n;\nTo\n\fof APPARiriO NS. xSi\n\"To one Mr. Towes who had been School-fel-\nlow with Sir George Fillers^ the Father of the\nfirfl Duke of Buckingham^ and was his Friend\nand Neighbour, as he lay in his Bed awake (and\nit was Day-light) came into his Chamber the\nPhantome of his dear Friend Sir George Viller's,\nSaid Mr. I'owes to him, Why, you are dead\n!\nwhat makes you here? Said the Knight, I am\ndead, but cannot reft in Peace, for the Wicked-\nnefs and Abomination of my Son George at Court.\nI do appear to you to tell him of it, and to ad-\nvife and dehort him from! his evil ways. Said\nMr. \"Towes^ The Duke will not believe me, but\nwill fay that I am mad, or doat. Said Sir George\nGo to him from me, and tell him by fuch\na Token (a Mole) that he had in fome fecrec\nPlace, which none but himfelf knew of Accord-\ningly Mr. 'I'o'wes went to the Duke, who laugh'd\nat his Meffage. At his return home, the Phantome\nappeared again, and told that the Duke would\nbe ftabb'd (he drew out a Dagger) a quarter of a\nYear after > which accordingly happened.\nThis Part of the Story indeed is calculated like\na true Chimney-corner Piece of Newsj that Sir\nGeorge, who was dead, ihould fay he could not reft\nin Peace for the Wickednefs and Abomination of\nhis Son George at Court.\nPreposterous ! What State muft old Sir\nGeorge be in? If in a State of Mifery, what does he\nmean by reJI^ing in Peace? if in a State of BlefTednefs,\nwhat could his Son do to impeach his Reft? and i^c\nwe fhall give any weight to what the Scripture\nfays in that Cafe, he knew nothing of him, let his\nown State or his Sow\\ Abominations (jxsht calls them)\nbe what they would. See Job xiv. ip, 20, 21. \"The\nwaters wear the Stones : thou, wafloeft away the things\nwhich grow out of the duft of the earthy and thou de-\nfiroyefi the hop of man, fhou prevaileft for ever againfi\n\fztt The Hifiory and Reality\nMfH^ ^nd he pajfeth : thou changeft his countenance,,\nmdfendeft him away.

How then could Sir George Fillers fay, feveral\nYears after he was dead too, that he could not reft\nin Peace ? What ! had he been at Reft and in Peace,\nand was he difquieted again by his Son George'^s\nWickednefs? that does not hang together at all.\nThe old Knight had been dead feveral Years before\nhis Son George came to rife at Court j when he did\nrife, he was not immediately fo abominably wicked\nas he was afterward : Where then was the Soul of\nSir George the Father, all the while? his Reft could\nnot bedifturb'd 'till the Circutnftanccsthat difturb'd\nit happen'd.\nB u T my Lord Clarendon tells this fame Story,\nwith much more Probability of Truth j for\nfirft he leaves out the Abfurdity, which indeed his\nLordfhip was too wife a Man to impofe upon the\nWorld with the SanSion of his Authority, nor\nwas there Senfe enough^ in it to give it Credit.\nI N the next Place he does not make the Perfon\nto whom Sir George Fillers appear'd, be an Equal,\nand an Intimate Friend, but one that had liv'd in\nthe fame Town where Sir George had liv'd, and had\nnot feen him for many Years, but recollefted him\nfrom the Cloaths he had feen him wearj whereas\nthe Story above makes them dear Friends, which\nif it had been fo, it was not likely he fhould re-^\nfufe to hear the Meflagc, ant yet he fcruples it\nvery much.\nBut\n\fof APPAR iriO NS. 283\nBut there are more difcording Circumftances in\nthe Story.

FJME^ tho'' with form Privacy^ fays^\nthat the fecret ^oken was an incefiuous Breach\nof Modefiy between the Duke and a certain\nLady too nearly related to him^ which it fur*\nprized the Duke to hear of\\ and that as he\nthought he had good Reafon to he fure the\nLady would not tell it of her felf^ fo he thought\nnone but the Devil could tell it beftdes her > and\nthis afionifoed him^ fo that he was very far\nfrom receiving the Man fightly^ or laughing,\nat his Mejfage.\nWhat this Apparition then was, and from\nwhom, or from whence, remairs to be decided. That\nthe thing was real, is too well attefted 5 it comes\nloaded\n\fof APPARITIONS. i8p\nloaded with fo many concurring Circumflances,\nand told in the hearing of fo many Witnefles of\ngood Fame and Credit, that there is no Room\nto quellion the Fad 5 and as to the various Ways\nof relating it, the Truth of the whole is not a-\nbatcd by it at all : only as is natural to things of\nthis Nature which pafs thro' fo many Hands, eve-\nry one exprefling themfelves their own way, tho*\nmeaning the fame things they often vary at iaft in\nthe very Subftance, by only varying at firfl in the\nCircumftances.\nThe Truth of the Matter is at lafl, that the\nApparition foi*etold his Ruin, and it foon follow'd*.\nNow that this Apparition could not be the Devily\nis evident from the Reafons laid down before in\nthe like Cafes. How can we fuppofe the Devil\nwould be offended with the wicked Life and abo-\nminable Pra6tices of the Duke of Buckingham ac\nCourt? His inceftuous Lewdnefs, and whatever o-\nther fcandalous Praftices he allowed himfelf in, the\nDevil might, perhaps, encourage and prompt him\nto, but he would never fend a Meflenger to him\nto warn him againft them, and to alarm him with\nApprehenfions of Danger attending him if he did\nnot reform. This is none of the Devil's Bufinefs,\n'tis quite foreign to him, 'twould be the weakeft\nthing in the World to fugged it of him.\nAgain, if it were any thing immediately from Hea-\nven, it would have been efFedual to have awaken*d\nand reformed him : But as it might be a kind MefTen-\nger from another part of the invifible World, where\nhis approaching Fate was known, and who having\ngiven him this Notice, left his Reformation in his\nown Power, and laid the Neceffity of it before the\nEyes of his Reafon, as well as of his Confcience,\nand that after this his Fall was of himfelfj this\nmakes it all rational, and eafie to be underftood, and\n\u00ab agreeable to the ordinary Cuftom of Providence\nU ia\n\fipo The Hijiory and Reality\nin like Cafes, of which many Examples might b0\ngiven in the World.\nNor is it ftrange, that the Apparition fhould\nperfonate the old deceafed Father of the Duke, and\naffume his Shape, to add as it were a Solemnity to\ntheMeflage, and give it a greater Influence upon thd\nMind of the Duke> and the fame MefTenger might\nhave aflumed any other Shape or Perfon if it had\nthought fit, whether living or dead.\nB u T if the Shape alTumed was the moil likely\nto give Weight to the Errand it was to be fent a*'\nbout, we are not to woncTer at all that a Spirit cm-\nploy'd, or employing it felf on an Errand of fuch\nImportance, fhould be able to fingle out fuch Ap-\npearances, or fuch Shapes and Perfons to appear iii\nthe Figure of, as were apteft to enforce the Mef*\nfagc. Thewell-chufing the Perfon is to me a Tefti-\nmony for, not againlt the Goodnefs, the Judgment\nand Capacity of the perfonating Spirit, and would\nwith juft reafoning confirm to us the validity of the\nMeflage, and of the Meflenger alfo.\nA^3b yet 'tis very reafonable to believe, that Sir\n\"George Fillers^ thus feeming to appear, and whofe\nSurface or Gut-fide is put on like a Mafquerade\nHabit upon this Occafion, knew nothing of it, and had\nno manner of concern in it. Nothing is more won-\nderful in any part of the Story to me, than that\nMen of Senfe and Learning, as fome fuch have been,\ncould be prevailed upon, or rather could prevail\nupon themfelves, to publifh to the World fuch in-\ncongruous, fuch irrational things as thcfe 5 that a Man\ndead, perhaps twenty Years before, I think it's fo\nmuch at lead > ihould appear, and fay, he could not\njfeft in Peace for fuch and fuch thmgs. And in ano-\nther of the fame Author's Stories, an Apparition is\nbrought in appearing to Dr. Turbervilk's Sifter, be-\ning a Lady who was dead, and had left fome Chil-\ndren to her Husband, which Children were injur'd\n7 ^y\n\fof APPA R IT IONS. i^i\nby a fecond Wife, Gontrafy to the Settlement of\nthe firft Wife's Marriage > and this Settlement of the\nfirfl: Marriage was it Teems hid behind the Wain-\nfcot, in fuch and fuch a Place, which no body\nknew of but the Children's iMother, that is to fay\nthe firll Wife. This Lady appeared to difcova*\nwhere this Writing lay, and tells the Perfon to\nwhom fhe difcover'd it, that 'till fli^ had made this\nDifcovery, fhc had wander'd in the Air, but that\nnow fhe was going to God.\nStrange! that Mr. Glanvil, Juhrey^ and o-\nthers, could publifh fuch a Story as this, without\nfome juft Enquiries to reconcile it to common\nSenfe, as well as to Religion} as particularly how\nlong this Lady had been Dead j for it feems to have\nbeen fome Years, the Husband being married again,\nand the Children being in danger of being wrong'd\nby the Children of the fecond Venter.'^ Now, did\nthe Soul of the firft Lady wander all that while in\nthe Air, to fee whether there Chould be any oc-^\ncafion for her, to vindicate her Children's Rights\nor no? did fhe ftay from going to God all that\nwhile, only for difcovering a conceal'd Deed, that\nlier Children might not be wrong'd } how ihall wc\nmake fuch a thing out to be rational ? what No*-\ntions of Religion or of a future State will fup*\nport it?\nWhy did {he not immediately difcover where\nthe Deed, or Marriage Settlement lay, and put ix\ninto the Hands of fome honeft People, in Truft fot\nher Children ? and then fhe had not need to have\nwander'd in the Air 'til^ it^ad been done.\nThey muft have ver|^low-priz'd Thoughts of\nHeaven, and of going to God, after the departing\nor feparating of the Soul from the Body in Life,\nwho think the PafTage can be interrupted by any of\nthe Affairs of this Life left unfinifh'd. If even out\nRepentance enfinifh'd, our Peace with God unfi*\nU i niih'd.\n\f2 91 The Hifiory and Reality\nnifh'd, can never be retreiv'd, if Time is not to be\nrecalled J buc that as the free falh^ fo it Jhall lie:\nShall we pretend the Soul fhall be flopped and in-\nterrupted in its PafTage, to retrieve the Injuftice and\nViolence done to the Orphans, or Relicls of the\nFamily ? fhall the Soul be brought back to find out\nold hidden ParchmentSjOr as it is pretended in other\nlike Stories, to dig up old long-buried Money, and\nthe like?\nNo, no 5 thofe things fhould be done in time\n:\nlike Repentance, they fhould not be left to that\nHazards for we may depend, there is no Work, or\nDevice, or Invention in the Grave, whither we are\nall going.\nThat there are inviflbe Agents, which in Pur-\nfuance of the Government of Providence in the\nWorld, may be made Inftruments, to a6b in fuch\nCafes as thefe j to difcover Writings which being\nconceal'd may ruin Families, rob and plunder Or-\nphans, and diflreft the right Heirs of Eflates, and\nin many like Cafes, this need not bedeny'd, and is in-\ndeed not to be difputedj and 'tis a glorious Tefti-\nmony to the Jullice of Providence, that in fuch\nCafes he does not abandon the Widows and the\nOrphans, who for want of lofl or conceaPd Deeds,\nare fometimes in Danger of being undone, by Vio-\nlence and Rapine. But all this is eafier to be un-\nderftood to be done without Interruption of the\nordinary Courfe of Things, without obflru6ting the\nSoul's PafTage into its determined flate of Happi-\nnefs or Mifcry 5 which it mull be the weakeft, and\nindeed the wickcdefl thi^g ip the World, to think\ncan be diverted by thd^ Trifles j and whofe di-\nrect Progreflion is plainly flated in the Scripture in\nthefe Words : \/\/ is appointed unto all Men once to die^\nand after Death to Judgment-, or immediately after\nDeath to Judgment, at Icafl fo as nothing to prevent or\nintervenes Heb, ix. zj. It is appointed^ and furely\nthefe;\n\fof APPARITIONS. ip3\ntbefe things can never break in upon that folemn\nAppointment:\nBesides, 'tis an evident Impeach naent of the\nPower and Juftice, as well as the Wifdom of Pro-\nvidence, in his Difpofition of things, as if he could\nnot find out Ways to do right to injured Orphans,\nor to dete6t the Injuftice and Oppreffion of violent\nand unreafonable Men, but the Soul of the depart-\ned Mother muft be kept out of Heaven to do it her\n(d^. Horrid Abfurdity ! and inconfiftent with all\nthe Notions that true Religion has infpir'dus with,\nrelating to a Future State, and to the Gulph that is\nfix'd bctwcn this and that.\nThe Soul can no more be kept out from, or\ndelayed its Entrance into Heaven, if its Portion be\nappointed for Happinefs, by any Concern for the\nAffairs of this World, than it can be difquieted af-\nter it is entered thofe Realms of Peace, and didurbed\nor brought back from thence upon any Accounc\nwhatfoever.\nThe very thoughts of it are fo mean, fo low-\nrated and bafe, that 'tis unworthy of our Rea-\nfon, but efpecially of our Chriftian reafoning Pow-\ners, to entertain them. I take this Abfurdity in-\ndeed to be much of the Caufe of that juft Ridicule,\nwhich the wifer Part of Mankind have put upon\nmoil of the Stories which are told among us about\nWitchcraft and Apparitions j for that they are\ntold with fuch evident Inconfiftences, that they\ncannot go down with rational People: Who can\nbelieve what cannot be true? who can make a feri-\nous thing of a piece of ridiculous Nonfenfe ? That\na Soul difmifs'd from Life, and going diredly into\nHeaven, fhall be call'd back by the Cry of the\nChildren after her, with a hold! ftay Mother! come\nhack^ and come and tell us where the Writings are for\nyour Joynture^ or we Jhall be undone? and the poor\nMother, Uncas'd, Unembodied, muft come back,\nU }\ndifmifs\n\f2p4 ^^ Hijlory and Reality\ndifmifsthe Angels that were carrying her intoJhra^\nham's Bofom, and bid them come for her another\ntime 3 and here {he muft hover about we know not\nhow many Years, to do Right to thefe Children.\nSure the fame Power that could thus interrupt her\nPaflage into Heaven, might have prevented her fe-\nparatjng from the Body, and {he might with as\nmuch cafe, and lefs injuftice to her felf, have beeii\nkept out of the Grave, as kept put of Heaven.\nBut I am fick of the very Repetition 5 the Dcr\nlufion is fo grofs, I fay it is not to be wondered\nthat we are fhock'd by it in our belief of the thing\ncaird Apparition in general. The ridiculous Par^\ndifcredits the real Parr, and it being fo fufeiting to\nour Reafon to hear the firft Part, we throw off our\nPatience, and will hear nothing at all of it.\nIt is true we fhould not do thus 5 the Reality of\nthe Thing, abftraded from thefe diftrafted aqd en-\nthufiaftick Notions,is not leflcn'd : 'tis our Bufinefs\nthen to rejeft the foolifli Parr, which indeed has\nalmoft fmother'd and buried the reft in its Duft and\nRubbifli, and let us judge rightly of things jis they\nare. There is no want of Examples, where (Provi-\ndence permitting) Apparition has made Difeove-\nities of villainous and diftioneft A6iions and Defigns\n;\ndetefted Violence and Murther, done Right to in-\njured and opprefs'd Widows, and Fatherlefs Chil-\ndren j and this without fuch a monftrousandincon-\nfiftent Additionjas that of bringing back the Soul froni\nits Entrance into Heaven, or difturbing its Reft and\nPeace in a future State: things too grofs to be fo\nmuch as nam'd among Chriftians, whofe Faith in\nthings Future is too well eftablifti'd to be capable\nof receiving any Impreffions from fuch Delufions.\nIhave an Example in Srory very particular\nto this Cafe ; and which my Author aftlires me of\nthe Truth of, rho* never yet publifti'd in Print;\nTh\u20ac Story is told of the late Reverend Dr. Scot^ a\nMan\n\f\f.Fa^\/.

B. Another Perfon relating this Story^ fays\nthe Antient Gentleman appear''d ftanding^ and\nhaving jufl opened the Door of the Doctor's\nStudy^ he was come in 5 and fainting the DoHor\nfpoke fir\nft to him : but the Difference is but\nJmall.\nThe Relations agree in this part, that the\nDodor was greatly furpriz'd at the fight of him 5 and\nindeed the feeing him as fitting in a Chair was the\nmofl likely to be furprizing 5 becaufe the Do6tor\nknowing the Door to be lock'd, and then feeing a\nMan fitting in the Chair, he muft immediately and\nat firfl fight conclude him to be a Spirit, or Appa^\nrition, or i)m\/, call it as you will 5 whereas fee-\ning him come in at the Door, he might at firfl\nfight fqppofe him to be really a Gentleman come to\nfpeak with him, and might think he had omitted\nfaftning the Door, as he intended to have done. I\nBut be it which of the two it will, the Do-r\n6bor appeared in great diforder at the fight, as he\nacknowledg'd to thofe to whom he told the Story,\nand from whom I received this Account, with very\nlittle remove of Hands between.\nU4 T\u00abE\n\fz^6 The Hijiory and Reality\nThe Spe6i:re it feems began, for the Doftor\nhad not Courage at firft, as he faid, to fpeak to it -y\nI fay the Spedtre or Apparition fpoke firft, and\ndefir'd the Do6lor not to be frighted, not to be\nfurpriz'd, for that he would not do him any hurt >\nbut that he came to him upon a Matter of great\nImportance to an injur'd Family, which was in\ngreat danger of being Ruin'dj and that tho' he (the\nJDoftor) was a Stranger to the Family, yet know-\ning him to be a Man of Integrity, he had pitch'd\nupon him to do an acb of very great Charity, as\nwell as Juftice^ and that he could depend upon him\nfor a pun6tual Performance.\nThe Doftor was not at firft composed enough\nto receive the Introduftion of the Bufinefs with a\ndue attention 5 but feem'd rather inclined to get\nout of the Room if he could, and once or twice\nmade fome Attempt to knock for fome of the Fa-\nmily to come up, at which the Apparition appear'd\na little difpleas'd.\nBut it feems he need not 5 for, as' the Do6i:or\nfaid, he had no power to go out of the Room if\"\nhe had been next the Door, or to knock for Help\nif any had been at hand.\nBut here the Apparition feeing the Dodtor ftill\nin Confufion, defir'd him again tocompofe himfelf,\nfor he would not do him the lead Injury, or offer\nany thing to make him uneafic 3 but defir'd that he\nwould give him leave to deliver the Bufinefs he\ncame about, which when he had heard, perhaps he\nwould fee lefs caufe to be furpriz'd or apprehenfive\nthan he did now.\nB Y this time, and by the calm way of Difcourfe\nabove mention'd, the Doctor recovered himfelf fo\nmuch, tho' not with any kind of Compofure, as to\nfpeak.\nI N the Name of God, fays the Do^or, what\nart thou ?\nJ\n\fof APPARITIONS. x^y\nI DESIRE you would not be frighted, fays the\nApparition to him again j I am a Stranger to you,\nand if I tell you my Name, you do not know it 3\nbut you may do the Bufinefs without enquiring.\nThe Do6bor continued ftill difcompos'd and\nuneafic, and faid nothing for fome time.\nThe Apparition fpokc again to him not to be\nfurpriz'd, and receiv'd only for Anfwer the old ig-\nnorant Qucftion,\nI N the Name of God,what art thou ?\nUpon this the Spe6tre feem'd difpleas'd, as if\nthe Doftor had not treated him with Refpe6t5 and\nexpoftulated a little with him, telling him he could\nhave terrify'd him into a Compliance, but that he\nchofe to come calmly and quietly to him 5 and ufed\nfome other Difcourfes, fo civil and obliging, that by\nthis time he began to be a little more Familiar, and\nat length the Dodor. ask'd,\nWhat is it you would have with me?\nAt this the Apparition, as if gratify'd with the '\nQueftion, began his Story thus.\nI liv'd in the County of\n\/ do not exadily remember the County he named j\nhut it was in fome of the Wefern Counties of\nEngland,\nwhere 1 left a very good Eftatc, which myGrand-\nfon enjoys at this time.

Yes, Sir, fays H^ill^ very well, I remember\nyou were fo weary you fat down upon the Cheft\nwhen every thing was out of it, you clap'd down\nthe Lid and fat down, and fent me to my Lady\nto bring you a Dram of Citron j you faid you were\nfo tir'd you was ready to faint.\nWell, Sir, 'twas only a Fancy of mine, and\nvery likely to have nothing in it.\n'T I s no matter for that, fays the Gentleman^ you\nihall fee it turn'd bottom up again before your\nFace, and fo you fhall all the reft, if you do but\nfpeak the Word.\nWell, S\\y^ fays the Doctor^ if you will oblige\nme but with that one, V\\\\ trouble you no far-\nther.\nImmediately the Gentleman caufes the\nCoffer to be drag'd out, and open'dj for it would\nnot be lock'd, the Key would neither lock it nor\nunlock it : when the Papers were all out, the Do-\nftor turning his Face another way, as if he would\nlook\n\fof APPARITIONS. joy\nlook among the Papers, but taking little or no\nNotice of the Cheft, floop'd down, and as if fup-\nporting himfelf with his Cane, chops his Cane in-\nto the Cheft, but fnatcht it out again haftily, as\nif it had been a Miftake, and turning to the Cheft\nhe claps the Lid of it down, and fits down upon\nit, as if he was a weary too.\nHowever he takes an Opportunity to fpeak\nto the Gentleman foftly, to fend away his Man a\nMoment 5 for I wou'd fpeak a Word or two with\nyou, Sir, fays he^ out of his hearing 5 and then re-\ncoUecbing himfelf.

Now, Sir, yS^yj he^\nlet me fay a bold Word to you ; I have found your\nWritings I have found your Grand Deed of Set-\ntlement > ril lay you a hundred Guineas I have it\nin this Coffer?\nThe Gentleman takes up the Lid again, han-\ndles the Cheft, looks over every Part of it, but\ncould fee nothing ; he is confounded and amaz'd\n!\nWhat d'ye mean.^ fays he to the Do^tor^ you have\nno unufual Art I hope, no Conjuring in hand|\nhere's nothing but an empty Coffer?\nNot! upon my Word, fays the DoBor^ I am\nno Magician^ no Cunning- Man^ I abhor ic> but I\ntell you again the Writing is in this Coffer.\nThe Gentleman knocks, and calls as if he was\nfrighted, for his Man with the Hammer, but the\nDodor fat compos'd again upon the Lid of the\nCoffer.\nAt laft up comes the Man with the Hammer\nand Chifel, and the Dodor goes to work with\nthe Cheft, knocks upon the flat of the Bottom j\nHark ! fays he, don't yon hear it^ Sir^ fays he, don't\nyou bear it plainly ?\nX Hear\n\f30^ The Hiftory and Reality\nHear what? fays the Gmtkman. 1 don't undcr-\nftand you, indeed.\nWhy the Cheft has a double Bottom, Sir, a\n^^X^t'^Qiiomj fays the Da6lor -, don't you hear it found\nht)llow?\nI N a Word, they immediately fplit the inner\nBottom open, and there lay the Parchment fpread\nabroad flat on the whole breadth of the Bottom\nof the Trunk, as a Quire of Paper is laid on the\nfiat of a Drawer.\nI T is impofHble for me to defcribe the Joy and\nSurprize of the Gentleman, and foon after of the\nwhole Family 5 for the Gentleman fent for his La-\ndy, and two of his Daughters, up into the Garret\namong all the Rubbifh, to fee not the Writing\nonly, but the Place where it was found, and the\nManner how.\nYou may eafily fuppofe the Do\u00a3i:or was carefs'd\nwith uncommon Civilities in the Family, and fent\ntip (after about a Week's flay) in the Gentleman's\nown Coach to London. I do not remember whe-\nther he difclos'd the Secret to the Gentleman, or\nno 5 1 mean the Secret of the Apparition, by which\nthe Place where the Writing was to be found, was\ndifcover'd to him, and who oblig'd him to comQ\ndown on purpofe to find it : I fay, I do not remem-\nber that Part, neither is it material. As far as I\nhad the Story related, fo far 1 have handed it for-\nward 5 and 1 have the truth of it afErtned in fuch\na manner, as I cannot doubt it.\nNow to obferve a little upon this PafTigc,\nwhich I am oblig'd to fay is reported to me for Truth,\nand 1 firmly believe it to be fo : Certain it is, that\nfinding this Writing was of the utmoll Importance\nto the Family > and tho' I am not indeed inclin'd\nto publiih Names to the Story, or to examine in-\n'\nto the Particulars, bydifcourfing with the Perfons,\nfor fome may be yet Living, yet I fay the Efta-\nblifhment\n\fof APPARITIONS. 307\nblilliment of not a Family only, but a Generation\nof Families, might depend upon thfs Writing, and\nthat no doubt made the antienr Gentleman lay it\nup fo fafe. But why then might not Providence\npermit, nay even dirc6t one of thofe Intelligent Spi-\nrits or Angels, mention'd above, to give this Notice,\nand in this manner, where the main and only Deed or\nCharter for the Inheritance was to be found? as\nwell as it has upon many lilCe Occafions, or in Ca-\nfes alike in their Importance, made ftrange and\nunaccountable Difcoveries of Things hid for many\nAges 5 and this without Apparition, but by a ma-\nnifeft concurrence of Caufes and Accidents next to\nMiracles.\nI CANNOT think but that Providence, whofe\nConcern for the good and fafety of his Creatures\nis fo Univerfal, and who it mull be acknowledg'd\nis not unconcern'd even in the minuted: Circum-\nilanccs, may think meet to bring fuch a thing as -\nthis to Light, upon which the good and welfare\nof a whole Family did fo much depend 5 and even\nto appear in an extraordinary Manner in it, without\nany Impeachment of its Wifdom or its Power 5 and\nif the fame Providence that thought fit to fave\nthis Family from fo much Injuftice as at that time\nthreatened it, thought fit to do it, by the Agency\nof a Spirit coming in Apparition to a third Per-\nfon, fo to bring it about as in the ordinary Me-\nthod, what hav^e we to do to difputc the man-\nner ? or what juft Objedion lies againft it ?\nUpon the whole, here's no Devil here, no ima-\nginary Phantoms in the Air, no Voices and Noifes\nd-elufive and impofing upon the Fancy one way or\nother; no Soul appearing, and pretending Jt can-\nnot be at re(l> and yet here is an Apparition di-\nrcaing to find out what was in Being, and was to\nbe found, and what Juftice required fliould be\nproduc'd.\nXz Nor\n\f308 The Hijloyy and Reality\nNor could this be the Devil: that wicked A-\ngent goes up and down upon a much worfe Em-\nployment. He is bufy enough, that's truej but 'tis\nwid'ning breaches in Families, not healing them 5 in\nprompting Mifchief, not preventing it 5 tempting\nMan to Robbery, to Whoredom, to Murther j not\nmoving them to repent. As is the Errand, fuch is\nthe Meflenger^ as is the Work, fuch is the La-\nbourer 5 and the wajP of judging is as juft as it is\ncertain, 'tis eafy and plain, we cannot fail to know\nwho and who's together.\n'T I s the fame in our moft rctir'd Thoughts j\nwe may very well know who talks to us, by the\nDifcourfe, who tempts us, by the Mifchief he\ntempts to. My good, wicked, pious, hellifh\nFriend and old Acquaintance Z G mull\nnever tell me, that he does not know by whofe Di-\nreftion he tranfa6ts,and who he converfes with,when\nhe is bid to break Oaths and Promifes under the\ncover of Confciencej when he aflaults Innocence by\nClamour, and leviesWar by Slander, againft Reputati-\non and Virtue on pretence of Zeal to Truth 5 black-\nning Charadters in pretence of giving the Innocent\nPerfon opportunity to clear himfelfj I fay he muft\nnot do this without knowing from whence he de-\nrives the extraordinary Motion to it, what Spirit\nprompts, and from whofe didates he takes the Di-\nreftion.\nWhen he daubs on purpofe to wafh, and ful-\nlies with intention to clean the Faces of his Inno-\ncent Neighbours, he knows as well as I, he is\na6tuated from Hell, and agitated ab Inferis 5 becaufe he\nknows that all Hypocrify is from the Devil 'y and\nas he knows himfelf to be a moft accompliih'd\nCheat, even from the outfide of his Face to the\ninfide of his Soul, he may ling after my Lord of\nRochejier in his Sarcafm upon a much bonefter\nMan,\n\fof APPARITIONS. 3op\nHe faid^ O Lord, O Lord of Hofis,\nI am a Ra-^\u2014\/d that thou knoixfft,\n'Tis a ftrange Hypothefis, that a late Vifionift\nin thofe pieces of fecrct Hiftory artack'd me with\nt'other Day, viz.

What would you fay for your\nfelf?\nNow that we may know how to anfwer the\nDevilj as well as how to fpeak to him, (for both are\nvery neceflluy) let me enter into the State of the\nCafe a little, between ihc Devil and us 5 nay, be-\ntween all the Inhabitants of the invifible World,\nand their Friends in this, let them be who, or of\nwhat kind they will.\nFirst, In order to be free from the Surprize\nof thefe thing*;, you muft endeavour to eftabli\/h\nyour Mind in rhe right underftanding of the thing\ncall'd Apparition 5^ that you may reafon your fcif\ninto a fufficient Firmneis, and Stcadincfs of Soul\nagainft\n\f3^.0 The Hifiory and Reality\nagainft all the whimfical and imaginary Part\nof it.\nLet us think of things as they are, not as they\nare only imagined, and fuppofed to bej fojt 'tis the\nReality of the thing, not the Shadow, that can fright\nand difordcr us, that is to fiiy, that can have any\njuft Reafon to do fo.\nFor want of this we are often feared and terri-\nfy'd with Dreams and Vifions, even when we arc\nawake, and when really there is no fuch thing in\nSubftance or Reality as any Vifion or Apparition,\nother than Apprehenfion throws in upon us, and\nother than our bewitched Imagination reprefents\nto us.\nI T is abfolutely neceflary, if you would not be al-\nways looking over your Shoulders, and always form-\ning Spedtres to your Fancy : I fay, 'tis neceflary to\nhave a right Notion of fApparition in general j to\nknow what it is, and what it mufl be, whence\nit comes, and what the utmoft of its Commiffion\ncan bej that you may think your felf into a true\nand clear Underftanding of it, and then your Fears\nabout it will be regulated after another manner. For\nExample\n:\n1. Establish your Mind in this particular\nand fundamental Article, that whatever appears\nit muft be either a good Spirit from the invifiblc\nWorld, an Agent of Mercy, a Meflenger of Peace,\nand confequently will do you no Hurt: OR,\n2. A N evil Spirity an Agent of Hell from Satan's\nRegion and Empire, the Air> and that fo what-\never evil Defign or evil MelTagc he pretends to\ncome about, and however mifchievous his Inten-\ntion is, he cannot do the Hurt he deflres, beeaule\nthat as the good Spirits are under Diredlion, fo\nthe bad are under Limitation > the one will not,\nand the other cannot hurt you, without an imme-\ndiate Command from above. The Fear therefore\nwhich\n\fof APP ARiriON S. 3ZI\nwhich wc have upon us concerning Apparition, h\nnot or ought not to be guided by their Appear-\nance, but by the reditude of our own Thoughts;\nand as we are or are not quiet and calm within, fo\nwe fhall or ihall not be under Apprehenfions from\nwithout.\nFortify your Minds then with a fteady Con-\nfidence in the Supreme Maker and Governour of\nall things, who has the great red Dragon in a\nChain j and when you think you fee the De'viJ^\nfear nothing, for He will never let loofe the De-\nilroyer upon any one whofe Mind is lleadily fix'd\nupon himfelf.\nThis is a critical, and perhaps a too curious\nPiece of Practice for me to meddle with, efpeci-\nally here, and muft be but gently touch'd at 5 you\nwill, it may Be, obje\u00a3t too againft the Dodrine\nof it, and fay , Who can fo efFedually truft in\nGod, as not to be at all afraid of the De'vil ? Now,\ntho' this may feem true upon many Accounts, and,\nas Times go with us, may be really a juft Obje-\nftion, yet, if we will believe Hiftory or Experi-\nence, it is not fo much a Difficulty as to fay Who\ncan do it? for it has been done.\nI REMEMBER the kuowu and famous Story\nof a Maid under a real and perfonal PofTeflion of\nthe Devil^ at Little Gadfden in Hertfordjhire^ tho'\nby an unhappy Difappointment I was not prefent,\nnot knowing of the thing time enough > yet I faw\nand conversed with feveral that were prefent and\nheard the Devil fpeak in the Maid and by the Or-\ngan of her Voice, tho' without any apparent Motion\nof her Tongue or Lips, or any Part of her Mouth*\nO F this Perfon i^ was poficively true, that\nthere was a certain good Man, tho' a Lay\nChriftian, who fo frequently pray'd with the poor\nDemoniack, being a Neighbour of her Father's,\nand fo conftantly talk'd to the Devil^ and batter'd\nY him\n\f3Z2 7t)e Hifiory and Reality\nhim with Scripture, that he was^ as I might\nfay, the DeviPs Terror, and he would not let the\nGirl go to any Houfe or into any Room where\nthis Man (whofe Name was Monks) was} and if {he\nwas dire6ted to any Place he would (lop her, as if he\nwas to go and fee firll if Mr. Monks was there or\nnot, and then he would bid her go, for Monks was\nnot there.\nNow, as I am well aflured of the Truth both\nof the Girl's being pofTelTed, really aduated by a De^\n*uirm her, and of this Devil being afraid of Mr. Monks 5\nthen the Queftion above is fo far direftly anfwer'd,\nthat it is poflible to arrive to fuch a State, as not\nonly not to be afraid of the Z)m\/, but even to make\nthe Devil afraid of us. I confcfs it would be a State\nof Felicity that would make Life very eafie to us up-\non many Accounts 5 and 1 could enlargfe very pleafant-\niy (to my fclf) upon that Subje6t. But as things go\nwith the World, I queftion much whether it would\nbe fo pleafant to thofe I am writing to, and there-\nfore I leave it : and fo if I have been preaching a\nlittle, it is fo little in length, and I hope fo much\nto the purpofe, that you may forgive me for once,\nefpecially upon Promife of faying as little for your\nGood for the time to come, as I can.\nThere is indeed a right worthy and commend-\nable State of Indifference, not only as to Who (hall\nor fhall not vifit us from the invifible World, and\nfrom what Part of it they comej but alfo as to\nwhat Station we are to have among them hereafter j\nand this happy Temper is much recommended to\nme by fome of my fafhionable Friends, as a mod\ndefirable Condition of Life: to be perfedly eafy, void\nofAnxiety and Perplexities of any kind, and forming\nthe moft perfeft Compofure of Soul that can be\nimagined.\nThey defcribe this the moft accurately indeed\nby the Praftice, for they fay moft feelingly, that\nno\n\fof APP ARITI N S. 313\nno Tongue can exprefs the Felicity of it > which\nindeed I believe is very true 5 they are perfe6i:ly eafy\nabout^becaufe thoughclefs of, that dull remote thing\ncalled Futurity. As for there being a State of Life,\nor a Something like Life after Death, they can't fay\nbut it may be fo, for they never enquired much in-\nto the Pnnciples of the Saduces^ or into any other\nPricinciples about it. But what that State is to be,\nor what we are to be, or not to be, in it, they ne-\nver trouble themfelves about it j they look upon it as\na thing remote, which People are not agreed about,\nand they believe never will, 'till they come there;\nand to be beating their Heads and perplexing their\nThoughts, about what, when they have done all,\nthey are fure they fhall never arrive to a Cer-\ntainty about, they do not fee 'tis to the Purpofeat all.\nThis is certainly a mighty brief Way with\ntheir Doubts, and a fhort anfwer to all Enquiries j\nand I muft own 'tis putting a fhort end to all\nDifputes with themfelvcs, about the thing called a\nfuture State,\nBut there remains a Queftion ftill unanfwer'd,\nand which is a Queftion of moment with me, what-\never it may be with them, ^vs. Where is the Feli-\ncity of this kind of Calm ?\nO, fays a Deift of my Acquaintance^ Peace of Mind\nis a Felicity, I hope.\nYes, faid \/, if it be built upon a right Founda-\ntion.\nNay, fays he^ Peace is Peace 5 don't tell me of\nFoundations.\nHold Friend, y^\/W \/, even Molinos himfclf the Au-\nthor of the ^uietifme^ which one Author well calls\nSotifme^ and ot theSe6t of the^\/>\/i\/?j-,and whore-\nfolved all Felicity and all Religion into the Calm of\na retired Soul, yet fixed that Calm upon the Me-\nditations of an upright Mind, and the Calm of a clear\nHeart.\nY i J\n\f524 ^<^ Hijlory and Reality\nI VALWE none of your Se^bs, fays my Friend.\nGallio was a true Politician and a happy Man, ji5fs\nxviii. 17. \/\/(? cared for none of thefe things -^\nand there\nwas his Happincfs.\nS o a Madman, fays \/, is happy in his Lunacy,\nand enjoys a thoughtlcfs Calm, all the while he is\nin the greateft Hurry and Diforder of his Soul.

'Tis hard to rejoice in\nthe MefTage, and be fcar'd at the Meflenger: the\ntruth is, we are not much accuftom*d to fuch folemn\nAdmonitions, fuch good and beneficent Cautions\nand Affiftancesj and this makes the thing ftrange\nand aweful, and be receiv'd with Terror and Fright,\nand perhaps if it was not fo we fliould receive\nthem oftner.\nWe do not find the old Patriarchs, or after\nthem, the Children of Ifrael^ were fo frighted at\nthe Apparition of Angels and Spirits 5 it's true in-\ndeed when the Angel appeared to Gideon at the\nThrefhing-Floor, it is faid he was troubled at his\nPrefencej neverthelefs the Mefiage was kind and\nencouraging j yet we find he recovered himfelf, and\ntook Courage to talk very particularly with it, and\nto expoftulate with him about the Circumftances\nof his Country, and of the People, and even to\nask a double Sign from the Angel to confirm his\nFaith : and how went he on ? he obey'd the Voice\nof the Vifion, notwithftanding all his Fears and\nDoubts, and he bow'd his Soul, and followed the\nDireftions given him.\nThere are abundance of Reafons why wc\nfhould liften to fuch Apparitions as thcfe-, their\ndiftinguifhing Charader is, that they always come\nof fome Errand or other for the good of Man-\nkind j take it either in general, or in particular:\nSometimes 'tis alledg'd they come upon trifling and\nmean Occafions, as is the Cafe in many Inftances\ngiven in Story, and in Print. But it may be an-\nfwered with an Enquiry, Are we fure thefe are not\ntrifling Stories, and brought in byPerfons, perhaps,\nbut half informed? But what are we to think of\nthe Apparition to King James V. in Scotland^\nwho warn'd him againft his Flodden-Field Expedi-\ntion?\n\f0f APPA Ririo N s: 531\ndon? which if he had liften'd to he had fav'd his\nLife, and the Lives of ten thoufand of his People\n:\nfor lefs, 'cis faid, did not fall in the whole Un-\ndertaking.\nAnd what fhall we fay of the Warning given\nto the Duke of Buckingham^ by the Apparition of\nhis own Father, which if he had liften'd to, 'tis\nvery likely he had efcap'd the fatal Knife? for Fel-\nton^ who Aflaflinated him, did it, as it feems he\ndeclared at the Gibbet, upon the Account of the\nPopular Hatred, and that he thought him a pub-\nlick Enemy to his Country.\nThese, and many more which I have men-\nI\ntion'd, or which I have not mentioned, have been\nthe Subje6b of fuch Meflcngers, and were far from\ntrifling. If an Apparition gives any of us Notice\nof our approaching End, and bids us prepare for\nit, is not the MefTage folemn, and the Occafion\nof it weighty 5 and is not the Notice worth our\nRegard? Is the Preparation for Death a trifling\nthing? and the aflurance how near the time is can-\nnot but be a valuable Notice j I am fure ic ought\nto be efleem'd fo.\nA FLOUTING atheiftick Man of Wit, v\/ho\nmuft be namelefs, becaufe he will not bear to be\nnam'd to the Crimes which he is not alham'd to\ncommit, told me, when difcourflng this Part of\nthe Subje6t, that it was no Kindnefs at all, for\nthat Men ought always to be prepared for Death j\nand yet cou'd not deny but that ic was a remote\nAffair which he had not yet given himfelf the\ntrouble to think about.\nI CANNOT believe but that if fome People,\nwho now value themfelves upon their bright\nThoughts, and their being above the Power of\nGhagrine, or of any melancholly Refleftions to di-\nfturb their Joy, were told (nay, tho' it was by a\nkind Apparition) that they were to die, one in a\nFortnight,\n4\n\f\\]% The Hiflory and Reality\nFortnight, one in three Days ; one at one time,\nand one at another, and all within a fliort time, they\nwould have a little alteration upon their Out-fides.\nQ,^ .\n]\\4 wlio laughs evermore, is conti-\nnually tittering and prompting others to the loweft-\npriz'd Part of Mirth, who is all Levity and Froth,\nand owns that one Sigh never yet reach'd his\nHeart J fhould a folemn Apparition come to him\nand his merry Friend, the very Duplicace oF him-\nfelf, and fay, Repent G , and prepare lor Death,\nfor you have but three Months to live, and you\n\u2022\u2014\u2014, pointing to his Fellow-mimick, but five\nX>ays J I fay, fhould fuch a Meflage be ferioufly de-\nlivered him in fuch an aweful Manner, as many\nRelations tell us have been done to others, I can-\nnot have fo little Charity for the Beau, but to\nthink he would change Colour a little, and begin\nto confider, and efpecially if at the five Days end\nhe had News that his other Self, the Image of\nhis extraordinary Soul, the very Sojio to himfelf,\nin Life, tho* not in Figure, was found dead in his\nBed to a tittle of the time.\nI s A Y I cannot doubt but that he would learn\nto Sigh a little 5 and my Charity is the more exten-\nfive in Mr. M 's Cafe, becaufe, take him\na little off of his ordinary Titillations, and unhinge\nhim from the light Article which has gain'd fo\nentirely upon him as to Eclipfe him, the Man has\nyet fome Brains, and they might perhaps affift a\nlittle upon fuch an Occafion, to condenfe the Va-\npour, and bring the folid Part uppermoft, which\nat prefent has not happen'd to him.\nAnd not to fingle out a gay Humour or two\nfrom the reft, how many among our Box and Pit\nHeroes, were they told they were under the Sen-\ntence of Death, and only Repriev'd for fo many,\nand fo many Days : I fay, how many of them would\nihinc at the next Opera ? how would their Coun-\ntenances\n\fof A?P ARiriONS. 3JJ\ntenances change, and their Knees knock one a-\ngainfl: another ? How would they fit down in Tears\nand Repentance, or fink into the Death foretold,\neven by the mcer Horror of its approach ? for\nthere is the moil: Dread where there is the lead Re-\npentance : Nor let any one cavil at the Expreflion,\na Sentence and a Reprieve, let them take it as they\nwill} the thing is no lefs, and can be under-\nftood no otherwife of us all : We are all under the\nSentence, as directly as a Criminal that hears it read\nat the Bar, with only this fignificant Difference,\nnamely.

A Ghoft was\nfaid to haunt a certain Houfe in the Gountry not\nfar from Rygate in Surrey^ it was met in the Gar-\nden by one of the Family, who had long valued\nhimfelf upon believing, and faying alfo, that there\nwere no fuch things as Apparitions, and that he\nwould\n\fof APPARITIONS. ^337\nwould be Aire of it when-ever he met fuch a things\nhe would know what it was made of before he parted\nwith it.\nGoing out of the Houfe in the Evening when\nit was almoft dark, but not quite, he meets the\nApparition in the Garden > the Apparition ihun'd him,\nand would not have been feen, or made as if it would\nnot have been ktn.HJ! fays he bo\\d\\y^areyou there f\nWhat are you ?

I\nhave a Story by me of a Gentleman who carried\non a Secret and Criminal Converfation with a cer- ,\ntain Lady, and having made an Affignation to meet\nthe Lady, was met at the Place by an Apparition i\nof his own Mother } flie faid nothing, fhe did |\nnot offer to fpeak, nor did he at firft know it to j\nbe an Apparition. The Gentleman walks about\nin the Field near a Houfe where he had appointed\nthe Lady to meet j the Apparition walk'd about\nlikewife, and he takes it to be a Woman in ordi-\nnary, as any Woman might be feen to walk up and\ndown in the fame Field or Walk.\nB Y and by the Woman or Lady appointed\nCQipes, he meets her, and goes forward to falute\nh^r; the Aipparition fhows itfelf juft behind the\nLady, and looks him full in the Face > he ftans\nback from the Lady, and inftead of kiffing her, cries\ncuty and asks her. Who's that behind herj fhe turns\nabout, but fees nobody, nor he neither, which\nfrights them both.\nHe fancies it to be an imaginary Vapour, ha-\nving no Faith at all in Apparitions, and offers to\ngo up to the Lady again 5 and behold, he {ees the\nApparition juft behind her again, the Face ftand-\ning juft fo as to look over the Lady's Shoulder,\nand ftare juft upon him ; he cries out again, and\nknows it to be his Mother, who it feems was dead,\nand in crying out again, he adds, My Mother\/\nat which it vanifhes.\nHad this Apparition any occafion to fpeak?\nWas it not Rebuke enough to look him in the\nFace? Even in common Affairs, a Look from the\nEye of one who has Authority to reprove, is fome-\ntimes more effedual than the Reproof, if it was\ngiv^n in Words at length.\nSup-\n\fof APPARITIONS. 339\nSuppose this Spedbre to regard him not with\na threatning AfpeiS:, but with a Countenance of\nPity, of a Maternal Reprehenfion, a Reproof urg-\ning Shame and Reproach, like that of Solomon^-\nIVhat^ my Son ! what^ the Son of my Vows ! my Son\nhe feen embracing a Strumpet! the Man went away,\nfays my Story, fiU'd with Confufion 3 as no quellioa\nindeed but he would.\nHere was no need of Speech j the Look was\na Lafli, and a Reproof fufficient j the Man would\nhardly meet there any more, if he would meet the\nfame Lady any more, and 'tis very likely he never\ndid.\n'T I s very unhappy in the Cafe before me, that\nit is impoffible to atteft the Truth of all the Sto-\nries which are handed about upon fuch a Subje6fc\nas this is 5 and therefore tho' I might make Flou-\nriihes of the Truth of the Particulars in all Cafes,\nas others doj 1 chufe rather to infift upon the\nMoral of every Story, whatever the Fadt may be,\nand to inforce the Influence, fuppofing the Hiilory\nto be real, or whether it be really fo or not, whick\nis not much material.\nAll thefe Cafes, however, return me back ta\nthe Advice above, namely, always if you fee an\nApparition, y\/>^^\/^ to it^ fpeak to it early, and anfwer\nany Queftions it asks, but be fure to ask it no Que-\nftions except fuch as are rcafonable, and may be\nfuppofed to be within the Reach of its immediate\nCapacity to anfwer j no Queftions tending to re-\nveal the Myfteries of a future State. To ask fuch\nQueftions as are a plain diving into the Secrets of\nHeaven, which it is already declared fhall not be laid\n\u00a9pen, is asking the good Spirit, if it be fuch, to of-\nfend on his Part, and is really criminal on your Part;\nas, to ask what Condition the Perfon is in, meaning\nthe Perfon whofe Shape the Apparition takes up ;\nHow be gets Leave to appear here j why he comes\nz z in\n\f340 The Hijloyy and Reality\nin this or that Manner j what kind of Place Hea-\nven is, and fuch likej as the Bifliop of Down and\nConnor ordered James Haddock to ask.\nBut fuit your Queftions to what the Spe\u00a3tre\nfliall fay, or as the manner of its Appearance ihall\ndireft you 5 as particularly, if it requires you to do\nany thing, to fpeak to any Perfon, or to deliver any\nAdmonition to a third Perfon, as in the cafe of the Ap-\nparition about the Duke of Buckingham^ and as in\nthe Cafe of Dr. Scot and others 5 you may juftly ask\nTokens by which you may make your felf be be-\nlieved 5 alio fuch Queftions as relate to yourfelf, and\nto the Nature of the thing which the Apparition\ncomes about.\nBut Queftions relating to things beyond Time,\ncurious Enquiries into Futurity and Eternity, arc\nupon many Accounts to be avoided} and for fome\nReafons which I care not to mention in particular 5\nbecaufe I would not form frightful Ideas in the\nMinds of thofe that read. I have fome Stories by\nme which give an Account that upon fuch needlels\nInquiries the Apparition has turn'd itfelf into ter-\nrifying Appearances, intimating Refentment 5 not\nonly a Refentment on its own Account, but as if it\nwas an OfFence and a high Provocation to the fu-\npreme Power to offer to fearch into what Heaven\nhas concealed : To me, indeed, it feems it would be fo,\nand therefore 'tis certainly beft to refrain thofe In-\nquiries.\nIn a word, the Apparition is, as I may fay, Ag-\ngreflbr j it appears j you are paffive 5 be fo ftill, other-\nwife you make your felf the Apparition, and put\nthe Apparition in your Place : ask it wherefore it\nappears to you, whether for Good or Evil > if for Evil,\ncall upon God for Proteftipn 5 if it comes for Good,\ndeclare your felf ready to receive its Me{rage,and to\nobferve every juft Direftion, to obey every righteous\nCommand, and attend to what it fliall fay.\n\fof APPARITION S\\ 341\nThis is to a\u00a3t fearlefs, and yet cautious > bold,\nand yet wifely 5 refolv'djand yet humble 5 and in this\nTemper of Mind, I think no Man need to be a-\nfraid of an Apparition.\nYou may refolve all fuch things into thisj Whe-\nther they are good Spirits or bad, Angelick Ap-\npearances or Diabolick, they are under fupcrior Li-\nmitations : the Devil we know is chain'd, he can\ngo no farther than the length of his Tether j he\nhas not a Hand to ad, or a Foot to walk, or a\nMouth to fpeak, but as he is permitted. The Cafe\nof his Commiffion to Job is explicit j fuch and fuch\nthings he might do, fuch he might not 5 even the\nLives of Job's Children, and Cattle, and Servants\nwere given him > and, like a Devil as he was, he\nwent to the full Extent of his Commiffion 5 he\nfpar'd not one of them that he could deftroy, but\nhe was forbid to touch the Life of Job^ and he did\nnot, he durft not, he could not kill him.\nI F then we are fure the Devil is reftrained from\nhurting us, any otherwife than he is direfted and\nlimited, we may be fure that good Spirits arej for\ntheir Nature, their Bufinefs, their Defires are all\nfix'd in a general Beneficence to Mankind 5 their\nPowers and Employments, as far as they arc con-\ncerned among us, and in things upon this Surface,\nare included in the heavenly Acclamation when\nthe Angels fung to the Shepherds, On Earth Peace\nj\nGood-mil towards Men^ Luk-. ii. 14.\nIf at any time they are MefTengers of Judgment,\nExecutors of the divine Vengeance, it is likewifc\nI by fpccial, nay, by extraordinary Commiffion > and\nI then they are indeed Flames of Fire, and pun&ual-\n(i\nly do what they are commanded, and no more.\nJ\nBut even then, that we may be eafie in the\ni matter of Apparition, they do not difguife them-\n':i! felves or conceal their Commiffion : As Manoab's\n\u2022-Wife faid to him when the Angel appeared to her,\nz 3 a\n\f341 7^^ Hifiory and Reality\nif the LORD 'were fleafed to kill us^ he ^ouU mt\nhave received a Burnt-offerings and a Meat-offering at\nour Handss neither would HE havefhewed us all thefe\nthings^ Judges xiii. 23. So here, the Apparition of a\ngood Spirit would not betray us, would not aft by\nStratagem with us, would not appear in Peace when\nhe means War j come like a Friend, when he was\nfent for an Enemy j give good Council, when he\nmeant Death and DeftruSion ; But if it appears\nin Peace, its Defign and its MefTage is certainly\nPeace,\nUpon the whole, you have no way any Oc-\ncafion to be difturbed at an Appearance, but to\nregari the Power fending, not the Agent fent 5\nlookmg beyond the Apparition itfelf, and with a\nrefolved Mmd, and a fleddy, calm Courage, fpeak\nto it, and demand its Bufinefsj I do not mean by De-\nmand, a Demand of Infuk and Arrogance, but an\nhumble, yet refolved Enquiry, Why, and on what\nOccafion it comes to you.\nI H AVEdone counfelling.

Such again was the Appari-\ntion of Jpollo which Lucian fpeaks of, which was\nfeen fulpended in the Air, and carry'd or mov'd a-\nbout from place to place in the Temple of Jpolh\nat Hierapolis. Lucian de Dea Syra.\nSuch was the fordid Impofture of Mahomety\nwho having brought up a tame Pidgeon to come\nto his Ear, where he fed her always with Peafe or\nTares, fo that fhe conllantly came thither at his\nCall j perfuaded his Followers that it was an Appa-\nrition of the Angel Gabriel fent from G O D to\nwhifper divine Oracles into his Soulj and that he\nreceived the heavenly Infpirations by that means.\nSuch was the Voice which pronounc'd him to be the\nProphet of the moft high GOD, which Voice\nfounding in the Air, no Perfon appearing to fpeak,\nwas concluded to be the Voice of an Angel, ap*\npearing to him, whereas it was fpoken by his own\nDireftiosi\n\f54^ ^^ Hijiory and Reality\nDireftion by a poor Fellow who he had placed on\npurpofe at the bottom of a Well j and when he\nfound the Impofture take with the People, he fent\na Detachment of his Followers to fill up the Well\nwith Stones, pretending it was that it fhould no\nmore be prophan'd by any Man or Cattle drinking\nof its holy Waters, from whence the Voice of an\nAngel had been heard -, but really to bury the poor\nWretch at the bottom of it, that he might not\nbetray the Secret, and difcover the contriv'd Delu-\nSon.\n^ Such likewife was the Story of the Afs that\ncarry'd him up into Faradife, and that not only to\none, but through fevcn or eight Paradifes or Hea^\nvens, where he faw two and thirty thoufand Vifi-\nons: And fuch were all the Apparitions which that\nridiculous Impoftor feigned to fee upon every Oc-\ncafion, 'till his blinded Followers believed him to\nbe an Apparition himfelf.\nSuch was the Image of St. G6\u00bb<?r^^,rightly call'd\nMiraculous, which the Greeks to this Day play\nhorrible Pranks with at the Ifle of Skyros in the\njlrchipeUgm^ and which they put upon the People\nas an Apparition indeed 5 exerciling particular Seve-\nrities upon People in feveral Cafes : But as it is ma-\nnaged by the Priefts, fo 'tis efpecially very furious\nUpon all thofe that neglefi: to fulfil the Vows made\nto the faid Saint George^ or in general to all thofe\nthat do not pay their Debts to the Clergy.\nMonsieur Tournefort in his Voyage into the\nLevant gives a diverting Account of the Condud:\nof this Devil of Skyros 5 how they worry the Ig-\nnorant People to Death with it, and impofe upon\nthem by it in the groffeft and abfurdeft manner\npoffible. As there are not greater Impoftprs in the\nWorld than the Greeks^ and efpecially the Greek\nClergy -y fo there are not a more ignorant, eafily-\nimpos'd-upon People in the Worldi than the Greek\nL.ayety %\n\fof APPARITIO NS. 347\nLaycty j and efpeciallythofe whom the GreekCXtrgY\nhave to do with : Hence it is, that the moft abfurd\nReafonings go down with them 5 and indeed they\nmay be truly faid to be Believers in the literal fenfe,\nfor they take all things by the lump, and without\nreafoning at all upon them : if not, it would be im-\npoffible to pofTefs them, as thePriefts do, with a Be-\nlief that the Image of St. George moves the Priclt,\nnot the Prieft the Image, tho' he carries it about\nupon his Shoulders.\nYet this is the faft : The Image of St. George is\nno more than a Pifture, and that of very courfe\nPainting reprefenting St. George upon a log of\nWood > 'tis plac'd over the great Altar of the Ca-\nthedral at Skyrosj which is dedicated to that Saint:\nwhen the Church is full of People, the.

This they call, and were\nthe fa6t true, it might well be caird,the Apparition\nof St. George y but be the Fa6t true or not, 'tis be-\nliev'd to be fo, and that's as well to all the intents\nand purpofcs of an Apparition, as if the Image were\ninvigorated.\nBut to fpeak it in their own words, the Image\nis feen to move of it felf, and to {how it felf in\nApparition to all the People 5 for notwithllanding\nits Bulk and Weight, it will tranfport it felf through\nthe Air into the midfl of the AfTemblyj there it\nhovers about, as it were viewing every Face and ex-\namining every Heart; if it finds any one that has\nfaird to perform any Vow to him (the Saint,) the\nImage immediately fixes it felf on the Shoulders of\nthe Delinquent, fingles him out, and not only he\nis expos'd to the whole AfTembly, but the Image\nplies him with furious and continued BuJBFettings,\n'till he becomes penitent, and promifes again in the\nFace of the AfTembly to pay what he owes to the\nChurcho\nBut\n\f348 The Hifiory and Reality\nBut this is not all : but when the Aflembly is\nthus purg'd by the Juftice of this Ghoft in an I-\nmage, it is then taken up and plac'd upon the\nShoulders of a blind Monk, who carries it out of\nthe Church into the Townj the Monk being blind\nand not knowing whither he goes, is guided by the\noccult impreffion of the Image, who guides him as\na Rider guides a blind Horfe > and thus he carries\nhim direaly to the Houfc of fuchas are Delinquent\nin the cafe of Debt to the Altar of St. George.\nNor is it enough that the Debtor feeing the\nApparition or Image coming to him, flies from it, and\ncfcapes from Houfe to Houfc j for the Image caufes\nthe Monk to follow him by the Foot, as a Hound\ndocs a Hare 5 fo that,in a word, there's no efcaping\nSt. George^ no flying from him, the Monk is fleddy\nin his purfuit, afcends, defcends, pafles, repafles,\nenters all places, 'till the poor Wretch, who maybe\ntruly faid to be hunted down, or Hounded down as\nthey exprefs it in the North, is oblig'd to pay the\nutmoft Farthing.\nThis Story fully confirm'd my thoughts in a\nRemark which I made from the beginning of this\nWork, that really Church Apparitions are the moil\nfrightful, moil teizing,and terrible in their way, of\nall the real Devils that walk about in the World.\nBut what need we wander thus among the\nAncients, and hunt among the Greek Schifmaticks\nfor artificial Apparitions, and for Ecclcfiaftic Delu-\nfions of this kind ? The Roman Church, that true\nCatholick Eftablifhment, built upon the folid Rock\nof St. Peter himfelf, how full is it of glorious Frauds\nof this kind ? and how has the whole Scheme of\nPapal Tyranny been fupportcd among the People\nin this very manncr,ever fince the great defeftion of\nthe Roman Hierarchy, from its true Primitive Pu-\nrity, and original holy Inftitution }\nNoTg^\n\fof APPARITIONS. 34^\nNot that I purpofe to make this Work a Col-\nledion of Church Apparitions, whether Popiih or\nProteftant } any more than I fliall enter upon a re*\nciting the Univerfalia of State Apparitions j 'tis\nwell for this Age, both in Church and State, that\nmy Dodrine of the Reft of Souls is cftablifh'd j for\ncertainly, if the Souls of the Departed could bedi-\nfturb'd either in Heaven or Hell5by the mad things,\nor the fimple things, the good things, or the\nwicked things tranfa6ted by their Pofterity in thefc\nDays, there muft be as great an Uneafinefs in\nthofe eternal Manfions on account of the prefent\nAge, as ever there was fince Hiftory gives us any\nAccount of things : Never did any Generation\nmake fuch Fools of their Fathers, and fuch wife\nMen of themfelves, and both fo unaccountable 5\nfure it muft be, that the Dead cannot come to the\nQuick, and that they know nothing of us, or the\nwhole World would be one Apparition, and we\nfliould, as Sir ^ B faid above, have all\ncome up again that was under Ground, the dead\nWorld would be too many for the living World,\nand we fhould meet ten Apparitions in every Street\nfor one living Creature.\nB u T to come to the Cafe in hand, the firft\nChriftian Apparition I meet with deferves our par-\n'\nticular Remark j firft indeed, becaufe of the Impor-\ntance of the Occafion, namely, for the Confirma-\ntion of the Faith of all true Catholicks in that great\ndifputed, yet unfettled Point, viz.

But this Part is efFe6i:ually to my\niPurpofe, viz. that there has been, and I doubt not\nHill is, a great deal of fliam Apparition impos'd\nupon the World by the Delufions of others 5 and as\nit lies chiefly among the Clergy, where mud we\nlook for it, but where it is to be found ?\nNor are the Pagan Clergy free from the fame\nvile Pra6tices, namely, to forge Apparitions to con-\nfirm their Delufions j and the Hiftory of all Coun-\ntries are full of Accounts of it, too many to repeat\nhere.\nThe\n\fof APPARITIONS. 3<Ji\nThe PofTeflions and Exorcifms in the difmal\nStory of the D\u00a3'vils of Loudon^ are full of Appari-\ntions and Vifions, by which the wretched Fraud\nwas carried on, and by which fo much Villany was\npra6tis'd, as is almoft without Example \u2022, a Story\nwhich has already fill'd a Book, and is extant in\nmany Languages 5 a Fraud not out-done by the\nBrachmans and Priefts of the Pagans in China^ or\nin Japan.\nI MIGHT next entertain you with fham Appa-\nritions put in Pradice by the Devil himfelf, in thofe\nCountries where he has made himfelf be worfhip-\nped as a God, and where he fnpports all the Devil-\nworfhip by Apparition 3 fhowing himfelf now one\nway, now another, as he finds it for his Purpofej\nappearing one Day in Fire and Flame, at another\ntime in Storm and Tempeft, at a third time in Humane\nand Familiar Shape; and in all the End is to keep up\nthe Dread of his Perfon in the Minds of his Worfhip-\npers, and to preferve a Reverence to his Inftitutions,\nwhatever they arc.\nI F we may believe our Writers of Travels, and\nObfervers of Things, the Devil not only aflumes\nHumane Shape, but infinuates himfelf in the real\nPerfon of a Devil to the Women, and fo poflefTes\nthem, (to fay no more of it) as to commit\nhorrid namelefs WickednefTes with them, fuch as\nare not to be fuggefted without Horror. In other\nPlaces, the Apparition of the Devil is the Fund of\nall their religious Worfhip, and he has Altars ere-\nded, and Sacrifices, nay, which is worfe, Human\nSacrifices off^ered to him.\nI N thefe horrid Performances, he appears in ter-\nrible Shapes, and the poor Natives are fo frighted\nat him, that the Fear only excites the Homage\nwhich tbey pay to him, and fecures to him an en-\ntire Sovereignty : for Fear, may, for ought I know,\nbe the Charaderillick of a Pagan Worihip, as Love\nis that of a Chriftian, The\n\f3^2 The Hijiory and Reality\nThe Great Temple of Montezuma at Mexico\nwas little elfe but a horrible Butchery of Humane\nCarcafles, the Blood of which lay fprinkled or\ndafh'd againft the Walls, 'till it lay there har-\ndened and congeal'd, if Report may be believ'd, a-\nbove a Foot thick, and that they facrifiz'd at lead\ntwentythoufand People a Year, m that one Pagodc\nor Temple.\nThe Indians confefs'd, that they had frequent\nApparitions among them of the Spiritis, which they\ncalled by feveral Names 5 and that the Great\nSpirit, that is the Devil^ alfo appeared to them up-\non their Great Feftivals, in bright and extraordi-\nnary Apparition i to approve and accept of their\nWorfhip and Homage, and no doubt of their Sa-\ncrifices too.\nI N Cochin China we are told the Devil goes far-\nther y for he not only fhows himfelf in Apparition,\nbut he utters lying Oracles, even himfelf in his pro-\nper Perfon, and alfo whifpcrs fuch Anfwers to the\nPriefls, as ferve to keep up a Decorum in their\nWorfhip, and a fecret Reverence to his Perfon.\nAnd Father Borri fays, the Devil walks about there\nfo frequently, and fo familiarly in Humane Shapes,\nthat they are not at all difturb'd at him.\nAt other times, as the fame Author affirms,\nthey affociate thcmfelves with particular Perfons,\nupon various Occafions, and efpccially with the\nWomen, as above j fo that, in fhort, in fome Cities,\nwhich are very populous, it would be fomething hard\nto diftinguifh between the real People and the Ap-\nparitions. How far, if it were examined into, it\nwould not be the like among us, I won't pretend to\nfay.\nWho knows, in our Throngs of divided Chri-\nftians, whether he meets with a Saint or an Appa-\nrition ; whether he talks with a Counfellor or a Devil ?\n^nd the art of difcerning would indeed be well\nworth\n\fof APPARITIONS. 3(^3\nworth having J indeed, it would be worth buying,\nif Money would purchafe it. The Devil's Difguifes\nare very many, and Apparition is one. of the beft\nof them, becaufe he can foon change Shapes, and\nchange Poftures, which in other Cafes he may find\nlefs advantageous to his Intereft. Nor is it eafy\nfor Mankind to come to the Certainty, even when\nhe fees an Apparition, whether ic be a Good or an\nEvil Appearance 5 and the beft way of finding it\nout, except that of judging by the Errand becomes\non, and which I have mention'd already, is to ask\nit the Queftion dire&ly > if it equivocates and\n\/huffles, conclude 'tis the Devil -^ for he is a Sharper,\nand a Diflembler from the Beginning : if 'tis a good\nSpirit, it will anfwer you diredly and honeftly, and\ntell you its Bufinefs at once 5 and this is what I\nmean, where I fay. Speak to it.\nJ F you find it is a good Spirit hearken to it; if\nthe Devil^ defie it; and whether it be a good or\nevil Spirit, fear it not-y for both are under the fpe-\ncial Dire6l:ion and Authority of him that made the\nWorld, and will govern it, in whofe Hands you\nare; and 'tis well it is fo; For as Good is above\nEvil, fo God is above the Devil. Tell him fo\",\nand bid him Defiance, and if you can but do ic\nwith a good Heart he's gone; depend upon ir,\nhe'll never Hand you, Probatum eft.

the Houfe very often, in the Day-time, making\na rumbling, and a clattering Noifej and in the\nNight-time flie walk'd in the neighbouring Fields\nwith a Candle in her Hand, and that tho' the Wind\nblew ever fo hard, it would not blow the Candle\nout J that fometimes ihe would appear in the open\nField, fometimes up in the Trees, and particularly\nthere was a little Heath near Barking called the\nCotman Deauy where it was faid llie was frequently\nfeen.\nThere was a Boarding-fchool of Boys in that\nTown, where there was in particular fome roguiih\nLondon Boys, who contrived all this Walking from\ntheBeginning to theEnd > Firft, they got a fmall Rope,\nand tying one end of it to an old Chair which flood\nin an upper Room of the Houfe, (for they had\nfound means to get in and out of the Houfe at\npleafure) they brought the other end of the Rope\ndown on the Out-fide of the Houfe in a private\nPlace where it could not eafily be feen, and by\nthis they pulled the old Chair up, and then let it\nfall down again, and made a great Noife in the\nHoufe, fo as it might be eafily heard by the Neigh-\nbours 5 then other Boys of the fame Gang took care\nto call out to the old Women in the nex;t Houfes,\nthat now they might hear the old Lady a playing\nher Pranks j and accordingly they would all air\nfemble in the Court-yard, where they could plainly\nhear it, but not one would venture to go up Stairs.\nIf any offered to go up a little way, then all was\nquiet again J but as foon as ever they retired, the\nrumbling would begin again ; This was for the\nPay-\n\fof AP P A R IT 10 NS. 37J\nI N the Night, one of thefe unlucky Boys had\ngotten a dark Lanthorn, which was a thing the\nCountry People did not underftand, and with this\nhe walk'd all about the Orchard, and two or three\nClofcs near the Houfe, fometimes (hewing the Light\non this fide, and then his Comrades calling all the\nold Women about 'em to fee it, on a fudden the\nLight would go out, the Boy clofing up the Lan-\nthorn 5 and then he would run fwiftly crofs the whole\nField, and fhew his Light again on the other fide.\nNow he would be up in a Tree, then in the Road,\nthen upon the middle of the Heath j To that the\nCountry People made no more Queilion, but that\nthe old Lady walk'd with a Candle in her Hand,\nthan that they faw the Light of it > and in a word,\nit pafs'd for an

take, with weak and bigotted Peo-\nple, and they were mighty willing to fay before-\nhand that they were fure fomething walk'd.\nWhen they heard the Chair tumble about in\nthe Chamber, tho' pulled by a String and no body\nnear it, no nor in the whole Houfe, the People who\ncame together in the Court-yard, fancy'd often the\nfaw Heads of People moving up and down the\nRoom where the Noife was, and

Contrivance of a few\nBoys.\nThe Notion of Spirits appearing to dtfcover\nwhere Money has been buried, to direft People\n'\nto dig for it, has fo univerfally prevailed with Wo-\nmankind, I might fay and even with Mankind too,\nthat it is impoflfible to beat it out of their Heads j\nand if they ihould fee any thing which they call\nan Apparition, they would to this Day follow it,*in\nhope to hear it give a Stamp on the Ground, as\nwith its Foot, and then vanifh j and did it really do\nfo, they would not fail to dig to the Center (if they\nwere able) in hopes of finding a Pot of Money hid\nthere, or fome old Urn with Afhes and Roman Me-\ndals y in fhort, or fome confiderable Treafure.\nA COUNTRY Gentleman had an old-built Houfe,\nwhich was the Remains of an old Demolifhed Mo-\nnaftery or Religious Houfe, and he refolved to have\nit puird down, but thought the Charge too much\nto beftow5 fo he bethought himfelf of a Stratagem,\nwhich was to give it out that the Houfe was haunt-\ned, and this he did fo artificially, that it began to\nbe currently believed 5 for he made a Fellow drefs\nhimfelf up in White, and pafsfwiftly crofs the inner\nCourt of the Houfe, juft at a time when he had\nappointed others to be at the Window to fee it.\nThey gave Notice to the Houfe that there was\nan Apparition \\ then the Mafter and Miftrefs and all the\nFamily were called up to the Window, where, tho*\nit was fo dark that they could not diftinguifh what\nhe was, yet they plainly faw the thing in white\ngo crofs the Yard, and in at a Door of the old\nBuilding j foon after it was in they perceiv'd\na Flafh of Fire in the Houfe, which was contriv'd\nthat the Fellow fhould make with fome Brimflonc\nand other Materials on purpofe, fo that it fliould\nleave a Stench of Sulphur behind it, but not be juft\nthe Smell of Gunpowder.\nAs\n\fof A?P ARiriONS. 377\nA s he expefted, it began to work % fome fanciful\nPeople having notice of ir, and being defirous to\nfee the fame Apparition, had the occafion offered\nthem, and faw it in its ufual manner of fhowing ic\nfelf5 its frequent walking was ordinary, at one pare\nof the Houfe where the Spirit had an opportunity\nto flip out at a Door into another Yard, and fointo\nthe dwelling Houfe 5 and when it went off thac\nway it gave a great ftamp with its Foot, and im-\nmediately it was gone.\nUpon this it was prefently faid there was Mo-\nney hid, and the Gentleman gave it out that he\nwould dig there for it, and mighty eager People\nwere to have it done j however the Gentleman\nfeem'd to cool in the matter: flill the Apparition\nwas {ttn to come and go, walk to and again, almolt\nevery Night, and ordinarily it vanifh^d in a flaili of\nFire as above, which in a word was very extraor-\ndinary.\nAt length fome of the Towns People in the\nVillage adjoyning, finding the Gentleman began to\nflight or negleft it, gave out, that if Efquire \u2022\nwould give them leave, they would dig, for thac\ncertainly Money was hid xhere> nay if he would\nconfent they fhould have it if they found it, they\nwould dig for it and find it too, tho' they digg'd\nthe whole Houfe down.\nThe Gentleman reply'd, that was not fair for\nthem to pull his Houfe down and have all they\nfound too, that was too hard j but he would con-\nfent to this, That provided they would carry\naway all the Rubbilh, and all the Materials which\nthey dug down, and pile up the Bricks and Timber\nin the Yard near the Houfe, and would be content\nwith half they found, he would give them leave\nto dXg,\nWell, they confented, and to work they\nwentj the Spirit or Apparition which appcar'd at\nfirfl\n\fijg The Hijiory and Reality\niirft feem'd to point out the Place, and the firft\nthing they took down was a great (lack of Ghim-\nnies, and a heavy piece of work ic was> but the\nGentlemanjWilling to encourage them, fecretly hid\nfeven and twenty Pieces of old Gold in a hole in\nthe Chimney, which had no entrance into it but\nby one paflage, which he Brick'd up.\nWhen they came to this Money they were\npp-feftly deluded, and out of their Wits; the Gen-\ntleman happen'd to be near, but not jult upon the\nSpot when it was found, and he being caird, very\nfrankly gave it them all 5 but upon Condition they\nfhould not expe6t the like, if they found any more.\nI N a word,this Bite made the Country Fellows work\nlike Horfes, and more came into the knot 5 but that\nwhich encourag'd them farther was, they did really\nfind feveral things of Value in the pulling down the\nHoufe, which perhaps had lain hid from the time\nof Demolifhing it as a religious Houfej and fomc\nMoney was found tooj but continual eXpeftation\nand hope of finding more fo animated the Fellows,\nthat in fhort they pull'd the whole Houfe down\n5\nmy, I might fay they puird it up by the Roots,\nfor they dug up the very Foundations, which was\nwhat the Gentleman defir'd, 'and would have given\na great deal of Money to have had done.\nNor did they leave the Houfe in a heap of\nRubbifh 5 but, according to his Agreement with\nthem, they carried the Materials away, and fet up\nthe Timber and old Bricks in an adjacent Yard as\nhe direded them, and in good order too.\nSo violent was the Perfuafion, that (upon this\nfancy'd iVpparition walking in the Houfe) Money\nwas hid there, that nothing could ftop the eager-\nnefs of the Country People in working j as if the\nSouls of the old Nuns or Friars, or whatever they\nwere who had hid any Treafure there, fuppofing\nany was hid, could not be at Reft, as was faid in\nother\n\fof APPARir 10 NS. 379\nOther Cafes, or could be any way concern'd for the\nfinding it fo many Years afterward, being almoft\ntwo hundred Years.\nI F they could fuppofe any thing fo weak, where\nmuft they fuppofe thofe Departed Souls or Ghofts\ncould have been, during all that time? and why did\nthey not appear before? what had all the Ages be-\ntween done to be fo much lefs in their Favour, that\nthey did not come to difcover this Money to\nthem ? but that the Depofit fliould remain untr\nGround fo long, without any enquiry after t,\n'till this Age, not at all more worthy than their\nAnceftors, fhould be inform'd of it.\nThere is not a thing in Nature fo generally\nreceiv'd, which has fo little Foundation, either in\nReafon or Religion, either in Nature or common\nSenfe j it feems not only abfurd, but ridiculous ;\nthere is not only no religious Reafon in it, but it\nis inconfiftent with it felf : what feems only won-\nderful and unaccountable in it is, that fuch grois\nthings fhould make fuch Impreflions, and that ic\nfhould be fo impolfible to beat it out of the Heads\nof the pofTefs'd People.\nIf you fhould offer to tell them that no hidden\nMoney was ever thus difcover'd, they would laugh\nat it as the greatefl Jefl imaginable, and tell you\nthere were five hundred Examples to the contrary 5\nand yet in all my Search after thofe things, and after\nevidence of Fa6t, I cannot arrive to one Example,\nwhere ever an Apparition dire6ted to the finding\nMoney hid in the Ground or Earth, or any other\nplace, and that any Authentick Voucher has been\nbrought to prove it. I know there have been many,\nperhaps thoufands,of fuch Stories told, and the Parti-\nculars are handed down with them > but I fay I never\nmet with any Authentick Proof of the Fa6t, fuch\nas that the Story might be told after them for Truth,\n^nd that a Man might fay without Bluihing that he\nbeliev'd\n\f'\nThe Hijiory and Reality\nbeliev'd it. And let us but enter a little into the\nufual manner in which thofe Tales are related,\nthere feems to be fomething fo weak and filly in\nthe telling, as if it was only calculated for Children\nand Chimney corners; for Example 5 the Apparition\nis caird a Ghofl, 'tis drefs'd up (to fuit the weak-\nnefs of the Imagination) in a Shrowd, as if it came\njuft out of the Coffin and the Church-yard, and as\nif the Habit of the Dead was a(rum'd,to poflefs the\nPeople with the Fancy of its being really the dead\nBody of the Perfon, and yet allow it at the fame\ntime to be a Spirit.\nWell, when it comes, and (be it what you\nwill) forms it felf in Apparition, all in white, and\nin a Shroud J what is next? it fays nothing to you,\nbut goes away before you > and perhaps fpeaks and\nbids you go or come along with it, or perhaps\nwithout fpeaking at all, leading and beckoning the\nParties they have appeared to, to follow them, and\nthen ftamping with the Foot it difappears at\nonce.\nThis Stamp with the Foot is reckoned to be a\nDireftion to you to dig juft there, in order to find\nfome extraordinary Treafure 5 and he would be\nreckon'd very flupid and fordidly dull that (hould\nnegled the Dire6bion, and not dig there > and many\na vain and fruitlefs Pit has been dug on fuch occa-\nfions, to no purpofe at all.\nBut that I may not declare my Infidelity in\nthefe things in an unreafonable manner, and disbe-\nlieve without any jud Reafon ; let me give you a\nlong Story, which feems to be left upon Record, of\na Pedlar in the Town of in Suffolk^ a\nStory believ'd as certainly as the Gofpel 5 and which\nit would be thought very abfurd for any one to\nqueftion the Truth of.\nThere was a Pedlar, fays the Story ^ who us'd\nto travel about the Country with his Pack, but\nkepc\n\fof APP ARiriO NS. 381\nJcepc a Chamber or Ware-houfc in the Market-\nTown for the depofiting and laying-upfome Goods\nwhich he had there, and which were too many at\na time to carry them all about with him.\nI T happened that this Man having been abroad\nlate, and coming home with his Pack, fat himfelf\ndown upon a Stile, refling his Pack at the fame\ntime for his Eafe: while he fat here, there came up\nto him a Ghoft, in the Appearance of a Woman\ndrefs'd as above 5 fhe came up to him with a fmiling\nCountenance, and w^hen fhe difcover'd her felf fhe\nilept backward, and holding up a fine white Hand\nbeckoned to him with a Finger to follow her.\nThe Pedlar, frighted as he was, immediately\nfollowed the z^pparition 5 (what he did in the mean\ntime with his Pack that's a gap in the Story, whiich\nTradition has not fupply'd 5) the Apparition leads\nhim in this manner, going backward and beckon-\ning with her Hand over two or three Fields, 'till it\ncame to a particular place, where there lay a great\nStone, and there giving a ftamp with its Foot it\nvanifhed.\nThe Man takes the hint, marks the Stone,\ngoes home to carry his Pack, as we ought to fup-\npofe, and comes out the next Night with a Spade\nand a Pick Axe, and goes to work to dig a great\nPitt in the Earth.\nHe had not dug far itTeems, (tho' the Story does\nnot fay exprefly how far) but he found a large\nCheft 5 I fay large, for it could not be a fmall one,\nby what you fhall hear prcfently.\nHe doubled his Diligence when he came to the\nChefl, and with great Labour at length got it out\nof the place 5 and we may fuppofe was not long be-\nfore he found means to fplit it open, and get into\nthe infide of it to fee the Contents j for he found\nit very heavy when he labour'd to get it out.\nIn\n\f38\n1\nThe Hifiory and Reality\nI N a word, he found the Cheft full of Silver,\nthat is to fay, full of Money j then keeping his\nown Council, he took care to depofite it fo, that\nby fome and fome he got the Money all fafe home,\nand after that carried the Cheft home alfo.\nWhat the Sum was that he found here,the Story\nis not particular inj but it fcems the bulk was fuch,\nthat the Pedlar thought fit to leave off his travel-\nling about the Country as a Pedlar, takes a Houfc\nin the Town, furnifhes himfelf a Shop,and becomes\na fettled Inhabitant and Shop-keeper. During his\nappearing in this Figure,it happen'd that the Parifh\nChurch being exceeding old and out of Repair, the\nParifhioners, (whether by order ofthe Diocefan up-\non a Vifitation, or by the voluntary adt and deed of\nthicmfelves the Parifliioners,! know not,) refolv'd to\nRepair the Church.\n1 N order to furnifli the needful Sums for this\ngood Work, they call a Veftry, and propofe a Sub-\nfcription of the Inhabitants, for fupporting the Ex-\npenpe> fo the Minifter and Church-Wardens go\nabout from Houfe to Houfe to fee what the Chari-\ntable Parifhioners would contribute, and among the\nreft they at length came to the Pedlar's (now Shop-\nkeeper's) Houfe, and he being told their Bufmefs\ndefires them to walk in.\nAfter fome Difcourfe, and perhaps treating\nhis Neighbours, he asks for their Roll or Subfcrip-\ntion Paper, in order to fubfcribej looking over the\nRoll he fees Sir Thomas ^'^o. Pounds, another\nGentleman ^v^ Pounds, another ten Pounds, another\nforty Shillings,and fo on : Come,fays he, give a poor\nPedlar the Fen and Ink-, Will your Gentry fub-\nfcribe no more than that ? fo he takes the Pen, and\nfubfcribes iis^ and twenty Pounds.\nSome time after this, having Occafion to make\na Hatch to his Shop-Door, as in the Country is\nvery frequent, it happen'd, that fending for a Work-\nf man\n\fof AP P ARITIO N S.\nman to make this Hatch, and looking about among\nhis old Lumber, he found nothing fo proper as the\nold Cheft that the Money was found in, and ac-\ncordingly a Hatch was made of it.\nA-wHiLE after this, as the Pedlar was fitting\nin his Shop, he obferv'd an Ancient Gentleman\nwho liv'd in the Town, and who had the Reputa-\ntion of a Scholar, and particularly of a great Anti-\nquary, flood poring very earneftly, with his Spe6ta-\ncles on, upon his new Hatch: This brought the\nPedlar to the Door, who after waiting a good\nwhile to fee what it was the old Gentleman had\ndifcover'd, at laft he ask'd him what it was he\nfound upon his new Hatch,that was worth fo much\nof his notice.\nTruly Neighbour, fays the Gentleman^ what\nI obfervc is very remarkable, tho' I cannot tell the\nMeaning of it 5 and I fuppofe 'tis in a Chara^Ser\nthat you cannot eafily read, as well as in a Lan-\nguage that you may not underftand.\nThe Pedlar defir'd he would read it to him.\nWhy, fays the Gentleman^ you do not underftand\nit, when I have read it.\nBut Sir, fays the Pedlar^ can you npt tell the\nmeaning of it in Englijh ?\nWhy, fays the old Gentleman^ it is the 'old Saxon\nEnglifb in the ancient Gothic Charafter, and it may\nbe read thus,\nWhere \"this once flood\nStands another twice as g&od.\nHum! fays the Pedlar^ that's old ftuff indeed:\nwhat can that fignify ?\nNay, [ays the old Gentleman^ that I don't know,\nfor who can tell where this flood ?\n^\nA y, who indeed ? fays the Pedlar : and if they\ndid, what can there be in that ?\nThey\n\fJ 84 ^^ Hijiory md Reality\nThey had a little more Chat of that kind 5 but\nin iliort the Pedlar got rid of his old Gentleman as\nfoon as he could, and began to ruminate upon the\nthing 5 where this flood I Why I know well enough,\nfays he to hlmfelf^ where this flood 31 I muft go and\nfee, it may be there is fome more of the fame.\nBut then he argued, why this is fo many Years\nago (fix or feven at lead, it feems) and if it was a;\nGhoft or Spirit that ihow'd me the way to it, I\nwarrant fhe has fhow'd fome body elfe the way ta\nthe reft: Indeed I did not deferve it, that I did noc\nlook farther when I was at itj to befure it's gone\nby this time.\nThus he argued himfelf almoft out of the\nthing again, 'till at length he told his Wife of it,\nwho it feems had been in the Secret before.\nWhy, you are mad, fiiys fl^e^ why don't you go-\nimmediately to the place ?\nNay, fays he^ I don't know whether I can find\nit again or no, now.\nWhat, fays his Wife^ muft the Devil come to\nfhow it you again ? fure you an't fo dull, but you\nmay find it again.\n'\nWell, the Man went however; indeed his\nWife drove him out almoft, Go, try, fays Jhe^ you\ncan but come without it.\nH E goes, and found the place in general, but\ncould not diftinguifli the particular Spot, which\nwas levell'd partly by himfelf when he fill'd up the\nHole again, and partly grown up with Grafs and\nWeeds 5 fo he comes back again, and tells his Wife,\nhe could not tell which was the Place, fo as to be\nparticular enough to go to Work.\nWell, fays his Wife^ go in the Night 5 I war--\nrant you the good Bevil that fliow'd you the firft\nwill put you in fome way to find the reft, if there\nis any more.\nSo\n\fof APP ARiriONS. 38y\nSo prevaird with by his Wife's Importunity\naway he went, and I think they fay his Wife wenc\nwith himj being come to the Place, the Ap-\nparition appear'd to them again, and Ihow'd them,\nin the fame manner as before, the very Spotj and\nthen vanifh'd.\nI N fhort, the Man went to work, and digging\na little deeper than he did before, he found ano-\nther Cheft or Coffer, bounded about with Iron, not\nfo big as the other, but richer 3 for as the firll was\nfull of Silver, fo this was full of Gold.\nThey carry'd it home with Joy enough, as you\nmay fuppofe, and opening it, found (as above) a very\ngreat Treafure. Fame has not handed down the\nSum J but fomcthing may be guefs*d at by the latter\npart of the Story, which is told thus.\nIt feems that all this while the Repair of the\nChurch (mention'd above) went on but flowlyj ac-\ncording to the old Saying, it was Church-JVork-y and\na Veftry being call'd upon fome other Church-\nwork, the Pedlar, who was prefent among the reft\nof his Neighbours, took occafion to complain, that\nhe thought that Bufinefs was not honeftly manag'd,\nthat it was indeed like Church-Work^ carried on\nheavily.\nSome of the Gentlemen took him up a little,\nand told him, he took too much upon him 5 that it\nwas none of his Affair j that he was not \\\\\\\nTruft for the Work 5 that they to whom it was\ncommitted knew their Bufinefs, and that he fhould\nlet it alone, and mind his Shop.\nHe anfwer'd, it was true, that he was not trufl:-\ned with it, if he had, it fhould have been finifhed\nbefore now; and that he had a right to complain,\nbecaufe he paid to it as well as other People; ad-\nding, that if they did not difpatch, he would com-\nplain to the Biflpp, and obtain another Vification.\nCq Tms\n\f38^ The Hifiory and Reality\nThis alartn'd the People entrufted, fo they\ngave him good Words, and told him, the truth\nwas, the Parifli Stock was almoft gone, and that\nthey had not Money to go on, 'till the Gentlemen\nwould come into a fecond Colleftion.\nSay you fo ? fays the Pedlar j there may be fome\nReafon in thatj you can't go on indeed without\nMoney J but pray how much do you want?\nThey told him it would coft near two hundred\nPounds more to finfh it, and do but indifferently\nneither > for the Roof wanted to be taken off, and\nthey feared the Timber was rotten, and would require\nfo much i^ddition, they were afraid to look into it.\nIn a word, he bid the Church-wardens call a\nVeftry upon that particular Affair, and he would\nput them in a way to finilh it.\nA Vestry was call'dj the Pedlar told them,\nthat feeing they were poor, and could not raife\nMoney to go on with it, they fhould leave it to\nhim, and he would finifh it for them.\nAccordingly he took the Work upon\nhimfelf, laid out near a Thoufand Pounds, and al-\nmoft new-built the Church j in Memory of which,\non the Glafs-windows, there ftand the Figures of\nthe Pedlar and his Pack, and (as the People fancy)\nthere is alfo the Apparition beckoning to him, to\ncome to the Place where he dug up the Money.\nThus far the Story. How Tradition came to\nhand it down to us in this manner, and fo turn it\ninto a Fable, I have nothing to do withj but the real\nand more probable Part of the Tale is recorded thus.\nThat there was a Petber, fo the old Englijh\ncalls him, that is a Pedlar^ who having long ufecl\nto travel up and down the Country with his\nHorfe, and his Wife, and himfelf, all three loaded\nwith their Goods, and going from Houfe to Houfe\nfor many Years, was grown rich, by hislnduitryj\nand that being too old to continue the laborious\nPart,\n\fof APPARITIONS.\nPart, he took a Lodging, firftin the Town, and fold\nhis Goods in a Chamber, and in the Markets only,\nbut afterward took a Houfe and a Shop in the Mar-\nket-place, and drove a great Trade.\nThat growing thus to be very rich, he con*\ntributed, upon their firfl coming about for a Sub-\nfcription, twenty five Pounds towards the Repair\nof the Church \\ and after that, finding they want-\ned Money to finifh it, took the Work wholly in-\nto his own Hand, and finifh'd the Church at his\nown Charge J and that the Pariih, in Gratitude to\nhis Memory, caufed that Figure of the Pedlar to be\npainted upon the Glafs, where the Pedlar and his\nPack is reprefented in one Place travelling about\nthe Country, by which he got his Living.\nIn another Place, there are Workmen digging\nthe Foundation of the Church, and the Pedlar\ngiving them Dircftions what to do, and how to\nproceed; and in another, the Church is built up a\ngreat way, and almoft to the Roof, and the Pedlar\nitill direfting.\nIn another Place, an Angel is painted flanding\nby the Pedlar, and pointing with a Rod or Staff in\nhis Hand, to a Place where the PedJar fets two\nWorkmen to dig.\nNow from the Pedlar's being grown fo uncx-\npeftdly rich, common Fame it feems raifed a Re-\nport, that he had found a Cheft of Money in the\nGround, and after that another. It feems alfo,\nthere is an Original for the two Verfes too, which\nis thus : when the Pedlar had firft contributed\ntwenty five Pounds towards building the Church,\nand yet the Parifhoners told him, they could not\ngo on for want of Money; he told them they\nmould not be difcouraged, he had given them one\nBag of Money, and, fays he, nuhere that ftood^ fiands\nmother twice as good: Til do it my fclf.\nC C Z HSNCB\n\f388 The Hijlory and Reality\nHence they thought the Pedlar mull: certainly\nhave found Tome Money that had been hid in the\nGround, and that the De'vil had difcover'd it to\nhim 5 and fo came the whole Story to grow up by\nlittle and litde into the Form as I have told itj and\nnow to confirm it farther, they tell us the Angel,\nwhich perhaps might be but indifferently painted\non the Glafs, or on the Wall of the Church, is\ntaken for the Ghoft that difcover'd the two Chefts\nof Money to the Pedlar, and is ihowing where to\ndig for it.\nThus the Story of an Apparition is handed on\nto Pofterity, and now 'tis as currently believ'd in\nthe Country, almoft as the Gofpelj and any Man\nwould be thought very bold, that fhould pretend\nto contradidl it, or to fay that it is not true in e-\nvery Particular.\nIf all the Stories of Apparitions leading Peo-\nple to dig for Money, were as well trac'd as this, I\nbelieve chey might be found as plainly fiftitious. In-\nvention has been mighty fruitful upon this particu-\nlar kind of Notion, that when Money is hidden\nfome Spirit or Apparition will difcover it 5 as if the\nSouls of thofe that hid the Money were difturb'dj\n'till it was found out and made ufe of.\nHow abfurd the very Suggeftion it felfis, I can\nhardly think worth while to fpeak of again j but\nthere are other Difficulties in it alfo, if an Appari-\ntion knows of and difcovers this Money.\n1. Why not difcover it fooncr? Why let it lie\nin the Ground, fometimes two or three hundred\nYears before it has been difcover'd ? and then an\nApparition comes, from none knows where, to bring\nit to light.\n2. Why is the Difcovery made to a Stranger,\nand not to fome of the Line or Race of thofe to\nwhom the Money did at firil belong.^ One would\nfuppofe the Apparition came, or was fent, or di--\nreded\n\fof APPARITIONS. 38^\nreeled to come, todo Juftice,and to give the Money\nloft to the right Owner j whereas thefc Difcoveries\narc often pretended to be made to Strangers, who\nliave no Claim or any Right to it, or any Relation\nto thofe who laid it there 5 and this indeed is unac-\ncountable, and makes the reft of the Story impro*\nbable to be true.\n3. If Ghofts, or Apparitions, and Spirits, or call\nthem what you will, are thus officious, and bufy to\ndifcover Money hid in the Earth, fo as to run up\nand down to Strangers, who are no way related to\nit, or to the Race or Families who were firft\nconcern'd in it> Why then do they not difcover\nall the Money that is thus depofited in the Dark ?\nand which no doubt is yet in great Quantities,\nlodged out of the Reach of Mortal Sight, and of\nwhich we find frequent Difcoveries made 5 as par-\nticularly a great Parcel of old Gold, found lately in\nthe digging up the old Foundation of a Houfe iii\nOxfordjhire. A great Parcel of Roman Gold Coin\nand Medals found this very Year, in digging up an\nold Vault in France^ and which muft have lain there\na thoufand Years at leaft, and no kind Apparition\ncame to difcover it in fo long time.\nMany fuch Examples are daily fhown us of\nMoney found Under-ground, without the Help of\nthe Devil^ or of any Apparition, Spirit or Ghoft,\nto difcover it, and which had lain, ever fince the\nTime of the Romans^ conceal'd and unknown.\nFrom all which Reafons I muft conclude, that\nthe departed Spirits know nothing of thefe things,\nthat it is not in their Power to difcover their old\nHoards of Money, or to come hither to {how us\nhow we may come at it 5 but that in fliort, all the old\nWomen's Stories, which we have told us upon\nthat Subjeft, are indeed old Women's Stories, and\nno more.\n\f3^0 The Hifiory and Reality\nI CANNOT quit this part of my Subje\u00a3t with*\nout obferving that, indeed, if we give up all the\nStories of Ghofts and Apparitions, and Spirits walk-\ning, to difcover Money that is hid, we fhall lofc\nto the Age half the good old Tales, which fcrvc\nto make up Winter Evening Converfation, and fhall\ndeprive the Doftrine of Souls departed coming\nback hither to talk with us about fuch things, of its\nprincipal Support 5 for this indeed is one of the\nprincipal Errands fuch Apparitions come about.\n1 T is without Doubr, that Fancy and Imagina-\ntion form a world of Apparitions in the Minds of\nMen and Women j (for we muft not exclude the\nLadies in this Part, whatever we do) and People go\naway as thoroughly polTcfs'd with the Reality of\nhaving fcen the Devil, as if they convers'd Face to\nFace with him; when in fhort the Matter is no\nmore than a Vapour of the Brain> a fick delirious\nfume of Smoke in the Hypochondria j forming it\nfelf in fuch and fuch Figure to the Eye- fight of the\nMind, as well as of the Head, which all look'd upon\nwith a calm Revifion, would appear, as it really is,\nnothing but a Nothing, a Skeleton of the Brain,\na Whymfy, and no more*\nSo Hypochondriack Vafours reprefent\nShips, Armies, Battels, in the Firmament\n:\n*Till fteddy Sight the Exhalation folves.\nAnd all to its fir\nft Matter Cloud dijfolves.\nI T is out of Queftion that the Imagination formt\na great many of thefe Vifions in the Heads of the\nPeople that relate them again to us 5 and they as\nfirmly believe them to be real Apparitions, as I be-\nlieve them to be nothing but Vapours and Cloud*\nBut on the other hand it cannot be deny'd, but that\nthere is a ftrange Forwardnefs among our People\nto\n\fof APPARITIONS. 3j>ij\nto propagate, nay, to raife and invent fuch Stories\nof Apparitions and Vifions j to furnifh them out\nwith popular Circum (lances, and to fprcad them as\nRealities, meerly and on purpofe to form a plau-\n{ible Relation > and perhaps fome, according to\nCuftom, fall into that old School-boy's Error, of\ntelling the Tale over fo often, 'till they believe it\nto be Truth.\nBut all this Fiftion and Fable, of which the\nWorld is fo full, does not at all leflcn the folid\nPart which I firft advanced, and ftill infift upon,\nviz. The Reality of Apparition in general 5 for\nthe fruitfulnefs of other Mens Imagination in coin-\ning of Falfhood, does not at all ieflen the Validity\nof a Truth which the Lie is made to Mimick and\nCounterfeit.\nWE have had a world of Tales imposed upon\nthe World about Apparitions fliewing themfelves\nto abundance of People, before^ at^and after the late\nMaiTacre in Ireland^ Ann. 1641, and it would fill\nup a Volume of itfelf to give an Account of them 5\nnor is it poffible to diftinguiih between thofe of\nthem that are Real, and thofe that were Imagina*\nry, efpecially at this Diftance of Timej but if [\nmay believe the Report of thofe that were upon\nthe Spot, and of others who receiv'd the Accounts\nfrom the moft Judicious and moft Confidering of\nthofe who were upon the Spot, the Fears and\nApprehenfions of the People, efpecially in Duhlin^\nwhere they cxpe6bed the Murtherers would break\nin upon them every Day, fiU'd them with Dreana\nand Phantofm, Vifion and Apparition, when indeed\nthere was nothing in it but their own dreadful Ap-\nprehenfions.\nNor could they be fo much blam'd as in other\nCafes, for here were People efcap'd from the Mur-\ntherers, even out of their very Hands j fome that\nhad feen their Wives, Children, Fathers, Mothei-s,\nHusbands,\n\f35^z The Hljlory and Reality\nHusbands, Neighbours butcher'd before their Fa-\nces} and no Wonder if thefe had the Images of\nDeath before their Eyes, after they arriv'd 5 no\nWonder if they had Apparitions and Vifions of the\nlike Mifchiefs every Hour.\nN o Wonder if they faw Clouds o^ Irijh Armies in\nthe Air, heard Shrieks of dying murther'd Women\nand Children, and that they vouch'd thefe things\nwith the utmoft Solemnity. Now 'tis true in the\ncommon Notions of Humanity, one cou'd not but\npity thofe poor People, and give allowance to\ntheir Fears, and to the Fright and Horrors that\nwere upon their Minds j yec it does not at all fol-\nlow that we, who are not under the fame Impref-f-\nflons, mud come into the Delufion with them,\ngive up our Underftanding and our Reafon to their\nimagined Vifions.\nW E are to judge of thofe things by the Rules by\nwhich we ought to judge in like Cafes, and after\nyou have made Allowances for the Terrors and\nFright which the poor People might be in then,\nwe fhould confider the rational Parr, for where\nthe Apparition is real, the Rational Part is always\napparent as well as the Vifionary Part : for Exam-p\npie,\nWhat Apparitions came from a good Hand,\nand for the good of the innocent People, whofe\nDangers were fo imminent, would certainly come\nin fome Space of Time before the Danger, either\nfo as to give Opportunity of Efcape, or at lead\nPreparatory Warnings, that the People might have\ntime to look up to Heaven, which the butchering\nEnemy would not fpare them; and fuch Appariti-\nons as thefe I fhould be inclin'd to give the moft\nHeed to 5 but of thefe we read of very few.\nO N the other hand, to what Purpofe could Ap-r\nparitions fhow themfelves afterward? and from\nwhom did they come?
