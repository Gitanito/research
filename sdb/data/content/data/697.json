Publisher: Society of Human Endeavor, founded upon the principles of the Brotherhood of Divine Humanity.  Editor: Dr. Orlof N. Orlow, Ph.D.\r\n 1\/1, September 1902.\n\n  The journal was ranked by Hiram Butler's Bible Review as \"among the best\" and was called by it a magazine of \"true spiritual worth.\"  Orlow described himself as Prior Brother and Director of the Society of Human Endeavor, The Orlow Institute.  He erected a Crafts and Arts Building in San Francisco, on the upper floors of which he held the weekly meetingsof the society  in which he discoursed on the wonders of \"Atmos.\"  An Oakland newspaper of the time explained that \"Ath-mos\" philosophy was the \"belief that the existence of this fundamental power called God was proven by our own existence and power to re-create; that we pass through various life experiences, called incarnations, or periods of life experiences, called incarnations, or periods of forward living necessary to the development of our forces, before we can comprehend the purpose of our life.  The temporary man-made evil is justified, its results being the true understanding of right by the experience.\"    In 1905 he figured as a defendant in a suit brought by a man who claimed to have been retained by Orlow to follow women and report their actions so that Orlow could blackmail them.   Testimony at the trial revealed that the Society of Human Endeavor had taken in only $186 in the 18 months of its existence.  Orlow was called a \"European philanthropist\" in local newspapers at the time, and in later years claimed to be the Austrian Grand Duke Johann Salvator, who most believed to have drowned in 1890.  He was buried in New York in 1927 under that name.
