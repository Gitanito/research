Theobald, as auditor, expressed his satisfaction at the care\nwith which the books were kept, but called attention to the excess of\nthe Society's liabilities over its assets at the close of the year. This, it\nmust be understood, is without taking any account of the value\nof the library, or of the stock of the Proceedings. A statement\nof the assets and liabilities was on the table. It appeared that the\ndeficiency would be to a considerable extent met by the saving conse-\nquent on the removal of the rooms of the Society, by the change in the\nplace of ,holding the General Meetings, and in the probable expenditure\nin printing during the current year.\nThe actual number of the Society has slightly diminished during the\nyear, mainly owing to the names of some who had become only nominal\nmembers having been struck off the list. The effective strength of the\nSociety remains almost exactly what it was a year ago.\nThe nominations for seats on the Council being just sufficient to fill\nS\nDigitized by Google\n\f214 Journal oj Society for Psychical Research. [Feb.. 1888.\nthe vacancies, the following were declared duly elected :-0. P. Bidder,\nEsq., Q.C., Oliver Elton, Esq., A. T. Myers, Esq., M.D., C. Lockhart\nRobertson, Esq., M.D., Professor H. Sidgwick, J. Herbert Stack, Esq.\nThis was formally done at the adjourned Meeting on the 4th.\n. A conversation took place as to the means by which the general\ninterest of the members in the work of the Society might be extended\nand increased. It was decided to issue a circular letter to the members\nin reference to some of the points discussed.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nA General Meeting was held on the evening of January 28th, at\nthe Westminster Town Hall. Professor Sidgwick took the chair.\nThe Chairman, in opening the Meeting, spoke of the great and\nirreparable loss which the Society had Buffered through the sudden\ndeath of their President, Professor Balfour Stewart. It had been of\nthe greatest advantage to them that one bearing so high and un-\ndisputed a reputation as a physicist had been willing to lead and direct\ntheir endeavours to penetrate the obscure region of psychical research.\nOf the work that had been done under Balfour Stewart's leadership it\nwas not now the time to speak in detail:. but all who had watched his\nmanagement of ~eir affairs would agree that it was marked by three\ncharacteristics :-it was thoroughly fearless, it was uniformly circum-\nspect, and it was genuinely sympathetic. He believed it was only by\nthis combination of qualities that they cOltld hope to succeed in the\ndifficult task that they had undertaken: and it was because they could\nhardly hope to find them agaiR combined in a President of Balfour\nStewart's scientific eminence that he had spoken of his loss as irreparable.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then communicated to the meeting two\n\"Remarkable instances of a.utomatic Dlessages,\" introducing them with\nsome remarks, of which the following is an abstract :-\nI may begin by briefly reminding my audience of the position in\nwhich our inquiry into Automatic Messages at present stands. First\nof all,I tried to show that automatic writing, with planchette or pencil,\nmay often be automatic in the fll11est sense, as proceeding from a.\nstratum of the writer's intelligence which forms no part of his conscious\nlife at the time. Next, I gave some cases where the automatic\nmessages have reproduced facts which were never in the writer's\nconscious mind, but have apparently been transferred to his unconscious\nmind from the mind of some other person, usually present in the room.\nOf these telepathic messages the Newnham case was \u00b7our leading\ntype. It next seemed needful to discuss the singular assumptions\nof one or more definite personalities so common in automatic script,\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb\u2022\u2022 1888.] Journal of Society for Psychical Re8earch. 215\nand which are by Spiritualists taken to imply the communication\nof one or more definite spirits. By analogies drawn from dream!>,\nfrom hypnotism, and from various morbid states, I showed that\nsuch apparent duplications or splittings-up of personality may occur\nWithin the operation of a single mind, and need not be taken to imply\nany extraneous agency. Next, extending the survey from writing to\nother forms of automatism, I tried to show that these automatisms are\nan active or motor form of hallucination; or, if it be preferred, that\nhallucinations of the senses are a passive automatism. I mean by this\nthat in both classes of phenomena alike we have a message of some\nkind originated in some unconscious stratum of our personality and then\nrising into consciousness, whether as a vision or as an audition or on\nthe other hand as a movement. Thus it comes to much the same, thing\nwhether a man writes a message-not knowing what he is writing-or\nwhether he hears it, as though spoken, either within himself or outside\nhimself, but not by himself. All these forms of reception of a message\n-vision, audition, movement, or a mere impression less defined though\noften not. less distinct than any of these-may come interchangeably to\nany percipient. And as soon as we thus look a.t these forms of message\nin connection with each other, it at once occurs to us that writing need\nnot be the only form of motion through which the message from the\nunconscious part of our being makes its way into our conscious life.\nThe tilts of a table, or other easily movable object, so familiar in\nSpiritualistic circles and so much derided by the unbeliever who asks\n\" whether the spirits live in the table,\" are now seen to form a simple\nmodification of that automatic energy of which we have reviewed so\nmany other examples.\nIn thus speaking, I am for the time setting aside the question as to\nraps, or as to movements in tables, &c., which the unconscious mus-\ncular action of the sitters could not effect. Such movements, if\ngenuinely occurring, indicate the existence of some unexplained source\nof physical energy, but they do not in themselves suffice to show that\nsuch energy may not be developed in some unknown way from the\npersons present. At any rate, the vast majority of table-tiltings occur\nunder conditions such that the muscles of the sitters might\nhave effected them, just as the muscles of the automatic writer\nundoubtedly move the pencil. In the case of the tilts, then, as in the\ncase of the written messages, it is from the substance of the message,\nnot from the mere mode of its production, that we must form our\nopinion as to its source. It ma.y be necessary to add that the\nconventional ways of getting a message by tilts are two: Either\nthe inquirer slowly repeats the alphabet and the table tilts at the letter\nrequired, or the table tilts out the letters by repeating its movement\n8 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f216 JO'Urnal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1888.\nwice for B, fh'e times for E, 20 times for T, &c., according to the\nposition of the letter in the alphabet. One marked tilt conventionally\nsignifies No, and three tilts Yes.\nThe cases which I am about to give differ from those previously\ncited, not only in the fact that the messages .come through tilts of a\ntable, but in the nature of the intelligence apparently communicating.\nIn one of them, Mrs. Kirby's case,l we have apparently a message\nproceeding from a living personage asleep at a great distance. In\nthe other case, here to be cited, we have the alleged communication of\na disembodied spirit. I need not say to readers of our Jou1'nal or\nProceedings that an interpretation of this latter kind must not, in our\nview, be lightly accepted; and to some minds the singular coincidences\nwhich I shall recount may seem explicable by chance alone. I have\nbeen anxious, however, to cite the case in order to show how deeply\ninteresting are the problems involved, and to induce other informants,\nif possible, to send me cases of a similar kind, should such exist.\nMRS. FITZGERALD'S CASE.\nFor the following account J am indebted to Mrs. FitZGerald,\nof 19, Cambridge-street, Hyde Park-square, W., and her son, Mr.\nDesmond FitzGerald (at one time a member of the Council of the\nSociety for Psychical Research), to both of whom the cordial thanks of\nour Society are due.2\nMrs. FitzGerald and her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Desmond FitzGerald,\nhave been for some years in the habit of sitting quietly together to\nreceive messages by slight tilts of a table. Mr. FitzGerald has\noccasionally joined the group, but strangers have rarely been admitted,\nand the communications have been throughout of a very private kind.\nI was, therefore, especially grateful for the permission to be present at\none of these meetings (May 13th, 1886), and afterwards to print here\nan abstract of so:ne of the cases in which messages admitting of a\ndefinite test have been received by this group. The members of the\ngroup, who are all Spiritualists, believe that they can recognise the\ncommunicating spirit by certain indications, given by movements of the\ntable,which have never deceived them. They allege that although purely\nfrivolous and untrustworthy 'messages are sometimes given by\nunrecognised spirits, the recognised communicants have never stated\nanything false, nor shown any inconsistency. The three spirits that\nwill here be mentioned (whose true names, with particulars, have been\ncom~unicated to me) are a Mr. E., an intimate friend of Mrs.\n1 This case will be printed on a future occasion.\nS Mrs. FitzGerald has revised ~he abstract of her papers here given.\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb., 1888.] JO'Urnal of Society for P8ychical Re8(J,o,rch. 217\nFitzGerald's, Lord X. (a near connection, who died in 1870), and Lady\nS. (her daughter, who died in 1858), through whom the bulk of the com-\nmunications formerly came, though now this spirit (I use throughout\nthe phraseology of the messages themselves) has passed into a sphere\ntoo high to allow her to communicate.\nNotes havo been taken throughout the whole course of sittings,\neither during the sittings or at their close. The lnessages have been\nawaited in a serious spirit, without impatience or interference, and\nfrequently the group, having met, has separated again at once, on being\ninformed that the occasion was in some way unsuitable; or, as it was\ngenera.lly phrased, that low or strange spirits threatened to assume\ncontrol. However we explain .the messages received, I think it\nlikely that this temper of mind has conduced to their reception; and\nfrom this point of view there is an advantage in a. previous readiness\nto attach high value to the expected communication. It is quite possible\nthat, if such messages do ever proceed from the spirits of the\ndead, Spiritualists may be more likely than sceptics to receive them;\nand it,therefore,seems tomeurgently important tha.t Spiritualists should\nmake constant and patient attempts of the kind-adding to their faith,\nI need hardly say, the care and candour of which Mrs. FitzGerald's\ngroup, 1 think, has given proof.\nI cite one case in connection with each of the three communicating\nspirits mentioned above.\nI. Mr. E., when on his deathbed, sent for Mrs. FitzGerald to come\nand see him. She visited him in his chambers in the Albany and said\nfarewell, he being then pa'3t hope, and his death expected at any\nmoment. He blessed her and promised to watch over her. Afterwards\nhis spirit was one of the habitual and most trusted communicants, and\nMrs. F. believed herself able to feel sure of his identity, when he came.\nAfter many such messages she alluded one day to his death in the\nAlbany. \"I did not die in the Albany\" was tilted out. Shocked\nat what seemed the intrusion of some lying spirit in the friend's\nname, Mrs. F. solemnly repeated the question, \"You died in the\nAlbany, did you not1\" The ~swerwas an emphatic No. This was\nrepeated several times, and then Mrs. F. was so pained and bewil-\ndered at the breakdown of her cherished belief in this spirit's\nidentity and trustworthiness that for a. considerable time she BOught no\nfurther communication. She had no thought of testing the truth of\nthe message, as she considered that she absolutely knew that Mr. E. had\ndied in his chambers. It was not till BOme months later that a common\nfriend accidentally mentioned that Mr. E. had been removed from\nthe Albany at his own wish, when almost at the point of death,\nwith the idea that he would be better nursed in a private house.\nDigitized by Google\n\f218 JO'Urnal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1888.\nIt is deeply to be regretted that Mrs. F. did not inquire from the\ncommunicating spirit where he had died. If the address had been\ngiven the test would have been excellent. No further facts, it appears,\ncan now be got from Mr. E.'s spirit. The coincidence is therefore\nreduced to a single fact; but that one fact is a striking one, and\ncannot be said to have been in Mrs. FitzGerald's mind.\nII. The second point is connected with Mrs. F.'s deceased\nconnection, Lord X. This spirit also came at intervals, and during the\nwinter 1872-3 mentioned, after a prolonged absence (from late in 1872\ntill May, 1873), that he had been with his son, the present Lord X., at\nMalta. Mrs. F. had, as she believed, good reason to know\nthat Lord X. was in Scotland, and she set down this message also as\nfalse-with less of a shock than in Mr. E.'s case, as this spirit had\ncommunicated less frequently and intimately. Some time afterwards\na friend (whom Mrs. F. has again found, and who remembers the\ncircumstance) mentioned casually that she had seen in a society\njournal that Lord X. was at Malta in his yacht. Mrs. F. believed\nthis, without seeking further corroboration, till May, 1886, when, at\nmy request, she wrote to Lord X.'s solicitors as to his whereabouts in\n1872-3. The answer, which I have seen and copied, was as follows:-\n\"Lord X. went abroad in November, 1872, and returned about the end\nof March, 1873. During his absence his address was Yacht --,\nCorfu. There are no letters addressed to him at Malta, and we cannot\ngive the exact date when he was there.\" It seems, therefore, pretty\ncertain that the society paper was rightly informed, and that the\npresent Lord X. was actually at Malta about the time when his father's\nspirit so asserted.\nIt deserves notice, as an instance of the characteristic bizarrerie of\nthese communications, that this spirit never once gave the title by\nwhich they had known him best, nor the title which was his at death,\nbut generally his surname merely, which being a not very uncommon\none, did not in any way suggest him to their minds, so that they\npuzzled for nearly three-quarters of an hour when it was first given.\nIII. The third case involves a name and date, which were certainly\nunknown to the sitters. The question here is whether the coincidence\ncan have been due to chance. I prefer to give an abstract of the\nwritten account in my possession, as the answers are intermixed with\nreligious matter-too sacred in the eyes of those who received it to be\nquoted in a paper where the actual origin of these messages is still a\nsubject of discussion. Mrs. FitzGerald's deceased daughter, already\nmentioned, is represented in messages purporting to come from her as .\ncarrying on beyond the grave the same work of befriending the friend-\nless, which was hers on earth. Amongst other names none of them\nDigitized by Google\n\fJ!'eb.,l888.] Journal of Society f01' Psychical Research. 219\naccompanied with sufficient facts to be traceable, of spirits thus aided in\nan upward struggle, the name of Mary Allen was given. \"She died at\na Paddington hospital.\" \"Which hospital, St. Mary's 1\" \" No, at the\nLock Hospital, at the age of 18, 16 years ago.\" This answer was given\nin 1881. On inquiry at the Lock Hospital the following answer was\nreceived :-\" Mr. B. begs to inform Mrs. FitzGerald that a registry of\ndeaths is kept in this hospital, but that no person of the name of Mary\nAllen has ever died here. A person named Mary Ann Allen was in\nthis hospital from March 10th, 1865, to March 24th, when she was\ndischarged at her own request, nearly cured.\"\nOn further inquiry the alleged Mary Allen said that she had given\nthe hospital as the best place where she could be traced-she having died\nshortly after quitting the hospital at a small cottage, since destroyed,\nbelonging to a tailor named Gibbs, in Wells-street, Kilburn. No such\nname or street appears in Kilburn in the Suburban Directory for\n1866, but this proves nothing, as Kilburn was then a somewhat squalid\nsuburb, and some small streets are doubtless omitted, the Directory\nnot professing completeness. The Register of Deaths affords little\naid, as Mary Ann Allen is a common combination of names, some\neight or ten persons of that name dying in London annually, nor is it\nby any means certain that the death of a poor woman of this kind\nwould be registered under the same name. Weare left, therefore, with\nthe coincidence of date, name, and sojourn at the Lock Hospital. It is\nobservable, moreover, that these alleged facts form part of a series of\nmessages which have maintained a consistent character over some 18\nyears or so, and have never, as I am informed, been discovered to be\nfalse. Few of the communications, however, have admitted of any\ndefinite proof or disproof.\nIn the present state of this inquiry it would, I think, be premature\nto express, or even to form, any decided opinion as to the origin of\nthese messages. One strong argument against the Spiritualistic\nhypothesis lies in the extreme paucity .of recorded cases where there is\nany real evidence that facts havebeencommunicatedwhichwereunknown\nto the sitters, and were in any way connected with deceased persons.\nThe exact force of this argument, however, depends on the number of\nserious and persistent efforts (such as that which I havejust recounted)\nwhich have been made to obtain communications of this kind. From\nthe vague expressions used by some Spiritualists, I had r..t one time\nsupposed that..such efforts were very numerous, and, therefore, that the\nnegative argument from their general ill-success was almost insuper-\nable. But I have now seen reason to believe that the number of\npersons who have hitherto used the care and patience requisite to make\ntheir efforts of any value is in reality by no means large. There is,\n\f220 Journal oJ Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1888.\ntherefore, the less reason to fix an assured limit to the results con-\nceivably attainable, if only I can persuade those who hear me to do\ntheir utmost to put these stra.nge alleged possibilities to actual test.\nMr. Edmund Gurney followed with a paper on \"Apparitions\noccurring soon after Death.\" In most of the cases where persons\nhave professed to have seen or held communication with deceased\nfriends, there is nothing to distinguish the experience which they\ndescribe from purely subjective hallucination. It must be remembered\nthat the very idea of purely subjective hallucinations of the senses of\nsa.ne and healthy people is comparatively a novelty; before the days\nof scientific psychology (notably through all the witch-period) every\nfictitious appearance was held to have some objectiv.e-usually &\nSatanic-basis We now know that the most definite and distinct\nappearance, se '1 in \"oaking and sober moments, may still be nothing\nmore than a projection of the percipient's own brain. And among\nsuch appearances, some are practically sure to take the form of deceased\npersons known to the percipient. In cases of this kind, there is no\ncoincidence with any external reality, such as we have held to constitute\na proof of an objective origin in the case of certain phantasms of the\nliving,. and very stringent conditions would ha\"e to be fulfilled before\nwe should be justified in assigning to the phenomenon any cause\nexternal to the percipient's own mind.\nThere is a curious point, however, which deserves very careful\nnotice; namely, tha.t a disproportionate number of these post-mortem\nappearances follow closely after death. In cases where the fact of\nthe death is known to the percipient, this seems easily explicable;\nbecause his thoughts may be supposed to have been emotionally\nexercised with the subject. But we have a number of cases where the\nfact of the death was unknown to the percipient at the time of his\nexperiences. Many of these-those, namely, when the interval after\ndeath was under 12 hours-were published in P\/U1\/ntaBms of tl~ Living\n-on the hypothesis that the impression was actually conveyed to the\npercipient at the moment or before the moment of the death, but that\nit had remained latent in his mind, and had only after an interval\nemerged into consciousness and projected itself in sensory form. But\nthis is only a hypothesis-one resting on a certain amount of evidence\nand needing careful consideration, but by no means to be assumed as\ncertain. And there are other cases, where the interval between the\ndeath and the a.ppearance was longer, to which the hypothesis of\nlatency seems decidedly inapplicable. It seems, therefore, that the\nalternative hypothesis-that the condition of the phenomenon on the\nagent's side (be it psychical or physical) is one which only comes into\nexistence at a distinct interval after death, and that the percipient\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb., 11188.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 221\nreally is impressed at the moment, and not before the moment, when\nhe is conscious of the impression-is one that must be steadily kept\nin view.\nThe cases where the appearance or impression shortly followed the\ndeath (like all other cases where the percipient of a phantasm has\nrecognised in it some dead person) fall under two heads, which we may\ndistinguish as the perBooal and the local. That is to say, the experience\neither befalls some person who has been linked with the deceased by\nclose ties; or iii befalls some one in a. place in which the deceased, when\nalive, was strongly interested. (The remainder of the paper was\noccupied with the reading and brief discussion of some cases of both\nclasses, most of which have already appeared in the Jowrnal.)\nMEETINGS OF THE COUNCIL.\nA Meetingof the Council was held on the 28th ofJanuary, Professor\nSidgwick taking the Chair, and an interim Meeting was held on the\n4th of February, for the formal completion of some of the business.\nAt one or both of these Meetings the following Members were\npresent :-Professor H.

This was referred to the Finance Committee, who were\nrequested to prepare an estimate of receipts and expenditure for the\ncurrent year.\nIt was agreed that a General Meeting should be held the second\nweek in April.

CHARLES RICHET ON\nTELEPATHIC HYPNOTISl\\1.1\nThe phenomena of Telepathic Hypnotism or sommeil adistance have\nbeen especially studied in the case of a subject, Madame B., while she\nhas been living in Havre. Thefirst record of these observations was\nmade by Professor Pierre Janet in Bulletins de la Societe de Psycho-\nlogie Physiologique, 181$5, Tome L,p. 24, and Tome II. (1886), p. 76.\nSome further experiments made by Mr. F. W. H. :Myers at Havre in\nApril, 1886, are detailed in his paper on \" Telepathic Hypnotism\" in\nProceedings ofthe Societyfor Psychical Research, X., 126 (October, 1886),\nand the large proportion of successes obtained on the whole under very\ncareful observation attracted considerable attention to the experiments.\nIn December, 1886, Madame B. came to stay with M. X. in Paris,\nand in January, 1887, M. Charles Richet had full opportunities\nof testing the effects which he could himself produce at a distance,\nwhen the conditions were entirely under his own control. The\nresults he obtained. he has published in RevU8 de l'Hypnotisme,\nFebruary 1st, 1888, pp. 225-240, and they contain so much that is of\nhigh interest and importance that it would seem appropriate to\nreproduce them here in resume.\nWhen Madame B. had come to M. X.'s house in Paris, December\n28th, 1886, M. Richet thought it best to begin by hypnotising her in the\nordinary fashion for 13 days in succession before trying any telepathic\nexperiments. She was a good subject, and full control was easily\ngained. He hypnotised her, as a rule, in the afternoon, some time between\n3.30 and 6.30, and kept her asleep for several hours. The house where she\nwas living was about half-a-mile from his own.\nEXPERIMENT I.-On Ja.nuary 12th he went out towards M. X.'s\nhouse at 9.10 a.m. with the intention of hypnotising Madame B. before\n1 A brief account of these experiments was given by M. Richet himself\nin the Journal for October, 1887.\n\fFeb.,I888.] Jo'Umal of Society for Psychical hsearch. 223\nhe saw her. He had told no one of his intention. On reaching her room,\nat 9.30 a.m., he found her awake, said he wanted to speak to M. X.,\nand went out with him. In the afternoon when he was with Madame\nB. and had hypnotised her as usual, she said she had felt tired\nall day, and added, without; any suggestion on his part, that she began\nto feel sleepy 20 minutes before he came in the morning, and that\nher drowsiness was because he had been thinking of it as he came. This was\nnot a success inasmuch as she had not gone to sleep,and her remark may pos-\nsibly have been suggested by seeing him at such an unusual hour, but there\nwas some encouragement to be drawn from it.\nEXPERIMENT n.-He thought it best to draw lots to settle the day and\nhourof his experiments; this fixed the next experiment for Friday, January\n14th, 3 p.m. On coming out of his physiological laboratory about &mile\nfrom Ma.da.me B., at 3.10 p.ID., he turned his attention to putting her to sleep\nuntil 3.45. He then went into the house, found she was out a.nd had been\nout for an hour, and waited for her return. She returned at 3.51 and said\nto C., who opened the door, before she knew of M. Richet's presence\nin the house, \u2022\u2022 I can't get on: my legs are trembling so.\" She was then\ntold M. Richet was there, but there was nothing surprising in that, for it\nwas his usual time for a visit. He put her to sleep as usual and then she\ntold him, without any questions asked, that 20 minutes before she had\ngot home she felt very uncomfortable, could not tell what she was looking\nat in a shop, and turned quickly to come hume in fear she would fall and be\nrun over, her legs were so unsteady. It was not like anything else she had\nfelt. On the whole this experiment deserves to be cOllsidered as only a.\npartial failure.\nEXPBRIMENT IlL-He had given Madame B. almost distinctly to\nunderstand that he would not hypnotise her 011 Saturda.y, January 15th.\nHowever, when he got home he changed his mind amI made the attempt.\nfrom ILl to 11.8 a..m. He reached M. X.'s house at 12.28 p.m., and\non inquiry lesrnt that Madame B. had been in a sleepy state, of which\nshe could recollect very little, from 11.5 a.m. up:;o noon. It was in fact a.\npartial but not perfect success.\nEXPERIMENr IV.-On Monday, January 17th, &n attempt made from\n11.51 a.m. to 12.4 p.m. produced no result at all, either iu action at the\ntime or in description under subsequent hypnotism. Madame B. had\nhad a bad night and was not feeling well.\nExpERIMENr V.-un Tuesday, January18th, another attemptfrom 11.15\nto 11.25 a.m. produced no result. M. Richet's attention was a good deal\ndisturbed when he had been trying to concentrate it.\nExpBRIMENT VI.-On Wednesday, January 19th, an attempt was made\nfrom 9.11 to 9.26 a.m. ; and during the day, from 1.15 to 1.40 p.m., M.\nRichet talked over his experiment with a friend and showed him how he set\nabout it. He went to M. X.'s house at 5.10 p.m. and found Madame\nB. in a somnambulic state. She told him that whenshe was dressing in the\nmorning she felt a sudden headache. She finished dressing and went down-\natairs, but the headache go worse and she went back to her room and lay on\nDigitized by Google\n\f224 JO'U'r'IUll of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1888.\nher bed. From the evidence of the other members of the household she muat\nhave gone downstairs about 9.20, and it is likely the headache began about\n9.13 a.m. She wa.a found at noon lying on her bed, saying she was tired and\ncould not manage to go down. This was the first time such a thing had\nhappened to her in Paria, and they were surprised to see her come down\nat 1.35 p.m. in a somnambulic state. She made her excuse by sayingM. Richet\nhad put her to sleep at 1.30 and had ordered her downstairs at 1.35. She\nlay asleep during the afternoon ou a sofa, saying she had orders to wait for\nhim. This was a partial succeaa; she had felt some influence when he first\ntried to act on her at 9.11 a.m., and she had passed into a somnambulicstate\na.t 1.35, when he Wlia showing his method of procedure to his friend.\nExpERnlENTVII.-This was on the whole the most successful experi-\nment. On Friday, January 21st, he wa.a very busy and did not reaoh M.\nX.'s house till 6.10 p.m. He found Madame B. tired, and as he was in\na. hurry he said he would not put her to sleep that day. At the time\nhe spoke he genuinely meant what he said, and Madame B. took him as\nspeaking in good faith, for she was a little annoyed and saidthat ifhe did not\nwant her she would go home the day after to-morrow. After she had left\nthe room the idea struck him that he would try to put her to sleep tele-\npathically nevertheless. He pretended to go out, slammed the front door,\nand slipped noiselesaly into the drawing-room, which wa.a separated from\nMadame B. by the hall and the dining-room. He told Madame X. his\nsecret but ordered her not to speak on any account to Madame B. or to\nC., and not to allow them to see her. From 6.20 p.m. onwards he tried\n.to induce sleep in Madame B. at a distance. A.t 6.25 he heard her go\nupstairs; at &.34 he requested Madame X. to tell C. to aalr Madame\nB. to come downstairs. C. had no idea he was not gone. At 6.38\nMadame B. came down and went into the kitchen. From 6.42 to\n6.56 M. Richet concentrated his attention again on putting her to sleep.\nAbout 6.45 Madame B., when talking to C. in the kitchen, said she felt\nsleepy and tremulous. To avoid sleep she put her hands into cold\nwater, a proceeding she had on some previous occasions found effective;\nbut this time it was not adequate, and after five minutes she lay down on\nthe kitchen table, and Madame X. whl) came into the kitchen for me\n:first time at 6.52, found her there in a somnambulic sleep. M. ltichet\nfollowed at 6.55 and she said to him, \"Why have you not waited Y I was\njust coming into the drawing-room because you were calling me Y\" This was\nto M. Richet the most valuable and convincing of the experiments. Madame\nX., who was the only person who knew of his presence, had not seen\nMadame B. from 6.20 to 6.52; she had spoken once to C., but had\nItiven herno clue whatever. The weak points in the experiment were that\nM. Richet had on all the other days but this been in the habit of hypnotis-\ning Madame B. at various times between 3.30 and 6.30, and that it was\neonceivable she might have come to know of his presence by some unex-\nplained means.\nExPBRnIENT VIII.-On Saturday and Sunday, January 22nd and 23rd,\nno attempt at telepathic hypnotism was made, and M. Riohet found her\nwide awake when he called. On Monday, 24th, he resolved to try again, and\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb., 1888.1 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 225\ntho time detennined by lot was 2 p.m. That happened to be a particularly\ninconveruent time, and one when she would have very little expectation of\nseeing him. From 1.38 to 1.50 p.m. he gave his thoughts to it; at\n2.5 he reached Madame X.'s house, entered quietly with a latch-key, and\nasked Madame X. to look for Madame B. She was found in light\nlomnambulic sleep in the workroom. From 2.5 to 2.15 he tried to\nput her to sleep more deeply, without succeBl. At 2.15 Madame X. brought\nher intO the drawing-room with her eyes shut, stumbling over the pieces of\nfurniture; M. Richot watched her from a small back room adjacent for five\nminutes, trying to induce her to come to him, but she sat where Madame\nX. had placed her and did not move. At :t20 he came out and spoke to her,\nand she said she had been put to sleep by him at 1.20. That was before his\nattempt had begun, but there was good reason to think her time inaccurate.\nShe had gono into the workroom at 1 p.m. to mend a stocking, and when\nshe was waked she admitted that the amount of wurk she had done must\nhave taken her three-quarters of an hour. If she had gone to sleep at 1.45\nthat would have coincided with his attempt to influence her. The ex-\nperiment on thewhole was a partial succeB8. but incomplete inasmuch as he\ncould not attract her to the small back room where he was, and that her\nsomnambulic sleep was not nearly so deep as was usually produced when\nhe was in contact with her.\nExPBRIMENT IX.-On Tuesday, January 25th, he made no trial from a\ndistance, but called at M. x.'s house at 3 p.m., and found Madame\nB. in 80mnambulic sleep of an abnormal type. She did not answer him\nat first or Madame X. Her eyes were half shut and fixed constantly on\nthe back of a gold watch which had been given to her the day before. When\nhe had touched her forehead and closed her eyes she said that it was the'\nwatch which had put her to sleop, and begged to be forbidden to look at it\nin future. At 6.50 he waked her, said good-bye, and pretended to go away,\nbut in reality stayed and tried to put her to sleep from 6.55 to 7.10. This\nproduced no perceptible result. The condition which fullowed upon gazing at\nthe back of the gold watch was like that which Braid has described as con-\nsequent on fixing the eyes on a bright object.\nTwo other experiments were made by M. Pierre janet in M. Richet's\npresence at Havre on Madame B. ill September, 1886, and have not\nhitherto been published. In the first, when lunching together at noon, they\nagreed that M. Janet should put Madame B. to sleep at about 3.30\np.m. He was more than half-a-mile from Madame B., and made the\nattempt from 3.33 to 3.45. They went together to her house, which they\nreached at 4 p.m., and found her hypnotised. She said to M. Janet, \" You\nput me to sleep at half-past three \"; which was nea.rly accurate. The\nsecond trial was next day, from 3 to 3.12 p.m. M. Richet went alone to the\nhouse at 4 p.m. and found her asleep, and learnt from Mademoiselle Gibert\nthat she had been awake at 3 p.m., and was probably asleep about 3.15\nor 3.20.\nThis series of observations M. Richet wishes to subject to strict criticism.\nThe hypothesis of roZuntary deception by Madamo B. he rejects as re-\nceiving no support from the long watching and examination by M. Janet,\nDigitized by Google\n\f226 JO'Urnal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1888.\nM. Gibert, M. X., and himself. It is at any rat~ as certain as the\nbOlla jidu of M. J met, M. Gibert, and himself. That expectant attention\nor auto-suggestion might produce BUch results he fully admits, but contends\nthat pre,-ious knowledge of the dayand hour would be necessary for that, and\nthat such knowledge was impoBBible in the cases he counts as BucceSBful. A\ncompanson of the times adopted by the operator and the times of the sleep\neffected shows that on an average the effect followed about 10 minutes after\nthe beginning of the distant attempt. It is interesting to observe that in the\n10 cases ill which M. Janet can claim similar effects the average interval\nhas been nine minutes.\nHe suggests four po8Iible hypotheses of explanation:-\n(1) Chance. (2) Deliberate cheating. (3) Expectant attention.\n(4) A real telepathic influence.\nAs to chance, he remarks that in all the 22 cases of BucceBB that\nhe and M. Pierre Janet together have met with the sleep does not precede\nbut follows the attempted influence. The chance against that would be the\n8ame as against tossing \"heads\" 25 times running, viz. :-500,000\nto one. The facts, however, may perhaps be regarded as not so absolutely\ncertain as to warrant this application of the calculus of probabilities. Sup-\nposing it might be assumed that the choice of a time for 8Omnambulio\nsleep must be taken between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., this would give about\n21 periods of 25 minutes each. It would then be 21 to one against t.he\nchance that his attempt would coincide within 25 minutes of Madame\nB.'s sleep. Now, out of nine trials he had six successes. The probability\nagainst that by chance would be 500,000to one. That isabout the same chance,\nsays M. Richet, as that I shall die in the next 10 minutes, and does not de-\nserve any attention; the interesting point is the accuracy of the ex-\nperiments.\nThe hypothesis of deliberate cheating may be diamiaaed for the reasons\npreviously given.\nThe hypothesis of expectant attention needs very careful consideration.\nThat no previous hint should be given such as a hypnotised person may catch\nrequires minute care. M. Richet feela this strongly; he hopes and believes\nhe has avoided these difficultiea, but he cannot be absolutely certain. Thoso\nwho can be absolutely certa.in of what they say are very lucky men. If he\nwere one of them this question of telepathic hypnotism would be now\ndecided. But taking thinga as he is obliged to take them, he would give his\nverdict that either his observations h\"ve been very incomplete and very un-\ntrustworthy or else thero is really such a thing as telepathic action. This is\nthe conclusion of his reason, but it is not sufficiently in aecord with his\ngeneral habit of thought to be as yet received as a mnl faith. Still, why\nshould action at a distance be so difficult a hypothesis 7 Is it not'the hypo-\nthesis of gravity and of magnetism 7 We are 80 familiar with thom that ...8\nthink them easy, but for all that we do not understand them. In this\nmatter of telepathy we have no other hypothesis open to us, but we need\nmore experiments to drive conviction home.\nA.T.M.\nDigitized by Google\n\fFeb., 1888.J Jou\/rnal oj Society for P8ychical Re8earch. 227\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nDEAR SIR,-In the January number of the Society for Psychical Research\nJournal.

This happened at a\nvillage on the frontier, Berzanges-la-Petite. The girl was brought to me, in\norder that I might calm her nerves, which had been over-excited by the hidden\nassaults of which she had been the object. M.

It recommenced\nin an intensified form, and they actually called in the police to protect the\ngirl, and the members of the force who were sent made a report which\neonfirmed the previous information.
