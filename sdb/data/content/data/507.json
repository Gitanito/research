Secreto\/fY.\nAt the close of the last Report a series of experiments were recorded\nillustrating the reproduction of drawings without any discernible com-\nmunication passing between the Agent, Mr. Blackburn, who had\nmomentarily seen the drawing made by one .of us, and the Percipient,\nMr. G. A. Smith, who was blindfolded throughout the experiment. In\nthese early experiments Mr. Smith held Mr. Blackburn's hand for a\nfew moments, and then, releasing it, drew his impression of the figure.\nIn this way we obtained a rough, but recognisable, reproduction of the\nnine figures which we had drawn. The figures and the reproductions\nare published in Part II. of our Proceedings. We have now to record\na further extension of our inquiry in this direction, the experiments\nbeing made under conditions still more stringent than those at first\nimposed. We have also endeavoured to ascertain how far the curious\ninversion of the figures, which had been noticed in the descriptions but\nnot in the pencil reproductions of the drawings, was accidental or\notherwise.\nAt the invitation of the Committee, Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Smith\n[* THE CoUNOIL HOLDS ITSELF GENERALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPORTS OF iTS COMMITTEES.\nAT THE HEAD OF EACH REPORT THE NAHES OF THOSIII MElIIBlIiRS OF COllllllIT!rEE WHO ARE\nSPECIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS COMPOSITION ARE MARKED WITH ASTERISKS.)\nigitized by Googl\n\f162 Tltird Report on Tkougltt-Transference. [April 24,\ncame from Brighton in January last, and met us at the rooms of the\nSociety in Dean's Yard, where all the experiments about to be described\nwere conducted. As Mr. Blackburn came only in answer to the urgent\nrequest of the Committee, and at considerable inconvenience to himself.\nwe feel it our duty to mention this fact, and, at the same time,\u00b7 to\nexpress our hearty obligations to him for the unrecompensed trouble\nwhich we have so frequently imposed upon him.\nIt is almost needless to point out that in these observations, so foreign\nto our common experience, it is indispensable to be minutely careful\nand conscientious in recording the exact conditions of each experiment.\nThis we have striven to be; and the reader will thus be enabled to form\nan independent judgment by making allowance for whatever mental bias\nhe may discover in our conclusions. He has thus, moreover, the means\nafforded him of detecting possible errors, or of suggesting precautio,ns\u00b7-\nwhich we may have overlooked.\nOur nwdus operandi is as follows : The Percipient, Mr. Smith, is\nseated blindfolded at a table in our own room; a paper and pencil are\nwithin his reach, and a member of the Committee is seated by his side.\nAnother member of the Committee leaves the room, and outside the\nclosed door draws some figure at random. Mr. Blackburn, who, so far.\nhas remained in the room with Mr. Smith, is now called out,\nand the door closed; the drawing is then held before him for\na few seconds, till its impression is stamped upon his mind.\nThen, closing his eyes, Mr. Blackburn is led back into the room\nand placed standing or sitting behind Mr. Smith, at a distance\nof some two feet from him. A brief period of intense mental\nconcentration on Mr. Blackburn's part now follows. Presently, l\\fr.\u00b7Smith\ntakes up the pencil amidst the unbroken and absolute silence of all\npresent, and attempts to reproduce on paper the impression he has\ngained. He is allowed to do as he pleases as regards the bandage round\nhis eyes; sometimes he pulls it down before he begins to draw, but if\nthe figures be not distinctly present to his mind, he prefers to let it\nremain on, and draws fragments of the figure as they are perceived.\nDuring all this time, Mr. Blackburn's eyes are, generally, firmly closed\n(sometimes he requests us to bandage his eyes tightly as an aid to\nconcentration), and except when it is distinctly recorded, he has not\ntouched Mr. Smith, and has not gone in front of him, or in any way\nwithin his possible field of vision, since he re-entered the room.*\n*This precaution was not attended to in the experiments of one afternoon;\nbut these experiments, and these alone, are omitted from the series disc1l88ed\nbelow, as having been rendered nugatory through accidental circumstances which\n'were calculated to exercise, and obviously did exercise, a distracting effect on Mr.\nBlackburn'. mind.\nigitized byGoogl\n\f1883.] Third Report on TkOtegkt-Tramiference. 163\nWhen Mr. Smith has drawn what he can, the original drawing,\nwhich has so far remained outside the room, is brought in, and\n1:ompared with the reproduction. Both are marked by the Committee\n-and put away in a secure place. The drawings and reproductions,\n. :given at the end of the Report, are in every case fac-similes of the\nuntouched originals, from which they have been photographed on the\nwood blocks. .\nThe experiments began on January 19th, 1883, and were continued\nfor three or four days in succession. During this series of experiments\na. considerable number of drawings were made, nearly all of which\nwere exhibited at the following General Meeting. Another series of\n~xperiments were made in April. All the drawings may be seen at the\n_.Society's rooms; but it has been thought needlessly expensive to\nreproduce the whole number here. ~ose which are omitted,\nhowever, are by no means failures, and in fact only 8\nexperiments, out of the total of 37, can be put down\n.as unsuccessful, Mr. Smith in 4 cases failing to see any-\nthing and in 4 cases giving so imperfect a representation that\nit might be called a failure. The first 4 figures were obtained after\nMr. Blackburn had for a few minutes grasped Mr. Smith's hand-a\nprocedure to which they were accustomed-as a supposed aid to Mr.\nSmith in visualising Mr. Blackburn's mental picture. We, however,\n1:ould allow no exception to our cardinal axiom on this subject, that no\nexperiment where contact of any sort is allowed can be decisive; and\nthough in the present instance the drawings were of\u00b7 such an\nirregular character that their description would have been extremely\ndifficult to convey by imperceptible tracing or by any subtle code of\npressure-signs, yet, assuming Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Smith to have\nbeen in collusion, the hypothesis was at least conceivable. Accordingly,\nwe requested Mr. Blackburn to dispense altogether with the preliminary\n- _ contact; and it must be understood that all the rest of the\nsuccessful drawings (with the exception of two, not here reproduced\nand of Fig. 13b as explained below) were done without any\ncontact whatever, in, the manner already indicated on p. 162. Down to\nFig. 9 we had made rude geometrical drawings; at this point, one\nmember of the Oommittee, without giving tke least indication of hiB\nintention, now drew Fig. 10 outside the room as usual. The grotesque\nreproduction by Mr. Smith is decidedly striking; and so also is the\nreproduction of the next figure, when Mr. Smith again apparently\nimagined that a geometrical figure had been drawn.\nIn some of the less accurate reproductions Mr. Blackburn com-\nplained of the difficulty he had in keeping the original drawing steadily\nin his mental view ; and on one or two occasions we asked Mr. Black-\nburn to draw his recollection of the picture simultaneously with Mr.\nDigitized by G@)<3gIe\n\f164 Third Report on Tkought-Traniference. [April24t\nSmith (the two, of course, being kept out of sight of each other). We\nfound that the main etTOrs in Mr. Smith's reproduction existed already\nin Mr. Blackburn's recollection of the drawing. . A striking illustration\nof this is given in Fig. 16, where the reproduction closely resembles\nMr. Blackburn's drawing of what he remembered. It is, in fact, by nQ\nmeans easy to keep vividly and correctly in mind for several\nminutes any irregular figure which has only been actually before the\neye for a few seconds. We tried one experiment to test the.effect of\nrefreshing Mr. Blackburn's memory. Fig. 13 was drawn by us; and\nits reproduction, Fig. 13&, was made by Smith, in the usual way. The\nreproduction is very imperfect, being a sinuous, instead of a spiral line.\n. No contact between the operators having so far occurred, we now asked\nMr. Blackburn to touch Smith's hand for a few moments; on releasing it\nthe reproduction, 13b, was obtained. Mr. Blackburn was now asked to--\nstand (as at first) behind Mr. Smith, who remained blindfolded. Ths\noriginal drawing was now brought into the room, and held in .front of\nMr. Blackburn's eyes, and, therefore, some distance from the back of\nSmith's head. The latter now made the reproduction, 13c, which is an\nexact copy of the original. We need hardly add that there were absolutely\nno means (such as mirrors, &c.) by which Smith, even if not blind-\nfolded, could have gained any glimpse of the drawing, and, as we have\nalready remarked, the most complete silence was preserved throughout\nthese experiments.\nWe have now to consider whether it was possible that any\ninformation of the character of the designs drawn could have reached\nSmith through the ordinary avenues of sense. Of the five recognised\ngateways of knowledge, four-tasting, smelling, touch, and sight-were\nexcluded by the conditions of the experiment. There remains the sense\nof hearing, which was but partially interfered with by the bandage over\nthe eyes and ears. But the information can certainly not have been\nconveyed by speech; our ears were as near to Mr. Blackburn as Mr.\nSmith's, and our eyes would have caught the slightest movement of his --\nlips.\nThere remains the hypothesis of a code, consisting of audible signa.ls.\nother than oral speech; and it would, no doubt, be an exaggeration to\naffirm that the possibility of such signals was absolutely excluded. We\nshall endeavour so to vary the conditions of subsequent experiments as.\nto exclude this hypothesis completely: at present we will only point out\nthe very great improbabilities which it involves, quite independently of\nour reliance on the integrity of Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Smith, which\nnothing has occurred to shake in the slightest degree.\nLet our readers, who may be familiar with the Morse or any other\ncode of signals, try in some such way to convey a description of some of\nour drawings, to a friend who is blindfolded and has not seen the original ;.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.J TMrd Report on Thought-Transference. 165\nwe venture to assert that, even if audible signs were allowed, several\nxninutes at least would be required to convey the notion of the figures\n(lorrectly. It is probably no exaggeration to say that several scores, if\nnot hundreds, of precise signs would be required to convey an idea as\nexact as that implied in many of Mr. Smith's representations. But in\nour experiments what sort of range existed for this mode of communica-\ntion 1 The material for possible signs appears to be reduced to\nshuffling on the carpet, coughing, and modes of breathing. Anything\ndistinctly unusual in any of these directions must inevitably have been\nnoticed; and since our attention, during this part of the experiment, was\nof course concentrated on the relation between Mr. Blackburn and Mr.\nSmith we are at a loss to conceive how any signalling, sufficient in\namount to convey the required ideas, could have passed undetected.\n-.Furthermore, it must be observed that the reproductions were not made\nin a tentative,_ hesitating manner as if waiting for signals; but\ndeliberately and continuously as if copying a drawing that is seen.\nMoreover, in almost every instance the proportions of the different\nparts of the original figure were reproduced more accurately than\nwere its more easily describable details. However, with the view of\nremoving all doubts that might arise as to possible auditory com-\nmunications, we on one occasion stopped Mr. Smith's ears with putty,\nthen tied a bandage round his eyes and ears, then faste~ed a bolster-\ncase over the head, and over all threw a blanket which enveloped his\nentire head and trunk. Fig. 22 was now drawn by one of us, and shown\noutside the room to Mr. Blackburn, who on his return sat behind\nMr. Smith, and in no contact with him whatever, and as perfectly still\nas it is possible for a human being to sit who is not concentrating his\nattention on keeping motionless to the exclusion of every other object.\nIn a few minutes Mr. Smith took up the pencil and gave the\nsuccessive reproductions shewn below.\nTo profit by I!o code in this case, Mr. Smith would have had to\nextract the putty from his ears unobserved by us, (an action the possi-\nbility of which the heavy swathings rendered just conceivable,) and\nthen, still smothered in bolster-case and blanket, to detect periodic\nvariations in Mr. Blackburn's breathing imperceptible to us ; to identify\nthem as proceeding from Mr. Blackburn, and to interpret them into\na description of the figure given below. This hypothesis seems to us\nan extreme one, but, as we have already said, we intend to meet it by\nyet further varying and narrowing the conditions of future experiments.\nWe have now to describe some experiments which were undertaken\nto test whether the mental inversion of the object that had been noticed\nin some of the early trials was accidental or otherwise. Mr. Smith,\nhaving been carefully blindfolded, sat with his back to us, in a darkened\nroom-some heavy opaque curtains being between him and us.

In answer to the query, \"How is.\nthe arrow pointing t\" spoken by one of the Oommittee in a uniform\ntone of voice, Mr. Smith called out the direction as he mentally per.\nceived it.

Oounting these las~\nwe made in all 42 trials. In these the arrow was held in a per-\npendicular position, up or down, 23 times; and of these cases 20 were\nguessed rightly, 3 wrongly. It was held in a horizontal positio~\nright or left, 19 times; and of these cases 7 guessed rightly, 12\nwrongly. The three wrong guesses when the arrow was in a perpen-\ndicular position occurred after Mr. Blackburn had left us; and in these\ncases the error was not one of inversion. Of the 12 wrong guesses, when\nthe arrow was held horizontally, 8 were lateral inversions of the\nposition of the arrow, as if it were seen in a mirror. Hence we see\nthat 87 per cent. of the answers were correct for the perpendicular\np:>sition, and barely 37 per cent. for the horizontal position; and, further,.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.] Third Report on Tkougkt-Tranverence. . 167\nthat it was about an even chance, when the arrow was horizontal,\nwhether the image' was described as laterally inverted or not.*\nThe interest which this subject is exciting throughout the country\nleads us to hope that experiments in various directions may be made\nwherever anyone shows indications of possessing the percipient faculty.t\nExperiments are of value even when they do not point to thought-\ntransference, as long as the nature of the conditions is accurately\nnoted. Thus, among others, the Rev. E. H. Sugden, B.Sc., of Bradford,\nhas, by practice, developed an acute power of sense perception whereby\nhe can write down any number thought of by following (according to\nhis own account) the unconscious indications given by the thinker. At\nthe same time, Mr. Sugden, while fully convinced of the possibility of\ngenuine thought-transference without contact, expressly asserts the\n--- necessity of that condition for his results: hence his experiments and\nexplanations, which are admirably clear and well-described, testify to\nthe accuracy of the distinction prefixed by us to our second Report.\n(Proc.

Although the proportion of success was then greater\nthan subsequently, those trials were undertaken before the joint inquiry\ncommenced, and bCfore precision in our methods and records had been\nattained.\nAll these experiments were made with the Misses Creery. It may\nbe noted that the power of these children, collectively or separately,\ngradually diminished during these months, so that at the end of 1882 they\ncould not do, under the easiest conditions, what they could do under the\nmost stringent in 1881. This gradual decline of power seemed quite\nindependent of the tests applied, and resembled the disappearance of a\ntransitory pathological condition, being the very opposite of what might\nhave been expected from a growing proficiency in code-communication.\nHaving above exhibited the results of a long series of experiments\nwhere collusion was out of the question, we subjoin in the next table a\ngeneral summary of our results, shewing the insufficiency of mere\n_ chance coincidences as an explanation.

But excluding\nthese, and confining ourselves to the first responses o'llly, 21 per\ncent. were correctly answered. Pure chance would have given\ncertainly less than from one to two per cent.\nAs the chances of hitting by pure guesswork on a fictitious name,\ninvented by one of us, would be at least one to many thousands, and as\nnone of the chances were less than 1 to 50, we may roughly say that if\npure guesswork only were concerned, we should not have had more\nthan :-\n1 quite right in 100 trials :\n-' .' whereas our experiments showed we had, if the first responses only\nbe allowed,\n1 quite right in 41 trials.\nIn these results we have not included our recent experiments on the\nreproduction of drawings. Here obviously an incalculable number of\ntrials might be made, at any rate in the case of the more random and\neccentric figures, before pure guesswork would hit upon a resemblance\n, as near as that obtained in almost every case by Mr. G.

But we venture to assert that the\ncumulative character of the evidence which we have now amassed,\nand the extent to which we have eliminated the hypotheses of\ncollusion, chance coincidence, and muscle or sign-reading, render\nour claim to have established the reality of this novel class of\nphenomena a very strong one. We continue carefully to consider\nall adverse criticism; but we venture to think that much of it really\ndepends on an Ii priori presumption of impossibility which, natural\nthough it may be, cannot of course be legitimately opposed to\npositive evidence.\nHitherto, we have confined our inquiry to Cases where the subject\nis in his or her normal waking state.

F. BARRETT, F.R.S.E.if.; EDMUND GURNEY, M.A.if.;\nFREDERIC W. H. MYERS, M.Aif.; HENRY N. RIDLEY, M.A., F.L.S.;\nW. H. STONE, M.A., M.B.; GEORGE WYLD, M.D.; and FRANK\nPODMORE, B.A,if. lIon. Secretary.\n--..... The work which lies before the Committee on Mesmerism differs,\nto some extent, from that appropriated to other Committees of this\nSociety. In most of the subjects which we have included under\nthe designation of \"Psychical Research,\" the ground was so inade-\u00b7\nquately explored as to afford no basis for any confident scientific\ninduction. In mesmerism, on the other hand, the investigators have\nbeen both numerous and intelligent; the ground has been tra-\nversed and retraversed; the literature of the subject already forms a\nsmall library, and the evidence, if impartially studied, appears to be\nharmonious, and on many points cQmplete. Nevertheless, if we turn\nfrom the advocates of mesmerism to our natural guides on such subjects,\nwe find that scientific writers, both at home and abroad, have united in\nridiculing the pretensions of the mesmerists-at first attributing all the\nphenomena to trickery and delusion, and subsequently admitting many\nof the facts, but explaining them as within the domain of well-recognised\npsychological or physiological laws. And if we compare the scientific\nutterances of to-day with those of half a century back, we shall see\nthat the discredit of mesmerism, as such, has been distinctly on the\nincrease. True, the orthodox s!;ientific attitude was never anything\nbut hostile. Thus, in 183~, the then leading medical organ, edited\nby Sir John Forbes, wrote as follows: \"Considering the high\nsanction which even a temporary belief in the powers of animal\nmagnetism has obtained in this country, we look upon its recent\nprogress, and its abrupt and shameful fall, as calculated to degrade\nthe profession. English practitioners are now ashamed\nof the very name.\" But the scepticism was not entirely thorough-\ngoing; for, six years later, the same journal remarked: \"Mesmerism\nhas hardly received fair play at the hands of many of our professional\nbrethren, and its pretensions are too wcll supported to justify an\nopposition made up almost exclusively of ridicule and contempt.\nWe think it is proved, or, to say the least, we think it to be\nigitized byGoogl\n\f218 Fi1'8t Report of tke Oommittee on,Me8meri8m, [April 24,\nmade in the highest degree probable, that there is a reality in the simple\nphenomena of mesmerism;\" and the writer ends by declaring \"his full\nbelief in the reality of so~e of the facts which have often been set down\nas sheer delusion or imposture.\"* But this opinion has not been shared\nby later authorities in medicine or physiology. Dr. Carpenter, for\ninstance, \"does not hesitate to express the conviction, based on long,\n'protracted, and careful examination of the evidence adduced to prove\nthe existence of a mesmerio force, acting independently of the con-\nsciousness of the ' subject,' that there is none which possesses the least\nclaim to acceptance as scientific truth. * * * Mesmerisers who\nassert they could send particular individuals to sleep have altogether\nfailed to do so when the ' su~illcts' were carefully kept from any\nsuspicion that such will was being e:icercised.. * * * Nothing is\nmore easy than to explain the peculiar rapport between the mesmeI'i.wr~\nand his 'subject' on the principle of dominant ideas.\"t And in\nhis published lectures on \"Mesmerism, &c.,\" Dr. Carpenter draws\na broad line of distinction between the phenomena of induced som-\nnambulism, which he admits to be now a recognised physiological\ncondition, and the alleged facts of mesmerism, such as the \"rappOT't n\nbetween the mesmerist and his subject, their community of sensation,\nthe induction of general or local anresthesia (so far as this is not de-\npendent on suggested ideas), the effluence of any peculiar power from\nthe mesmerist, &c., &c.\nAnd this leads us to a most important observation, namely, that the\nmain cause of the increasing incredulity and contempt shown towards\nmesmerism, as such, has been, not an error, but a truth, or at least a\npartial truth,-the discovery, namely, of a real means of explaining\nmany of the facts, without resorting to any\" mesmeric.\" hypothesis.\nThe credit of this discovery is due to a countryman of our own, the late\nMr. Braid, whose name deserves a wider reputation than it has received.\nHe sh~wed, by a long and admirable series of experiments, that mere\nfixation of the eyes in a strained position was often enough to throw\nthe subject into a condition in which many of the phenomena attributed\nto mesmeric influence could be easily produced. Similar experiments\nhave been lately conducted by Professor Heidenhain, of Breslau, whose\nconclusions are decidedly in advance of anything contained in the\nstandard treatises on physiology.t His explanation wholly rejects\n\u2022 Briti,', and libreign Medical R8'l:i81V, 1845, pp. 440 and 485.\nt Mental Physiology, 2nd Edition, pp. 619-623.\nt A summary of the views advanced by Heidenhain is to be found in Dr.\nMcKendrick's article on Mesmerism in the E'IIC1Jo. Brit. Ninth Edit. Other\nimportant psycho-physiological investigations into this hypnotio state are being\ncarried on in America, France, Italy, and Germany, as well as in our own country.\nWe hope to notice these on a future occasion.\nDigitized by GoogIe\n\f1883.J -First Report 0\/ the fJommittee on Mesmerism. 211)\n\"expectant attention,\" \"dominant ideas,\" and all mental factors what-\nsoever, and refers the phenomena to what is practically a wide ex~nsion\nof the range of \"reflex action.\" He conceives that, in the hypnoti~\ncondition, stimulation by word or gesture of the lower sensory centres\nin the \"'subject's\" brain, instead of passing on in the usual way to ,the-\nhigher portion of that organ and there giving rise to consciousnf'ss\nand volition, passes by a direct path to the hnmediate centres of\nmotion, and there gives rise to automatic responses, which may take the-\nform of mimicry or of unconscious carrying out of simple orders. In\nhis view, the opening of this direct path, with its result of a certain\nand involuntary response, is due to inltibition, brought about by mono--\ntonous sensory impressions of the functions of those 'higher cortical\ncentres which a.I'!3 associated with choice and reasoning, and which\n-'\"lnmnally control the lower motor centres. It will thus be evident that\nanything of the nature of a specific efHuence or influence in mesmerism\nis rejected in our day by Heidenhain, as it was by Braid 40 years\nago. Hypnotism or 'induced somnambulism, whethel accompanied by\nconsciousness or not, has been regarded as covering tl'8 wltole ground~\nand thus, in proportion as it has become more and more orthodox to\nadmit many of the facts commonly known as \"mesmeric,\" has it become-\nmore and more heretical to attribute them to \"mesmeric agencies.\"\nThis point in the history of the subject is of such prime importance-\nthat a brief reference to' it was absolutely indispensable. We do not,\nhowever, propose to enter at present upon anything like a historica)-\nsurvey. Such a task needs, indeed, to be accomplished; but it would\nrequire much more space than could fitly be devoted to it in this Report.\nWe will content ourselves with a single remark; namely, that the great\ndivergences in the conclusions reached by different observers,-say, by\nthe first French Commission as contrasted with the second,. or by Dr-\nCarpenter as contrasted with Dr. Elliotson or (we may add) with\n__Heidenhain-are by no means necessarily to be attributed either\nto prejudice on the one side or to credulity on the other. It\nseems to us that the champions of the different sides, who have bandied\nthese terms so freely, have generally failed to realise the immense-\nvariety of the phenomena which these abnormal states present to our\nstudy, and have been too apt to assume the completeness of their\nown particular observations. And the conflict of opinion which prevails\nat any rate renders the duty of this Committee doubly clear, viz., ~\nsubmit the whole subject to renewed and careful experiment. If, as we-\nhave hinted, the differences of previous observers have largely depended\n* The first was appointed to inveBtigate and report on mesmerism in 1784 j.\nthe second reported in 1825.

[April 24,\n~n the limited scope (or on the varying luck) of their observations,\nthat is the most cogent reason for making the basis of our inductions as\n'Complete as possible.\nFrom what has been said, it will readily be understood that the\nterm \"l1z.e8'llUriSfn,\" which occurs in the title of the Committee, and\nwhich will be used throughout this Report, has been selected as\nthe most general description, and not as involving any theory, or\npledging us to any particular explanation of tht' facts, such as is\n2uggested, e.g., in the terms animal magnetism or electro-biology.\nBut while for convenience sake we have adopted the most general\nname, we must state at once that we anticipate, as we advance, the\nnecessity of limiting and specialising the meaning of the word\n'.. mesmerism.\" For since the term '~hypnotism,\" as just explained,\nis confined to phenomena which may bt' produced without 0..-\n.special injluenc, or e.f!lttence passing from the operator to the subjec~\nand has been adopted as a complete designation of these phenomena\nby those who emphatically deny that any such influence or effluence\n'Can exist, it will be natural for us, if we come across further facts to\nwhich the \"hypnotic\" hypothesis proves inapplicable, to describe\nthese facts as par excellence \"mesmeric.\" And, as we have seen, it\nwould be no unfair description of these two classes of alleged pheno-\nmena, to say that the line between them is the line which, so far, recog-\nnised science has not overstepped : by the science of this country, at\n.any rate, at the present day, \" ,hypnotism\" is pretty widely acknowledged,\n.and \"mesmerism\" almost universally rejected.\nBefore recounting our more consecutive experiments, we ought to\nmention that we have tried on several occasions to influence various\npersons-boys of from 12 to 20 years old, in the manner described\nby Braid, but, hitherto, with little success. The method is as follows:\nThe person to be operated on is placed in a comfortable position\nin a chair. Perfect silence is observed, and every precaution is taken\nnot to distract the attention of the patient. He is then bidden to\u00b7\nlook at a coin, or other bright object, held about 15 inches from hia\nforehead, in such a position as to produce in his eyes a slight inward and\nupward squint. Braid states that he found the great majority of the\npersons on whom he operated susceptible to this method. We, on the\n-other hand, have only had even partial success in one case, that of\nMr. W. North, late lecturer at Westminster Hospital. As a. full\n.account of this experiment will be published elsewhere, it will be\nsufficient here to state that Mr. North, after gazing intently for\nupwards of half-an-hour at a. bright copper disc, succeeded in\nbringing himself into a condition in which some of the phenomena\n-observed by Braid and Heidenhain were successfully demonstrated,\nnamely, (partial) insensibility to pain, extreme muscular irrita-\nDigili!'ed by Google\n\f, ,\n1883.J First Report oj the Oommittee on Mesmerism. 221\nbility, and a deadening of the mental faculties. Equally charae--,'\nteristic was Mr. North's very,imperfect subsequent recollection of what,\nhad taken place.\nBut the rest of the phenomena here described were preceded by the\nconditions ordinarily associated with mesmeric in.flutlnce. They were\nobserved, for the most part, in a willing and intelligent young man or\n20, Fred Wells by name-the son of a baker in Brighton. Othe~\nyouths have also been tried, and some are now under experiment. The\noperator in every case has been Mr. R A. Smith, of Dulwich, S.E.,\nand lately of Brighton. Mr. Smith's method with his \"subjects\" is as.\nfollows: The subject is placed in a chair, with his hands in his lap..\nand he is told to direct his attention exclusively to a coin or other\nbright disc of metal, which is placed in his hands. Mr. Smith, mean-\n~hile, draws his hands, at intervals, slowly downwards across the,\nsubject's head and face, always in the same direction. His hands,\ngenerally, do not touch the surface of the skin, nor even approach very\nnear to it. ~fter a time varying from two to twenty minutes has been\nthus occupied, Mr. Smith raises the subject's head, closes the eyes, and\npresses his thumb on the forehead between the eyes. He then bids.\nhim open his eyes. If the boy succeeds in doing so without difficulty, '\nthe whole operation is repeated; and if on a second trial no effect is.\n;produced,'the su~ject is dismissed. But it not infrequently happens that\nthe boy, when told to open his eyes, finds himself unable to do so; ()~\nonly succeeds after many efforts. Mr. Smith then strokes the muscles.\nat the corner of the mouth; and, after a short interval, both eyes and\nmouth being closed, he is told to open them. If the subject is a good\none, he fails to do this, and it is very strange to watch the contortion of'\nhis features, and his evident vexation, whilst he endeavours to thwart.\nthe mysterious influence which has sealed his lips and eyes. This.\ncurious phenomenon was amusingly illustrated in the person of a friend\nof one of us, Mr. Harold Wolferstan, of Tavistock. Mr. Wolfenitan\n.had been brought into the mesmeric state by Miss Smith, sister of\"the\nMr. G. A. Smith above-mentioned, in the presence of Dr. lVlyers and\nMr. Podmore. Believing him to be, at the time, unconscious, these\ngentlemen were talking about him pretty freely; and it was not until Mr.\nW olferstan had been restored to his normal condition that they dis-\ncovered that he had heard the whole of the conversation, but had been\nunable to open his lips or make any other movement to shew his.\ninterest in it. On another occasion, a friend of ours, after subjection\nto the usual process, was left alone, apparently asleep, in an arm-\nchair, while the Committee turned their attention to other\n\"subjects.\" Meanwhile our friend awoke, but found himself\nunable to' move his limbs, and the first intimation which we had\nof his condition was the plaintive request, \"Please come and undo me.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\f'222 Fir8t Report of the Oommittee on Mesmerism. [April 24,\nInfluence of Suggestion.-When the \"subject\" has been rendered\n. \u00b7110 far amenable to the operator's manipulation, other singular\nphenomena may be observed. It is easy to make him the victim\no()f any hallucination which the fancy of those present may suggest.\n\"I'hat he is, for the time, really under the influence of the suggested\nidea, and genuinely believes what he is told, cannot be doubted,\n..at any rate after a sufficiently long and\u00b7 varied experience. To\n.suppose that the multifarious gestures and movements, performed in\n-1!upport of the characters which they are bidden to assume, are parts of a\n'conscious and deliberate scheme of deception, would be to attribute to\nthe half-educated boys who formed the subjects of these experiments, a\n-sustained capacity for acting a part, as well as rare genius for mimicry and\npower of self-control. Moreover, that the hallucination is, in most cases,\n..complete, is the more readily perceived by its incompleteness o~ certah>\"..\noccasions. Sometimes the reasoning faculties are but partially subdued,\n\u00b7and the boy offers a half incredulous resistance to the suggested\nimpression. A very striking instance of this kind was the follow.\nling. Mr. Smith dandled a handkerchief before a boy, telling\nhim that it was a baby. The boy listened, but half convinced, and\nsmiled incredulously. But he was gradually overcome by the idea\n.suggested, and taking the handkerchief, laid it carefully across his\narms, in orthodox nursery fashion. No sooner, however, did Mr.\nSmith divert his attention, than reason began to assert itself 8.oaain.\nThe boy discovered an unusual deficiency in his nursling ; he kept\nfurtively looking round, with most genuine anxiety and hopeless\n>bewilderment, to discover the head of his baby. In the midst of his\nperplexity he was recalled to his proper senses, and joined with us in\nlaughing at his own discomfiture.\nThe illusion, however, is generally untroubled by any doubts. On\n'One occasion, for example, Wells was given a candle, which he was\nassured was a sponge-cake. He broke it in pieces, remarking that it\nwas very stale, and actually ate about an inch and a-half of it. Shortly\ni8.fterwards, he began to feel the effects of his unusual meal; and, when\npressed, flatly declined to have any more of \"Mr. Gurney's sponge-\ncakes.\" On another occasion, he ate salt greedily, when told that it\nwas sugar; and rejected sugar in great haste under the impression that\nit was cayenne pepper. When white pepper was blown up his nostrils,\nhe being under the impression that it was mignonnette, not only did he\nnot sneeze, but his eyes did not water to any appreciable extent, a fact\nwhich was ascertained by opening the lids. Other experimentS inter-\nYened, and no sneezing occurred until some ten minutes afterwards,\nwhen he was given common salt, and told it was snuff. He smelt at it\n-and then sneezed violently, with the characteristic spasm, for some\nlittle time. He drank a spoonful of vinegar with much relish, believing\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.] Fir8t Beport oj tlte Oommittee on Me8merism.\n, . 22~\nit to be cream, and subsequently ate a slice of bread and mustard as\nplumcake, eagerly asking for more.\nOn another occasion Wells, then in his normal condition, was bidden\nto look fixedly at Mr. Smith, and was then impressed with the idea that\nMr. Smith had left the room, though Mr. Smith was immediately in\nfront of him. He anxiously looked for him allover the room and even\nleft the room to search over the house. When Mr. Smith was pointed\nout he was unable to recognise him-\" had never seen him before.\" His\npower 'of imitation under the, influence of a suggested idea was most\nremarkable. Thus he admirably mimicked at different times a parrot,\na worm, a clock, a statue, a bear, and a frog. His leaps under the\ninfluence of the last-named impression were so energetic and so reckless\nthat it became necessary to discontinue the experiment, lest he should\n__do himself some injury. When he was told on another evening that he\nwas a nightingale it, was anticipated that he would confine himself-\nas in the case of the parrot, to vocal imitation mainly. But his interpre-\ntation of the part, though sufficiently thorough, was quite\nunconnected with our expectations. He rushed, without hesita.-\ntion, at a set of high book-shelves, well filled with books,\nwhich lined one wall of the room, mounted-we might almost say\nfluttered-up them with wonderful speed, and then crouched in a corner\non the top of the shelves, with his head against the ceiling, violently\nand ineffectually flapping his arms, as a bird, accidentally imprisoned in\na room, will flap its wings. Nor was his assumption of combined parts\nless complete. He at once succumbed, for example, to the suggestion\nthat one side of him was a nurse, and the other a windmill; and for\nmany minutes his sedulous though left-handed attentions to an imaginaJ:Y\ninfant were quite unimpaired by the no less sedulous revolutions of his\nright arm.\nFrom these lighter stages of the induced condition, the sensitive\nwould be roused by a loud clap of the hands, and the word \" Right \"\nahouted at him by the operator. He would wake suddenly with a\ndazed expression, and would as a rule be found to retain not the\nslightest recollection of what had taken place. Sometimes, as in Mr.\nNorth's case, there was a slight remembrance of the main incidents.\nAnd it was found that if a command or a prohibition were strongly im-\npressed upon the \"subject\" in the sleep, he would execute the behest\non waking. In obedience to such a command Wells was made to leave\nthe house, on going home, without his hat: indeed, his subjection to the\ncommand was so thorough that the hat could only be put on his head\nby force. This sensitive was frequently made the subject of such com-\nmands. He invariably executed them in the waking state, hut, as a\nrule, with some hesitation and reluctance-not unnatural, perhaps, in\nview of the tasks demanded of him. Thus he, on one occasion, threw\nDigitized by Google\n\f224 Fil:st Report oj tke Oommittee on Jlesmeri8m. [April 24,\nhis waistcoat on to the fire in obedience to the dominant idea impressed\nupon him in the sleep. Similarly at another time he thrust his fingers\nbetween the bars into the lighted fire, but was of course prevented\nfrom injuring himself. The effort to remember these and other\ncommands, where many consecutive actions were enjoined, made\nhis head ache, and thus at last caused the failure of the experi-\nment. But in no case had he any recollection at all of the circumstances\nunder which the command was\u00b7given. His own account of the matter\nwas that, on waking, he would feel that he \"had to do something;\"\nbut the exact nature of the task would, as a rule, become clear to him\nonly after a few minutes' reflection. He appeared generally to resist\nthe idea thus suggested, until its influence became too strong for him.\nThe above examples, which are merely selections from a long and\nvaried list, may suffice to indicate our complete adhesion to the view.\"...\n(taken by the advocates of hypnotism and mesmerism alike) that in\ncertain states of the nervous centres suggested ideas may acquire &\ndominant and practically irresistible force. Of course experimentation of\nthis kind can scarcely exclude all sources of error with scientific\nprecision....:...that is to say, the state of SUbjection to a dominant idea can\nbe, to a certain extent, simulated, as epilepsy or coma can be simulated;\nand in the one case, as in the other,\u00b7 some very painful tests might\nseem necessary to establish the genuineness of the alleged state. But\nthe need of such tests here is rather apparent than real. For this\npartiCUlar phenomenon-on public platform or in private consulting-\nroom-rarely fails in practically demonstrating itself,- and observers of\nall shades of opinion, who have witnessed this state of subjection to a\nsuggested idea, are hardly more disposed to deny that the state is,\nat any rate in the majority of ca.ses, a genuine one, than observers of\nepilepsy are disposed to deny that such a thing as true epilepsy exists.\nCommunity of Sensation.~But we come now to a thesis more\ncontroverted and more controvertible. We maintain (and here we are\nsupported by one section only of previous inquirers) that we have\nfrequently observed a very remarkable cO'l\/~munity of sensation between\noperator and \"subject\"; or. as the phenomenon might be, perhaps,\nmore correctly described, a transference of sensation from the operator\nto the \"subject.\" This phenom~non .. is obviously closely allied\nto. those which have been occupying the Oommittee on Thought-\ntransference. It differs, however, from the experiments recorded by\nthat Oommittee in that the Percipient is here in the mesmeric sleep, and\nnot, therefore, in his normal state. The experiments were conducted\nas follows. Fred Wells was placed in\u00b7 a chair blindfolded, and Mr.\nSmith stood behind him. Wells was .then sent into the mesmeric sleep\nthrough passes made by Mr. Smith. Some part of the latter's body would\nthen be pricked or pinched tolerably severely-the operation lasting,\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.J Fir8t Report qf tke Comm#fee on Me8merism. 225\ngenerally, one or two minutes. Perfect silence was observed throughout,\nexcept for the simple and uniform question: \"Do you feel anything 1\"\nThis question was asked by Mr. Smith, as the subject appeared not\nto hear any other speaker.

Mr. Smith's right calf pinched. Wells was very sulky, and for a long\ntime refused to speak. At last he violently drew up his right leg,\nand began rubbing the calf.\nAfter this Wells became still more sulky, and refused in the next\nexperiment to give any indication whatever. With considerable acute-\nness he explained the reasons for his contumacy. \"I ain't going to\ntell you, for if I don't tell you, you won't go on pinching me. You\u00b7\nonly do it to make me tell.\" Then he added, in reply to a remon-\nstrance from Mr. Smith, \"What do '!IOU want me to tell for ~ they ain't\nhurting gou, and I can stand their pinching.\" All this time Mr. Smith's\nleft calf was being very severely pinched.\nThus out of a total of 24 experiments in transference of pains, the\nexact spot.was correctly indicated by the subject no less than 20\ntimes. Two out of the four failures had been anticipated, previous\nexperience having shewn that the experiment rarely succeeded when the\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.J First Repal't aj the Oammittee an Mesmerism. 227\ninfliction consisted in pulling the hair. There remain, then, but 'two\nfailures unaccounted for, and in only one of these cases was a wrong\nindication given, the boy merely remaining silent on the other\nQccasion. It would be hazardous to draw any positive conclusions from\nthe results of the four trials with tastes. But we shall hope to continue\n<lur experiments in this direction at no distant date.*\nIt is obvious that the impressions here recorded as having been\ntransferred by sympathy from operator to subject might conceivably\nhave been conveyed by a code, with less difficulty, at any rate, than in'\nthe case of the diagrams given. in our report on Thought-transference.\n-where, nevertheless, our precautions may appear to have been more\n-elaborate than here. But the fact is that we never attempted these\n-experiments in\" mesmeric sympathy~' until we had satisfied ourselves\n-d the genuineness and completeness of the \"mesmeric sleep.\" That\nstate was, as we think, tolerably unmistakable; nor did anyone\n(lircumstance occur during the whole course of our experiments which\nthrew any doubt on its reality, or on the perfect integrity of the opera~r.\nRigidity andAnresthesia.-Buta more distmct and definite testimony to\nthe genuineness of this induced condition is to be found in our experiments\nQn anrestltesia. We satisfied ourselves, by a great number of carefully-\nvaried experiments, that it was possible to induce in the subject: (1)\n_either a general insusceptibility to, pain inflicted on any part of his\nperson-and this state ge~er~lly, e!,isted even while he was acutely\nsensitive to pains inflicted 'on'the operator; (2) or an auresthesia of\nsome specified part of the subject's' body, chosen by ourselves.\nThus, a limb or a portion of a limb, after being stroked two or three\ntimes by. the operator's hands, would assume ~ condition of perfect\nrigidity, in which pinching, pricking, burning, or strong electric shocks\nmight be applied without producing the slightest protest or sign of\npain.\nThis condition would last for a considerable period; indeed, the\nCommittee have not yet observed a case in which rigidity, when once\nfully induced in a- sensitive su~Ject, has disappeared of its own accord.\nThe limb is soon restored to. its normal condition when stroked with_\nthe hand as before-the pas~es-beu;.gmade, however, in the reverse direc-\ntion. It is noticeable that the insensibility is often very strictly defined.\nAll parts above a definite line, apparently limited by t~e range of the\n., passes,\" are in the normal condition; all below seem as void of sensation\n\" '\n\u2022 Some independent observations of one of our Committee strongly corrobor-\nate this \"mesl,Ileric sympathy.\" See the facts recorded by ProfessOr Barrett in\na paper read before the British Association in 1~76,a.nd: reprinted in the\npresent part of our Proceedings, as to the tra.D.sfererice of impressions from\nkifllleZ\/, as mesmeriser, to an ignorant Irish peasant girl, who was his snbject.\nDigitized by Go'b~Ie\n\f228 First Report oj the Committee on Mesmerism.

Occasionally,whilst all senseof pain is destroyed,\nthe sense of contact is, to a certain extent, preserved; then the \"sub-\nject\" will feel a pin touch the skin, but cannot feel it driven into the\nflesh. In our observation the two phenomena of rigidity and insensi-\nbility to pain have always been conjoined; but it is believed that this.\nis not always the case.\nIn the case of Fred Wells, above-mentioned, Harry Manson, a\ntradesman's apprentice, and several other \"subjects\" whom the Com-\nmittee have employed, this insensibility has been very thoroughly tested;\nand the results abundantly confirm the observations of Esdaile, Elliotson,\nand others. To cite one experiment only, out of many which were tried\nupon Wells-a very willing subject-in order to demonstrate this induced\ninsensibility to pain. One arm having been bared and stiffened, the\nwires from a powerful induction coil were applied to the skin, so as to. - .\naffect the flexor muscles of the fingers. The boy, who was otherwise in\nthe normal state, watched with tranquil curiosity the action of the\nbattery, which he had never seen before; he was greatly amused and\ndelighted with the rapid and spasmodic movements of his fingers. The\nwires were then suddenly applied to a sensitive part, and the boy jumped\nout of his chair from the violence of the shock.\nIt may be noted that in the case of the eye, insensibility seems\nto be produced as part of the general condition-at any rate without\nany special manipUlation of the organ. If the sleep is profound, and\nthe eyes, which are firmly closed, are forced open, the sensibility of the\nconjunctiva may be proved to have almost entirely disappeared. The\ncontractility of the pupils is also very much lessened; as may be\nconveniently demonstrated by bringing a lighted candle close to the\neyes, when but a very slight movement is observed.\"\nWe have dealt thus far with three main phenomena connected with\nthe mesmeric state, viz.: (1) The dominance of a suggested idea; (2)\ntransference of sensations, without suggestion, from operator to\npatient; (3) induction of general or local aruesthesia. Thefir8t of\nthese three theses is, we believe, on the high road to universal accept-\nance. The mass of recorded testimony to it is enormous; the\nexperiments are not difficult to repeat; and the discllssions of\nphysiologists are beginning to turn on the explanation rather than on the\n* Experiments on pain, even when as in these cases their result is to prove their\nown absol1lte painle,mell, should be sparingly employed ; and we hardly antioi-\npate any such scepticism as to the induced aD.lel!thesia of mesmerism as can make\nit needful to renew them. We need, perhaps, scarcely add tha' the\nCommitt6e are fully aware of certain special dangers attendiug mesmeric\nexperiments. The strictest preoautions ha.ve always been taken to avoid undue\ninterference on the part of a.ny onlooker with the mesmerised \"subject\"; and\nour care in thi~ respect will not be relaxed in f1lture.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.J First Report 0\/ tlte Committee on Mesmerism. 229\n~xistence of the phenomenon. The second thesis is, of course, much more\nkeenly contested. We think that we have added something to the facts\nrecorded in its favour, and we have every hope of adding more. Thill\nmesmeric sympathy is, as we have suggested, entirely consonant with\n~ur experiments in Thought-transference in the normal state; and as we\nlearn more of the philosophy of the subject it may be hoped that the\ntwo inquiries will throw reciprocal light upon each other. The tltird\npoint-the production of anresthesia-has been already established by\nEsdaile and others with what seems to us even overwhelming complete-\nness, and is to a certain extent admitted by many exponents of modern\nphysiology. But here we come face to face with one form of what\nmust now be accounted as the fundamental problem of the whole\ninquiry. Is this anresthesia produced by mere expectant attention\n- ~xercised in a particular state of the nervous system 1 Is it (in some-\nwhat different terms) the culminating example of the dominance of a\nsuggested idea 1 Or is it, again, the result of the inhibition of certain\nsensory centres in consequence of prolonged stimulation of the peripheral\n~xtremities of the nerves. This is the explanation given by HeidenhainJ\nand, with some modifications, previously by Braid; but it only covers the\n~ases where the passes have been accompanied by actual contact, which\nin our experiments has by no means always been the case. Or is i,t,\nlastly, the result of some specific effluence from the operator which\nmay act without actual contact, independently. of the subject's\nknowledge or expectation 1 It is on this question that we' are now\nconcentrating our attention; and it is only fair to say that our results\npoint strongly in the direction of the tltird-the least antecedently\nprobable, thli\\ least generally accepted explanation. But the question of\nthis specific inHuence-of mesmmsm, as opposed to ltypnotism-is too\ncomplex and important to be approached in a fragmentary manner. It\n.admits of direct investigation in several ways: and we prefer to defer the\npUblication of results until a more complete reproduction of the experi-\n'ments of others, with added tests of our own, may have afforded a.\nwider basis for discussion.\n\f230 Fir8t Report of the \"Reichenbach\" Oommittee.

COFFIN, F.L.S., F.C.S.,* Hon. Sec.\nIn accordance with their preliminary Report, the Committeeappointed\nto repeat Baron Reichenbach's experiments have, 80 far, confined\nthemselves entirely to his original and fundamental observations upon\n.the magnet, anu particularly to the alleged\" Magnetic Light.\"\nIf a luminous effect of ordinary magnetism, though rarely seen, is.\nas Reichenbach believed, an actual physical phenomenon, and demon-\nstrable as such, its establishment would not only have a high scientific\ninterest outside the main objects of this Society, but distinctly lend\nimportance and a degree of credibility hitherto wanting to his description\nof correlative and less purely objective phenomena.\n, .The necessary experimental conditions have latterly been fairly well\nrealised by the Committee: A room on the Society's premises, about\n13 feet square and 12 feet high, has been so arranged as to be easily\nand perfectly darkened. On a bright, sunny day, prolonged immenion\nin this \"camera ob8C~tra\" fails to reveal to any eye the faintest glim-\nmering of ordinary light; but in view of cf'rtain hypotheses, trials with\nvarious large white and polished surfaces, lenses, and silvered concave\nreflectors, have not rendered visible any of the light assumed to still\nlinger in the room. Furthermore to exclude the effect of phosphor-\nescence exhibited more or less by all substances, the apartment was\nusually darkened for an hour or more before each series of observations.\nThe comparative sensitiveness to ordinary faint light of the normal\nhuman eye, as between individuals, has not, so far as the Committee\nare aware, been very systematically studied; their own rough and\ncasual estimates of this, by means of phosphorescent sulphides of the\n\"luminous paint\" descriptiou, indicate only a slight. and inconstant\ndifference between healthy eyes. Of thetwo observers tobe specially men-\ntioned hereafter, one seemed to be a little above, the other slightly below\nthe average sensibility to the ordinarily visible rays of the spectrum.\nDigitized by Google\n-\n\f--\n1883.] Fir8t Report Qf t~e \" Reichenbach\" Committee. 231\nThe magnetic objects employed have been permanent magnets of various\nshapes and sizes, distributed on tables or shelves around the room, or\u00b7\nmounted and standing on the floor ;-a small portable electro-magnet;\nwhose position could be readily changed ;-and a larger and more\npowerful one kindly lent by Dr. Stone (hereafter called \"the electro-\nmagnet \"), with limbs about eight inches long, the same distance apart,\nof flattened section of 2! by 7 inches, reduced to 2! inch circular at the\npolar surfaces, the whole 24 inches length of the magnet being wound with\nwire, and so mounted on trunnions in a massive wooden stand that it\ncould be inclined and clamped in any position. It was excited by the\ncurrent of eight large (10 by 6 inch plates) Smee cells, led to it from a\n\"commutator,\" (that is, a contact-maker and current reverser,) in the\nadjoining room.\nThese facilities have been used by the Committee in their regular\nexperiments of from 2i to 3 hours' duration, and for numerous informal\ntrials conducted by individual members, when at least one hour has\nalways been allowed for the visual accommodation to the darkness. The\nlongest observations in the dark have been about three hours, the\naverage duration of them being an hour and a-half, and it is quite\npossible that a much longer period, with perhaps an interval of sleep\nor rest, may be found necessary for maximum sensitiveness.\nThe main results, however, have been that no member of the Com-\nmittee (or of the Society so far tested) has yet seen anything unusual\nconnected with a magnet, the human body, or other object; and that\nafter careful and repeated trials with 45 \" subjects\" of both sexes, and-\nof ages between 16 and.60, only three of these professed to see\nluminous appearances; a much smaller proportion of \"sensitives\"\n.than, according to Reichenbach; should be found. The testimony, how-\never, of these observers, who declared their entire ignorance of Reichen-\nbach's works, was so remarkable, and the series of tests by which it\nwas confirmed is so striking, that the Chairman of the Committee,\nrecounting a portion of it in the Pltilosophical Magazine,* says, \"Of\nthe fact that, to certain eyes, a luminosity accompanies the creation of\na magnetic field, the evidence, so far as it goes, seems to me absolutely\nunexceptionable.\" In view of this opinion, it will be useful to record\nsome of the experiments more fully than they are described in the\n\" Note\" just quoted.\nThe following, for instance, is an account of one of several similar\nand nearly equally satisfactory meetings of the Committee: Mr. G. A.\nSmith, a young man of 19, of whom further mention is made in\n\u2022 Note on the Alleged Luminosity of the Magnetic Field. By W. F. Barrett,\nProf. of Experimenwl Physics in the Royal College of Science, Dublin. Phil.\nMag., April, 1883.\nDigitized by Google\n\f23~ First Report oj tlte \" Reickenbaclt\" Oommittee. [April 24,\n\\\nthe Mesmeric Report, and a lad, Fred Wells, who had been a \"subj!lct\"\nof his mesmeric experiments, were, on the evening of January 2nd,\n1883, seated in the dark room with Dr. A. T. Myers, :Mr. F. W. H.\nMyers, Mr. H. N. Ridley, and Professor W. F. Barrett. The large\nelectro-magnet was in the centre of the room with its poles upward,\nand about 4ft. 6in. above the Hoor. This was magnetised at intervals,\nbut for the first half hour without being observed. At the end of that\ntime poth sensitives described something in the centre of the room,\nas, in their own words, \"more like a faint smoke than a light,\" and suc-\ncessively led Professor Barrett's hand directly to the poles of the electro-\nmagnet as its source. The\" commutator,\" which made and broke the\ncurrent animating the electro-magnet, worked quite silently, and was in\ncharge of Mr. E. R. Pease, Mr. Edmund Gurney, and Mr. WalterH. Coffin\nin the adjoining room, where every remark of the. \" sensitives,\" or any of_\nthe Committee, could, through the darkening screens,be plainly heard and\nnoted. The current was suddenly and unexpectedly broken, when\nSmith said instantly, \"It is gone\" (alluding to the \"smoke\" or faint\nlight described), and it being as suddenly remade in a few seconds, he\nexclaimed as quickly, \"Now I see it.\" A few less decisive observa-\ntions then followed, until, on breaking the current, Smith instantly\nannounced the fact; and from this moment commenced a remarkable\nnumber of uniform successes. In the words of Professor Barrett:-\nA consecutive series of observations, extending o,\"er an hour, was then\nmade by Mr. Smith. From time to time, during this period, the observers\nin the next room silently and unexpectedly closed or interrupted the current,\nthe intervals being purposely varied from a few seconds to several minutes.\nIn this way fourteen consecutive trials were made; and in every case, except\none, the exclamations made by Mr. Smith, such as \"Now I see it,\" \"Now\nit's gone,\" were absolutely simultaneous with the movement of the com-\n.mutator-according to the unanimous report uf the witnesses in the adjoining\nroom. In the one exception referred to, a delay of five seconds occurred\nbetween the breaking of the current and the exclamation: this, however,\nmay easily have been due to a momentary relaxation of attention on the part\nof Mr. Smith. The strain on the attention was indeed so severe, that\nafter the fourteenth observation, Mr. Smith complained of considerable pain\nin his eyes and head, and was obviously much exhausted. During a succeed-\ning half hour two or three further experiments were made ; but the results\nwere uncertain, and may, I think, be fairly excluded.\nIt is obVIOUS that a series of accidental comcidences between the act of\nclosing or opening of the circuit and the exclamation of the observer cannot\nexplain the facts here noted. As there are 3,600 seconds in an hour, to hit\noft' anyone right moment by pure chance would be very improbable; but\nthe chances against success increase in geometric progression when fourteen\nright moments are S'UccemtJely hit oft'. The probabilities against mere coin-\ncidence as an explanation are tnerefore many millions to one.\nMore important was the possibility of indications being alrorded by the\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.] First Report of tke \"Reicltenback\" OOlnmittee.\nact of magnetiZation and demagnetization, which might give notice to the\nobserve!.\" and suggest to the imagination the conversion of an illusion into a\nfancied reality.\nOf these indications the so-called\" magnetic tick\" at once suggesteditself.\nKnowing precisely what to listen for, and therefore more keenly alive to the\nsound than Mr. Smith, who presumably knew nothing of this molecula.r\ncrepitation, I failed to detect the faintest Bound on the \"making\" of the\ncircuit; and a barely audible tick on \"breaking\" contact was heard only\nwhen my ear was in close contact with the magnet or its support.*\" This was\ndue to the massive characte!.\" of the magllet and stand, which also prevented\nany other discernible movement when the magnet was excited. Further, I\nsatisfied myself that, at the distance at which Mr. Smith stood from the\nmagnet; it was impossible to discover when the clrcuit was completed or in-\nterrupted by the attraction of any magnetic substance about on6's body ; as a\nprecaution, however, Mr. Smith emptied his pockets beforehand. At th.,e\n~--lI&1lle time it is quite possible a skilful operator, bent upon deceiving us, might\nbe able to detect the moment of magnetization and demagnetization by feeling\n\u2022 the movement of a concealed compass-needle. Against this hypothesis must\nbe placed the fact that no informatioll was given to Mr. Smith beforehand of\nthe nature of the experiment. Ultimately all scientific observation rests\nupon the good faith of the observers; alld there was nothing to arouse the \\\nsmallest suspicion of the good faith of the observer in the present instance.\nSimilar experiments were made on another evening with the boy Wells,\nwith fairly satisfactory results. In the case of Wells the luminosity, from\nhis description, must have appeared to be brighter and larger; and on the\ninterruption of the circuit it was not instantly extinguished, but gradually\ndied awayt; his frequent exclamation on breaking the current was, \"Oh,\nyou are spoiling it.\"\nThe description given by the three \"sensitives\" (including Mr.\nSidney Beard, in addition to the above mentioned) of the luminous\nappeamIlce was that of two rounded or blunted cones, apices downward,\none of each being directly over and upon a pole of the magnet; that\nover the north-seeking pole being the brighter. They were said to be\nunstea.eJ.y, waving in form, and flickering or variable in intensity. The\nbreath deflected without extinguishing them. According to two of the\nobservers with whom the experiment was tried the luminosity was not\nintercepted or cut off by a black velvet cloth or a thick board laid flat\nover the poles, but was hid from view like an ordinary source of light\nby an opaque body between it and the eye.\nFaint lights have been described by one of these sensitives on\npermanent steel m8.0anets, and in particular upon a small laminar\n* The Committee have subsequently found that under proper conditions (of\nperfect silence, &c.) the ticks of both \" making\" and \"breaking\" are audible\nto the ear placed directly in contact with the polar surface of the magnet.\nt There was a considerable amount of residual magnetism in the electro-\nmagnet.\nDigitized by Google\n\f234 First Rfport q\/ the\" Reiclienbach \" Committee.

F. Fitzgerald,\nF.R.S., F.T.C.D., in a paper read before the Royal Dublin Society, has\nshown that these luminous appearances do not necessarily oontravene\nthe 1aws of thermo-dynamics or of the conservation of energy.\nProfessor Fitzgerald has been good enough to state, in a letter (appended\nby permission to this Report), his hypothesis accounting for the origin of\nthe light. In fact, the amoul).t of molecular disturbance whioh may be\ncompetent to excite vision is immeasurably small. Thus a rush light\ncan be seen through a radius of, say, a mile or more. How infinitesimal\nis the energy which produces sensation at that distance! Also, a phos-\nphorescent powder, illuminated for one second, is found to be visible\nafter uninterruptedly expending for five or six hours the trace of energy\nimparted to it by a momentary insolation. How minute is the amount of\nenergy which excites our vision at the 20,OOOth second! But, notwith-\nstanding the amazing delicacy of the organ of sight, photographic plates\ncan now transcend our sense perception, and unlike the sensory effect,\nthe image on such plates grows in distinctness by prolonged exposure\nto very feeble radiations. Hence the Committee were anxious to try.\nphotography; but preliminary efforts have been disappointing, no effect\nbeing produced by a magnet on very sensitive dry plates.

Upon the\nlatter theory it should be possible to originate either stationary\n{)r progressive waves, and I showed that it might be possible to originate\n-experimentally such short waves as to be within range of observation,\nfor the principal difficulty is that owing to the velocity of propagation being\nthe same as that of light it is very difficult to get short wans. I proposed.\nto get over the difficulty by using the rapidly alternating currents produced\nwhen a condenser is discharged through a small resistance. As I was on the\n\"\"Subject of the electrical origination of light I mentioned some suggestions as\nto a possible origin for the light sRid to be seen near a magnet. I suggested\nhat the fact that the air molecules are moving in an intense magnetic field\nmight very likely disturb the distribution of vibrations when they collide:\nthe sudden change of direction in their motion may induce electrlc currents\nor vibrations in the molecules which are sufficiently rapid to be visible. I\npointed out that this got over all difficulty in respect of the first Law of\n\"Thermo-dynamics, for that the source of energy was the air and not the perma-\nnent magnet. I suggested some ways in which it might not be opposed\nto the second Law, although it seems as if you were getting energy from\nthe air by cooling it down below its surroundings. I pointed out that the\naction might not be permanent in still air and that the action might be like\nevoking a phosphorescence out of the air which would ultimately settle down\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.] Fir8t Report 01 the\" Reioltenhacll\" Oommittee. 237\nto a new distribution of velocities, but that practically air currents would\nmake the action pennanent. I pointed out that a somewhat similar action\nwas supposed to take place when the magnet is stated to be able to separate\nthe paramagnetic oxygen from the nitrogen in the air, for that as the gaselt\nare not of the same density there is a greater energy in them when apart than\nwhen mixed, and I suggested that the two effects might be in lome way con-\nnected with one another, for that in order to separate them there must be\nsome disturbance of the intra-molecular impacts. I refrained from suggesting\nobvious experiments to test the suggestions, such as putting the magnets in\nvacuo, or in a simple gas, or in a liquid or transparent solid, partly because,\nthey were obvious and partly because it seems so hard to catch the experi-\nmenter who can see the phenomenon. Mr. Moss suggested putting dry\nphotographic plates for a long time near a magnet to see would they get at\nall fogged. This might very well be tried, but it would require a long course\nof experiments, as plates get accidentally fogged in so many ways.-Yours,\n--~ sincerely, GEO. FRAS. FITZGERALD.\nP.S.-I think I stated that contrary to what many people state I can see no\nIi priori difficulty in the supposition of direct action at a distance.\nUpper Tulse Hill, S. W., 6th May, 1883.\nD EAR PROFESSOR BARRETT,-Mr. Grubb, doubtless, gave to you the,\nphotographic plate, with the data of the experiment. I gave it to him the\nsame day, and had not the opportunity of careful examination when dry.\nIf you can see even the very faintest suspicion of any form, it may be well\nto strengthen 'with bichloride of mercury and ammonia. * This photograph\nwas taken under the impression that you rather suggested the possibility of\nultra-violet light. It is difficult to understand, from what we know of the\nmagnetic lines of force, that there is a radiant energy which can be brought\nto focus on the retina. Your experiment with screens seems to suggest that\nthe force is physical and not purely psychical. May it be energy in the form of\ninfra-red vibrations1 If our eyes were like Abney's plates every object would.\nbe I uminous, and men and women and all warm-blooded creatures would be\npre-eminently\" shining ones.\" In one case the, oxidation necessary to life\ndoes manifest itself in vibrational energy within the eye's range, namely, the,\nlittle phosphorescent beasts in the sea, and also similarly infire-flies and glow-\nworms. When you experiment again, will you try screens of glass and very\nthin ebonite 1 The former is very imperfectly transparent to short vibra-\ntiona, and the ebonite is opaque to all but low infra-red rays, which pass.\nfreely through it. It would be well to try magnets with Abney's plates. If\nthere is sufficient radiated energy to affect the eye, it might be well to see if,\nwith the most sensitive pile, there is any indication of a rise of temperature\nfrom the magnetic field. In this case, if an electro-magnet is used, care must\nbe taken that any rise of temperature in the wire from the current may not\nbe allowed to affect the pile. This would be a good preliminary experiment\nbefore trying for photographic evidence of red or infra-red rays.-Yours very\nsincerely, WILLIAM HUOOIN~.\n\u2022 I could see no trace of any form at all on the plate.-W.

BARRETT, F.R.S.E., M.R.I.A., &c.\nThere are certain conditions of the mind, either temporarily\ninduced or habitual, which appear to be associated with many\nremarkable phenomena that have hitherto received but partial\nattention from scientific men. On various occasions during the last ten\nyears I have had the opportunity of observing some of these singular\nstates, and in the hope of eliciting further information or of stimulating\ninquiry by those more competent than myself, I venture to bring tbe-\nfollowing facts under the notice of the British Association. '\nThe observations to be described belong mainly to the class known by\nthe names of mesmerism, hypnotism, or induced somnambulism, for\nthese terms express very similar mental states. The experiments of the\nlate Dr. Braid have led physiologists to recognise the existence of the\nfact that an extraordinary condition of the mind can be induced in\ncertain susceptible or sensitive individuals by merely fixing theatten\u00b7\ntion rigidly for several minutes upon any bright object. Whilst staying\nwith a friend in Westmeath, now, some years ago, I had the opportunity\nof frequently witnessing the production of this morbid condition, and,\nfurther, of observing some phenomena that are usually denied by\neminent physiologists of the present day.\nSelecting some of the VIllage children and placing them in a quiet\nroom, giving each some small' object to look at steadily, it was found\nthat one amongst the number readily passed into a state of reverie,\nresembling that dreamy condition between sleeping and waking.\nIn this state the subject could readily be made to believe the most\nextravagant statements, such as that the table was a mountain, a\nchair a pony, a mark on the floor an insuperable obstacle. As Dr.\nMaudsley observes in his Mental P\/~ysiology, \"the mind of the patient\nbecomes possessed with the ideas the operator suggests, so that hiS\nbody becomes an automatic machine set in motion by them.\"\nIn the Proceedings of the British Association for 1855, is a paper\nby Mr. Braid in which the phenomena of mesmerism are referred to\n* This paper was originally read before the British Association, at the\n'Glasgow Meeting, September, IS76. By permission of the Council of the S.P.R~\nit was included in the proceedings of the meeting on April 24th, after a verbal\nrevision and the omission of a few paragraphs. Though this paper was the\nsubject of much animadversion when first read, students ofthe Reports published\nby the S.P.R. will be able to judge how far the opinions expressed seven years ago\nhave since received confirmation.\nDigitized by,Google\n\f1883\u00b71 Abnormal Oondition8 oj Mind. 239\nwhat is termed a mono-ideo-dynamic action, the ideo-motor force of the\npresent day. Many other writers might be quoted, but the main facts\nare not now denied; in fact, this peculiar physiological state is referred\nto all in recent works on the mind. \u2022\nThe fact that sne mind can thus readily be thrown into a state of\npassive obedience to another mind is undoubtedly a fact of much im-\nportance. It is important, not only as exhibiting a state into which\nilertain minds are liable to be exposed, but also as probably affording a\nclue to some of the extraordinary assertions that have' been made by\ncredible witnesses as to the elongation and levitation of the human\nbody, the handling of fire and the like. These facts are testified to by\neminent men whose word one cannot for a moment question. Either\nthe narrators saw the things they describe or they tlwugkt they saw\n--'ohern. The following considerations seem to render it highly probable\nthat the latter affords a provisional explanation.\nMr. Herbert Spencer has compared the ordinarily vivid mental\nimpressions produced by the perceptions of external things which\nare simultaneously present in our consciousness with the fainter\nideas produced by reflection, memory, or imagination-to two\nparallel streams of consciousness, constantly varying in their\nrelative breadth, as the outer or the inner world predominates. During\nstates of activity we are receiving a crowd of impressions from the\nsenses, and hence the stream of consciousness derived from the external\nworld causes the faint manifestations derived from within to sink into\ninsignificance. But when the vivid manifestations produced by the\nsenses are enfeebled-e.g., by closing the eyes, stillness, &c.-the\nusually faint stream of consciousness becomes predominant; the hetero-\ngeneous current of ideas grows more distinct, and almost excludes the\nvivid order of impressions, and finally, on lapsing into sleep, the\nmanifestations of the vivid order cease to be distinguishable as sue h,\nand those of the faint order come to be mistaken for them.\nIt is highly probable that the vivid stream of consciousness produced\nby sensation, having been reduced by quietness and twilight, the minds\nof those who testify to the feats referred to, would readily yield them-\nselves to any emphatic suggestion on tht. part of the operator. However.\nto put this matter to the test of experiment, I selected (in the manner\na.Irea.dy described) a young lad, who in the course of fifteen minutes was\nhypnotised, as Mr. Braid would say. The lad now readily believed any\nassertion I made, with evident relish going through the farce of eating\nand drinking because I suggested the act, though the only materials I\n,gave him .were a book and an empty vase. When subsequently he partly\nawoke, he was under the conviction that he had had his tea, yet could\nnot understand how it was, as he associated the actual books with the\nforced idea of bread and butter, and the struggle of reason and memory\nDigitized by Google\n\f240 .Abnm-mal Condition8 ~f Mind. [April 24,\nwas curious to witness. On another occasion, when the lad was\nhypnotised, I placed my shoes on the table and forcibly drew his atten-\ntion to them_ I then suggested that I was standing in them, and after-\nhe had given his assent, I said, \"Now I am going to rise up and float\nround the room.\" So saying I raised my hand, and directing his sight\nupwards, pointed out the successive stages in my imaginary flight. He-\nfollowed the direction I indicated with intense and anxious interest, and\non my slowly depressing my hand, and asserting I was once more on the\nground, he drew a sigh of relief. On awaking he held to the belief that\nI had in some indistinct way floated round the room and pointed to the\ncourse I had taken. I had not the slightest doubt that after a few\ntrials, this extravagant idea might have been fixed in the lad's mind\nwith the greatest ease.\nI adduce the foregoing experiment to shew the powerful influen~\u00ad\nof suggestion when the mind is in certain states such as reverie, and\nhence the need of guarding against illusion. At the same time, I do\nnot wish it to be supposed that I dogmatically assert this must have-\nbeen the explanation of the phenomena described by Lord Lindsay and\nothers; all I assert is, in our present state of knowedge, it is an easier-\nexplanation than to assume the actual occurrence of the marvels.\nNevertheless, in justice to those who hold an opposite view, I am bound\nto mention a case that came under my own repeated observation,wherein\ncertain inexplicable physical phenomena occurred in broad daylight,and\nfor which I could find no satisfactory solution either on the ground of\nhallucination or of fraud.* .\nReturning to the experience gained at my friend's house in West.\nmeath, the girl there mesmerised passed on another occasion into a state\nof deeper sleep or trance,wherein no sensation whatever was experienced\u00b7\nunless accompanied by pressure over the eyebrows of the subject. When\nthe pressure of the fingers was removed, the girl fell back in her chair\nutterly unconscious of all around, and had lost all control over her .\u20221\nvoluntary muscles. On re-applying the pressure, though her eyes\nremained closed, she sat up and answered questions readily, but the\nma.nner in which she answered them, her acts and expressions, were\neapable of wonderful diversity by merely altering the place on the head\"\nwhere the pressure was applied. So sudden and marked were the\nchanges produced by a movement of the fingers that the operation\nseemed very like playing on some musical instrument.t I mention these\nfacts simply to ask whether a careful and systematic study of them-\n* The description of this case is here omitted, not from any doubt of itB\ngenuineness. but because it is thought better M> refer it to the special Committee-\nof the Society a.ppointed to deal with this class of phenomena..\nt The deep mesmeric sleep and the complete insensibility of the subject\nseemed to te the best guarantee against a clever course of deception on her part.\n-Digitized by Google\n\f1883.] Abnormal OOnditions of Mind; 24L\nmight not throw some additional light on the localisation of the func-\ntions of the brain. For extraordinary as it may appear that moderate\npressure on the skull could produce any local irritation of the brain, yet it\nmust be bome in mind that we are here dealing with the brain in an\nabnormal condition, probably a state of unstable equilibrium, so that a\nslight disturbance might produce an altogether disproportionate effect.\nOn a third occasion the subject, after passing through what .has\nbeen termed the \"biological\" and \"phrenological\" states, becam~\nat length keenly and wonderfully sensitive to the voice or acts\nef the operator. It was impossible for the latter to call the girl\nby her name, however faintly and inaudibly to those around, with-\nout at on<lEl eliciting a prompt response. Even when the operator left the\nhouse, and at intervals gently called the girl's name, at the same time\n-indicating the fact by signs to those within sight, she still responded,\nmore and more faintly, it is true, as the distance became greater. This\nextraordinary and unnatural sensibility surprised me greatly, as it ex-\nceeded anything I had heard or read, and I regretted being unable, at\nthe time, to carry out more experiments in this direction.\nIn his Mental Physiology, Dr. Carpenter states that he has seen\nabundant evidence that the sensibility of a hypnotised subject may be\nexalted to an extraordinary degree in regard to some particular class of\nimpressions, this being due to the concentration of the whole attention\nupon the objects which excited them. Thus, he has known a youth in\nthe hypnotised state find out, by the sense of smell, the owner of a\nglove which was placed in his hand, from amongst a party of more\nthan sixty persons, scenting at each of them one after the other, until\nhe came to the right individual. In another case, the owner of\na ring was unhesitatingly found out from amongst a company of\ntwelve, the ring having been withdrawn from the finger before the\nsomnambule was introduced. He has seen other cases, again, in\n~ which the sense of temperature was extraordinarily exalted, very\nslight differences, inappreciable to ordinary touch, being at once\ndetected.\nWithout denying the possibility of such an extraordinary sensibility,\nother facts I witnessed pointed in the direction of a C(YTnrrtunity 0\/\nsensation between the mesmeriser and the subject, for I noticed that if\nthe operator tasted, smelt, or touched anything, or experienced any\nsudden sensation of warmth or cold, a corresponding effect was instantly\nproduced on the subject, though nothing was said, nor could the subject\nhave seen what had taken place upon the operator. To be assured Qf\nthis, I bandaged the girl's eyes with great care, and the operator having\ngone behind the girl to the other end of the room, I watched him and the\ngirl, and repeatedly assur ed myself of this fact. If he placed his hand over\nthe lighted lamp, the girl instantly withdrew hers, as if in pain; if he\nDigitizedbyG~gle\n\f242 .Abnarmal Oonditioni oj Mind. [April 24, -\ntasted salt or sugar, corresponding expressions of dislike and approval\nwere indicated by the girl. If, however, anyone else in the room\nother than the operator tried the experiment, I could\nperceive no indications on the part of the subject. Certainly,\nso far as my observations. extended, there did seem to be\na vast difference between the influence exerted on the subject\nby the operator, and that which could be exerted by anyone else.\nDr. Carpenter believes, however, tha.t there is no foundation for\nthe \" rapport\" which is so often asserted to exist between a\nmesmerised subject and the operator. On this point he remarks:\n\"If the subject be 'possessed' with the previous co nviction that a\nparticular individual is destined to exert a special influence over him,\nthe suggestions of tllat individual are obviously received with greater\nreadiness, and are responded to with greater certainty, than are those of---\nany bystander. This is the whole mystery of the relationship between\nthe 'biologiser' and his 'subject.''' _\nFor my own part, I do not think that the whole mystery of this so\u00b7\ncalled\" rapport\" can be disposed of quite so easily. Not only do the\nfacts I have just given negative Dr. Carpenter's easy solution, but the\nfollowing still more remarkable experiments shew, at any rate, that the\nquestion is one deserving of more extended inquiry.\nWhen the subject was in the state of trance or profound hypnotism,\nI noticed that not only sensations but also ideas or emoti ons occurring\nin the operator appeared to be reproduced in the subject without the\nintervention of any sign, or visible or audible com~unication. Having\nmesmerised the girl myself, I took a card at random from a pack that\nwas in a drawer in another room. Glancing at the card to see what it\nwas, I placed it within a book, and in this state brought it to the girl.\nGiving lier the closed book, I asked her to tell me what I had put\nwithin its leaves. She held the book close to the side of her head and\nsaid, \"I see something inside with red spots on it.\" \"Count the spots,\"\nI told her; she did so, and said there were five red spots. The card\nwas the five of diamonds. Another card, chosen and concealed in a\nsimilar way, was also correctly named; and when a Bank of Ireland\nnote was substituted she said, \"Oh now I see a number of\nheads; so many I can't count them.\" She sometimes failed to\nguess correctly, asserting the things were dim, and invariably I\nfound she could give me no information of what was within the\nbook, unless I had previously known what it was myself. More\nremarkable still, I aSked her to go in imagination to Regent Street, in\nLondon, and tell me what 8 hops she saw. The girl had never been out\nof her remote Irish village, but she correctly described to me the shop\nof Mr. Ladd, the optician, of which I happened to be thinking-\n::eferring to some large crystals (of lcelahd spar) and to other things in\nDigitized by Google\n\fI883.} .A.bnal'mal Oondlttans OJ Mind. 243\nthe shop-and when she mentally left the shop she noticed the large\nclock that overhangs the entrance to Beak Street. '\nIn many other ways I convinced myself that the existence of a\ndistinct id~ in my own mind gave rise to an image of the idea in the\nsubject's mind ; not always a clear image, but one that could not fail to\nbe recognised as a more or less distorted reflection of my own thought.\nThe important point is that every care was taken to prevent any\nunconscious movement of the lips, or otherwise giving any indication\nto the subject, although one could hardly reveal the contents of an\noptician's shop by facial mdications.*\nThis power of \"thought-reading,\" as it has been termed, has often\nbeen described by writers on mesmerism, but little credence has been\ngiven to it by physiologists or psychologists.\n- -- \" Some assert that this state extends even further; that subjects in\nthis condition are able to perceive occurrences at remote distances which\nare not known to any present, and yet are subsequently verified. I\n* The following interesting communication from my friend, Mr. W. E.\nWilson, of Co. Westmeath, reached me in September, 1876, after the fore-\ngoing was written, and gives us a glimpse of something even beyond thought-\nreading, but many more experiments are necessary before a prima facie case\nin favour of so-called \"clairvoyance\" can be said to have been established.\nMr. Wilson writes in reference to the above-mentioned card experiment :-\n\" You are correct, as I remember several experiments of the same kind,\nI think we proved beyond all doubt that the subject is able to read the\nthoughts of the mesmeriser. Also that they are able to see through things\nwhich are to us optically opaque, .provided that they could touch the objects\nor hold them in their hand. At any distance beyond that I don't think we\nhave evidence that they can see things unless the mesmeriser knows them,\nin which case it of <lourse becomes thought-reading. A lady subject has\noften told us the time by a gold hunting watch, which was put in a box\nafter the hands were altered to any extent by the keyless arrangement, so\nthat no one knew their position. I remember one instance with her. There\nwere some friends in the room looking on. The hands of the watch were\ntwisted round promiscuously; it was then put in a box and the clOlled box put in\nher hand. She at once said what o'clock it was. My father opened the watch\nto see if she was right, but found to his astonishment that she was wrong.\nHe told her so, and gave her the watch to try again. She at once said she\nwas right. He told her to look again, but she got crusty and refused to look\nfor some time. He pressed her to look once more. She still said she was\nright, but that it was now a minute past the time she first said. My father\nopened the watch to shew those present the mistake she made, but found that\nshe was perfectly right, that he had made a mistake himself. In that in-\nstance the thoughts of the mesmeriser were against her. Another instance\nI remember was with a country boy. He was mesmerised in a room which\nwe made perfectly dark. Cards were given to him at random from a pack.\nHe told fourteen correctly without a mistake, and I have no doubt would\nhave gone through the pack if we liked. Of course you know that they\ndon't try to use the eyes to see with. T~y always, without exception, put\nwhatever is put in their hand to the side of their head, a little behind the\near, and about six inches from them. Thcy always say that everything is\ngreatly diminished. Ordinary book print they describe as fine lines.\"\nR 2\n\f244 Abnormal Oond'tions of Mind. [April 24, 1883.\nhave had cases of this kind described to me by those whom I esteem\nas careful and conscientious observers; but as nothing of the sort\nhas ever come under my own observation, I refrain from stating\nwhat I cannot vouch for myself. Even as regards the facts I\nhave myself witnessed, I do not pretend that they do lDore than\njustify further inquiry, as a large amount of similar evidence must be\nobtained by well qualified men before these phenomena can be accepted\nunreservedly. All I wish to urge is, that it is not wise to allow a\nnatural feeling of incredulity on this matter to become a barrier to a\npossible extension of knowledge.\nDr. Carpenter himself remarks, that \"everyone who admits that\n, 'there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our\nphilosophy,' will be wise in maintaining 'a reserve of possibility' as to\nphenomena which are not altogether opposed to the laws of physics en--\nphysiology,but rather transcend them\"; and he adds (Mental Physiology,\np. 633), \"some of his own experiences have led him to suspect that a\npower of intuitively perceiving what is passing in the mind of another,\nwhich has' been designated as ' thought-reading,' may, like certain\nforms of sense-perception, be extraordinarily exalted by entire con-\ncentration of the attention. So far, however, as we are acquainted\nwith the conditions of its exercise, it seems to depend upon the\nunconscious interpretation of indications (many of them indefinable)\nfurnished by the expression of the countenance, by style of conversation,\nand by various involuntary movements; that interpretation, however,\ngoing, in many instances, far beyond what can have been learned by ex-\nperience as the meanitng of such indications.\"\nIt will be noticed that whilst Dr. Carpenter does not deny the\npossibility of thought-reading or some analogous kind of divining\npower, he distinctly asserts that everything lUJ has seen is explicable by\nsign or \"muscle-reading.\" The evidence that I have here adduced, on\nthe other hand, indicates that when a person is thrown into a hypnotic\nor passive condition, the nervous action associated with thought can be\nexcited by a corresponding action in an adjoining individual, and this\nacross space and without the intervention of the recognised organs of\nsensation. Nor does this seem an altogether incredible fact. The energy\nof electricity exerts itself in two ways, by transmission along a material\nconductor and by influence, or induction as it is termed, across space.\nMay not nerve energy, whatever be its nature, also act by influence as\nwell as conduction1 For many years I have held this view, and it has\nbeen confirmed by what I have witnessed from time to time. My main\nobject in bringing this paper before the Section is to direct attention to\nthe subject in the hope that those who have any evidence to offer in\nsupport of this view, or any good grounds for opposing it, may favour\nme with their experience.\nDigitized by Google\n\f","_id":507}
