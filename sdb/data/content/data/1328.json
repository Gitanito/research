If\nwe look into the \\~ritings of the moll: cele-\nbrated Philofophers of moder!l Times, a very\nfew Names excepted, \\Ve fhall find all the moil\nremarkable Phenomena of Nature refolved\ninto mere mechanical Operations, as if Nature\ncould of heife!f operate to produce Effects.\n\\Ve fhall fee chemical Combinations, and the\nCompofitions of fubtle Fluids, appealed to, in\nOrder to account for the feveral Births, Pro-\nduai~:ms, and Changes obfervable in the ex-\nternal World and its various Elements. \\Ve\n!hall fee Divine Mercies and Divine Judg-\nments, as exhibited in temporal Nature,remov-\ned far out of fight, being confounded with the\nuncertain and indeterminate Configurations of\nParticles ofMatter, which are fuppof.~d capable\nofforming fuch Arrangements, ConjunCtions,\nand DisjunO::ions, one with another, as to pro-\nmote the Bleffing or Mifery of l\\hn by an\nAgency feparatc from that of the great Crea-\ntor.

In ihort,\n-vve fl1all find a living Power ofAction afcribed\nto Things, '\"hich in themfelves are dead,\nwhilfi: the real living Operator, who works\nunfecn in and by the feveral SubjeCts of the\nmaterial \\Vorld, is altogether forgotten, and\nhis Divine Operation transferred to the Things\noperated upon, whereby jeco11d Caufes ufurp\nthe Place of the Fitjl, and what is merely in-\njlrumental is conceived to be principal. To\ninfiapce only in the Cafe of Vegetation. \\Ve\nihall fee this fimple and manifeft Effect of the\nDivine Agency in Nature involved in the ut-\nmoft Intricacy and Perplexity, through the\nDarknefs and Subtlety of vain Reafoning and\nScimce fa!fely fo called; whilft the Changes of\nMatter and corporeal Forms alone, have been\nregarded as fufficient to explain the wonderful\nPhenomenon, and whilft philofophers have\nforgotten this plain eternal Truth, that it is\nGod who \"maketb the Grafl togrow for the\nCattle,\n\fP R E F A C E:\nPERHAPS there never was a Period in\nany Age of the \\Vorld, which required\na Vindication and Elucidation of the Divine\nProvidence of the Lord, more than the pref-\nent. Not that the Divine Providence is at\nthis Day generally denied in J1Tord, for none\nexcept abfolute Atheifis do this ; but becaufe\nit is allowed in fo partial and confined a Man-\nner and Meafure ofOperation, as borders upon\na Denial, and indeed when rightly confidered\nis a Denial.\nFor if we allow a general Providence, and\nyet deny a particular one, or if we allow a\nparticular one, and yet deny a jingu!ar one,\nthat is, one extending to Things and Circum-\nfiances moftjingular and minute, what is this\nbut denying a gmeral Providence ?\nEvery reafonable Man confeffes that the Dci-\nt y has created and that he preferves the \\Vorld\ningeneral; but does not this necefrarily imply\nthat he has created, and that he preferves all\nThings in particular and inji11gular ? And\n!hould any one affert that Creation and Prefer-\nyation do not thus extend to Thingsparticular\nand\n\f.\nVI P R E F A C &\nand jingular, would not this be a pofi.tive De.\nnial of Creation and Prefervation in general,\nfince Things ingeneralcannot poffibly be fup-\npofed to be or exift, but in and by Thingspar-\nticular andjiugu!ar.\nTn like Mannet\u00b7 the Allowance ofa gtneral\nProvidence ncceffarily implies the Allowance\nof a particular and moil: jingular one, and to\ndeny the latter is manifeftly to deny the for-\nmer. It is like ailerting that a human Body\nmay in general exift, without its particular\nl\\1embers, Organs, Vifcera, &c. and the Singu-\nlars thereof; or that a State or Kingdom may\nin general exift, without the feveral particular\nOrders and Societies of Perfons who compofe\nit, together with the Individuals of each Or-\n' d r \u2022\naer an I.)Octety.\nNow that a particlllar and Jingu!ar Provi-\ndence is at this Day denied, may appear plain\nto every con:!iderate Perfon, who attends to\nthe Opinions, Sentiments, and Reafonings, at\nprefent circulating in the \\Vorld from the\nBooks of the Learned, refpetl:.ing the Divine\nOperation, which is the fame Thing as the Di-\nvine Providence, more particularly in Refer-\nence to the three grand Subjects in this World\nof temporal Nature, on which it is exercifed\nor employed, viz.

'That a One-\ndoth not ex!Jl without a Form, but that the Form 'itfe!f\nmaketh it One: Every one who thinks intently with\nthe Mind, may fee clearly, that a One without a\nForm\n\fTnE DIVINE PROVIDEl~c:c. 43\nForm doth not exifr, and if it doth exifr that it is a \u00b7\nForm; for whatfoever exifl:eth, from its Form deri-\nveth that which is called ~ality, and alfo that\nwhich is called Predicate, alfo that which is called\nChange of State, as alfo that which is called Rela.\ntion [ Relativum], and the like; wherefore that\nwhich is not in a Form, is n'ot of any Aftecrion, and\nthat which is not of any Affecrion, is not alfo of any\nThing (nullius Rei); the Form itfelf giveth all\nthefe : And forafmuch as all Things which are in a\nForm, if the Form is perfecr, mutually refpeCl each\nother, as one Link in a Chain doth another, there-\nfore it follows that the Form itfelfmaketh them One~\nand confequently a fubjecr, whereof ~ality, State~\nAHecrion, therefore Something, may be predicated,\naccording to the Pcrfecrion of the Form. Such\na One is every Thing which is an Objed: of Sight\nin the \\Vorld, and fuch a One alfo is every Thing\nwhich is not an objed: of Sight, whether it be in in-\nterior Nature, or in the Spiritual vVorld; fuch a One\nis Man, and fuch a One is a human Society; and fuch\na One is the Church, as alfo the univerfal Angelic\nHeaven before the Lord ; in a Vlord, fuch a One is\nthe created Univerfe not only in general but in eve-\nry Particular. In Order that al! and every Thing\nmay be Forms, it is neceifary that He who created\nall Things ihould be Form itfelf, and that from Form\nitfelf all Things fhould exifi which are created in\nForms : This therefore is what is fhewn in the Treat-\nife concerning THE Drvi\"'E LovE AND THE DIVINE\nWISDOM under the following Articles, viz. That\nthe rl!vine Love and the Divine \\Vifdom is a Sub.\nfrance and a Form, n. 40 to 43\u00b7 That the Divine\nLove\n\f'44 ANGELIC \\VISDO.M CONCERNING\nLove. and the Divine \"Wifdom are Subfl:ance and\nForm in itfdf, therefore the Self-fubfifl:ing and the\nSole-fubfifting, n. 44 to 46. That the Divine Love\nand the Divine Wifdom in the Lord are On~, n. I 4\nto I 7, n. I 8 to 2 2. And that they proCPced as One\nfrom the Lord, n. 99 to I oz, and in other Places.\nCf'hat the Form maketl~ a Onefo much tbe morepcrjefl-\nly, in Proportion as tbe Tbings wbich enter into tbe\nForm, are djflinfl!y other, and neverthc!ifs united:\nThis is comprehended with Difficulty by the Under.\nflandin~ unlefs it be elevated, becaufe there is an\nAppearance, tl~at Form cannot otherwife make One,\nthan by Semblances of Equality of the Things which\nconfl:itute the Form: On this Subjecr I ha,\u00b7e fre-\nquently converfed with the Angels; who faid that\nthis is an Arcanum, which the vVife among them\nperceive clearly, but the lefs vVife obfcurely; nev-\nerthelefs that it is a Truth that a Form is fo much\nthe more perfeEt, in Proportion as the Things which\nconfl:itute it, are difl:inEtly other, but fl:ill united in\na firrgular Manner : They confirmed this by the\nCafe of the Societies in the Heavens, which taken\ntogether confl:itute the Form of Heaven; and by\nthe Angels of each Society, that by how much the\nmore difl:inEtly every one is his own, and therefore\nfree, and thus loveth his Aifociates as from himfelf,\nand from his own AffeEtion, the Form of the Socie...\nty is the more perfeEt ; they alfo illufl:rated it by\nthe Marriage of Goodnefs and Truth, that by how\nmuch the more di!linEtly they are two, by fo much\nthe more perfeEtly they can make One; and in\nlike Manner by Love and \\Vifdom ; and that what\nis indifl:inEt is confufed, from whence all Imperfeo6\nt~on\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 45\ntion of Form refults. But how Things perfeaiy\ndifiinet are united, and thus make One, they are al-\nfo confirmed by many Infl:ances ; efpecially by the\nThings whic hare in !\\ian,where innumerable Things\nare fo difl:inet, and {till united, difl:inet by their Coats,\nand united by Ligaments; and that it is the fame\nwith Love and every Thing appertaining to it, and\nwith \\Vifdom and every Thing appertaining to it,\nwhich are not otherwi1e per~eived than a$ One.\nMore on this SubjeCt may be feen in the Treatiie con-\ncerning THE DIVINE LovE AND THE DIVINE \\VIs-\nDOM,n. 14 to 22,and in the Work concerning I-lEAv-\n.EN AND HEI.L, n. s6 and 489. This is adduced\nbecaufe it is an Arcanum of Angelic vVifdom.\n5\u00b7 Ill. 'That this One is in a certain Image in ewry\ncreated 'Thing. That the Divine Love and the Di-\nvine \"Wifdom, \\vhich in the Lord are one, are in a\ncertain Image in every created Thing, may appear\nfrom what is fhewn in many Parts of the Treatife\nconcerning THE DrviNE LovE AND THE DIVINE\n\\iVIsDoM, and efpecially from n. 47 to SI, s+ to 6o,\n282 to 284, 290 to 295, 316 to 318, 319 to 326,\n349 to 457 ; in which Places it is fhcwn, that the\nDivine is in every created Thing, bccaufe God the\nCreator, who is the Lord from Eternity, from him-\nfelf produced the Sun of the Spiritual \u00b7world, and\nby that Sun all Things in the Univerfe, confequent-\nly that that Sun which is from the Lord, and where-\nin the Lord is, is not only the firft Subfl:ance, but\nalfo the Sole from which all Things are; and for-\nafmuch as it is the fole Subflance, it follows that it\nis in eYery created Thing, but with infinite Variety\n.according to Ufes. Now forafmuch as in the Lord\nthere\n\f46 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\nthere is Divine Love and Divine Vvifdom, and in\nthe Sun from Him Divine Fire and Divine Bright-\nnefs, and from the Sun fpiritual Heat and fpiritual\nLight, and thefe two make one, it follows that this\nOne is in a certain Image in every created Thing.\nHence it is, that all Things which are in the Uni-\nverfe have Relation to Good and Truth, yea to the\nConjunction of them, or what is the fame, that all\nThings in the Univcrfe have Relation to Love and\n'\\iVifdom, and to the Conjuncrion thereo(for Good\nis of Love, and Truth is of \\Vifdom, inafmuch as\nLove calleth all that appertaineth to it Good, and\n\\Vifdom calleth all that appertaineth to it True :\nThat there is a ConjunB:ion of thefe in every created\nThing, will be feen in what follows.\n6. It is a.::knowledged by many, that there is one\nonly Subfbnce, which is alfo the firfl:, from which\nall Things are; but what that Subfl:ance is, it is\nnot known ; it is thought that it is fo fimplc that\nNothing can be fimplcr, and that it may be likened\nto a Point which is of no Dimenfion, and that from\nan infinite Number of fuch, the Forms of Dimen-\nfion exifl:ed: This however is a Fallacy originating\nfrom the Idea\u00b7 of Space; for from this Idea there\nappears to be fuch a fmallefl: [Point or Particle]:\nNeverthelefs it is a Truth, that by how much any\nThing is more fimple and pure, by fo much it is\nmore and fuller ; which is the Reafon why the\nmore interiorly any ObjeB: is viewed, fo much the\nmore wonderful, perfeB:, and beautiful Things are\nfeen in it; and thus that ip the firfl: Subfl:ance there\nare the mofi: wonderful, beautiful, .and perfea\nThings of all. The Ground and Reafon ofthis i2a\nbecaufe\n\fTru DrviNE PROVIDENCE. 47\nbecaufe the firfl Subfbnce is from the fpiritual Sun,\nwhich, as was faid, is from the Lord, and in which\nthe Lord is, therefore that very Sun is the only Sub-\nfiance, which forafmuch as it is pot in Space, is all\nin all, and in the greatefl and leafl: Things in the\ncreated Uni\\\u00b7erfe. Forafmuch as that Sun is the\nfirfl: artd only Subfl:ance, from which all Things are,\nit follows that there are in it infinitely more Things\nthan what can appear in the Subil:anccs thence deri-\nved, which are called fubfl:antiate, and lail:ly mate-\nrial: The Reafon vvhy the former cannot appear in\nthe latter, is, becaufe they defcend from that Sun by\nDegrees of two Kinds, according to which all Per-\nfections decreafe : Hence it is, that, as was faid\nabove, by how much any Thing is viewed more in-\nteriorly, by fo much the more wonderful, perfeCt,\n.and beautiful Things arc feen in it. Thefe Obfer-\nvations are here made in Order to confirm this\nTruth, that there is a certain Image of the Divine\nin every created Thing, but that it appears lefs and\nlefs in defcending by Degrees, and il:i!l lefs when\nthe inferior Degree, being feparated from the fupe-\n- rior Degree by a Clofure, is choaked up with earthy\nMatter. Thefe Obfervations however cannot but\nfeem obfcure, unlefs what hath been faid concerning\nthe fpiritual Sun in the Treatife on THE DrvrNE\nLovE AND THEDiviNE WrsnoM, n. 53 to 172; of\nDegrees, n. I 73 to 281 ; and of the Creation ofthe\nUniverfe, n. 282 to 357, hath been firfi read and un-\nderil:ood.\n7\u00b7 IV. 'That it is ofthe Divine Providence, that ev-\nery created Thing in the Whole and in Part jhou!d be\n[uch a One, and ifit is not, that itjbou!d be madefo;\nthat\n\f48 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nthat is, that in every created Thing there fhould be\nSomething out ofthe Divine Love, and at the fame\nTime out of the Divine Wifdom, or what is the fame,\nthat in every created Thing there fhould be Good\nand Trnth, or a Conjunaion of \u00b7the Good and the\nTrue : Forafmuch as Good is of Love and the True\nis of \\Vifdom, as was faid above, n. 5 ; therefore in\nwhat follows, infl:eac.l of Love and vVifdom we fhall\nufe the Vvords Good and True, or Goodnefs and\nTruth, and infl:ead of the Unio}l of Love and Wif.\ndom, the Marriage of Goodnefs and Truth.\n8. From the preceding Article it is evident, that\nthe Divine Love and the Divine Wifdom, which\nin the Lord are One, and from the Lord proceed\nas One, exift in a certain Image in every Thing\n'\\ created by Him; it may be expedient now to fpeak\nparticularly of that One, or Union, which is called\nthe Marriage of Goodnefs and Truth. That Mar.\nriage is, I. in the Lord himfelf; for as hath been:\nfaid, the Divine Love and the Divine \\Vifdom in\nHim are One. II. It is from the Lord, for in eve\u00b7\nry Thing which proceedeth from Him, Love and\nWifdom are perfeC\\:ly united; thefe two proceed\nfrom the Lord as a Sun, the Divme Love as Heat7\nand the Divine \\Vifdom as Light. III. They are\nreceived by the Angels indeed as two, but they are\nunited in them by the Lord : The Cafe is the fame\n\u00b7with Men of the Church. IV. From the Influx of\nLove and \\Vifdom from the Lord as one into the An.\ngels of Heaven and Men ofthe Church,and from the\nReception thereofby Angels and Men, it is that the\nLord in the Word is called the Bridegroom and\nthe Hufban:i, anJ Heaven and the Church the Bride\nand\n\fTin: DrviNt PRovm\u00a3NcE.. 49\n4\n.\nand the :Wife. V. As far therefore as Heaven and\nthe Church in general, and an Angel of Heaven\nand a l\\'lan of the Church in particular, is in that\nUnion, or in the Marriage of Goodnefs and Truth,\nfo far they are an Image and Likcnefs of the Lord ;\nbec:mfe thefe two in the Lord are One, yea they arc\nthe Lord. VI. Love and \\Vifdom in Heave:1 and\nin the Church in general, and in an Angel of Heay\u2022\nen and in a Man of the Church, are One, when the\n\\Vill and the Underfl:anding, and therefore when\nGoodnefs and Truth make one, or what is the\nfame, when Charity and Faith make one : or what\nis frill the fame, when Doetrine from the Vford,\nand a Life according to it make one. VII. Bu~ hmv\nthefe two make one in Man and in all Th;ngs a,?..\npertaining to him, is !hewn in the Treatife concern..\ning THE DrviNE LovE AND THE DIVINE Wis-\nDOM, Part the Fifth, where the Creation. of Man,\nand partic'ularly the Correfpondence of the 'Will\nand the Underfl:anding with the Heart and the\nLungs are treated of, from n. 385 to 432. \u2022 ,\ng. But how thefe make One in the Things which\nare beneath or without Man, as well in the Things\nwhich are in the Animal Kingdom, as in thofe\nwhich are in the Vegetable Kingdom, will be fhewn\nin many Places in what follows; previous to which\nthefe three Things ate to be premifed : FrRST,\nThat in the Univerfe, and in all and every Thing\ntherein, which was created by the Lord, there was\na Marriage of Goodnefs and Truth. S ECONDLY,\nThat that Marriage after the Creation was feparated\nin Man. THIRDLY, That it is of the Divine Provi-\ndence that what is feparated fhould be made one,\nG and\n\f50 ANGELIC \\VJSDOM CONCERNING\nand thus that the Marriage of Goodne[s and Truth\nihould be reftored. Thefe three Particulars are\nabundantly confirmed in the Treatife on Tm: DI-\nVINE LovE AND THE DIVINE \\VrsnoM, wherefore\nthey have no Need of further Confirmation: Eve-\nry one alfo may fee from Reafon, that fince a 1\\hr..\nriagc of Goodnefs and Truth \\Vas by Creation in\nevery created Thing, and fince this was afterwards\nfeparated, the Lord mufl: operate continually, that\nit may be refl:ored ; confequer:tly that the Re!l:ora-\ntion thereof, and thereby the Conjunfrion of the\ncreated Univerfe with the Lord through Man, is of\nthe Divine Providence.\nro. V. That tbe Good ofLove is not Good, exceptfo\nJar m it is united to the 'I'rue ofW!fdom, and that the\n'True of W!fdom is not 'True, exceptJoJar as it is uni-\nted to the Good ofLove: Good and Truth derive this\nfrom the~r Origin, Good in its Origin is in the\nI.ord, in like Manner is Truth, becaufe the Lord\nis Good itfelf and Truth itfelf, and thefe two in\nHim are one ; hence it is that Good in the Angels\nof Heaven and in Men of the Earth is not Good\nin itfelf, except fo far as it is united to Truth, and\nthat Truth is not Truth in itfelf, except fo far as it\nis united to Good. That all Good and all Truth\nis from the Lord, is well known ; hence, foraf-\nmuch as Good maketh one with Truth, and Truth\nwith Good, it follows, that in Order to Good being\nGood in itfelf, and Truth being True in itfelf they,\nmuft make one in the Recipient, which is an An\u00b7get\nof Heaven and a Man of the Earth.\nII. It is known indeed that all Things in the U-\nnivcrfe have Relation to Good and Truth, becal..}fe\n\u2022 by\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 51\nby Good is underflood that which univerfally em-\nbraceth and involveth all Things of Love, and by\nTruth is undedtood that which univerfally embra-\nceth and involvt:th all Things of \\Vifdom; but it \u00b7is\nnot yet known that Good is not any Thing unlefs\nunited to Truth, nor that Truth is not any Thing\nunlefs united to Good: It appears indeed as if Good\nwere Something without 'Truth, and as if Truth\nwere Something without Good, but {l:ill they are\nnot; for Love, all Things\u00b7 appertaining to which are\ncalled Goods, is the Ejfe of a Thing, and Wifdom,\nall Things appertaining to which arc called Truths,\nis the Exiflcre (Exiftence) of a Thing from that\n.Eife, as was fhewn in the Trcatife on THE DrvrN\u00b7e\nLovE AND THE DiviNE \\VIsDOIII, n. 14 to 16;\nwherefore as an Eire (Eifence) without Exifl.ence is\nnot any Thing, nor Exiflence without an Eifence, fo\nGood without Truth, and Truth without Good,\nare not any Thing. In like Manner, what is Good\nwithout Relation to Something ? can it be called\nGood ? it being in fuch Cafe of no AffeB:ion and\nof no Perception ; to appertain to Affetl:ion and\nPerception hath Relation !o Truth,' together ,,\u00b7ith\nthe Good \\Vhich affetl:eth, and which caufeth itfelf\nto be perceived and felt, becaufe it hath Relation\nto thaL which is in the Underfl:anding; fay barely\nto any one, Good, and not this or that is good, and\nis Good any Thing ? But by Virtue of this or that\nwhich is perceived as one with Good, it is Some-\nthing ; this is not united to Good any where elfe\nbut in the Underfl:anding, and the All of the Un-\nderfl:anding hath Relation to Truth. lt is the fame\nwith Volition (vel\/e) ; to will without knowing,\nperce1vmg,\n\fS2 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCE!tNING\nperceiYing, and thinking what a Man willeth, is not\nany Thing, but together with thefe it becometh\nSomething ; all Volition (vel\/e) is of Love, and\nhath Relation to Good, and all Knowledge (fcire),\nPerception, and T hought is -of the Underfl:anding,\nand hath Relation to Truth ; hence it is evident,\nthat to will is not any Thing, but to will this or\nthat is Something. It is the fame with all Ufe, be-\ncaufe Ufe is good; Ufe, unlefs it be determined to\nSomething, with which it may be one, is not Ufe,\ntherefore it is not any Thing ; Ufe derives its be-\ning Something, from the Underfl:anding, and that\nwhidh is thence conjoinedor adjoinedtoUfe,hath Re-\nlation to Truth ; from this Ufe derives its ~ality.\nFrom thefe few Hints it may appear that Good with-\nout Truth is not any Thing, therefore that neither is\nTruth without Good any Thing. It is faid that\nGood with Truth and Truth with Good are Some..\nthing, hence it follows, that Evil with Falfe and\nFalfe with Evil are not Something, for the latter are\noppofite to the former, and Oppofition defl:royeth,\nin the prefent Cafe defl:royeth that which is Some.\nthing ( aliquid); but more of this in what follows.\nI z. But there exifl:eth a Marriage of Goodnefs\nand Truth in the Caufe, and there exifl:eth a Mar..\nriage of Goodnefs and Truth from the Caufe in the\nEff'ea ; the Marriage ofGoodnefs and Truth in the\nCaufe, is the Marriage of the \\iVill and the Under..\nfianding, or of Love and \\Vifdom ; in all that a Man\nwilleth and thinketh, and which he thence conclu-\ndeth and intendeth, there is this Marriage: This\nMarriage entereth the EffeB: and caufeth it, but in\n~ffecring, thefe two appear difl:incr, becaufe what ia\nSimultaneot+S\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 53\nSimultaneous then confl:itutcth what is Succeffive:\nAs \\vhen a Man willeth and thinketh to be nouriih-\ned, to be cloathed,to have a Dwelling,t? do any Bufi-\nJlefs or \\Vork, orto converfe, in this Caie he firfl: fimul-\ntaneou!ly willeth and thinketh, or concludeth and\nintendeth it, and when he hath determined thele\nOperations toEffeCt, then one Thing fucceedcth after\nanother, but l1ill they continually make one in the\nWill and in the Thought: Ufcs in thefe Efreas are\nof Love or of Good, Means to Ufes are of the Ua-\nderfl:anding or of Truth. Thefe Univerfals any one\nmay confirm by Particulars, if fo be he dillinEtly\nperceiveth what hath Relation to the Good of Love\nand what to the True of Wifdom, and diilinaly\nperceiveth now it hath Relation in the Cauie and\nhow in the Effecr.\n13. It hath occafionally been faid, that Love\nmakes the Life of Man, but it is not meant Love\nfeparate from Wifdom, or Good feparate from,\nTruth in the Caufe, becaufe Love feparate or Good\nfeparate, is not any Thing, wherefore the Love\nwhich maketh the inmofl: Life of Man, which is\u00b7\nfrom the Lord, is Love and \\Vifdom together ;\nneither alfo is the Love which maketh the Life of\nMan fo far as he is a Recipient, feparated in the\nCaufe, but in the Effecr ; for Love cannot be under-\nflood without its ~tality, and its ~ality is \\Vif-\nQ.om ; Qt!ality or \\Vifdom cannot be given except\nfrom its Effe, which is Love, hence it is that they\nare one; it is the fame with Good and Truth. Now\nforafmuch as Truth is from Good, as \\Vifdom is\nfrom Love, therefore both taken together arc called\nLove or Good, for Love in its Form is \\Vifdom,\n\u00b7 \/ and\n\f54 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nand Good in its Form is Truth; from its Form,\nand from no other Source is all its ~ality.\nHereby then it may appear that Good is not in the\u00b7\nleafl: Good, any more than in Proportion as it is uni-\nted to its Truth, and that Truth is not in the leafl:\nTruth, any more than in Proportion as it is united-\nto its Good.\n14. VI. 'That the Good of Love not united to the\nTrue qf Wifdom is not Good in iifelf, but that it is\napparent Gol)d, and that the 'True qfWifllom not united\nto tbc Good qf Love is not True in itfelf, but that it is\ncrNarent 'Truth. The Truth is, that there doth not\nexifi any Good which is Good in itfelf, except it be\nunited to its Truth, nor any Truth which is True\nin iu-df, except it be united to its Good; neverthe-\nlefs there exitts Good feparate from Truth, and\nTruth_ feparate from Good; this exifl:eth in Hypo-\ncrites and Flatterers, in all the Vlicked whatfoever,\nand in thofe wh() are in natural Good and in no fpirit-\nual Good; thefe can do Good to the Church, to their\nCountry, to Society, to their Fellow-Citizens, to the\nNeedy, the Poor, to Widows and Orphans, and they\ncan alfo underfl:and Truths, from the Underfianding\nthink them, and from Thought fpeak and teach\nthem ; but flill thefe Goods and Truths arc not inte-\nriorly, therefore not in themfelves Goods and Truths\nin them, but they are exteriorly Goods and Truths,\ntherefore only in Appearance, for they are only for\nthe Sake of Self and the \\Vorld, and not for the\nSake of Good itfelf and Truth itfelf, confequently\nnot grounded in Goodnefs and Truth ; wherefore\nthey are only of the Mouth and of the Body, and\nnot of the Heart i and may be compared to Gold\nand\n\u2022\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVJDE~CE. 55\nand Silver inclofing Drofs, or putrid vVood or\nDung ; and Truths thus uttered may be compared\nto the vVind of Rcfpiration \\Vhich is difperfed, or to\nan Ignis fatuus \\vhich vanifheth, which neverthelefs\noutwardly appear as if they were genuine: Notwith-\nfianding, however, fuch Appearancc, they may ap-\npear otherwife to the Hearers and Recipients, who\ndo not know this ; for what is external afFetl:eth\nevery one according to his internal, inafmuch as\nTruth entereth, from whatever Mouth it be uttered,\ninto the Hearing of another, and is received by the\nMind according to its State and ~ality. \\Vith\nthofe who are in mtural Good hereditarily, and in\nno fpiritual Good, the Cafe is nearly fimilar, for\nthe Internal of all Good and of all Truth is fpiritual,\nand this !haketh off Falfes and Evils, but the Natu-\nral Principle alone favoureth them, and to favour\nEvils and Falfes, and to do Good, do not accord.\n15. The Ground and Reafon why Good can be\nfeparated from Truth, and Truth from Good, and\nwhen it is fcparated, fiill appear as Good and Truth,\nis, becaufe Man hath a Faculty of acting, which is\ncalled Liherty, and a Faculty of underfl:anding,\nwhich is called Rationality ; from the Abufe of\nthefe Faculties it is, that Man can appear different\nin Externals from what he is in Internals ; there-\nfore that a wicked Man can do Good and fpeak\nTruth, or that the Devil can imitate an Angd of\nLight. But on this SubjeCt fee the following Obfer..-\nYations in the Treatife on THE DIVINE LovE .1\\ND\nTHE DIVINE WISDOM : That the Origin of Evil is\nfrom the Abufe of the Faculties which are proper\nto Man,and are called Rationality and Liberty,n. 264\nto\n\f56 A~crLic \"\\Vrsno~t coNcEn.NINo\nto 270.

The\nReafon why Man can be in Evil and at the fame\nTime in Truth, and that the Lord cannot refifl: it\nfor the Sake of the End, which is Salvation, is be-\ncaufe the Underfl:anding of Man can be elevated\ninto the Light of Wifdom, and fee Truths; or ac-\nknowledge them when he heareth them, his Love\nremaining below ; thus Man can be Y>ith his Un-\nderfl:anding in HeaYen, but with his Love in Bell,\nand to be fo, cannot be denied .M!).n, becaufe the\ntwo Faculties, by which he is Man, and is diflin-\nguilhed from Beafl:.s, and by which alone he can be\nregenerated and thereby faYed, which are Rational~\nity and Liberty, cannot be taken away from him ;\nfor by them Man can aCl: according to \\VifJom, and\nH ;.lf~\n\f58 ANGELIC \\VrSDOM CO~CERNING\nalfo can act according to the Love not of \\Vifdom,\nand can from Wifdom above fee Love beneath, and\nthus fee his own Thoughts, Intentions, AffeB:ions,\ntherefore the Evils and Falfes, as alfo the Goods and\nTruths of his Life and DoClrine, without a Knowl-\nedge and Acknowledgment of which in himfelf, he\ncannot be reformed. Of thefe two Faculties Some-\nthing hath been faid above, and more will be faid\nin what follows. This is the Reafon why Man can\nbe in Good and at the fame Time in Truth, alfo in\nEvil and at the fame Time in the Falfe, and likewife\nin the Alternates thereof.\n17. Man can with Difficulty in this World come\neither into one or the other Conjunaion or Union,\nthat is, of Good and True, or of Evil and Falfe, for\nfo long as he liveth here, he is kept in a State of\nReformation or Regeneration ; but every Man\ncometh into one or the other after Death, becaufe\nthen he can no longer be reformed and regenera-\nted 7 he then remains fuch as his Life had been in\nthe World, that is, fuch as his ruling Love had\nbeen ; wherefore if his Life had been a Life of the\nI~ove of Evil, every Truth which he had acquired\nfrom Maf1e.rs, Preachings, or the \"Word in this\nVvorld, is taken away from him, which being taken\naway, he imbibes the Falfe which accords with his\nEvil, as a Spunge doth \\Vater; and \u00b7vice verfa; but\nif his Life had been a Life of the Love of Good,\nevery Falfe is removed which he had imbibed by\nHearing or by Reading in the World, and which\nhe had not confirmed in himfelf, and in Place there-\nof is given Truth which accordeth with his Good.\nThis is meant by thefe \\Vords of the Lord, \" Ta.ke\ntbe\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 59\n.the 'Talent from him, and gi've it unto him which hath\nten 'Talents ,\u00b7 for unto every one that hath }ball be giv-\nen, and he jhall have Abundance ; butfrom him that\nhath notjhall be taken away even that whicb he hath,\"\nMatt. xxv. 28, :29. Chap. xiii. I 2. Mark iv. 25.\nLuke viii. I 8. Chap. xix. 24 to 26.\nI 8. The Ground and Reafon why every one after\nDeath mufl: either be in Good and at the fame Time\nin Truth, or in Evil and at the fame Time in the\nFalfe, is, becaufe Good and Evil cannot be joined;\nneither Good and at the fame Time the\u00b7 Falfe of\nEvil, nor Evil, and at the fame Time the True of\nGood, for they are Oppofites, and Oppofites combat\neach other, until one defl:royeth the other. They\nwho are in Evil and at the fame Time in Good, are\nunderfl:ood by thefe Words of the Lord to the\nChurch of Laodicea in the Apocalypfe, '' I know\nthy Works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would\nthou wert either cold or hot ; but becazife thou art lu.~e\u00ad\nwarm, and neither cold nor hot, I willJpew thee out of\nmy Mouth,\" iii. 15, I 6 : Alfo by thefe \\N\"ords of\nthe Lord, \" No Man can ferve two Maflers; for\neither he will hate the one and love the other, or e!fe\nhe will hold to the one and d~fp{e the other,\" Matt.\nVI. 24.\n19. VIII. That that which is in Good and at the\nfame 'Time in 'lruth is Something, and that that which\nis in Evil and at the fame 'Time in the Fa!fe is not\nany 'Thing. That that which is in Good and at the\nfame Time in Truth is Something, may be feen\nabove, n. 1 I ; thence it follows, that what is Evil\nand at the fame Time Falfe is not any Thing. By\nnot being any Thing, is meant that it hath no Power~\nand\n\f6o ANGELIC \\VISDOl\\1 CONCERNING\nand nothing of fpiritual Life : They who are in Evil\nand at the fame Time in the Falfe, all of whom are:\nin Hell, have indeed Power among themfelves, for a\nwicked Spirit can do Evil, and alfo doth do Evil a\nthoufand Ways, neverthelefs he can only from a\nPri11ciple of Evil do Evil to the Wicked, but cannot\nin the leafl: do Evil to the Good, and if he doeth E-\n,\u00b7il to the Good, '\"'\u00b7hich fometimes is the Cafe, it is by\nConjunCtion with their Evil; thence come Tempta-\ntions, which are Infefl:ations arifing from evil Spirits\nabout a Man, and confequent Combats, whereby\nthe Good may be delivered from their Evils. For-\nafmuch as the Wicked have no Power, therefore the\nuniverfal Hell before the Lord is not only as Noth\u00b7\ning, but it is altogether Nothing as to Power; that\nit is fo, I have feen confirmed by much Experience.\nThis however is wonderful, that all the \\Vicked think\nthemfelves powerful, and that all the Good think\nthemfelves not powerful; the Reafon is, becaufe the\nWicked attribute every Thing to Self-derived Pru-\ndence, and therefore to Cunning and Malice, and\nNothing to the Lord; but the Good attribute Noth-\ning to Self-derived Prudence, but every Thing to the\nLord, who is Omnipotent. Another Reafon why\nEvil and its attendant Falfe are not any Thing, is,\nbecaufe they have Nothing of fpiritual Life; and \u2022\nthis is the Reafon why the Life of the lnfernals is\nnot called Life but Death, wherefore fince every\nSomething appertaineth to Life, Death cannot have\nany Thing appertaining to it.\n20. They who are at the fame Time in Evil and\ni!1 Truths, may be compared to Eagles foaring aloft~\nwhich, when their \"Wings are taken away, fall down:\nFor .\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 6I\nFor Men do the fame after Death, when they be-\ncome Spirits ; they who underfl:ood Truths, fpake\nthem, and taught them, and yet had no Regard to\nGod in their Life, fuch by their IntelleCl:uals elevate\nthemfelves on high, and fometimes enter Heaven,and\nfeign themfelves Angels of Light ; but when Truths\nare taken away from them, and they are fent forth,\nthey fall down into Hell. Eagles alfo fignify Men\nof Rapine, who have intelleB:ual Sight, and 'Wings\nfignify fpiritual Truths. It was faid, that they are\nfuch, who had no RefpeCI: to God in their Life; by\nhaving RefpeCl: to God in their Life, is meant Noth-\ning elfe but to think this or that Evil a Sin againfl:\nGod, and therefore not to do it.\n21. IX. That the Divine Pro\u00b7vidence of the Lord\ncaufeth Evil and its attendant Fa!fe toferve for Equi-\nlibrium, Relation, and Pur!Jication, and therebyfor the\nConjun{fion ofGood and Truth in others. From the\nforegoing Confiderations it may appear, that the\nDivine Providence ofthe Lord continually opcrateth,\nthat in Man Truth may be united to Good and\nGood to Truth, by Reafon that this Union is the\nChurch and is Heaven ; for this Union is in the\nLord, and it is in every Thing that proceedeth from\nthe Lord: From this Union it is, that Heaven is\n\u2022 called a Marriage, and alfo the Church, wherefore\nthe Kinguom of Gou in the \\Vord is likened to a\nMarriage: From this Union it is, that the Sabbath\nin the lfraelitifh Church was the mofl: holy Part of\nW odhip, for it fignified this Union : Hence alfci it is,\nthat in the vVord, and in all and every Thing there.\nin, there is a Marriage of Good and Truth, on which\n~ubje8: fee the Doctrine of the New Jerufalem con.\ncerning\n\f62 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\ncerning THE SACRED ScRIPTURE, n. So to go;\nthe Marriage of Good and Truth is from the Mar.\nriage of the Lord with the Church, and the latter\nfrom the Marriage of Love and Wifdom in the Lord,\nfor Good is of Love, and Truth is of Wifdom.\nHence it may be feen, that it is the perpetual Object\nof the Divine Providence, to unite in Man Good to\nTruth and Truth to Go.od, for fo Man is united to\nthe Lord.\n22. But whereas many have broken and do break\nthis Marriage, efpecially by the Separation of Faith\nfrom Charity, and thereby conjoin in themfelves\nE\\\u00b7il and the Falfe, and thus have become, and do\nbecome oppofite, it is provided of the Lord that thefe\nneverthelefs may ferve for the Conjunc:tion of Good\nand Truth in others, by Equilibrium, by Relation,\n2nd by Purification. .\n23. The Conjunc:tion of Good and Truth in oth-\ners is provided for of the Lord by EQYILIBRIUM be-\ntween Heaven and Hell; for from Hell continually\nexhales Evi_l and its concomitant Falfe, but from\nHeaven continually exhales Good and its concom-\nitant Truth; every Man is kept in this Equilibrium,\nfo long as he liveth in the World, and thereby in\nthe Liberty of thinking, willing, fpeaking, and act-\ning, in which he may be reformed. Concerning \u2022\nthis fpiritual Equilibrium, from which is derived\nthe Liberty of Man, fee the Work on HEAVEN AND\nHELL, n. s89 to 596, and n. 597 to 6o3\u00b7\n24. The Conjunc:tion of Good and Truth is pro-\nvided for of the Lord by RELATION ; for Good is\nnot known as to its Q_:;ality, but by Relation to\nwhat is lefs good, and by Oppofition to Evil ; all\nthe\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 6j\nt~e perceptive and fenfitive Principle is thence deri-\nved, becaufe their ~ality is thence; for thus all De-\nlight is perceived and felt from what is lefs delight-\nful, and by what is difagreeable; all Beauty from\nwhat is lcfs beautiful, and by what is ugly; in like\nManner all Good which is of Love from what is lefs\ngood, and by Evil; and all Truth which is of Wif-\ndom from what is lefs true, and by what is falfe:\nThere mufl: be Variety in every Thing from its\ngreatefl to its leafl:, and when there is Variety alfo\nin its Oppofite from its leafl to its greatefl, and\nEquilibrium intercedeth, then according to the De-\ngrees on both Sides Relation is efl:ablifhed, and the\nPerception and Senfation of the Thing either in-\ncreafeth or is diminiJ.hed. But i~ is to be noted, that\nwhat is oppoflte taketh away, and alfo exalteth Per-\nceptions and Senfations; it taketh them away when\nit mixeth itfelf, and exalteth them when it doth not\nmix itfelf, for which Reafon the Lord exquifitely\nfeparateth Good and Evil, left they fhould be mixed,\nin Man, as he feparateth Heaven and Hell.\n25. The Conjunction of Good and Truth in oth-\ners is provided for of the Lord by PuRIFICATioN,\n\\vhich is done two \u00b7ways, one by Temptations, and\nthe other by Fermentations. Spiritual Temptations\n\u2022 are no other than Combats againfl Evils and\nFalfes, which are exhaled from Hell and affect ;\nby them Man is purified from Evils and Falfes,\nand in him Good is joined to Truth, and Truth to\nGood. Spiritual Fermentations are effected many\n\\Vays, as well in the Heavens as in the Earths ; but\nin the \\Vorld it is not known what they are, and\nhow they are effeaed: For they are Evils and at the\nfame\n\f64 ANGELIC vVISDOM CONCERNING\nfame Time Falfes, which being let in upon Societies\naft like Ferments put into Meal and fermentable Li\u2022\nquors, whereby heterogeneous Things are feparateci7\nand Things homogeneous are conjoined, and be-\ncome pure and clarified : Thefe are what are under~\nfi:oocl by thefe \\Vords of the Lord, \"'!'he Kingdom\nofHeaven is like unto Lea\u00b7ven, which a Woman took and\nbid in three Afeafurcs of Jo.1eal, till the Whole wai\nleavened,\" Matt. xiii. 33\u00b7 Luke xiii. zI.\n26. Thefe Ufes are provided by the Lord f~om\nthe Conjunttion of Evii and the Falfe Principle.\nwhich is in thofe who are in Hell ; for the Kingdom\nof the Lord, wf!ich is not only over Heaven, but\nalfo over Hell, is a Kingdom of Ufes ; and it is the\nDivine Providence of the Lord, that there fhould\nnot be there any Perfon or any Thing, from which\nand by which Ufe is not performed.\nTiz.at the Divine Providence of tlz.e Lord.\nhat!z for its End an Heaven out of\nthe Huma.\nn Race.\n'Z7. THAT Heaven is !lot from any Angels-ere-.\nated fuch from the Begim1ing, and that\nHell is not from any Devil, who was created an An-\ngel of Light, and cafl out from Heaven, but that\nHeaven and Hell are from the Human Race, Heav-\nen from thofe w!-lo arc in the I~ove of Good and\nthence in the Underflanding of Truth, and Hell\nfrcm thofe who are in the Love of Evil and thence\nin\n\fTH.E bivxNE PRov!n=:Ncr. Gs\nin the Undedhnding of what is Falfc, hath been\nmade known and proved to me by a long Intercourfe\nwith Angels and Spirits; concerning which fee al~\nfo what is'fhewn in the \\Vork on HEAVEN AND\nHELL, n. 31 I to 3I 6 ; alfo in the Tract on THE\nl-AST jUDGMENT, n. 14 to 27; and in the CoNTrN~\nUATION CONCERNING THE LAST jUDGMENT AND\n:nm SPIRITUAL \\VoRLD, from Beginning to End.\nNow forafmuch as Heaven is from the Human Race,\nand Heaven is Cohabitation with the Lord to Eter~\nnity, it follows that that was the Lord's End of Cre~\nation, and forafmuch as it was the End of Creation,\nit is the End of his Di\\ine Providence: The Lord\ndid not create the Univerfe for his own Sake, but\n. for the Sake of thofe with whom he will dwell in\nHeaven ; for fpiritud Lo\\\u00b7e is fuch, th;::t it wifheth to\ngive what it hath to another, and in Proportio.n as\nit can do this, it is in its E.ffe, in its Peace, and in its\nBleffednefs; this Property fpiritual Love deriveth\nfrom the Divine Love of the Lord, which is infi~\nnitely fuch : Hence it follows, that the Divine Love\nand confequently the Divine Providence hath for\nIts End an Heaven, which may confifi of l\\Ien made\nAngels, and who are making fuch, to whom the\nLord can give all the Beatitudes and Felicities which\nare of Love and \\Vifdom, and give them out of Him~\nfelf in them ; nor can he do otherwife, becaufe his\nImage and Likenefs from Creation is in them, hi\u00b7\n:;\nImage in them is \\VifJom, and his Lik.enefs in them\nis Love, and the Lord in them is Love united to\n\\Vifdom and \\Vifdom united to Love, or what i~\nthe fame, he is Good united to Truth, and Truth\nunited to Good; which Union was treated of in\nI ilie\n\f66 ANGELIC \\VISDOl\\I CONCERNING\nthe preceding Article. But forafmuch as it is not\nknown what Heaven is in general, or in many, and\nwhat Heaven is in particular, or in one; alfo what\nHeaven is in the fpirirual.World, and what Heaven is\nin the natural \\Vorld, and neverthelefs it is of Impor-\ntance to know this, becaufe it is the End of the Di-\nvine Providence, rherefore I am defirous to place\nthis Subje8.: in fome Degree of Light in the follow\u2022\ning Order. J. That Heaven is ConjunCtion with\nthe Lord. II. That Man by Creation is fuch, that\nhe can be nearet and nearer conjoined to the Lord.\nIII. That Man, i!l Proportion as he is more nearly\nconjoined to the Lor_\nd, in the fame Proportion be.\ncometh wifer. JV. That Man, in Proportion as he\"\nis more nearly _conjoined to the Lord, in the fame\nProportion becometh happier. V. That Man, in\nProportion as he is more nearly conjoined to the\nLord, in the fame Proportion appeareth to himfelf\nmore dii1.inclly to be his o\\vn, and perceiveth more\nevidently that he is the Lord's.\nzS. I. That Heaven is Conjuntlii;n with the Lord:\nHeaven is not Heaven from the Angels, but from\nthe Lord, for the Love and Wifdom, in which the\nAngels are, and which confiitute Heaven, are not\nfrom them, but from the Lord, yea, they are the\nLord in them : And whereas L ove and w\u00b7ifdom are\nof the Lord, and are the Lord in Heaven, .and Love\nand \\Vifdom confiitutes the Life of the Angels, it is\nevident that their Life is of the Lord, yea, that it is\nthe Lord ; that they live from the Lord, the Angeh\nthemfelves confefs ; hence it may appear that Heav...\nen is ConjunClion with the Lord. But whereas var\nrious Ccaj1.metion is uiven with the Lord, and con.\nfequently\n\fTnE DIVINE PROVIDENcE. 67\nfequently one hath not the fame Heaven as another,\nit alfo follows, that Heaven is according to Con-\njunCtion with the Lord ; that there is a nearer and\nnearer Conjunttion, alfo one more and more remote,\nwill be feen in the following Article. In the pref-\nent Article we fhall fpeak of that ConjunCtion how\nit is effefted, and what it is : There is a ConjunCtion\nof the Lord with the Angels, and of the Angels with\nthe Lord, and thus a reciprocal Conjunttion : The\nLord floweth into the Life's Love of the Angels, and\nthe Angels receive the Lord in \\:Vifdom, and by this\nin their Turn conjoin themfelves to the Lord. But\nit is well to be attended to, that it appears to the\nAngels as if they conjoined themfelves to the Lord\nby Wifdom, but yet the Lord conjoineth them by\nWifdom to himfelf ) for their \\Vifdom is alfo from\nthe Lord : It is the fame if it is faid, that the Lord\nconjoineth himfelf to the Angels by Good, and that\nthe Angels in their Turn conjoin themfelves to the\nLord by Truth, for all Good\u00b7is of Love, and all\nJ'ruth is of Wifdom, But forafmuch as this recip-\nrocal ConjU.netion is an Arcanum, which few can un-\nderfi:and unlefs it be explained, I will unfold it, fo far\nas it can be done, by fuch Things as are adequate\nto the Comprehenfwn : In the Treatife concerning\n'J'Hi DrviNE LovE AND THE DIVINE vVISDOM,\nn. 404, 405, it is fhewn how Love conjoineth itfelf\nto Wifdom, viz. by the AffeCtion of knowing, from\nwhich is derived the AffeCl:ion of Truth, and by the\nAffeCl:ion of Underflanding, from which is derived\nthe Perception of Truth, and by the AffeCtion of\nfeeing that which is known and underfi:ood, from\nwhich is derived Tho1,1gh~: The Lord floweth into\nall\n\f68 AXGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nall thefe AffeCl:ions, for they are Derivations from\nthe Life's Love of every one, and the Angels re-\nceive that Influx in the Perception of Truth, and in\nThought, for in thefe the Influx r.ppears to them,\nbut not in the AffeCl:ions ; now forafmuch as Per-\nceptions and Thoughts appear to the Angels as if\nthey were their own, when neverthelefs they are\nfrom Affetl:ions, which are from the Lord, there-\nfore there is that Appearance, that the Angels recip-\nrocally conjoin themfelves to the Lord, when never-\nthelefs the Lord conjoineth them to himfelf, for Af-\nfetl:ion irfelf produceth them, Affeaion which is of\nLove being the Soul of them ; for no one can per-\nceive and think any Thing without Affeaion, and\nevery one perceiveth and think~th according to Af-\nfeCtion ; hence it is e'{ident, that the reciprocal\nConjunCtion of the Angels with the Lcrd is not\nfrom them, but feems as if from them. Such a\nConjunaion alfo the Lord hath with the Church~\nand the Church with the Lord, which is called the\ncele!lid and fpiritual Marriage~\n29. All Conjun3:ion in the fpiritual \\i\\Torld is ef-\nfeCted by !nfpeetion ; when any one there thinks of\nanother from the Affetl:ion of fpeaking with him,\nthe other immediately becomes prefent, and one\nfees the other Face to Face ; the fame Thing hap-\npens when any one thinketh of another from the\nAffeCtion of Love, but by this Afrettion ConjunCtion\nis produced, whereas by the other Prefence only :\nThis is peculiar to the fpiritual \\Vorld ; the Reafon\nis, becatJfc all there are fpiritual, not fo in the natu-\nral \\Vorld in which all are material; in the natural\nWorld the fame takes Place with Men in tl1e AtTec~\ntions\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 69\ntions- and Thoughts of their Spirit ; but whereas in\nthe natural \\Vorld there are Spaces, but in the [pi-\nritual World Spaces are only Appearances\u00b7, therefor~\nin the latter \\Vorld that is e~eCted aCtually, whi::h\nhath Place in the Thought of any Spirit. This In-\nformation is given in Order that it may be known\nhow the ConjunCtion of the Lord with the Angels is\neftefred, and the app:1tent reciprocal ConjunCtion of\nthe Angels with the Lord; for all the Angels turn\ntheir Faces to the Lord, and the Lord looketh at\nthem in the Forehead, and the Angels look at the\nLord's Eyes, the Reafon is, becaufe the Forehead\ncorrefpondeth to Love and its Affecrions, and the\nEyes correfpond to vVifdom and its Perceptions:\nNeverthelefs the Angeb from thernfelves do not\nturn their Faces to the Lord,. cut the Lord turnetl1\nthem to himfelf, and turneth them by Influx into\ntheir Life's Love, and by it entereth into their\nPerceptions and Thoughts, and fo converteth them.\nSuch a Circulation of the Love to the Thoughti',\nand from the Thoughts to the Love from Love,\nhath Place in all the human 1\\Iiad; which Cir-\nculation or Circle may be called the Circle of\nLife. On this Subjeft fee fame Things alfo in\nthe Treatife on THE DiviNE LovE AND \u00b7THE Dr-\nVINE \u00b7wrsDOM ; as that the Angels confl:amly turn\ntheir Faces to the Lord as the Sun, n. I 29 to I 34\u00b7\nThat all the Interiors as well of the Minds as of the\nBodies of Angels, are in. like Manner turned to the\nLord as a Sun, n. 135 to IJ9\u00b7 That every Spirit\nwhatfoever in like 1\\Ianner turns himfelf to hi:> ru-\nling Love, n. qo to 145\u00b7 That Love joins itfelf to\n\\Vifdom, and ca:1feth \\VifJom to be reciprocally .\njoined\n\f70 ' ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\njoined to it, n. 41 o to 4 r2. That the Angels are ia\nthe Lord, and the Lord in them : And forafmuch\nas the Angels are Recieients, that the Lord alone is\nHeaven, ri. 1 13 to I I '8.\n30. The Lord's Heaven in the natural \\Vorld is\ncalled the Church, and an Angel of this Heaven i$\na Man of the Church who is conjoined to the Lord,\nwho a!fo, after his Departure out of the World, be..\ncometh an Angel of the fpiritual Heaven : Hence it\nis evident, that the fame which is faid of the angelic\nHeaven, is to be underfi:ood of the human Heaven,\nwhich is called the Church. This reciprocal Con..\njunCtion with the Lord, whic;:h confl:itutes Beaven in\nMan, is revealed by the Lord in thefe Words in John,\n\" Abide in Me, and I in you; h~ that abidet!J in Me,\nand I in him, thefame lp;ingeth forth much Fruit ; for\nwithout l.Ie ye can do Nothing,\" xv. 4, 5, 1~\n31. Hence .it may appear, that the Lord is Heav.\nen, not only in common to all in Heaven, but alfo\nin particular to each Individual there; for every\nAngel is a Heaven in its leaft Form ; and from as\nmany Heavens as there are Angels, Heaven in com.\nmon exifl:s ; that this is the Cafe may be feen in the\nvVork on HEAVEN AND HELL, n. 51 tosS. Let not\nthen any one cheri!h this Error,which enters into the\nfirfl: Thoughts of many that the Lord is in Heaven\n'among the Angels, or that he is with them, as a King\nis in his Kingdom ; he is above them as to Sight in\nthe Sun there, but as to their Life of Love and \\Vif,.\ndam he is in them.\n32. II. That M;n by Creation is fuch, that he car.\nbe nearer and nearer conjoined to th( Lord, may ap..\npear from what is fhewn concerning Degrees, in th~\nTreatife\n\f*rHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 1t\n\\ .\nTreatife on TH :: DIVINE LovE AND THE DIVINE\n\\VISDOM, Part the Third, particubrly from the fol.-\nlowing Articles : That there are three difcrete De~\ngrees, or Degrees of Altitude, in Man by Creation,\nn. !230 to 1-35\u00b7 That thefe three Degrees are in\nevery Man by Birth, and that as they are opened,\nMan is in the Lord and the Lord in him, n. 236 to\n~.p. And that all PerfeClions increafe and afcend\nwith Degrees, and according to them, n. I 99 to\n204 : From which it is evident, that Man is fuch by\nCreation, that by Degrees he can be nearer and\nnearer conjoined to the Lord. But it is well to be\nunderfl:ood, what Degrees are, and that they arc of\ntwo Kinds, difcrete Degrees, or Degrees of Altitude,\nand continuous Degrees, or Degrees of Latitude,\nand what the Difference is between them ; alfo that\n\u20acvery Man by Creation, and thence by Birth, hath\nthree difcrete Degrees or Degrees of Altitude, and\nthat Man cometh into the firft Degree, which is call-\ned the natural Degree, when he is born, and that\nhe can increafe this Degree in himfelfby Continuity,\ntill he becometh rational ; and that he cometh into\nthe fecond, which is called the fpiritual Degree, if\nhe liveth according to the Laws of fpiritual Order,\nwhich are Divine Truths ; and that ' he may alfo\ncome into the third or celefl:ial Degree, if he liv-\neth according to the Laws of celeftial Order, which\nare Divine Goods. Thefe Degrees are\u00b7 opened in\nMan by the Lord according to his Life in the \u00b7world\naClually, but not perceptibly and fenfibly till after\nhis Departure out of the vVorld ; and as they arc\nopened and afterwards perfeCled, fo Man is nearer\nand nearer conjoined to the Lord. This Conjunc-\ntion\n\f'J'i. ANGl:LIC VVISDOM CONCERNING\ntion by nearer Approach may be increafed to Eter~\nnity, 2nd alfo is increafed in the Angels to Eternity ~\nbut Hill an Angel cannot arrive at the firfl: Degree\nof the Lord's Love and \\Vifdom, or attain it, be-\ncaufe the Lord is infinite, and an Angel is finite;\nand there is no Proportion between Infinite and\nFinite. Forafmuch as no one can underfbnd the\nSt;:.~e of lVlan, and the State of his Elcyation anJ\nApproximation to the Lord, except he knowetil\nthcfe Degrees, therefore they are particularly treat-\ned of in the Treatife on TnE DrviNE LovE AND\nTHE DIVINE \\?vrsno!'lr, from n. 173 to 281; which\nfee.\n33\u00b7 We !hall br1efl'y fhew how Man can be near->\ner conjoined to the Lord, and then how that Con-\njunction appears nearer and nearer. How ~Man is\nnearer and nearer conjoined to the Lord; this is done\nnot by Science alone, n_or by Intelligence alone, yea\nneither by \\Vifdom alone, bot by a Life conjoined\nto them: The Life of Man is his Love, and Love is\nmanifold ; in general there is a Love of Evil and a\nLove of Good ; the Love of Evil is the Love of A-\ndulrery,Revenge, Fraud,Biafphemy, and of depri,;ing\nothers of their Goods; the Love ofEvil in thinking\nand in doing thefe feels Pleafure and Delight; the\nDerivations, which are AffeCtions of this Love, arc\nas many as there are Evils to which it hath deter-\nmined itfelf; and the Perceptions and Thoughts of\nthis Love, are as many as there are Falfes which fa.\nvour thofe Evils and confirm them: Thefe Falfes\nmake one with the Evils, as the Underfianding\nmaketh one with the 'Vill, and they are not fepa\u00b7\nrated from each other, becaufe one is of the other._\nNow ~\n\f'f1IE Dr\\riNR PROVIDENCE. ...,..,\n\/J\nNow forafmuch as the Lord floweth into the Life's\nLove of every one, and by his Aif>!Ctions into his\nPaceptions and Thoughts, and not vice .'Verja, as\nwas faid above, it follows that he cannot conjoin\nhimfelf nearer, than as the Love of Evil with its\nAffeCtions, which are Lufts, is removed ; and foraf~\nmuch as thefe refide in the natural Man, and Man,\nwhatfoever he doeth from the natural lVlan, feeleth\nas ifhe acreJ from himfelf, therefore Man ought as\nfrom himfelf to remove the Evils ofthat Love, and\nthen in Proportion as he removeth them, in the fame\nProportion the Lord approacheth nearer, and join\u2022\neth hiinfelf to him : Any one may fee from Reafon\nthat Lufts with their Delights obfl:rufr and fuut the\nDoor againft the Lord, and that they cannot be call:\nout by the Lord, fo long as Man himfelf keepeth\n!he Door fhut, and preffeth from without and pre-\nven,teth it from being opened : That Man himfelf\nought to open it, is evident frof!l the Lord's \\Vords .\nin the Revelation, \" Behold !)land at the Door and\nknock j ifany Man hear my Voice, and open the Door,\nI will come in to him, and willJup with him, and he\nwith Me,\" iii. 20. Hence it is evident, that in Pro~\nportion as any one lhunneth Evils as diabolical, and\nas Obfl:acles to the Lord's Entrance, in the fame\nProportion he is more and more nearly conjoined to\nthe Lord, and he the moft nearly, who abominates\nthem as fo many black and fiery Devils, for Evil and\nthe Devil are one; and the Falfe of Evil and Satan\nare one; becaufe as the Influx of the Lord is into the\nLove of Good and its Affetl:ions, and by thefe into\nthe Perceptions and Thoughts, all which derive from\nthe Good, in which a Man is principled, that they\nlC are\n\f74 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nare Truths, fo the Influx of the Devil, that is, cf\nHell, is into the Love of Evil and its Affe(Jions,\nwhich are Lufl:s, and by thefe into the Perceptions\nand Thoughts, all which derive from the Evil in\nwhich a Man is principled, that they are Falfes',\nHr;w that Conjunflion appear.s nearer and nearer; in\nProportion as Evils are removed in the natural Man\nby fuunning and turning away from them, in the\nfame Proportion Man is nearer conjoined to the\nLord: And whereas Love and Wifdom, which are\nthe Lord himfelf, are not in Spac.e, fer AffeCtion\nwhich is ofLove, and Thought which is of \\:Vifdom,\nhave Nothing in common with Space, therefore the\nLord according to ConjunCtion by Love and Wif-\ndom appeareth nearer 1 and on the contrary accord-\ning to the Rejetlion of Love and Wifdom more\nremote: Space doth not e~ifl: in the fpiritual World,\nbut in that \\Vorld Difl:ances and Prefence are Ap-\npearances..according to Similitudes and Diffimilitudes\nof AffeCtions, for, as was faid, AffeCtions which are\nof Love, and Thoughts which arc of Wifdom, and\nin themfelves fpiritual, are not in Space; on which\nSubjetl fee what is fhewn in the Treatife on 1'HE '\nDIVINE LovE AND TH.E DIVINE WISDOM, n. 7 to\n10, and n. 69 to 72, and elfewhere. The Conjunc-\ntion of the Lord with Man, in whom EYils are re-\nmoved, is underfl:ood by thefe \\Vords of the Lord,\n\"Thepure in Heart jba\/1fee God,\" Matt. v. 8. And\nby thefe, \"He that hatb my Commandments, and keep-\netb them, I cz.uill make my Abode 'Z-vith him ;\" to have\nhis Commandments is to know them, and to keep\nhis Commandments is to love them, for it is alfo\nfaid\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 75\nfaid there, he who keepetb my Commandments, he it i.r\n\"..uho loveth A1c.\n34\u00b7 III. '!'hat Man, in Proportion as he h more\nltearly conjoined to the Lord, in thefame Proportion be-\ncometh \u2022u.:!for. Forafmuch as there are three Degrees\nof Life in Man by Creation, and thence by Nativity,\nof which above, n. 32, there are efpecially three\nDegrees of Wifdom in him ; thefe are the Degrees\nwhich are opened in Man according to ConjunCtion ;\nthey are opened according to Love, for Love is Con-\njunction itfelf: But the Afcem of Love according to\nDegrees is not perceived except obfcurely by Man,\n\\vhereas the Afcent of \\Vifdom is clearly perceived in\u00b7\nthofe \\vho know and fee what \\Vifdom is. The Rea-\nfan why the Degrees of Wifdom are perceived, is be-\ncaufe Love entereth by the AffeCtions into the Per-\nceptions and Thoughts; and thefe {hew themfelves\nin the internal Sight of the Mind, which correfponds\nto the external Sight of the Body ; hence it is that\n\\Vifdom appearetl-\n1, and not fa the Aftetl:ion of Love\nwhich produceth it: The Cafe is the fame with all\nThings which are done acrually by Man ; it is per-\nceived how the Body operates them, but not hO\\v\nthe Soul does; fa alfo it is perceived how a Man\nmeditates, perceives, and thinks, btlt not how the\nSoul of thefe, which is the AffeCtion of Good and\nTruth, produceth them. But there are three De.\ngrees of \\Vifdom, the natmal, fpiritual, and cclef.\ntial ; Man is in the natural Degree of Wifdom while\nhe liveth in the \\Vorld ; this Degree then can be\nperfected in him to its Height, and yet he cannot\nenter into the fpiritual Degree, hecaufe this Degree\nh not continued from the natural Degre;e by Conti.\nnuity,\n\f7~ ANG~l-IC VVlSD_\nOM CONCERN)NG\nnuity, but is joined t9 it by Correfpondenc~;:s: Man\nis in the fpiritual Degree of \\:Vifdom after Death,\n~nd this Degree alfo is fuch, tha,t it can be perfect-\ned to its\u00b7Height, but yet cannot enter the celefl:ial\nDegree of \\Vifdom, bccaufe neither is this Degree\ncontinued from the fpiritual by Continuity, but is\njoined to it by Correfpondences : Hence it may ap\u00b7\npear, that \\Vifdom can be elevated in a triplicate\nRatio, and that in each Degree it c~n be perfected\nin a firnple Ratio to its Height. He who compre-\nhendeth the Elevations and PerfectiQns of thefe De..\ngrees, can in fome Meafure perceive that, which i~\nfaid of Angelic 'Vifdom, that it is ineffable ; this al..\nfo is fo ineffable, that a thoufand Ideas of Thought\nof the Angels from their '\\iVifdom cannot prefent\nmore than one Idea of the Thought of Men from\ntheir Wifdom; thus 999 Ideas of the Thought of\nAngels cannot enter, for they are fupernatural :\nThat this is the Cafe, hath been given me often to\nknow by lively Experience. But, as was faid be\u00b7\nfore, no one can come into that ineffable W ifdom\nof the Angels, but by Conjunction with the Lord,\nand according to it, fo.r the Lord only openeth the\nfpirirual Degree and the celefiial Degree, but only\nin thofe who are wife from him ; and they are wife\nfrom the Lord, who cafl: out the Devil, that is, Evil\nfr.om themfelves.\n. 35\u00b7 But let not any one believe, that a Perfon\nhath \\:Vifdom becaufe he knoweth many Things,\nand perceiveth them in a certain Light, and can\nfpeak them intelligently, unlefs this be conjoined to\nLove; for Love by its Affections produceth it; if\njt is not conjoined to Love, jt is li~e a Meteor in the\n.Air\n\fJ THE DIVINE PROVIDENCl!. 77\nAir which vanifheth, and like a falling Star ; but\nWifdom conjoined to Love is like the peq-manent\nLight of the Sun, and like a fixed Star: Man hath\nthe Love of Wifdom, in Proportion as he hath an\nAverfion to the diabolical Crew, which are the Con-\ncupifcences of Evil and the Falfe.\n36. Wifdom, which cometh to Perception, is the\nPerception of Truth from the Affefl:ion thereat~ ef.\npecially the Perception of fpiritual Truth ; for there\nis civil Truth, moral \u00b7Truth, and fpiritual Truth ;\nthey who are in the Perception of fpiritual Truth\nfrom the AffeCtion thereof, are alfo in the Percep-\ntion of moral and civil Truth, for the AfreB:ion of\nfpiritual Truth is the foul of them. I have fame~\ntimes difcourfed with the Angels concerning \\i\\'if.\ndom, who faid, that Wifdom is ConjunB:ion with\nthe Lord, becaufe the Lord is \\Vifdom itfelf, and\nthat he cometh into that Conjunaion who rejceteth\nHell from himfelf, and cometh into it in the fame\nProportion as he rejetl:eth Hell : They faid that they\nreprefented to themfelves Wifdom as a magnificent\nand highly adorned Palace, to which there is an Af-\ncent by twelve Steps ; and that no one cometh to\nthe fir{l Step, but from the Lord by ConjunB:ion\nwith him, and that every one afcendeth according\nto ConjunCl:ion, and that a~ he afcends he perceiveth,\nthat no one is wife from himfelf, but from the Lord :\nAlfo that the Things which he knoweth, (japit,)\ncomparatively with thofe which he doth not know,\nare like a few Drops to a great Lake. By the\ntwelve Steps to the Palace of Wifdom, are fignified\nGoodneffes conjoined to Truths and Truths con-\njoined to Goodneifes.\n37\u00b7 IV.\n\f_\n78 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\n37\u00b7 IV. That },fan, in Proportion as be is more\nmarly conjoined to the Lord, in thefame Proportion\nbecometh happier. Tne fame Things which are faid\nabove, n. 32 to 34, of the Degrees of Life and of\n\\Vifdom according to ConjunCtion with the Lord,\nmay alfo be faid of the Degrees of Felicity; for Fe\"\nli~ities or Beatitudes and Delights afccnd, as the fu-\nperior Degrees of the :Mind, \\vhich are called fpirit-\nual and celefl:ial, are opened in Man, and thefe De~\ngrees after his Life in the \\Vorld increafe to Eter.\nnity.\n38. No Man, \\vho is in the Delights of the Con.\ncupifcences of Evil, can know any thing of the De-\nlights of the AffeCtions of Good, in which the An.\ngelic Heaven is, for thefe Delights are altogether\noppo!ite to each other in Internals, and thence inte-\nriorly in Externals, but in the Surface itfelf there is\nbut little Difference : For every Love hath its De-\nlights, eYen the Love of Evil in thofe who are in\nConcupifcences, as the Love of committing Adulte-\nry, of revenging, defrauding, fl:caling, committing\nOutrages, yea in the mofl: V\/icked of blafpheming\nthe holy Things of the Church, and fpitting out\ntheir Virulence againfl: God ; the Source of thefe\nDelights is the Love of Dominion from the\u00b7Love of\nSelf : Thefe Delights are from the Concupifcences\nwhich poifefs the Interiors of the Mind, flow from\nthem into the Body, and there excite Uncleanneifes,\nwhich titillate the Fibres ; thence, from the Delight\nof the Mind according to its Concupifcences, arifeth\nDelight of the Body; of what Kind the unclean\nThings are, which titillate the Fibres of their Bod-\nies, it is given every one to know after Death, in the\nfpiritual\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 79\nfpiritual World; they are in general cadaverous,\nexcrementitious, H:ercor:1ceous, filthy, and urinous\nMatters, for their Hells abound with fuch unclean\nThings ; which, that they are Correfpondences, fee\nfame Paifages in the Treatife on THE DIVINE LovE\nAND THE DIVINE \\AlisDoM, n. 422 to 424: But\nthefe foul Ddights, after they enter into Hell, are\nturned into direful PuniG1ments. Thefe Things\nare faiJ, that it may be underfl:ood what is the N a~\nture ofthe Felicity ofHeaven, of which in what now\nfollows ; for every Thing is kno\\Vn from its Op~\npofite.\n39\u00b7 The Beatitudes, Bleif;;dneif..:s, Delights, and\nPleafantneifes, in a Word the Felicities of Heaven,\ncannot be defcribed in Words, but in Heaven they\ncaq be perceived by the Senfe; for \\vhat is perceiv-\ned by the Senfe alone, cannot be defcribed, becaufe\nit does not come within the Ideas of Thought, and\nconfequently neither into \\V\"ords; for the Under~\n!landing alone fees, and fees the Things which are\nof \\Vifdom or of Truth, but not the Things which\nare of Love or of Good, wherefore thofe Felicities\nare inexpreffible, but fiill they afccnd in a fimilar\nDegree with \\Vifdom ; the Varieties of them are\ni_\nnfinite, and each of thefe ineffable : I have heard\nthis, and I have perceived it. Thefe Felicities how-\never enter, as Man removeth the Concupifcences of\nthe Love of Evil and the Falfc, as of himfelf, but\nftill of the Lord, for thofe Felicities are the Felicities\nof the Affeaions of Good and Truth, and thefe are\noppofite to the Concupifcences of the Love of Evil\nand the Falfe : The Felicities of the AfleCl:ions of\nGood and Truth begin from the Lord, therefore\nfrom\n\f8-J ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nfrom the Inmofl:, and thence diffufe themfelves to\nthe Infniors, even to the Ultimates, and fo fill the\nAngel, and caufe him to be as it were all Delight.\nSuch Felicities with infinite Varieties, are in every\nAffecrion of Good and Truth, efpecially in the Af-\nfedion of Wilaom.\n40. The Delights of the Concupifcences of Evil,\nand the Delights of the AffeB:ions of Good, cannot\nbe compared, becaufe inwardly in the Delights of\nthe Concupifcences of Evil the Devil is, and in\u00b7\nwardly in the Delights of the AffeCtions of Good\nthe Lord is ; if they are to be compared, the De\u00b7\nlights of the Concupifcences of Evil can only be\ncompared with the lafcivious Delights of Frogs in\nfi:agnant \\\u00a5aters, as alfo of Serpents in Stenches ;\nbut tr.~-C Delights of the AffeB:ions of Good may be\ncom?ared to the Delights of the Mind in Gardens\nand Shrubberies : For fimilar Things to what affeCt:\nFrogs <:nd Serpents, alfo affect thofe in the Hells\nwho are in the Concupifcences of Evil, and fimilar\nTi1ings to what affeB: the Mind in Gardens and\nShrubberies, alfo affeB: thofe in the Heavens who\nare in the Affections of Good : For, as '''as faid\nabove, corrcfpondent unclean Things affeCt , the\n\"Wicked, and correfpondent clean Things affeB: the\nGood.\n41. Hence it may appear, that in Proportion as\nany one is more nearly conjoined to the Lord, in\nthe fame Proportion he becometh happier : But this\nHappinefs rarely manifefl:s itfelf in the \\Vorld ; be-\ncaufe 1\\'Iari is then in a natural State, and what is\nNatural doth not communicate with what is Spirit-\nual by Continuity, but by Correfpo~dences, and this\nCommunication\n\fTnE DrVtN:E PROVIDtNcE. 81\nCommunication is only felt by a certain Q:Iid and\nPeace of .1\\Iind, which is proJuced efpecially after\nCombats againfl: Evils : But when 1\\lan putteth off\nthe natural State, and entereth into the fpiritual\nState, as is the Cafe after his Departure out of the\n\\Vorld, then the Fdicity above defcribed fucceffivc-\n1\ny manifefl:s itfelf.\n4-z. V.

In\njudging fl'om Appearance one would fuppofe, that\nby how\u00b7 much the nearer any one is conjoinetl to the\nLord, by fa much the lefs he is his own ; there is\nfuch an Appearance with all the \\Vicked, and alfo\nwith thofe who believe from Religion that they arc\nnot under the Yoke of the Law, and that no one\ncan do Good from himfelf; for both thefe Sorts of\nPerfons c<1n fee no otherwife, than that not to be at\nLiberty to think and to will Evil, but only Good, is\nnot to be at one's own Difpofal ; and becaufe they\nwho are conjoinetl to the Lord neithet \\\\\u00b7ill, nor can~\nthink and will evil, from the Appearance in them-\nfelves they conclude, that this is to be not their\nown ; when neverthelefs it is <lltogethcr the con-\ntrary.\n43\u00b7 There is infernal Liberty and there i~ celefl:ial.\nLiberty ; to think and will Evil is from infernal' Lib-\nerty, and fo far as civil and moral Laws do not pre-\nvent, to fpeak and do it; but to think and will\nGo0d is from ccle!lial Liberty, and fo far as Oppor-\ntunity is given, to fpeak and do it : \\Vhatfoever\nMan think.eth, \\Villeth, fpe<\\l.~eth, and doeth from.\nL Free-\\Yill,\n\f82 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNI!\\G\nFree-\\Vill, this he perceiveth as his own, for all\nLiberty is derived to l\\Ian from his Love ; where-\nfore they who are in the Love of Evil, perceive no\notherwife, than that infernal Liberty is.. real Liberty,\nbut they who are in the Love of Good, perceive that\ncelefiial Liberty is real Liberty, confcqucntly that its\nOppofite is Servitude to both : Still, however, it\ncann<Dt be denied by any, but that one or the other\nis Liberty, for two Liberties in themfclves oppofite,\ncannot be Liberties ; moreover it cannot be denied,\nthat to be led by Good is Liberty, and to be led by\nEvil is Servitude, for to be led by Good is to be led\nby the Lord, and to be led by Evil is to be led by\nthe Devil: Now forafmuch as every Thing appear-\neth to a Man as his mvn, \u2022vhich he doeth from Free-\nWill or Liberty, for this is of his Love, and to aB:\nfrom his Love is to ac( from Liberty, as was faid\nabove, it follows, that Conjunaion with the Lord\ncaufeth Man to appear to himfelf free, and confe-\nquently his own ; and in Proportion as his Con-\njunB:ion is nearer with the Lord, in the fame Pro-\nportion freer, and confequently more his own. The\nReafon why he appeareth to himfelf more d!flinll~y to\nbe his own, is, becaufe the Divine Love is fuch, that\nwhat is its own it willeth to be another's, therefore\nto be Man's and Angel's ; all fpiritual Love is fuch,\nefpecially Divine Love : And befides the Lord never\nforceth any one, becaufc no one Thing, to which any\none is forced appears as his own, and what doth not\nappear as his own, cannot be made of his Love, and\nfo appropriated to him as his own : vVherefore Man\nis led by the Lord continually in Freedom, and alfo\nis reformed and regenerated in Freedom. But on\nthis\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 8,.\n.)\nthis Subjett more w\u00b7ill be faid in what follows ;\nSomething alfo may be feen above, n. 4\u00b7\n44\u00b7 The Reafon ho~vever why 1\\'lan, by how\nmuch the more difl:inaly he appeareth to himfelf as\nhis own, by fo much the more evidc:ntly pcr-\nceiveth that he is the Lord's, is, becaufe in Pro-\nportion as he is more nearly conjoined to the\nLord, in the fame Proportion he becometh wifer, as\nwas fhewn above, n. 3+ to 36, and \\Vifdom teacheth\nthis, and he alfo percciveth it : The Angels of the\nthird Heaven, who are the wifefl: of the Angels, alfo\nperceive this, and likewife call it Liberty itfelf; but\nto be led by themfelves they call Servitude : They\ndeclare alfo the Reafon of this, viz. that the Lord\ndoth not flow immediately into the Things which are\nof their Perception and Thought from \\:Vifdom, but\ninto the AffeCtions of the Love of Good, and through\nthe latter into the former, and that they perceive the\nInflux in the Affe8:io~, whence is derived their\n\\Vifdom, and that then all which they think from\n\\Vifdom, appeareth as from themfeh\u00b7es, therefore\nas their own ; and that by this, reciprocal Conjunc-\ntion is effeeted.\n45\u00b7 Forafmuch as the Divine Providence of the\nLord hath for its End an Heaven out of the Human\nRace, it follows that it hath for its End the Con-\njunCtion of the Human Race with Irfelf, concerning\nwhich, n. :28 to 3I : Alfo that it hath for its End,\nthat l\\Ian may be more and more nearly conjoined\nto It, of which, n. 32, 33, for thus he is an interior\nHeaven : As alfo that it hath for its End, that .Man-\nby that ConjunCtion nny become wifcr, of which,\nn. 34\n\f84 AKGELIC vVISDOM COXCERNI~G\nn. 34 to 36 ; and that he may become happier, of\nwhich, n. 37 to 41, becaufe Man poffeifeth Heaven\nfrom \\Vifdom, and according to it ; and by it alfo\n:Felicity : And lafily, that it hath for its End, that\nMan may appear to himfelf more difrinaly as his\nown, and frill may perceive more evidently that he\n... is the Lord's, of which, n. 42 to 44\u00b7 All thefe\nThings are of the Divine Providence of the Lord,\nbecaufe all thefe Things confiitute Heaven, which\nis the End propofed!\nThat the Divine Providence of the Lord\nin all which it doeth, hath RifpeEt to\nwhat is Infinite and Eternal.\n46. IT'is well known in the Chrifl:ian \\iVorld,\nthat God is Infinite and Eternal, for in the\nDoCtrine of the Trinity, which hath its Name from\nAthanafius, it is faid that God the Father is Infinite,\nEternal, and Omnipotent, in like Manner God the\nSon and God the Holy Ghofr, and that neverthelef3\nthere are not three Infinites, Eternals, and Omnipo.,.\ntents, but One: From this it follows, that forafmuch\nas God is Infinite and Eternal, Nothing elfe but In-\nfinite and Eternal can be predicated of God. But\nwhat Infinite and Eternal is, cannot be comprehend,.\ned by Finite, and yet it can ; it cannot be compre-\nhended, becaufe Finite is not capable of Infinite ;\np.nd it can be comprehended, becaufe there are given\nflbfrract\n\fTnE DrviNE PRoviDENcE. Ss\nabfl-.raet Ideas, by which it can be feen that Things\nexifl:, although not what their ~ality is; fuch Ideas\nare given of Infinite, as that God becaufc he is Infi-\nnite, or the Divine becaufe it is Infinite, is Effe itfelf~\nthat it is Eifence aqd Subflance itfelf, that it is Love\nirfelf and vVifdom itfelf, or that it is Goodnefs itfelf\nand Truth itfelf, therefore that it is Itfelf, ( Ipfum,)\nyea that it is Man himfelf or perfea Man ; as ::.Uo \u00b7\nif it be faid that Infinite is All, thus that Infinite\n\\Vifdom is Omnifcience, and Infinite Power is Om-\n\"' nipotence. But {l:ill thefe Things fall but obfcureljr\n\\vithin the Thought, and from being incomprchen-\nfible perhaps come to be denied, unlefs the Thing;;\nwhich Thought deriveth from Nature, be abftraCted\nfrom the Idea, efpecially what it deri\\'eth from tho!e\ntwo Things proper to Nature\u00b7, Space and Time, for\nthefe cannot but end or terminate Ideas, and caufe ab-\nilraCt Ideas to be, as it were, not any Thing : But if\nthefe can be abftratl:ed by Man, as they are by an\nAngel, then Infinite can be comprehended by the\nThings aboYe recited ; and it can affo be compre-\nhended that lV!an is Something, becaufe he was cre-\nated by an Infinite God, who is All j alfo that Man\nis a finite Subihnce, becaufe he was created by an\nInfinite God, who is Subfl:ance itfelf ; as alfo, that\n1\\hn is \\:Vifdom, becaufe he was created by an Infi-\nnite God, who is Wifdom itfelf, and fo on ; for un-\nlefs the Infinite God were All, Subllance itfelf, and\n\\Vifdom itfelf, Man would not be any Thing, there-\nfore he would either be Nothing, or only an Idea of\nbeing, or an ideal Being, according to thofe Vifiona-\nries, who are called Idealifl:s.

They, by whom it can be\nfeen, think tht~.t Infinity of Space cannot exill:, there-\nfore neither Infinity of Time, which is the Eternal\nfrom whom all Things are, becaufe Infinite is with-\nput a firit and laft End, or without Bounds : They\nthink alfo, that neither can there exift Infinite from\nitfelf, becaufe from itfelf fuppofeth a Bound and Be-\nginning, or a Prior from which it is derived ; confe-\nquemly, that it is a vain Thing to fay Infinite and\nEternal from itfelf, becaufe that would be like fay-\ning Effe from itfelf, which is contradiEtory, for Infi-\nnite from itfelf would be Infinite from lnfmitc::, and\nEife from itfelf would be Etfe from Eife, and that In-\nfinite and Effe would either be the fame with Infi-\nl1ite\n\f88 ANGELIC \\tVISDOM CONCERNiNG\nnite or it would be Finite. From thefe and fuch\nlike Confiderations, which can be feen interiorly in\nthe Rational [Mind], it is evident that thei\"e exifl:-\neth Infinite in itfdf, and Eternal in itfelf, and that\nboth are the Divine, from which all Things are.\n49\u00b7 I know that many will fay with thcmfelves,\nhow can any one comprehend interiorly in his Ra-\ntional [Mind] any thing without Space and with-\nout Time, and that this not only is, but alfo that it\nis All, and that it is the very Thing, from \\vhich all\nThings are derived; but think interiorly, \u00b7whether\nLove or any Affeaion thereof, or \\Vifdom or any\nPerception thereof, yea whether Th~mght is in Space\nand in Time, and you will find that they an; not ;\nand whereas the Divine is Love itfelf and \\Vifdom\nitfelf, ir follows that the Divine cannot be concei\\'ed\nin Space and in Time, therefore neither can Infinite ;\nThat this may be more clearly perceived, confider\nwhether Thought is in Time and Space; fuppofe a\nProgreilion of it of ten or twelve Hours, may not\nthis Space of Time appear as of one or two Hours~\nand may it not alfo appear as of one or two Days,\ninafmuch as it appears according to the State of the\nAfFeEtion from which the Thought is derived ; ifit\nis an AffeEtion of Joy, in which Time is not\nthought of, the Thought of ten or twelve Hours is\nfcarcely of one or two; but the reverfe happens if\nthe AfFcEtion is of Grief, in which Time is attend\u00b7\ned to; thence it is eYident, that Time is only an\nA ppearancc according to the State of AffeCtion\nfrom which Thought is derived; it is the fame with\nthe Dithnce of Space in Thought, whether in walk-\ning, or in going a Journey.\nso. Forafmuch\n\fTu:E DIVINE Pr-.ovmr::~cE. 89\nso. Forafmuch as Angels and Spirits Jre Affec-\ntions which arc of Love, and Thoughts thence deri-\nved, therefore neither arc they in Space and Time,\nbut only in the Appearance thereof; the Appear-\nance of Space and Time is to them according to the\nStates of the Affetlions and thence ofthe Thoughts:\n'\\Vherefore when any. one thinks of another from\nAffetlioa, intently defiring to fee him, or fpeak with\nhim, the other aCtually prefents himielf. Hence it\nis, that there are prefent with every 1\\lan Spirits,\nwho are in a fimilar AffeCI:ion with him, evil Spirits\nwith him ,\\\u00b7ho is in the AffeCtion of fimilar EYil,\nand good Spirits with him who is in the Affc:Cl:!oa\nof fimilar Good; and they are as prefcnt as any.\none is with Company !hut up in the fame Room :\nSpace and Time contribute Nothing to Prefence, by\nReafon that AffeCtion and its confequent Thought\nare not in Space and Time, and Spirits and Angels\nare AffeCl:ions, and Thoughts dc::rived from them.\nThat this is the Cafe, hath been gi\\'en me to know\nfrom lively Experience of feveral Years ; and alfo\nfrom this Circumfrance, that I have converfed with\nmany after Death, as well with thofe in Europe and\nits various Kingdoms, as with thofe in Afia and\nAfrica, and their various Kingdoms, aml they \\Vere\nall near me ; whereas if they had been in Space\nand Time, a Journey mufl:. have intervened, ancl\nTime for that Journey. Yea, every Man knoweth\nthis to be fo from Somewhat inherent in himfelf or\nin his Mind, as was proved to me by this Confider-\nation, that no one thought of any Diflancc of Space,\nwhen I related that I had converfed \"v'l'ith any one\nwho died in Afia, Africa, or Europe, as for Exam~\nM p!e,\n\u2022\n\f90 ANGELIC v\\TISDOM CONCERNING\nple, with Calvin, Luther, MelanB:hon, or with any\nKing, Governor, or Priefi in a remote Country, and\nit did not even enter into their Thought to aik, How\ncould he converfe with thofe who lived there, and\nhow could they come to him and be prefent, \u00b7when\nneverthelefs Lands and Seas intervene? From this\nConfideration alfo it \\Vas evident to me, that no one\nthinks from Space and Time, when he thinks -of\nthofe who are in the fpiritual \\Vorld. That never-\nthelefs they have an Appearance of Space and Time;\nmay be fcen in the \\Vork on HEAVEN AND HELL7\nn. 162 to 169, 191 to 199\u00b7\n51. From thefe Confiderations then it may ap-\npear, that Infinite and Eternal, confequently the\nLord, is to be thought of without Space and Time,\nand that he c~n fo be thought of, alfo that lie is fo\nthought of by thofe \\vho think interiorly in the Ra~\ntional [Mind], and that then Infinite and Eternal is\nthe fame with the Divine : Thus do Angels and\nSpirits think : By Virtue of Thought abfhafted\nfrom Time and Space is comprehended the Divine\nOmniprefence and the Divine Omnipotence, alfo\nthe Divine from Eternity, and not at all by Thought,\nin which an Idea from Space and Time is inherent.\nH.ence it is evident, that God from Eternity can. be\nthought of, but never Nature from Eternity; confe-\nquently that the Creation of the Univerfe by God\ncan be, thought of, and not any Thing at all of\nCreation from Nature, for Space and Time are prop\u00b7\ner to Nature, but the Divine is without them. That\nthe Divine is with~ut Space and Time, may be fecn\nin the Treatiii;: on THE DIVINE LovE AND THE\nD1VlNE\n\u2022\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 9'1\nDIVINE 'VIsDoM, n. 7 to zc, 69 to 72, 73 to 76,\nand elfewhere.\n52. li. Cfhat 'ivbat is !t!finite and Eternal in itfc!f,\ntamzot but have ReJPcCl to what is fnjinite and Eternal\nfrom itfi'lfin Finites. By Infinite and Eternal in itfelf\nis meant the Divine itfelf, as was fhewn in the\npreceding Article ; by Finites are mean! all Things\ncreated from the Di\\'ine, and efpecially Men, Spirits,\nand Angels ; and to have RefpeB: to Infinite and\nEternal from itfelf, is to refpeB: the Divine, that is\nBimfelf in them, as a Man refpeB:eth or beholdeth\nhis Image in a Glafs: That this is the Cafe, is fhewn\nabundantly in the Treatife on THE DIVINE Lov.E\nAND THE DIVINE 'VISDOM, efpecially where it is\ndemonfrratcd, that in the created Univerfe there is\nan Image of Man, and that it is an Image of what\nis Infinite and Etermtl, n. 317, JI8, therefore an\nImage of God the Creator, that is, ofthe Lord from\nEternity. But it is to be underfrood, that the Divine\nin itfelf is in the Lord, but the Divine from itfelf is\nthe Divine from the Lord in Things created.\n53\u00b7 But for the better Underfranding of this, it\nmay be expedient to illufrrate it: The Divine cannot\nrefpeB: or regard any Thing but what is Divine, and\nit cannot regard or fee what is Divine any whe:-e\nelfe but in Things created from ltfelf; that this is\nthe cafe, is evident from this Confideration, that no\none can refpeC't another but from his own in himfelf;\nhe who loveth another, refpeB:eth him from his own\nLoYe in himfelf; he who is wife, refpetJ:eth another\nfrom his O\\o:'n \\Vifdom in himfelf; he may fee in-\ndeed that the other either loveth him or doth not\n~ove him, ~lfo that either he is wife or is not wife;\nbut\n\u2022\n\f92 ANGELIC \\V1sDOM CONC.ER~ING\nbut this he fee~h from Love and f:om \\Vifdom i11\nhimfelt~ wherefore he fo far conjoineth himfclf to\nhim as the other loveth himfelf as he loveth him, or\nfo far as the other is wife like himfelf, for fo they aa\nas one. It is the fame \\\\'ith the Divine in itielf, for\nthe Divine in irfelf c::mnot rcfpecr or fee itfelf from\nanother, as from a Man, Spirit, or Angel ; for they\nhave Nothing of the all\"creating Divine in itfelf: and\nto fee the Divine from another, in which there i~\nNothing of the Divine, would be to fee the Divine\nfrom no Divine, which is not po!li~le: Hence it is,\nthat the Lord is fo conjoined to Man, Spirit, and An~\ngel, that all, which hath Relation to the Divine, i;;\nnot from them but fron1 the Lord: For it is a known\nThing, that all the Good and all the True \\vhich any\none halh, is not from himfelf but from the Lord ;\nyea that not :my one can even name the Lord, or\npronounce his Names Jefus and Ghriil:, but from\nHim. Hence then it follo-ws, that Infinite and Eter.\nnal, which is the fame with the Divine, refpeCleth\nall Things infinitely in Finites\u00b7, and that it conjcineth\nitfelf to them according to the Degree of the Recep-\ntion of Wifdom and Love in them. In a Word, the\nLord cannot have his Manfron and dwell in Man and\nAngel, but in his O\\m, and not in their Proprium,\nfor th::~t is Evil, and if it \\vere Good, Il:ill it is Finite,\nwhich in itfelf and ft:om itfelf is not capable of Infi-\nnite. From thefe Confrderations it is evident, that\nit can never be, that Finite can fee Infinite, but that\nit can be, that Infinite can fee Infinite from itfelf in\nFinites.\n54\u00b7 It appears as if Infinite could not be conjoined\ntP Finite, pt:p~fe th~re is no Proportion between In,-\nfinite\n\u2022\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 93\nfinit~ anJ Finite, and becaufe Finite is not capable\nof Infinite, but neverthelefs ConjunCtion is given, as\nwell becaufe Infinite out of itfelf created all Things,\naccording to what is fhewn in the Treatife on THE\nDrviNE LovE AND THE DrvrNE Wrsnol'lr, n. 282\nto 284, as becaufe Infinite cannot refpeCl: any Thing\nelfe in Finites but Infinite from itfelf~ and that this\ncan appear with Finites as in them ; thus there is\ngiven a Ratio between Finite and Infinite, not from\n\u00b7. Finite, but from Infinite in Finite ; and alfo thus\nFinite is capable of Infinite, not l'inite in itfclf, but\nas in itfelf, originating in Infinite from itfelf in it.\nBut of this more in what now follows.\n55\u00b7 III. That the Divine Providence in all that it\ndoetb, hath Rejpe[l to what is h!finite and Eternalfrom\nitfdf, efpecially in fa\u00b7ving the Human Race. Infinite\nand Eternal in itfelf is the Divine itfelf, or the Lord\nin himfelf; but Infinite and Eternal from itfelf, is\nthe proceeding Divine, or the L01d in others creat-\ned out of himfelf, therefore in lVIen and in Angels,\nand this Divine is the fame with the Divine Provi-\ndence; for the Lord by the Divine from himfelf\nprovideth, that all Things may be contained in the\nOrder, in which, and for which, they were created;\nand forafmuch as the proceeding Divine operates\nthis, it follows that all that is the Divine Providence.\n56. That the Divine Providence hath HefpeEt\nin all that it doeth to what i~ Infinite and Eternal\nfrom itfclf, may appear from this Confideration,\nthat every created Thing from the }'irfr, which is\nInfinite and Eternal, proceedeth to lJltimates, and\nfrom Ultimates to the Firfr from whom it proceed-\n~d, as was !hewn in the Treatife concerning THE\nDIVINE\n\u2022\n\f\u2022\n94 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nDiviNE LovE AND THE DrviNE \\lvisnoM, in the\nPart where the Creation of the Univerfe is treated\nof; and forafmuch as in all its Progreffion, the Firfl:,\nfrom \\vhom it is derived, exifl:s intimately, it follows\nthat the proceeding Divine or the Divine Provi-\ndence in all that it doeth refpeeteth fome Image of\nwhat is Infinite and Eternal ; this it refpeeteth in\nall Things, but in fame to the Evidence of Percep-\ntion, but in others not; it prefenteth that Image to\nthe Evidence of Perception in the Variety of all\nThings, and in the FruCtification and Multiplication\nofall Things.\u00b7 An\u00b7Ima;e of~ubat is l1!finite andEter-\nnal in the Variety of all 'Things appears in this, that\nthere doth not exift any one Thing the fame with\nanother, neither can exiO: to Eterni~y: This is man-\nifeft to tne Eye in'the Faces of Mt>n from the firft.\nCreation, therefore alfo from their Minds, of which\ntheir Faces are the Types, and alfo from their Affec-\ntions, Perceptions, and Thoughts, for of thefe the\nMind confifl:s. Hence it is, that there do not exift.\nin the univerfal Heaven two Angels or two Spirits\nthe fame, yea neither can there exift to Eternity :\nThe like is true in Regard to every ObjeCt: of Sight\nin both \\Vorlds, as well the natural as the fpiritual :\nHence it may appear, that the Variety is Infinite and\nEternal. An Image ofwhat is b!.finite and Eternal in\nthe FruB!fication and Multiplication ofall 'Tbings, is\nevident from the Faculty inherent in Seeds in the\nYegetable Kingdom, and in Prolification in the ani-\nmal Kingdom, and efpecially from the Spawn of\nFifhes, thaf if they \\vere to fruCtify and multiply ac-\ncording to their Faculty, in an Age they would fill\nthe ppaces of ~he whole \\Vorld, yea ofthe Univerfe;\nfro1n\n\u2022\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 9.5\n, from which Confideration it is e'\u00b7ident, that in that\nFaculty there lieth concealed an Effort to propagate\nitfelf ad !J!finitum: And forafmuch as Frucrifications\nand Multiplications have not failed from the Begin-\nning of Creation, neither will fail to Eternity, it fol-\nlows that in that Faculty there is alfo an Effort to\npropagate itfelf to Eternity.\n57. It is the fame in l\\'len as to their AffeB:ions\nwhich are of Love, and their Perceptions which\nare of Wifdom? the Variety of both thefe is Infinite\nand Eternal; in like Manner their Fruuifications\nand Multiplications, which are fpiritual: No Man\npoffe!feth AffeB:ion ;md Perception fo like another,\nas to be the fame, neither is it poilible to Eternity :\nMoreover Affecrions can be frucrified and Percep-\ntions multiplied without End ; that Sciences can\nnever be exhaufled, is \\vell known. This Faculty\nof Frucrification and Multiplication without End,\nor to Infinity and Eternity, exifls in Things natural\nwith Men, in Things fpiritual with fpiritual Angels,\nand in Things cel~ftial with celeO:ial Angels. Af~\nfecrions, Perceptions, and Knowledges, are fuch not\nonly in general, but alfo every, even the.lcafl: Thing\nconftituem thereof, in particular. They are fuch,\n~ecaufe they exifr from what is Infinite and Eternal\nin itfelf by what is Infinite and Eternal from itfelf.\nBut forafmuch as Finite hath not any Thing of the\nDivine in itfelf, therefore there is not any Thing\nDivine, yea not the leafr, in l\\lan or Angel as his\nmvn, for Man and\u00b7.Angel is finite, and only a Re-\nceptacle, in itfelf dead; his living [Faculty] is from\nthe proceeding Divine joined to him by Contiguity,\nwhich\n\f96 ANGELIC VVISDOM CONCERNING\n;vhich appeareth to him as his own. That this is\nthe Cafe, will be feen in what follows.\n58. The Ground and Reafon why the Divine\nProvidence refpeB:eth what is Infinite and Eternal\nfrom itfelf, efpecially in faving the Human Race, is,\nbecaufe the End of the Divine Providence is to form\na Heaven out of the Human Race, as was !hewn\nabove, n. 37 to 4S; and whereas this is the End, it\nfollows, that it is the Reformation and Regenera~\nt.ion of Man, therefore his Sah\u00b7ation~ which the Di-\nvine Providence efpecially regardeth, in:1fmuch as\nHeaven exifl:s from thofe w\u00b7ho are faYed or regene-\nrate. And whereas to regenerate Man is to unite\nGood and Truth in him, or Love and \\Vifdom1 as\nthey a!.\"e united in the Divine which prvceedeth\nfrom the Lord, therefore the Divine Providence ef-\npecial!y regardeth this in faving the Human Race;\nthe Image of what is Infinite and Eternal is no where\nelfe in Man but in the Marriage of Good and Truth.\nThat the proceeding Divine eJre8:eth this in the Hu-\nman Race, is known from thofc;, who being filled\nwith the proceeding Divine, which is called the Holy\nGhofl, have prophefied, of whom Mention is made\nin the .\\Vord; and from thofe, who being illumina-\nted fee Divine Truths in the Light of Heaven; ef-\npecially in the Angels, who fenfibly perceive the\nPrefence, Influx, and Conjunction thereof; but they\nperceive alfo, that this Conjunction is no other than\nwhat may be called AdjunCtion.\n59\u00b7 It hath not heretofore been kno\\>\"11 that the\nDivine Providence, in all its Progrefiion with Man,\nhath Refpea to, or regardeth his eternal State;\nfor it cannot regarJ any Thing elfc, becaufe the\nDivine\n\fDivine is Infinite and Eternal, and Infinite and E-\nternal, or the Divine, is not in Time, and confc-\nquently all Things future are prefent to it; and for-\nafmuch as the Divine is fuch, it follows, that in all\nand every Thing which it effefteth, there is Eternal.\nBut they who think from Time and Space, with\nDifficulty perceiYe this, not only becaufe they love\ntemporal Things, but alfo becaufe they think from\nwhat is prefent in the World, and not from what\nis prefent in Heaven, this latter being as abfent from\nthem as !he End of the Earth: Bi.1t they who are\nin the Divine, t~ink alfo from what is Eternal when\nthey think from the prefent, becaufe they think\nfrom the Lord, faying with themfelves; What is that\nwhich is not Eternal? is not Temporal comparative-\nly as Nothing, and doth it not al{o become Noth-\ning-when it is ended? Not fo Eternal, which alone\nIs, becaufe its Being hath no End ; to think thus,\nis to think at the fame Time from wh<!t is Eternal\nwhile thinking from the prefent; and when Man fo\nthinketh, and at rhe fame Time fo liveth, then the\nproceeding Divine in him, or the Divine Provi-\ndence, in all its Progreffion refpecreth the State of\nhis eternal Life in Heaven, and leadeth him to it.\nThat the Divine in every Man, as well evil as good,\nregardeth what is eternal, will be feen in what fol-\nlows.\n6o. IV. '!'hat an Image of what is hifinite and\nEternal is extant in tbe Angelic Hea\u2022ven. Among the\nThings which are nece!fary to be known, the Angelic\nHeaven is alfo one, for every one, who hath any Re-\nligion, thinketh of Heaven, and wifheth to go thith-\n~r; but Heaven is not given to any but thofe, \\vho\nN kno\\V\n\fANCELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\n\u00b7 know 'the \\Vay to it, and walk therein ; this vVa:y \u00b7\nmay alfo in fome Meafure be known from a Know}-\nedge of the Nature and ~ality of thofe who con-\nilitute Heaven, and that no one becometh an Angel,\nor goeth to Heaven, but he who carrieth the Angelic\n[Principle] with him out of the \\Vorld, in \\Yhich\nAngelic Principle there is a Kno\\vledge of the \\Vay\nJerived from walking in it, and a \\Valking in the\nWay through a Knowledge of it. In the fpiritua!\n' \\Vurld alfo there are atl:ually \\Vays, which tend to\nevery Society of Heaven, and to every Society of\nHell ; and every one feeth his \\Vay as from him-\nfelf ; the Ground and Reafon why he feeth is, be-\ncaufe there are 'Nays there for every Love, and the\nLove openeth them, and leadeth to its A!fociates ;\nno one feeth any other \\Vays than thofe of his own\nLove : },rom this Confideration it is evident, that\nAngels are no other than celefiial Loves, for other-\n'l.vife they would not have feen the \\Vays tending to\nHeaven. But this may appear more clearly from a\nDefcription of Heaven.\n6 r. Every Spirit of Man is Affection and Thought\nthence derived, and forafmuch as every Affection is\nof Love, and Thought is of the Underfl:anding, eve-\nry Spirit is his ownLove and his own Underfl:anding;\nwhich is the Reafon that when a l\\1an thinketh only\nfrom his Spirit, as is the Cafe when he meditates <Jfll:\nHome with himfelf, he thinketh from the ilffeEtioa\nvvhich is of his Love ; hence it may appear, that\nMan, when he becometh a Spirit, as is the Cafe ;r[.\nter Death, is the Affection of his Love, and no oth-\ner Thought but what is of his AffeCtion ; he is an\nevil AffeCtion, which is Cupidity, if he hath beeR\nprincipled\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 99\nprincipled in the Love of Evil, and a good Affec~\ntion, if he hath been principled in the Love of Good ;\nand every one hath a good AffeCtion, as h~ hath\nfhunned Evils as Sins, and every one hath an evil\nAffeCtion, as he hath not fo !hunned Evils. . Now\nforafmuch as all Spirits and Angels are Afre\u00a3tions,\nit is evident that the univerfal Angelic Heaven is\nNothing but the Love of all the Affeaions of Good,\nand thence the \\iVifdom of all the Perceptions of\nTruth ; and forafmuch as all Good and Truth is \u2022\nfrom the Lord, and the Lord is Love itfelf and\nWifdom itfelf, it follows, that the Angelic Heaven\nis the Image of Him ; and forafmuch as the Divine\nLove and the Divine \\Vifdom in its Form is a Man,\nit alfo follows, that the Angelic Heaven cannot be\notherwife than 'in fuch a Form: But more will be\nfaid of this in the following Article.\n62. The Ground and Reafon why the Angelic\nHeaven is an Image of what is Infinite and Et1=rnal,\nis, bec::J.ufe it is an Image of the Lord, and the Lord\nis Infinite and Eternal. The Image of his Infinity\nand Eternity appears in this, that there are Myriads\nof Myriads of Angels, of which Heaven confifts, and.\nthat they confl:itute as many Societies as there are\ngeneral AffeCtions of celt:fl:ial Love, and that each\nAngel in every Society is diilinftly his own Affec.,\ntion ; and that from fo many AffeCtions in general\n~md in particular the Form of Heaven exifl:s, which\nis as one before the Lord, juil as a Man is.one; and\nthat this Form is perfeCted to Eternity according to\nPlurality, for in Proportion as more enter the Form\nof the DiYine Love, which is the Form of Forms,\niq. the fame Proportion the Union is more perfcB:.\nFrom\n\fIOO ANGELIC 'VISDOM CON~E.RNING\nFrom thefe Confiderations it manifefily appears, that\nan Image, of what is Infinite and Eternal is extant\nin the Angelic Heaven.\n63. Fro\u00b7m the Knowledge of Heaven given by\nthis fhort Defcription, it is evident, that the Affec:-\ntion, which is of the Love of Good, con!litutes\nHeaven in Man : But who knoweth this at this\nDay? Yea, who knoweth what tl}e AffeB:ion of\nthe Love of-Good is, alfo that the Affections of the\nLove of Good ~re innumerable? yea, infinite ? For,\nas hath been obferyed, every Angel is diftinB:ly his\nown Affection, and the Form of Jieaven is the Form\npf all the Affettiqns of the Divine ~ove there. No\nother can unite all thefe AffeB:ions into this Form,\nbut He who is Love itfelf and at the fame Time\n'\\Vifdom itfelf, and at once Infinite and Eternal ;\nfor Infinite and Etern,al is in all of the Form, Infi-\nnite in its Conjunction, and Eternal in its Perpetu-\nity ; if Infinite and Eternal were taken away from.\nit, it would fall in Pieces in a Moment : \u00b7who elfe\n~an unite. Affetti~ns into Form? ye~, who elfe can\nunite one Confrituent thereof ? for one Confl:ituent\nthereof cannot ~e united but froni the univerfal Idea\nof all, and the unjverfal Idea of all from the partic:-\nular Idea of each : There are Myr~ads of Myriads\nwho compofe that Form, and there are Myriad$\nwho enter it every Year, and will do fo to Eternity:\nAll Infants enter it, and as many Adults as there are\nAffettions of the Love of Good. From thefe Con-\nfiderations again may be feen an Image of what is\nInfinite and Eternal in the Angelic Heaven.\n64. V. 'That to rifpcfl what is lrifinite and Eternal\nin forming the Angelic Heaven, that it may be before\n' tbe\n\fTHE DIVINE ' PROVIDENCE. IOI\nthe Lord as one Man, wbich is his Image, is the lnti-\nmum [inmqfl End or Purpofe] of the Di\u00b7vinc Provi-\ndence. That the univerfal Heaven is as one Man\nbefore the Lord, and it~ like Manner every Society\nin Heaven, and that hence it is, tho.t every .Angel is\n~n a perfeQ: human Form, anc.l that this is the Cafe,\npecaufe God the Cre\u00ab.tor, who is the Lord from\nEternity, is a Man, may be feen in the Work on\nHEAVEN AND HELL, n. 59 to 86. .Alfo that hence\n~here is a Correfpondence of all Things of Heaven\nwith all Th~ngs of Man, n. 87 to 102. That the\nuniverfal Heaven is as one 1'4an, hath not been f.ccn\npy me, becaufe th~ univerfal Heaven cannot be feen\nby any but the l,ord only ; but that an entire Soci-\nety of Heaven, greater or Ieifer, appeareth <}S one\nMan, hath fomei:imes been f~en, and then .it was\n~old me, that the greatefl: Society, which is Hea-ven\nin its whole Complex, appeareth in like Manner,\nput before the Lord ; and that this is the Reafon\nwhy every Ange~ is in all the particulars of his\nForm, a Man.\n65\u00b7 Forafrnuch as the univerfal Heaven in the\nSight of the Lord is as one Man, therefore Heaven\n~s diflinguifhed into as many common Societies as\nthere are Organs, Vifcera, and Mefi1bers in Man ;\nand each common Society into as many lefs com-\nmon or particular Societies, as there are larger Parts\nin each Vifcus or Organ : from which Conlldcra~\ntion it is evident what Heaven is. Now forafmuch\nas the Lord is perfetl: l\\1an, and Heavrn is the ]mage\nof Him, therefore to be in Heaven, is ca!led being\nin t,he Lord ; that the Lord is perfeCt Man, may\npe feen in the Treatife on THE DIVINE LovE\nAND\n\f102 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\nAND THE DIVINE WisDoM, n. II to 13, n. 285\nto 289.\n66. From thefe Confiderations this Arcanum,\nwhich may be called Angelic, may in fome Meafure\nbe fecn, that every Affeaion of Good, and at\nthe fame Time of Truth, in its Form is Man ; for\nwhatfoever proceedeth from the Lord, deriveth from\nhis Divine Love that it is an AiTeaion of Good, and\nfrom his Divine \\Vifdom that it is an AffeCl:ion of\nTruth. The AffeCl:ion of Truth, which proceedeth\nfrom the Lord, appears as Perception, and thence\nThought of Truth in Angel and Man, by Reafon\nthat Perception and Thought are attended to, and\nthe Affeaion from which they proceed but little,\nwhich neverthelefs proceeds from the Lord with th~\nAffeaion of Truth as one.\n67. Now forafmuch as Man by Creation is a\nHeaven in its leafl: Form, and thence an Image of\nthe Lord; and forafmuch as Heaven confi!ls of as\nmany AiTefrions as there are Angels, and every Af-\nfeaion in its Form is a Man, it follows, that it is a\nContinuum (continual Operation or Endeavour) of\nthe Divine Providence, that Man may be made a\nH eaven in Form, and thence an Image of the Lord;\nand forafmuch as this is done by the AffeCl:ion of\nGood and Truth, it is a Continuum of the Divine\nProvidence that Man fnould be made that Affeaion :\nThis therefore is the Continuum of the Divine\nProvidence ; but its lntimum (inmofi End or Pur-\npofe) is, that Man fhould be in this or that Society\nin Heaven, or in this or.that Part in the Divine ce-\nJe!lial Man, for fo he is in the Lord. But this is ef-\nfeCl:ed with thofe, whom the Lord can lead to Heav-\nen;\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I03\nen ; and \\vhereas the Lord forefeeth this, he alfo\ncontinually provideth that Man ihould be made\nfuch ; for fo every one, who fuifereth himfelf to\nbe led to Heaven, is prepared for his Place in\nHeaven.\n68. Heaven, :1.s was faid above, is divided into as\nmany Societies, as there are Organs, Vifcera, and\nMembers in M;:m, and in thefe, no one Part can be\nin any other Place than its own: Since therefore\nAngels are fuch Parts in the Divine celeftial Man,\nand no others are made Angels but fuch as had\nbeen Men in the World, it follows, that the Man\nwho fuffers himfelf to be led to Heaven, is continu\u2022\nally prepared by the Lord for his Place, which i:>\ndone by fuch an AffeCl:ion of Good and Truth a3\ncorrefponds thereto : Into this Place alfo every Man\nAngel, after his Departure out of the vVorld, is en..\nrolled. This is the Intimum of the Divine Providence\n' concerning Heaven.\n6g. But the Man who doth not fuffer himfelf to\nbe led to, and enrolled in Heaven, is prepared for\nhis Place in Hell; for Man from himfelf continu-\nally tends to the lowefi Hell, but is continually with-\nheld by the Lord; and he, who cannot be with-\nheld, is prepared for a certain Place \"there, in which\nhe is alfo enrolled immediately after his Departure\nout of the \\Vorld ; and this Place there is oppofite\nto a certain Place in Heaven, for Hell is in Oppofi-\ntion to Heaven ; wherefore as a J:,hn Angel, ac-\ncording to the AfFeB:ion of Good and Truth, hath\nhis Place affigned him in Heaven, fo a Ma!l Devil,\naccording to the Affection of Evil and the Falfe,\nhath his Place ailigned him in Hell ; for two Op-\npofite~,\n\fI04 ANGELIC \\\\TrsDOM CONCERNING\npofites, difpofed in a fimilar Situation againfl: each\nother, are contained in Connexion.

That Man hath th~ Fac~\nulty of Undcrftan\u2022jing, which is Rationality, and\nthe Faculty of thinking, willing, fpeaking, and\ndoing that which he underfl:ands, which is Lib..\nerty ; and that thefe two Faculties are from\nthe Lord in Man, was difcuifed 'in the Treatife\non THE DiviNE LovE AND . THE DIVINE Wis~\nDOM, n. 264 to 270, 425 ; and alfo above. But\nforafmuch as feveral Doubts may occur refpeB:ing\nboth thefe Faculties, when they are thought of, I am\ndefirous in this preliminary Part to add a few Obfer..\nvations concerning the Liberty of aaing according\nto Reafon in Man. It is however to be noted firft,\nthat all Liberty is ofLove, infomuch that Love and.\nLiberty are one ; and whereas Love is the Life of\nMan, Liberty alfo is of his Life ; for every Delight\nwhich a Man hath, is from. his LoYc, no Delight be.\ning given from any other So1,1rce, and to aB: from\nthe Delight of Love is to aCl from Liberty, for De..\nlight leadeth a Man a& a River doth that which is\ncarried away by its Stream, Now forafmuch as\nthere are feveral Kinds of Love, fome concordant,\nand fame difcordant, it follows, that in like Manner\nthere are feveral Kinds of Liberty : They may\nhowever in general be reduced to three Kinds,\nNatural, Rational, and Spiritual. NATURAL LIB-\n~RTY every Man hath by Virtue of the hereditary\n. Principle\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENC!. 109\nPrinciple received at his Birth ; under the Influence\nof this Principle Man loveth Nothing elfe but him-\nfelf and the '\u00a5orld ; his firfi: Life is Nathing elfe ;\nand forafmuch as all Evils exifi: from thefe two\nLoves, and thence Evils alfo become ObjeCts of Love,\nit follows, that to think and will Evils is his natur-\na! Libeny ; and that when he hat~ confirmed them \u2022\nin himfelf by Reafonings, he doeth them from Lib-\nerty according to his Reafon: \u00b7when Man thus\naCl:eth, it is by Virtue of his Faculty which is called\nLiberty; and when he thus confirmeth Evils, it is\u00b7\nby Virtue of his Faculty which is called Rationality.\nAs for Example ; it is by Virtue of the Love to\nwhich Man is born, th~t he willeth to commit Adul-\ntery, Frauds, Blafphemi~s, Revenges; and when\nhe confirmeth thefe Evils in himfdf, and thereby\nmaketh them lawful, then from the Delight of the\nLove of them he thinketh and willeth them freely\nas it were according to Reafon, and fo far as civil\nLaws do not refl:rain, fpeaketh and cloeth them : It\nis from the Divine Providence of the Lord, that Man\nis allowed fo to do, becanfe he hath Free-'\"Nill or\nLiberty. Man is .in this Liberty by Nature, b12caufe\nhe is fo by Birth; and _they are in this Liberty who\nhave confirmed it in thernfelves by I~cafonings from\nthe Delight of the Love of Self and of the \\\u00b7Vorld.\nRATIONAL LmERTY is grounded in the Love of\nFame for the Sake of Honour or Interefr; the De-\nlight of this Love is to appear in External Form as\na moral Man; and forafmuch as he lo~\u00b7eth this Rep-\nutation, he doth not defraud, nor commit Adultery,\npor indulge in a Spirit of Revenge or Blafphemy ;\nand whereas he confirms himf~l{. by his Reafon in\nabfi:aining\n\fI 10 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNIN<l\nabftaining from fuch Crimes, he alfo from Liber~\nty accotding to his Rcafon atleth fincerely, juftly,\nchallely, and friendly ; yea he can from Reafon\nfpeak well in Fa,\u00b7our of fuch Virtues: But if his\nRational [Faculty] is only natural, and not at the\nfame Time fpiritual, this Liberty is only external\nl~iberty, and not internal Libertv, for neverthelefs\n. . '\ninteriorly he doth not lovt! thofe Virtues, but only\nexterior!J for the Sake of Reputation, as was faid;\nwherefore the good ACtions which he doeth are in\nthemfelvcs not good : He can alfo fay, that they\nought to be done for the Sake of the public Good,\nbut this he doth not fay from any LoYe of the\npublic Good, but from the Love of his own Honour\nor Intereft ; therefore his Liperty deri\\'eth Nothing\nfrom the Love of the public Good; neither doth\nhis Reafon, for this affentcth to his Love: 'Vher~..\nfore this rational Lib:::rty is interior natural Jjberty.\nT his Liberty alfo, from the Divine Prov~dence of the\nLcrd, is ld r to every one. S:piRlTUAL LIBERTY\nis grounJed in the Love of Eternal Life ; into this\nLove ;md its Delight none cometh, but he who\nthinks that Evils are Sins, and therefore doth not\nwill them, and at the fame Time hath Refpea: to the\nLord : As foon as l'vian doeth this, h~ is in that Lib-\nerty ; for no one hath power not to will Evils\nbecaufe they are Sins, and therefore not to do them,\nexcept it be from interior or fuperior Liberty, whicll\nis from his imerior or fuperior Love. This Liber-\nty doth not appear in the Beginning as Liberty~\nbut ftill it is fo, and afterwards it appeareth to be fo,\nand then Man afteth from real Liberty according\nto real Reafon, by thinking, willing, fpeaking, and\n\u00b7 doing\n\fTH.E DIVINE PROVID\u00a3NCE. t I I.\nCloing wh:it ts good and true. This Liberty increaf.-\nc:th, as natural Liberty decreafeth and becometh a\nServant, arid it joineth itfelf with rational Liberty,\nand purificth it. Every one may come into this\nLiberty, if fo be he willeth to think that there is fuch\na Thing as eternal Life, and that the Delight and\nBleffednefs of Life in Time for a T.imc, is only as a\ntranfiem Shadow, compared with the Delight and\nBleffednefs of Life in Eternity to Eternity ; and this\na Man may think if he will, becaufe he hath Ration-\nality and Liberty, and becaufe the Lord, from whom\nthefe two Faculties are derived, continually giveth\nhim Power.\n74\u00b7 II. That whatfoever a ll1an doeth from Libcr\u2022\nty, whether it be of Reafon or not of Reafon, provided\nit be according to his Recifon, appeai\u00b7eth to him as his\nown. What Rationality is, and what Liberty, which\nare proper to Man, cannot be known more clearly,\nthan by a\u00b7 Comparifon of Men with Beafls, for the\nlatter have not any Rationality or Faculty of under-\nfl:anding, nor any Liberty or Faculty of willing free-\nly, and thence they have no Underflanding ancl\n\\Vill, but inflead of Underfbnding they have Sci-\nence, and inflead of Will Affection, both natural :\nAnd whereas they have not thefe two Faculties,\ntherefore neither have they Thought, but inil:ead of\nThought internal Sight, w_hich maketh one with\ntheir external Sight by Correfpondcnce. Every\nAffetlion hath its Companion as a Confort ; the\nAffection of natural Love hath Science, theAffection\nof fpiritual Love Intelligence, and the Affection of\nceleflial Love \\Vifdon1 : For Aflection without its\nCompanion, or as it were connubial Partner, is not\nany\n\fI 12 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nany Thing, for it is like an E\u00a3fe (Being) without\nExiftence, or like a Subftance without a Form, of\nwpich not any Thing can be predicated ; hence it is,\nthat in every created Thing there is Something,\nwhich may be referred to the Marriage of Good and\nTruth, as hath been abundantly fhewn above ; in\nBeafl:s there is a Marriage of AffeCtion and Science,\nthe AffeB:ion herein being that of natural Good,\nand the Science that of natural Truth; Now foraf-\nmuch as AffeCtion and SCience in Beafts act entirely\nas one, and their AffeCtion canot be elevated above\ntheir Science, neither can their Science be elevated\nabove their AffeCtion, and if they are'elevated, they\nare elevated both together, and forafmuch as they\nl1ave not any fpiritual Mind, to which, or into the\nLight and Heat of which they can be elevated, there-\nfore they have not the Faculty of underflanding or\nRationality, nor the Faculty of willing freely or\nLiberty, but only mere natural AffeCtion with its\nScience ; the natural AffeCtion, which they have, is\nthe Affetiion of feeding themfelves, providing an\nHabitation, propagating their Kind, fhunning and\nflying from Harm, with all Science or Knowledge\nrequifite thereto ; and forafmuch as their State of\nLife is fuch, they cannot think within themfelves, I\nwill do this, aqd will not do that, nor can they think,\nI know or do not know fuch a Thing, fiill lefs, I\nunderftand fuch a Thing, or I love fuch a Thing7\nbut they are carried ~way of their particular Affec-\ntion by Science, without Rationality and Liberty.\nThe Caufe or Groutld of their being fo carried away\nis not from the natural, but from the fpiritual World 1\nfor there doth not exifl: any Thing in the natural\n\u2022 \\Vorld\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\f1'ru DIVINE f>-ROVID.LXCE.

Every one from Rationality not obfcured\nmay fee or comprehend, that Man, without an Ap-\npearance that it is his own, cannot be in any Affec-\ntion of knowing, nor in any AffeCtion of underftand-\ning, for all Delight and Pleafure, therefore every\nThing of the \\Vill, is from the AffeCtion which is of\nLove ; who can will to know and will to underfl:and,\nunlefs he hath fame Pleafure of AffeCl:ion ? And\nwho can have that Pleafure of Affeaion, unlefs that\nby which he is affeCted appeareth as his own ? If it\nwere none of his, but all of another's, that is, if any\none from his own AffeCtions ihould infufe any Thing\ninto the Mind of another, who had no AffeCtions of\nknowing and underilanding as from himfelf, would\nthe other receive it, yea, would he be able to re~\nceive it, would he not be as that which is called\n_, Brute,\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I I5\nBrute, or as a Stock ? Hence it may appear mani-\nfefUy, that although every Thing enters by Influx, '\nwhich a Man perceiveth and thence thinketh and\nknoweth, and according to Perception willeth and\ndoeth, frill it is of the .Divine Providence of the\nLord, that it fhould appear as Man's, for otherwife,\nas was obferved, Man would receive Nothing, there-\nfore could not be gifted with any lntelligence and\nWifdom. It is \\veil known, that all Good and\nTruth is not Man's but the Lord's, and yet that it\nappeareth to Man as his ovm, and forafmuch as all\nGood and Truth fo appeareth, all Things alfo of\nthe Church and of Heaven, therefore all Things of'\nLove and Vvifdom, alfo of Charity and Faith, fo ap-\npear, and yet none of them is Man's; no one can\nreceive them from the Lord, unlefs it appears to\nhim that he perceiveth them as from himfelf. From\nthefe Con'fiderations this Truth may be manifd1,\nthat whatfoever a Man doeth from Liberty, whether\nit be of Reafon or not of Reafcn, provided it be\naccording to his Reafon, appeareth to him as his\nown.\n77\u00b7 \"Who is not able to underfl:and, by Virtue of\nhis Faculty, which is called Rationality, that this or\nth;lt Good is ufeful to the Community, and that this\nor that Evil is noxious to the Community, as that\nJufl:ice, Sincerity, and conjugal Chaflity, are ufeful\nto the Community, and that Injuflice, Infincerity.,\nand \\Vhorcdom committed with the Wives of oth.\ners, are noxious to the Community ; confequently\nthat thefe Evils in themfelves are mifchievous, and\nthat thofc Goods in themfelves are beneficial? \\Vho\ntherefore, if he be fo difpofed, cannot make thofe\nGoods\n\fI I G A:r-~Gr:LIC '\\VJSDO.:.\\I CONC:ER NING\nGooJs ~nd E\u00b7\u00b7iis the Goods and Evils of his Reafon,\ninafmuch <J.S he hath Rationality, and he hath Lber-\nty ?

But in Order that it\nmay be known how Man is regenerated, thefe three\nThings are to be confidered; what his firH State is,\nwhich is a State of Damn:.1tion ; what his fecond\nState is, which is a State of Reformation ; and what\nl1is third State is, which is a State of Regeneration.\nTheJi::Jl State oflVIan, 7.-:\u2022hich is a State ofDamnatioll,\nevery l\\I2.n hath by an hereditary Principle from\nhis Parents, for ]'dan is thence born to the Love of\nSelf and the Love of the vVorld, and from thefe\nLoves as Fountains, to Evils of all Kinds ; the De-\nlights cf thefe LoYes are the Delights by which he is\nled, arrJ thefe Defights caufe him not to know that\nhe is in E\\'ils; for every Delight of Love is felt no\notherwife than as Good ; wherefore alfo Man, un-\nlefs he is regenerated, knoweth no other than that\nto love himfelf and rhe \\V\"orlJ above all '1 hings, is\neffcntial Good, and that to domineer over all, and\npofTefs the \\\u00a5ealth of all others, is the fupreme\nGood :'This is the Ground of all Evil, for he rc-\ngardeth no other Perfon from a Principle of Love\n.but himfclf alone, and if he regardeth another from\na Principle of Love, it is as one Devil regardeth\nanother, or as one Thief another, when they aa as\none. They who confirm in themfelves thefe Loves~\nand the Evils flowing from them, from the Delight\nthereof, remain natural and become fenfual-corpo-\nreal ; and in their own Thought, \\vhich is that of\ntheir Spirit, they are infane ; but ftill they can,\nwhile they arc in the \\Vorld, fpeak and act ration.\nally an4,wifely, inafmuch as they are Men, and con.\nfequently have Rationality and Liberty, yet this alfo\nthey do from the Love of Self and of the \u00b7world.\nThefe\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I 23\nT!1efe after Death, when they become Spirits, can~\nnot have any other Delight, than that which they\nhad in their Spirit in the 'llorld, and that Delight\nis the Delight of infernal Love, which is turned into\nundelightful, dolorous, aad dire, which in the \\Vord\nis meant by Hell-Torment and Hell-Fire. Hence\nit is evident that the firrl: State of Man is a State of\nDamnation ; and that they are in it, who do not\nfuff::r themfclves to be regenerated. 'Theflcond State\nof Nian, which is a State of Riformation, is, when\nI\\lan beginncth to think of Heaven from the Joy\nthat is therein, and thus to think of God, from\nwhom he hath the Joy of HeaYen; at firfl:, how-\never, he thinks thus from the Delight of the Love\nof Self, heave11ly Joy being to him that Delight ;\nbut io long as the Delight of that Lm;e reigns, to-\ngether with the Delights of the Evils flowing there-\nfrom, he cannot underfl:and otherwife, thc.n tlnt to\ngo to IIeaven is to pour out Prayers, to hear Preach-\nings, to receive the Lord's Supper, to give to the\nPoor, to help the Needy. to endow Churches and\nHofpitals, and fuch like Things ; neither doth 1\\Ian\nin this State know otherwife, than that barely to\nthin!~: the Things, which Religion teacheth, cffeaeth\nSalvatio11, whether it be that which is called lfaith,\nor that which is called Faith and Charity : The\nRcafon why he underfi:andeth no other, than that\nto think thcfe Things effeCl:eth Salvation, is, bec:mfe\nhe thinketh Nothing of the Evils, in the Delights of\nwhich he is, and fo long as their Delights remain,\nthe E\\'ils alfo remain, inafmuch as the Delights\nthereof :;.rife from the Concupifccnce of them, which\nConcupifcence r;ontinually in!pireth them and alfo\nproduceth\n\fl24 ANGELIC \\VrsDOM CONCERNING\nproduceth them, when no Fear operates to prevent\nit. So long as Evils remain in the Concupifcences,\nand thence in the Delights of the Love of them,\nthere is not any Faith, Charity, Piety, Worfhip, ex-\ncept only in Externals, which caufe thofe Virtues to\nappear before the World as if they exifted, but yet\ndo not exitl : They may therefore be compared to\n':Vaters flowing from an impure Fountain, which\ncannot be drunk. So long as Man is fuch, that he\nthinketh of Heaven and of God from Religion, and\nNothing of Eviis as Sins, he is fl:iil in his firfl State :\nBut he cometh into the fecond State, or State of\nRefo;mation, when he beginneth to think that there\nis fuch a Thing as Sin, and more fo when he think-\neth that this or that is a Sin, and when he exploreth\nit a little in himfclf, and willeth it not. 'The tbird\nState of ]dan, which is a State of Regeneration, is a\nTaking up 2.nd Continuation of the prior State, and\nbeginneth when Man defifl:eth from E,,i!s as Sins,\nand proceedetl1 as he fhunneth them, and is perfeEt:-\ned as he fighteth againfl them, and in this Cafe as\nMan overcomcth from the Lord, he is regenerated.\n'With the regenerate Man the Order of Life is invert-\ned, and from natural he is made fpiritual ; for the\nnatural Principle feparated from the fpiritual is con-\ntrary to Order, and the fpiritual Principle is accord-\ning to Order ; wherefore a regenerate Ivlan afl:eth\nfrom Charity, and maketh that the Principle of his\nFaith, which is the Principle of his Charity. But\nHill he is made no more fpiritual, than in Proportion\nas he is in Truths ; for every Man is regenerated by\nTruths, and by a Life according to them; for by\nTruths he knoweth Life? and by Life he doeth\nTruths; \"\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I 2S\nTruths ; thus he conjoineth Goodnefs and Truth,\nwhich is the fpiritual Marriage, in which is Heaven.\n85\u00b7 The Ground and Reafon why Man is re.\nformed and regenerated by thofe two Faculties,\nwhich are called Rationality and Liberty, and that\nwithout them he cannot be reformed and regenera-\nted, is, becaufe by Rationality he can un<)erfl:and\nand know what Evil is, and what Good is, and\nthence what is falfe and what is true; and by Lib-\nerty he can will that \\vhich he underftandetl1 and\nknoweth : But fo long as the Delight of the Love of\nEvil reigneth, he cannot freely will what is good\nand true, and make them Principles of his Reafon, \u00b7\nwherefore he cannot appropriate them lo himfelf ;\nfor, as was fhewn above, the Things \\vhich a !v1an\ndoetb from Liberty according to Reafon, are appro-\npriated to him as his own, and unlefs they are ap-\npropriated as his own, Man is not reformed and\nregenerated ; and then firfl: he aaeth from the De-\nlight of the LoYe of Goodnefs and Truth, \\vhen the\nDelight of the Love of Evil and Falfe is removed ;\nfor two Delights of Love oppofite to each other are\nnot given at the fame Time ; to aa from the De-\nlight of Love, is to aCt from Liber~y, and forafmuch\nas the Reafon f:wour\\':th the Love, it is alfo to aa\naccording to Reafon.\n86. Forafmuch as Man, as well he who is wicked\nas he who is good, hath Rationality and Liberty, a\nwicked as well as ..1 good Man can underihnd Truth\nand do Good, but a wicked Man (:annat do fo from\nLiberty according to Reafon, whereas a good Man\ncan, becaufe a 'l.vicked Man is in the Delight of the\nftovc of Evil, but a good l\\1an is in the Delight of\nthe\n\f) ::;6 ANG.ELIC \\VrsDOM CONCERNING\nthe Love of Good ; \u00b7wherefore the Truth which a \u2022\nwicked Man underfbndeth, and the Good which\nhe doeth, are not appropriated to him, but they :1rc\nappropriated to a gqod 1\\'lan ; and without Appro-\npriation as his own, Reformation and Regeneration\nare not gii\u00b7en, for Evils with Fal:cs are with the\n\"Wicked as it w\u00b7ere in the Centre, and Goods with\n'1'ruths in the Circumference ; but Goods with\nTruths with the Good are in the Centre, and Evils\nwith Falies in the Circumference ; and in both\nCafes the Things \\Vhich \u00b7are of the Centre difFufe\nthemfelves to\u00b7 the Circumference, as Heat from Fire\nin the Centre, and Cold from Ice in_ the Centre ;\nthus Good in the Circumference with the \\Vicked\nis defiled by the Evils of the Centre, z.nd Evils in\nthe Circumference with tJle Good are rendered\nmrld by the Goods of the Centre ; ~md this is the\nReafon, why E\\'ils do not condemn a regenerate\nMan, and Goods 2o\u00b7 not fave ,an unregenerate Man.\n8;. V.

Man\nby Virtue of Rationality hath Power to underfi:and,\nand by Virtue of Liberty Power to will, both as from\nhimfelf; but the Power of willing Good from Lib-\nerty, and thence of doing it according to Reafon,\nno\n\fTHE DIYINE PRO\\TDENCE. I'27\nno one hath but the Regenerate: A ;>--ickcJ Man\nfrom Liberty can only wiil Evil, and do it according\nto his Thought, which by Confinnatio!1s he maketh\nas it were of Rcalon ; for Evil can be confirmed\nalike as Good, but Evil by .Fdbcies and Appear~\nanccs, which, \\Yhen they are confirmed, become\nFalfes, and when Evil is confirmed, it appeareth as\nof Reafon.\n88. En:ry one, \\vho hath alij' Thought from in-\nterior Underfl:anding, may fee, that the Pnv.rer of\nwilling ( pqfje 'i.\u00b7dh) and the Power of underlhnd~\ning, is not from 1\\Ian, but from Him who hath Pow-\ner itfelf (ipjum Pqlfo), that is, who hath Po\\Ycr in\nits Effence : Confider only, whence is Power [ Abil-\nity, or to be able]? Is it not from Him who hath it\nin his own elfential Power, that is, who hath it in\nHimfelf, and confequent!y from Himfclf ? \\Vhere-\nfore Power in itfelf is Divine. To a11 Power there\nmufl be Leave (Copia), which is to be given, and\nthus a Dctern1ination from what is interior and fu-\npericr to Self; the Eye eannot fee from itfelf~ nor\nthe Ear hear from itfelf, neither can the i\\louth fpeak\nfrom itfelf, nor the Hands aCt from themfe!Yes ;\nthere mufl be Leave given, and thence Detcrmi\u00b7na-\ntion fror!l the Mind ; neither c?.n the Mind thin!:\nand will this o:: that from itfelf, unlefs there be Some-\nthing interior or fuperior which determines the\n1\\.iind to it; it is the iame with the Po\\ver of u::dcr-\nfianding and the Po\\\\\u00b7er of willing, thefe cannot be\ngiven by any other than by Him who in Himfeif can\n\\\\ill and can unJerftand. From which Confidera-\ntions it is evident, that thofe two Faculties, which\n;tre called R~tiona!ity and Liberty, are from the\nLonJ,\n\f128 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nLord, and not from Maa ; and forafmuch as they\nare from the Lord, it follows, that Man willeth Noth..\ning from himfelf, and underfrandeth Nothing from\nhimfelf, but only as it were from himfelf. That\nthis is the Cafe, every one may confirm in himfelf1\nwho knoweth and believeth, that the 'Will of all\nGood, and tN-c Underftanding of all Truth, is from\nthe Lord, and not from Man. That lvfan cannot\nta.~~ any Thingfrom bin!fe!f, and cannot do any Tbing\nfrom himfe!f, the Vlord teacheth in John, Chap. iii.\n27. Chap. xv. 5\u00b7\u00b7\n89. Now forafmuch as all Voiition is from Love,\nand all Underfl:anding is from Wifdom, it follows,\nthat to be able to will, or in other Vvords, the Pow-\ner of willing, is from the Divine Love, and to be\nable to underftand, or in other Words, the Power\nof underftanding, is frofn the Divine Wifdom,\ntherefore both from the Lord,. who is Divine Love\nitfelf and Divine Viifdom itfelf. Hence it follows:;~\nthat to aa from Liberty according to Reafon, is\nfrom no other Source. Every one aCt:eth according\nto Liberty, becaufe Liberty like Love cannot be fep..\narated from Volition ; but in Man there is given in\u2022\nteiior Volition or interior Will, and ex~erior Voli4\ntion or exterior Will, and he can aa according to\nthe exterior, and at the fame Time not a<:cording\nto the interior ; in this Cafe he acts the Hypocrite\nanll Flatterer; and yet exterior Volition is from\nLiberty, becaufe it is from the Love of appearin~\notherwife than he is, or from the Love of fame\nEvil which from the Love of his interior Will he in~\ntendeth ; but, as was faid above, a wicked Man\n~annat from Liberty according to his Reafon do\nany\n\fTm:: DIVINE PROVIDE~~cE. 129\n:my Thing bnt Evil, for he cannot from Liberty ac-\ncordin~ to Reafon do GooJ; he can indeed do\nGood, but not from interior Liberty, which i~ his\nproper Libeny, from which hi:;; exterior Liberty C.e-\nriveth this Property, that ~t is not Good.\n90. It is faid that man can\u00b7 bt: reformed and re-\ngenerated, in Proportion as by the aoove two Facul-\nties he can be letl to acknowledge that all the G{)od\nand all the Tmth which he thinketh anLl doeth, is\nfrom the Lord, and not from himfelf: The Rcaion\nwhy Man cannot acknowledge this but by tho!\"c tW()\nFaculties, is, becaufe thofe t\\\\\u00b7O Faculties are from\nthe Lord, and they are of the Lord in Man, as is\nevident from what hath been faid above ; where-\nfore it follows, that Man cannot do thi.> from him-\nfelf, but from the Lord ; but fl:ill he can do it as it\nwere from himfelf, this th~Lord giveth to cvtry one:\nLet it be fuppofed that he believeth from himfelf, fl:iil\nwhen he becometh wife, he will acknowledge that it\nis not from himfdf, othenvife the Truth which he\nthinketh, and the Good which he doeth, is not tr'\"e\nand good in itfelf, for the Man is in.them, and not\nthe Lord in them, and Good in which a l\\hn is, if\nit be for the Sake of Salvation, is meritorious Good,\nbut Good in which the Lord is, is not meritorious.\n91. But that the Acknowledgment of the Lord,\nand the Acknowledgment that all Good and all\nTruth ig from Him, caufeth :Man to oe reformed and\nregenerated, is whlt few c:1n fee with the Under-\nfianding, for it may be thought, of what Confc-\nquence is that Acknowledgment, feeing the Lord is\nomnipotent, and willeth the Salvation of all, and\nthence can and will cfl't:D: it, if fo be lw be moved\nR to\n\f130 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nto Compaffion? But to think thus is not from the\nLord, therefore neither is it from the interior Light\u00b7\noftht: Underfl:anding, that is; from any Illumination;\nwherefore what Acknowledgment operateth, we\nihall here briefly explain. In the fpiritual V!orld,\nwhere Spaces are only Appearances, \\Vifdom pro-\nduceth Prefence, and Love produc~th ConjunCtion;\nand vice ve1ja: There is given an Acknowledgment\nof the Lord from Wifdom, and there is given an\nAcknowledgment of the Lord from Love ; the Ac\u00b7\nknowledgment of the Lord from Wifdom, which\nviewed in itfelf is only a Knowledge of him, is giv..\nen from DoB:rine, and the Acknowledgment of the\nLord from Love is given from a Life a_ccording to\nDoctrine; the latter giveth ConjunCtion; but the for\u00b7\nmer Prefence: This is th~ Reafon, why they who\nrejeC1: DoC1:rine concerning the Lord, remove them-\nfelves from him; and inafmuch as they alfo rejecr\nLife, they feparate themfelves from him : \\Vhereas\nthey, who do not reject DoC1:rine, but Life, fuch are\nprefent, yet feparatcd : They are like Friends, who\nconverfe together, but do not mutually love each\nother ; and they are like two, whereof the one fpeak\u2022\neth \\vith the other as a Friend, but hateth him as an\nEnemy. That this is the Cafe, is alfo known from\nthe common Idea, that he who teacheth well, and\nliveth well, is faved, but not he who teacheth well\nand liveth ill ; alfo that he Vv'ho doth not ac\u2022\nknowledge God, cannot be faved. From this Con-\nfideration it is evident, what Sort of a Religion it is;\nto think of the Lord from Faith, as it is called, and\nnot to do any Thing from Charity; wherefore the\nLord faith,\" Why ccr!ly~ Me Lord, Lord, and do not\nthe\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE.

'l'hat the ConjrmClion of the Eord \u00b7with\nMan, and the reciprocal ConjunClion of1\\t!an with the\nLord, is e.ffeCled by tbofe two Faculties. ConjunCtion\nwith the Lord and Regeneration are one, for in\nProportion as any one is conjoined to the I~ord, in\nthe fame Proportion he is regenerate : Wherefore\nall that is faid above of Regeneration may be faid\nof Conjunuion, and what is here faid of Conjunc-\ntion may b~ [aid of Regener;1tion. That there is a\nConjunqion of the Lord .with Man, and a recipro-\ncal ConjunCl:ion of Man with the Lord, the Lord\nhimfelf teacheth in John, \".;1bide in Me, and I in\nyou; whcfo q_bideth in !VIe, and I in him, the fame\npearcth much Fruit,\" xv. 4, 5\u00b7 \"In that Day ycjba\/1\nknow, tbat ye are in Me, and I in you,\" xiv. 20. Any\none may fee from Reafon alone, that there is not\n;my Conjunt:l;ion of Minds, unlefs it be alfo recipro-\ncal, and that reciprocation conjoincth ; ifone loveth\nanother, and is not beloved in his Turn, in this Cafe,\nas the one approacheth, the other retireth ; but if he\nis beloved in Return, then <Js one approacheth, the\nother alfo approacheth, and CoujunCl:ion is effeCl:ed ;\nfor Love willeth to be beloved ; this is inherent in it,\nand in Proportion as it is beloved again, in the fame\n:Proportion it is in itfelfand in its Delight. Hence it is\nevident, that if the Lord only loveth Man, and were\nnot in .his T~rn to be beloved by Man, the Lord\nwoulct\n\fI.)~ ANGELIC \\VIS,D0!-1 CONCERN1\nING\n'would approach, and Man would retire; thus the\nLord would conrinua1ly will to meet Man, and to\nenter in to him, and Man V\u00b7muld turn himfelf away\nand depart ; with thofe who are in Hell, this is the\nCa:e, but with thofe who are in Heaven, there is a\nmutual ConjunCtion. Forafmuch as the Lord will-\neth ConjunCtion with Man, for the Sake of his\ns~Ivation, he provideth alfo that in Man there\njhould be Reciprocation or a reciprocal Principle;\nthe reciprocal Principle in Man is, that the Good\nwhich he \\villeth and doeth from Liberty, and the\nTruth which be thinkcth and fpeaketh from that\nVlill accorcing to Reafon, ihould appear to him as be-\ning from himfelf; and that that Good in his Will and\nthat that Truth in his Underfianding, ihould appear\nas his own ; yea, they appear to Man as from him-\nfelf, and as his, altogether as if they were his own,\nthere is no Difference; attend only and confider,\nwhether a Man with any one of his Senfes perceiv-\neth otherwife ; oft hat Appearance as if from him-\nfelf, fee above, n. 74 to 77; and of Appropriadon\nas bis own, n. 78 to 8 I : The only Difference is,\nthat Man ought to acknowledge, that he doth not\ndo Good and think Truth from himfelf, but from\nthe LorJ ; and confequently that the Good which\nhe doeth, and the Truth which he thinketh, is not\nhis own: To think thus from fome Degree ofl.ove\nin the \\Vill, becaufe it is the Truth, efletl:eth Con-\njunClion ; for thus Man looketh to the Lord, and\nthe Lord looketh to Man.\n93\u00b7 'What the Difference is between thofe, who\nbelieve all Good to be from the Lord, and thofe\n~ho believt:: Goo9, to be from themfelves, it hath\nbeen\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. f33\nbeen given both to hear and to fee in the fpiritual\nW o:ld : They who believe Good to be from the\nLord, tum their Faces to him, and receive the De-\nlight and Bleifednefs of Good; but they who believe\nGood to be from themfelves, look to themfelves,\nand think with themfelves that they have deferved\nit; and forafmuch as they look to themfelves, they\ncannot but perceive th~ Ddight of their own GooJ,\nwhich is not the Delight of Good, but the Ddight\nof Evil ; for the Proprium of 1\\hn is Evil, and the\nDelight of Evil perceived as Good is Hell. They\nwho have done Good, and thought it was from\nthemfelves, if they do not after Death receive this\nTruth, that all Good is from the Lord, mix with\ninfernal Genii, and at length aa as one with them ;\nwhereas they who receive the above Truth, are\nreformed ; but no others receive it, except thofe\nwho have refpeB:ed God in their Life : To refpeEt\nor look up to God in their Life, is Nothing elfe but\nto fhun Evils as Sins.\n94\u00b7 ConjunCtion of the Lord with Man, ~nd re-\nciprocal ConjunCtion of Man with the Lord, is\netreB:ed by Man's loving his Neighbour as himfelf,\nand loving the Lord above all Things : To love his\nNeighbour as himfelf, is Nothing elfe but not to aa\ninfincerely anu unjufl:ly with him, not to hate him\nand burn with Re\\'enge againfr him, not to blaf-\npheme and defame him, not to commit Adultery\nwith his Wife, and not to do other fuch like Things\nagainfr him : Who cannot fee, that they who do\nfuch Things, do not love their Neighbour as them-\nfelves ? but they who do not do fuch Things, be-\ncaufe they are Evils againfl: their Neighbour, the\nfame\n\fIJ4 ANGELIC '\\VISDOM CONCERNING\nfame deal fincerely, jufl:ly, friendly, and faithfully\nwith their Neighbour, and forafmuch as the Lord\n. deeth in like Manner, a reciprocal ConjunCl:ion is\ncffeCl:ed ; and when ConjunCl:ion is reciprocal, then\nwhatfoever Man doeth to his Neighbour, he doeth\nfrom the,Lord, and whatfoever Man doeth from the\nLord is Good ; and then his Neighbour is not to\nl1im the mere Perfon, but Good in the Perfon. Tq\nlove the Lord above all Things, is Nothing elfe, but\nnet to do Evil to the \\Vord, becaufe in the 'i\\Tord\nthe Lord is, nor to do Evil to the holy Things of\nthe- Church, becaufe in the holy Things of the\nChurch the Lord is, nor to do Evil to the Soul of\nany one, becaufe the Soul of every one is in the Hand\nof the Lord ; they who fhun thefe Evlls as enor.\nmous Sins, the fame love the Lord above all Things ;\nbut this no others can do, except fuch as love their\nNeighbour as themfelves, for Love to the Lord and\nneighbourly Love are conjoined together.\n95\u00b7 Forafmuch as there is a ConjunCl:ion of the\nLord with Man, and of Man with the Lord, there-\nfore there are two Tables bf the Law, one for the\nLord, and the other for Man : In Proportion a~\nMan, as from himfelf, doeth the Laws of his own Ta~\nble, in the fame Proportion the LorJ giveth him tq\ndo the Laws of his Table : But the 1\\lan who doth\nnot do the Laws of his own Table, which all relate\n\/ to the Love of hi~ Neighbour, cannot do the l ..aws\nof the Lord's Table, which all relate to the Love of\nthe Lord: How can a Murderer, a Thief, an Adul-\nterer, and a falfe \\Vitnefs, love the Lord? Doth not\nReafon diEtate, that to be fuch, and to lnve the\nLorJ, is contradiC1:0ry ? ls not the Devil fuch a.\none,\n\f'fru DiviNE PRoviDENcE. 135\none, and can he do otherwife than hate the Lord ?\nBut when 1\\hn turneth away from Murders, Adul-\nteries, Thefts, and falfe Tefiimony, as infernal, then\nhe can love the Lord, for then he turnetl1 his Face\nfrom the Devil to the Lord, and when he turneth\nhis Face to the Lord, Love and \\Vifdom. is given\nhim, thefe Principles entering into a Man by his\nFace, and not by the hinder Part of his Head. Ind\nafmuch as in this and in no other Manner Conjunc-\ntion with the Lord is effeaed, therefore thofe two\nTables are called the Covenant, and a Covenant is\nbetween two.\ng6. VII. That the Lord preflrveth thoje two Fac-\nulties in !11an in\u00b7violab!e, and as it were Jacrcd, in\nevery Progrdfion of his D;.,.;ine Providence. The\nReafons are, becaufe Man, without thofe two Fac-\nulties, would not have Underfi:anding and \\:Vill, and\ntherefore would not be Man ; alfo, becaufe Man,\n\u00b7without thofe two Faculties, could not be conjoined\nto the Lord, and therefore could not be reformed\nand regenerated ; and further, becaufe Man, with-\nout thofe two Faculties, would not have Immortality\nand eternal Life. That this is the Cafe, may in.;\ndeed be feen, ftom the Knowledge of what Liberty\nand Rationality are, (which are thofe two Faculties,)\nwhich was fhewn in the foregoing Pages ; but it\ncannot be feen clearly, unlefs each Reafon be pre.\nfented to the View as a Conclufjon, wherefore it\nmay be expedient to illufi:rate each. Cfbat Man\nwithrmt thofe two Faculties 'l.oould not have TtVill and\nUndeljhmding, an\"' therefore would not be !11an ; for\n!-.'Ian hath Will from no other Source than from\nthe ~ower of willing freely as from himfelf; and\nfreely\n\f136 ANGELIC WIS!)0.:.\\1 CO~CERN1NG\nfreely to will, as from himfelf, is from the Faculty\ncontinually given him by the Lord, which is called\nLiber~v ; and Man hath Underfl:anding from no\nI \u2022\nother Source than from the Power he hath, as of\nhimfelf, to underfland whether a Thing be of Rea..-\nfon or n,ot ; and to underiland \\Vhether it be of\nReafon or not, is from that other Faculty continu-\nally given hin1. by the Lord, which is called Ration-\nality. Thefc Faculties j.oin themfdves together in\n.Man like the Will and the Underflanding ; as fOF\nInfi:mce, becaufe Man can will, he can alfo under-\nfiand, for Volition is not given without Underfi:and-\ning, Underfi:anding being its Confort or Compan-\nion, without which it cannot be;. wherefore with\nthe Faculty, which is called Liberty, is given the\nFaculty which is called Rationality ; and further,\nif you take away Volition from Underftanding, you\nunderfi:and Nothing, and in Proportion as you will,\nin the fame Proportion you can underfiand, provi-\nded there be at Hand and at the fame Time are\nopened thofe Affifiances, which are called Knowl-\nedges, for thefe are like Infi:ruments in the Hands\nof Artificers : It is faid that in Proportion as you\nwill, you can undcrfi:and, that is, in Proponion as\nyou love to underfiand, for \\i'ilill and Love aa as\none ; this indeed appears as a Paradox, but it ap-\npears fo to thofe only \\vho do not love to under-\nfiand, and therefore will not, and they who will\nnot, fay they can~ot: But who they are that cannot\nunderfiand, and who they that can with Difficulty\nunderfland, will be fhewn in the following Article.\nWithout Confirmation it is evident, that if Man\nhad not \\Vill from the Faculty which is called Lib.\nerty,\n\fTI-11: bnriNE PRoV:DENCE. I 37\ntrty, and Underfranding from the Faculty which is\ncalled Rationality, he would not be l\\lan. Beafb\nhave not thefe Faculties ; it appears as if Beafls\ncould alfo will, and could underfl:and, but they can-\nnot ; it is natural AffeCtion. which in itfelf is Defire\n(Cupido,) with its concomitant Science, wbich alone\nleadeth and prompteth them to do what they do :\nThere is indeed a ci\\'il and moral Principle in their\nScience, but they are not above Science, bccaufe\nthey have no fpiritual Principle, which &iveth to\nperceive the moral Principle, and thence to think it\nanalytically : They can indeed be taught to do any\nThing, but this is only the natural Principle, which\n:tddeth itfelf to their Science, and at the fame Time\nto their AffeCtion, and is re-produced either by\nSight or by Hearing, but is never made a Principle of\nThought, and frill lefs of Reafon in them : Some-\nthing on this SubjeCt may be feen above, n. 74\u00b7\nThat Man 'Without thofe t-wo Faculties could not be\nconjoined to the Lord, and therefore could not be re-\nformed and regenerated, was {hewn abo\\'e ; for the\nLord refideth in thofe two Faculties in Men, as well\nin the 'wicked as in the good, aDd by them he join-\neth himfelf to every Man : Hence it is, that a wick-\ned Man, as well as a good Man, can underfland,\nand hence a wicked Man hath in his Power the\n\\:Vill of Good and the Under11anding of Truth,\n:mel the Reafon why they are not in Acr, is from\nthe Abufe of thofe Facuhies. ihe true Ground\nand Caufe why the Lord, refideth in thofe Faculties\nin every Man, is from the Influx of the Will of the\nLord, in that he willeth to be received by Mau,\nand to make his Abode wi~h him, and to give him\nS the\n\f138 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nthe Felicities of eternal Life ; thefe Things arc of\nthe \u00b7will of the. Lord, becaufe they are of his Divine\nLove. It is this \\Viii of the Lord, which caufeth it\nto appear in Man as of himfelf that he thinketh,\nfpcaketh, willeth, and aB:eth. That the Influx of\nthe \\:Vill of the Lord hath this Operation, may be\nconfirmed by many Particulars from the fpiritual\nVvorld ; for fornetimes the Lord filleth an Angel\nwith hi~ Divine Principle, fo that the Angel know-\neth no other than that he is the Lord ; in this\nManner were thofe Angels filled, who were feen\nby Abraham, Hagar, and Gideon, who therefore\ncalled themfelves Jehovah, of which Mention is\nmade in the \\Vord : So alfo can one Spirit be filled\nby another, until he doth not know but that he is\nthe other, as hath often been feen by me : More-\nover it is known in Heaven, that the Lord operateth\nall Things by Volition (per Vdle,) and that what\nhe willeth is done. Hence it is evident, that thofe\ntwo Faculties are the Means, by which the Lord con-\njoineth himfelf to Man, and by which he caufeth\n1\\'lan to be reciprocally conjoined to him. But how\nMan by thofe two Faculties is reciprocally conjoin-\ned, confequently how by them he is reformed and\nregenerated, was faid above, and more will be faid\nof it below. 'That Man without thofe two Faculties\n\u2022would net have Immortality and Eternal Life, follows\nfrom what hath juft been faid, that by them there\nis effeCted ConjunCtion with the Lord, and alfo Ref-\normation and Regeneration ; by ConjunCtion Man\nhath Immortality, and by Reformation and Regen-\neration eternal Life : And forafmuch as by thofe\nFaculties there is a ConjunCtion of the Lord with\nevery\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 139\nevery Man, as well the Wicked as the Good, as\nwas faid above, therefore every Man hath Immor-\ntality ; but he alone hath eternal Life, that is, the\nLife of Heaven, in whom there is a reciprocal Con-\njunction from Intimates [inmofl: Parts] to Ultimates.\nHence may be feen the Reafons, why the Lord pre-\nferveth thofe two Faculties in Man inviolable, and\nas it were facred, in every Progreffion of his Divine\nProvidence.\n97\u00b7 VIII. That therefore it is of the Di\u00b7vine Prov-\nidetzce, that Man jhl;uld ac? from Liberty according to\n_ Reafon. To act from a free Principle according to\nReafon, and to au from Liberty and Rationality, is\nthe fame Thing, as alfo to att from the Will and\nthe Underfb.nding; but it is one Thing to aCl from\na free Principle according to Reafon, or from Lib-\nerty and Rationality, and another to atl: from effen-\ntial Freedom according to efiential Reafon, or from\neffential Liberty and e!fential Rationality ; becaufc\nthe Man who doeth Evii from the Love' of E\u00b7\u2022il.,\nand confirms it in himfelf, the fame aB:cth indeed\nfrom Liberty according to Reafon, but neverthe!efs\nhis Liberty in itfelf is not Liberty, or not effential\nLiberty, but it is infernal Liberty, which in itfdf ~e\nSlavery, and his Reafon in itfelf is not Reafon, but\nit is either J{mrious or falfe Reafon, or Reafoi). only\nappearing fuch from Confirmations : But Hill both\nare of the Divine Providence ; for if the free Power\nof willing Evil, and of making it as it were a Pr1nci-\np1e of Rcafo:ri' by Confirmations, were taken away\nfrom the natur;.ll Man, Liberty and Rationality\nwould p~rifn, and at the fame Time the Will and\nthe U!1dedhnding, and it would not be poffible for\nhim\n\f140 Al\\GEllC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nhim to be withdrav.:n from Erils, and reformed, nor\nconfequentiy to be conjoined to the Lord, and live\nto Etemity : \\Vherefore the Lord guardeth Liberty\nin Aian, as Man guardeth the Apple of his Eye.\nBur flill the Lord by Liberty continually withdraw-\neth 1\\:Jan from Evils, and in Proportion as by Liber-\nty he can withdraw him, in the fame Proportion by\nLiberty he implanteth Goods : thus fucceffively in\nPlace of infernal Liberty he invefl:s him with celef~\ntial Liberty. \u00b7\n98. It was faid above, that every Man hath a Fac.,.\nulty of willing, which is called Liberty, and a Fac-\nulty of underilanding, which is called Rationality ;\nit is, however, well to be attended to, that thefe Fac-\nulties are as it were inherent in Man, for the effen-\ntial Human Principle refides in them : But, as was\nobferved above, it is one Thing to aEl: from Liberty\naccording to Reafon, and another to acr from effen-\ntial Liberty according to effential Reafon: No oth-\ners aCl: \u00b7from cffential Liberty according to effential\nRcafon, but they who have fuffered themfelves to\nbe regenerated by the Lord ; the refl: aCt from Lib-\nerty according to their Thought, which they make\nlike unto Reafon. Nevcrthelefs, every Man, unlefs\nhe be born an Idiot, or extremely fl:upid, may attain\nto effential Reafon, and thereby to cifential Liberty ~\nthe Caufes why he doth not attain thereto are fever-\na!, as will be fhewn in \\vhat follows : We fhall here\nonly point out to whom effential Freedom, or eifen-\ntial Liberty, and at the fame Time effential Reafon,\nor eifential Rationality, cannot be given, and to\nwhom they are given with Difficulty. Eifential\nLiberty and eifcntial Rationality pnnot be given to\nthofe\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I4I\nthofe who are born Idiots ; nor to thofe who after-\n\\.Yards become Idiots, fo long as they remain fuch.\nEffential Liberty and effential Rationality cannot be\ngiven to fuch as are born fiupid and filly, nor to\nfome who become fuch from the Torpor of ldle-\nnefs, or from Sicknefs, which perverterh or entirely\ndofeth the Interiors of the Mind, or from the Love\nof a beafl:ly Life. Neither can effenti~l Liberty and\neifential Rationality be given to thofe in the Chrif-\ntian \\Vorld, \\vho altogether deny the Lord's Divin-\nity, and the SanB:ity of the Word, and have kept\nthis Negation confirmed in themfelves to the End of\nLife ; for this is underfrood by the Sin againfl: the\nHoly Ghofl:, which is not forgiven in this \\Vorld,\nnor in that which is to come, Matth. xii. 3r, 32.\nNeither can effential Liberty and effential Rational-\nity be given in thofe, who attribute all Things to\nNature, and Nothing to the Divine Principle, and\nhave made this a Part of their Faith by Reafonings\nfrom vifible ObjeB:s ; for all fuch are Atheifts. Ef.\nfential Liberty and effential Rationality are giYen\nwith Difficulty in thofe who have confirmed them-\nfeh\u00b7cs much in Falfes of Religion ; becaufe the Con-\n.firmer of what is Falfe is the Denier of Truth : But\nthey who have not fo confirmed thcmfelves, may at-\ntain to true Liberty and Rationality, of whatfoever\nReligion they may be ; on which SubjeCt fee what\nis adduced in THE DocTRINE oF THE NEw fERu-\nSALEM co~CERNING THE SAcRED ScRIPTURE,\nn. 91 to 97\u00b7 . Infants and Children cannot come\ninto effential Liberty and eifential Rationality, be-\nfore they grow up ( tetafe adolefcunt ;) becaufe the\nJnteriors of the Mind in Man are fucceilively open-\ned;\n\f142 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\ned ; in the mean Time they are like Seeds irr unripe\nFruit, which cannot germinate in the Ground.\n99\u00b7 It was faid, that eifential Liberty and eifential\nRationality cannot be given in thofe who have de-\nnied the Lord's Divinity, and the SanD:ity of the\nWord ; neither in thofe who have confirmed them-\nfelves for Nature againfl: the Divine Principle; and.\nhardly in thofe who have much confirmed them- -\nfelves in Falfes of Religion : But fl:ill, thefe have\nnot loft thofe Faculties themfelves : I have heard\nAtheifl:s, who were become Devils and Satans, who\nunderfl:ood Arcana of Wifdom as well as Angels,\nyet only- v\u2022hen they heard them from others ; but\nwhen they returned into their own Thoughts, ~hey\ndid not underfl:and them ; the Reafon was, becaufe\nthey would not ; but it was !hewn them, that they\nalfo c~uld will to underfl:and them, if the Love\nand confequent Delight of E,vil did not prevent\nthem ; this alfo they underfrood, when they heard\nit, yea they affirmed that they could, and were able,\nbut that they did not will to be able;-'oecaufe thereby\nthey would not b~able to will what they did will,\nwhich was Evil from the Delight of the Concupi-\nfcence thereof : Such wonderful Things in the fpi-\nritual \\Vorld have I often heard ; from which I \u00b7was\nfully confirmed, that every Man hath Liberty and\nRationality ; and that every- one may' come into\neifential Liberty and dfential Rationality, if he !hun-\nneth Evils as Sins. But the Adult, who doth not\ncome into eifcntial Liberty and eifential Rationality\nin the World, can never come into them after\nDeath, for then the State of his Life remaineth to\nEternity, fuch as it had b~c:n in the \\\\\"orld.\nTbat\n\fTHE DIVIHE PROVIDENCE. 143\nTlzat it is a Law of the Divine PTovi-\ndence, thq.,t Man as front hinife!fJlwuld\nre;npve Evils as Sins in tlze external\nJVIan, and that thus and no otherwije\nthe Lord can nmove Evils in tlze inter-\nnal l\\1an, and then at the fame Time\nin the external.\n100. EVERY one may fee from Reafon alone,\nthat the Lord, who is Good itfelf and\nTruth itfelf, cannot enter into Man, unlefs Evils\nand Falfes in him are removed, for Evil is oppofite\nto Good, and what is Falfe is oppofite to what is\nTrue ; and two Oppofites n~ver can be mixed, but\nwhen one approacheth the other, a Combat enfues,\nwhich continueth until one giveth Place to the oth-\ner, and that which giveth Place departeth, and the\nother fucceedeth. In fuch Oppofition are HeaYen\nand Hell, or the Lord and the Devil : Can any one\nthink from Reafon, that the Lord can enter where\nthe Devil reigneth ; or that Heaven can be where\nHell is ? \u00b7who doth not fee, by' Virtue of the Ra-\ntionality given to every Man of found Mind, that,\nin Order that the Lord may enter, the Devil is to be\ncaft out, or that Heaven may enter, Hell is to be\nremoved ? This Oppofition is meant by the Words\nof Abraham out of Heaven to the rich Man in Hell,\n\" Between us and you there is a great Gulph fixed,\nthat they which would pajsfrom h.\"nce to you, cannot;\nneither can tbcy pafs to us, that 1..c:ould come from\nthence,\"\n\f144 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nthence,\" Luke xvi. 26. Evil itfelf is Hell, and\nGood itfelf is Heaven, or v.rhat i11 the fame, Evil it~\nfelf is the Devil, and Good itfelf is the Lord, and a\nlYian, in whom Evil reigneth, is a Hell in its leafi:\nForm, and a Man in whom Good reigneth, is a\nHeaven in its leaft Form : This being the Cafe~\nhow can Heaven enter into Hell, when between\nthem fo great a Gulph is fixed, that there is no\npalling from the one to the other ? Hence it fol-\nlows, that Hell is entirely to be removed, that\nthe Lord may be able to enter with Heaven.\nIOI. But many, efpecially they who have cone\nfirmed themfelves in Faith fcparate from Charity, d\u00b7o\nnot know that they are in Hell, when they are in\nEvils, and do not indeed k.now what Evils are, by\nReafon that they think Nothing of them ; faying,\nthat they are not under the Yoke of the Law, and\ntherefore that the Law doth not condemn them ; al-\nfo, that whereas they cannot contribute any Thing to\ntheir o~n Salvation, they cannot remove any Evil\nfrom themfelves; and moreover, that they cannot\ndo any Good from themfelves: Thefe are they, who\nvmit to think of Evil, and becaufe they omit to\nthink of it, they are continually in it. That thefe\nare they who are me:mt by the Goats fpoken of in\nMatthew, may be feen in the DocTRINE OF THE\nNEw }ERUSALEM coNCERNING FAITH, n. 6r to\n68, of whom it is faid, Verfe 41 of Chap. xxv.\n\" Depart from Jo.![~, ye curftd, into cverlqfling Fire\npreparedfor the Devil and his Angels.11\nFor they\nwho think Nothing of Evils in themfelves, that is,\nwho do not explore themfelves, and afterwards de-\nfill: from them) cannot but be ignorant what Evil is,\nand\n\fTHE DiVINE PROVIDENCE. LH\nand then love it from the Delight thereof; for he\nwho doth not know what is Evil, the fame loveth it,\nand he who ornitteth to think of it, the fame is con\u2022\ntinually in it, being like a blind Man who doth not\nfee ; for the Thought feeth Good and Evil, as the\nEye feeth what is beautiful anJ unbeautiful; and\nhe is in Evil, as well who thinketh and '\\Villeth it,\nus he who beiieverh Evil doth not appear before\nGod, and that it is forgiven if it app~areth, for thus\nhe thinketh that he is without Evil: lffuch Perfons\nabfiain from doing Evils, they do not abflain becaufe\nthey are Sins againfi God, but becaufc they are afraid\nbf the Laws ami of their Reputation ; neverthelefs\nthey do Evils in their Spirit, for it is the Spirit of Man\nwhich thinketh and willeth, \\vherefore that which a\nMan thinketh in his Spirit in the \\Vorld, the fame\nhe doeth after his Departure out of the INorld,\nwhen he becomes a Spirit. In the fpiritual \\Vodd,\ninto which every Man cometh after Death, it is not\nafked what has your .Faith been, nor what your Doc.\ntrine, but what hath your Life been ; thus the In-\nquiry is concerning the Nature and ~ality of the\nLife; for it is known that fuch as-any one's Life is,\nfuch is his Faith, yea \u00b7ruch his DoCtrine ; inafmuch\n01s the Life formeth to itfelf Dofrrine, and formeth\nto itfelf Faith. I'\n102. From what hath jufi been faid it may appear,\nthat it is a Law of the Divine Providence, that\nEvils be removed by Man, for without the Removal\nof them the Lord cannot be conjoined to Man, anJ\nle'ad him from Self into Heaven. But forafrnuch as\nit is not known, that Man ought as from himfdf to\nremove Evils in the external Man, and that unlds\nT ~\\hn\n\f146 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nMan doeth this as from himfelf, the Lord canno~\nremove Evils in him in the internal Man, therefore\nwe fhall proceed to exhibit this to the View of Rea.\nfan in its Light, in the following Order. I. Thaa\nevery Man hath an External and an Internal Prin-\nciple of Thought. II. That the Externai Principle\nof the Thought of l\\'lan is in itfelf fuch as its Inter-\nnal is. III. That the Internal Principle cannot be\npurified fi:om the Concupifcences of Evil, fo long\nas E\\\u2022ils in the Extemal Man are not removed, be-\ncaufe they obfirua. IV. That Evils in the Exter-\nnal Man cannot be removed by the Lord, but by\nMeans of Man. V. That therefore Man ought to\nremove Evils from the External Man as from him.\nfelf. VI. That the Lord then purifieth Man from\nthe Concupifcences of Evil in the Internal Man, and\nfrom the Evils thenifelves in the External. VII.\nThat it is the Continuum E\ncontinual Endeavour] of\nthe Divine Providence of the I.ord, to join Man to\nljimfelf, and Himfelf to Man, that he may be able\nto give him the Felicities of eternal Life ; which\ncannot be done, but in Proportion as Evils with\ntheir CoDcupifcences are removed..\n103. I. That e-very Man hath an external and an\nintcmal PriJzcip!e of'Thought. By the external and\ninternal Principle of Thought is here underfiood\nthe fame as by th~ external and internal Man, which\nmeans Nothing elfe but the External and the Inter-\nnal of the \\Viii and Underllanding, for the Will\nand Underfi.anding make the l\\1an; and forafmuch\nas thefe two manifefl themfelvcs in the Thoughts,\n..it is called the external and internal Principle of\nThought i now whereas it is not the Body of Man~\nbut\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 147\nbut his Spirit whi~h willerh and underfl:andeth, and\nthence thinketh, it follows, that this external and\ninternal Principle is the External and Internal of\nthe Spirit of Man. Bodily AB:ion, whether exerted\nin Speech or in Work, is only an EffeCt from the\nInternal and External of Man's Spirit, for the Body\nis only Obedience.\nI 04. That every 1\\'Ian in an advanced Age hath\nan external and an internal Principle of Thought,\ntherefore an external and an internal Principle of\n\\Vill and Undedl:anding, or an External and an\nInternal of the Spirit, which is the fame with the\nexternal and internal Man, is evident to every one,\nwho attends to the Thoughts and Intentions of\n\u00b7 another from his Speech or AClions ; and alfo to\nhis own Thoughts and Intentions, when he is i11\nCompany, and when he is not; for any one may\nfpeak in a friendly manner with another in external\nThought, and yet be his Enemy in internal Thought;\nany one may fpeak of Love towards his Neighbour,\nand of Love towards God, from external Thought\nand at the fame Time from its AffeB:ion, when nev-\nerthelefs in his internal Thought he maketh light\nof his Neighbour, and doth not fear Gad: Any one\nmay alfo fpeak of the Juftice of civil Laws, of the\nVirtues of moral Life, and of the Things which r~\u00ad\nlate to fpiritual DoClrine and Life, from external\nThought and AffeCI:ion, and yet, when he is alone\nby himfelf, from internal Thought and its Afl\"eB:ion,\nfpeak againft civil Laws, againft moral Virtues, and\nagainfl: the Things which relate to fpiritual DoB:rine\nand Life ; this is the Cafe with fuch as are in the\nConcupifcences of Evil, and frill wifh to appear be-\nfore\n\f-148 Az-:oruc;: \\VIsDm.t coN CEP,NING\nfore the \\Vorld not to be in them. Mofl: People\nalfo, whilfl: they hear others fpeaking, think \\Vith\nthemfelves, do they think interiorly in themfelves1\nas they \u20acxprefs their Thoughts in their Speech ?\nAre they to be believed, or not f What is it they\nintend ? That Flatterers and Hypocrites haYe a\ndouble Thought, is kno\\vn ; for they can contain\nthemfelves, and take Care that ~heir interior Thought\nfnall not be opened, and indeed can conceal it more\nand more interiorly, and as it were flmt up th~\nDoor left it fhould appear, That exterior Thought\nand interior Thobght is given to Man, is evidently\nmanifefl: from this Confideration, that he can from\nhis interior Thought fee his exterior Thought, and\nalfo refleCl: upon it, and judge of it, whether it b~ \u00b7\n~vil or not evil : This ~ality of his Mind Man de-\ntiveth from the two Faculties, which he hath from\nthe Lord, called Liberty and Rationality ; from\nwhich if he had not an external and a,n internal\nPrinciple of Thought, he could not perceive ancl\nfee any Evil in himfelf, and be reformed ; ye<l\nneither could he fpeak, but only utter S~mnds like\n~ Beafi.\nIOS\u00b7 The internal Principle of Thought is from\nthe Life's Love and its Affections and confequent\nPerceptions ; the external Principle of Thought is\nfrom the Things which are in the Memory, and\nwhich are fubfervient to the Life's Love for Cono\nfirmations, and for Means to attain its End. Man,\nfrom Infancy to Youth, is in the external Principle\nof Thought derived from the AffeCl:ion of knowing,\nwhich then makcth his internal Principle ; there\n'tranfpircth alfo Sc~nething of Conctlpifce.nce anc!\nthence\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENc-E. 149\nthence of Inclination derived from the Life's Love\nconnate from his Parents : But afterwards, as he\nliveth, his Life's Love is formed, whofe AfFeetions\n;md confequent Perceptions make the internal Prin.\nciple of his Thought, and from the Life's :f:ove is\nproduced the Love of Means, whofe Delights, and\nthe Sciences excited thence from the Memory, make\nthe external Principle of his Thought.\nI o6. II. That the external Principle ifthe 'lbought\nof Man is in iife!ffuch as its Internal is. That Man\nfrom Head to Foot is fuch as his Life's Love is, was\nfhewn above : Here therefore it may be expedient to\npremife Something concerning the Life's Love, be-\nfore we proceed to fpeak of the AfFections, which,\n; together .with Perceptions, make the internal of\nMan, and of the Delights of the Affections, togeth~\ner with the Thoughts, which make his ExternaL\nLoves are manifold, but there are two Loves like\nLords and Kings, celefiial Love and infernal Love ;\nceleftial Love is Love to the Lord and neighbour-\nJy Love, and infernal Love is the LoYe of Self and\nof the \\Vorld ; thefe Loves are oppofite to each oth-\ner, as Heaven and Hell; for he who is in the Love\nof Self and of the World, willeth not Good to any\none but himfelf, but he who is in Love to the Lord\nand in Love towards his Neighbour, the fame will~\n~th Good to all. Thefe two Loves are the Life's\nLoves of Man, but with much Variety ; celefl:ial\nI...ove is the Life's Love of tnofe whom the Lord.,\nleadeth, and infernal LoYe is the Life's Love of\nthofe whom the Devil leadeth. But the Life's\nLove of any one cannot exift without Derivations,\nwhich are called Affeetions ; the Derivations of in~\nfernal\n\f150 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nfernal Love are AffeCl:ions of Evil and of what is\nFalfe, properly called Concupifcences ; and the\nDerivations of celefiial Love are AffeCl:ions of Good\nand Truth, properly called Dileaions. The Affec-\ntions qf infernal Love, which properly are Concupi-\nfcences, are as many as there are Evils, and the Af-\nfeCl:ions of celeftial I~ove, which properly are Dilec-\ntions, are as many as there are Goods. The Love\ndwelleth in its i\\ffed:ions, like a Lord in his Domain,\nor like a King in his Kingdom : Irs Dominion and\nKingdom is over the Things which appertain to the\nMind, that is, which appertain to the Will and the\nUnderilanding of Man, and thence to his Body.\nThe Life's Love of Man, by its AffeCl:ions and the\nPerceptions thence derived, and by its Delights and\nthe Thoughts thence derived, governeth the whole\nMan, th~ Internal of h_is Mind by its AffeCl:ions and\nthe Perceptions thence derived, .and the External\nof his Mind by the Delights of its AffeCl:ions and\nthe Thoughts thence derived.\n107. The Form of this Government may in\nfame Meafure be feen by Comparifons : Cele!lial\nLove, with the AffeCl:ions of Good and Truth, and\nthe Perceptions thence derived, and at the fame\nTime with the Delights of thefe AffeCl:ions and the\nThoughts thence derived, may be compared to a\nTree with beautiful Branches, Leaves, and Fruits ; .\nthe Life's Love is that Tree, the Branches with the\nLeaves are the AffeCl:ions of Good and Truth with\ntheir Perceptions, and the Fruits are the Delights\nof the AffeCl:ions \\vith their Thoughts. But infer-\nnal Love, with its AffeCl:ions of Evil and of what is\nFalfe, which arc Concupifcences) and at the fame\nTime\n\fTHE DIVlNE PRoVIDENcE. \u00b7r 5I\nTime with the Delights of thefe Concupifcences\nand the Thoughts thence deriveJ, may be compared\nto a Spider and the \\Veb which encompaffeth it ;\nthe Love itfelf is the Spider, the Concupifcences of\nEvil and what is Falfe are the retiform Threads\nnearefl: to the Seat of the Spider ; anJ the Delights\nof thefe Concupifcence~ with deceitful Machinations\nare the more remote Threads, where Flies are\ncaught, entangled, and devoured.\n1 oS. From thefe Comparifons may indeed be\nfeen the Conjunaion of all Things of the Will and\nUnderfl:anding, or of the Mind of Man, with his\nLife's Love, but yet not rationally : This Conjunc-\ntion may be feen rationally thus : There are every\nwhere three Things together \u00b7which make one,\nwhich are called End, Caufe, and EffeCl:; the Life's\nLove in Man is the End, the AffeCl:ions with their\nPerceptions are the Caufe, and the Delights of the\nAffeCl:ions with their Thoughts are the EffeCl: ; for\nin like Manqer as the End by the Caufe cometh into\nEffea, fo alfo Love by its AffeCl:ions cometh to its\nDelights, and by its Perceptions to its Thoughts :\nEffeCl:s themfelves are in the Delights of the Mind\nand their Thoughts, when the Delights are of the\n\\Vi!l and the Thoughts are of the Underftanding\nthence derived, confequently when there is a full\nConfent therein ; EffeB:s are in this Cafe EffeCl:s of\nhis Spirit, which, although they do not come into\nbodily ACl:ion, are fl:ill as it were in ACt, when there\nis Confent; they are alfo then together in the Body,\nand dwell there with his Life's Love, and breathe\nafter ACl:ion, which is produced when Nothing hin.\ndereth : Such are the Concupifccnces of Evil, and\nEvils\n\f152 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\nEvils themfelves, in thofe, who make Evils allo'<\\'a\"'\nble in their Spirit. Now as the End joineth itfelf\n'0\\\u00b7ith the Caufe, and by the Caufe with the Effefr;\nfo the Life's Love joineth itfelf with the internal\nPrinciple of Thought, and by that with its external ~\nhence it is el'ident, that the external Principle of the\nThought of Man in itfelf is fuch as its int~rnal isj\nfor rhe End infufeth all it hath into the Caufe; and\nthrough the Caufe into the EffeCt, there being\nNothing effential in the EffeCt, but what is in the\nCaufe, and through the ' Caufe in the End ; and\nforafmuch as the End is thus the very effential Prin~\u00b7\nciple which entereth the Caufe and the EffeCt, there\u2022\nfore the Caufe and EffeCt are called the middle End\nand the ultimate End.\n109. It appears fometimes as if the external i'riri\u2022\nciple of the Thought of Man was not in itfelf fuch\nas its internal is ; but this cometh to pafs, becaufe\nthe Life's Love, with its Internals about it, placeth\na Subfl:itute below itfelf, which is called the Love of\nl\\leans, and enjoineth it to take Heed and guard left\nany Thing of its Concupifcences fhould appear ;-\nwherefore that Subfl:itute (or Deputy) from the\nCraftinefs of its Prince, which is the Ufe's Love,.\nfpeaketh and aCteth according to the civil Infiitu-\ntions of the Kingdom, according to the Morals of\nReafon, and according to the Spirituals of\u2022the\nChurch, and indeed fo cunningly and ingeniouf-\nly, that no one feeth but they are fuch as they\nfpeak and aCt:, and at length, by encompaffing them~\nfelves with a Veil, they fcarcely know any otherwif..~\nthemfdves : Such are all Hypocrites ; and fuch are\nPriefl:s, \\vho in their Hearts make light of rhcir\nNeighbour,\n\fTHE DIVINE P~OVIDJ!KCE.\nNeighbour, and do not fear God, and yet preach cf\nthe Love of their Neighbour and the Love of God:\nSuch are Judges, who jtidge under the Influence of\nBribes and Friend\/hips, when they pretend a Zeal for.\njuflice, and fpcak from Reaion of Judgment: Such\n~.re Merchants, infincere and fraudulent at Heart,\nwhen they aft fii1cerely for the Sake of IntereJl: :\n.!1.nd fuch are Adulterers, 'ivhen, from that Ration-\nality which every Man is poifeffed of, they fpeak ot~\nthe Chaftity of Marriage ; and fo in other Inflances.\nBut thefe fame l'erfons, if they !hip the Love of\nMeans, the Subfl:itutc of their Life's Love, of the\nGarments of Purple and firte Linen, with which\nthey had inve!l:ed it, and clothe it in its domefl:ic\nDrefs, theri they think, aild fometimes fpeak with\ntheir niofl: intimate Friends, who are in a fimilar\nLife's Love, direB:Iy the contrary. It may be\nthought, that when they, from the Love of :Means,\nhave fpoken fo jufl:ly, finccrely, and pioufly, then\nthe Q:1ality of their internal Thought was not in\nthe External of their Thought, but fiill it was there.\nin, there being Hypocrify and the Love of Self and\u00b7\nof the \\Vorld in thofe, whofe Cunning it is to feek\nReputation for the Sake of Honour or Intere!l: t(\u2022\nthe lafl: Appearance : This ~ality of the internal\nis in the external Principle of their Thought, whe.n\nthey fo fpeak and aB:.\n1 ro. But in thofe who are in celeflial Lo\\\u00b7e, the\ninternal and external Principle of Thought, or the\ninternal and external Man, atl as one, when th~y\nfpeak, nor do they know any Difference ; their\nLife's Love, with its AffeCtions of Good and the:r\nPerceptions of Truth, is like the Soul in whatever\nU they\n\f'\n154 ANGELIC 'VISDOM CONCERNING\nthey think, anJ thence fpeak and do ; if they are\nPridl:s, they preach from Love towards their Neigh-\n~our and th~ Love of God ; if they are Judges,\nthey judge from Juftice itfelf; if they are Mer-\nchants, they ~a from Sincerity itfelf ; if they are\nmarried Men, they love their \\Vives from Cha!lity\nirfelf, and fo on. Their Life's Love alfo hath a\nLove of Means, as a Subfl:itute, which it teacheth\nand leadeth to aEt from Prudence, and clothes it\nin Garments of Zeal for the Truths of Doarine,\nand at the fame Time for the Goods of Life.\n1 1 I. III. That the internal P rincip!e cannot be pu:\nr!fied from t.~c Concupifcenccs ofEvil, fo long as Evib\nin the extem.1l A1an arc not remo'l\u2022ed, becmffe tbey ob~\nfiru{f, follO\\vS from what was faid above, that the\nexternal Principle of the Thought of Man is fuch.\nin itfelf as the Internal of his Thought is, and that\nthey adhere together like that which is not only\nwithin another, but is alfo from the other, where~\nfore one of them cannot be feparated, unlefs the\nother be feparated at the fame Time ; fo it i'l \u00b7with\nevery external Principle which is from an internal,\nand with every pofterior which is from a prior, and\nwith every Effect \u00b7which is from a Caufe. Now f~r..\nafmuch as Concupifcences, together with Crafti\u00b7\nnefs, make the internal Principle of Thought in the\n\"'Wicked, and the Delights of Concupifcences to\u00b7.\ngether with l\\lachinations make the external Prin-\nciple of Thought in them, and the latter are joined\n\\Vith the former in one, it follows, that the internal\nPrinciple cannot be purified from Concupifcences,\nfo long as EYils in the external Man are not remov-\ned. It is to be noted, that it is the internal l.iVill of\nMan\n\fTnE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. ISS\nMan which is in .Concupifcences, and that it is his\ninternal Underflanding which is in Craftinefs, and\nthat it is his external Will which is in the Delights\nof Concupifcences, and his external Undcrfl:anding\nwhich is in Mad)inations from Craftinefs: Every\none may fee that Concupifcences and their Delights\nmake one, alfo that Craftincfs and Machinations\nmake one, and that thefe four are in one Series,\nand make together as it were one Bundle ; from\nwhich Confideration it is again evident, that the in-\nternal Principle, which confifleth of Concupifcen.\nccs, cannot be cafl: out but by the Removal of the\nexternal, which confifleth of Evils. Concupifcen-\nces by their Delights produce Evils, but when Evil~\nare thought allowable, which is done by Confent of\nthe \\Viii 2nd U nderfbnding, then the Delights and\nEvil~ make one ; that Confent is an ACt, is well\nknown; which is alio what the Lord faith, \"Ifanv\none looketh it a Woman, to h:\/l oftcr her, be hatb al-\nready committed Adultery 'u.:ith bcr in his Heart,\"\nIvlatth. v. z8 : It is the fame \u00b7with other Evils.\n1 I 2. Hence then it may appear, that in Order\nto Man's being purified from the Concupiken<;es of\nEvil, Evils are entirely to be removed from the ex-\nternal Man, for until this is done, there is no Exit\ngiven to Concupilcences, and if an Exit (or Egrefs)\nis not given them, Concupifcences remain within~\nand breathe forth Delights from themfelves, and fo\ndrive Man to Confent, confequently to Action :\nConvupifcences enter the Body by the External of\nThought, wherefore when there is Confent in the\nExternal of Thought,\u00b7 they are immediately in the\nBody, the Delight which is felt being there: That\nfuch\n\f156 ANGELIC \\VrsnoM coi\\CERNING\nfuch as the Mind is, fuch is the Body, confequently\n' the whole l\\Jan, may be feen in the Treatife concern.\ning THE DrvrNE LovE AND THE DIVINE \\VrsnoMt\nn. 36:2 to 370. This may be illuftrated by Com-\nparifons, and alfo by Examples : By Comparifonr\nthus ; Concupifc~nc~s with their Delights may b~\ncompared to Fire, which the more it is kindled, the\nmore !t burneth ; and the freer Extdnfion it hath,\nthe wider it fpreadeth itfelf, until in a City it con-\nfmneth its Houfes, and ip a Wood its Trees ; the\nConcupifcences of Evil ~lfo in the '\\:Vord are com-\npared to Fire, and Evils proceeding from them to a\nConflagration ; the Concupifcences of Evil with\ntheir Delights in th~ fpiritual \\Vorld appear alfo as\nFires ; infern4l Fire is Nothing elfe. They may\nalfo be compared to Deluges\u00b7 and Inundations of\nvVater~, when Mounds or Dykes are removed.\nThey may a!fo be compared to Gangrenes and\nlm'pofrhumes, which bring pearh upon the Body, a:o\nthey fpread, or as thn <J.re not cured. By Exampkf\nit is clearly evident, that if Evils in the external\nMan are not removed, Concupifcences with the~r\nDelights increafe and become exuberant : A Thief,\nin Proportion as he fiealeth, in the fame Proportion\nhath the Concupifcence of fiealing, till at length he\ncannot defifl: :\u00b7 The fame is true of a fraudulent\nPerfon, in Proportion as he defraudeth : 1t is the\nfame alfo \u2022vith Hatred and Revenge, with Luxury\nand Intemperance, with Adultery and Bla~Dhemy ;\nthat the Love of Dominion Grounded in the LoYc\nof Self increafeth in Proportion as it is given \\Yay\nto, is well known ; in like Manner the Love of\npoifeffing Goods grounded in the Love of the\n\u00b7 '\\.Yorld t\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 157\n\\Vorld ; it appears as if there was no Bound or\nEnd to them. From thefe Confiderations it is evi-\npent, that in Proportion as Evils in the external\nMan are not removed, in the fame Proportion the\nConcupifcences thereof abound ; alfo in fuch De-\ngree as Evils are given Vfay to, in the fame Degree\n'Concupifcences increafe.\nI 1 3\u00b7 Man cannot perceive the Concupifcences of\nhis o\\\\m Evil ; he perceiveth the Delights \u00b7of them.\nindeed, but he refleC\\:s little\u00b7upon them, for Delights\noccupy the Thoughts, and take away Refleaions ;\nwherefore if he did not from fame other Source\nknow that they are Evils, he would call them\nGoods, and would perpetrate them from Liberty\n2ccording to the Reafon of his Thought ; anJ\n2nd when he doeth this, he appropriates them to\npimfelf: In Proportion as he confirmeth them a:;\nallowable, in the fame Proportion he enlargeth the\nCourt of his reigning Love, which is his Life'~\nLove ; its Court is compofed of Concu])ifcences,\nfor they are as it were its l\\liniflers and Guards,\nwhereby it govemeth the Exteriors which conili-\ntute its Kingdm~ ; but fuch as the King is, fuch\nme his Minifiers and Guards, and fuch is his King-\ndom ; if the King is a Devil, then his Minifl:ers anJ\nGuards are lnfanities, and the People of his King-\ndom are Fdfes of all Kinds, which his Mini!ters,\nwhom they call wife, although they arc i!lfane, by\nReafonings from Fallacies and by Phantafies make\nto appear as Truths, and to be acknowl~dged as\nTruths. Can fuch a State of Man be changed\notherwife than by removing Evils in the external\n~hn> for fo the Concupifcences alfo wh!(;h ;~dtere\n'\\ to\n\fl58 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nto Evils are removed ; otherwife no Egrefs is af.\nforded to Concupifcences, for they are !hut in, like\na befieged City, or an Ulcer fkinned m\u00b7er.. .. \u00b7\nI 14. IV. That Evils in the external Mcm cannot\nbe removed by the Lord but by Means of l'vJan. \u2022 In\nall Chri!lian Churches this Doctrine is received,\nthat l\\1an, before he approacheth the holy Commu-\nnion, is to examine himfelf, to fee and acknowledge\nhis Sins, and to repent, b(defifring from them, and\nrejecting them becaufe they are from the Devil ;\nand that otherwife his Sins are not forgiven, and\nthat he is condemned : The Englifh, although they\nare in the Doctrine of Faith alone, neverthelefs in\nthe Prayer at the holy Communion, openly teach\nSelf-examination, the Acknowledgment and Con..\nfeffion of Sins~ Repentance, and a new Life, and\nthreaten thofe, who do not comply, in thefe \\Vords,\nthat otherwife the Devil will enter into them as he did\ninto Judas, andfill tbem <z.cith all Iniquity, and deflroy\nthem\u00b7 Body and Soul. The Germans, Swedes, and\nDanes, who are alfo in the DoQ:rine of Faith alone,\nin the Prayer at the holy Communion teach the\nfame, threatening alfo, that otherwife they will incur\ninfernal Punifhment, and eternal Damnation, \u00b7Ly\nReafon of the 1\\Jixture of what is facred and pro-\nfane : Thefe Things arc read by the Prieft with a\nlouu Voice before thofe who are about to receive\nthe Lord's Supper, and are heard by them with\u2022a\nfu11 Acknowledgment that it is fo. Neverthelefs\nthe fame Pt:rfons, when they hear a Sermon the\nfame Day on Faith alone, and then that the Law\ndoth not condemn them, becaufe the Lord had ful-\nfilled it for them, and that from themfelves they\ncannet\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 159\ncannot do any Good but v;\u00b7hat is meritorious, and\nthus that \\Vorks han~ Nothing of Salvation in\nth~m, but Faith only, they return Home entirely\nforgetful of their former Confdlion, and rejeain~\nit, in Proportion ;tS they think of the St.:rmon on\nFaith alone. \\Vhich Doctrine now is true, the lat.\nter or the former ? (for two 'fhin;;s contrary t(j\neach other cannot both be true) that without an\nExamin:1tion, Knowledge, Acknowledgment, Con.\nfeffion and Rejection of Sins, therefore without Re-\npentance, there is no Remiffion thereof, confequent\u00b7\nly no Scllvation but eternal Damnation ? or that\nfuch Things contribute Nothing to Salvation, be\u00b7\ncaufe full Satisfaction for all the Sins of l\\len was\nmade by the Lord through the Paffion of the Crofs\n, for thofc who are in Faith, and that they who are\nin Faith on!y with a Confidence that it is fo, and in\nConfidence of the Imputation of the Lord's Merit,\nare without Sins, and that they appear before the\nLord like thofe who have their Faces clean waf1ied ?\nFrbm the aboYe it is evident, that the common Re.\nligion of all the Churches in the Chrifi:ian World is,\nthat Man ought to examine himfelf,. to fee and ac-\nknowledge his Sins, and afterwards to defifi: from\nthem, and that otherwife there is no Salvation, but\nCondemnation. That this is moreover Divine\nTruth itfdf, is evident from thofe Palfages in the\n\\Vord, where Man is commanded to repent, as\nfrom thefe, \" Jefus faid, Bring forth Fruits worthy of\nREPENTANcr, 1zo.-:.v a!fo the Axe is laid untr; the Root\noftbe Trees ; e'very Tree therefore which bringeth not\nforth good Fruit Jba!l be he~c.m down and cqfl into tbe\nFire,\" Luke iii. 8, 9\u00b7 \" Jefus faid, Except yc Rli\u00b7\n}'!..NT,\n\f160 ANC.ELIC \\VrSDOM CONCERNING\nPENT, yejlJa!l all perifb,\" Luke xiii. 3, 5\u00b7 \" Jifui\n, preached the Gofpel ofthe Kingdom of God; R:EPENT\nye, and believe tbc Gofpel,\" Mark i. 14, 15. \"Jcfus\n.fmt forth bis Dijciplcs, who \u00b7went out and preacbed\nt!.,at A1cn Jbould REPENT,\" Mark vi.

God forbid; yea we cjlablijh the\nLaw,\" Verfe 31, of the fame Chapter. They, who\nfrom \u00b7\n\u2022\n\fTHE DIVINE PRO\\'IDENCE. I6I\nfrom the above Saying have confirmed thcmfclvcs\nin Faith feparate from Charity, by looking at thit\nPalfage as at the Sun, do \u00b7not fee \\I'here Paui enu-\nmerates the Laws of Faith, that they are the very\n'Vorks of Charity ; what then is Faith without its\nLaws ? Neither do they fee where he enumerate:;\nevil \\Vorks, faying, that they who do them, cannot \u00b7\nenter into Hec:.ven. Fro1:1 which it is evident, what\nlllindnefs is induced from this one Paffage mifun~\nderftood.\nI 16. The Ground and lleafori why Evils in the\nexternal Man cannot be removed but by 1\\leans of\nMan, is, becaufe it is of the Divine Providence, that\nwhatfoever a Man heareth, feeth, thinketh, willeth,\nfpeaketh, and deeth, fhould appear altogether as his\nown ; that without this Appearance l\\1an would\nhave no Reception of Divine Truth, no Detennina-\ntion to do Good, no. Appropriation of Love and\n\"\\Vifdom, alfo of Charity and Faith, and th~nce uo\nConjunCI:ion with the Lord, coniequently no Rdor~\nh1ation and Rege71eration, and thereby S;1lv:J.tion, is\nfuewn above, n. 71 to 95, and the following: That\nwithout this Appearance, Repentance from Sins is\nnot 'poffible, yea nor Faith, is evident ; alfo that\n1\\lan, without that Appearance, is not Man, but\nvoid of rational Life, like a Beafl:. Let him, \\Vho is\nfo difpofed, confult his own Reafon concerning this\nQ_udhon, Doth it not appear that :Man thiuketh\nfrom himfelf of Good and Truth, as well fpiritual\nas moral and civil ? Let him then receive this Doc-\ntrinal, that all Good and Truth is from the' Lord,\nand Nothing from Man: \\Vill he not acknowledge\nthis Confequence, that Man oug!1t to do Good. and\nI.V think\n' .\n\f162 ANGELIC \\VrsDO.M CONCERHING\nthink Truth as from himfelf, but fiill to acknowl~\nedge that they are from the Lord ; therefore alfo\nthat Man ought to remove Evils as from himfelf1\nbut fiill to acknowledge that he doeth it from the\nLord.\n117. There are many who do not know that they\nare in Evils, becaufe they do not commit them in\nExternals ; for they are afraid of civil Laws, and\nalfo of the Lofs of Reputation, and thus they ac~\nquire a Cufl:om and Habit of !hunning Evils as det~\nrimental to their Honour and Interefl: : But if they\ndo not !hun Evils from a Principle of Religion, be~\ncaufe they are Sins, and againfl God, then the Con~\ncupifcences of Evil with their Delights remain in\nthem, like impure Waters obfl:rutl:ed or fl:agnated ;\nlet them explore their Thoughts and Intentions,\n-and they will find fuch Concupifcences, provided\nthey know what Sin is. There are many fuch,\nwho have confirmed themfelves in Faith feparate\nfrom Charity, who, beeauf~ they believe that the\nLaw doth not condemn, do not even attencl to Sins,\nand indeed doubt whether there be any fuch Thing,\nand that if there be, they are not fuch in the Sight\nof God, becaufe they arc forgiven. Such alfo are\nnatural Moralifl:s, who think civil and moral Life\nwith its Prudence operates in all Things, and the\nDivine Providence not in any Thing. Such alfo\nare they who fl:udioufly afrea the Reputation and\nName of Honefl:y and Sincerity for the Sake of\nHonour or Interefl:. But they who are fuch, and\nat the fame Time fpurn Religion, after Death be~\ncome Spirits of Concupifcences, who appear to\nthemfelves as if they \\vere real Men, but to others\nat\n\u2022\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 163\nat a Diftance as Priapufes ; and they fee in the\nDark, and not at all in the Light, like Owls.\nx18. From thefe Confiderations now follows the\nConfirmation of Article V, which is, 'That therefore\nMan ought to rmlO'ue Evils from the external Man as\nfrom hinifdf; which may alfo be feen explained in\nthree Articles in THE DocTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE\nNEw jERUSALEM; in one, That no one can !hun\n\"Evils as Sins, fo as interiorly to have an Averfion\nfor them, but by Combats againfl: them, n. 92 to\nIoo. In another, That Man ought to fhun Evils as\nSins, and fight againft them as from himfelf, n. 1o I\nto 107. In the third, That if any one flmnneth\nEYils as Sins from ariy other Caufe, than becaufe\nthey are Sins, he doth not fhun them, but only\nmaketh them not to appear before the \\Vorld, n.\n108 to IIJ.\nI 19. VI. 'That the Lord in this Cafe pur!fi~th Man\nfrom Concupifcences in the internal .A'lan, and from\nEvils then!fdvej in the external. The Reafon why\nthe Lord purifieth Man from .Concupifcences of\nEvil, when Man removeth Evils as from himfelf, is\nbecaufe the Lord cannot purify him until Man do-\neth this ; for there are Evils in the external Man,\nand Concupifcences of Evil in the internal, and\nthey cohere together like the Rocts of a Tree to\ntheir Trunk : Wherefore unlefs the EYils are re-\nmoved, there is no Aperture ; for they obfiruB: and\nfhut the Door, which cannot be opened by the Lord\nbut by Means of Man, as was fhewn abC\\'e : When\nMan fo opens the Door as from himfdf, then the\nLord at the f::.me Time extirpates Cor. ::upifcences.\n\u00b7The Rca.fon dfo is, becaufe the Lord ,_acth upon\nthe\n\f164 ANGELIC \\VrSDOM CONCERNING\nthe lntimum [inmoft Part] of Man, and from the\nIntimum upou. its Confequents to the Ultimates, and\nin the Ultimates the Man is all together; fa long there-\nfore as the Ultimates are kept !hut by the Man him-\nfelf, there cannot any Purification be effeCl:ed by the\nLord, but only fuch :m Operation in Interiors, as the\nLord produceth in Hell, whereof Man is a Form,\nwho is in Concupifcences and at the fame Time in E-\nvils, which Operation is only a Difpofition that one\nm:1y notdefl:.royanother,and thatGoodnefs andTruth\nmay not be violated. That the Lord continually\nurgeth and pre!feth, that Man v\u2022ould open the Door\nto him, is evident from the Lord's Words in the\nRevelation, \"Behold I)land at\u00b7the Door, and knock;\nifany Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will\ncome in to him, and willjup with him, and he with\ni'vfe,\" iii. 2.o.\n120. lVIan knoweth Nothing at all of the interior\nState of his Mind, or his internal Man, neverthelefs\nthere are three Infinite Things, 'vhereof not one\ncometh to his Knowledge ; for the Internal of the\nThought of Man, or his internal Man, is his Spirit\nitfelf, and in it there are as infinite or innumerable\nThings, as there are in a Man's Body, yea frill more\ninnumerable, for the Spirit of Man i:> in its Form a\nMan, and all Things thereof correfpond to all the\nThings of a 1\\Ian in his Body. Now as Man know-\neth Nothing from any Senfation, how his Mind or\nSoul operateth jointly and feverally upon all Things\nof his Body, fo neither doth Man know how the\nLord operateth upon all Things of his Mind or\n~oul, that is, upon all Things of his Spirit ; the\nPile!;>tion !s continual ; in this Man hath no fhaie ';\nbut\n\fTuE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 165\nbut yet the Lord cannot purify Man from any Con-\n(:upifcence of Evil in his Spirit, or internal Man, fo\nlong as Man keepeth his External !hut ; there are\nEvils, by which Man keepeth his External ihut,\nwhereof each appeareth to him as one, although\nthere are Infinites in each ; when Man removeth\nthis feeming one, then the Lord removeth the Infi-\nnites Ih It. This is what is mc;int by the Lord's pu-\nrifying Man from Concupifcences of Evil in the in~\n\u2022 ternal Man, and from the Evils thcmfclvcs in the\nexternal.\n121. It is thought by many, that barely to believe\nthat which the Church teacheth, purifies a Man\nfrom Evils ; and it is thought by fame, that to do\nGood purifies ; by fame that to know, fpeak, and\nteach fuch Things as are of the Church ; by fomc\nthat to read the \\Vord and Books of Piety; by fomc\nto frequent Churches, to hear Sermons, and efpecial-\nly to receive the Holy Supper ; by fame to renounce\nthe \\Vorld, and fl:udy Piety ; by fome to confcfs\nthemfelves guilty of all Sins, and fo on. But\nneverthelefs none of thefe Things do at all puri-\nfy a Man, unlefs he explore himfelf, fee his Sins,\nacknowledge them, condemn himfelf for them,\nand repent by defifl:ing from them ; and all thcfe\nThings he mufl: do as from himfelf, but fl:ill from\nan Acknowledgment at Heart that he doeth them\nfrom the Lord. Before this is done, the above~\nnamed ACts anil Nothing, for they are either\nmeritorious or hypocritical ; and they appear in\nHeaven before the Angels either like beautiful Har-\nlots fmelling ofTenfi\\'cly from their Difeafes; or like\ndeformed \\Vemen appearing handfomc by putting\non \/\n\fI\n166 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\non Paint ; or like perfonating Players and Mimics\non the Stage ; or like Apes in human Apparel.\nBut when Evils are removed, then the above-men-\ntioned Aas become Aas of the Love, and the Doers\nthereof appear in Heaven before the Angels as ~eau\u00ad\ntiful Men, and as their Aifociates and Companions.\n122. \u00b7But it is well to be attended to, that Man\nin doing the 'Vork. of Repentance ought to look\nnp to the Lord only ; if be looks up to God the\nFather only, he cannot be purified ; nor if to the\nFather for the Sake of the Son ; neither if to the\nSon as a Man only ; for there is one God, and the\nLord is He, for his Divine and his Human [Eifence]\nconfi:itute one Perfon, as is fhewn in Ti-IE Doc-\nTRINE OF THE NEW }ERUASALEIVI CONCERNING\nTHE LoRD. That every one in doing Repentance\nmight look to the Lord only, the Holy Supper was\ninfi:ituted by Him, which confirms the Remiffion of\nSins with thofe who repent ; it confirms it, becaufe\nin that Supper, or Communion, every one is kept\nlooking to the Lord only.\nI 23. VII. That it is the * CoNTINUUM [contin-\nual Endeavour] ofthe Divine Providence ofthe Lord,\nto join Man to hin!felf and himfelf to Man, that he\nmay be able to give him the Felicities of eternal Life ;\nwhich cannot be done, but in Proportion as Evils 'l.iJttb\nth::ir Concup!fcences are rtl!Zoved.

In lhort, the\n\/Jrtimum is the End, the ContiJzu11m is the Mean~ or Ce.~fc, and the\nU\/:imzm: is the Effect.\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I6]\nnuum [continual Endeavour] of the Divine Provi-\ndence of the Lord to join Man to Himfelf and Him-\nfelf to Man, and that it is this ConjunCtion which\nis called Reformation and Regeneration, and that\nMan thence hath Salvation, was !hewn above, n. 27\nto 45\u00b7 'Who doth not fee that ConjunC\\:ion with\nGod is eternal Life and Salvation? This every one\nfees who believeth, that Men by Cre:1tion are Im-\nages and Likeneifes of God, Genefis i. 26, 27 ;\nand who knoweth what an Image and Likenefs of\nGod is. \\Vho that hath found Reafon, when he\nthinks from his Rationality, and wills to think from\nhis Liberty, can believe that there are three Gods,\nequal in Eifence, and that the Divine Eife or Di-\nvine Eifence can be divided ? That there is a Trine\n[threefold Principle] in one God, may be thought\nand comprehended, as the Soul and Body.is com-\nprehended in an Angel and in a Man, and the\nSphere of Life proceeding from them ; and where-\nas this Trine in one exifl:s only in the Lord, it fol-\nlows, that ConjunC\\:ion mufl: be with Him : Make\nUfe of your Rationality, and at the fame Time of\nyour Liberty of thinking, and you will fee this\nTruth in its Light, admitting only firfl:, that there\nis a God, and that there is a HeaYen, and eternal\nLife. Now forafmuch as God is one, and Man by\nCreation was made an Image and Likenefs of Him,\nand forafmuch as by infernal LoYe, and its Concu-\npifcences, and their Delights, he came into the Love\nof all Evils, and thereby defl:royed the Image and\nLikenefs of God in himfelf, it follows, that it is the\nContinuum of the Divine Providence of the Lord,\nthat he may conjoin Man to Himfelf and Himfelf\nto\n\f168 ANGELIC \\VI&DOl\\1 CONCERNING\nto Man, and thus caufe Man to be his Image: That\nthis is to the Intent, that the Lord may be able to\ngive Man the Felicities of eternal Life, follows alfo,\nfor fuch is the Nature of the Divine Love: But the\nReafon why he cannot give thofe Felicities, nor\n- make :Man an Image of Himfelf, except Man as\nfrom himfe1f remove Sins in the external 1\\lan, is,\nbecaufe the Lord is not only Divine Love, but alfo\nDivine vVifdom, and Divine Love doeth Nothing'\nbut from its Divine \u00b7wifdom, an~ according to it :\nThat Man cannot be conjoined to ~he Lord, and fo\nreformed, regenerated, and faved, unlefs he is per-\nmitted to act from Liberty according to Reafon;\n(for thereby Man is Man) is according to his Di-\nvine \\Vifuom, and whatfoever is according to the\nDivine \\Vifdom of the Lord, that alfo is of his Di-\nvine Providence.\nI 24. To what hath been faid I will add two Ar-\ncana of Angelic \\Vifdom, from which the Nature\nof the Divine Providence may be feen ; the firft is,\nthat the Lord never acts upon any particular Prin-\nciple in Man feparately, unlefs upon all at once :\nThe other is, that the Lord acts from Intimates\n[inmofl: Principles] and from Ultimates [laft or\nIowefl: Principles] at once. 'The Reqfon why the\nLord ne\u00b7-uer a{fetb upon any particular Principle in\n}\/Ianfeparately, unlefs uprm all at once, is, becaufe all\nThings of Man are in fuch Connexion, and by\ntheir Connexion in fuch Form, that they act, not\nas many, but as one : That Man, as to his Body,\nis in fuch Connexion, and by that Connexion in\nfuch a Form, is known; in a fimilar Form, by Vir~\ntue of the Connexion of- th~ \\\\Thole, is the hu~\nman\n\fTHE DiviNE PRovinn;cE. I 69\ninan Mind alfo, for the human Mind is the fpiritual\nMan; and is moreover aCtually a M~n: Hence it is\nthat the Spirit of Man, which is his Mind in the\nBody, is in: every Particular of its Form a Man,\n'Wherefore Man after Death is equally a T\\Ian as in\nthe World, only with this Difference, that he hath\nput off that Covering which confiituted bis Body\nin the \\Vo:dd. Now forafmuch as the human Form\nis fuch, that all its Parts make one common [Form]\n'vhich aB:s as one, it follows, that one Part cannot\nbe removed out of its Place and changed as to its\nState, but in Confent \\vith the refl:, for if one were\nmoved out of its Place and changed as to its Stare,\nthe Form would fufler, tvhich mufl: aa as one.\nHence it is evident, that the Lord never aEl:s upon\nany particular Part or !'rinciple, unlefs upon all at\nonce : Thus doth the Lord aa upon the univerfal\nAngelic Heaven, becaufe the univerfal Angelic\nHeaven in the Sight of the Lord is as one Man ; fo\nalfo doth the Lord aCl: upon every .Angel, becaufc\nevery Angel is a Heaven in its leaf!: Form ; fo alfo\ndoth he aCl: upon every Man, proximately upon all\nThings of his Mind, and through thefe upon all\nThings of his Body ; for the Mind of Man is his\nSpirit, and according to its Conjunction with the\nLord is an_Angel, and his Body is Obedience.\nBut it is well to be obfcrved, that the Lord atl:eth fin~\ngularly, yea mofi fingularly, alfo upon every Particu.\nlar of Man, but at the fame Time through all Things\nof his Form; neverthelefs he doth not change the\nState of any Part, or of any Thing in particular, ex.\ncept conveniently to the whole Form : But of this\nmore will be faid in what follows, where it will be de~\nX mon!lrated,\n\f170 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nmonfhated, that the Divine Providence ofthe Lord is\nuniverfal, becaufe it is in Singulars, and that it is fin-\ngular becaufe it is univerfal. The Rcqfon wby tbe Lord\na{\/etbfrom Intimates [inmq\/l Principles] andfrom Ulti-\nmates [lqfl or loH'(jl Principles] at once, is, becaufe thus\nand no otherwifc all and fingular Things are contain-\ned in their Connexion ; for Intermediates depend fuc-\nceffively upon Intimates [inmofl: Principles] even to\nUltimates, and in Ultimates \"\nthey exifl: all together ;\nfor in the Treatife en THE DIVINE LovE AND THl:\nDIVINE '\\VIsDoM, in Part the Third, it is fhewn,\nthat in the Ultimate [Part or Principle] there is\nthe Simultaneous derived from the Firfl of all Prin-\nciples. Hence alfo it is, that the Lord from Eter-\nnity, or Jehovah, c_ame into the \\:Vorld, and there\nput on and a!fumed the Human [Nature] in Ulti-\nmates [lafl: or lowefl: Principles,] that he might be\nfrom firfl: Principles at the fame Time in Ultimates,\nand thus from firft Principles by Ultimates govern\nthe univcrfal \\Vorld, and fo fave Men, whom he can\nfave:>. according to the Lav.;s of his Divine Provi-\ndence, which are alfo the Laws of his Divine '\\Vif-\ndom. In this Manner, therefore, it is true, what is\nknown in all Chrifl:ian Countries, that no Mortal\ncould have been faved, except the Lord had come\ninto the \\Vorld, concerning which fee THE Doc-\nTRINE OF THE NEW jERUSALEl\\( CONCERNING\nFAITH, n.. 35\u00b7 Hence it i3 that the Lord is called\nthe Firfl: and the Lafl.\n125. Thefe Angelic Arcana arc premifed, in\nOrder that it may be comprehended, how the Di-\n\\'ine Providence of the Lord operates, that he may\nconjoin Man to Himfelf, and Himfelf to Man ; thu\nlS\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I7I\nis not effetl:cd upon any Particular of l\\'lan feparate-\nly, except upon all of him at once ; and this is done\nfrom the Intimum [inmofl: Principle] of Man, and\nfrom his Ultimates at once : The Intimum of Man\nis his Life's Love, his Ultimates are the Things\nwhich are in the External of his Thought, his In-\ntermediates arc the Things \\vhich are in the Inter-\nnal of his Thought ; the Nature and ~ality of\nthefe Principles, in a wicked Man, was lhewn in the\nforegoing Pages ; from which Confideration it is\nagain evident, that the Lord cannot aft: from Inti-\nmates and Ultimates at once, except together with\nMan, for 1\\ian is together with the Lord in Ulti-\nmates ; wherefore as Man atl:eth in Ultimates,\nwhich are at his Difpofal, becaufe they are fubjeCl:\nto his Free-will, fo the Lord aaeth from lJiS Inti-\nmates, and 'upon Succeilives to Ultimates. The\nThings which are in the Intimates of lVIan, and in\nSucceffives from the Intimates to the Ultimates,\nare altogether unknown to Man, and therefore\nMan is totally ignorant how and what the Lord\noperates there.; but forafmuch as they cohere as\none with the Ultimates, therefore it is not neceifary\nfor Man to know more than that he ought to fhun\nEvils as Sins, and look up to the Lord. Thus and\nno otherwife can his Life's LoYe, which by Birth is\ninfernal, be removed by the Lord, and a Love of\ncelellial Life be implanted in Place of it.\n1 z6. \\Vhen the Love of celefl:ial Life is implant-\ned by the Lord in Place of the Love of infern:tl\nLife, then in Place of the Concupifcences of Evil\nand what is Falfe are implanted 1\\ffeClions of Good\nand Truth, and in Place of the Delights of the\nConcupifcences\n\f172 .ANGELIC \\VISDOl\\1 CONCERNING\nConcupifcen.ces of Evil and what is Falfe are im~\nplanted Delights of the Affeaions of Good, and in\nPlace of the Evils of infernal Love are implanted\nthe Goods of cele!l:ial Love : Then in!l:ead of Cun-\nning is implanted Prudence, and infiead ofT~oughts\nof Malice are implanted Thoughts of \\Vifdom ;\n, Thus .Man is born again, and becometh a new Man.\n\\Vhat Goods fucceed in Place of Evils, may be feen\nin THE DocTRINE oF LIFE FOR THE Nnv JE~\nRUSALEM, n. 67 to 73, 74 tO 79, 8o to 86, 87 to 911\nAlfo, ~hat in Proportion as\u00b7 a M~n flmnneth and\nturneth away from Evils as Sins, in the fame Pro~\nportion he loveth the Truths of Wifdom, n. 32 to\n41 ; and that in the fame Prop.ortion he hath Faith,\nand becometh fpiritual, n. 42 to 52~\n127. That it is the common Religiop in the uni-\nverfal Chrifl:ian Vvorld, that Man iho:uld examine\nhimfelf, fee his Sins, acknowledge them, confefs\nthem before God, and defifi from them, and that\nthis is Repentance, Remiffion ofSins, and thence Sal-\nvation, was Ipewn above from the Prayers read before\nthe Holy Communion in all the Chri!l:ian,Churches.\nThe fame may alfo appear from the Creed, which\nhath its Name from Athanafius, which alfo is\nrcceived in the whole Chrifl:ian \\Vorld, where at\nthe End there ~rc thefe Words, 'The Lord 'lvill comfJ\nto judge botb the .R.!.,<ick and tbe Dead, at whofe Com.\ning they wbo have done Good, will enter into Lift eter\u2022\nual, and tbey who bave done Evil, into eternal Fire.\n128. \\Vho doth not know from the 'iVord, that\nthe Life of every one after Death is according to\nhis AClions ?

I. That no one is\nreformed by Miracles and Signs, becaufe thEy force.\nII. That no one is reformed by Vifions and by\nConverfations with the Dead, becaufe they force.\nIll. That no one is reformed by Threats anJ Pun-\nifhments, becaufe they force. IV. That no one i.>\nreformed in States not of Rationality and not of\nLiberty. V.

That this is the Cafe,\nmay be rationally feen thus : It cannot be denied,\nthat Miracles induce Belief, anu firongly perfuade\nY that\n\fI 78 ANGELIC vVISDO:>I CONCERXlNG\nthat that is true, which is faid and taught by him\nwho doeth Miracles ; and that this at firfl: fo occu..\npieth the external Principle of Man's Thought, that\nit in a Manner binds and fafcinates it : But Man\nl1ereby is deprived of his two Faculties, which are\ncalled Rationality and Liberty, 'vhereby he is ena..\nbled to aC\\: from Free-will according to Reafon,\nand then the Lord cannot flow in through his In-\nternal into the external Priaciple of his Thought,\nbut only leave Man to confirm from his Rationality\nthat\u00b7Thing, which by the Miracle was made an Ob-\njeCt of his Belief. The State of Man's Thought il'?\nfuch, that from the internal Principle thereof he\nfees a Thing in the externa,l Principle thereof as it\nwere in a Glafs, for, as was faid aboye, a l\\lan can,\nfee his Thought, which cannot be but from interior\nThought; and when he fe~s an Objea as in a Glafs, .\nhe can alfo turn it this \\Nay and that, and fa!hion it,\nuntil it appeareth. to himfelf beautiful ; \\vhich Ob-\njeCt, if it be a Truth, may be compared unto a Vir-\ngin or Youth beautiful and aliYe ; but if the Man\ncannot turn that ObjeB: this \\Nay and that, and\nfaihion it, but only believe it fl'?m Perfuafion indu-\nced by a Miracle, in this Cafe, if it be a Truth, it\nmay be compared to a\u00b7 Virgin or Youth cut out of\nStone or Wood, in which there is no Life ; and it\nmay alfo be .compared to an Objefr, confl:antly be-\nfore tne Sight, which alone is feen, and hideth all\nthat is on either Side, and behind it ; it may \u00b7alfo\nbe compared to one continual Sound in the Ear,\nwhich taketh away the Perception of Harmony\narifing from feveral Sounds : Such Blindnefs and\nDeafnefs is induced in the human Mind by Mira~\ndes.\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 179\ndes. It is the fame with every Thing confirmed,\nwhich is not feen from fome Rationality before it is\nconfirmed.\nr3I. From thefe Confiderations it may appear,\nthat Faith induc~d by Miracles 'is not Faith, but\nPcrfuafion, for there is Nothing rational in it, frill\nlefs any Thing fpiritual, it being merely external\nwithout any int,ernal Principle : It is the fame with\nall thatt a Ma~ docth from that pe:-fuafive Faith,\nwhether fie ac'kno\\vledge God; or worfhip him at\nHome or at Church, or do Good: Wheri a Mi.\nracle only induceth Man to Acknowledgment of\nGod, to \\Vodhip and Piety, he aCteth from the\nnatural Man, and not from the fpiritual, for a Mira-\ncle infufeth Faith by an external \\Vay, and not by\nan internal Way, therefore from the \\:Vorlu and\nnot from Heaven ; and the Lord doth not enter\njnto Man by any other \\:Vay than by an internal\n\\Vay, which is by the \u00b7word, and by DoCtrine and\nPreachings derived from the V.ford ; and forafmuch\na:> Miracles lhut up this \\Vay, therefore at this Day\nno Miracles are wrought.\n132. That fuch is the Nature and EfFeCt of\nMiracles, may appear manife{lly from the Miracles\nwrought before the Jewifu and lfraelitifh People ;\nalthough this People faw fo many Miracles in the\n-\u00b7 Land of Egypt, and afterwards at the Red Sea, and\nothers in the Defart, and efpecially upon Mount\nSinai, when the Law was promulgated, neverthelefs\nin the Space of a Month, when Mofes r:uried upon\nthat Mountain, they made thcmfelves a golden Calf, \u00b7\naiTd acknowledged it for Jehovah who brought them\not.:.t of the Land of Egypt, Exoc. xxxii. 4-, 5, 6 :\nThe\n\f180 ANGELIC \\VISDO M COKCERNING\nThe fame aifo may appear from the Miracles\nwrought afterwards in the Land of Canaan, not-\nwithfl::mding which, the People fo often departed\nfrom the W orfhip commanded : As alfo from the\nMiracles which the Lord, when he was in the\n\\Vorld, wrought before them, and yet they cruci-\nfied him. The Reafon why Miracles were wrought\namong this People, was,.becaufe they were altogeth-\ner external Men, and were introduced into the Land\nof Canaan, merely that they might reprefent a\nChurch and its Internals by the Externals of Wor-\nfuip ; and a wicked Man may be a Reprefentative\nequally as well as a good Man ; the Externals of\nW odhip among them were Rituals, all which figni-\nned T hings fpiritual and celeftial ; yea Aaron, al-\nthouhh he made the golden Calf, and commanded\nthe \\\\7\nor!hip of it, Exod. xxxii. z, 3, 4, 5, 35, nev-\nerthelefs could reprefent the Lord and his Work of\nSalvation : And forafmuch as they could not, by\nthe Internals of vVorfhip, be led to reprefent thefe\nThings, therefore they were led, yea forced and\ncompelled to it, by Miracles. The Reafon why\nthey could not be brought to fuch Reprefentation\nby the Internals of W orfhip, \\Vas, becaufe they did\nnot acknov.\n:ledge the Lord, although the whole\nV!ord, which was among them, treateth of Him on..\nly; and he who doth not acknowledge the Lord,\ncannot receive any internal W orfhip : But after\nthat the Lord manifefl:ed himfelf, and was received\n~nd acknowledged as the Eternal God in the\nChurches, Miracles ceafed.\n133\u00b7 Neverthelefs the Effctt of Miracles llpon\nthe Good is different from what it is upon the\n\\Vickcd;\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. ISI\n\"\\Vicked : The Good do not de!ire Miracles, but\nthey believe the Miracles which are recorded in the\nvVord ; and if they hear any Thing of a Miracle,\nthey attend no otherwife to it than as a light Argu-\nment which confirms their Faith, for they think\nfrom the Word, confequently from the Lord, and\nnot from a Miracle. It is otherwife with the Wick-\ned ; they indeed may be compelled and forced into\nFaith, yea into. W odhip and Piety, but only for a\nihort Time ; for their Evils are fhut in, the Concu-\npifcences of which, and the Delights thence derived,\ncontinually aCl: againfi: the external Principle of their\nWorfhip and Piety, and in Order that thefe Evils\nmay efcape from their Confinement and break out,\nthey think of the Miracle, and at length call ir a\nDelu!ion or an Artifice, or an Operation of Nature,\nand fo return to their Evils ; and he who returns\nto his Evils after Worfhip, profanes the Truths and\nGoods of Worfhip, and the Lot of Profaners after\nDeath is the worfi: of all : Thefe are they who are\nmeant by the Lord's vVords in Matt. xii. 43 . 44,\n45; whofe lafi: State is worfe than their firft. More-\nover, if Miracles were to be wrought before thofe,\nwho do not believe by Virtue of the Miracles re-\ncorded in the Word, they mufi: be continually per-\nformed, and prefented conftantly to View with fuch\nPerfons. From thefe Confiderations it may appear,\nwhence it is that Miracles are not performed at this\nDay.\n134\u00b7 II.

But thofe Spi-\nrits are now collcB:ed by rhe Lord, and cafr into a\nHell feparatc from the Hells of others.

It is a known Thing,\nZ that\n\fI 86 ANGELIC \\VISDOl'd CONCERNING\nthat the External qnnot force the Internal, but\nthat the Internal can force the External : It is alfo\nknown, that the Intern~! is fo averfe to Force from\nthe External, that it turneth itfelf away : And it is\nalfo known, that external Delights allure the Inter-\nnal to Con!ent and to Love : It may alfo be known,\nthat there exills internal Confhaint and internal\nLiberty. But all thefe Points, although they are\nknow.n, are neverthelefs to be illufhated ; for there\nare many Things, which) when they are heard, are\nimmediately perceived to be fo, becaufe they are\nTmths,' and thence they are affirmed, but if they\nate not at the fame Time confirmed by Reafons,\nthey may be invalidated by Arguments from Falla\"\ncies, and at length denied ; wherefore the Things,\nwhich are now mentioned as known, are to be re-\naifumed and rationally co:1firmed. FIRST, Tbat the\nExternal cannotforce the Internal, but tbat the Inter-\nnal can force the External : Who can be forced to\nbelieve and to love ? It is not poffible for any one\nto be forced to believe, any more than to think that\na Thing is fo) when he doth not think fo ; and it is\nnot pofiible for any one to be forced to love, any\nmore than to \\vill that which he doth not will, for\nBelief is of the Thought, and Love is of the \\Viii :\nBut the Intern;:-J by the External may be forced not\nto fpeak j[l againfl: the Laws of the Kingdom, the\nMor...\n1ls of Life, and the Sancrities of the Church ;\nthe Internal may be force\"d to this by Threats and\nPunifhments, and alfo is forced and ought to be\nforced; but this Internal is not an Internal properly\nhuman, but it is an Internal which Man hath in\ncommon with Beafis, which alfo can be forced ;\nthe\n\fTH:t!: DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I 87\nthe human Internal refides above this animal Inter-\nnal : The human Internal is here meant,. which\ncannot be forced. SECONDLY, Tbat the Internal is\n.fo av.:rft to Force frcm the External, that it turJletb\nitfl!f away ; the Reafon is, becaufe the Internal\nwilleth to be at Liberty, and loves Liberty; for Lib-\nerty is of the Love or of the Life of Man, as was\nfhewn above ; wherefore when Liberty perceiveth\nitfelf to be forced, it withdraws itfelf as it were.\nwithi.n itfelf, and averteth itfelf, and regardeth\nForce as its Enemy ; for the Love, which maketh\nthe Life of Man, is exafperated, a~d caufeth lvbn\nto think, that thus he is not his o\\vn, cortfequently\nthat he doth not live to himfelf. The Reafon whv\nJ\nthe Internal of Man is fuch, is grounded in the.\nLaw of the Divine Providence of the Lord, that\nI\\'Ian may aCt from Liberty according to Reafon.\nHence it is evident, that to force Men to Didne\n\\Vor\u00a3hip by Threats and Punifhments, is hurtful.\nBut there are fame who fuffer themfelvcs to be for-\nced to Religion, and there are fome who do not ;\nthey who fuffer themfelves to be forced to Religion,\nare many of the Papifrs, bur this is the Cafe with\nthofe, in whom there is Nothing internal in \\Vor-\nfhip, but all is external : They who do not fuffer\nthemfelves to be forced, are many of the Englifh\nNation, and hence it comes to pafs that there is an\nInternal in their \\Vor!hip, and what is in the Exter-\nnal is from the Internal : The Interiors of thefe\nlatter, as to Religion, appear in fpiritual Light like\nwhite Clouds ; but the Interiors of the former, as\nto Religion, appear in the Light of Heaven like\ndark Clouds: Both thefe Appearances are given to\nbe\n\f188 ANGELIC .WISDOM CONCERNIN~\u00b7\nbe feen in the fpiritual \\Vorld, and whoever will\nmay fee them, when he enters that World after\nDeath : Moreover, confhained \\Vorfhip fhuts in\n~viis, 'vhich in fuch Cafe lie hid like Fire in Wood\nund~r the Afhes, which continually kindletl1 and \u00b7\npilateth itfelf, untH it breaketh out into a Flame ;\nwhereas \\Vorfhip, which is not confl:rained, hut\nfpontaneous, doth not fhut in Evils ; wherefore\nthey are like Fires which immediately burn out and\n1\nare difperfed. From thefe (:onfiderations it is evi-\ndent, that the Inteq1al hath fuch a Repugnance to\nReHt:aint, that it averteth itfclf. The Reafon \"\\t'hy\nthe Internal can force the External, is, pecaufc the\nInternal is like a Mafl:er, and the External is like a\nServant. THIRDL~\u00b7, Tbat Extenzal Delights allure\nrhe Internal to C01!fent, and a!fo to Lo\u00b7ue :. Delights\n' are of two Kinds, Pelights of the Undelflanding\nand Delights of th~ Will, the Delights of the Un-\nderfi:anding are alfo Delights of Wifdom, and the\nDelights of the \\Viii are alfo Delights of Love, for\nWifdom is of the Underfi:anding, and Love is of\nthe Will : Now forafmuch as the Delights of the\nBody and of.its $enfes, which are ~xternal Delights,\n~1a as one with internal Delights, which are of the\nUnderfl:anding and of the Will, it follows, that as\nthe Internal refufeth Confi:raint from the External,\ninfomuch that it turneth itfelf away, fo the Internal\ngratefully beholds Delight in the External, info-\ninuch that it turneth itfelf to it ; thus is produced\nConfent ~n !he Part of the Underfi:anding, and\nLove on the Part of the 'Will. All Infants in the\nfpiritual World are introduced into a!lgelic 1;yifdom,\n~\u00b7nd by it into celefi:ial Love, by Delight~ and Pleaf;\n\u00b7 \u00b7 . antneffe:>\n--------- -----------~\n\f\u2022\nTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. I 89\nantneifcs from the Lord, firfl: by bcauti~ul ObjeB:s\nin Houfes, and by pleafant Things in Gardens, then\nby Reprefentatives of Things fpiritual, which affect\nthe Interiors of their Minds with Pleafure, and la!l-\nly by Truths of \\Vifdom, and fo by Goods of Love;\nthus continually by Delights in tpeir Order, firfl: qy\nthe Delights of Love of the Undedl:anding and its\n\\Vifdom, and lafi:ly by the Delights of the Love of\nthe Will, which becomes thdr Life's Love, under\nwhich the other Things, which entered by Delights,\nare kept fubordi11:1te. This is done, becaufe all of\nthe Under!landing and \u00b7\\Vill is to be formed by the\nExternal, before it is formed by tlie Internal ; for all\nof the Underfl:anding and \\Viii is formed firfl: by the\nThings which enter through the Scnfcs of the Body,\n~fpecially through the Sight and Hearing ; but\nwhen the firfl: Underfl:anding and the firfl: Will are\nformed, then the Internal of Thought regards them\nas the External of its Thought, and either conjoin-\neth itfelf \\vith them, or feparates itfelf from them ;\nit conjoineth itfelf with them if they are delightful,\nand feparates itfelf from them if they are not. But\nit is \\vell to be attended to, that the Internal of the\nUnderfbnding doth not join itfelf with the Internal\nof the \\Vill, but that the Internal of the \\Vill join-\neth itfelf with the Internal of the Underf'randing,\nand caufeth a reciprocal ConjunCl:ion ; but this is\ndone by the Internal of the \\Viii, and riot at all by\nthe Internal of the Underfl:anding. Hence it is,\nthat Man cannot be reformed by Faith aJone, but\nby the LoYe of the \\Vill which fonneth Faith to\nitfdf. FouRTHLY, That there o4ls internal Con-\njiraint m?d internal Libtrty : 1nternal Confiraint ex-\nifl.s\n\f190 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\nif'l:s with thofe, who are in external \\Vorfhip alone\nand in no internal ; for their Internal is to think\nand will that, to which their External is forced ;\nthefe arc they who are in the v.,ror!hip of Men liv-\ning and dead, and thence in the W or!hip of Idols,\nand in the Faith of Miracles ; in thefe there doth\nnot exill any Internal, but what at the fame Time\nis external. But with thofe who are ih the Internal\nof \\\\ror!hip, there is given internal Conftraint, one\nKind from Fear, and another from Love; internal\nConfl:raint from Fear, is in thofe, who are in \u00b7wor-\nfhip from the Fear of infernal Torment and its Fire;\nbut this Internal is not the Internal of Thought,\nwhich was before treated of, b)lt the External of\nThought, which is here called Internal becaufe it is\nof Thought; the Internal of Thought, which was\nbefore treated of, cannot be forced or confl:rained '\nby any Fear ; but it can be forced by Love and by\nthe Fear of lofing it ; the Fear of God in a genuine\nSenfe is Nothing elfe; to be forced by Love and by\nthe Fear of lofing it, is to force one's Self ; that to.\nforce one's Self is not againft Liberty and \u00b7Rational~\nity, will be fecn below.\n1 37. Hence it may appear, what conllrained\nW orfhip is, and what unconllrained W ori11ip is ;\nconfrrained \\Vor!hip is corporeal, inanimate, ob.\nfcure, and gloomy Worfhip; corporeal, becaufe it\nis of the Body, and not of the 1\\\u00b7Iind; inanimate, be-\ncaufe there is no Life in it; obfcure, becaufe there is\nno Underllanding in it; and gloomy, becaufe there\nis no Delight of Heaven in it. But unconfl:rained\nWorfhip, when it is genuine, is fpiritual, living,\nlucid, and joyful \\Vodhip ; fpiritual, becaufe there\nlS\n\fTnE DxvtN.t PROVIDENCE. 191\nis Spirit from the Lord in it ; living, becaufe there\nis Life from the Lord in it ; lucid, becaufe there is\n\\Vifdom from the Lord in it ; and joyful, becaufe\nthere is Heaven from the Lord in it.\n138. IV. That no one is reformed in States ofNon-\nRationality and ofNon-Liberty : It \\Yas !Le\u2022vn above,\nthat Nothing is appropriated to Man, but what he\ndoeth from Liberty according to Rcafon ; the Rea-\nfan is, becaufe Liberty is of the Will, ad Reafon is\n\u00b7 of the Underfi.anding, and when l\\hn aCts from\nLiberty according to Reafon, then he aCts from his\n'Will through his Underfl:anding, aD.d what is done\nin ConjunCtion of both, that is appropriated. Now\nforafmuch as the Lord willerh, that Man fhould be\nreformed and regenerated, that he may have eter-\nnal Life or the Life of Heaven, and no one can be\nreformed and regenerated, unlefs Good be appro-\npriated to his \\Nill that it may be as it were his\nown, and Truth to his Under!b.nuing that it may\nalfo be as it were his own ; and forafalUch as Noth-\ning can be appropriated to any one, but what is from\nthe Liberty of his 'Will ac~ording to the Reafon of\nhis Underfl:anding-, it follows, that no one is reform-\ned in States of Non-Liberty and of Non-Rationality.\nStates of Non-Liberty and Non-Rarionality are fev-\neral ; but in general they m:1y be referred to thefe,\nStates of Fear of1\\'Iisfortzme, a d!ftafed State of J,1im!1\nbodily Sicknefs, Ignorance, and B!indnefs ofthe Under-\nflanding ; but of each State Something fhall be faid\nin particular.\n139\u00b7 The Reafon why no one i3 ref.:1rmcd in A\nSTATE OF FEAR, is, becaufe Fear taketh away Free-\n\\Vill and Reafon, or Liberty and Rationality; for\nLove\n\f!92 ANGEL!C \\VIS!)OM CO~CER.!';'ING\nLove openeth the Interiors of the Mind, but Feat\nfhuts them, and when they are fhut, Man thinks\nlittle, and only what offers itfelf to the Mind and\nSenfes: Such iS' the Efrea of -all Fears which invada\nthe Mimi. That man hath an internal Principle of\nThought, and an external Principle of Though~,\nwas !hewn above : Fear never can invade the inter..\nnar Principle of Thought, this Principle being al~\nways in Freeuom, becaufe it is in its Life's Love ;\nbut it can invade the external Principle of Thought;\nand when it invades this Principle, the internal Prin\"'\nciple of Thought is ihut, and this being ihut, Man\ncan no longer aCt from Liberty according to his\nReafon; therefore cannot be reformed. The Fear\nwhich inndes the external Principle cf Thought;\nand clofeth the internal, is principally the Fear of\nthe Lofs of Honour or of Intereft; but Fear for civ-\nil Punifhments, and for external ecclefiafl:ical Pun-\nifhments, doth not clofe it, becaufc thefe Laws ouly\nprefcrit>e Punilhments fer thofe who fpeak and a[!;\nagainft the civil Infiitutions of a Kingdom and the\nfpiritual ones of the Church, but not for thofc who\nthink ag:ainfl them. The Fear of infernal Punifh.\nment indeed invades the external Principle of\nThought, but only for fome Moments, or Hours, or\nDays, but afterwards this is reftorcd to its Liberty\nfrom the internal Principle of Thought, which is\nproperly ofMan'8 Spirit and Life's Love, and is call-\ned the Thought of the Heart. But Fear for the\nLofs of Honour and Interdt invades the external\nPrinciple of the Tho.ught of Man, and when it in.\nvad~s, it 'fhuts the internal Principle of Thought\nabove againfl the Influx from Heaven, and caufcth\nthat.\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 193\nthat a Man cannot be rcfor~ed : The ReaCon is, be-\ncaufe the Life's Lm'e of every M::m is by Birth the\nLove of Self and of the WorlJ, and the Love ofSelf\nn1aketh one \\vith the Love o'f Honour, and the Lm e\nof the \\Vorld maketh one \\Vith the Love of lntercll: ;\n' wherefore when a Man is in Poifeffion of Honour or\nof Interefl:, out of Fear for the Lofs of them, he con-\nfirms in himfelf Means, whis:h arc fubfervient to\nHonour and Interell:, and \\vhich are as well of a\ncivil as an ecclefiafl:ical Nature, both refpeEting Gov--\nernment; in like Manner he aeletb, who is not yet\nin Pofieffion of Honour or Lucre, if he afpires to\nthem, but out of Fear for the Lofs of Reputation for\nthe Sake of them. It is faid that this Fear invades\nthe external Principle of Thought, and fhuts the in-\nternal above againfi Influx from Heaven; this latter\nPrinciple is faid to be ihut or clofed, when it entirely\naB:s as one with the External, for then it is not in\nitfelf, but in the External. But forafmuch as the\nLO\\\u00b7es of Self and of the \\Vorld are infemal Loves,\nand the Sources of all Evils, it is evident of what Na-\nture the internal Principle of Thought is, in itfelf,\nwith thofe in whom thefe Loves reign or are the\n~ c\nLife's Loves, namely, that it is full of Concupifcences\nof E\\'ils of all Kinds. This they do not know, who,\nfrom the Fear, of the Lofs of Digr1ity and Opulence,\nare in a powerful PerJuafion of the Religion in\nwhich they are principled, efpecially in a Religion\nwhich invokes, that they !hould be wor01ipped as\nDeities, and at the fame Time as Plutos in Ht.:ll;\nthefe can burn as it were with Zeal for the Salvation\nof Souls, and this neverthelcfs from infernal Fire.\n\\Vhereas this Fear efpecially taketh away Rational~\nA A ity\n\f194 ANGELIC \\V!SDOM CONCERNING\nity itfelf, and Liberty itfelf, which are of celefi:ial\nOrigin, it is evident that it is an Obfiacle to Man'\u2022\nbeing reformed.\nqo. The Reafon why no one is reformed in A\nSr.\\TE OF MisFoRTUNE, if he then only thinketh\nof God and imploreth Afiifl:ance, is, becaufe it is a\nState of Confrraint; wherefore when he cometh in-\nto a State of Liberty, he returneth into l:is former\nState, in which he had thought little if any Thing of\nGod: Not fo they, who feared God before, in a\nState of Liberty. By fearing God is meant to fear\nto offend him, and to offend him is to fin ; and this\nis not of Fear, but of Love: Who that lo~\u00b7eth any\none, doth not fear to do him Harm, and the more\nhe loveth him, the more he feareth it? \\:Vithout this\nFear, Love is lifelefs and fuperficial, appertaining to\nthe Thought only, and not to the Will. By States\nof Misfortune are meant States of Defperation from\nDangers, as in Battles, Duels, Shipwrecks, Falls,\nFires, imminent or unexpeB:ed Lofs of \u00b7wealth, alfo\nof Office and thence of Honour, and other fuch-like\nCafes : In thefe only to think of God, is not from\nGod, but from Self; for then the Mind is as it were\nimprifoned in the Hody, therefore not in Liberty,\nand thence neither in Rationality, without which\nReformation is not given.\nI\u2022P\u00b7 The Reafon why no one is reformed in A\nDISORDERED STATE oF MrNo, is, becaufe Difeafe\nof the 1\\'lind (.Jfgritudo Animi) taketh away Ration-\nality;and thereby the Liberty of aB:ing according to\nReafon; for a difordered or fick Mind is not found,\nand the. found Mind is rational, and not the fick\nMind. Such Diforders of the Mind are Melancho.\nlies,\n\fTHE DiVINE PROVIDENCE. 195\nlies, fpurious and falfe Confciences, Phantafies of va\u00b7\nrious Kinds, Grief of Mind from Misfortunes, Anx-\nieties and 1\\.ngui{h of Mind from a Difeafe of the\nBody, which are fornetimcs confrdered as Tempta-\ntions, but they are not, becaufe genuine Temptations\nhave for their Object fpiritual Things, and in thefc\nthe Mind is wife, but the former have for their Ob-\njeCt natural Things, and in thcfe the Mind 1s\ninfane.\n142. The Reafon why no one is reformed\u00b7 in A\nSTATE OF BoDILY DtsEASE, is, becaufe Reafon\nthen i~ not in a free State, for the State of the Mind\ndepends upon the State of the Body; when the BoJy\nis fick, the l\\lind alfo is fick, if not otherwifc, yet\nby being removed from the \u00b7world, for a Mind re-\nmoved from the vVorld thinks indeed of God, but\nnot from God, for it is not ill the Liberty of Reafon ;\nl\\1an hath Freedom of Reafon from this Circum-\nfiance, that he is in the Midfi: between Heaven and\nthe \\Vorld, and that he can think from Heaven and\nfrom the \\Vorld, alfo from Heaven concerning the\n\\Vorld, and from the World concerning He:lVen :\n\\Vhen therefore a Man is in a Difcafe, and thinketh\nof Death, and of the State of his Soul after Death,\nthen he is not in the \\Vorld, and is abfi:rafted in\nSpirit, in which State alone no one can be reformed ;\nbut he may hereby be confirmed, if he was reformed\nbefore he fell into the Difeafe. It is the fame with\nthofe who renounce the \\Vorld and all Bufinefs in\nit, and give themfelves up folely to Thoughts con-\ncerning God, Heaven, and Salvation ; but of this\nmore elfewhere. \\Vherefore the fame, if they arc\nnot reformed before the Difeafe, after_it, if they\ndie,\n\f~96 ~-\\NGELIC \\VrsDOM CONCERNING\ndie, become furh as th~y were hefore the Difeafe;\nl1ence it is a va:n Thing to think, that any can re-\npent, or rccci\\'e any Faith under Difeafes, for there\nis Nothing of Action in that Repentance, and Noth-\ning of Charity \u00b7in that Faith, wherefore all is of the\nI\\Iouth, and Nothing of the Heart in both.\n143\u00b7 The Reafon why no one is reformed in A\nSTATE oF lcNORANCE, is, becaufe all Reformation\nis effeEted by Truths, and by a Life according to\nthem, wherefore they who do not know Truths, can.\nnot be reformed ; but if they defire Truths from\nthe Affection thereof, they are reformed in the fpi-\nritual V\\rorld after Death.\n144\u00b7 That neither can any be reformed in A\nSTATE OF BLINDNESS OF THE UNDERSTANDING:\nThefe alfo do not know Truths, confequently nei:.\nther do they know Life,for Underfl:anding mufl: teach\nthem, and the \\Vill muft do them, and when the\nWill deeth what the Underftanding teacheth, then\nit hath Life according- to Truths ; but when the\nUnderilancling is blinded, the \\Vill alfo is clofed,\n~nd doth not do from Lberty according to Reafon\nany Thing but the Evil confirmed in the Under..\nfianding, which is Falfe. Religion alfo, as well as\nIgnorance, blindeth the Underfl:anding, when it\nteacheth a blind Faith : So doth Doarine of what\nis fa!fe ; for as Truths open the Underfl:anding, fo\nfalfe Principles fhut it ; they fhut it above, but open\nit below, and the UnderflFtnding, open only below,\n\u00b7cannot fee Truths, but oply conprm whatfoevcr it\nwiHeth, efpe.c!ally what is falfe, The Underfl:and,.\ning is ali? blinded by the Lufl:s of Evil ; fo long as\nthe VJjll is in fuch Lufl:s, it forceth the Underfland..\n. . mg\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 197\ning to confirm them ; and as far as the Lufl:s of\nEvil are confirmed, fo far the \\Vill cannot be in Af-\nfeaions of Good, and from them fee Truths, and fo\nbe reformed. As for Example; when a Man is in\nthe Lufl: of Adultery, his \\Vill, which is in the.De-\nlight of his Love, forceth his Underfiandii1g to con-\nfirm it, by faying, \\Vhat is Adultery ? Is there any\nBarm in it ? Is there not the fame Harm in the\nConnexion between Hufband and \\Vifj:: ? Cannot\nChildren equally be born from Adultery ? Caunot\na \\Voman admit more than one without any Harm ?\nWhat hath any fpiritual Con{ideration to do in this\nCafe ? Thus doth the Underfbnding, \\vhich then\nis the Harlot of the \\Vill; think, and fo fiupid is it\nmade by its \\iVhoredom with the Will, that it can-\nnot fee that conjugal Love is fpiritual celefiial Lo\\'e\nitfelf, which is an Image qf the Love of the Lord\nand of the Church, from which alfo it is derived,\nang thus that in itfelf it is holy, being eifential\nChafiity, Purity, and Innocence; ;;nd that it ma-\nketh Men Loves in Form,\u00b7 for \u00b7m'arried Pairs can\nlove each other mutually from their inmo!t Souls,\nand fo form themfelves into Loves; and that :Adul-\ntery defrroyeth this Form, and with it the Image\u00b7of\nthe Lord ; and what is horrible, that the Adulterer\nmixeth his Life with the Life of the Huiband in\nhis Wife, for in the Seed is the Life of Man : And\nforafmuch as tnis is profane, therefore Hell is call-\ned Adultery, and on the contrary Heaven is called\nMarriage : The. Love .\u00b7of Adultery alfo communi-\ncates \\Vith the 1owefl:: Hell,'but Love truly conjugal .\n\\Vith the inmofl::\u2022Heaven ; the Members \u00b7of.Genera-\ntion of both Sexes alfo cortefnond to) Spcieties o'f\n...\nthe\n\f!98 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\nthe inmo!l: Heaven. Thefe Particulars are adduced,\nthat it may be known, how much the Underfiand-\ning is blinded when the \"Will is in the Lu!l: of Evil ;\nand that in a State of Blindnefs of the Under!l:and-\ning no one can be reformed.\n145\u00b7 V. That it is not contrary to Rationality and\nLiberty for a ~klan to force hin!fe!J. It was fuewn.\nabove, that Man hath an internal Principle of\nThought; antl an external Principle of Thought,\nand that they are difiinB: as Prior and Pofierior, or\nas Superior and Inferior ; and forafmuch as they\nare fa difiinct, it was fhewn that they can act fepa-\nrately, and can act in Conjunfcion ; they act fepa-\nrately, when a Man fpeaketh and actcth from the.\nexternal Principle of his Thought otherwife than\nhe interiorly thinketh and willeth ; and they act in\nConjunction, when he fpeaketh and doeth what he\ninteriorly thinketh and willeth; the latter Cafe is\ncomn~on with the fincere, but the former with the\ninfincere. Now forafmuch as the internal and the\nexternal Principles of the Mind are fa dilliner, the\nInternal can alfo fight with the External, and by\nCombat compel him to confent : Combat exifis,\nwhen Man thinketh Evils to be Sins, and therefore\nwilletl1 to defift from them, for when he defifl:eth,\nthe Door is opened, which being opened, the Con-\ncupifcences ofEvil,,which befieged the internal Prin-\nciple of Thought, are.cafl: out by the Lord, and in\nPlace thereof are implanted AffeCtions of Good ;\nand this in th~ internal Princir.le of Thought:\n..But whereas the Delights of the .Concupifcences\nof Evil, which befiege the external Principle cf\nThought, \u00b7 cannot at the fame Time be caH: out,\n' - therefore\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 199\ntherefore a Combat exifls between the internal and\nthe external Principle of Thought ; the Internal\nwilleth to caft out thofe Delights, becaufe they are\nDelights of Evil, and do not accord with the Affec~\ntions of Good, in which the Internal now is, and in\nPlace of the. Delights of Evil to introduce Delights\nof Good, which accord; the Delights of Good are\nwhat are called Goods of Charity. From this Con-\ntrariety c:rifeth a Combat, which, if it becometh\ngrievous, is called Temptation. Now forafmuch\nas Man is Man by Virtue of the internal Principle\nof his Thought, this being the Spirit of Man itfelf,\nit is evident that Man forceth himfelf, when he\nforceth the external Principle of his Thought to ,\nconfent to or to receive the Delights of his Affec-\ntions, which are Goods of Charity. That this is\nnot contrary to Rationality and Liberty, but \u00b7con.\nformable to them, is evident, for Rationality cauf~ \u2022\neth the above Combat, and Liberty executes it ;\nLiberty itfelf alfo with Rationality refidcs in the in.\nternal Man, and from the Internal in the External.\n\\Vhen therefore the Internal conquereth, which is\nthe Cafe when the Internal hath reduced the.Exter-:\nnal to Confent and Obedience, then Liberty itfelf\nand Rationality itfelf are given l\\lan by the Lord ;\nfor then Man is delivered by the Lord from infernal\nLiberty, which in itfelf is Servitude, and placed in\nceldl:ial Liberty, which in itfelf is real Liberty, and\nit is given him to affociate with Angels. That they\n:ue \u2022\nSernnts who are in Sins, and that the Lord\nrnaketh them free, who receive Truth from Him\nthrough the \\Vord, he himfelf tea~heth in John,\nChap. vili.. 31 to 36.\nJ46. Le~\n\f200 ANGELIC \u00b7\\VISDOM CONCERNING\n!46. Let us take an Example by Way of Illuf\n..\ntration : Suppofe a Man, who bad perceived De\u00b7\nlight in Frauds and 'clandefl:ine Thefts, to fee and\nacknowledge thq.t they are Sins, a11d therefore to\nwill to deflfl: from them ; when he defifl:eth, then\narifes a Combat of the internal Man with the exter:\nnal ; the internal Man is -i:Y the AffeB:ion of Sincer..\nity, but the external as~yet in the Delight of De\u00b7\nfraudation ; which .Delight, becaufe it is altogether\noppotlte to the Delight of Sincerity, doth not recede,\nunlefs it be compelled, \u00b7\u00b7 neither can it be compelled\nwithout a Combat; \u00b7and 'then when he overcomes,\nthe :external Man cometh into the Delight of the\nLove of Sincerity, which is Charity ; afterwards\nfucceilively the Delight of Defraudation becometh__\nundtlightful to him.\u00b7 It is fimilar with other Sins,\nas with Adulteries and Fo'rnications, .Revenges and\nHatreds, ~lafphemies and Lies.\u00b7 . But the mofr dif..\nficult Combat of all is with the Love of Dominion\nfrom the Love of Self; he who fubdueth this, eafily\nfubdueth other evil Loves, becaufe it is the Head of\nthem.\n147. We fhall alfo briefly fhew, how the Lord\ncafteth out the Concupiicences of Evil, which be-\nfiege the internal .Man from his\u00b7 Bi1\u00b7th, and in Place\nof them planteth \u00b7Affecriom of Good, when Man as\nfrom himfclf removet11 EYils as Sins : It was {hewn\nabove, that. Man haih a natural Mind, a fpiritu-\n:11 Mind, and a cdefrial Mind ; and that Man is in\nthe natural Mind only, as long as he is in the Con-\ncti.pifcences of Evil and their Delights, and that fo\nlong the fpiritual I\\'Iind is fhut ; but as foon ;:ts Man\nafter Self-examination acknowlec3geth Evils as Sins\nagainft\n\fl\"HE DIVINE PROVIDENC!::. 201\nngainfl: God, becaufe they are contrary to the Di~\nvine La~s, and therefore willeth to defifl: from.\nthem, then the Lord oprncth the f~iritual Mind, and\nentereth into the natural by the Aft~crions of Truth\nand Goodnefs, and entaeth into the rational, and\nfrom it difpofeth in Order the Things.\n, which are\ncontrary to Order below in the natmal : This\nit is which appeareth to Mail as a Corr.bat, and in\nthofe who bav\u00b7e indulged much in the Dciights of\nEvil, as Temptation; for it gives Paiu to the Mind,\nwhen the Order of its T houghts is imertcd. Now\nforafmuch as the Combat i:1 againfl: the Things\nwhich are in l\\b.n himfelf, and whiLh 1\\hn feels :1s\nhis own~ and no one can fight againfi l:imidf eX\u2022\nC:ept from what is interior in himfelf, <md except\nfrom Liberty there~ it follows, that the internal Man\nthen fighteth againft the external, aud that he do-\neth it from Liberty, and that hr. forceth the .Exit>r-\nnal to Obedience ; this therefore is to force birnfelf:\nThat this is not contrary to Liberty and Rationality,\nbut according to them, is evident.\n148. Moreover every Man willeth to be free,\nand not to remove Liberty but Servitude fi\u00b7om him\"\nfelf; every Boy, who is under a Mafl:er, wil!eth to be\nhis own !VIafl:er, and fo to be free; the fame is true\nof every 1\\lan-Servant under his Mafl:er, and of eve\"\nry 1\\Iaid-Servant under her Mifl:refs ; every Virgin\nalfo willeth to depart out of her Father's Houfe and\nmarry, that fhe may act freely in her own Houfe;\nevery Youth who willeth to work, or traffic, or ex\"\nercife foine Office, while qe is in Servitude under\nothers, willeth to be emancipated, that he may be\nhis own Mafl:er: All they, who ferve fpontancoufly\nB B - for\n\f'202 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nfor the Sake of Liberty, force themfelves, and in\nforcing themftlves they ::\u00a3c from Liberty according\nto Reafon, but from intericir Liberty, from which\nexterior Liberty is regarded as a Servant. Thefe\nConfidcratior~s are adduced, in Order to confirm\nthe Pofition, that for a Man to force himfelf is not\ncontrary to Rationality and Liberty.\n149\u00b7 One .Reafon why Man doth not in like\n1\\'lanner defire to come out of fpiritual Servitud~\ninto fpiritual Liberty, is, that he doth not know\nwhat fpiritual Servitude is, and what fpiritual Lib-\nerty is ; he hath not the Truths which teach it, and\nwithout Truths it is thought that fpiritual Servitude\nis Liberty, and fpiritual Liberty Servitude. Anoth-\ner Reafon is, becaufe the Religion of the ChriUian\n\\Vorld hath !hut up the Underfl:anding, and Soli-\nfidianifm (the DoB:rine of Faith alone) hath fealed\nit, fer thr::y have both placed about themfelves, like\nan Iron \\Vall, this Tenet, that Theological Things\ntranfccnd, and that ti~ere:ore they are not to be ,ap-\nproacheJ from any Rationality, and that they arc\nfor the Blind and not for thofe who fee ; by this\nthe Truth~ have been hid, which would teach what\nfpiritual Liberty is. A third Reafon is, becaufe\nfew cxamir1e themfelves, and fee their Sins, and he\nwho doth not fee them, and deflfl from them, is in\nthe Liberty of them, w1\n1ich is infernal Liberty, in\nitfelf Servitude, and frorn this to fee celefl:ial Liber-\nty, which is Liberty itfelf, is like feeing Light from\nDarkncfs, anJ fecirw under a black Cloud that\n'\"'\nwhich is above it from the Sun. Hence it is, that\nit is not known what celefl:ial Liberty is, and that\n\\he Difference between this and infernal Liberty is\nlike\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 203\n~ke the Difference between what is alive and what\nis dead.\n150. VI. 'That the external llfan is to be reformed\nby the internal, and not vice verfa. By the interni!.l\nand the external l\\'Ian the fame is meant a~ by the\ninternal and the external Principle of Thought,\nwhich have often been treated of before : The\nReafon why the external is reformed by the inter-\nnal, is, becaufe the internal floweth into the exter-\nnal, and not vice \u00b7vcrfa: That there is a fpiritual\nInflux into natural, and not r\n..;icc <t\u00b7erj\na, is known in\nthe learned \\VCorld : And that the internal Man is\nfirfl to be purified and renewed~ and thereby the\nexternal, is known in the Church ; the Reafon\nwhy it is known, is, becaufe the Lord and Reafon\nditl:ate it; the Lord teacheth it in thefc vVords, \"TYo\nunto you, Hypocrites, for ye make deem the Ou!fidc of\nthe Cup and of the Platter, but 'l;_\u00b7ithin they arefull\nof Extortion .and E:wfs: 'Thou blind Pbar!fee, clcai7ft\n.fidt the lr!fide ofthe Cup and Platter, that the Outjide\nofthem may be clean a!fo,\" Matt. xxiii. 2 5, ~6 : That\nReafon ditl:ates it, is fl1ewn abundantly in the Trea-\ntife on T HE D IVINE LovE MW T H E DrviNE \\VIs-\nDoM : For what the Lord teacheth, he giveth alfo\nto Man to perceive by Reafon ; and this, two \\Vays,\none in that,.he feeth in himfelf that a Thing is io,\nas foon as he heareth it ; the other, in that he un-\nderflandeth it by Reafons ; to fee in himfelf is in\nhis internal 1\\ian, and to underfrand by Reafons i~~\nin his external Man : \\Vho doth not fee in himfelf\nthis Truth, when he hears it declared, that the inter-\nnal Man is fir!l to be purified, and thereby the ex-\nterm.l?

B~t here it \u00b7may be expedient to obferve\nbriefly, how the internal Man is reformed, and\nthereby the external ~ The internal Man is not re~\nformed by knowing, underfl:anding, and being wife\nalone ; confequently not by thinking alone ; but\nby willing that which Knowledge, Intelligence, and\nW ifJom teacheth ; when l\\lan knows, under11ands,\nand hath \\Vifdom to fee, that there are fuch Places\nas Heaven and Hell, and that all Evil is from Hell,\nand all Good from Heaven, if then he willeth not\nEvil becaufe it is from Hell, but wiL~th Good be.,.\nC.t:..de :t is from B eaven, in this Cafe he is in the\nfirft Step of R eformation, and in the Entrance out\nof Bell into Heaven ; when Man advanceth farther,\nClnJ willcth to defift from Evils, he i~ in the fecond\nStep of Reform~tion, and then he is out of Hellt\nb ut not yet in Heaven, which he fceth above him +\n'1 here mufl be this lntemz,J, in Order 'that .!\\fan\nn1ay be reformeJ ; but unlefs both, as well the Ex,.\ntemal as the Internal be reformed, then Man is not\n\u00b7 reformed;\n\f\\\n'THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 205\nreformed; the External is reformed by the Internal~\nwhen the External defifl:s from the Evils, which the\nInternal willerh not, becaufe they are infernal, and\nmore fo when he therefore fhunneth them, and\nfighteth againfl: them ; thus the Internal is to will,\n11nd the External is to do, for unlefs a Perfon doeth\nthat which he wiHeth, within there is a Principle\ntvhich willeth it not, and at length he cometh not\nto wiil it. From thefe few Confiderations it may\nbe fcen, how the external Man is reformed by the\n, internal : This alfo is what is meant by the Lord's\n\\Vonis to Peter, \" Jcfus Jaid, lfI wajb tbee not,\ntbau ha.fl no Part \u00b7witb Me ; Peter faith unto him,\nLord, not my Feet only, but a!Jo my Hands and m\ny .\nHrad: 'Jefus faith to bim, He tbat is -wajbed, need-\neth not, but that his Feet be wafbed, and is clean\nevery wbit,\" John xiii. 8, 9, 1 o : By Wafhing is\nhere meant fpiritual Wafhing, which is purification\nfrom Evils ; by wafhing the Head and Bands is\nmeant to purify the internal Man, and by wa01ing\nthe Feet is meant to purify the external; that when\nthe internal Man is purified, the external is to be\npurified, is meant by thefe vVords, \" H e that is\n\"allied, needeth only that his Feet be wafhed ;\"\nthat all Purification from Evils is from the Lord,\n\\s meant by thefe vVords, \"If I wafl1 thee not, thou\n~afi: no Part with Me.\" That \\Va01ing among the\nJews reprefented Purification from Evils, and !hat\nthis is fignified by vVafhing in the \\Vord, and that\nby wafhing the Feet is fignifieJ the Purification of\nthe natural or external Man, is abundantly fhewn\nin the ARCANA CELESTL\\.\n152 . Forafmuch\n\f206 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\nI 52. Forafmuch as Man hath an Internal and an\nExternal, and both are to be reformed in Order\nthat the Man may be reformed, and forafmuch as\nno one can be reformed, except he explore himfelf,\nfee, and acknowledge his Evils, and afterwards de-\nfifl: from them, it follows, that not only the Exter-\nnal is to be explored, but alfo the Internal ; if the Ex.,\nternal only is explored, Man doth not fee any Thing\nbut what he hath or hat!J. not acrually committed, as\nthat he hath not committed Murder, nor Adultery,\nnor Theft, nor borne falfe Witnefs, &c. ; thus he\nexplores the Evils of his Body, and not the Evils of\nhis Spirit, and yet the Evils of the Spirit are to be \u00b7\nexplored, in Order that any one may be reformed ;\nfor Man lives a Spirit after Death, and all the Evils\nwhich arc in the Spirit remain, and the Spirit is no\nother:\nwife explored, than by Man's attending to his\nThoughts, efpecially to his Intentions, for the Inten-\ntions are Thoughts from the \\ Vill ; in the \\Vill\nEvils are in their Origin and in their Root, that is,\nin their Concupifcences and in their Delights, and\nunlefs they are feen and acknowledged, Maq is f!:ill\nin Evils, notwithfl:anding he may not have commit..\nted them in Externals : That to think from Inten-\ntion, is to will and to do, is evident from the Words\nof the Lord, \" Whofoevcr looketb on a 1-Voman, to ll:ft\nafter her, hath committed Adultery with her already\nin his Heart,\" Matt. v. :28 : Such is the Search of\nthe internal Man, by which the external Man is\neifentially explored.\nI 53\u00b7 I have often wondered, that although the\nwhole Chrifl:ian World is informed, that Evils are\nto be iliunped as Sins, and that otherwife they are\nnot\n\fTnE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 207\nnot remitted,--and that if Sins :>.re not remitted there\nis no Salvation, yet neverthelefs fcarc~ one in a\nthoufand knoweth this ; this was inquired into in\nthe fpiritual \\Vorld, and it was found to be fo ; for\nevery one in the Chrii1ian ,..Vorld is informed here-\nof from the Ptayers re;)d befcre thofe who receive\nthe Holy Supper, it beiag plainly declared therein;\nand yet when they are afked whether they know\nthis, they anfwer that they do not know it, and\nthey did not know it; the Reafon is, becaufe they\ndid not think about it, and moft of them only\nthought of Faith, and of Salvation by Faith alone.\nAnd I have alfo wondered, that Faith alone fo !huts\nthe Eyes, that they who have confirmed themfelve~\nin it, \\vhen they read the Vvord, fee Nothing of\nwhat is there faid of Love, Charity, and Works;\nit is as though they had fmeared over all Things in\nthe \u00b7ward \\vith Faith, as he who fmears a \\Vriting\nover with Paint, whereby not any Thing which is\nunderneath appears, and if any Thing appears, it is\nabforbed by Faith, and faid to be Faith.\nThat\n\f208 AN.GELIC '\"ISDOM ,CONC:CRNlNO\nTlwt it is a Law o\/ tlze Divine Provi-\ndence, tlzat }\/Jan be led and taught of\nthe Lonl out if Heaven, by the rVm-d;\nand by DoElrine and Preaclzings from\nthe Word, and this in all Appearance\nasfrom himje!f.\nl54\u00b7 T~ .A?pea;ar:c~ !VT~n is led .and taught from\nJl hnn:df, but IU I ruth he IS led :ind taught\nof the Lor\u00a31 cnly : They Y\n:ho confirm the Appear-\nance in themfel\\'es, and not at the f1me Time the\nTruth, are not abie to remove Evils as Sins from\nthemfelves; but they who confirm the Appearance)\n;md at the f.:1me Time the Truth in themfelves, are\nable ; for Evils as Sins- are removed in Appearance\nby Man, and in Truth by the Lord ; the latter Perft\nfons can be reformed, but the former cannot. They\nwho confirm Appearance, and not at the fame Time\nTruth in rhemfelves, are all interior Idolators, for\nthey are Worfhippers of Self and the \\Vorld ; if\nthey have no Religion, they become \\Vorfhippers\nof Nature, and fo Atheifrs; but if they have any\nReligion, they become '\\\u00a5orfhippers of Men, and at..\nthe fame Time of Images ; thefe are they who are\nmeant in the firfr Commandment of the Decal0gue,\nwho worfhip other Gods; but they who confirm in\nthemfelves Appearance, and at the fame Time\nTruth, become \\Vorfhippers of the Lord, for the\nLord elevates them from their Proprium, (own prop-\ner Life) which is principled in Appearance, <md\nleadeth\n\fleadeth them into Light, in which the Truth is, and\nwhich is the Truth, and giveth them to perceive\ninteriorly, that they are not led and taught of them-\u00b7\nfelves, but of the Lord. 'fhe rational (Faculty) of\nboth thefe may appear h) many as :1like, but it i::;\ndiffimilar ; the rational Faculty of thofc who are\nprincipled in Appearance, and at the fame Time in\nthe Truth, is a fpiritual Ratioml; but the rational\nFaculty of thofe, who arc principled in .Appearance,\nnnd not at the fame Time in the Trmh, is a natUral\nRational ; this latter ratio:1:1l Faculty may be com-\npared to a Garden, fuch as it is in th~ Light of\n\\Vinter; whereas the fpiritual rational Faculty may\nbe compared to a Garden, fuch as it is in the Light\nof Spring. But of this, mo1\u00b7e in what hllows, in\nthis Order. I. That Man is led and taught of the\nLord only. ll. That Man is led and taught of the\nLord alone through the Angelic Heaven and out of\nit. III. That l\\1an is led of the Lord by Inilux, and\ntaught by Illumination. IV. That Man is taught of\nthe Lotd by the Vvord, and by DoCl:rine and Preach~\nings from the Word, therefore immediately by Him\na1one. V. That Man is led and taught of the Lord\nin Externals to all Appearance as of himfelf.\nISS\u00b7 I. That J.\\!Ian is led and taught of the Lord\nonly : This flows, as an univerfal Confequence,\nfrom all that was !he'.vn in the Treatifc concerning\nTHE DIVINE LovE 'B:D n-m D1v1N.E \\Vrsno;:...t;\nas well from what is there demonflrated concerning\nthe Divine Love of the Lord and his Divine Wif-\ndom in Part the Firft; as concerning the .Sun of\nthe fpiritual \\Vorld, and the Sun of the natural\nWorld, in Part the Second ; alfo concerning De-\nC c I\n\f210 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\ngrees in Part the Third ; and concerning the Crea~\ntion of the Univerfe, in Part the Fourth; as alfo,\nconcerning the Creation of Man, in Part the Fifth.\nI s6. The Reafon why Man is led and taught of\nthe I~orJ only, is, becaufe he liveth from the Lord\nonly, fc':- the \\Viii of his Life is led, and rhe Uncler-\nflanding of his Life is taught: This, however, is\ncontrary to Appearance, for it appears to Man as\nif he lived from himfelf, and yet the Truth is, that\nhe liveth from tl:e Lord, and not from himfelf:\nNow forafmuch as there cannot be given to Man,\nfo long as he is in the \\Vorld, a Perception of Sen-\nfation that he liveth from the Lord only, becaufe the\nA ppearancc that he liveth from himfelf is not tak-\nen away frf)rn him (for without it Man is not Man}\ntherd\"ore this muft be evinced by Reafons, which\nmllft afterwards be confirmed by Experience, and\nlafily by the Vvord.\nIS7\u00b7 That i\\1an liveth from the Lord only, and\nnot from himfelf, may be evinced by thefe Reafons ;\nthat there is one only}]fence, one only Subfiance,\nand one only Form, from \\\\ hich ::tre all the Effenccs,\nSubfiances, and Forms, \\\\<hlch are created: That\none only .Effence, Subflance, and Form, is the Di-\nvine Love and the Pivine \\Vifdom, from which are\nall Things, which have Relation to Love and \\Vif-\ndom in Man : That morco\\\u00b7cr it is Good itfelf and\nTruth itfelf; to which all Things haYe Relation :\nAnd that this is Life, from \\vhich is the Life of All,\nanJ all Things of Life : Alfo that the Self-fubfifl:ing\nand Sole-fubfif1:ing Principle (Unicum tt Ipfum) is\nOmniprefent, Omnifcient, and Omnipotent. .i}nd\nthat this Self.fubfifiing and Sole-fubfifiing Pri!l~iple\nlS\n\fTun DrvrNE PROVIDENCE. 2 r r\ni-s the Lord from Eternity, or Jehovah.

VJ\"hat can exifl: \\Vithout an Effe, [a Being] and\nv:hat is that Effe from which all Effe is, but Effe It-\nfelf, and that which is Eile itfelf, is alfo the Sole Ef-\nfe, and in itfelf Effe : This being the Cafe, and e\\'-\nery one perceiving and acknowledging this from\nReafon, or at lea(l, being capable of perceiving and\n~cknowledging it, what elfe t~1en follows, than that\nthis Effe, which is the Divine itfelf, which is Jeho-\nnh, is All in all Things which are and exifl: ? It is\nthe fame Thing if it be faid, that there is one fole\nSubfl:ance, from which all Things are; and foraf.\nmuch as a Subfl:ance without a Form is not any\nThing, it follows alfo, that there is one fole Form,\nfrom which all Things are. That t!Je Sun of the\nAngelic He<Jsen is that fole Subfl:ance and Form;\nalfo how that E!fence, Subfl:ance, and Form, i~ va-\nried in Things. created, is demonfi:rated in the\nabove\u00b7mentioned\n\fZI2 ANGELIC 'VISDO~I CONCERNING\nabove-mentioned Treatife. SEcoNDLY, That that\none only E.iJ\"If.'1Ce, Su!!flance, and\"\"Form, is the Divinl!\nLove and the Divine W!fr.!om; from which all Things\nare, <:ohich ha'Ve Relation to Love and Wifdom in A1an,\nis alfo fully fhe\\m in the Treatife on THE DnTNE\nl,ovE AND THE DIVINE \\VISDOM; V\\'hatfoever\nThings in Man appear to live, have Relation to the\n... Will and the Underftanding in him ; and that thefe\ntwo Principles confiitute his Life, every one from\nReafon perceives and acknowledges ; why elfe is it\nfo confianrly faid, I will this or I undertland this, or\nI love this or I think this? And whereas l\\lan will~\neth \\vhat he loveth, and thinketh what he under.,\nfiandeth, therefore all Things of the \\Vill have Re-\nlation to Love, and all Things of the Underfiand~\ning to \\Vifdom: And forafmuch as thefe two Prin~\nciples cannot exifl: in any one from himfelf, but from\nHim who is Love itfelf and Vfifdom itfelf, it follows,\nthat it is from thtt Lord from Eternity or Jehovah;\nif this were not the Origin of thofe Principles, Man\nwould be LoYe itfclf and 'Wifdom itfelf, therefon~\nGod from Eternity, at which human Reafon itfelf\nis fl:ruck with Horror. Can any Thing exifi but\nfrom what is prior to itfelf, and can this Prior exifl\nbut from what is frill prior to it, and thus finally\nfrom the Firfi:, which is in itfelf? THIRDLY: !1:\nlike Nlanner, that it is Good it\/elfand Trutb itfe!f, ta\nwhich all 'I'bings bave Relation. It is receiYed and\nacknowledged by every one who hath Reafon, that\nGod is Good itfelf ;:.,nd Truth itfelf, alfo that every\nThing good and true is from Him ; therefore alfo\nthat what is good and true cannot come from any\nother Source than from Good or Goodnefs and\nTruth\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 213\n- \u2022rruth itfelf; thefe Things are acknowledged by ev.\nery rational Man as foon as they are heard : vVhen\nit is next faid, that all of the \\Vill and Underfl:and.\ning, or all of Lo~e and \"\\.\nVifdom, or all of AffeCtion\nand Thought, with the Man who is led of the Lord,\nhath Relation to Good and Truth, it follows, that\nall which fuch l\\hn willeth and underftandeth, or\nwhich he lovcth and is wife in, or by w}1ich he is\naffeB:ed and which he thinketh, is from the Lord:\nHence it is, that every one in the Church knO\\veth,\nthat every Thing good and every Thing true from\nMan in itfelf is not good and ttue, but only that\nwhich is from the Lord. Forafmuch as this is a\nTruth, it follows, that all that which fuch a Man\nwilleth and thinketh, is from the Lord. That neirher\ncan any wicked Man will and think from any other\nOrigin, will be feen in what follows. FouRTHLY,\nThat thofe Principles are Life;from which is the Life\nifAll, and all 'Things ofLife, is abundantly ihe\\vn in\nthe Treatife on THE DIVINE LovE AND TnE Dr.\nVINE vVISDOM. Human Reafon alfo, at the firfi:\nHearing, receives and acknowledges, that all the\nLife of Man is of his 'Will and Underftanding, for\nif the Will and Underfl:anding be taken away, he\ndoth not live; or, what is the fame, that all rhe Life\nof Man is of his Love and his Thought, for if Love\n;~nd Thought be taken away, he doth not live: Now\nforafmuch as the All of the \\Vill and Underfl:anding,\nor the All of Love and Thought in Man is from 'the\nLord, as was faid above, it follows, that the i\\ll of\nLife is from Him. FIFTHLY, 'That this Se!fful!f'iJl\u00b7\n-jng and Solefulftjfing Principle is Omniprefent, Omni-\nJcient, and Omnipotent; this alfo every Chrifl:ian ac.\nkno\\vledges\n\f214 ANGELIC 'VISDOM CONCERNING\nk~lo-.-deJgcs from his DoCtrine, and every Gentile\nfrom his Religion ; hence alfo, every one, in what-\nfoever Place he is, thinks that God is where he is,\nand prays to God as prefent ; and fince every one fo\nthinketh, and fo prayeth, it follows, that they cannot\nthink otherwife than that God is every where, them-\nfore Omniprefent : In like Manner that he is Omnip-\notent and Omnifcient; wherefore every one praying ,\nto God implores from his Heart, that He would lead\nhim, becaufe He is able to do fo: Thus e\\\u00b7ery one ac~\nknowledges at fuch Time the DiYine Omniprefence,\nOmnifcience, and Omnipotence; he acknowledgcth,\nbecaufe he then turns his Face to the Lord, and then\nfrom Him floweth that Truth. SrxTHLY, That\nthis Se!ffulf!fting and Solefulffting Principle is the\nLord from Eternity, or 'Jebovah : In T HE Doc-\nTRINE OF THE NEW jERUSALEM CONCERIHNG\nTHE LoRD, it is fhewn, that God is One in Effence\nand Perfon, and that that God is the Lord, and\nthat the Divine [Principle] itfelf, which is called\nJehm\u00b7ah the Father, is the Lord from Eternity, and\nthat the Human Divine [Principle] is the Son con\u00b7\nceived by his Divine from Eterniry, and born in the\n\\Vorld ; and that the Pro::ecding Divine [Principle]\nis the Holy Ghofl:. It is faid Self-fubfi !ling [Ipfum]\nand Sole-fubt!fl:ing, becaufe it was faid before, that\nthe Lord from Eternity or Jehovah is Self-fubfifl:ing\nLife, (Life itfelf) as being Love itfelf and \\Vifdom\nitfelf, or Goodnefs itfelf and Truth itfelf, from which\nall Things are. That the Lord out of Himfelf cre-\nated all Things, and not out of Nothing, may be\nfeen in the Treatife on Tn.t DIVI:t\\E LovE AND\n'riiE DIVINE \\VrsDoM, n. 282 to ::84, n. 349 to\n357\u00b7\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. (lIS\n357\u00b7 By the above Confiderations, this Truth,\nthat ;vian is led and taught of the Lord al~ne, is con-\nfirmed by Reafons.\n158. This fame Truth is confirmed, not only by\nRealons, but alfo by living Perceptions among the\nAngels, efpecially the Angels of the Third Heav-\nen ; thefe perceive the Influx of Divine Love and\nDivine Wifdom from the Lord; and inafmuch\nas they perceive it, and from their \\VifJom know\nthat the!e Principles are Life, therefore they fay\nthat they live from the Lord, and not from them-\nfelves; and this they not only fay, but alfo love and\ndefire that it may be fo: Neverthelefs they are fl:ill in\nall Appearance, as if they lived from themfelves, yea\nin a ftronger Appearance than other Angels, for, as\nwas fhewn above, n. 42 to 45, in Proportion as any\none is more nearly conjoined to the Lord, in thefame Pro-\nportion he appcarcth to hin!ft!fmore dfftinaly to be his\no'Wn, and perceivet!J more cvidtntly that he is tbe\nLord's. It hat been given me alfo to be in a fimi-\nlar Perception and Appearance, now for many\nYears, from which I am fully convinced, that I\nneither will nor tb!nk any Thing from myfelf, but\nthat it appears as from myfelf; and it is alio givca\nto defire and love this. The fame may be confirm-\ned by many other Confiderations from the fpiritual\n\\Vorld, hut thefe two may fuffice for the Time.\n159\u00b7 That the Lord alone hath Life, is evident\nfrom thefe Paifages in the \\Vord, ': I am the Rifur-\nreflion and the Life; he that belie\u2022veth in Me, though\nhe were dead, yetJha!l he \/i\u2022ve,\" John xi. 2 5\u00b7 \"I am\nthe VVay, and the 'Truth, and the Life,\" John xiv. 6:\n~'God was the Word, in Him was Life, and tbe Life\nwa.r\n\f216 ANGELIC \\VrsooM CONCERNING\nr;uas the Light of Men,\" John i. r, and 4\u00b7 Th<!\n\\Yord there is the Lord. \"As the Father bath Lift\nin Hin!felf, fo !Je hath given to the Son to ha've L!fe hz\nHin!fe{f,\" John v. 26. That Man is led and taught\nof the Lord only, is evident from thefe Paffages,\n~'Without Me ye can do Nothing,\" John xv. 5\u00b7\n\"Man cannot take any Thing, unlefs it be given him\nfrom Heaven,\" John iii. 27. \"Man cmmot make one\nHair white or black,\" Matt. v. 36; by :t Hair in\ntht: \\Vord js fignified the leafl: of all Things.\n16o. That the Life of the wicked is from the fame\nOrigin, will be demonfl:rated hereafter in its proper-\nArticle; we :fhail here only illufhate it by Compari..\nfon; from the Sun of the World flows Heat ahd\nLight, and enters by Influx as well into Trees which\nbear evil Fruit, as into Trees which bear good Fruit,\nand they vegetate and grow alike; the Forms, into\nwhich the Heat enters by Influx, caufe that Differ~\nence, but not the Heat in itfelf. It is the fame with\nLight, this is variegated in Colours ~cording to the\nForms, into which it enters by lnffux; there are\n,beautiful and lively Colours, and there are ugly and\ndull Colours, but flill the Light is the fame. It is\nthe fame with the Influx of fpiritual Heat which in\nitfelf is Love, and of fpiritual Light which in itfelf is\n\\Vifdom, from the Sun of the fpiritual \\Vorld ; the\nForms, into which they enter by Influx, make the\nDifference, but not that Heat which is Lo\\'e, and\nthat Light which is \\Vifdom, in itfelf: The Forms\ninto which they flow, are human l\\1inds. From\ntbefe Confiderations then it is evident, that Man is\nled and taught of the Lord alone.\n161. But\n\fTHE Dr\\TINE PRoVIDENcE. 217\n16x. But what the Life of Animals is, was fhewn\nabove, namely, that it is a Life of Affection merely\nnatural with its concomitant Science ; anJ that it i3\na mediate Life correfponding to the Life of thofe\nwhich are in the fpiritual World.\n162. II. That lvlan is led and taught of the Lord\nalone, through the Angelic Heaven and out ofit; it is\nfaid that Man is led of the Lord through the Angelic\nHeaven, and out of it; but that it is through the An\u00b7\ngelic Heaven, is from Appearance, ~\u00b7hereas that it is\nout of it, is from the Truth: \u00b7The Reafon why there\nis an Appearance that it is through the Angelic Heav-\nen, is, becaufe the Lord appeareth above that Heaven\nas the Sun : The Reafon why it is the Truth, that\nit is out of that Heaven, is becaufe the Lord in that\nHeaven is as the Soul in a Man; for the Lord is\nOmniprefent, and is not in Space, as was fhewn be-\nfore, wherefore Difl:ance is an Appearance accord-\ning to Conjuntlion with Him, and Conjuntlion is\naccording to the Reception 6f Love and \\Vifdom\nfrom Him : And forafmuch as no one can be con-\njoined to the Lord, as he is in Hirnfelf, therefore he\nappeareth to the Angels at a Difl:ance as a Sun:\nNeverthdefs He is in the univerfal Angelic Heaven,\nlike the Soul in a l\\Ja:1 ; and in like l\\'lanner in eve:.\nry Society of Heaven, and in like Manner in every\nAngel there ; for the Soul of a :'.Jan is nat only the\nSoul of the W~olc, but alfo of each Part. But\nwhereas it is from Appearance that the Lord ruleth\nthe univerfal Heaven, and through it the \u00b7 \\Vorld\nfrom the Sun which is from Him, and in which He\nis, concerning which Sun fee the Trec..tife on THE\nDrvr~~E\u00b7 Lov.\u00a3 AND THE DIVINE \\VIsDoM, Part\nD D the\n\f21 S ANGELic WisDoM coNcERN1NC\nthe Second ; and whereas it is allowable for any\nMan to fpeak from Appearance, neither can he do\nothenvife, therefore it is allowable for any one, who\nis not principled in Wifdom itfelf, .to think, that the\nI.ord ruleth all and every Thing out of his Sun, and\nalfo that he ruleth the \\Vorld through the Angelic\nHeaven; from fuch Appearance alfo the Angels of\nthe inferior Heavens think ; but the Angels of the\nfuperior Heavens do indeed fpeak from Appearance,\ncut they think from the Truth, which is that the\nLord ruleth the Univerfe out of the Angelic H eav-\nen, which is out of Himfelf. That the Simple and\nthe \\:Vife fpeak alike, but do not think alike, may be\nilluflrated from the Sun of the \\Vorld; of this Sun\nall Men fpeak from Appearance, as that it rifes and ,\nfets, but the \u00b7wife, although they fpeak in like Man-\nner, flill think that it flands immoveable, which alfo\nis the Truth, and the other \\Vay of conceiving it is:\nan Appearance. The fame may alfo be illufhated\nfrom Appearances in the fpiritual \\Vorld, for in that\nWorld there appear Spaces\u00b7 and Difhmces as in the\u00b7\nnatural \\Vorld, but flill they are Appearances ac-\ncording to the Diilimilitude of AffeD:ions and qf\nThoughts thence derived. It is the fame with the\u00b7\nAppearance of the Lord in his Sun.\n163. But how the Lord leadeth and teachetfl\nevery Man out of the Angelic Heaven, fhll briefly\nbe explained ; in the Treatife on THE DIVINE\nLoV'E AND THE DiviNE WrsnoM, and above in\n~his Treatife on THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE ; alfo\nin the Work on HEAVEN AND HELL, publifhed in\nLondon in the Year 1758, from Things feen and\nheard it is made known, that the univerfal Angelic\nHeaven\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. ZI9\nHeaven appears before the Lord as one Man, and\nin like Manner each Society in Heaven, 'and that\nthence it is, that each particular Angel and Spirit is\nin a perfecr human Form; and moreover in the\nabovenamed Treatjfes it is fhewn, that Heaven is\nnot Heaven from the Proprium [own proper Life]\nof the Angels, but from the Reception of Divine\nLove and Divine Wifdom from the Lord by the\nAngels: Hence it may appear, that the Lord ruleth\nthe univerfal Angelic Heaven as one Man; and that\nthat Heaven, inafmuch as it is a 1\\'lan, is the very\nImage and Lik..enefs of the Lord ; and that the\nLord Himfelf ruleth th~t Heaven, as the Soul\nruleth it5 Body. And forafm.uch as. the univerfal\nhuman Race is ruled by the Lord, that it is not\nruled through Heaven, but out of Heaven by tlle\nLord, confequently out of Himfclt~ becaufe lie\nflimfelf is Heaven, as was faid.\n16+ But forafmuch as this is an Arcanum of\n.Angelic \\Vifdom, it cannot be comprehended by a\n.Man, except he be o!le whofe fpiritual Mind is\nopened, for fuch a Man, by Virtue of ConjunCtion\nwith the Lord, is an Angel ; and by fuch an one,\nfrom what hath been premifed, the following Par-\nticulars may be comprehended. 1. That all, as\nwell Men as Angels, are in the Lord, and the Lord\nin them, according to Conjunerion with Him. z.\nThat every one of thefe hath his Place appointed in\nth-: Lord, therefore in Heaven, according to the\n~ality of ConjunCtion or-Reception of Him. 3\u00b7\nThat every one in his Place hath his State difi:inet\nfrom the State of others ; and that from the con~~\nman (Body or Principle) he deriveth his Tafk ac.\ncardin~\n\f,I\n220 ANG!LIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\ncording to his Situation, his Funtl:ion, and his Necef..\nfity, altogether' like any particular Part or Organ in\nthe human Body. 4\u00b7 That every Man is initiated\ninto his Place by the Lord according to h1s Life,\n5\u00b7 That every Man from Infancy is introduced into\nthat Divine Man, whofe Soul and Life the Lord is,\nand that he is led and taught out of his Divine\nLove according to his Divine \\Vifdom, in Him and\nnot out of Him. But inafmuch as Liberty is not\ntaken away from Man, that Man cannot otherwif~\nbe led and t~ught, than according to Reception as\nif from himfelf. 6. That they who receive, through\ninfinii:e Windings and Meanderings, as it were, are\ncondutl:ed to their Places, nearly as the Chyle is\nconveyed through the Mefentery and latl:eal Veffels\nthere into its Receptacle, and from thence through\nthe Thoracic DuB: into the Blood, and fo into its\nproper Place. 7\u00b7 That they who do not receive,\nare feparateJ from thofe who are within the Divine\nMan, as the Excrement and Urine are fecreted and\nfeparated by Man. Thefe are Arcana of A..\n1gelic\nWifdom~ which may in fome Meafurc be compre..\nhended by l\\'Ian, but there <1re many which cannot.\n165. III. 'That :Man is fed of the Lord by Influx,\n(lnd taught by Illumination. The Reafon why Man\nis led of the Lord by Influx, is, becaufe to be led,\n:mu alfo to enter by Influx,.are predicated of Lo\\\u00b7e\nand of the vVill; and the Reafon why Man is\ntaught of the Lord by Illumination, is, becaufe to\nbe taught and to be illuminated are predicated prop-\nerly of Wifdom and of the Underfianding : That\nn ery l\\'lan is led from his own Love of himfelf,\n;111d according to it by others, and not from the\n\u00b7 l]nderflandingJ\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENC_l!. 22 I\nVnderll:anding, is well known ; he is led by the\nUnderfl:anding and according to it, only when the\nLove or the Will maketh the Underfl:anding; and\nwhen this is the Cafe, it may alfo be faid of the Un-\nderfl:anding that it is led, but yet the Underil:anding\nin this Cafe is not led, but the \\Vill from which it\nis derived. It is called Influx, becaufe it is a cuf-\ntomary Way of fpeaking to fay, that the Soul flows\ninto or operates by Influx upon the Body, and that\nInflux is fpiritual and not phyfical, and the Soul\nor Life of Man is his Love or \\:Vill, as was fhewn\nabove ; alfo becaufe Influx is comparatively like\nthe Influx of the Blood into the Heart, and out\nof the Heart into the Lungs ; that there is a Cor-\nrefpondence of the Heart with the Will, and of the\nLungs with the Underfl:anding, and that the Con-\njunCtion of the Will with the Underftanding is like\nthe lnflux of the Blood out of the Heart into the\nLungs, is fhewn in the Treatife on THE D1vn1E\nLovE AND THE DIVINE \\:VIsl:loM, n. 37 r to 432.\n166. But the Reafon why Man is taught by\nIllumination, is, becaufe to be taught and alfo to\nbe illuminated are predicated of the Underfl:anding,\nfor the Underftanding, which is the internal Sight\nof Man, is no otherwife illuminated by fpiritual\nLight, than as the Eye or external Sight of Man i~\nby natural Light ; in like Manner alfo both are\ntaught, but the internal Sight, which is of the Un-\nderil:anding, by fpiritual Objects, and the external\nSight, which i~; of the Eye, by natural ObjeCts.\nThere is fpiritual Light and natural Liciht, both as\nto external Appearance alike, but as to internal un-\nlike, for natural Light is from the Sun of the natu\"\nral\n\fZ2Z. ANGELIC ,VISDOI\\'1 CONCERNING\nral World, and thence in itfelf is void of Life,\nwhereas fpiritual Light is from th~ S.un of the fpir..\nitual World, and thence in itfelf is living ; this lafl\nilluminates the human Underfl:anding, and not\nnatural Light : Natural and rational Illumination\n[Lumen] is not from the latter Light, but from the\nformer ; it is called natural and rational lllumina..\ntion, becaufe it is fpiritual-natural ; for there are\nthree Degrees pf Light in the fpiritual V\/orld,\ncele!l:ial Light, fpiritual Light, and fpiritual~natural\nLight; cele!l:ial Light is a ruddy flaming Light,\nthis Light they have who are in the third Heaven ;\nfpiritual Light is a white fhining Light, this Light \u00b7\nthey have who are in the middle Heaven ; and\nfpiritual-natural Light is fuch as the Light of Day\nis in our \\Vorld, thi~ Light they have who a:re in\nthe ultimate Heaven, and alfo they who are in the\nVvorld of Spirits, which is the miQ.dle between\nHeaven and Hell ; but this Light, 'in the latter\n\\Vorld, is with the good like the Light of Sum..\nmer, and with the wicked like the Light of 'Winter\nupon Ear~h. But it is to be noted, that all the\nLight of the fpiritual World hath Nothing in com..\nman with the Light of the natural World; they\nare as different as Life and Death. From which it\nis evident, that natural Light, fuch as we have be-.\nfore our Eyes, doth not illuminate the Underfl:and..\ning, but fpiritual Light. Man is ignorant of this,\nbecaufe heretofore he knew Nothing of fpiritual\nLight. That fpiritual Light is in its Origin Divine\n\\Vifdom, or Divine Truth, is !hewn in tJie \\Vork\non H.\u00a3AVEN AN:O I-Inr., n. 126 to 140.\n167. Forafmuch\n\fTHE DIVINE i>ROV'IDENCli.\n167. Forafmuch as the Light of Heaven hath'\nnow been fpoken of, it may be expedient to fay\nSomething alfo of the Light of Hell : Light in Hell\nis alfo of three Degrees ; the Light in the lowefr -\u00b7\nHell is like the Light of burning Coals ; the Light\nin the middle Hell is like the Light from the Flame\nof a \\Vood Fire ; and the Light in the highefr Hetl\nis like the Light of Candles, and to fome like the\nLight of the Moon by Night. Neither are thcfe\nLights natural, but they are fpiritual, for all natural\nLight is dead, and extinguifhcth the Underfianding,\nand they who are in Hell, have the Faculty of Un~\nderfiaqding, which is called Rationality, as was\nfhevm before, and Rationality itfelf is from fpiritual\nLight, and not in the leafl: from natural Light ; <:.ncl\nthe fpiritual Light which they have from Rationali-\nty, is turned into infernal Light, as the Light of\nDay into the Darknefs of Night. But yet all who\nare in the fpiritual Vvorld, as well they in the HeaY~\nens, as they in the Hells, fee in their own Light as\nclearly as Man doth by Day in his ; the Reafon is7\nbecaufe the Eye of every one is formed for the Re\u00b7\nception of the Light in which he is ; therefore the\nEyes of the Angels of Heaven for the Reception of\nthe Light in which they are, and the Eyes of the\nSpirits of Hell fo; the Reception of their Light ;\nwith thefe it is comparatively as with Owls and\nBats, which fee Objecrs as clearly in the Night as\nother Birds fee them in the Day; for their Eyes\nare formed for the Reception of their own Light.\nBut the Difference between thefc Lights appears\nclearly to thofe who look out of one Light into\n.another; as when an Angel of Heaven looks into\nHell_\n\f224 ANGE-LIC WISDOM CONCERNING\nHell, he fees Nothing but mere Darknefs there ;\nand when a Spirit of Hell looks into Heaven, he\nfees Nothing but Darknefs there ; the Reafon is;\nbecaufe cele\u00a3l:ial Wifdom is to thofe who are in Hell\nas Darknefs, and on the other Hand infernal Infan\u2022\nity is to thofe who are in Heaven as Darknefs.\nHence it may appear, that fuch as a Man's Under~\nfi:mding is, fuch is his Light, and that every one\ncometh into his own Light after Death, for he doth\nnot fee in any other; and in the fpiritual World,\nwhere all arc fp:rilual even as to their Bodies, the\nEyes of all ~reformed to fee from their own Light;\nthe Life's Love of every one maketh to itfelf an Un-\nJ erfianding, and fo alfo a Light ; for Love is as the\nFire of Life, from which is the Light of Life.\n168. Forafmuch,as few know any Thing of the\nIllumination, in which the Underfianding of Man\nis, who is taught of the Lord, therefore Something'\nfhall be faid of it. There is Illumination from the\nLord interior and exterior, and there is Illumina-\ntion from Man alfo interior and exterior : Interior\nIllumination from the Lord is, when a Man at firfl:\nhearing perceiveth whether that which is faid be\ntrue or not true ; exterior Illumination is derh\u00b7ed\nthence in the Thought : Interior Illumination from\nMan is from Confirmation alone ; and exterior\nIllumination from Man is from Science alone ; but.\nto fpeak of each more particularly. A rational\nMan by interior Illumination from the Lord immedi-\nately perceiveth, when he hears Things faid, wheth-\ner they are true or not true ; as for Example; when\nit is faid that Love is the Life of Faith, or that\nFaith liveth from Love ; a Man from interior lllu.\nmination\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. Z-25\nruination alfo perceiveth this, that \\vhatfocver a\nMan loves that he willcth, and what he willcth that\nhe doeth, and confequently that to love is to do :\nAlfo he perceives this, that whatfoevcr a Man belicv~\neth from Love, that alfo hewilleth and doeth,and con~\nfequently; that to have Faith is alfo to do ; likewifc,\nthat an impious Man cannot have the Love of God,\ntherefore neither the Faith of God. A rational Man\nalfo;from interior Illumination,when he hears, imme~\ndiately perceiveth the following Truths; That God is\none : That he is Omniprefent : That every Good\nis from him : Alfo, that all Things have R.elatiOii\nto Goodnefs and Truth ; anq that every goo.d\nThing is from Goodnefs itfelf, and e\\,ery Thing\ntrue from Truth itfelf. _ Thefe, and other fuch like\nTruths; 1\\lan petceiveth interiorly in himfelf, when\nhe . heareth them; the Reafon why he petceiveth;\nis, becai.tfe he hath Rationaiity, and this is in the\nLight of Heaven which illuminates. Exterior Il\/u:.\nmination is Illumination of the Thought derived\nfrom interior Illumination, and the Thought is fo\nfar in il!uminat_ion as it remaineth in the Perception\nwhich it hath from interior Illumination, and \u00b7as it\nhath at the fame Time Knowledges of Things true\nand good, for from thcfe it fupplies itfelf with Rea~\nfdnli for Confirmation. The Thought, by Virtue\nof this exterior Illumination, feeth a Thin~ on both\nSides, on one Side it feeth the Reafons which con-\nfirm it, on the other Side it feeth the Appearances\nwhich invalidate it, the latter it difpelleth, the form*\ner it colletl:eth. But interior Illumination from Man,\nis totally different ; a Man, by Virtue of this Illumi-\n- nation, feeth a Thing on one Side, and not on the\nE E other,\n\f226 ANGELIC \\VISDO.M CONCERNING\nother, and when he hath confirmed it, he feeth it\nin a Light fimilar, as to Appearance, to the Light\ntreated of above, but it is the Light of \\Vinter : As.\nfor Example; a Judge, who : in Confequence of\nBribes, and for the Sake of Interefl:, judgeth unjufi-\nly, after he hath confirmed his Judgment by the\nLaws and by Reafons, doth not fee any Thing but\nJufl:ice in his Judgment ; fome fee Injufl:ice, but be-.\ncaufe they do not defire to fee it, they darken and\nblind themfelves, and fo do not fee it : It is the fame\nwith a Judge, who pafTeth Judgment under the In-\nfluence of Friendfhip, from the Defire of concilia-\nting Favour, and from the Influence of Connexions.\n'With Perfons of fuch a Charatl:er, the fame Thing\nhappens in Refpetl: to whatever they receive from\nthe Mouth of a Man of Authority, or from a Man\nof Reputation or Fame, or in Refpea to whatever\nthey have hatched out of their own Self-derived\nIntelligence ; They are blind Reafoners, for their\nSight is grounded in falfe Principles, which they\nconfirm, and what is Falfe dofeth up the Sight,\nand Truth openeth it. Such Perfons do not fee\nany Truth from the Light of Truth, nor any Thing\njufl: from the Love of Jufl:ice, but from the Light\nof Confirmation, which is infatuating Light ; they\nappear in the fpiritual \\Vorld like Faces without a\nHead, or like Faces fimilar to human Faces, behind \u2022\nwhich there are Heads 0f Wood, and they are call-\ned .rational Beafl:s, [ Pecudes] becaufe they have Ra-\ntionality in their Power. But t',\\\"terior J\/luminatior.\nfrom Man, hath Place with thofe who think and\nfpeak from'Science alone imprelfed upon the Mem.\nory ~\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 227\ncry ; thefe from themfelves arc but little able to\nconfirm any Thing~\n169. Such are the Differences of Illumination\n:md thence of Perception and Thought ; there is\n~n aCl:ual Illumination from fpiritual Light, but the\nIllumination itfelf from that Light doth not appear\nto any one in. the natural World, becaufe. natural\nLight hath Nothing in common with fpiritual Light:\nThis Illumination hath fometimes appeared to me\nin the fpiritual \\Vorld, being feen about thofe who\nwere in Illumination from the Lord, as Something\nluminous about the Head, like a ruddy Light of the\nColour of the human Face [rutilam Colore Facici\nbumance.] But with thofe who are in Illumination\nfrom themfelve\u00a3, there was fuch a luminous Ap-\npearance not about the Head, but about the Mouth\nand above the Chin.\n170. Befides thefe Illuminations there is alfo\nanother Illumination, by which it is revealed to\nMan, in what Faith, and in what Intelligence and\n\\Vifdom he is, which ReYelation is fuch, that he\nhimfelf perceiveth it in himfelf; he is admitted into\na Society, where there is genuine Faith, and where\nthere is true Intelligence and Wifdom, and there\n-his interior Rationality is opened, from which he\nfeeth his Faith, and his Intelligence and Wifdom,\nof what Kind they are, even to the Acknowledg-\nment thereof: I have feen fome returning from\nthence, and I have heard them confefs, that .they\nhad had no Faith, although in the \\VorlJ . they\nthought they had much, and in an eminent D~gree\nabove others ; in like l\\Ianner they confefid r!?fpeCl:~\ning their Intdligcn~ and \\Yifdom : They were fomc\ncf\n\ff28 ANqELic 'VrsnoM ~ON<;ERNING\nof thofe who were principled ~n Faith alone\u00b7, an4\n~n no Charity, and \\Vh9 wer~ ~n Se~f-de:rived In~\ntelligence.\n17 1.

In THn DocTRINE Of THE NEw jERU~\n~ALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE~\nit is fuewn, that the Lord is the \\:Vonl, and that all\nDo8:rine of the Ch~rch is to be drawn out of the\n'\\Vord; now inafmuch as the Lord is the \\Vord,\nit foll~ws, that the Ma1,1 who is taught out of the\nvVord, is taught o~\u00b7 the Lord alone. But becaufe\nthis is difficult to be comprehended, it may be expe4\nclient to illufhate it in this Order. 1.

But this will be clearly d~m.,.\nonfl:rated by Examples in what follows.\n1;8. The Reafon alfo, why ir is not given Man\nto foreknow Events, is, that he may be able to act\nfrom Liberty according to Re4fon; for it is known,\nthat whatfoever ~an loveth, he wH}eth to efFeCt,\nand leadeth himfelf to it by 1\\eafpn ; alfo that there .\nis Nothing that a Man revolveth in, his Reafon,\n\u00b7which is not from his Love that it may cqme into\nEffeCt by Thought ; wherefore if he knew the Ef.,.\nfeet or Event from Divine PrediCtion, Reafon would\nbecome quiefcent, ( acquiefcerct,) and with Reafon\nLove ; for Love with Reafon terminates in the Ef,.\nfeCl:, and .from the EffeCt beginneth anew. It is the\n\\'ery e!femial Delight of Reafon, that from Love in\n'Thought it feeth the EfreCt:, not i1;1 the EffeCt, bu~\nbefore it, or not in the prefent, but in the f1,1ture;\nHence Man hath that which is called HoPE, which\nin Reafon increafeth and dec;:reafeth, as it fees c;\nexpeCts the Event; this Delight is fulfilled in the E.~\nvent, but afterwards is obliterated with the Thought\nconcerning the Event; it would be the fame w!tl;l\nan Event foreknow11. The Mind of Man is contin~\nually in thefe three Principles, which are calle~\nEnd, Caufc, and EffeCt ; if one of thefe is wanting,\nthe human Mind is not in its Life ; the AffeCtion\nof the \\Vill is the End from which, the Thought\nof the Underfl:anding is the Caufe by which, and\nthe ilCl:ion of the Bocly, the Speech of the Mouth,\nor external Senfation, are the EfTetl of the End 't.y\nthe\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. r~,n\n-.);7\nthe Thought : That the 'human Mind is not in its\nLife, when it is only in the AffeB:ion of the \u00b7will,\nand in Nothing_ elfe, and in like Manner when it is\nonly in the EffeB:, is evident to any one ; wherefore\nthe Mind hath not any Life from one of the Princi4\nples feparately, but from the three in 'ConjunB:ion ;\nthis Life of the Mind would be diminiihcd and\nwould recede in a predicted Event.\nI 79\u00b7 Forafmuch as a Foreknowledge ofthc Fu.\n\u2022 ture takes away the effential hum:m Principle, which\nconfifrs in aB:ing from Liberty according to Reafon,\ntherefore it is not given to any one to know the Fu-\nture, but every one is allowed to conclude concern-\ning Things to come from Reafon, and hence Reafon\nwith aU that appertaineth to it is in its Life ; it is on\nthis Account, that l\\1an doth not know his Lot after\nDeath, or know any Event before he.is in it ; for if\nhe knew, he would no longer think from his interi-\nor Self (interioreJe,) hovJ he ,~:as to att or to live,\nin Order that he may come thereto, but would\nthink onlv from his exterior Self, that it would\nJ\ncome to paf:>, and this latter State clofeth the Inte-\nriors of his Mind, in which the two Faculties of his\nLife, which arc Liberty and Rationalit):, principally\nrefide. The De!lre of foreknowing the Future is\nconnate with mofr People, but this Defire derives\nir Origin from the!

Only take\nin the Body fome common Covering, as for Exam.\nplc the PLEURA, which is the common Covering of\nthe Breafl, or of the Heart and Lungs, and exam.\nine it with an anatomicZtl Eye, or, if you have not\nmade this your particular Study, confult Anatomifls,\nand they will tell you, that this common Covering,\n\u00b7 by various Circumvolutions, and afterwards by\nExfertions or Derivations from itfelf, finer anJ fi.\nner, enters into the inmofl [Subfl:ance] of the\nLungs, even to the fmallefl: bronchial Ramifications,\nand into the Follicles themfelves, which are the Be-\nginnings of the Lungs: Not to mention its Progref~\nfion afterwards by the Trachea to rhe Larynx to~\nwards the Tongue; from which it is evident, that\nG G there\n\fANGELIC \\VrsDO.l\\1 CONCERNING\n\\\nthere is a perpetual Connexion of the Outmoft\nwith the Inmofl:, wherefore as the Outmofl: aCls or\nis aCled upon, fo alfo the Interiors from the lnmofl:\nor Intimates att or are ac:ted upon : And this is the\nReafon, that when that outmofi Covering, which is\nthe Pleura, has either a Defluxion or Inflammation,\nor is full of Ulcers, the Lungs labour from their in-\nmoil: [Parts,] and if the Difeafe increafes, all Ac-\ntion of the L\\mgs ceafes, and the Man dies.

It is the fame with\nthe refl: : The Reafon is, that in every Form, what,\nis common and what is particular, or what is uni-\u00b7\nverfal and what is fingular, by a wonderful Con-\njunCtion aa as one.

'243\nof their State, which have Relation to the Opera.\ntions of the \\Viii and Underfhndirlg, as in natural\nForms and their Operations, which have Relation\nto Motion and Afrion, will be feen below. Now\nforafmuch as Man, in fome external Operations, is\ntogether with the Lord (una cum Domino,) and the\nLiberty of ae1ing according to Reafon is not taken\naway from any one, it follows, that the Lord can.\nnot aCt o'ihcrwife in Internals than as together with\nMan in Externals : \\Vhcrefore if l\\1an doth not fhun\n.and avoid Evils as Sins, the External of the Thought\nand \\Vill muft be vitiated and difeafed, and then at\nthe fame Time their Internal, comparatively like the\nPleura from its Difeafe which is called Pleurify, in\nConfequence of which the Body dies. SECONDLv,\nThat if J..1an was at thefame Time in Internals, he\nwould pervert and dijlroy all tbe Order and Tenor of\nthe Divine Providence : This alfo we fhall illuftrate\nby Examples from the human Body: If Man knew\nall the Operations of both the Brains upon the Fi.\nbres, of the Fibres upon the Mufcles, and of the\nMufcles upon ACtions, :md from a Knowledge there.\nof were to difpofe all Things as he difpofeth Actions,\nwoultl he not pervert and de!hoy all ? If 1\\lan knew\nhow the Stomach digefts, the Vifcera about it per.\nform their Tafk, elaborate the Blood, and diftribute\nit for the Bufinefs of Life, and had the Difpofition\nof the fame as he hath in Externals, as in the Cafe,\nfor Example, of Eating and Drinking, would he not\npervert and deflroy all ? \\Vhen he cannot difpofe\nthe External, which appears as one, but det1roys it\nby Luxury and Intemperance, what then would be\n1he C~fc if he were alfo to Jifpofe Internals, '\"hich\narc\n\f\"\n244 ANGELI~ \\VISDOM CONCEF,Nn;G\nare infinite ? \\~therefore the Internals; left Man by\nany \u00b7will of his ihould enter into them, and make\nthem fubjeCt. to himfelf, are entirely eiempted from\nhis \\Vill, except the Mufcles, which confliture the\nCovering ; and moreover it is not known how thefe\nace, and it is only known that they do aa. It is\nthe fame with the other Parts of the Body, \u00b7as if a\n1\\Ian were to difpofe the Interiors of his Eye to fee,\nthe Interiors of pis Ear to hear, the Interiors of his\nTongue to tafi-e, the Interiors of his Skin to feel~\nthe Interiors \u00b7of his Heart to contraCt:, the Interiors\nof the Lungs to refpire, th~ Interiors of the Mefen:\ntery to dilhibute the Chyle, the Int~riors of th~\nKidneys to f~cret~, the Interiors of the Organs of\nGeneration to propagate,' the Interiors of the \\Vomb\n. '\nto perfeCt: the Embryo~ and fo on, would he not by\ninfinite Meam pervert \u00b7and defi:roy in thefe the Or~\nder of Progrcffion of the Divine Providence ? That\nMan is in Externals, is well known, as that he fees\nwith the Eye, hears with the Ear, tafl:es with the\n'Tongue, feels \\\\ ith the ~kin, refpires with the\nLungs, contributes to Propagation, &c. : Is it not\nenough, that he is acquainted with Externals, and\ndifpofeth them fer the Health of the Body and\nJ\\1ind ? When he cannot do this, what would he do,\nif he were alf~ t~ difpofe Internals ? Hence then it \u00b7\nmay appear, that if Man manife!Hy faw the Divine\nProvidence, he would interfere with the Order and\n'tenor of its Progreffion, and pervert and defi:roy\ni~ . .\nI 8I. The Reafon why it is the fame in the fpir-\nitual Things of the 1'vlind, as in the natural Thing~\n?~the Body, is, becaufe all Things of the Mind cor.\n\u00b7 \u00b7 refllond\n\fTnE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 245\nrefpond to all Things of the Body,\" wherefore alfo\nthe Mind aCtuates the Body in Externals, and in\nThings general [in commu!2i] at its Pleafure ; it ac-\ntuates the Eye to fee, the Ears to hear, the Mouth\nand the Tongue to eat and to dxink, and alfo tC\\\nfpeak, the Hands to do, the Feet to walk, the Or-\ngans of Generation to propagate ; the Mind not\nonly aB:uates the Externals to do thefe \u00b7\u2022.t hings, but\nalfo the Internals in all their Series, the Ultim:1tes\nfrom the Intimates, and the Intimates from the Ul-\ntimates; thus, while it aCl:uates the Mouth to fpeak,\nit aB:uates the Lungs, the Larynx, the Glottis, the\nTongue, the Lips, and each diflinE\\:ly to its Func-\nrion at once, and alfo the Face conformably. \u00b7 Hence\nit is evident, that the fame which was faid of the\nnatural Forms of the Body, may be faid of the fpi-\nritual Forms of the 1\\'lind, and what was faid of the\nnatural Operations of !he Body, may be faid of the\nfpiritual Operation~ of the ~linp ; therefore as Man\n~ifpofeth Externals, the Lord difpofeth Internals, of\n~onfequence, differe~tly if Man of himfclf di~'Jofeth\nExter11al$, ~han if he difpofeth them of the Lord,\nand at the fame Time as if of himfclf. The Mind\nof Man is ~lfo in every Particular of its Form a\nMan, for it i~ his Spi;it, which after Death appcar-\neth a Man altogether as in the \\Vorld ; and confe-\nquently there are fimilar Things in both :, Thus\nwhat was faid of the Conjunction of Externals with\nInternals in the Body~ is alfo to be underflood of\nthe ConjunCl:ion of Externals with Internals in the\nMind ; with this Difference only, that the one is\nnatural and the other fpiritual.\n182.

Thus doth\nthe natural Man fpeak, but not [o the fpiritual Man ;\nthe latter, becaufe he acknovdedges God, acknowl,.\nedges alfo the Divine Providence, and likewife feeth\nit: But he cannot manifefi it to any one who thinks\ncnly in Nature from Nature ; for fuch a one can-\n:.not elevate his Mind above Nature, and fee in the\nAppearances thereof any Thing of the Divine Prov~\nidence, or conclude any Thing concerning it from\nthe Laws of Nature which are \u00b7alfo Laws of the Di-\n' \"ine \\Vifdom ; wherelore if he manifefl:ly faw it,\nhe would infufe it into Nature, and thus not only\nwii it over \\\\ ith Fallacies, but alfo prophane it ;\nand infiead of Acknow!edging it, would deny it,\nand he who denies in his Heart the Divine Provi~\nt1ence, alfo denies God. It muft either be thought\nthat God governs all Things, or Nature ; he who\nthinks that G od governs all Things, thinks that\nthey\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 1-}7\nthey are governed by Love it!elf and Wifdom itfdf,\ntherefore by Life itfelf; but he who thinks that\nNature rrovcrns all Thinr.rs, th!nks that they are\nu l) ...\ngoverned by natural IIcat and natural Light, which\nneverthclcfs in themfdvcs are dead, becaufe they\nare from a dead Sun ; doth not what is really Ji,\u00b7-\ning govern what is Dead, or 'can that \\vhich is dead\ngovern any Thing? If you think that '\\vhat is dead\ncan give itfelf Life, you are infane ; Life mu!l\nneeds be from Life.\nI83. That if Man manifefl:ly f.1w the Divine\nProvidence and its Operation, he woulll deny God,\nappears as not probable, becaufe it feems that if any\none faw it manifefi:ly, he could not but acknowledge\nit, and codequently acknowledge God ; but yet\nit is altogether otherwife. The Divine Providence\nnever aB:s in Unity with the Love of Man's V\/ill,\nbut continually again!t it ; for Man, from his he- '\nreditary Evil, a!ways pants tmvards tl1e lov,:efl HeH,\n'\\vhereas the Lord by his Providence cont;nua!ly\nwith-holdeth him, and draweth him out thence,\nfirfl: to a milder Hell, then from I-Iell, and lafl:ly to\nhimfelf into Heann : This Operation of the Divi:1e\nProvidence is perpetual ; wherefore if Man mani-\nfefl:ly faw this RetraCtion c:nd AbduCtion, he would\nbe an~ry, and account God as his Enemy, ;;:!d from\nthe E vil of hi$ Proprium [ o\u00b7,yn proper Life] would\ndeny him; wherefore left Man fhould know this,\nhe is kept in Liberty, wherr.:by be kno\\vs no other\nthan that he leadeth himfelf. But Examples may\nferve for lllufhation : l\\hn, by hcredit~ry Difpof:-\ntion, defireth to become great, and alfo ddireth to\nbecome rich, and in Proportion as thcfe Lo' es are\nnot\n\f2118 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\n\u2022\nnot refhained, he defireth to be greater and richer;\nand at l~ngth, the greatefl: and richefl: of all ; and\nneither thus would he be quiet, but \\vould defire to\nbecome greater than God himfelf, and to poffefs the\nvery Heaven : This Cupidity lieth deeply concealed\nin hereditary Evil, and thence in l\\lan's Life, and\n:n his Life's Nature. The Divine Providence doth\nnot t~.ke away this Evil in a Moment, for if it were\ntaken away in a Moment, Man would not live ; but\nit is taken away tacitly and fucceffively, without\nMad's knowing any Thing of it ; this is effeCted by\nthis, that it is permitted Man to aCt according to\nthe thought, which he makes the Thought of his\nReafon, and then he is withdrawn by various Means,\nas well rational, as civil and moral, and thus fo far\nas he can be withdrawn in Liberty, he is withdrawn.\nNeither can Evil be taken away from any one, ex-\ncept it appear, be feen, and acknowledged ; it is\nlike a \\Vound which is not healed, except it be\nopened. If therefore Man knew, and faw, that the\nLord by his Divine Providence thus operates againfl:\nhis Life's Love, from which he hath his chief De-\nlight, he could not but run counter to it, and be ex-\nafperated, c6ntend, fay harfh Things, and at length\nout of his own Evil remove the Operation of the\nDi\\'ine ProYidence, by denying it, and thus denying\nGall ; efpeciJlly if he faw his Succcfs oppofed, him-\nfelf call down from Dignity, and deprived of Opu-\nlence. It is however to be obferved, that the Lord\nnever withholdeth Man from feeking after Hon-\nours, and acquiring vVealth, but from the Cupidity\nof feeking after Honours for the Sake of Eminence\nonly, or for the Sah:e of Self; in like Manner from\nacquumg\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 249\nI\nacquiring Wealth for the Sake of Opulence onlr,\nor for the Sake of the \\Vealth ; but when he with-\ndraweth Man from thefe, he inrrodnceth him into\nthe Love of Ufes, that he may refpea Eminence\nnot for the Sake of Self but for the S<1ke of Ufes,\ntherefore that it may be of Ufes and thence of him-\nfelf, and not firfl: of himfelf and thence of Ufes ;\nthe fame is true in Regard to Opulence. That the\nLord continually humbleth the Proud, and exalteth\nthe Humble, He Himfelf teacheth in many Places\nof the \\Vord, and what he there tcacheth, that alfo\nis of his Divine Providence.\n184. The Cafe is the fame with other Evils in.\nwhich Man is principled from hereditary Difpofi-\ntion, as with Adulteries, Ftauds, Revenges, Blaf-\nphemies, and other fuch like, all which can no oth-\nerwife be removed, than by the Liberty of thinking\nand willing them being left, and that fo Man may\nremove them as from himfelf, which neverthelefs\nhe cannot do, unlefs he acknowledges the Divine\nProvidence, and implores that it may be effeCted by\nProvidence : \\Vithout fuch Liberty and the Divine\nProvidence at the fame Time, thofe Evils would be\nlike Poifon fhut in, and not voided, which in a !hart\nTime would fpread and occafion the Death of all\nParts ; and they would be like a Difeafe of the\nHeart itfelf, from which the whole Body in a fhort\nTime dies.\n185\u00b7 That this is the Cafe, cannot better be\nknown than from the Cafe of Men after Death in\nthe fpiritual \\Vorld, where the greatefl: Part of thofe,\nwho in the natural \\Vorld became great and rich,\nand in Honours refpecretl themfelves alone, and alfo\nH a in\n\f250 ANGELIC \\VISDOJ.\\1 CONCERl'~ING\nin Riches, at firfl: fpeak of God, and of the Divine\u00b7\nProvidence, as if they acknowleqged them in their\nHearts : But whereas they then manifefl:ly fee the\nDivine Providence, and from it their final Portion;\nwhich is that they arc to be in Hell, they conne&\nthemfelves with Devils there, and then not only de-\nny God, b~t alfo bbfpheme ; and then they come\ninto fuch a Delirium, that they acknowledge the\nmore powerful of the Devils for their Gods, and\naffeCt Nothing more ardently, than that they them-\u00b7\nfelves alfo may be deified.\n186. The Ground and Reafon why Man would\nrun counter to God, and den.y him alfo, if he man-\nifeflly faw the Operations of his Divine Providence1\nis, becaufe Man is in the Delight of his Love ; and\nthis Delight confi.itctes his very Life ; wherefore\nwhen Man is kept in the Delight of his Life, he is\nin h~s Freedom, fo: Freedom and that Delight\nmake one : In Cafe therefore he perceived, that he\nis continually drawn away from his Delight, he\nwould be exafperated againft him who wanted tu\u00b7\nde!l:roy his Life, and wculd regard him as an Ene-\u00b7\nmy : In Order to guard againfl: this, the Lord doth\u00b7\nnot manife!l:ly appear in his Divine Providence, but\nby it t:lcitly leadeth Man, as an imperceptible Tide\n\u00b7 or profperous Current doth a Ship: By this Means\u00b7\nMan knoketh no other, than that he is confi:antly \u00b7\nin his own Proprium, [or 0\\\\'ll proper LifeJ for\nLiberty maketh one whh this Proprh;m ; hence it\nis evident, that Liberty appropriates to Man that\nwhich the Divine Providence introduces, which\nwould not be the Cafe if the latter manife!l:ed itfelf ~\nTo be appropriated is to become of the Life.\n.187. IV.\n\f\u00b7THE DIVINE PROVIDENCl. 251 I\n1S7. IV. 'l'bat it is given Man to fee tbe Divine\nPro'vidcncc on tbc Back, and not in tbe Face~ a!fo in a\nfpiritual State, and not hz bis ntlfural State : To fee\nthe Divine Providence on the Back and not in the\nFace, is to fee it behind and not before ; and to fee\nit from a fpiritual State, and not from a natural\nState, is to fee it from Heaven and not from the\n'\\Vorld: All they who receive Influx from Heaven,\n:md acknowledge the Divine Providence, ahd efpe\u00b7\ncially they who by Reformation are made fpiritual,\nwhen they fee Events in a certain wonderful Series,\nfrom interior Acknowledgment do as it \u00b7were fee,\nand. confefs a Providence ; thefe do not dcfire to\nfee it in the Face, that i~:, before it exifis, for they\narc afraid lefr their own \\Vill fhould ente: i:1to any\nThing of its Order and Tenor. Not fo they, who\ndo not admit any Influx from Heaven, but oniy\nfrom the \"World, \u00b7efpecially they, who from the\nConfirmation of Appearances in themfelves are\nmade natural ; thefe do not fee any Thing of the\nDivine Providence behind or after it, but they\nwant to fee it in the Face, or before it exifrs ; and\nforafmuch as the Divine Providence operates by\n_. Means, and Means are effecced through Man or\nthrough the World, therefore whether they fee it\nbefore or behind, they attribute it either to Man o:r\u2022\nto Nature, and thus confirm themfdves in the De.\nnial of it. The Reafon why they fo attribute it, is,\nbecaufe their Underfl:anding is fhut above, and only\nopen below, confequently fhut towards Heaven and\nopen towards the V\\.,.orld, :md to fee the Divine\nProvidence from the \\Vorld is not given, but it is\ngiven to fee it from Heaven. I have fometimcs\nthovght\n\f252. ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nthought with myfelf, whether fuch Perfons, in Cafe\ntheir Underftandi.ng was opened above, and they\nfaw in clear Day that Nature in itfelf is dead, and\nthat human Intelligence in itfelf is Nothing, but\nthat it is only from Influx that both thefe appear to\nbe, would acknowledge the Divine Providence, and\nI perceived that they \u00b7who have confirmed them-\nfeh\u00b7es in Favour of Nature and of human Prudence,\nwould not acknowledge it, becaufe the natural\nLight flowing in from beneath wo1,1ld immediately\n~1\\:tingt}ifh ~he fpiritual Light flowing in from above,\n1 89! The Man who is made fpiritual by the Ac,\nknowledgment of God, and wife by the Rejection\nof his own Proprium, in. the univerfal Vlorld, and\nin all <J.nq every Particular thereof, feeth the Divine\nProvidence ; if he looks at natural Things he fees\nit, if he looks at civil Things he fees it, if he\nlooks at fpiritual Things he fees it, and this\nas well in the fimultaneous as the fucceffive\nOrder of Things, in Ends, in Caufes, in EffeB:s,\n~n Ufes, in Forms, in things great and fmall; efpe~\ncially in the Salvation of Men, as that Jehovah gave\nthe '\\Vprd, that by it he taught Men concerning\nGod, concerning Heaven and Hell, concerning Life\neternal, and that he came into the World Himfelf,\nthat he might redeem and favc Men: Thefe anq\nmore fuch Things, and the Divine Providence in\nthem, doth l\\lan fee froni fpiritual Light in natural\nLight. But the merely natural Man fees N athing\nof thefe Things ; he is like one who beholds a mag-\nnificent Temple, and hears a Preacher' illuminated\nin DiYine Things, ~nd faith when at Home, that he\nfaw Nothing but a Stone Building, and heard Noth-\ning P'!lt articulat~ founds; Or he is like a near~\nfighted\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. ZS3\nlighted Man \\vho goeth into a garden furnifhed\nwith all Kinds of Fruits, and then cometh Home\nand declareth that he only faw a Wood and Trees:\nSuch alfo after Death, when they become Spirits,\nin Cafe they are taken up into the Angelic Heaven,\nwhere all Things are in Forms reprefentative of\nLove and \\Vifdom, do not fee any Thing of fuch\nObjeas, or even of their Exifl:ence ; as I have feen\nthe Cafe with feveral who denied the Divine Prov-\nidence.\n190. There are many confl:ant [or fixed] Things;\nwhich were created, in Order that Things incon-\nfiant [or unfixed] might exifl: ; confl:ant Things are\nthe ftated Times of the Rifing arrd Setting of the\nSun and Moon, and alfo of the Stars; the Darken-\ning of them by Interpofitions, \\vhich are called E-\nclipfes; Heats and Lights from them; the Seafons.\nof the Year, \\vhich are called Spring, Summer, Au-\ntumn, and \"\\:Vinter; and the Times of. the Day,\nwhich are the Morning, Noon, Evening, and Night;\nalfo the Atmofpheres, Waters, and Earths confider-\ned in themfelves; the vegetative Faculty in the veg-\netable Kingdom, and together with this the pro-\nlific Faculty in the animal Kingdom ; likewife the\nThings which are confl:antly produced from thefe,\nwhen they are put in Aaion according to the Laws\nof Order. Thefe and many other Things are pro-\nvided by Creation, that Things infinitely various\nmay exifl; for Variety cannot exifl: but in Things\nconfl:ant, flated, and certain. But Examples will\nillufi:rate this ; the various Things of Vegetation\nwould not exifl:, if the Rifing and Setting of the Sun,\nand the Heat and Light thenc'e proceeding, were\nnot confi:ant: Harmonies are ofinfinite Variety, but\nthey\n\f1.54 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nthey would not exift, except the Atmofpheres in\ntheir Laws, and the Ears in their Form, were con-\nfl:ant: The Varieties of Sight, which are alfo infi~\nnite, would not exifl:, except the Ether in its Laws,\nand the Eye in its Form, were conHant; in iike\nManner Colours, except the Light were confhnt :\nJt is the fame with Thoughts, Speech, and AB:ions,\n\\vhich are alia of infinite Variety, and which would\nnot exifl:, except rhe organic Parts of the Body '.vere\nconfl:ant : Mufi: not a Haufe be conf!.ant, that vari..,\n\\)us Things may be done therein by Man? In like\nManner a Temple, that various Particulan; of Di~\nvine \\Vorfhip, Sermons, Infhutl:ions, and Medita-\ntions of Piety, may be performed therein? and fo\nin other Things. As to \\vhat relates t.o the Varie..\nties themfelves, which are produced in Things con-,\n:fl:ant, fiated, ;md certain, they go on ad Ir!finitum,\nand have no End, and yet there never exifl:s one\nentirely the fame with another, in dl and fingular\nthe Things of the Univerfe, neither can exifl: in the\nSucce:ilion of Things to Eternity: Vlho difpofeth\nthefe Varieties, which go on to Infinity and Eterni-.\nty, that they may be in Order, but He who created\nThings confl:.ant, to the End that they might exifl:\ntherein? And who can difpofe the infinite Varieties\nof Life among Men, but He who is Life itfelf, that\nis, Love itfelf and \\Vifdom itfelf? \\i''Jithout his Di...\n''ine Providence, which is as a continual Creation,\ncould the infinite AffeB:ions and the Thoughts of\nMen thence derived, and thus the Men them..\nfelves, be fo difpofed as to make one, evil Affec-\ntions ~nd the Thoughts thence \u2022 derived one\nDevil which is Hell, and good AffeCtions and the\nThoughts thence derived one Lord in Heaven ?\nThat\n\fTH.r: DrYIN!: PROVIDENCE; 255\n'That the univerfal Angelic Heaven is in the Sight\nof the Lord as one Man, who is the Image and L1ke.;\nncfs of Himfelf, and the univerfal Hell, is ia Oppo-\nfition as one M:m-Monfter, has at Times been faid\nand {hewn before. Thefe obfervations are made;\nbecaufe fame natural Men, even from Things con-\nftant and ftated, whi'ch are Necefiities to the End\n. ,\nthat various Things may exift in them, catch at\nArguments ia their Delirium in Favour of Nature\nand Self-derived Prudence;\nThat Self-derived Prudence is Nothi1~r;,\n. and on{y appears as ifit was, and aljo\nozfght _\n.fo t~ apf1ear ). but.that the Di-\nvzne Provzdence from Tlzzngs the mofl\nparticular is univerjal.\nJ:!}I.THAT Self-derived Prudence is Nothing,\nis altogether contrary to Appearance, and\ntherefore con!rary to the Belief of many; and fince\nthis is the Cafe, no one, who from Appearance is\nin the Belief that human Prudence does every\nThing, can be convinced but by Reafons of deeper\nInvefl:igation, which are to be taken from Caufes ;\nfuch Appearance is an Effed:, and its Cauf~s difcov-\ner whence it is. In this preliminary Part we fhall\nfay Something of the common Opinion concerning\nthis l\\bttcr : Contrary to Appearance is this Tenet\nwhich the Church teacheth, that Love and Faith\nare\n\f256 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nare not from Man but from God, as alfo \\:Vifdom\nand Intelligence, therefore Prudence likewife, anct\nin general every Thing good and true ; when this\nTenet is received, it mufl: alfo be received, that Self\u00b7\nderived Prudence is Nothing, but only appears as if\nit was ; Prudence is from no other Source but from\nIntelligence and Wifdom7 and thefe two are from\nno other Source but from the Underfl:anding and\nThought thence derived of what is good and true.\nThis is received and believed by thofe who acknowl.\nedge the Divine Pro\\\u00b7idence, and not by thofe who\nacknowledge human Prudence alone. Either now\nit mufl: be true what the Church teacheth, that all\nvVifdom and Prudence is from God, or what the\n\\:Vorld teacheth, that all vVifdom and Prudence is\nfrom Man: Can they be reconciled any otherwife\nthan by faying that what the Church teacheth is\ntrue, and that what the \\Vorld teacheth is an Ap4\npearance? For the Church confirmeth what it teach4\neth from the Word, but the \\:Vorld' what it teach-\neth from its Propriunz [own proper Wifdom,] and\nthe Word is from God, and Proprium is from Man.\nForafmuch as Prudence is from God, and not from\nMan, therefore a Chrifl:ian Man, when he is in De-\nvoti<m, prayeth that God would lead his Thoughts,\nIntentions, and AB:ions, and alfo adds, becaufe\nfrom himfelf he cannot ; fuch a one alfo, when he\nfeeth any ~ne doing Good, faith that he was in.\ndined to it by God, and other fuch like Things :\nCan any one fo fpeak, unlefs he then intetiorly be-\nlieves it, and to believe it interiorly is from Heaven;\nbut when he thinketh with himfelf, and colleB:s\nArguments in Favour of human Prudence, he can\nbelieve\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 257\nbelieve the contrary, and this is from tlie vVorld:\nBut internal Belief prevai!eth with thofe who ac-\nknowledge God in th..ir Hearts, \\vhereas external\nBelief with thofe who do not acknowledge God in\ntheir Hearts, ho\\vfoever they may do it with their\nMouths.\n192. It -vvas faid, that no one, who E.-om Ap-\npearance is in the Belief th;1t l1umau Prudence~\ndoes every Thing, can be comincet.l but by Rea-\nfans of deeper Invefl:igation, which arc to be de-\nduced from Caufcs ; wherefore that Reafons de-\nduced from Caufes may be evident to the Uuder-\nfianding, it may be expedient to prefent them in\ntheir Order, which fhall be as follows. I. That\nall the Thoughts of a Man are from the AffeCtions\nof his Life's Love, and tbat there do not, neitht:r\ncan e;.'Ciil, any Thoughts at all, without thofe Af-\nfeCl:ions. II. That the AffeCl:ions of a Man's Life's\nLove are known to the Lord only. III.

Above in this\nTreatife, and in that before mentioned concerning\nTHE DIVINE LovE AND THE DIVINE \\V'IsDoM, it\nis demonfirated, that in the Lord there is Divine\nLove. and Divine Wifdom, and that thefe two are\nLife itfdf, and that from thefe two Man hath '\\i\\Till\nand Underfranding, from the Divine Love Will~\nand from the Divine Wifdcom Underflanding; and\nthat to thefe two Principles the Heart and Lungs\ncorrefpond in the Body_\n; and that thence it n1ay\n- appear, that as the Pulfation of the Heart, together\nwith the Refpiration of the Lungs, governs the\nwhole Man as to his\u00b7 Body, fo the Will, together\nwith the Underfianding, governs the whole Man as\nto\n\fTnE DIVINE PROVIDENCl!. 259\nto his 1\\'lind ; and that thus there are two Principles\nof Life in every Man, one natural and the other\nfpiritual, and that the natural Principle of Life is. the\nPulfation of the H eart, and the fpiritual Principle of\nLife the \\Vill of the Mind ; and that each adjoineth\nto itfelf a Confort, with which it cohabits) and with\nwhich it operates the Functions of Life, and that\nthe Heart conjoineth to itfelf the Lungs, and that\nthe \\Viii conjoineth to itfelf the Underfi:anding.\nNow forafmuch as the Soul of the \\Viii is Love,\nand the Soul of the Underflanding is Wifdom, both\nfrom the Lord, it follows, that Love is the Life of\nevery one, and that the ~ality of fuch Life is ac-\ncording to the Nature of Love's Conjunction }vith\nWifdom ; or what is the fame, that the Will .is the\nLife of every one, and that the ~ality of fuch Life\nis according to the Nature of the Will's Conjunc-\ntion with the Underflanding: But on this SubjeCl:\nfee more in the Treatife above, and efpecially in\nTHE ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING THE DI-\nVINE LovE AND THE DrviNE \\VJsnoM, in Part\nthe Firfi and Part the Fifth.\nI 94\u00b7 In the above mentioned Treatifes it is alfo\ndemonfl:rated, that the Life's Love produces out of\nitfelf fubaltern Loves, which are called AffeB:ions,\nand that thefe are exterior and interior; and that\nthefe taken together make as it were one Dominion\nor Kingdom, in which the Life's Love is Lord or\nKing : Moreover it is demonflrated, that thofe fub-\naltern Loves or Affeaions adjoin to themfelves\nConforts, each its own~ the interior AffeCtions Con-\nforts which are called Perceptions, and the ~xterior\nAffections Conforts whkh are called Thoughts, and\nthat\n\f260 A:::;GELJC 'V1SDOM CONCERNING\nthat each cohabits with its own Confort, and dif-\ncharges the FunCtions of its L ife ; and that there\nis fuch a ConjunCtion of both, as is that of tlie.Ef-\nfence ( PjfZ) of Life with the Exi.fl:ence of Life,\nwhich is fuch, that one is not any Thing, but, in\nC onjunClion with the other, for what is the Efl'ence\nof Life, unlefs it exifts, and what is the Exi{i:ence\nof Life but from the Eifence of Life? Alfo, that the\nConjunCtio:1 of Life is fuch, as is that of Sound and\nHarn-:.ony, likewife of Sound and Speech, in gener-\nd fuch as is that of the Pulfation of the Heart and\nthe Rcfpiration of the Lungs ; which Conjuncrion\nis fuch, that one without the other is not any Thing,\nand that one by Conjuncrion with the other becomes\nSomething : Conjunctions muil either b~ in them,\nor are produced by them : As for Example, in the\nCai'e of Sound ; he who thinks that Sound is any\nThing, unlefs there be Something in it which dif-\ntingui{hes, is mifbken : Sound alfo correfponds to\n.AffeCtion in 1\\hn: and foralinuch as there is in it\nalw2.ys Something ''- hich diHinguifhcs, therefore\nfrom the Sound or Tone of a Man's Voice in fpeak-\njng is known the Af1eCtion of his Love, and from\nits Variation1 which is Speech, is known his\nThought: Hence it is, that the wifer Angels, bare-\n]y from the Sound or Tone of Voice of him who\nfpeaks, perceive his Life's Loves, together with\ncertain AffeCtions which are Derivations.

It is not\nany Thing animated but inanimate ; diminilh De-\nlight and Pleafanmefs, and you will gr'ow cold or\ntorpid; take them away, and you will expire and\ndie :-From the Delights of the AffeB:ions, and the\nPleafantneffes of the Perceptions and Thoughts, is\nderived the vital Heat. Since every AifeB:ion hath\nits Delight, and the Thought thence derived its\nPleafantnefs, it i~ evident whence Good and Truth\nis, alfo what Good and Truth are in their Effence :\nGood is to every one that which is the Delight of\nhis AfFeCtion, and Truth that which is the Pleafam-\nnefs of his Thought derived therefrom : For every\none calleth that good, which from the Love of his\n\\Vill her feeleth delightful, am1 he calleth that true,\nwhich from the \\Vifdom of his Underfl:at}ding- he\nperceiveth pleafant as therein grounded : They\nboth flow from the Life's Love, as Water from a\nFountain, or as Blood from the Heart: Each taken\ntogether is like Tide or Atmcfphere, in which the\nwhole human :Mind dwells. Thefe two, Deli~ht\nar.d\n\f262 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nand Ple~fantnefs, in the Mind are fpiritual, but in\nthe Body they are natural ; as exifling in both they\nconflitutc the Life of Man. Hence it is evident\nwhat that is in Man which is called good, and what\nthat which is called true: Alfo, what that is which\nis called evil in Man, and what that which is called\nfalfe, m..mely, that is evil to him, which deflroys\nthe Delight of his AffeCtion, and that falfe, which\nde!l:roys the Pleafantnefs of his Thought derived\nthence; it is further evident, that Evil fr')m the\nDelight thereof, and what is Falfe from the Pleaf.\nantnefs thereof, may be called and thought good\nand true. Goods and Truths are indeed Chang~\nand Variations of State in the Forms of the Mind,\nhut thefe are only perceived and live by their Del\nlights and Pleafantneffes. Thefe Things are addu.\nced, that it may be known what AfFeCl:ion and\nThought are in their Life.\n196. Now whereas it is the Mind of Man which\nthinks, and thinks from the Delight of its Affeftion,\nand not the Body; and whereas the l'vlind of Man\nis his Spirit, which lives after Death, it follows, that\nthe Spirit of r~1:an is Nothing but Affeftion and\nThought therefrom derived. That there cannot\nexifl any Thought without Affeftion, is very evident\nfrom Spirits and Angels in the fpiritual \\Vorld, for\nall there think from the Affeftions of their Life's\nLove,\" and the Delight thereof encompaifes. every\none, as his Atmofphere; and all are connefted there\naccording to thefe Spheres exhaling from their Af.\nfec:tions through their Thoughts : Moreover the\n\u00b7CharaCler and ~ality of every one is knovm from\nthe Sphere of his Life. Hence it may ::1ppcar, that\nall\n\u2022\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 263\nall Thought is from Affection, and that it is the\nForm of its Affection. It is the fame with the \\Vill\nanu the Underfl:anding ; the fame with Good and\nTruth ; and \u00b7the fame with Charity and Faith.\n197\u00b7 11. I'hat tbe AJ!ec7ions of a Afan's Lift's\nL()'l)e are known to tbc Lord only. .Man knows hi~\nThoughts and thence his Intentions, becaufe he fees\nthem in himfdf; and fora[much as all Prudence is\nfrom them, he fees that alfo in himfelf ; in thi~\nCafe, if his Life's Love is the Love of Self, he\n~omes into the Pride of SeH:derived Intelligence,\nand afcribes Prudence to himfdf; and colleas Ar-\nguments in Favour thereof, and fo recedes from the\n.Acknowledgment of the Divine Providence: The\nCafe is fimilar, if the Love of the \u00b7world is his Life's\nLove ; yet fuch a one doth not recede in the fame\nDegree : From which Confiderations it is evident,\nthat thefe two Loves afcribe all Things to Man and\nhis Prudence ; and if they are examined more in-\nteriorly, Nothing to God and his PrQvidence :\nWherefore when they happen to hear, that the\nTruth is, that human Prudence is Nothing, but\nthat it is the Divine Providence alone, which gm\u00b7.\nerns all Things, if they are abfolute Atheifl.:s, they\nlaugh at it ; but if they retain any Thing of Relig-\nion in the Memory, and it is affirmed to them, that\nall '\\Vifdom is from Cod) they do indeed at !ir!l\nHearing acknowledge it, but yet inwardly in their\nSpirit they.deny it. Such particularly are Pricfts,\nwho love themfelves better than God, and the\n\\Vorld better than Heaven, or what amounts to\nJhe fame Thing, who wodhip G,:~d for the Sake of\nHonours and lnterefl:, and yet preach that Chariq\nanu\n\f264 ANGELIC \\VrsDOM CONCERNING\nand Faith, every Thing good and true, likewife aH\n\\Vifdom, yea all Prudence, are from God, and\nNothi11g from Man. Once in the fpiritual \\Vorld\n1 heard two Prief!:s difputing with a certain royal\nLegate [ Legatw Regni] concerning human Pru-\ndence, whether it be from God or from Man, and\ntheir Difpute was \\Varm : They all three in their\nHe:uts thought alike, tiamely, that human Prudence\ndoes every Thing, and the Divine Providence Noth-\ning : But the Ptidls, who were then under the In-\nfluence of theological Zeal, fa!d, that Nothing of\nWifdom and Prudence is from Man ; and when.\nthe Legate replied, that at that Rate neither would\nthere be any Thought from Man, they faid, that\nthere was none : But forafrnuch as it was perceived\nby the Angels, that thefe three were of the fame\nOpinion, the Legate was told to put on the Gar-\nrnents of a Prieft, and think himfelf a Prieft, and\nthen to fpeak; accordingly he did put them on,\nand thought as he was defired, and then he declar-\ned loudly, that there never can be any Wifdom or\nPrudence in Man, but from God, and defended\nhi:nfclf with his ufual Eloquence, full of rational\nArguments: Afterwards they faid to the two Priefls\nalfo, put off your Garments and put on the Gar-\nments of political Minifl:ers, and think yourfelves\nfuch, and they did fo, and then at d1e fame Time\nthought from their inner Selves, and fpake from\n.A:rguments which they had before cheri.!hed in-\nwardly in Favour of human Prudence againfl: the\nDivine Providence : Afterwards thefe three, foraf-\nrnuch as they were in a fimilar Faith, became inti-\nmate\n\fTnE DiviNE PRovinE~cr. '2Gs\nnute Friends [Amici Cordis,] and entered together\ninto the Path of Self-derived Prudence, which leaJs\nto Hell.\u00b7\nI g8. It was fhewn ::1bovc, that Man hath not any\nThought, but from fome Atrettion of his Life's\nLove, and that Thought is Nothing elfe but the\n}i'orm of AiTettion : Since therefore Man fees his\nThought, and cannot fee his AfieCl:ion, for the lat-\nter he feels, it follows, that from Sight, which is in\nAppearance, he concludes that Self-derived Pru-\ndence does every Thing ; and not from AffeCtion,\nwhich does not come into Sight, but into Senfa-\ntion : For AffeCtion only manife{ts itfelf by a cer-\ntain Delight of Thought, am! Pleafure of Ratiocin-\natipn concerning it, and then this Pleafure and De-\nlight makcth one with TJ1ought in thofe, who have\nFaith in Self-derived Prudence from the Love of\nSelf or the Love of the 'TvVorld ; and Thought flows\nin its Delight as a Ship in the Current of a River,\nto which the Sailor doth not attend, but only to the\nSails which he expands.\nI 99\u00b7 A Man can indeed reflecr upon the Delight\nof his external AffeCl:i:\n:m, when it aCts as one '.vith\nthe Delight of any bodily Senfe, but yet he does\nnot reflea that that Delight is from the Delight of\nAffeCtion in Thought : As for Example, when a\nFornicator feeth an Harlot, his Eyes fparlde with the.\nFire of I.afci\\'ioufnefs) and from it he feeleth Delight\nin the Body, but yet he doth not feel the Delight of\nhis Affection or Concupifcence in Thought, but as\nSomething of Cupidity in the Body : It is the fame\nwith a Robber in the \\Voods when he feeth Travel-\nlers; and a Pirate, in the Sea when he feeth Ships;\nK K the\n\f:66 ANGELIC \\VrsDO~! CONCERNING\nthe Cafe i~ fimilar with others : That thefe Delights\ngovern his Thoughts, and that his Thoughts are\nNothing without them, is evident, but he thinks\nthat they are only Thoughts, when neverthelefs\nThoughts are Nothing but Affeaions compofed in-\nto Forms by his Life's Love, that they may appear\nin the Light, for all AfFeCtion is in Heat, and all\nThought in Light. Thefe are AffeCtions of exter-\nnal Thought, which indeed manifefl: themfelves in\nthe Senfation of the Body, but rarely in the Thought\nof theMind. But the AffeCtions of internalThought,\nfrom which the external exifl:, never manifefl: them-\nfelves to a Man : Of thefe a Man knows no more,\nthan a Traveller fleeping in a Carriage doth of his\nJourney, or than a Man feels the Circumrotation of\nthe Earth: Now fince a Man know\"eth Nothing of\nthe Things which are tranfaCl:ed in the Interiors of\nhis MinJ, which are fo infinite that they cannot be\ndefined by Numbers, and yet the few Externals,\nwhich come to the Sight of his Thought, are pro~\nduced from Interiors, and the Interiors are regula-\nted of the Lord alone by his Divine Providence,\nand thofe few Externals by the Lord in Conjunc~\ntion with Man ; how then can any one fay, that\nhis own Prudence does every Thing ? If you were\nonly to fee one Idea of Thought difclofed, you\nwould fee more fl:upendous Things than Tongue\ncan utter. That in the Interiors of the Mind of\nMan there are fuch infinite Things, that they can-\nnot be defined by Numbers, is evident from the in-\nfinite Number of Things in the Body, from which\nNothi!lg comes to the Sight and Senfe, but ACtion\n:itlone in much Simplicity, to which neverthelefs\n., concur\n\fTH.E DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 267\nconcur Thoufands of moving or mufcular Fibres,\nThoufands of nervous Fibres, Thoufands of Blood-\nVeffels, and Thoufands of pulmonary Air-Veffels,\nwhich mufl: needs co-operate in every Action,\nThoufands of Things in the Brains and in the fpinal\nMarrow, and many more fiill in the fpiritual Man,\nwhich is the human Mind, all the Things whereof\nare Forms of Affections, and of Perceptions and\nThoughts thence derived. Doth not the Soul\nwhich difpofeth Things interior, alfo difpofe Actions\nby Virtue thereof? The Soul of Man is Nothing\nelfe but the Love of his \\Vill, and the Love of his\nUnderfianding thence derived; fuch as this Love\nis, fuch is the whole Man ; and he is made fuch\naccording to the Difpofition in Externals in which\nMan is concern1=d with the Lord : \"Wherefore if he\nattributes all Things to himfelf and to Nature, his\nSoul becomes the Love of Self; but if he attributes\nall Things to the Lord, his Soul becomes the Love\nof the I\"ord : And the latter Love is celefl:ial,\nwhereas the former is infernal~\n2oo. Now forafmuch as the Dt:Iights of Man's\nAffections carry a Man from Intimates [the Thingt\nwhich are inmoft] by the Interiors to the Exteriors~\nand at length to the Extremes, which are in the\nBody, as the Airs and Currents carry a Ship, and\nNothing of them appears to Man, but what is done\nin the Extremes of the Mind and the Extremes of\nthe Body, how then can Man claim to himfelf what\nis Divine from this Circumfiance alone, that thofe\nfew Extremes appear to him as his own ? Still lefs\nought he to claim to himfelf what is Di'{ine, when\nl:le knoweth from Tm: V.foR:e, that a Man cannot\ntake\n\u2022\n\fa.68 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\ntake any Thing from himfelf, except it be given\nhim from Heaven; and from REASON, that that\nAppearance is given him, that he may live a Man,\nfee \\vhat is good and evil~ choofe one or the other,\nappropriate to himfelf that which he choofeth, to the\nIntent there may be a Pofiibility of his being joined\nreciprocally to the Lord, reformed, regenerated,\nfaved, and of his living to Eternity. That this Ap-\npearance was given to 1\\hn, that he might acr from\nl-iberty according to Reafon, therefore as if from\nl1imfdt~ and not hang down his Hands and wait for\nInfl.ux:, was faiJ and ihewn above. Hence follows\nthe Confirmation of that which was to be demon- .\nil:rated Thirdly, '.That the Affiflions ofthe Life's Love\nif A!ah are led ofthe Lord by his Divine Providence,\nand in fuch Cife at thefame '.Time his Thoughts,from\nv;bic\/; \u00b7human Prudence ii derived.\n:zoI. IV. Tbat the Lord by his Divine Pro'l.\u2022idenc~\ncornpofeth the Ajfe8ivns oft\/;e whole Human Race in-\nto one Form, which is the Human. That this is an\nUniverfal of the Divine Providence, will be feen in\nthe fubfequcnt Paragraph ; they who afcribe all\nThings to Nature, afcribe all Things alfo to human\nPrudence; for they who afcribe all Things to Na-\nture, in their Hearts deny God, and they who\nafcribe all Things to human Prudence, deny in their\nHearts the Divine Providence; one is nbt feparable\nfrom the other. But yet both thefe Sorts of Per-\nfans, for the Sake of their Reputation, and for Fear\nof lofing it, profefs with their Mouths, that the\nDivine P10vidence is univerfal or general, and that\nthe Particulars of it refl: with Man [fint apud Homi-\nnem;] and that thefe Particulars in their Comple~\n;:~r~\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVlD.ENCl!. 269\nme underfl:ood by human Prudence. But think\nwith yourfelf, what is univerfal (or general) PrO\\\u00b7i-\ndence, when Singulars (or Particulars) are fepara-\nted from it ? Is it any Thing more than a bare\n\\Vord? For that is called univerfal, which is form-\ned of Singulars conneCted together, as that is com-\nmon (or a Community) which exifl:s from Particu-\nlars : If therefore you feparate Singulars, what i~\nthe Univerfal in fuch Cafe, but like Something\nwhich is empty within, confequently like a Surface\n'within which there is Nothing, or like a Complex\ncontaining Nothing? If it fhould be alleged, that\nthe Divine Providence is an univerfal Government, ,\n;1.nd that not any Thing is governed, but only kept\nin its Connexion, and the Things which relate to\nGovernment [ilia quce Regiminis funt] \u00b7are difpofed\nby others, can.this be called an uni\u2022terfal Govern-\nment? No King hath fuch a Government as this;\nfor if a King were to allow his s\u00b7ubjeets to govern\nevery Thing in his Kingdom, he would no longer be\na King, but would only be called a King, therefore\nwould have only a nominal Dignity and uo real\nDignity: Such a King cannot be faid to hold the\nGovernment, much lefs univerfal Go\\\u00b7ernment.\nProvidence with God is called Prudence with Man ;\nas there cannot be faid to be univerfal Prudence in\na King, who hath referved to himfelf no more than\n.the Name to the Intent that his Kingdom may be\ncalled a Kingdom, and fo kept together ; fo neither\n.could there be faid to be an univerfal Pro\\'idencc,\nif Men from their own Prudence were to provide\nfor every Thing. It is the fame with the Name of\nJ.Jniverfal Providence, and of univerfal Government,\nas\n\f';.70 ANGELIC \\VlSDO.M CONCERNING\nas fpoken in Relation to Nature, when it is under~\nftood that God created Nature, and endued her\nwith a Power of producing all Things from herfelf:\n'Vhat is univerfal Providence at this Rate, but a\nmetaphyfical Term, or a mere Sound without any\nMeaning? Neither do many of thofe, who attribute\nto Nature every Thing that is produced, and to hu-\nman Prudence \u00b7\nevery Thing that is done, and yet\nprofefs with their l\\Iouths that God created Na-\nture, think otherwife of the Divine Providence than\nas of an empty Sound. But the Cafe really is, that\nthe Divine Providence exifl:s in the moil: minute\nParticulars of Nature, and in the mofl: minute\nParticulars of human Prudence, and by governing\nthefe Particulars, governs univerfally.\n2()2. The Divine Providence ofthe Lord is uni-\nverfal from Things the mofl: particular in this Cir-\ncumfl:ance, that he created the Univerfe, to the End\nthat an infinite and eternal Creation might exifl\ntherein from Himfelf; and this Creation exifis by\nthe Lord's forming out of Men a Heaven, 'Yhich is\nin his Sight as one Man, who is the Image and\nLikenefs of Himfelf: That Heaven, as formed out\nof Men, is fuch in the Sight of the Lord, and that\nthis.was the End of Creation, was ihewn above, n.\n27 to 45: And that the Divine in all that he coeth,\nrefpeCteth Infinite and Eternal, n. 56 to 6g. The\nInfinite and Eternal, which the Lord hath RefpeB:\nto in forming his Heaven out of Men, Is, that it may\nbe enlarged to lnfinity and Eternity; and thus that\nhe may confl:antly dwell in the End of his Creation.\nThis Creation is infinite and eternal, which the Lord\n.provided by the Creation of the Univerfe, and in this\nCreation'\n\f'\n'THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. Z7I\nCreation he is confl:antly engaged by his Divine\nProvidence. Who that knoweth and believeth from\nthe DoB:rinc of the Church, that God is infinite\nand eternal, (for the Do8rine of all the Churches ilz\nthe Chrfllian World holds, that God the Fatber, God\ntbe Son, and God the Holy Ghojl, is Infinite, Eternal;\nUncreate, and Omnipotent; fee Atbanqfius's Crred}\ncan be fo void of Reafon as not to aflent, when he\nheareth, that God cannot do otherwife than refpea\nInfinity and Eternity in his great \\Vork. of Creation,\n(for how can he aCt otherwife \\Vhen he aCts from.\nHimfelf) as alfo that he refpe8:eth this in the hu-\nman Race, out of which he fonneth his own Heav-\nen? \\Vhat elfe then can the Divine Providence have\nfor its End, but the ~eformation and Salvation of\nthe human Race? And no orie can be reformed of\nhimfelf by his own Prudence, but of the Lord by\nhis Divine Providence; hence it follows, that except\nthe Lord leads Man every Moment, yea every the\nmofl minute Point of Time, Man departs from the\n\\Vay of Reformation, and perifheth: Every Change\nand Variation of State of the human Mind changes\nand varies Something in the Series of Things pref-\nent, and thereby of Things confequent; what then\nmuft it not do in the Progreffion to Eternity? It i~\nlike an Arrow fuot from a Bow, which, if its Direc.\ntion at firft declines ever fo little from the Mark, at\nthe Difbnce of a Mile or more, would diverge im-\nmenfely; fo it would be if the Lord, every the leafi:\nMoment, uid not lead and govern the St;te of hu-\nman 1\\linrs. This the Lord doeth according to the\nLaws of his Divine Providence; agreeable to which\nit is alfo n~cefi\"ary, that it fho1,1ld appear to Man as\ni\u00a3\n\f'1.72 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CO~.;'CERNING\nif he led himfelf; but the Lord forefeeth how he\nwill lead (or guide) himfelf, and conftantly provides\naccordingly. That the Laws of Permiffion are al-\nfo Laws of the Di\\\u00b7ine Providence ; and that every\n1\\hn may be reformed and regenerated ; and that\nthere doth not exifl any fuch Thing as Predefl:ina-\ntion, will be feen in what follows.\nzo3. Since every Man therefore lives after Death\nto Ete~nity, and according to his Life here hath his\nPlace affigned to 11im either in Heaven or in Hell7\nand both thefe, as well Heaven as Hell, mufl: be in\nfuch a Form as to aB: as one, as was faid .before;\nand no one can occupy any other Place in that\nForm, but hi~ own, it follo\\VS, that the human\nRace throughout the whole \u00b7world is under the\nAufpices of the Lord, and that eYery one, from his\nInfancy even to the end of his Life, is led of Him\nin the mort minute Particulars, and his Place fore-\nfeen, and at the fame Time provided. From which\nConfiderations it is evident, that the Divine Provi-\ndence of the Lord is univerfal, becaufe it governs\nin the mofl minute Particulars ; and thar this is the\ninfinite anJ eternal Creation which the Lord hath\nprovided for Himfelf by the Creation of the Uni-\nverfe. Of this univerfal Providence Man doth not\nfee any Thing, .and if he did, it could not appear to\nhim any otherwife than as fcattered Heaps and\nCollections of Materials, out of which a Haufe is to\nbe formed, appear to thofe who pafs by; but by\nthe Lord\u00b7it is feen as a magnificent Palace confi:ant-\nly building and enlarging.\n204.

That in Cafe it did not appear to\nl\\1an, as if he lived from himfelf, and thus thought\nand wjlled, fpake and aB:ed\u00b7 as from himfelf, Man\nwould not be Man, is fully demonfi:rated in the pre-\nceding Pages : Hence it follows, that if Man doth\nnot difpofe, as if from his own Prudence, aU Things\nappertaining to his FunB:ion and Life, he cannot be\nguided and regulated by the Divine Providence;\nfor he would be like one fi:anding with his Hands\nhanging do\\'..-n, his Mouth open, his Eyes {hut, and\nhis Breath in drawn, in ExpeB:ation of lnfiux, there-\nfore he would divefi: hirnfelf of Humanity, which\nconfifl:s in the Perception and Senfation, that he\nlives, thinks, wills, fpeaks, and aB:s as if from him-\nfelf; and at the fame Time he would divefl himfelf\nof his two Faculties, pberty and Rationality, \\\\-}Jt.:re-\nby he is diftinguifl1ed from Bcafls : That without\nfuch\n\f278 ANGELIC \\VrSDOM CONCERNING\nfuch Appearance no Man would po!fefs the Recep-\ntive and the Reciprocal Principle, or Recipiency and\nReciprocality, and therefore neither Immortality, is\ndemonfhated above in this Treatife, and alfo in that\non the DiviNE LovE AND THE DIVINE \\VIsDoM.\nTherefore if you defire to be led of the Divine Prov-\nidence, ufe Pru'dence, as a Servant and Minifier,\nwho may faithfully difpcnfe the Goods of his Maf-\nter : Such Prudence is the Talent, which was given\nto the Servants to traffic with, of which they are to\ngive an Account, Luke xix. 13 to 25. 1\\htth. xxv.\nI 4 to 3I. Prudence itfelf appears to Man as his\nown, and it is believed to be his own, fo long as a\nMan keeps ihut up within himfelf that mofl:. inveter.\nate Enemy of God and the Divine Providence,\nwhich is Self-Love, who dwells in the Interiors of\nevery Man from his Birth ; if you do not know\nhim, for he defires not to be known, he dwells fe-\ncurely, and guards the\u00b7Door, left it fhould be open-\ned, and fo he :fhould be cafl:. out by the Lord. That\nDoor is opened by Man, by :fhunning Evils as Sins\nas if from himfelf, with an Acknowledgment that\nhe doeth fo from the Lord. It is this Prudence\nwith which the Divine Providence aCls as one.\n2 I I. The Rcafon why the Divine Providence\noperates fo occultly, _that fcarce any one knoweth\nthat it exifl:s, is, that Man may not periili; for the\nProprium of Man, which is his Will, never aB:s as\none with the Divine Providence ; the Proprium of\nMan hath an innate Enmity againfl:. it ; for it is that\nSerpent which feduced our firfi Parents, of which it\nis '\"Titten, \" I u\u00b7ill put Enmity between tbee and tbc\nJFoman, ar.d betwcm tby Sco'd and bcr Seed, itJba\/1\nbru!fe\n\fTHE DIVI~E PROVIDENCE. 279\nbruife thy Head,\" Gen. iii. I 5; the Serpent is Evil\nof every Kind ; his Head is Self-Love ; the Seed of\nthe \\Voman is the Lord ; the Enmity put between\nthem i:> betv;een Man's Self-Love and the Lord,\ntherefore alfo between the Self-derived Prudence of\nMan and the Divine ProYidence of the Lord ; for\nSelf-derived Prudence is continually lifting up its\nHead, and the Divine Provid~nce is continually\nkeeping it down. If Man felt this, he would be en-\nraged and exafperated againfl: God, and would per-\nifh; but while he doth not feel or perceive it, he\nmay be enraged and exafperated againfl: Men, and\nagainfl: himfelf, and likewife againfl: Fortune, by\nwhich he doth not perifh. Hence it is, that the\nLord by his Divine Providence continually leads\nMan in Freedom, and when he is led in Freedom,\nit appears no otherwife to Man than that he is led\nby his own Proprium; and to lead in Freedom\none who is in Oppofition to him that leads, is like\nraifing from the Earth a great refifling Weight by\nPullies, by which Means the Weight and Refift-\nance is not felt : Or as when any one is in the\nPower of an Enemy, whofe Intention is to put him\nto Death, which he then doth not know, and a\nFriend condutteth his Efcape through unknown\n\\Vays, and afterwards difcovers to him the Ene-\nmy's Intention.\n212.

Can this Caufe exifl: from any\nother Source, than the Divine Providence in Ulti-\nmates, where by Conflancies <\\Ud Inconfl:ancies it\n\u00b7deals wonderfully with human Prudence, and at\nthe fame Time conceals itfelf. That the Gentiles\nformerly acknowledged Fortune, and that they of\nItaly alfo built a Temple for her at Rome~ is well\nknown. Concerning this Fortune, which is, as\nwas faid, the Divine Providence in Ultimates, it\nhath been given to know many Things, which it is\nnot permitted to reveal ; from which it was evi-\ndenced to me, that it is not an Illufion of the\nMind, nor a Sporting of Nature, nor Something\nwithout a Caufe, for Something without a Caufe is\nnot any Thing, but that it is an ocular Tefl:ification,\nthat the Divine Providence operates in the mofl:\nminute Particulars of the Thoughts and ACtions of\nMan. When the Divine Providence operates in\nthe fmallefl: Particulars of Matters fo mean and\ntrifling, what mufl: it not do in the Particulars of\nThings not mean and trifling, fuch as is the Bufinefs\nof\n\fof Peace and \\Var upon Earth, and the E~finefs of\nSalvation anJ evcriafling Life in Heaven !\n2 r3\u00b7 Butt know, t!\"l:lt human l~rucknce bringeth\nl)\\'Cr the Rational (Faculty) to f1de with it, more\nthan the Di\\'inc Providence, by Reafon that t!:e\nlatter doth not appear, :mel the former does: It can\nmore eafily be received, that there is ori.e fole Life,\n\\vhich is God, and that all 1\\Jcn arc Rcci?ients of\nLife from Him; a~ was abundark!y ih::wn before,\nand neverthclcfs this amounts to the fame Thing,\nbecaufe Prudence is of Life. \\Vho doth not re:l:.-\nfon for human Prudence and Na~t:ne, when he rea-\nfens from the natural or external Man ? \\Vhc:cas\nwho doth not reafon in Favour of the Divine.

THAT the Divine Providence hath Re-\nfpeB: to Things eternal, and no other\u00b7\nwife to temporary Things\\han fo far as they accord\nwith Things eternal~ or make one with them, !hall\nbe demonfhated in the following Order. I. That\ntemporary Things relate to Dignities and Rich-\nes, therefore to Honours and Emoluments in this\n\\Vorld. II. That Things eternal relate to fpiritual\nHonours and Riches, which are of Love and '\\Vif~\ndom, in Heaven. Ill. That Things temporary and .\neternal are feparated by Man, but joined by the\nLord. IV. Th:1t the ConjunCtion of Things tem-\nporary and eternal is the Divine Providence of the\nLord.\n21 5\u00b7 I. That temporary Things relate I~ Dignitiu\nand Riches, tberefore to Honours and Emoluments in\nthis World. There are many temporary Things,\nbut yet they all relate to Dignities and Riches ; by\ntemporary Things are meant thofe Things which\neither perilh with Time, or ceafe with the Life of\nMan in this World only ;. but by Things eternal arc\nmeant the Things, which do not perifh and ceafe\nwith Time, therefore not with the Life in this\nWorld. Forafmuch as all temporary Things, as\nwas obferved, have Relation to Dignities and Rich.\nes,\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. ~8 3\nes, it is of Importance that the following Points\nfhould be underfto,od, namely, What and whence\nDignhies and Riches are : \\Vhat is the Nature of\nthe Love of them for their own Sake, and what the\nNature of the Love of them for the Sake of Ufe :\nThat thefe two Loves are diftincr from each other~\nas Hell is from Heaven : That the Difference be-\ntween thefe Loves is difficult to be known by Man :\nBut of each of thefe diftinctly. FIRST : FVhat and\nwhence Dignities and Riches are : Dignities and\nRiches were totally diffe~ent in the carlieft Ages,\nfrom what they afterwards became in Procefs of\nTime : Dignities in the mo!l: ancient or earliefl:\nAges were no other, than fuch as take Place among\nParents and their Children, which Dignities were\nDignities of Love,: fuil of Refpetl and Veneration,\nnot becaufe they received Birth, but InftruB.ion and\n'Wifdom from them, which is a fecond Birth, in it-\nfelf fpiritual, becaufe it was the Birth of their Spirit:\nThis was the only Dignity in the earlieft Ages, be-\ncaufe rhen Nations, Families, and Houfes, dwelt\nfeparatdy, and were not formed into Kingdoms as\nin modern Times: It was the Father of the Family\nin whom that Dignity refided : Thofe Times were\ncalled by the Ancients the golden Age. But after'\nthofe Times. the Love of goveming, from the fole\nDelight of that Love, fucceilively crept in ; and\nforafmuch as Enmity and Hoftility again!l: thofe\nwl~o would not fubmit, introduced them.felves at\nthe fame Time, therefore Nations, Families, and\nfloufes, from Necefiity colleC\\:ed themfeh\u00b7es into So-\ncieties [Cretus,] and fet over themfelves one, whom\nat firft they called a Judgr~, afterwards a Prince,\n\u00b7 'and\n\f'284 AN&ruc\u00b7 \\VrsDOM co~~CERNING\nand laflly aKin~ and a:1 Emperor : And then they\n~egan alfo to fortify themfeives in To\\vers, Bul-\nwarks, and Vlall3. From the Judge, Prince, King,\nor Emperor, was difFufed, as from the Head thrdugh\nthe .:Body, a Lufl: of Dominion, which fpread itfelf\nlike a Contagion among many, and {'hence ::uofe\nDegrees of Dignities, arid Honours cqnformable to\nthem ; and with them Self-Love, ;:md the Pride of\nSelf-derived Pn1dcnce. Similar \\vas the Cafe with\nthe Love of Riches: In the mofl: ancient or e;u\u00b7liefl:\n.Ages, when Nations and Families dwelt difl:inEtly\nfrom eac~1 other, there was no other Love of Rich-\nes than to poffefs -the.Neceffaries of Life, which they\nprocured for themfelves by Flocks and Herds, and\nby Fields, Pafl:ures, and Gardens, Lom v1hich they\nderived Subfi!l:ence : Among thdr Neceffaries of\nLife were al!o reckoned decent Houfes, furnifi1ed\nwith all IGrids of Utenfils, and Jikewife Cloathing :\nThe Care and l\\'Iana~2ment of all thefe Things was\nthe Occupation of the Parents, Children, Men-Ser-\nvants, and Maid-Servants in -the Houfe. But after\nthat the Lo;e of Dominion beg;m to prevail, and\ndefl:royed this St{tte of Society, the Love of poffef-\nilng \\Vealth beyond their Neceilities inv'aded .Man-\nldnd, and gre~v to fuch a Height, as to produce a\nDeftre of po{ldJing the '\\Vealth of all. Thefe two\nl.oves are as it were connet1ed by Cmifar.guinity,\n:for he who dcfireth to rule over every Thing, defi-\n:reth alfo to poffefs every Thing, for thus ail Things\nbecome his Servants, and he their fole Lord and\nMail:er : 'l his is evidently infl:anced in thofe of the\nPopifh Religion, who ha,\u00b7e exalted their Dominion\neven into Heav-en, to the Throne of the ~ord, upon\n\u00b7 which\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 285\nwhich they have placed themfelves, and who alfo\ncovet the Riches of the whole Earth, and amafs\nTreafurcs without End. SECONDLv : Wh,'lt is the\nNature of the Love of Dignities and Riches for tbeir\nc<.un Sake; and what tbe Nature of the Love of them\nfor the Sake of UJe : The Love of Dignities and\nHonours, for the Sake of Dignities and Honours,\nis the Love of Self, properly the LO\\'e of Dominion\ngrounded in the Love of Self ; and the Love of\nRiches and Poffeilions, for the Sake of Riches and\nPoffet1ions, is the Love of the \\Vorld, properly the\nLove of poffeiling the Goods of others by any Art\nwhatfoever : But the Love of Dignities and Riches,\nfor the Sake of Ufes, is the Love of Ufes, which is\nthe fame with the Love of our Nei2\"hbour, for t!Jat\n0\nwhich is the Ground of Man's ACtion, or for the\nSake of which he acb, is his influencing End,\n[Finis a quo,] \u00b7and is firfl: or primary, and other\nThings are Means, and are fecond~ry. \\\\Tith Re-.\nfpeB: to the Love of Dignities and Honours for\ntheir own Sakes, which is the fame as Self-Love,\nproperly \"vith the Love of Dominion from the Love\nof Self, it is the Love of Man's Proprium, and the\nProprium .of Man is all Evil ; hence it is that l\\1an\nis faid to be born to all Evil,\u00b7and that his hereditary\n[Difpofition] is Nothing but Evil ; the hereditary\n[Difpofition] of Man is his Proprium, in which he\nis, and into which he comes by Self-Love, and prin-\ncipally by the Love of Dominion grounded in the\nLove of Self; for the Man who is principled in that\nLove, refpeB:eth Nothing but himfelf, and fo im-\nmerfes his Thoughts and AffeB:ions into his Pro-\npnum ; lienee it is, that in the Love of Self there\ndwelL;\n\f286 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNIN(l\ndwells a Love of doing Evil ; the Reafon is, becaufe\nhe doth not love his Neighbour, but himfelf only ;\nand he who loves himfelf only, fees others a& with..\nout himfelf, or as vile) or of no Account, whom in\nCon1parifon with himfelf he defpifeth, \u00b7whilfl: he\nmakes light of qoing tlwm Mifchief : Hence it\ncomes to pafs, that he who is in the l..ov~ of Do.,\nminion groundeq in the Love of Self, fcrupl~s not\nto defraud his Neighbour, t9 commit Adult~ry with\nhis Neighbour's \\Vife, to blafpheme him, to. breathe\nRevenge againfi: him even unto l)eath, to exercife\nCruelty tov\u2022ards him, and the like : Man deriveth\nthefe evil Difpofitions from this Circumfi:ance, that\nthe Devil himfelf is Nothing elfe but the Love of\nDominion grounded in the Love of Self, with whom\nevery one is conneCted or conjoined, who is princi...\npled in Self-Love, and by whom he is led ; and he\nwho is led of the Devil, that is, of Hell, is led into.\n;:~ll the above Evils ; and he is continually led by\nthe Delights of thofe Evils : Hence it is, that all\nwho are in Hell, have a Defire to do Mifchief to\nevery one, but they who are in Heaven, have a De..\nfire to do Good to every one. From this Oppofi,\nti;n exifl:s that Principle which is in the Middle, in.\nwhich Man is, and he is therein as in Equilibrio, fo.\nthat he can turn himfelf either to Hell or to Heav\u2022.\nen t and in Proportion a~ he favours the Evils of\nSelf-Love, in the fame Proportion he turns himfelf\nto Hell, and in Proportion as he removes thofe Evils\nfrom bimfelf, in the fame Proportion he turns him\u2022.\nfelf to Heaven. It hath been given me to feel what\nand how great the Delight is of the Love of Do..\nminion grounded in the Love of Self ; I was le~\ninto\n\fTuE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 287\ninto it, in Order that I might know it, and it \\Vas\nfuch, that it exceeded all the Delights in the World;\nit was a Delight of the whole Mind from its Inti-\nmates (inmofl: Parts) to its Ultimates, but was only\nfelt in the Body as a certain Pleafure and Liberty\n[lubens] [welling in the Breafl:; and it was alfo giv-\nen to perceive, that from this Delight, as their Foun-\ntain, flow the Delights of all Evils, as of Adultery,\nRevenge, Fraud, Blafphemy, and in general of eve.\nry Thing that is wicked. There is a Simiiar De-\nlight in the Love of po!feffing the \\Vealth of others\nby any Art whatfoever, and in the Concupifcences\nwhich are Derivations therefrom; but yet not in\nthe fame Degree, unlefs it be joined to the Love of\nSelf. But with Refpecr to Dignities and Riches\nloved not for their own Sake, but for the_Sake of\nUfes, fuch Love is not the Love of Dignities and\nRiches, but the Love of Ufes, to which Dignities\nand Riches are fubb\u00b7vient as Means; this Love is\n<:elefl:ial: But of it more in what follows. TmRDLY:\n'That thoje two Loves are d~llinfl from each other as\nHeaven and Hell, is evident from what hath now\nbeed faid, to which I will add ; that :111 they who\nare in tbe Love of Dominion grounded in the LoYe\nof Sdf, as to their Spirit, are in Hell, whofoever\nthey be, whether great or fma!l; and that all who\nare in that Love, are in the Love of all Evils, which\nif they do not com1r.it, flill ia their Spirit they think\nthem allowable, and therefore do them in the BoJy,\nwhen the Confideration of Dignity and Honour, and\nthe Fear of the Law do not .prevent: And what is\nmore, the Lo\\'e of Dominion gr_ouaded in the Love\nof s~If intimately conceals within it Hatred againfr\nGoti,\n\f288 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNINC\nCod, confequently againft the Divine Things of the\nChurch, and efpecially againft the Lord ; if Perfons\ninfluenced by this Love, acknowledge a God, they\ndo it only with their Mouths, and. if they acknowl~\nedge the Divine Things of the Church, they do it\ncnly for Fear of lofing Credit. The Reafon why\nthis Love intimately conceals in it Hatred againft the\nLord, is, becaufe it is the int;mate Property of this\ntoYe, to defire to be a God, for it worfhips and\nadores itfelf aione ; hence it is, that if any one hon-\nours it fo much, as to fay that it hath Divine Wif..:.\ndom, and is the Deity of the \\_Vorld, it loves fuch\nan one in its Heart. It is otherwife with the Love\nof Dignities and Riches for the Sake of Ufes ; this\nI.ove is cekftial, becaufe, as hath been obfenred, it is\nthe fame with the Love of\u2022one's Neighbour. By\nUfes arc rr.eant Go0ds, and therefore by doing Ufes,\nis meant to do Good ; and by doing Ufes or Good,\nis meant to ferve others and miuifter to them; they\n,x.\u00b7ho do fo, although tht:>y be in Dignity and in Op...\nulence, yet they refpea Dignity and Opulence only\nas 1Vleans of doing Ufes, confequently of ferving\nand miniftering. Thefe are they who are meant by\nthefe \\ Vords of tbt; Lord, \" Wbofoc'l.!er 'Zt.!ill be great\namong you, let him l\u2022e your Min!Jlcr; and u\u00b7hofoc\u00b7vcr\n'Zvill be chief among you, let bim be your Servant:,\nMatt. xx. 26, 27 : Thefe alfo are tney, to whom\nDominion in Heaven is entrufted by the Lord, for\nto them Dominion is the Means of doing Ufes, or\ndo!ng Good, confequently of fer\\'ing, and when\nUfes or Good are the Ends or Lo\\\u00b7es, then it is not\nthey who have Dominion, but the Lord, for all\nGood is from Hi:!1. FouRTHl-Y: That the Di.f.\nJerrmct:\n\f\/\nTnE DiviNE PRov!nENcE. ~s9\nfirence bet'1u::e:1 theni is djfficult to be !.:1to7.vn by 1\\Ian ;\nthe Reafon is, becaufe mofl: df thofe who are in\nDignity, and in Opulence, alfo p~rfcrm Ufes, but\nit is not known whether they,perform Ufes for the\nSake of themfelves, or for the Sake of Ufes ; and\nthe lefs fo, becaufe in the Love of Self and of the\nVvorld, there is niore of the Fire and Ardour of\nperforming Ufes, than in thofe who are not in the\nLove of Self and of the \\Vorld ; but the former\nperform Ufes for the Sake of Fame or lntereft,\ntherefore for the Sake of themfelves ; whereas they\nwho perforrti Ufes for the Sake of Ufes, or Good\nfor the Sake of Good, fuch do not perform them\nfrom themfelves; but from the Lord. The Differ-\nence between them is difficult to be known by Man,\nby Reafon that Man doth not know whether he is\nled of the Devil or of the Lord ; he who is led of\nthe Devil, doeth Ufes for the Sake of himfelf and\nthe \\Vorld, but he who is led of the Lord, doeth\nUfes for the Sake of the Lord and of Heaven ~ and\nall they do U:fes from the Lord, who fhun\nEvils as Sins, but all they do Ufcs from the Devil,\nwho do not f11Un Evils as Sins, for Evil is the Devil,\nancl Ufe or Good is the Lord: Hereby and n.:> oth-\nerwifc is the Difference known ; both in their ex-\nternal Form appear aLke, but in their internal Fornl\nthey are totally unlike ; one is like Gold which\ncontains within it Drofs, but the other is like Gold\nwhich contains within it pure Gold : And one is\nlike artificial Fruit, which in its external Form ap-\npears like Fruit gathered from a Tree, when nev-\nerthelefs it is coloured \u00b7wax, which hath within it\nDufl: or Refin ; but the other is like excellent Fruit,\nN N delightful\n\fz9o ANGELIC vVISDOi\\I CONCERNING\n\"delightful to the Tafl:e and Smell, which hath with..\n-\nin it Seeds.\n\u00b7 z 16. II. That Things eternal relate to Jpiritual\nHonours and Riches, which are of Love and TiV!fdom\nin Hca.-.;cn. Forafmuch as the natural Man calls\nthe Delights of Self-Love, which are alfo the De-\n.Eghts of the Concupifcences of \u00a3\\'il, Goods, and\nalfo confirms himfdf in the Notion that they are\nGoods, he therefore calls Honours and Riche~\nDivine Blc:ilings ; but when this natural Man fees\n\u00b7that the vVicked, as well as the Good, are ad-\nYacced to Honours, and promoted to Riches, and\nfrill more \u00b7when he fees that the Good are in Con-\ntempt and Poverty, and the Wicked in Glory and\nOpulence, he thi:1ks with himfelf, \u00b7what is the\n1\\leaning of this, it cannot be of the Divine Prov-\nidence, for if Divine Providence governed all\nThings, it would load the Good \\Vith Honours and\n\\Vealth, and a:G1ict the Wicked with Poverty and\nContempt, and fo compel the \u00b7wicked to aknowl-\nedge that there is a God and a Divine Providence.\nBut \u00b7 the natural :Man, unlef:; illurninated by the\nfpiritual Man, that is, unlefs he is at the fame\nTime fpiritual, doth not fee that Honours and\nRiches may pofiibly be Bleffings ; and that poffibly\nt_hey :nay alfo be Curfes ; and that when they are\nBleffings they are from God, and when they are\nCurfes they are from the Devil ; that Honours and\n\"\\Vealth are alfo given by the Devil, is known, for\nthence he is called the Prince of this \u00b7warid. Now\nwhereas it is not known when Honours and Riches\nare Bleffings, and when they are Curfes, therefore\n.it !hall be !hewn; but in this Order. 1. That\nHonours\n\fTHl2 DIVINE PROVIDENCE~\u00b7 ~9X\nHonours and Riches are Bleffings, and that they\nare Curfes. :::!. That Honours and Riches, when\nthey arc l3l.:!ilin6s, arc fpirin.1al and eternal, and\nthat when they arc C'.lrfes, they are tempor:uy and\np\"ri!hing. 3\u00b7 That tl:e Bonours and Riches,\n' 'b. h arc Curfcs, in Co:npari!on with the Honours\nan Riches \\Vhich are Bldiings, are as Not]1ing to\nen:ry Thi\"z, or as that which in itfelf doth not\ncxi:':, to that ;; hich in itfelf doth exiit.\nz I 7. \\Ve fhall now proceed to the Illufiration of\nthefe three Points. FIRST : 'Tbat Ho11ours and\nRiches 'are BldJings, and th.1t they are Curfes : Com-\nmon .Experience tcftifies, that the Pious as well as\nthe Impious, or the Juft as well as the Uujufi, that\nis, the Good as well as the \\Vicked, arc in Dignities\nand Riches ; and yet it cannot be denied by any\none, that the Impious and Unjufi, that is, the\n\\Nicked, go to Hell, and the Pious and Jufi, that\nis, the Good, to Heaven : Fo!afmuch as t11is is\ntrue, it follows, that Dignities and Riches, or Hon-\nours and Opulence, are either Bleilings or Curfes,\nand that with the Good they are Bleffings, and\nwith the Wicked Curfes. In the W ark concern-\ning HEAVEN AND HELL, publifhed in London in\nthe Year I 758, n. 357 to 365, it is fhewn, that\nthere are Rich as well as Poor, and Great as well\nas Little in Heaven, and alfo in Hell ; from which\nit is evident, that Dignities and Riches, 'with thofc\nwho are in Heaven, in this \\Vorld \\Vete Ble11ings,\nand that with thofe v. ho are in Hell, in this \u00b7world\nwere Curfes. But whence it is th:J.t they are Blef-\nfings, and whence that they are Curfcs, every one\nmay know, provided he thia!>.s a little on the Sub-\njeCt\n\f'292 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING.\njefr from Reafon ; namely, that they are B!effings\nwith thofe w~o do not not place their Hearts in\nthem, and that they are Curfes with thofe who do\nplace their Hearts in them ; to place the Heart in\nihem, is to love ~elf in them~ and not to place the\nHeart in them, is to lov~ Ufes and not Self in them:\nThe Nature and ~ality of the Difference betw.een\nthefe two Loves, \\vas explained above, n. 2 1 5 ; to\nwhich may be added, that Dignities and Riches fe-\nduce fome, and fome they d~ not feduce; they feduce,\n'\\\u00b7;hen they excite the Loves of Man's Pr~prium,\nwhich i~ rhe Love of Self, and that this is th~ Love\nof Hell, which is called the Devil, -~vas alfo !hewn\nabove ; but they do not feduce, when they do no~\nexcite that Love. The Reafon whv the Wicked as\n. b. J\nwell as the Good are advanced to Honours and pro-\nmoted to Riches, is, becaufe the '\\Vicked as well as\nthe Good perform Ufes, but the Wicked do fo for:\nthe Sd:e of the Honour and Interel1: of their own\nPerfons, whereas the C ood for the Sake of the Bon-:\nour and Interel1: of the Thing itfelf: The latter re-\nfpeB: the Honour and Interefl: of the ~fhing itfelf,\n?S principal Ca:ufes, and the Honour and Interefl: of\ntheir own Perfons as infl:rumental Caufes; but the\nWicked refpeCl: the Honour and lnterefl: of their\nown Perfons ~s principal Caufes, and the Honour\n:md lnterefl: of the Thing itfelf as infl:rumental\nCaufes : But who doth not fee, that the Perfon, his\nFunction and Honour, is for the Sake of the Thing\nwhich he adminifl:ers, and not vice veifa?

That thefe two cannot be joined to;;\ngether but by the infinite \\Vifdom of the Lord, and\ntherefore that they can be joined together by the\nLord, and not by Man, every one inay fee. But\nthat it may be known, that thefe two are feparated\nby Man, and joirieq by the Lord, it !hall be demon~\nfl:rated in the following Order. 1. What temporary\nThings are, and what Things eternat z. That Man\nis temporary in himfelf, and that the Lord in Him-\nfelf is eternal ; and that therefore Nothing can pro~\neeed from Man but wha:t is temporary; and Nothing\nfrom the Lord but what is eternal. 3\u2022 That tem-\nporary Things feparate Things eternal from them\u2022\nfclves, and that Things eternal join temporary\nThings to themfelves. 4\u00b7 That the Lord joinetlt\nMan to Himfelf by Appearance~. 5\u00b7 And by Cor..\nrefponc.lences\u2022\n' 219. But thefe Propofitions ate feveraify to be\nillufl:rated and confirmed by themfelves. FIRST ~\nH'hat temporary 'Things are, and what 'Things eternal :\u00b7\nTemporary Things are all thofe Things which are\nproper to Nature, and thence proper to Man :.\nThings proper to Nature are efpecially Spaces and\nTimes, both fubjeB: to Limits and Terminations~\nthe Things which are thence proper to Man, are the\nThings of his proper Will and his proper Under~\nfl:anding, and which are thence of his Affetl:ion and\nThought, and efpecially the Things which are of\nhis own Prudence ; which things, that they are\nfinite and limited, is well known. But Things\neterntJ.l are all Things which are proper to the Lord,\nand from him are as i~ were proper-to Man: Things\nproper to the Lord are all infinite and eternal,\ntherefore\n\fTrrt DtvrxE PRovrnExcE. . 297\nth;:!rcfore without Time, confequently ,dthout\nLimit and without E1rd : The Things wh:ch\nthence are feemingly proper to 1\\'Ian, in like\nManner are infinite and eternal ; but Nothing of\nthefe is of Man, but of the Lord alone in him.\nSECONDLY: 'Tbat Nlmz is tempo!Ylry in binife!f, and\nthat tbe Lord in Himfe!f is eternal; and tbat tberifore\nl{othing can proceedfrom lvlan. but what iJ temporary,\nand Nothing from tbe Lord but wbat i.r eternal. That\nMan in himfelf is temporary, and the Lord in Him~\nfelf eternal, was faid above ; inafmuch as Nothing\nelfe can proceed from any one but what is in him,\nit follows, that from l\\Ian Nothing can proceed but\nwhat is temporary, and from the Lord Nothing but\nwhat is eternal ; for infinite cannot proceed from\nfinite, and to fuppofe that it can is a Contradiuion ;\nand yet infinite can proceed from finite, yet not\nfrom finite itfelf, but from infinite through it; fo\non the other Hand, finite cannot proceed fran] in-\nfinite, and to fuppofe this is alfo a Contradiuion ;\nyet finite can be produced by infinite, but this is not\nto proceed but to be created ; on which Subject\nfee THE ANGELIC \\VrsDOM CONCERNING THI:\nDIVINE LovE AND THE DIVINE \\VISDOM, from\nBeginning to End : \\Vherefore if finite proceeds\nfrom the Lord, as is the Cafe in many Things with\nMan, it doth not proceed from the Lord, but from\n.i\\Ian ; and it may be faid to proceed from the\nLord through Man, becaufe it fo appears. This\nmay be illuftrated by thefe words of the Lord,\n\"Let your Communication be yea, ye:t; nay, nay;\nfor whatfoever is more than thefe, cometh of Evil,\"\nMatt. Y. 3i; fuch is the Communication. of all in\n0 o the\n\f~9? ANGELIC \\VISDO~l CONCERNING\nthe third Heaven ; for they never reafon concern\u00b7\ning Things Divine, whether they be fo or not, but\nfee in themfelve9\" from the Lord, that they are fo\ncr not fo ; Reafoning concerning Things Divine,\nwhether they be fo or not, proceeds from the Rea~\nfoner's not feeiag \u00b7them from the Lord, but defiring\nto fee them from himfdf, and that v.-hich Man\nfceth from himfelf, is Evil. But yet the Lord will-\nerh, not only that Man fhould think and fpeak of\nThings Divine, but alfo reafon concerning them,\nto the End that he may fee that they are fo or not\nfo ; and fuch Thought, Difcourf~; or Reafoning,\nprovided it h2th for its End that he may fee the\nTruth, may be faid .to be from the Lord in Man,\nbut it is from l\\Ian, until he fees Truth, and ac-\nknowledges it : In the mean Time it is fr'om thtt\nLord alone, that Man is capable of thinking,\nfpeaking, and reafoning : for this he can do by\nVirtue of his two Faculties, called Liberty anJ Ra-\ntionality, which Faculties Man poifeifes from the\nLord Alone. THIRDLY : 'That temporary Things\nJcparatc 'Things eternal from tben!felvcs, a7td tbat\u00b7\n'Tbings eternal join temporar)' 'Things to themfducs :\nBy temporary Things feparating Things eternal\nfrom thcmfelves, is meant, that Man who is tem-\nporary doeth fo from the temporary Things in\nhimfclf; and by Things eternal joining temporary\nThings to themfelyes, is meant, that the Lord, who\nis eternal, doeth fo from the Things ~ternal in\nhimfelf, as was faid above. In the preceding\nPages it was \/hewn, that there is a ConjunCtion of\nthe Lord with Man, and a reciprocal ConjunClion\nof Man with the Lord ; yet that the reciprocal -\nConjunCtion\n\f\u00b7 Tm~ DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 299\nConjunction of Man with the Lord is not from\nl\\lan, but from the Lord ; alfo that the Will of\nMan is in Oppofition to the Will of the Lord, or\nwhat amounts to the fame, that the Self-derived\nPrudence of M:.m is in Oppofition to the Divine\nProvidence of the Lor.d ; from \\vhich this Conclu-\nfion refults as a Confequence, tn:1t Man, from his\nown temporary Things, feparates from himfelf the\neternal Things of the Lord, but that the Lord join-\ncth his eternal Things to the temporary Things of\nMan, that is, joineth Himfdf to Man and 1\\hn to\nHimfclf: As this Subject hath been fully treated of\nbefore, there is no Need of adding to it further\nConfirmation. FeuR THLY : 'That the J,ord joinetb\nMan to Himfelj by Appearances : For it is an Ap-\npearance that Man from himfelf lO\\\u00b7erh his Neigh-\nbour, doeth Good, and fpeal:cth Truth ; if thefe\nThings were not to appear to a Man as from himfelf,\nhe would not love l)is Neighbour, nor do Good,\nnor fpeal::.

IV. That the Conjuntlicn of Things temporary\nand eternal in klan is the Divine Providence of the\nLord: As the Things herein implied cannot fall\nwithin rhe\u2022firfl: Perception of the Underfianding,\nexcept they be firfl: reduced to Order, and unfold-\ned and demon!l:rated according to it, therefore the\nOrder thereof !hall be as follows. 1. That it is bv\nVirtue of the Divine Providence, that Man by\nDeath puts off Things natural and temporary, and\nputs on Things fpiritual and eternal. 2. That the\nLord by his Divine Providence joincth himfelf to\nThings natural by Things fpiritual, and to Things\ntemporary by things eternal according to Ufes.\n3\u00b7 That the Lord joincth himfelf to Ufes by ~or..\nrefpondences, and fo by Appearances according to\nConfirmations by 1\\lan. + That fuch ConjunCtion\nof Things temporary and eternal is the Divine Prov,.\nidence. But thefe Points !hall be placed in a clear-\ner Light by Explanations. FIRST; That it is by\nYirtue 'oj tbe Dh\u2022bze Pro'Vidence, tbat 1\\1m: by Deatb\nputs qff 'lhings natural and temporary, and puts OIJ\n'Things Jpirltual' and eternal : Things natural and\ntemporary are Extremes and Ultimates, into which\n1\\'Ian firfl enters, which is the Cafe when he is born,\nto the End that he may afterwards be introduced\nto Things interior and fuperior ; for Extremes and\nUltimates are Continents ; and thefe exifl: in the\nnatural World : Hence it is that no Angel or Spirit\nwas immediately created fuch, but that they were\nall firfl: born Men, and fo introduced ; hence they\nhave Extremes and Ultimates, which in themfelve~\nare\n\fTIIE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. JOl\nare fixed and !l:ated, within which and by which\ntheir Interiors can be contained in their State of\nConnexion. But Man firfr puts on the groifer\nSubfl:ances or Nature, his Body collfifring of them ;\nthere however he putteth off by Death, and retain-\neth the purer Subfrances of Nature, which are next\nto what is fpiritual, and thea thefc are his Conti-\nnents. Befides, in Extremes, or Ultimates, all\nThings interior or fuperior rcfidc together at once,\nas was ihewn before in its proper Place ; wherefore\nevery Operation of the Lord is from Primaries and _\nUltimates at once, therefore in Full. But foraf-\nmuch as the Extremes and Ultimates of Nature\ncannot recci\\\u00b7e Things fpiritual and eternal, for\n'which the human Mind is formed, as they are in\nthemfelves, and yet Man is born that he may be\nmade fpiritual and live to Eternity, therefore Mall\nputteth them off, and retaincth only interior natural\nThings or Subfrances, which are convenient and\naccord with Things fpiritual and celeflial, and fe:rve\nthem as Continents ; this is effecred by the Rejec-\ntion of temporary and natural Ultimates, which is\nthe Death of. the Body. SECONDLY : Tbat the\nLord by his Divine Pro'vidcncc joincth 1-iin!ftlj to\nThings natural by ThingsJpiritua!, and to Things tem-\nporary by Tbings eternal according to Ufes : Natural\nand temporary Things are not only Things which\nare proper to Nature, but alfo the Things which are\nproper to 1\\lcn in the natural \\Vorld ; both thcfe\nMan putteth off by Death, and putteth on Things\nfpirit,!lal and eternal correfponding to them ; that he\nputteth on thefe according to Ufes:, is fully ihewri in\nthe foregoing _P:::;es. The natural Things \u00b7which arc\nproper\n\f.T'\n302 ANGELIC \\VISDOM C'ONCERNING\nproper to Nature, rebte in general to Time and\nSpace, and in particular to the ObjeCts which are\nfeen upon Earth ; thefe Man leaveth by Death, and\nin place of them receiveth Things fpiritual, which\nas to their outward Face or Appearance are fimilar,\nbut not ~s to their internal ~ality and Eficnce ;\nwhich Subject alfo is treJ.ted of above. The tern~\nporary Thing~, which are proper to 1\\len in the.\nnatural \\Vorld, in general relate to Dignities and\nRiches, and in particular to the Necefiities of each\nIndividual, which arc Food, Cloathing,\u00b7 and a Place.\nto dwell in ; thefe alfo :J.re put away and left by\nDeath, and fuch Things put on and received, as are\nfimilar to them as to their out\\ovard Face or Ap~\npearance, but not as to their internal Q:rality and\nE!Tcnce : All thefe derive their internal ~ality and\nE!fence from the Ufes of Things temporary in the\n\\Vorld : Ufes are the Goods which are called\nGoods of Charity. Hence it may appear, that to\nThings natural and temporary the Lord by his Di~\nvine Providence joineth Things fpiritual and eternal\naccording to Ufes. THIRDLY : That t\/;e Lordjoin.\netb bi1J!ft!f to l!fes by CorrcJpondcnccs, and fo by Ap~\npearanccs accGrding to the Co7!.firmations thereof by\n},fan : As this Point cannot but feem obfcurc to\nthofe who have not yet acquired a clear Notion of\nwhat Correfpondence and what Appearance is,\ntherefore it !hall be illufl:rated by Example and fo\nexplained : All Things in the \\Vord arc mere Cor..\nrcfpondences of Things fpiritual and celdlial, and\nforafmuch as they are Correfpondences, they are\nalfo Appearances ; that is, all Things in the \\Vord\nare Di\\\u00b7ine Goods cf the Divine I.c\u00b7;c, aed DiYin~\nTruths\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. J03\n'truths of the Divine \\i\\Tifdom, which arc m.k.ed in \u2022\nthemfelves, but cloathed in the literal Senfe of the\n\\Vord ; wherefore they appear like a Man in a\nGarment, which correfponds to the State of his\nLove and \\Vifdom ; from which Confideration it\nis evident th~t if a Man confirms Appearances, it is\njufl: as if he were to confirm that Garments are\n1\\'len ; hereby Appearances bec.ome Fallacies: It is\nothcrwi[e if a Man fearches after Truths and fees\nthem in Appearances. Now forafmuch as all Ufes,\nor Truths and Goods of Charity, which a Man do~\neth to his Neighbour, he either doeth according to\nAppearances, or according to the Truths themfeh\u00b7es\nin the vVord, if he efi:abli!hcs the Confirmation of\nthem in himfelf acconling to .Appearances, he is in\nFallacies, but if according to Truths, he doeth as\nhe ought to do : Hence it may appear, \u00b7what is\nmeant by the Lord's joining himfelf to Ufes by Cor-\nrefpondences, aud fo by Appearances, according to\nthe Confirmations thereof by Man. FouRTHLY :\nThat fucb Cor.junClion ofThings temporary and eternal\nis the Divine Pro<t\u2022idence : That this may be prefent-\netl to the Underftanding in fome Degree of Light,\nit may be expedient to illuflrate it by two Exam~\nples, by one which concerns Dignities and Hon-\nours, and by another which concerns Riches a~d\nPoffeffions; both thef~ in their external Form arc\nnatural and temporary, but in their interual Form\nfpiritual anJ eternal. Dignities with their Han~\nours are natural and temporary, when a Man per-\nfonally refpeEts himfelf in them, and not the State\nand Ufes, for then a Man cannot but think. interi-\norly with himfelf, that the State was made for him,\nand\n\fjo4 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nand not he for the State ; \u00b7he is like a King who\nthinks his Kingdom and all the Men in it are for\nhim, anti not he for the Kingdom and the Men of\nwhich it confifl:s. But the fame Dignities with their\nHonours are fpiritual and eterm.l, when a Man re-\nfpects himfelf perfonally as fubfervient to the State\nand to Ufes, and not them to him ; if he doeth this,\nthen he is in the Truth and in the Effence of his\nDignity and Honour ; but if the other, then he i~\nin Correfponclence and Appearance, which if he\nconfirms i:1 himfelf, he is in Fallacies, and no other~\nwife in Conjuntl:ion with the Lord, than they who\nare in Falfes and Evils derived therefrom, for Falla-\ncies are Falfes with which Evils join themfelves :\nSuch Perfons do indeed perform Ufes and do Good,\nbut from themfelves and not from the Lord, there.\nf~re they put themfelves in the Place of the Lord :\nIt is the fame with Riches and Poffeilions, which\nalfo are natural and temporary, as well as fpiritual\nand eternal ; Riches and Poffe!Iions are natural and\ntemporary with thofe, who refpect them alone, and\nthemfelves in them, and in thefe two place all their\nI;leafure and Delight ; but the fame are fpiritual and\neternal with thofe, who refpea good Ufes in them,\nand in thefc an interior Pleafure and Delight ; with\nthefe latter the exterior Pleafure and Delight alfo is\nmade fpiritual, and temporary eternal ; wherefore\nalfo thefe after Death dwell in Heaven, and in Pal-\naces there, the Utenfi.Is of which are refplendent\nwith Gold and precious Stones ; which neverthelefs\nthey regard no otherwife than as Externals deriving\ntheir Splendour and Tranfparency from Internals,\nwhich are Ufes, from which they have effential Pleaf.\nure\n\fTzu DIVINE PRdVID.LNci\\. 305\nure and Delight, which in themfelves are the Blifs\nand Happinefs of Heaven: A contrary Lot is theirs,\nwho have refpeCl:ed Riches and Poifeffions folely for\ntheir own Sake and for the Sake of Self, therefore\nfor the Sake of Externals and not at the fame Time\nof Internals1confequently according to Appearances\nand not according to their Eifences ; fuch Perfons,,\nwhen they put off thefe Things, as is the Cafe when\nthey die, put on the lnternals thereof, \\vhich, inaf-\nmuch as they are not fpiritual, \u00b7cannot be otherwife\nthan infernal, for either the one ot the other Princi-\nple is in them, inafmuch as both cannot be there\ntogether, wherefore infl:ead of Riches they experi\u00b7\nence Poverty, and irtflead of Pofle!Iions Mifery. By\nUfes are meant not only the Neceffaries of Life,\n- which relate to Food, Cloathing, an Habitation for\na Man's Self and his Family, but alfo the Good of\nhis Country, of Society, and of his Fellow Citizens.\nSuch a Good is Commerce, when it is the final\nLove, and Money the )\\<leans fubfervient, if fa \u00b7be\nthe Merchant fuunneth and avoideth Frauds and\nevil Arts as Sins ; nbt fa when Money is the final\n-Love, and Commerce the Means fubfervient to it,\nfor this is Avarice, which is the Root of a1l Evils,\nas may be _feen in Luke xii. 15, and the Parable\nconcerning it, Verfe 16 to 21.\nPP 'That\n\f306 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERl'HN'd\nThat l\\1an is not let more interiorly into\nthe Truths of Fait!L and the Goods\u00b7if\nCharil)', thanjojar as he can he kept\nin them to the End of Life.\n221. ITis well known in the Chrifiian World1\nthat the Lord willeth the S<:.lvation of all,.\nand alfo that he is Omnipotent, \\vherefore many\u00b7\nconclude thence, that he is able to fave every one,\nand does fave thofe who implore his Mercy, efpe...\ncially thofe who implore it by the received Form of\nFaith, that God the Father would have Mercy for\nthe s~ke of his Son, parricularly if at the fame Time\nthey implore that they may receive that Faith ~ But\nthat the Cafe is altogether different, will be feen in\nthe laft Article of this Treatife, where it will be ex-\np!ained how that the Lord cannot act againfi the\nLaws of his Divine Providence, becaufe to act againfi\nthofe L::tws, would be to aa againfi his Divine Love\nand his Divine Wifdom, confequently again!l him..\nfelf; in the fame Place it will be feen, that fuch\nimmediate Mercy is not poffible, becaufe the Sal-\nvation of Man is effeB:ed by Means, according to\nwhich no other Perfon can lead Man, but He who\nwilleth the Salvation of all, and at the fame Time\nis Omnipotent, confequently the Lord. The Means\nby which Man is led of the Lord, are what are call..\ned the Laws of the Divine Providence, among which\nis alfo this, that Man is not let more interiorly into\nthe Truths of Wifdom and the Goods of Love, than\nfo far as he can be kept in them to the End of Life. ...\nBut \u00b7\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 307\nBut that this may be evident to Reafon, it !hall be\nexplained in the following Order : 1. Th:tt Man\nmay be let into the \\Vifdom of fpiritual :rhings, :md\nalfo into the LoYe of them, and yet not be reform-\ned. 2. That If Man aftenvards recedes from them,\nand runs counter to them, he profancth what iE:\nfacred. 3\u00b7 That there arc feveraf Kinds of Profa-\nnations, but that this Kind is the worfi: of all. 4\u2022\nThat therefore the Lord doth not let Man more in-\nteriorly into the Truths of Wifdom, and at the fame\nTime into the Goods of LoYe, than fo far as he can.\nbe kept in them to the End of Life.\n222. I. 'That Man may be let into the Wifdom qf\nJpiritual 'Things, and alfo into the Love qf them, and\nyet not be reformed \u00b7' The Reafon is, becaufe Man\nhath Rationality and Liberty ; by Rationality he\ncan be elevated into \\Vifdom almofl: Angelic, and\nby Liberty into a Love not tlnlike Angelic Love ;\nbut fiill fuch as the Love is, fuch is the \\Vifdom ;\nif the Love is celefl:ial and fpiritual, the Wifdom\nalfo becometh celefl:ial and fpiritual ; but if the\nI~ove is diabolical and infernal, the Wifdorr1 alfo is\ndiabolical and infernal ; the latter indeed may then\nappear in its external Form, and confequently be-\nfore others, as celefl:ial and ipiritual, but in its in-\nternal Form, which is its very Effence, it is diaboli-\ncal and infernal, not outwardly but imvardly ; that\nit is fuch, doth not appear to Men, becaufe 1\\len are\nnatural, and fee and hear_naturally, and the exter-\nnal Form is natural ; but that it is fuch, doth ap-\npear to the Angels, becaufe the Angels <:re fpiritual,\nand the internal Form is fpiritual. Hence it is evi.-\nqent, th~t Man might be let into the \"\\Yifdom of\nfpiritual\n\f308 ANG.E'LIC \\Vrs:pOM CONC:ERNING\nfpiritual Things, and alfo into the Love of them~\nand yet not be reformed, but in this Cafe only into\nthe natural, and not the fpiritual Love of them ;\nthe Rcafon is, becaufe Man can let himfelf into nat-\nural Love, but the Lord alone can let him into fpi~\nritual ~ave, and they who are let into the latter,\nare reformed, but they who ar!! only let into the\nfvrmer, are not reformed ; for thefe Iall: are for the\nmofl: Part Hypocrites, and mZ:ny of them of the\nOrder of Jefuits, who interiorly do not bdieve any\nThing Divine, but exteriorly they play with Divine\nThings like thofe who exercife themfdves in Leger-:\ndemain [ Harioli.]\n223. By much Experience in the fpiritual \u00b7world\nit hath be~n given to know, that Ma11 polieffes in\nhimfelf the Faculty of underfl:anding the Arcana of\n\\,Vifdom, like the Angels themfelves ; for I have\nfeen fiery DeYils, who, when they heatd Arcana of\nWifdom, not only underfrood them, but alfo fpake \u00b7\nthem from their own Rationality ; but as foon as\nthey returned to their diabolical Love, they did not\nunderfrand them, but infl:ead of them Things con~\ntrary thereto, ~hich were lnfanities, and this they\nthen calle0. Wifdom: Yea, it hath been given to\nhear them, wb'en they were in a State of \\Vifdom,\nlaugh at their own Infanity, and when they were in\na State of Infanity, laugh at \\V\"ifdom. A Man, who\nhath been fuch in this World, after Death when he\n. becomes a Spirit, for the n~oft Part i's let into alter~\nnate States of \\V\"ifdom and Infanity, that he may\ndifl:inguifh the one from the other : But although\nfrom Wifdom they fee their Infanity, yet when their\nPrtion is given them) as it is to every one, they put\nthemfelves\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 309\nthemfelves into a State of Infanity, and love it, and\nthen they hate a State of \\Vifdom : The Rea.fon is,\nbecaufe their Internal was diabolical, and their Ex-\n'=rnal like as it were Divine : Thefe are they who\nare meant by Devils, who pretend to be Angds\nof Light ; and by him, who at the Marriage had\nnot on a \\Vedding Garment, and was cafl: into\nouter Darknefs, Matth. xxii. 1 I, 12, 13\u00b7\n224. vVho cannot fee, that it is the Internal\nfrom which the External exifl:s, confequent1y that\nthe External hath its Eifence from the Internal ?\nAnd who doth not know by Experience, that the\n\u00b7 External can appear otherwife than according to\nits E!fence from the Internal ? This is manifeit in\nthe Cafe of Hypocrites, Flatterers, and Diifemblers;\nand that Man can aifume a CharaCter not his own\nin Externals, is evident from Players and Mimits,\nfor they can reprefent Kings, Emperors, yea An-\ngels, in their Tone of Voice, Speech, Face, and\nGefl:ure, as ~hough they were really fuch; when\nneverthelefs they are Nothing but Imitators ; thefc\nObfervations are made, becaufe Man' in like 1\\'lan-\nner can play the Sycophant, as well in Matters of a\ncivil and moral as of a fpiritual Nature ; and more-\nover it is well known, that this is the Cafe with\nmany. Therefore inafmuch as the Internal. in its\nEifence is infernal, and the External in its Form\nappears fpiritual, and yet the External derives its\nEifence from the Internal, as wz.s obferved, it may\nbe afked where that Effence lies concealed in the\nExternal ? It doth not appear in the Geflure, nei-\nther in the Tone of Voice, nor in the Speech, nor\n~n the Face, but yet it lies concealed interiorly in\nthem.\n-\n\f310 ANGELIC VvrsnoM coNcEn.~rNo\nthem all four : That it lies interiorly concealed in\nth em~ is evident from the Cafe of fuch Perfons in\nthe fpiritual World ; for when Man cometh out of\n\u2022he natural 'World into the fpiritual \\Vorld, whi~\n:s the Cafe when he dies, then he leaveth his Ex..,\ntern~ls with his Body, and retains\u00b7 his Internals.\n'vhich he had treafured up in his Spirit, and then,\njf his Internal was infernal, he a\u00b7ppears a Devil,\nfuch as he had alfo been as to his Spirit, when he\nJi\\\u00b7ed in the \\\\Torld. \\Vho doth 11ot acknowledge,.\nthat every Man leaveth Externals with his Body,\nand enters into Interm.ls when he becometh a Spi-\nrit? To this I may add, that in the fpiritual \\Vorld\nthere is a Communication cf Affed:ions and of\nThoughts derived from them, whe:Pce it js that no\nor.e can fpeak otherwife than he thinks: Alfo, that\nevery one there clnnz,ctlc his Face, and Lecome s\nfimilar to his l:..ued:ion, fo that from his Face alfo it\nappears what he is: Hypocrites are fometimes per-\nmitted to fpeak otherwife than they think, but the\nSound of their Voice is altogether difcordant to the\nInteriors ef their Thought~, and from that Difcord-\nance they arc difcovered: lienee it may appear, that\nthe Internal lies concealed interiorly in the Tone,\nSpeech, Face, and external G'eflure, and that this is\nnot perceived by Men in the natural \\Vorld, bu~\nmanife!l:ly by the Angels in the fpiritual \\Vorld.\n225. Hence then it is evident, that :Man, fo long\nas he lives in the natural \\Vorld, can be let into the\n\\Vifdom of friritual Things, and alfo into the LoYe\nof them; and that this may and can be done, ets\n.,.,,11 \"INith .thofc who are merely natural, as with\nthdt: \\\\ ho are fpiritt:al; but with this Diifercnce,\nthat\n\fTHE DIVIN I!

II. 'That if lvian afterwards recedes from\nthem, and runs counter to them, he profaneth 'U'hat is\nbol)'. There are feveral Kinds of Profanation of\nwhat is Holy, of which in the following Article;\nbut this Kind is the mofl: grievous of all, for they\nwho are Profaners of this Kind, after Death be-\ncome no longer Men 1 they live indeed, but con\u00b7\ntinually in a phaP..tafl:ical Delirium, and appear to\nthemfelves to be flying on high, and when they arc\nfrill, they play with Phantafies, which are feen by\nthem as Things real; and forafmuch as they are\nuo longer Men, they are not called He and She,\nbut It : Yea, when they are fcen in the Light ef\nHeaven, they appear like Skeletons, fame like S!\\:elc.\ntons of a bony Colour, fome fiery, and fome dry.\nThat they who are guilty of this Kind of Profan::1tion\nbecome fuch after Death, i> not known in the \\Vorld,\nand it is not known by Realon that the Caufe of it\nis not knO\\vn ; the Caufe of it is, that when a Man\nfirfi acknowledges Divine Things, and believes them,\nand afterwards recedes and denies them, then he\nmixeth Things holy with profane ; which, when\n' they\n\f3I 2 ANGELIC \\VrSDOM CONCERNING\nthey are mixed, cannot otherwife be feparated, than\nby the DeftruB:ion of the whole. But t~at this\nmay be mdre clearly perceived, it fhall be explain-\ned in the following Ordet : 1. That whatfoever a\nl\\:lan thinketh, fpeaketh, and doeth from his \\Viii, is\nappropri::tted to him and remaineth, as well Good\nas Evil. 2. That the Lotd by his Divine Provi-\ndence continually providelh and difpofeth, that E~\nvii m.ay be by itfelf, and Good by itfe1f, and fo that\nthey may be feparated. 3\u00b7 That this cannot be\ndone) if Man firfi: acknowledgeth the Truths of\nFaith, and liveth according to them, and afterwards\nrecedeth and denieth thein. 4\u00b7 That in this Cafe\nhe mixeth Good and Evil in fuch a Manner that\nthey cannot be feparated. 5\u00b7 And forafmuch as\nGood and Evil \\vith evety Man are to be feparated:i\nand in fuch a one cannot be feparated, therefore he\nis deftroyed as to every Thing truly Human.\n227. Thefe are the Caufes why a Thing fo enor~\ntnous exifts, but forafmuch as thefe Caufes are in\nObfcurity by Reafon of the Ignorance thereof, they\nfhall be explained, in Order .that they may be ev-\nident to the Underfl:anding. FIRST: That what~\nfoever a 1\\lfan thinketh, fpcaketh, and doeih from his\nWill, is appropriated to him and nmaineth, as\u00b7 'l.vell\nGood as Evil: This was fhewn above, n. 78 to 8 I :\nFor Man hath an external or natural Memory, and\nan internal or fpiritual Memory ; in this lafl: Memo-'\nry are infcribed all and every -Thing whatfoever\nthat he had thought, fpoken, and done in the\n\\Vorld from his \\Vill, and that fo perfea!y as to ev-\nery Particular, that no one Thing is wanting ; this\nMemory is the Book of his Life, which after Death is _\nopened,\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE.\nopened, and according to which he is judged.\nConcerning this .Memory more is adduced in the\n\\Vork on HEAVEN AND HELL, n. 4.61 to 465, from\nmy own Experience. SECONDLY: But that the\nLord by his Di-vine Providence continualiy providetb\nalld d!fpofeth, that Evil 11iay be by itfelf, and-Good by it-\nfelf, andJo that they may beJeparatcd: ~very Man is\nas well in Evil as in Good, for he is in Evil ftoni\nhimfelf, and in Good from the Lord, and Man can.;\nriot live unlefs he be in both, for if he were in him-\n'felf alorie, and fo in Evil alone, he would not have\n~ny. :Life, and if he we1\u00b7e in the Lord aione, and fo\nin Good alone, neither would he have any Life, for\nMa!l in the hztter ~ind .of Life would be zs it were\nfuffocated continually gafping f~r .Breath,or likeone\nin the Agonies of Death ; ,and in, the former Kind\nof Lift he . would be ~xtinet, for Evil without any\nGood in itfelf is dead, wherefore every Man is in\nboth; but the Difference is, that one is interiorly in\ntheLord, and exteriorly as if in himfelf, and anoth..;\ner is interiorly in himfelf, but exteriorly as if in the\nLord, and the latter is in Evil and the former in\nGood, yet each is in each; the Reafoti why this is\nal(o the Cafe with a wicked Man, is, hecaufe he is\nin the Good of civil and moral Life, and alfo exte..\nriorly in fome Good of fpiritual Life ; befides that\nhe is kept in Rationality and Liberty by the Lord, in\nbrdet that he may have the Power of being in\nGood ; this is th~ Good, by which every Man, even\nthe \\Vicked, Is ied of the Lord. From thefe Con..\nfiderations it may be feen, that the Lord feparateth\nEvil and Good, that the one may be interior and\nthe other exterior, and fo provideth that they be\nQ..Q.. not\n\f3I4 ANGELIC \\VISDO:r-1 CONCERNING\nnot mixed. THIRDLY: But that this cannot be done,\nif ManJidl ackno\u00b7,dedgeth the Truths of Faitb, and\nlivetb according to them, and after'Wards receddh and\ndenictl; them : This is evident from what hath nO\\V\nbeen faid ; firfi, that every Thing which a Man'\nthitikcth, fpeaketh, and doeth from the Will,. is ap\u2022\npropriated to him and remaineth ; and fecondly-r\nthat the Lord by his Divine Providence continually\nprovideth, and fo difpofeth Th1ngs, that Good may\nbe by itfdf, and Evil by itfelf, and that they may be\nfeparated ; moreover they are feparated by the Lord\nafter Death ; from thofe who are interiorly evil and\nexteriorly good, the good i1 taken away, and fo they'\nare left in their Evil; the Cafe is reverfed with\nthofe who are interiorly good, and exteriorly like\nother.Men have acquired \\Vcalth, fought after Dig~\nnities, been delighted with various worldly Things~\nand have favoured fome Co:1cupifcenees ;.\u00b7 in thefe\nneverthelefs Good and Evil <l>'e not mixed, but fepa-\nrate as internal and external; thus in their external\nForm they have been in many RefpeCl:s like the\n\\VickeJ, but yet not in their internal Form : So on\nthe other Hand the \\Vicked, who in their external\u00b7\nForm have appeared like the Good, in Regard to\nPiety, Di\\'ine \\Vorfhip, VIords and A ::lions, and\nyet in their internal Form have been wicked, in thefe\n<~.lfo the Evil i1- feparated from the Good. But in\nthoie, who have firfl acknowledged the Truths of\nFaith, and lived according to them, and afterwards\nhave run counter, anJ rejeCted them, and efpecially\nif they have denied them, Goods and E,\u00b7ils are no\u00b7\nlonger feparated, but mixed together ; for fuch a:\nMan hath appn?priated to himfelf Good, and alfo\u00b7\nhath\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDE~CE. 3IS\nhath appropriated to himfelf Evil, and fo hath join~\ned and mixed them. FouRTHLY : That in tbis\nCafe he mixctb Good and Evil, infuch a lvlanncr,tbat\nih:y can.n!)f befiparatcd, follows from what hath jufl:\n.now been faid ; and if Evil ca~not be feparatc:d\nfrom Good, and Good from Evil, he can neither\n.be in Heav~n nor in Hell ; every Man mull be\n~ither in one or the other, he cannot be in both,\nfor in that Cafe he would be one while in Heaven,\n~nd another while in Hell, and \\Vhen in Heaven he\n.would act in Favour qf Hell, and when in Hell he:\nwould aD: in FaYour of Heaven, and fo defhoy the\n.Life of all who were about him, the celefiial Life\nin the Angels, and the infernal Life in the Dedls,\ntvhereby the Life of every one would peri!h, for\nthe Li.fe of every one muft be his O\\Yl1, no one liv~\n~th in a Life fureign to his own, flill Iefs in one that\n, is oppofite~ Hence it is, that the Lord feparates in\n~xery one after Death, when he becometh a Spirit\npr a fpiritual Man, Good from Evil and Evil from\nGood ; Good from E\\\u00b7il in thofe who are interiorly\n~n Evil, and Evil fran) Good in thofe who are inte-\nriorly in Good ; which is according to his own\n\"\\Vm-ds, \"TYhqfocver bath, to bim jha\/1 be gi'l.'cn~ and\nbe jhall ba\"-'( more abundantly ; but whqfoever hath\nm t, from himfba{! be taken a7\n..cay, e'i.J\neJZ that be ha!b~\"\n1\\'latt. :xiii. 12.

Such Profaners however we ar~\nriot here treating of, but of thofe who profefs to\nbflie\\'C in God, who dl:ablifh the Sandity of the\n\\Vord, and who acknowledge the fpiritual Things\nof the Church, and yet do this for the mofl: Part\nonly with their Mouths : The Reafon why thcfe\nare guilty of Profanation, is, bccaufe what is holy\nout of the \u00b7word [SanDum ex Verba] is in them and\nwith them, and this which is in them, and whicq\nconfiitutes fame Part of their Underfianding and\n\"\\Viii, they profane ; whereas in the Impious, '\"'hq\ndeny the Dirinity an9- all Things Divine, there i~\nnot any Thing lfo1y for them to profane : Thefe\nindeed are Profaner.s, but ~hey are not the Proto\nfane.\n230.

That the ~ality of the State o.f\nLove and Wifdom,- or of Goodnefs and Troth, is\u00b7\nfignified by Name, is alfo evident from thefe \"\\vords'\nof the l.ord, \" He that entereth in by the Door is th~\nShepherd ofthe Sheep ; to him the Porter openeth; and.\nthe Sheep hear his Voice; and he callcth his own Sheep\u00b7\nby Name, and leadeth them out\/' John x~ 2', 3 ;- to\ncall his Sheep by Narne, is t.o teach and lead every\none who is in the Good of Charity; according to the\nState of his Love and \\Vifdom : By the Door i~\nmeant the Lord, as is evident from Verfe\u00b7 gth of\nthe fame Chapter, \"I am the Door: By M! ifany\n}.l[an enter in, he foal\/ be Javed\/' from which it is\nevident, that the Lord himfelf is to be approached;\nin Order that any one may be faved, and that he\nwho approacheth Him, i~ the Shepherd of the\nSJieep;\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 32I\nSheep; and he who doth not approach Him, is a\nThiefanda Robber, as it is faidin Vcrfe rftofthat\nChapter.\nz3 r. Forafmuch as by the Profanation of what\nis holy, is meant Profanation by tbofe who know\nthe Truths of Faith and Goods of Charity from the\n'\\Vord, and alfo in fome Meafure acknowledge them,\nand not they who do not know them, nor they who\nfrom Impi~ty entirely rejeCt them, therefore what\nfollows is faid not of the latter, but' of the former ;\nthe Kinds of Profanation by thefe are feveral,\nlighter and more grievous, but they may he refer-\nred to thefe feven. THE FIRST KIND oF PROF-\nANATION IS COMMITTED BY THOSE, wbo jtjl\nfrom the Word, and concerning the TVord, or from th~\nDivine Things of the Churcb mid concerning them:\nThis is done by fame from a bad Habit, by raking\nNames or Forms of Speech out of the. \\Vord, and\nintroducing them in unfeemly and fomctimes filthy\nDifcourfe ; \\vhich cannot but be connetl:ed with a\nContempt of the \\Vord in fame Sort; when never-\nthelefs the Word in the \\Vhole and in every Partie-\u00b7\nular is Divine and holy ; for every \\Vord thereof\nin its B.Jfom containeth fomething Divine ; and\nthereby hath Communication with Heaven : But\nthis Kind of Profanation is lighter, or\u00b7 more griev-\nous, according to the Acknowledgment of the Sanc-\ntity of the \\Vord, and the Indecency of the Dif-\ncourfe in which it is introduced by thofe who \u00b7make\na Jefr of it. A SECOND KIND OF PROFANATION IS\nCOMMIT fED BY THOSE, who zmdeljlandand acf.:nowf-\nedge Divine Truths, and yet live contrary f() them ;\nllut they profane them more lightly, who only un.\nR R. derfl:and\n\f322 ANGELIC \\VIsDOM CONCERNING\nderfl:and them, whereas fuch as acknowledge them\nalfo, profane them more grievoufly; for the Under.\nHanding only teacheth, much in the fame Manner\nas when a Preacher teacheth, and doth not conjoin\nitfelf with the \u00b7will from itfelf; but Acknowledg.\nment conjoineth itfelf, for Nothing can be acknowl.\nedged without the Confent of the Will: Howbeit\nthis Conjunftion is various, and the Profanation\nis according to the ConjunCtion; when a Life is led\ncontrary to the Truths which are acknowledged; as\nfor Example, if any one acknowledgeth that Re-\nvenge and Hatred, Adultery and Fornication~ Fraud\nand Deceit, Blafphemy and Li~s, are Sins againll;\nGod, and yet committeth them, fuch a one is in a\nmore grievous Degree of this Kind of P1 ofanation ;\nfor.the Lord faith, \" 'rhe Seroant \u2022who knr;weth his\nLord's FVill, and doeth not according to his TYill, jhall\nbt! beaten with many Stripes,\" Luke xii. 48. And in\nanother Place, \"!fye u\u00b7ere blind, ye would have n~\nSin; but now ye Jay, u:e fee, therefore your Sin re.\nmaineth,\" John ix. 4 r. But it is one Thing to ac.\nknowledge Appearances ofTruth, and another to ac.\nknowledge genuine Truths ; they who acknowledge\ngenuine Truths, and frill do not live according to\nthem, appear in the fpiritual Vvorld without the\nl.ight and Heat of Life in the Tone of their Voice\nand Speech, as if they \\vere Inertnefs itfelf [Jicutfo\u00b7\nrent merce Inertia.] A THIRD KIND OF PRoFANA\u00b7\n'fiON IS COJ\\IMITTED BY THOSE who apply the liter.\na\/ Senft of the \u00b7word to corifirm evil Loves, and fa!ft\nPrinciples; the Reafon is, becaufe a Confirmation\nof what is Falfe is a Negation of the Truth, and a\nConfirmation of Evil is a Rejection of Good, and\nthe\n\fTuE DIVINE PROVIDENcE. 323\nthe 'Word contains in its Bofom Nothing but Di-\n'11ine Truth and Divine Good, and this in the ulti-\nmate Senfe, which is the literal Senfe, doth not ap-\npear in genuine Truths, (except where it teacheth\nconcerning the Lord and the cffential '\\Vay of Sal-\nvation,) but in Truths cloathed, v:hich arc called A p-\npearances of Truth ; wherefore this Senfe may be\nwrefl:ed to confirm Herefies of many Kinds : Dut\nwhofo cpnfirmeth evil Loves, offereth Violence to\nDivin!! Goods ; and whofo confirmeth falfe Princi.\npies, offereth Violence to Divine Truths : This Iat-\n(er Violence is called the Falfification of Truth, but\nthe for:ner the Adulteration of Good ; they are both\ntmderfl:ood by Bloods in the '\\Vord ; for the fpirit~\nual Holy Pri~ciple, (or fpiritual Holinefs) which is\nalfo the Spjrit of Truth proceeding from the Lord,\nrefi.deth inwardly in t.very Particular of the literal\nSenfe of the Word; this Holy [Spirit] is violated,\nwhen the Word is falfi.fied an.9 ~du!terated : That\nthis is Profanation, is evident. A FOURTH K.r:r-:n\nOF PROFANATION IS COMMITTED BY THOSE, -.:.:ho,\n' 'l.Uitb their Mouths jpMk crbings pious and holy, and,\n:z!Jo in their 'Tone of Voice and Gijlure counterfeit\n!{!fellions ofthe Love of furh 'Things, and yet in their\nHearts do not believe and fo'l..\u00b7e them. MoH: of thefe\nare Hypocrites and Pharifees, fron~ whom after\nDeath every Truth and Good is taken away, and\nthen they are fent into 01Jter Darknefs. Such of\nthis Kind, ~s have confirmed themfelves again\u00a31:\nwhat is Divine, and againfl: the \\Vord, and thence\n~lfo againfl: the fpiritual Things of the \\Vord, fit\nfilent in that Darknefs, impotent of Speech, and\nq.efirous to babble about Things piou.s and holy, as\nthey\n\f324 ANGELIC \\VIsDOM CO~CERNING\nthey did in the \\Vorld, but they are not able ; for\nin the fpiritual \\Vorld every one is forced to fpeak\nas he thinks, but an Hypocrite wifheth to fpeak\nothenvife than he thinks, whence there is an Op-\npofition in the Mouth, by Reafon of which he can\nonly mutter. Howbeit, Hypocrites are lighter or\nmore grievo~.;s, according ro the Confirmation a-\ng:.;infl: God, anJ Reafonings exteriorly in Favour\nof God. A FIFTH KrND oF PRoFANATION Is\nCOMMITTED IlY THC;SE, who attribute to tbcn!fe\/'i.\u2022es\nfibings Divine: Thefe are they who are meant by\n1~ucifer in Ifaiah, Chap. xiv ; By Lucifer is there\nmeant Babe!, as may appear from Verfe 4th, 22d,\nof that ChaFter, where alfo their Lot is defcribed:\nThe fame are likewi!'e meant and de!'cribed by the\n\\Vhorc fttting upon the fcarlet coloured Beafl:, in\nthe Revelation, Chap. xvii. Babel and Chaldrea\nare mention~d in many Parts of the Vvord, and by\nBabel. is there meant Profanation of Good, and by\nChaldrea Profanation of Truth, both in thofe who\nattribute Things Divine to themfelves. A SIXTH\nKu.m OF PROFANATION IS COMMITTED BY THOSE,.\nwho ackno'Wlcdge the Word, and yet deny the Lord's\nDivinity: Thde are called in the World Socinians,\n:md fome of them Arians; the Lot ofboth thefe is,\nthat they invoke the Father, and fome of them alfo\nfor the Sake of the Son, that they may be admitted\ninto Heaven, but in va!n nntil they become without\nHope of Salvation ; and they are then let down in-\nto IIell among thofe who deny God: Thefe arc\nthey who arc meant by thofe who blafpheme the\nHoly Ghofl, who will not be forgiven neither in\nthis v\\rorld, nor in that which i~ to comr, Mott. xii.\n\u00b7u:\n'\n\fTHE DiviNE PRovintNcE. :;: 5\nsz: The Reafon is, becaufe God is one in Pcrfon\n:md in Elfence, in whom there is a Trinity, an~l\nthis God is the Lord ; and forafmuch as the Lo1ci\nis alfo Heaven, and conf'equentfy they who arc in\nHeaven are in the Lord, therefore they who deny\nthe Lord's Divinity cannot be admitted into Heox-\ncn, and be in the Lord : That the Lord is Heaven,\nand that thence they who are in Heaven arc in the.\nLord, was fue,vn aboYe. A SEVr:'NTH KIND OF\nPROFANATION IS COMMITTED BY THOSE, wbo.fitJt\nacknowledge Di'l..'in.: Truths, and \/hJe according to them~\nand afterwards rcc~de and deny them ; this is the\nworft Kind of Profanation, by Reafon that they mix\nThings holy and profane, in fuch a Manner, tb.t\nthey cannot be feparated, and ycJ- in Order to their\nAdmitiion either into Heaven or IIell, they muH: be\nfeparated ; and becaufe in fuch Perfons this cannot\nbe effeel:ed, all the human IntelleClual and Volunta..\nry [Faculty] is defl:royed, and they become no long-\ner Men, as was faid before. It is ne:1rly the f:1me\nwith thofe, who acknowledge in their Hearts the\nDivine Things of the \\Vord and of the Church,\n.:.nd entirely immerfe them in their Proprium, [fdf-\nifh Nature] which is the Love of ha,\u00b7ing Domin-\nion over every Thing, pf which much hath been\nf.a.id above; for thefe after Death, when they be~\ncome Spirits, will by no Means be led of the Lord,\nbut entirely of themfeh\u00b7es, and when their Love is\nnot refl:rained, they delirc not only to rule over\nHeaven, but alfo over the Lord; and inafmuch as\nthey cannot do fo, they deny the Lord, anJ bect\">:ne\nPevils. It is to be obferved, that t!Je Life's Love,\n~\u00b7hi.ch is alfo the ruling Love, rem:::.ins in C\\'ery one\n2.fter\n\f326 ANGELIC \\XflSDOM CONCERNING\nafter Death, and that it cannot be removed. Th~\n\u00b7Profane of this Kind are meant by the Luke-warm,\nof whom it is thus written in the Revelation,\" I know\nthy Works, that thou art neither ccld nor hot; I would\nthou wert cold or hot; fo then becaz!fe thou art neitber\ncold nor hot, l .wil!jpue thee ord ifmy Mouth,\" iii., 14,\nI 5\u00b7 This Kind of Profanation is thus defcribed by\n'the Lord in Matthew, \"TVhen the unclean Spirit is.\ngone out ofa lvlan, he walkcth through dry Places,\nJetking Rtjl, but.findetb none; then hefaith, I toil\/ re~\nturn into the Hol!fefrom whence I came out ; and when\nhe is come, be.findctb it empty, fa:cpt~ and garnifbed;\nthen goetb he and taketi:Jo with himftlfJevcn other Spirit.r\nmore 'Wicked than \/;in!felf, and they enter in and dwell\nthere; and the laji State of that l'vfan i! wotje than\nthe .fi!ft,\" xii. 4-3, 45 ; the Converfion of a Man is.\nhere defcribed by the unclean Spirit's going out of\nhim; and his Returning to his former Evil.$, after\ncafl:ing out Things true and good, is defcribed by\nthe Return of the unclean Spirit with feven others\nmore wicked than him[elf into the Houfe which he\nfound garni!hed for him ; and the Profanation of\nwhat is holy by what is profane, is defcribed by the\nlaO: State of that Man being worfe than the firfl:~\nThe fame is underfl:ood by this Paffa;e in John,\n\" JefusJaid to him who was heakd in the Lake ofBe-.\nthefda,jin no more, ldJ a '<.rJor:fe 'Thing -bifai thee,\" v. 14.\nThat the Lord provideth, that Man may not interi-\norly acknowledge Truths, and afterwards recede\nfrom them and become profane, is meant by thefe\n\\Vords, \" He hatb blinded their E..fes, and hardened\ntheir Heart, tbat theyJbould not ftc witb their Eye.r,\nnor undetjland with their Heart, and he com:erted~.and\nIjhoul4\n\fTHE DIVlNE PROVIDENCE. 321\nI jbndd heai th~m:~ John xii. 40 ; left they !hou!J\nbe converted and I fhould heal them, fignifies left\nthey !hould acknowledge Truths and then recede,\nand fo become prof:.me : For the fame Reafon the\nLord fpake by Parables, as He Himfelf faith, Matt.\nxw.

IV. That tberefore the Lord doth not let Mmz\nmore interiorly into the Truths of W!fdom, llnd at the\nfame Time into the Goods of Love, thanJoJar as he can\nbe kept in thm to the End of Life. In demonflrat~\ning this we muft proceed difl:inc:l:ly, .lor two Rea-\nfans, firfr, becaufe it nearly concerns the Salvation\nof Mankind; fecondly, becaufe on a Knowledge of\nthis Law depends the Knowledge of the Laws of\nPermiffion, to be treated of in the following Para-\ngraph: Firft, it nearly c'oncerns the Salvation of\nMankind ; for, as was obferved before, he who\nfirft acknowledgeth the Divine Things of the\nWord and of the Church thence derived, and after-\nwards recedeth from them, very grievoufly pro-\nfanes what is H0ly. Therefore that this Arca-\nnum of the Divine Providence may be unfolded in\nfuch a Manner, that the rational Man may fee it in\nits true Light, it !hall be elucidated in the following\nSeries. I, That in the Interiors of M<1n, Evil and\nGood\n\f,328 ANDELIC vVISDOM CONCERITING\nGood c:;mnot refidc together, nor confequently the\nFalfe tf Lvi! and the True ofGood at the lame Time.\np.. That in the Interiors of Man Good and the True\n0f Good cannot be infufed by the Lord, except in\nProportion as Evil and the Falfe of Evil is thence\nt ('tr.c,\\(:d. 3\u00b7 If Good with its True were infufed\nthne bef0n:, or in greater Proportion than as Evil\nw<:s rem~ved together with its Falfe, Man \u00b7would.\nrecede from Good and return to his Evil. 4\u00b7 That\n\"he:n l\\I<in is in Evil, many Truths may be infufed\nin ~o his Underfb.nding, and treafcred up in his\n1\\lemory, and yet not be profaned. 5\u00b7 But that\nthe L0rd by his Divine Providence moft particular-\nly p;oviceth, that they be not receiV'ed thence by\nthe- \\'.Jill, fooner or in greater Proportion, than as\nl\"h n removeth Evils in the external Ivlan, as if of\nliimfdf. 6. That if they were received fooner, or\nin gre:1ter Proportion, then the 'Will would adulte-\nrate the Good, and the Underfianding would falfify\ntl\":e True, by mixing them with Evils and Falfei~\u00b7\n'7. 1 h:Jt therefore the Lord doth not let Man more\nh\u00b7 re~!orly into the Truths of Faith and the Goods.\nof T.ove, than fo far as Man can be kept in them to\u00b7\n~ht- End of Life.\n233\u00b7 In Order therefore that this Arc:mum of\nt't>c Di\\'inc Providence may be difclofed, in fuch a\nll1nncr that the rational Man may fee it in his-\n-::..ight, the Things whith have been now adduced\n,hali be fevnaLy explained. FIRST : That in the In-\n:eri;rs of l1lan, E'Vit and Good cannot rifzde together at\nthe .fame Time, conf:quently neither can the Fa!fe ofE-\n'l.\u2022i! and the 'I'rue ofGood: By the Interiors of Man\nis mt:ant the Internal of his Thought, of which Man.\ndoth\n\f\\\nTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE.\ndoth not know any Thing, before he comes into the\nfpiritual \\Vorld and its Light, which is the Cafe after\nDeath ; In the natural vVorld this can only be\nknown from the Delight. of his Love in the Exter~\nnal of his Thought, and from Evils themfelves,\nwhen he explores rhem in himfelf; for, as was !hewn\nabove, the Internal of Thought in Man coheres\nwith the External of Thought in fo intimate a State\nof Connexiot1, that they cannot be feparated ; but\nof this more may be feen above. It is faid, Good\nand the True of Good, and Evil and the Falfe of\nEvil, inafmuch as Good cannot ex.ifl without its\nTrue, nor Evil without its Falfe, becaufe they are\nconnubial Partners or Conforts, \u00b7for the Life of\nGood is from its True, and the Life of True from\ni_\nts Good; it is the fame with Evil and its Falfe.\nThat in the Interiors of Man Evil cannot exifl: with\nits Falfe, and \u00b7at the fame Time Good with its True,\nmay be feen by th\"e rational Man without Explana~\ntion, for Evil is oppofite to Good, and Good is op~\npoute to Evil, and two Oppoiites cannot refide to-\u00b7\ngcther : There is alfo in all Evil an inherent Hatred\u00b7\nagainfl Good, and in all Good an inherent Love of\n.defending itfelf againfl Evil, and removing the fame\nfrom it; trom which Confideration it follows, that\nthe one cannot dwell with the other; and if they\nwere together, firfl: a Conflict and Combat would\narife, and Defl:ruaion would follow; which alfo th<}\ntord teacheth in thefe vVords, \"Every Kingdon1\ndivided againfl: itfelf is brought to Defolation ;1 and\nevery City or Houfe divided againfi itfelf lhall no~\nfiand. He that is not with Me is againfl: Me, and\nhe that gathereth not with Me fcattereth abroad,'~\nS :> Matt.\n\f330 ANGELIC WisDOM CONCERNING\nMatt. xii. 25, 30; and in other Places. \"No one\ncan at the fame Time ferve two Mafiers, for he wilt\neither h~tc the one or love the other,'' Matt. vi. 24..\nTwo Oppofites cannot exi!l: together in one Sub-\nfiance, or 1\n1\n\\): m, without its being difiraCl:ed and\nperi!hing ; in Cafe one were to ~dvance and ap-\nproach the other, they would feparate themfelves-\naltogether like two Enemies, one g(which would .\nretire within his Camp or Fortifications, and the oth..\ner would Iemain \\\":ithout:. This is the Cafe ~vith\nEvils and Goods irr a Hypocrite; fuch a one is in\nboth; but Evil is within and Good is without, ar.d\nthus they are feparate and not mixed.. SECONDLY:\ncJ'hat Good and the True ofGood cannot be infi!fed hj'\nrhe Lord into tbe Interiors of Jl.1mi, but in ProportioJ;,\nas E'l.oil and tbe Fa!fe ofEvil is removedfrom -thence.:\nThis is a neceiTary Confequence of what precedes;\nfor fince Evil and Good cannot be together, Good\ncannot be impbnted before Evil is removed. It is-\nfaid in the Interiors of Man, by which is meant the\nInternal of Thought ; thefe Interiors are what ar~\nhere tre<:ted of, in whic_\nh either the Lord mull: d\\vell,\nor the Devil; the Lord is there after Reformation,.\n-.nd the Devil is there before it ; therefore in Pro~\n, portion as Man fuffers himfelf to be reformed, in\nthe fame Proportion the Devil is call: out, but in\nProportion as he doth not fuffer himfelf to be re-\nformed, in the fame Proportion the Devil remain\u00b7\neth : \\Vho cannot fee, that the Lord cannot enter,.\nfo long as the De\\,il is there, and he is there fo long\nas Man keepeth the Door :!hut, which Man is in\nPoifeffion of together with the Lord ; that the Lord\nentereth, when that Door is op~ned by Means of\nMan~\n\f\"fnE DIVINE PROVIDENC:\u00a3. ,_J3 I\nMan, He Himfelf teacheth in the Revelation, \" I\nfraud at the Door and knock; if any Man hear my\nVoice and open the Door, I will come in to him, and\nwill fup with him, and he with Me,'' iii. 20; the\nDoor is opened by Man's removing Evil by fhun.\nning and avoiding it as infernal and diabolical; for\nwhether it be called Evil, or the \"nevil, it is the fame\nThing ; and on the other Hand, whether you fay\nGood, or the Lord, it is the fame Thing; for iri~\nwardly in all Good the Lord dwelleth, and in all\nEYil inwardly the Devil dwelleth. Hence tfle Truth\nof this Pofition is evident~ THIRDLY: If Good\nwith its 'True were infufedformer, or in greater Pro~\nportion, than as Evil and its Fa!fe is removed, Mmt\nwould recedefrom Good and return to his Evil.~ The\nReafon is, bccaufe 'Evil would prevail, and that\nwhich prevails, conquereth, ifnot at the Time, nev~\n~rthelefs afterwards; while Evil continues to prevail,\n.Good cannot be introduced into the inmofl: Apart.\nments, (intima Conclavia), but only into the outer\nCourts, by Reafon, as was faid, that Evil and Gooq\ncannot be together~ and that whi~ is only in the\n,cuter Courts, is removed by its Enemy which is in\nthe inner Apartments, whereby there is a Receilion\nfrom Good and a Return to Evil, which is the worfl:\nKind of Profanation. Befides, the very-Delight of\nMan's Life is to love himfelf and the vVorld aboYe\nall Things; this Delight cannot be removed in a\nMoment, but mufl: be done fucceilively; but accord-\ning to the Proportion of this Delight which remain-\neth in Man, in the fame Proportion is the Prevalence\nof Evil; and this Evil can no othcrw1fe be removed,\nth.<l:n by making the Love ofSelf to become the Love\npf\n\f:)32 ANGELIC vVISDOM CONCERNING\nof Ufes, and admitting the Love of Rule, not for\nthe Sake of Self, but for the S;~.ke of being ufeful,\nfor fo Ufet confl:itute th~ Head? and the Love of\nSelf or the Love of Rule at firfi confi:it~te the Body\nltnd~r that Head, .and afterwards ~he Feet upon\nwhich he walketh ': Who doth not fee that Good\n(:onfiitutes the flead, and that when Good confi:i-\ntutes the Bead, the Lord is there, Oood and Ufe b~\u00ad\ning one?

Therefore inafmuch as the State\nof Man's Ljfe i~ to b~ invt;rted, fo that \"'hat ~s\n;:tbove may \\:>e placed below, ;md this Co!lverfioi).\ncannot pe effecled in a Moment, (for that fuprem~\nPelight of Life, whi~h proceeds fro~ the Love qf\nSelf and thenc~ of Dominio!l, canno,t be d~minifhed\nexcept f~ccefiively, and fo changed into the Love qf\nUfes,) for this Reafon Gooci cannot be infufed or\nintroduced by the Lord fooner, or in\u00b7greater ~tan\"!\ntity, than in Proportion as Evil is removed ; and if\nit were inf\\}fed 'fopner, and in greater ~antity,\n:Man wol}ld r~cede from Good and return to his\nEvil. FouRTHLY: That when !Vfan is i!f Evil, many\n~ruth.; may be introducfd irzto his Und~i]landing, an(!.\ntheft .flared up h! the Memory, ~nd yet not profaned:\nThe Re~fon is, beca1;1fe the l)nJerfianding doth no.t\n\u00a3ow into the Will, but the Will into the Under-\nHanding ; and forafmuch as the Underfrandin~.\ndoth not flow into tht;!

That Adam, the wiftjt of Men~ and hi~\nHlife, fujfered thcn!feh;es to be feduccd by tbe Serpent,\nand tbat God did not prevent this by bis Di'l-\u00b7ine Prov-\nidence : The Reafon is, becaufe by Adam and his\n\u00b7yvife are not meant the fir!l: of all the Men that\nwere created in this Vvorld, but the Men of the,\nmo11 ancient Church, whofe new Creation or Re.\ngeneration is defcribed at the Begit1ning of Genefis ?\ntheir ne\\v Creation or Regeneration itfelf is fignified\nby the Creation of Heaven and Earth in the firft\nChapter ; their Vlifdom and Intelligence by th~\nGarden\n\fTIJE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 343\nGarden of F.den; and the F.nd of that Church by\ntheir Eating of the -Tree of Knowledge : For the\n\\Vord internally is fpiritual, containing within it3\nBofom Arcana of Divine Wifdon1, ami in Order\nthat thefe Arcana may be therein contained, it is\nwritten by mere Correfpond~nces and Reprefenta-\ntions. From thefe Correfpondences and Reprefen-\ntations it is evident, that the Men of that Church,\nwho in its Beginning were the mofl: wife, and in its\nEnd, by Reafon of the Pride of their Self-derived\nIntelligence, were the mofl: wicked, were not fedu~\nced by any Serpent, but by Self-Love, which is\nthere denoted by the Head of the Serpent, which is\nto be bruifed by the Seed of the \\Voman, that is,\nby the Lord. \\Vho cannot fee from Reafon, that\nether Things are underftcod, different from what\nare here hiftorically recorded in the Letter ? For\nwhc; can comprehend, that the Creation of the\n\\Vorld could have been fuch as it is there de-\nfcribed ? Wherefore alfo the Learned are much puz-\nzled to explain what is contained in the firfl Chap~\nter, and confefs after a11, that they do not under-\nfiand it : Moreover it is faid, that in their Garden\nor Paradife there were placed two Trees, the one\nof Life, and the other of Knowledge, and thefe for\na flumbling Block; as alfo, that barely by eating\nof the latter, they finned fo greatly, that not only\nthey, but alfo the whole human Race, their Pofler-\nity, became obnoxious to Damnation; likewife that\na Serpent was able to feduce them, befides other\nCircumfiances, as that the V.Joman was created out\nof a Rib of the Man ; that they knew that they\nwere naked after their Fall, and covered themfelves\nwith\n\fl4t} ANGELIC \\VlSDOM CONCERNING\nwith Fig Leaves, and that Coats of Skins were gii\".J\nen them to clothe their Bodies ; and Cherubim\u00b7\nwere placed vi'ith a flaming Sword to keep the Way\nof the Ttee of Life. All thefe Things are Repre.:\nfentatives, by which are defcribed the Efl:ablifhment\nof the moll ancient Church, its State of PerfeB:ion7\nits Decline, and lafl:ly its Defl:ruB:ion \u00a3 The con.\ncealed Meaning of all the Things contained in the\nfpiritual Senfe, which refides in every Particular of\nthe \\Vord, may be feen explained in THE ARc A.;\nN A CmLESTIA on the Books of Genefis and Exo.o\n\u00b7 Etus, publifhed in London ;\u00b7 fro_\nm which it may alfo\nappea\u00b7r, that by the Tree of Life is there under!l:ood\nthe Lord with RefpeB: to his Divine Providence:~\nand that by the Tree of Knowledge is under!l:ooa\nMan with RefpeB: to his felf-derived Prudence.\nz.p. II. That their .fir:ft-born Son, Cain,jlew his\nBrother Abel, and God did not prevent it by;peaking\nta him, but rmly curfed him cifter the AB. Forafmuch\nas by Adam .and his Wife\u00b7 is meant the mofl: ancient\nChurch, as hath jufl: been obferved above, confe-\nquently by Cain and Abel, their fir!l: Sons7 are\nmeant two Effentials of the Church, which are Love\nand Wifdom, or Charity and Faith1 by Abel Love\nand Charity, and by Cain \\Vifdom or Faith, fpecifi.\u00b7\ncally \\Vifdom feparate from Love; or Faith feparate\nfrom Charity ; and Wifdom as alfo Faith feparate is\noffuch a Nature, that it not only rejeB:eth Love and\nCharity, but alfo annihilates them, and fo flayeth its\nBrother : That Faith feparate from Charity hath\nthis EffeB:, is well enough known in the Chrifi:ian\n'\\Vorld; fee THE DocTRINE oF THE NE\\V ]ERU\u00b7\nSAI.EM CONCERNING FAITH. The Curfe of Cain\ninvolves\n\f345\ninvolves t~e fpiritual State, into which they come\n~fter Death, who feparate Faith from Charity, or\nWifdom from Love. But neverthelefs, that Wif:;\ndom or Faith might not therefore perifh, a Mark\n\\vas fet upon Cain, left he !hould be flain, for Love\nis not given without VJifdom; nor Charity without\nFaith. lnafrnuch as by thefe Circumfl:ances nearly\n~he fame Things are reprefented, as by eating of the\nTree of Knowledge, therefore they follow in Order\nafter the Defcription of Adam and his Wife ; they\nalfo, who are in Faith feparate frcim Charity, are in\nfelf-derived Intelligence, and they who are in Chari-\nty, and thereby in Faith, are in Intelligence from the\nLord, and fo in the Divine Providence.\n243\u00b7 III.

Thence\narofe th\"e Idolatries, which filled the whole Earth,\nas well Afia and its circumjacent I!lands, as Africa\nand Europe. 'Jo the End that all thefe Idolatries\nmight be extirpated, it was permitted by the Divine\nProvidence of the Lord, that a new Religion fhould\narife, accommodated to the Genius of the Eafl:ern\nNations; in which there fhould be Something out\nof both Tefl:aments of the \\V\"ord, and which !hould\nteach that the Lord came into the World, and that\nHe was the grand Prophet, [maximus Propheta] the\nwifefl: of all, and the Son of God : This was effeCt-\ned by Mahomet, from whom that Religion is called\nthe Mahometan Religion. This Religion was raif-\ned up by the Divine Providence of the Lord, and\naccommodated, as was obferved, to the Genius of\nthe Eafl:ern Nations, to the End that it might de-\nftroy the Idolatries which at that Time fo generally\nprevailed, and give the Inhabitants of thofe Coun-\ntries fome Knowledge of the Lord, before they came\ninto the fpiritual \\Vorld ; which Religion would\nnot have been received by fo many Kingdoms, nor\nhave had Power to extirpate their Idolatries, if it\nhad\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 369\nhad not been accommodated and adapted to the\nIdeas and Mode of Life prevailing amongft them all.\nThe Reafon why they did not acknowledge the\nLord as the God of Heaven and Earth, was becaufe\nthe Eaftetn Nations acknowledged a God the Crea.\ntor of the Univerfe, but could not comprehend that\nHe Himfelf came into the World, and took upon\nHim the human Nature; as neither do the Chrif-\ntians comprehend, who therefore in Thought fepa-\nrate his Divinity from his Humanity, and place his\nDivinity befide the Father in Heaven, and his Hu-\nmanity they know not where. Hence it may be\nfeen, that the Mahometan Religion alfo had its Or.\nigin in the Divine Providence of the Lord ; and that\nall they of that Religion, who acknowledge the \u00b7\nLord as the Son of God, and at the fame Time live\naccording to the Precepts of the Decalogue, which\nthey alfo are in Poifeffion of, by fhunning Evils as\nSins, are received into that Heaven which is called\nthe Mahometan Heaven : That Heaven alfo is divid.\ned into three Heavens, a fupreme, a n1iddle, and a\nlowefl:; in the fupreme Heaven are thofe who ac-\nknowledge the Lord to be one with tpe Father,\nand confequently that' he is the only God : In the\nfecond Heaven are thofe who _\nrenounce a Plurality\nof Wives, and live with one only; and in the ulti-\nmate Heaven, are thofe who are initiated.

But what was the Confc-\nquence? \u00b7when Self-Love had exalted its Domin.\nion even unto the Throne of the Lord, had re-\nmoved Him thence, and placed itfdf upon it, this\nLove; which is Lucifer, could not do othcrwife\nthan profane all Things appertaining to the \\Vord\nand the Church ; and to prevent this, the Lord fo\nordered it of his Divine Providence, that they\nfhould depart from the \\Vorfhip of Him, and in-\n,\u00b7oh dead :Men, pray to Images of fuch, kif~\ntheir\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. . 37S\ntheir Bones, profl:rate themfelves at their Sepulchres,\nforbid the \\Vord to be read, and place the Sanctit)'\nof Divine lNodl1ip in Mafics not underfl:ood by the\nVulgar, and fell Salvation for Money; inafmuch as\nif they had not done thefe Things, they would have\nprofaned the holy Thing-s of the Word and of the\nChurch; for, as was !hewn in the preceding Para-\ngraph, none can profane Things facred, but th;:y\nwho know fuch Things. Therefore that they mihht\nnot profane the mofl: holy Supper, it is of the Di-\nvine Providence of the Lord, that they iliould di\u00b7\nvide it, and give the Bread to th\u00b7:! People, and drink\nthe \\Vine themfelves ; for the \\:Vine in the holy\nSupper fignifies \u00b7holy Truth, and the Bread holy\nGood, but when they are divided, the Wine fig-\nnifies Truth profaned, and the Bread Good adulter-\nated ; and it is provided moreover that they fhouhl\nmake it corporeal and material, and account this\nDoEtrine to be a primary Tenet of Religion. He\n~vho attends to thefe Particulars, and weighs them\nin, fame Illumination of Mind, may fee the wonder-\nful Operation of the Divine Providence, in guarding\nthe holy Things of the Church, and faving all\nwho are capable of being favcd, and fnatching as it\nwere out of the Fire thofe who will fuffer thcm-\nfelves to be fnatched away.\n2 58.

Moreover, every one who is\nborn a Chriflian, knoweth alfo that EYils arc to be\nlhunned as Sins, by Reafon that the Dcc:!logue is\nput into the Hands of every Boy and Girl, and is\ntaught by Parents and 1\\lafters ; like..,vife all !.'he\nSubjech of a Kingdom, particularly the common\nPeople, are examined by the Priel1: out of the Dec~\nalogue which they have got by Heart, what they\nknow of the Chrifl:ian Religion, and arc alfo admor.-\nilhed to do the Things that are contair..ed therein ;\nat fuch Times, they are never tolc..l by any P: icfl:\nthat they are not under the Yoke of th;lt Law, nor\nthat they cannot do the Things therein commanded,\nbecaufe they cannot do any Good from thcmfe!vc::.\nZ z The\n\f378 ANGELIC vVISDOM CONCERNING\nThe Athanafian Creed is alfo received by the whole\nChriftian World, and what is faid in the laA: Part\nof it is acknowledged, namely, that the Lord will\nc0me to judge both the ~-;ick and the Dead, and\nthen they who ha\u00b7ve done Good fhall enter into ever~\nlafting Life, and they who ha\u00b7ve dri!ze E'vif into ever~\nJailingFire. In SwEDE~, where the Religion ofFaith\nalone is received, it is alfo plainly taught that there\nis no Faith feparate from Charity, or without good\n\\Vorks, and this in a certain Memorial annexed and\ninferted in all the Books of the l~falms, whi(h is en.\ntitled Impediments or Stumbling Blocks to the Im~\npenitent, (OBoTFERDIGAS FoERHINDER) in which\nthere are thefe Words, \"They who are rich in\ngood Vvorks iliew thereby that they are rich in\nFaith, becaufe when Faith is faving, it operateth by\nCharity ; for juftifying Faith never exifl:eth alone\nand feparate from good \\Vorks, as there is no good\nTree without Fruit, no Sun without Light and\nHeat, and no \\Vater without Moifl:ure.\" Thefe fe\\v\nCircumfl:ances are adduced that it may be known,\nthat although the Religion of Faith alone is receiv.\ncd, fiill the Goods- of Charity, which are good\n\\Vor.k:s, are every where taught, and that this is of\nthe Divine Providence of the Lord, }t;fi the com.\nmon People fuoukl thereby be feduced.

II. r'hat a Doubt may be inftrrcd agah!fl the\nDhJinc Providence, becaufe\u00b7beretofore it was not known,\nthat in every Particular of the Word there is aJPirit,.\nual Senft, and that its Holinifs cor!ftjls therein: For it\nmay be fuggcfi:ed as a Doubt againfi: the Divine\nProvidence, \\Vhy is this r~vealed now for the firfl:\nTi:ne, and why by this or that Perfon, and not by\nanv Primate of the Church ? But whether he be a\n\" .\nPrimate or the Servant of a Prip.1ate, is according to\nthe Lord's good Pleafure, for he knoweth both the\none and the other. But the Reafon why that Senfe\nof the Word was not revealed before, is, I. Becaufe,\nif it had been revealed before, the Church would\nhave profaned it, and thereby have profaned the\nSan&ity of the Word itfelf. II. That neither were\ngenuine Truths, in which the fpiritual Senfe of the\nWord confifi:s, revealed, till after the lafi: Judgment\nwas performed, and a New Church, which is under~\nfiood by the Holy Jerufalem, was about to be efi:ab-\nlifhed by the Lord : But thefe Articles iliall be ex.\namincd feparately; FIRST : That tbeJpiritual &1!fo\nqftbe Word v.Jas not revealed before, bcraz!fe ifit had\nbeen revca!d before, the Church would have profaned\nit, and tbereby haveprofaned tbe San{iity ofthe Word\niifdf: The Church, not long after its Efi:abliiliment,\nwas converted into Babylon, and afterwards into\nPhilifi:hea; and Babylon doth indeed acknowledge\nthe \\Vord, but yet contemneth it, faying that the\nHoly G hofi: infpires them in their fupreme Ded-.\nfions, equally as much as it infpired the Prophets:\nThe\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 391\nThe Reafon why they acknowledge the \\Vor,l, is,\nfor the Sake of the Vicnrfhip founded on the Lord's\ntvords to Peter ; but yet they contemn it, becaufe\nit doth not accord [with thdr Views ;] for that Rea-\nfan alfo it is taken from the People, and hid in Mo\u2022\nnafleries; where there are but few who read it;\nwherefore if the fpi1itual Senfe of the \\Vord, in\n\\vhich the Lord, and at the fame Time all Angelic\n\"\\Vifdom dwelleth, had been revealed, the Word\nwould have been profaned, not only as is now the\nCafe, in its Ultimates, which are what is contained in\nthe literal Scnfe, but aifo in its Intimates or inmofl:\nMeaning. Philifi:ea, by which is meant Faith fepa\u2022\ntate from Charity, wouid alfo have prof~ned the\nfpiritual Senfe of the \\Vord; becaufe it places Salva-\ntion in certain \\Vords which :ire to be thought and\n!poke, and not in any.Good that is to be dorie, as\nwas fhewn before; and fo maketh that afaving Prin.;\nciple which lS not faving, and moreover removeth\nthe Underllanding from Things which ought to be\n' believed \" And what have fuch Perfons to do with\nthe Light, in which the (pirituai Senfe of the \\Von1\nis? \\Vould it riot be turned by them into Dark-\n. nefs ? 'When the natural Senfe Is turned into Dark-\nnefs, what would the fpiritual Senfe be ? Is there\nMy one of tbofc, who have confirmed themfelves in\nFaith feparated from Charity, and in Julllfication b,y\nit alone, that defi.res to know what the Good of'\nLife is, or what Love to the Lord is, and towards\ntheir Neighbour, or what Charity is, \\~\u00b7hat the\nGoods of Charity, what goctl \\Vorks are, and what\nit is to do, yea what Faith is in its Effence, or any\ngenuine Truth that confiitutes it? They write Vol..\nunies,\n\fj92 ANGILIC \"\\VISDOM CONCERNI1\\'0\numcs, and confirm Nothing but what they call FaithJ\nand all the Things above recited, they fay are con;o\ntained in that Faith. Frotn which it is evident,\nthat if the fpiritual Senfe of the \\Vord had been re.\nvealcd before, the Cafe would have been according\nto what the Lord faith in Matthew, \"If thine Eye\nbe evil, thy whole Body fhall be full of Darknefs j\nif therefore the L1ght that is in thee be Darknefs;\nhow great is that Darknefs,\" vi. 23: By Eye in the\nfpiritual Senfe of the Word, is meant the Under\"'\nfianding. SECONDLY~ That neither were the genu\u2022\nine Truths, of which the Jpiritual Se:!ft of the Word\ncOJ!fyls, revealed by the Lord, till after the lqjl \"Judg\u2022\nment was accomplijbed, and the New Church, whicb ii\nundeljlood by t.&e Holy 'Jerifalem, was about to be\ntjlabfi}hed by the Lord: It is foretold by the Lord in\nthe Apocalypfe, that after the lafi J~.:dgment is ac..\ncompllihed, genuine Truths are to be revealed, ~\nNew Church efiablifhed, and the fpiritual Senfe o\u00a3\nthe Word diftlofed: That the final Judgment is now\naccomplifhed, is !hewn in a fmall \\Vark concerning\nthe LAST JuDGMENT, and likewife in THE CoN-\nTINUATION of the fame ; and that that is what is\nmeant by the Heaven and Earth which are to pafs\naway, in the Apocalypfe, Chap. xxi. i. That gen\u2022\nuine Truths are then to be revealed, is foretold by'\nthefe Words in the Apocalypfe, \"He that fat upoli\nthe Thtone faid, behold, I make all Things new,'\u2022\nVerfe 5; alfo Chap. xix. 17, 18. Chap. xxi. 18 ta\n~ 1. Chap. xxii. 1, z, That the fpiritual Senfe\nof the \"\"rord is then to be revealed, is foretold in\nChap. xix. I 1 to I 6; this is denoted by the white\nHorfe, ~pq_n which he' who fat ~as called the \\Vord\nof\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 393\nof God, and was the Lord of Lords, and King ~f\nKings, on which SubjeCt fee the little Work con-\ncerning THE \"\"\"HITE HoRSE. That by the Holy\nJerufalem is meant the New Cb'urch, which ,is then\nto be dl:ablilhed by the Lord, may be feen in T:m~\nDocTRINE oF THE NEw jERUSAI.l~-M coNCERN-\nING THE LoRD, n. 62 to 65, where it is demon-\nfi:rated. Hence then it is ev,ident, that the fpiritual\nSenfe of the Word was to be revealed for a New\nChurch, which will acknowledge and worfhip the\nLord only, and hold his \\Vord facrecl, and love Di-\nvine Truths, and rejeCt Faith feparated from Chari-\nty. But more may be feen relative to this Senfe ()f\nthe Word, in THE DocTRINE oF THE N.Ew jERU-\nSALEM coNCERNiNG THE SAcRED ScR-\nIPTURE,\nn. 5 to 26; as what the fpiritual Senfe of the \\Vord\n'is, n. 5 to 26. That there ~s a fpiritual Senfe in all\nand every Particular of the Word, n. 9 to 17.\nThat it is by Virtue of the fpiritual Senfe, that the\nWord is of Divine Infpiration, and holy in every\nfingle Expreffion, n. 18, 1 9\u00b7 That the fpirit-\nual Senfe of the Word hath been heretofore\nunknown, and why it was not revealed before,\nn. 20 to 25. That from henceforth the fpir-\nitual Senfe of the 'Word will be opened to none\nbut thofe, who are principled in genuine ll'ruths\nfrom the Lord, n. z6. From thefe Confiderations\nthen it may appear, that it is of the Divine Provi-\ndence of the Lord, that the fpiritual Senfe hath been\nconcealed from the \\Vorld until th~ prefent Age,\nand in the mean Time was preferved in Heaven\namong the Angels, who out of it derive their \\Vif.-\ndom. Thi~ Senfe was known, and alfo cultivated,\nB n b among\n\f394 ANGELlC \\VrsDOM CO:NCERNIN~\namong the Ancients, who lived before Mofes; but\ninafmuch as their Pofl:erity converted the Corref-\npondences, of which folely their \\Vord and confe-\nquently their Religion confifled, into various Idol-\natries, and the Egyptians into Magic, by the Divine\nProvidence of the Lord it was !hut up, firft among\nthe Children of lfrael, and afterwards among the\nChriflians,.Jor the Reafons mentioned above, and is\nnow firfl: opeJ?ed for the Lord's New Church.\n265\u00b7 III. '!'bara Doubt may be il?ferred ngah!flthe\nDivine Pro'l:idence, bccaufe heretofore it 'Was not knGwn,\nthat tbe 'Very F:lfence of tbe Cbr!flimz Religion coriftfh\ninjhwming Evilt as Sins. That this is the very Efd\nience of the Chriflian Religion, is fhewn in Tm:\nDocTRINE oF LIFE FOR THE N Ew jERUSALEM ,.\nfrom Beginning to End: And whereas Faith fepa-\nrated from Charity is the only Obflacle to its being\nreceived, that alfo is treated 0f. lt is faid that here-\ntofore it was not known that the very Effence of the\nChriflian Religion confif!:s in fhunning Evils as Sins,\nbecaufe almofi every Body is ignorant of this, and\nyet every one knoweth it, as may be feen above, n.\nzs8; the Reafon why almofi: every Body is igno\u00b7\nrant ofit, is, becaufe Solifidianifm hath crafed it, for\nthis teacheth, that Faith alone faveth, and not any\ngood Work or Good of Charity; moreover that\nthey are no longer under the Yoke of the Law, but\nat Liberty ; they who frequently hear fnch Doc-\ntrines, no longer think of any Evil of Life, nor.of\nany Good of f.ife; for every Man by Nature is in-\nclined to embrace that Idea, and when it is once\nembraced, he no longer thinks of the State of his\nLife: This is the Reafon why the above is not.\nknown.\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 395\nknown. That it is not known, was difcovered to\nme in the fpiritual \\Yorld : I queflioned al:love a\nthoufand who ~\u00b7ere ne\\vly arrived from this \\\\Torld,\nwhether they knew that the Effence of Religion\nconfifl:ed in .lhunning EYils as Sins ; and they faid\nthat they did not know it, and that it was a new\nThing which had never been heard of before, but\nthat they had heard that they could not do any\nGood from themfelves, and that they were not un-\nder the Yoke of the Law : When I afk.ed, if they\ndid not know, that jt was a Man's Duty to exam-\nine himfelf, to fee his Sins, repent of them, and\nlead a new Life, and that otherwife Sins are not for-\ngiven, and if Sins are not forgiven there is no Salva-\ntion, and that this was read aloud to them as often\nas they received the holy Supper; they anfwered,\nthat they did not attend to thefe Things, but only to\nthis, that-by Means of the Lord's Supper their Sins\n'4l.re forgiven, and that Faith, without their Knowl-\nedge, operates the refi:. Again 1 afked, why did\nyou teach your Children the Decalogue, was it not\nthat they might know what Evils are Sins, which\nare to be fhunned? Was it that they might only\nknow and believe, and not acr accordingly? Where-\nfore then do you fay that this is a new Thing? To\nthis they could make no other Anfwer, but that they\nknew it, and yet did not know it, and that they nev-\ner thought of the feventh Commandment when\nthey committed Adultery, nor of the eighth when\nthey committed Theft or acted frauoently, and fo\non ; much lefs that fuch Things arc contrary to the\nDivine Law, confequently Offences againft God.\n'Vhen I mentioned feveral Things from the Doc-\ntrines \u00b7\n\f396 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\ntrines 'of the Churches, and from the Word, in Con.\nfirmation of my Affertion, that to fhun Evils as Sins,_\n:tnd hold them in Averfion, is the very Eifence of\nthe Chrifl:ian Religion, and that every ope is gifted\nwith Faith in Proportion as he !hunreth and holdeth\nthem in A v~rfion, they were filent ; but they were\nconfi_rmed in the Truth ofit, when they faw that all\nwere examined with Refpeer to their Lives, \u00b7and\njudged according to their AD:ions, and no one ac':'\ncording to his Faith unconneaedly with ~is Life,\nbecaufe the Faith of every one i~ conformable tq\nhis Life. The Reafon why the Chrillian World\nfor the mofl: Part did not know this, exifl:s in that\nLaw of the Divine Providence, whereby every one\nis left to aft from qberty according to .Reafon_\nwhich fee above, nl 7I to 99, and n. I 90 to 128 ;\nAlfo in the ~aw whereby it is appointed, tli~t 'no\none is taught immedi$!-tely from Heaven, but medi~\n~tely through the \\Vord, DoCtrine, and Pr~achings\nput of it, concerning which, fee ;1bove, n. I 54 to\n~ 74 : And likewife in all the Laws of Permiffion,\nwhich alfo are Laws of the Divine Providence.\nMore may be feen ~bove refpeaing thefe, n. 258.\n274\u00b7 lV. 1'hat a Doubt may b~ inferr~d againfl the\nJ)i;.;ine Pro'vidence, becm!ft it W!JS not knawu hereto-\nfore, that Man li'ueth after Death; and this was not\ndifcovered till 1ZO'IJ!\u00b7 The Reafcn why this was not\nknown, is, becaufe in thofe who 9o not ihun Evils\nas Sins, there lieth inwardly concealed a Belief,\nthat Man doth not live after Death, f!.nd there-\nfore they think it of no Importance, whether it be\nfaid that Man liveth after Death, or that he will\n:-ife again at the Dar of Judgm~nt; anif ~f he hap-:\npens\n\fTilE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 397\npens to have any Belief in a Refurreetion, he faith\nto himfelf, I ihall not fare worfe than others, for\nif I go to Hell, I ihall have many to accompany\nme, and if to .ijeaven, it will be the fame. But\nyet all who have any Religion, have in them an\ninherent Knowledge, \u00b7 that Men li\\\u00b7e after Death;\nthe Idea that they live as Souls, and not as Men,\ntakes Place only with thofe who are infatuated by\ntheir own Self-derived Intelligence, and with no\nothers. That <;very one who hath any Religion in\nhim, hath an inherent Knowledge that Man liveth\nafter Death, may appear from the \u00b7following Con-\nfiderations. I. \\:Vho thinks otherwife when he is\ndying ? 2. \"What Panegyrifl:, in his Lamentation\npver the Dr;:ad, doth not fend them to Heaven,\nplace them among the Angels, converfing with\nthem, and partaking their Joys ? Not to mention\nthe Apotheofis of fome. 3\u00b7 Who among the Vul-\ngar doth not believe, that when he dies, if he had\nlived well, he fhould go to a heavenly Paradife, be\ncloathed in a white Garment, and enjoy Life ever-\nlafting ? 4\u00b7 Where is ~he Preacher who doth not\nfay thefe Things, or the like, to thofe who are on\ntheir Death-Bed? And when he fays them, he be-\nlieves them himfelf, provided he doth not think of\nthe lafr Judgment. 5\u00b7 Who is there that doth not\npe!ieve that his Children are in Heaven, and that\nhe fhall fee his Wife, whom he had loved, after\nDeath ? VJ'ho ever fuppofes they are Spectre:;,\n~uch lefs that they are Souls or Minds ho verin~\n~botJt in the Univerfe? 6. \\Vho contradicrs, when\nany Thing is faid of the Lot and State of thofe\nwho have paifed from Time to Eternit\u00b7y ? I ha,\u00b7e\ntold\n\f398 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\ntold many of the State and Lot of fuch and fuch\nPerfons, and I never yet heard any one fay, that_\ntheir Lot was not yet decided, but that it would\nbe fo at the lafl: Judgment. 7\u00b7 Who, when he\nfeerh .Angels painted or carved, doth not acknowl.\nedge tl1at they are fuch ? \\Vho ever imagines at\nfuch Times that they are Spirits without a Body,\nAirs, or Clouds, as fame of the Learned do ?\n8. The Papifls believe their Saints \u00b7to be Men in\nHeaven, and others elfe\\vhere ; the Mahometans\nthink the fame of their Dead ; fo do the Africans\nmore efpecially, and in like Manner many other\nNations; what then ought not reformed Chrifi:ians\nto do, who know it from the \\Vord ? 9\u00b7 To this\nKnowledge inherent in every one, it is alfo owing,\nthat fame afpire after immortal Fame, for this\nKnowledge is converted into the Love \u00b7of fuch\nFame with fame, and makes them Heroes and val.\niant in 'War. 10. Inquiry was made in the fpirit.\nual \\Vorld, whether this Knowledge is inherent in\nall, and it was found, that it is fo in the fpiritual\nIdea of all, which is of the internal Thought, but\nnot fo in their natural Idea, which is of the external\nThought. From thefe Confiderations it may ap.\npear, that no one ought to infer any Doubt againfi:\nthe Divine Providence> becaufe he thinks it is now\nfirfi: difcovered that Man liveth after Death. It is\nonly the fenfual [Mind] of Man, which defireth\nto fee and touch what it is to believe ; he whofe\nThoughts are not elevated above this, is involved\nin Darknefs \\vith RefpeCl: to the State of his Life.\nThat\nI\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 399\nTlzat Evils ate \u00b7permitted for a certain\nEnd, which End is Salvation.\n. 275. IFMan \\vete born in the Love; to \"Yhich he\n. is created, he would not be in any Evil,.\nyea, neither would he know what Evil is, for he\nwho hath not been, and thereby is not in Evil, can~\nnot know what Evil is ; if it fhould be faid to him\nthat this or that is Evil, he would not believe it pof..\nfible ; this State is the State of Innocence, in which\nAdam and his 'Wife Eve were ; their Nakednefs,\nof which they were not afhamed, fignified fuch a\nState. The Knowledge of Evil after the Fall i~\nmeant by eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good\nand Evil. The Love for which Man is created, is\nthe Love of his Neighbour, that he may wifh him as\nwell as he wifheth himfelf, and more fo, and that he.\nmay be in the Delight of that Love, when he doeth\nGood to him, juft as a Parent is in doing Good to\nhis Children. This Love is truly human, for in it\nthere is Something fpiritual, whereby it is difiin.\nguifhed from natural Love, which takes Place in\nBrute Animals : If !\\'Ian were born into this Love,\nhe would not be born in the Darknefs of Ignorance,\nas is no\\v the Cafe with every Man, but to a certain\nLight of Knowledge [Scientice] and thence of Intel.\nligence, into which he would alfo enter in a !hart\nTime ; and indeed he would at firil creep like a.\n~adruped, but with an innate Endeavour to raif~\nhimfelf upon his Feet ; for although he would\ncreep, yet he would not look down to the Ground,\nbut\n\f400 ANGELIC \u00b7\\V.rs.DOM CONCERNING\nbut upwards to Heaven, and \\vould lift himfelf, as\nit would be in his Power to do, upright.\n276. But when th~ .Lov.e of Man's N~ighbour'\nwas converted into the Love t>f Self, then human\nLove was converted into animal Love, and Man\nfrom being Man, became a Beail:, with this-Differ-\nence; that he could think that which he felt i.n the\nBody; and rationally diil:inguifh the one from the\nother, and could be inihud:ed, and made a civil and\u00b7\nmoral Man, and at length fpiritual ; for, as was' ob-\n' fen\u00b7ed; Man hath a fpiritual Principle, 'whereby he\nis diflinguifhed from Brute Animals ; for by it he\ncan know what civil Evil and Good is, likewife.\nwhat moral Evil and Good is, and alfo, if he will,\nwhat fpiritual Evil and Good is. When neighbour-\n1y Love was converted into Self-LoYe, Man could\nno longer be born into the Light of Science and\nIntelligence, but into the Darknefs of Ignorance,\nbecaufe he was born totally in the Ultimate of Life;\nwhich is called the corporeal jcJyual Principle ; but\nfrom it could be introduced by lnfhucrion into the\nInteriors of the natural Mine, Something fpiritual\nalways attending. The Rea:fon why he is born in\nthe Ultimate of Life, which is called the corporeal\nfenfual Principle, and confequently in the Darknefs\nof Ignorance, will be feen in what follows. That\nthe Love of our Neighbour and the Love of Self\nare oppofite Loves, any one may fee ; for neigh\u00b7\nhourly Love wi!heth well to all from itfelf ; but\nSelf-LO\\\u00b7e wifheth well to itfelf alone from all ;\nneighbourly Love defireth to fe.rve all, but Self\u00b7\nLove defireth to be ferved by all ; neighbourly\nLove confiden;'':111 as h.is Brothers and Friends, but\nSelf-Love\n\fTtu: DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 401\nSelf-Love confiders all as his Servants, and if they\ndo not ferve hie1, as his Enemies ; in a \"\\\\rord, he\nconfiders himfelf alone, and others fcarcely as Men:t\nwhom in his Heart he values lefs th:m his Horfes\nand Dogs; and inafmuch as he thinks them fo vile,\nhe makes no Account of injuring them, whence pro-\nceed Hatred and Revenge, Adultery and Fornica-\ntion, Thefts and :Frauds, Lies and Bbfphemies,\nRage, Cruelty, and the like. Thefe are the Evils\nin which Man is by Birth. That thefe arc Rennit-\nted for a certain End, which End is Salvation, fl1all\nbe demonll:rated in the follo\u00b7wing Order. I. That\nevery Man is in Evil, and that he is to be withdrawn\nfrom Evil that he may be reformed. II. That Evils\ncannot be removed except they appear. III. That\nin Proportion as Evils are removed, in the fame Pro-\nportion they are remitted. IV. That thus the Per-\nmillion of Evil is to the End that there may be Sal-\nvation.\nzn. I. That every Man is in E?.,il, and that be is\nto be withdrawn from E\u00b7vil that he may be reformed.\nThat every Mz.n hath hercditz.ry Evil, and that from\nit Man is in the Concupifcence of mrtny F.vils, is\nwell kno'sn in the Ch11rch ; ann thence it i::; that\n:i\\Ian from himfelf cannot do Good, for E~\u00b7il doth\nnot do Go,Jd, except it be fuch Good as hath Evil\nlurking \\vithin it; the Evil '.':hich lurks within it~\nconfifi:s in his doing Gootl for the Sake of Seif, and\nthus doing what is good only in Appearance. Tk1t\nthis Evil is ~ereditary from Patents, is well known;\nit is faid to be fro1n 1\n-\\dam and Eve, but this is a\nl\\:!i!l:ake ; for every one ~s born into it from his Pa-\nrent, and that Parent is born into it from hi3, :lnd\nC e c lo\n\f402 ANGELIC '\\VISDOM CONCER~ING\nfo every one from his own Parent refpeB:ively, and\nthus it is fucccilively transferred from one to anoth\u00b7\ner, whereby it increafes and augments itfel.f abun.\ndantly, and is tranfmitted to Pofl:erity ; thence it is\nthat in Man there is no Health, or Nothing found)\nbut that he is one entire Mafs of Evil: Who is there\nthat feels, that to love himfelf more than others is.\nEvil, and therefore who knows that there is any\nEvil in it, when neverthelcf~ it is the Head of all\nEvils ? That it is inherited from Fathers, Grandfa-\nthers, and Great Grandfathers, is evident from\nmany Circumfl:ances which are known in the World,:\nas from the Similarity of Faces in Houfes, Families,\nyea in whole Nations, whereby they are diflinguifh...\nable, and Faces are the Types of Minds, and the\nState of Minds is conformable to their AffeCtions\nwhich are of Love; fometimes alfo the Face of the\nGrandfather returns in the Granachild or Great-\nGrandchild: I can tell from only feeing the Face\n' of any Perfon; whether lfe\u00b7 is a Jew or not; and\nalfo offome others from what Stoek they are deriv..\ned ; and I doubt not but there are others who can\ndo the fame. If the AffeCtions, whieh are of Love,.\nare thus derived and tranfmitted from Parents, it\nfollows, that it is the fame with Evils, becaufe thefe\nappertain to the AffeCtions. But the Caufe of this\nRefemblance fhall now be explained; the Soul of\nevery one is from his Father, and is 0nly clothed\nwith a Body frotn his Mother ; that the Soul is de-\nrived from the Father, follows as a Confequence not\nonly from what hath been faid above, but is alff>\u00b7\nevident from other Circumfl:ances, as that the Chilu\nof a Negro o~ Moor, by a white Woman or Euro1\npean~\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENC.E. 403\npean, is born black, and vice vcifa ; and efpecially\nby Reafon that the Soul is in the Seed, for from\nit Impregnation is effeCted, and it is that which\nis cloathed with a Dody from the Mother; for\nthe Seed is the primitive Form G.f the Love in\nwhich the Father is, it is the Form of his ruling\nLove, with its proximate Derivations, which are the\ninmofl: Affecrions of that Love. Thefe in every one\nare cloathed in the Decencies [ Homftis] of moral\nLife, and the Goods which are partly of civil and\npartly of fpiritual Life ; thefe confl:itute the Exter-\nnal of Life even with the \\:Vicked ; Every Infant is\nborn into this External of Life ; hence it is that it is\namiable, but as he grows up and advances to mature\nAge, he paifeth from that External to Interiors, a~d\nat length to the ruling Love of his Father, which\njf it was evil, and be ndt tempered and bent by\nMeans of Education, his Love becometh like his\nFather's. Still however Evil is not extirpated, but\nonly removed, as will be fhewn in what follows.\nHence it is evident, that every Man is in Evil.\n277. That Man is to be withdrawn from Evil,\nin Order that he may be reformed, is evident with~\nout Explanation; for he who is in Evil in the\n'Vorld, the fame is in Evil after he goes out of the\n\\Vorld; wherefore if Evil be not removed in the\nWorld, it cannot be removed afterwards; where the\nTree falls, there it lieth ; fa alfo it is with the Life\nof Man' ; as it was at his Death, fuch it remaineth ;\nevery one alfo is judged according to his ACl:ions,\nnot that they are enumerated, but becaufe he re-\nturns to them, and does the like again ; for Death\n;s a Continuation of Life, with this Difference, th~t\nthen\n\u2022\n\f404 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nthen 1\\lan cannot be reformed. All Reformation\nis eff~Cted in a plenary Manner~ th;tt is, in Primaries\nand at the fame Time in Ultimates, and Ultimates\nare reformed in this \\Vorld conformably to Prima-\nries, and cannot be fo afterwards, becaufe the Ul-\ntimates of Life, which Man carrieth with him after\nDeath, are quiefcent, and confpire, that is, aa ai\none, with his Interiors. \u00b7\n278. II. That E;vil.r cannot be removed except they\nappear. It is not meant that Man is to do Evils\nthat they may appear, b)lt that he is to examine him-\nfelf, not only his Acrions but alio his Thoughts,\nand what he would do, if he were not afraid of the\nI~aws and Infamy.; efpecially what Evils he con-\nfiders in his Spirit as allowable, and does not loo'k\nupon as Sins, for thefe he fl:ill comrnitteth. To the\nEnd that Man may explore himfelf, Underfl:anding\njs given him, and this feparate from the \\Viii, in\nOrder th:1t he may know, underfland, and ac-\nknowledge what is Good and is Evil, and may alfo\nfee the Nature of his Will, or what he lm\u2022eth and\nwhat he coveteth; that Man may fee this, his Un,.\nderftanding is gifted with fuperior and inferior\nThought, or interior and exterior, that from his\nfuperior or interior Thought he may fee what his\n\u00b7will is doing in his inferior and exterior Thought )\nthis he feeth as a Man feeth his Face in a Glafs,\n~nd when he feeth this, and knoweth what Sin is,\nhe may, if he implores the Help of the Lord, not\nwill it, but 1hun it, and afterwards aa againfl: it,\nif not freely, fl:ill he may force himfelf to it by Com-\nbat, and at length hold it in Averfion and abomi~\nn:1te it; and then l~e firij: perceivcth and alfo feel-\neth1\nI\n\fTHE DIViNE PRoVIDENcE: 405\net'h, that Evil is Evil, and Good is Good, and not\nl:lefore. This then is examining or exploring him-\nfelf, feeing his Sins, and acknowledging them, con-\nfelling them, and afterwards defill:.ing from them.\nBut forafmuch as there are few who know, that\nthe very EiTence of the Chrifiian Religion confifls\nin this, becaufc they only who do fo have Charity\nand Faith, :and are led of the Lord, and do Good\nfrom Him, Something fhall be faid of thofe who do\npot do fo, and yet think they have Religion in\nthem ; thefe are fuch as follow. I. \u00b7who confefs\nthemfelves guilty of all Sins, and do not iearch\nout any one Sin in themfelves. z. Vlho from a\nPrinciple of Religion omit fuch Inquiry or Search.\n3\u00b7 Who by Reafon of worldly Things do not\nthink of Sins, and confequently do not know them.\n4\u00b7 \\Vho favour them, and therefore cannot know\n~hem. 5\u00b7 That in all fuch as tbefe Sins do not ap-\npear, and that therefore they cannot be removed.\n15. Lafl:ly, fhall be laid open the Caufe, hitherto\nunknown, why Evils cannot be removed, without\nthe Search, Appearance, Acknowledgment, Con-\nfeilion thereof, and Refifl:ance thereto.\nz78. But thefe Points fhall be viewed feparately,\nbecaufe they are Primaries or Fundamentals of the\nChrifl:ian Religion on the Part of Man. FrRsT:\nOf thofe who conjefi then!felves guilty of all Sins, and\ndo not fearch out any Sin in then!felvcs, faying, I am\na Sinner, I was born in Sin, there is no Health in\n111e from Head to Foot, I am Nothing but Evil,\ngood God, have Mercy upon me, forgive me, pu-\nrify me, fave me, caufe me to walk in Purity of\nJ,ife, and in the Way of Uprightnefs, and the like;\nand\n\f406 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nand yet he doth not examine hirnfelf, and confe..\nquently doth not know any Evil, and no one can\nilmn that which he cloth not know, much lefs fight\nagainft it ; and after his Confeffion he alfo thinketh\nhimfelf clean and \\vafhed, when neverthelefs he\nis unclean and unwafhed from Head to Foot; for\nthe Confeffion of all is the quieting or laying afleep\nof all, and at length rhe blinding of all ; it is like\nSomething general without any Particular, which\nis not any Thing. SECONDLY : Of thofe who frrmt\nthe Princ~b\/es of their Religion omit Juch Inquiry l\nthey are fuch efpecially as feparate Charity from\nFaith ; for they fay to themfelves, why fhould I\ninquire whether it be Evil or Good? Why wheth-\ner it be Evil, fince Evil doth not condemn me ?\nAr!d why V>hether ic be Good, fince Good doth\nnot fave me? It is Faith alone, thought and pro-\nnounced with Confidence and Affurance, which\njuflifieth and purifieth from all Sin, and when I am\nonce juftified, I am pure in the Sight of God; I am\ninJeed in Evil, but this, as foon as it is produced,\nGod wipeth away, and fo it doth not appear any\nmore; not to mention other ,Notions of the fame\nKind. But \\vho doth not fee, if he opens his Eyes,\nthat fuch are empty \\:Vords, which have no Sub-\nHar.cc in th(;ln, becaufe they have no Good in\nthem? \\Vho may not think and fpeak thus, even\nwith Confidence and .A:ffurance, when at the fame\nTime he thinketh of Hell and eternal Damnation ?\nDoth fuch a one deilrc to know any Thing elfe,\nwhether it be true or whether it be good? OfTruth\nhe faith, what is Truth but that which confirmeth\nfuch a Faith ? Of Good h~ faith, what is Good\nbut\n\f\\\nTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 407\nbut that which is in me from this Faith? But in\nOrder that it may be in me, I will not do it as from\nmyfelf, becaufe that is meritorious:> and meritorious\nGood is not real Good ; thus he omitteth all Things\nuntil he doth not know what Evil is; what can he\nthen fearch out or fee in himfelf? Is not his State in\nthis Cafe fuch, that the Fire of the Concupifcel}ces\u00b7 \u00b7\nof Evil being inclofed confumeth his Interiors, and\ndevafl:ates them even to the Gate, which he keepeth\nfhut left the Fire fhould appear?\u00b7 Neverthelefs it is\nopened after Death, and then appeareth in the Sight\nof every one. THIRDLY:\u00b7 Of thofe who by Rcafon\nifworldly 'Things do not think ofSins, and w!fequent-'\nly do not know tbem ; thefe are fuch as love the\n\"\\Vorld above all Things, and do not admit any\nTruth which may withdraw them from the Falfes of\ntheir Religion, faying to themfelves, what have I to'\ndo with this ? I do not love to think ofit; thus they\nrejeCt: Truth as foon as they hear it, and if they hear\nit they fuffocate it. 'the Cafe is nearly the fame\nwith them when they hear Preachings, of which\nthey retain only fome of the \\Verds, and not any\nof the Subfl:ance.- Forafmuch as Truths are treat-\ned in this Manner by them, therefore they do not\nknow what Good is, for Truth and Good aCt as\none, and by Good which i:; not grounded ~n Truth,\nno Difcovery is made of Evil, except that it alfo\nmay be called Good, which is effeCted by reafoning\nfrom Falfes. Thefe are they who are meant by\nthe Seed which fell among Thorns, of whom the\nLord faith, \" Other Seed fell among Thorns ; and\nthe Thorns fprung up and choked them.\" Thefe\nare they too who\" hear the \\Vord, and the Care of\"\nthis\n\f408 ANGILIC \\Vrs\u00b7noM CONCERNING\nthis World and the Deceitfulnefs of Riches choke\nthe Word, and it becometh unfuitful,\" Matt. xiii.\n7, 22. Mark iv. 7, 14. Luke viii. 7, 14. FoURTH\u2022\n.LY : Of thoft who favouY Sins, and therefore cannot\n\/:now them: Thefe are they who acknowledge God,\nand worfhip him accm\u00b7ding to the~ uiual Forms~\nbut confirm themfelves in the Idea, that any EYil,\nwhich is a Sin, is not a Sin, for they difguife it by\nFallacies and Appearances, and fo hide its Enor~\nn1ity; which when they have done, they favour it,\nand make it friendly and familiar to them. It is\nfaid that they do thi\u2022s, who acknowledge a God1\nl>ecaufe others do not confider any Evi-l as a Sin,\nfor every Sin is an OfFence againfl: God. But this\n:fhall be illuftrated by Examples: He doth not con,;\n:fider Evil as Sin, who is covetous of Money, and\nmaketh any Species of Fraud allowable, by Rea..\nfans whieh he fabricates : It is the fame with him\nwho confirmeth himfelf in the Lawfulnefs of Re...\n'\\Tenge againfl: Enemies, and of committing Depre~\ndations upon thofe who are not Enemies in \u00b7war.\nFIFTHLY: That Sins with fuch do not a.vpear, and\ntherefore cannot be removed; all Evil which doth\nJlot appear, kindleth itfclf, being like Fire among\nWood under the Afhes ; and it is like corrupted\nMatter in a \\Vound which is not laid open; fqr\nall Evil which is obfl:rucred increafeth, and doth\nnot ceafe until the whote is confummated ; where-\nfore left any Evil fhonld be obfirucred, it is per.\nmitted that every one fuould think either in Favour\nof God or againfl: God, and in Favour of the holy\nThings of the Church, or againft them, and fhould\nnot be punifhed for the fame in this World. Con-\ncernmg\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 409\ncerning this Evil the Lord faith in Ifaiah, \" 'From\nthe Sole of the Foot even unto the Head, there is\nno Soundnefs in it ; but Vlounds and Bruifes\nand putrifying Sores : They have not beeQJ\nclofed, neither bound up, nor mollified with Oil.\n\\Vafh ye, make you clean, put away the Evil of\nyour Doings from before mine Eyes; ceafe to do\nEvil ; learn to do Good; then although your Sins\nbe as Scarlet, they \u00a3hall be as white as Snow, though\nthey be red like Crimfon, they {hall be as \\Vool.\nBut if ye refufe and rebel, ye \u00a3hall be devoured\nwith the Sword,\" i. 6, z6, 18, 20 ; to be devoured\nwith the Sword fignifies to perith by the Falfe of\nEvil. SIXTHLY : The Recifon, hitherto concealed,\nwhy Evils cannot be removed \u2022without being explored,\nappearing, being ackno'l.o!edged, confejfed, and re.fified.\nIn the preceding Pages it is mentioned, that the\nuniverfal Heaven is arranged into Societies accord-\ning to the Affections of Good oppofite to the Con-\ncupifcences of Evil; Every Man, with RefpeCl: to\nhis Spirit, is in fome Society, in a celeflial Society\nif he is in the Affection of Good, and in an infernal\nSociety if he is in the Concupifcence of Evil; 1\\Jan\ndoth not know this while he lives in this \u00b7world,\nbut yet with Refpect to his Spirit he is in fome So~\nciety, without which he could not live, and by\nwhich he is governed of the Lord : If he is in an\ninfernal Society, he cannot be brought out of it by\nthe Lord, but according to the Laws of his Divine\nProvidence, among which this alfo is one, that Man\nmufl: fee that he is there, and defire to depart, and\nmufl: himfelf endeavour to do it from himfelf; this\nMan can do when he is in the \\Vorld, but not afr~r\nJ) D d l)eath,\n\f410 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERN'ING\n'\nDeath, for then lie abideth to all Eternity in the Sa4\nciety, into which he introduced himfelf, when ha\nwas in the World : This is the Reafon, why Man\nought to\u00b7 examine himfelf, to fee and acknowledgn\nhis Sins, and to repent of them, and then to perfe~\nvere to his Life's End. That this is the Cafe, I\ncould fully and fatisfaCl:orily confirm by abundaqt\nExperience ; but to produce Proofs from Experi-\nence doth not belong to this Place.\n279\u00b7 III. 'I'hat in Prvportion as Evils 'are re-\nmoved, in thefame Propo~\u00b7tion tbey are remitted. The\nError of this Age is, ~hat Evils are thought to be\n- feparated from\u00b7 Man, yea to be cafl: out, when they\nare remitted; ai'ld that the\u00b7State of a Man's Life\ncan be changed in a Moment,. even ~o its Oppofite-,\nand that thus\u00b7 a Man from being wicked can be\nmade good,. confequemly brought out of Hell.,\nand infl:antly tranflated to Heaven, and- this by the\nimmediate M\u00b7ercy o-f the Lord : But they who are\nin this Belief and Opi-nion,. do not in the leafl: know\n\\Yhat Evil and Good are, neither do they know any\nThing of the State of Man's Life ; and they ar-a:\naltogether ignorant, that the Affdtions, which are\nof the 'Will, are mere Changes and Variations of\nthe State of the purely organic Subfl:anc!!s of the\nMind, and that the Thoughts, whiah ars of the\nl:Jnderftanding, are mere Changes and Var.iations\nof their Form ; and that the Memory is t-he perma-\nnent State of thefe Changes. From a Knowledge\nof this, it may clearly be feen, that no Evil can be\nremoved except fucceffively ; ami that the Remif...\nfion of Evil is not the Removal thereof. But thefe\nrl'hings are here only\"aiferted in\u00b7a fummary \u00b7way;.\nunlefs\n\f~mlefs however they arc demonfl:rated, they may\n;ndcecl be acknowledged, but not comprehended ;\n;md that which is not comprehended, is like a\n\\Vheel \\vhich is turned about by the Hand; where.\nfore the above-mentioned Propofitions fhall be dem~\npnfl:;rat.ed feparately in the fame Order in which\nthey are adduced. FIRST: That it is an Error cf\nthe ptefent Age, that Evils arf thought to be Jeparated,\nyea cafl out, when they ar.e remitted. That no Evil~\ninto whicl]. a Man is born, and which he aCtually\nimbibes, is fep;;tq.ted from him1 but that it is only\nremoved, in fuch a Manner that it doth pot appear,\nhath been given me to know from Heaven; befor~\nthat, I was in the Belief which moft People entertain\nin this vVorld, that Evils, when they are remitted,\n~re cafl: out, and that they are wafhed off and wiped\naway, like Dirt from the Face by Water: :But this\nis not the Cafe with Evils or Sins; they all remain,\nand when they ar.e remitted after Repentance, they\nare remor~d from the Middle to the Sides, and\nthen that which is in the Middle, jnafmuch as i.t i,s\ndireCtly 4nder th~ Infpetl:ion, appears as in th~\nLight of Day, and that which i$ at the Sides, in\ntpe Shade, anq Sometimes as it were in the Dark.\npefs of N~g~t: And whereas Evils are not feparated,\n,, but only removed, that is~ :put away to the Sides,\ncmd M<ln n'\\ay b~ tran,sferred fro.m th.e Middle t<;:t\nthe Circumference, it may al(o come to pafs, that\nhe may return to his Evils, which he thought re.\njeCted: For Man is -of fuch a Nature, that he can\npafs from one AfFeCtion to another, and fometimes\nto an oppofite one, and fo from one Middle, qr\n~e.11-tr~, [ a:b uno Mcdio] to another, the AffeCtion\nQf\n\f'\n412 ANGELIC \\V!SDO~l CONCERNING\nof Man confiituting the Middle or Centre while he\ni~ in it, for he is then in the Delight and in the Light\nthereof. There are fome Men, who after Death\nare taken up by the Lord into Heaven, becaufe they\nhad led a good Life, but fl:iil carried with them a\nBelief, that they were cleanfed and pure from Sins,\nand therefore not in a State of Guilt ; thefe are at\nfirfl: cloathed in white Garments according to fuch\nPerfuafion, for white Garments fignify a State of\nPurification from Evils ; but afterwards they be..\ngin to think, as they did in the \\Vorld, that they\n;1re wafhed clean as ir were from all Evil, and\ntherefore come to boafl: that they are no long-\ner Sinners like others, which Perfuafion is diffi-\ncult to be feparated from a certain Exultation of\nMind, and fome Degree of Contempt for others\nwhen compared with themfelves ; therefore that\nthis imaginary Belief may be removed, they are\nthen remanded from Heaven, and let into their\nEvils which they had contraCted in the World,\nand at the fame Time it is fhewn them, that they\nare in hereditary Evils, which they knew Nothing\nof before : And when they have thus been forced\nto acknO\\vledge, that their Evils are not feparated\nfrom them, but only removed, and fo that of them-\nfelves they are impure, yea Nothing but Evil, and\nthat it is by the Lord that they are detained\nfrom Evils, and kept in Good, and that this appears\nto them as from' themfelves, they are again taken\nup by the Lord into Heaven. SECONDLY : '.That\nit is an Error of the prejent Age, that it is thought\nthe State if ]\\,fan's Life can be changed in a Moment,\nand that thus Man from being \u00b7wicked can be made\ngood, cm!fi\u00b7quently brought out of Hell, and injlantly\ntrm?flatcd\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 413\ntrm!}lated into !leaven, and thh by the immediau\n\/1-'lcrcy of the Lord: They are in this Error, who\nfeparate Charity from Faith, and place Salvation in\nl''aith alone, for they imagine that the bare think-\ning and uttering of the \\Vords adopted by that\nFaith, if it be done with Conftdence and Affurance,\njufl:ifieth and faveth ; which Effea is alfo fuppofeu\nby fame to be momentaneous, and if not before,\nyet at the lafl: Hour of a Man's Life ; fuch Perfons\ncannot but think, that Man's State.of Life can be\nchanged in a Moment, and that he can be faved by\nimmediate Mercy : But that the Mercy of the\nLord is not immediate, and that Man from being\u00b7\nwicked cannot be made good in a Moment, and led\nout of Hell and tranflated into Heaven, but by con-\ntinual Operations of the Divine Providence from\nhis Infancy to the End of his Life, will be feen in the\nlafl: Paragraph of this Treatife : \\Ve fhall here only\nobferve, that the Laws of the Divine Providence\nhave all of them for their End the Reformation and\nthereby the Salvation of Man, \u00b7 confequently the\nlnverfion of his State, which by Birth is infernal, to\nits Oppofite, which is celeflial ; and this can only\nbe effefl:ed progrefiively, as Man recedcth from\nEvil and the Delight thereof, and entereth into\nGood and its Delight. THIRDLY : That they 'who\nare of tbis Opinion, know not at all 'what is Evil and\nwhat is Good: For they do not know, that Evil is\nthe Delight of the Concupifcence of aCl:ing and\nthinking contrary to Divine Order, and that Good\njs the Delight of the AffeCtion of aEtiug and think-\ning according to Divine Order, and that there are\nMyriads of Concupifcences, which enter as Ingrc~\ndients and compofe every Evil, and that there are\nMyriads\n\f414 ANGELic WisDoM coNc.ERNiNe\nMyriads of AffeCl:ions, which in li~e- Manner enter\nevery Good as its Ingredients and compofe it,\n<1nd that thefe Myriads of Concupifcences and Af-\nfeCl:ions exift in fuch Order and Connexion in the\nInteriors of Man, that no one of them can be\nchanged, without changing the whole at the far.1~\nTime. They who do not know this, may think\nor belieYe, that Evil, which appears to them as one,\ncan eafily be removed, and that Good, which alfo\nappears as one, can be introduced in its Place.,\nThefe, inafmuch as they do not know what Evil is,\nand what Good, cannot but fuppofe that there i~\nfuch a Thing as momentaneous Salvation and im~\nmediate Mercy ; but that thef~ are not poffible,\nwill be feen in the laft Paragraph of this Treatife.\nFouRTHLY: 'Fhat they who believe in momentaneozu\nSalvation and immediate IVIercy, do not k;zow that th~\nAffiCliom, which are ifthe Will, are mere Changes and\nVariations ofthe State of the purely organic Sul!flances\nifthe Mind; and that the Thougbts, 'l.vbicb are ofthe\nUnde1jlanding, are mere Changes and Variatio1Zs of\ntheir Form; and that the Memory is the permanent\nState of thofe ChangeJ\u00b7 and Variations.

A fatisfac-\ntory Anfwer may be deduced from all and every\nThing in the Body, where there are many Vifcera,\neach fixed in its particular Situation, and which op\u00b7\n~rate their Funtl:ions by Changes and Variations of\ntheir State and Form ; that they are feverally em-\nployed in their refpeaive Operations, is well known,\nthe Stomach in operating its FunCl:ions,. and fo the\nlnteilines, the Kidneys, the Liver, Pancreas, and\nSpleen in theirs, and likewife the Heart and Lungs,\neach in its refpeaive Office1 and all thefe Motions\nare operated only intrinfically or within themfelves,\nand to be moved intrinfically is to operate by Vari-\nations of State and Form. Hence it may appear,\nthat the\u00b7Operations of the purely organic Subfian-\nces of the Mind are of a fimilar Nature, only with\nthis Difference, that the Operations of the organic\nSubfl:ances of the Body are natural, and thofe of the\norganic Subfl:ances of the Mind are fpiritual, and\nthat both thefe aCl: as one by Correfpondences.\nThere can be no ocular Demonfl:ration of the\nChanges and Variations of State and Form in the\n~rganic Subfl:ances of the Mind, which are Affec-\ntions,\n\f416 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\n[ions, but yet they may be feen as .it were in a\nGlafs, by .the Changes and Variations of the State\nof the Lungs in fpeaking and 11nging, there being\na Correfpondence, inafmuch as the Sound of the\nVoice in Speak1ng. and Singing, and alfo the Artic-\nulations of Sound, which are the \u00b7wor'ds in Speech\n;md the l\\Iodulations of the Voice in Singing, are\neffeB:cd by the Lungs, and Sound correfponds to\nAffeCtion, and Speech to Thought ; they are alfo\nproduced thereby, and this is done by Changes and\nVariations of the State and Form of the organic\nSubfiances of the Lungs, and from the Lungs by\nthe Trachea or \\Vind-pipe in the Larynx and Glot\u00b7\ntis, and afterwards in the Tongue, and lafl:ly in the\nMouth and Lips ; the firfr Changes and Variations\nof the State and Form of Sound are produced in the\nLungs, the fecond in the Trachea and Larynx, the\nthird in the Glottis b)r various Openings of its Ori\u00b7\n' fice, the fourth in the Tongue by its various Appli-\ncations to the Palate and Teeth, the fifth in the Lips\nby difpofing them in various Forms: Hence it maY'\nappear, that the mere Changes and Variations of\nthe State of organic Forms, fucceffively continued,.\nproduce Sounds and the Articulations thereof,\nwhich are Speech and Singing. Now fbrafmuch.\nas Sound and Speech are produced from no other\nSource than from the AffeB:ions and Thoughts of\nthe Mind, for from the latter the former exifl:, and\n11ever without them, it is evident that the AffeB:ions\nof the \\Vill are Changes and Variations of the State\nof the purely organic Subfl:ailces of the Mind, and\nthat the Thoughts of the Underftanding are Chang-\nes and Variations of the Form of thofe Subftances;\nfi.milar\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 4I7\nfimilar to what hath jufr been infranced in the\nLungs. Forafmuch as Affeftions and Thoughts\nare mere Changes of the State of the Forms of the\nMind, it follows, that the Memory is Nothing clfe\nbut the permanent State thereof; for all Changes\nand Variations of State in organic Sub\/lances are of\nfu;:h a Nature, that when once they become habitual,\nthey are permanent; thus the Lungs are habituated\nto produce various Sounds in the Trachea, and to\nvary them in the Glottis, to articulate them in the\nTongue, and to modify them in the Mouth, and\nwhen thofe Organs an: once habituated to them,\nthey are in them, and can be reproduced. That\nthefe Changes and Variations are infinitely more\nperfeCt: in the Organs of the Mind, than in the Or-\ngans of the Body, is evident from what is faid in\nthe Treatifc concerning THE DrviNE LovE .AND\nTHE DiviNE WisDoM, n. I I 9 to 204, where it is\nfhewn, that all Perfections increafe and afcend with\nDegrees, and according to them : On this Subject\nmore may be feen below, n. 3I 9\u00b7\n28o. To fuppofe that Sins, when they are remit-\nted, are alfo removed, is likewife an Error of this\nAge; they are in this Error, who think that by the\nSacrament of the Lord's Supper their Sins are remit-\nted, although they have not removed them from\nthemfelves by Repentance: They alfo are in this Er~\nror, who think to be faved by Faith alone; and they\nwho thi:1k to be faved by Difpenfations from the\nPope; all thefe believe in immedi~te 1\\lercy and mo~\nmentaneons SaiY<Ition. But when thi.> Propofition\nis reverfed, thea it becomes a Truth, namdy, that\nwhen Sins arc removed, the:: are .-,lfo remitted ; for\nE .10 e R~pentance\n\f418 ANGELIC \\V!SDO:t.l CONCERNING\nR epentance muft precede Remiffion, and without\nRepentance there is no Remiffion ; wherefore the\nLord commanded his D ifciples to preach Repent\u00b7\nance for the Remifi:on of Sins, Luke xxiv. 27 :\n1\\nd John preached the llaptifm of Repentance for\nthe RcmiiT:on of Sins, Luke iii. 3\u00b7 The Lord re-\nmitteth the Sins of all Men, he doth not accufe and\nimpute, but yet he cannot take them away but ac-\ncording to the Laws of his Divine Providence; for\nfince he faid to Peter (who aiked him how often he\nfhould forgi\\'e his Brother when he finned againfl\nhim, whether till fe\\\u00b7en Times) that he ought to for-\ngive him not cnly feven Times, but fcventy Times\nfeven, 11att. x\\\u00b7iii. 2 I, 2 2 ; what then will not the\nLord do, \u00b7who is Mercy itfelf?\n281. IV. 'That thus the Pcrmf!Jion if E'L\u2022il is fer\na certain End, \u00b7z.ohich End is Salvation. It is well\nknown, that l\\lan\u00b7 is in full Liberty to think and\nwill, but not in full Liberty to fpeak and aEl: \"'hat~\nfoe\"er he thinketh and willcth, for he may think ::~s\nan Atheift, deny a God, and blafphemc the holy\nThings of the \\Vord and of the Church, yea, he\nmay will in Y\\Tord and in Deed utterly to defhoy\nthem ; Lut this latter is prevented by civil, moral,\nand ecclefidl:ical Laws, wherefore he inwz.rdly cher-\nifhes thefe impious and wicked Suggeftions, by\nthinking and willing, or wif'ning, and alfo by intend.\ning them, but not by doing them. A Man, who is\nnot an Atbcift, is alfo at full Liberty to think many\nThings which ::~rc of Evil, as Things fraudulent~\nlakivious, vindiCtive, and other Infanities, which he\nalfo does at Times. Who can believe, that unlefs\n!vlan had f,.lll Liberty, he not only could not 'be\nfaved,\n\fTnE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 419\nfaved, but would even perifh totally? Hear now the\nCaufe of this ; every Man from his Birth is in Evils\nof many Kinds; tbefe Evils are in his \\ViH, and\nthe Things which are in the \\Vill are loved, for\nthat which a Man willetl1 from his Interior, the\nfame he loveth, and that which he loveth, the fame\nhe willeth ; and the Love of the Will Howeth into\nthe Underfl:anding, and there caufeth its Delight to\nbe felt : Hence it cometh into the Thoughts, and\nalfo into the Intentions ; wherefore if it were not\npermitted Man to think according to the Love of\nhis \u00b7will, which is hereditarily inherent in him,\nthat Love would continue fhut up, and would never\ncome to Sight ; and the Love of Evil, which doth\nnot appear, is like an Enemy lying in wait, like cor-\nrupted Matter in an Ulcer, like Poifon in the Blood,\nand like Rottennefs in the Breafl: ; which, if they\nare kept inclofed, are the Caufes of Death. But\nwhen a Man is permitted to think the Evils of his\nLife's Love, even fo far as to intend them, they\nare cured by fpiritual Means, as Difeafes are by\nnatural 1\\leans. \\Vhat would be Man's State\nand Nature, if it were not permitted him to think\naccording to the Delights of his Life's Love,\n:lhall now be {hewn : He would no longer be 1\\'Ian,\nfor he would lofe the two Faculties, which are call.\ned Liberty and Rationality, in which Humanity ity\nfelf confifls ; the Delights of the above Evils would\noccupy the Interiors of his lVIind in fuch a. Degree,\nthat they would overcome all Refl:rainr, and open\nthe Door, and then he could not help fpeaking and\n:td:ing according to the Ddights of thofe Evils, and\nthus would be infane, and his Infanity would not\nonly\n\f420 ANGELIC WrsDOM CONCERNING\nonly be known to himfelf, but would alfo appear\nto the \u00b7world, and at length he would not have the\nSenfe to cover his Nakednefs: But to prevent this\nbeing the Cafe, he is permitted indeed to think and\nto will his hereditary Evils, but not to fpeak and do\nthem ; and in the mean Time he learns Things\nciYil, moral, and fpiritual, which alfo enter into his\nThoughts, and remove thefe Infanities, and thereby\nhe is healed of the Lord, but yet no farther than to\nknow how to keep the Door fhut, unlefs he alfo ac.,.\nknowledge a God, and implore his Affifl:ance, that\nhe may be able to refifl: the above Evils : And fo\nfar as he then refifis, fo far he doth not admit them\ninto his Intentions, and at length neither into his\nThoughts. Since then Man is at Liberty to think\nas he pleafes, to the End that his Life's Love may\ncome forth from its lurking Place into the Light of\nhis Underftanding, and fmce otherwife he would\nnot know any Thing of his own Evil, and confe.,.\nquently would not know how to e~pel it, it follows,,\nthat it would increafe in him in fuch a Meafure,\nthai: there \\Vould be no Poffibility of Amendment\nin him, and fcarcely in his Children, if he h\u00b7ad any ;\nfor the EYil of the Parent is tranfmitted to his Off-\nfpring ; but the Lord maketh Provifion that thi~\nmay not be the Cafe.\n282. The Lord could cure the Underftanding in\nevery Man, and fo caufe him to think not Evil, but\nGood, and this by Means of Yarious Fears, hy Mira-\ncles, by fpeaking with the Dead, and by Vifions and\nDreams; but to cure the Uncler!l:anding only, is\nbarely to cure Man outwardly ; for the Under.\nfii-nding with its Thought is the External of Lifa\nlJ;l\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENC!':. 4-21\nin Man, and the \u00b7will with its Affecrion is the In-\nternal of his Life, wherefore the Cure of the Un-\nderftanding alone wouhl be like a palliative Cure,\nwhereby the intct;ior Malignity is included, and\nprevented from making its Exit, fo that it con-\nfumes firfl: the neighbouring Parts and afterwards\nthe more remote, till the whole is mortified ; it is\nthe \\Vill itfelf which is to be cured, not by Influx\nof the Underfl:anding into it, becaufe that never\n-takes Place, but by Infl:ruEl:ion and Exhortation\nfrom the Underflanding. Jf the Underllanding\nc.lonc were cured, Man would become like a ciead\n:Body embalmed, or covered over with fragrant\nAromatics and Rofes, which in a fhort Time would\ncontraCt fuch a Stench from the Corpfe, that no\nl3ody could come near it ; fuch would be the Cafe\nwith celefl:ial Tmths in the Underfl:anding, if the\nevil Love of the Will were obfl:ruB:ed.\n283. The Reafon why Man is permitted to think\nEvils, even fo far aS\" to intend them, is, as was ob-\nferved, that they may be removed by Confiderations\nof a civil, moral, and fpiritual Nature: as is the Cafe\nwhen he thinks, that they arc contrary to Jufl:ice\nand Equity, contrary to Honefl:y and Decency,\nand contrary to Goodnefs and Truth, therefore\n\u20acontrary to the Tranquillity, Pleafure, and Hap-\npinefs of Life ; by thefe three Confiderations the\nLord healeth the Love of Man's \\Vi!! ; and indeed\nat firfl: by Fear, and afterwards by Love. Still\nl:owever Evils are not feparated and cafl: out from\nMa:1, but only removed and put away to the Sides,\nand when they are there, then they do not appear ;\nfor whatfoever is in the Middle, the fame is direcrly\nunder\n\f422 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nunder Infpeftion, and is feen and perceived : But it\nis to be attended to, that although Good be in the\n.l\\liddle, yet 1\\Ian is not for that Reafon in Good,\nuniefs the Evils \\vhich are at the Sides, tend down-\nwards and outwards ; if they look upv..\u00b7ards or in-\nwards, they are not removed, for they f!:iH endeav-\nour to return to the Middle : They tend and look\ndownwards or outwards, when Man fhuns his Evils\nas Sins, and flill more fo, \\vhen he hath an Averfion\nto them, for then he condemns and devotes them\nto Hell, and caufeth them to look. thitherward.\n284- The Underf!:anding of l\\1an is a Recipient\nas \u2022.veil of Good as of Evil, and as weU of Truth as\nof the Falfe, hut not the Will of Man ; this lafl:\nPrinciple rnufl: be either in Evil or in Good, it can-\nnot be in both, for the \\Viii is the Man himfelf, and\ntherein is his Life's Love: But Good and Evil in the\nU nderfi:anding are feparated, like Internal and Exter-\nnal; hence Man may be interiorly in Evil, and exteri-\norly in Good : Still however, when Man is reformed,\nGood and Evil are committed, and then there exifl:s\na ConfiiCl:, or Combat, which, ifit is grievous, is call-\ned Temptation, but if it is not grievous, is like the\nFermentation of Wine or Wort; in fuch Cafe ifGood\novercomes, Evil with its Falfe is removed to the Sides,\ncomparatively as the Lees fall to the Bottom of a\nVe!fel, and Good becometh like '\\Vine after Fermen-\ntation generous and fine; but ifEvil overcomes, then\nGood with its Truth is removed to the Sides, and it\nbecomes turbid and foul like unfermented VJine.\n\"\\Ve ufc this Comparifon of Fermentation, becaufe\nFerment in the \\VorJ fignifies the Falfe of Evil, as in\nHofea vii. 4\u00b7 Luke xii. 1 ; and in other Places.\nc[bat\n\fTHE DunNE PROVIDENCE. 423\nTlzat tlze Divine Providence is alihe op-\ncratiee with t\/ze lViched_ as with t!te\nGood.\n'\n285\u00b7 INevery Man, whether he be good or evil,\nthere are two Faculties, one of which con-\nfiitutes the Underflanding and the other the \\Viii ;\nthe Faculty which confl:itutes the Underfia~cling,\nconfifls in his being able to underfl:and and think,\nand thence is called Rationality ; and the Faculty\nwhich conftitutes the 'Will, confifls in his being\nable freely to do fo, viz. to think, and thence alia\nto fpeak and aCl:, provided it be not contrary to\nReafon or Rationality; for to aCl: freely, is to ate\nas often as he willeth, and according as he willeth.\nInafmuch as thefe two Faculties are perpetu::tl, and\ncontinual from Primaries to Ultimates in all and\nevery Particular, which a Man thinketh ~;!d beth,\nand there are not in Man from himfelf, but are iu\nbini from the Lord, it follows, that the Lord's Pref-\nence with and in there Faculties hath Place alfo in\neach Particular, yea in each mofi minute Particular\nof the Underflanding and Thought, as well as of\nthe \\Vill and AffeEl:ion of Man, and theqce in the\nmoll minute Particulars of his Speech and ACtions ;\nremove thefe Faculties from any the fmallefl: Partie-\n,ular, and you will not be able to think it or fpeak it\nas a :r\\1an.

Now\nforafmuch as thcfe Faculties in Man are from the\nLord, and not appropriated to Man as his own, for\nthe Divine (or that which is Divine) cannot be ap-\npropriated to Man as his own, but can be adjoined\nto him, and thereby appear as his ; and forafmuch\nas that Divine [Property] in Man exifls in the moft\nminute particulars appertaining to him, it follo\u00b7ws,\nthat the Lord governs Things the moll particular,\nas well in a wicked as in a good Man ; and it is the\nGovernment of the Lord which is called the Divine\nProvidence.\n286. Now fince it is a Law oF the Divine Provi\u00b7\ndencc, that Man fhould aB.: freely according to Rea-\nfo\u00b7n, that is, from thefe two Faculties, Liberty and\nRationality ; and it is ~tlfo a Law of the Divine\nProvidence, that that which he doeth, fhodd ap-\npear to .Man as from himfelf, and confequently as\nhis own ; arid it is moreover a Law, that Evils are\nto be permitted to the End that he may be led out\nof ihem, it follows, that Man may abufe thefe Fac\u2022\nultics, and from Liberty accordinb to Reafon con-\nfirm whatfoever he will, far he c:!n make whatfoever\nbe will a Perfuauon of his Reafon, whether ic b::!\nreafonable i!l itfelf or not ; wherefore feme fay,\n'What is Truth ?

It was fbewn above, that the Divin\\!\nProvidence is (or operates) in all the lcafl: Particu-\nlars of the Thoughts and Affe&ions of Men, by\nwhich it is meant, that Man can think and will\nNothing from himfelf, but tbt all that he thinketh\nand \\Yilleth; and thence fpeaketh ~nd docth, is by In-\nflux ; if it is Good, by Influx from He<t,~en, and if\n.Evil, by Influx from Hell ; or, what amounts to\nthe fame, that Good is by Influx from the Lord,\nand Evil from the Proprium of Man. But I know\nth<1t this is difficult to be comprehended, bccaufe a\nDi.fi:in&ion is made between that which ente;;rs by\n\"Influx from Heaven; or from the Lord, and that\nwhich enters by Influx from Hell, or from the Pro-\nprium of Man ; and yet it is faid that the Di,\u00b7inc\nProvidence is in all the leaft Particulars of the\nThoughts and Afie&ions of Man, infomuch that\nMan can think and will Nothing from himfelf; but\nbecaufe it is faid, that he can alfo think and \\viii\nfrom Hell, and from his P1:oprium, this appears like\na ContradiCtion, ncverthelefs it is not ; that it is\nnot a Contradiction, will be fcen, after fame Things\nare premifed, which will illdl:rate this Matter.\n288. All the Angels c.f Heaven confefs, that no\none can think from himfelf, but only from the\n.. LordJ\n\fT-nE DIVINE PRovrnE~cE. 427\nLore, but all the Spirits of Hell affirm that no one\ncan think from any other than himfelf ; though\nfometimes it hath been lhewn the latter, that not\ncne of them thinks from himfelf, nor\u00b7 can do it, but\nthat Thought is produced by Influx;\u00b7 in vain how-\never was this !hewn rhem, for they would not receive\nit. But Experience !hall ~each, fidl1 that the whole\nof Thought and AffeCtion, e\\\u00b7en in the.iRferr{ai Spi-\nrits, flows from Heaven, but that influent Good is\nthere turned into Evil, and influent Truth into\nFalfehood,- and fo every Thing into its Oppofite ;\nthis was proved by the following Experiment; there\nwas let down out of Heaven a certain Truth front\nthe \u00b7word, and the fame was received by thofe who\nwere in the fuperior Hells, and fent down from them\nto tbe inferior Hells, and fo on to the lowefi, and in\nits Pa!fage, it was fucceffi\\\u00b7ely turned into Falfehood~\nand at length into fuch Falfehood as was direftly\ncppofite to this Truth; and they, among whom it\nwas fo changed, thought what is falfe as from them-\nfelves, and \u00b7knew no otherwife, when neverthelefs\nwhat they thought was this Truth defcending from\nHeavin fo falfified and perverted in its \\Vay to the\nlowefl: Hell. I have heard that this was Jone three\nor fom Times : The Cafe is the fame with Good,\nwhich in its Defi;ent from Heaven is progreilively\nturned into Evil oppofitc to that Good. Thence it\nwas evident, that Truth and Good proceeding from\nthe Lord, when it is receh\u00b7ed by thofe who are in\nthe FaUe and in Evil, is changed, and paifeth in<\no\n:mother Form, infomuch that its firfi Form doth\nnot appear. And fo it is with every wicked Man,\nfor fuch acne a:; to his Spirit is in Hell.\n289. That\n\f4~S 1\\.NG!LlC \\VISDOM CONC.ElllHNG\n'\nZ~9\u00b7 That neither doth any one in Hell think,\nfrom himfelf, but from others about him, nor thofe\nothers from themfelves, but ftom other~ fl:ill, anc\\\nthat Thoughts and Afrt:Ctions make an orderly Pro..\ngreffion fron1 one Society to another, without any\none's knowing otherwife than that they are from\nhimfelf, hath often been fuewn me. Some, who\nfuppofed they thought and willed from themfelves,.\nwere fent into a Society, all Communication being\n~ut off with their Neighbours, to.whom alfo their\nThoughts ufed to extend themfelves, and were de..\ntained therein ; and then they were told to think oth..\nerwife than the Spirits of that Society tho'ught, and\nto force themfelves ~o think contrary to it, but they\nconfeifed that they found it ~mpoffible. This wa~\ndone with many, and likewife with Leibnitz, who'\nwas alfo convinced, that no one thinks from him..\nfelf, but from others, and that neither do thofe oth-\ners think from themfelves, but all by Influx from\nH eaven, and Heaven, by lnflux from the Lord,\nSome, when they meditated on this Matter, faid that\nh was aftonifhing, and that fcarce any one wo~ld be\nled to believe it, becaufe it is quite contrary to Ap~\np~arance, but that yet they could not deny it, be-\ncaufe it was fully proved ; neverthelefs, in their\n$tate of Admiration, they faid, that at _\nthis Rate\nthey are not in Fault, when they thin~ Evil; alfo,\nthat thus it feems as if Evil were from the Lord ;\nand moreover, that they did not comprehend, how\nthe Lord alone could c2ufe all to think fo diflerent-\nly. But thefe three Points fhall be explained in.\nwhat follows.\n\fTHE DIVINE PltOYIDENCE. 4:!9\n290. To the Experience already adduc~d, this\n;~.lfo !hall be added : \\Vhen it was given me by the\nLord to fpeak with Spirits nnJ Angels, this Arca-\nnum was immediately reveded to me ; for it was\ntold me out of Heaven, that I believed as others do,\nthat!-thought and wiiled from myfelf,when neverthc-\n!efs it is noi: from myfelf, but if good, that it is from ..\nthe Lord, and ifevil, that it is from Hell : That this\nwas the Cafe, \\vas alfo demonfl:rated to me in a lively\n.Manner by various Thoughts and11ffecrions induced,\nand it was given mefucceffively to perceive and feel it;\nwherefore afterwards, as foon as any Evil fiole into\nmy v~;nn, or any falfe Principle into my Thoughts, 1\ninquired whence ir came, and it was difcovered to me:~\nand moreover it was given to fpeak with Them, tore-\n.. buke them, and to drive them away that they might\nretire, and fo withdraw their evil and falfe Principle~\nand keep it to themfelves, apd no longer infufe any\nfuch Thing into my Thouglas : This hath been done\na thoufand Times; and in this State I have remained\nnow for many Years, and fiiil continue in it ; and yet\nI feem to myfelf to think and ,..,.ill from myfe!f like\nothers,- without any Difference ; for it is of the\nLord's Divine Providence that it {h~uld fo appear\nto every one, as was !hewn c.bove in its proper Ar-\nticle.

That all Good is from Heaven, and all\nEvil from Hell, is not unknown in the \u00b7world;\njt is known to every one in the Church ; who,\nthat is admitted to the Priefi:hood, doth not teach\nthat all Good is from God, and that Man cannot\ntake any Thing from himfelf, whi<.:h is not given\nhim from Heaven ; alfo that the Devil infufeth\nEvils into Men's Thoughts, and feduceth them,\nand exciteth them to do Evils ?. \\Nherefore a\nPrieil:, who thinks he preacheth from holy Zeal,\n.prayeth that the Holy Gho!1: would teach him,\nlead and in~uence his Thoughts and INords, and\nfome fay they perceive fenfibly that they are aB:ed\nupon, and when their Preachings are -commended,\nanfwet piouily, that they did not fpeak from them-\nfelves, but from God. \\Vherefore alfo, when they\nfee any one fpeak and act well, they fay he was led\nof God to do it ; and on the other Hand, when\nthey fee any one fpeak and act wickedly,. they fay\nbe was led to it by the Devil ; That this is \u00b7 the\nLanguage of the Church, is well known; but who\nbelieves in the Truth of it ?\nzg2. That all that a Man thinks and wills, and\ncon1'equently fays and does, flows from the only\nFountain of Life, and that Il:ill the only Fountain\nof Life, which is the Lord, is not the Caufe of\nMan's thinking Evil and Falfe, may be illufi:ratecl\nby the following Circumfi:ance in the natural\n\\Vorld : From its Sun there proceedeth Heat and\nLight, and thefe two flow into all the Subjects and\nObjeCl:s which we fee~ not only into good Subjects\n\u00b7 and\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 4Jl\nand beautiful ObjeCts, but alfo into evil SubjeCts\nand unbeautiful ObjeCts, and produce in them va-\nrious Etfetl:s : For they flow not only into Trees\nwhich bear good Fruit, but alfo into Trees which\nbear bad Fruit, yea even into the Fruits themfelves,\nand caufe th~m to vegetate ; in like l\\1~nner they\nflow into good Seed, and alfo into Tares ; likewife\ninto ufeful or wholefome Shrubs, and alfo into\nhurtful or poifonous Shrubs ; and yet it is the fame\nHeat and the fame Light, iil which there is not any\nCaufe of Evil, for that exifl:s in the recipient Sub-\njeCts and Objc;,cl:s. The Aftion of Heat in hatching\nEggs, in which there is an Owl, a Screech-Owl, or\nan Afp, is the fame as in hatching E~gs which con-\ntain a Dove, a beautiful Bird, or a Swan; fet both\nKinds ofEggs uader a Hen, and they will be hatch-\ned by her Heat, which in itfelf is harmlefs ; y;hat\nthen hath the Heat in common with thefe evil \u00b7and\nnoxious Things ? The Action of Heat,, when it\nflows into marJhy Grounds, ficrcora~eous, putrid,\nand cadaverous Subfiances, is the fame as when it\nflows into vinous, fragrant, vegetating, and living\nSubfl:ances ; who but mull: fee, that the Caufc\ndoth not exill: in the Heat, but in the recipient Sub4\njett? Moreover, the fame Light produces in one \u2022\nObjeCt beautiful, .and in another difagreeable Col~\noars ; yea, it brighteneth itfelf in white Objects\nand fhineth, and becomes opaque in ObjeCts verg-\ning towards black, and darkencth itfelf. It is the:\nfame in the fpiritual Vforld, there alfo there is\nHeat and Light from the Sun thereof, which is the\nLord ; this Heat and Light flow from Him into\ntheir SubjeCt~ ;md ObjeCts; the SulJjeets and Ob-\njects\n\f432 ANGELIC \\VtsDOM CONCtRNtNO\njeas there are Angels and Spirits, fpecifically th~\n\"fhings appertaining to their voluntary and in..\ntdlectual Faculties ; the Heat there is the proceed..\niz!g Divine Love, and the Light there is the pro\u2022\nceeding Divine \\Vifdom ; the Caufe 'vhy they are\nreceived differently by one and by another, doth\nnot exi!l: in the Heat and Light ; for the Lord\nf<titT1, \" That he maketh his Sun to rife on the\nEvii and on the Good~ and fendeth Rain on the\nJuft and on the Unjufl:,\" Matt. v. 45; by Sun, in ..\nthe fupreme fpiritual 3enfe, is meant the Divine:\nLove, and by Rain the Divine \\VifJom.\n293\u00b7 To this I will add a Sentiment of the An\u00b7\ngels [Ai1gelica Sententia] concerning vVill and In.-\ntelligcllce in Man ; their Sentiment is this, that\nthere doth not exift in any 1\\Ian one Grain of \\Viii\nor PruJ~nce that is proper to himtelf; for they fay,\nif there exilled one Grain in any M~n; neither.\nHeaven nor Hell could hold together, and the whole\nhuman Race would perifh; the \"Reafon, they fi1y,\nis, becaufc Myriads of Myriads of Men, as man)'\nas have been born fince the Creation of the \\Vorld;\nconftitute Heaven and Hell, which al\"e fo fubordi\u00b7\nnate one to another; th::lt on each Part they make\none, Heaven one beautiful Man, and Hell one\n1\\'lan-Monfter ; and if any lingle Perfon had a fin..\n\u00b7 gle Grain of Will and Intelligence of his own,\nthis One could not poffihly exifl:, but would be di[.\ntraB:ed, and with it th:lt IJivi:J.e Form would pcrifh ;\nwhich can no othenvife conf:fl: and be permanent~\nthan \\Vhen the Lord is All in All, and they alto\u2022\ngether Nothing.

I:eep this in Remembrance, and\nif you defire, it will be confirmed to you by the\nAngels, when you enter into the fpiritual \\\\:orld af.\nter Death.\n294\u00b7 It was obfervcd above, n. 289, that when\nfome were convinced that no one thinks fi-om him-\nfelf, but from others, and that all thofe others think,\nnot from themfelves, but by Influx through Heaven\nfrom the Lord, they faid in Admir(!tion, that as\nthis is the Cafe, they are not blameable when they\ndo Evil; alfo, that as this is the e1fc, i~ fccms that\nEvil is from the Lord; and lik.ewife that they did\nnot .comprehend, that the Lord alone could caufc\nall to think fo diverfely. Now inafmuch as thefe\nthree Suggeftions cannot but flow into the Thoughts\nof thofe who only think of E~ecis from EffeCts, and\nnot of EffeCts from Caufe~, it is neceifary that they\nfhould be aifumed, and explained from their Cauf-\nes. FIRST : That as this is the Cafe, it 'would not be\ntbeir Fault, if they did E'l-\u00b7il: For if all that a Man\nthinks fiows from others, it feems as if the Fault\nwere in thofe from whom it flows; neverthelefs the\nFault is in him who receives, for he receiv.:::s it JS\nhis own, nor doth he know any othen\u00b7:ife, neither\ndoth he with to know any otherwifc ; for every one\nddires to be his own, and to be guided by himfet'f,\nand efpecially to think and will for himf::lf; for this\ni~ Liberty i~lclf, which appears as proper to 1\\lan,\nor a~ the Proprinm in which eYcry J.\\1an is; wtere.\nG o g\u00b7 f..)fe\n\f434 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNING\nfore if he knew, that whatfoever he thinketh and\nwilleth, flows from another, he would feem to him-\nfelf to be in C\"!~ptivity and in Chains, and no longer\nMafl:er of himfelf, and fo all the Delight of his\nLife would perifh, and at leP-gth his Humanity itfclf.\nThat this is the Cafe, I have frequently feen prov~\ned ; it was given certain Spirits to percci~\u00b7e and feel\nthat they '\"ere led by others, and then their Anger\n'vas kindled to fuch a Degree, that they became as\nit were befide themfelves, and faid, that they would\nrather be kept in Chains in Hell, than not to be al-\nlov,;ed to think as they will, and will as they think :\nNot to be allowed to do this, they called being\nch::1ined \"\u00b7ith Refpect to their very Lives, which\nwas harder and more intolerable than being chain-\ned with Refpeft to their Bodies ; not to be allowed\nto fpeak and aa as they thought and willed, this\nthey did not call being chained, becaufc the Delight\nof civil and moral Life, which conflfis in fpeaking\nand ac:tiug, rcfl:rains, and at the fame Time as it\nwere alleviates the Refhaint. No\\v forafmuch as\nMan doth not defire to know, that he is led to think\nby others, but is defirous to think from himfelf,\nand alfo believes that he does it, it follows that the\nFault is in himfelf, neither can he free himfelffrom it,\nfo long as he continues to think \\vhat he docs think;\nbut if he does not love it, he diffoh'es his Conncxion\n\\Yith thole from whom his Thought flows; this is\nthe Cafe when he knows that it is Evil, and therefore\ndcfire5 to !hun it, and defiil: from it; then alfo he\nis taken away ofthe Lord from the Society, wl1ich\nis in that Evil, and tran!1ated to a Society in \\\\ hich\nth;~t Evil dc,es not exill:; but if he knows the Evil,\nU..'1\\l\n\fTnE DIVINE PRovrD:cNcr. 435\nanc.l cloth not fhnn it, then the Fault is imputed to\nhim, and he becomes guilty of that Evil. There-\nfore whatfocver a Man thinks he does from himfelf,\nthe fame is faid to be done from the Man, and not\nfrom the Lord. SrcoNDLY: 'Tbat as tbi.r is the\nCafe, itJmns tbat E\u00b7r:il i.r from tbe Lord: This may\nbe thought to be a Conclufion deducible from what\n\u00b7 as lhewn above, u. 288, which is, that influent\nGood from the Lord is turned into Evil, and Truth\ninto what is Falfe, in Hell: But who cannot fee,\nthat Evil and the falie Principle are not from.\nGoodnefs and Truth, confequently not from the\nLord, but from the recipient SubjeCt and Objefr,\nwhich is in Evil, and in the falfe Principle, and per-\nverts and inverts Goodnefs and Truth, as was alfo\nfully fhewn aboYe, n. 292?

How the Divine Providence operates\nwith the Good, may be more eafily comprehended,\nthan hvw it operates with the Evil; and forafmuch\n.:s the latter Operation is now treated of, it fhall be\nfet forth in the following Series. I. That there\nme Things innumerable in every Evil. 2. That\nthe wicked Man from himfelf plungeth himfelf con-\ntinually more and more deeply into his Evils. 3\u00b7\nThat the Divine Providence with the \u00b7wicked is a\ncontinual Permift!on of Evil, to the End that there\nmay be a continual AbduCtion the:\u00b7efrom, or that\nthey may be continually drawn out of it. 4\u00b7 That\nAbduEtion or Deliverance from Evil is efli:Etcd of\nthe Lord by athoufand moil fecret Means.\n296. In Order then that the Natote of the Di-\n;,1.nc Providence in its Ope!J.tion \\vith the \\Nicked\nLmy\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 437\nmay be difl:inctly perceived, and fo comprehended,\nthe abo\u00a5e Propofitions fldl be explained in the Or-\nder in \u2022vhich they arc adduced: FIRST: 'IZwt there\nare 'Things innumerable in every Evil: Every Evil ap-\npears to Man as one fimple Thing, this is the Cafe\nwith Hatred and Revenge, alfo with Theft and\nFraud, Adultery and Whoredom, Pride and High-\nmindedncfs, and with every other Evil; and it is\nnot known that in every Evil there are Things in-\nnumerable, exceeding in Number tl:c Fibres and\nVeiTels in a l\\'lan's Body ; for a wicked Man is a\n\u00b7 Hell in its leaf!:. Form, and Hell confifl:s of Myriads\nof Myriads, and every one there is in a hum;:.n Form\nalthough it be a monfl:rous one, and all :he Fibres\nand all the Vefiels in it are inverted; the Spirit it-\nfelf is Evil, appearing to itfelf as one; but innume-\nrable as the Things are that :1rc in it, io innumera-\nble are the Concnpifcences of its Evil; for every\nMan is his own Eril or his own Good from the\nCrown of his Head to the Sole of his Foot : Since\nthen a wicked Man is {uch, it is eYident that he is\none Evil, compofed of various innumerable ones,\nv-:hich are difiinaly ETils, and are called Concup1-\nfcences of Evil. Hence it follows, that all thefe in\ntheir Order arc to be repaired and converted of the\nLord, to the End that Man may be reformed, and\nthat this cannot be eflefted but by the DiYine Pro,\u2022-\nidence, fucceffively from the earliefl: Period of Man's\nLife to its Termination. Ewry Concupifcence of\nEvil appears in Hell, when it is reprefented, like\nfomc noxious .Animal ; as for Example, either like\na Dragon, or a Bafilifk, or a Viper, or an Owl, or a.\nScreech-Owl, and fo forth ; in the fame Manner do\nth~\n\f.4-38 ANGELIC \\VlSDOU CONCERNING\nI\nthe Concupifcences of Evil appear about a wicked\nMan, wJlen he is viewed by the Angels ; all thefe\n}~orms of Concupifcences are to be changed feverat-\nly ; the Man himfelf, who with Refpetl: to his\nSpirit appears as a Monfl:er or a Devil, is to be con-\nverted that he may become like a beautiful Angel,\nand each Concupifcence of Evil is to be converted\nor changed, that it may appear like a Lamb or a\nSheep, or like a Pigeon, and a Turtle Dove, as the\ngood AffeCtions of the Angels appear in Heaven,\nwhen they are re.prefented ; and the Conver!ion of\na Dragun into a Lamb, of a Ba!ilifk into a Sheep,\nand of an Owl into a Dove, cannot be effecred ex-\nc;ept progreDively, by rooting out Evil from its\nSeed, and fowing good Seed in the Place of it.\nBut this mufl: be done co~nparati\\\u00b7ely like the in-\ngrafting of Trees, the Roots of wliich with fome\nof the Trunk remain ; nevcrthelefs the ingrafted\nBranch converts the Juices extracred from the old\nRoot into Juices producing good Fruit : The\nBranch which is to be ino~ularw:d cannot be ta:>.en\nfrom any other but from the Lord, who is the Tree\nof Life ; which is alfo acconJing to the \\llord of\nthe Lord, John xv. I to 7\u00b7 S:iCONDLY: Tbat the\n'lvicl:cd lvlan froiJl hi77!fi:[f crmtinually plungeth bin!felf\nmore deeply into bis Evils : It is faid, from himlelf~\nbecaufe all Evil is from Man, for he converteth the\nGood which is from the Lord .into Evil, as was faid\nabove. The true Reafon why- the wicked Man\nplungeth himfelf more deeply into Evil, is, becaufe\nhe iatroduceth himfelf more and more interiorly,\n:and alfo more and more deeply, into infcrn~1l So.\ncieties, as he will~th and doeth Evil ; thence alfo\n\u2022 the\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 439\nthe Delight of Evil increafcth, and fo occupies his\nThoughts, that at laft he feels nothing more pleaf~\n<~nt ; and he who hath introduced himfelf more\nintcriotly and profoundly into infernal Societies,\nbecometh like one bound in Chains ; but fo long\nas l:e li\\Tth in the \\Vorld, he doth not feel his\nCh:1ins, for :hey are like foft \\Yool, or fine filken\nThreads, which he loves becaufe they are pleafure-\nable; but after 'Di!ath thofe Chains fro m foft be-\ncome hard, and infl:ead of being pleafureable, they\nare galling. That the Delight of Evil is capable of\nIncreafe, is well known from Thefts, Robberies,\nRevenges, Depredations, Tyrannies, Defire of Lu-\ncre, and other Evils ; \\Vho doth not feel Elevations\nof the Delight of thefe Evils, in Proportion to his\nSuccefs and unrefrrained PraCtice thereof ? It is\nwell k..'lown, that the Thief feels fuch Delight in\nThefts, that he cannot defifr from them, and, what\nis wonderful, that he loves one H:olen Piece of\nMoney better than ten that are given him : It would\nbe the fame with Adulteries, if it were not provid-\ned, that the Power of committing that Evil de-\ncreafes according to the Abufe of it ; but yet with\nmany there remaineth a Delight in thinking and\nfpeaking of it, and if Nothing more, a Lufl: of\ntouching. But it i:; not known what is the Reafon\nof this Increafe of Delight, and that it is a Confc-\nquence of the Perfon's introducing himfelf ir.to\ninfernal Societies more and more interiorly, and\nmore and more deeply, as he commits Evils in \\Viii,\nand at the fame Time in ThoLJght ; if they are on-\nly in Thought, and not in \\Viii, he is not yet with\nEvil in an infernal Society, but he then CI)ters wh'en\nthey .\n\f4-<tO AxGELIC vVISDOM CON'CERNING\nthey are alfo in the \\Vill ; if in this Cafe he thinks\naHo that fuch Evil is contrary to the Precepts of\nthe Decalogue, and confid~rs thefe Precepts as\nDivine, he then commits it intentionally, and there-\nby plunges himfelf into Hell more deeply, whence\nhe cannot be drawri. out but by acrual Repentance.\nIt is to be obfcrvecl, that every Man, with Refpect\nto his Spirit, is in the fpiritual vVorld in fome So-\nciety there, the wicked Man in iome infernal So-\nciety, and the good Man in fome celef1:ial Society;\nhe a!f<J appears there fometimes when he is in deep\n[alta] Meditation. Moreover, as Sound together\nwith Speech dilfufes itfelf in the Air in the natural\nWorld, fo Joth Aflccrion together with Thought\nclil.fufe itfelf among Soci,eties in the fpiritual \\Vorld ;\nthere is alfo a\u00b7 Correfpondence between ~hem, for\nAffeGion correfponds to Sound, and Thought to\nSpeech. TmRDLY : 'Fbat the Divine Pro\u00b7vidence\nwi:h the T\niVicked is a, continual Permf!Jion of Evil, io\nthe End that they may be continually drawn out of it.\nThe Reafon why .the Divine Providence with wick~ .\ncd Men is continual Permiilion, is, becaufe Nothing\nbut Evil c:m proceed out of their Life; for .Man,\nwhether he be in Good, or in Evil, CJ:lnot be ia\nboth at\u00b7 once, ne\u00b7ither alternately, except he be\nlukewarm ; and Evil of Life is not introduced\ninto the Will, and thrc:.Jr;h it into the Thought,\nby the Lord, but it is introduced by IVhn, and this\nis called Permit1ion.

The Reafon why the Angel:; of Heaven arc\nAfFetl:ions of Good and thence Thoughts of Truth,\nis, becaufe they are Recipients of Divine Love and\nDivine Wifdom from the Lord, and all Affetl:ions\nof Good are from Divine Love, and all Thoughts\nof Truth are from Divine \\Vifdom : But the Rea-\nfan why the Spirits of Hell are Concupifcences of\nEvil and thence Imaginations of the Falfe, is, be-\ncaufe they arc in the Love of Self and in felf-derived\nIntelligence, and all Concupifcences ofEvil are from\nthe Love of Self, and Imaginations of the Falfe are\nfrom felf-derived Intelligence.\n302. The Ordination or Arrangement of Affec,.\n-tions in Heaven, and of Concupifcences in Hell, is\nwonderful, and known only to the Lord ; they are\non both Sides difringuifhed into Genera and Spe-\ncies, and fo conjoined or connetl:ed as to atl: as one;\nand forafmuch as they are difringui!hed into Genera\nand Species, they are t!ifringuifhed into greater or\nleffer Societies ; and forafmuch as they are conjoin-\ned that they may aB: as one, they are conjoined like\nall the Things that arc in a l\\Ian ; hence Heaven in\nits Form is like a beautiful Man, whofe Soul is the\nDivine Love and the Divine Wifdom, therefore the\nLord ; and Hell in its Form is like a Monfrer,\nwhofe Soul is Self-Love and felf-derived Intelli-\ngence, therefore the De\\'il ; for ~here is not any\nparticuhr\n\ff54 ANGELIC WrsDOM CONCERNING\n.. . . ~\nparticular De,,iJ, who is fole Lord there, but Self-:\nLove is fo called.\n' 303. But that the Nature of Heaven and Hel\\\nmay be frill better unde_rfrood, infread of the Affec::\n~ions of Good take the Delights of Go~d, and in-:\n!lead of the Concupifcences of Evil take the Dew\nlights of Evil, for there doth ~ot ~::cift any AffeB:iod\nor Concupifcence without its Delights, inafmuch as\nDelight~ confritute the Life of every one ; . thefe\nDelights are qiflingui~ed and conneB:ed, as was\n[aid above of the AffeB:ions of Good an~ the Conw\ncupi!'cences of Evil : The :pelight of his AffeB:ion\nfills and encompaifes every Angel of Heaven ; and\nmoreover their common Delight fills and encom-\npaffes eve~y Society of Heaven; and the Delight of\nall together, o~ that which is moft general, fills and\nencompaifcs the univerfal Heaven : In like Manner;\nthe Delight of his Co11:cupifceuce 'fill5 and encom-:\npaifes every Spirit of Hell ; and its common Dew\nlight every Society of Hell ; and the Delight of all,\nor that which is general, the Whole of Hell. lnaf~\nmuch as the AffeCI:icn5 of Heaven, f111d the Concu:\npifcences of Hell~ are, as was obferved above, dia-:\nmetrically oppofite to each o~her, it is evident that\nthe Delight of Heaven is to undelightful or difa-\ngreeable in Hell, that they cannot fupport it, and\nor!. the other Hand, that the Delight of ~ell is fo\nundelightful or difagreeable in Heaven, that neither\ncan they fupport it ; hence proceeds their mutual\nAntipathy, Averfion, and Separation. .\n}04\u00b7 Thefe Delights, inafmuch as they confritute_\nthe Life of each Individual in particular, and of the.\n~~mmn:nity in general, are lDt felt by thofc \\vhq\narc\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 45$\n~re in them, but their Oppofites are felt when they\napproach, efpecially when they are turned into\nSmells, for every Delight correfponds to fame Smell,\nand in the fpiritual World may be turned into it ;\nand then the Delight of Heaven in general is felt\nlike the Smell of a Garden, with fome Variety ac.:.\nc'ording to the F.ragrancies arifing therein from\nFlowers and Fruits ; and the Delight of Hell iri\ngeneral is felt like fiagnant \u00b7water, into which have\nbeen cafi divers Kinds of Filth, with fame Variety\naccording to the Stench of Things putrid and offen-\nfive therein. Tn what Manner the Delight of each\ntJarticular Affection of Good in Heaven~ and of each\nparticular Concupifcence of Evil in Hell, is felt~\nhath been g~ven to know, but it \\vould be prolix\nto explain it here.\n305. I have heard many New-Comers from the\n\\Vorld complain, th~t they did.not kno\\\u2022, that their\nLot ~ould be according to the AffeCtions of their \u2022\nLove ; faying, that in the \\Y\"orld they did not think\nof them, much lefs of the Delights thereof, becaufe\nthey loved that which was delightful to them; and.\nthat they only thought, that the Lot of every one\nwould be according to his Thought grounded in In-\ntelligence, efpeciaily according to Thoughts ground-\ned in Piety, and likewife in Faith: But it. was given\nthem for Anfwer, that they might have known, if\nthey would, that a Life of Evil is difagreeable to\nHeaven and difpleafing to God, and that it is plea~\nfing to Hell and delightful to the Devil ; and on\nthe other Hand, that Good of Life is grateful to\nHeaven and pleafing to God, and unpleafar.t t<>\nBell anti difagreeable to the Devil, and iherefore\nthat\n\f-156 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNINq\nthat E\\'il in itfelf is offc:nfive, and Good is fragrant;\nAnd fince they might have known this if they\nwould, why did not they !hun Evils as infernal and\ndiabolical, and why did they favour Evils merely\nbecaufe they were delightful ? And fince they now\nknow that the Delights of Evil have an offenfive\nSmell, they might alfo know that fuch in whom\nthey abound cannot enter into Heaven. After this\nAnfwer, they betook themfelves to thofe who were-\nin fimilar Delights, for there, and no where elfe,\ncould they. breathe.\n3o6. From the Idea which has now been given\nof Heaven and Hell, it may appear what the Nature\nof the Mind of Man is, (for, as hath been faid, the\nMind or Spirit of Man is a Heaven or a Hell in its\nleafr Form,) namely, that his Interiors are mere\nAffeftions and Thoughts derived therefrom, divided\ninto Genera and Species, like greater and Ieifer Soci-\neties, and fo connefted as to ad: as one ; and that\nthe Lord rules thofe Affeftions and Thoughts, in\nlike Manner as he rules Heaven or Hell. That\nMan is either a Heaven or a Hell in its leafi: Form,\nmay be feen in the Work concerning HEAVEN\nAND HELL, publifhed in London, Anno I 7sS,\nn. 51 to 87.\n307. Now to the Point in ~efl:ion, that the\nLord governs Hell by Oppofites, and that the Wick-\ned, who are in the \\Vorld, are governeJ by Him in\nHell, as to Interiors, but' not as to Exteriors. As to\nwhat relates, F1RST, To the Lord's go'Verning Hell\nby Opprjites; it is fhewn above, n. 288, z8g, that\nthe Angels of Heaven are not in Love and Virifdom,\nor in the .:'\\ifeEtion of Good and thence in the\nThought\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 457\nThought of Truth from themfelves, but from the\nLord ; and that Good and Truth flow from HeaY~\nen into Hell; and that thct'efore Good is turned into\nEvil, and Truth into what is Falfe, by Reafon that\nthe Interiors of their Minds are turned in~ contrary\nDirettion: Now fince all Things in Hell are oppo~\nfite to all Things in Heaven, it follows, that the\nLord governs Hell by Oppofites. SEcoNDLY: T'bat\nthe Wicked, wbo are jn tbe World, are governt'd in\nlief\/ by tbe Lard j the Reafori is, becaufe Man with\nRefpeCl: to his Spirit is in ,the fpirirual \\:Vorld, and\nthere in forne Society, in an infernal Society if he is\nwicked, and in a cclefiial Society if good ; for the,\n1\\'lind ofMan, whichin itfelfis fpiritual, cannot be any\nwhere but among Spirits, into \\Yhofe Society it comes\nalfo after Death ; that this is the Cafe, hath alfo been\nfaid and ihewn above. But Man is not there Uke one\nof the Spirits who is infcribed into the Society, for\nMan ts contir.ually in a State of Reformation, where~\u00ad\nfore according to his Life and the Changes thereof, he\nis tranflateJ ty- the Lord from one Society of Hell\nto another, if he is wicked ; but if he fuffers him~\nfelf to be reformed, he is led out of Hell and i_ntro~\nduced \"into Heaven, and there alfo he is tranflated\nfrom one Society to another, and this until the\n'fime of his Death, after which he is no longer\ncarried from one Society to another, becaufe he is\nthen no longer in any State of Reformation, but\nremains in that in which he is according to his\nI.ife ; wherefore when a Man dies, he is infcribed\nin his own Place.

Hence\nit may appear that Prudence, which is not fclf-de.\nrived, is Prudence from the Lord, f!milar as to its\nA[1pearance in Externals to felf-derived Prudence,\nbut totally different in Internals ; in Internals Pru-\nc~ence which is not felf-derived appears in the fpir-\nitual vVorld like a Man or Being truly human,\nbut felf.derived Prudei1ce like an Image appearing\nto ban} Life from this Circurnfl:ance only, that they\nwho are in ir, have Hill Rationality and Liberty, or\na faculty of unuerflanding and \\villing, and thence\nof foeakiM\u00b7 and aCt:inrr ,\u00b7 and that by' .f\\\u00b7Icans of thefe\nJ. u ()\n\"Fa:ulties they alfo can fimulate human Beings, or\nfeign themfclves Men : The Reafon why they are\nfuch Images, is, becaufe Evils and FalCes are not\nali\u00b7\u2022e, but only Goods and Truths, and forafmuch\nas they know this by Means of their.

It i3 the\nfame \\vith the other Senfes; hence it is evident\nwhat natural Truth and Good are : Confider now\nwhat fpiritual Truth and Good are ; is fpiritual\nTruth any Thing elfe but d1e Beauty and Harmo~\nny of fpiritual 'I hings and Objects ? and is fpiritual\nGood any Thing elfc but the Delight and Pleaf-\nure arifing from a Perception of their Beauty or\nHarmony? Let us now fee, whether ally Thing\ncan be aiferted of the one which is not true of the\nother' or of what is n~ttural which is not true of\n\\1 h<:.t\n\fTrn\u00b7 Dn'INE -PROVIDENCE. 469\nwhat is fpiritu:J.l; of \\~hat is natural it is faid, that\nwhat is beautiful and delightful to the Eye flows\nfrom external ObjcCls, and what is harmonious anJ\nfweet to the Ear flows from bfl:ruments ; b \u00b7.vhat\nRefpeCl: is the Cafe difrerent with the org:mic Sub-\nfiances of the Mind? It is faid of the latter, that\nthofe Things (Yi.z;.

To\nth~s-\n\f470 ANG~LIC '\\VISDOM: CONCERNING\nthis I \\Yili add a Fact l~nown by Experience, and\nwhich is common in the fpiritual \\Vorld ; one\nSpirit can infufe his Thoughts and Affeaions into\nanother Spirit, withot~t the other's knowing; but\ntlut the fame is of his own Thought and Affet:\\:ion;\nthis is called in that World thinking from another,\nand thinking in another; I have feen this done a thou.\nfa!ld Times, ::md have alfo done it an hundred Times\nmyfelf; and yet the Appearance ofDifi:ance w2s con-\nfiderable; but as foon as they knew that it was anothe~\nwho infufed thofe Thoughts and AffeB:ions, they \\Yerc\nangry, and turned themfelres away, acl:no\u00b7.vledging\nneverthelefs that Diftance doth not appear in the\ninternal Sight or Thonght, unlefs it be difcovered,\nas it doth in the external Sight or Eye, and that\nhence it is, that it is thought to enter into the latter\nby Influx. To this Faa I can. add my own daily\nExperience; evil Spirits have often injetl:ed Evils\na~d Falfes into my Thoughts, which appeared to\nme as if they were in myfclf, and from myfelf, or\n~s if I thought them myfelf; but fcrafm!JCh as l\nknew that they \\Vere Evils and Falfcs, I endeavour-\ned to find out who injecred them, and they were\ndeteCted and driven away, and they were at a con-\nfiderable DiH:ance from me. ,Hence it may appear .\nthat all Evil with its falfc Principle flows from Hell,\nand that all Good with its Truth flows from the\nLord, and tha.t they boLh appear as if they were in\nrv1an.\n313.

That if Man u\u2022;uld belie\u00b7ve, u:bich is the\nTruth, that every Thing good and true is from' th(!\nLord, and c\u00b7vcry Thing evil and fa!fe isfrom Hell, he\nwould neither appropriate Good to hin!fl!f, and make it\nmeritorious, nor \u00b7would he appropriate to bin!fe!f Evil,\nand make bin!fe!fguilty ofit. Eut forafmuch as thefc\nThings are contrary to the Belief of thofe, who\nhave confirmed in themfelves the Appearance, that\n'\\Vifdom and Prudence are from Man, and do not\nflow in according to the State of the Mind's Organ-\nization, treated of above, n. 3 1g, therefore they\nfhall be demonfhated ; and that it may be done\ndifl:ina!y, the following drder !hall be obferved. I.\nThat he who.confirms in himfelf the Appearance,\nthat \\ Vif<,l.om and Prud~nce are from Man anJ\nthence\n\\\n\fTHE DJVINE PROVIDENCE. 485\nthence in him as his own, cannot fee otherwifc, than\nthat if this were not the Cafe,..he would. not be\nMan, but either a Beall or a Statue ; when never-\nthelefs the contrary is true. 2. That to believe and\nthink, what is the Truth, that every Thing good and\ntrue is from the Lord, and that every Thing evil\nand falfe is from Hell, appears to b;:: impoffible,\nwhen neverthelefs it is truly human and thence an-\ngelic. 3\u00b7 That fo to believe and think is irnpoilible\nto thofr, who do not acknowledge the Lord's Divin-\nity, and who do not acknowledge Evils to be Sins;\nbut that it is poffible to thofe, who acknowledge\nthofe two Things. 4\u00b7 That they who are in the\nAcknowledgment of thefe t;vo Things, only refle[t\nupon Evils in themfelves, and cafl: them out from\nthemfelves, into Hell from \u00b7whence they come, .in\nProportion as they fhun and hold them in Averfion\nas Sins. 5\u00b7 That thus the Divine Providence nei-\nther appropriates Evil nor Good to any one, but\nthat felf-derlvecl Prudence appropriate:> both.\n32 r. But thefe A\u00b7rticles {hall be explained in the\nOrder propofed. FIRST: 'rbat be wbo co!!f\ninils in\nbin!ft!J tbe Appcarmzre, that TVifdom and Prudence are\nfrom Alan, and thence in him as his own, cannot fee\notberwifi, than that if this 1.oere not the Cafe, be\n\u00b7would not be a k!an, but eitber a Bci'fll or a Statui!;\nwhen nev::rtbdefs the contrary is true. It is a Law of\nthe Divine Providence, that Man lliould think as\nfrom himfelf, and that he fhould aCl prudently as\nf~\u00b7om himfelf, but yet fhould acknowled~;e that he\ndoeth fo from the Lord ;' ilcuce it follows, that he\nwho thinks and ach prudently as from himldf, and\nat the fame Time acknowledges that he coe~ lo\nfrom\n\f~86 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCER:r-.~ING\nfrom the Lord, the fame is a Man, but not he who\nconfirms in himfelf ;:m Idea, that all that he think>\nand does is from himfelf; nor he, \\vho, becaufe\nhe knoweth that \\Vifdom and Prudence are from ,\nGod, waits for Influx ; for the latter becomes like\na Statue., and the former like a Beall.: That he who\nwaits for Ir:flux is like a Statue, is evident ; for he\nmull. fl.:and or fit motionlefs, with his Hands hang-\ning down, and his Eyes either fhut or wide open\nwithout l\\1otion, neither thinking nor breathing ;\nand what Life in fuch Cafe is there in him ? That\nl1c who believes that all he thinks and does, is from\nhimfdf, is not unlike a Reafl.:, may al:o be evident ;\nfor he thinks only from the nat\\}ral Mind, which\nMan hath in common with Beafl.:s, and not from the\nrational fpiritual Mind, which is the Mind truly\nhuman ; for this latter Mind acknowledges, that\nGod only thinks from himfelf, and that Man thinks\nfrom God ; \\vherefore alfo Men of that Defcription\n[who think onlyfrom the natural Mind] kiww noDif-\nference between .Man and Beafr; except that a l\\Ian\nfj)eaks and a Beall. utters Sounds, and imagine that\nthey both die alike. Of thofe who wait for Influx,\nit may be expedient to obferve further, that they do\nnot receive any Influx, except a fey'; who from their\nHearts dcfire it ; thefe fomctimes receive forne\nAnfwer by lively Perception in Thought, or by t::tcit\nSpeech therein, and rarely by any manifcfl.: Speech,\nand rhea it is to this Effec:t, that they may think\nand aCt as they will or as they can, and that he \u00b7who\naCts wilely i;;; a wife Man, and he who ac:ts foolifhly\nis a Fool ; and they are never inflrufred what they\nought to believe and what they ought to do; and\nthis\n\fTI-IE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 487\nthis to the End that hum:m Rationality and Liber-\nty may not be defhoycd, which confifi:s in every\none's acting from Free-Will according to Rcafon,\nto <~II Appearance .:s from himfclf. They \\vho alL:\ninfiructed by Influx \\\\hat they ought to believe and\nto Jo, are not infhucb:d by the Lord, nor by any\nAngd of Hc<!vcn, but by fome Spirit of an Enthu-\nfidl:, ~taker, or l\\lora\\'ian, and are feduced. All\nInflux from the Lord !s efretl:ed by Illumination cf\nthe Underfl:anding, and by the Affection of Truth,\nand by the Influx of the latter into the former.\nSECONDLY: 'Tbat to belie'\u2022\u2022e and think 'i-ubat is tbe\n'Frutb, that e\u00b7vcry 'Tbing gcad and true is fiom the\nLord, and tbat cvc1y Tbing C'vi! and j'l!ft is from\nIlc\/1, appears to l\u2022\ne impq_\/jiNe; when ncvcrthclcjs it h\ntruly human and thence angelic. To belieYe and think\nthat eyery Thing go0d and true is from God, ap-\npears po11ible, provided Nothing further be faid;\nthe Reafon is, becaufe it is conformable to theologi-\ncal Faith, again!l which it is not allowable to think;\nbut to believe and think that every Thing evil\nand falfe is from Hell, appears impoilible, becaufe\nin this Cafe it would al!\"o be l:;elicved, that Man\ncould think Nothing; neverthelcfs Man thinks as\nfrom himfe!f, although from Ilell, becaufe it is the\nGift of the Lord to eYery one, . that Thought,\nwhencef:)ever, it comes, may appear in him as his\nO\\'JH, othcrwife Man would not li\\'e as Man, neither\ncould he be brought out of Hell, and introduced\ninto H c:1vcn, th:lt is to fay, reformed, as is abun-\ndantly fhewn ~~a\u00b7te : \\Vherefore alfo the Lord giv-\neth Man to know, and th~nce to think, that he is in\nHdl if he is in Evil, and that he thinks from Hell\nif\n\f488 ANGELIC \\VlSDOl\\1 CONCERNING\nif he thinks from Evil; and moreover he (\"iveth\n0\nhim to think of the Means whereby he may efcapo.\nout of Hell, anJ not think from thence, but enter\ninto Heaven and there think from the Lord; and\nhe lil;:ewife giveth Man Freedom of EleCtion ; 'from\nv:hich Confideratior.s it may be feen, that l\\1an can\nthink what is Evil and Falfe as from himfelf, and\ncan alfo think that the one and the other is Evil\nand Falfe; confequently that it is only an Appear-\nance that it is from himfelf, without which .t\\ppear-\nance :Man would not be IV1an. The effential hu-\nman Principle and thence the angelic confifts in\nthinkirtg from the Truth, and this is the Truth,\nthat Man doth not think from himfelf, but that it\nis given him by the Lord to think, in all Appear-\nance as fco:n himfelf. \u00b7 THIRDLY: Thatfo to belic'\"vc\nand think--is impqffible to tbqfe, who do not aclmowledge\ntl\u00b7e Lord's Di'Vinity, and wbo do not aclmo-:.dcdge\n\u00a3.-viis to be Sins ; and that it is pqjfible to tbtfe 7.vbo\nacknowledge tbc\/e i'lco Things. The Reafon why it\nis impofiiblc to thofe who do not ack!lowledge the\nLord's Divininty, is, bccaufe the Lord only givelh\nMan to think and will, and they who do not ac~\nknowledge the Lord's DiYbity, being- fepatated\nfrom him, imagine that they thi:1k from themfelves ;\nThe Reafon why it is alfo impoffible to thofc who\ndo not acknowledge that EYils are Sins, is, becaufe\nthey thin.k from Hell, md every one there fuppofcs\nthat he thinks from himfclf. But that it is poGible\nto th0r~ who acknowledge the Lord's Divinity, and\nthat EviL:; are Sins, m:ty appear from what hath\nbeen abundantly adduced above, n. 288 to 2()4\u00b7\nli'ouRTHL Y: 'lbat they ~cb() are in tbe Acknowledg-\nment\n\fI\nTi-I:E Dxvd~~ PRovii>ENCE. 489\n;nent of thoft two Things, only rejlea upon Evils in\n1henifelves, and cqfl them out into Hell from whence\ntbey come, in Proportion as they jbun ~nd hold tbenz\nin Aveifzon as Sins. \\Vho doth not or may not\nknow, that Evil is from Hell; and that Good is\nfrom Heaven? Arid who may not thence know,\nthat in Proportion as Man {hunneth and holdeth\nEvil in Averfion, in the fame Proportion he fhun;.\n,\n1\nheth and holdeth Hell in AveHion? And who may\nnot thence knovr, that in Proportion as any one\nfhunneth and holdeth Evil in Averfion, in the fame\nProportion he willeth and loveth Good, therefore\nthat in the fame Propmtion he is brought out of\nHell by the Lord, and led to Heaven ? Thefe Things\nevery rational Man may fee plainly, provided he\nknows that there ~s a Heaven and a Hell, and that\nEvil and Good have each their feparate Origin ;\nnow if Man refleCl:s upon E'\u00b7ils in himfelf, which. is\nthe fanie thi~ as to examine himfdf, and lhunneth\nthem; then he difengageth himfelf from Hell, and\n' tafl:eth it behind him, and introduceth himfelf into\nHeaven, and there feeth the Lord Face to Face;\nit is faid that Man doeth this, but he only docth it\nfeeri1ingly from himfelf, and therefore from the\nLord. When Man acknowledgeth this Trttth from\na good Heart and pious Faith, then it lieth in-\nwardly concealed in e\\\u00b7ery Thing that he thinketh\nand doeth afterwards as frot:l himfelf, like the pro-\nlific [~'ality] in Seed, which internally accompa-\nnies it even until the ProduCl:ion of new Seed ; and\nlike the Pleafure of Appetite for that Food which\na Man hath once found to be_falutary; in a \\Vord,\nit is like the Heart and Soul in every Thing\u00b7 that he\n'0 o o thinketh\n\f490 ANGELIC vVrsDOM c6NCI:R1-HNC\nthinl:eth and doeth. FrFTHI.Y: 'That thus the Divine\nPro'Z.'idencc neitber approtriatcs E'z:il nor Good to cmy\none, but that Ji.:!fdt'rived Prudence afpropriates both:\nThis follows as a Confequence of all that hath been\nfaid : The End of the Divine Providence is Good;\nthis therefore .\\t intendeth in every Opera\u2022ion ;\nwherefore it doth not appropriate Good to any one,\n{or thereby fuch Good wou}d become meritorious;\nneicher doth it appropriate Evil to any one, for\nthereby it would make him guilty of Evil: Never-\nthelefs Man doeth both from his Prop;ium, becaufe\nthat is Nothing but Evil ; the Proprium of his\n\u00b7will is Sdf-Love, and the Proprium of his Un-..\nderfl:anding is the Pride of !elf-derived Intelligence1\nand from the htter proceeds fdf.derived Prudence.\nThat every lHan may be riformed, and\nthat there is .nojuch Thing as Predef\ntination..\n322. S\u00b7OUND Reafoil diftates that AH are pre~\ndefl:ined to Heaven, and none -to Hell;\nfor all are born Men, and thence the Image of God\nis in them ; the Image of God in tnem confifl:s in\ntheir being able to uhderfl:antl Truth, and to do\nGood; to be abl~ to\u00b7 under.!l:and Truth is from the\nDivine Wifdom, and to be able to do Good is from\nthe Divine Love; this Power is the Image of God~\nw\u00b7h:ch abideth in a Man of found lVJind, and is not\neradi\u00b7:ated ; hence it is, that he can be made .a civil\nand\n\fTnn DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 49l\nand moral Man, and he who is a civil and moral\nl\\lan, the fam~ can alfo be made fpiritual, for what\nis civil and moral is the Receptacle of whz.t is fpirit-\npal ; he is called a civil Man, who k11oweth the\nl.aws of his .Kingdom whereof he is a Citizen, and\nliveth according ro them ; and he is called a mora~\nMan, who mal;:.eth thofe Law!i his Morals, and his\nVirtues, and liv~th conform;tbly to them from Rea-\nfon. I \\vill now tell you how civil and moral Life\nis a Receptade of fpiritual Life; live according\nto thofe L11.ws not only c()nfidered as ciril and\nmoral Laws, but alfo as Divine La,vs, and you will\n'be a fpiritual Man. Th~re fcarcely ~xifls a Nation\nfo barbarous, as not to have g~ven the SanB:ion of\nits Laws to the Prohibition again!l: committing\nMurder, corrppting the Wife of aP.other, i1:ealing2\nfalfe Teftimony, and the \\'iolation of whatever be-.\nlongs to another; thefe Laws the civil and mora\\\nMan obferves, in Order tha,t he may be, or feem to\nbe, a good Citizen ; but if he doth not at the fame\nTime confid.er thefe Laws as Divine~ he is oniy a.\n<;ivil and moral natural Man, wherc::ts if he confiders\nt.hem as Divine, h~ becomes a civil ~md 1.nor::ll fpirit-\nual Man; the Difference is, th{lt the latter is not\nonly a good Citizen of an earthly Kingdom, but\nalfo a good Citizen of the heavenly Kingdom,\nwhereas. the f.ormer is a good Citizen of an earthly\n}\\ingdom, but not of the heavenly Kingdom : The\nGoods which tllt)\" do, diftinguifh them ; the Goods\n\\!lhich ci\\\u00b7il and mor:ll r.:::tural Men do, are not\nyoods in themfelvt:;,, for the Man ~,.nd the \u00b7worid\n~~ in them; 'vbereas the Good;;, which civil and\nworal fpiritual Mea do, are in thec1iclves Goods,_\nbecaufe\n\f49~ ANGELIC \\VlSDOM CONC'!RNIN~\nbecaufe the Lord and Heaven is in them. Hence it iS:\n~vident that every Man, fince he is born fuch that he\ncan be made :;\\ civil and moral nat~ral Man, is alfo\nporn fuch as that he can be made a civil and mora~\nfpiritual Man; it ~s only acknov.-ledging God,~nd not\ndoingEvils bec~pfe theyare in Oppofition to God,but\ndoing Good becaufe it is in Favour of God ; hereby.\nSpirit entqcth intoMan's civiland moral At'tions, and\n1hey receive ~if~; but without it, th~re is no Spiri~\nin them,. a~d therefore they have nq Life; where~\nfore the natural Man, however civilly and morally\nl-le may aCt, ~s called dead, but the fpiritual Man iS;\n~alled alive~ lt is of the Divine Providence of the\nLord, that every Nation hath fame Religion, and;\nthe Foundation of all Re1igion is an Acknm,\ndedg'!.\n~nent that ther.: is a God, for otherwife it is not\n~alled a Religion; and every Nation, which li\\res,\naccording to its.

Inafmu~h as from thefe Confiderario'ns it\nmay alfo be feep that rhe Divine Providence is no\nother Predefl:ination than to Heaven, and that neither\ncan it be changed into any other, it is here to be\ndemonfl:rated, that the End of Creation is a Heaven\nout of the human Race, in the Order propofed..\nFIRST: '!'hat every ]}Jan is created to. liw to Etcr-:\nzzity. In the Treatife concerning THE DIVINE\nLovE AND THE DIVINE vVrsnoM, P.art the Thircl\nand Fifth, it is fhewn, that in Man there are three\nDegrees o_\nf Life, which are called natural, fpiritual,\n~nd ccleftial, and that thefe Degrees are aCtually in\nevery one ; and tha~ in Beafts there is only one\npegree of Life, which is fimilar to the ultimate\nDegree in Man, called Natural; from which it fol-:\n)ows, that 1\\'lan, by the Elevation of his Life to the\nLord, is capable (which Beafts :J.re not) of being.\nbrought into fuch a State, ~s to be able to under-\n:fl:and fuch Things as are of the Divine vVifdom,.\n~nd to will fuch Things as are of the Divine Love,\n~onfequently to receive the Divine [Influx,] and he\nwho can receive the Divine [Influx,] io as to fee\nand perceive it in himfelf, cannot be otherwife than\nconjoined with the Lord, and from that Conjunc-\ntion cannot but live to Eternity. What would the\nI.ord be with all his Creation of the Univerfe, if he\nhad not alfo created Images and Likeneifes of him-\nfelf, to whom he might communicate his Divine\n[Influence ?] In any other Cafe, would it not be\nlike making Something to be, and not to be, or tQ\nexift, and not to exifl:, and this for no other Pur-.\npofc,\n\fTn:r:: DIVINE PROVIDENCE.\npofe, but that he might contemplate at a Difb.ncc\na mere Shifling of Scenes, and continual Variations\nas upon a.

And forafmuch as the\nDivine [Being] is a Being of incxhaufl:ible Glo~y,\n\\vould he keep it to himfelf; or indeed could he ?\nFor Love wifheth to communicate its own to anoth~\ner,, yea; to give as mnch of its own as it can; what\nthen mufl: the Divine Love do1 which is infinite ?\nCan fuch Love give, and then take away again ?'\n\\Vould not this be to give what is to perilh; which\nin itfelf is not any Thing internally1 becaufe when\nit perifheth it becometh Nothing, there not being\nin it that which Is ; but he giveth what Is, or what\ndoth not ceafe to be; and that is eternal. In Order\nthat every Man may live to Eternity, what is mortal\nabout him is taken away, viz. his material Body;\nwhich is taken away by Death ; thus his immorta-l\nPart, which is his Mind, is \u00a3tripped n~ked, and\u00b7then\nhe becometh a Spirit in a human Form, his Mind\nbeing that Spirit.

Now.\nforafm.uch as there is a Belief among Chrifiians, if\nnot ampng all, yet among many, that the Church\nis common~ which alfo is called a Communion,\nit follows~ that there are fome very common or\ngeneral [Eifentials} of the Church, which are\nIngredients in all Religions, and confl:itute that\nCommunion : That thefe mofi: common or gencrat\n[Eifentials] are the Acknowledgment of a God, and\nGood,of Life,. will be feen in the following Order.\nI. That the Acknowledgment of a God caufeth a\nConjunCtion of God with Man, and of Man with\nGod, and that the Negation of a God caufcth <l:\nDisjunCtion. 2. That ev~ry ~me ack.nowledgeth,\nGod, and is joined unto him, according to the Good:\nof his Life. 3~ That the Good of Life, or to live\nwell, is to iliun Evils becaufe they are contrary to.\n\u00b7. ~el~gion, therefore againft_ Go.d. 4:\u00b7.

Some may think, that they\ncan alike be faved who\"do not :!cknowledge a God,\nas they who do, provided they lead a moral Life;\nfaying, what does Acknowledgment lignify? Doe~\nit not confift i~ Thought only ? Cannot I eafily ac..,\nknowledge, when I know for certain, that there is a\nGod? I have heard of Him, but I never faw Him ;\nJet me fee Him, and I will believe. Such is the\nLanguage of many who deny God, \\vhen it is\npermitted them to reafon freely with one who ac-\nknowledgeth God. But that the Acknowledgment\n()[a God conjoins, and the Denial of a God fepa-\n:rates, ihall be illuftrated by fome Particulars known\nto me in the fpiritu;JJ World: In that \u00b7world, when\nany one tbinb ofanother, and defires to fpeak with\nhim, the other immediately is prefent; this. is com~\nmon in the fpiritual World, and never fails; the\nR:eafon is, becaufe in the fpiritual World there is no\nDifl:ance, as in the natural \\Vorld, but only an Ap-\npearance of Difrance. Another Particular is, that as\nThought f~om fome Knowledge of another caufeth\nhis Prefence, fo Love from fame AffeCtion for an..\nother caufeth ConjunCtion with him, whereby it\n~ames to pafs that they go together and converfe in\na friendly Manner, and dwell in one Haufe, or in\none Society, and often meet, and do mutual good\nQffices to each other : The Reverf~ alfo takes Place,\nm\n\f502.

From thefe Particulars it may appear, what is\nthe Caufe of Prefence, and what the Caufe of Con-\njunCtion in the fpiritual World, namely,that Prefence\nproceeds from Remembrance of another with a De-\nfire to fee him, and that ConjunB:ion.proceeds from\nthe AffeCtion which is\u00b7 of Love. It is the fame,\nwith all Things which are in the human Mind;\u00b7\ntherein are Things innumerable, and all the Partic-\nulars there are confociated or conjoined according\nto Affetl:ions, or as one l;'hing\u00b7 loves another.\nThis Conjunt.l:ion is fpiritual Conjuntl:ion, which is\nlike itfelf both in Things common, and in Things\nparticular : This fpiritual Conjuntl:ion delive~ irs.Ori-\u00b7\ngin from the Conjunaion of the Lord with the ipir. \u2022\nitual. \\:Vorld, and the natural \\Vorld, in common\n...and in particular; from which Confideration it is\nevident, that in Proportion as any one.acknowledg.\neth the Lord, and thinketh of him from Knowledg\u00b7\nes, in the fame Proportion the Lord is prefent; and\nin Proportion as any one acknowledgeth him from\nthe AffeClion of Love, in the fame Proportion the\nI.ord is conjoined with him; and on the contrary,\nthat in Proporticm as any one doth not acknowledge\nthe Lord, in the fame Proportion the Lord is ab...-\u00b7\nfent, and that in Proportion as any one denieth him,\nin the fame Proportion he is di~oined or feparated\nfrom him. ConjunClion caufeth the Lord to turn\nthe\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 503\nFace of Man to hinifclf, and then ~o lead him ; and\nDisjunaion caufeth Hell to turn the Face of Man\nto itfelf, and to lead him : \\Vherefore all the An-\ngels of Hea\\\u00b7en .turn their Faces to the Lord as the\nSun, and all the Spirits of Hell turn away their Faces\nfrom the Lord. Hence it is evident what is the Ef-\nfeCt produced by the .Acknowledgment of a God,\nand what by the Denial of a God. And they wh \u2022\ndeny God in the \\~Forld, deny him after Death, and\nbecome organized according to the Defcription\nabove, n. 319 ;. and the Organization induced in\nthe \\Vorld remains to Eternity.

III. 'That it is a Afan~s c.wn Fault, if he is\nnotjmJed. This Truth is acknowledged by every\nrational Man as foon as it is beard, viz. that Evil\ncannot flow from Good, nor Oood ftom Evil, be-\ncaufe they are Oppofites ; confequently, that from\nG ood Nothing but Good can flow, and from Evil\nNothing bu~ Evil: \u00b7when this Truth is acknowl-\nedged, the following is acknowledged alfo, viz. that\nGood can be turned into Evil, not by a good but\nby an evil Recipient, for eycry Form turneth what\nis influent into its own ~ality, fee above, n. 292.\nNow forafmuch as the Lord is Good in its very\nEffence, or Good itfelf, it is evident that Evil can..\nJ?.Ot flow from the Lord, nor be produced by him,\nbut that it can be turned into Evil by a Recipient\nSubjeCt, whofe Form is a Form of Evil: Such a\nSubjeCt is Man with Refpeft to his Proprium ; this\ncontinually receives Good from the Lord, and con.\ntinually turns it into the ~ality of its Form, which\nis a Form of Evil : Hence it follows, that it is a\nMan's O\\~n Fault if he is not faved. E\\:il is indeed\nfrom Hell, but forafmuch as he receives it thence\nas his own, and thereby appropriates it to himfelf,\ntherefore it makes no Difference whether you fay\nthat Evil is from Man, or that Evil is from Hel1,\nJ3ut whence there is an Appropriation of Evil in\nfuch a Degree that Religion perifheth, fhall be\nfhewn in the following Series. I. That every Re-:\n~igion in ~ro~efs ofTime decreafeth and is confum..\n\u00b7\u00b7 mated.\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. S09\nmated. 2. That Every Religion decreafeth and is\nconfummated by an Invcrfion of the Image of God\nin Man. 3\u00b7 That this exif!:s from continual Incre..\nments of hereditary Evil in fuccefiiYe Generations.\n4\u00b7 That !1:ill it is provided by the Lord, that every\none may be capable of being faved. 5\u00b7 That it is\nalfo provided, that a new Church may fucceed in\nplace of the Former vafl:ated Church.\n328. But thefe Propofitions are to be demonfira-\nted in their Series. FIRST : That'every Religion in\nPrccefi of 'Time decr-eaflth and is corifummated. Up-\no~l this Earth there have been feveral Churches,\none after another, inafmuch as wherefoever the hu-\nman Race exifl:s, there a Church exifl:s ; for Heav-\nen, which is the End of Creation, confif!:s of the\nhuman Race, as was demonflrated above, and no\none can enter into Heaven, unlefs he be in the two\nUniverfals of the Church, which confifis in acknowl-\nedging a God, and leading a good Life, as is \u00a3hewn\nabove, n. 326 ; hence it follows, that upon this\nEarth there have been Churches from the mofl: an-\ndent Times down to the prefent. Thefe Churches\nare defcribed in the Word, but not hifl::orically, ex-\ncept only the Ifraelitifh and Jewifh Church, before\nwkich neverthelefs there exifl:ed feveral, and thefe\nare only defcrib~d in the vVord under the Names\nof Nations and Perfons, and certain Particulars con-\nce,rning them. The mofl: ancient Church, which\nwas the Firft, is defcribed by Adam and his vVife\nEve. The \u00b7fucceeding Church, which is to be call-\ned the Ancient Church, is defcribed by Noah and\nhis three Sons, and by their Po:f!:erity ; this was ex-\n\\enfive and fpread oyer many Kingdoms of Afia,\nwhich\n\f510 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING\nwhich were the Land of Canaan on both Sides Jor.\ndan, Syria, Affyria, and Chald~a, Mefopotomia, E.\ngypt, Arabia, Tyre, and Siqon; among thefe was\n.the ancient 'Word, mentioned in THE DocTRINE oF\nTHE NEW jERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED\nScRIPTURE, n. Iol, 102, 103. That that Church\nexifted in thefe Kingdoms, is evident from various\nParticulars which are recorded concerning them in\nthe prophetic Parts of the \\fi.Tord. But that Chu.rch\nwas remarkably\u00b7changed by Eber, from whom the\nHebrew Church had its Origin; in the latter facri-\nficial Worfhip was firfl: infl:ituted. From the Hebrew\nChurch fprung the Ifraelitifh and Je,vilh Church,\nefl:ablifhed with much Solemnity for the Sake of the_\n\\Vord, which was there to be written. Thefe four\nChurches are meant by the Image feen by Nebu-\nchadnezzar in a Dream, whofe Head was of pure\nGold, the Breaft and Arms of Silver, the Belly and\nThighs of Brafs, and the Legs and Feet of Iron and\nClay, Dan. ii. 32, 33\u00b7 Neither is any Thing elfe\nmeant by the golden, filver, copper, and iron Ages\nmentioned by ancient \\Vriters. That the Chrifl:ian\nChurch fucceeded the Jewiih Church, is well known;\nand it may be feen from the 'Vord, that all thefe\nChurches in Procefs of Time declined, till there \\vas\nan End of them, which is called the Confumma-\ntion. The Confummation of th.e moll ancient\nChurch) which was occafioned by eating of the Tree\nof Knowledge, whereby is fignified the Pride of felf-\nderived Intelligence, is defcribed by the Deluge.\nThe Confummation of the Ancient Church is de-\nfcribed by various Devafl:ations of the Nations treat-\ned of, as \\Veil in the hifl:orical, as in the prophetic\nParts\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 5 I I\nParts ofthe Word, efpecially by the cafl:ing out ofthe\nNations from the L;md of Canaan by the Children\nof Ifrael. The Confummation of the Ifraelitifh and\nJewiili Church is underfl:ood by the Defl:ruelion of\nthe Temple at Jerufalem, and by the carrying away\nof the Ifraelitin1 People into perpetual Captivity, and\nof the Jewilh Nation to Babylon; and lafUy by the\nfecond Deflrutl:ion of the Temple, and at the fame\nTime of Jerufalem, and the\u00b7 Dilperfion of that Na-\ntion; which Confummation is foretold in many\nPlaces in the P~ophet-s, and in Daniel, Chap. ix. 24\nto 27. But the fucceffive Vafl:ation of the Chrif-\n~ian Church to its final Period, is defcribed by the\nLord in Matthew, Chap. xxiv. in Mark, Chap. xiii.\nand in\u00b7 Luke, Chap. xxi ; and the Confummation\nitfelf in the Apocalypfe. Hence it may appear,\nthat the Church in P.rocefs of Time decreafeth and\nis confummated ; and that it is the fame with Reli-\ngion. SECONDLY: That every Religion decreafetb\nand is confummated by an lnvet}ion ofthe Image ofGod\nin ll.fan. It is well known that Man was created in\nthe Image of God according to the Likenefs of God,\nGenefis i. 26 ; but it fhall be explained what an Im-\nage of God is, and what a Likenefs of God: God\nalone is Love and Wifdom ; Man was created that\nhe might be a Receptacle of both; that his '\\Vill\nmight be a Receptacle of Divine Love, and his Un-\nderfl:anding a Receptacle of Divine Wifdom. That\n1hefe two Principles from Creation are in l\\1an, and\nthat they make the Man, and that they are alfo form-\ned in every onein the vVomb, was !hewn above; Man\ntherefore is an Image of God, in that he is a Recipi-\nent ofDivine \\Vifdom, and a Li.kenefs ofGod, in that\nheisa Recipient of Divne Love.; whereforethe Recep-\ntacle\n\fSI2 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CO!TCER.lUNG\ntacle which is called the Undcrfl:anding, is an Im~\nage of God, and the Receptacle which i$ called\nthe \\Vill, is a Likenefs of God ; therefore fincc\nMan was created and formed to be a Receptacle, it\nfollows, that he was created and formed, that his\n\u00b7will might receive Love from God, and his Under.\nfranding \\Vifdom from God; which alfo Man re.\nceiveth, when he acknowledgeth God, and liveth ac~\ncording to his Commandments~ but in a greater or\nleifer Degree, in Proportion as by Religion he know.\neth God, and knoweth his Commandments ; confe\u2022\nquently in Proportion as he knoweth Truths; for\nTruths teach what God is, and how he is to be ac.o\nknowledged; as alfo what his Commandments are;\nand how \u00a5an is to live according to them. The\nImage of God; and the Likenefs of God, are not ac.\ntually defl:royed in Man, but they are feemingly de.\nfiroyed ; for they remain inherent in his two Facul..;\nties, which are called Liberty and Rationality, which\nhave been abundantly treated of above : They be.s\ncame feemingly dellroyed, when Man made the Re:.\nceptacle of the Divine Love, which is his \\Viii, a\nReceptacle of Self.Love, and the Receptacle of the\nDivine Wifdom, which is his Underfl:anding, a Re-\nceptacle of felf-derived Intelligence; thereby he in.\nverted the Image and Likenefs of God, for he turned\nthofe Receptacles away from God, and turned them\nto himfelf: Hence it is, that they are clofed above,\nand. opened below, or that they are clofed before,\nand opened behind, when neverthelefs by Creation\nthey were open before, and clofed behind ; and\nwhen they are thus inverfely opened. and clofed,\nthen the Receptacle of Love or the 'Vill receives\nInflux\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 5 IJ\n7\nJnflux fr\u00b7om Hell, or from its Proprium, and fo\ndoes the Receptacle of vVifdom alfo, or the Under-\nHanding. Hence the \\Vorfhip of Men al'ofe in the\nChurches, infl:ead ofthe \\Vorfhip ofGod, and Wor-\nfhip grounded in DoB:rines of what is falfe, inftead\nof \\Vor!hip grounded in DoB:rines of Truth, the lat-\nter from [elf-derived Intelligence, the fClrmer from\nSelf-Love~ From thcfe Conficlerations it is evi-\ndent., that Religion in Frocefs of Time decreafeth\nan'd is confummated by an Invcrfion of the Image\nof God in l\\1an. THIRDLY: 'That this c.\"(ifls from\ncontinual Incrcmcn~s of hereditary Evil in fucajji'\/.,\u00b7c\nGcncrationr. That hereditary Evil is not from\nAdam and his Wife Eve, in Confequence of their\neating of the Tree of Knowledge, but-that it is fuc-\nceffively derived from Parents, and t-ranfplanted in-\nt.o their Offspring, and fo by continual Increments\nis augmented from Generation to Generation,.was\nfaid and fhewn above. \\Vhen Evil is thereby ac-\ncumulated among many, then it fprcads and ex-\ntends itfelf to others; for in all Evil there is a Lufi:\nof feducing, which in fome is ardent by Reafon of\ntheir Rage againft what is good, and thence proceeds\nthe Contagion of Evil; when this has invaded the\nDignitaries, Rulers, and leading Men in the Church,\nReligion is perverted, and the Means of Cure, which\nare Truths, are corrupted by Falfifications ; hence\nproceed in. fuch Cafe the fucceffive Vafl:ations of\nGood, and Defolation of Truth in the Church, un..\ntil the Conft.immaticn is complete. FouRTHJ.Y :\nT hat n<\n''u:rthclcfs it is provided by tbc Lord, that C7.\u2022e-\nry one may be capable ofbeing Javed. It is provi9ed\n~y the Lord that there fhould be a Religion every\nR R. r where,\n\f514 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCETI.NI~G\n.;vhere, and that in every Religion there fhould be\nthe two E11emials of Salvation, which confi!l: in ac-\nknowledging a God, and in not doing Evil becaufe\n!t is o.gain!l: GnJ; other Things appertaining to the\nUndcrfl:ancling, and thence to the Thought, which\nare called l.Vbtters o(Faith, :u-e proYided for every\none according to his Life, for they are Acceifories\nto Life; and if they precede, frill they do not re-\nceive Life before. It is alfo provided, that all who\nhave lived \\Yell, and acknowledged a God, fhould be\ninlhuCl:ed after Death by the Angels, and then they\nwho had been in thcfe t'vo Elfentials of Religion in\nthis \u00b7world, accept the 'Truths of tbe Church, fuch\nas they are in the Vvortl, and acknowledge the\n\u2022 Lord as:the God of Heaven and the Church ; and\nthis :Doctrine they receive more rea\u00b7dily than thofe\nChriflians, who have carried out of the World with\nthem an Idea of the Lord's Hum:mity feparate fram\nhis Divinity. It is moreover provided by the Lord,\nthat all who die in\u00b7 their Infancy, whcrefoever they\nmay be born, {hould be faveJ. There is alfo giYen\nto every Man after Death an Opportunity ofamend-\ning his Life, if poilible; all are inflrucred and led of\nthe Lord by Angels, and forafmuch as they then\nknow that they are living after Death, and'that there\nare fuch Places as Heaven and Hell, at firH: they re-\ncei\\'C Truth~\u00b7; but they who have not acknmdedg-\ned a God, and fhunned Eviis as Sim in this World,\n111 a lhort Time after are difguftcd with Truths, and\nrecede; and they who have acknowledged them\nwith their Mouths, aJ1d not in their Hearts, are\u00b7 like\nthe foolifh Virgins, whith harl Lamps, but no Oil,\nand fotl[>;ht Oil of others, and moreover \\vent and\nbought\n\fI\nTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 5 lj\nbought it, and yet were not admitted to the l\\lar-\nrbge: Lamps f1gnii~\u00b7 Tniths of Faith, and Oil fig-\nni11cs Good of Charity. Hence it may appear,\nthat by a Law of the Divi11e Providence every one\nis capable of being J:nnl, .and that it is a Man's own\nF'auit if he is not faved. FIFTHLY: 'That it is affo\nprovided that a New Churcb jbouldJucreed in Place of\ntbe former \u00b7vaflatcd Ch.urcb. This hath been the\nCafe from the moft ancient Times, viz. that when\na former Church was vafl:ated, a new oae fucceeded;\nafter the molt ancient Church the Ancient Church\nfuccccdcd; after the .Aucient Church .the lfraclitifh\nor Jewiih Church; after that the Chrifl:ia1i Church;\nmoreover that after this laft a New Chm1ch will\nfucceed, is foretold in the Apocalypfe, which Church\nis there meant by the New Jerufalcm defccnding\nfrom Heaven. The Reafoa whv a New Church is\nprovided by the Lord to fucceed 'the former vafbtcd\nChurch, may be feen in THE DocTRINE OF THE\nNEW jERUSALEM CONCERNI~G TI-lE SACRED\nScRIPTURE, n. 104 to rr3.\n329. IV. 'That tbus all are predtjlil?ed to Heaven,\nand none to Hell. That the Lord. cafl:eth none into\nIIell, but that the Spirit ca!ls himfclf thither, is\nfhewn in the \\iVork concerning HE\"\\7r:N ,\\ND liEu,,\npubliil1ed in London, AmiO I 7sS, n. 5-i\u00b7S to sso :\nThis is the Cafe with every wicked and impious\nperfon after Death ; it is the fame wi~h the \\Vickcd\nand Impi01:s in this \\Vvrld, with this Difltnnce,\nthat in this World they may be reformed, r~nd em-\nbrace :111d imbibe the Means of Salvarion, but noue\nafter their Departure out of the WorlJ.

Perfon cnn du\nthe one without doing the other at the fame\nTime : Thefe two Things are joined together like\nthe two Tables of the Decalogue; \u2022whereof one is\nfor the Lord, and the other for Man ; the Lord\nfrom his Table illuminates every one, and giveth\nPower, but in Proportion as. Man daeth the Things\nwhich are in his own Table, in the fame Proportion\nhe rcceiveth Po\\ver and Illumination ; before thi~\nthe tw; appear as if th~y were laid upon one another\nand fealed up, but as Man doeth the.

Thefe Particulars are mentioned in Order\nthat it may be known, that there is not war.ting to\nany Man a Knowledge of the Means whe!\"eby he\nmay be faveJ, nor the Power of being faved if he\nwill ; from which it follows, that all are predcfiined\nor intended for Heaven, and none for Hell. But\nforafmuch as there prevails among fome a Belief in\n\u00b7 Predeftination to no Salvation, which is Predefiina-\ntion to Damnation, and fuch a Belief is hurtful,\nand cannot be difpelled, unlefs Reafon alfo fees the\nMadnefs and Cruelty of it, therefore it fhall be treat-\ned of in the following Series. I. That any other\nPredefiination, than Predefiination to Heaven, is\ncontra,ry to the Divine Love and its Infinity. n\nThat any other Prcdefiination, than Predefi.ination\nto He.aven, is contrary to the Divine Wifdom and\nits Infinity. 3\u00b7 That it is an infanc Herefy, to iup-\npofe that they only are faved 'who are born \\vithin\nthe Churcb. 4\u00b7 That it is a cruel Herefy, to fup-\npofe that :my of the human Race are predellined tO\nbe damned.\n330. But that it may appear ho\u00b7.v hurtful a Faith\nin Predeflination is, as it is commonly undcrfi:ood,\nt~1cfc four Propofitions !hall be refumed and con-\nfirmed. FIRST: 'That any other Predcjlination, than\nJ!r.edejlillllfiort. to Hcawn, is contrary to the Divin:;\nL-'J~\u00b7e,\n\f518 AN:GELIC \\Vrsno.M coNcERNING\n- Love, bhich is iJ!finite. That Jehovah or the Lord\nis Divine Love, and that that Divine Love is infinite,\nand the Ejft of all Life ; and alfo that Man was cre-\nated in the Image of God according to the Likenefs\nof God, is demonflrated in the Trcatife concerning\nTHE DiviNE LovE AND TI-fE DIVINE \\:VrsDoM :\nAnd forafmuch as every Man is formed in the\n\\Vomb in that Image according to that Likenefs by\nthe Lord, as is alfo demonfl:rated, it follows, that\nthe Lord is the heavenly Father of all Men, and\nthat Men are his fpiritual Children ; fo alfo is Jeho-\nvah or the Lord called in the \"'\\llord, and fo are\nMen called therein ; wherefore he faith, \" Call no\nMan your Father upon the Earth, for one is your\nFather which is in Heaven,\" Matt. xxiii. 9 ; where-\nby it is meant that He alone is the Father with Ref-\npea to Life, and that an earthly Father is only a\nFather with RefpeCl: to the Covering of Life, which\nis the Body, wherefore in Heaven no other Father\nis made Mention of but the Lord: That Men are\nc\"alled his Sons, and faid to be born of him, who\ndo not invert that Life, is alfo evident from many\nPaifages in the \\Vord. Hence it may appear, that\nthe Di\\'ine Love is, in every Man, as well the Wick-\ned as the Good, confequently that the Lord, who\nis Divine Love, cannot aCl: any otherwife with them~\nthan as a Father upon Earth does with his Children,\nonly with infinitely more Tendernefs, becaufe the\nDivine Love is infinite ; alfo that he cannot rc:cede \u00b7\nfrom any one, becaufe the Life of every one is from\nHim : It appears as if he .recedeu from the \\Vicked,\nwhereas it is the Wicked themfclvcs who recede,\nbut flill he leadeth them out of Love : vVherefore\nthe Lord faith, \" Aik, and it fhall be given you ;\nfeek,\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. .)19\nfcck, and ye fl1all find ; knock, am!. it fhall be open.\neel unto you : \\Vhat Man is there of you, whom\nif his Son afk Bread, will he give him a Stone ? If .\nye then, being evil, know how to give good Gifts\nunto your Children, how much more fhall your\nFather which is in Heaven give good Things to\nthem that afk him ?\" Matt. vii. 7 to 1 1 : And in\nanother Place, \" That he maketh his Sun to rife on\nthe Evii and on the Good, and fendeth Rain on\nt ls.e Juft and on the Unjult,\" Matt. v. 45\u00b7 More-\nover it is known in the Church, that the Lord de\u00b7\nfireth the Salvation of ail, and not the Death of any.\nHence it may be feen, that any other Predefl:ination\nthan Predcfl:ination to Heaven is contrary to the\n_Divine Lm\u00b7e. SECONDLY : 'That any other Predif-\ntination, tha!z Predijlination to Hea\u00b7vcn, is contrary ta\n\u00b7tbe Di\u00b7vine W!filom, which is h!finitc. The Divine\nLove through its Divine \"Tifdom provides Means,\nwhereby every Man may be faved ; therefore to fay\nthat there is any other Predefl:ination than Predefl:i-\nnation to Heaven, is to fay that it cannot provide\nMeans, whereby Salvation may be cffeCl:ed, when\nneverthelefs all \u00b7are po.fftfled of the Means, as was\nfhewn above, and thef~ arc from .the Divine Provi-\ndence, which is infinite. But the\u00b7 Reafon why\nthere are' feme who are not f:lVed; is, bccaufe the\nDivine Love c.lcfires that Man fhould fed in himfclf\nthe Felicity and Blifs of Ilea\\'en, for othcrwifc it\nwoulll be ho Heaven to him ; and this cannot be\nefreae,l, unlefs it appears to Man that he tl1inketh \u00b7\nand willeth from himfelf, for without lhat Appear-\nance Nothing wou!J be appropriated to l1im, neither\nwould he be a M:m ; for this Rea!on there is a Di-\nYmc\n\f5'20\n\\rine Providence, which is of the Divine Wifdorri\nfrom the Divine Love. But this doth not take\n~way this Truth, that all ~re predefrined or defigned\nfor Heaven, and none for Hell; whereas if Means\nof Salvation were wan!ing, it would take it a\\vay ;\nneverthelefs that the Means of Salvation are provid-\ned for everv one, and that Heaven is of fuch aNa.:\n. .\nture, that all, of\u00b7whatfoever Religion they be; who\nlive well; may have a Place there; was !hewn above;\nMan is like the Earth, whi~h produceth all Kinds\ncf Fruits, by Virtue of which Faculty Earth is\nEarth, ~m its producing evil Fruit~ doth not take\naway its Power of producing good Fruit aJfo ; it\nwould take it away, ho\\vever, if it could only pro;\ncuce evil Fruit.

Moreover they who arc\n:without the Church, have mere an Idea of God as\nn Man, than the Ch~iflians ; and they who have ~n\nIdea of God a:> a Malt; and live well, are accepted\nby the LorJ, for they acknowledge God to be one in\nPerfon and in Effenc.e, which Chriftians do not do;\nthey alfb think of God in their Life, for they con~\nfider Evils as Sins againfl God, anJ. they who .do\nthis, think of God in their Life. Chrifiians ha.n:\nthe Precepts of their Religion from the vVord, but\nthere arc few who draw any Precepts of Life from\nit ; the Papifl:s do not re::Jd it ; and they of the Re-\nformed Church, who are in \u00b7 Faith fepc:rate fro!n\nCharity, do not attend to thofe Things !:1 it which\nrelate to Life, but only to what relates to Faith, and\nJet the whole \\TVord is Nothing elfe but the Doc-\ntrine of Life.

Now forafmuch as the\nproceeding Divine is Ilimfelf, ~md the Divine Pro\\'-\n~dcnce is the primary Thing that proceedeth, it fol-\nlcws, that to act againl1 the Laws of his Divine\nProvidence, i.; to act ag:1in!l: Himfelf.

Forafmuch\nas there is a Correfpondence between the Life of\nMan and the Vegetation of a Tree, mak~ a Parallel-\niJm, or Compatifon ; the Infancy of Man is com-\nvaratively like the tender Germ of a Tree lprin~ing\n9,~t of the Earth from the Seed ;. the Childhood\nand\n\f526 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNlNG\nand Youth of Man is like th'}t Germ increafing to\na Stem and Branches ; na~ural Truths, which every\nMan firfi imbibes, are like the Leaves with which\nits Branches are covered, Leaves having no other\nSignification in the \\Vord ; Man's Initiation into\nfhe Marriage of Good and True, or the fpiritual\nMarriage, is like the Flowers which that Tree pro-\nduceth in the Spring Time, fpiritual Tr uths being\n~he finall Leaves of thofe Flowers; the firfi Fruits\nof the fpiritual Marriage are like the Beginnings of\nthe Fruit ; fpiritual Goods, which are the Goods of\nCharity, are like the Fruit, and are alfo fignified\nby Fruit in the \\Vord ; the Procreatiom of Wifdom\nfrom Love, a.re like the Seeds, by 1\\'leans of which\nProcreations Man becometh like a GJrden and a\nParadife : Man is alfo defcribed in the \"'\\i\\rord by a\nTree, and his \\Vifdom from Love by a Garden ;_\nNothing elfe is fignified by th~ Garden of Eden,_\nMan indeed is an evil Tree from the Seed, but yet\nthere is pro\"ided an Ingrafting or Inoculation of\nBranches taken from the Tree of Life, by which\nthe Juices dt'awn from the old Root are c.:merted\ninto Juices producing good Fruit.

I. That a\nBelief in momcnraneo'liS Salvation frcm immediate\nMercy is taken from the natural State of Man.\n~\u00b7 That fuch a Belief proceeds from Ignorance of\nhis fpiritual State, which is totally different from his\nnatural State. 3\u00b7 That the DoB:rincs of all the\nChurches in the Chriflian \u00b7v:,rorld confideed interi-\norly are againfi moment::meous Salvation from im-\n~ediate Mercy ; but fiill that it is efl:ablifhcd by\n:j.\\'len of the external Church. FIRST : Tbat Faith\nin monmztaneous Salvation from immediate lv1crcy is\ntaken from tbe natural State of },ian. The natural\nMan from his own State knows no otherwifc than\nthat heavenly Joy is like worldly Joy, and enters by\nInflux and is recei,\u00b7ed in the fame Manner; for Ex~\nample, that it is like a Man's becoming rich, who\nhad been poor, and fo being removed from a forro\\':-\nful State of Poverty to a happy State of Opulence~\nor like a Man's being honoured, who had before\nbeen of no Efl:imation, and fo being removed from\na State of Contempt to a State of Glory; or like\ngoing out ofthe Houfe of Mourning to nuptial Joys:\n}'orafmuch as thefe St2.tes can be ch:mged \\\\'ithin a\nDay, and they have no other Idea of the State of\n:Man afte.r Death, it is evider'.t whence it comes, th:!t\nthere is a Beliefin momcr:taneom Salvation f1o1n im-\nmediate Mercy. 1\\'Ioreoyer in the \\Vorld it is pof-\nf>blc for n:any Pc!\"fons to be in one Company, and\nm\n\\\n\f5-34 ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING.\nin one civil Society, and to be merry together, and\nvet to differ all of them in their Minds; this is the\nCafe in a natural State ; the Reafon is, becaufe the\nExternal of one Man may be accommoda.ted to the\nExternal of another l\\1an, although their Internals..\nbe diffimilar : From this natural State it i:; alfo con~\neluded, that Salvation confi!1:s only in Admi11ion to.\nthe Angels in Heaven, and that Admif!l.on is from\nimmediate Mercy; wherefore it is alfo believed,\nthat Heaven can as well be given to the \\i\\'icked\nas the Good, and that then there is a Gonfociation\nfimilar to what takes Place in the World, only with\nthis.Difference, that it is full of Joy. SECONDLY :\n..But that this Faith proceeds from -Ig;wrance ifa.\/Pirit-\nual State, which is tot~1lly different froni- a natural\nState. The fpiritual State, which is the State of\nMan after Death, is treated ofin many Places abovel\n\\vhere it is fhewn, tbat every one is his own Love;\nand that no one can live with any others but fuch\nas are in a fimilar Love, and that if he comes to\nothers, he cannot refpire his own Life; hence it is,\nthat every one afrer Death enters into a. Society\nlike himfelf, which is compofed of fuch as are in\na flmilar Love, and that he acknowledges them as\nhis Relatives and Friends; and what is wonderful\nwhen he t!1eets with them and fees them, it is as\nthough he had known them from his Jnfancy; this\nCircllmfbncc has its Ground in the Nature of fpit~\u00ad\nitllal i\\ffinity and Friend\u00a3hip ; yea more, no one in\n;1 Sociery can dwell in any other Haufe than his\nuwn; every one in the Society hath his own Houfe,\nwhich he finds prepared for him as fuon as he\ncomes into the Society ; he may be in Company\nwid~\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 535\n\\vith others out of his I-Ioufe, but yet he cannot\ndwell any where but in it; and what is flill more,\nno one can fit in an Apartment in ano~her's Haufe,\nin any Place but his own ; if he fits in any other\nPlace, he becomes impotent of Mind and filent ;\nanJ what is wonderful, every one when he enters a\nRoom knows his own Place ; it is the fame in Tem~\npies, and alfo in Aifemblies when they <'.re met to-\ngether. From thefe Circumfl:ances it is evident,\nthat a fpiritual State is totally different from a natur..\nal State, and indeed fuch, that no one can be any\nwhere but where his reigning Love is, for there the\nDelight cf his Life is, and every one dcfires to be\nin the Delight of his Life, and the Spirit of a Man\ncannot be any where elfe,' becaufe that confi:itute.s\n' the Life of him, yea, his very Refpiration, as alfo the\nl'ulfation of his Heart: It is otherwife in the natur~\n\u00b7al World, where the External of Man is taught\nfrom his Infancy to feign in his Countenance,\nSpeech, and Geft.ure, Delights different from thofe\nof his Internal ; wherefore from the State of a\nMan in the natural \\Vodd, a Conclufion cannot be\nformed concerning his State after Death, for the\nState of every one after Death is fpiritual, which is\nfuch, that he cannot be any where elfe but in the\nDelight of his Love, which he acquired to himfelf\nby his Life in the natural World. Hence it may\n~ppear manifefl:Iy, that no one can be let into the\nDelight of Heaven, which in general is called heav-\nenly Joy, who is in the Delight of Hell, or, what\namounts to the fame, he cannot be let into the De-\nlight of Good, who ~s already in the Delight of E-\nvil; which may be Hill more clearly concluded\nfrom\n\f536 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERl\\TNC\nfrom this Circumil:ancc, that the Liberty of afcenc.l.\ning into Eeaven is not rcfufed any one after Death,\nthe Vvay is fhewn him, Leave is given, and he is in~\ntraduced; but when he comes into Heaven, and by\nbreathing draws in the Delight thereof, if he be in\nEvil, he begins to feel Anguifh in h~s Breafl:, and to\nbe tormented at Heart, and to experience a Swoon,\nin which he writhes himfelf like a Snake placed be-\nfore the Fire, and with his F:1ce averted from Hea-\nven and turned toward Heli,efcapes headlong,neith-\ner can he reil but in a Society of his own prevailing\nLove: Hence it may appear, that to go to Heaven\nis not given to any one from immediate lVIercy;\nconfequently that it does not confifi merely in Ad..\nmillion, as many in this' \\Vorld imagine; alfo that\nnc:ither is Salntion momentaneous, for this fuppo-\nfcs i;nmedi~te Mercy. There were fom~: who in\nthe \\Vorld believed in moment<meous Salvation\nfrom immcdi<..te. l\\1ercy, and when they became\nSpirits, were defirous that their infc:rnal Delight,\nor Delight of Evil, by l'deans of the Divine Om-\nnipotence and the Divine I\\~ercy together, mi&ht be\nchanged into heavenly Delight, or Delight of\nGood ; and forafmuch as this was their Defire, it\nwas alf:::~ permitted that it ihould be dcnc by Ant;c!s,\ny, ho infl:antly removed their infernal Delight; but\nthen, by Ro~on that it W<!S the Delight of their\nLife, conicquc:uly their Life itfdf, rhcy lay as if\nthey were dead, deprived of all Senfe and Motion,\nnor was it pofiible to inf:.1fe into them any other '\nLife but their ow!1, becaufe all Tbings of their l'v1incs\n~nd Bodies \\\\\u00b7ere in a St:1te cf R etroverfion, and\ncould not be contr:.:\u2022:1wife retorted or wrcfl:ed ;\nwherefore\n\fTH:~ DiVINE FROVIDENCI::. 537\n\\vhetefore they were revived by the Intromiffion of\nthe Delight of their Life's Lo\\'e ; afterwards they\nfaid, that in that State they felt interiorly Something\ndireful and horrible, which they would not make\nknown; wherefore it is faid in Heaven, that it j.s\neafier to convert an Owl into a Dove, or a Serpent\ninto a Lamb, than an infernal Spirit into an Angel\nof Heaven. ',fHIRDLY : '17xtt the Dotlrines ofthe\nChurches hi tbe Cbriflian FVorld, interiorly c01!fidered.,\nare contrary to momentaneous Sal\u00b7vation from immediate\n\u00b7\n1\\tfcrcy, but yet that it is dfab!ifbed by j\\1en ofthe ester~\ntzal Church. The DoCtrines of all Churches, view-\ned interiorly, teach Life; where is there any Church\ntvhofe Dot.l:rine doth not teach, that Man ought to\nexamine himfelf1 to fee and acknowledge his Sins;\nto confefs them, repent, and then lead a new Life?\nI.Vho is admitted to the holy Communion without\nthis Admonition and Command? Inquire, and you\n\\vill be confirmed. What Church is there, \\Yhofe\nDoCl:rine is not founded upon the Precepts of the\nDecalogue:? and the PrecelJtS of the Decalogue are\nPrecepts of Life. \\Vhat Man is there of the\nChurch, in whom there is any Thing of the Church,\n\\Vho doth not acknowledge, as foon as he hears it,\nthat he is faved who lives \\Veil, and he is condemned\nwho lives wickedly? The}\u00b7efore in the Athanafian\nCreed, which is alfo the Dotl:rine received in the\n\\vhole Chriilian \\li[orld, it is faid, \"That the Lord\nwill come to judge the ~ick and the Dead, and.\nthen they who have done Good, will enter into Life\neverlailing, and they who have done Evil, into e\\'\u2022\nerlafl:ing Fire.\" From which it is evident, that the\nbotl:rines of all Churches, viewed interiorly, teach\nU u u Life,\n\fSJ8 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCERNiNG\nLife, and forafmuch as they teach Life, they teach\nthat Salvation is according to Life; and the Life of\nMan is not infpired in a Moment, but formeti fuc-\ncefiively, and reformed as Man fhunneth Evils as\nSins; confequently as he knoweth what Sin is, and\nfees :md acknowledges it, and ash-:: doth not will it,\nand therefore defifl:eth from it ; .and as he alfo know-\neth the Means, whith relate to the Knowledge of\nGod; by thefe, which cannot be infufed in a Mo..:\nment, the Life of Man is formed and reformed; for\nhereditary Evil is 'to be removed, which in itfelf is\ninfernal; and in Place of it, Good, which in itfelf is\ncle!lial, is to be implanted : Man, from his heredit-\nary Evil, may be compared to an Owl as to Under~\nftn ding)\u2022 anJ to a Serpent as to vVill ; and a reform-\ned Man may be compared to a Dove as to Under-\nfianding, and to a Lamb as to vVill ; who doth not\nfee, that knoweth any Thing of the Life of lY!an,\nthat this cannot be eifeCl:ed, except the Nature of\nthe Owl and Serpent be taken away, :md the Nature\nof the Dove and Lamb be impbnted ? Moreover it\nis well known, t:hat every intelligent Man may be..-\ncome more intelligent, and ever'y wife l\\1an more\nwife, and that !ntelligence and Wifdom in Man may\nincreafe, and in fame do increafe; from Infancy to\ntheir Life's End, and that thus Man is continually\nperfeCl:ed. Why !hould not this be more eminently\nthe Cafe with fpiritual Intelligence and \\Vi!dom;\nwhich afcends by twb Degrees above natural ln.;\ntclligence anJ Wifdom? and when it afceuds, it\nbecomes Angelic, which is unutterable; that this\nin Angels increafes to Eternity, was faid above :\n\\Vho may not comprehend, if he will, that what\n;s\n\fTm: DrvrNE PROVIDENCE. 539\ni~ perfetted to Eternity, ~annat pofiibly be perfca\n~n an InJ!:ant ?\n339\u00b7 Illen~e then it is evident, that all who think\nfrom ~.ife concerning S<llvation, do not think of any\nmomentaneous Salvation fran) immedi~tt; Mercy,\nl;mt of the \u00b7Means of Salv?.tion, on which and by\nwhich the Lord operates according to the Lnvs of\nhis Divine Providence, therefore by which Man is\nled out of pure Mercy.by the Lord. But they who\ndo not think from. Life conc~rning SaJvation, imag~\ni_\nne there is Something momentaneous in Salvation,\n;md Something immediate in M.ercy ; as th~y do alfo,\nwho feparate Faith from Charity; Charity is Life, and\nthey fuppofe ~here is. Something momentaneous in\nFaith, at th.e Hour of Dt!ath, if o.ot before ; they al-\nfo do the fa.me, who bel.ieve Remiilion of Sins v..\u00b7ith~\nout Repenta.nce to b~ Abfolu.tion frolll:Sins, and con~\nfequently Salvation,_a~1d who with: th.is IJea receive\nthe Lord's Supper; lik.~wife they, who have Faith in\nthe Indulgences of Mo11ks; and i~ their Prayers for. ..\nthe Dead ;. c.nd in their Difpenf~.tions. grounded in\nthe Power they claim over the Souls. of Men.\n340. IV. 'rbat momentaneous Salvatiunjrom immt;-\n(!iate Mercy is thefi::ry flying Serpent in tbe. Cburcb :\nBy a fiery flying Serpent is meant .I;:vil f11ining from\ninfernal Fire, the fame as is meant by t!\"le fie;y flying\nSerpent in Ifaiah,_ \"Reioice P,ot thm: whole Palef-\ntina, becaufe the Rod of him that fmote thee is\nbroken ; for out of the Serpent's Root flull come\nforth a Cockatrice, and his Fruit {hall be a l:ery\nflying Serpent,\" xiv. 29. Such an E\\'il flieth in\nthe Church, when there is Faith in momentaneous\n$y.~ration. from immediate Mercy ;, for thereby, z.\nReligion\n\fJ40 ANGELIC VVlSDOM CONCE~tNINC;\nReligion is abolill1ed. ~. Security is induced. 3i\nDamnation is imputed to the Lord. As to what con.\ncerns the FIRST, That thereby Religion is ahc!if!Jed;\nthere are two Eifentia!s, and at the fame Time Uni.,\nYerfals of Religion, an A<;:knowledgment of a God,\nand Repentance ;\u00b7 thefe two Eifentials are ufelefs to\nthofe, who think to be f:l,Yed barely frmn Mercy,\nwithout Regard to their Uves ; for what Need\nhave they of any Thing more, than to fay, God\nhave Mercy upon me? As to ew;r.y Thing elfe ap-\npertaining to Religion, they are in the Dark, ye<'\nthey Joye Darknefs :. Of the firft Eifenti(\\1 of the\nChurch, wh\\<;:h is an A<;:knowledgm~nt of <;;od,\nthey only think, What is God~ who ever faw him?\nIf it is affirmed that there is a God, and that he is\nOne, they affent that he is One ; if it is affirmed\nthat there are Three, they alfo fay th~t there ar~\nThree, but that thefe Three are to be called One ~.\nThis is their Acknowledgment of God. Of the\nother Effential of the Church, which is Repentance,\nthey think Nothing at all, confequently neither any\nThing of Sin, and at length do not know that there\nis fuch a Thing as Sin ; and then they hear and\nimbibe with Pleafu,re, that the Law doth not con.\ndemn, becaufe a Chrifi:~an is not unJer its \\'oke ;,\nif you only fay, God have Mercy upon me for thy\nSon's Sake, you will be faved ; this is, Repentance\nof Life with them. But remove Repent_aJ;J.ce, or,\n... what amo\\tnts to the fame, fepa:rate Life from Re\"'\n!igion, and what remains. but the VIords, Have\nMercy upon me ? Hence it is, that they could not\n~onceive otherwife, but that Salvation is effeCted in\n~ MQm~nt by means of thofe \\Vo~ds, i.f not before~\ny~t\n\fTHE DIVINE PROVIDENCE. .54~\nyet at the Hour of Death : In fuch Cafe, what is\nthe \\Vord to them, but like an obfcure and. enig-\nmatical Voice, uttered from a Tripod in a Cave? or\nlike an unintelligible Refponfe from the Oracle of\nan Idol ? In a \\Vord, if you remove Repentance,\nthat is, feparate Life from Religion, what elfe is\nMan, in this Cafe, but Evil !hining from infernal\nFire, or a fiery flying Serpent in the Church ? for\nwithout Repentance Man is in Evil, and Evil is\nHell. SECONDLY : That by Faitb in momentmzeous\nSalvati01z, from pure Mercy alone, Security o\/ Lift is\ninduced.. Security of Life arifes either from the\nBeli~f of' the Impious that there is no Life after\nDeath, or from the J3e1ief of thofe who feparate ,\nLife from Salvation ; a Perfon of the latter Defcrip-\ntion, although he were to believe in eternal Life,\nfl:ill th~nks, whether I llve well, or live ill, 1 can be\nfaved, becaufe Salvation is pure Mercy, and the\nMercy of God is univerfal, inafmuch as he v\\'illeth\n~1ot the Death of any one; and if haply a Thought\noccurs that Mercy is to be implored by a Form d\nWords agreeable to the commonly received Faith,\nhe may think that this, if not before, can be done\n~t the Hour of Death; every Man, who is in fuch\n<J. State of Security, makes light of Adulteries,.\nJ,''rauds, Injufi:ice, Violence, Blafphemies, and Re-\nvenge ; and gives a loofe to his Fldh and his Spirit\nin the committing of all thefe Evils ; neither doth\nhe know what fpiritual Evil is, and its Concupifcen- \u00b7\nces; if he hears any Thing thereof out of the v.,rord,\nit is comparatively like Somewhat fal)ing upon Eb-\nony and rebounding, or like Somewhat which falls.\n\\IAt.O a l)itchl and is fwallowed up. TmRor.Y: 'That\nby\n\fJ42 ANGELIC \\VISDOM CONCER:IiiNC\nby fuch a Faith Damnation is imputed to the Lora\\\n\\Vho but mufl: conclude that it i~. not the Fault of\nMan, but of the Lord, if he is not faved, when every \u00b7\none can be faved froQl pure Mercy? I\u00a3 it be affirmed,\nthat Faith is the Means of S2,lvation, he \"yill urge,\nVJ'hat Man is there to whom fuch faith may not\nbe given, inafmuch liS it only confifl:s in Tho1,1ght,.\nwhich can be infufed in every State of th,e Spirit\nabftraB:ed from worldly Things, even with Confi._\ndence ? A:pd he may further urge, I cannot take it\nof myfelf; if therefore it is no~ given, and Man is.\ndamned, what elfe.. can, th,e Damned think, than tha~\nit is the Lord'\u00b7s Fault, who could fave him, and\nwould not ? Apd would not this pe to call the Lord\nunmerciful? Moreover in he Warmth of his Faith.\nhe may atk, Why can the Lord fee fo many Damn~\ned in Hell, when neverthelefs he is ;:1ble to fave al~\nin a Moment from a Principl~ of pure Mercy? Not\nto mention other Sttgg~fl:i0na: of q like Nature, which\ncan be c;,dled Nothing elfe but impious Impeach~\nments of the Divinity. Hence then it may appear,\nthat Faith in momentaneous Salva.tion from pur~\u00ad\nMercy, is the fiery flying Serpent in the Ch:nch._ ..\n\u2022 \u2022 * \u2022 \u2022 '\nEXCUSE my adding this Relz.tion to fill up the.\nfuperfluous Paper : Certain Spirits by Permiffion\nafcended from He!!, and faid to me, Thou ha{~\nwritten much from the Lord, write Something alfo\nfrom us : I anf\u2022vered, What iliall I write ?

They\nreplied, they were perceived by others as Stenches\nfrom Excrement, putrid Smells from dead Bodies;\nand the Effluvia of ftagnated Urine: I faid, Are\nthofe Thing-\ns delightful to you ?
