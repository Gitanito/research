His family belonged to the Alevi sect, which believes in reincarnation. He is thought to have died between the ages of forty and fifty, placing his birthdate between 1907 and 1917. A vegetable farmer, he had become prosperous enough to own two houses. As his first wife, Hatice, was unable to bear children, he married a second one, \u015eehide, polygamy being an accepted custom among the Alevi. The wives lived in separate households and reportedly got along well.\n\n\u015eehide S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f was thought to be 25-30 at her death, placing her birthdate between 1927 and 1932. She bore five children: G\u00fclseren, Hikmet, Zeki, Zihni and \u0130smet, and was in early labour with the sixth, when she was killed.\n\nThere were no eyewitnesses to the murders; the events were reconstructed from forensic evidence and confessions. On the night of 31 January 1957, an employee of Abit asked him to come to the stable, saying one of the animals was sick. As Abit leaned over to examine the animal, he was struck on the head with a blacksmith\u2019s hammer, and probably died instantly.\n\nWondering why he had not returned, \u015eehide went out to the stable, and was killed in the same manner. The two youngest children, Zihni and \u0130smet, were also murdered; informants disagreed about whether they had gone with their father or mother. Two other children, Zeki and Hikmet, were in the house at the time; a mattress was thrown over Hikmet by the murderers when they came into the house to rob it, and Zeki saved himself by hiding, then ran to Hatice\u2019s house for help. The criminals plundered \u015eehide\u2019s body of a necklace, but fled without stealing anything else.\n\nFive men were arrested, charged and tried; eventually Ramazan, an employee of Abit, and one other man were executed by hanging. Because the trial was delayed, the hangings occurred after \u0130smail had begun to speak of his previous life as Abit.  Investigations  \u0130smail Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\n\nThe case of \u0130smail Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 was first investigated by Re\u015fat Bayer, who heard about it from newspapers in Turkey and beyond. He started conducting interviews in late 1962. In the same year, premier reincarnation researcher Ian Stevenson heard about the case from a Reuters account in an Indian newspaper. He investigated the case for three days in March 1964, accompanied by Bayer, who carried out further investigation himself in the autumn of 1966. Both researchers conducted follow-up interviews in October 1967, returning again in 1970 and 1973 to obtain testimony from informants who had not been interviewed previously. Bayer returned once more in 1975 for additional interviews. The case was followed over a period of thirteen years.\n\nBayer published a report in Turkish in 1965,1 in which he criticized \u0130smail Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s father and questioned the case\u2019s authenticity. Stevenson published his case report in his 1980 book Cases of the Reincarnation Type,&nbsp;Vol. III: Twelve Cases in Lebanon and Turkey,2 In his report, Stevenson notes that Bayer did not have the benefit of interviews conducted after 1965 when he wrote his, and also that Bayer fully fact-checked Stevenson\u2019s report prior to publication.\n\nThe concern about authenticity centred on the fact that Mehmet Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, \u0130smail\u2019s father, requested money in return for his testimony, which Stevenson paid, and that two friends of Abit S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f claimed the case was false. Bayer felt that the father\u2019s mercenary approach fatally damaged its credibility; Stevenson disagreed, observing that the two friends had owed Abit money, as \u0130smail said, giving them a motive to declare his memories fraudulent.\n\nHowever, Stevenson hesitated to publish the case until an opportunity for independent investigation arose in 1973. Both Stevenson and Bayer had visited Adana so frequently that they were well-known there, so on this occasion they brought with them an interpreter, Ya\u015far Atakam, who had never visited the city. Stevenson asked him to frequent a caf\u00e9 in the M\u0131d\u0131k district and converse about the case with locals \u2013 some of whom were already informants in the case \u2013 without revealing his connection to the investigation. Stevenson also asked Atakam to learn what he could from local officials about the case, and about Mehmet Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s reputation for honesty. If informants thought they were speaking with a tourist or casual visitor, Stevenson reasoned, they might be more forthcoming than with the investigators. Broadening the sources would also help determine whether or not the story might have been fabricated.&nbsp;\n\nOver a period of two days, Atakam obtained information from seven people whom neither Bayer nor Stevenson had interviewed. In one instance he freely obtained details which Stevenson had previously been offered only in return for payment of a sum so high that Stevenson had declined. This extra information gained by Atakam, in Stevenson\u2019s view, strengthened the case rather than weakening it, leading him to conclude it was safe to publish.\n\nBetween them Stevenson, Bayer and Atakam interviewed 39 people, a greater number than in any case previously investigated by Stevenson, in order to ensure plentiful corroboration of Mehmet\u2019s recollections.  Cevriye Bayr\u0131\n\nStevenson first heard of the case of Cevriye Bayr\u0131 in 1964, and began investigating it in collaboration with R Bayer that year. Bayer continued in 1966 and they collaborated again in 1967, carrying out further interviews and rechecking details. In February 1973, Stevenson conducted a long interview with Cevriye\u2019s mother, and also gathered information from her older brother. Later that year, Stevenson returned to Adana and interviewed Cevriye, now fifteen years old. In May 1975, Bayer re-interviewed Abit and S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f\u2019s two children Zeki and Hikmet, and interviewed a new informant, a young girl who was working as a gardener for Abit when the murders happened. In total, nineteen informants were interviewed.\n\nStevenson published Cevriye Bayr\u0131\u2019s case immediately following \u0130smail Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s in the same book.3  \u0130smail Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\n\nBefore \u0130smail\u2019s birth, a woman relative who lived near the family had a dream in which Abit S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f was sitting talking with Mehmet Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, \u0130smail\u2019s father. Three men called to Abit from outside the house, asking him to come out, but he replied, \u2018No, I am going to stay here. I will not come back.\u2019&nbsp;She did not know that \u0130smail\u2019s mother was pregnant at the time.&nbsp;\n\nAlt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 was born on or around 30 September 1957 (the documentation is unclear) in the M\u0131d\u0131k district of Adana, which adjoins the Bey district. His family\u2019s house was about two kilometres distant from the house in which Abit S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f had lived.\n\nMehmet recounted that \u0130smail already started to intimate he had lived a previous life at eighteen months, as soon as he could talk. When he could speak fluently, he denied that his name was \u0130smail, and insisted it was \u2018Abit\u2019. He then gave details of Abit\u2019s life, including the names of his two wives, Hatice and \u015eehide, the names of his three surviving children, G\u00fclseren, Zeki and Hikmet, and the names of people who owed him money. He complained about his current family\u2019s poverty and said he hoped the debtors would pay up. On the same evening, he also gave details of the murder, including the name of the man who had committed it: Ramazan.\n\nAs he grew, the boy continued to insist that his name was Abit, and frequently demanded that his parents take him to his previous home and family. Word about his statements reached members of the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f family, and Hatice, the surviving wife, visited the Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 family accompanied by her stepdaughter G\u00fclseren. Later, when \u0130smail was about three, his father took him to the Bey district, allowing him to lead the way. Mehmet expected the boy to lead him to the house which he mistakenly had thought had been the site of the murder, but \u0130smail instead went to the one where it actually had taken place. He recognized various persons whom Abit had known and places he had been. The two families continued to meet, and \u0130smail\u2019s desire to be close to the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f family persisted.\n\n\u0130smail\u2019s statements relating to Abit\u2019s life and recognitions of people known to Abit number 49, as laid out in Stevenson\u2019s case report.4 Most were made before the two families met, as far as Stevenson could tell. Correct statements in addition to those mentioned above, and verified by Abit\u2019s relatives and friends as well as police records in matters of the murder, include:   \tAbit had two wives because the first was unable to have children. \tHe lived in the Bey district. \tHe was a vegetable farmer. \tHis garden had fruit trees, including orange and quince. \tHe had two oxen and two cows, one of which was named \u2018Suzan\u2019. \tHe owned a pump and a barrel (both of which he recognized at the house) and a horse. \tHe kept a bed in the stable. \tHe liked to drink raki, a strong Turkish liquor, with his friends. \tOne of his drinking companions was named Abd\u00fcrrezzak. \tHe drank raki every night with Mahmut Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, who worked the fields with him, and the two sometimes brought girls to their parties. \tRamazan murdered him by hitting him on the head (he said with a \u2018bar of iron\u2019, but he could not have seen the weapon since it was done from behind). \t\u015eehide, Zihni and \u0130smet were all murdered the same night. \t\u015eehide was in labour at the time.\n\nWhen \u0130smail was three, he spontaneously recognized in the street an ice-cream seller who had been a close friend of Abit, and told him the names of his wife and children. He also recognized the man\u2019s son and said, accurately, that he had worked for Abit. Other friends of Abit he recognized spontaneously, or on being asked \u2018Who am I?\u2019\n\nAbit\u2019s wife Hatice and his youngest surviving children, Zeki and Hikmet, fully accepted \u0130smail as Abit\u2019s reincarnation; the oldest, G\u00fclseren, remained uncertain.\n\n\u0130smail also displayed behaviours reminiscent of Abit, most notably his insistence that his true name was Abit. This inclination was so strong that his parents allowed him to use it for his school registration \u2013 something Stevenson had never seen in any other case. He spoke in first person and present tense about the previous life, saying for instance, \u2018I have two wives.\u2019&nbsp;He liked to drink raki and wear a cloth over his shoulder, as Abit had done. When he heard that Ramazan had been hanged, he was delighted, clapping his hands in joy. He liked to sit in a certain chair in a shop that Abit had habitually sat in. He complained that his current family was poor, a reflection of his previous relative wealth. He was very affectionate towards the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f family, and he repeatedly asked Abit\u2019s debtors to pay up.  Cevriye Bayr\u0131\n\nCevriye Bayr\u0131 was born on 1 October 1958, a little less than two years after the deaths of Abit and \u015eehide S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f, in the Akkap\u0131 district of Adana, which is also close to the Bey district. Her family\u2019s home was about six kilometres from the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f house. Her father, Kerim Bayr\u0131, was a tinsmith with ten children, of whom she was the ninth. Kerim had known Abit well, but they were not friends, and the two families were not close enough to know intimate information such as the names of Abit\u2019s debtors.\n\nAccording to Cevriye\u2019s older brother, the girl began speaking before her first birthday, and immediately mentioned her previous life. One of her first words was \u2018azu\u2019, which, as she gained verbal skill, developed into the phrase \u2018Ramazan killed\u2019. Between the ages of two and three, she gave details of the murder from \u015eehide S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f\u2019s point of view: how she had missed her husband and gone out to look for him; how Ramazan, the murderer, had taken her gold necklace, and how the baby she was carrying was born after she died \u2013 an apparent intermission memory, that is, a memory of events between death and rebirth. (The baby had not survived). She correctly gave the names of \u015eehide\u2019s husband and three living children.\n\nStevenson notes that Cevriye\u2019s verified statements cannot be taken as strong evidence because she would likely have heard mention of them, as \u0130smail Alt\u0131nk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s case became news in the community, reviving talk of the murders as well. Kerim confirmed that \u2018everyone\u2019 had heard about \u0130smail\u2019s memories before Cevriye, who was born about a year later than him, began talking about her memories, and in fact it was also known that \u015eehide\u2019s tomb had been opened, and the dead baby observed, partly extruded from her body. (Stevenson notes that post-mortem birth is rare but does happen, citing two case reports.) Cevriye did state some facts unknown to her mother, however.\n\nIn Stevenson\u2019s opinion, the strength of the case lay in Cevriye\u2019s recognitions, between the ages of two and five, of former relatives and friends both in person and in photographs, including ones not known to her own family, and in behaviours that reflected the life of \u015eehide.\n\nAt the age of two, Cevriye recognized an ice-cream seller \u015eehide had known who happened to be passing in the street, recalling that she had given him food, which the man confirmed. According to her mother, she recognized \u015eehide\u2019s sister, Fehime Hasan, who asked her a negative question to test her: \u2018If you claim to be my sister, tell me why you did not visit me when I was ill and in the hospital?\u2019 Cevriye answered correctly, \u2018But I did visit you, with my children.\u2019 Fehime stated that, the first time she visited, Cevriye ran toward her saying \u2018my sister\u2019.\n\nShe also recognized \u015eehide\u2019s former friends Sade Demirci, G\u00fcll\u00fc Deniz and Nadire Mirel, recalling correctly that Nadire had been her tailor. Of the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f family, she recognized Abit\u2019s first wife, Hatice, and \u015eehide\u2019s children G\u00fclseren, Hikmet and Zeki. When Cevriye\u2019s mother showed her a picture of Abit and \u015eehide, she said \u2018This is my photograph, with my husband.\u2019\n\nAs a small child, Cevriye displayed a pervasive fearfulness, frequently running to her mother in fright. She had a strong fear of darkness, possibly due to \u015eehide having been murdered in darkness. At one point when she was just two, the lights in the house went out due to a power failure and she began to cry \u2018Ramazan is going to kill me!\u2019\n\nSimilar to \u0130smail, she repeatedly asked her parents to change her name from Cevriye to \u015eehide, but they did not consent.  Meeting of the Children\n\nWhen the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f family learned that Cevriye might be the reincarnation of \u015eehide, both families decided the two children should meet, and \u0130smail was brought to Cevriye\u2019s family\u2019s home by his father and several other witnesses. At the time, \u0130smail was five and Cevriye was four.\n\nWitnesses gave varying accounts. According to \u0130smail\u2019s father, the two children ran to each other, kissed and embraced warmly. Someone brought some ice cream for \u0130smail and he gave it to Cevriye. Cevriye\u2019s mother said \u0130smail embraced Cevriye but that her reaction was not as warm; she then quizzed \u0130smail on facts which both Abit and \u015eehide S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f would have known, such as the number of cattle they owned, and corrected him on the ones he got wrong. Cevriye herself told Stevenson, at the age of nine, that \u0130smail had caressed her hand, and they had exchanged gifts. She also said they shared accounts of the murders, and he asked why she had not come to his aid; according to Cevriye\u2019s mother, she asked him the same question. (As Stevenson pointed out, the murders were committed in such a way that neither was able to help the other.)\n\nCevriye showed great interest in \u015eehide\u2019s children, expressing worry during her own mealtimes that they might be hungry, and, during one visit to the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f family, caressing Zeki as he slept. Cevriye\u2019s older brother said that when she was very young, she often cried to be taken to see \u015eehide\u2019s children.\n\nStevenson also learned about some possible physical after-effects of the murder affecting Cevriye. On her birth, Cevriye\u2019s parents noticed a red birthmark at the top of her head; it had faded by the time Stevenson first met her, when she was five. Unlike any other member of her family, she suffered from extremely severe headaches as a child, which diminished as she grew up. Stevenson notes that he found this symptom in other children who recalled being killed by blows to the head, though sometimes \u2013 as in the case of \u0130smail \u2013 it did not appear.5  Later Development&nbsp;\n\nThe two families had more meetings, and \u0130smail retained his affection for the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f family. He frequently took gifts to his former children, and on learning of the death of Abit\u2019s mother, he wept and went to bed without supper. On one occasion, \u0130smail said that he wanted to marry Cevriye and would die if he could not. At the age of nine, according to \u0130smail\u2019s father, he still sometimes wept because he missed his past-life children.\n\n\u0130smail dropped out of school in 1965, and by 1970 was working in a photographer\u2019s studio. In 1973, aged fifteen, he returned to school, far behind his age group. He told Stevenson his memories were fading, but described new intermission memories that Stevenson found implausible and likely imaginative, based on people around him wanting to know what had happened during that time. At sixteen, he left school to work as a labourer in a cotton factory. He continued to visit Abit\u2019s children occasionally, and still considered his real name to be Abit, though he would answer to \u0130smail as well.\n\nThe two adolescents visited each other on several more occasions, but Cevriye remained cool to \u0130smail. Despite this and her mother forbidding her to meet him, at aged sixteen he was still talking about the possibility of the two becoming married, possibly encouraged by his mother.\n\nAt the age of fifteen, Cevriye had apparently retained her original memories, but had become embarrassed by her claim of having had a husband in a previous life. However, she remained close to the S\u00fcz\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f family. She said she saw \u0130smail now and then on the street but did not talk to him, too abashed to do so, but still visited two of \u015eehide\u2019s children on occasion. Stevenson noted she was developing normally.\n\nKM Wehrstein  Literature\n\nBayer, R. (1965). Reenkarnasyon. Istanbul: \u00d6zg\u00fc Yay\u0131nevi.\n\nStevenson, I. (1980).
