G. PlDDINGTON.\r\n\" They order, said I, this matter better in France.\"\r\nSteme, A Sentimental Journey.\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nAt the end of 1913, Dr. Gustave Geley read a paper\r\nbefore the Societe Universelle d''Etudes Psychiques, in the\r\ncourse of which he discussed the cross-correspondences\r\npublished in our Proceedings, and gave an account of\r\n5 cases of cross-correspondence that had occurred during\r\nthe summer of 1913, between two French automatists. 2 These cases being all of a very simple and clean-cut\r\ncharacter require little explanation and commentary, and\r\n1 This paper was read at a General Meeting of the Society on January 29, 1915.\r\n2 Contribution a Vitude des Correspondances croise\"es ( Documents Nouveaux\r\n)\r\nConference faite par Le Docteur Gustave Geley. Paris, Imprimerie E. Roussel,\r\n20, rue Gerbert, 1914. A\r\n2 J. G. Piddington. [part\r\nare all described in a few pages ; and so, thinks Dr.\r\nGeley, contrast favourably with our cross-correspondences,\r\nwhich have to have big, fat volumes written about them\r\nbefore their intricacies and obscurities are\u2014I must not say\r\nunravelled and elucidated, but\u2014placed before the reader.\r\nIn fact, remarks Dr. Geley, there lies the same psychological abyss between his cross-correspondences and ours\r\nas between the French mind and the Northerner's mind.\r\nI suspect that Dr. Geley was restrained only by the\r\npoliteness characteristic of his nation from pronouncing\r\nour cross-correspondences to be as foggy as our climate.\r\nWhat he actually does say is that while the Northerner\r\ndelights in complicated researches and mysterious symbols\r\nand subtle arguments, the French mind craves for clear- ness and orderliness ; and that the effect of these two\r\ndifferent diatheses can be seen in the cross-correspondences\r\nproduced on opposite sides of the Channel.\r\nNow, I ought to be one of the last people to deny\r\nthat some of our cross-correspondences are complex\r\nand difficult to follow ; yet I think that Dr. Geley's\r\ncondemnation of our poor English efforts is too wholesale,\r\nfor we have published some simple and straightforward\r\ncases: e.g. \"A triangle within a circle\" and \"Laurel\r\nWreath\" in Proc, Vol. XXII., \"Neptune and trident,\" \" Troy and Joy \" and \" Exile and Moore \" in Vol. XXIV.\r\n;\r\nand this last volume also contains the \" Sesame and\r\nLilies \" case, which, apart from some unessential excrescences, is not really involved.\r\nBut as Dr. Geley has either overlooked these instances\r\nor does not think them simple or numerous enough, I\r\npropose in this paper to produce some fresh examples of\r\nfairly simple cross-correspondence, in the hope of convincing our French critic that, in spite of our national predilection\r\nfor the obscure and complex, our automatists are not\r\nquite so black as he has painted them.\r\nI do not mean that their phenomena rival, but only that\r\nthey sometimes approach within humble distance of those of\r\nthe French automatists. These Dr. Geley describes as being\r\n\" d'une grande simplicity \" ; and no one who has read his\r\npaper would, I think, quarrel with that description of them.\r\nLxxn.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 3\r\nFour out of the five cases reported by Dr. Geley conform\r\nto one of two patterns.1 Either both automatists write\r\n\" Polly, put the kettle on \" ; or else Automatist A writes\r\n\" There was a little girl \" and \" right in the. middle of\r\nher forehead,\" while Automatist B writes \" and she had\r\na little curl \" : the sum of these parts making\r\n\" There was a little girl,\r\nAnd she had a little curl\r\nRight in the middle of her forehead.\"\r\nOur own automatists, you will find, only once quite\r\nsucceed in attaining the majestic simplicity of the first\r\ntype ; and can produce but clumsy imitations of the\r\nsecond. Still, if allowance be made for the racial disadvantages under which they labour, they will, I hope,\r\nbe thought to have done better than might have been\r\nexpected.\r\nBut the aim of this paper is not only to vindicate our automatists from some of the aspersions cast on\r\nthem by Dr. Geley, but also to describe some concordant\r\nautomatisms of a simple type as simply as I may, for\r\nthe benefit of any weaker vessels\u2014if such there be in our Society\u2014who, like Dr. Geley, Dr. Maxwell and others,\r\nhave found much of the previous evidence difficult of\r\ndigestion.\r\nI also aspire, though with no very sanguine hopes\r\nof success, at bringing forward evidence which will alter\r\nDr. Maxwell's opinion of our cross-correspondences. Dr.\r\nMaxwell, as Dr. Geley reminds us in his article, at present\r\nconsiders that they are to be put down to chance or\r\nelse to forced and overfanciful interpretation.\r\nI do not, however, propose to argue the question of\r\nwhether chance is an insufficient explanation of the\r\ncoincidences I am about to describe, because theoretically\r\nchance may always be held to explain a coincidence,\r\nor, rather, may always be urged as an alternative to\r\n1 As I am dealing here only with the pattern in which the French\r\ncross-correspondences are cast, I leave out of account the fact that,\r\nexcept in one instance apparently, the coincidental phrases are original\r\nand' not drawn from a literary source.\r\n4 J. G. Piddington. [part\r\nsome other explanation. If ten automatists on the\r\nsame day each wrote : \"A covey of elephants danced\r\nround Buckingham Palace, and sang ' We won't go home\r\ntill morning ' \", no one could prove that chance would\r\nnot cover the coincidences. One has to judge in these\r\nmatters by common sense ; and common sense does not\r\nlead everyone to the same conclusion.\r\nI do not intend, either, in this paper to raise such\r\nquestions as whether the cross-correspondences are purposive, or whether there lies behind them any ulterior\r\nmeaning, or whether their content affords evidence of\r\nthe action of surviving personalities.\r\nRather my design is to throw each of the coincidences\r\nat the reader, so to speak, and then to limit myself to\r\nasking him, explicitly or implicitly, this question : \" Do\r\nyou believe this kind of thing happens by chance ? Or,\r\nif you think this or that coincidence is due to chance,\r\ndo you think a series of such coincidences is ? \"\r\nI shall have occasion in the course of this paper to\r\nmention a new automatist under the pseudonym of\r\nMrs. King. All that I need say about her is that she\r\nhas only recently developed the automatic faculty, that\r\nshe has been a member of this Society for a good many\r\nyears, and that she is known to me and much better\r\nknown to some of my colleagues.\r\nI shall also have occasion to state how often particular\r\nwords, phrases or quotations have occurred in the various\r\nscripts. These statements, I may explain, are not made\r\nupon the strength of perfunctory examinations of the\r\nscripts, but are based upon elaborate indexes of words,\r\nphrases and quotations occurring in the scripts of all the automatists whom I shall mention except Mrs. King.\r\nNaturally, I do not claim that these indexes are entirely\r\nfree from errors of commission and omission ; but I may\r\nsay that they have been compiled with care and are constantly being checked.\r\nTo save repetition in each individual case, I may as\r\nwell at this point make two observations, which apply to all\r\nthe cases of cross-correspondence dealt with in this paper.\r\nlxxil] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 5\r\nIn the first place, it is to be understood that no one\r\nof the automatists contributing to any given cross-corre- spondence saw the contributions made to it by the other\r\nautomatists until some time\u2014usually a long time\u2014after\r\nthe cross-correspondence was complete.1 In the second place, I have asked all the automatists\r\nconcerned whether the topics which have formed the\r\nthemes of the cross-correspondences had, to the best\r\nof their recollection and belief, been brought to their\r\nattention in some ordinary, everyday manner at or about\r\nthe time when references to them emerged in their scripts.\r\nTo this question, it is to be understood, unless otherwise\r\nstated, that the answer in each case was \" No.\"\r\nFestina lente.\r\nThe subject of my first case is the words \" Festina\r\nlente,\" which mean \" Hasten slowly.\" This motto is found for the first time in any of the scripts in Mrs.\r\nHolland's script of Dec. 9, 1908. I do not regard this occurrence of it as forming part of the cross-correspondence, and confine myself to stating the fact.\r\nNearly five years pass before it is quoted again by\r\nany of the automatists. Then, on Nov. 28 and again\r\non Dec. 19, 1913, it appears in the script of Mrs. King,\r\nwho had not seen Mrs. Holland's script. 2 Less than three weeks later\u2014on Jan. 6, 1914\u2014it re- appears in the script of Miss Verrall,3 who had seen\r\n1 In making this statement without qualification, I am not losing\r\nsight of the cases where a phrase has been \" cribbed \" by one auto- matist from another's script, because a coincidence of this kind, unless otherwise reinforced, does not constitute a cross-correspondence'. See\r\npp. 10, 11, 20, 21.\r\n2 Parts of Mrs. Holland's script of Dec. 9, 1908, have been printed\r\nin the Proceedings (Vol. XXIV., p. 320 ; XXV., p. 250), but not the\r\npart containing the words \"Festina lente.\"\r\n3 As both this paper and the scripts discussed in it were written\r\nbefore Miss Verrall's marriage to Mr. W. H. Salter, I refer to her\r\nthroughout by her maiden name.\r\n6 J. G. Piddington. [part\r\nneither Mrs. Holland's nor Mrs. King's script, in the\r\nfollowing form :\r\nFestinasse lente dulcedine captus amoris\r\ntemporis impatiens . . - 1 festina lente.\r\nA literal translation of this would be : \" To have\r\nhastened slowly 2 captivated by the charm of love\r\nimpatient of time . . . hasten slowly.\" Probably\r\n\" dulcedine captus amoris temporis impatiens \" is an\r\nattempt to say : \" One whom love has made captive\r\nchafes at delays.\" In any case a contrast must be\r\nintended between \" temporis impatiens \" and \" festina\r\nlente.\"\r\nEleven days later, on Jan. 17, 1914, Mrs. Verrall,\r\nwho had seen Mrs. Holland's script of Dec. 9, 1908,\r\nbut had not seen either Miss Verrall's or Mrs. King's\r\nscript, wrote as follows :\r\nWhere Tweed meets Tyne\r\nThere is a rhyme about the meeting of those rivers\u2014or the\r\nrivers speak\r\nSays Tweed to Tyne\r\nFor Auld Lang Syne\r\nSays Tyne to Tweed\r\nMore haste less Speed.\r\n\" More haste less Speed \" is a very good paraphrase\r\nof \" Festina lente \" ; and the following well-known poem,\r\n1 In the omitted part of the script represented by dots seven distinct topics are mentioned between \"festinasse lente\" and \"festina lente.\" This shows that the fact of two phrases being separated by a considerable interval does not necessarily imply that they do not belong to- gether. Miss Verrall's script of April 6, 1914 (see pp. 13-14) furnishes\r\nanother instance of the separation of two related phrases.\r\n2 The probability (hat \"festinasse,\" the perfect infinitive of festino., was a mere slip of the pen for \" festina,\" the present imperative,\r\nis increased by the fact that, if \" festina \" be substituted for \" festinasse,\" a perfect hexameter line results : \" temporis impatiens \" making the\r\nbeginning of another hexameter. Original Latin hexameters are not uncommon in Miss Verrall's script.\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 7\r\nof which the script is obviously reminiscent, might well\r\nbear the title \" Festina lente.\"\r\nSays Tweed to Till\u2014\r\n' What gars ye rin sae still ?' Says Till to Tweed\u2014\r\n' Though ye rin speed\r\nAnd I rin slaw,\r\nFor ae man that ye droon\r\nI droon twa.'\r\nThe very next day, Jan. 18, 1914, Miss Verrall's script\r\nopens thus : \" Festina lente\u2014note when that phrase\r\nrecurs.\" The first time it appeared in Miss Verrall's script\r\nwas on Jan. 6, 1914, the second time on Jan. 18, 1914\r\n;\r\nand, as between these two dates Miss Verrall produced\r\nno script, her only citations of \" Festina lente \" occur\r\nin successive scripts ; and in between these two successive\r\nscripts falls Mrs. Verrall's \" More haste less Speed.\"\r\nTwice more the motto comes in script : on March 8,\r\nand July 22, 1914 ; each time in Mrs. King's script.\r\nIf the first appearance of the motto in Mrs. Holland's\r\nscript is left out of account, we find that between Nov.\r\n28, 1913, and July 22, 1914, it occurs no less than six\r\ntimes : four times in Mrs. King's and twice in Miss\r\nVerrall's script. Why, I ask, this sudden outburst of\r\nreiterated \" Festina lente's \" ? Moreover, eleven days after the first, and one day before\r\nthe second occurrence of \" Festina lente \" in Miss Verrall's\r\nscript, Mrs. Verrall writes \" More haste less speed \"\r\n\r\na proverb that has not been quoted elsewhere in any\r\nof the scripts.\r\nThough I have felt bound to mention Mrs. Verrall's\r\ncontribution to this cross-correspondence, I cannot help\r\nregarding it as regrettable, because it spoils what would\r\notherwise have been an ideally simple and lucid type\r\nof cross-correspondence. The French blood that flows in\r\nMrs. Verrall's veins ought.! to have saved her from ' thus\r\n\" darkening counsel by words without knowledge.\" I\r\nsuppose she might plead in mitigation that her subliminal\r\npurposely substituted \" More haste less speed \" for \" Festina\r\ns J. O. Piddington\r\n.\r\n[PART\r\nlente \" because it knew that her supraliminal had seen the latter phrase in Mrs. Holland's script. To a conjecture\r\nof this kind I might have listened with sympathy in my\r\nunregenerate days before I read Dr. Geley's paper ; but\r\nnow my ears are deaf to such sophistries.\r\nMusic has charms.\r\nI now turn to two coincidences of a straightforward\r\nland between the scripts of Mrs. and Miss Verrall.\r\nOn April 11, 1913, Miss Verrall's script contained the\r\nfollowing :\r\nthe Lesbian lyre\u2014to strike the lyre with might music hath\r\ncharms.\r\n\" Music hath charms \" is from Congreve's play The\r\nMourning Bride :\r\n\" Music has charms to soothe a savage,, breast,\r\nTo soften rocks, or bend a knotted oak.\r\nI've read that things inanimate have moved,\r\nAnd, as with living souls, have been inform'd\r\nBy magic numbers and persuasive sound.\"\r\nFour days later\u2014on April 15, 1913\u2014Mrs. Verrall's script\r\nopens thus : And the mountain tops that freeze\r\nFollow after follow after\r\nNow with tear and now with laughter\r\nMusic has charms and you know the rest\r\nThen write again Music.\r\n\" And the mountain tops that freeze \" is from \" Orpheus\r\nwith his lute \" hi Henry VIII. ; and it is quite appropriate to associate this song with the quotation from\r\nCongreve's The Mourning Bride, because the context\r\nof \" Music has charms \" there evidently alludes to Orpheus.\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mrs. Verrall did not know the\r\nfull context of \" Music has charms.\" She knew, as everyone does, the whole line \" Music has charms to\r\nsoothe a savage breast,\" but not the succeeding four\r\nlxxii.] Gross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 9\r\nlines which particularly suggest Orpheus. Still, as Mrs.\r\nVerrall herself says, the first line is enough to suggest\r\n\" that Orpheus is likely to be in the neighbourhood.\"\r\nI must not, then, be understood, as claiming that Mrs.\r\nVerralFs script shows a knowledge of the context of \" Music has charms \" which the automatist herself did\r\nnot consciously possess. What I do think is that the\r\nreference in her script to Orpheus which precedes, and\r\nthe remark, \" and you know the rest,\" which follows\r\nthe quotation, suggest that stress is being laid on the\r\nfact of these words having a literary source and a context,\r\nand of their not being a mere unattached proverbial\r\nsaying like \" A rolling stone gathers no moss.\" Why\r\nI wish to make this point will appear presently.\r\nIt is Mrs. Verrall's habit to copy her scripts, soon\r\nafter they are written, into a book which she keeps for\r\nthe purpose ; and to post the originals, as soon as the\r\ncopy is made, to Miss Johnson or me. To the copies\r\nshe adds from time to time various notes and comments, and puts against them the dates on which they\r\nare made. Thus, on April 16, 1913\u2014that is the day\r\nafter \" Music has charms \" appeared for the first and\r\nonly time in her script\u2014she noted that it is a quotation\r\nof which she does not know the source. She teUs me that to the best of her belief nothing\r\nhad happened to bring this quotation to her mind at or about the time when it occurred in her script : I mean\r\nnothing she had lately been thinking of, or reading, or hearing said.\r\nWith Miss Verrall the case is, or appears to be, otherwise.\r\nSome time in April 1913, she talked with her cousin,\r\nMr. Evelyn Riviere, about a Literary Problems Party\r\nwhich they were both concerned in getting up, and\r\nwhich was to, and did, take place on May 19, 1913.\r\nDuring this conversation Mr. Riviere told Miss Verrall\r\nthat one of the questions to be asked at the Party\r\nwas the source of \" Music has charms,\" and he then\r\ninformed her that it came from Congreve's Mourning\r\nBride : a fact previously unknown to her. The date\r\non which this conversation took place Miss Verrall cannot\r\nLO J. G. Piddington. [part\r\nascertain for certain. On my first asking her when it occurred, she said she thought about the end of April,\r\n1913 ; but she subsequently decided that it must have\r\nbeen before April 11, 1913 : the date on which the\r\nquotation appears in her script. I gather from her\r\nthat the chief reason for her change of opinion is that\r\nsince the quotation appeared in her script on April 11,\r\n1913, it was therefore before this date that Mr. Riviere\r\nmentioned it to her. I am not entirely convinced by\r\nthis argument ; for if, as appears to be the case, Mrs.\r\nVerrall got the quotation telepathically from Miss Verrall,\r\nit seems not unreasonable to suppose that Miss Verrall\r\nmay have got it telepathically from Mr. Riviere. I\r\nfind a stronger argument in favour of Miss Verrall's view\r\nin the script itself, which opens with references to \" Dido\r\nwith a willow in her hand \" and to Semele \" the bride of\r\nthe bladed thunder \" : both \" Mourning Brides \" ; and\r\nthis suggests that she knew when this script was written\r\nthat \" Music has charms \" comes from Congreve's Mourning\r\nBride. In any case it is safer to accept the earlier date.\r\nMrs. Verrall, at any rate, knew nothing about the\r\nproblems to be set at the Party until after \" Music has\r\ncharms \" had appeared in her script. On April 27,\r\n1913, Miss Verrall told her mother about the proposed\r\nParty, and mentioned the choice of \" Music has charms \"\r\nas one of the problems, and told her where it came\r\nfrom. Mrs. Verrall was careful to note in her script-book\r\non April 27, 1913, that she then told her daughter that\r\nthe quotation had recently occurred in her own script.\r\nI hope that no one will imagine that I have set forth\r\nthe above facts because I think they afford a normal\r\nexplanation of the cross-correspondence in question. They,\r\nof course, do nothing of the kind. They explain, or may explain, in a perfectly normal way the appearance\r\nof the quotation from Congreve in Miss Verrall's script ; but not its repetition four days later in Mrs. Verrall's.\r\nMy reason for mentioning the facts is to show the kind\r\nof precautions that ought to be taken, and that we do\r\nas a matter of fact take, to guard so far as is possible\r\nagainst the risk of coincidences explicable by normal\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 11\r\ncauses being mistaken for cross-correspondences. It is clear that such pseudo-cross-correspondences are more\r\nlikely to occur in the scripts of a mother and daughter,\r\nwho, it is true, do not live in the same house, but who\r\nmeet at fairly frequent intervals, than in the scripts\r\nof mere acquaintances or strangers. In the case under\r\nreview it is evident that had Mrs. Verrall known about\r\nthe problems to be set at the Party by or before April 16,\r\nthe coincidence might still have occurred, but it would\r\nhave been absurd to claim it as a cross-correspondence.\r\nWalking in Darkness.\r\nThe second example of a cross-correspondence of a simple kind between Mrs. and Miss Verrall is this.\r\nOn September 11, 1913, Mrs. Verrall's script contained\r\nthe following : non visum neque tactum, sed non invisibile neque\r\nintangibile. Interpret that riddle-\u2014they see not neither\r\ndo they hear\u2014no, you miss the point.\r\nShe walks in darkness like the night that gives a\r\nbetter analogy. Try this\u2014her own darkness makes the\r\nnight visible, and the same darkness makes her invisible \u2014then say that inward eye I can't get anything more\r\nhere and now\u2014But I think there is something said that\r\nwanted saying\u2014though there is certainly confusion.\r\n\" She walks in darkness like the night \" is a misquotation of Byron's\r\nShe walks in beauty, like the night\r\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies ; And all that's best of dark and bright\r\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes : Thus mellow'd to that tender light\r\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.\r\nThe misquotation\u2014recognised by the automatist\u2014whether\r\nintentional or not, certainly serves to emphasise the\r\nwords \" walks in darkness.\"\r\nThe Latin means : \" not seen and not touched, but\r\not invisible and not intangible.\"\r\nL2 J. G. Piddington. [part\r\nThe first script written by Miss Verrall after the date\r\nof this script of Mrs. Verrall's\u2014namely, eight days later,\r\non Sept. 19, 1913\u2014contained the following passage :\r\nthe starlit path\u2014the lantern beams\u2014they cast their\r\nlight before them but they themselves walk in darkness \u2014handing on the torch\r\n\r\nThere had been one previous reference in Miss Verrall's\r\nown script to torch-bearing and one to the XajuiraSijcpoplu,1 and three references to the \\a\/u.7ruS>i<popla. in Mrs.\r\nVerrall's script 2 of which Miss Verrall knew ; but in\r\nnone of these cases is there the slightest suggestion of\r\nthe torch-bearers being themselves in darkness.\r\nThe Days of Creation.\r\nThe coincidences in this case consist of a series of\r\nreferences in the scripts of two, and perhaps of three,\r\nautomatists to the Days of Creation. This topic, which\r\nsome seven years later was to become the theme of a\r\nspacious cross-correspondence, first appeared explicitly in\r\nMrs. Verrall's script of Dec. 24, 1906. But before quoting\r\nthis script, I will first quote two earlier scripts of Mrs.\r\nVerrall's, because it seems probable that in them are\r\nto be found the first approaches to the topic clearly\r\nexpressed in the script of Dec. 24, 1906.\r\nExtract from Mrs. Verrall's script of Dec. 3, 1902.\r\nVesperavit iam ante in lumine lux fiat [i.e. Evening has\r\nalready come before ha the light let there be light.] . . .\r\nExtract from Mrs. Verrall's script of March 1, 1903.\r\n. . . largas ad lummis oras 3\r\n. . .

The re- ference has been given before 1 but I think not understood \u2014largas luminis oras.\r\nI am not proposing to consider the references in\r\nthe various scripts to \" Let there be light,\" except where\r\nthese words are combined with, or soon followed by,\r\none of the \" evening and the morning \" verses from\r\nthe first chapter of Genesis ; but in order that the reader\r\nmay be in a position to judge whether or not I have\r\ndealt fairly with* the evidence, I shall give at the end\r\nof this section a list of all the quotations in the scripts\r\nfrom the first two chapters of Genesis. It is, then, the\r\noccurrences of one or other of the \" evening and the\r\nmorning \" verses which I regard as constituting the\r\ncross-correspondence.\r\nAfter Dec. 24, 1906, more than six and a half years\r\npassed before any of these \" evening and morning \"\r\nrefrains appear again in any of the scripts. Then, on\r\nAugust 24, 1913, Mrs. Verrall's script ends with \" And\r\nthe evening and the morning were the first day.\" Next,\r\nafter an interval of nearly seven and a half months,\r\non April 6, 1914, Miss Verrall's script, which she began\r\nto write at 4.20 p.m., opened with the words \" Parvus \u2014per amicitiam\u2014luminis oras \" ; and then in the next\r\ndozen lines or so went on to refer to seven different\r\nsubjects, between none of which and \" luminis oras\r\n\" can I see any connexion. At this point the automatist\r\nwas interrupted. When she resumed at 5 p.m., she\r\nquoted first from The Blessed Damozel, next from Tennyson's Mariana, and then wrote the following : \" And\r\nthe morning and the evening were the third day. We\r\nhave got to get things through as we can and sort them\r\nout afterwards bit by bit.\"\r\nNow, in January 1914, Mss Verrall had seen for the\r\nfirst time a printed collection of all the scripts produced\r\nby Mrs. Verrall between January 1905 and May 1907.\r\n1 Namely in the script of March 1, 1903.\r\n14 J. G. Piddington. [part\r\nAmong these is the script of Dec. 24, 1906, which combines \" And the evening and the morning were the first\r\nday \" with \" luminis oras.\" It is fair to assume, therefore,\r\nthat the appearance in Miss Verrall's script of April 6,\r\n1914, of \"luminis oras\" and of \"the morning and the\r\nevening were the third day \"\u2014separated though these two\r\nphrases are by a considerable interval from each otheris due to her acquaintance with Mrs. Verrall's script\r\nof Dec. 24, 1906. Miss Verrall, in fact\u2014to use an ex- pression that Mrs. Willett has applied to similar instances\r\nof borrowing\u2014\" cribbed \" from Mrs. Verrall.\r\nNaturally, then, I do not claim the coincidence as evidence of supernormal faculty. At the same time\r\nthe fact should not escape notice that the \" crib \" was\r\nnot textual : Miss Verrall's script mentioning the third\r\nday of Creation, and not, like Mrs. Verrall's, the first. This variation from the known original is emphasised by\r\nthe very next script that Miss Verrall wrote\u2014on April 17,\r\n1914\u2014as it opens with the words : \" And the evening\r\nand the morning were the fourth day.\"\r\nNearly eight weeks passed before another \" Evening\r\nand morning \" reference occurred. Then, in close succession, came six such references in Mrs. Verrall's script, as follows\r\n:\r\nJune 11, 1914: \"And the evening and the morning were\r\nthe first day and so of all days \"\r\n; June 22, 1914: \"And the evening and the morning were\r\nthe 2nd day \"\r\n; June 26, 1914 : \" And the evening and the morning were\r\nthe third day. And there was light \"\r\n; June 27, 1914 : \" This is not an evening and a morning\r\nquite in another series \"\r\n; June 28, 1914 : \" Let there be light and the evening and\r\nthe morning were the fifth day Yes\r\nI mean what I say\u2014the fifth day \"\r\n; June 29, 1914 : \" And he rested on the 7th day\u2014Don't\r\ntry to understand these little tags\r\nfrom Genesis\u2014But each has its purpose, and I have said\u2014and you have\r\nwritten\u2014in each case what I mean.\"\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type.

M. Celey and Maxwell.\r\nThe passages in Mrs. King's script which seem to\r\ncontain these indirect or obscure allusions to the Creation\r\nare as follows :\r\nExtract from Mrs. King's script of Dec. 29, 1913.\r\n. . .

Thesewords, by themselves and without context, would notsuggest any connexion with the Creation ; but closelyfollowed, as they are, by words strongly reminiscentof a sentence in the biblical narrative of the Creation,I think it not unreasonable to see in them an allusionto a famous series of six pictures 2 by Burne-Jones called \" The Angels of Creation.\" In this series each day of\r\nthe Creation is represented by an Angel holding in his\r\nhands a luminous globe, wherein are reflected the chieffeatures of each day's creative work. At the feet ofthe Angel of the Sixth Day is seated the Angel of theSeventh Day holding, not a globe, but a harp.\r\nSo far I have passed over without comment the words\" fulmine gens,\" which come between \" the luminousglobes \" and \" He moved across the face of the waters.\"In offering an interpretation of them, I hope it will beunderstood that I do not claim for it anything morethan a certain degree of probability.\r\nThe words mean literally \" by lightning a people,\"and, as they stand, make no sense. The first time,however, that I saw them in Mrs. King's script, andlong before I saw the reference to Deukalion in her1 \" One moment more \" is an instruction to the automatist to try\r\nfor one more impression before ceasing to write.\r\n' To one of these pictures there is an allusion in Mrs. Verrall's script\r\nof Feb. 6, 1908 ; but Mrs. King has never seen this script.\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type.

I. 2 : Jam satis terris nivis atque dirae\r\nGrandinis misit Pater, et rubente\r\nDextera sacras jaculatus arces Terruit urbem,\r\nTerruit gentes, grave ne rediret\r\nSeculum Pyrrhae.\r\n(Enough of snow and dreadful hail the Father has now sent\r\nupon the earth, and, smiting with red right-hand the sacred\r\nheights, has affrighted the city, has affrighted the nations, lest the troublous age of Pyrrha should return.\"\r\nLonsdale and Lee's Translation.)\r\nHere, then, we get \"gentes\" (the plural of \"gens\");\r\nand by implication \" fulmen \" too, for, though the word\r\n\" fulmen \" is not actually used, the thing that Jupiter\r\nhurled {jaculatus) is, of course, his \" fulmen.\" Moreover,\r\nthe day after the allusion to \" the glistening globes \"\r\n\r\nwhich has every appearance of being meant as equivalent\r\nto \" the luminous globes \"\u2014comes the name \" Deukalion,\"\r\nwhich will suit with the \"Pyrrha\" of Horace's lines.\r\nIf I recall in rough outline the story of Pyrrha and\r\nher husband Deucalion, it will be clear to the reader\r\nwhy an allusion to it might appropriately be sandwiched\r\nbetween allusions to the Creation.\r\nThe impiety and vice of mankind in the Iron Age\r\nhad so angered Zeus that he determined to destroy\r\nall the inhabitants of the earth, and to create a new\r\nrace of men. He caused a great flood to overwhelm\r\nthe earth, so that the top of Mount Parnassus was the\r\nonly land not covered by the waters. The whole human\r\nrace was drowned except Deucalion and Pyrrha : a pious\r\ncouple, who had sought refuge on the heights of Parnassus. Zeus took pity on them, and for the sake of\r\ntheir uprightness and devoutness spared them, and made\r\nthe flood to abate. Realising that they were the only\r\nbeings left alive, Deucalion and Pyrrha sought counsel\r\nfrom an oracle how they might replenish the earth. The\r\noracle bade them throw the bones of their mother behind\r\nB\r\n18 G. Piddington. [part\r\ntheir backs. Pyrrha refused to do anything so disrespectful ; but Deucalion, with an ingenuity worthy of some\r\npsychical researchers, suggested that the oracle meant\r\nthe Earth by their mother, and stones of the earth\r\nby her bones ; and argued that there could anyhow be\r\nno harm in acting on this hypothesis. Accordingly they\r\ndid ; and the stones thrown by Deucalion became men,\r\nand those thrown by Pyrrha became women ; and so took place the second Creation of Man.\r\nIf, then, Mrs. King's \" fulmine gens \" and \" Deucalion \"\r\nare allusions to the opening lines of Hor. C. I. 2, they\r\nare not inappropriately combined with phrases that directly or indirectly relate to the Biblical account of the Creation\r\nof Man.\r\nI append, as promised, a list, in chronological order,\r\nof all quotations from, and phrases reminiscent of the\r\nfirst two chapters of Genesis occurring in the scripts.\r\nAgainst those which form the cross-correspondence asterisks are placed.

To the work of the sixth\r\nday the only direct reference is in Mrs. Willett's script\r\nof Dec. 3, 1911, though of course the phrase in her\r\nscript of Aug. 23, 1911\u2014\"the life of the\" Whole flowing\r\nthrough and beholding itself that it is good \"\u2014includes\r\nthe work of all six days.\r\n20 J. G. Piddington. [part\r\nNarthex.\r\nIn the last case I had occasion to draw attention\r\nto the fact that in all probability Miss Verrall \" cribbed \"\r\nthe words \" luminis oras \" from an early script of Mrs.\r\nVerrall's. By way of introduction to the present case,\r\nit will be convenient to say something further about\r\n\" cribs \" in Miss Verrall's script. Miss Verrall is, or must be assumed to be, familiar with all scripts published\r\nin our Proceedings or Journal. Moreover, between May\r\nand December, 1912, she went through Mrs. Verrall's\r\nscript from its beginning in 1901 down to the end of\r\n1904, for the purpose of translating the Greek and Latin\r\nwords, phrases and quotations that occur in it ; and in\r\nJanuary 1914, she received a copy of a printed volume\r\nof Mrs. Verrall's scripts produced between January 1905\r\nand May 1907. If she has not read all these scripts\r\nabout 500 in all\u2014she has at any rate browsed among\r\nthem. It might, accordingly, be thought that her own\r\nsubsequent scripts would exhibit a large number of \"cribs\"\r\nfrom Mrs. Verrall's scripts. But as a matter of fact\r\nthis is not so. In this paper I shall cite no script of Miss Verrall's\r\nearlier than April 11, 1913, or later than Oct. 16, 1914,\r\nas contributing to a cross-correspondence. I have gone\r\ncarefully through all her scripts between these two dates\r\nwith a view to ascertaining how many words or phrases\r\nborrowed from Mrs. Verrall's scripts they contain ; and\r\nI have succeeded in tracing only three certain \" cribs\r\n\r\nand one possible one. The possible \" crib \" is the word \" Nympholeptus,\"\r\non Aug. 7, 1913, which may be a reminiscence of the\r\nword \" nympholept \" found in Mrs. Verrall's script of\r\nJan. 23, 1903 ; but just as probably, if not more probably, a classical author or Browning's poem Numpkoleptos\r\nwas the source on which Miss Verrall drew.\r\nTwo of the certain \"cribs\" are (a) \"narthex cero- matica \" and (6) \"luminis oras\" combined with an \"evening\r\nand morning \" quotation. These two appear in successive\r\nscripts on March 31 and April b, 1914, respectively.\r\nLxxn.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 21\r\nOne, as we have seen, and the other, as will presently\r\nappear, have formed the themes of cross-correspondences.\r\nThe third certain \" crib \" occurs on Aug. 29, 1914, and, so\r\nfar as I know, is not re-echoed in the script of any of\r\nthe other automatistss\r\nStill, when I find that two out of the three certain \" cribs \" are thus re-echoed, it makes me suspect that\r\nthis \" cribbing \" is not a random process.\r\nThe way is now clear to deal with the \" Narthex\r\n\r\ncross-correspondence.\r\nThe word Narthex occurs twice\u2014and twice only\u2014in\r\nMrs. Verrall's script : for the first time on Feb. 2,\r\n1903, in the form \" cum narthece ceromatico,\" and for\r\nthe second time on Sept. 23, 1908, in the following\r\nforms :\r\nyap vapOipci KaXujUL\/uepov to irvp ih TlpofJujOevs\r\ntow av6pct)7rovs deoiaiv eoiKOTag eiroujcre.\r\nIn a narthex stem conveyed\r\nBy the god who disobeyed\r\nBroke the fate, mankind to save So gave freedom to the slave.\r\nThe Greek means \" For in a narthex was hidden the fire\r\nby which Prometheus made men like unto gods.\"\r\nNarthex is the name of some plant with a hollow\r\nstalk. It is also used of a small case or tube for holding\r\nunguents. Its best known association is with the hollow\r\nstalk in which Prometheus brought down fire from heaven\r\n;\r\nand it is in this sense that the word is used in the\r\nsecond of Mrs. Verrall's two scripts. The words \" cum\r\nnarthece ceromatico \" in her first script mean literally \" with a waxen narthex,\" and Mrs. Verrall takes this\r\nto mean \" a phial of unguent.\" The first of these two\r\nscripts\u2014that of Feb. 2, 1903\u2014has been printed and\r\ndiscussed in Proc. Vol. XX., pp. 121-123 ; the second\r\nin Proc. Vol. XXV., p. 259.\r\nMrs. Willett and Miss Verrall have read these volumes,\r\nand may therefore be assumed to be acquainted with both\r\nscripts.\r\nThe word Narthex does not occur in the scripts of\r\n22 J. G. Piddington. [part\r\nany of the other automatists until March 31, 1914, when\r\nMiss Verrall's script contains the following :\r\nnarthex\u2014what is that 1 ceromatica\u2014this is important\u2014it is wanted for completion.\r\nThen on May 2, 1914, Mrs. Willett's script has :\r\nThe divine fire in a narthex this was conveyed to the sons\r\nof men.\r\nThis, as Mrs. Willett herself recognised, is a \" crib \" from the second of Mrs. Verrall's two \" Narthex \" scripts ; while Miss Verrall's \" narthex ceromatica \" is a\r\n\" crib \"\r\nfrom the first of the two.\r\nWhy, I ask, within less than five weeks of each other,\r\ndid Miss Verrall select one and Mrs. Willett the other\r\nof the only two references to Narthex in Mrs. Verrall's\r\nscript for reproduction in their own scripts, rather than\r\nsome of the other thousands of phrases in Mrs. Verrall's\r\nscript equally known to both of them ?\r\n\" The stabs when they sang together,\"\r\nand Tennyson's \" Mariana.\"\r\nMiss Verrall's script of April 6, 1914, has already, as we have seen in the Days of Creation case, furnished\r\none cross-correspondence. But that was not the only\r\none, for it contained three other cross-correspondences ; and of these I will now proceed to render an account.\r\nIt will be remembered that on April 6, 1914, Miss\r\nVerrall was interrupted in the middle of writing her script\r\n(see p. 13). The last words she wrote before the interruption were these :\r\nSomething about music too\u2014the common chord\u2014but\r\nnot Abt Vogler\u2014this is another association.\r\nThen after the interruption she wrote :\r\nthe stars\u2014when they sang together\u2014he cometh not she\r\nsaid\u2014And the morning and the evening were the third day.\r\n\" He cometh not she said \" is from Tennyson's Mariana.\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 23\r\nThe original source of \" the stars\u2014when they sang\r\ntogether \" is, of course, Job, xxxviii. 7 : \" When the\r\nmorning stars sang together, and all the sons of God\r\nshouted for joy.\" But the words in the script \" the\r\nstars\u2014when they sang together \" are more probably\r\nderived from Rossetti's The Blessed Damozel than from\r\nJob. This will be clear if the three are placed side\r\nby side.\r\nJob. \" When the morning stars sang together \"\r\n; Rossetti. \" Her voice was like the voice the stars\r\nHad when they sang together \"\r\n; Script. \" the stars\u2014when they sang together.\"\r\nRossetti and the script both omit \" morning \" ; and\r\nboth have \" the stars when they sang together,\" whereas\r\nJob has \"When the stars sang together.\"\r\nBut although the script phrase is in my opinion nearer\r\nto Rossetti than to Job, I think that the combination of \" And the morning and the evening were the third day \"\r\nwith \" the stars\u2014when they sang together \" makes it practically certain that Job, as well as Rossetti, was\r\nin the automatist's thoughts ; for the context of \" When\r\nthe morning stars sang together \" in Job is concerned\r\nwith the Creation of the World : Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the\r\nearth ? . . . Whereupon are the foundations thereof\r\nfastened % or who laid the corner stone thereof ; When\r\nthe morning stars sang together, and all the sons of\r\nGod shouted for joy % Job, xxxvih. 4, 6, 7.\r\nThe first time that Mrs. Willett wrote automatically\r\nafter April 6, 1914\u2014the date of Miss Verrall's script\r\njust quoted\u2014was on April 12, 1914, when her script\r\ncontained the following passage :\r\nThe Blessed Damozel leans down ... In vain for hei\r\nshall seraphs harp, her eyes were deep as water stilled\r\nat even. He will come He will come.\r\nAll these phrases are taken from The Blessed Damozel,\r\nexcept \" In vain for her shall seraphs harp,\" which, I\r\n24 J. 0. Piddington. [PART\r\nsusjoect, is an intentional variation of the following lines\r\nin P. W. H.

Both scripts, then, comprise \" Blow,\r\nblow thou winter wind \" and Mariana*\r\nI say \" comprise \" rather than \" combine,\" because a number of phrases intervene in Miss Verrall's script\r\nbetween \" Blow, blow thou winter wind \" and the Mariana\r\nquotation, and there is nothing to show that they belong\r\ntogether. Moreover, the interval of time between the\r\ntwo coinciding scripts is a long one. These are weak\r\npoints in the case. Against them, however, may be set\r\nfour considerations :\r\n(1) Miss Verrall's script of April 6, 1914\u2014the one in\r\nquestion\u2014displays no less than three other instances of\r\ncross-correspondence ; (2) In this very same script \" luminis oras \" is separated\r\nfrom \" the morning and the evening were the third\r\nday \" by an even wider interval than \" blow, blow, thou\r\nwinter wind \" is from the Mariana quotation ; yet the\r\nformer pair, for reasons already given (see pp. 13-14),\r\ncertainly belong together. And in Miss Verrall's script of\r\nJan. 6, 1914, \" Festinasse lente \" is separated from\r\n\" Festina lente \" by a number of irrelevant topics ; yet\r\nthere can be no doubt that they belong together ; 1\r\n(3) The \" author \" of the script of April 6, 1914, is aware that the topics have emerged in disjointed fashion\r\nand need re-sorting, as is shown by the words : \" We\r\nhave to get things through as we can and sort them\r\nout afterwards bit by bit \"\r\n;\r\n1 As a matter of fact, there are scores of instances in Miss Verrall's script where two or more complementary phrases are widely separated\r\nfrom each other.\r\n28 -\/. G. Piddington. [part\r\n(4) The combination of topics does not seem a likely\r\none to occur by chance to two persons independently.\r\nIn Tennyson's Mariana, it is true, there are allusions\r\nto \" cold winds \" and \" wild winds \" which might suggest\r\nthe Shakespearian \" Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\" and\r\nmight the more readily do so, perhaps, because Tennyson's\r\nMariana is explicitly connected by the poet himself with\r\nSfmkespeare's Mariana. And moreover, the \"winter wind\"\r\nbeing \"not so unkind as man's ingratitude\" might suggest,\r\nthe faithlessness of Mariana's lover. But that these far\r\nfrom obvious or inevitable associations should independently\r\nsuggest themselves to two automatists is not easy of belief.\r\nTo facilitate the reader's task in following the four\r\ncases of cross-correspondence into which Miss Verrall's\r\nscript of April 6, 1914, enters, I append a copy of the\r\nwhole of it except the last two or three lines.\r\nMiss Verrall's Script of April 6, 1914.\r\n(4.20 p.m.)\r\nParvus\u2014per amicitiam\u2014luminis oras\u2014the wind in the\r\ntrees\u2014a sighing and a sobbing\u2014Poor cock Robin\u2014\r\nsaid the sparrow\u2014Be the green grass above me\r\nand here let the wind blow\r\n\r\nThe flight of the arrow\u2014Swifter far than swallow's\r\nflight\u2014the snake in the grass\r\n\r\nBlow blow thou winter wind\u2014there is an important\r\npoint in this Script\u2014it should be clear I think\r\n\r\nSomething about music too\u2014the common chord\r\nbut not Abt Vogler\u2014this is another association\r\n\r\n(Interruption.)\r\n(5 p.m.)\r\nthe stars\u2014when they sang together\u2014he cometh not\r\nshe said\r\n\r\nAnd the morning and the evening were the third\r\nday\u2014We have to get things through as we can and\r\nsort them out afterwards bit by bit.

Thus, he\r\nmight associate the original verse of the first with any\r\nline of Shelley's Remembrance. Now, some time before\r\nMrs. Willett wrote a script which I am going presently\r\nto quote, she had seen these two scripts of Miss Verrall's,\r\nand was consequently in a position to do what anyone\r\nelse who had seen them could have done : namely, to put\r\nthe contents or some of the contents of the two together.\r\nBefore, however, I quote this script of Mrs. Willett's\r\nI must first quote from a third script of Miss VerraU's,\r\nnamely, the one she wrote on April 6, 1914 : The flight of the arrow\u2014Swifter far than swallow's\r\nflight . . . the stars\u2014when they sang together. \" Swifter far than swallow's flight \" is an obvious\r\n\" portmanteau \" of two lines in Shelley's Remembrance : \" Swifter far than summer's flight,\"\r\nand\r\n\" The swallow summer comes again.\"\r\n30 J.

She said she\r\nthought it might be \" Sichaeus.\" I then suggested that\r\nwhen she next wrote automatically she should try to\r\nget the word clearly written. The result of this suggestion\r\nis seen in a script written at 6 p.m. on the same day,\r\nviz.

As regards the\r\nphrases which fall between the two writings of the name\" Sichaeus,\" it seems likely that they belong thereto.\r\nA funeral pyre had only once before been mentioned in\r\nMiss Verrall's script, or: January 24, 1908 ; and there\r\nit is explicitly associated with Dido's death.1 \" Thegrave gives up its dead \" is possibly an allusion to theapparition of Sichaeus when he warned Dido to fly fromPygmalion ; but, if so, it can hardly be called a happyone, because Vergil speaks of the ghost of Dido's unburiedhusband.\r\nWith regard to \"a labyrinth of flowers \" \u2014a phrase1 See Vergil, Aen. iv. 502 and 504, for references in close sequence\r\nto the death of Sichaeus and to Dido's funeral pyre.\r\na festival\u2014to hold high festival in the Court\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 33\r\nthat is probably taken from a poem of W. de la Mare's \u2014Mrs. Verrall has suggested to me that it is an attempt\r\nto allude to Aen. rv. 504-507 : \" But the Queen, when the pyre is built up of\r\npiled faggots and cleft ilex in the inmost of her\r\ndwelling, hangs the room with chaplets and garlands\r\nit with funeral boughs..\"\r\n\" To hold high festival in the court of Dis \" may\r\nreflect the scene described in 11. 509-511 :\r\n\" Altars are reared around, and the priestess, with\r\nhair undone, thrice peals from her lips the hundred\r\ngods of Erebus and Chaos, and the triform Hecate,\r\nthe triple-faced maidenhood of Diana.\"\r\n(Mackail's Translation.)\r\nThere remain the words \" ante ora \" to explain. They\r\nmean \" before the eyes \" or \" before the faces.\" They\r\nhad never occurred before in Miss Verrall's script ; and\r\nthey have occurred only once since, namely, in her script\r\nof Dec. 17, 1914, in the following context :\r\n\" Sic fatur lacrimans\u2014ante ora parentum.\"\r\nFor a reason given on p. 37 below, it is quite certain\r\nthat \" ante ora parentum \" here is an expansion, and\r\nso an explanation, of the \" ante ora \" of the earlier\r\nscript. The connexion of \" ante ora \" with Sichaeus\r\nand of \" ante ora parentum \" with the Vergilian phrase\r\n\" Sic fatur lacrimans \" indicates that the source of \" ante\r\nora parentum \" is to be sought in Vergil's Aeneid.\r\n\"Ante ora parentum\" occurs twice only in the Aeneid : 1\r\nfirst of the Trojan boys defiling on horseback \" before\r\ntheir parents' eyes \" at the Funeral Games in honour\r\nof Anchises (Aen. v. 553) ; secondly, of those young men\r\nand maidens laid on funeral piles \" before their parents'\r\neyes \" whose ghosts form part of the crowd that swarms\r\nround Charon's boat (Aen. vi. 308).\r\n1 \" Ante oculos evasit et ora parentum \" in Aen. n. 531, and \" Exclusi\r\nante oculos lacrimantumque ora parentum \" in Aen. xi. 887, need\r\nnot be considered on account of the separation of \" ante \" from \" ora\r\n\"\r\nin each case.\r\n34 J. 0. Piddington. [part\r\nThat it is the latter that is meant is practically certain\r\nfor two reasons : namely, that it is one of the best\r\nknown passages in the Aeneid, and that \" Sic fatur\r\nlacrimans,\" 1 found once only in the Aeneid, are the\r\nopening words of the Sixth Book. The passage is as\r\nfollows :\"Hue omnis turba ad ripas effusa ruebat,\r\nMatres atque viri, defunctaque corpora vita\r\nMagnanimum heroum, pueri innuptaeque puellae\r\nInpositique rogis iuvenes ante ora parentum.\" 2\r\n\" Hither all crowded, and rushed streaming to the\r\nbank, matrons and men, and high-hearted heroes dead and\r\ndone with life, boys and unwedded girls, and youths and\r\nmaidens laid on the funeral pile before their parents' eyes.\"\r\n\" Ante ora \" in the script of April 23, 1914, seems,\r\nthen, to emphasise \" a funeral pyre \" (i.e. Dido's funeral\r\npyre) ; and the intention of the emphasis thus thrown\r\nmay have been to point to the words spoken by Dido,\r\nwhen, having cast herself upon the funeral pile, she is about to stab herself with the sword of Aeneas :\r\n\" And now shall I go a queenly phantom under\r\nthe earth. \/ have built a renowned city ; \/ have\r\nseen my ramparts rise ; by my brother's [Pygmalion's]\r\npunishment I have avenged my husband [Sichaeus]\r\nof his enemy.\" (Aen. iv. 654-656.)\r\nThese words spoken by Dido at the point of death\r\nbring us back to the subject of Mrs. Verrall's script of\r\nAug. 5, 1913 : the founding of the city of Carthage\r\nby Dido after she had fled from her brother's court\r\nat the instigation of the ghost of Sichaeus.3\r\n1 \" Sic fatur lacrimans \" (\" So speaks he weeping \") refers to Aeneas'\r\napostrophe to his drowned pilot Palinurus, whom he afterwards meets\r\namong the crowd of unburied dead that flocks to the banks of Cocytus\r\nand pleads with Charon to be ferried across. There is, therefore, a\r\nfairly direct association of ideas between \"sic fatur lacrimans\" and\r\n\"ante ora parentum.\"\r\n2 The last three lines are repeated from Oeorg. iv. 475-477.\r\n3 Though I believe this explanation is correct so far as it goes, I suspect that there may be other reasons besides for the conjunction of\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 35\r\nThe third and last reference to the story of Dido and\r\nSichaeus occurs in Mrs. Willett's script.

Tor the success of\r\nDido's enterprise was largely due to her possession of\r\nthe secret hoard of gold which the ghost of Sichaeus\r\ntold her of : \" Then he [Sichaeus] counsels hasty flight\r\n. . . and to aid her passage discloses treasures long\r\nhidden underground, an untold mass of silver and gold. . . . They seize on ships that chance to lie ready, and load\r\nthem with the gold. Pygmalion's hoarded wealth is borne overseas ; a woman guides the enterprise [Dux\r\nfemina facti].\"\r\nNot only did gold make the enterprise practicable,\r\nbut Vergil calls Carthage \" dives opum \" and makes\r\nfrequent and marked references to the gold with which\r\nthe royal palace and Dido's person were adorned.

I. 348-350.)\r\nLXXil.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 37\r\nI had suggested further that the substitution of \" ora\r\n\"\r\nin the script for \" aras \" was traceable to the vicinity\r\nof the words \" ora \" and \" aras \" in the immediate\r\ncontext of \" ante aras.\"\r\n\"Ipsa sed in somnis inhumati venit imago\r\nConjugis, ora modis attollens pallida miris ; Crudelis aras traiectaque pectora ferro\r\nNudavit.\" {Am. I. 353-356.)\r\nOn Dec. 11, 1914, when I told Miss Verrall about this\r\ncross-correspondence,1 I mentioned my conjectural explanation of \" ante ora \" ; and she thought it not improbable.\r\nHer script, however, thought otherwise ; for the appear- ance in it on Dec. 17, 1914, of the words\r\n\" Sic fatur lacrimans\u2014ante ora parentum,\"\r\ncertainly implies the rejection of my conjectural emendation ; and seems to give the right, and certainly gives a simpler, explanation of \" ante ora.\"\r\nThis script of Dec. 17, 1914, was written at 5.40 p.m.,\r\nand I received it by the first post on Dec. 18.\r\nBy the first post on the next day, Dec. 19, 1914, I\r\nreceived a script of Mrs. Verrall's written on Dec. 17,\r\nat 10.20 p.m. : that is 4 hours and 40 minutes later than\r\nMiss VerralFs script containing the words\r\n\" Sic fatur lacrimans\u2014ante ora parentum.\"\r\nThis script of Mrs. Verrall's ran as follows :\r\nI dont think I can get tonight the message that is wanted\u2014but yon might try.\r\nBy their fruits ye shall know them You need not\r\nsend more to Piddington than that and just this word\r\n\r\nthat I was amused to see him in the light of the electric\r\nlamp the other day struggling with the lexicon\u2014its not\r\nthere he will get the clue he wants\u2014Tell him it is quite\r\nplain in Helen's recent script and I think that he will\r\nmake it out That will do.\r\n1 1 had mentioned the bare fact of there being a cross-correspondence on the subject of Sichaeus to Miss Verrall first on Nov. 27, 1914, but\r\ngave her no details until Dec. 11, 1914.\r\n:;s G.

[part\r\nAfter reading this script I noted down that during\r\nthe previous two or three weeks I had \" struggled with\r\nthe lexicon \" over three points, all connected with Miss\r\nVerrall's script :\r\n(a) I had looked through all the references in Lewis\r\nand Short's Latin Dictionary under the words \" o,\" \"si,\"\r\nand \" sic,\" in a vain endeavour to find whether there\r\nis any classical authority for \" o si sic omnes \" : a variation of the well-known phrase \" o si sic omnia \" that\r\nhas appeared four times in Miss Verrall's script and once\r\nin Mrs. Verrall's ; (b) I had looked up the words, inrepTUTos, Opovos,\r\na-rpw\/xa and <TTpw\/uLi>}] in Liddell and Scott in the hope\r\nof tracing the source of a phrase in a script of Miss\r\nVerrall's containing these Greek words ; and\r\n(c) I had looked through all the references in Lewis\r\nand Short under \" ante \" and \" os \" in the hope of\r\nfinding the words \" ante ora \" in a context which would\r\nexplain their conjunction with \" Sichaeus \" in Miss Verrall's\r\nscript of April 23, 1914.\r\nIt was the last of these three subjects that had engaged\r\nmy attention the most : the first two had interested me\r\nonly in a small degree.\r\nIf the statements made in Mrs. Verrall's script of\r\nDec. 17, 1914, are referred to the facts given under (c),\r\nthey fit them uncommonly well. I cannot, of course, say\r\nwhether the communicator was amused ; but it is true\r\nthat I struggled with the lexicon, that I did not find\r\nin the lexicon the clue I wanted, that a clue of the\r\nkind I wanted had been plainly given in Miss Verrall's\r\nrecent script, and that I did \" make it out.\" I cannot\r\nswear that when I looked through the passages quoted under\r\n\" ante \" and \" os \" I was working by electric light ; but I\r\nbelieve that I was. Pine Trees.\r\nAccording to Dr. Hyslop 1 we have been criticised of\r\nlate for displaying a predilection for material which\r\n1 Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, September,\r\n1914, p. 414\r\nlxxii.] Gross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 39\r\npermits us to \" air our classical knowledge.\" Dr. Hyslop\r\ndoes not say whether he himself endorses this kindly\r\nestimate of our motives ; but, as I am afraid he may\r\ndo so, I shall not again in this paper venture to select a\r\ncase of cross-correspondence, like the last, involving an\r\nexpedition into that mysterious region of human lore,\r\nthe classics. So I must content myself with taking for\r\nmy next and last example a case which will not lead\r\nus beyond the borders of our own literature, but which\r\nwill yet have the advantage of permitting me to air a knowledge of Ruskin : \u2014a knowledge that, I hope, will\r\nnot impress my readers the less because it has been crammed\r\nfor the occasion.\r\nTwo automatists only, Mrs. Whlett and Miss Verrall, are concerned in this case. On June 15, 1914, Mrs. Willett's script contained the\r\nfollowing passage :\r\na great pine and the Pine trees that march in gallant\r\ncompanies up the mountain side the Morning [sic] Glory\r\nRuskin wrote of it.\r\nMrs. Willett's own contemporaneous note on it is\r\n:\r\n\" I take this to refer to the 7th paragraph of Ruskin's\r\nchapter on ' Mountain Glory ' in Modem Painters :\r\n' climbing hand in hand among the difficult slopes,'\r\n' gliding in grave procession over the heavenward ridges.' \" But I had better quote more extensively from this paragraph of the chapter on The Mountain Glory than Mrs. Willett\r\nhas done. Ruskin is arguing that trees are seen to greater\r\nadvantage in mountainous country than in plains ; \" For,\" says he, \" the resources of trees are not developed until they have difficulty to contend with ; neither\r\ntheir tenderness of brotherly love and harmony, till they\r\nare forced to choose their ways of various life where\r\nthere is contracted room for them. . . .\r\n. . .

He in a way reverses the\r\nmetaphor of the blind man at Bethsaida who saw \" men as\r\ntrees, walking \", and speaks of \" trees as men, walking \". Mrs. Willett connects pine trees with this passage from\r\nThe Mountain Glory. Explicitly Ruskin does not ; but,\r\nconsidering that he is here particularly treating of Swiss\r\nmountain scenery, and that Modern Painters is rich in\r\nreferences to pines (for which Ruskin had a great affection),\r\nwe can hardly doubt that he had pines\u2014even, perhaps,\r\nrather specially\u2014in mind when writing this passage.1 Not\r\nindeed, that it matters, so far as the cross-correspondence\r\nis concerned, whether he had or not ; because Mrs. Willett's\r\nscript at any rate definitely associates pine trees with the\r\nRuskinian passage.\r\nSo much, then, for Mrs. Willett's script. But before\r\nI give Miss Verrall's contribution to the cross-correspondence, I first want to quote, for a purpose which will\r\nsoon be plain, a short extract from another of the chapters\r\non Mountains in the fourth volume of Modem Painters.\r\nIt is the closing passage of the chapter \" On the Sculpture\r\nof Mountains.\" 2\r\n1 Yet, in another passage in Modern Painters (Vol. IV. Ch. XI., \u00a7 9)\r\ndevoted to pines, Ruskin lays stress on their immobility : \" all along\r\nits ridges stand the dark masses of innumerable pines . . . asserting\r\nthemselves for ever as fixed shadows . . . fallen flakes and fragments\r\nof the night, stayed in their solemn squares in the midst of all the\r\nbendings of the orchard boughs.\"\r\nWith particular reference to this passage Ruskin himself wrote : \" Almost the only pleasure I have, myself, in re-reading my old books,\r\nis my sense of having at least done justice to the pine.\"\r\n2 The last thirteen chapters of the fourth volume of Modern Painters\r\nare all on the subject of Mountains. The first four are named \" Of\r\nthe Materials of Mountains,\" the next two \" Of the Sculpture of Mountains,\" the next five \" Resulting Forms,\" and then next and\r\nlast come \" The Mountain Gloom \" and \" The Mountain Glory.\"\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 1 I\r\nThe rock stands forth in its white and rugged mystery,\r\nas if its peak had been born out of the blue sky.

[part\r\nNow can anyone\u2014even Dr. Maxwell\u2014suppose that a\r\nliterary parallel so exact and felicitous, and yet so far\r\nfrom commonplace, occurs by chance in scripts produced\r\nby independent writers within an interval of only three\r\ndays ? Preceding the quotation from The Flight of the Duchess\r\nin Miss Verrall's script is \" The mountains shall skip.\"\r\nThough personally I have little doubt that these words\r\nreflect the quotation from the HUh Psalm with which\r\nRuskin ends his chapter \" On the Sculpture of Mountains,\"\r\nI will not lay much stress on this subsidiary coincidence,\r\nfor fear lest I quench some tiny spark of faith that\r\nthe central coincidence may kindle in Dr. Maxwell's breast.\r\nBut I do claim two things for this combination in Miss\r\nVerrall's script of \" the mountains shall skip \" with the\r\nquotation from The Flight of the- Duchess : First, it links together mountains and pines, and so accentuates the coincidence with Mrs. Willett's connexion\r\nof pines with Ruskin's passage on mountain trees.\r\nSecondly, it makes the first of two examples in Miss\r\nVerrall's script of the attribution to inanimate things\r\n(i.e. mountains and pines) of locomotory powers (i.e.\r\nskipping and climbing) ; and so supplements the coincidence with the Ruskin passage referred to by Mrs. Willett,\r\nwhere exactly the same kind of metaphor is employed.\r\nAfter quoting \" Ours is a great wild country \" Miss\r\nVerrall's script goes on to say : \" We have spoken before\r\nof the Flight of the Duchess. I do not think it has been\r\nclearly understood.\"\r\nThese words probably refer in part to the following\r\npassage in Miss Verrall's script of Feb. 26, 1912 :\r\nThe flight of the Duchess there is a quotation from it which I have given elsewhere.\r\nThe only quotation from The Flight of the Duchess\r\nbesides \" Ours is a great wild country \" that has beentraced in any of the scripts is one-\u2014quite unconnected,\r\nby the way, with pines or the \" great, wild country \" \u2014in Mrs. King's script of November 25, 1913. Obviously\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 43\r\nMiss Verrall's script of Feb. 26, 1912, is not referring to a script written 21 months later. To what then does\r\nit refer ? I suspect that a trace of the quotation from The\r\nFlight of the Duchess that \" has been given elsewhere \" and \" not clearly understood \" is to be found in Mrs.\r\nHolland's script of Oct. 13, 1909, which opens thus : \" The pines drawn up as if in battle array.\"\r\nThis is not a quotation from the poem, but it may have\r\nbeen suggested by an imperfect recollection of the lines : \" One by one, row after row,\r\nUp and up the pine-trees go.\"\r\nThis script of Mrs. Holland's had not been seen by\r\nMiss Verrall, who gives the quotation about the pine-trees\r\nfrom the poem. It had been seen by Mrs. Willett, who,\r\nhowever, connects her reference to pine-trees not with\r\nThe Flight of the Duchess but with Ruskin's Modern\r\nPainters. At the same time I think it probable that\r\nthe peculiar military turn given by Mrs. Willett to her\r\nreminiscence of the passage in Modern Painters was due\r\nto her recollection of Mrs. Holland's \" The pines drawn\r\nup as if in battle array.\" Thus, while Ruskin speaks of \" companies \" he does not speak, as does Mrs. Willett, of \" gallant companies \" ; and though he speaks of the trees \" climbing \" and \" gathering into companies,\" he does not\r\nmake them \" march,\" as does Mrs. Willett. But even if\r\nit be true that Mrs. Willett's script was influenced by\r\nMrs. Holland's, this does not in the slightest degree help\r\nto explain the coincidences between Mrs. Willett's and\r\nMiss Verrall's scripts of June 15 and 18, 1914, respectively.\r\nA critical reader may like to know how many references\r\nto pine-trees there are in the scripts, and of what character\r\nthey are. Exclusive of the references already cited,\r\npines are mentioned nine times in Miss Verrall's script\r\nbetween 1903 and 1914 ; eight times in Mrs. Verrall's\r\nscript between 1901 and 1914 ; 1 twice in Mrs. Holland's\r\n1 This includes two mentions of \" conifera arbos \" which may, or may\r\nnot, be a pine-tree.\r\nJ.

Mrs. Holland's first mention of a\r\npine, \" A screw pine stood like a sentinel,\" introduces a martial metaphor, as does \" The pines drawn up as\r\nif in battle array \" in her script of Oct. 13, 1909 ; but\r\nit should be noted that in each case Mrs. Holland's\r\npines are stationary and do not march like Mrs. Willett's, or climb like Browning's pines and Ruskin's mountain\r\ntrees.\r\nThere are besides a few references to Fir-trees in the\r\nscripts. These I have examined carefully with a view\r\nto estimating whether they could be supposed, had Miss\r\nVerrall or Mrs. Willett seen them, to have suggested to\r\nthem the passages in The Flight of the Duchess and in\r\nThe Mountain Glory. I have failed to find among them\r\nany which seem in the slightest degree likely to have\r\nprompted a recollection of either the Buskin or the\r\nBrowning passage.\r\nConclusion.\r\nHere it will be safer for me to stop ; for the last\r\ntwo cases have, perhaps, gone rather near the border-line\r\nthat divides the simple from the complex\u2014the light\r\nfrom the darkness ; and, were I to continue, the old\r\nlxxii.] Cross-Correspondences of a Gallic Type. 45\r\nAdam might, I fear, gain the upper hand and\u2014against\r\nmy newly-acquired better instincts\u2014force me once again\r\nalong the path that leads, indeed, through a Slough of\r\nDespond, but, alas ! to no Wicket Gate.

[part\r\nII.\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.\r\nDelivered on July 9th, 1915.\r\nBy Professor Gilbert Murray, LL.D., Litt.D.\r\nWhen I chose as the subject of this address \" The Fringe\r\nof Consciousness,\" I had not read the discourse given\r\nto the Society two years ago by a President whom I\r\nfeel myself particularly unworthy to follow. But I find\r\nnow that M. Bergson has not only used almost the same\r\nlanguage that I was proposing to use, but has, in the\r\ncourse of his far deeper and more philosophic paper,\r\nthrown out certain suggestions which lead almost directly\r\nto the line of inquiry which I wish to put before you.\r\nI will start by two quotations from M. Bergson's address : \" If telepathy is a real fact, it is very possible that\r\nit is operating at every moment and everywhere, but\r\nwith too little intensity to be noticed, or else it is operating in the presence of obstacles which neutralize the\r\neffect at the same moment that it manifests itself. We\r\nproduce electricity at every moment, the atmosphere\r\nis continually electrified, we move among magnetic cur- rents ; yet millions of human beings lived for thousands\r\nof years without having suspected the existence of electricity. It may be the same with telepathy.\"\r\nThe second quotation comes after a discussion of the\r\nwork performed by the brain in limiting and defining\r\nand, as M. Bergson puts it, \" canalizing \" the life of\r\nthe mind by selecting for conscious remembrance certain\r\nLXXII.] Presidential Address. 47\r\nexperiences and rejecting others. He proceeds to say\r\nthe same of sense-perception, using, as he often does,\r\nthe technical language of Aristotle : \" I think that we perceive virtually (cWa\/xet) many\r\nmore things than we perceive actually (epycp), and that\r\nhere once more the part that our body plays is that\r\nof shutting out from the field of our consciousness all that is of no practical interest to us. . . . The sense\r\norgans, the sensory nerves, the cerebral centres, canalize\r\nthe influences from without, and thus mark the various\r\ndirections in which our own influence can be exercised.\r\nBut in doing so they narrow the field of our vision of\r\nthe present, just as the cerebral mechanisms of memory\r\nlimit our vision of the past. Now, just as certain useless\r\nmemories, or ' dream ' memories, may slip into the\r\nfield of consciousness, availing themselves of a moment\r\nof inattention to life, may there not be around our normal\r\nperception a fringe of -perceptions, most often unconscious\r\nbut all ready to enter into consciousness, and in fact entering in in certain exceptional cases or in certain predisposed subjects ? If there are perceptions of this kind,\"\r\nthe philosopher proceeds to recommend to this society\r\nthe study of them, and it is that particular study about\r\nwhich I ask permission to speak to you to-day.\r\nAnd here let me explain the plot of my address and\r\nat the same time make some very necessary apologies.\r\nWhen the Society did me the high honour of electing\r\nme to be its President, my first intention was to make\r\na thorough study of the publications of the last few\r\nyears and try to estimate the actual advance of knowledge which your patient and systematic researches have\r\nachieved. I have no doubt whatever that the advance\r\nis there ; that some questions really have been answered,\r\nand that now, in 1915, we face a number of important\r\npsychological problems from a standpoint very different\r\nfrom that of 1895. But the War has upset everybody's\r\ncalculations ; and I soon found that I should not have\r\nthe time for any proper research into the literature of\r\nthe subject, nor the leisure of mind to form a judgment\r\non a number of difficult questions which were bound\r\n1\r\n48 Professor Gilbert Murray. [partto present themselves. Consequently I have fallen backon a subject which was ready in my mind. It is notan ambitious subject ; yet, I regret to say, it is opento two quite particular objections. It is in the first place egotistic, and will land me in frequently talkingabout myself. Secondly, it is largely based on evidenceof the most unimpressive kind \u2014to wit, that of first handexperience without documents. I remember Sir F. Burnandobserves in Happy Thoughts that if a man told youhe had seen a ghost you very properly disbelieved him ; but if he told you that he had a friend, a man of thehighest character, who had under a seal of secrecy confided to him a document in which he described howhe had seen a ghost, you could not help being impressed.Now I have never seen a ghost, nor could I earn eventhe meagrest and most precarious livelihood as a medium ; but I have long been interested in the sort of phenomenathat we generally class under the head of telepathy,\r\nand have had a good deal of success now and thenin small telepathic experiments. And I feel that if I\r\ncould refer to my experiences as \" the Case of Mr. X . . . (a gentleman personally known to me), printed in volume140 of the Proceedings \" of this or some other Society,\r\nthey would be far more impressive than if I merelytell you what happened.\r\nHowever that may be, the line of argument which I\r\nwish to lay before you, and which is based on a fair\r\namount of thought and attention throughout a numberof years, will be one that is familiar to most of you : that, as M. Bergson suggests, the action of what wecall telepathy is habitual in ordinary human intercourse.\r\nAnd secondly, that in essence it consists in nothing moremysterious than the action on the mind of sense-impressions which are too faint to establish themselves,\r\nas sense-impressions, above the threshold of consciousness.\r\nThe action or the knowledge of the good telepathic \" medium \" is in fact simply based on that \" fringe of\r\nperceptions, most often unconscious but ready to enter\r\ninto consciousness \" of which M. Bergson speaks. I mayhowever wish to extend that fringe rather widely.\r\nLXXH.] Presidential Address. 49\r\nNow I suppose it is beyond dispute that, at any moment, the conscious experience of any person, the \" stream\r\nof consciousness,\" as William James calls it, has a vivid\r\ncentre and dim edges, gradually passing into the imperceptible. If you cut a section across the stream of\r\nconsciousness that is what you would find : a focus\r\nof attention, vivid and strong, and shading gradually\r\naway from it a rather wide field of experience, conscious,\r\nsub-conscious and eventually not conscious at all. This\r\nis seen at its simplest if we take one sense at a time.\r\nMedical men may judge of a patient's health, for instance,\r\nby the range of his field of vision. The patient looks\r\nat a focus straight in front, but has some dim vision\r\nof objects held about 80 degrees to either side. The\r\nsize of the field is said to vary according to the patient's\r\nmental vigour ; it seems also to vary inversely with the\r\nintensity of one's attention. At least, I should say that,\r\nwhen not particularly interested in anything, I am often\r\nconscious of things outside the rims of my spectacles ; but if interested in the object I am looking at, I am\r\nnot conscious of anything outside the direct line of vision.\r\nThe case is even clearer with the sense of hearing. If\r\nyou stand still in Trafalgar Square at mid-day and try\r\nto count all the continuous sounds which are impinging\r\non your ear, drowning one another and slipping in between\r\none another, and diverting your attention now this way\r\nand now that, you cannot but realize the extraordinarily\r\nwide field from which you are at any moment selecting\r\nthe sound which you mean to attend to. For of course\r\nit need not be the loudest. An abnormal crash will\r\nno doubt always attract attention ; but normally, if amid all the whistling of trains and roar of traffic somebody speaks to you by name, you will probably attend\r\nat once to the slighter sound and become barely conscious\r\nof the noises. In normal healthy life the sound which\r\nyou attend to will be chosen, as M. Bergson says, for\r\nits significance, its practical relation to life. A Red\r\nIndian surrounded by the noises of a camp full of horses\r\nand the roar of a waterfall would, so the stories used\r\nto tell us, start to attention instantly at the cracking\r\nD\r\n50 Professor Gilbert Murray. [part\r\nof a twig which might betoken the approach of an enemy.\r\nA nurse in a sick room will sleep peacefully through\r\nany amount of ordinary noise, but will wake if the patient moves. This is a power, a definite increase of mental\r\ncapacity, made by the process of selection or \" canalization.\" But if the mental life is a little out of gear or\r\ndisjointed, you will find people attending to the wrongthings. I have heard of a lady who, while receiving a proposal of marriage, could not hear her suitor's words\r\nbecause his watch ticked so loud that she could attend\r\nto nothing else. This is akin to what M. Bergson calls \" inattention to life.\" The process of selection has gone\r\nwrong.\r\nIt may seem odd that the sense-impression to which\r\none attends should be not the strongest but merely\r\nwhat one calls \" the most significant.\" But of course the whole problem of attention is a difficult one ; and\r\nI think it quite likely that if you take into account\r\nnot the isolated sense-stimulus but the whole psychic\r\ndisturbance, the result will come out that one does attend\r\nto the sight, or sound, or whatever it is, that causes the most psychic disturbance. That is, the significant\r\nsound does not produce more auditory disturbance than\r\nother sounds, yet it does produce greater psychic\r\ndisturbance on the whole. The nurse who hears the\r\npatient move, the Indian who hears the twig snap, is really receiving an extremely exciting sense-impression,\r\nas a whole, though only hearing a slight sound. One\r\ncould easily extend these examples to the other senses,\r\ntouch and taste and very decidedly smell. One is always\r\nreceiving a vast number of sense-impressions and selecting a very few of them to attend to. Hitherto we have only considered impressions which,\r\nwhether attended to or not, were at least of the normal\r\nstrength necessary for reaching the human consciousness.\r\nNow let us extend our range a little. People with\r\nspecial sensitiveness or in special conditions of attention\r\ncan become conscious of impressions well below the\r\nstrength that is normally necessary. We can find simple\r\ncases of hyperesthesia, especially in the sense of sound.\r\nLXXII.] Presidential Address. 51\r\nI knew a lady who, during an illness, could hear the\r\ndoctor's carriage pass along a certain road at a distance\r\nwhich made ordinary hearing impossible. Another who\r\ncould often tell by the smell of a ribbon whether\r\nit had ever been worn and which of several people had\r\nworn it. In such cases, we observe that the sense is abnormally acute, and therefore the extremely faint\r\nsense-impression is, as far as we can judge, consciously\r\nreceived as a sense-impression, a sound or a smell. Now\r\nlet us go a little further still towards the outer fringe.\r\nThere are cases where a sense-impression or a memory\r\nof some experience is too faint to come up into consciousness itself, but yet able to produce the same, or\r\npractically the same, result which it would have produced if fully received into consciousness. The point\r\nis important and a little difficult. In a previous case we noticed that, amid a great confusion of sounds, a\r\nparticular significant sound, though comparatively low,\r\nwas able to seize the attention. But the sound we\r\nthought of was definitely audible, though faint. Similarly,\r\nin a case of hyperesthesia the sound, though fainter still,\r\nis yet audible to that particularly sensitive person. But\r\nnow I am supposing a sound \u2014or any sense-impression\r\n\r\nwhich is too faint to be consciously perceived at all, yet the\r\ninfinitesimal disturbance which it makes sets going some\r\nother disturbance which may be quite large and important.\r\nI omit mere cases of reflex action, where, for example,\r\njrou draw your foot back from the fire because it is too hot, without noticing either that it was hot or that\r\nyou have moved it. I will consider only voluntary\r\nactions. But we can take a gradation of cases. First,\r\nincidents of ordinary life, so common and unimportant\r\nas to be generally neglected. Next, instances where\r\nthe sense, or the general mental responsiveness, of the\r\nagent has been specially sharpened by professional training or practice or need ; and lastly, cases which most\r\npeople would be inclined to regard as abnormal.\r\nIn ordinary life an incident like this is quite common.\r\nIn a concourse of people, while you are talking, somebody in another part of the room calls you or mentions\r\n52 Professor Gilbert Murray. [part\r\nyour name. You do not consciously hear the namebut you turn and give attention. I have several times\r\nnoticed a variant of this \u2014You suddenly find yourself\r\nlistening to the conversation of a particular group and\r\nthen discover that they are speaking of something that\r\nspecially interests you. This almost certainly means\r\nthat you sub-consciously overheard some fragments of\r\nthe conversation, and, without the words heard ever\r\nfully getting into your consciousness, acted upon the\r\nstimulus which they applied.\r\nExamples of professional hyperesthesia, or at least\r\nof specially acute responsiveness, are as common as\r\nblackberries. Fishermen, hunters, scientific investigators are all apt to display it, as well as trained nurses. The\r\nonly question is whether it works in cases where the\r\nsense-impression is not consciously received at all. I\r\nhave no good instance to give ; but I have frequently\r\nheard both from nurses and doctors that a good nurse\r\nwill often act on a sense-stimulus which she has not\r\nconsciously perceived. If asleep she will wake, if in\r\nanother part of the ward she will come, to find that\r\nthe sound of the patient's breathing has changed, or that he has moved into an unsuitable position or the\r\nlike. The account she will give of it may be simply : \" I thought I had better have a look at you,\" or \" I\r\njust wondered if you were comfortable.\" But the probability is that her trained ear was attending all the\r\ntime to a sharply selected complex of sounds, all of them\r\nsignificant. Then a changed sound occurred which qua\r\nsensible sound was not strong enough to force its wayinto consciousness, but qua significant information, if I may so speak, was enough to wake her and makeher move.\r\nLet us now turn to cases which would generally be\r\nclassed as abnormal and attributed to clairvoyance or\r\nsecond-sight. And first we will take the simple class\r\nof case in which the percipient acts without any hallucinations or fictitious machinery.\r\nI met recently a Scotch lady engaged in some responsible work which necessitates her taking stock every\r\nLXXII.] Presidential Address. 53\r\nweek or fortnight and making sure that of a huge number\r\nof small objects and papers none have been lost. She\r\nsays that she can generally tell, when some object is missed, whether it is really lost or is going to turn up,\r\nand her companions seem to recognize the power. This,\r\nI should think, was a case of unconscious observation\r\nand memory. Her memory of what has happened to\r\npaper 5009 is too weak to enable her to say where it\r\nis, but strong enough to make her feel a sort of assurance about it. If she were a less sensible woman a Voice\r\nfrom Heaven would confirm that assurance. I will venture\r\nto add here an experience of my own which is possibly\r\nof the same character. In a house where we once lived\r\nthere was a high hall and a lamp suspended by a long\r\nchain from the ceiling. One day I came in, not in any\r\nway thinking of the lamp, walked past the lamp and\r\nwas going upstairs, when it suddenly struck me that\r\nthe chain was going to break and the lamp to fall. The\r\nfeeling was strong enough to make me go downstairs\r\nand reach up to feel the lamp. I lifted it slightly in\r\nmy hand and let it down again, and as I did so the\r\nchain broke and the lamp came into my hand. It seems\r\nprobable that I had sub-consciously observed something\r\nabout the chain\u2014I do not in the least know what\r\n\r\nwhich led me to conclude that it was likely to break.\r\nThe original stimulus was not strong enough to get into\r\nfull consciousness, but the deduction drawn from it, being\r\nrather alarming, was. I had about the same time a very similar experience about a swing. I suddenly began\r\nto think it was going to break, and it did.\r\nNow, in making these confessions or boasts\u2014and I\r\nam intending to make some more presently\u2014I am filled\r\nwith a natural sense of shame. That I admit. Yet\r\nmy shame is mingled with some lurking spirit of defiance.\r\nIt is very easy to condemn me, when I have been found\r\nout ; but I do not believe that other people are really\r\nquite so innocent as they pretend. I suspect that most\r\nsensible persons, when they have experiences like this,\r\npromptly forget them. Their well-formed brain performs\r\nits duty and effectively walls off the recollection of such\r\n54 Professor Gilbert Hurray. [part\r\nundesirable incidents. And then they give themselves\r\nairs and despise the supposed delusions of their more\r\ncandid neighbours ! At the same time I would like to plead in mitigation\r\nof any sentence you may be passing on me, that, whatever small acts of petty clairvoyance may be laid to mycharge, I have never condescended to a hallucination.\r\nI have never heard Voices or seen Visions. Now here\r\nis a case which shows what I might have done and did\r\nnot. It is given by Mr. Archer in his paper in M'-Clure's\r\nMagazine of January, 1915, \" Can We Foretell the Future ? \"\r\n\" A steam yacht was lying moored by two ropes to a wharf in the Norfolk Broads. One of the two friends\r\nwho had chartered her had a very detailed and vivid\r\ndream of two aerial figures burning away the mooring\r\nropes, so that the steamer drifted and was lost on the\r\nriver bar. The dreamer was incapable of moving for\r\nsome time, but at last dashed out of his berth, smashed\r\nopen the bolted cabin door, and was just in time to save the vessel, both ropes having actually parted.\"\r\nWe may assume, in all probability, that he had some\r\nunconscious sense-impression\u2014he heard the ropes creak\r\nor felt them give\u2014which indicated the danger ; and his\r\nsubconsciousness, not knowing how it had got its information, dreamed a sort of mythological groundwork\r\nfor it. Such a proceeding is very common in dreams.\r\nFor my own part I would never have condescended to\r\nit. If I had been that man I should have woken up,\r\nhave felt a suspicion that the ropes were parting, and\r\nthen lain quietly in my bed until I was drowned and\r\nproved right.\r\nThe more showy and intemperate method pursued by\r\nthis unnamed gentleman has of course attracted a great\r\ndeal of attention and even exercised some influence on\r\npublic history.\r\nThe subject, having made a discovery or reached a conclusion by means of some unconscious mental process \u2014whether sense-perception or memory or something far\r\nmore complex\u2014instead of leaving well alone invents some\r\nfictitious machinery to fortify the belief or emotion at\r\nLXXII.] Presidential Address. 55\r\nwhich he has now arrived. The internal process, whatever it may have been, is projected into a mythological\r\nshape. The form of the projection is, of course, determined by the habits of thought to which the subject\r\nis accustomed. Ancient armies in certain crises of emotion,\r\nwhen they reached a sudden feeling of confidence which\r\nthey could not explain, generally saw the brethren Castor\r\nand Pollux championing them ; modern armies see Angels\r\nor a Cross in the sky or the green standard of Mohammed.\r\nI see that the man who tried this week to assassinate\r\nMr. J. P. Morgan states that he heard a voice from\r\nheaven bidding him do so. And I remember as a child\r\nconceiving an unfavourable\u2014and, I am sure, most unjust \u2014opinion of St. James the Less because a certain murderer\r\nin Australia firmly maintained that his crime had been\r\nrecommended to him by that saint in person. I fear\r\nthat I may be differing from the judgment of your\r\nlast year's President when I express the opinion that,\r\nthough the murderer's belief was a matter of some importance, and nerved him to a difficult action, it was\r\nnevertheless quite untrue, and would have remained equally\r\nuntrue if it had involved ten thousand murders, or caused,\r\nor prevented, a European war. But Dr. Schiller uses the word \" truth \" in his own pragmatic way, and it\r\nis quite likely that I have misunderstood him. I do\r\nnot want to quarrel with him so much as I do with\r\na quite different class of writers, who positively believe\r\nin the truth of these visions, and use the word truth\r\nin its ordinary sense. Some of our troops in the retreat\r\nfrom Mons are said to have seen angels in the sky ; and they deserved to do so if ever troops did. But\r\nit does sadden and disappoint me to find an educated\r\nclergyman actually maintaining that the angels were\r\nthere\u2014angels with long feathery wings, as in Christmas\r\ncards\u2014and basing arguments upon the supposed fact.\r\nThere have been plenty of people who have had visions\r\nof Apollo and Anubis and the divers gods of the cannibal\r\nislands. There have been people who have had visions\r\nof Demogorgon, though Demogorgon is not a person at\r\nall but only a slip of the pen\u2014the word demiurgum\r\n56 Professor Gilbert Murray. [part\r\nbeing mixed by a scribe's mistake with the word gorgona\r\nin a known passage of Lactantius Placidus. In last\r\nyear's Proceedings we can read how Mr. Griinbaum hada vision of the spirit Bien-Boa, whom he had read about ; and the original Bien-Boa has been shown by Miss Verrall\r\nnot to have been a spirit at all but a mere fraudulent hoax.\r\nThe best illustration of the process by which these\r\nhallucinations arise is to be found, as I suggested above,\r\nin the myth-making faculty of common dreams. There\r\nis a well-known case, printed in an old number of the\r\nProceedings of this Society, of a girl who was asleep\r\nand was roused by her sister, who caught her by the sleeve\r\nand said \" Boo.\" In the moment before she woke she\r\nhad a long dream. A huge dog was pursuing her, with\r\nbarks and growls. She held a door against it, but it broke through ; then another door and another door ; at last she was holding the last door of the house, the\r\nbrute was too strong for her ; it burst through and,\r\nuttering a roar, seized her sleeve with its teeth. Youwill observe that the sequence of time is rather curious.\r\nThe sense-perception which caused the dream occurs in\r\nthe dream not at the beginning but at the end. Therest of the dream consists in what we may call a hurried\r\nimprovisation of imaginary incidents to lead up to the\r\nsense-impression which started it. It is as though the\r\nsleeper's subconsciousness said : \"A cry of Boo and a\r\npull at my sleeve ! How the dickens can I account for\r\nthis ? \" It is just the same in a more elaborate case given in vol. xii. of the Proceedings by a distinguished\r\nAmerican Assyriologist. He had been working' late at the\r\narrangement of an Assyrian collection in the University\r\nof Pennsylvania. In the course of the night, his brain\r\nstill working in its sleep, it struck him that two pieces\r\nof cut jade which had been classified as having nothing\r\nto do with each other were cut out of the same piece,\r\nand that piece an inscribed cylinder. The shock of\r\ndiscovery took shape in a dream, after which he got up\r\nand verified the suggestion, and it proved true. But\r\nthe way in which his dream presented it was this. Hefound himself standing, if I remember rightly, in an\r\nLXXII.] Presidential Address. 57\r\nancient Assyrian temple, when there came to him a\r\nlong-robed high priest, whose dress he noted carefully\r\nand compared with his expectations. The priest beckoned him to come to the treasure-chamber on the southeast side of the building, and there told him a story ; how the King, Sargcn, had sent a message to the priests\r\nwho were in this room, bidding them send him a pair\r\nof jade ear-rings, and, having no other jade handy, they\r\nhad cut an inscribed cylinder in two and made ear-rings\r\nof it. \" Which two ear-rings,\" the priest concluded,\r\n\" are now Nos. (say) 932 and 128 in your collection at\r\nPennsylvania.\"\r\nWhat seems to occur in a dream of this sort, or in\r\nan ordinary hallucination, is that the mind reaches some\r\nconclusion or some passionately held belief by a process\r\nof which it is not properly conscious. It desires some\r\nsupport for its present state ; it insists on having it ; it projects its own desire for support into the form of\r\nan external assurance. Now, so far I have been speaking, for simplicity's\r\nsake, as if the only means by which we can receive\r\ncommunications from the external world were the orthodox\r\nfive senses. This view probably needs correction. The\r\nfive senses are, as M. Bergson says, the canals into which\r\nour consciousness of the external world is specially directed.\r\nIt is thus made clear, definite, limited. But there seem\r\nto be other forms of sense-perception which cannot exactly be referred to the special organs of sense. There\r\nis the sense of internal strain, for example ; and perhaps\r\nthe curious sense of propinquity\u2014as, for instance, when\r\nin the dark you feel that you are coming close to a wall.\r\nI am here quite out of my depth, but I rather suspect\r\nthat we must also allow for some direct passage of vibrations from one human body to another, or of currents\r\nbetween two minds. I do not wish to be dogmatic\r\nhere. The cases in which a man seems to receive information direct from another mind, and not by any\r\ndefinite channel of sense, will seldom bear close examination. For example, one can feel, as we say, \" instinctively,\" that some one in the room is cross or hostile,\r\n58 Professor Gilbert Murray. [part\r\nbut it would be very rash to conclude, in such a case,\r\nthat there had been no sense-perception of the unconscious kind. What makes me incline to a belief in the\r\ntransmission of thoughts or impressions by some methoddifferent from our normal five senses is chiefly my ownexperience in telepathy. When I am getting at the\r\nthing which I wish to discover the only effort I makeis a sort of effort of attention of a quite general kind.\r\nThe thing may come through practically any sense- channel, or it may discover a road of its own, a chain\r\nof reasoning or of association, which, as far as I re- member, never coincides with any similar chain in the\r\nmind of anyone present, but is invented, much as a\r\nhallucination is invented, for the purpose of the moment.\r\nI will illustrate this by a few instances.\r\nThe method followed is this : I go out of the room\r\nand of course out of earshot. Someone in the room,\r\ngenerally my eldest daughter, thinks of a scene or an\r\nincident or anything she likes, and says it aloud. It\r\nis written down, and I am called. I come in, usually\r\ntake my daughter's hand, and then, if I have luck,\r\ndescribe in detail what she has thought of. The least\r\ndisturbance of our customary method, change of time\r\nor place, presence of strangers, controversy, and especially\r\nnoise, is apt to make things go wrong. I become myself\r\nsomewhat over-sensitive and irritable, though not, I believe, to a noticeable degree. You will understand\r\nthat I am not attempting to prove the validity of these\r\nexperiments, much less alleging that I have any stronger\r\npowers of telepathy than my neighbours. I am merely\r\nusing certain incidents in my own experience for what\r\nthey are worth\u2014and they may be worth very little\r\nas illustrations of the theory I have been putting forward\r\nabout the fringe of consciousness.\r\nLet me first take a perfectly simple and uninteresting\r\ninstance, not an experiment at all but an accident. Afew days ago a lady whom I know slightly came and\r\ntold me a longish story affecting a matter of business.\r\nIn it there occurred a person whose name she would\r\nnot mention, but whom she called \"Mr. X.\" As soon\r\nLXXII.] Presidential Address. 59\r\nas she said \" Mr. X. \" I knew who the man was, though\r\nI had never heard him called out of his name before,\r\nand did not know that he knew this lady. This knowledge seemed to come immediately. But I should not\r\nlike to be sure that it did. It may have been rapid\r\nunconscious reasoning\r\n.\r\nNow for some experiments, where the subconscious impression chose some sense-channel by which to reach me. First,\r\nthe sense of smell. My daughter thought of Savonarola\r\nat Florence and the people burning their clothes and\r\npictures and valuables in the square.\u2014I first felt \" This\r\nis Italy,\" then \" This is not modern \" ; and then hesitated, when accidentally a small tarry bit of coal tumbled\r\nout of the fire. I smelt oil or paint burning and so got the whole scene. It seems as though here some\r\nsubconscious impression, struggling up towards consciousness, caught hold of the burning coal as a means of\r\ngetting through. (I am sorry to use metaphorical language, but exact language would be both difficult and\r\ncumbrous.) In this case, then, the information came\r\nthrough the channel of the sense of smell.\r\nOften it comes through sight. For example : Subject\r\nset : \" Mr. B. . . . in the quad at New College with\r\na big dog jumping up on him.''\u2014My guess: \"Mr.\r\nB. . . .in the courtyard of a hotel with a dancing bear.*'\r\nThis erroneous guess was evidently a misinterpreted\r\npicture. There are many cases of correct pictures. E.g.\r\nSubject set : \"I think of grandfather at the Harrow\r\nand Winchester cricket match, dropping hot cigar-ash on Miss Thompson's parasol.\"\r\n\r\nMy guess (verbatim) : \" Why, this is grandfather. He's at a cricket match\r\n\r\nwhy it's absurd : he seems to be dropping ashes on\r\na lady's parasol.\"\r\nSometimes the impression comes through hearing. Once\r\nI had to guess something about a man called David ; I got\r\nthe action right, but thought the man was Davies. This\r\ncase is not quite as conclusive as it looks, since it so happened that the two men, David and Davies, had in\r\nsome ways just the same geographical atmosphere about\r\nthem. This incident set us all on the look-out for evidence\r\n(10 Professor Gilbert Murray. [part\r\nof auditory hyperesthesia ; but the clue was not particularly successful, though once or twice I have described\r\nthe scene or incident in almost exactly the same words,\r\nor in phrases of the same rhythm, in which they were\r\ndescribed by the person setting the problem.\r\nSometimes I get at the result by a fictitious association\r\nof ideas. A good case is the following. Subject set : Mr. Z . . . galloping along a beach in Greece.\u2014When I came in my eyes caught a book by Mr. Z . . . on my\r\nbookshelves, and presently I heard a horse in the\r\nroad outside. I then said : \" This is a mere guess,\r\nbecause I hear a horse galloping and I happen to have\r\nseen Z . . .'s book ; but I think of Z . . . galloping\r\non a horse.\" Question : Where ? \" Oh, I suppose in\r\nGreece.\" (His book was about Greece.)\r\nMuch more often, however, the information comes not\r\nthrough any particular sense but through what I may\r\ncall a sort of indeterminate sense of quality or atmosphere.\r\nFor instance, I almost always, if I am going right, get\r\nfirst a feeling of the country in which the scene or incident is set. I say, \" This is Russian,\" \" This is Italian,\" \" This seems tropical,\" or the like. Also I am apt to\r\nknow whether a thing comes from a book or from real\r\nlife, and the taste of the book is apt to be very strong.\r\nOne could never confuse Thackeray and Tolstoy, for\r\ninstance. A rather instructive case, and one in which\r\nI do think I was rather clever, referred to a scene in a book which I had not read. I give it more at length.\r\nSubject set : A scene in a story by Strindberg. A\r\nman and woman in a lighthouse, the man lying fallen\r\non the floor, and the woman bending over him, looking\r\nat him and hoping that he is dead.\r\nMy guess : \"A horrid atmosphere, full of hatred and\r\ndiscomfort. A book, not real life. A book I have\r\nnot read. Not Russian, not Italian, but foreign. I\r\ncannot get it. . . . There is a round tower, a man and\r\nwoman in a round tower ; but it is not Maeterlinck.\r\nNot like him. I should guess it was Strindberg. The\r\nwoman is bending over the man and hating him, hoping\r\nhe is dead.\"\r\nlxxii.] Presidential Address. 61\r\nAnother Strindberg scene, also from a book I had not\r\nread, raises a rather interesting point. The subject set\r\nwas an old cross, poor, disappointed schoolmaster eating\r\ncrabs for lunch at a restaurant, and insisting on having\r\nfemale crabs. I got the atmosphere, the man, the lunch\r\nin the restaurant on crabs, and thought I had finished,\r\nwhen my daughter said, \" What kind of crabs ? \" I\r\nfelt rather impatient and said : \" Oh, Lord, I don't\r\nknow : Female crabs.\" That is, the response to the\r\nquestion came automatically, with no preparation, while\r\nI thought I could not give it. I may add that I had\r\nnever before heard of there being any inequality between\r\nthe sexes among crabs, regarded as food.\r\nBefore sitting down let me recapitulate the kind of\r\nconclusion to which I think these results possibly point.\r\nI will take them under two heads.\r\nIn the first place, my whole experience leads me to\r\nbelieve strongly in the truth of M. Bergson's suggestion\r\nthat telepathy is as a matter of fact operating at every\r\nmoment and everywhere. I greatly doubt whether it does not lie at the root of language. It is hard to\r\nsee how language can originally have grown, or how\r\nan infant can learn it, or how we can ever, by means\r\nof language, understand a new idea, without telepathy.\r\nOf course there is a considerable difference in degree\r\nbetween that ordinary everyday amount of telepathy\r\nand the somewhat disgraceful stage of proficiency attained\r\nby your temporary President. And you will suspect\r\nme of trying to shelter myself by blackening the characters\r\nof my neighbours when I express the opinion that probably most people could attain the same results if they\r\npractised for a good time and did not get excited or\r\nflurried. It is however quite possible that, if my results are above the average, it may be that I have accidentally\r\nhit on some good method\u2014though I have no idea what\r\nit is. It does not seem to me likely that the fact of\r\nmy not eating meat or the like has anything whatever\r\nto do with it. Nor do I suppose that there is any\r\nimportance in the fact that I find the whole business\r\nrather unpleasant : it does not make me ill or exhaust\r\n62 Professor Gilbert, Murray. [part\r\nme in any noticeable way, but I rather dislike it and.\r\nwould sooner do something else. I think this probably\r\nmeans that I get into a state of slight hyperaesthesia\r\nand am particularly sensitive to every kind of impression.\r\nNoises, for instance, become intolerable. In any case, I\r\nhave, in this matter, thrown myself on your mercy. And\r\nif you feel disposed to think harshly of these proceedings\r\nin a respectable bourgeois paterfamilias of sober habits,\r\nI would venture to warn you to look inside and make\r\nvery sure of yourselves before you condemn others.\r\nThe second conclusion to which I incline is this. The\r\nbasis of this so-called telepathy is unconscious sense- perception, the sensory disturbance itself being too slight\r\nfor consciousness, but the state of mind resulting from\r\nit being fully perceptible. (As, e.g. an imperceptible touch\r\nmay make a man unconsciously put his hand towards\r\nhis waistcoat pocket without knowing why he does so, and\r\nmay at the same time excite him violently with the\r\nthought that his pocket has been picked.) The basis\r\nis unconscious sense-perception ; but we must be prepared\r\nfor the possibility that this sense-perception is not confined to the canonical five channels of Sight, Sound, Smell,\r\nTaste, Touch. At least, in my own experience, when the\r\ninformation professes to come through one of the regular\r\nsenses, the profession has generally the air of being false.\r\nI mean, I seize on the smell of the burning coal in the\r\nSavonarola subject, or on the sound of the horse galloping\r\non the road in the Mr. Z . . . subject, where a less wellregulated mind would at once have a direct hallucinatory\r\ncommunication from St. James the Less. And again,\r\nsome of the information which seems to come most clearly\r\nand rapidly, as when I feel a certain emotional atmosphere,\r\nor the country to which an incident belongs, or the\r\nfact that it is in a book and not in real life, does\r\nnot seem to be the sort that could well be conveyed\r\nby mere sense-impressions of the canonical sort. Thus\r\nI should be inclined provisionally to admit the likelihood\r\nthat we may become directly sensitive to another person's\r\nstate of mind ; though I realise that it is hard here\r\nto say exactly what one means. We spoke above of\r\nLXXII.] Presidential Address. 63\r\na familiar experience. For example : that if one person\r\nin a small party is angry, others will often feel it without\r\nany tangible source of information. It feels like a direct\r\nsensitiveness of mind to mind. Yet it seems likely\r\nenough that one is really getting the information from\r\nextremely slight subconscious sense-impressions ; that the\r\nangry person, if put under a psychic microscope, would\r\nbe seen to be kicking, pouting, snorting, and making un- mistakable grimaces, and that it is one's unconscious\r\nperception of these that causes the so-called telepathy.\r\nBut I do not feel able to rule out the possibility of a much wider and more direct impression, not conveyed\r\nthrough any of the specialized channels. I leave the\r\nquestion to biologists.\r\n[Note. Some of the cases quoted here are given from\r\nmemory. The contemporary written record will be found\r\nin Mrs. Verrall's paper or in the Appendix.

[part\r\nIII.\r\nREPORT ON A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS IN\r\n\" GUESSING.\"\r\nBy Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\r\nRead at a General Meeting of the Society on February 23,\r\n1916.\r\nMy object in this paper is to give a detailed account of\r\nthe experiments to which Professor Murray alluded, and\r\nsome of which he described, in his Presidential Address to our Society 1 delivered in July, 1915, and so to enable the\r\nreader to form his own conclusions as to their results.\r\nThe experiments have extended over a period of some six\r\nyears, from the spring of 1910 to the end of 1915, and a complete and careful record has been kept. The total\r\nnumber of experiments recorded is 505 : a number, it seems to me\u2014especially in view of the complex nature\r\nof the subjects selected for transmission\u2014sufficient to\r\ncall for thorough examination and analysis, although\r\nperhaps insufficient to establish beyond doubt their vera causa. Professor Murray has briefly described the method\r\nobserved : A small group of people assemble in one room,\r\nand in the absence of the percipient, a scene or incident\r\nis selected for transmission, briefly described by the person\r\nselecting it, and noted in writing by one of the company,\r\nusually not the selecting agent. Professor Murray, on being\r\ncalled into the room, takes the hand of the agent and\r\n1 See above, pp. 40-63.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.'''' 65\r\nproceeds to describe his impressions. The company in\r\ngeneral remains silent, but a few questions may be asked\r\nby the agent ; and these, as well as the percipient's\r\nremarks, are recorded by the note-taker. I have spoken\r\nof the \"agent,\" but that is perhaps to beg the question,\r\nfor when there are four or five persons present, all of\r\nwhom know the subject selected, it is possible that\r\nthe \"agency\" is distributed among them and not confined to the person whom Professor Murray specifically\r\naddresses.\r\nSome variations have been made in the procedure ; contact has occasionally been omitted, and written substituted for spoken description of the incident selected.\r\nMore frequently the subject has been chosen by a member\r\nof the company who does not act as the ostensible agent.\r\nMr. Murray has pointed out that the least disturbance of\r\nthe customary method is apt to make things go wrong,\r\nand this is an experience familiar to all who have any\r\nacquaintance with experiments on such lines as these, or indeed with any supernormal phenomena. Too much\r\nreliance must not, therefore, be placed on the effects\r\nwhich seem to follow these variations, but the effects are worth noting and may be suggestive.\r\nContact does not appear to be necessary to the success\r\nof the experiments, though it probably serves the purpose\r\nof fixing the attention of agent and percipient, and in\r\nsome cases may afford to the latter indications as to the\r\ngeneral success or failure of the impression described. But\r\nthe complexity of the selected incidents makes it difficult\r\nto suppose that much help could be derived from a\r\npositive or negative indication unconsciously given by\r\ncontact, and herein the case differs markedly from \" musclereading performances,\" which are so arranged by the\r\n\"thought-reader\" as to present a series of alternatives to\r\nwhich the response must be \" Right \" or \" Wrong.\" Professor Murray's successive approaches, when he is not at once successful, introduce two or three elements, of which\r\none may be right and others wrong, or vice versa. Take,\r\nfor instance, an experiment at which I was present\r\n(February 17, 1914). The subject, a purely fantastic one,\r\nE\r\n66 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nselected by Professor Murray's elder daughter, Mrs. Arnold\r\nToynbee, was as follows : \" Celia Newbolt 1 under a gourd tree at Smyrna.\"\r\nProfessor Murray's successive statements were as follows :\r\n(a) Modern Greek of some kind.\r\n(b) Sort of Asia Minor place.\r\n(c) A tree and women sitting under it.\r\n(d) A particular tree.\r\n(e) A girl sitting under it.\r\n(\/) She does not belong to the place.\r\n(g) She is English.\r\n(h) Something to do with a poet.\r\n(i) Can't be Mrs. Kipling.\r\n{k) No, it's a girl.\r\n(I) Rather like one of the 0 s. (m) Don't think I can get her.\r\nIt is difficult to imagine what kind of indication from\r\ncontact could lead from step to step in the above series ; how, for instance, after (c) had been said, could contact\r\nindicate that not \" women \" but \" a girl \" was thought of as sitting under the tree, and how can contact unconsciously, or for that matter consciously, indicate that the\r\ngirl in question has \" something to do with a poet \" ? Moreover, that contact is not indispensable to the\r\nsuccess of the experiments is shown by an examination of\r\nthe eleven recorded cases where there was either no\r\ncontact at all or contact only half-way through the\r\nexperiment. In two of these cases there was failure, but\r\nin the other nine there was at least partial, and in some\r\nof them striking success. Thus on August 11, 1913, the\r\nsubject chosen by Mrs. Toynbee was as follows : \" The scene in [Tolstoi's] 2 Resurrection where the girl\r\n[Maslova] goes to the station to see Nekludov, but instead\r\nof the real girl I'll think of Christina [Roberts]\u2014she goes\r\nto the station, but he won't [stop].\"\r\n1 \" Celia Newbolt \" is the daughter of Sir Henry Newbolt, the poet,\r\nauthor of Admirals All, etc., etc. See Appendix, p. 107.\r\n2 The words in brackets are my explanatory additions in the contemporary record.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.\" 67\r\nProfessor Murray, without contact, said : \" It's a faked thing. You say it's a Tolstoi, in Resurrection, but it's really Christina Roberts,\" then after\r\ntaking hands, he added : \" I can only get her at Waterloo going to Brackland\r\n[near Hindhead, the house of her parents]. I know it's not right, but it's something to do with a station. I\r\ncan't get it.\"\r\nHere the \" faking \" and the combination of Resurrection\r\nand Christina Roberts were described before contact, after\r\nwhich was added the idea of a station, but the exact\r\nincident was not divined.\r\nOn a date not named, in 1914, three successive experiments without contact were made, with excellent results.\r\n1 quote one of these : Mrs Arnold Toynbee : \"Mrs. C hitting the Purser 1\r\nwith a skipping rope.\"\r\nProfessor Murray, without contact : \" I think it's Mother\r\nhitting the Purser with a skipping rope\u2014No, it's your\r\nwoman the overdressed woman\u2014Mrs. C .\"\r\nOn the other hand, on ten occasions when writing was\r\nsubstituted for speaking, during Professor Murray's absence,\r\nthere was no success, and this fact of course suggests that\r\nthe success in other cases may be due to hearing, that is,\r\nnot to telepathy in which the senses are excluded, but to\r\nhyperesthesia. The conditions are clearly such as to\r\nexclude any chance of Professor Murray's overhearing what\r\nis said in the room after his departure, if one is to reckon\r\nwith ordinary sense-impressions. The door of the room is shut, Professor Murray waits either in the hall at some\r\ndistance from the closed door, or in another room beyond the\r\nhall, with the door shut, the party inside the room are also\r\nat some little distance from the door, and the speaker\r\ndescribes the selected incident in a low voice. But we\r\nknow so little about the conditions of hyperaesthesia that\r\nit must not be ruled out as a possible explanation, and\r\nno doubt the complete failure in these ten cases when the\r\nsubject was not audibly expressed suggests that audition\r\n1 This incident actually occurred, but was not known to Professor Murray.\r\n68 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nplays a part in the result. 1 But it should be noted that\r\nsix of them are parts of unsuccessful series of experiments.\r\nThus on June 10, 1910, out of the whole number of\r\nexperiments, thirteen (four written), there was only one\r\nsuccess and three partial successes : a proportion far below\r\nthe average. 2 On December 15, 1910, when two further\r\nattempts were made without speaking, there had been\r\ndistinct success in the first three cases (spoken), but after\r\nthe failure in the fourth case (written) there was little further\r\nsuccess on that day. Another of the failures was the last\r\nin a series of ten, and the agent was a stranger making his\r\nfirst trial, so that failure is not surprising. Still, when all allowance is made for disturbance of normal conditions,\r\nand discouragement arising from previous failure, the want\r\nof success when writing is substituted for speaking un- doubtedly makes it necessary to watch carefully for other\r\nindications suggestive of auditory hyperesthesia.\r\nBefore considering this question further, some general\r\naccount must be given of the experiments, and of the\r\nproportion of successes, partial successes and failures. It\r\nis not possible to classify complex incidents of this kind\r\nas \"Right\" or \"Wrong\"; many cases are on the\r\nborder-line and might be classified differently by different\r\npeople. About failures there is little or no doubt, and\r\nwhere there is any doubt, I have counted the experiments,\r\nfor statistical purposes, as failures. The non-failures I\r\n1 On one of these occasions, however, although Mr. Murray was not\r\nsuccessful in describing the subject selected, he seems to have become\r\naware of the action of one of the company. A subject was chosen by\r\nhis brother, Mr. Aubrey Murray, who handed a written note of it to the agent, Mrs. Toynbee, pointing vigorously to it to draw her attention\r\nto this new suggestion that writing should be substituted for speaking.\r\nProfessor Murray received the impression that the subject was \" something you can point out here,\" and on being told that was not so, he\r\nadded, making a vigorous gesture, like that of his brother : \" It's very\r\nodd, I get an impression that you pointed at something.\" No hyperaesthesia can account for this. The contemporary record, though it makes clear the \" vigorous pointing \" does not state that the subject was written and not spoken. My information on this point comes from\r\nthe witnesses themselves, but I have not included the case in the main\r\nreport, owing to the want of clearness in the contemporary record.\r\n2 For statistics, see below, p. 70,\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.''' 69\r\nhave placed in two classes, which I have called Successes\r\nand Partial Successes. I have counted as Successes not\r\nonly all cases where the complete incident is described,\r\nbut also cases where what may be called the essential\r\nelements are given by the percipient, but, of course,\r\nopinions will differ as to what is essential. That difficulty can only be met by my giving in detail one or two\r\ninstances, which I have classified, for statistical purposes,\r\nas Successes (S) and Partial Successes (P), so that the\r\nreader may form his own impression as to my judgement\r\nin this matter.\r\nOf the seven cases described by Professor Murray,1 six\r\ncome under the head of Successes in my classification,\r\nalthough in one case (May 8, 1910), that of B in the\r\nfront quad at New College with a dancing bear, the\r\nanimal thought of was in fact a dog. 2 The seventh case\r\nI have counted as P and not S, because whereas the\r\nsubject was : \" Mr. Z. riding on the sea- shore on a horse,\"\r\nthe description gave no definite locality. 3 My method\r\nof distinguishing P from S is further indicated in the\r\nthree following cases, which I count as P. The first two\r\nwere on the same day :\r\nJ?me,4 1910.\r\nSubject. \" Miss Barbara Tchaikovsky visiting a political\r\nprisoner in the Peter and Paul [prison].\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" Tchaikovsky, but I can't see what he's\r\ndoing.\u2014No, I've got it blurred. I've got it mixed up\r\nwith Miss Tchaikovsky. I've got her knocking at a\r\nfront door.\"\r\nAs the idea of prison, prisoner, is absent in the description, I have not counted this as a complete success.\r\n1 See above p. 59 ff.\r\n2 The record here shows that though the locality was incorrectly\r\nguessed at first, it was subsequently correctly given. (See Appendix,\r\np. 90).\r\n3 For further comment on this case, see below, p. 85 and Appendix, p. 92.\r\n4 The date is not noted, but was between June 10 and Juno 18. (See\r\nAppendix, p. 94.)\r\n70 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nJune, 1910.\r\nSubject. \" Paul Sabatier walking with an alpenstock along a winding road in Savoy.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" A man like Mr. Irving going up a mountain\u2014it isn't Mr. Irving\u2014it's a clergyman with an\r\nalpenstock\u2014I should say it was a foreign clergyman.\" 1\r\nHere, again, since the name \"Paul Sabatier\" and the\r\nlocality \" Savoy \" were not given, the success is counted\r\nonly as Partial, though I think it will be admitted that\r\nthe greater part of the desired impression was successfully\r\ntransmitted, and, incidentally, the failure to mention the\r\ndistinctive names is against the theory of auditory hyperaesthesia.\r\nSeptember 14, 1913.\r\nSubject. \" Alister and [Malcolm] MacDonald running along\r\nthe platform at Liverpool Street, and trying to catch the train\r\njust going out.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" Something to do with a railway\r\nstation. I should say it was rather a crowd at a big\r\nrailway station, and two little bo37 s running along in the\r\ncrowd. I should guess Basil.\" 2\r\nHere, again, though the picture of two little boys\r\nrunning in a railway station is correctly described, the\r\nname of the station is not given, and the boys are not\r\nidentified. This therefore appears as P, and not S.\r\nHaving, an I hope, enabled the reader to attach a meaning to the symbols P and S, I joroceed to a statistical\r\nexamination of the experiments.\r\nThe total number of recorded experiments is 505. On\r\nsix occasions where the subject is noted there is no entry\r\nof a description, and these I count as Failures. So also\r\nI do ten cases where only the word \" Failure \" is noted.\r\nIn sixty-eight cases no impression was obtained, and for\r\nstatistical purposes these are, of course, also Failures,\r\nthough there is a great distinction, as regards our estimate\r\n1 See Appendix, p. 94.\r\n2 For further comment, see below, p. 74\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.\" 71\r\nof the phenomena, between a wrong guess and a failure\r\nto have any impression. These may be called Negative,\r\nand the others Positive Failures. The whole number of\r\nFailures of every kind is 197, sixty-eight of these being\r\ndue to absence of any impression. 1 The number of\r\nPartial Successes is 141, and of Complete Successes 167.\r\nThus, in the whole 505 experiments, we have the following percentage :\r\nSuccess - - - - 33-1\r\nPartial Success - - 27-9\r\nFailure - 39-0\r\nor, excluding the sixty-eight cases in which no impression\r\nwas received, in the resulting 437 experiments we have :\r\nSuccess - 38-2\r\nPartial Success - - 32-3\r\nFailure - 29-5\r\nso that where some sort of impression was obtained, the\r\ncases in which there was complete failure amounted to\r\nless than a third of the whole.\r\nThese figures clearly establish the fact, already sufficiently shown in the cases quoted above, that some\r\ninformation is transmitted to the percipient, and it becomes therefore of great interest to determine if possible\r\nwhether the ordinary senses, if we allow for special sensitiveness, are the agency for the transmission. The conditions of\r\nthe experiment show clearly that the only sense we need\r\nconsider is that of hearing, and, as I have said, our\r\nattention is specially directed to that by the failure of\r\nthe few cases where the selected subject was not described\r\nin spoken words.\r\nAnother feature of these records also disposes one to\r\nlook for a solution in the direction of auditory perception.\r\nIn several instances, about forty, the subject was selected\r\nby one member of the company and described to another\r\nperson who was to act as agent, that is, who was to be in\r\n*I have counted the \"Failures,\" so noted, and the blank entries as Positive Failures, though I suspect that in most if not all these cases no\r\nimpression was obtained. [Note by Professor Murray. \" Yes, that is so.\"]\r\n72 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\ncontact with Professor Murray, and to whom he addressed\r\nhimself when describing his impression. Now, in the\r\nmajority of these cases, Professor Murray begins by saying\r\nto the agent : \" This is not yours ; this seems to be Soand-So's.\" Of course, his impression may be telepathically\r\nderived, but we cannot exclude the possibility, granting\r\nauditory hyperesthesia, that the percipient subconsciously\r\nhears a voice which he recognises as not that of the\r\nostensible agent, and, in fact, on more than one occasion\r\nProfessor Murray has announced on entering that he \" heard\r\nSo-and-So's voice,\" 1 and the experiment was usually\r\nstopped. Less delicate sense of hearing would be needed\r\nto recognise a voice than to catch actual words, so that\r\nif audition plays any part in the phenomena, we should\r\nexpect it to enter into the recognition that the subject\r\nhas been selected by some one other than the ostensible\r\nagent. If this were so, if, that is, the guess were thus\r\nhelped by ordinary sense-perception, it would be reasonable\r\nto look for at least as high a ratio of success in these\r\nforty instances as in the general totals. But that is not\r\nthe case. The failures are relatively more numerous,\r\namounting to twenty out of forty, that is, to 50 per cent,\r\ninstead of 29 per cent. This fact, so far as it goes,\r\npoints against audition, and in favour of telepathy from\r\nthe agent. For it may, I think, be assumed that the\r\nagent realises less vividly a subject dictated by another\r\nthan one deliberately chosen by herself, and that in\r\nconsequence the telepathic transmission is less clear. I\r\nmake this suggestion with diffidence, as I am aware that\r\nthe number of these cases, forty, is not large enough to\r\nwarrant a conclusion. But I note it because the more I\r\nconsider these records, the more plain it becomes that\r\nvivid realisation on the part of the agent, and a real as\r\ndistinct from a momentary and ad hoc interest in the\r\nsubject, is conducive to success\u2014a fact which, if true,\r\nwould seem to point to telepathy rather than to hyperaesthesia as a vera causa. On the whole, however, the recognition that the subject\r\n1 For the evidential value of the percipient's own impressions, see below, p. 85.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.\" 73\r\nhas been chosen by some one not the ostensible agent is at least suggestive of auditory perception ; and so perhaps\r\nis the fact that noise, during the percipient's absence\r\nfrom the room, is recognised as a very potent cause of\r\nfailure to obtain any impression at all. In many of these\r\ncases Mr. Murray, on returning to the room, says : \" Too\r\nmuch noise ; no impression,\" or\r\n11 1 was disturbed by the\r\nservants,\" or \" by the dogs.\" But to this I do not\r\nattach much value, as all Avho have taken part in experiments of this kind, under conditions excluding sense- perception, know how important concentration and freedom\r\nfrom disturbance is to the percipient, and how \" sensitive \" most successful percipients are to noise or other irregular\r\ninterruptions.\r\nThe question of hyperesthesia versus telepathy can, it seems to me, be best answered by a detailed examination\r\nof the records, and especially of the partially successful cases and the failures, with a view to seeing whether (a)\r\nthe errors are likely to be produced by mishearing, and\r\n(b) whether any elements are observable which cannot be\r\naccounted for by hearing. I have examined the records\r\ncarefully with this object in view, and I propose to place\r\nbefore the reader, such evidence as I have been able to obtain.\r\n(a) Evidence suggestive of auditory hyperaesthesia.\r\nThe chief source of this evidence must be sought among\r\nerrors, though, of course, it is possible that when a\r\ndescription reproduces faithfully the words used by the\r\nselecting agent, the success is due to overhearing. But it may equally well be due to a vivid telepathic impression,\r\nand therefore does not help to determine the question\r\nunder consideration.\r\nA careful examination of errors gives seventeen cases,\r\nbesides the one described by Professor Murray,1 where mishearing might conceivably account for the mistake. Thus\r\nwe find the following substitutions :\r\nJ. A. Smith for Jane Eyre\r\nMasefield for Mansfield\r\n1 David\u2014Davies. See above, p. 59.\r\n74 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.

Sometimes a word is unmistakeably\r\nrecognised. Thus, on February 4, 1911, the subject being\r\n\" The merchant picking red roses in Beauty and the\r\nBeast,'\" Professor Murray says : \"I seem to get the one\r\nword ' Merchant.' \" On other occasions a word is recognised but misinterpreted, as when \" Poll \" is substituted,\r\nthough afterwards corrected, for \" Pole,\" \" Ball \" is taken\r\nto be a name instead of a dance, and \" Karen,\" an\r\nacquaintance of the experimenters, is described in the place\r\nof Karen, a character in a book. The two remaining\r\ncases of possible audition are as follows :\r\nNovember 13, 1910. 2\r\nSubject. \" Out of UEspion ; Evsei finding a fly in his ink.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" This is a book too, a Russian book.\r\nIt's L'Espion. It's a scene I don't remember at all. I get\r\n[the] impression of the boy squashing a fly, but I can't\r\nremember it at all. I confuse it with Joseph Vance.\"\r\nThe name of the boy Evsei is not given by Professor\r\nMurray, but I think that it is responsible for the confusion with Joseph Fance. 3 In this case, however, as Professor Murray had read UEspion, it is quite as likely\r\nthat a half-recalled normal memory of his reading\r\nsuggested the similar sound, as that he had subconsciously\r\nheard his daughter give the name.\r\n3 A correspondent suggests that the confusion may be duo to the\r\n\" crocking \" of the \" hinseck \" in the bur, described at the beginning\r\nof de Morgan's book.\r\n1 See above, p. 70. 2 See Appendix, p. 97.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing..\" 75\r\nSeptember 7, 1913.\r\nSubject. \" Lewis Carroll drawing pictures of black cats in the\r\nparapet room at Naworth.\"\r\n[To this is appended a note saying that the agent, Mrs. A.\r\nToynbee, \" at one moment thought of Christ Church,\" the\r\nOxford College of which \" Lewis Carroll \" was a member.]\r\nProfessor Murray. \" It's Naworth, and it's somebody\r\ndrawing in the parapet room. It's somebody who\r\ndoesn't belong there. He's drawing the picture of the\r\ncat in Alice in Wonderland with a grin. Can't get\r\nhim a bit. He makes the same sort of impression as\r\nVerrall, but he isn't Verrall. I think it is not a real\r\ncat. I think it is Alice in Wonderland. At one time\r\nI got a feeling of Christ Church.\"\r\nI have quoted this case at length at this point because\r\nwithout the context it might be thought that the introduction of the name Verrall was due to a mishearing of\r\nCarroll. But under the circumstances, seeing that the cat\r\nin Alice in Wonderland had already been mentioned, it is,\r\nI think, pretty certain that it is some other reason and\r\nnot similarity of sound which is responsible for the introduction of \" Verrall.\" 1\r\nThis is the complete list which careful scrutiny has\r\nfurnished of errors suggestive of mishearing, and it will\r\nbe admitted that the number is not large nor the evidence\r\nstriking. It remains to examine the other class of cases,\r\nthose, namely, suggesting that the impression of the\r\nsubject is such as it is unlikely or impossible should be\r\nderived from auditory hyperaesthesia.\r\n(b) Evidence suggestive of telepathy.\r\nAgainst the seventeen cases just described must be set\r\nforty-five instances where the whole arrangement, if I may\r\nuse that word, of his impression by Mr. Murray suggests\r\nthat he has in some way caught a picture of the subject\r\nchosen, or perceived its general characteristics, and is not\r\ninfluenced by the words used by the agent. It is exceed1 Note by Professor Murray. \"I think it was the feeling of wit.\" Cf. the feeling of connexion with a poet in the Celia Newbolt case, p. 66.\r\n7G Mrs. A. W. Verratt. [part\r\ningly difficult to represent to the reader how strongly I\r\nhave been led by a study of these records, and even\r\nmore by witnessing the phenomena, to the conclusion\r\nthat, as Mr. Murray has said, \" the percipient often\r\nseems to receive information which comes direct from\r\nanother mind and not by any definite channel of sense.\"\r\nBut, perhaps, a summary of certain types, and a detailed\r\naccount, with comments, of some others, will enable the\r\nreader to realise, if not to share, the writer's feeling that\r\nthe main, perhaps the sole, explanation of the phenomenais to be found in telepathy.\r\nIn thirteen of the forty-five cases mentioned above, the\r\nscene is described but no names are given, although the\r\nnames were mentioned by the agent.

No. I feel as though it were something amateurish,\u2014written by a nobleman who wanted to write plays,\u2014or something like\r\nthat.\"\r\nHere the two main ideas, the annoyance of the successful candidate and the source from a \" silly play,\" are both reproduced, but the lady's name though mentioned\r\nby the agent is not given ; the \" nobleman,\" however,\r\nprobably represents the surname, that of a well-known\r\npeerage.\r\nJune 19, 1915.\r\nSubject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : \" Miss Negroponti\r\n[a Greek lady] looking at tulips at Kew.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" [I] don't feel at all sure about this.\r\nIs it Jamaica, or the West Indies ? I get an impression\r\nof a girl looking at flowers, in a garden. Its funny, I thought she was an Italian, but she is not Italian ; she seems like a black. I thought she was looking at\r\ntulips.\"\r\n(At this point the company began to laugh and make fun.) \" Not one of Mrs. W.'s black Belgians ? \" A contemporary note here adds that Mrs. A. Toynbee\r\nfirst thought of tulips, then thought of a very dark\r\nperson looking at them, a negroid person, before fixing on\r\nMiss Negroponti.\r\nThis case is interesting. The introduction of \" Jamaica,\r\nWest Indies, like a black \" is clearly not fortuitous. It may be derived from Mrs. Toynbee's rejected impression of a \" negroid person,\" 1 or it may be due to a vague\r\napprehension of the name Negroponti, in which case hyperaesthesia is not excluded. I have quoted the incident\r\nas interesting in itself, and as affording the weakest\r\nevidence against hyperaesthesia among these thirteen cases.\r\n1 For other instances where rejected impressions are caught by the\r\npercipient, see below, pp. 79 and 90.\r\n78 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nIn another group of cases, eleven in all, though the\r\nwhole impression is not correct, what may be called \" the\r\natmosphere \" has been perceived. Twice, for instance, on\r\nNovember 13, 1910, and September 7, 1913, when the\r\nsubject selected was a specified literary person engaged in\r\nwriting, the general situation was apprehended, though in\r\nboth cases the actual writer was incorrectly guessed, in one case \" May Sinclair \" being substituted for \" Forster,\"\r\nin the other \" a literary man in India or somewhere \" for\r\n\"Mary Wilkins in America.\" 1 On June 1, 1912, a scene,\r\ndescribed in Tchekov's play The Cherry Orchard, was said\r\nby Professor Murray to be \" Russian, it's in a book, it's a\r\nplay, it's a very inconsequent play, Tchekov, one of the\r\ntwo Tchekov plays, I should say The Cherry Orchard, but\r\nthat's just guessing,\" and he failed to get the exact\r\nscene. Again on December 12, 1915, a scene from Conrad's\r\nUnder Western Eyes, a story of Russian anarchists in\r\nSwitzerland, appears as \" it's a book, it's about Russia,\r\nI do not think it's a real Russian book . . . guessing, I\r\nshould say it was Conrad. It's English and it's about\r\nRussia.\" Here, also, the exact situation is not described,\r\nthough the percipient, quite correctly, notes that there is \" someone in a great state of terror or anxiety coming\r\ndownstairs.\" Once, on June 19, 1915, the selected subject\r\nbeing an extravagant dream, Professor Murray, though failing\r\nto perceive all details, remarks that it is \" something invented. It's not a story, not a book ; I should think it was a dream. There is some queer element of unreality\r\nabout.\"\r\nBut suggestive as the above-quoted cases are that Professor Murray's impressions are not derived from auditory\r\nhyperesthesia, they are not conclusive against such an\r\nexplanation, for experience has shown that impressions subconsciously obtained through one sense may take a form, as they come into the percipient's consciousness, appropriate\r\nto quite another derivation. In my own case, for instance,\r\nin the course of some experiences in guessing the values\r\nof cards felt, with closed eyes, by my finger tips, the\r\n1 See Appendix, p. 103.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.\" 79\r\nimpressions derived soon began to appear to me as visual\r\nimages, probably because to a good visualiser, as I am, most\r\nmental impressions take that form. 1 It is, therefore, possible\r\nthat information subconsciously heard by Professor Murray\r\nrises into his consciousness as a perceived scene or a\r\ngeneral impression, so that his feeling that a girl in Jamaica\r\n\"something like a black\" is looking at tulips is due\r\nto his having in fact heard subconsciously the name\r\nNegroponti.\r\nFor conclusive evidence that telepathy is at work in\r\nthese experiments, we must look for indications in the\r\npercipient's descriptions that thoughts, as distinct from\r\nspoken words, have been transferred from the agent or agents. Some evidence for this there is, and I give it in detail here ; if telepathy can be established in\r\nthese cases, the presumption is very strong that it is also acting in other cases, where otherwise we are bound\r\nto strain the evidence for hyperaesthesia as the vera causa. 2 Twice (June 7, 1910, May 18, 1913) when the agent\r\nrejected her first selection in favour of a second, the first,\r\nand not the second, was apprehended by Professor Murray\r\n;\r\nbut the cases are not perfectly clear for both selections were\r\ndescribed in words, and might therefore have been heard.\r\nOne of these presents several points of interest, and is therefore quoted here :\r\nJune 7, 1910. 3\r\n1st Subject, suggested to the agent, Mrs. A. Toynbee, by Lady\r\nMary Murray. \" A picture [in another room] by Grandfather\r\n[Lord Carlisle] of the Villa Glori [where the Cairoli brothers were killed in 1867].\"\r\n'See Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XI., p. 182 ff.\r\n3 Here, however, I should like to enter a Caveat. Personally, I believe\r\nthat auditory hyperaesthesia, under the conditions observed in these\r\nexperiments, is quite as \" abnormal \" as telepathy would be, and re- quires for its establishment much more corroborative evidence than I have been able to find. In fact, the records of the S.P.R. seem to me\r\nto show that telepathy is at least as common as hyperaesthesia.\r\n3 See Appendix, p. 92.\r\n80 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nTo this Mrs. Toynbee objected that it would be very\r\ndifficult, as she had not the picture in her mind.\r\n2nd Subject also suggested by Lady Mary Murray. \" Garibaldi with the people in their red shirts in the streets of\r\nPalermo.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" It's an Italian picture. I've got a\r\nblurred picture\u2014like a picture in Trevelyan's book of the\r\nCairoli brothers. I've got only this, but I know it doesn't exist.\"\r\nThe \" picture in Trevelyan's book \" is no doubt that of\r\nthe three Cairoli brothers with their mother (see Mr.\r\nG. M. Trevelyan's Garibaldi and the Making of Italy,\r\np. 37, where the death of two of the brothers at the Villa\r\nGlori is recorded). It must be admitted that Professor\r\nMurray's subconscious self, whether deriving its information\r\nfrom hyperesthesia or otherwise, at least masquerades\r\nhere as \" telepathetic.\" Omitting all names mentioned in\r\nboth selections, and avoiding all direct allusion to either\r\nsubject, he presents us with an unmistakeable indirect\r\nallusion to the rejected subject : the picture is \" blurred \" (it\r\nis not in Mrs. Toynbee's mind) ; it is \" like a picture . . . of the Cairoli brothers \" (killed at Villa Glori) ; it \" does\r\nnot exist \" (the subject having been rejected). Butbelievers in the ingenuity of the \" subliminal,\" and its desire\r\nto claim supernormal powers, will no doubt suppose that the\r\n\" telepathic game \" was deliberately played, though the\r\ninformation was derived from auditory hyperesthesia.\r\nBut such an explanation cannot be given where one of\r\nthe percipient's statements corresponds with an involuntary\r\nand unmentioned thought of the principal agent, or of\r\nsome other member of the company. Thus, on September\r\n25, 1910, the subject, that of a lady brushing her hair in a\r\nplace named, being correctly given, Professor Murray, before\r\nnaming the lady, mentioned the name of another lady\r\nentirely unconnected with the subject, but whose photograph 1 was in the mind of the agent. And, again, what\r\nexplanation can be given, other than telepathy, where the\r\npercipient adds to his description of the selected subject\r\n1 See Appendix, p. 97. The photograph was not in the room.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.\" si\r\ndetails not known to him but correct, though not named\r\nby the agent ? Thus : May 18, 1913.1\r\nSubject. Mrs. Toynbee (agent) : \" Belgian Baron getting out\r\nof train at Savanarilla with us, and walking across the sandy\r\ntrack, and seeing the new train come in.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" Man getting out of a train and looking\r\nfor something. I don't know if he's looking for another\r\ntrain to come. I think it is a sort of dry hot sort of place.\r\nI get him with a faint impression of waxed moustache\r\n\r\na sort of foreign person\u2014but I can't get more.\"\r\nThe \" Belgian Baron,\" never seen by Mr. Murray, had a waxed moustache, \" not mentioned \" by Mrs. Toynbee, as\r\nis noted in the contemporary record.\r\nAugust 24, 19 13.2\r\nSubject. Mrs. Toynbee (agent) : \" I think of Mrs. F. sitting on the deck, and Grandfather opening the door for her.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" This is Grandfather. I think it is on\r\na ship, and I think he is bowing and smiling to some- body\u2014opening the door.\"\r\nMrs. T. \" Can't you get the person ? \"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" I first thought of the Captain, and\r\nafterwards a lady. I get a feeling of a pink head dress.\"\r\nMrs. T. \"Yes, that is right.\"\r\nJanuary 13, 1914. 3\r\nSubject. Mrs. Toynbee (agent): \"I think of that funny old\r\nIrishman called Dr. Hunt in the hotel at Jamaica. I'll think\r\nof the race where they wouldn't let him ride with his little gray mare.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" Tropics. It's\u2014It must [have] something to do with Jamaica. I can't get it a bit clear. I feel as if it were a drunken Irish doctor talking\r\nwith a brogue. I can't get it clear.\"\r\nTo this the contemporary note says that Mrs. Toynbee\r\n\"did not mention he got drunk, but he did.\" 4\r\n1 See Appendix, p. 100. 2 See Appendix, p. 101. 3 See Appendix, p. 105.\r\n4 I omit one other case where Professor Murray got an impression not\r\nof the chosen subject, but of something of which Mrs. Toynbee was, in F\r\n82 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nOnce, although the subject selected was an actual\r\nincident known to both agent and percipient, an incorrect\r\nimpression of the agent's, subsecpiently rectified in her\r\nown mind, was reproduced by the percipient, no mention\r\nhaving been made of this impression. Thus : August 11, 1912.\r\nSubject. Lady Mary Murray (agent) : \" A Glasgow classroom, and the students presenting us with a wedding-present.\"\r\nProfessor Murray. \" Oh, it's Glasgow. It's something\r\ngoing on in the Greek class-room\u2014it's that man, I think\r\n[it] is G , presenting us with the Waverley Novels\r\n[as in fact was the case].\"\r\nThe record notes that the presentation was not in the\r\nGreek class-room, but that Lady Mary Murray first thought\r\nof it as taking place there, but then remembered that this\r\nwas wrong. So that here the agent's first impression\r\nseems to have outweighed the actual knowledge of the\r\npercipient.\r\nOnce certainly, and perhaps twice, Mr. Murray caught\r\nthe thought, not of the principal agent, but of some other\r\nmember of the company. Thus, on December 15, 1910,\r\nhe reported his impression as \" Kangaroos,\" a subject\r\nentirely unconnected with that selected by Mrs. Toynbee,\r\nbut one that had been in the mind of another of the\r\nparty, who thereupon reported that she had been thinking\r\nthat if she were to select she would choose something like a kangaroo, or a bear with a visiting- book, like a recent\r\npicture in Punch; 1 and on June 19, 1915, while giving\r\nan almost complete rendering of the scene chosen, Mr.\r\nMurray thought of the principal figure as a soldier,\r\nwhereas Mrs. Toynbee, the agent, had thought of a woman, while the rest of the company thought of a man,\r\nhaving so interpreted her words \" a friend of the R s who was kicked by a horse and died.\" In this case, if hyperesthesia is admitted, the percipient may have\r\nfact, thinking, because as the subject of her involuntary thoughts was\r\nof recent occurrence\u2014a meeting of the evening before\u2014it may havo\r\nemerged independently from among Professor Murray's thoughts.\r\n1 Soo Appendix, p. 98.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.\" 83\r\nmisinterpreted the words also, but in the former case the\r\nkangaroo or bear had not been mentioned, so that over- hearing cannot account for its introduction.\r\nHere I conclude my presentation to the reader of\r\ntypical cases from among the very interesting records of\r\nthese experiments. My own conclusion is that, after\r\nmaking all possible allowance for occasional assistance\r\nfrom unconscious overhearing by Mr. Murray of voices or actual words, the greater part of the remarkably successful\r\n\" guessing \" is to be ascribed to telepathy, to some\r\nprocess, that is to say, into which the normal senses do\r\nnot enter. It is greatly to be hoped that our President\r\nwill continue his experiments, and that gradually the\r\nconditions may be so modified as to exclude all possibility of auditory perception, conscious or unconscious,\r\nand of aid or even encouragement from contact with the\r\nprincipal agent. Already some progress has been made in\r\nvarying the conditions without thereby introducing a disturbing element ; for instance, at first, Mr. Murray was\r\nrarely successful with a new agent, but in the later\r\nexperiments he has not been \" put off \" in this way.\r\nThus in the last two sets of experiments, December 5 and\r\nDecember 12, 1915, three times subjects were selected by\r\n\" strangers,\" i.e. by persons never before taking part in\r\nthese trials, and in each case there was success, complete\r\nor nearly complete.\r\nIn the earlier series, the success was greatest when Mrs.\r\nA. Toynbee was acting as ostensible agent, the percentage\r\nof complete success when this was the case being 35-7\r\nand of failure (including lack of impression) being 38, as against 33-1 and 39 respectively in the general totals ; and\r\nin the successes and partial successes otherwise obtained\r\nthe agent was usually Lady Mary Murray or Miss Agnes\r\nMurray, thus showing that, for whatever reason, familiarity\r\nbetween agent and percipient was a favourable element.\r\nVarious explanations may be offered for this fact, and\r\namong them must certainly be reckoned the mental\r\nattitude of the agent. The topics chosen by these\r\nmembers of his family have a vividness and actuality,\r\n84 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\na picturesqueness, a detail and often an element of the\r\nfantastic which is lacking in the more sober selections\r\nmade by visitors, less acquainted perhaps with the conditions of previous success. For there is no doubt that\r\nthe fantastic and the unusual specially lends itself to the\r\nsuccessful guessing of Professor Murray, so that future ex- perimenters should think of schoolmasters eating female\r\ncrabs, 1 of actual persons replacing fictitious characters, and\r\nperhaps especially of Russian novels rather than of actual\r\nincidents, \" choses vues,\" or personal experiences, if they\r\nare to have their impressions divined by this percipient.\r\nThis experience is entirely consistent with observations in\r\nother telepathic experiments ; the great difficulty is always to keep alive the interest of the percipient, and\r\nprevent the deadly boredom which comes from thinking\r\nof cards, or numbers, or diagrams, even in the case of\r\npersons whose scientific curiosity induces them to multiply\r\nexperiments capable of \" statistical \" estimate as to success or failure. Such estimates are not to be undervalued, but\r\nwe must deal with the telepathic faculty as we find it,\r\nand where the subjects selected for transmission are as varied, as complex and as distinctive, as they are in the\r\nseries under consideration, there is little or no practical\r\ndifficulty in estimating results, although they cannot be\r\ncompared with what would be produced by chance as they\r\ncan when selected numbers or playing cards are the chosen\r\nsubjects and there is a calculable probability of success. So far as these experiments go, they seem to show that\r\nthe main factor of success, as between agent and percipient, is to be found in the faculty of the percipient.\r\nSeveral attempts were made by Mrs. Toynbee to transfer\r\nher impressions to various other would-be percipients, but\r\nthese in all cases failed. Professor Murray, on the contrary, was successful with a considerable number of agents,\r\nthough it should be remembered that, even when a\r\nstranger was acting as ostensible agent, Lady Mary\r\nMurray or one of Professor Murray's two daughters was\r\npresent and acquainted with the selected subject. But\r\nthe presence of no one of these three individuals was\r\n1 See above, p. 61, and Appendix, p. 109.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing.\" 85\r\nnecessary to success, for success was achieved in the\r\nabsence of each one of them.\r\nInteresting suggestions have been made by Professor\r\nMurray as to the method by which the subconscious impression enters his consciousness ; thus he has noted that it is sometimes by way of a sense-channel (smell, sight, hearing),\r\nsometimes by a specially invented chain of reasoning or\r\nassociation, more often through an undeterminate sense of\r\nquality. The subjective impressions of the percipient as to\r\nmethod are always valuable, and Professor Murray has given\r\nus concrete examples of each of the suggested processes.\r\nBut a considerable familiarity with this type of phenomena,\r\nboth as critic and as percipient, leads me to warn the\r\nreader that, though the subjective impression is no doubt\r\naccurately noted, we must not accept it unchallenged as an explanation of the process. In other words, while we\r\nmay grant, for instance, that the smell of a tarry coal\r\nwhich fell from the fire was the means of translating a subconscious impression into a conscious thought of the\r\nburning of pictures,1 it is not safe to infer that such an\r\nincident is a necessary part of the process. In the unusual\r\ncondition induced by a deliberate desire to plunge below\r\nthe threshold and bring back spoil from the depths, the\r\nmind grasps eagerly after something familiar, and\u2014\r\n\r\nspeak at least of my own sensations\u2014is relieved at\r\nseizing a solid fact, within normal experience, to which it may attach the half-apprehended object of its search.\r\nThe percipient's mind being thus, so to say, on the lookout for such a link, fastens on the falling coal, but had\r\nthe coal not fallen, it is capable of finding some other\r\nlink, or even of forging one. Thus in one of his instances\r\nof a fictitious association of ideas, Professor Murray speaks\r\nof hearing a horse in the road outside : \"I have a noise of\r\nhoofs. I expect it's the noise of hoofs in the street that\r\nmakes me think of it.\" But in the contemporary record of\r\nthe note-taker we read : \" No noise of hoofs in the street.\" 2 In twelve cases the record shows that Mr. Murray\r\nconnected his impression with some external occurrence,\r\n1 See above, p. 59, and Appendix, p. 104.\r\n2 See above, p. 60, and Appendix, p. 92.\r\n86 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nand in all these cases his impression was correct. Sometimes he attributes the emergence of a name to the fact\r\nthat it had been mentioned in conversation shortly before\r\nthe experiments were made. In one of the most striking\r\ncases, that of the dropping of cigar-ash upon a lady's\r\numbrella, 1 he began by remarking that he thought of\r\nDr. So-and-So, \" whom I have been talking about,\" then\r\npassed to the person who dropped the ash, so to the\r\nscene described, and finally to the owner of the umbrella,\r\nwho was the daughter of Dr. So-and-So. Sometimes he\r\nconnects his impression with some act of his own : \" my\r\neyes fell on the dictionary \" ; and he proceeds, correctly, to\r\ndescribe the scene in Vanity Fair where Becky Sharp\r\nthrows Miss Pinkerton's dictionary out of the window of\r\nthe cab. On another occasion, the chosen subject being\r\n\" Gorki working as a ship's boy on a Volga steamer,\" he\r\nsays : \"It seems Russian. It's some Russian writer.- I\r\nshould think it was Gorki,\" and notes : \" I had a feeling\r\nof some one being dirty ; I trod on a dirty sack outside.\" 2\r\nOr, again (March 5, 1914), he begins : \" Oh this is perfectly dreadful\u2014I don't know if it's the cats (cats\r\nwere, in fact, screeching outside the house), there's a sort\r\nof feeling of driving along through dead men and wounded\r\nmen ; it's the horses screaming\u2014oh it's Lady De Lancey\r\ndriving to her husband when he was wounded at Waterloo,\" which was, in fact, the subject chosen. Again, the\r\nsubject being the appearance to Charles I. of the ghost of\r\nStrafford when John Inglesant was the page in waiting,\r\nProfessor Murray approaches the matter by guessing that\r\n\"it is a ghost,\" there being, he notes, a light through the\r\nwindow which suggested a ghost, and so proceeds to\r\ncomplete the picture : \"I should say a sort of cavalier\r\nghost appearing in the evening. I should think it is in a book. Charles I. appearing to anybody\u2014ghost appearing\r\nto Charles I.-\u2014I guess Strafford.\" 3\r\nIn the account which he gave of these experiments in\r\nhis Presidential Address, Mr. Murray expressed the opinion 4\r\n1 See above, p. 59.\r\n3 See Appendix, p. 94.\r\n2 See Appendix, p. 104.\r\n4 See above, p. 61.\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing''' 87\r\nthat \" probably most people could attain the same results\r\nif they practised for a good time and did not get excited\r\nor flurried.\" This assumption may be too liberal, but it\r\nis not at all improbable that the faculty\u2014whatever it be\r\n\r\nwhich Professor Murray displays, is possessed by many people\r\nwho are not aware of possessing it. I hope, therefore,\r\nthat others will be encouraged by the publication of these\r\nrecords to experiment on similar lines. As to the conditions under which such experiments should be conducted,\r\nit is not possible to lay down hard and fast rules. In a\r\ngeneral way it may be said that the stricter the conditions can be made the better, but it is of no use to\r\nimpose ideal conditions at the cost of totally inhibiting\r\nthe desired phenomena. Every experimenter must discover\r\nfor himself on what lines he can obtain the best results,\r\nremembering always that these results will have no\r\nscientific value unless some probable, if not certain, conclusion can be drawn from them. In the case of Professor\r\nMurray's experiments, I think, as I have tried in this report\r\nto show, that we have good evidence of some supernormal\r\nfaculty, probably telepathic, and that the results obtained\r\nare therefore a valuable contribution to psychical research.\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\nThe original records of about a hundred experiments are printed here, so that readers may judge for themselves the\r\nkind of evidence upon which Mrs. Verrall based her conclusions in the foregoing paper. To some extent the selection\r\nwas made at random, but it was influenced by these two\r\nconsiderations : (a) that it was desirable to 'print such cases as were most accurately recorded ; and (b) that the selection\r\nshould illustrate the various theories and suggestions put\r\nforward in Mrs. VerralVs report, which was based on a\r\ncareful study of the whole record.

There were present,\r\nin the study, Lady Mary Murray, Miss Blomfield (who\r\nlxxii.] A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing \"\r\n\r\nAppendix. 107\r\ntook notes), Mr. Arnold Toynbee (who left after the first or second experiment), and myself, besides the two principals.\r\nProfessor Murray went out of the room, and the door\r\nwas shut. Mrs. Toynbee then decided on a subject to\r\ntransfer, and described it in a low voice ; Miss Blomfield\r\nrecorded it, and no other word was spoken. (Once Lady\r\nMary Murray asked if the note was made.) Then Lady\r\nMary Murray opened the door, in silence, and Professor\r\nMurray came in, held Mrs. Toynbee's hand, sometimes\r\nstanding, sometimes sitting, and proceeded to describe his\r\nimpressions.\r\nUsually nothing was said till he had finished all that he\r\nhad to say, but occasionally (as recorded in the notes)\r\nMrs. Toynbee asked for a further detail.\r\nIn the first five experiments the subject was chosen by\r\nMrs. Toynbee ; in the sixth it was also so chosen, but\r\nafter Professor Murray had suggested that I should choose\r\nit ; in the seventh it was chosen by me, and Professor\r\nMurray held my hand.\r\nSo far as I observed, and I observed with care, Professor Murray never looked at Mrs. Toynbee after he had\r\ntaken her hand, nor did she look at him. Any indications\r\nderived from contact must be confined to suggestions\u2014of course unintentional\u2014of encouragement or discouragement,\r\nand no mere encouragement could, as far as yesterday's\r\nexperiments were concerned, account for the success. Professor Murray's descriptions were conveyed in a series of\r\nbrief sentences, but these sentences were not confined to a\r\nsingle idea (to which assent or dissent might be given by\r\nan involuntary response on the part of the agent), nor\r\ndid they proceed from general to particular, or, so far as\r\nI could analyse them, in any regular or calculable sequence.\r\nThe details are as follows :\r\nI. Subject. Mrs. Toynbee (agent) : \" Celia Newbolt under a\r\ngourd-tree at Smyrna.\"\r\nProfessor Murray : \" Modern Greek of some kind\u2014sort of\r\nAsia Minor place\u2014a tree and women sitting under it\r\n\r\na particular tree\u2014girl sitting under it\u2014she does not\r\n108 Mrs. A.

I think the game is Badminton, and the Master of Elibank\r\n[Lord Murray] is there.\"\r\nHere, too, the scene is purely imaginary. Who ' Mr.\r\nS ' is I do not know : Mrs. Toynbee has made a voyage to Panama ; Lord Murray was, as of course we\r\nall knew, to speak yesterday in the House of Lords.\r\nIII. Subject.

I have not\r\nread the book, but I understood from Mrs. Toynbee that\r\nno motive is assigned for the eating of female crabs, nor\r\nis the tearing ' malignant.'\r\nV. Subject. Mrs. Toynbee (agent) : \" Dostoievsky writing in a very bare room, I think in France, and hearing the bailiff people banging at the door, and pretending he is not in the\r\nhouse.\"\r\nProfessor Murray : \" I think this is out of a book\u2014it's Russian\u2014it's a man inside a house\u2014and the people\r\nbeating and beating on the door outside\u2014and he's\r\nkeeping quite still so that they shan't know he is there\u2014it's a big sort of bare room and he is a writer\r\n\r\nseems a mad sort of person\u2014(I) don't somehow feel as\r\nif I was going to get it\u2014I think it is in France\u2014but\r\nhe must be Russian\u2014I don't feel as if they were going\r\nto murder him at all\u2014I should think it is a story of\r\nDostoievsky that I can't get\u2014I have a feeling that I can't be right\u2014Are they bailiffs ? \"\r\nMrs. Toynbee said, when the experiment was over, that\r\nthis was not anything in a book, but a made-up incident.\r\nVI. Professor Murray then suggested that I should\r\nchoose an incident and tell Mrs. Toynbee. But after he\r\n110 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nhad left the room, at an unspoken suggestion, by sign, of\r\nLady Mary Murray's, we decided to pursue the usual plan.\r\nSubject.

In the middle of July he had a few days'\r\nleave at home, and on the 20th returned to the Front.\r\nThe first intimation that I had that anything might\r\nbe going wrong was a message from MyersP through\r\nMrs. Piper in America ; communicated apparently by\r\n\" Richard Hodgson \" at a time when Miss Robbins was\r\npresent, on August 8th, 1915, and sent me by Miss Alta\r\nPiper together with the original. A copy of this script\r\nwas sent by me to my friend Mr. J. Arthur Hill in the\r\nordinary course, and returned endorsed by him. Here\r\nfollows the extract :\r\n{Extract from Mrs. Piper's Script, August 8th, 1915.\r\nMiss Robbins present.)\r\nNotes by Miss Alta L.

Did one 'protect' the other?\"\r\nShe replied at once (September 8th, 1915) referring me\r\nto Horace, Ode II. xvii. 27-30, and saying :\r\nThe reference is to Horace's account of his narrow escape\r\nfrom death, from a falling tree, which he ascribes to the\r\nintervention of Faunus. Cf. Hor. Odes n. xiii ; n. xvii. 27 ; m. iv. 27 ; nr. viii. 8 for references to the subject. The\r\nallusion to Faunus is in Ode n. xvii. 27-30.\r\nMe truncus illapsus cerebro\r\nSustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum\r\nDextra levasset, Mercurialium\r\nCustos virorum.\r\n' Faunus, the guardian of poets ' (' poets ' being the usual\r\ninterpretation of ' Mercury's men '). The passage is a very well-known one to all readers of\r\nHorace, and is perhaps specially familiar from its containing,\r\nin the sentence quoted, an unusual grammatical construction.\r\nIt is likely to occur in a detailed work on Latin Grammar.\r\nThe passage has no special associations for me other than\r\nas I have described, though it has some interest as forming\r\npart of a chronological sequence among the Odes, not generally\r\nadmitted by commentators, but accepted by me. The Avords quoted are, of course, strictly applicable to the\r\nHoratian passage, which they instantly recalled to me.\r\nI perceived, therefore, from this manifestly correct interpretation of the \"Myers\" message to me, that the\r\nmeaning was that some blow was going to fall, or was\r\nlikely to fall, though I didn't know of what kind, and\r\nthat Myers would intervene, apparently to protect me\r\nfrom it. So far as I can recollect my comparatively\r\ntrivial thoughts on the subject, I believe that I had\r\nsome vague idea that the catastrophe intended was\r\nperhaps of a financial rather than of a personal kind ; though, as Mr. Piddington has now reminded me, a falling\r\nH\r\n114 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nor fallen tree is a recognised symbol of death\u2014the symbolism being perhaps derived from a misunderstanding of\r\nEccl. xi. 3.

Raymond was killed near Ypres on the 14th September, 1915, and we got the\r\nnews by telegram from the War Office on September 17th.\r\nSubsequent Enquiries and Comments.\r\nAfter the event had happened, I wrote round to several\r\nscholars, putting to them the same bare question as I had sent to Mrs. Verrall ; my object in doing so being,\r\nnot to obtain additional information, still less to check\r\nMrs. Verrail's detection of the intended reference, of which\r\nI had no doubt whatever, but to ascertain how familiar\r\nthe passage was ; especially in view of her statement\r\nthat it was \" likely to occur in a detailed work on Latin\r\nGrammar.\"\r\nThe question I sent in the following form :\r\nDoes ' The Poet and Faunus ' suggest any obvious reference\r\nto you ? Did one ' protect ' the other ? [Kindly write answer on this page and return to 0. J. L.,\r\nMariemont, Edgbaston. 21 Sept. 1915.]\r\nIt may be worth recording that I addressed this question\r\nto : Mi-. Piddington, Sir Alfred Dale, Professor Sonnenschein, Mr. George Brewerton, Mr. R. C. Gilson, Dr.\r\nG. H. Rendall, Professor H. A. Strong, C. S. Lodge, and\r\nthe Rev. M. A. Bayfield, all of whom replied that the\r\nreference was fairly obvious, and quoted Horace, Ode II. 17.\r\nI sent also to : Gilbert Murray, A. C. Bradley, and\r\nC. C. Cotterill, none of whom happened to think of the\r\nexact passage. Though Professor Murray says it is odd\r\nthat he did not, as it was perfectly familiar to him, only\r\nhe did not happen to get on the right road ; while\r\nProfessor Bradley's reply was that \" There is a wellknown Ode (in. xviii.) in which Horace addresses Faunus,\r\nbut he is not asking for protection or (I should say)\r\naddressing the god as his protector.\" He goes on to\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 115\r\nsay : \"As a matter of fact the name Faunus suggested\r\nto me first a passage in Tennyson's Lucretius 1 (part\r\nbeginning ' But who was he,') ; but no hint of protection\r\nhere. I suppose the passage is suggested by something\r\nin Lucretius's poem, but I don't remember what.\"\r\nSoon after this, I informed Mr. Bayfield fully of the\r\nfacts, as an interesting S.P.R. incident, and he was good\r\nenough to send me a careful note in reply, concerning\r\nthe grammatical peculiarities and exact significance of\r\nthe passage :\r\n1. A Grammatical Explanation:\r\nNormal Latin requires two subjunctives in such a conditional\r\nsentence (sustulisset). There are a fair number of exceptions,\r\nhowever, in passages where we find the indicative (sustulerat)\r\ninstead of the subjunctive. It is like Numbers xxii. 33, \" Unless she had turned from me, surely now I had slain\r\nthee.\" This exceptional use of the indicative is noted in\r\nall school grammars, and this passage of Horace\u2014and one from Virgil's Georgics, n, ' et, si non alium late iactaret odorem,\r\nlaurus erat ' (not esset)\u2014are the two stock examples most\r\ncommonly given. Both are given in the only two school\r\nLatin Grammars that I have. But in these grammars the\r\nexamples are not translated, and probably would not be in\r\nany grammar.\r\n2. A Detailed Interpretation : Horace does not, in any reference to his escape, say clearly\r\nwhether the tree struck him, but I have always thought\r\nit did. He says Faunus lightened the blow ; he does not\r\nsay \" turned it aside.\" As bearing on your terrible loss,\r\nthe meaning seems to be that the blow would fall but would\r\nnot crush ; it would be \" lightened \" by the assurance, conveyed\r\nafresh to you by a special message from the still living Myers,\r\nthat your boy still lives.\r\nI shall be interested to know what you think of this interpretation. The \" protect \" I take to mean protect from being\r\n1 [It is perhaps noteworthy that this Tennysonian poem contains 1 the\r\nwords \" Look ! What is it ? There ? yon arbutus totters,\" immediately after a mention of Faunus ; but it does not seem to be an\r\nallusion to the Horatian episode. O. J. L.]\r\n116 Sir Oliver Lodge. [pabtoverwhelmed by the blow, from losing faith and hope, as we areall in danger of doing when smitten by some crushing personalcalamity. Many a man when so smitten has, like Merlin, lain\r\n\" as dead,\r\nAnd lost to life and use and name and fame.\"\r\nThat seems to me to give a sufficiently precise applicationto the word (on which Myers apparently insists) and to thewhole reference to Horace.\r\nIn a postscript he adds the following :\r\nIn Carm. ill. 8, Horace describes himself as prope funeralus [ arboris ictu, ' well nigh killed by a blow from a tree.' Anartist in expression such as he was woaid not have mentionedany ' blow ' if there had been none ; he would have said' well nigh killed by a falling tree ' \u2014or the like. It is tobe noted that in both passages he uses the word ictus. Andin ii. 13. 11 (the whole ode is addressed to the tree), hesays the man must have been a fellow steeped in everywickedness \" who planted thee, accursed lump of wood, athing (meant) to fall (this is the delicate meaning of caducum\u2014not merely ' falling ') on thine undeserving master's head.\"Here again the language implies that he was struck, andstruck on the head.\r\nIndeed the escape must have been a narrow one, and it\r\nis to me impossible to believe that Horace would have beenso deeply impressed by the accident if he had not actuallybeen struck. He refers to it four times :\r\nCarm. n. 13. (Ode addressed to the tree\u201440 lines long.) n. 17. 27.\r\nin. 4. 27. (Here he jDuts the risk he ran on aparallel with that of the rout at Philipjoi, fromwhich he escaped.)\r\nin. 8. 8.\r\nI insist on all this as strengthening my interpretation,and also as strengthening the assignment of the script toMyers, who would of course be fully alive to all the pointsto be found in his reference to Faunus and Horace,\u2014and, asI have no doubt, believed that Horace did not escape theactual blow, and that it was a severe one.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 117\r\nSince some of the translators, especially verse translators, of Horace convey the idea of turning aside or warding off the blow, it may be well to emphasise the\r\nfact that most of the scholars consulted gave \" lightened \"\r\nor \" weakened,\" as the translation. And Professor Strong\r\nsays, \" no doubt at all that ' levasset ' means ' weakened '\r\nthe blow ; the bough fell and struck the poet, but lightly,\r\nthrough the action of Faunus. ' Levo ' in this sense\r\nis quite common and classical.\"\r\nBryce's prose translation (Bohn) is quite clear : \" a\r\ntree-stem falling on my head had surely been my death,\r\nhad not good Faunus eased the blow \". . . . And although\r\nConington's translation has \" check'd the blow in mid\r\ndescent,\" he really means the same thing, because it is the slaying, not the wounding or striking of the Poet\r\nthat is prevented : \"Me the curst trunk, that smote my skull\r\nHad slain ; but Faunus, strong to shield\r\nThe friends of Mercury (poets), check'd the blow\r\nIn mid descent.\"\r\nOilier pieces of Piper Script.\r\nMr. Bayfield also makes a friendly comment on another\r\nportion of Piper script which I had sent him\u2014a part\r\npurporting to come from Madame Guyon. This comment\r\nis valuable, and I therefore quote it :\r\nI do not understand the last paragraph in your letter,\r\nre the script beginning \" Mine. G.\", though I can see that\r\nit might be a general reference to the losses of those dear\r\nto us which the war causes, and preparatory to the subsequent\r\nmessage to yourself. I should rather say, meant to prepare\r\nyou personally for some possible trouble. . . . In the sentence, \" for the moment, Lodge, have faith and\r\nwisdom [something verbally wrong here] in all that is highest\r\nand best. Have you all not been profoundly guided and\r\ncared for ? \" I find again a sort of attempt to prepare you\r\nfor some personal trouble.\r\nThe portion of \" Piper \" script here referred to by\r\nIIS Sir Oliver Lodge. [partMr. Bayfield, was a bit I had copied in my explanatoryletter to him\u2014a piece of script obtained in Americathree days earlier, viz. on August 5th, 1915 ; whichreached me early in September, simultaneously with thatfragment of the sitting on August 8th, 1915, which hasbeen already quoted verbatim. This script of August 5th\r\nwas automatic script, and is tidily written on full pagesand on both sides of each page ; whereas that of August 8th\r\nis trance script, untidy, and a few words on each page,\r\nin the usual old \"Rector\" manner. The portion extracted\r\nof August 5th is headed, \" Mme. G,\" meaning that MadameGuyon is the communicator, and she says :\r\nClouds arise where evil reigns. But for worldly gain\r\nand greed your world would not be now in such a state\r\nof chaos. Listen to this friends of earth, and try to\r\nprofit by these terrible losses, look more to spiritual\r\nthings, and peace will be your portion. Lodge, Myershas messages good and clear which are coming through.\r\nThrough Willet the message came \" This is such a big\r\nthing and is going to be : it is with difficulty we can\r\nact.\"\r\nA. L. P. This is the message that came through Willett ?\r\n1\r\nYes. For the moment Lodge have faith and wisdomin all that is highest and best, have you all not been\r\nprofoundly guided and cared for, can you answer No ?\r\nIt is by your faith that all is well and has been.\r\nThen follows a bad drawing of the rosary symbolic of\r\nMadame Guyon, with her usual signature.\r\nI remember being a little struck by the wording in\r\nthe above script, urging me to admit that we all\r\npresumably the family\u2014had \" been profoundly guided\r\nand cared for,\" and \" that all is well and has been \"\r\n; because it seemed to indicate that something was not\r\ngoing to be quite so well. But it was too indefinite\r\nto lead me to make any careful record of it, or to send\r\nit as a prediction to anybody ; and it would no doubt\r\nhave evaporated from my mind except for the \" Faunus \"\r\nwarning, given three clays later though received at the\r\n1 No such message is known.

F. A. L.) and I were staying for six weeks.\r\nI have not a record of the date when they arrived,\r\nbut it must have been at the beginning of September,\r\nfor I have the record of my letter of acknowledgment\r\nto Miss Alta Piper, which was written after I had had\r\ntime to write to and receive a prompt answer, September\r\n8th, from Mrs. VerraU. My letter to Alta Piper ran\r\nas follows : The Linga Private Hotel,\r\nGullane, East Lothian,\r\n12 Sept. 1915.\r\nMy Dear Alta,\r\nThe reference to the Poet and Fannus in your\r\nmother's last script is quite intelligible, and a good classical\r\nallusion. You might tell the communicator some time if\r\nthere is opportunity.\r\nI feel sure that it must convey nothing to you and yours.\r\nThat is quite as it should be, as you know, for evidential\r\nreasons.\r\nThis was written two days before Raymond's death, and\r\nfive days before we heard of it.\r\nIt so happens that this letter was returned to me for\r\nsome reason through the Dead Letter Office, reaching\r\nme on November 14th, 1915, and being then sent forward\r\nby me again.\r\nI also wrote to Mrs. Piper to know if the message\r\nabout Faunus and the Poet meant anything to her or\r\nher daughters, though 1 felt sure it didn't. She replies :\r\nThe message to which you refer is quite foreign to me.\r\nI have no recollection of ever having seen it or reading it\r\nin the Proceedings.\r\nShe admits, however, having read a good deal of the\r\nProceedings of the S.P.R., but as far as I know and\r\nhave been able to ascertain, no reference to this Ode, nor even to Faunus, has appeared in the Proceedings.\r\n120 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nHence it seems to me that on the evidential side the\r\nevidence is perfect.\r\nA little later, September 22nd\u2014before I or any member\r\nof the family had had any sitting or attempted communication, and before I knew anything of Myers's assistance\r\nor friendly activity, as described in the sequel\u2014I wrote to\r\nAlta thus : Whew you next have an opportunity, you might take this\r\nmessage from me to Myers : namely this \u2014\" that he did not\r\nturn aside the falling trunk with his right hand.\" You\r\nmight further ask him whether he tried to do so, or whether\r\nhe was making reference to something still in the future.\r\nThis was intended to show \" Myers \" that the allusion\r\nhad been understood, and at the same time to convey\r\nnothing whatever to the Piper family ; for I did not\r\neither explicitly or implicitly associate this sentence\r\nin any way with their \" Faunus \" message : and, even\r\nif I had, they would not have understood. I sent this\r\nbefore I had had Mr. Bayfield's more scholarly and\r\ndetailed interpretation of the word \" levasset,\" which\r\nsignifies \" lightened \" rather than \" warded off.\"\r\nOn February 11th, 1916, I noted that at that date I\r\nhad had no reply from America to this message ; and that\r\nmany letters had been sunk. But on May 10th, 1916,\r\nthe following information concerning the reception in\r\nAmerica of my reply to the Faunus message reached me\r\nfrom Miss Alta Piper :\r\n(Mrs. Pipers Script, 12th January, 1916.

I ought to explain here\r\nthat the junior members of my family have not hitherto\r\nbeen interested in any kind of psychical subject, and had\r\nnever either been to a medium or thought of going to one. Their attitude was in fact healthily sceptical ; they never\r\nread S.P.R. Proceedings, and they for the most part probably\r\nignored rather than criticised my work in that direction.\r\nIt may be objected that my own general appearance\r\nis known or might be guessed. But that does not\r\napply to members of my family, who went quite anonymously to private sittings kindly arranged for in London\r\neither by Mr. J. Arthur Hill or by friends in London, Dr.\r\nand Mrs. Kennedy, whose own personal experience caused\r\nthem to be sympathetic and helpful ; and specially careful\r\nabout evidence.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survived. 125\r\nThe very first sitting of this kind that was held after\r\nRaymond's death was held not explicitly for the purpose\r\nof getting into communication with him, still less with\r\nany remotest notion of finding out anything concerning\r\nMr. Myers, but mainly because a French widow lady,\r\nwho had been kind to our daughters during winters in\r\nParis, was staying with my wife and was in terrible\r\ndistress at the loss of both her beloved sons in the\r\nwar, within a week of each other, so that she was left\r\nquite desolate. To comfort her my wife took her up\r\nto London to a sitting kindly arranged for September 24\r\nby Mrs. Kennedy, who knew and recommended a certain\r\nmedium, here called Mrs. A. Incidentally I may say that\r\nthe two sons of Madame communicated on this and on\r\nanother soon following occasion, though with difficulty ; that one of them gave his name completely, the other\r\napproximately ; and that the mother, who was new to\r\nthe whole subject, was partially consoled. Raymond, however, was represented as coming with them and helping\r\nthem, and as sending some messages on his own account\r\n;\r\nbut I shall here quote only those messages which bear\r\nupon the subject of Myers or have any possible connexion\r\nwith the Faunus message.\r\nEvidential Messages obtained in England, referring\r\nto Raymond and Myers.\r\nAs a kind of sequel to the ' Faunus ' episode, it will\r\nbe convenient now to quote early references to Myers\r\nwhich came through in sittings held soon after Raymond's\r\ndeath, so as to note whether there is any indication,\r\nobtained through entirely distinct channels, that Myers\r\ntook an interest in him, and was doing anything to\r\nhelp him and me, as virtually promised in the ' Faunus '\r\nmessage sent to me through Mrs. Piper in America, on\r\n8th August, and received early in September, 1915.\r\nI shall only extract here the relevant portions, detached\r\nfrom the context : the complete record in each case is kept in its proper place in the series of sittings\r\narranged according to date. Most of the first two records\r\n12G Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nconsisted of messages to or for the French lady from her\r\nsons.\r\n1 We heard first of Raymond's death on 17th September,\r\n1915; and on the 25th September his mother (M. F. A. L.)\r\nwho was having her second anonymous sitting for the\r\nFrench lady mentioned above, had the following spelt out\r\nby tilts of a table, as purporting to come from Raymond :\r\nTell father I have met some friends of his. m. f. a. l. Can you give any name ? Yes Myers\r\n.\r\nThat was all on that subject on that occasion.\r\nOn Monday, 27th September, 1915, I myself went\r\nto London and had my first sitting, between noon and\r\none o'clock, with Mrs. A. I went to her house or flat alone, as a complete stranger for whom an appointment\r\nhad been made through Mrs. Kennedy. Before we began,\r\nMrs. A. informed me that her ' guide ' or ' control ' was\r\na young girl. I had been told of this before, so I said\r\nthat I had heard of this control.\r\nIn a short time, a youth was described in terms which\r\ndistinctly suggested Raymond, and the control brought\r\nmessages. I extract the following :\r\n(From First Sitting of 0. J. L. with Airs. A.\r\n21th September, 1915.)\r\nHe finds it difficult, he says, but he has got so many kind friends helping him. He didn't think\r\nwhen he waked up first that he was going to be\r\nhappy, but now he is, and he says lie is going to\r\nbe happier. He knows that as soon as he is a\r\nlittle more ready, he has got a great deal of work\r\nto do. ' I almost wonder,' he says, ' shall I be\r\nfit and able to do it. They tell me I shall.'\r\n1 As this French lady, hardly ever in England, was obviously a\r\ncomplete stranger, not only to the medium but to Mrs. Kennedy also,\r\nI now perceive that the messages to her had rather a special evidential\r\nsignificance, neutralising the forced and unnatural hypothesis of collusion.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 127\r\no. j. l. Good !\r\n' I have instructors and teachers with me.' Now he\r\nis trying to build up a letter of some one ; M he\r\nshows me,\r\nA short time later he said :\r\n' People think I say I am happy in order to make\r\nthem happier, but I don't. 1 I have met hundreds\r\nof friends. I don't know them all. I have met\r\nmany who tell me that, a little later, they will\r\nexplain why they are helping me. I feel I have\r\ngot two Fathers now. I don't feel I have lost one and got another ; I have got both. I have\r\ngot my old one and another too\u2014a pro tern father.'\r\n(Here the control ejaculated ' What's that ? Is that\r\nright ?\r\n' 0. J. L., chuckling, replied ' Yes.')\r\nThere is a weight gone off his mind the last day or two ; he feels brighter and lighter and happier\r\naltogether, the last few days. There was confusion\r\nat first. He could not get his bearings, didn't\r\nseem to know where he was. ' But I was not very\r\nlong,' he says, ' and I think I was very fortunate ;\r\nit was not very long before it was explained to\r\nme where I was.'\r\nBut the most remarkable indirect allusion, or apparent\r\nallusion, to the ' Faunus ' message, came at the end of\r\nthe sitting, after \" Raymond \" had gone, and just before\r\nMrs. A. came out of trance : He is gone, but [the control] sees something which is only symbolic ; she sees a cross falling back on to you ; very\r\ndark, falling on to you ; dark and heavy looking ; and as it\r\nfalls it gets twisted round and the other side seems all light,\r\nand the light is shining all over you. It is a sort of pale\r\nblue, but it is white, and quite light when it touches you.\r\nYes, that is what [the control] sees. The cross looked dark,\r\n1 This is reminiscent of a sentence in one of his letters home from\r\nthe Front : \" As cheerful and well and happy as ever. Don't think\r\nI am having a rotten time\u2014I am not.\" Date 11th May, 1915 (really\r\n12th). O. J. L.\r\n128 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nand then it suddenly twisted round and became a beautiful\r\nlight. The cross is a means of shedding real light. It is going to help a great deal.\r\nDid you know you had a coloured Guide ? . . . He says\r\nyour son is the cross of light ; he is the cross of light, and\r\nhe is going to be a light that will help you ; he is going to\r\nhelp too to prove to the world the Truth. That is why they\r\nbuilt up the dark cross that turned to bright. You know ; but others, they do so want to know. [The control] is losing\r\nhold ; goodbye.\r\n{From First Anonymous Sitting of M. F.

My message to Myers was\r\nto the effect that I understood about Faunus and the\r\nPoet, and that Myers might say something more about it\r\n;\r\nand the only point of interest about the reply or comment is that the two following sentences were spelled\r\nout, as purporting to come either indirectly or directly\r\nfrom ' Myers,'\r\n\r\n(1) \"He says it meant your sons transition ).\"\r\n(2) \" Your son shall be mine.\"\r\nThe next \" Myers \" reference seems to be on the 29th\r\nOctober, 1915, when I (0. J. L.) had a sitting unexpectedly\r\nand unknown to my family with Mr. Z., a sitting arranged\r\nfor me by Mr. J. Arthur Hill as for an anonymous friend.\r\nMr. Z.'s chief control appeared, and after some communications, gave messages from a youth who was\r\nidentified as my son, some of which ran as follows :\r\n(Z. Sitting of 0. J. L. on 29th October, 1915.)\r\nYour commonsense method of approaching the\r\nsubject in the family, has been the means of\r\nhelping him to come back as he as been able\r\nto do ; and had he not known what you had\r\ntold him, then it would have been far more\r\ndifficult for him to come back.

Can you understand ? \"\r\no. J. L. Yes. (Meaning that I supposed it represented a mood in which he thought poorly of its meetings.\r\nBut how much of all this represents a latent\r\nopinion of the medium, need not be discussed).\r\nNow the boy says, \"he helped me because, with\r\nme through you, he can break away the dam\r\nthat people have set up. Later on, you are going to speak to them. It is already on the\r\nprogramme, and you will break down the opposition because of me.\" Then he says, \"For God's\r\nsake, Father, do it.

I now propose to make some further extracts\r\nof a more evidential character\u2014tending to establish\r\nthe survival of my son's own personality and memory.\r\nThere have been several of these evidential episodes,\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 133\r\nmaking strongly in this direction ; but I select, for\r\ndescription here, one relating to a certain group photograph which we were told of through two mediums, but of\r\nwhich we normally knew nothing till afterwards.\r\nRaymond was killed on the 14th of September, 1915.\r\nThe first reference to a photograph taken of him with\r\nother men was made by Mr. Z. at M. F. A. L.'s first sitting with Z. in Mrs. Kennedy's house, on 27th September, 1915, thus :\r\n(Extract from M. F. A. L.'s Anonymous Sitting with\r\nMr. Z. on September 21th, 1915.)\r\nYou have several portraits of this boy. Before he went\r\naway you had got a good portrait of him\u2014two\u2014no, three.\r\nTwo where he is alone and one where he is in a group of\r\nother men. He is particular that I should tell you of this.\r\nIn one you see his walking-stick\u2014 (The control here put an imaginary stick under his arm.)\r\nWe had single photographs of him of course, and in\r\nuniform, but we did not know of the existence of a photograph in which he was one of a group, and M. F. A. L.\r\nwas sceptical about it, thinking that it might well be\r\nonly a shot or guess on the part of the medium at something probable. But Mrs. Kennedy (as Note-taker) had\r\nwritten down most of what was said, and this record was\r\nkept, copied, and sent to Mr. Hill in the ordinary course\r\nat the time. M. F. A. L. describes herself as feeling\r\nsomewhat ' ashamed ' of what seemed palpably a mere\r\nguess.\r\nI was myself, however, rather impressed with the\r\nemphasis laid on it\u2014\" he is particular that I should tell you of this \" \u2014and accordingly made a half-hearted enquiry\r\nor two ; but nothing more was heard on the subject\r\nfor two months. On Monday, November 29th, however,\r\na letter came from Mrs. Cheves, a stranger to us, mother\r\nof Captain Cheves of the R.A.M.C., who had known\r\nRaymond and had reported to us concerning the nature\r\nof his wound, and who, I hope, is still continuing good\r\n134 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nwork at the Front. Mrs. Cheves' welcome letter, dated\r\nNovember 28th, 1915, ran as follows : My son, who is M.O. to the 2nd South Lanes, has sent us a group of officers taken in August, and I wondered whether\r\nyou knew of this photo and had had a copy. If not may\r\nI send you one, as we have half a dozen and also a key ?\r\nI hope you will forgive my writing to ask this, but I have\r\noften thought of you and felt so much for you in your great sorrow.\r\nM. F. A. L. at once wrote, enthusiastically thanking\r\nher, and asking for it ; but fortunately it was not sent\r\nthen.\r\nBefore it came I (0. J. L.) was having a sitting with\r\nMrs. A. alone at her house on December 3rd, and on\r\nthis occasion, among other questions, I asked carefully\r\nconcerning the photograph, wishing to get more detailed\r\ninformation about it before it was seen. And the answers were thus reported and recorded at the time\u2014the typing\r\nout of the sitting being all done before the photograph\r\narrived.

[While this is being written out, the above\r\nremains true. The photograph has not yet\r\ncome.]\r\nHe has the impression of about a dozen on it. A dozen, he says, if not more. [The control]\r\nthinks it must be a big photograph.\r\nNo, he doesn't think so, he says they were grouped\r\nclose together,\r\no. J. l. Did he have a stick ?\r\n13G Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nHe doesn't remember that. He remembers that\r\nsomebody wanted to lean on him, but he is not sure if he was taken with some one\r\nleaning on him. But somebody wanted to\r\nlean on him he remembers. The last what\r\nhe gave you, what were a B, will be rather\r\nprominent in that photograph. It wasn't taken\r\nin a photographer's place.\r\nWas it out of doors ? Yes, practically.\r\n(The control sotto voce): What you mean, 'yes\r\npractically '\r\n; must have been out of doors or not out of doors. You mean 'yes,' don't you ? [The control] thinks he means 'yes,' because\r\nhe says ' practically.'\r\nIt may have been a shelter.\r\nIt might have been. Try to show [the control].\r\nAt the back he shoAvs me lines going down.\r\nIt looks like a black back-ground, with lines\r\nat the back of them. (The control here kept\r\ndrawing vertical lines in the air.)\r\nThere was, for some reason, considerable delay in the\r\narrival of the photograph ; it did not arrive till the\r\nafternoon of December 7th. Meanwhile, on December\r\n6th, Lady Lodge had been looking up Raymond's Diary,\r\nwhich had been returned from the Front with his kit, and\r\nfound an entry on August 24th, \" Photo taken.\" (A\r\nstatement will follow to this effect.)\r\nNow Raymond had only had one \"leave\" home since\r\ngoing to the Front, and this leave was from July 16th\r\nto the 20th ; hence the photograph had not been taken\r\nthen, and so he could not have told us anything about\r\nit, nor did he make any mention of it in letters. The\r\nexposure was only made 21 days before his death, and\r\nsome days may have elapsed before he saw a print,\r\nif he ever saw one. He certainly never mentioned it\r\nin his letters. We were therefore in complete ignorance\r\nconcerning it ; and only recently had we normally become\r\naware of its existence.\r\no. J. L.\r\no. J. L.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 137\r\nOn the morning of December 7th, another note came\r\nfrom Mrs. Cheves, in answer to a question about the\r\ndelay ; and this letter said that the photograph was\r\nbeing sent off. Accordingly 0. J. L., thinking that the\r\nphotograph might be coming at once, dictated a letter\r\nto Mr. Hill, recording roughly his impression of what the\r\nphotograph would be like, on the strength of the communication received by him through Mrs. A. ; and this\r\nwas posted by A. E. Briscoe about lunch-time on the\r\nsame day. (See statement by Mr. Briscoe at the end.)\r\nThe statement by 0. J. L. to Mr. Hill ran thus :\r\nConcerning that photograph which Raymond mentioned\r\nthrough Z. [saying this : \" One where he is in a group of\r\nother men. He is particular that I should tell you of this.\r\nIn one you see his walking stick.\" 1\r\n], he has said some more\r\nabout it through Mrs. A. But he is doubtful about the\r\nstick. What he says is that there is a considerable number\r\nof men in the photograph ; that the front row is sitting, and\r\nthat there is a back row, or some of the people, grouped and\r\nset up at the back ; also that there are a dozen or more\r\npeople in the photograph, and that some of them he hardly\r\nknew ; that a B is prominent in the photograph, and that\r\nthere is also a C ; that he himself is sitting down, and that\r\nthere are people behind him, one of whom either leant on his\r\nshoulder, or tried to. The photograph has not come yet, but it may come any\r\nday now ; so I send this off before I get it. The actual record of what was said in the sitting is being\r\ntyped, but the above represents my impression of it. The photograph was delivered at Mariemont between\r\n3 and 4 p.m. on the afternoon of December 7th. It was\r\na wet afternoon, and the package was received by my\r\ndaughter Rosalynde, who took the wet wrapper off it. Her mother, to whom it was addressed, was resting, and\r\ndid not see it till after tea, after Mrs. Isaac Thompson\r\nhad arrived on a visit. About 7 o'clock, M. F. A. L.\r\nbrought it into the study to show me, together with\r\n1 This bit not written to J. A. H., but is copied from Z.'s sitting for convenience.\r\n138 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nthe \" key \" which Mrs. Cheves had sent showing who\r\nthe different people were. I deferred its examination\r\ntill later in the evening, after I had done my letters.\r\nConsidered as a photograph of Raymond it is bad,\r\nbut considered from the point of view of evidence it is good. For on examining the photograph, we found that\r\nevery peculiarity mentioned by Raymond, unaided by the\r\nmedium, was strikingly correct. The walking-stick is there, but Z. had put a stick under his arm (which is not correct), and in connection with the back-ground\r\nMrs. A.'s control had, by gesture, emphasised vertical\r\nlines. There are six prominent nearly vertical lines on\r\nthe roof of the shed, but the horizontal lines in the background generally are equally conspicuous.\r\nBy \" a mixed lot,\" we understood members of different\r\nCompanies\u2014not all belonging to Raymond's Company, but\r\na collection from several. This must be correct, as they\r\nare too numerous for one Company. It is probable that they\r\nall belong to one Regiment, except perhaps one, whose cap\r\nseems to have a thistle badge instead of three feathers.\r\nAs to \" prominence,\" I have asked several people\r\nwhich member of the group seemed to them the most\r\nprominent, and except as regards central position, a welllighted standing figure on the right has usually been pointed\r\nto as most prominent. This one is a \" B \" as stated.\r\nSome of the officers must have been barely known to\r\nRaymond, while some were his friends. Officers whose\r\nnames begin with B, with C, and with R, were among\r\nthem ; there was not any name beginning with K,\r\nbut there is a name beginning with a hard C.\r\nSome of the group are sitting while others are standing\r\nbehind. Raymond is one of the sitting, and his walkingstick or regulation cane is lying across his feet.\r\nThe back-ground is dark, and is conspicuously lined.\r\nIt is out of doors, close in front of a shed or military\r\nhut, pretty much as suggested to me by the statements\r\nmade in the Mrs. A. Sitting\u2014what I called a \" shelter.\"\r\nBut by far the most striking piece of evidence, is the fact that some one sitting behind Raymond is leaning\r\nor resting a hand on his shoulder. The photograph\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 130\r\nfortunately shows the actual occurrence, and almost indicates that Raymond was rather annoyed with it ; for\r\nhis face is a little screwed up, and his head has been\r\nslightly bent to one side out of the way of the man's\r\narm. It is the only case in the photograph where one man is leaning or resting his hand on the shoulder of\r\nanother, and I judge that it is a thing not unlikely to\r\nbe remembered by the one to whom it occurred.\r\n[Added later] : In answer to an enquiry, Mrs. Cheves\r\nwrote to us on December 10th saying that she was\r\nunable to tell us anything about that photograph, that\r\nher son had ordered them to be sent to her just as they\r\nwere, and that she did not have it enlarged ; also that\r\nshe would write and ask him to tell us all he knew\r\nabout it. I wrote at the same time to Gale & Polden,\r\nof Aldershot, the photographers whose name is printed\r\nat the foot of the photograph, asking them to send me\r\nfurther particulars, and, if possible, extra copies.\r\nI thus obtained prints of all the accessible photographs\r\nwhich had been taken at the same time. The size of\r\nthese prints was 5 by 7. I found that the group had been repeated, with slight\r\nvariations, three times \u2014the officers all in the same relative\r\npositions but not in identically the same attitudes.\r\nOne of them is the same as the one we had seen, with\r\nCaptain S.'s hand resting on Raymond's shoulder, and\r\nRaymond's head leaning a little on one side, as if rather\r\nannoyed.\r\nIn another the hand had been removed, being supported\r\nby Captain S.'s stick ; and in that one Raymond's head\r\nis upright. This corresponds to his uncertainty as to\r\nwhether he was actually taken with the man leaning on\r\nhim or not.\r\nIn a third variation, however, Captain S.'s leg rests\r\non or touches Raymond's shoulder, and the slant of\r\nthe head and slight look of annoyance have returned.\r\nAs to the evidential value of the whole communication,\r\nit will be observed that there is something of the nature\r\n140 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nof cross-correspondence, of a simple kind, in the fact\r\nthat a reference to the photograph was made by one\r\nmedium, and details given by another in answer to a question which I asked about it : the communicator\r\nshowing that he was aware that the previous reference\r\nhad been made through another channel. (See report\r\nabove, page 134.)\r\nAnd the elimination of ordinary telepathy from the\r\nliving, except under the far-fetched hypothesis of the\r\nunconscious influence of complete strangers, was exceptionally complete ; inasmuch as the whole of the information was recorded before any of us had seen the\r\nphotograph.\r\nChronological Summary.\r\nJuly 20th, 1915.\r\nAugust 24th, 1915.\r\nSeptember 14th, 1915.\r\nSeptember 21th, 1915.\r\nOctober 15th, 1915.\r\nNovember 29th, 1915.\r\nDecember 3rd, 1915.\r\nDecember 6th, 1915.\r\nRaymond's last visit home.\r\nPhotograph taken at the Front\r\n(as shown by Raymond's private diary) but not mentioned by him.\r\nRaymond's death.\r\nMr. Z.'s control's mention of\r\nthe photograph.\r\nNegatives sent from France\r\nto Gale & Polden for re- production.\r\nMrs. Cheves wrote spontaneously, saying that she\r\nhad a group-photograph of\r\nsome 2nd South Lancashire\r\nOfficers, which she could send\r\nif desired.\r\nMrs. A.'s control's further description of a photograph\r\nwhich had been mentioned\r\nthrough another medium.\r\nM.

That would be about 6.0. Mrs. Thompson,\r\nLorna, and Barbara, now also saw it. Honor was not at\r\nhome and did not see it till later.\r\n(Signed) R. V. Lodge.\r\n8th December, 1915.\r\nMr. Alfred Cresswell, of the Edgbaston Meteorological\r\nObservatory, has now kindly supplied me with the record\r\nof his automatic rain gauge for the day on which the\r\nphotograph arrived\u2014Tuesday, 7th December, 1915.\r\nThe curve shows that at 1.30 p.m. rainfall began, that\r\nby 2 p.m., three-hundredths of an inch had fallen, and\r\nthat rain continued without ceasing till 9 p.m. ; by\r\nwhich time four-tenths of an inch had fallen.\r\nSo it was clearly a wet afternoon, in accordance with\r\nthe above testimony on pages 137 and 142.\r\nRemarks on the Photographs by J. A. H.\r\nThank you very much for sight of the 3 photographs.\r\nThe vertical lines at the back struck me at once, and, remembering that one man was said to be \" prominent,\" but with no recollection further, I looked for the man who seemed\r\nmost so, and at once fixed on the man standing up on the\r\nextreme right, probably because of the strong light on his\r\nshoulder. Then re-reading the account I find that this is Capt. Boast, fitting in with the prominent man whose name\r\nbegins with B. The whole case is excellent.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 143\r\nNormal Information about the Photograph.\r\nExtract from a letter by Captain Sydney T. Boast from the Trenches, dated 7 May, 1916, to Mrs. Case, and lent me to see.\r\nSome months ago (last summer) the Officers of our Battalion\r\nhad their photo taken. . . . You see the photographer who\r\ntook us was a man who had been shelled out of house and\r\nhome, and as he had no means of doing the photos for us, we bought the negatives, and sent them along to be finished\r\nin England.\r\nLetter to 0. J. L. from the Photographers to whom the\r\nNegatives had been sent by Captain Boast.\r\nAldershot, 1 July, 1916. \" With further reference to your letter, we have looked\r\ninto this matter and we find that we received the negatives\r\nfrom Captain Boast on the 15th October, 1915. We did not\r\nsend any set of prints out to the Front to Captain Boast,\r\nalthough we had a great many orders sent in to us by the\r\nvarious Officers for copies to be sent to addresses in England.\r\nWe think, however, that they must have seen prints of these\r\nbefore the negatives were sent to us.\"\r\n(Signed) Gale & Polden.\r\nLetter from Captain Boast to 0. J. L.\r\nIn answer to a special enquiry addressed to Captain\r\nBoast at the Front, he has been good enough to favour\r\nme with the following letter :\r\n10 July, 1916.\r\nDear Sir,\r\nYour letter of the 4th July has just reached me. The proofs of the photographs referred to were received by\r\nme from the photographer at Reninghelst, two or three days\r\nafter being taken. To the best of my belief your son saw\r\nthe proofs, but I cannot now say positively. I obtained\r\nparticulars of recpiirements from the officers forming the\r\n144 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\ngroup, but the photographer then found he was unable to\r\nobtain paper for printing. I therefore bought the negatives\r\nand sent them home to Gale and Poklen. In view of the\r\nfact that your son did not go back to the trenches till 12 Sept.\r\n1915, it is highly probable that he saw the proofs, but he\r\ncertainly did not see the negatives.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n(Signed) Sydney T. Boast.\r\nWe thus learn :\r\n(a) That the photographs were developed in France and\r\na proof shown to some officers ; though whether Raymond\r\nwas one who saw the proofs is uncertain. Captain Boast\r\nthinks that he probably saw a proof, but could not\r\npossibly have had a print to send home.\r\n(b) That the date on which the negatives were bought\r\nand sent home for reproduction was such that they did\r\nnot reach the firm in England till October 15th, which\r\nwas long after the date (September 27th) when a group\r\nphotograph was mentioned to me through the medium\r\nMr. Z.\r\nThe photographs are only shown here because of their\r\nevidential interest. Considered as likenesses of Raymond,\r\nthey are exceptionally bad ; he appears shrunk into an\r\nuncomfortable position.\r\nConcluding Note.\r\nNote that the establishment of a date in August for\r\nthe taking of the photograph, as mentioned first in Mrs.\r\nCheves' letter and now confirmed, is important, because\r\nthe last time we ever saw Raymond was in July.\r\nTo my mind the whole incident is rather exceptionally\r\ngood as a piece of evidence ; and that \" Raymond \"\r\nexpected it to be good evidence, is plain from Z.'s control's statement, at that first reference to a photograph\r\non 27th September, viz. \"He is particular that I should\r\ntell you of this.\" This sentence it probably was which\r\nmade me look out for such a photograph, and take pains\r\nto get records soundly made beforehand.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 145\r\nIn most evidence there is some flaw. There may be one in this, but I have not yet discovered it. Our complete ignorance, even of the existence of the photograph,\r\nin the first place, and secondly the gradual manner in\r\nwhich the details normally came to our knowledge,\r\nso that we were able to make provision for getting\r\nthe supernormally acquired details definitely noted\r\nbeforehand, seem to me to make it a first class case. While as to the amount of coincidence between the\r\ndescription and the actual photograph, that surely is quite\r\nbeyond chance or guess-work. For not only are many\r\nthings right, but practically nothing is wrong.\r\nAdditional Note about the Photographs.\r\nThe admittedly unlikely suggestion has been made\r\nthat one or other of the mediums may possibly have\r\nseen these photographs before anything was said about\r\nthem to us. In the case of Mr. Z. the information\r\ngiven definitely negatives this suggestion ; for the negatives\r\ndid not arrive in this country till October 15th, while\r\nZ.'s first mention of such a photograph was on September\r\n27th.\r\nIn the case of Mrs. A. I have seen her and catechised\r\nboth her and her control. The answers, very honestly\r\ngiven, are as follows : First from Mrs. A. in ordinary state and quite normal.\r\nSecond from Mrs. A.'s control, i.e. from Mrs. A.\r\nin the entranced condition, when the control\r\nappears to have knowledge and memory separate\r\nfrom her own.\r\nCatechising of Mrs. A. by O. J. L. Ylth July, 1916.\r\nQuestion. Do you remember in any of your sittings having seen photographs of Officers ? Answer. Yes, a lady called W brought a photograph\r\nof her husband,\u2014I think it was a head and\r\nshoulders. She comes from Birmingham. Quite a young lady.\r\nK\r\n146 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nQuestion. Did anyone bring a group photograph ? Answee. No, I don't think they have. No, I don't remember\r\nanyone bringing a group photograph. No, I can't\r\nrecollect having seen one at all. Question. I don't mean from Birmingham ? Answer. No, I don't remember anybody bringing a group.\r\nSometimes people bring little parcels, and keep\r\nthem on their knee, but they don't often show\r\nthem to me.\r\nQuestion. Have you seen a group of officers at all ? Answer. No, I don't think so\u2014I don't remember any group.\r\nAs a rule, people don't show me their photographs, they have one wrapped up sometimes,\r\nbut they very seldom show them to me.\r\nQuestion. Do you ever hear of Papers read at meetings of\r\nthe S.P.R. ? Answer. Oh, you mean the Psychical Society ? Yes, a Mrs.\r\n[B.] told me that she had just come from one where you mentioned me and [my control]. She\r\nonly told me the fact, and not any particulars\r\nshe knew I should be pleased.\r\nCatechising of Mrs. A.'s Control by O. J. L.\r\n\\<dth July, 1916.\r\n[Speaking to the control] When people sit with you,\r\ndo they ever bring photographs to show you ? Yes, they do, sometimes. But [I] can't see them.\r\n[I] don't want them to bring them, it doesn't\r\nhelp a bit. It's foolish to bring them, not many\r\npeople do.\r\nDo they ever bring a photograph of a group of\r\npeople ? No, they bring photograph of one person, the one they want to talk to. Sometimes it's a big one\r\nof the people they want to get at. But [I] can't\r\nsee it, and it doesn't help.\r\nBut do they ever bring a group photograph, and\r\nask you to pick the one out ? No, 1 1 | can't remember that they have ever done that.\r\nO. J. L.\r\nO. J. L.\r\nO. J. L.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 147\r\nNo, [I've] never seen a photograph of a lot of\r\npeople. It's just one they bring, and it's silly\r\nto bring them, 'cos [I] can't see them,\r\no. J. l. Very well, Raymond will understand why I ask this.\r\nYes, he says he understands perfectly,\r\no. j. l. Ask him did he ever see a print of the photograph ? He says he didn't. He can't remember that he did.\r\no. J. L. Were they developed out there ? No, he doesn't even think they were developed. He\r\ndoesn't remember,\r\no. J. l. But if he never saw the prints, how did he know\r\nwhat they looked like 1 He says, only because he knew how they was taken,\r\no. j. l. Yes, but he said something about a dark background\r\nwith lines ? Yes, he means he knew exactly what it would look\r\nlike, because he see'd it himself,\r\no. j. l. And then he said that one would come out prominent.\r\n([The control, sotto voce] : it wasn't you.)\r\nNo, he says, it wasn't him. No, he says, he didn't\r\nsee it. He can't remember seeing any print\r\nat all.\r\no. j. l. Well, Raymond, the photographer seems to have\r\nbeen shelled out of house and home, perhaps\r\nthat's why he couldn't do them.\r\nOh, he didn't know that till after.\r\nHe knows it's all very important, because it does\r\naway with telepathy. But he can't remember\r\nseeing even a proof,\r\no. j. l. Was it a captain that had the photographs taken ? Yes, he says. Somebody else was keener than ho_\r\nwas, but he had the most say about it. [Meaning\r\nthe captain.]\r\no. j. l. Was he the prominent man ? Yes.\r\no. j. l. Did he arrange things, and then go and stick himself\r\nthere ? He's not sure. He says, I don't want to spoil a good thing by trying to remember something when\r\nI'm hazy about it.\r\n148 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nI have no reason to suppose that Mrs. A. in her normal\r\nconsciousness knows anything about the photograph.\r\nI have not told her of it, nor have I shown it her.\r\nNor have I mentioned the matter any further to her\r\ncontrol. When this is published, if she ever reads the\r\nProceedings S.P.R., it will be the first time that she\r\nbecomes aware of the incident, unless some member or\r\nassociate of the S.P.R. tells her about it.\r\nIII.\r\nThe ' Horace and 0. L.' Episode.\r\n{A side issue of evidential interest.)\r\nMr. J. Arthur Hill, of Thornton, near Bradford, on the\r\n3rd of March, 1916, was having a sitting with the\r\nmedium, Mr. Z., in his house at Thornton (only his sister,\r\nMiss Hill (M. H.), being present to take notes), and had\r\nhanded to the medium a scrap of my writing from\r\nwhich everything identifying had been cut off. The\r\nmedium didn't look at it, but crushed the paper in\r\nhis hand. But it seemed to put him into touch\r\nwith me, and with Myers. I judge this because \" Human\r\nPersonality \" was mentioned ; the \" tunnel \" simile was\r\nmentioned ; many of the S.P.R. Group were referred to\r\nlike a kind of composite portrait, without any attempt\r\nat sejiaration or individual identification. And presently\r\nthe medium said, slowly and emphatically :\r\n\"Tell Hill, tell Hill\u2014that's you\u2014I want this transcribed\r\nand sent to 0. L., because it is for him more than for Hill.\"\r\nThen a special message came through for me\u2014a general\r\nmessage of stimulus and encouragement. Note that this\r\nwas the first mention of 0. L.\r\nCommunications about the S.P.R. Group continued, and\r\npresently Mr. Hill, still feeling the influence of \"Myers\"\r\npresent, and thinking that he might get a cross-corre- spondence about the ' Faunus ' message which had come\r\nLxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 140\r\nlast year to me through Mrs. Piper\u2014as reported above\r\n\r\nsaid in a definite manner :\r\n\" Does Horace remind you of anything in connexion with\r\n0. L. ? \"\r\nThe answer of the medium is recorded as follows :\r\nMedium. (After pause.) Can't get his answer.\r\n(Pause.)\r\nVery curious. I see verses. Too indefinite. Verses\r\nin English language. ' Oh had I a little farm !\r\n'\r\nWhat's this mean ? I get a picture of two mice.\r\nM. h. Two what %\r\nj. a. h. Mice.\r\nMedium. One mouse is very smooth, and nice : hair brushed\r\nprettily ; fat. The other is rough and not so\r\npretty. A little laugh. Somebody is laughing.\r\nI am in contact with some one who hasn't forgotten how to laugh.\r\nWhat has that to do with a book ? A little book,\r\ncovered with leather. Curious title page, much\r\nworn. Dear to you through age. It is held up\r\nto me. That's all.\r\nMr. Hill adds a note as follows : March 7, 1916.\r\nThe sentence about the farm recalls nothing to me. Nor\r\ndid the \" mice \" at the time. Since, I have remembered\r\nthat there is some fable about a town mouse and a country\r\nmouse, but I remember no more about it, and I do not know\r\nwhether it is in Horace or not. I have read or skipped\r\nHorace in translations, but remember practically nothing. I have purposely not yet looked it up. J. A. H.\r\nLater, after the medium had gone, Mr. Hill wrote to\r\nhim and asked if he knew where ' The Town and Country\r\nMouse ' occurred in literature. He replied\u2014to the best\r\nof his belief, in Prior. Mr. Hill also asked him whether\r\nhe had ever read Horace. He replied\u2014hardly at all. He had read translations of Virgil and Homer, but had\r\nfound the translations of Horace too bad to be readable.\r\n[See Appendix for his full statement on the subject.]\r\n150 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nMr. Hill soon found out that the \" Town and Country\r\nMouse \" fable occurred in one of Horace's Satires, though\r\nof course it is quoted or transcribed in many places in\r\nliterature. And when I read the above sitting to the\r\nfamily, I read them also a translation of Horace's Satire n. G, about his home life and his little farm, and his\r\npreference for country to town, where there were too\r\nmany interruptions and distractions. They were struck\r\nas I had not been\u2014by a close resemblance between the\r\ndescription of Horace's farm and a more prosaic description\r\nwhich had been given in a letter by my eldest son,\r\nOliver W. F. Lodge, of his very recently acquired little\r\nfarm ; and this letter of Oliver's was hunted up. It is a letter to his mother, dated 6th January, 1916, and\r\npart of it is here quoted :\r\nThe farm is glorious, and we have a little wood, and springs.\r\nThe house is not very big, but it will be good when I have\r\ngot the new drains in. (Signed) Oliver.\r\nHe had only just gone out from a town (Cardiff) to\r\nlive in the country ; having effected the move and entered\r\nthe farm at Christmas.\r\nAnd the following is Dr. Hamilton Bryce's translation\r\nof the beginning of the 6th Satire, Book II., of Horace\r\nthe one which ends with the fable of the Town and\r\nCountry Mouse :\r\nThis was a wish of mine ; \u2014a piece of land not very large\r\nin which there was a garden, and near the house a spring of\r\nnever-failing water, and, over and above, a little wood. The\r\ngods have dealt by me more liberally, and better than I hoped.\r\nI am content.\r\nIt would be quite characteristic of Myers's intelligence\r\nand vein of humour, if he had by any means been\r\ninformed of Oliver's unexpected and rather surprising\r\nfarm enterprise, to bethink him of the Horace passage ; and subsequently, when suddenly asked a question connecting Horace with 0. L., that he should switch from\r\nthe O. L. intended, and give an answer appropriate\r\nto 0. L. Junior. Thinking that thereby he could give\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 151\r\nsomething which would ultimately be understood, and\r\nwhich, when understood, would prove more evidential \u2014\r\nmore completely eliminating telepathy for instance. For\r\ntelepathy would not have been eliminated by a communication about Faunus, since Mr. Hill had been privately told\r\nof that incident. But nothing about Oliver's farm could\r\npossibly be in his knowledge, nor in that of the medium ; nor did it happen that there was any conscious knowledge\r\nof this particular portion of Horace. The only normal\r\nexplanation seems to be, coincidence. And the question\r\nhow far coincidence can be considered sufficient to cover\r\ndetails of agreement in this CctSG, IS <3j matter of judgment.\r\nAdded June 27th, 1916.\r\n[When I read this paper at the meeting of the S.P.R.,\r\nMr. Piddington urged that the reference to Horace's farm\r\nwas really, after all, another allusion to Faunus and the\r\ntree trunk, because the accident had happened in the\r\nwood on Horace's Sabine Farm. I admit the fact,\r\nthough I had not recognised it before, 1 but I think the\r\nreference is too far-fetched and indistinct to be considered\r\na ' Faunus ' allusion ; and for my own part I adhere to\r\nthe other 0. L. explanation, though I admit that the\r\nswitch from one 0. L. to another is curious, for in the\r\nearlier part of Z.'s utterance I was certainly the 0. L.\r\nintended.\r\nI pay great deference to Mr. Piddington's opinion in\r\nsuch matters, and it will be instructive to a reader to\r\nhave the matter argued before him. In favour of Mr.\r\nPiddington's interpretation is the fact that the question\r\nreferred to me, and that the questioner expected a Faunustree-trunk answer. Against that interpretation I call\r\nattention to the medium's mention of \" verses in the\r\nEnglish language,\" and to the migration from Town to\r\nCountry represented by the fable of the two mice. These\r\nare very appropriate to my son, 0. L. Junior, who has\r\npublished a volume of poetry, and quite inappropriate to\r\n1 Since the episode I have read Sir Archibald Geikie's article in the Quarterly for April, 1916, called \" Horace and his Sabine Farm.\"\r\n152 Sir Oliver Lodge. [paet\r\nmyself : though it is true that they were not definitely\r\napplied to either of us by the utterance of the Z control.\r\nAdhering for the present to my own view, I argue in its favour thus : Mr. Myers knew my son Oliver as a boy, and\r\nwas kindly interested in his literary ability and early\r\npoetic faculty. On hearing that he had just gone to live\r\nin the country on a little farm, he would be not unlikely\r\nto think of Horace. If so, it is quite in accordance\r\nwith his methods that he should give the reference by\r\nan allusion to two mice ; for he would know that thus,\r\nbefore long, it would be identified. If this is the true\r\ninterjiretation, it is a case where ordinary telepathy\r\nis excluded to the uttermost. Mr. Piddington's interpretation, however, is of even greater interest, and he\r\nhas expressed his views in a careful Note (see below,\r\np. 1G0).\r\nAppendix.\r\nEnquiries concerning Normal Knowledge.\r\nTo ascertain how far it was familiar to a literary\r\nscholar not specially classical that the \" Town and Country\r\nMouse \" fable occurred in Horace (I seemed to have\r\nan indistinct recollection of having heard the fact long\r\nago but had quite forgotten it\u2014I thought it was probabh'\r\nin Aesop), I wrote, without giving any reason, to my son\r\nOliver, asking him if, without looking up, he would\r\ntell me where the fable occurred in literature. He replies\r\nthis morning (16th March) :\r\nBefore looking up I thought the fable of the Town and\r\nCountry Mice had been told by the following :\r\nAesop (?). Phaedrus (?). Henryson. The Burger Mouse and the Upland Mouse.\r\nLa Fontaine. Le Rat Civile et le Rat de Camyaqne.\r\nGay (?).\r\nIf you want the order in which the names came to me, it was : La Fontaine, Henryson, Aesop, Phaedrus, Gay.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 153\r\nOn looking up I find that Horace is the chief Latin\r\nsource.\r\nI have not an Aesop, Phaedrus, or Gay handy, and these I am doubtful of. La Fontaine, who otherwise followed Horace, called them rats. Hcnryson's is the most interesting version I know of in English,\r\nand 1 should say that Horace is the locus classicus. If this\r\nis not what you want I am delighted to send more.\r\n(Note by J. A. H., March 9th, 1916.)\r\nI have found the \" two mice,\" I think. It is in the fable\r\nof the City Mouse and the Country Mouse, and the Horatian\r\naccount is in Book II. of the Satires : No. 6. And the sentence\r\n\" 0 had I a little farm ! \" well expresses the idea of this\r\nSatire, and indeed what I now remember to have been Horace's\r\noften repeated preference for country life. All this, however, is common knowledge, or at least cannot\r\nsafely be assumed to be unknown to a reader like Z. ; though,\r\nas said in the comments, it was not known to me supraliminally. I have almost certainly read that Satire, years\r\nago, but had evidently almost forgotten its contents. If anyone\r\nhad asked me, unexpectedly,\u2014as I practically asked the\r\ncontrol\u2014to produce a Horatian reference, I could have produced nothing but the Faunus incident, which I had read up\r\nrecently in Odes, Book 2, Nos. 13 and 17. Further, in my\r\nquestion I did not indicate that it was the poet Horace I was meaning ; so far as anything I said was concerned, it might have been a reference to some deceased (or living)\r\nrelative or friend of \"0. L.\" named Horace. If I were asked\r\nat a time when classical matters were not in my mind, what\r\n\" Horace \" reminded me of, I should probably say \" Horace\r\nDuckett, the old International Rugby football player \"\r\n\r\nfor I knew him well, his parents and himself happening to\r\nlive in a house belonging to me. For the sake of interest, and not because it is evidence,\r\nI will try to get Z.'s statement of what he knows about\r\nHorace. I will take a copy of anything I may write to\r\nhim about it\r\n154 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\n{Letter from J. A. H. to Mr. Z.)\r\nMarch 9, 1916\r\nI want to ask you, in consequence of some things which\r\ncame through in the trance, one or two questions.

J. L.\r\nConcerning the. evidential value of this little bye-episode,\r\nI will add some comments.\r\nWhatever Z. knew or did not know of Horace, there\r\nwas nothing in Mr. Hill's question to signify necessarily the\r\nclassical poet. Nor was there anything to bring me into\r\nthe business normally ; because the mention of 0. L.\r\nhad been made by Z. himself, when switched clairvoyantly\r\non to me and Myers by having a bit of paper in my\r\nwriting\u2014which, however, was unknown to Z. as I had\r\nnever written to him\u2014put into his hand. This bit of\r\npaper was not even looked at, but it would have showed\r\nno connexion with me even if it had been read, for it related only to the meaning of a few Greek words on\r\nwhich Mr. Hill had asked my opinion. However, Z.,\r\nby its aid, got on to 0. L. somehow, and on to Mr. Myers.\r\nBut when Mr. Hill asked the question about Horace\r\nand 0. L., no further reference to me was made by the\r\ncommunicator\u2014at least on my interpretation of the\r\nepisode ; but instead of that he showed intimate knowledge by switching ingeniously on to my eldest son, who\r\nhad never been thought of in connexion with the subject,\r\nwho had never been near Z., had probably never heard\r\n156 Sir Oliver Lodge.

A letter of my\r\nson Oliver's was then hunted up, and found to correspond.\r\nIt was just like Myers to manage this, when a question\r\nabout Horace and 0. L.

He had a mind steeped\r\nin classical lore, so that directly a question was asked\r\nabout Horace and 0. L., a little farm episode in relation\r\nto both might jump to utterance ; the passage being\r\nidentified for us sufficiently by the easily found quotation\r\nabout Town and Country Mice.

The passage is, Dona praesentis cape laetus horae et\r\nLinque severa,\r\n' Take gladly the gifts of the present hour, and lay cares of\r\nstate aside.'\r\nThe poem is addressed to Horace's patron Maecenas, who on\r\nthe day on which it is ostensibly composed, the 1st of March,\r\nis apparently dining with him at his Sabine villa. It may\r\nbe summarised as follows : You wonder to find me, a bachelor,\r\n1 See below, moreover, near the end of Mr. Piddington's important Note ; where it is made quite clear that Bacchus (Liber) was intended.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 159\r\nmaking preparations for sacrifice on the day of the Matronalia\r\n[a festival for married women]. It is in fulfilment of a vow\r\nI made to keep holy every year the day on which I narrowly\r\nescaped death from the blow I received from the falling tree.\r\nI swore I would make an annual sacrifice to Bacchus on this\r\nday. Forget public affairs for a while, Maecenas ; join in\r\nmy thanksgiving, and drink my health as often as you will\r\nbefore the night is over. Take gladly the gifts of the present\r\nhour, and banish all cares of state. In Carm. n. 17. 27, Horace attributes his escape to the\r\nlightening of the blow by Faunus, but there need be no\r\ninconsistency in his making his yearly thanksgiving to Bacchus,\r\nwho, as one of the gods of poetry, might be assumed to have\r\nbeen the prime mover in the matter, possibly employing\r\nFaunus as his agent.\r\nIt is impossible not to connect these words of the script with\r\nthe Faunus message ; and the manner of it seems to me to\r\ngive it extraordinary value, to make it indeed one of our\r\nbest.\r\nFor firstly, it is most improbable that Mrs. Piper should be\r\ncapable, consciously or subliminally, of making a quotation\r\nfrom Horace at all ; secondly, it is difficult to suppose that\r\nany living person communicated it to her telepathically ; and\r\nthirdly, the connexion of the words with the Faunus message\r\ncould hardly have been more effectively concealed without\r\nbecoming irrecoverable. As I read the script, Horace's words\r\ndona praesentis cape laetus horae happened to flash across my mind, but they might well not have done so ; for the\r\nline is in no way striking, since it merely expresses a commonplace of the poet's philosophy which he frequently repeats\r\nin varying language. When I had recalled the line it took\r\nme some time to discover in what ode it occurred, and so\r\nlittle did I dream it had anything to do with the falling tree,\r\nthat the fact came as a pleasant surprise.\r\nThe sentence in the script, \" wander o'er the earth an\r\nunlaid ghost,\" suggests poetry, and we must try to track it down if it is a quotation.

PlDDINGTON.\r\nOn August 8, 1915, there came a message from MyersP\r\nto Sir Oliver Lodge about \" Faunus and the Poet.\"\r\nThis message reached Sir Oliver a day or two before\r\nSeptember 8, 1915.\r\nOn October 12, 1915, Sir Oliver sent the following\r\nmessage to \"Myers \" through Mrs. A. :\r\nTell him I understand about ' Faunus and the Poet ' ... he may like to say something. ... Of course he\r\nmay, if he chooses, say something more through Mrs.\r\nPiper.\r\nOn Jan. 12, 1916, the following conversation between Miss\r\nAlta Piper and Rector took place :\r\nAlta. Hail Rector ! I am glad you have come ! I have a\r\nquestion to ask you for Sir Oliver.\r\nGood.\r\nAlta. May I give it now ? Can you hear me distinctly ?

Yes because there are other trunks which might fall were they not stayed. . . . There will be more\r\nlater, but for the moment take this.\r\nOn March 3, 1916, Mr. J. Arthur Hill had a sitting\r\nwith a medium, Mr. Z., hi the course of which he put\r\nthis question to Mr. Z.'s control : Does Horace remind you of anything in connexion\r\nwith O. L. ? The answer received was :\r\nVery curious. I see verses. Too indefinite. Verses\r\nin English language. ' Oh had I a little farm ! ' What's\r\nthis mean ? I get a picture of two mice.

W. H. M.\r\nFarewell R\r\nMme G\r\n(For drawings accompanying the signatures see p. 157\r\nabove.)\r\nOn May 18, 1916, Mrs. Piper wrote the following script:\r\nHAIL.\r\nFriend of earth I greet you Rector\r\nTell Mrs Verrall I have answered her question of long\r\n& Myers.\r\n+R\r\nWith Sir Oliver's interpretation of the \" Faunus and\r\nthe Poet \" message in Mrs. Piper's script of August 8,\r\n1915, I entirely agree. Where I disagree with him is over his interpretation of Mr. Z.'s answer, given on\r\nMarch 3, 1916, to Mr. Hill's question : \" Does Horace\r\nremind you of anything in connexion with 0. L. ? \" We both agree, and, I think, every one will agree, that\r\nMr. Z.'s answer refers to Horace's little farm and to the\r\nfable of the Town and Country Mouse, as described and\r\ntold in Hor. Sat. n. 6. But here we part company. Sir\r\nOliver considers that the point of this literary reference\r\nis to show supernormally acquired knowledge of the fact\r\nthat his eldest son, Mr. 0. W. F. Lodge, had recently\r\nmoved from a town and gone to live at a little farm,\r\nwhich he had described in a letter to his mother in\r\nterms recalling Horace's description of his little farm. I\r\nconsider that Mr. Z.'s reference to Hor. Sat. II. 6 is a\r\ncontinuation of the previous reference through Mrs. Piper\r\nto Hor. C. II. 17 (\" Faunus and the Poet \").\r\n1 Originally deciphered as \" & try \" ; but I think the true reading\r\nis \" by,\" what was taken to be an ampersand and a cross to a t being merely scrawls.\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 163\r\nWhat the connexion between Hor. Sat. II. 6 and Hor.\r\nC. ii. 17 is I will show later.\r\nMeanwhile, I had first better deal with the only reason\r\n(except, of course, the admitted coincidence between the farm\r\nof Hor. Sat. n. 6 and Mr. Oliver W. Lodge's farm) which\r\nSir Oliver gives for referring Mr. Z.'s answer to his son\r\nOliver. He maintains that \" I see verses . . . Verses in\r\nEnglish language \" is a way of alluding to the fact\r\nthat his son has written and published poems. In my\r\nview \" I see verses . . . Verses in English language \" is simply and solely the medium's description of how the\r\nideas which he is attempting to convey are reaching\r\nhim. 1 The phenomena of Mrs. Piper and of Mrs. Thompson\r\n\r\nto name only two automatists\u2014exhibit instances in profusion of the same sort of process. So common, indeed,\r\nare they, that anyone who wishes to verify my statement\r\nwill have to read but few records of Mrs. Piper's or Mrs.\r\nThompson's sittings before coming across plenty.\r\nIt is, of course, a disadvantage that in Mr. Z.'s case no series of detailed records of his trance-utterances\r\nhas been published\u2014if, indeed, one exists. One cannot,\r\ntherefore, determine with certainty whether it is likely\r\nthat Mr. Z. would see, and would describe seeing, a\r\npicture of English verses just before he was going to\r\nutter the words \" Oh had I a little farm ! \" 2 But even\r\nin the very exiguous records of Mr. Z.'s trance-phenomena\r\naccessible to me, I find a passage that supports my\r\ncontention to some extent. It is in Mr. Z.'s sitting of\r\nOct. 29, 1915 (p. 130) : Do you know F W M ?\r\no. j. l. Yes, I do.\r\nBecause I see those three letters. Now, after them, do you know S. T., yes I get\r\n1 1 am disposed to agree. O. J. L.\r\n2 I understand \" Oh had I a little farm ! \" to be one of the \" Verses\r\nin English language \" seen by Mr. Z., and to be a paraphrase in English\r\nverse of the opening lines of Hor. Sat. n. 0 : \" Hoc erat in votis : modus agri non ita magnus,\" etc. There are, of course, several versions in English poetry of this Satire ; the best known being, perhaps, that begun by Swift and finished by Pope.\r\n164 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nS T, then a dot, and then P ? These are shown ; I see them in light ; your boy shows these things\r\nto me. 1\r\nMoreover, when Mr. Z.'s control wants to refer to a\r\nwriter of poetry, he seems to have no difficulty in doing\r\nso quite straightforwardly. See Mr. Z.'s sitting of September 27, 1915 : \" a man, a writer of poetry. . . . This\r\ngentleman who wrote poetry . . . the gentleman beginning\r\nwith M and who wrote poetry \"\r\n(p. 128).\r\nI will now give my own interpretation of Mr. Z.'s\r\nanswer to Mr. Hill's question.\r\nMr. Hill, knowing of the Piper \" Faunus and the\r\nPoet \" message, and with that in his mind, asked\r\nMr. Z.'s control : \" Does Horace remind you of anything\r\nin connexion with 0. L. ? \" In reply, allusion was\r\nmade, as Sir Oliver Lodge agrees, to the little farm and\r\nto the Fable of the Two Mice of Hor. Sat. n. 6. In\r\nthis Satire, Horace contrasts the happiness of his placid\r\nlife at his country home with the vexations of his town\r\nlife at Rome. He enlarges at considerable length (11. 29-58) on the desagrements that beset him at Rome in\r\nconsequence of his intimacy with Maecenas ; and describes\r\nhow he is pestered by people who either beg him to use his influence with the great man for their benefit, or who, feeling sure that so close a friend of Maecenas'\r\nmust be \"in the know,\" plague him with such questions\r\nas \"Is there any news about the Dacians ? \" The result,\r\nsays Horace, is that when he's in town he is longing to\r\nbe back again in the country in the company of his\r\nneighbours, with whom he can discuss, not silly topics\r\nof the town, but such questions as whether it is wealth\r\nor virtue that makes a man happy ; and listen to his\r\nfriend Cervius telling one of his old-wives' tales, like\r\nthe one about the Town-mouse and the Country-mouse.\r\nBut why, it may be asked, does a reference to this\r\nSatire furnish an appropriate answer to Mr. Hill's question ?\r\n1 Cf. \" Now he is trying to build up a letter of some one ; M. he\r\nshows me \" ; and \" That is why they built up the dark cross \" in Mrs. A.s sitting of September 27, 1915 (p. 126).\r\nLXxn.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 165\r\nThe reason is that the tree that nearly killed Horace\r\nstood in the little country place, Horace's Sabine Farm,\r\nwhich figures so largely in Sat. II. 6. This interpretation seems to me to be very strongly\r\nconfirmed by Mrs. Piper's script of May 17, 1916. 1 The script opens by exhorting Sir Oliver to \" bear\r\nthese hardships with such resolve as befitteth stalwart\r\nmen \" ; and by \" these hardships \" it is hardly open to\r\ndoubt that his son's death is meant.\r\nNext it refers to Hor. C. in: 30, 6-7 :\r\n\" Non omnis moriar, multaque pars mei\r\nVitabit Libitinam,\"\r\nwhich means\r\n\" I shall not all die, and a great part of me will\r\nescape Libitina (goddess of funerals).\" 2\r\nThen follows the cardinal allusion :\r\n\" Gladly will I take the gifts of the present.\"\r\nThis is a rendering, with a change of tense and person,\r\nof Hor. C. in. 8. 27 :\r\n\" Dona praesentis cape laetus horae,\"\r\nwhich means\r\n\" Take gladly the gifts of the present hour.\"\r\nIf the reading \"abandon\" is right, then \"and abandon\r\nother things \" represents the words \" et Linque severa\r\n\r\n(\" and abandon serious things \"), which immediately\r\nfollow \" laetus horae.\"\r\n1 This interpretation first struck me when Sir Oliver Lodge was\r\nreading his paper at a Private Meeting of the Society ; and was suggested\r\nsolely by Mr. Z.'s trance-utterances. I had at the time seen Mrs.\r\nPiper's script of May 17, 1916, but I had not read it carefully, and\r\nI had not recognised the allusion in it to one of the Odes in which\r\nHorace speaks of his narrow escape from being killed by the tree.\r\n2 As the \"I\" turned into \"you,\" and the \"me\" written over \"you,\"\r\nshow, the intelligence responsible for the script knew the quotation in\r\nits original form, and deliberately substituted the second person for the\r\nfirst in order to make it apply to Sir Oliver Lodge.\r\n166 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\r\nThe whole Ode is so essential to my case that I must\r\ngive the English of the greater part of it. It is addressed\r\nto Maecenas, and Horace is the speaker throughout.\r\nYou wonder what I, a bachelor, am doing on the\r\nKalends of March [the day of the Matronalia, a festival\r\ncelebrated by married women], what mean the flowers,\r\nand the box full of incense, and the charcoal placed upon\r\nthe living turf, you that are learned in the literature\r\nof either tongue [i.e. Maecenas].\r\nI had vowed to Liber a pleasant feast and a white\r\nhe -goat, when almost done to death by the blow of\r\nthe falling tree. This day of festival, as the year comes\r\nround, shall remove the pitch-bound cork from a wine-jar\r\nwhich was trained to drink the smoke in Tullus' consulate . Take, Maecenas, a hundred cups in honour of your\r\nfriend's deliverance, and prolong till break of day the\r\nwakeful lamps ; let all clamour and passion be far away.\r\nDismiss your politic cares for the City's weal ; the\r\nhost of Dacian Cotiso has fallen ; the Mede ... is distracted by a woeful warfare ; our ancient enemy of the\r\nSpanish coast, the Cantabrian, is our slave . . . ; now\r\nthe Scythians . . . are resolving to withdraw from the\r\nplains.\r\nCarelessly, as a man not in place, refrain from guarding\r\novermuch that the people in no way suffer ; snatch\r\njoyfully the gifts of the present hour, and abandon serious\r\nthoughts (et Linque severa).\r\n(Lonsdale and Lee's Translation.)\r\nAs Mr. Bayfield\u2014to whom I owe the identification of \" Gladly will I take the gifts of the present \"\u2014observes,\r\nthe whole Ode turns on the tree accident. And, moreover,\r\nit presents analogies to Sat. II. 6 so marked and obvious\r\nthat it is not necessary to mention them in detail, except,\r\nperhaps, the \" Numcpud de Dacis audisti ? \" of the Satire\r\nand the \" Occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen \" of the Ode.\r\nFurther points in connexion with Mrs. Piper's scripts\r\nof May 17 and 18, 1916, are these. \"I do not wander\r\no'er the earth an unlaid Ghost \" may be an allusion to\r\nlxxii.] Recent Evidence about Prevision and Survival. 167\r\nthe lines in the ' Archytas ' Ode (Hor. C. I. 28. 23-25),\r\nwhere the spirit of a shipwrecked man appeals to a\r\npassing sailor to scatter a particle of sand upon his\r\nunburied bones and head. 1 If this is so, it will serve to\r\nexplain the reference in the script of May 18, 1916,\r\nto Mrs. Verrall's \" question of long ago.\" Mrs. Verrall\r\nput two questions to MyersP\r\n: and one of the two\r\nwas about an Ode of Horace, viz. the ' Archytas ' Ode.\r\nIn view of the fact that the script of May 17, 1916,\r\ncontains two certain allusions to Horace's Odes, and a\r\npossible allusion also to the ' Archytas ' Ode, it seems\r\nreasonable to take Mrs. Verrall's \" question of long ago\r\n\"\r\nto mean her question about the ' Archytas ' Ode. But\r\nwhy this reference to the \" question of long ago \" ? I suggest that it was the best approach that MyersP\r\ncould make towards saying something of this kind : \" Long ago Mrs. Verrall put me a question about an Ode\r\nof Horace, and this question I answered partly through\r\nMrs. Piper and partly in Mrs. Verrall's own script. Quite\r\nrecently another question about Horace has been put\r\nby Mr. Hill ; and I have answered it partly through\r\nMr. Z. and partly through Mrs. Piper.\"\r\nI think there may have been more than one reason\r\nfor introducing the allusion to Hor. G. rn. 30. 7 : \" You\r\nshall not altogether die but a mighty part of you will\r\nescape the death goddess.\" It gives, in the first place, a reason why the hardship of a son's death should be\r\nborne with courage ; in the second place, by pointing\r\nunmistakeably to Horace, it gives a hint of the source\r\nof \" Gladly will I take the gifts of the present,\" which,\r\nbut for the hint, might have escaped detection ; and\r\nin the third place it may serve as a link with Sat. n. 6. Libitina (\" the death goddess \") is mentioned thrice\r\nonly in Horace : in C. in. 30. 7 (the passage referred\r\nto in Mrs. Piper's script), in Ep. n. 1. 49 (a passage\r\ndealing with the immortality of poets, and so analogous\r\nto C. in. 30, where Horace speaks of his own immortality\r\n1 Unless this duty to the dead were performed, the ghost would wander\r\nabout unhappily and find no rest.\r\n168 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PAET\r\nas a poet), and in Hor. Sat. n. 6. 19, where Horace says\r\nthat when he has retired to his farm in the hills, he is safe from the evil effects of the leaden sirocco and of\r\nthe unhealthy autumn that enriches Libitina.\r\nMoreover, it will be noticed that on each occasion it is a question of poets escaping Libitina, and, on two out\r\nof the three occasions, of Horace escaping her. Now in\r\nMrs. Piper's script of August 8, 1915, MyersP had said : \" Now Lodge . . . you take the part of the poet,\" i.e. of Horace ; and I suspect that that is why when on\r\nMay 17, 1916, Lodge is assured that a \" mighty part\r\nof him will escape the death goddess,\" the assurance\r\nis given in the words in which Horace proclaims how\r\nhe will balk Libitina of her prey.\r\nThe sentence beginning \" Had I the power of Bacchus \"\r\ncontains, I suggest, an allusion to Hor. G. IV. 8. 34 :\r\n\" Liber vota bonos ducit ad exitus.\"\r\nThe context is as follows :\r\n\" What would the son of Mars and Ilia be, if jealous\r\nsilence suppressed the deserts of Romulus ? Aeacus,\r\nrescued from the Stygian waves, the genius and goodwill\r\nand tongue of mighty poets commit enshrined to the\r\nIsles of Wealth [divitibus insulis, i.e. the Islands of the\r\nBlessed]. 'Tis the Muse who forbids to die the man\r\nthat is worthy of renown ; 'tis the Muse that blesses\r\nhim with a place in heaven.

W. Verrall. [part\r\nV.\r\nMRS. A. W. VERRALL.\r\nThe short announcement in the July Journal of the\r\ndeath of Mrs. Verrall, on July 2, in her fifty-ninth year,\r\ncould not do justice to one to whom the Society owes so much, and its members will desire that at least an attempt\r\nshould be made to commemorate more adequately in\r\nthe Proceedings what she was and what we owe her.\r\nMrs. Margaret de Gaudrion Verrall was the daughter of\r\nMr. Frederic Merrifield of Brighton, till recently clerk to the\r\nCounty Councils of East and West Sussex, and her mother\r\nwas a daughter of Colonel V. P. J. de Gaudrion, a member\r\nof an old French family. She was among the early\r\nwomen students at Newnham College, Cambridge, and was\r\nplaced by the examiners for the Classical Tripos in the\r\nhonours list in 1880. Immediately afterwards she was\r\nappointed Lecturer in Classics at her College, and she\r\ncontinued to take part in the classical teaching there\r\ntill very recently ; for her marriage with Dr. A. W.\r\nVerrall, the well-known classical scholar, in 1882, did\r\nnot take her away from Cambridge. Her classical studies\r\nnaturally enabled her to take an intelligent interest in\r\nher husband's work, and she herself translated and collaborated in the commentary on the text of Pausanias for\r\nThe Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens,\r\nwhich she published jointly with Miss Jane Harrison\r\nin 1890. In English and French literature she was also\r\nwidely read. After her husband's death in June, 1912,\r\nshe edited his lectures on Dryden, a fruit of his short\r\ntenure of the new King Edward VII. chair of English\r\nLiterature. She, like her husband, was an inspiring\r\nLXxn.] Obituary Notice : Mrs. A. W. Verrall. 171\r\nteacher, and one who could enter readily into the minds\r\nand feelings of younger people.\r\nMrs. Verrall's practical ability was as marked as her\r\nliterary taste. She was for many years a valued member\r\nof the Council of Newnham College, and since May, 1901, of\r\nthe Council of the Society for Psychical Research, the\r\nmeetings of which, until her illness began, she attended\r\nwith great regularity. In 1914\u201415 she took an active part\r\nin work in connexion with the Belgian refugees, serv- ing as secretary to the Cambridge University Hospitality\r\nCommittee, whose function was to make arrangements\r\nfor students from Belgian Universities to continue their\r\nstudies, largely with their own professors, at Cambridge.\r\nIn this work, which practically came to an end when\r\nmost of the students were drafted off into the Belgian\r\narmy or into other work, her command of the French\r\nlanguage was naturally of great value to her, but it would have served little had it not been accompanied\r\nby tact and sympathy as well as by organising power\r\nand businesslike qualities, which won the cordial appreciation of all with whom the work brought her in contact.\r\nI have purposely dealt so far with aspects of Mrs.\r\nVerrall's life outside Psychical Research, but must now\r\nturn to what concerns us most here\u2014her work in our own subject ; and this was the work in which she was\r\nmost interested of late years.\r\nMrs. Verrall joined the Society for Psychical Research\r\nin January, 1889\u2014seven years after its foundation\u2014and at once became an active member.- Indeed she had been\r\ninterested in its work earlier. We have in the Journal\r\nfor March, 1889, an account\u2014anonymous, but written by\r\nMrs. Verrall\u2014of experiments in thought-transference she\r\nhad tried a year previously with her little daughter\r\n(now Mrs. W. H. Salter), and which she had recorded\r\ncarefully at the time. Incidentally she mentions a still earlier case, similarly recorded, of what appeared to be\r\nspontaneous telepathy between them when her little girl\r\ncould only speak very imperfectly. In Proceedings, Vol.\r\nVIII., is an account of experiments in crystal-gazing,\r\ncarried out from 1889 to 1892 at F. W. H. Myers' request.\r\n172 Obituary Notice : Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nIn connexion with these he speaks of her in his Human\r\nPersonality as \" among our best observers,\" an opinion\r\nin which all who have worked with her in Psychical\r\nResearch will agree. Because of this and because of\r\nher own psychical powers Mrs. Verrall was invited by\r\nMyers to sit on three occasions with Mrs. Piper when\r\nthe latter first visited England in 1889, and for the same\r\nreasons she was asked to take part as a sitter when\r\nMrs. Piper was again in this country in 1907-8.\r\nIn 1895 Mrs Verrall read her first paper to the Society.1\r\nIt was on \" Some experiments in the supernormal acquisition of knowledge,\" and gave an account of experiments\r\nconducted by herself during the five previous years in\r\nthe guessing of unperceived cards. The experiments\r\nwere arranged to test various possible causes of success\u2014as\r\ndelicate sense of touch, telepathy, hyperaesthesia, telaesthesia.\r\nIt is curious that notwithstanding Mrs. Verrall's various\r\npsychical experiences, spontaneous and experimental, all attempts at automatic writing, or at table-tilting by\r\nherself, failed for a long time. This must have been a disappointment to Myers, who was always in search of\r\nsuccessful automatists. After his death in January, 1901,\r\nshe made more persistent and persevering efforts in this\r\ndirection, and at length on March 5th, 1901, obtained\r\nwhat she regarded as the first successful result. 2 Since\r\nthen she has continued to have numerous scripts\u2014amounting to many hundreds ; these were produced from time\r\nto time till within a week or two of her death. Her\r\nscripts, as readers of the Proceedings know, have often\r\ncontained matter of apparently supernormal interest, as\r\nin cross-correspondence with other automatists and otherwise. Naturally, much that is or may be of psychical\r\ninterest in the scripts cannot be published as it is of\r\ntoo private or personal a nature. Naturally, also, her\r\nscripts like those of other automatists contain a large\r\nadmixture\u2014at least she always thought so\u2014of matter of\r\nprobably purely subliminal and even of supraliminal origin.\r\n1 Published in Proceedings, Vol. XI., p. 176.\r\n2 See Proceedings, Vol. XX., p. 8.\r\nlxxii.] Obituary Notice : Mrs. A. W. Verrall. 173\r\nAn account and analysis of her scripts from March, 1901,\r\nto the end of 1904 was written by Mrs. Verrall herself,\r\nand published in Proceedings, Vol. XX., in 1906. This\r\nable and careful paper excited very considerable interest,\r\nboth on account of the evidential matter it contains, and\r\non account of the light it throws on the psychology of\r\nautomatic writing and, to some extent, on the psychology\r\nof telepathy. It formed the starting-point of a series\r\nof studies on cross-correspondence which have appeared\r\nin our Proceedings\u2014cross-correspondences observed among\r\nvarious automatists : Mrs. \"Forbes,\" Mrs. \"Holland,\" the\r\n\"Macs,\" Mrs. \"Willett,\" Mrs. Salter (Miss Verrall), Mrs.\r\n\"King,\" and some others, and also Mrs. Piper. It also helped\r\nin the building up of evidence for communication from those\r\nwho have left this world. Not that it definitely proved that\r\nsuch communication occurs. Proof is from the nature of\r\nthe case, as those engaged in Psychical Research well\r\nknow, very difficult to obtain. But careful readers of\r\nMrs. Verrall's paper will agree that though most of the\r\nscript does not claim to come from identifiable individuals,\r\nincidents are there recorded which can be more simply\r\ninterpreted on the hypothesis that the dead, and\r\nespecially F. W. H. Myers,1 communicated\u2014granting that\r\nhypothesis to be admissible\u2014than on any other. And\r\nit is on accumulation of evidence of this description that\r\nwe shall, I think, in the main have to rely, in obtaining\r\nconviction of the reality of communication from the\r\nother world. It is not always remembered to what\r\nextent accepted scientific theories rest on the test of\r\nsimplicity. We accept an hypothesis largely because it\r\nis the simplest among possible ones. I am not, however,\r\nclaiming that sufficient evidence of communication from\r\nthe dead has been obtained to give it position as a\r\nscientifically established theory. What I do think\r\nis that little by little the necessary evidence is being\r\nbuilt up. Mrs. Verrall's paper in Proceedings, Vol. XX.,\r\n1 Myers as communicator is usually designated by the letter H. in Mrs. Verrall's paper. In the case of one incident\u2014the sphere-spear\r\ncross-correspondence, pp. 212-218, the name of Mrs. Piper's communicator, who professed to be Myers, is omitted altogether.\r\n174 Obituary Notice : Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nwas a notable contribution to this building up, though\r\nlittle was said about it in the paper itself. And subsequent scripts of different automatists have added their\r\nquota, not only through cross-correspondences, but in\r\nmore direct ways, as e.g. in the Lethe case (Proceedings,\r\nVol. XXV., p. 113 et seq.), and in the Statius case\r\n(Proceedings, Vol. XXVII., p. 221 et seq.).\r\nOne very important effect of the publication of Mrs.\r\nVerrall's paper in 1906 was the encouragement it gave\r\nto other automatists. I do not know how far it led\r\nto first attempts at automatic writing. On most of the\r\nautomatists whose work has been dealt with in our\r\nProceedings, Myers' book on Human Personality has had\r\na more powerful initial influence. But Mrs. Verrall\r\nbecame known as a person who could be applied to\r\nfor sympathy and help by all who felt indications in\r\nthemselves of automatic powers worth cultivating ; and to\r\nher wise sympathy we undoubtedly owe much of the\r\nevidence accumulated. Thus, it was to her that the\r\n\" Macs \" first wrote about their experiences with a planchette, and to her that Mrs. \" Willett \" first turned in\r\nher early efforts. And others have turned to her who\r\nthough they have contributed but little to available\r\nevidence for supernormal faculty have yet added to Mrs.\r\nVerrall's own knowledge and experience.\r\nWhat made her so valuable as an investigator was the\r\ncombination in a high degree of two qualities \u2014sympathy\r\nand the critical faculty. This does not need illustration to\r\nthose who have read her papers in the Proceedings, whether\r\ndealing with her own script or that of others ; or dealing\r\nwith phenomena of a different kind, as in the paper on\r\nour President's experiments which appears in the present\r\nnumber of Proceedings, and which was read for her at the\r\nmeeting of the Society on the 23rd of last February, when\r\nshe was already too ill to read it herself. Her critical faculty\r\nwas indeed sometimes too active, and tended too much\r\nto scepticism in the case of her own scripts. She was\r\nalmost too ready to seek and find a normal origin for\r\nany particular script utterance. This is, of course, a\r\nfault on the right side, but in the case of an automatist\r\nlxxii.] Obituary Notice : Mrs. A. W. Yerrall. 175\r\nit is apt to interfere with the spontaneous flow of the script,\r\nand conduce to the intrusion of the supraliminal intelligence in the writing. This supraliminal interference occurs\r\nto some extent with all automatists\u2014at least when not\r\nin trance\u2014and may take the form of adding guesswork\r\nadditions to what the subliminal self is trying to say, or the form of inhibiting topics, e.g. the names of known\r\nindividuals. Or it may act in an intermediate way by\r\nmodifying the script into what seems to the supraliminal\r\nself to make sense and by introducing supraliminal and\r\nirrelevant associations of ideas. Criticism applied to\r\nscripts after they have been written cannot of course\r\naffect them in any of these ways, but it may create an\r\natmosphere unfavourable to the spontaneity of future\r\nscripts, and there can be little doubt that it did\r\nsometimes do this with Mrs. Verrall. She used to say,\r\nmoreover, that prolonged critical study of scripts, her own\r\nand others, tended to check her production of automatic\r\nscripts, and leave her for considerable periods without\r\nany. Criticise she did, however, and no one need fear that\r\nshe did not apply to her own scripts in full measure\r\nthe critical examination which she applied to those of other\r\nautomatists, and to psychical phenomena generaUy.\r\nBoth Mrs. Verrall's sympathy and her critical faculty\r\nhave been of immense value to most of those engaged in\r\nactive work for the Society. All the papers that have\r\nappeared in the Proceedings of recent years have passed\r\nin proof through her hands as a member of the Committee of Reference, on which she has served since\r\n1894. Her function on this Committee was never\r\ntreated by her as a matter of form, and in a large proportion of cases the authors of papers have received\r\nfrom her valuable criticisms and suggestions. But it was even more in earlier stages of their work that her\r\nfriends have been able to rely on her help. She was\r\nan ideal fellow-worker, for there was never anything of\r\nself-seeking or desire to put herself forward in her attitude, and her sympathy was a constant stimulus. Her\r\nco-operation in psychical research will long be greatly\r\nmissed.\r\n176 Obituary Notice : Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\r\nThis memorial, brief as it is, should not go out to\r\nthe world without a few words about Mrs. Verrall as a woman, lest any should imagine that this private side\r\nof her life was submerged in the activities already referred\r\nto. This was far from being the case. As a wife, a mother, and the mistress of a house, she was admirable, as her intimate friends well know, and home\r\nduties were not postponed to other undertakings. Her\r\nintellectual attainments were her servants not her masters ; they were never obtruded, and to many women it must\r\nhave been her domestic interests that were most apparent.\r\nThe unselfishness, sympathy, and understanding of others,\r\nwhich as I have already implied, added so greatly to\r\nher value as a fellow-worker in psychical research and\r\naffairs outside her own home, also made her a womanto whom others readily turned for help in their ownlives and work, a true and staunch friend.\r\nE.

London: Williams & Norgate. Pp. xii, 989.\r\nPrice 21s. net ) 1\r\nAn American audience would need no introduction to Mr. Holt,\r\nbut the members of our Society, dispersed over the entire\r\nsurface of the earth, will be glad to know a little of the\r\nauthor of this book.\r\nHe has been for nearly fifty years one of the foremost\r\ncitizens of New York, not only actively, engaged in practical\r\naffairs, but also in constant touch with the intellectual interests\r\nof the age, as indeed the founder and head of the publishing\r\nhouse of Henry Holt & Company could not fail to be. But\r\nthe influences incidental to his business are not those of chief\r\nimportance to the understanding of his work in psychic re- search. After graduating from Yale University, he took his\r\ndegree in law from Columbia University, Nsw York1 He never\r\npractised, but the discipline of that study has proved of value\r\nto him when called upon to appreciate the relative weight of\r\ndifferent types of evidence for psychic phenomena. Rebelling\r\nagainst the Calvinistic form of Christianity then prevailing at\r\nYale (p. 3), he early came under the influence of Herbert\r\nSpencer, with whom he had considerable personal relations,\r\nHe speaks (p 77) with warm appreciation of Spencer's influence\r\nupon contemporary thought, and many traces of that influence\r\n1 Some of the ideas here expressed will also be found in a review of\r\nthis book which I wrote for the New York Nation of Jan. 14, 1915. M\r\n178 Professor W. B. Newbold. [past\r\nare discernible in Mr. Holt's thinking ; indeed, he might still be accounted a Spencerian were it not that he goes far beyond\r\nhis master in his interpretation of the significance of the\r\nUnknowable. Of this I shall have more to say later. Before\r\nthe appearance of this book Mr. Holt had written three others\r\nwhich had gone through numerous editions ; he had also\r\nfounded and still edits The Unpopular Review, a quarterly\r\njournal designed for the expression of such unpopular views\r\nupon popular topics as the editor thinks worth expressing, and\r\nwell expressed. In this journal, no doubt because so unpopular\r\nwith a majority of its readers, psychic research has an honoured\r\nplace.\r\nMr. Holt's first experience with supernormal phenomena dates\r\nback to his school-days. One of his schoolmates, a boy of\r\nsixteen or seventeen years, by placing the tips of his fingers\r\nupon a stoutly built music-stand, caused it first to tip towards\r\nhim, and, after removing his hands altogether, held it so firmly in an inclined position that the utmost efforts of two\r\nof the strongest boys present, of whom Henry Holt was one,\r\navailed only to break the heavy wooden base from the upright\r\nshaft (pp. 94-6). Later in life he encountered a supposed\r\nmedium, Charles H. Foster, who convinced him that he (Foster)\r\npossessed at least telepathic powers (Chap. XVI.). In 1894\r\nMr. Holt had a sitting with Mrs. Piper, a fairly good one, but\r\nhe saw in it nothing more than telepathy ; But my attitude regarding spiritism\u2014-that it was nothing but\r\ntelepathy from the sitter, having been fixed in my interview\r\nwith Foster, and considerable reading and intimate association\r\nwith Hodgson and some other members of the S.P.R. not\r\nhaving changed it ; and finding, at the time, in my seance with Mrs. Piper nothing but telepathy, I felt no interest in\r\nfarther personal investigation.\r\nI went away from the sitting with the conviction : \" She\r\ngave me nothing which was not in my own mind : it's the\r\nsame old story \"\r\n; and I have not been near a medium since,\r\nand do not care to go (p. 395).\r\nBut later reflection showed him seven distinct and significant\r\nitems of information which he got from her. He specifies themon pp. 397-99, and with regard to going to mediums he says :\r\nAfter this confession, my venturing to write upon the subject\r\nmay seem to others, as it often does to me, presumptuous.\r\nLXXII.] Review. 179\r\nThat view, however, would have silenced most of the his\r\ntorians : for hardly any one of them, or even any editor,\r\nwitnesses the events or hears the debates that he generalizes\r\nupon ; nor often does any philosopher discover or even witness\r\nmost of the facts that he correlates, nor (T hope I am not\r\nwearying you) any scientist most of the facts upon Avhich he\r\nbases his discoveries (p. 395).\r\nMr. Holt's convictions seem, nevertheless, to have been\r\naffected more by personal experience than by observation of\r\npsychic phenomena in others. Throughout his life he has had\r\nfrom time to time the mystic's apprehension of the reality\r\nbehind phenomena, which he, with Dr. Bucke, calls \" cosmic\r\nconsciousness \" :\r\nI cannot remember when I did not have the rudiments of\r\nit before great scenery and great music, and it culminated in\r\nme ten years before the usual period (35-45) he (Dr. Bucke)\r\nassigns. It came with the blaze of light, but the light was\r\nfrom the natural sunset which, however , seemed that evening\r\nnot confined to the far-off clouds, bat to pervade the whole\r\natmosphere and all other things, including me, and to be\r\npervaded by energy and mind and sympathy (p. 87).\r\nThe same consciousness inspires not a few striking passages :\r\nBut the powers of mystery are lovely as well as awful. The\r\nmists and mountains and dark shadows opposite me as I write, are both. I do not read their meaning, as I read the\r\nmeaning of a\r\n2 + 2ab+b2\r\n, but they lift and expand and deepen\r\nthe soul as do no meanings that I can read ; and while they\r\nraise the most terrible questions, they answer them with : \" Peace ! Wait ! Work ! Earn the rest that you feel is in Us ! All will be well ! \"\r\n(pp. 65-6).\r\nThere was certainly something prophetic, though not necessarily prophetic of my personal experience, in the exaltation\r\nbrought me before sunrise this morning in the pearl-gray sky\r\nholding one throbbing planet over dark Mount Mansfield\u2014there was something beyond my eyes, as surely as there was beyond\r\nthose of the tadpole in my pond (pp. 58-9).\r\nIn his dreams, also, of which Mr. Holt gives a tantalizingly\r\nbrief account in Chapters LIV. and LV., he feels that he sees the operations of a something not himself. From childhood he\r\nhas seen in dreams magnificent buildings, often wandering\r\namong them and returning repeatedly to the same spot ; long\r\nsuites of rooms exquisitely furnished and decorated ; tableaux,\r\npantomimes, costumes ; and all these creations display an m2\r\n180 Professor W. R. Newbold. [part\r\noriginality of conception and delicacy of taste surpassing\r\nanything within his experience :\r\n. . . never in my dreams have I seen or heard anything\r\nextraordinary in the arts where I have some trifling capacity\r\n;\r\nwhile in some arts where I have no capacity at all, I have from\r\nchildhood seen things more beautiful than any human being has\r\never made (p. 892 ; italics Mr. Holt's).\r\nMr. Holt bases his belief in the fact of survival primarily\r\nupon three dreams, in each of which a person deceased appeared\r\nto him under such circumstances that no other explanation seems to him admissible (pp. 920-23). Unfortunately, a detailed\r\nnarrative of these experiences would reveal facts of too intimate\r\na nature to be made public, and Mr. Holt's outline is too\r\nvague to enable outsiders to appreciate the weight of the\r\nevidence for survival which they afford.\r\nWith these tentative convictions in mind he began, about\r\n1908, to read the Proceedings of the S.P.R. consecutively\r\nthrough, and found his convictions strengthened by the evidence\r\nthere accumulated. This suggested the writing of On the Cosmic\r\nRelations. ... I have found the change from a disbelief in the sur- vival of bodily death, so fruitful, intellectually as well as emotionally, that I am prompted to do what I can to share it with others (p. 39G).\r\nHis estimate of his own contribution is modest : There exist better books on this department of my subject\r\n(possession) than I dare hope this is going to be, but most of\r\nthe good ones appeal principally to students who have held\r\nmany sittings ; and were begun to support theses, while I\r\nwrite for lay readers, and at least began with the intention of\r\nletting the theses regarding this part of my subject form\r\nthemselves as I should go along. Moreover my long experience\r\nas a publisher has taught me that intermediaries are needed\r\nbetween experts and lay readers. I have habitually said to\r\nexperts to whom I have suggested non-technical books : \" The\r\nright point of view must cover both knowledge and ignorance ; I can trust you for the knowledge, and I can supply the\r\nignorance.\" 1 am doing that here (p. 395).\r\nThe deprecatory tone here is of course humorous, although\r\nit not unfairly represents Mr. Holt's uniformly modest attitude\r\ntowards his own work. His detestation of pretence prompts\r\nhim frequently to call the reader's attention to his own short-\r\nLXXII.] Review. 181\r\ncomings\u2014his bias in favour of survival, his occasional inconsistency and obscurity, his inability to remove serious difficulties\u2014in brief there is little in the way of criticism which\r\nMr. Holt has not himself anticipated. This abhorrence of\r\npretence, indeed, sometimes carries him further than all readers\r\nwill follow him with pleasure. He seems to include in it the\r\ncustomary forms of our literary dialect and writes \" colloquial\r\nAmerican \" much as William James used to do, not scrupling\r\nto use a slang word or to coin a new one in order the better\r\nto express his thought. But let those who would take offence\r\nbeware ; possibly Mr. Holt and his fellow-rebels are the\r\nprecursors of a change in the canons of style.\r\nBut all this does not mean that Mr. Holt has no higher aim\r\nin view than that of awakening popular interest in psychic\r\nresearch. The points upon which he places the chief emphasis\r\nare these :\r\n(1) He would strengthen the inference from what we know of our powers of apprehending the material universe to a presumably much greater universe outside it, which will, we may\r\nhope, prove knowable, to some extent through the further\r\nevolution of our powers of apprehending Reality, but more\r\nfully after the sloughing off of the body.\r\n(2) He gives a more careful and systematic classification of\r\nthe phenomena than has hitherto been proposed.\r\n(3) He recognizes that ordinary dreams and visions are feeble\r\nexamples of the same phenomena that have been classed as\r\ncases of possession, and that both afford glimpses of the\r\nspiritual world.\r\nThe \" cosmic relations \" are the \" interactions between soul\r\nand uni verse \"\r\n(p. 6), and they are treated under three captions.\r\nBook I., on \" Correlated Knowledge \"\r\n(pp. 1-80), expounds the\r\noutlines of the author's system of philosophy. A sketch of the\r\nevolution of body, soul and universe, following in general Mr.\r\nSpencer's fines, results in the inference that the evolution of the\r\nsenses warrants anticipation of the appearance of new modes\r\nof perception, which anticipation is realized in psychical phenomena, correlated to the aspect of reality which Spencer called\r\nUnknowable, but which should rather be called Unknown.\r\nThis, as later appears, is to be identified with the spiritual\r\nworld or Cosmic Soul. Book II. (pp. 81-829) is entitled\r\n182 Professor W. R. Newbold. [part\r\n\" Uncorrelated Knowledge,\" and is devoted to a review of the\r\nleading types of supernormal, or as Mr. Holt prefers to call them, superusual phenomena, both physical and psychical,\r\nclassified under a new and rather elaborate technical ter- minology. Most of this material is drawn from the publications\r\nof the S.P.R., and it is accompanied by a running commentary\r\nand discussion designed to correlate it with the author's\r\nphilosophical system. In four chapters, XX. to XXIII., pp.\r\n294-328, he digresses from the main topic in order to develop\r\nthat system more fully. He first introduces, with due credit\r\nto Myers, James and others, the conception of the Cosmic Soul\r\n(Chap. XX.), of which (Chap. XXI.) the individual soul is but\r\na portion, and which is identical with the transcendental ego\r\nor subliminal self : The discovery, if discovery it be, that the subliminal self is the Cosmic Soul, may impress some readers as belonging in the\r\nsame class with the immortal discovery in Natural History,\r\nmade after so much investigation and reflection, that a snark\r\nis a boojum. Argument against such an impression would be\r\nwasted. The subliminal self is as much a part of accepted\r\nknowledge as is the law of association of ideas, and the\r\nCosmic Soul is at least an intiiition of most of the minds\r\nwhose intuitions have been among the most important of\r\nhumanity's guiding lights. The conception that the subliminal self and the Cosmic Soul are the same, may yet be demonstrated\r\nto a clearness that will place it among those beacons (p. 311.)\r\nIn Chap. XXII., Mind, seemingly the Cosmic Soul, is conceived, after the analogy of Spencer's \" mind-stuff,\" as : ... a redistribution, into combinations ever growing higher,\r\nof a primordial element like force and matter\u2014an element\r\ninherent in each atom of our structure, and also, like force\r\nand matter, constantly flowing into us from the external\r\nuniverse, and constantly going out (p. 314).\r\nAs such it is termed \" mind-jjotential \" because \" each\r\nproduct of mind becomes mind potential for further products \"\r\n(p. 315), as the suggestions of experience provide the material\r\nfor the artist's creations. And, last of all, in Chap. XXIII., the\r\nCosmic Soul is the seat of the Ideas described by Plato ; each one of us is such an Idea, and of it the material bodies, portraits,\r\ndream-images, etc., representing us are but copies (pp. 320-7) : Do not our latest knowledge and best thinking result in the\r\nidea\u2014old in many forms\u2014that we are but expressions of a\r\nLXXII.] Review. 183\r\nmeasureless force which is ourselves and also behind ourselves ? Would any person given to the old phraseology be very\r\nfantastic in calling us thoughts of the divine mind ? (pp. 163.)\r\nBook III., under the title \" Attempts at Correlation,\" takes\r\nup the subject of dreams and aims to prove that it is impossible to explain such trances as those of Mrs. Piper by\r\nsubsuming them under the notion of \" dreams \" ; rather must\r\nwe invert the relation and explain all dreams as being, what\r\nthese trances also are, more or less imperfect apprehensions of\r\nthe spiritual world : Now if Mrs. Piper's dream state is really one of communication with souls who have passed into a new life, dream\r\nstates generally may not extravagantly be supposed to be\r\nforetastes of that life. . . . The dream life is free from the\r\ntrammels of our waking environment and powers. In it we\r\nexperience unlimited histories in an instant ; roam over unlimited spaces ; see, hear, feel, touch, taste, smell, enjoy\r\nunlimited things ; walk, swim, fly, change things with unlimited\r\nspeed ; do things with unlimited power ; make what we will\r\n\r\nmusic, poetry, objects of art, situations, dramas, with unlimited faculty, and enjoy unlimited society (pp. 925-6).\r\nThe suggestion has come to more than one student, and to\r\nme very strongly, that when we enter into life\u2014as spermatozoa,\r\nor star-dust, if you please\u2014we enter into the eternal life, but\r\nthat the physical conditions essential to our development into\r\nappreciating it are a sort of veil between it and our consciousness. In our waking life we know it only through the veil ; but when in sleep or trance, the material environment is removed from consciousness, the veil becomes that much\r\nthinner, and we get better glimpses of the transcendent reality.\r\nNotwithstanding its Spencerian colouring, then, Mr. Holt's\r\nphilosophy is a form of Idealism or Spiritualism closely akin to\r\nthat of Mr. Myers. Indeed, the only really important departure\r\nfrom Myers' point of view is the abandonment of the subliminal self as an intermediary between the individual empirical\r\nself and the Cosmic Soul, from which results a much freer use\r\nof the conception of the Cosmic Soul as an explanatory principle and the substitution of the telepathic \" inflow \" from the\r\nCosmic Soul for Myers' \" subliminal uprush \" :\r\nThe idea of a transcendent ego seems to have come from\r\nthe idea of a transcendent universe. But the transcendent\r\nuniverse is virtually demonstrable, while the transcendent ego,\r\nas a purely individual quality independent of the cosmic soul,\r\n184 Professor W. R. Newbold. [partseems far from demonstrable, and indeed counter to the indications of evolution ; for evolution apparently produces only\r\nthe known ego resulting from interactions between the knownself and the known environment. Anything more must apparently be an inflow from outside the known universe (p. 309).\r\nTo the phenomena of the Piper trance Mr. Holt devotes\r\nnearly one-half of his book (pp. 380-829), and those of us to whom they have been a standing puzzle for years\u2014and to\r\nwhom have they not ? \u2014will probably be especially interested\r\nin the solution which he would propose for them.\r\nHe accepts as genuine in the main, although not without\r\nrepugnance, the communicators of the period when Plhnuit andG. P. 1 were in control, and in his running commentary on the\r\nsittings emphasizes more than any one else has done the\r\nimportance of the \" dramatic element \" as rendering any other\r\ninterpretation unacceptable.\r\nBut when Mr. Holt comes to the period in which W. S. Moses, George Eliot, Imperator and their associates are supreme,\r\nhe is sorely perplexed. He is inclined to put faith in the\r\ngenuineness of G. P. and his friends ; they guarantee the\r\nexistence and character of the Imperator Band, yet he cannot\r\nbring himself to accept the guarantee.\r\nOn p. 547 he suggests, although seemingly without muchconviction, that, since the evidence of the Piper-Moses con1 Since Mr. Holt is one of the few now living who was well acquainted\r\nwith G. P. in the flesh, his characterization of him may be of interest to the many who know the G. P. of Mrs. Piper's trance : \" I have often wondered why, of all people who have died since G. P. reached maturity,\r\nhe should have been the [most prominent ?] one to show up through, or be shown up by, Mrs. Piper. In habits and appearance he was an\r\nexceptionally unobtrusive personality. In a roomful of people he was\r\nperhaps the last one to impress a stranger or be engaged with a friend,\r\nexcept as his presence became noticed through his ingenious and tenacious support of some theory opposed to the convictions of the majority.\r\nIf the room were not full, but shared with him by only a few congenial\r\npersons, his presence would at once be felt as of value. Had he lived\r\nlonger, his literary and philosophical tastes might have made him\r\nwidely known. He had a few close and warm friends in intellectual\r\ncircles in both New York and Boston, but to the world in general he\r\ndied unknown, and to the average members of the more intelligent\r\npolite world who were friends of his exceptionally prominent family\r\nhistoric on both sides, he was the retiring, somewhat eccentric, comparatively unknown member \" (p. 540).\r\nLXXII.] Review. 185\r\ntradicts in certain points the evidence of Moses in the flesh,\r\nboth should be ignored as nullifying each other and the case decided on the remaining evidence.\r\nElsewhere (pp. 579-81) he proposes the tentative theory that\r\nthe Pi^er-Moses originated in a telepathic impression, or,\r\nrather, from both oral and telepathic suggestions received from\r\nsitters (myself and, later, Hodgson) ; this dream-Moses then\r\nattracted the hypothetic spirit-Moses, who at first blended with\r\nand later virtually absorbed and obliterated the dream. The\r\nImperator Band were, possibly, originated in the same way by\r\nHodgson's conveying telepathically to Mrs. Piper his impressions from W. S. Moses, \" with perhaps some involuntary\r\ninitiative and assistance from Professor Newbold \"\r\n(p. 579), but,\r\nof course, could not attract the spirits in question because the\r\nlatter do not exist at all. The evidence of the possibly genuine\r\nspirits for the reality of the spurious spirits is dismissed (pp.\r\n586-7) as simply unreliable. They met them \" in the medium's\r\nmind \" and mistook them for spirits like themselves.\r\nBut G. P., and Hodgson later as control, profess to be\r\nseeing and talking with these people constantly ! So did Moses\r\nwhen he was here, and he was genuine enough here. He may\r\nhave been fooled, but if he was, he lost none of his own\r\nactuality. And if the controls G. P. and Hodgson are fooled\r\nin the same way, I don't see how it affects their genuineness,\r\nany more than it affected the genuineness of Moses incarnate\r\n(p. 587).\r\nI do not think, nor does Mr. Holt think, that he has solved\r\nthe Piper problem, although I believe him to be right in many\r\nof his contentions, but he has nevertheless given us a valuable\r\nbook, in my opinion indeed the best survey of the evidence\r\nthat has appeared since Myers' epoch-making Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death. Not, of course, that\r\nit is a rival of the latter as a work of philosophical synthesis\r\n\r\nMr. Holt would be the first to pooh-pooh such a claim. If he\r\nwould admit any rivalry it would probably be in analysis, for\r\nhe has offered a classification which includes both the kinetic\r\nand psychic phenomena, while Myers deals with the latter only.\r\nBut the book is especially well adapted to bring home to the\r\nreader the force of the empirical evidence for psychic phenomena, and especially for those which indicate survival of death,\r\nand to point out to him one way in which the neAv knowledge\r\n186 Professor W. R. Newbold. [part\r\nmay be incorporated into the Avorld-view now current. Andalthough Mr. Holt frankly pleads a cause, he does not ignore\r\nthe difficulties which attend it. Indeed, if I am not mistaken,\r\nhe is the first writer who, while concerned to maintain the\r\nspiritistic origin of the Piper communcations, has grappled in\r\nthe open with the formidable difficulties raised by the appear- ance of Sir Walter Scott, George Eliot and the Imperator Bandas communicators. The very traits which are usually accounted\r\nfaults in a book\u2014unconventional diction, diffuseness, occasional\r\nacknowledged inconsistency and inconclusiveness\u2014will make its appeal the stronger to the average reader. They deepen his\r\nappreciation of the frankness with which Mr. Holt, a man of\r\ntrained judgment, ripe experience and strong convictions, reveals\r\nhow he has been converted from lifelong scepticism to a belief\r\nnot the less sincere because commingled with perplexity, and,\r\nas the reader watches the struggle in Mr. Holt's mind between\r\nthe old disbelief, which is probably his own state of mind as\r\nwell, and the new evidence, he can scarcely fail to be drawn\r\ninto the contest himself. He may not be led to accept Mr.\r\nHolt's conclusions but he will be impressed with the reality of\r\nthe problems and feel more sympathy with those who are endeavouring to solve them. TTT _ , T W.

Price\r\n7s. 6d. net.)\r\nAll who realize the value of cross-fertilization in advancing the\r\nsciences must long have wondered why no one has ever set himself to correlate systematically the results of normal with\r\nthose of abnormal psychology. For though it seems a (pardonable) exaggeration when Dr. Sidis declares (p. 48) that \" Knowledge of the normal arises out of knowledge of the abnormal \"\r\nand that \" we may even say that the normal itself originates\r\nin the abnormal,\" it must be admitted that abnormal psychology has at its command a distinct method, that of clinical\r\nexperiment, which is quite as definite as those of normal\r\npsychology, introspection and laboratory experimentation, which\r\nLXXII.] Review. 187\r\nhas certain advantages and is free from certain defects which\r\nbeset the latter. The results of the psychologist's self-inspection are apt to be disappointing and to reveal little that is enlightening,\r\nso long as he looks at random and without knowing what to\r\nlook for, while if he looks merely to find confirmation of bis\r\ntheory of psychology, his results may easily be misleading.\r\nAgain the relatively exact control which is possible in the\r\nlaboratory experiment is more than counterbalanced by the\r\ndrawbacks of setting the mind functioning under artificial and\r\nunnatural conditions and for trivial objects. On the other hand,\r\nthe fact that the students of abnormal psychology are mostly\r\nprofessional men who have a definite therapeutic aim and have\r\nto apply their theories, is a valuable guarantee that they will\r\nbe properly and severely tested. Medical men cannot afford to\r\nentertain theories which are meaningless or devoid of application and are merely futile exercises in academic ingenuity.\r\nTheir theories have got to work, and are discarded if they do\r\nnot. Not, of course, that it is prudent to conclude from the mere fact that a theory works that it is absolutely and indefeasibly true ; it may be obscure, inherently improbable,\r\nincoherent and even self-contradictory, and yet work better\r\nthan any alternative that has yet occurred to any one. It may, however, safely be inferred that a theory that works must\r\ncontain some truth and is somehow built on the right lines.\r\nIt was then a happy thought of Dr. Sidis's to develop his\r\npsychological theories in connexion with his psychiatric practice : moreover, his remarkable work on Multiple Personality,\r\nwhich he wrote a dozen years ago in conjunction with Dr.\r\nGoodhart and which described the classic case of the Rev. Mr.\r\nHanna, justified the highest expectations. These the present\r\nwork can hardly be said to fulfil, nor does it supersede Multiple Personality. It has not the concrete interest given to the\r\nformer volume by the narration of illustrative cases ; it contains practically no stories and not even references. The\r\nfirst half is devoted to a discussion of the fundamental principles of psychology which is more ambitious than successful.\r\nFor it is probably impossible to cover so much difficult and\r\ndisputed ground in two hundred pages without giving an\r\nimpression of dogmatism, and without doing apparent injustice\r\nto many theories which are dealt with too briefly.\r\n188 Dr. F. C. 8. Schiller. [part\r\nFor example, in spite of Dr. Sidis's admiration for William\r\nJames, which is once more attested in his dedication, he\r\nhardly treats the ' transmission ' theory of the relation between\r\nbody and mind at all fairly, nor appreciates its logical importance. He has not seen that its mere formulation invalidates the whole of the evidence to which the materialist\r\ntheory had been wont to appeal. Materialism had always\r\ninterpreted the apparent conditioning of mental process by\r\nphysical as meaning that the latter is productive of the former.\r\nBut so soon as the transmission theory suggests an alternative\r\ninterpretation, the whole of this argument breaks down.\r\nInstead of assuming that the correlation of the physical and\r\nthe psychical proves that the physical process produces the\r\nphenomena of consciousness, we can now just as well say that\r\nit merely transmits consciousness and conditions only its modes\r\nof manifestation. No facts, therefore, remain to which\r\nmaterialism can lay exclusive claim ; no coercive proof of\r\nmaterialism therefore remains possible, while there is no similar\r\ndifficulty in conceiving evidence which would be positively\r\nincompatible with the truth of materialism. The transmission\r\ntheory therefore involves a great weakening of materialism\r\nwhich puts it permanently on the defensive, while it is not\r\nitself exposed to attack. For the charges which Dr. Sidis\r\nbrings against it seem all to rest on misapprehensions. He\r\naccuses it of postulating an additional world of disembodied\r\nconsciousness which \" cannot be drawn into the circle of\r\nexjierience \" and exists \" from all eternity in a region outside\r\nand totally independent of the brain \"\r\n(p. 62), and so of\r\ngratuitously multiplying entities. All this is erroneous. The\r\nquestion is quite empirical and is simply whether it is more\r\nconvenient to regard the correlation of body and mind in one way or in another. Both ways are thinkable, and no facts\r\nthat can possibly be discovered about the relations between the\r\ntwo sides of the psycho -physical individual can possibly decide\r\nbetween them. But if a psychic entity should show itself capable of manifesting through other bodies than the one called\r\nits own, this would yield a decision in favour of the transmission theory. Not that it would prove a ' disembodied '\r\nconsciousness ; it would establish only that consciousness was\r\ncapable of manifesting through more than one ' body.' Nor\r\nLXXII.] Review. 189\r\nwould it, as such, convey any information about any transcendent world ; it would be concerned with nothing but facts\r\nof experience and their interpretation.\r\nOf course the failure to dispose of the transmission theory\r\nvery seriously affects the subsequent discussion of ' voluntaristic ' psychology, which Dr. Sidis strangely treats as an attempt \" to make of psychology a science independent of all physiology \" and to do without physiological ' cement ' to fasten up the psychological material (p. 86), and the form of\r\npsycho -physical parallelism he himself adopts. For Dr. Sidis\r\nalso, like all who conceive parallelism as more than a methodological convenience, fails to keep up the parallelism. He\r\ndeclares (p. 81) that \"every psychic change must 1 have its physiological concomitant\" but will only concede that \" every\r\nphysiological process may 1 have its psychic accompaniment.\"\r\nIn the absence of any transmission theory this inconsistency\r\nforces him back into the materialism he had tried to disavow.\r\nThe analysis of the abnormal mind which fills the second\r\nhalf of Dr. Sidis's book is built up on what he calls the theory\r\nof the moment-consciousness. This theory had already made\r\nits appearance in Multiple Personality ; its present restatement\r\nhas been complicated and rendered more technical in its terminology, but not otherwise improved. The notion of\r\n' moment-consciousness ' or ' moment ' is defined (p. 231) in\r\nterms of ' the synthetic unity of consciousness,' and plainly\r\nrests on the assumption that the problem of mental life is essentially one of synthesis, i.e. of explaining how a discrete\r\nplurality of psychic states can ever be fused into a unity or\r\nwhole. Dr. Sidis is clearly aware of the difficulty J. S. Mill\r\ngot himself into by analysing the mind into a series of events\r\nand then conceiving its unity as a superadded event (p. 231).\r\nBut he hardly seems to be aware, how antique this philosophic\r\ndifficulty is, or that Hume's analysis of the self had failed at\r\nexactly the same point, and that Kant's elaborate system was\r\nentirely necessitated by the need of devising machinery for the\r\nsynthesis of the discrete sensations he had accepted from\r\nHume. And it is very remarkable that Dr. Sidis has not seen\r\nthat this whole putting of the problem has been completely\r\nantiquated by William James. By declaring that mental life\r\n1 Italics mine.\r\n190 Dr. F. C. 8. Schiller. [part\r\nforms a continuum or ' stream,' he rejected on principle the\r\ncommon assumption of previous psychology that it had to be\r\ncompacted out of separate events, ' states,' ' sensations,' or\r\n'impressions,' and rendered superfluous all the traditional\r\ndevices for unifying them into a consciousness. For it follows\r\nthat the problem of psychology is no longer ' synthesis ' but\r\n' analysis.' How and why, that is, is the continuous flow of\r\nexperience broken up into a plurality of perceptions, things,\r\nand ideas ? The answer comes easily. We analyse our ex- perience in the ways indicated by our interests, purposes and\r\nbiological needs of adaptation to the conditions of life. But\r\nthe plural things we distinguish are not really separated from\r\nthe continuum in which they occur, and relapse into it when\r\nwe have done with them. Nor is it incompatible with this\r\ndescription of psychic process to observe the apparently fortuitous character of much that comes up in the mind (cf.\r\npp. 99-100). For purposiveness is shown in selection, and\r\nselection implies a superabundance of material, some of which\r\nis rejected. Only we must not infer with Dr. Sidis that \" not\r\npurpose, but chance is at the heart of mental life.\" For there\r\nis no reason to regard the raw materials as more valuable and\r\ncharacteristic than the finished product.\r\nThe notion of the ' moment -consciousness ' then does not\r\nseem to be consistent with Dr. Sidis's acceptance of James's\r\nnotion of the ' stream of consciousness.' And I fail to see also\r\nthat it develops any descriptive advantages in dealing with the\r\ncomplex phenomena of multiple personality. It appears to\r\nrequire vast amounts of unverified (and largely unverifiable)\r\nhypothesis in rising from the elementary form it is supposed to\r\ntake in the amoeba to the ' synthetic recognitive moment ' of a\r\nself-conscious person and not a little uncritical metaphor. Dr.\r\nSidis's reader is continually tempted to inquire e.g. what is really\r\nmeant by a psychic ' element ' (p. 317), by the ' identity ' of\r\n' recurrence ' of psychic ' states ' (p. 370), and by their ' copying,'\r\n1 reproducing ' and ' representing ' each other. Dr. Sidis seems blissfully unaware of the troubles philosophers have had\r\nwith all these popular notions, and it is hard to believe that\r\nthe technique and success of his method of ' l^pnoidization '\r\ncan really depend on any association with such very dubious\r\npsychology. On the other hand, it is a pleasure to recognize\r\nLXXII.] Review. 191\r\nthat Dr. Sidis is very clear that there is no difference in\r\npsychological nature between percepts and hallucinations (pp.\r\n149-50). For one great reason why psychologists have failed\r\nso often to devise a tenable theory of perception is that\r\nthey have failed to connect true perception with false, and to\r\nsee that the difference between a perception of reality and a\r\nhallucination does not lie in the psychological experience, but\r\nis essentially one in the value of the product.\r\nP. C. S. Schiller.\r\n3\r\nCollected Papers on Analytical Psychology. By C. G. Jung,\r\nM.D., LL.D. Authorised translation edited by Dr. Constance E. Long. (Bailliere, Tind?U and Cox. London.\r\n1916. Pp. xvi + 392. Price 12s. 6d. net.)\r\nThis volume consists of a collection of articles and pamphlets\r\nwritten by Dr. Jung of Zurich during the past fourteen years.\r\nThe majority of these papers deal with various aspects of\r\npsycho (analysis, and by bringing them together in book form\r\nDr. Constance Long has earned the gratitude of all students\r\nof this subject. They are printed in chronological order,\r\nand we can thus trace the gradual growth of some of the\r\ndoctrines which are especially characteristic of the Zurich\r\nschool.\r\nHitherto judgments of the value of psycho-analysis as a method of psychological investigation and as a mode of therapy\r\nhave been based mainly on the writings of Freud and his\r\nfollowers, and, as is well known, the views put forward by\r\nthem have met with much opposition and protest from many\r\nquarters. In some respects Jung's teaching will appear less objectionable than that of the Vienna school, and Dr. Long,\r\nin her preface, says,\r\nlt It will be a relief to many students\r\nof the Unconscious to see in it another aspect than that of ' a\r\nwild beast couched, waiting its hour to spring.' \" But Dr.\r\nLong would be the first to admit that the question as to\r\nwhich view is the less objectionable is a small matter compared\r\nwith the question as to which view is the more true.\r\n192 Dr. T. W. Mitchell. [part\r\nDr. Jung tells us that it is not his intention to give a\r\npresentation of the fundamental concepts of analytical psychology in this book. It will indeed appeal chiefly to those\r\nwho already have some knowledge of the subject and have\r\nfollowed the development of psycho-analytic theory and practice\r\nin recent years. On the whole it is supplementary to and\r\ncorroborative of the work of the Vienna school, and the\r\ncriticisms that may legitimately be levelled against Freud's\r\nviews are equally applicable to much of what Jung has written.\r\nNevertheless, there are in this book several new points of\r\nview so fundamentally important and so opposed to what\r\nhas been hitherto taught that they have led to a schism\r\nin the psycho-analytic world. The main points of difference\r\nbetween the two schools are most clearly revealed in Jung's\r\nconclusions regarding the aetiology of the neuroses and in\r\nhis views on the significance and interpretation of dream\r\nsymbolism. It is perhaps in his treatment of symbolism\r\nthat he breaks away most fundamentally from Freud and\r\nhis disciples.\r\nFrom the very beginning of the psycho-analytic movement\r\nthe importance of dreams has been insisted upon. Freud\r\ndeclared the interpretation of dreams to be \" the via regia\r\nto the interpretation of the unconscious, the surest ground\r\nof psycho-analysis, and a field in which every worker must\r\nwin his convictions and gain his education.\" According to\r\nhim every dream is the disguised fulfilment of an unconscious\r\nwish. The wish is unconscious because it has been repressed.\r\nIt has been repressed because it is the outcome of some\r\nprimitive craving whose realization is incompatible with the\r\nethical and cultural standards of the individual. In the\r\nwaking state it is prevented from entering consciousness by a\r\nsort of censorship which is always at work during waking\r\nhours. But in sleep this censorship is relaxed to some extent,\r\nand the unconscious wishes get a chance of showing themselves.\r\nThey are not allowed, however, to appear in undisguised\r\nform. Did they do so, the sleeper would awake. The function\r\nof the dream is to protect sleep by so distorting these insistent\r\nthoughts of the unconscious that their true significance is unrecognizable, and the dreamer may therefore continue to\r\nsleep. In bringing about the necessary distortion of the\r\nLXXII.] Review. 193\r\ntrue dream thoughts, the unconscious makes use of a sort\r\nof symbolism, especially, Freud says, in the presentation of\r\nsexual complexes.\r\nNow one of the most important features of Jung's work\r\nis his exposition of the conception of the dream which his\r\nexperience has forced upon him\u2014a conception fundamentally\r\ndifferent in many respects from that put forward by Freud.\r\nAnd this difference in the two rival conceptions of the dream\r\nseems mainly to depend on a difference hi the interpretation\r\nof the significance and value of psychological symbols. Jung\r\nsays (p. 222), \" According to Freud, the dream is in its essence a symbolic veil for repressed desires which are in conflict with\r\nthe ideals of personality. I am obliged to regard the dream\r\nstructure from a different point of view. The dream for me\r\nis, in the first instance, the subliminal picture of the psychological condition of the individual in his waking state. It presents a resume of the subliminal associative material which\r\nis brought together by the momentary psychological situation.\"\r\nThus for Freud the dream symbol is merely a sign or token representing primitive psycho-sexual tendencies, and\r\nis dependent wholly on historical causes. For Jung the\r\nsymbol has a positive value. It has a meaning for the\r\nactual present and for the future. It is an attempt at comprehension by means of analogy, and an ' endeavour to solve\r\nthe actual problems of the dreamer's life. As Jung says,\r\nin his preface, \" To the Zurich school the symbol is not merely\r\na sign of something repressed and concealed, but is at the\r\nsame time an attempt to comprehend and to point out\r\nthe way of the further psychological development of the\r\nindividual.\"\r\nAlthough Jung thus teaches that we must regard the fundamental thoughts and impulses of the unconscious as symbols\r\nindicative of a definite line of future development, he feels compelled to make the somewhat startling admission that\r\nthere is \" no scientific justification for such a procedure,\r\nbecause our present day science is based as a whole upon\r\ncausality.\" He defends himself, however, by maintaining\r\nthat \" causality is only one principle, and psychology essentially\r\ncannot be exhausted by causal methods oidy, because the\r\nmind lives by aims as well \"\r\n(p. ix). He seems to realize\r\n194 Dr. T. W. Mitchell. [part\r\nthat he is here entering upon very debatable territory, and\r\nthat any real attempt to justify the position he takes up\r\nwould entail a disquisition on certain philosophical topics\r\nwhich would carry him far from the immediate purpose of\r\nhis work. It is only in isolated sentences or paragraphs\r\nthat he even hints at the difficulties inherent in the views\r\nhe holds. It may be that the real ground of dispute is the old battle-ground of freedom and necessity. Jung disputes\r\nthe completeness of Freud's view as a scientific explanation\r\nof dream psychology, because \" the psyche cannot be con- ceived merely from the causal aspect ; but necessitates also a final view-point.\" But, the determinist says, if the end is determined it can be dealt with from the causal aspect\r\n;\r\nif the end is not determined no science of man is possible.\r\nThere would seem to be a fundamental difference between\r\nJung and Freud in their attitude towards human personality.\r\nAccording to Freud the unconscious motive of every human\r\nactivity is a desire for pleasure, and the ends or aims of\r\nthe unconscious are always the immediate gratification of\r\nits desires. Thus the aim of the dream is attained in the\r\nsymbolised realization of the unconscious wish, and the interpretation of the dream consists in finding the true dream\r\nthoughts in the associative material which groups itself round\r\nthe different parts of the dream. In the last analysis these\r\nthoughts are always the expression of infantile, primitive\r\ncravings and are unacceptable to the conscious personality.\r\nThey are of a universal and elementary character, but they\r\nmay be disguised in the dream under manifold forms.\r\nThis, Jung says, is the result of applying only the principle\r\nof \" causality \" to the material associated with the dream ; \" we reduce the manifest dream content to certain fundamental\r\ntendencies or ideas.\" But if we use the principle of \" finality,\"\r\nthe dream may be shown to have quite another significance.\r\nWe may ask of the dream, as of any other psychic activity : What is its purpose ? And Jung sees in the dream not\r\nmerely the fulfilment of an unconscious wish but an attempt\r\nat the solution of some unsolved problem, the settling of\r\nsome unconscious conflict. Jung would have us believe that\r\nthere is in man a \" psyche \" whose purposes are not abrogated even in sleep, though its activities may be obscured, and\r\nLxxn.] Review. 195\r\nthat in dream the primordial tendencies of the unconscious\r\nare utilized as a means of siibconscious expression of the\r\nways by which these purposes may be achieved. Thus the\r\nsymbol of the dream may play a part in the moral education\r\nof the individual similar to that which the religious symbol\r\nhas played in the history of civilization.\r\nT. W.

Gerald W. Balfour.\r\nOn the 26th of August, 1910, the automatist who is already well known to members of the Society under\r\nthe name of Mrs. Willett sat for script with Mrs. VerralJ.\r\nThe script produced on this occasion, partly written\r\nand partly dictated\u2014I use the word script for convenience' sake to include the spoken as well as the\r\nwritten word\u2014contained the phrase \" Dionysius' Ear\r\nthe lobe.\" The phrase occurred in the dictated part\r\nof the script, and the name Dionysius was pronounced\r\nas in Italian. It has no obvious relevance to the\r\ncontext, and this first appearance of it in Willett Script\r\nremains even now without any satisfactory explanation.\r\n1 This Paper was read at a meeting of the Society on November 9th,\r\n1916, substantially in the form in which it is now published, except\r\nthat considerable additions have been made to the argumentative\r\nportion.\r\n19 S The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nTo Mrs. Verrall herself, as we shall see presently,\r\nthe words conveyed at the time no meaning whatever.\r\nAs a good many of my audience may be in like case with her, I had best explain at the outset that the\r\nEar of Dionysius is a kind of grotto hewn in the solid\r\nrock at Syracuse and opening on one of the stone\r\nquarries which served as a place of captivity for the\r\nAthenian prisoners of war who fell into the hands\r\nof the victorious Syracusans after the failure of the\r\nfamous siege so graphically described by Thucydides.\r\nA few years later these quarries were again used as\r\nprisons by the elder Dionysius, Tyrant of Syracuse.\r\nThe grotto of which I have spoken has the peculiar\r\nacoustic properties of a whispering gallery, and is traditionally believed to have been constructed or utilised\r\nby the Tyrant in order to overhear, himself unseen,\r\nthe conversations of his prisoners. Partly for this\r\nreason, and partly from a fancied resemblance to the\r\ninterior of a donkey's ear, it came to be called TJOrecchio\r\ndi Dionisio, or the Ear of Dionysius ; but the name\r\nonly dates from the sixteenth century. The grotto is\r\nstill one of the objects of interest which every visitor to\r\nSyracuse is taken to see.\r\nNo further reference was made in any Willett Script\r\nto the Ear of Dionysius until more than three years\r\nlater. The subject was first revived in a script written\r\nin the presence of Sir' Oliver Lodge on the 10th of\r\nJanuary, 1914. The sitting was a very long one; and\r\nin the course of it occurred the following passage.\r\nA.\r\n(Extract from Script of Jan. 10, 1914.)\r\nDo you remember you did not know and I complained of\r\nyour classical ignorance ignorance\r\nIt concerned a place where slaves were kept\u2014and Audition\r\nbelongs, also Acoustics\r\nThink of the Whispering Gaily\r\nLXXIH.] The Ear of Dionysius. 199\r\nTo toil, a slave, the Tyrant\u2014and it was called Orecchio\r\n\r\nthat's near One Ear, a one eared place, not a one horsed dawn [here\r\nthe automatist laughed slightly], a one eared place\u2014You did\r\nnot know (or remember) about it when it came up in conversation, and I said Well what is the use of a classical\r\neducation\r\n\r\nWhere were the fields of Enna\r\n[Drawing of an ear.] an ear ly pipe could be heard\r\nTo sail for Syracuse\r\nWho beat the loud-sounding wave, who smote the moving\r\nfurrows\r\nThe heel of the Boot\r\nDy Dy . and then you think of Diana Dimorphism\r\nTo fly to find Euripides\r\nnot the Pauline Philemon\r\nThis sort of thing is more difficult to do than it looked.\r\nThere are several interesting points to be noted in\r\nconnection with this passage. Earlier in the script it was stated that a message was to be sent to Mrs. Verrall ; but at the point where the extract commences, Mrs.\r\nVerrall is directly addressed in the second person, although\r\nshe was not herself present. The communication must\r\nbe taken as purporting to come from Dr. A. W. Verrall,\r\nthe incident recalled in the extract having actually\r\nhappened very much as described. I will relate it in the\r\nwords of Mrs. Verrall's own note, written on Jan. 19, 1914,\r\nafter this portion of the script had been shown to her.\r\nMy typed note on the Willett Script of Aug. 26,\r\n1910, is as follows : '\" ; Dionysius' Ear the lobe ' is unintelligible to me. A. W. V. says it is the name of a\r\nplace at Syracuse where D. could overhear conversations.\"\r\nThis makes clear what was instantly recalled to me on\r\nhearing the Willett Script of Jan. 10, that I did not\r\nknow, or had forgotten, what the Ear of Dionysius was,\r\nand that I asked A. W. V. to explain it. I cannot say\r\nwhether on that occasion he asked \" What is the use\r\nof a classical education ? \" but he expressed considerable\r\n200 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nsurprise at my ignorance, and the phrase of the script\r\nrecalls\u2014though it does not, I think, reproduce\u2014similar\r\nremarks of his on like occasions.\r\nThe incident to me is very striking. I am quite\r\nsure that Mrs. Willett was not present when I asked\r\nA. W. V. about the Ear of Dionysius ; no one was\r\npresent except A. W. V. and myself. . . . She therefore\r\nhad no reason to suppose that on this particular subject,\r\nof the Ear of Dionysius, my information had been\r\nobtained from A. W. V. On the other hand, the form\r\ngiven to my contemporary note\u2014\" A. W. V. says etc.\"\r\nconfirms my own vivid recollection of the incident above\r\ndescribed. It is not easy, I think, to devise a more\r\nconvincing single incident.\r\nThe incident is certainly striking ; bat I have to\r\nconfess that its evidential force is weakened by a dim\r\nthough haunting recollection on my part of a conversation having taken place between Mrs. Willett and me\r\nsometime previously on this very subject of Dionysius'\r\nEar. She has no memory of it herself ; but I still think she told me one day that the words \" Ear of\r\nDionysius \" had been running in her head, and asked\r\nme what they meant ; whereupon I explained, adding\r\nthat they had come in one of her own scripts several\r\nyears before. I do not believe I referred to Mrs. Verrall, or to Dr. Verrall's having rallied her upon her ignorance.\r\nBut as I had been told of the incident by Mrs. Verrall\r\nherself shortly after it occurred, it is just possible I may\r\nhave done so ; and this possibility spoils what would\r\notherwise have been a good piece of evidence.\r\nReturning now to the extract from the Willett Script of\r\nJan. 10, 1914, I proceed to apply a running commentary to\r\nthe other allusions, certain or probable, which it contains.\r\nThe \" place where slaves were kept \" refers of course\r\nto the stone quarries where the Athenian captives were\r\nimprisoned. The words that follow describe the Ear of\r\nDionysius, with its peculiar acoustic properties. Dionysius\r\nhimself is not named either in this cr in the succeeding\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 201\r\nscripts to which I shall presently call attention ; though\r\nthe syllables \" Dy Dy \" towards the end of the extract\r\nprobably represent an attempt at the name. The use\r\nof the Italian for Ear, Orecchio, is noteworthy, and recalls\r\nthe Italian pronunciation of \" Dionysius \" in the earlier\r\nscript. I may say that Mrs. Willett knows Italian\r\nand has spent some time in Italy, though she has never\r\nbeen in Sicily. Much play is made later on with the\r\nphrase \" a one-eared place.\" It seems to have little\r\npoint in the j)resent extract save to bring in our old\r\nfriend the \" one-horsed dawn \"\u2014an appropriate reminis- cence for Dr. Verrall, as readers of the Proceedings will\r\nnot require to be told. 1 Sir Oliver Lodge's record tells us that the automatist laughed as she wrote \" not a one- horsed dawn.\" From my experience of Willett Script I\r\nhave no doubt that the laugb represents amusement on\r\nthe part of the communicator, not on that of the automatist herself. It is Dr. Verrall\u2014or the personality purporting to be Dr. Verrall \u2014who laughs as he transmits the\r\nwords ; the laughter of the automatist is but an echo.\r\nThe meadows of Enna, a town in Sicily, were famous\r\nin antiquity as the scene of the Rape of Proserpine.\r\nThey are introduced here either to indicate Sicily as the\r\ncountry with which the message is concerned, or, more\r\nprobably, to add to the various literary and historical\r\nassociations which are piled up in this and the immediately succeeding scripts.\r\nAnother such association, and a strangely far-fetched\r\none, seems to be dragged in in the next line \" An\r\near ly pipe could be heard.\" The allusion here is apparently to the lines in Tennyson's well-known poem \" Tears,\r\nidle tears \" : 2 \" The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds\r\nTo dying ears.\"\r\n1 The words \" a one-horsed dawn\" refer to a telepathic experiment\r\ntried by Dr. Verrall in his life-time on Mrs. Verrall, of which a full account was published by her in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XX., pp. 156-\r\n167. See also Proceedings, Vol. XXVII., pp. 237-238.\r\n2 Since this Paper was written it has been suggested to me that the\r\n\" pip0 \" is the shepherd's pipe, and that the allusion is to Theocritus,\r\n202 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nThe bringing of this poem into forced connection with\r\nthe Ear of Dionysius, and that by means of an abominable pun, is certainly not characteristic of the automatist.\r\nI doubt however whether Dr. Verrall's intimates would\r\nscout it as a sally impossible to his more pla}^ful moments. Indeed, there may even be an evidential point\r\nabout the jest ; for Mrs. Verrall writes in her contemporary note : \" The non-serious or parody-like introduction of\r\nthis poem is consistent with the feeling of the supposed\r\ncommunicator ; A. W. V. always considered the sentiment of the poem somewhat overstrained, and maintained\r\nthat that view was warranted by Tennyson's own description of Ida's reception of it ' with some disdain,' as a fancy ' hatched in silken folded idleness.' \" The next reference in the script is almost certainly\r\nto the ill-fated Athenian expedition against Syracuse.\r\nThe words \" who beat the loud sounding wave, who\r\nsmote the moving furrows \" are probably reminiscent\r\nof Tennyson's Ulysses : \" Sitting well in order smite\r\nThe sounding furrows,\"\r\nthough I do not think that any allusion to Ulysses\r\nis intended here, in spite of the fact that he plays, as we shall see, an important part in subsequent developments. \" The heel of the Boot \" may be taken to\r\nindicate the route followed by the Athenian fleet, which\r\npassed from Corcyra to Tarentum in the heel of Italy,\r\nthence coasted along to the toe, and so reached Sicily. \" Dy Dy \" I have already explained as probably an\r\nattempt at the name Dionysius. The communicator\r\nfails to get the whole name through, and then addressing the automatist, who repeats his language, reproaches\r\nher with thinking of words beginning with Di which\r\nare not what he wants.\r\nThe final allusion in the extract calls for a somewhat\r\nlonger comment. A script written by Mrs. Holland\r\nthe famous Sicilian bucolic poet. Theocritus is said to have imitated\r\nthe Cyclops of Philoxenus in his eleventh idyll. I am still inclined to prefer the explanation given in the text.\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 203\r\nm 1907 contains the words \"To fly to find Euripides\r\nPhilemon.\" The script is quoted by Mr. Piddington\r\nin Volume XXII. of the Proceedings (p. 215), and the\r\nsource of the reference to Euripides and Philemon\r\ngiven\u2014namely, Browning's Aristophanes' Apology or the\r\nLast Adventure of Balaustion.\r\nIn Aristophanes' Apology [writes Mr. Piddington]\r\nBalaustion tells to Philemon the story of how, on the\r\nnight on which news of the death of Euripides reached\r\nAthens, Aristophanes, flushed with wine and with the\r\nsuccess of his Thesrnophoriazousm came to her house and\r\nthere justified his attacks on the dead poet ; and of\r\nhow, the apology ended, Balaustion read to Aristophanes\r\nand the assembled company the Hercules Furens, the\r\noriginal tablets of which Euripides had presented to her\r\nas a parting gift. The poem ends by Balaustion telling\r\nPhilemon that she sent the original tablets to Dionysius,\r\ntyrant of Sicily, who placed them in a temple of Apollo\r\nwith this inscription :\r\n'\r\n' I also loved\r\nThe poet, Free Athenai cheaply prized\r\n\r\nKing Dionusios,\u2014Archelaos like.\"\r\nBalaustion then asks Philemon\r\n\"If he too have not made a votive verse ! \" and\r\nPhilemon replies : \" Grant, in good sooth, our great dead, all the same,\r\nRetain their sense, as certain wise men say,\r\nI'd hang myself\u2014to see Euripides.\"\r\nMrs. Willett has not read Aristophanes' Apology. She\r\nhad, however, seen the Holland Script, and recognised\r\nat the time that her own script had borrowed from\r\nit. She had also read parts of Vol. XXII. of the\r\nProceedings, and may have seen the passage I have\r\njust quoted. From the evidential point of view we\r\nmust assume that she had seen it, and that she may\r\nthus have become aware of a connection between Browning's Philemon and the tyrant Dionysius. On the\r\nother hand, it would not be legitimate to infer that\r\nthis literary contribution to the subject in hand must\r\n204 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nhave proceeded from her own mental activities un- prompted by any external influence. Whatever view we\r\ntake of the genuineness or otherwise of the supposed\r\ncommunicators and communications, it is clear that\r\nwhat is already in the mind, conscious or subconscious,\r\nof the automatist, will also be that which will most\r\neasily emerge in automatic speech or writing.\r\nIn any case the reference to Browning's poem is aptly chosen. Not only does it bring in Dionysius\r\nthe Tyrant in the manner described, but also, though\r\nindirectly, the two other mam topics alluded to in\r\nthe script, namely, the Athenian expedition against\r\nSyracuse, and the stone-quarries where the Athenian\r\nprisoners worked until they were sold as slaves or re- leased because they were able to recite Euripides. The\r\nsecond \" Adventure \" of Balaustion inevitably recalls\r\nthe first, related in the companion poem ; and the first adventure starts from the defeat of the Athenian Expedition, and ends with Balaustion seeking safety for\r\nherself and her whole ship's company from the threatened\r\nhostility of the Syracusans by the exercise of a similar\r\ngift of recitation.\r\nOne other point is perhaps worthy of mention. Browning's line 1 \" I'd hang myself\u2014to see Euripides \"\r\nis misquoted by Mrs. Holland, and after her by Mrs.\r\nWillett in the form \"To fly to find Euripides.\" I owe\r\nto Mrs. Verrall the suggestion that the remark in the\r\nWillett Script, about \" this sort of thing \" being \" more\r\ndifficult to do than it looked,\" is due to a recognition\r\nby the communicator of the misquotation\u2014a misquotation which in his life-time Dr. Verrall, \" who was much\r\ninterested in Mrs. Holland's allusion to Lucus and\r\nPhilemon, never failed to note and regret.\"\r\nSo far all is plain sailing. The reproduction of what\r\nDr. Verrall said to Mrs. Verrall anent the Ear of\r\nDionysius it is possible to explain in the manner I have\r\n1 This line is an almost literal translation from a fragment of Philemon\r\nwhich has come down to us.\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 205\r\nsuggested. The other allusions, historical, geographical\r\nand literary, have a natural connection ; and all of\r\nthem might be supposed, without any rude violation\r\nof probability, to have been at one time or another\r\nwithin the normal knowledge of the automatist. But\r\nup to now we have only been laying foundations for\r\nwhat is to follow. In the succeeding scripts the plot\r\nbegins to thicken.\r\nBefore I enter upon these further developments it will not be out of place to make a brief statement\r\nconcerning the conditions in which the Willett Scripts are produced. Many of these are written when the\r\nautomatist is alone, awake, and fully aware of her\r\nsurroundings. The remainder, produced in the presence\r\nof a \" sitter,\" 1 fall mainly into two classes. Either\r\nthe automatist is in a normal or nearly normal state\r\nof consciousness, much as when she writes scripts by\r\nherself, or else she is in a condition of trance. There\r\nhave been a few intermediate cases, when it is hard to\r\nsay whether the sensitive is in trance or not. But these\r\nare a very small number : in general there is no diffi- culty whatever in distinguishing. Scripts obtained in a normal state of consciousness, whether in presence\r\nof a sitter or alone, are always annotated by Mrs.\r\nWillett shortly after they have been produced. The\r\noriginals are carefully preserved in the custody of the\r\ninvestigating group ; but she keeps copies to which\r\nshe can at any time refer. Of scripts produced in\r\ntrance, on the other hand, she remembers nothing, even immediately after waking ; and the contents are\r\ncarefully kept from her knowledge. The script of Aug.\r\n26, 1910, in which the first reference to the Ear of\r\nDionysius occurred, was a trance-script. That of Jan.\r\n10, 1914, from which Extract A has been taken, was\r\nwritten in normal conditions of consciousness. All the\r\n1 A few of Mrs. Willett 's scripts have been produced in the presence\r\nof some member of her family, and two in the presence of a friend\r\nwho does not belong to the investigating group. Apart from these\r\nrare occasions, she has never sat for automatic writing save with Mrs.\r\nVerrall, Sir Oliver Lodge, or myself ; and never at any time in the\r\npresence of more than one person.\r\n206 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nremaining scripts I shall have occasion to quote in\r\nthis Paper were trance-scripts. Until May of this year\r\n(1916), Mrs. Willett had never been shown any of them\r\nor any portion of anj' of them : there is no doubt\r\nin my own mind that in a normal state of consciousness she was totally ignorant of their contents.\r\nIn that month I allowed her to see, not the entire\r\nscripts, but just those passages which I am about to\r\ncite, and which have been printed for distribution among\r\nthe audience. The date of the last of these scripts\r\nwas August 19, 1915. It is clear, therefore, that Mrs.\r\nWillett 's having been shown the extracts nine months\r\nlater could in no way weaken any \" evidential \" value\r\nwhich the episode they relate to may be thought to\r\npossess.\r\nI now proceed to read and comment on Extract B\r\nfrom the Willett sitting of Feb. 28, 1914, at which I\r\nwas myself present.\r\nSome confusion may appear in the matter transmitted but\r\nthere is now being started an experiment not a new experiment but a new subject and not exactly that but a new\r\nline which joins with a subject already got through\r\na little anatomy if you please\r\nAdd one to one One Ear x [sic] one eye\r\nB.\r\n(Extracts from Sitting oj Feh. 28, 1914.)\r\n(Present: G.

It is intended to be characteristic\r\nof them, and to serve as evidence of their personal\r\nsurvival.\r\nThe identity of the two friends, indicated without\r\ndisguise in the later extracts, is made sufficiently clear\r\neven in the present one to anybody acquainted with\r\nprevious Willett Scripts. They are Professor S. H. Butcher\r\nand Dr. A. W. Verrall.1 The \" man with the glittering eyes I once saw,\"\r\n1 Professor Butcher died in December, 1910, and Dr. Verrall in June. 1912.\r\nLxxni.] The Ear of Dionysius. 211\r\nfrom whom proceeds the word Aristotle, is Professor\r\nButcher. The incident referred to is a vision of Professor Butcher seen by Mrs. Willett on the night\r\nof Jan. 21, 1911,. a few weeks after his death. I quote\r\nthe record of it made by Mrs. Willett on the day\r\nfollowing : \" Last night after I had blown out my candle and\r\nwas just going to sleep I became aware of the presence\r\nof a man, a stranger, and\u2014almost at the same moment \u2014knew it was Henry Butcher. I felt his personality\r\nvery living, clear, strong, sweetness and strength combined. A piercing glance. He made no introduction,\r\nand said nothing. So I said to him : ' Are you Henry\r\nButcher ?\r\n' He said ' No, I am Henry Butcher's ghost.'\r\nI was rather shocked at his saying this, and said, ' Oh,\r\nvery well, I'm not at all afraid of ghosts or of the\r\ndead.' He said, ' Ask Verrall if he remembers our\r\nlast conversation, and say the word to him : Ek e tee.' \"\r\nA more detailed reference to this vision will be found\r\nin Extract D. I do not discuss it here further than\r\nto say that the name of the goddess Hecate\u2014for that\r\nis apparently what is meant\r\n\r\nhas a significance in con- nection with Dr. Verrall which would have been known\r\nto Professor Butcher. In the present context the incident is apparently recalled only to serve as a clue\r\nto the identity of the man who says ' Aristotle.' The\r\nword ' Aristotle,' combined with ' Poetry,' is itself an\r\nadditional clue ; for Butcher wrote a work upon Aristotle's\r\nPoetics which is well known to all classical scholars.\r\nHence the description of him as \" my Aristotelian friend \"\r\ngiven later on in the extract.\r\nTwo other symbolic references to Prof. Butcher are contained in Extract B. \" Father Cam walking arm\r\nin arm with the Canongate \" signifies the association,\r\nin the persons of Verrall and Butcher, of the Universities\r\nof Cambridge and Edinburgh. Butcher was himself a\r\nhighly distinguished Cambridge man, and in later life represented his University in the House of Commons ;\r\n212 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nbut he was also for many years Professor of Greek afc Edinburgh.\r\nThe Rose, and the -perfume of the Rose are repeatedly\r\nused in Willett Scripts as symbols of Prof. Butcher,\r\nfor a reason which his personal friends will readily\r\nunderstand. We shall come across the same symbols\r\nagain in Extract D. Note that here the automatisfc\r\nseems to become conscious of the scent before she con- nects it with the -floiver. \" No rosebuds yet by dew\r\nimpearled \" is a quotation from Swinburne's Etude\r\nRealiste, with the substitution of \" dew \" for \" dawn.\"\r\nMrs. Willett, it may be as well to say, had never met Professor Butcher. She knew him, however, by\r\nname, and knew that he was a close friend of the\r\nVerralls.\r\nAs regards Dr. Verrall, there is only one direct allusion\r\nto him in Extract B apart from the Father Cam refer- ence already mentioned ; but that one is unmistakable.\r\nThe automatist says she seems to be walking about\r\na school and to meet a dark boy. She tries to get\r\nthe name of a German Field Marshal. \" Then something\r\nsays, All this is only memories revived ; it has nothing\r\nto do with the purely literary thing \" in which the\r\ntwo friends are closely concerned.\r\nThe school is Wellington ; the dark boy is Verrall ; the memories revived are his memories. The German\r\nField Marshal is Bliicher, whose name was given to\r\none of the college dormitories. Mrs. Willett probably\r\nknew that Verrall was educated at Wellington ; and\r\nshe certainly had had the opportunity of knowing that\r\none of the College dormitories was named after Bliicher, as this circumstance was mentioned in the notes to a\r\nscript of Mrs. Verrall's which she had seen. The passage\r\ngives no ground for inferring a knowledge supernormally\r\nimparted, though it effectively serves its purpose of\r\ndesignating a particular individual.\r\nTo resume : We have now learnt that the subjects\r\nassociated together in Extract A and reproduced in\r\nExtract B are intended to find their place in some\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 213\r\nkind of literary scheme carefully thought out and devised\r\nby two friends who in their lifetime were eminent classical\r\nscholars. They are, as it were, pieces which have to\r\nbe fitted into a single whole more or less after the manner\r\nof a jig-saw puzzle. The tale of pieces, however, is not yet complete. Two additional subjects of great\r\nimportance lie embedded in Extract B, and my next\r\ntask must be to disengage them. They are the stories\r\nof Polyphemus and Ulysses, and of Acis and Galatea\u2014\r\nthe first derived from Homer's Odyssey, the second from\r\nOvid's Metamorphoses 1 though best known to most people\r\nthrough the famous musical setting of the tale by Handel.\r\nIn the story told by Homer, Ulysses is overtaken by\r\na storm on his voyage home from Troy, and driven\r\nto the country of the Lotus Eaters. He reaches next\r\nthe land of the Cyclopes,2 a race of one-eyed giants\r\nto whom the laws of hospitality are unknown. Going\r\nashore with twelve of his companions he enters the cave where dwells one of the giants, by name Polyphemus, a son of the sea-god Poseidon. Polyphemus\r\nis away tending his flocks and herds, but returns towards\r\nevening, and, discovering the strangers, imprisons them\r\nin his cave, and proceeds to devour them two at a time\r\nin three successive meals. But Ulysses and his six\r\nremaining companions have devised a terrible revenge.\r\nThey prepare a stake of olive wood with its end sharpened to a point ; and having made the Cyclops dead\r\ndrunk with wine they had brought from the ship, plunge\r\nthe end of the stake into the embers, and bore out\r\nthe monster's single eye with its glowing point. Next\r\nmorning when the blinded giant rolls away the stone\r\nfrom the mouth of the cave to let his flock pass out\r\nhimself remaining in the doorway to catch his tormentors,\r\nUlysses and his companions escape from his clutches\r\nconcealed beneath the bellies of the sheep and clinging\r\nto their fleeces.\r\n1 Book xiii. 738 ff.\r\n- Ancient tradition placed the Cyclopes in Sicily. Homer himself is silent on the point. o\r\n214 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nThe allusions to this story are scattered in a fine\r\nconfusion through the script ; but once we have the\r\nkey in our hand there is no difficulty in detecting\r\nthem. The one eye, the \"12 little nigger hoys thinking not of Styx, Some were eaten up and then there\r\nwere six,\" the reference to Homer, to a cave and a group of men, to Poseidon with his trident, to the flaming torch, to Noah and the grapes\u2014all fall into place once we realize that they belong to the story of Ulysses\r\nand Polyphemus.\r\nThe allusion to the meeting of Ulysses in the\r\nUnderworld with \" the great Achilles whom we knew\r\n\r\nseems at first sight irrelevant. I suspect it is only\r\na roundabout way of suggesting Ulysses himself. The\r\nactual names of the two principal characters in the\r\nstory are never mentioned ; and the same remark applies\r\nto the story of Acis and Galatea. In this tale, as\r\nin the other, the one-eyed Cyclops plays the part of\r\nvillain of the piece. Acis, a shepherd dwelling at the\r\nfoot of Mount Etna, and Galatea the sea nymph, are\r\nlovers. Unfortunately for them, Galatea is also beloved\r\nof the \" monster Polypheme,\" as Handel's libretto calls\r\nhim. Rejected by the nymph, and mad with jealousy,\r\nhe hurls a mighty rock at his rival and crushes him\r\nto death. Galatea cannot save her lover, but she gives\r\nhim a kind of immortality by changing him into the\r\nstream which bears his name and has its source in a fountain issuing from the rock beneath which he\r\nwas overwhelmed\r\n.\r\nTwo passages in Extract B refer to this story. The\r\nfirst speaks of \"a Fountain on the hill side,\" followed\r\nby a rough drawing intended for a volcano. The second\r\noccurs towards the end of the Extract : \" He was turned\r\ninto a fountam that sort of Stephen man, he was turned\r\ninto a fountain. Why ? that's the point : Why ? \"\r\n\" That sort of Stephen man \" describes, of course, the manner in which Acis came by his death. To the question\r\nWhy ? an answer is given in Extract C. There is a\r\npoint in it, but a point which only becomes intelligible\r\nwhen the whole of the riddle has been read.\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 215\r\nUp to this stage the riddle remains a riddle still. At\r\nall events, it did so for me. We are told to join the one ear to the one eye ; but I doubt if any one in\r\nthis room can say how the Ear of Dionysius and the\r\nstone quarries of Syracuse are connected with the stories\r\nof Polyphemus and Ulysses and of Acis and Galatea\r\nexcept by the geographical accident of then all belonging to Sicily. Such a mere geographical unity would\r\nhardly justify the communicators in describing their\r\nscheme as \" something good and worth doing \" which\r\nit had taken the united industry of two distinguished\r\nscholars to think out.\r\nLet us see what assistance we can get from the next\r\nscript\r\n.\r\nThe Aristotelian to the Hegelian friend greeting.

G.\r\n^ After what has already been said there is comparatively little in this extract that requires further explanation. Nevertheless some important additions are made\r\nin it to the stock of materials at our disposal.\r\nFirst, an answer has been given to the emphatic\r\nquestion asked in the previous script concerning the cause which led to Acis having been changed into a\r\nfountain. The cause was Jealousy\u2014a lover's jealousy,\r\nlike that which sent Uriah to perish in the forefront\r\nof battle. Jealousy, then, is one of the pieces which\r\nhave to be fitted into the finished picture of our jigsaw puzzle.\r\nNext, mention is made for the first time of a Zither\r\n\u2014the sound of which instrument, we are told, \" belongs \" \u2014also of Mousike, the Greek word for the Art of Music.\r\nFurther, the references to Aristotle seem to carry with\r\nthem a significance beyond what they possessed in the\r\nprevious script. There they appeared to serve merely\r\nas a symbol of S. H. Butcher. Here they are apparently introduced on their own account as well. \"The\r\nStagirite \" is a correct description of Aristotle, who\r\nwas born at Stageira, a sea-port in Macedonia. It\r\nwould seem, however, an odd title to use in this place\r\nunless with the deliberate purpose of inviting attention.\r\nAgain, a few sentences later it is explicitly stated that a reference is wanted not to what Butcher wrote about\r\nAristotle, but to something which Aristotle himself\r\nwrote ; and we are left to infer from the words Ars\r\nPoetica which follow that this something is to be found\r\nin Aristotle's Treatise on Poetry.\r\n'From Dekker's Patient Grissel : \"To add to golden numbers golden numbers.\" There seems to be no special point in the quotation here.\r\n218 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nLastly, a rather quaint transition leads up to yet\r\nanother new subject. The Latin words Ars Poetica\r\nto a classical scholar suggest Horace more readily than\r\nAristotle. Horace is not actually named ; but the\r\nthought of him is clearly implied in the interpolated\r\nremark attributed to Edmund Gurney, \" Juvenal also\r\nwrote Satires.\" \"Juvenal also'' must mean \"Juvenal\r\nas well as Horace.\" Aristotle, J need hardly say. did\r\nnot write satires.\r\nWe have here, I think, one of those subtle touches\r\nnot uncommon in Mrs. Willett's automatic productions,\r\nand making strongly for their genuineness. The idea\r\nwhich the communicator wants to \" get through \" is that of Satire. The name of Juvenal, the Satirist\r\npar excellence\u2014a name which has previously occurred\r\nin Willett Script\u2014serves as a stepping-stone, by means\r\nof an association familiar to any educated person. On\r\nthe other hand, the train of association which leads from\r\nAristotle's Poetics to Juvenal, using Horace as an unexpressed middle term, seems to me altogether foreign\r\nto Mrs. Willett, and outside the scope of any knowledge\r\nwith which she can reasonably be credited.\r\nAt the risk of over-refining I venture further to suggest\r\nthat the transition to Juvenal was an impromptu one\r\nfor the communicator himself. It occurs to him on the\r\nspur of the moment as a \"happy thought\"; and it\r\nis this as well as its success in eliciting the required\r\nidea of satire that makes him laughingly describe it as a \"good shot.\"\r\nThe notion of satire is continued in the words\r\nthat immediately follow : \" The pen is mightier than\r\nthe sword. . . . stones belong and so does a pen.\"\r\nAs they stand these words are rather obscure ; but\r\nthe sequel shows that the \" stones \" are the stones\r\nof the quarry-prisons, and the pen is the pen of a\r\nsatirist.\r\nLet me now recapitulate. The scripts have furnished\r\nus with a number of disjointed topics : the problem\r\nis to combine them into a literary unity.\r\nlxxiji.] The Ear of Dionysius. 219\r\nHere is List of the leading topics so far given : The Ear of Dionysius.\r\nThe stone-quarries of Syracuse in which prisoners\r\nwere confined.\r\nThe story of Polyphemus and Ulysses.\r\nThe story of Acis and Galatea.\r\nJealousy.\r\nMusic and the sound of a musical instrument.\r\nSomething to be found in Aristotle's Poetics.\r\nSatire.\r\nI have already compared these topics to the separate\r\npieces in a jig-saw puzzle. They might perhaps be\r\nstill more aptly likened to the letters in a letter-game.\r\nEach letter has a significance of its own ; their joint\r\nsignificance is only realised when the word they together\r\nspell has been discovered. The whole is more than the\r\nsum of its parts.\r\nNow obviously, if one or more of the parts are missing the difficulty of divining the whole is progressively\r\nincreased. Extract C, you will notice, ends with an\r\nintimation that more is to come, and repeats the injunction, already given as respects Mrs. Verrall, but now\r\nmade general, that the portions as they come are not\r\nto be shewn to any other automatist until the effort\r\nis completed. Mr. Piddmgton and I, who were studying the scripts, were accordingly content to wait without\r\ntroubling our heads overmuch about an answer to the\r\nconundrum, until more light should be vouchsafed,\r\neither by further scripts from Mrs. Willett, or by means\r\nof cross-correspondences elsewhere.\r\nEor a long time we waited in vain. There is, indeed, reason to think that some attempts were made to produce a cross-correspondence in the script of one of our\r\nautomatists, whom we call Mrs. King\u2014especially by\r\nmeans of references to the story of Acis and Galatea.1 Otherwise the whole subject seemed to be unaccountably\r\ndropped ; and it was not until nearly a year and a half\r\nlater, in August, 1915, that a return to it was made.\r\n1 See Appendix to this Paper.\r\n220 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nThe \" sitter \" on this occasion was Mrs. Verrall, who,\r\nit must be remembered, had not been allowed to see either of the scripts from which Extracts B and C have\r\nbeen taken.\r\nThe relevant passages in this new script are contained\r\nin Extract D.\r\nD.\r\n(Extract from Script of Aug. 2, 1915.)\r\n(Present : Mrs. Verrall.)\r\nSomeone speaks a tall broad figure with a dark beard &\r\neyes that emit light with him stands the man who said\r\nI am Henry Butcher's ghost do you remember % Ecate\r\n(Mrs. V.

It would seem to be a word\u2014perhaps a Greek word\u2014which the communicator has been unable to get the\r\nautomatist to write. I suspect an allusion to a passage in the Plutus of Aristophanes (1. 290), which parodies the Cyclops of Philoxenus, and per- haps actually quotes from the poem. In this passage the made-up word\r\n8peTTai>e\\6 (threttanelo) is used to imitate the sound of the cithara. The mysterious figure, or letter, which precedes \" thrumming \" in the\r\nscript may be the beginning of an attempt to write this word.\r\n222 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour.

(Mrs. V. Yes.)\r\nIn this Extract, again, there is little with which we\r\nare not already familiar. But that little contains the\r\nkey to the puzzle. \" Cythera \" : \" Cyclopean, Philox, He laboured in the\r\nstone quarries and drew upon the earlier writer for\r\nmaterial for his Satire, Jealousy : \" \u2014in these words I will\r\nnot say that he who runs may read the riddle, but\r\nhe will certainly have a fair inkling of it if he first takes the trouble to read up the account given of a\r\n1 \" You have to put Homer with another.\" Who is this \" other \" ? Perhaps Philoxenus himself is meant, though this interpretation does\r\nnot consist very well with the statement which immediately follows,\r\nthat what resulted was \" the pen dipped in vitriol.\" The more natural\r\nmeaning would seem to be that the \" other \" who is to be put with\r\nHomer is a second writer from whom Philoxenus had borrowed in constructing the plot of his Cyclops. Can the intention have been\r\nto refer to the unknown Greek original from which Ovid derived the\r\nstory of Acis and Galatea ? Ovid is our earliest extant authority for\r\nthis story ; but there can be little doubt that he took it from a Greek\r\nliterary source, though we do not know what that source was. \" The\r\nearlier writer \" from whom, according to the script, Philoxenus drew\r\nthe materials of his satire, might on this supposition be, not Homer,\r\nbut the Greek predecessor from whom Ovid borrowed.\r\n1 by no means dismiss this conjecture, which has come to me from a scholar of repute. It is a pity, indeed, that the evidence for it is not stronger. An allusion to the original source of the tale of Acis\r\nand Galatea, like the allusion suggested in a previous note to a passage\r\nfrom the Plutus of Aristophanes, would come naturally enough from\r\nVerrall, but could never have proceeded from the unaided resources\r\nof Mrs. Willett,\r\n2 Professor Butcher was familiarly known among his old friends by the\r\ntwo first initials of his name.\r\n3 See footnote on p. 230.\r\nLXXIII ] The Ear of Dionysius. 223\r\ncertain Philoxenus of Cythera in Smith's Dictionary of\r\nGreek and Roman Biography and Mythology, or in the\r\nEncyclopedia Britannica.\r\nThose of us who are not specialists in classical literature\r\nneed not blush to confess ignorance of the very name\r\nof Philoxenus. He was nevertheless a poet of considerable repute in antiquity., though only a few lines from\r\nhis works have actually come down to us. Philoxenus was a writer of dithyrambs, a species of\r\nirregular lyric poetry which combined music with verse,\r\nthe musical instrument most generally employed being\r\nthe Kithara or Zither, a kind of lyre. He was a native\r\nof Cythera, and at the height of his reputation spent\r\nsome time in Sicily at the Court of Dionysius the Tyrant\r\nof Syracuse. He ultimately quarrelled with his patron\r\nand was sent to prison in one of the stone-quarries.\r\nSo far the accounts that have come down to us agree ; but thejr differ as to the cause of the quarrel. Most\r\nwriters, according to the Dictionary of Greek and Roman\r\nBiography and Mythology, ascribe the oppressive action\r\nof Dionysius \" to the wounded vanity of the tyrant,\r\nwhose poems Philoxenus not only refused to praise,\r\nbut, on being asked to revise one of them, said the\r\nbest way of correcting it would be to draw a black\r\nline through the whole paper.\" This version of the\r\nquarrel is also followed by the writer in the Encyclopedia Britannica, and by Grote in his History of\r\nGreece.1 There was, however, another account, mentioned\r\nin the Dictionary of Biography and Mythology only to\r\nbe rejected, which ascribed the disgrace of the poet\r\n\" to too close an intimacy with the tyrant's mistress\r\nGalateia.\"\r\nI now come to the heart of the mystery which has\r\nhitherto baffled us. The most famous of the dithyrambic\r\npoems of Philoxenus was a piece entitled Cyclops or Galatea.\r\nOf this poem only two or three lines have been preserved ; and any attempt to reconstruct its plot must depend on\r\nother sources of information. The Encyclopedia Britannica\r\nsays of it : \" His masterpiece was the Cyclops, a pastoral\r\nl Yo\\. X. 303.\r\n224 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nburlesque on the love of the Cyclops for the fair Galatea,\r\nwritten to avenge himself upon Dionysius, who was\r\nwholly or partially blind of one eye.\" This falls in\r\nwell with the references in the scripts to Satire ; but\r\ndoes not provide much of a foundation for the references\r\nto the stories of Ulysses and Polyphemus and of Acis\r\nand Galatea, and to the topic of jealousy. The Dictionary of Biography and Mythology helps even less. Moreover, it states that the poem was composed in the\r\npoet's native island ; whereas the script affirms that\r\nit was written in the stone-quarries.\r\nI have searched through various other English authorities and books of reference as well as a few foreign\r\nones, in order to discover, if possible, whether there was\r\nany single modern source from which the story told\r\nor implied in the scripts could be supposed to be derived.\r\nApart from works in German or Latin\u2014languages which\r\nMrs. Willett does not understand\u2014there are only two\r\nbooks, so far as I have been able to discover, which\r\ncan fairly be said to fulfil this condition. One of\r\nthese is Lempriere's Classical Dictionary. Lempriere's\r\naccount is as follows : \"A dithyrambic poet of Cythera,\r\nwho enjoyed the favour of Dionysius tyrant of Syracuse\r\nfor some time, till he offended him by seducing one\r\nof his female singers. During his confinement Philoxenus\r\ncomposed an allegorical poem, called Cyclops, in\r\nwhich he had delineated the character of the tyrant\r\nunder the name of Polyphemus, and represented his\r\nmistress under the name of Galatea, and himself under\r\nthat of Ulysses.\" The other is a work on the Greek\r\nMelic Poets by Dr. Herbert Weir Smyth, Professor of\r\nGreek at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, obviously\r\nintended for scholars, and not in the least likely to\r\nattract attention from the general public. The copy\r\nI have seen was a presentation copy sent by the publishers to the late Dr. Verrall, who thought well of the\r\nbook and used it (so Mrs. Verrall told me) as a textbook in connection with some of his lectures. \" Like Simonides,\" writes Professor Smyth, \" Philox- enus was a man of the world, a friend of princes,\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 225\r\nand many stories are told of his nimble wit at the\r\nSyracusan Court. His friendship with Dionysios the\r\nElder was finally broken either by his frank criticism\r\nof the tragedies of the tyrant or in consequence of\r\nhis passion for Galateia, a beautiful flute-player, who\r\nwas the mistress of Dionysios. Released from prison\r\nby the prince to pass judgment on his verse, the poet\r\nexclaimed : airaye fxe els Xaro\/mlas [take me back to the\r\nquarries]. In his confinement he revenged himself by composing his famous dithyramb entitled either Kyldops or\r\nGalateia, in which the poet represented himself as Odysseus, who, to take vengeance on Polyphemus (Dionysios),\r\nestranged the affections of the nymph Galateia, of whom\r\nthe Kyklops was enamoured.\"\r\nHere evidently is the literary unity of which we were in\r\nsearch and which was to collect the scattered parts of the\r\npuzzle devised by the two friends on the other side into a\r\nsingle whole. It is to be found in the version just given of\r\nthe plot of the Cyclops of Philoxenus. Dionysius and his \" Ear,\" the stone- quarries of Syracuse, Ulysses and Polyphemus, Acis and Galatea, Jealousy, and Satire\u2014all these\r\ntopics fall naturally and easily into place in relation\r\nto this account of the poem.1 Music and the thrumming\r\nof a musical instrument can be fitted in without much\r\ndifficulty, as belonging to the characteristics of dithyrambic\r\npoetry. It only remains to trace the passage in Aristotle\r\nwhich \" comes in \" and which \" S. H. knows.\"\r\nThere are two passages occurring within a page of\r\neach other in the first and second chapters of Aristotle's\r\nPoetics, either of which might be the passage referred\r\nto. One of these is general, and classes the dithyramb\r\nwith those kinds of poetry which depend for their effects\r\nnot only upon rhythm and metre, but also upon melody.\r\nThe other distinguishes between the poetry which aims\r\nat representing men as worse, and that which aims\r\nat representing them as better, than they really are ;\r\n1 The ancient authority followed by both Lempriere and Prof. Smyth\r\nis AthenEeus, a late Greek writer, whose work may well have\r\nbeen known to Butcher or Verrall, but could not possibly be known\r\nto Mrs. Willett.\r\n226 The Right Hon.

He apparently forgets that in March, 1914,\r\nhe himself informed us that there was much more to\r\nbe got through, and that we had waited for a year\r\nand a half before any additional light was forthcoming.\r\nThe surprise shown in Extract D that no message concerning a Satire and the Ear of Dionysius and the\r\nCave of the Cyclops had been handed on to Mrs. Verrall\r\nshows an even more marked forgetfulness ; for we had\r\nbeen expressly warned to tell her nothing. Such forgetfulness is very rare in our experience. I doubt whether\r\na parallel instance could be found in the scripts of\r\nany of our group of automatists. I have no explanation to offer of it. Eoi' the rest, the extract I have just read is chiefly\r\ninteresting for its insistence upon the claim that the\r\nwhole scheme is characteristic of the two friends who\r\nhave devised it, and therefore points to the survival\r\nof their distinctive personalities.\r\nThat the case described in this Paper is an extremely\r\nremarkable one, few, I think, will be disposed to deny.\r\nMrs. Willett is in no sense a \" learned \" lady. She\r\nhas a taste for poetry, and a good knowledge of certain\r\nEnglish poets ; but with classical subjects she is as\r\nlittle familiar as the average of educated women. This\r\nI can affirm with confidence, and I have had good\r\nopportunity of judging.\r\nIn order to test her knowledge of the particular topics\r\nreferred to in this series of scripts I prepared six questions, writing them out on separate pieces of paper,\r\nand asked her to answer them then and there as each\r\nquestion was handed to her. This was on the 27th\r\nof May last when I was setting to work on the present\r\npaper. Questions and answers were as follows. (You\r\nwill of course bear in mind that all the scripts, except\r\nthat from which Extract A is taken, were obtained\r\nwhen the automatist was in trance, and that no memory\r\nof what she writes or speaks in trance is carried on\r\ninto her waking consciousness.)\r\n228 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nQu. 1. Please say what you know about tbe Ear of\r\nDionvsius ? Ans. I have heard this expression, but do not know\r\nwhat is the meaning of it. Qu. 2. (a) Did you know that Aristotle had written a Treatise on Poetry ? Ans. No.\r\n(&) Were you aware that S. H. Butcher had\r\nwritten a hook on the subject of this Treatise ? Ans. No.\r\nQu. 3. Does the name Cythera convey any meaning\r\nto you ? Ans. Yes, it conveys to me the Greek name of one\r\nof the winds\u2014I believe mentioned in In Memoriam.\r\nQu. 4. Do you know anything about the stoxy of\r\nAcis and Galatea ? Ans. Of Acis I know nothing ; of Galatea I loiow the\r\nstory cf the statue that comes to life. Qu. 5. Does the name Polyphemus convey any idea\r\nto you ? Ans. I seem to have heard the name, but it has no\r\nassociations for me.\r\nQu. 6. Does the name Philoxenus convey any idea\r\nto you ? Ans. None whatever.\r\nHaving obtained these answers I decided to show Mrs.\r\nWillett the extracts which I have read to you to-day,\r\nand explain to her the scheme and its denouement. This\r\ninvolved a departure from our usual practice of withholding from the automatist any written or spoken\r\nutterances produced by her in a state of trance. No\r\nharm, however, was likely to result in the present case,\r\nseeing that the experiment had evidently reached its conclusion and that no further amplifications from \" the\r\nother side \" were to be looked for. My object was to\r\nascertain whether perusal of the extracts would awaken\r\nany memories that had remained dormant when the\r\nautomatist was answering the questions put to her a few hours before. As a matter of fact, nothing of\r\nthe kind occurred. The nearest approach to a revival\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysvus. 229\r\nof memory was upon my mentioning Handel's Acis\r\nand Galatea. She then said that Handel and Acis\r\nand Galatea seemed to go together in her mind ; but\r\nshe was certain she had never either heard the music\r\nor read the story. On the other hand, her ignorance\r\nof matters referred to in the extracts went even beyond\r\nwhat her answers to the questions indicated ; for instance,\r\nshe could not recall ever having heard of the Expedition\r\nof the Athenians against Syracuse. Her surprise and\r\nalmost excitement were quite interesting to watch as the elements of the literary puzzle were gradually made\r\nclear and finally brought to a unity in the Satire of\r\nPhiloxenus. It was abundantly evident that both the\r\nelements themselves and the final solution were entirely\r\noutside any conscious knowledge she possessed.\r\nIn March, 1914, I read a Paper to the Society giving\r\nan account of an earlier case derived from Willett Scripts\r\nin which the principal agent purported to be Dr. Verrall.\r\nThis Paper was subsequently published in Volume XXVII.\r\nof the Proceedings under the title \" Some recent scripts\r\naffording evidence of personal survival.\" The facts of\r\nthe case, which I shall refer to as \" the Statius Case,\"\r\nwere briefly these : A passage was to be searched for\r\nwhich described a traveller looking across a river and\r\nwishing himself on the other side, but hesitating to\r\nbattle with the current. If it were possible to identify\r\nthe passage, \" the matter,\" so we were told, \" would\r\nprove interesting.\" No passage satisfactorily answering the required conditions could be found by those\r\nwho were studying the Willett Scripts, and the subject\r\nwas almost forgotten until the scripts suddenly returned to\r\nit more than a year later. Two new lights were then\r\nthrown upon the problem. In the first place, Dr. Verrall\r\nwas unmistakably designated as the propouuder of it ; in the second place, a sign-post was provided by the\r\nstatement \"Dante makes it clear.\" Guided by these\r\nindications we ultimately traced the required passage\r\nto an Essay by Dr. Verrall entitled \" Dante on the\r\nBaptism of Statius,\" which it was practically certain\r\nthat Mrs. Willett had never seen. Thus the promise,\r\np\r\n230 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nthat if the passage could be identified the matter would\r\nprove interesting, was amply fulfilled, and a valuable\r\naddition made to the evidences hitherto furnished by\r\nautomatic writings in favour of personal survival.1 Between the Statius Case and that described in the\r\n1 It is only fair to say that criticisms of my Paper on the Statius\r\nCase have appeared in the Proceedings (Vol. XXVII. , pp. 458-574),\r\nattacking my interpretation of the scripts on the double ground that\r\nI had shown no sufficient reason for connecting Dr. Verrall with the\r\ncase at all, nor for selecting the River of Baptism which Statius\r\nhesitated to cross as the particular river referred to, when the River\r\nof Death in the Pilgrim's Progress, or the Rubicon, or any other\r\nriver on the brink of which anyone had ever paused might have\r\nserved the purpose equally well. As regards the connection of Dr. Verrall with the case, this was\r\nto my mind clearly given by the reference to the communicator who-\r\n\" Swears he will not here exercise any patience whatever, not even about Lavender and Lub,\" and by the plain allusions (as it seemed\r\nto me) to Dr. Verrall's recently delivered Lectures on Dryden. That\r\nthe scripts meant to indicate Dr. Verrall as the communicator it did\r\nnot occur to me that anyone would question, else I would have\r\nlaboured the point more. Of course it does not follow that he actually was the communicator ; and though I fancy my critics have\r\nconfused the one thing with the other, I am sure no such confusion can be found in my Paper.\r\nAs if to remove any possible uncertainty as to who was meant,\r\nthe phrase \" He of the little patience,\" which had already been employed to describe the communicator in the earlier scripts, is again\r\nrepeated in the Dionysius Case (see Extract D \" he of the impatience \"),\r\nand this time beyond all cavil as a synonym for Dr. Verrall. The identification of the passage describing the timid traveller is, I admit, more conjectural. I have, however, little or no doubt that\r\nit is right. It explains (1) the special interest attached to the dis- covery of the passage ; (2) the statement that \" Dante makes it clear \" ; and (3) the paraphrase of the lines in the Purgatorio which\r\nDante puts into the mouth of Statius and which Dr. Verrall's Essay\r\nquotes. The rivers suggested by my critics do none of these things.\r\nIt also gives a point and significance to the whole incident, which\r\nwould otherwise be wanting, by making it into a problem with a\r\nsolution. Additional corroboration is, I think, furnished by the\r\ncircumstance that another problem with a solution, similar though\r\nmuch more complicated, follows so soon afterwards. The Dionysius\r\nCase throws light on the Statius Case that preceded it. In this con- nection it may be of interest to note that the scripts had already\r\nbegun on the former before my Paper on the latter had been published, and therefore before anything had been done which could put\r\nMrs. Willctt on the track of our interpretation.\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 231\r\npresent Paper, which I may call the Dionysius Case,\r\nthere is obviously a strong family likeness. The method\r\nemployed, the object proposed, and the chief professed agent\r\nare the same in both.\r\nThe method is to propound a literary problem the\r\nconstruction and solution of which are outside the range\r\nof the automatisms normal knowledge. The solution is at\r\nfirst kept purposely obscure, and it is left to the industry\r\nof the interpreters of the script to discover it. When\r\nthey have failed to do so after ample time given additional\r\nindications are doled out in successive scripts until at\r\nlast the riddle is read.\r\nThe chief ostensible agent in each case is Dr. Verrall,\r\nthough in the Dionysius case he is associated with\r\nS. H. Butcher.\r\nThe object in each case is to furnish ground for believing that the ostensible agent or agents are also\r\nthe real ones, continuing to exist as individuals after\r\nbodily death.\r\nHow far has this object been achieved in the case now before us ? There are two ways in which this question may be\r\napproached. The hypothesis that the ostensible are also\r\nthe actual communicators is one of several possible\r\nalternative explanations. If we can test these alternatives\r\nin relation to the facts of the case, and find ourselves\r\ncompelled to reject all but one, that one must be\r\nregarded as holding the field. This negative method\r\nof procedure is to my mind likely to prove the most\r\nfruitful ; but we shall also have to consider how far\r\nthe facts afford positive grounds for accepting the identity\r\nclaimed in the scripts.\r\nIn my Paper on the Statius Case I analysed with\r\nsome care the various alternative explanations which\r\nappear, I will not say probable, but at all events j)ossible.\r\nWhat I have said there applies mutatis mutandis here\r\nalso ; and therefore I may be the more brief on the\r\npresent occasion.\r\nIn all such cases four main questions have to be asked.\r\n232 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [PART\r\nThe first two relate to the knowledge exhibited in the\r\nscripts :\r\n(1) . Did this knowledge reach the automatist normally ?\r\n(2) . If not normally, is there anybody living from whose\r\nmind it can be plausibly supposed to have been supplied ? The third and fourth questions relate to the use made of the knowledge, however acquired\u2014in other words,\r\nto the design exhibited in the scripts. Design implies a planning or constructing intelligence. Accordingly :\r\n(3) . Can the planning intelligence responsible for the\r\ndesign\u2014in the Dionysius Case the extremely elaborate\r\ndesign\u2014which the scripts reveal be plausibly supposed\r\nto have been that of the automatist herself whether\r\nconscious or subconscious ?\r\n(4) . Can it plausibly be supposed to have been the mind\r\nof some living person actively impressing its thoughts\r\nupon the mind of the automatist ? In the Dionysius Case, if we are willing to follow where\r\nthe evidence actually before us leads, instead of attaching\r\nourselves immoveably to preconceived ideas of what is possible or impossible, our answer to all these questions\r\nmust, I think, be in the negative.\r\n(1). The evidence goes to show that knowledge concerning Philoxenus of Cythera, his relations with Dionysius,\r\nand his poem Cyclops or Galatea, was not normally acquired\r\nby the automatist.\r\nOn this point we have first of all her own declaration\r\nof complete ignorance. Mrs. Willett is a lady of good\r\nsocial position, personally well known to all the members\r\nof the investigating group, every one of whom has the\r\nmost absolute confidence in her integrity and bona fides.\r\n8he is herself keenly alive to the importance of noting\r\nand recording anything that can help to throw light upon\r\nthe contents of her scripts and the possible sources which\r\nmay have been drawn upon in their production. In this\r\nrespect she has, on many occasions, been of material\r\nassistance to the investigators. When Mrs. Willett says\r\nshe is totally ignorant of a particular topic, no one\r\nwho knows her as we do would for a moment question\r\nher word.\r\nLXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 233\r\nNo doubt it is possible for knowledge once possessed\r\nto be forgotten, and yet to persist as a dormant memory\r\nin the subconscious mind. But this possibility must\r\nnot be pressed too far. It is pressing it very far indeed\r\nto suppose that at some time or other Mrs. Willett\r\neither read or heard the story of Philoxenus, that she\r\nthen forgot it completely so far as her normal conscious- ness was concerned, but was nevertheless able subconsciously to retain and use it in the concoction of an\r\nelaborate puzzle such as we are now considering.\r\nNor is this all. It is not merely of Philoxenus and\r\nhis poem that Mrs. Willett declares herself ignorant, but\r\nalso of other main elements in the puzzle, the story\r\nof Ulysses and Polyphemus for instance, and that of\r\nAcis and Galatea, to say nothing of the \" passage from\r\nAristotle.\" The intelligence that constructed the puzzle\r\nwas certainly aware of the details of these stories, and\r\nalso knew that the adventure of the Cyclops' Cave immediately follows the tale of the Lotus Eaters in the Homeric\r\nnarrative. It is not easy to believe that the various\r\nthreads so cunningly woven together all belong to the\r\ncategory of latent memories which the subconscious\r\nself can utilize for its own purposes while the normal\r\nself remains blissfully unconscious of them.\r\nAgain : Let us suppose for argument's sake that the\r\nknowledge of the story of Philoxenus exhibited in the\r\nscripts was normally acquired. From what source was it in that case derived ? It might be conjectured that Mrs.\r\nWillett, having in one way or another had her attention\r\ncalled to the name of Philoxenus, proceeded to study\r\na variety of authorities, and from their different accounts\r\npieced together the story as it appears in the scripts.\r\nI am not suggesting that such a conjecture has any\r\nplausibility. Mrs. Willett's knowledge of things classical\r\nis small, and her interest in them but slight. That she\r\nshould have undertaken the labour involved in this\r\nresearch is very unlikely. But that, having undertaken\r\nit, the whole subject should then pass out of her conscious\r\nmemory is, to me at least, incredible.\r\nThe alternative (and less improbable) conjecture is\r\n234 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nthat she took the story bodily either from Lempriere's\r\nClassical Dictionary or from Professor Smyth's Greek\r\nMelic Poets, and then forgot that she had ever known it. 1 As regards the Greelc Melic Poets, I think it on general\r\ngrounds very unlikely that she ever had the volume\r\nin her hands, much more that she read any page of it with care. The book itself is, as I have already indicated, of an extremely technical character. Merely to open\r\nit at random would repel anybody but an expert. One\r\nwould certainly be surprised to come across it anywhere\r\noutside a scholar's library. It is true that Mrs. Willett\r\nhas once or twice stayed for a short visit with Mrs.\r\nVerrall at Cambridge, and may conceivably have seen\r\nthe book on one of these occasions. But as its place\r\nwas on one of the many shelves in Dr. Verrall's study,\r\na room rarely entered by visitors unless they were taken\r\nthere specially, the chances of such a thing having\r\nhappened seem to me very remote. Lempriere's Classical\r\nDictionary is no doubt a more accessible work. On the\r\nother hand, it is decidedly more difficult to suppose it the sole or main source of the puzzle as a whole. Even\r\nProfessor Smyth's account of Philoxenus by no means\r\ncovers all the elements employed in the puzzle. It\r\ndoes no more than allude to the story of Ulysses and\r\nPolyphemus, it refers to the stone-quarries only by their\r\nGreek name which Mrs. Willett would not have understood, and it makes no mention whatever of Acis and\r\nGalatea. Lempriere's Dictionary not only makes no\r\nmention of Acis and Galatea, but is silent also upon the\r\nvery important topics of Aristotle and of mnsic. The\r\n1 On this point Mrs. Willett writes to me as follows : \" Lempriere's\r\nClassical Dictionary is quite unknown to me. I am as certain as I am of anything that I never saw or heard of Prof. Smyth's book. I have never taken a single volume from the shelves of Dr. Verrall's study. To the best of my belief, I have never been in that room\r\nalone. During Dr. Verrall's life it was not entered by visitors staying in the house unless they were taken to see him. After his death I stayed, I believe, only once with Mrs. Verrall, and I have\r\nsat in the room with her, but I believe I never was in the room alone\r\nat any time.\" This confirms a similar statement made to me verbally\r\nby Mrs. Verrall herself.\r\nLXXIII ] The Ear of Dionysius. 235\r\nold difficulty is thus still with us. All the topics asso- ciated in the scripts must be assumed, on the supposition\r\nthat the knowledge shown therein was normally acquired,\r\nto have been at one time or another consciously known\r\nto the automatist. There is no single source from which\r\nthey could all be derived. Of nearly every one of them\r\nshe now professes total ignorance. Can she have really\r\nforgotten them so completely that no memory of them\r\nis recalled even when the scripts are shown to her and\r\nthe whole scheme explained ? To my mind this is most difficult to believe. But, if we insist upon regarding\r\nthe knowledge shown in the scripts to have been normally\r\nacquired, then we must either believe this or believe\r\nthat Mrs. Willett's statements are deliberately false.\r\nDeliberately false I am sure they are not.\r\n(2). There is no living person from whose mind the\r\nmore essential materials utilized in the construction of the\r\npuzzle can plausibly be supposed to have been supplied.\r\nThe members of the group who were engaged in studying\r\nthe Willett scripts were six in number, namely, Sir Oliver\r\nLodge, Mr. Piddington, Mrs. Sidgwick, Miss Johnson,\r\nMrs. Verrall and myself. No one outside the group\r\nhad seen the scripts. Mrs. Verrall herself had not seen the scripts from which Extracts B and C are taken\r\nuntil after the script containing Extract D had been\r\nwritten. None of us\u2014and in this statement I expressly\r\ninclude Mrs. Verrall\u2014knew anything about Philoxenus\r\nor his poem until the mention of \" Philox \" in the script\r\nof Aug. 2, 1915, led Mrs. Verrall to look up the name\r\nin the Dictionary of Biography and Mythology. The automatists who were collaborating with us were equally\r\nignorant. The number even of professed classical scholars\r\nable to supply the required knowledge without consulting\r\nbooks of reference is, I venture to think, an extremely\r\nlimited one. Perhaps it will be urged that, limited as the number\r\nmay be, there are assuredly some few individuals in\r\npossession of the necessary information. May it not have\r\npassed telepathically from one or more of these to the\r\nautomatist ?\r\n236 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nThis supposition appears to me to be one of those\r\nwhich it is impossible to disprove, but which have practically nothing to support them.\r\nHow are we to conceive of the process taking place ? Are we to imagine Mrs. Willett's mind, conscious or subconscious, reaching out at large to an unknown x\r\n(or to unknown x, y, and ~), and gathering in knowledge\r\nof the various subjects out of which the puzzle is woven ? That seems a somewhat fantastic notion ; and moreover\r\nit implies at least a nucleus of knowledge, if not some\r\ngeneral conception of the puzzle itself, round which the\r\nrest of the otherwise miscellaneous information could\r\ncrystallize. Not less fantastic is the suggestion that\r\nan unknown a- has been engaged in impressing his own\r\nthoughts upon Mrs. Willett's mind after the fashion\r\nof a hypnotiser trying to act upon his patient from\r\na distance. If such an x exists let enquiry be made\r\nand let him be produced. Or finally, has there been\r\nno activity on either side, but only an automatic infiltration from mind to mind, unaccompanied by any consciousness on either side that such a process was taking\r\nplace ? This last supposition is, I think, even less\r\nplausible than the others, as it entirely fails to account\r\nfor the fact that the ideas which have thus been unconsciously communicated are not haphazard ideas, but\r\nsuch as have evidently been selected in order to serve a purpose. There must be conscious agency somewhere,\r\nelse this selection remains unexplained.\r\nThere is no warrant, so far as I am aware, in an j\r\nfacts hitherto observed in connection with the phenomena\r\nof telepathy for believing that particular and detailed\r\nknowledge of the kind involved in this case is ever telepathically transmitted or received where no link already\r\nexists between the minds concerned in the process.\r\n(3) and (4). I believe the instinctive judgment of trained\r\nsoldiers will be that the Dionysius puzzle could not have\r\nbeen invented, and elaborated without slip or blunder, except\r\nby somebody who was himself a scholar, and a ripe and good\r\none. Mrs. Willett herself cannot reasonably be credited\r\nwith its authorship. This point is raised in question (3),\r\nLXXTII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 237\r\nbut need not be further insisted on here. For the answers\r\nto questions (1) and (2) being in the negative, the answers to question (3) and (4) must be in the negative\r\nalso. As regards question (3), this conclusion can only\r\nbe escaped by supposing the mind of the automatist\r\nto have constructed the puzzle out of materials supernormally derived from some non-living source\u2014a supposition which not only has little to recommend it in itself, but also practically gives away the case against\r\ncommunication from the dead. And as regards question (4),\r\nif there was no living person from whom the materials\r\ncould plausibly be supposed to have been derived, still less could there be any living person responsible for the\r\nweaving of these materials into a design.\r\nIf these conclusions be accepted, the only alternative\r\nleft would seem to be that the communications have their source in some intelligence or intelligences not in the body.\r\nIt does not even then follow that they proceed from\r\nthe disembodied spirits of the individuals whom we\r\nknew in life as A. W. Verrall and S. H. Butcher. Those,\r\nhowever, who have got so far as to ascribe them to\r\nintelligences not in the body are not likely to find\r\nany additional difficulty in the personal identity claimed\r\nfor the communicators. To do so would be to strain\r\nat a gnat after swallowing a camel.\r\nIndependently of the negative grounds we have\r\njust been considering, are there any positive ones that\r\nmay fairly be urged for accepting Verrall and Butcher\r\nas the real authors of this curious literary puzzle ? I think there are, though it is not easy to estimate\r\ntheir exact value.\r\nThe reminder to Mrs. Verrall of the surprise expressed\r\nby her husband at her not knowing what was meant\r\nby the Ear of Dionysius, would be a very striking\r\nincident if it were certain that I had not mentioned\r\nit to Mrs. Willett. As I said before, I do not believe\r\nI did mention it. But I cannot be absolutely sure,\r\nand the doubt precludes me from laying stress upon it as evidence of identity.\r\n238 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nExtract E claims for the scheme as a whole that it\r\nis \"A. W. ish\" and \" S. H. ish.\" I think this is true. The ingenuity of the combination, the unexpectedness of the solution, and the out-of-the-way knowledge\r\nutilized in it are eminently Verrallian. In constructing\r\nthe puzzle Verrall appears to be the leading spirit. Butcher\r\nhelps with his contribution from the Poetics of Aristotle.\r\nBut he is content in such a matter to play the second\r\npart ; and this too is not uncharacteristic.\r\nThe personal traits and mannerisms which impressed\r\nMr. Bayfield so strongly in the Statius Scripts, and\r\nwhich he dealt with so hajapily in his Note appended\r\nto my former Paper, are perhaps not quite so marked\r\nin the present case. But I think old friends of Verrall'\r\ns\r\nwill agree with me that they are not wholly absent,\r\nhowever difficult it may be to enable others to realize\r\nthem.1\r\nFinally\u2014and this I think is a point of some importance\u2014we have the remarkable circumstance that the\r\nonly account of the contents of the Cyclops of Philoxenus\r\nwhich at all closely resembles that followed in the scripts,\r\nand at the same time includes references to Aristotle\r\nand the art of music (moiisike), is to be found, so far as my researches extend, in a book which we know\r\nVerrall to have been familiar with and to have used as a text-book for lectures. If this is a chance coincidence\r\nit is at least a curious one. It may well be that the\r\ncommunicator had this very circumstance in mind when\r\nhe made the statement (to be found in Extract D), \" The\r\nincident was chosen as being evidential of identity, and\r\nit arose out of the Ear train of thought.\"\r\n1 Note, for instance, the characteristic Verrallian impatience, eagerness, and emphasis in such phrases as \" not Stag, do go on \" in Extract\r\nC, and \" HAS the Satire been identified ? \" and \" listen, don't talk \"\r\nin Extract D.\r\nXXXIII.] The Ear of Dionysius. 239\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\nContaining extracts from the Scripts of Mrs. King referred\r\nto at p. 219 of the foregoing Paper.\r\nIn Mrs. Willett's Script of March 2, 1914 (vide Extract\r\nC, above), instruction was given that until the \" effort \"\r\nwas completed, the portions of it as they came were\r\nnot to be shewn to any other automatist. This was\r\nalmost equivalent to saying that a cross-correspondence\r\nwith the script of some other automatist belonging to\r\nthe group was about to be attempted. I believe some\r\nattempt of the kind was made in certain passages from\r\nscripts produced by \" Mrs. King.\" I have not included\r\nthese in the text of my Paper on the Ear of Dionysius,\r\npartly because I was unwilling to break the narrative,\r\npartly because the cross-correspondences themselves are not so clear and unmistakable as to carry unquestioning conviction. That Mrs. King's scripts taken as a whole exhibit manifold connections with those of certain\r\nother automatists, of whom Mrs. Willett is one, I have\r\nno doubt at all. But what may well be in their origin\r\ngenuine \" messages \" seem in her case peculiarly liable\r\nto get blurred and sophisticated in transmission, and\r\ntherefore difficult to interpret. My readers must judge\r\nfor themselves how far the interpretations which I\r\ntentatively put forward of the passages here collected are\r\njustified. In support of the view that a cross-corre- spondence is being attempted, it should be noticed that\r\nthe first three passages all belong to March, 1914; that\r\nis to say, that they were all produced within a few\r\nweeks of the Willett scripts from which Extracts B\r\nand C in the Paper are taken. The dates of the Willett\r\nscripts are Feb. 28 and March 2. The first passage I quote\r\nfrom Mrs. King was written on the intervening day, March 1.\r\n[a) (Extract from King Script of March 1, 1914.)\r\nFloating on the waters.

The words \" Sicilian Ode\u2014Blest pair of Sirens \" suggested to me that \" Sicilian \" must be a mistake for \" Cecilian,\" and that the \"Ode\" must be Dryden's\r\nOde for St. Cecilia's Day.

ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENT TYPES\r\nOF EVIDENCE FOR SURVIVAL LN THE WORK\r\nOF THE SOCIETY.\r\nA Paper Read to the Society at a Private Meeting\r\non April 26, 1917.\r\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\r\nIn their annual report in January last, the Council of\r\nthe Society remarked that in the last ten years there\r\nhas been an increase in the amount of evidence for\r\nsurvival presented by the Society and deserving serious\r\nconsideration, as compared to what was obtained in the\r\nfirst twenty-five years of the Society's existence.\r\nI have thought that some amplification and justification of this statement might be interesting to members\r\nof the Society, together with some classification of the\r\nkinds of evidence for survival that have been obtained.\r\nThe two\u2014that is development and classification\u2014are rather closely connected, for the increase of evidence is Q\r\n246 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\r\ndue to new developments from 1901 onwards, first brought\r\nprominently forward through Mrs. Verrall's report on\r\nher own automatic script, published in 1906 {Proceedings,.\r\nVol. XX.). I must, however, make it clear at once\r\nthat I have nothing original to say and neither new\r\nevidence to bring forward nor fresh explanations to offer.\r\nNor do I intend to appraise in detail the evidence already\r\nbrought forwaid or to estimate how much more may be\r\nrequired before scientific certainty that our spirits survive\r\nbodily death, and can sometimes and to some extent\r\ncommunicate with the living, is generally accepted as established. That there is a great deal of plodding work\r\nbefore us ere this point is attained few members of the\r\nSociety will doubt, but in the meanwhile a brief survey\r\nof the route so far traversed, and the noting of some\r\nimportant landmarks on it may be of use. The question whether good scientific evidence of sur- vival\u2014as distinct of course from philosophical or theological reasons for believing in it \u2014could be obtained, is probably one which from the foundation of the Society\r\nin 1882 has interested the majority of the members more\r\nthan any other branch of our enquiries, because of the\r\nfar-reaching consequences its solution would carry with\r\nit. One consequence would be a decisive argument\r\nagainst materialism, and it is this that leads some of\r\nthose who hold dogmatically a materialistic view of the\r\nuniverse to oppose, not only any conclusion that survival can be proved, but any enquiry into the subject, with a\r\nvirulence resembling that of medieval theologians.\r\nNotwithstanding the interest of the subject, however,\r\nand any bias which this may be supposed to have created\r\nin the investigators, the evidence that came in during the\r\nearly years of the Society, and the progress made in\r\ninterpreting it, seemed at first to lead us backwards in a certain sense as regards proof of survival. The two\r\ndepartments in which real steps forward were made in\r\nthe work the Society had set before itself, were telepathy\r\nand knowledge about the subliminal working of the mind.\r\nAn unexpectedly large amount of evidence, both experimental and spontaneous, flowed in for the existence of\r\nlxxiv.] Different Types of Evidence for Survival. 247\r\ntelepathy\u2014that is for communication between mind and\r\nmind otherwise than through the known channels of sense. And also much light was obtained\u2014partly through\r\nhypnotism and automatic writing, but also through spontaneous cases\u2014on the subconscious working of the mind.\r\nNeither telepathy nor subconscious mentation was of course a new idea, 1 but as regards both much new evidence was obtained, and as regards the latter it was\r\nobtained both inside and outside the Society. Everyone\r\nnow knows that a subconscious part of us may carry\r\non, not only habitual and mechanical actions, but trains\r\nof thought and reasoning processes, and in certain cases even act on them ; and that all this may happen while our normal consciousness is also active and without its\r\nparticipation 01 knowledge.\r\nThe two lines of investigation\u2014those into telepathy\r\nand into the working of the subliminal consciousnesswere found to be more or less closely connected ; for\r\nthere is good reason to think that it is largely\u2014perhaps\r\nchiefly\u2014through the subliminal strata that telepathy\r\noperates.\r\nWhen I say that our investigations seemed at first to lead us in the negative direction as regards proof cf\r\nsurvival, I do not mean that either telepathy between\r\nthe living or the existence of the subliminal consciousness furnishes arguments against survival\u2014very much\r\nthe contrary. Telepathy, if a purely psychical process, \u2014and the reasons for thinking it so increase\r\n\r\nindicates that the mind can work independently of the\r\nbody, and thus adds to the probability that it can sur- vive it. Increased knowledge about the subliminal self,\r\nby giving glimpses of extension of human faculty and\r\nshowing that there is more of us than we are normally\r\naware of, similarly suggests that the limitations imposed\r\nby our bodies and our material surroundings are temporary 1 imitations\r\n.\r\nBut though the quest for scientific proof of sur1 As is well known, Sir William Barrett, afterwards one of the founders\r\nof our Society, brought the subject of thought-transference or telepathy\r\nbefore the British Association in 1876.\r\n248 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\r\nvival was thus in one way made more hopeful by the\r\nearly work of the Society, it was in another way made\r\nmore difficult. Unexpected obstacles presented themselves. Things that at first sight looked like evidence\r\nfor communication from the dead were discounted as such\r\nbecause they could be explained by telepathy from the\r\nliving. This applies, for instance, to all communications\r\npurporting to come from the dead where the matter\r\ncommunicated is known to any living person directly or indirectly in touch with the medium ; but matters\r\nunknown to any living person can seldom be verified.\r\nAgain the mere claim to come from the dead is invalidated, because the subliminal consciousness concerned in\r\nautomatic writing and trance speaking has been found\r\nliable to claim more knowledge and power than it possesses, to say things which are not true, and to offer\r\nfalse excuses when the untruth is discovered. This subliminal trickiness may be found in the case of persons\r\nwho in their normal life are upright and honourable ;\r\njust as in dreams we may behave in a way that would\r\nshock us in our waking life. Another embarrassing\r\ncircumstance from the evidential point of view is that\r\nthe subliminal memory does not coincide with the supraliminal, and can draw upon a store not accessible to the\r\nnormal consciousness. And further, things may be subliminally taken note of, which do not enter, or scarcely\r\nenter the normal consciousness at all. Then again the evidence from what are popularly\r\ncalled ghosts was greatly reduced because, though there\r\nwere numerous and well authenticated instances of\r\napparitions at or about the time of death of the person\r\nseen, it became necessary, provisionally at least, to class\r\nthem as due to telepathic influence, before death, of the\r\ndying person. There remained cases of post-mortem\r\napparitions, but well-evidenced cases in which there is something to show that the experience is not of purely\r\nsubjective origin are comparatively few, though there\r\nare no doubt some which are striking. Even among\r\nthese, if the apparition occurred before the fact of the\r\ndeath was known and within a few hours of it, the\r\nlxxiv.] Different Types of Evidence for Survival. 249\r\npossibility of the telepathic impression having been\r\nreceived earlier and remaining latent in the subconscious had to be allowed for ; for of such deferred\r\nemergence into consciousness there was in certain cases\r\ndistinct evidence. It is noteworthy, however, that in a statistical enquiry undertaken by the Society, of which\r\nthe results were published in 1894 (in our Proceedings,\r\nVol. X.), a tendency was found for apparitions to\r\ncluster about the time- of death of the persons seen in a way suggesting at any rate that death involves no\r\nsudden transition from a state in which communication\r\nwith the living is possible to a state in which it is not.\r\nIf we call the person seen the agent, they occur during\r\nthe agent's fatal illness, whether this is known or unknown to the percipient, in increasing frequency as death approaches, the largest number occurring at or about the time of the death itself. And they\r\ncontinue to occur after the death whether the fact of\r\ndeath is known or unknown to the percipient, becoming\r\nrarer as the death recedes into the distance. As far as\r\nit goes this points to continued influence of the agent\r\nafter death, and must be reckoned as contributing something to the evidence whose development I am trying\r\nto trace.\r\nFully aware of all the difficulties I have spoken of,\r\nby which possible evidence for survival is hemmed in\r\nand restricted, we began investigations with Mrs. Piper.\r\nReports of her powers had reached the English workers\r\nfrom Dr. Hodgson and Professor William James in\r\nAmerica, and in the winter of 1889-90 she was brought\r\nto England and gave sittings under the management\r\nof Mr. Myers, Dr. Leaf, and Sir Oliver Lodge, with\r\nresults reported in Proceedings, Vol. VI. Striking evidence\r\nwas obtained at least of telepathic communication with\r\nthe living, and some distinctly pointing to communication\r\nwith the dead. There was, however, also evidence of\r\nfalse personation, false statements, attempts by the\r\ntrance personalities to get information from the sitter, or to cover up error, and so forth. The results of the\r\nAmerican enquiry\u20141887 to 1891\u2014on which Dr. Hodgson\r\n250 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\r\nreported in 1892 (in our Proceedings, Vol. VIII.) were\r\nvery similar. Hodgson's summing up was that the evidence so far obtained was very far from sufficient to\r\nestablish the conclusion that Mrs. Piper's control\u2014Phinuit \u2014was in direct communication with deceased persons\r\nor was a deceased person himself as he alleged. He\r\nadds (p. 57) that\r\n\" the failures in answering test questions and the apparent\r\nignorance displayed in other ways by the alleged ' communicators,' . . . constitute almost insuperable objections to the\r\nsupposition that the ' deceased ' persons concerned were in\r\ndirect communication with Phinuit, at least in anything like\r\nthe fulness, so to speak, of their personality.\"\r\nHe thought, however, that there might perhaps be some\r\nindirect communication of a partial and fragmentary kind.\r\nThat is where we had got to in 1892, ten years after\r\nthe formation of the Society. But in that year, while\r\nHodgson's report was going through the press, evidence\r\nwas obtained through Mrs. Piper, which greatly modified\r\nHodgson's view. A young man known in our Proceedings\r\nby the jDseudonym George Pelham, commonly abbreviated\r\ninto G. P., died early in 1892, and shortly afterwards\r\nappeared to communicate through, and to \" control,\"\r\nMrs. Piper. His communications, though by no means\r\nfree from confusion and error, were fuller and more convincing than most of the previous ones had been ; and,\r\nmoreover, under his supposed influence, Mrs. Piper's\r\ntrance communications generally became in various ways\r\nbetter. By the time Hodgson published his second report\r\non her, in 1898, he had become convinced that the\r\nspiritualistic hypothesis was the one that best fitted the\r\nfacts. He believed that the chief \" communicators \"\r\nto whom he had referred in his report\r\n\" are \" (to use his own words) \" veritably the personalities\r\nthat they claim to be, that they have survived the change\r\nwe call death, and that they have directly communicated\r\nwith us whom we call living \" (Proceedings, XIII., p. 405).\r\nOf course Hodgson did not carry us all with him\r\nThere was much discussion of his conclusion. But though\r\nixxiv.] Different Types of Evidence for Survival. 251\r\nall did not agree that the evidence for survival was yet\r\nconclusive, all who studied the subject felt, I think,\r\nthat at any rate there was evidence that had to be taken\r\naccount of. This conclusion was well put at the time by Professor\r\nRomaine Newbold in a paper on evidence obtained\r\nthrough Mrs. Piper published in Proceedings, Vol. XIV.\r\nHe says (p. 10) :\r\n' : From such inconsistent material one can draw no fixed\r\nconclusions. But there is one result which I think the investigation into Mrs. Piper's and kindred cases should achieve.\r\nPor any theory some intrinsically strong evidence must be\r\nadduced, even if there be but little of it, before the theory can be given any standing in court at all. Until within\r\nvery recent years the scientific world has tacitly rejected a\r\nlarge number of important philosophical conceptions on the\r\nground that there is absolutely no evidence in their favour\r\nwhatever. Among those popular conceptions are those of\r\nthe essential independence of the mind and the body, of\r\nthe existence of a supersensible world, and of the possibility\r\nof occasional communication between that world and this.\r\nWe have here, as it seems to me, evidence that is worthy\r\nof consideration for all these points. It was well expressed\r\nby a friend of mine, a scholar who has been known for his\r\nuncompromising opposition to every form of supernaturalism.\r\nHe had had a sitting with Mrs. Piper, at which very re- markable disclosures were made, and shortly afterwards said\r\nto me, in effect, ' Scientific men cannot say much longer\r\nthat there is no evidence for a future life. I have said it,\r\nbut I shall say it no longer ; I know now that there is evidence, for I have seen it. I do not believe in a future\r\nlife. I regard it as one of the most improbable of theories.\r\nThe evidence is scanty and ambiguous and insufficient, but\r\nit is evidence and it must be reckoned with.' \"\r\nOne obvious weakness in the position at this stage\r\nwas that the evidence depended so largely on a single\r\nmedium. Late in the nineties, however, Mr. Myers\r\nbecame acquainted with Mrs. Thompson, a lady with\r\nmediumistic powers, who, like Mrs. Piper, went into\r\n252 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\r\ntrance, but who was not a professional medium. He\r\ngave some account of her mediumship to the International\r\nCongress of Psychology, which met at Paris in 1900,\r\nin a paper reprinted from the Compte Rendu of the\r\nCongress in our Proceedings, Vol. XVII. He there says\r\n(p. 73)\r\n:\r\n\" I believe, then, that I have good reason for ascribing many\r\nof these messages to definite surviving personalities, known\r\nwhile on earth to friends of mine whose presence with Mrs.\r\nThompson has evoked the messages, or to myself.\"\r\nMr. Myers, who died, it will be remembered, on January\r\n17, 1901, did not publish the evidence collected by himself concerning Mrs. Thompson ; but there are interesting\r\npapers about her by Mr. Piddington and others in Proceedings, Vols. XVII. and XVIII. The evidence for\r\nsupernormally acquired knowledge is, I think, clear, in\r\nspite of the usual mixture of irrelevant and erroneous matter ; but evidence through hei, quite distinctively\r\nmaking for communication from the dead, is not large\r\nin amount. This is also true of another lady through\r\nwhose automatic writing Mr. Myers got some evidence \u2014the lady whom we call Mrs. Forbes, and whose writing\r\npurports to come from her son. In 1900 therefore evidence of survival, convincing to\r\nsome investigators, had been obtained through the trance\r\nspeech or the automatic writing of at least three sensitives.\r\nMr. Myers reviewing the work done by the Society in\r\nhis Presidential address in that year, says, speaking of course for himself alone : I \" Knowledge not attainable in any normal fashion ... is shown in telepathic messages between living men, and in\r\napparitions of men dying, and in evidential messages from\r\nmen whom we call dead. All this \u2014in Phantasms of the Living\r\nand in fourteen volumes of the Proceedings\u2014I claim that\r\nwe have adequately shown, and of late years we have advanced and consolidated these fragmentary and fugitive\r\nindications of the spirit's survival, by certain records of\r\ntrance-phenomena and spirit-possession \u2014records as yet inchoate\r\nlxxiv.] Different Types of Evidence for Survival. 253\r\nand imperfect, yet which must needs be faced and\r\ndealt with by all serious men \" (Proceedings, Vol. XV., p. 119.) 1 Up to this point the evidence for survival obtained\r\nby the Society was of two types. In the first apparitions, or trance communications, or automatic script,\r\nconveyed true facts connected with a deceased person\r\nwhich were not previously known to the recipients of\r\nthe message. Sir Oliver Lodge's interesting case about\r\nthe group photograph (Proceedings XXIX., p. 132) is of course a recent instance of this class. The characteristic\r\nof the second type is dramatic representation,\r\n\r\ne.g. the\r\nexhibition in the trance state of details so full, or personation of the deceased so life-like, that it is difficult\r\nto suppose that telepathy from the living alone can\r\naccount for it. A good deal of the best evidence concerning G. P. and others through Mrs. Piper was of this\r\ntype. Evidence of this kind can be very impressive,\r\nbut unfoitunately it is almost necessarily more impressive\r\nto the person who receives it, and who feels as if he were really talking to his friend, than it can be to other\r\npeople. A personal equation comes in to an extent\r\nthat makes it generally very difficult to judge of the\r\nobjective value of the evidence. Investigators have\r\ntherefore made special efforts to obtain from the dead\r\nevidence of the first type\u2014verifiable information un- known to the living.\r\nWith this end in view was devised the plan of writing a message before death and sealing it up in an envelope\r\ndeposited with a trustworthy person. The contents of\r\nthe envelope were to be communicated after death\r\nby the deceased person. Unfortunately this experiment has so far failed. Two or three envelopes\r\nhave been deposited to our knowledge by persons since\r\ndead, but either no communication has come concerning them, or what was taken to be a statement\r\n1 Mr. Myers' own book, Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily\r\nDeath, was, it will be remembered, not published till after his death ;. a good deal of it had, however, appeared in substance in papers in our\r\nProceedings.\r\n254 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\r\nof their contents has proved erroneous. This, it will be\r\nremembered, is what happened in the case of an en- velope deposited by Mr. Myers with Sir Oliver Lodge.\r\nSuccess in such an experiment must necessarily be very\r\ndoubtful, for there are obviously many difficulties. The\r\ndepositor may forget his message. (I am sure I should.)\r\nOr he may be unable to communicate at all. Or his\r\nmedium may fail to receive or to deliver his message\r\nas given. But a more important reason for questioning\r\nwhether the experiment is worth repeating is an evidential weakness in it. It is difficult to see how, in case\r\nof success, the objection can be met that the message\r\nmight have been learnt telepathically from the depositor\r\nbefore his death.\r\nSince the beginning of 1901 two other types of evidence have been obtained : namely (1) Cioss-correspondences and ^2) communications of which those discussed\r\nin Mi'. Gerald Balfour's recent paper (The Ear of\r\nDionysius) are specimens. When independent references\r\nto the same topic occur at about the same time in\r\nthe scripts of two or more automatists, we call it a\r\ncross-correspondence. One of the earliest, if not the\r\nearliest, recorded case of this took place on January 11,\r\n1901, and is a good specimen of a simple cross-corre- spondence. On that day a Sidgwick control\u2014Dr. Sidgwick\r\nhad died a few months earlier\u2014made its appearance\r\nfor the first time at a sitting with Mrs. Thompson in\r\nEngland, and at one with Miss Rawson in the South\r\nof France ; and through each, messages for me were\r\ngiven which, though not in themselves evidential or\r\nspecially appropriate, showed similarity in the choice\r\nof a by no means obvious topic. This correspondence,\r\nwhich was not discovered till some three years later,\r\nbecause the records of what passed at the sittings of the\r\ntwo ladies were not compared, is described, together\r\nwith some others of about the same date, in Mr.\r\nPiddington's paper on Mrs. Thompson in Proceedings,\r\nVol. XVIII. (p. 295).\r\nSince this early specimen there has been, as we all\r\nknow, a great development in cross -correspondences, and\r\nIjXXTV.] Different Types of Evidence for Survival. 255\r\nthey have been described and commented on in many\r\npapers in the Proceedings. Before very long it was\r\nnoticed\u2014Miss Johnson was the first to observe it I\r\nthink\u2014that some of them were not of the simple type\r\nof the sample just given, but of what has been called a complementary type\u2014one part or one aspect of an\r\nidea being given by one automatist, and the idea\r\ncompleted or another aspect of it given by another automatist, and this in such a way as to indicate a purposive\r\ndistribution of the parts, or in other words intelligent\r\ndesign. The evidence for design in any particular case must be judged by the student. I think in some of the\r\npublished cases it is strong. Granted design we have\r\nto seek the designer. It cannot be the supraliminal\r\nintelligence of either automatist since ex hypothesi neither\r\nof them is aware of the design till it is completed.\r\nNor, for a similar reason, can it be attributed to some\r\nother living person since, so far as can be ascertained,\r\nno other living person had any knowledge of what was\r\ngoing on. It is extremely difficult to suppose that the\r\ndesign is an elaborate plot of the subliminal intelligence\r\nof either or both automatists acting independently and\r\nwithout any knowledge on the part of the supraliminal\r\nconsciousness ; and the only remaining hypothesis seems\r\nto be that the designer is an external intelligence not\r\nin the body. It is clear, as has often been said before,\r\nthat we have here in any case what may more and\r\nmore prove a very fruitful line of experiment. The\r\nscripts claim that the designers are persons \u2014at first especially Myers and Gurney\u2014who when in the body\r\nwere interested in us and in the work we are doing,\r\nand who are now co-operating with us from the other\r\nside of the veil.\r\nThis claim is supported by the second kind of evidence which I mentioned as having been obtained of\r\nlate years\u2014namely scripts exhibiting literary knowledge\r\nor propounding literary puzzles beyond the range of\r\nwhat the automatist could produce, but appropriate\r\nto the alleged communicator. Of this kind of evidence\r\nthere has been a good deal ; sometimes combined with\r\n256 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\r\ncross-correspondences and sometimes not. \" The Ear of\r\nDionysius case \" is I think the most striking.\r\nI must admit that the general effect of the evidence\r\non my own mind is that there is co-operation with us by friends and former fellow-workers no longer in the\r\nbody. But whether this is true or not, the increase\r\nin the amount of evidence that has to be considered\r\nis undoubted ; and I want to call attention to the\r\nfact that this increase has been accompanied and greatly\r\nhelped by a notable increase since 1900 in co-operation\r\non this side\u2014especially in the number of persons with\r\nautomatic powers who have been themselves interested\r\nin the phenomena and able and willing to keep full\r\nrecords, to place their scripts at once in the charge of\r\nsome responsible person, and in every way to aid in the\r\ninvestigation. I may briefly recall these workers to your\r\nminds. We have had Mrs. Verrall, who developed her\r\npower of automatic writing in the early months of 1901,\r\nand continued until her death last year ; and Miss\r\nVerrall (Mrs. Salter) who began writing occasionally\r\nunder her mother's influence in 1903 and took it up\r\nmore regularly in 1906. Mrs. Holland, who had previously\r\nwritten automatically from time to time, put herself\r\nin communication with Mss Johnson in 1903 after\r\nreading Mi'. Myers' book Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death, and continued for many years\r\nto send her script to her. Miss Johnson has published\r\nthree interesting reports on it in our Proceedings.\r\nThe first of these, immediately after its publication\r\nin 1908, was read by the lady we call Miss Mac.\r\nShe and her brother had already tried for and\r\nobtained automatic writing with a planchette after reading Human Personality, but the reading of Miss Johnson's\r\npaper on Mrs. Holland seems to have brought them\r\ninto psychical relation with the S.P.R. group of investigators to whom they weie complete strangers. They\r\ndeveloped a Sidgwick control, and their script told them\r\nto send what they had written to Mrs. Verrall. When\r\nthey did so interesting cross-correspondences were found.\r\nMrs. Willett, who knew a little about the work of the\r\nlxxiv.] Different Types of Evidence for Survival. 257\r\nSociety, also began to write automatically towards the\r\nend of 1908, and communicated on the subject with Mrs.\r\nVerrall, then a stranger to her ; and since then Mrs.\r\nKing and Mrs. Wilson have been added to the workers\r\nand have contributed to cross -correspondence evidence.\r\nAn interesting point about these two last coadjutors is that their automatism is different in type from that of\r\nthe others. This is especially true of Mrs. Wilson, one\r\nof our most promising workers, as most of her impressions\r\ncome to her in the form of pictures or scenes of which\r\nshe afterwards writes down the description.\r\nSome results with all these ladies have been laid before\r\nthe Society, but naturally there is a good deal which\r\nis of too private a nature for publication. This is all the more so because in the case of some of them emotional\r\nconsiderations and a desire to get into communication\r\nwith particular deceased individuals, have been motives\r\nstimulating to the effort to write automatically. Intellectual interest and the wish to help in the investigation\r\nappear, however, in most cases to have been the grounds\r\nfor the trouble taken.\r\nTo the seven ladies just named we must add, as also\r\nconcerned with cross-correspondences, Mrs. Forbes, Mrs.\r\nThompson and Mrs. Piper, who were working before\r\n1900 ; and three other sensitives\u2014Miss Rawson, already\r\nmentioned, Mrs. Frith and Mrs. Home, who have come\r\ninto touch at one or two points, but who, though they\r\nhave produced a good deal of automatic writing or trancespeaking, have not in the main worked with us nor, so far as our own investigations are concerned, furnished\r\nmuch of evidential value.\r\nThe valuable results obtained naturally make all who\r\nare interested in the advance of knowledge in this diffi- cult region anxious for more workers. The power of\r\nwriting automatically is not very rare, and in many\r\ncases it may be developed by practice and perseverance.\r\nApparently, however, only a small proportion of automatists get results showing evidence of any supernormal\r\nacquisition of knowledge. The content of most automatic\r\nscript, like that of most dreams, seems to originate in\r\n258 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part.\r\nthe subliminal strata of consciousness, working only\r\non ideas normally acquired through the senses. Much\r\nthat is produced even by those who, from our point\r\nof view, are the best automatists, is apparently of this\r\nkind. Communications giving evidence of supernormal\r\norigin must be sought for like grains of gold among\r\nsand, and even with the same automatist the gold\r\nmay sometimes predominate and sometimes the sand,, or sometimes there may be no gold at all. But\r\nall material where there is hope of finding gold must\r\nbe examined, for we have much to learn. Before we\r\ncan convince the world we not only want more cases giving evidence of the fact of personal survival, but\r\nwe want them solidly based on more knowledge of the\r\nsubliminal self and the way it works, more knowledge\r\nof the conditions and process of telepathy, more understanding of the limitations under which communication\r\nwith the dead occurs. All this will no doubt require\r\nprolonged and careful research and much patience.\r\nAsking for automatists brings me to an aspect of\r\nthe matter which we know sometimes troubles people.\r\nThey want to know whether the practice of automatic\r\nwriting is harmful. I think all the automatists I have\r\nnamed\u2014and I have named twelve\u2014-besides Mrs. Piper,\r\nwho differed fiom the others in being a professional\r\nmedium\u2014would say it was not harmful. But of course\r\nthe faculty should be exercised with due caution and\r\ncommon-sense. In the first place its exercise is, to some\r\npeople at least, fatiguing, and should therefore not be\r\ncontinued too long at a time or attempted too frequently.\r\nIn the second place absorption in communications to\r\nthe exclusion of other interests is not likely to be whole- some. Thirdly, any tendency for the subliminal to get\r\nthe upper hand should be carefully checked. If an\r\nautomatist found the impulse to write beginning to be\r\nirresistible, or if the content of the script tended to be\r\nhabitually such as his or her normal judgment disapproved of, I should certainly advise desisting altogether\r\nfrom exercising the faculty. No one ought to let his reason abdicate in favour of the untrustworthy and ill-\r\nlxxiv.] Different Types of Evidence for Survival. 259*\r\nregulated mental stratum that the subliminal left to itself\r\nis liable to be.\r\nFor similar reasons no one should treat his own\r\nautomatic writing, and still less communications through\r\nother mediums, whether private or professional, as oracles.\r\nPerhaps it is hardly necessary to say this to members\r\nof our Society. But there are people who seem too\r\nready to accept mediumistic utterances uncritically at\r\ntheir face value, and to regard them as revelations from\r\nspirits with better means of judging than themselves.\r\nAssuming, however, that through a medium, or through\r\nour own script, we are really in touch with the supposed\r\ncommunicator, we have no guarantee that the communication reaches us as he desired to send it. Oui evidence,,\r\nindeed, goes to show that it is often, if not always,\r\nmuch adulterated by the automatist's own mind.\r\nThis want of clearness and purity in the stream of\r\ncommunication makes attempts at intimate converse with the dead doubtful and difficult, and to some people\r\npainful ; and I think there are many who would get\r\nmore comfort from dwelling on the hope that those who\r\nhave loved us and gone are in touch with us subliminally,\r\neven when we are not consciously aware of it. This\r\nhope, it will be observed, is greatly justified and supported by scientific evidence that the soul survives bodily\r\ndeath and can, under whatever limited conditions, at\r\ntimes communicate with the living.\r\n260 Miss F. Melian Stawell. [part\r\nII. THE EAR OF DIONYSIUS : A DISCUSSION OF\r\nTHE EVIDENCE.\r\nA Paper Read to the Society at a Private Meeting\r\non April 26, 1917.\r\nBy Miss F. Melian Stawell.\r\nTo my mind the most striking single piece of evidence\r\npointing towards survival that has appeared lately in our\r\nrecords is that furnished by the cluster of scripts comiected\r\nwith the \" Ear of Dionysius,\" and it is to these that I\r\nwish to devote my paper. I choose them instead of the\r\nevidence in \" Raymond,\" partly because they are more\r\nwithin my compass, and partly because it seems to me\r\nthat the possibility of chance-coincidence is less great here\r\nthan in \"Raymond.\" The most remarkable incident in \" Raymond \" is that of the photograph, unknown to the\r\nmedium or the sitters, but in which the general features of\r\nthe background and the relation of two figures\u2014one\r\nleaning on the other\u2014were correctly described. Can we\r\nsay confidently that this coincidence, remarkable as it is,\r\nis yet beyond the reach of chance ? I could not myself,\r\nthough no doubt answers will vary. For it is extremely\r\ndifficult to collect enough evidence about chance-coincidence.\r\nAll I can say is that I have been impressed by the\r\namount of chance-coincidence that has come under my\r\nown observation. For instance, the experiment of artificial\r\nscripts made by the S.P.R. in 1911 showed, I thought, a\r\nsurprising amount of cross-correspondence, entirely due to\r\nchance. You may remember that six persons, none of\r\nwhom possessed any supernormal powers, were asked, each\r\non six several occasions, to open at random some book\r\nlxxiv.] The Ear of Dionysius : Discussion of Evidence. 261\r\nof English literature, choose a passage, and write\r\ndown the thoughts suggested. In comparing the thirty-six\r\nwritings, at least one distinct \" cross correspondence,\" that\r\non \"Moonlight,\" was to be observed. I myself, who happened\r\nto be one of the experimenters, found to my astonishment\r\nthat the casual script of another possessed for me personally\r\nthe greatest significance. In fact so astonished was I that\r\nI thought some telepathic agency must be at work. The\r\nphrases in this script, which to an ordinary reader had no\r\nobvious connection, could all be interpreted, and very easily, as connected with a friend of mine who had lately died.\r\n\"Moonlight\" also had a special significance for me in\r\nthe same connection. Miss Johnson then pointed out that\r\nto test the matter we should ask the writer, another lady,\r\nif she could remember how the phrases came into her mind,\r\nand that we should also make experiments to see if there\r\nwas, in fact, the possibility of telepathy between us. What\r\nwas the result ? No thought-transference took place in\r\nour experiments, and the writer had a complete and satisfactory explanation of how the phrases, so significant to me,\r\nhad come into her own script, carrying for her quite other\r\nassociations than they did for myself.\r\nAgain, I have noticed for the last few years an absurd\r\nfrequency with which either the number 11 or a multiple of\r\nit is associated with some date, place, or topic, in which I\r\nam interested, so much so that it would be easy to make\r\nout a case for a mysterious connection between myself and\r\nthe number 11.\r\nI mention this topic of chance, partly to urge the need\r\nfor further investigation and partly because of its bearing\r\non the \" Ear of Dionysius.\" It is obvious, I think, that\r\nall the statements in the scripts we have to consider cannot\r\nbe due to chance, though some of them may be.\r\nMr. Balfour has stated and analysed the incident in a\r\nmasterly fashion. His argument that the communicator\r\nwas really Dr. Verrall's discarnate mind is certainly extremely\r\ncogent. But I do not feel it entirely convincing. There is a\r\ndifficulty, and, apart from this, another hypothesis is possible.\r\nOf course, if there were no general reason to doubt survival\r\nafter death there would be less reason to trouble about another\r\nR\r\n262 Miss F. Melian Stawell. [part\r\nhypothesis. But there is plenty of reason for doubt, because\r\nof all the negative evidence that exists, some of it collected\r\nby the S.P.R. itself, e.g. the failure of test-questions, or the\r\ninability, shown on more than one occasion, to state the\r\ncontents of a sealed envelope written before the communicator's death.\r\nThe positive evidence, however, furnished by the \" Ear\r\nof Dionysius \" seems, as I said, very considerable, and may\r\nbe summarised thus, though the summary cannot do justice\r\nto its intricacy and fullness. In two scripts of Mrs. Willett's,\r\nherself no classical scholar, there appeared a number of classical\r\nallusions, some of them recondite, and all said to be connected\r\nwith the \"Ear of Dionysius\" (a whispering-gallery constructed\r\nby the tyrant and opening on the stone-quarries of Syracuse\r\nwhich were used as a prison). Further, the allusions were\r\ngiven in such a way that their connection was a regular\r\npuzzle, even to trained scholars, e.g. the \" One Ear \" (of\r\nDionysius) was, the script indicated, to be connected with the\r\n\" One Eye,\" evidently the one eye of the Cyclops Polyphemus. But how ? At last, in a later sitting, the clue\r\nwas suddenly revealed by the half-word \" Philox,\" indicating the name of Philoxenus, a Greek poet, closely\r\nassociated with Dionysius, whom he satirised as Polyphemus. The story of Philoxenus, according to one version,, a somewhat peculiar one, made all the allusions and\r\nconnections perfectly clear. The communicator purported\r\nto be Dr. Verrall, aided by his friend Prof. Butcher, and the\r\nstyle in which the references were given strongly resembled\r\nhis. Finally, after all the scripts were written, it was\r\ndiscovered that the story of Philoxenus in the appropriate\r\nversion happened to be told with some detail in a book,\r\nSmyth's Greek Melic Poets, that Dr. Verrall used and had\r\nin his library.\r\nI said there was a difficulty in the hypothesis that\r\nDr. Verrall was communicating. It is this. In the two\r\nleading scripts (Feb. 28, Mar. 2, 1914, Scripts B and C) r the communicator said that Mrs. Verrall was to hear\r\nnothing of the matter, and that there was much more to\r\nbe got through. Yet, abruptly, immediately after this, all communication on the topic ceased, so far as Mrs. Willett\r\nlxxiv.] The Ear of Dionysius : Discussion of Evidence. 263\r\nwas concerned, for a whole year and a half, until suddenly,\r\nat a sitting where Mrs. Verrall herself was present, the subject\r\nwas re-opened, the clue given, and great surprise expressed\r\nthat Mrs. Verrall had received no message on the matter.\r\nThis implies a very strange lapse of memory on the part\r\nof the communicator, so strange that one is forced to ask,\r\nCan it be explained satisfactorily on the hypothesis that\r\nthere really was a deliberate conscious personality controlling\r\nthe communications ? I find it hard to think so. And another hypothesis is at least plausible. We may, I\r\nthink, rule out pretty confidently the suggestion that Mrs.\r\nWillett herself had ever known the whole story of Philox- enus and all the references involved. For we are told that\r\nshe is not a classical scholar, and a non-classical reader\r\ncould hardly have acquired the knowledge necessary\r\nwithout deliberately hunting through classical books for\r\nthe purpose. If Mrs. Willett had done this, she could\r\nscarcely have forgotten it. But if she did not forget it,\r\nshe must have acted in bad faith. And not only is her\r\ngood faith vouched for by our investigators, but no one\r\nacting in bad faith would have left the communications\r\nwith the inconsequent ending I have described. The\r\nmessages could so easily have been neatly rounded off\r\nlong before the sitting with Mrs. Verrall, and so gained\r\ngreatly in impressiveness. But it by no means follows that\r\nMrs. Willett, acting in perfect good faith, did not have a\r\nfair amount of relevant knowledge latent in her mind\r\nwhich would help to build up the script. It is plain that\r\nMrs. Willett's conscious mind does forget very easily.\r\nWhen asked by Mr. Balfour (27 May, 1916) what she knew\r\nabout the \" Ear of Dionysius,\" she said she had heard the\r\nexpression, but did not know the meaning of it. Yet only\r\ntwo years before she had written, in her normal consciousness, script containing a fairly full account of the \" Ear,\"\r\na script of which she had kept an annotated copy to which,\r\nas Mr. Balfour tells us, she could refer at any time\r\n(p. 205). I feel, therefore, considerable hesitation in thinking\r\nthat she had really never known that Prof. Butcher had\r\nwritten on Aristotle's Poetics. For she was interested in\r\nProf. Butcher, and she was a friend of Mrs. Verrall. She\r\n264 Miss F. Melian Stawell. [part\r\nmust have had many opportunities of seeing or hearing\r\nsome reference to his most important work. Nor can I\r\nfeel sure that an educated woman \" with a taste for\r\npoetry \" had never come across the story of Ulysses\r\nand the Cyclops Polyphemus ; though I can readily believe\r\nthat she had forgotten the name Polyphemus and the\r\nfact of Prof. Butcher's connection with the Poetics, the\r\nknowledge remaining dormant even in her sub-conscious\r\nmind until stimulated by some outside influence.\r\nThat influence, I suggest, was the sub-conscious mind of\r\nMrs. Verrall. It does seem to me that Mr. Balfour dismisses\r\nthis possibility far too lightly. In the first place, I think\r\nit not only possible, but probable, that Mrs. Verrall had at\r\nthe bottom of her mind all the classical references required.\r\nIt is true she thought she knew nothing about Philoxenus\r\nand never had known. But so did I, when I heard Mr.\r\nBalfour's paper, and yet I must have known something, and\r\nvery likely all, that was needed. I have read the Poetics, the\r\nPolitics, and Grote's History, and they all refer to Philoxenus.\r\nI think it highly probable that I had read the article in\r\nLempriere's Classical Dictionary that gives the very version of\r\nhis quarrel with Dionysius mentioned in the notes to the\r\nGreek Melic Poets, and followed in the script. I cannot\r\nbe sure but this is my reason. There are a very considerable number of allusions to Philoxenus, conjectural\r\nor certain, scattered up and down Greek literature\u2014howmany the non-classical reader may judge by consulting\r\nSmith's Dictionary of Classical Biography . Three of these occur\r\nin Aristophanes' Frogs, Clouds, and Plutus (Frogs, 1506\r\n;\r\nClouds, 332 ; Plutus, 290) . I have read all three plays\r\nwith some care, and it is the usual practice of a student\r\nin such cases to look up the names of classical authors\r\nreferred to in the text, or the notes, if otherwise unfamiliar. 1 Now I cannot doubt that Mrs. Verrall had read at\r\nleast as much as I and studied as carefully. Further,\r\nbefore the evidential scripts occurred, there was a good\r\n1 Since writing the above I see that in Rogers' edition of the Plutus (published 1904) the relevant version of the Philoxenus story is given with considerable detail in the notes, ad versum 290. It would be interesting to know if Mrs. Verrall had seen this excellent edition.\r\nlxxiv.] The Ear of Dionysius : Discussion of Evidence. 265\r\ndeal to attract her attention to the whole topic of Dionysius and his prisoners, Philoxenus included. On 26 Aug.,\r\n1910, before Dr. Verrall's death, Mrs. Willett. when sitting\r\nfor script with her, dictated the phrase \" Dionysius' Ear\r\n\r\nthe lobe.\" Mrs. Verrall did not understand the phrase\r\nand talked it over with her husband, who twitted her with\r\nher ignorance or forgetfulness. Now, is it not natural to\r\nsuppose that, after this, she looked up the subject or got\r\nDr. Verrall to tell her all he could about it ? Surely any\r\nclassical student would have done so much. And then,\r\neither in her own reading or in the course of conversation,\r\nshe might easily have come upon the story of Philoxenus,\r\nclosely connected as he is with Dionysius.\r\nMoreover, the whole story, as we have said\u2014including one express reference to Aristotle and to music, Mousike \u2014a word expressly dictated in Mrs. Willett's script\u2014is compactly given in a page of Prof. Smyth's Greek Melic\r\nPoets. Dr. Verrall had a presentation copy of this work\r\nand thought well of it. It is certainly not far-fetched to\r\nsuppose that Mrs. Verrall at some time or other had at\r\nleast glanced through the pages. The book is full of\r\ninteresting bits of information very useful for a classical\r\nteacher.1 If Mrs. Verrall had once read p. 461 of this\r\nhandy little volume she would, \"with the rest of her normal\r\nclassical knowledge, have been, at one time or other, in\r\npossession of all the facts necessary to build up the scheme\r\nof associated ideas that seemed so complicated to an\r\noutsider.\r\nThis \"odd old human story of long ago,\" as the Willett\r\nscript calls the tale of Philoxenus, is just the kind to catch\r\nan imaginative student's imagination. Indeed it is doubt1 It contains, by the way, a special reference to the Sicilian worship of Artemis and her connection with Arethusa and the Alpheus (p. 301 ). \" Sicilian Artemis,\" it may be remembered, appears in the Willett script for no apparent\r\nreason.\r\nI have since been told by my friend, Miss Matthaei of Newnham College,\r\nthat Smyth's book is the standard edition of the Greek lyric poets now in use at Cambridge, and that almost every classical student at Newnham has a copy on her shelves, no other edition having such helpful notes. Miss\r\nMatthaei said she could scarcely imagine that Mrs. Verrall had not read the\r\nbook.\r\n266 Miss F. Melian Stawell. [part\r\nless just the kind to have interested and amused Dr.\r\nVerrall himself, but then, if so, he would have been likely\r\nto mention it to other scholars, especially to his wife. It may be said in objection that it would be very strange\r\nfor Mrs. Verrall to have known this story and then forgotten it so completely. But I cannot agree. I forget too\r\nmuch myself. And it is surely at least equally strange\r\nthat the \" Ear of Dionysius \" should have conveyed nothing\r\nto her either. That is much better known, and must, I\r\nshould think, often have been matter of her conscious\r\nknowledge.\r\nI can see no real difficulty, therefore, in assuming that\r\nthe knowledge required may have been latent in Mrs.\r\nVerrall's mind and that her subconscious self could weave\r\nthe associations together, much as it might in a fairly\r\ncoherent dream.1 On this hypothesis I should proceed to\r\nexplain what happened somewhat as follows. Rapport\r\nbetween Mrs. Willett and Mrs. Verrall on the subject of\r\nthe \" Ear of Dionysius \" had already been established\r\nbefore Dr. Verrall's death. Afterwards, 10 Jan., 1914,\r\nthere appeared a fairly long piece of Willett script (script\r\nA) written in normal consciousness and sending messages\r\nto Mrs. Verrall about the Ear of Dionysius, the stone\r\nquarries, Sicily, and poetry. All the allusions, as Mr.\r\nBalfour himself points out, \" might be supposed ... to\r\nhave been at one time or other within the normal knowledge of the automatist.\" But further, all the allusions are\r\nof such a kind that they would, if seen by Mrs. Verrall\r\nand they were both seen and studied by her (19 Jan.,\r\n1914)\u2014stimulate any latent memories she might have about\r\nDionysius and Philoxenus. I assume that they did in fact so stimulate them, just enough to make them active, but\r\nsubconsciously, not consciously.\r\nOwing to this activity, about five weeks later (28 Feb.\r\n2 Mar., 1914), when Mrs. Willett sits for script with\r\nMr. Balfour (scripts B and C), the topics in question\r\nleak through, in an obscure and fragmentary fashion,\r\n1 1 note that this comparison to the modus operandi of our minds when\r\ndreaming has been made independently by Miss May Sinclair in an acute\r\nletter printed in the S.P.R. Journal (May-June, 1917).\r\nLxxrv.] The Ear of Dionysius : Discussion of Evidence. 267\r\nfrom Mrs. Verrall's mind into Mrs. Willett's. Here they\r\nfind congenial soil, for Mrs. Willett herself had already\r\nbeen thinking about the Ear of Dionysius, Sicily, poetry,\r\nDr. Verrall, Prof. Butcher, and their joint interest in\r\nclassical literature, (script A, 10 Jan., 1914, and compare\r\nher vision of Prof. Butcher and his classical message to\r\nVerrall, 21 Jan., 1911).\r\nUnconscious leakage from mind to mind is not a new\r\nhypothesis. We have good evidence for it {e.g. the leakage\r\nof the idea \" seven \" from Mr. Piddington's sealed letter : the leakage of the passage about \" moly \" in the \" one- horse-dawn \" experiment).\r\nBut, it may be said, the Willett scripts show an elaborate design in the way the facts are communicated. Can\r\nwe suppose this design was not due to conscious agency ? I answer by another question : Is the elaborate design of a kind that forces us to assume purpose ? There is certainly what might fairly be called an elaborate association of ideas, and this is reflected in the scripts, but I have\r\nshown, I think, that this association might have been in\r\nMrs. Verrall's subconscious mind. Of design in communication the evidence is much less clear. Much is made of\r\nthe fact that the allusions are given in a scholar-like form,\r\nthat they are veiled and fragmentary, and that the clue seems purposely withheld. But the scholar-like form would\r\nbe natural to Mrs. Verrall, and we know that telepathic\r\nmessages do often come through in a veiled and fragmentary form. They did when Dr. Verrall made his\r\nfamous \" one-horse dawn \" experiment, and yet the veiling\r\nwas no part of his plan. And if the clue was purposely\r\nwithheld, why was it given in the end to the very person,\r\nMrs. Verrall, from whom it ought to have been kept till\r\nall was complete ? I suggest therefore that the effect of purposive design\r\nis accidental, due to the chance that Mi's. Verrall's\r\nsubconscious mind, owing to her sight of Willett script A,\r\nwas working in Jan. -Mar., 1914, on the Dionysius-Philox- enus cycle of ideas and that Mrs. Willett's mind could\r\nat first receive fragments of them, but only fragments, as her own insistence on her difficulty in catching the ideas\r\n268 Miss F. Melian Stawell. [part\r\nindicates. I suggest also that she wove round them fancies\r\nof her own, e.g. that Mrs. Verrall was not to be told, and\r\nthat there was an important experiment on foot, etc.\r\nThen Mrs. Verrall's mind, I assume, drifted away from the\r\nsubject, and nothing further appears for a long while\r\nin the Willett scripts. But when Mrs. Verrall sits for\r\nscript with Mrs. Willett, a year and a half later, the contact of the two minds happens to revive subconsciously\r\nthe dormant memories of the Dionysius-Philoxenus story and\r\nthis time it emerges in a form that is practically complete,\r\njust as we often do find that telepathic impressions are much\r\nmore clearly received when the communicator is in the room.\r\n(It would be of great interest, by the way, to know if this\r\nwas the first time that Mrs. Verrall sat for script with Mrs.\r\nWillett since the writing of the evidential scripts B and C.)\r\nOnce more, I suggest that Mrs. Willett 's subconscious mind\r\nwove fancies of its own, but this time fancies that do not\r\ntally with the earlier ones, e.g. they now assume that Mrs.\r\nVerrall ought to have been told. Thus we have, I submit,, a hypothesis with certain merits of its own to put against\r\nthe hypothesis of Dr. Verrall communicating. I do not\r\nclaim it as more plausible. Apart from the fact that there\r\nare other reasons to doubt survival I do not think it as\r\nplausible. Both hypotheses have weak points : one involves\r\nan astonishing lapse of memory on Dr. Verrall's part,\r\nthe other a remarkable extension of unconscious leakage.\r\nAnd what I want to urge now is the imperative need\r\nboth for further observation and further experiment to\r\nhelp us to decide. I admit that I cannot conceive any\r\none experiment as decisive. The evidence, from the nature\r\nof the case, cannot, so far as I can see, ever be demonstrative : it can only be cumulative. We have no\r\ndemonstrative evidence even of the existence of individual\r\nincarnate minds other than our own. But that is all the\r\nmore reason for making as many experiments as possible.\r\nAnd with some hesitation, for I have no claim whatever to\r\nspeak as an investigator, I would ask first if more testquestions and more exploratory questions could not be put\r\nto the automatists. For instance, has any attempt been\r\nmade to find out from the automatist in trance any\r\nlxxiv.] The Ear of Dionysius : Discussion of Evidence. 269\r\nexplanation of that strange lapse of memory ? If so, with\r\nwhat result ? Test-questions were put, I believe, through\r\nMrs. Piper to the supposed communicator Myers. Could\r\nnot similar questions be put through Mrs. Willett to\r\nVerrall ? If they have been put, what has been the\r\nresult ? And further, I would urge that every possible\r\nopportunity should be taken to repeat the experiment of\r\nsealed letters. It is true, of course, as Mrs. Sidgwick\r\nsays, that these experiments are not crucial. My own paper\r\nindicates that the contents might leak from one mind to\r\nthe other while the writer was still alive. But if a large\r\nnumber were written, if, in a large proportion of cases,\r\nthe contents were not disclosed till after death and then\r\nwere disclosed, should we not all feel, in spite of loopholes\r\nfor doubt, that the positive evidence had gained enormously ? Failure in the experiment would, of course, add a certain\r\namount of weight to the negative side. But that seems\r\nto me exactly the reason for making it. If the evidence\r\nmust be cumulative, and it seems to me that it must,\r\nwe cannot test its weight unless we take full account of\r\nnegative as well as positive results.\r\nNote. Reading Mr. Balfour's most courteous and interesting answer to my paper, I notice that,\u2014entirely through my own\r\nlooseness of phrasing,\u2014I may have given the impression\r\nthat I doubt survival after death. On the contrary, I believe\r\nin survival ; what I doubt is the possibility of direct purposeful\r\ncommunication with minds still incarnate. I ought to have\r\nmade this clear and I wish to do so now, since all these\r\nmatters are important, although this special point does not\r\naffect the actual discussion between Mr. Balfour and myself.\r\n.270 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [rART\r\nin.\r\nTHE EAR OF DIONYSIUS: A REPLY.\r\nBy the Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour.\r\nBy the courtesy of the Editor of the Proceedings I have\r\nbeen allowed to see the foregoing paper by Miss Stawell\r\nin manuscript, and invited to comment upon it. I accept\r\nthe invitation all the more readily inasmuch as I was\r\nunfortunately prevented by illness from being present at\r\nthe meeting at which the paper was read.\r\nMiss Stawell's criticism of the argument for survival put\r\nforward in \" The Ear of Dionysius \" is of that serious and\r\nthoughtful kind that helps to throw light upon a problem\r\neven where one cannot agree with it. The alternative\r\nhypothesis which she suggests is not one that commends\r\nitself to my judgement. But it touches upon points of\r\nreal interest, and the care and acumen with which she\r\nhas handled the subject deserve respectful consideration.\r\nThe point of view from which Miss Stawell starts is not\r\nquite the same as that which I took up in my paper.\r\nLet me quote her own words : \" [Mr. Balfour's] argument\r\nthat the communicator was really Dr. Verrall's discarnate\r\nmind is certainly extremely cogent. But I do not feel it entirely convincing. There is a difficulty, and apart from\r\nthis another hypothesis is possible. Of course, if there\r\nwere no general reason to doubt survival after death, then\r\nthere would be less reason to trouble about another hypothesis. But there is plenty of reason for doubt because of\r\nall the negative evidence that exists, some of it collected by\r\nthe S.P.R. itself, e.g. the failure of test-questions, or the\r\ninability, shown on more than one occasion, to state the contents of a sealed envelope written before the communicator's\r\ndeath.\"\r\nAgain, after saving her own alternative explanation, Miss\r\nixxrv.] The Ear of Dionysius : A Reply. 271\r\nStawell sums up the case as follows : \" We have, I submit,\r\na, hypothesis with certain merits of its own to put against\r\nthe hypothesis of Dr. Verrall communicating. I do not claim\r\nit as more plausible. Apart from the fact that there is other reason to doubt survival, I do not think it as plausible. Both\r\nhypotheses have weak points : one involves an astonishing\r\nlapse of memory on Dr. Verrall's part, the other a remarkable extension of unconscious leakage.\"\r\nIt is evident from these passages that Miss Stawell\r\navowedly starts from the assumption that survival is antecedently improbable on general grounds, that is to say, on\r\ngrounds independent of any considerations that are to be\r\ndrawn from the facts of the particular case under review.\r\nWere it not for these external grounds of objection she would\r\nprefer my explanation to her own.\r\nNo doubt the attitude of any of us towards this or that\r\nsuggested explanation of a particular case must inevitably\r\ndepend on the presuppositions or predispositions which we\r\nbring to the study of it. Those who disbelieve in the possibility of survival will prefer any explanation to one that\r\nrests on survival. Those who disbelieve in the possibility\r\nof telepathy\u2014and they are still probably the majority among\r\nscientific men\u2014will be equally emphatic in also rejecting\r\nthe explanation offered by Miss Stawell. On the other hand,\r\nthose who on general grounds have already come to regard\r\nsurvival as probable will be prepossessed in favour of spirit\r\ncommunication as against elaborate and complicated hypotheses of subliminal agency.\r\nIn these circumstances it seems to me that in a paper professing to deal with only a single case of what purports to\r\nbe spirit communication, the proper course is to start from\r\nthe assumption that survival and spirit communication are open questions ; and this is what I tried to do. Once we\r\nbegin to weight the scales, as Miss Stawell has done, with\r\nconsiderations of a general character, it is difficult to see how there can be any logical halting place short of a\r\ndiscussion extending beyond the particular case to all the pros and cons by which our final conclusions will be\r\ndetermined. At that rate a paper would quickly swell to\r\na volume.\r\n272 The Right Han. G. W. Balfour. [PART\r\nAn obvious corollary from what has just been said is that no single case should be treated as crucial and\r\ndecisive. Here I am entirely at one with Miss Stawell,\r\nand I may add with all serious students of the subject.\r\nThe evidence must be cumulative. In the end, the hypothesis which offers the simplest explanation of all the\r\nobserved facts bearing on the question at issue will doubtless become generally accepted. But we are far from having\r\nreached that end as yet. I do not claim for the \" Dionysius\r\nCase \" more than that it is an important contribution to the\r\nevidence, and that it tells strongly in favour of survival and\r\nof the actuality of communication from \"the other side.\"\r\nMiss Stawell herself, it appears, is inclined towards a similar\r\nview, though much more doubtingly and waveringly.\r\nThis brings me to the main substance of her paper. Miss\r\nStawell finds in the facts of the case as narrated a difficulty\r\nwhich militates against the supposition that the communications really proceed from Dr. Verrall. Further, she offers\r\nan alternative explanation which, even if less plausible on\r\nthe whole, and considered by itself, than that which I have\r\nadvocated, is nevertheless regarded by her as sufficiently\r\nplausible to come into serious competition with it. Miss Stawell states her \" difficulty \" thus : \" In the two\r\nleading scripts (Feb. 28, Mar. 2, 1914, Scripts B and C) the\r\ncommunicator said that Mrs. Verrall was to hear nothing\r\nof the matter, and that there was much more to be got through.\r\nYet, abruptly, after this all communication on the topic\r\nceased, so far as Mrs. Willett was concerned, for a year and a\r\nhalf, until suddenly at a sitting where Mrs. Verrall herself\r\nwas present, the subject was re-opened, the clue given, and\r\ngreat surprise expressed that Mrs. Verrall had received no\r\nmessage on the matter. This implies a strange lapse of\r\nmemory on the part of the communicator, so strange that one is forced to ask, Can it be explained satisfactorily on\r\nthe hypothesis that there was a deliberate conscious personality controlling the communications ? I find it hard to\r\nthink so.\"\r\nThat the surprise expressed in the later scripts is inconsistent with the instructions given in the earlier ones is clear ; and undoubtedly the most natural account to be given of this\r\nlxxiv.] The Ear of Dionysius : A Reply. 273\r\ninconsistency is to ascribe it, as I have done in my paper,\r\nto a lapse of memory on the part of the communicators. Miss\r\nStawell's alternative hypothesis explains the inconsistency by\r\narbitrarily transferring the responsibility for it to the automatist herself. On this point let me note that the inconsistency requires to be not merely explained but explained\r\naway, if the incident is to lose the highly exceptional and\r\nperhaps unprecedented character which I assigned to it. What is so rare is that scripts written by the same automatist should contain statements startlingly at variance with each\r\nother. The question whether the true origin of the statements is external or subliminal is from this point of view\r\nirrelevant. It is what may be called in a non-committal\r\nphrase \" the script memory \" which in our experience is so seldom found to be seriously at fault.\r\nWhen I treated the inconsistency in the scripts as due to\r\nforgetfulness on the part of the communicators and added\r\nthat I had no explanation to offer, I meant that I had no\r\nexplanation to offer which seemed to me preferable to the\r\nassumption that a lapse of memory had taken place. But\r\nI must candidly own that when I wrote my paper I attached\r\nno particular significance to the incident, though I noted\r\nit as being very unusual. The use made of it by Miss Stawell\r\nwas entirely unforeseen by me. I still think that she has\r\ngreatly overrated her \" difficulty,\" and that such a lapse\r\nof memory after a year and a half, during which the subject\r\nwas dropped so far as communications through Mrs. Willett were concerned, is not inconsistent with the control of the\r\ncommunications by a \" deliberate conscious personality.\"\r\nBut for those who attach more importance to her objection\r\nthan I do, I venture to suggest an explanation of this discrepancy in the scripts which I think well within the bounds\r\nof possibility, though I refrained from offering it in my\r\npaper.\r\nLet us see just how the case stands. Script B tells us that\r\nMrs. Verrall is to hear nothing of the matter at present.\r\nScript C says there is much more to follow, and that until\r\nthe effort is completed the portions as they come are not\r\nto be seen by any other automatist. Script D, returning to the subject a year and a half later,\r\n274 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nasks if the Satire has been identified, and finding Mrs. Verrall\r\nunable to give a reply, expresses surprise that the messages\r\nconcerning it and references to a Cave have not been passed\r\non to her.\r\nFinally, in Script E, a fortnight later, Gurney, upon being\r\ninformed that all the classical allusions are now understood\r\nby the investigators, exclaims \" Good\u2014At last ! \"\r\nIn the long interval between C and D a complete change\r\nhas taken place in the attitude of the communicators. Can\r\nanything have occurred during this period to account for the\r\nchange ? It is certain that the expectation held out in C of further\r\ncontributions to the problem was not fulfilled in any scripts\r\nproduced by Mrs. Willett between the dates of C and D. Of\r\nthese there were about a dozen altogether. They dealt\r\nalmost exclusively with a single subject of a private nature\r\nwhich had no connection whatever with the Dionysius case,, nor with either of the two principal communicators concerned\r\nin it. It does not, however, follow from this that the Dionysius topic had been wholly lost sight of by the group on the\r\nother side. The statements in B and C do indeed strongly\r\nsuggest, if they do not directly assert, that a return to it would shortly be made in subsequent Willett scripts. But\r\nin C there is also something very like an intimation that\r\nattempts would be made to produce cross-correspondences\r\non the subject in the scripts of other automatists. That\r\nat all events is the meaning I attached at the time to the\r\ninstruction that \" until the effort is completed the portions\r\nas they come are not to be seen by any other automatist \" ;. so much so that from then onwards I began to look out very\r\ncarefully for any signs of such cross-correspondences.\r\nThe suggestion I have to make is this. For some undisclosed reason the intention to send additional matter on\r\nthe Dionysius topic through Mrs. Willett was not carried\r\nout. Possibly Gurney, who appears to take chief charge\r\nof arrangements on the other side, was unwilling to allow\r\nthe important series of scripts, occupied with a totally\r\ndifferent subject, that began shortly after the date of\r\nScript C, to be interrupted. In the meantime attempts were made to refer to the Dionysius case elsewhere. There\r\nLxxrv.] The Ear of Dionysius : A Reply. 275\r\nis good ground for believing that these attempts met with\r\nat least a partial measure of success in the scripts of\r\nMrs. King. (See Appendix to my original paper, Proc.\r\nS.P.B., Vol. XXIX., p. 239.) It is quite possible that\r\nthe communicators may have thought that they had\r\nsucceeded in \" getting through \" more than they actually\r\nhad. Uncertainty as to what has and what has not been\r\neffectively transmitted and duly recorded by automatists\r\nis frequently admitted in the scripts, and perhaps rather\r\nspecially so in Mrs. King's script. As time passed the group\r\non the other side may have thought that sufficient lights\r\nhad been given, and have assumed that the investigators\r\nhad discovered the solution of the puzzle. Had we really\r\ndiscovered it the instructions that Mrs. Verrall \"is to hear\r\nnothing of this at present \" and that \" until the effort is completed the portions as they come are not to be seen by any\r\nother automatist \" would have ceased to be applicable ; and\r\nMrs. Verrall would have been taken into our counsel and\r\nbeen shown the scripts.\r\nIf this is really what happened, the surprise expressed in\r\nD becomes intelligible. It is inconsistent with the instructions given in B and C, but would not be inconsistent with\r\nthe impressions subsequently formed by the communicators\r\nduring the long interval that followed. The exclamation\r\n\"At last ! \" used by Gurney on hearing that the classical\r\nallusions were now all understood, would also be not\r\nonly intelligible but natural, if he took the view that the\r\ninformation supplied to us before Script D was produced\r\nhad been sufficient, or ought to have been sufficient, to\r\ngive us the solution of the problem.\r\nI offer this explanation for what it may be worth. There\r\nis too much of the conjectural element in it to satisfy me.\r\nBut in any case I should prefer it to the explanation given\r\nby Miss Stawell's alternative hypothesis, in which conjecture\r\nseems to me to play at least as prominent a part.\r\nTo that alternative hypothesis I now turn. It may be\r\nsummed in three main propositions :\r\n(1) That Mrs. Verrall possessed, consciously or subconciously, all the classical knowledge implied in the scripts.\r\n(2) That after receiving the message in Script A she sub-\r\n276 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nconsciously wove together a number of topics, not for the\r\nmost part connected with one another by any obvious associations, into a coherent whole, the separate items of which,\r\nby reason of this subconscious activity, \"leaked \" from her\r\nsubconscious mind into that of Mrs. Willett and emerged in\r\nthe successive scripts, Mrs. Willett's own latent memories\r\nco-operating in the process.\r\n(3) That the collocation of the ideas thus brought together\r\nmay be said to exhibit \" design \" ; but that of \" purpose in\r\ncommunication \" as distinguished from \" design \" the scripts\r\nfurnish no sufficient evidence.\r\nThis account of the matter is ingenious and carefully thought\r\nout ; but I am unable to accept it as probable.\r\nAs regards (1), everything turns upon whether Mrs. Verrall\r\nhad at some period before the production of the evidential\r\nscripts (B, C and D) become acquainted with the story of\r\nPhiloxenus, and more especially with the veision of that\r\nstory implied in the scripts. If she had not, cadit quaestio : the alternative hypothesis falls, to the ground.\r\nMiss Stawell thinks I have dismissed too easily the possibility that the scripts had their source of inspiration in Mrs.\r\nVerrall 's subconscious mind. I admit that when stating that\r\nMrs. Verrall \" knew nothing about Philoxenus or his poem,\"\r\nI took it too much for granted that she never had knownanything. Present ignorance, however complete, cannot\r\nwholly exclude the possibility of knowledge once possessed\r\nbut since forgotten. But there are cases\u2014and this, I think,\r\nis one of them\u2014where it may go far towards doing so ; especially where there is really nothing to be set on the other\r\nside except pure conjecture. I can readily believe that at\r\nsome time or other in the course of her classical studies Mrs\r\n.\r\nVerrall had come across a mention of the poet Philoxenus\r\nand afterwards forgotten about him. But we have to suppose\r\nfar more than that in order to account for the distinctly re- condite knowledge concerning the plot of the Cyclops exhibited\r\nin the scripts. Miss Stawell 's own suggestion is that Mrs.\r\nVerrall was led to look up the associations connected with\r\nthe Ear of Dionysius by her conversation on the subject\r\nwith Dr. Verrall in 1910, and in this manner acquired the\r\nnecessary information. Conjectures of this kind are plausible\r\nLXXIV.] The Ear of Dionysius : A Reply. 277\r\nenough in themselves. But they are not easy to reconcile\r\nwith the fact that in January, 1914, the message which (according to Miss Stawell) produced such very remarkable\r\nresults in Mrs. Verrall's subconscious mind, found no\r\nappropriate response in her normal memories ; and that\r\nin August, 1915, even a study of the reference books on\r\nthe subject failed to recall to her that she had ever heard\r\nof Philoxenus. Again, Miss Stawell thinks it \" not unnatural to suppose that Mrs. Verrall at some time or other\r\nhad at least glanced through the pages of Professor\r\nSmyth's Greek Melic Poets.'' Perhaps not ; but what\r\nevidence we have is in the other direction. My strong\r\nimpression is\u2014though I cannot absolutely vouch for the\r\nfact\u2014that Mrs. Verrall told me she believed she had never\r\nlooked into the book until she had recourse to it in connection with the references in Script D ; and Mrs. Salter\r\n(Miss Helen Verrall) informs me that she is sure her mother\r\nnever had any previous occasion to use it. Unfortunately\r\nMrs. Verrall is no longer with us to appeal to on points\r\nlike this. As things are, it is perhaps hardly possible to\r\ncarry the controversy further. I can only say that my\r\npersonal opinion remains unshaken. Mrs. Verrall herself\r\nwas convinced that the Philoxenus story which contains\r\nthe key to the puzzle was entirely new to her. I continue\r\nto believe that she was right. 1\r\n(2) Coming next to Miss Stawell's account of the genesis\r\n1 Miss Stawell credits not only Mrs. Verrall, but also Mrs. Willett, with a more extensive subconscious knowledge than I should be prepared to allow\r\nprobable. The more or less of Mrs. Willett 's knowledge is in no way essential to Miss Stawell's main contention, and therefore I have not thought it worth\r\nwhile to discuss it. I must, however, take exception to the argument by\r\nwhich she supports her opinion. \" It is plain,\" she writes, \" that Mrs.\r\nWillett 's conscious mind does forget very easily. When asked by Mr. Balfour\r\n(27 May, 1916) what she knew about the ''Ear of Dionysius,'' she said she\r\nhad heard the expression but did not know the meaning of it. Yet only two\r\nyears before she had written, in her normal consciousness, script containing a fairly full account of the Ear, a script of which she had kept an annotated\r\ncopy to which, as Mr. Balfour tells us, she could refer at any time.\" Surely\r\nthere is a fallacy here. It is true that Script A contains a description of the Ear of Dionysius. But it does not describe it by name. Unless\r\nMrs. Willett already knew that the description applied to the Ear of Dionysius, she might have read and re-read Script A without ever dis- covering the fact.\r\ns\r\n278 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nof the scripts, let me begin by noting a point of detail. The\r\norder of events is supposed to be as follows : Mrs. Verrail\r\n(who is credited, as we have seen, with a complete, though\r\nlatent knowledge of all the classical references in the scripts)\r\nreceives the message contained in Script A. Her latent\r\nmemories are thereby stimulated \" just enough to make\r\nthem active, but subconsciously not consciously.\" This\r\nsubconscious activity in its turn produces a \" leakage \" of\r\nideas from Mrs. Verrail to Mrs. Willett, and is thus the true source and origin of the \" evidential scripts.\"\r\nWhat remains unexplained in this account is the origin\r\nof the message in Script A. Miss Stawell, of course, assumes\r\nthat all the topics in this message had at one time or another\r\nbeen within Mrs. Willett's normal knowledge, and might,\r\ntherefore, have emerged in her script without anj. external\r\nprompting. But even granting this, why did they emerge\r\nat all ? On Miss Stawell's hypothesis no answer to this\r\nquestion is forthcoming. On the hypothesis that Dr. Verrail\r\nwas the real as well as the ostensible communicator, the\r\nanswer is plain. Evidently the message was sent in\r\npreparation for what was to follow.\r\nThis, however, is, after all, a point of minor importance,,\r\nthough not, I think, without some interest.\r\nA much more serious objection to Miss Stawell's account\r\nof how the scripts originated is one of which she is sensible\r\nherself, though I doubt whether she has realized the full force\r\nof it. The essential basis of her explanation is \" unconscious\r\nleakage \" of ideas from mind to mind. Miss Stawell has\r\nnot told us exactly what she means by \" unconscious leakage.\"\r\nThe term may signify much or little. If A represents the\r\nmind from which, and B the mind to which the leakage is assumed to take place, are both A and B to be regarded as unconscious of what is happening, or only A ? And further,\r\nwhen we speak of A, do we mean supraliminal A only, or subliminal A also, and similarly of B ? I am not quite\r\nsure, but I think Miss Stawell uses the term in its widest\r\nsignificance, which excludes any kind of awareness or intention either on the one side or the other, and either\r\nsupraliminal or subliminal. In other words the whole process\r\nis to be taken as involuntary and automatic. It is in this.\r\nlxxiv.] The Ear of Dionysius : A Reply. 279\r\nsense that the term is to be understood in the discussion\r\nwhich follows.\r\nMiss Stawell tells us that unconscious leakage is not a new\r\nhypothesis, and that we have good evidence of it. Certainly\r\nit is not a new hypothesis ; on the other hand, the actual\r\nevidence in support of it is singularly scanty. The reason\r\nof this may be, at least in part, that such evidence is, from\r\nthe nature of the case, difficult to obtain. But it may also\r\nbe owing to the rarity of the phenomenon itself. Two supposed examples are cited by Miss Stawell\u2014the case\r\nof Mr. Piddington's sealed letter, and the leakage of the passage\r\nabout \" moly \" in the \" one-horse dawn \" experiment. Neither\r\nof these can be regarded as conclusive, even if we ignore the\r\npossibility of chance-coincidence. The incident of Mr. Piddington's letter forms part of a complicated cross-correspondence. Miss Johnson, to whom we owe a careful review of\r\nall the circumstances (see Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXIV., pp. 222 ff.), finds in them strong evidence of a single external directing\r\nintelligence ; and though she thinks that this intelligence\r\nmay have utilised telepathic communication between the\r\nautomatists concerned and Mr. Piddington, it is obvious\r\nthat the introduction on the stage of such a dens ex machina, while not negativing the hypothesis of unconscious\r\nleakage, does render it superfluous.\r\nAs to the passage about \" the herb moly \" in the \" one-horse\r\ndawn \" experiment, it is true that the appearance of it in\r\nMrs. Verrall's script could not be directly due to any conscious mental activity on Dr. Verrall's part. But we know\r\nthat he was trying to transmit certain words to Mrs. Verrall,\r\nand we cannot be sure that this conscious effort on his part was\r\nnot a conditio sine qua non of the transmission of certain other\r\nwords of the connection of which with the subject of the experiment he was only subconsciously aware. For a fuller discussion of this question, perhaps I may refer to an article of\r\nmine published in Proc, Vol. XXV., in which I pointed out\r\nthat no proof of purely subconscious telepathy can ever be\r\nobtained from experiments. All experiments necessarily start\r\nfrom supraliminal activity ; and having once started from\r\nsupraliminal activity it is impossible to be certain that one\r\nis justified in eliminating it from results.\r\n280 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nIf proof is to be obtained of unconscious leakage it is among\r\ncases of spontaneous (i.e. non-experimental) telepathy that\r\nwe must look for it. Veridical phantasms of the living that\r\nhave appeared to persons unknown to the presumed agent,\r\ncollective hallucinations, and the psychological characteristics of crowds, will perhaps be found to afford the best\r\nexamples\u2014in other words, cases where nothing more complex is in question than sensory impressions or emotional\r\nstates.\r\nWhether even single mental concepts are ever transmitted\r\nby unconscious leakage is doubtful. What we have in the\r\nDionysius case is a series of mental concepts, apparently\r\nunconnected, or only loosely connected, but ultimately found\r\nto be cunningly linked together by a central idea that unites\r\nall the rest into a single whole. The transmission of a combined scheme of concepts in the way suggested has, I feel\r\nconfident, no soit of warrant from experience. Miss Stawell\r\nmay well call such an extension of unconscious leakage\r\n\" remarkable.\"\r\nCan we say that the hypothesis, even though unwarranted\r\nby experience, is nevertheless intrinsically plausible ? I do\r\nnot think so. Unconscious leakage must from the nature\r\nof the case be in large measure at the mercy of chance. It\r\nwould be unreasonable to expect from it the unity and coher- ence that might be looked for in a message deliberately sent\r\nby an intelligent communicator. Yet it is just such unity\r\nand coherence which are exceptionally manifest in these\r\nWillett scripts. What we see in them is not chance but\r\ndesign. Moreover, they show a noticeable absence of anything like surplusage or extraneous matter. There is hardly\r\nan idea to be found in them that does not contribute to the\r\nbuilding up of the scheme as a whole. Even granting for a moment that the design itself originated in Mrs. Verrall's\r\nsubconscious mind, how can mere leakage account for the fact\r\nthat practically no ideas emerged in the scripts except such\r\nas were relevant to the design ? It seems to me that this is a real difficulty, and that neither the rapport which may\r\nfairly be taken to have existed between Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.\r\nWillett, nor any aid which the dormant memories of the\r\nlatter may be supposed to have rendered, suffice to meet it.\r\nLXXIV.] The Ear of Dionysius : A Reply. 281\r\nIndeed I see no way of meeting it fully except to suppose\r\nthat Mrs. Verrall's subconscious mind was at the time occupied\r\nwith these ideas and with no others. If the leakage occurred\r\ncontemporaneously with the emergence of the ideas in the\r\nscripts of Feb. 28 and March 2 (Scripts B and C), the coincidence must be ascribed to a happy accident. If it extended\r\nover a period antecedent to the emergence, are we to suppose\r\nthat Mrs. Verrall's subliminal concentration on the Ear of\r\nDionysius extended over the whole of the period ? This is possible, but is it also plausible ? Other difficulties suggest themselves which I can only\r\nbriefly indicate. Mrs. Willett's automatic productions are incomparably more striking than Mrs. Verrall's, and the\r\nDionysius case is among the most striking of all. Yet we\r\nare asked to suppose that the true source both of materials\r\nand of plan in this case was Mrs. Verrall's subconscious\r\nmind, whence they leaked into that of Mrs. Willett. If so, how comes it that nothing remotely similar to these scripts\r\nappeared in Mrs. Verrall's own automatic writings 1 And\r\nagain, if the influence of Mrs. Verrall's subliminal mind on\r\nMrs. Willett's scripts is so powerful as the hypothesis\r\nimplies, how comes it that that influence has not left a more conspicuous impress on the Willett scripts\r\ngenerally ? Perhaps the Statius case may be cited\r\nin reply to this question. I agree that the Statius case and the Dionysius case must stand or fall together, and that to explain the one is almost certainly\r\nto explain the other also. But they foim only a small\r\nfraction of the total volume of Willett scripts. It is true that cross -correspondences occur from time to time\r\nbetween Mrs. Verrall's scripts and Mis. Willett's, and\r\nmay, from Miss Stawell's standpoint, be held to indicate\r\ntelepathic leakage from one writer to the other. None\r\nof these cro^s-correspondences, however, are at all on\r\nthe scale of leakage required to explain the Dionysius\r\ncase ; nor do they, so far as I can judge, markedly\r\nsurpass either in number or quality the cross-corre- spondences to be found between Mis. Willett's scripts\r\nand those of other members of our group of automatists.\r\nConsiderations like this cannot, of course, be properly\r\n282 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [PART\r\nappreciated without a full knowledge of all the scripts. I\r\nwill not dwell on them further, but will pass on to the\r\nlast of the three propositions which summarize Miss\r\nStawell's alternative hypothesis.\r\nMiss Stawell draws a sharp distinction between \"design\"\r\nand \" purpose in communication.\" \" Design,\" in the sense\r\nof \" an elaborate association of ideas,\" she admits and\r\nascribes to Mrs. Verrall's subconscious mind. \" Purpose in\r\ncommunication \" she disputes, and the appearance of it she\r\nascribes to the subconscious mind of the automatist.\r\nThe distinction between design and purpose, and the\r\nseparation of roles between Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Willett,\r\nwere inevitably forced on Miss Stawell by the premises\r\nfrom which she starts. She rejects\u2014I believe quite rightly \u2014the supposition that Mrs. Willett had ever known\r\nthe story of Philoxenus. It follows that Mrs. Willett\r\ncould not have originated the \"design.\" The hypothesis\r\nof spirit communication being excluded, responsibility for\r\nthe design is fixed upon Mrs. Verrall. But Miss Stawell\r\ninsists that the associated ideas passed from Mrs. Verrall\r\nto Mrs. Willett by \" unconscious leakage.\" Now, unconscious leakage is clearly incompatible with \" purpose in\r\ncommunication.\" In fact it is the very opposite of it. Hence any appearance of purpose must either be explained\r\naway as illusory, or it is upon Mrs. Willett that the responsibility for it must be thrown.\r\nTo my mind this treatment of the matter is forced and\r\nunnatural. I look upon the \" elaborate association of\r\nideas \" (or, as I should prefer to describe it, the skilful\r\nconstruction of a problem) as forming part and parcel of\r\nthe manifestation of purpose in the scripts, and as practically inseparable from it. Miss Stawell herself seems\r\ntacitly to admit the closeness of the relation between the\r\ntwo. For she allows that \" the way in which the facts are communicated \" might be evidence of purpose. In\r\nparticular she mentions the withholding of the clue all through Scripts B and C, and its final revelation in D.\r\nIs not this the very attitude of one who propounds a\r\nriddle, and deliberately waits before producing the answer\r\nto it ? And, on the other hand, if the materials of\r\nlxxiv.] The Ear of Dionysius : A Reply. 283\r\nthe problem found their way into the scripts through\r\nthe operation of unconscious leakage, should we not\r\nexpect the central and dominating idea of the combination to leak out early instead of late in the history\r\nof the case ? Miss Stawell, however, has her counterquestion read3;'. \"If,\" she asks, \"the clue was purposely\r\nwithheld, why was it given in the end to the very\r\nperson, Mrs. Verrall, from whom it ought to have been\r\nkept till all was complete ? \" The argument in support of purposiveness is not really\r\nmet by raising a difficulty on the other side, even if that\r\ndifficulty was a formidable one. But is it so formidable ? Surely there may have been good reasons in February and\r\nMarch, 1914, for asking that the scripts should be kept\r\nfrom Mrs. Verrall \" for the present,\" and yet those reasons might have lost their weight a year and a half later. My\r\nown view is that the communicators had forgotten that\r\nthe injunction had ever been laid. But whether they had\r\nforgotten this or not, they may well have thought that, the\r\ninvestigators having failed to solve the problem, the time\r\nhad now come to bring matters to a conclusion by supplying the key to the enigma themselves. The analogy of\r\nthe Statius case deserves to be considered in this connection. 1 Evidence of purpose is, however, by no means confined\r\nto that indirectly furnished by the construction of the\r\nproblem and the manner of its presentment, but is to be\r\nfound scattered in plenty throughout the scripts.\r\nThe communicators tell us they are trying \" an experiment \" ; it is \" something good and worth doing,\" which\r\ntakes the form of \"a literary association of ideas pointing\r\nto the influence of two discarnate minds.\" The \" Aristotelian \" and the \" Rationalist \" (S.H.B. and A.W.V) are described as being engaged in \"a particular task,\" an\r\n\" effort \" which still awaits completion. \" The incident,\"\r\nwe are informed, \" was chosen as being evidential of\r\nidentity \" ; and it is claimed that the combination is characteristic of its authors\u2014that it is \" A.W.ish \" and\r\n\"S.H.ish.\"\r\n1 See note at the end of this paper.\r\n284 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\r\nStatements like these plainly imply purpose. How does\r\nMiss Stawell deal with them ? By the simple expedient\r\nof sweeping them aside as \" fancies \" woven by Mrs.\r\nWillett round the ideas received by her from Mrs. Verrall.\r\nWe unfortunately possess no general criterion by which\r\ngenuine messages ab extra can be distinguished from the\r\nimaginations and embroideries of the automatist. I am,\r\ntherefore, far from asserting that the peculiar distribution\r\nof subconscious activities assumed by Miss Stawell is inadmissible. But this, I think, may fairly be said ; that\r\nso far from affording support to her alternative hypothesis\r\nit is an additional difficulty in the way of that hypothesis\r\nbeing accepted.\r\nWhy Miss Stawell should be so wedded to the idea of \" unconscious leakage \" I own I do not fully understand.\r\nIf I were seeking some way of escape from the hypothesis\r\nof spirit communication, and was willing to believe that\r\nMrs. Verrall, possessing, though partly in the form of\r\nlatent memories, all the raw material required, had evolved\r\nout of them the complicated design presented in the scripts,\r\nI shoidd see no advantage in trying to discredit the clear\r\nevidence of purpose which those same scripts exhibit. On\r\nthe contrary, I should be inclined to ascribe both design\r\nand purpose to the same source, namely Mrs. Verrall's\r\nsubconscious mind. The difficulties which this explanation\r\nof the case involves are serious enough, no doubt. That\r\nthe subconscious mind of a living person, herself an automatist, should elaborate such a puzzle and communicate it telepathically to another automatist in order to manufacture fictitious evidence for survival, the normal self of\r\nthe communicator remaining the while entirely innocent\r\nof what was taking place, is a hypothesis with as little support from experience as the \" unconscious leakage \"\r\nwhich finds favour with Miss Stawell. But at least it avoids some of the objections to which I cannot but hold\r\nthe latter to be open ; and among them the artificial\r\nseparation of the construction of the puzzle from the use\r\nto which it is put.\r\nLet me in conclusion repeat once more that though I\r\nam unable to agree with Miss Stawell, I nevertheless regard\r\nlxxiv.] The Ear of Dionysius : A Reply. 285\r\nher paper as a valuable contribution to the study of the\r\nsubject. It raises questions which ought to be raised ; and\r\nI frankly admit that she has directed the lance of her\r\ncriticism against what is probably the least protected point\r\nin the armour of her adversary. May I on my side hope\r\nthat the considerations I have urged in reply will go at\r\nleast some way towards reconciling her to a view of the\r\ncase which already, as it would seem, she only halfheartedly opposes ?\r\nNote on the Analogies between the Statitjs\r\nCase and the Dionysius Case.\r\nIn my original paper I called attention to certain features\r\nwhich were common to the Dionysius case and to the Statius case which preceded it. Both present a literary problem the solution of which\r\nappears to be purposely withheld at first, and is finally revealed\r\nonly after the lapse of a considerable interval of time.\r\nIn both the part of principal communicator is assigned to\r\nDr. Verrall, though in the Dionysius case he is associated\r\nwith his friend S. H. Butcher.\r\nBoth purport to furnish evidence of the continued existence\r\nafter death of their presumptive author or authors.\r\nA careful comparison of the two cases shews that there\r\nare other points of resemblance, as well as some points of\r\ndifference, which it may be worth while to note.\r\nThe two cases are similar in that :\r\n(1) Both open with a message to Mrs. Verrall.\r\n(2) In both the final clue is given in Mrs1\r\n. Verrall's presence.\r\n(3) In both the sitting at which Mrs. Verrall was present was her only sitting with Mrs. Willett during the\r\nperiods covered by the two sets of scripts respectively.\r\n(4) In both the interval of silence, during which the\r\nsubject appeared to be ignored, was occupied with\r\nscripts relating to matters of a private nature.\r\nThe cases differ in that\r\n:\r\n(1) The Statius case is started in a trance-script, but\r\ndeveloped and concluded in three scripts written\r\n286 The Right Hon,. G. W. Balfour. [PART\r\nin a state of normal consciousness ; whereas the\r\nDionysius case is started in a script produced in a normal state, but developed and concluded in\r\nthree trance-scripts.\r\n(2) The interval of silence occurred in the Statius case between the first and second scripts, in the Dionysius\r\ncase between the third and fourth. In the Statius case the sitter present when the subject was resumed was myself, in the Dionysius case Mrs. Verrall.\r\nWhile I think these points of similarity and difference\r\nmay be worth noting, and, in some instances, not without\r\ninterest as bearing on the present controversy, it does not\r\nappear to me that any important argument can be drawn\r\nfrom them in support of either one side or the other. Miss\r\nStawell asks whether Mrs. Verrall had any sitting with Mrs.\r\nWillett during the interval between scripts C and D. The\r\nanswer, as may be gathered from the above statement, is in the negative. In fact up to the date of script D Mrs.\r\nVerrall had not sat with Mrs. Willett since Sept. 8, 1913,\r\nthe date on which the final clue to the Statius problem was\r\ngiven. I cannot see, however, that this circumstance is in\r\nany way inconsistent with Dr. Verrall's being the real communicator ; while, on the other hand, the fact that in the\r\nStatius case the return to the subject occurred in two scripts\r\nproduced not in Mrs. Verrall's presence but with myself as\r\nsitter, tells, so far as it goes, against the supposition that in\r\nthe Dionysius case the resumption of the subject was dependent\r\nupon Mrs. Verrall's attention being once more directed to it.\r\n1XXIV.] Presidential Address. 287\r\nIV.\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.\r\nDelivered on June 28, 1917.\r\nBy L. P. Jacks, LL.D.\r\nTHE THEORY OF SURVIVAL IN THE LIGHT OF ITS\r\nCONTEXT.\r\nWe are working in a region densely populated with the\r\nhopes and fears of men ; and not only with hopes and\r\nfears but with superstitions, obsessions, preconceptions and\r\nfixed ideas innumerable. These things swarm round the\r\nincpiirer like the evil spirits which beset the path of Bunyan's Pilgrim when he passed through the Valley of\r\nHumiliation. They threaten at every turn to drive us off\r\nfrom the strait and narrow road of strict scientific inquiry ; they are immensely active ; and nowhere are they more\r\nactive than in the criticisms and the occasional contempt\r\nwhich are poured upon the work of this Society by those\r\nwho hold aloof from it. My plea is that we should turn\r\nour back upon them all ; upon the hopes and fears and\r\nall the other emotional interests that are at stake as well\r\nas upon the superstitions and fixed ideas. That is easy\r\nto say but difficult to carry out. It requires an almost\r\nfanatical wariness.\r\nAll these forces may be seen at work in the charge\r\nwhich is frequently made about the triviality and unimportance of the evidence which the Society is investigating. \" Your evidence,\" it is said, \" is nothing but a mass of trumpery information about pocket-knives and\r\nhat-pins and photographs and obscure passages in Greek\r\npoets. There is nothing to lift the veil which hangs over\r\n288 L. P. Jacks, LL.D. [PART\r\nthe mysteries of life ; nothing which helps us in the re- construction of society ; nothing that throws light on any\r\nproblem of morals or philosophy ; nothing that is of the\r\nleast importance, but always this rigmarole of trivialities.\"\r\nSuch is the charge ; and I venture to say it betrays a complete misunderstanding of the business in which we\r\nare engaged. Strictly speaking we have nothing to do\r\nwith the problems of morals and religion, save in the sense that everything in this world is connected with everything\r\nelse. We are under no obligation to provide anybody with a key to the mysteries of life. We are trying to find out\r\nthe meaning of certain obscure and challenging phenomena ; we are trying in the first instance to get these\r\nphenomena correctly reported, instead of getting them\r\ncoloured and distorted by our desire to believe in the\r\nimmortality of the soul, or in anything else of equal\r\nimportance. For this purpose a lost hat-pin may be as\r\nsignificant to us as the falling apple was to Newton ; while on the other hand what is most important to the\r\nphilosopher, such as a key to the mysteries of life sent\r\ndown from another world, is precisely the kind of evidence that would help us least, and would be open to\r\nthe gravest suspicion even if we got it. The main problem now before the Society is one of\r\nidentification. This problem has two forms, which I will\r\ndistinguish as the more and the less popular. The more\r\npopular relates to the communications which come through\r\nmediums. These plainly come from somebody, and the\r\nquestion is, can we identify these \" somebodies \" with the\r\npersons whose names they assume, persons who were once among the living. The less popular form relates to the\r\nphenomena of dreams. This, though far the less sensational of the two, is at least equally important, and may\r\nconceivably, when it has been more profoundly studied,\r\ngive us the key to the other. Here, too, the problem is one of identification. In dreams we apparently encounter\r\nourselves, as well as other people, in unwonted surroundings, and the question arises whether the self dreamt about\r\ncan really be identified with the dreamer. This question,\r\nwhich is immensely entangled, I shall leave aside and\r\nLXXIV.] Presidential Address. 289\r\nconfine myself to the problem of identification in its more popular form.\r\nAmong the clangers and the difficulties of psychical\r\nresearch, not the least are those which arise from the use\r\nof the common words \" spirit,\" \" spiritual,\" and \" spiritualism \" ; and the suggestion I have to make is, that as a temporary measure we should be well advised to drop these\r\nwords from our working vocabulary and pursue our investigations for the time being as though they did not exist.\r\nEveryone who has thought out the problem of proving\r\nthe identity of those who are alleged to communicate from\r\nbeyond the grave must have experienced both the danger\r\nand the difficulty that lurk in these words. To prove\r\nidentity, to prove that the person who was here and the\r\nperson who is there are really one and the same, you\r\nwant as much resemblance and as much continuity as\r\npossible. Difference and discontinuity, on the other hand,\r\nare always obstacles to identification. But what greater\r\ndifference, what wider breach, could be conceived than\r\nthat between an embodied and a disembodied being\r\n\r\nbetween a man and a ghost ? No two beings that I can\r\nthink of could be more unlike one another than myself in\r\nmy body and myself out of my body. What it may be\r\nto see without an eye, to speak without a tongue, to\r\nthink without a brain, or to move about without limbs\r\nI find myself wholly unable to conceive. I cannot deny\r\nthat such things are possible ; but I am certain that\r\nthey are very different from seeing witn an eye, speaking\r\nwith a tongue, thinking with a brain, and moving about\r\nwith the aid of my bodily limbs. The difference is so great\r\nand the discontinuity so startling that I cannot recognise\r\nmyself under those conditions as one with the person T now am, nor do I understand how anybody else could\r\npossibly identify me.\r\nWe are apt to thrust this difficulty aside by saying that\r\nthe true self of a man consists of his moral characteristics,\r\nand, if these are found in existence after death, then, body\r\nor no body, you have the real essential man. That I do\r\nnot question as an abstract proposition. It is a profound\r\ntruth of moral philosophy ; but it has no relevance to the\r\n290 L. P. Jacks, LL.D. [part\r\nbusiness of psychical research. Moral characteristics are of\r\nthe highest importance ; but they are not easy to distinguish, they are elusive and difficult to define, and are of\r\nlittle use as identification marks. I imagine that a man\r\nwould have some difficulty in picking out his wife from\r\na crowd of ten thousand women if he had nothing but\r\nher moral characteristics to go by, however admirable\r\nthese might be. The sound of her voice or the colour\r\nof her dress would be much more to the purpose. Nor\r\nwould it be easy to get one's passport vise in a foreign\r\ncity, or to persuade an American banker to cash one's\r\nletter of credit, if our moral characteristics were all we\r\ncould adduce to prove our identity. Now, the problem\r\nwhich the theory of survival has to solve is closely\r\nanalogous to that of a man looking for his wife in an\r\nenormous crowd, or to that of the American banker who\r\nhas to satisfy himself that his would-be client is really\r\nthe person he professes to be. Moral characteristics will\r\nnot suffice unless they are backed up by evidence in\r\ndetail, of which the most trivial may be the most important. Speaking for myself, I am by no means sure what\r\nmy moral characteristics really are ; if called upon to\r\nenumerate them I should certainly fail, not from modesty,\r\nnor, I hope, from vanity, but from sheer ignorance ; nor\r\nwould I trust their enumeration by another person. I\r\nwould much rather be asked for my weight or my height.\r\nOn the whole I am inclined to think that my moral\r\ncharacteristics are of such a kind that there must be\r\nmillions of men in the world for any one of whom I\r\nmight readily be mistaken if there was nothing else to\r\ngo by.\r\nBut now I venture to say that as scientific investigators\r\nwe have no right, and we have certainly no need, to start our inquiries from the common distinction between \" bodies ' J\r\nwhose characteristics are all physical and \" spirits \" whose\r\ncharacteristics are all moral ; and if we assume that right\r\nfrom the outset, we shall pay the penalty of endless confusion which properly falls to those who beg the question\r\nat issue. The distinction between body and spirit belongs\r\nto a metaphysical theory which has filtered down into\r\nLXXIV.] Presidential Address. 291\r\npopular thought and got itself fixed in popular phraseology.\r\nIt may be a sound theory\u2014I do not question that ; but\r\nit is a theory all the same, and must not be allowed for a moment to prejudice the minds of those who are inquiring into matters of fact. Our business and duty\r\nis to be guided solely by the evidence before us ; not to\r\nassume that the beings with whom we are in contact are\r\nthis or that, but precisely to find out from the evidence\r\nwhat they are. By jumping to the conclusion that they\r\nare disembodied spirits we not only saddle ourselves with\r\na tremendous difficulty, which makes the problem of\r\nidentification next to impossible, but we are interpreting\r\nfacts ahead of the evidence, or imposing a theory on the\r\nfacts\u2014the most serious of all scientific errors.\r\nIf I am saying something which is not clear, let my\r\nhearer ask himself the plain question, How does he know\r\nthat these beings are disembodied spirits ? He may answer,\r\nThey must be disembodied, because they left their bodies\r\nbehind them. But that is begging the question, for the\r\nvery point at issue is to prove that they are the people\r\nwho left their bodies behind. Or he may say, \" I know\r\nthey are spirits, because there is nothing else they can\r\nbe.\" That is metaphysics. In this way psychical research,\r\nwhich is research into the nature of the soul, begins with\r\na metaphysical theory as to the nature of the soul, thereby\r\nforeclosing the most important part of the inquiry. It\r\nbehoves the psychical investigator of all men to be perfectly open-minded, and especially to be open-minded to\r\nthe question as to what kind of beings they are who\r\nappear to be communicating with him. They may be\r\ndisembodied spirits ; but if they are, it is for them to\r\nprove themselves so, and not for him to assume it. If\r\nhe assumes it rashly, he may find that he has misinterpreted the whole body of evidence before him.\r\nAnother preconception, closely connected with that of\r\ndisembodied spirits, and deeply entangled with the whole\r\ndiscussion, is the idea of two worlds, which we distinguish\r\nas \"this world\" and \"the next.\" This distinction is otherwise expressed by the words \" departure \" and \" survival.\" We speak of the dead as the departed ; which\r\n292 L. P. Jacks. LL.D. [PART\r\nmeans that they have left this world ; and when evidence\r\narrives which suggests that they are still in existence, we\r\nassume that they have arrived in another. Now all this\r\nmay be true. On the other hand, it is conceivably false.\r\nTo prove that the dead survive it is not necessary to\r\nassume that they are in another Avorld. They may sur- vive in this world. They may even remain organic\r\nmembers of the human race. Like the notion of disembodied spirit, the idea of the two worlds is one we\r\nhave inherited from other sources ; and again our duty\r\nis not to accept it as a key to the evidence, but to bring\r\nit to the test of the evidence itself. Here also we need\r\nto be quite open-minded. We may find\u2014I do not say\r\npositively that we shall\u2014that the upshot of psychical\r\nresearch is not to give us another world, supplementary\r\nor successive to this one, or of another nature than this,\r\nbut to extend the boundaries and deepen the significance\r\nof the one world in which we and the so-called \" departed \"\r\nare all living together under a unitary system of Jaw.\r\nAt all events, let the matter be decided by the evidence,\r\nand not by our preconceptions of what the evidence\r\nought to mean. For my part I should be glad to hear\r\nno more about \" the other side,\" unless it be used as a metaphor or as a concession to the poverty of language,\r\nthough even so I think it confusing and dangerous. If\r\nyou take it for granted that communications must come\r\nfrom another world, or from \" another side,\" you will find\r\nyourself at every step putting meanings into the evidence\r\nthat it does not actually bear ; you will read it in the\r\nlight of a theory formed in advance, which theory, if the\r\nevidence were impartially taken, might be found untenable.\r\nIndeed, our minds are so deeply entangled in metaphysics, there is so much unconscious metaphysics in\r\ncurrent language, especially in the distinction between two\r\nworlds, this and the next, that the greatest care is needed\r\nto prevent ourselves falling into a trap. We are often\r\ncaught unawares, and find ourselves reporting as evidence\r\nwhat is not really evidence, but something which we have\r\nalready twisted and forced into the mould of one or other\r\nof these unconscious theories. Even in so simple a matter\r\nLXXIV.] Presidential Address. 293\r\nas reporting a dream, unless we are exceptionally alert we\r\nfall into the trap at every turn. We say, \"I dreamt that\r\nI did so and so \"\r\n; and in so saying we beg the most\r\nimportant question at issue. For the main problem which\r\nthe student of dreams has to solve is precisely a problem\r\nof identity ; he has to determine whether the dreamer and\r\nthe person dreamed about are really one and the same\r\n;\r\nwhich question you Avill observe he settles in advance by\r\nsaying, \" \/ dreamt that \/ did so and so.\" Here again the\r\nnotion of two worlds dogs the inquiry at every step. We\r\nspeak of \"the world of dreams\" and \"the world of\r\nwaking realities,\" and we think of ourselves as passing\r\nfiom the one to the other during sleep, just as we do in\r\nthe parallel case of death, and we begin to construct\r\nhypothetical bridges which may link the two worlds\r\ntogether. In all this we are simply suffering ourselves to\r\nbe bound hand and foot by popular metaphysics. Instead\r\nof taking the two worlds for granted and assuming\r\na \" passage \" from one to the other, whether in sleep or in death, we ought rather to consult the evidence on\r\nthis very point. Perhaps we should then find that the\r\nnotion of two worlds, or even two sides to the one world, is entirely without warrant, and that no passage takes place\r\nat all. We might find something more surprising still ; namely, that the number of worlds is much greater than\r\ntwo, and may possibly extend into millions. In any case the number two is nothing but an obsession, and as such\r\nhas no right to intrude itself for a moment into inquiries\r\nwhich profess to start without prejudice.\r\nThese warnings are not new. Long ago they were\r\nuttered by William James and Professor Bergson, my\r\ngreat predecessors in the position I occupy to-day. Both\r\nthese thinkers have pointed out the confusion which has\r\nbefallen the whole science of psychology through the pre- sence of subconscious theories formed in advance of the\r\nfacts to be examined. Perhaps the most valuable part of\r\nProfessor Bergson's work is the exposure he has given us\r\nof the havoc wrought by this habit. Take, for example,\r\nthe fundamental question of the relation between the\r\nmind and the body. When this question is raised we\r\n294 L. P. Jacks, LL.D. [part\r\nimmediately take it for granted that we are dealing with\r\ntwo distinct orders of fact, the material and the mental ; just as in psychical research we assume the distinction\r\nbetween embodied and disembodied spirits, or between two\r\nworlds, this and the next. That, we think, is the commonsense view of the matter. What can be more obvious\r\nthan the truth that the mind is one thing, and the body\r\nanother ? Taking that as our starting-point, all our subsequent thinking has to follow suit and uphold the distinction with which we have started out. But Bergson\r\nhas shown us that the notion of mind being one thing\r\nand body another is not commonsense at all, and by no\r\nmeans obvious. It is a highly elaborated metaphysical\r\ndoctrine, with a long history behind it, which has got\r\nitself so deeply entrenched in current thought and speech\r\nthat we have come to treat it as self-evident and imagined\r\nthat nothing else is possible. To take it for granted is, once again, to beg the question at issue. Our business\r\nas psychologists is not to assume that mind and body are two things, but precisely to find out whether they are so or not. They may be so ; but that is a matter for the\r\nevidence to decide. Let the evidence therefore decide it. Let this and every other theory be dismissed from the\r\nmind. Get, if you can, at the immediate data of consciousness ; that is, get at the evidence before it has been\r\nwarped and twisted by subconscious metaphysical theories.\r\nSuch is the important plea of Professor Bergson in regard\r\nto psychology in general. It is not easy to act upon,\r\nbecause very few of us are aware of the extent to which\r\nour minds are unconsciously pledged to these notions. It requires long training to detect the intruders ; and even\r\nwhen they have been detected in one form they often\r\nassume another, as a well-known personage is said to do in\r\nthe moral world, reappearing at points where we are off our guard.\r\nBut since the work of psychical research is relatively\r\nnew, it ought to be easier to rid our minds of these preconceptions than it is in the older branches of psychology,\r\nwhere the force of habit is more deeply entrenched. What\r\nwe have to do is to seek for the immediate data : that is,\r\nLXXIV.] Presidential Address. 295\r\nto take the evidence as it occurs, before it has been\r\ntranslated by some reporter into the terms of a theory\r\nabout disembodied spirits, or about another world, or about\r\nanything else.\r\nI freely confess that in what I am about to say I shall\r\nnot be able to do this thoroughly and consistently. To\r\ndo it thoroughly one would have to be at the very source\r\nof the phenomena : that is, in the position of an actual\r\nobserver at the moment when a cross -correspondence, or some other manifestation, is taking place. Standing at one remove from the evidence, I cannot do this, for I have\r\nto take it in the form in which it has been reported, and\r\nit is almost impossible to get any report which has not\r\nundergone some process of translation in the mind of the\r\nreporter. The best I can do is to tap the evidence as high up as I can reach it. I propose, then, to take it at the point where some\r\nperson of known credibility comes forward with the statement that he has received what is called a communication,\r\nbut before any theory has been formed as to where the\r\ncommunication comes from or as to the kind of being\r\nwho is communicating. Such evidence can be found in\r\nplenty by anybody who will look for it in the records of\r\nthis Society\u2014especially in the carefully sifted records of\r\nthe cross-correspondences. I well know that even in this\r\nI am giving something more than the immediate data\r\n\r\nthe word \" communications \" shows that ; but it is the\r\nnearest approach to immediacy which the circumstances\r\nafford me.\r\nWe will assume, then, that communications, genuine\r\ncommunications, are taking place ; and, dismissing from\r\nour minds the notion that they are coming from disembodied spirits or from another world, we will let the\r\ncommunications themselves tell us where they are coming\r\nfrom, and what kind of beings they are who are making\r\nthem. Especially will we be on our guard against letting\r\nthe words \" spiritual,\" or \" supernatural,\" or \" supernormal \" intrude themselves on our observation. These\r\nwords imply that we have already made up our minds\r\nas to what the communications mean, which is the very\r\n296 L. P. Jacks, LL.D. [PART\r\nthing we want to find out. We will not use these\r\nadjectives unless the evidence itself convinces that they\r\nand no other are the adjectives we ought to use. These\r\nprecautions taken, we shall find that certain facts now\r\nstart into prominence which escaped us altogether while\r\nwe were under the malign influence of our preconceptions ; while others which we previously thought unimportant\r\nbecome very important indeed.\r\nTo begin with, these communicating beings, wherever\r\nthey are, and whoever they may be, quite obviously retain\r\nthe distinction of sex. They make use of the personal\r\npronouns masculine and feminine ; they speak of one\r\nanother as \" he \" and \" she \" ; and they employ the\r\ndistinction with no discernible difference of meaning from\r\nthat with which we are all familiar. This suggests at once that the communicating beings stand with ourselves\r\non a common biological ground ; and since biological\r\nfacts, like all other facts, are not isolated, but form part\r\nof a context in which the whole order of nature is involved, we could from this one fact alone build out a whole system to correspond, just as the palaeontologist\r\nwhen he discovers the bone of an extinct animal can\r\nreconstruct the whole animal to which it belonged. This,\r\nI say, we could do ; and the only thing that has prevented us doing it hitherto is the notion that everything\r\nwe are going to discover must bear a \" spiritual \" sense,\r\nmust mean something other than it would mean if it occurred in the known order\u2014that is, may mean anything we choose to make it mean. Dismissing that notion,\r\nwe find ourselves in the presence of a fact enormously\r\nrich in implications. These beings retain the distinction of\r\nsex.Next, and almost equally striking, is their use of language, both in the spoken and the written form. They\r\nuse it for addressing one another and for addressing us through the medium, and they express by it ideas which\r\nare intelligible to human beings. Moreover, the language\r\nspoken is plain English, or plain French, as the case may\r\nbe, with its grammatical forms and constructions on the\r\nwhole well preserved. Nothing is more surprising to me in\r\nLXXIV.] Presidential Address. 297\r\nthe history of psychical research than the little attention\r\nthat has been paid to this remarkable aspect of the\r\nevidence. I can only account for it, as before, by the\r\nobstinate prejudice that everything is occurring in a\r\nspiritual realm where nothing means what it seems to\r\nmean. But for that we should have brought this fact \u2014the use of language\u2014into the full light of our philological knowledge and drawn from it exactly the same\r\nkind of inferences that would follow if we were to learn\r\nthat French and English were spoken on the planet Mars.\r\nIn that case we should at once conclude that the inhabitants of Mars are human beings ; that its ethnology\r\nis a counterpart to our own ; that its history, even its social history, is, in part at least, parallel to that of the\r\nearth ; for every language is an embodied memory, and\r\nnobody can speak English or French as his native tongue\r\nwithout being English or French in many other respects\r\n\r\nin respect of his present, his future, as well as of his\r\npast.\r\nHow is it that there has been so little scrutiny of the\r\nevidence on these lines ? How is it, I cannot help asking\r\nmyself, that a fact which would throw a flood of light\r\non any world, or sphere, or planet where it was discovered\r\nhas so far thrown hardly any light at all on the world\r\nwhich these communicating beings are supposed to inhabit ? Is it because we have made two compartments in our\r\nthinking, just as we have made two worlds in the universe, in one of which every fact has its intelligible context, while in the other each fact can be treated as though it had no context at all ? But the internal evidence is not exhausted by the two\r\nfacts I have mentioned ; indeed, it is so rich that I can\r\ndo no more than select a small portion of it. At every\r\npoint these beings are incidentally betraying something of\r\nimportance. For example, they are evidently in time : they look before and after, and even pine for what is not ; they can measure time by our intervals ; they speak of\r\nyesterday, to-day, to-morrow and next week\u2014distinctions\r\nwhich refer to astronomical conditions and would be meaningless without them. They even make appointments for\r\n298 L. P. Jacks, LL.D. [part\r\nthe future, a strange proceeding if we had to do with the\r\ntimeless self or transcendental ego of Immanuel Kant.\r\nMemory and expectation are theirs. They constantly bid\r\nthe sitter to wait for future developments. They become\r\nfatigued under exertion and desist when fatigue comes on. They move from place to place, and distinguish places\r\nthat are near from those that are far off. They hear and\r\nthey see ; and though I can find no distinct references to\r\nan atmosphere which carries the vibrations of sound, I\r\nfind many references to the light which is necessary for\r\nseeing, and to the colours which light produces. They\r\nare acquainted with each other's appearance, and describe\r\nit, sometimes in detail. There is hardly a case of alleged\r\ncommunication in which you do not find one or more of\r\nthese striking characteristics ; and if there were only one\r\nof them\u2014for example, the power of seeing,\u2014that alone\r\nmight suggest to science a whole context of necessary\r\nrelations and natural laws, and enable us to reconstruct\r\nwith general accuracy the kind of world in which the\r\nalleged seeing took place.\r\nLet us pause at this last item of evidence, which is of\r\ngreat interest, and consider the various ways in which it may be taken. We are in communication, let us assume,\r\nwith beings who by their own account are acquainted\r\nwith the phenomenon called light. Now, let us suppose\r\nthat in reading this evidence we do what I have been\r\nurging we should not do, namely, bring with us the\r\nnotions or beliefs inherited from popular metaphysics or from religion. In particular, we are all familiar with the\r\nnotion of a heavenly city where the light is not that of\r\nthe sun or the moon or the stars, but comes, as we say,\r\nfrom a spiritual source. I have no word to say against\r\nthis belief ; but I do say that it has no business here,\r\nand that if we introduce it at this point we are performing the operation which is known as \" queering the pitch.\"\r\nHowever, suppose we introduce it and jump to the conclusion that the light mentioned must be the light of\r\nthat city which has neither sun nor moon. What follows ? Why, that scientific inquiry comes to a dead stop. Science\r\nif left to herself would at once follow up the clue ; she\r\nLXXIV.] Presidential Address. 299\r\nwould say : If light, then a luminary which produces the\r\nlight, a medium through which the light is transmitted,\r\nan eye sensitive to action of light, an optic nerve, an\r\nappropriate sense organisation, and so forth. But no ! This is mystic light, this is spiritual light, light that never was on land or sea : light that has nothing to do with\r\nheat ; that requires no luminary to produce it ; that has\r\nno laws of refraction, no rate of transmission ; light that never waxes nor wanes, and knows no alternation of day\r\nand night. Now, all that may be wholesome mysticism ;\r\nit may be good religion ; it may be sound metaphysics ; but its introduction at this point is simply fatal to\r\nscientific inquiry. By suddenly changing the meaning of \" light \" to fit your preconceptions of the spiritual world,\r\nyou tear out of the hand of science the clue she was\r\njust beginning to grasp, and a piece of evidence which is full of significance and might have led to most important\r\nconclusions leads to nothing at all. Let me illustrate my meaning by one of those farfetched suppositions which, just because they are farfetched, are the less likely to encounter our prejudice.\r\nSuppose we were credibly informed by any means you\r\nchoose to imagine, that a rose, a single flower fully formed,\r\nhad been discovered on the planet Mars. How Science\r\nwould leap to her feet on receiving the information ! From that single fact she could reconstruct the general\r\ncharacteristics of the flora of Mars, with the greatest ease and almost infallible certainty. A planet which can produce a rose must be able to produce ten thousand other\r\nthings from the same conditions, and science could tell us in general what they are. Not the flora alone but the\r\nfauna would be involved. And beyond all that the fact\r\nwould expand into a mine of information concerning the\r\nclimate, the soil, the atmosphere, the seasons, and what\r\nnot. We may say, with little exaggeration, that the whole\r\nplanet would give itself away by letting out the single\r\nsecret that it contained a rose. But now suppose that\r\njust as this reconstruction was about to begin we were\r\nsuddenly confronted with a new and unexpected piece of\r\ninformation. \" This rose of Mars,\" we will imagine our\r\n300 L. P. Jacks, LL.D. [part\r\ninformant to say, \" is not what is commonly meant by\r\nthe word. It is a mystic rose, a spiritual rose of dawn,\r\na rose that grows on no tree, and is planted in no garden : a rose that flourished without the light of the sun ; about\r\nwhose roots no man has digged ; a rose that was never born from a bud ; a rose that neither grows nor withers nor dies.\" What would Science say to that ? Needless\r\nto say, she would have nothing to answer. She would be\r\nstopped on the threshold. The question would pass out\r\nof her hands altogether, and it would now be for the\r\nmetaphysicians, the poets, the mythologists, the mystagogues to make what they could of the new information.\r\nAnd even they could not make much of it. Now that,\r\nI make bold to say, is the position in which psychical\r\nresearch is often placed by the habit we all have of\r\ntranslating the evidence into what we call \" spiritual\r\nterms \" before we have given ourselves time to consider\r\nwhat the evidence really means. But now what does it mean ? What information does\r\nit convey as to the kind of beings with whom we are communicating ? Instead of answering the question by\r\nmeans of an idea which is quite external to the facts,\r\nlet us consult the internal witness of the evidence itself\r\nand be content for the time being with that.\r\nAll the characteristics I have named\u2014sex, language,\r\nsight, hearing, mental equipment, and the rest\u2014are wellknown human characteristics. Following the clue they\r\nplace in our hands, and arguing strictly from effects to\r\ncauses, we are led immediately to the conclusion that these are human beings. Nothing else is suggested by the bare\r\nevidence, and, so far as we are guided by the evidence,\r\nnothing else is conceivable. Whatever other conclusion we\r\nmight be tempted to draw in deference to metaphysics,\r\nto moral philosophy, or to religion, this and this only is the internal witness of the evidence itself. But, you will say, these people have died, they have\r\npassed from this life, they have left their bodies behind\r\nthem, they are invisible : it is right to assume, therefore,\r\nthat they are living under conditions so different from\r\nthose of earth that they cannot be human beings as we\r\nlxxiv.] Presidential Address. 301\r\nunderstand the terms. They are at least disembodied\r\n\r\nfor yonder are their bodies in the grave.\r\nAgain it seems to me you are leaping to conclusions : you are importing foreign matter ; you are going beyond\r\nthe evidence. To begin with, we must not take it for\r\ngranted that they are the dead. That is one of the\r\nquestions at issue : a question which the evidence must\r\ndecide, and not a known fact which decides the meaning\r\nof the evidence. But even if the question were not open,\r\neven if it were a proved truth that they are the dead, you\r\nare still forcing the pace. No doubt it is natural to\r\nthink that the world in which these beings now find\r\nthemselves is very different from the world they have\r\nleft. But that notion is not in the evidence ; it is in\r\nyour mind. What the evidence reveals is not the differ- ence between the two worlds, but their extraordinary\r\nlikeness, a likeness so close that it is hard to resist the\r\nconclusion that they are one and the same. A world in\r\nwhich sex is maintained and language used in the vernacular, not to speak of a score of suchlike things, must\r\nnot be set down offhand as a world that is wholly different\r\nfrom this. To say of one of these beings that it is \" he \"\r\nor \" she,\" that it speaks its native language, and so on,\r\ndoes not suggest that it is disembodied, but strongly\r\nsuggests the contrary.\r\nThere is no such thing as an isolated fact in science ; every fact has a necessary context, and carries with it. the\r\nwhole context of which it is an organic part. If you find a rose you know there was a tree that bore it ; you know\r\nthere was soil in which the tree was rooted ; that there were sun, air, moisture to nourish its growth. In the\r\nsame way, if you get one of the essential characteristics\r\nof a human being you get the lot. If you find sex you\r\nfind much more than sex, namely, a whole biological\r\nsystem ; if you find vision you find light ; and if the light,\r\nthen everything that goes with the light ; and this gradually expands into wider and wider contexts until you get\r\nthe whole order of nature as we know it here and now.\r\nScience cannot reason otherwise. To forbid her so to reason is to take the question out of her hands and pass\r\n302 L. P. Jacks, LL.D. [part\r\nit to imagination or to faith. No man honours imagination and faith more than I do ; but this Society is a\r\nscientific body.\r\nHere, then, we are confronted with a most important\r\nconsideration which, unless I speak in ignorance, has not\r\nbeen sufficiently weighed. To science\u2014not to metaphysics\r\nalone, but to positive science in its severest form\u2014every\r\nindividual carries with it the world to which it belongs.\r\nIt is the representative of a world ; it is the summary of a world. Its full context is nothing less than the whole\r\nsystem of things, of laws and relations in which it stands,\r\nand without which it cannot be, and cannot even be\r\nthought of. Whenever you get an individual thing you\r\nget at the same time the world that goes with it, the\r\nworld in which it has come to be what it is ; if you get\r\nthe rose you get also the tree, the soil, the sun, the solar\r\nsystem\u2014in fact, the natural universe. Each of us in like\r\nmanner is what he is, is in fact himself, in and through\r\nthe world to which he belongs ; he and his world are so inextricably bound together that you cannot have the first without having also the second. Strip him of his world\r\nand you destroy his identity, you destroy everything that\r\nmakes him what he is. A rose which survives in another\r\nworld without a tree, without air, and without sun, is not a rose at all, but something else called by the same\r\nname ; still less can it be the identical rose that grew in\r\nmy garden yesterday.\r\nIf you remind me that the rose of the next world once had the soil, the air, and the light of this, and that,\r\nhaving had them once while it was on this earth, that\r\nsuffices to maintain it as a rose in its new sphere of\r\nbeing, so that it can now get on without them\u2014if you\r\ntell me this, I must say with all respect that though you\r\nhave made a delightful fairy tale, to science it is nothing\r\nbut nonsense. My rose, the one that grew in my garden\r\nyesterday, was precisely the sort of thing that could never\r\nget on without sun, air, and soil in any sphere of being,\r\nand which lost all the characteristics of a rose very soon\r\nafter it was deprived of them. Your rose, which can now\r\nget on without them for ever, is another kind of article\r\nLXXIV.] Presidential Address. 303\r\naltogether, and nothing that you can say will ever persuade me to identify it with the flower whose ways I\r\nknew so well, whose nurture I tended, and at whose\r\nwithering I shed a tear or composed a melody.\r\nIf, then, it is true\u2014and I think it unquestionably is true\u2014that you cannot separate the individual from his\r\nworld, that you cannot tear him out of his known context\r\nwithout destroying his identity\u2014what follows ? It follows\r\nthat the theory of human survival involves far more than\r\nit seems to do at first sight. It means that the individual\r\ncarries his world with him and cannot survive on any\r\nother condition. In other words, when we are proving\r\nthe survival of A, B, and C, we are proving also the.\r\nsurvival of the world of relations in which their individualities are rooted, and which is the necessary background to\r\neach one of them, being the man he is. Such is the load\r\nwhich the theory of survival, so far as it is based on scientific\r\nevidence, will ultimately have to sustain.\r\nSome may be tempted to say that the burden is too\r\ngreat, that no theory could ever sustain such a load. But\r\nwhy not ? I do not see that the survival of the whole\r\norder of nature is one whit harder to understand or\r\nbelieve in than the survival of any individual who belongs\r\nto that order. And truly it does survive, for it dies and\r\nlives again incessantly, enacting before our eyes the very\r\nthing of which we are in search. At all events, I should\r\ninsist that the evidence, taken at its best, points unmistakably in that direction ; for it indicates human beings,\r\nand thereby indicates the whole order of nature which is involved in their existence. It may be that our present\r\nnotions of the order of nature are too narrow\u2014merely\r\njjarochial ; and that our right course is to exjDand our\r\nconceptions of nature to fit the evidence, instead of\r\nforcing the evidence into the narrow mould of our existing\r\nideas. Survival, if proved, cannot stand alone as an\r\nisolated fact. It will react upon the whole body of our\r\nknowledge, as every new discovery inevitably does. It\r\nwill compel readjustment all round. Its effect in knowledge might even be revolutionary.\r\nBut why talk about \" survival \" at all ? Is not that\r\n304 L. P. Jacks, LL.D. [part\r\nalso a question-begging term ? Assuming these beings to\r\nbe the persons they seem to be. are we quite sure they\r\nhave \" survived \"\u2014that that is the proper term to apply\r\nto their condition ? Do we know for certain that they\r\nhave made a passage, that they have left a familiar port\r\nand arrived at a strange one ? We know, indeed, that\r\nthey died. But were we present in the article of their\r\ndeath, and did we see the departing soul making its exit to \" another world \" ? Did they ? Do either they\r\nor we know what happened ? Does their \" survival \"\r\nstand in the evidence ? No, it does not. What stands\r\nin the evidence is their existence where they are. There\r\nis no evidence\u2014at least, none that I can credit\r\n\r\nof hoiv\r\nthey got there.\r\nIn past ages the nightly disappearance of the sun gave\r\nrise to the belief that the sun had gone away, which is precisely what it seems to do, and a cosmogony was\r\nconstructed to account for the departure and for the\r\nsubsequent arrival. Even the idea of \"survival\" was\r\nintroduced to account for the strange doings of the sun. We now know that the sun has never moved at all : there has been no departure and no arrival : or rather,\r\nit is we who have departed and arrived, and not the\r\nsun. May it not be that we are here in presence of a\r\nsimilar problem ? May it not be that where these beings\r\nnow are, there they have been all along ; that we have\r\nsimply found them in one of their many homes ? It is a question which opens out into fields of speculation\r\ntoo vast for me to attempt their exploration now. But\r\nperhaps the notion of multiple personality may have some\r\nlight to throw on this matter. No man knows how many\r\nmen he is. Which means that no man knows how many\r\nlives he lives, and how many worlds he inhabits here and\r\nnow. The many in the one ! We take that as meaning\r\nmany atoms of dust combined into one world. But why\r\nnot many lives in one life, many selves in one self, many\r\nworlds in one world ? But that is an abyss on the edge\r\nof which it becomes me to pause.\r\nI will only say, in conclusion, that in this inquiry we\r\nare all too ready to \" take the cash and let the credit\r\nLXXIV.] Presidential Address. 305\r\ngo.\" The cash is the particular fact we are in search of \u2014to wit, the fate of some individual whom we have lost\r\nand who was dear to us. The credit is the whole system\r\nof other facts with which this one stands in necessary\r\nrelation. To these we give little attention. The emotional\r\nstress is often so great that the particular fact we are\r\nin search of stands out completely isolated in the mind,\r\nand nothing else is of any importance. So Ave take the\r\ncash and let the credit go. But Science cannot look at\r\nthe matter in this way. Her main interest is with the\r\ncredit ; with the bearing of this thing on all other things.\r\nI am afraid we have sometimes forgotten that. It is not\r\neasy to remember, especially at the present time, when so many millions are held fast in the grip of their private\r\nsorrows. But we must try to remember it. After all,\r\nthe S.P.R., high as its functions are, cannot claim the\r\nhighest function of all, which is that of administering\r\nconsolation amid the tragedies of life. If that follows\r\nfrom our labours\u2014well and good ! But it is not for us\r\nto make it our object.\r\n306 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PART\r\nV.\r\nSOME EXPERIMENTS WITH A NEW AUTOMATIST.\r\nA Paper Read to the Society on April 24, 1916.\r\nBy Mrs. W. H. Salter.\r\nIn the Journal for February, 1915, a notice was inserted\r\nasking members of the Society and their friends to\r\noffer themselves as subjects for experiments in thoughttransference, either with or without hypnotism. Amongst\r\nthose who answered this appeal was Mrs. Stuart Wilson,\r\nthe new automatist to whom reference is made in the\r\ntitle of this paper. Mrs. Wilson, who is an American\r\nby birth and the wife of Brigadier-General Charles\r\nStuart Wilson, C.B., of the Royal Engineers, has been\r\nfor many years an associate of the S.P.R., and is known\r\npersonally to several members of the Council. I should\r\nlike to take this opportunity of thanking Mrs. Wilson\r\nfor the trouble to which she has allowed herself to\r\nbe put in complying with the various conditions which\r\nI have from time to time suggested in the conduct\r\nof these experiments, and also in providing me with\r\nprompt and detailed records of her own experiences.\r\nMrs. Wilson and I met each other for the first time\r\non April 12, 1915, at the Rooms of the Society. Our\r\noriginal scheme was to carry out a series of experiments\r\nin thought-transference on the same lines as those which\r\nhad been canied out with the Misses Tipping (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXVII.), Mrs. Wilson being the percipient\r\nand I the agent. But we decided in this case to try\r\nthe effect of hypnotising the percipient, and accordingly\r\nDr. Gilbert Scott kindly undertook to be present at\r\nthe experiments and to act as hypnotist. Mrs. Wilson\r\nproved a good subject as regards the lighter stages\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments with a New Automatist. 307\r\nof the trance, but Dr. Scott was never able to induce\r\nsomnambulism.\r\nWe tried seven experiments of this kind, the subjects\r\nchosen for transmission including numbers, playing cards,\r\nsimple diagrams, etc. Sometimes I sat in the same room\r\nas the percipient behind a screen, and sometimes in the\r\npassage outside, the door of the room being closed.\r\nA certain amount of success was obtained, especially in\r\nthe case of the diagrams, but it seemed doubtful whether\r\nthe proportion of successful results was greater than\r\nmight be expected from chance-coincidence.\r\nAbout this time Mrs. Wilson found that when lying\r\non her bed in the evening she was able by self-suggestion\r\nto put herself into a condition resembling a light hypnotic trance, and I therefore proposed that we should\r\nsee whether we could obtain a greater degree of success\r\nin experiments at a distance. Accordingly we tried\r\nfive experiments under these new conditions between\r\nApril 26 and May 16, 1915, Mrs. Wilson again acting\r\nas percipient and I as agent. The times at which\r\nthese experiments took place were pre-ai ranged, Mrs.\r\nWilson being always in London, and I sometimes in\r\nanother part of London, and sometimes at Cambridge.\r\nThe subjects which I chose for transmission were articles\r\nof various kinds (in two cases pictures) which I held\r\nin my hands or placed in front of me, concentrating\r\nmy attention upon them as much as possible. In no\r\ncase did Mrs. Wilson get any clear impression of the\r\nsubject of the experiment, but she did on several occasions display what appeared to be abnormal knowledge\r\nof my surroundings, and from the reports which she\r\nsent me I formed the opinion that she was likely to\r\nprove a good percipient, if the right conditions could\r\nbe devised.\r\nI therefore proposed to Mrs. Wilson that instead of\r\ndeliberately trying to convey certain thoughts to her,\r\nI should write automatically at the time of our experiments, with the idea that if thoughts are transmitted\r\nby the subconscious rather than the conscious mind,\r\nMrs. (Wilson might in this way get into touch with my\r\n308 Mrs, W. H. Salter. [part\r\nsubconscious thoughts as expressed in automatic writing.\r\nIt is with this third series of experiments that I am\r\nhere concerned, and I will begin by describing in greater\r\ndetail the conditions under which they were carried out.\r\nAs to my own part, I did not in any way modify\r\nthe course which I generally follow in regard to my\r\nautomatic writing, having come to the conclusion that\r\nbetter results are likely to be obtained when I leave\r\nmy mind entirely free and do not try to direct it towards any particular subject or person.\r\nMrs. Wilson's procedure is as follows : having provided\r\nherself with pencil and paper, she lies down in the\r\ndark and lapses almost at once into a light stage of\r\nhypnosis. In this condition a series of very vivid mental\r\npictures present themselves to her, amounting sometimes\r\nto visual hallucinations. Not infrequently she hears a\r\nvoice, it may be her own voice or the voice of some\r\nother unknown person. On some occasions the voice\r\nalso has been completely externalised as an auditory\r\nhallucination.\r\nMrs. Wilson makes brief notes of her impressions\r\nat the conclusion of the experiment ; sometimes, after\r\nshe thinks the experiment is over, she has some further\r\nimpressions, which are duly noted. Once or twice it has happened that the impressions have taken the form\r\nof a vivid dream during ordinary sleep of which Mrs.\r\nWilson has noted as much as she could remember on\r\nwaking. The detailed records which she sent to me\r\nwere based on her own contemporary notes, and were\r\nusually written out on the day following the experiment. These records have all been preserved, together\r\nwith the postmarks showing the dates upon which they\r\nwere despatched.\r\nMy own scripts were as usual sent to Mi. Piddington\r\nimmediately after they had been written, and before\r\nI had received any statement from Mrs. Wilson as to\r\nher contemporary impressions. I never showed my\r\nscripts to Mrs. Wilson, or gave her any clue as to their\r\ncontents. On receiving from her the record of her\r\nown impressions, I usually sent a brief acknowledgement,\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments with a New Automatist. 309\r\nstating\u2014if such were the case\u2014that the experiment\r\nhad given interesting results, but by Mrs. Wilson's own\r\ndesire I never mentioned any details whatever. It\r\nshould therefore be noted that whereas the impressions\r\nreceived by Mrs. Wilson during any of our preceding\r\nexperiments, were in each case known to me, Mrs.\r\nWilson had no normal knowledge as to the contents\r\nof my preceding scripts, none of the scripts with which\r\nI am here concerned having been published. This point\r\nis important, because it happened more than once that\r\na topic referred to in my script made its appearance\r\na short time afterwards in Mrs. Wilson's impressions.\r\nThe question may be asked, whether in my conversations with Mrs. Wilson or in my letters to her\r\nduring the period of these experiments anything was\r\nsaid which might directly or indirectly turn her thoughts\r\ntowards the subject-matter of my contemporary scripts.\r\nI have no hesitation in saying that this factor in the\r\ncase is negligible. As I have already remarked, I never\r\nsaid anything at all to Mrs. Wilson about my own\r\nscripts, and our conversations together were on quite\r\nother subjects. My letters to Mrs. Wilson during this\r\nperiod have all been preserved. They consist for the most\r\npart either of vaguely encouraging remarks to the\r\neffect that I thought the result of the experiments\r\ninteresting, or in suggestions as to the time and conditions of the next experiment.\r\nIt will be s_en that the conditions under which these\r\nexperiments were carried out were such as to reduce\r\nto small proportions the risk of error from mere inaccuracy of memory or record. I do not think that\r\nthe theory of deliberate collusion between Mrs. Wilson\r\nand myself will be widely held, although I freely admit\r\nthat we cannot disprove it.\r\nIt will be convenient at this stage to say something\r\nabout the extent of Mrs. Wilson's acquaintance with\r\nthe various reports on automatic writing which the\r\nSociety has published in lecent years, since her impressions might well be influenced by her memory of what\r\nshe had read in these reports. Mrs. Wilson, as I have\r\nu\r\n310 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\r\nalready stated, has been an Associate of the S.P.R. for\r\nsome years. She has therefore received, and in most\r\ncases has read, the Journal and Proceedings, during\r\nthis period. She has seldom however read any of their\r\ncontents more than once, and her conscious recollection\r\nof them is not extensive or accurate. But for evidential\r\npurposes we must assume that Mrs. Wilson\u2014subconsciously at least\u2014knows whatever has appeared in\r\nthe Journal or Proceedings. This assumption however\r\nwill affect the argument of my paper very little ; for\r\nthe connexions of thought between Mrs. Wilson's records\r\nand my scripts relate in the great majority of cases\r\nto topics which are not mentioned, certainly not emphasised, in any published reports, so that Mrs. Wilson's\r\nprevious knowledge could not lead her to expect that\r\nsome allusion would be made to these topics in myscript. Generally speaking, it may be said that whilst\r\nMrs. Wilson's impressions exhibit hardly any signs of\r\nbeing influenced by her recollection of published reports\r\non automatic writing, they have a curious tendency\r\nto dwell upon topics to which more or less frequent\r\nreference has been made in unpublished scripts, of which\r\nMrs. Wilson could know nothing. This aspect of the\r\ncase is one with which I shall not concern myself here,\r\nexcept in so far as certain of my own scripts, written\r\nduring the period of my experiments with Mrs. Wilson,\r\nappear to be reflected in her records. For\u2014besides the\r\nfact that I am not in a position to compare Mrs.\r\nWilson's records with scripts by other automatists, to\r\nwhich, being myself an automatist, I do not for evidential reasons have access-\u2014this interrelation of scripts is a question which could not be fully discussed without\r\ngoing into matters not at present publishable. In the\r\nopinion of those investigators who are able to judge\r\nthe case, Mrs. Wilson's records are a valuable contribution to the evidence for supernormal phenomena which the\r\nSociety has obtained in the last few years through experiments in various kinds of automatism, chiefly writing.\r\nHaving thus indicated the limited scope of this paper,\r\nI will now give an account of a group of cross-corre-\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments iviih a New Automatist. 311\r\nspondences which occurred between Mrs. Wilson's records\r\nand my own script during our first seven experiments\r\ntogether between May 20 and June 16, 1915.

Both the records and the scripts are printed\r\nverbatim with explanatory notes and translations in square\r\nbrackets.

We\r\nhave first a quotation from the second book of the\r\nGeorgics. Virgil is speaking of the philosopher Epicurus\r\n(or of his follower Lucretius) and says :\r\nFelix qui potuit lerum cognoscere causas. [Happy he who\r\nwas able to learn the causes of things].\r\nThen follow three quotations from English poems all dealing with voyages. First the opening line from one\r\nof the songs in Browning's Paracelsus : Over the seas our galley went.\r\nThe meaning of this song in relation to the whole\r\npoem does not concern us here ; it is enough to say\r\nthat it tells the story of an imaginary voyage to a land\r\nthat no man has visited before. The second quotation\r\n* For convenience of reference all my scripts are filed under these\r\ninitials, which are those of my name before marriage.\r\n1 Virg. G.

The Scott Antarctic expedition, upon\r\nwhich Dr. Wilson lost his life, is one of the most notable\r\nexamples in recent years of a voyage of discovery, and\r\nthe spirit which animated it was evidently the spirit\r\nexpressed in the various quotations given in my script, \u2014\r\n\u2022\r\nto adventure into undiscovered regions at whatever cost\r\nto oneself. The impression of a gipsy caravan, which\r\nMrs. Wilson recorded just before hei impression of Dr.\r\nWilson's portrait, suggests a wandering life and perhaps\r\nbelongs to the same train of thought.\r\nThis is the only occasion upon which Mrs. Wilson\r\nhas made any allusion in her records to Dr. Wilson\r\nor to the Scott expedition, and this is the only occasion,\r\nat least within the period of my experiments with Mrs.\r\nWilson, upon which my script has referred with such\r\nparticular emphasis to the ideas of exploration and\r\n314 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PART\r\ndiscovery. I should add that until I received Mrs.\r\nWilson's record, which of course was after my own\r\nscript had been written, I did not know that she\r\nand Dr. Wilson were related. I should not however\r\nlay much stress on this connexion between Mrs. Wilson's\r\nrecord and my contemporary script were it not reinforced by another connexion of a moie .definite kind.\r\nAchilles, and by implication Ulysses, make their first appearance in this script through the quotation from\r\nTennyson's Ulysses. Then after a short divergence the\r\nscript returns to the subject with the words :\r\nBetter to be a slave\r\nbut that belongs to Achilles.\r\nThe allusion here is to the passage in Homer's Odyssey\r\nin which Odysseus, or to give him his Latin name\r\nUlysoes, goes down to the underworld and meets the\r\nshade of Achilles, who says to him : \"I would rather\r\nbe a serf with another man for my master and that\r\nman poor, than rule over all the dead that have passed\r\naway.\"\r\nIt will be remembeied that Mrs. Wilson's record\r\nclosed with impressions of a whip and a collar (d) described as \" the collar of a willing slave.\" This phrase\r\nrepresents very closely the spirit of Achilles' words.\r\nHe is ready to be a slave, if he may return to the\r\nworld of living men. The word \" slave \" moreover is actually used in my script, although \" serf \" would be a better rendering of the Greek.\r\nTwo other impressions which Mrs. Wilson recorded\r\non May 23, 1915 (b and c), show an association of\r\nthought with phiases which occur in my preceding\r\nscript of May 20, 1915, written during my first experiment with Mrs. Wilson, and it is woith noting that\r\nat the conclusion of her record on Ma;y 20, 1915, Mrs.\r\nWilson wrote : The odd part of the whole experiment is that while I\r\nfelt sure I had failed, another part of my mind was insisting that it had got your idea. If so, perhaps it will emerge\r\nfrom the subconscious stratum before long.\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments ivith a New Automatist. 315\r\nH.

She at once said : \" The Spirit of God moving on the face of the waters.\"\r\nThis takes us to the first chapter of Genesis : And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\r\nAnd God said, Let their be light : and there was light.\r\n. . . And God called the light Day, and the darkness he\r\ncalled Night. And the evening and the morning were the\r\nfirst day.5\r\n1 Cf. Tennyson, In Memoriam, XI. : \" Calm is the morn.''\r\n2 Genesis i\r\n.\r\n3 These phrases refer to an earlier H. V. script in which some\r\nwords were illegible.\r\n4 Rossetti, Love's Nocturne.\r\n5 This passage figured with some prominence in a paper read by\r\nMr. J. G. Piddington at a Private Meeting of the Society on January\r\n29, 1915, but Mrs. Wilson was not present at this meeting and knew\r\nnothing of the paper till it was published in December, 1916.\r\n316 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PART\r\nThe words \" the evening and the morning,\" are quoted\r\nin my script of May 20, 1915. They occur six times\r\nin Genesis, Chapter I., once for each day of creation,\r\nand my script leaves it an open question to which of\r\nthe six days reference is here made. But there is undoubtedly a reference to the first chapter of Genesis , to which Mrs. Wilson, according to her own independent\r\ninterpretation, referred on May 23, 1915.\r\nFurther, Mrs. Wilson's impression of a\r\n\" hand stretched\r\nout over a troubled sea \" is immediately followed by\r\nan impression of two women setting out on a journey\r\nto a temple, and Mis. Wilson adds that she thought\r\nof Baalbek, which is a town at the foot of Mount\r\nLebanon, and was one of the chief seats of the worship\r\nof t he Assyrian sun -god Baal.\r\nIn my script of May 20, 1915, immediately after the\r\nquotation from Genesis, there is a reference to the\r\ntemple of Aesculapius (Asclepius), the god of healing.\r\nThis topic is pursued in the allusion to the snake, one\r\nof the symbols most frequently associated with Aesculapius,\r\nand in several phrases about healing, which conclude\r\nwith the words : \" Stretch forth thy hands.\"\r\nTaking the context into consideration, I think the\r\nallusion here is probably to the healing of the man\r\nwith the withered hand.\r\nThen saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. 1\r\nIf the allusion in my script is to this passage, the words\r\nare not quite accurately given ; hand should be singular\r\nand not plural. The words \"stretch forth thy hands\"\r\noccur in John xxi. 18, but the context there has\r\nno relevance to the context in my script. So far as the\r\ncross -correspondence between myself and Mrs. Wilson\r\nis concerned, it matters little to which passage my\r\nscript is taken to refer.\r\nThe script then goes on :\r\nBroken images\u2014the temple of Baal\u2014they shall count their\r\nflocks\u2014the shepherds and the sheep.\r\n1 Matt. xii. 13. I am confirmed in this opinion by the fact that a fortnight\r\nlater in .my script of June 4, 1915, the words \"the palsied hand\" occur.\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments with a New Automatist. 317\r\nThere is almost certainty a reference here to Byron's\r\npoem The Destruction of . Sennacherib\r\n.\r\nThe widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,\r\nAnd the idols are broke in the temple of Baal\r\n;\r\nand this perhaps accounts for the subsequent allusion\r\nin the script to shepherds and sheep, for the opening\r\nline of Byron's poem is :\r\nThe Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold.\r\nHowevei that may be, the \" temple of Baal \" makes\r\na clear point of connexion between my script and Mrs.\r\nWilson's record of three days later containing an allusion\r\nto Baalbek. This is the only time that there has been\r\nany reference to Baal in Mrs. Wilson's recoids.\r\nIn my own script the line quoted above\r\nAnd the idols are broke in the temple of Baal,\r\nwas quoted on August 11, 1910 (an unpublished script).\r\nThere have been one oi two other allusions, certain or probable, to The Destruction of Sennacherib, but no\r\nother allusions to the temple of Baal.\r\nIt will be observed that whereas in my script the\r\nallusions to a hand outstretched and to the first chapter\r\nof Genesis emerge as two quite distinct lines of thought,\r\nin Mrs. Wilson's record they are combined into a single\r\nimpression of a hand stretched out over the sea, which\r\nsymbolises \" the spirit of God moving on the face of\r\nthe waters.\" This difference in form may seem to diminish the force of the coincidence, but we must take\r\ninto consideration that in such cases each individual\r\nmind is likely to follow pre-existing lines of association\r\nand these will almost certainly introduce individual\r\nmodifications of the form in which any given idea is clothed. What is notable in these cases is that in one form or another the same ideas do arise in two or more minds, and I believe that a careful study of the\r\nvarieties of form into which ideas are moulded by each\r\nindividual mind might throw interesting light on the\r\nmental processes lying behind these phenomena.\r\n318 Mrs. W.

Now Mrs. Wilson's impressions on this occasion seem\r\nto show two distinct stratifications of thought. We\r\nhave first the impression of a valley between snow\r\nmountains with a cavern at the end of it, followed\r\nby the impression of a spindle. At the end of the\r\nrecord these two ideas seem to coalesce into the impression of a tianee-like sleep, as represented by the Sleeping\r\nBeauty, who fell asleep after pricking her thumb with a\r\npoisoned spindle, and by Psyche who fell asleep after her\r\nvisit to Proserpine.\r\nThe other stratum of thought is represented by two\r\nmental pictuies of mediaeval hill-towns and a quotation\r\nfrom Pippa Passes. Between these two pictures and\r\nBrowning's poem there is a natural link, for the scene\r\nof the poem is laid at Asolo, a mediaeval hill-town of\r\nNorth Italy.\r\nI now turn to my own scripts of which theie are two to be considered here, one written on May 27,\r\n1915, the other on Ma\\ 28, 1915, during my experiment with Mrs. Wilson.\r\nH.

In H. V. script it is applied to a tower and in Mrs. Wilson's record to a\r\nspindle, but it should be noted that the material is emphasised in each case. Mrs. Wilson sees \" something\r\nthat looked like an implement made of ivory,\" afterwards\r\nidentified as a spindle, and H. V. script has :\r\nivory\u2014an ivory tower\r\n\r\nLater in her record Mrs. Wilson notes an impression\r\nof a tower, but she does not associate this in any way\r\nwith the ivory spindle.\r\nIf this cross-correspondence on the word \" ivory \" is more than a chance-coincidence, it is an instance of the\r\ntendency on the part of each automatist, to which I\r\nreferred above, p. 317, to \" introduce individual modifications of the form in which any given idea is clothed.\"\r\nTwice in my recent scripts (March 18 and March 24,\r\n1914) I had alluded to \" a tower of ivory.\" The words\r\nare from Canticles vii. 4 : Thy neck is a tower of ivory,\r\nbut the immediate reference in the script was to a poem\r\nby Walter de la Mare, of which the opening lines are\r\nThere was nought in the valley\r\nBut a tower of ivory ; a poem with which I am familiar.\r\nWhen therefore I wrote the script of May 27, 1914,\r\nthere existed in my mind a strong link of association\r\nbetween \" ivory \" and \" tower,\" so that any allusion\r\nto the former would almost inevitably lead me on to\r\nthe latter. In Mrs. Wilson's case this particular association\r\nhad no force, and she links her impression of ivory\r\nwith a spindle, perhaps because the story of the Sleeping\r\nBeauty was already latent in her mind.\r\n322 Mrs. W.

When I say told\r\nI do not mean that I heard voices, for last night there were none, but none the less T understood that certain words\r\nwere to be recorded. There were a lot of Indian scenes,\r\nmost of them in a town. Towaids the end of the series\r\nthere was one of a square, or garden, with canals and\r\nvery brilliant flower-beds. In the background were large\r\nand very fine gates opening into a park.\r\nNext came a landscape, a rolling country with enormous tawny hills in the distance. The whole place seemed a\r\ndesert.\r\nThen came a seaport that seemed almost European, and\r\nthen a very black and rough sea. The last of all was, I suppose, meant for the Jungle.\r\nThere were enormous trees with heavy dark foliage and at their base a sort of thicket of bamboo which seemed to be\r\ngetting sun from somewhere, for the delicate pale-green leaves were very lovely.\r\nThe words : \" There is one glory of the sun and another\r\nof the moon.\" 1\r\n[After this Mrs. Wilson went to sleep.]\r\n(b) In the early morning, almost a dream.

He was very thin and\r\nhaggard, but it was an angelic face, so pure and sweet\r\nwith rings of fair hair curling round the forehead. He came\r\nand went and we all knew him, and I do not know what\r\nhappened, but suddenly we realised that he was \" Death,\r\nthe unrecognised familiar friend, the conciliator and consoler.\"\r\n1 1 Cor. xv. 41.\r\n324 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PART\r\nThe first two sections of Mrs. Wilson's record (a\r\nand b) consist in a series of impressions of India, with\r\none of which (the park scene) Mrs. Wilson associates\r\nan impression of a woman and child. She also associates\r\nwith this series a quotation from the English burial\r\nservice (1 Cor. xv.).\r\nThere is probably a first emergence here of the same\r\ntrain of thought which appears more definitely amongst\r\nMrs. Wilson's impressions on June 13, 1915 (see below),\r\nthat \" some one in India has had a great grief, the\r\ndeath of a child, I think.\"\r\nIt is with the last section of Mrs. Wilson's record\r\n(c) that I am now concerned.\r\nIn older to make clear the connexion which I believe\r\nexists between Mrs. Wilson's dream and my own script\r\nwritten on the same day, I must go back to the last\r\nof the five earlier experiments carried out by Mrs. Wilson\r\nand me, the conditions of which I have described in\r\nmy introduction (p. 307). Briefly, I as agent endeavoured\r\nat a pre-arranged time to transmit a definite idea of\r\nsome kind to Mis. Wilson. I quote my own contemporary\r\nnote of this experiment.\r\nMay 16, 1915, 10.15 p.m.\r\nI sat in my bedroom at 5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge,\r\nlooking at Diirer's picture \" Ritter, Tod und Teufel \" [The\r\nHorseman, Death and the Devil], the picture which suggested\r\n\" Sintram.\"\r\nShortly before the experiment M. de G. V. [my mother,\r\nMrs. Verrall] suggested as a subject the picture hanging\r\nin her room called \" Der Tod als Freund \" [Death the Friend],\r\nbut I did not choose this, because I did not think I could\r\nvisualise the picture sufficiently clearly.\r\nThe picture by Albrecht Diirer, which was the subject\r\nof this experiment, is probably familiar to most of myreaders. It represents a knight on horseback with Death\r\n\" on a pale horse \" riding beside him, and walking behind\r\na fiendish creature with a boar-like head. The con- nexion between this picture and Sintram is that it was\r\nsent to Baron de la Motte Fouque by a friend with a\r\nLxxrv.] Some Experiments with a New Automatist. 325\r\nrequest for an explanation, and the Baron replied to this\r\nrequest by writing \" Sintram and his Companions : A\r\nNorthern Tale after Albrecht Diirer.'' 1 The other picture mentioned in my note on May 16,\r\n1915, \" Der Tod als Freund,\" is a German woodcut representing the interior of a belfry-tower. The bell-ringer, a very old man, is sitting in a chair ; he has evidently\r\ndied whilst ringing the angelus, and Death, dressed as a Pilgrim, is ringing the bell for him. Through the\r\nbelfry-window, looking westwards, a landscape is visible, a level stretch of fields, lit by the rays of the setting sun.Mrs. Wilson's impressions on May 16, 1915, did not\r\nappear to have any relation to either of these pictures,\r\nand the experiment was therefore reckoned a failure.\r\nI said nothing whatever to Mrs. Wilson as to what\r\nthe subject of it had been.\r\nWhen I read Mrs. Wilson's account of her impressions\r\non June 4, 1915, and in the early morning of June 5,\r\nwith the allusion at the end to \" Death the unrecognised,\r\nfamiliar friend,\" I was at once reminded of the subject of our experiment on May 16. Mrs. Wilson's dream\r\nsuggested that she had received a belated impression of\r\nan idea I had then thought of conveying to her, and I\r\nlooked at my script of June 4, 1915, to see if any\r\nrecurrence to the subject of the earlier experiment could\r\nbe found there also. I will now quote part of this\r\nscript.2\r\nH.

The allusion to a horseman suggested the title of\r\nDiirer's picture, The Horseman, Death and the Devil,\r\nbut I was not sufficiently familiar with the story of\r\nSintram, which I read as a child, to remember whether\r\nthere was any point in referring to him as \" the horseman of the dawn,\" a curious and distinctive phrase.\r\nI therefore read the book again on June 12, 1915, and\r\nwill now give an outline of the story, emphasising the\r\nrelevant points.\r\nStory of Sintram and His Companions.\r\nSintram 's father, Bjorn, and other knights are sitting in\r\ncouncil when Sintram, a boy of twelve, rushes in frightened\r\nand says that Death and \" yet Another \" are there behind\r\nhim. Bjorn refuses to explain the incident, but Rolf, an\r\nold servant, eventually tells the story of the curse which\r\nis on Sintram.\r\nOne Christmas when the child was five years old,\r\nhis father,\u2014to keep an oath sworn in anger\u2014determined to\r\nkill in cold blood two helpless merchants who had sought\r\nrefuge in his castle. When his wife Verena tries to restrain\r\nhim from this crime, he calls on Death and the Devil and\r\nstakes his child's soul upon the keeping of his oath. Verena\r\ncalls for God's help, a sudden blindness comes upon Bjorn\r\nand his followers, and the merchants escape. Ever since\r\nthen the child has been subject to these strange visitations\r\nat Christmas time. Verena has gone into a convent, where\r\nshe spends her time praying for her husband and son. The story then develops, and Sintram passes through various\r\nperiods of temptation, in consequence of the curse. The\r\nclimax of the story is reached in Chapter 27. Sintram, now\r\na grown man, has been to visit the old priest at the convent\r\nwhere his mother is living. The priest tells him that the\r\ncrisis of his life is now at hand. He is to ride home to\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments ivith a New Automatist. 327\r\nhis father's castle alone by night, and on the way he will be assailed by the powers of evil. The priest prays\r\nfor him, and he sets out on horseback, accompanied\r\nby his dog. Then follows the scene based upon Diirer's\r\npicture. \" In front of Sintram the dark valley stared at him like\r\nhis grave.\" He rides on, and presently is joined by a figure\r\non a small tired horse, who insists on riding with him.\r\nAt first Sintram does not know who his companion is, but\r\neventually the unknown rider reveals himself as Death. He\r\ncarries an hour glass in his hand, from which a light shines,\r\nhe has a snake wreathed about his head, and his horse has\r\na bell round its neck which rings a death-knell, as he moves\r\non. Then the devil, in the shape of a beast half boar and\r\nhalf bear, comes up behind and tempts Sintram, who however resists him, and commends his soul into the hands\r\nof Death. The devil then leaves him, and Sintram supposes\r\nthat he is now to die. But Death explains that it is to\r\nSintram's father, Bjorn, that he is coming and not to Sintram\r\nhimself. His aspect then changes, the gleam in the hourglass grows brighter, the snaky crown becomes a shining\r\npalm-wreath, the horse turns into a white vaporous cloud\r\nand the bell begins to play lullabies. Sintram rides home.\r\n\" Death had vanished, but in front there floated something\r\nlike a rosy cloud of dawn,1 which remained visible after\r\nthe sun had risen and was shining bright and warm in the\r\nwinter sky.\"\r\nMeanwhile (Chapter 28) Bjorn is lying at the castle in a trance, and is supposed to be dead. A group of servants\r\nare talking together, when another servant breaks in upon\r\nthem in great excitement, and says : \"A horseman 2 is approaching, a wonderful horseman, I would think he was Lord Sintram, but a bright, bright cloud of dawn drifts close in front of him all the way, and plays upon him with such\r\nbrilliant lights that you might think it was just red flowers\r\nfalling on him. And besides that his horse has a reddish\r\nwreath on its head, such as I have never been used to\r\nsee worn by our dead master's son.\"\r\nAnother servant explains that he made the horse a wreath\r\n1 Eine rothliche Morgenwolke. 2 Ein ritter.\r\n328 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\r\nof red oak-leaves the day before as an emblem of victory.\r\nSomething seemed to tell him he must.\r\nMeanwhile Sintram reaches the castle. Bjorn rouses himself\r\nfrom the trance, and cries out : \" ' Who is this that comes ? I know, it is my son Sintram. But whom does he bring\r\nwith him ? That is the whole question. On that depends\r\nwhether I am lost or no\/\r\n' You are not lost, dear father,' said Sintram 's friendly\r\nvoice through the gently opened door, and the rosy cloud\r\nof dawn drifted in with him.\r\nBjorn folded his hands, looked thankfully up to Heaven\r\nand said with a smile : ' Yes, yes thank God, it is the\r\nright companion. It is beautiful, friendly Death.' \" 1 Sintram and Bjorn have some talk together, and then the\r\nstory goes on : \" Little by little the hall grew quieter. The old knight's\r\nlast hour was approaching. ... At the end the dying man\r\nsaid :\r\n' Is that Verena's evening bell at the convent ?\r\n'\r\nSintram nodded. . . . Then it was as though a ray of\r\nlight flashed from the old eyes, the dawn-cloud wrapped itself close about him, and light and cloud and life had gone\r\ntogether from the corpse.\"\r\nIt may therefore be said that \" the horseman of the\r\ndawn \" is a very apt description of Sintram as he is represented by de la Motte Fouque in the principal\r\nincident of his stoiy, based on Durer's picture ; moreover the \" dawn-cloud,\" which floats before Sintram,\r\nsymbolises Death, the friend, whom he brings to his\r\nfather, so that an allusion to this incident is well chosen\r\nto biing out the underlying association of ideas between\r\nthe two pictures which figure in the experiment on May\r\n16, 1915. Durer's picture (the origin of Sintram) and\r\nthe picture representing Death the friend.\r\nV.\r\nMrs. Wilson had very few impressions on this occasion\r\n(June 8, 1915), and since they do not appear to have\r\n1 Der schone, freundliche Tod.\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments with a New Automatist. 329\r\nany connexion with my contemporary script, they need\r\nnot be discussed here. (See Appendix, p. 345.)\r\nVI.\r\nMrs. Wilson's record of June 13, 1915, 10.15 p.m.\r\nVery few pictures and a perfect torrent of words. Blank\r\nverse, I think. I have still a distinct idea of the metre,\r\nbut of course could only remember a sentence here and\r\nthere. The ideas seem to be, first, that someone in India\r\nhas had a great grief, the death of a child, I think ; secondly,\r\nthat someone is called or chosen for some work, not entirely\r\neasy.\r\nA red and stormy sunset over the desert.\r\nOne of those little green plants, called Jonah's gourd,\r\nthat grow in the sand.\r\nThe facade of a house or temple, the columns linked\r\ntogether with white flowers woven into heavy ropes.\r\nAn interior and the words : \" one who sits desolate.\"\r\n\"My house left desolate unto me.\" \"Rachel mourning for\r\nher children.\" Then a picture of a round-faced, fair-haired\r\nwoman embracing two children. I heard her say : \" Yes,\r\nI have these left.\" I forgot to say there was an impression of an oriental\r\nbazaar to signify India was intended.\r\nWhat follows seems to have no connexion with what I have already written. \" Above all things to thine own self be true,\r\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\" 1 \"A harp of a thousand strings.\" 2 With this the picture of a wind -harp hanging from the\r\nbranch of a. tree, and the next two sentences are still evidently struggling with the harp idea.\r\n\"By the waters of Babylon we sat and wept.\"\r\n\" How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land.\" 3 Then any amount of blank verse, and with it a vision\r\nof the Abbey picture of Galahad taking his seat at the Round\r\nTable, followed by the one where he keeps vigil over his armour.\r\n1 Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act I., sc. iii.\r\n2 Dr. Watt's Hymns. 3 Psalm cxxxvii. 4.\r\n330 Mrs. W.

The first she describes as centering\r\nabout \" the idea that some one in India has had a\r\ngreat grief,\" probably \" the death of a child,\" seems\r\nto be connected with her earlier impressions on June\r\n4, 1915 (see above, p. 322). It is with the second group\r\nthat I am now concerned. Mrs. Wilson describes it as representing the idea that \" some one is called or chosen\r\nfor some work not entirely easy.\"\r\nThis same idea seems also to be represented in the\r\nopening sentences of my own contemporary script, which\r\nI will now quote.\r\nH.

He was usually a runaway slave, who became piiest by killing his predecessor in single combat, and held office until he was\r\nhimself killed by his successor. This quotation, taken\r\nwith the preceding words of the sciipt, seems to indicate\r\na man endowed with some special faculty or appointed\r\nto a special task.\r\nThe next words of the script :\r\ntruth and a sword\u2014a two-edged sword\r\nseem to be derived from several closely connected passages\r\nof the Bible. Compare, for instance, the following : And he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of\r\nhis mouth went a sharp two-edged sword : and his countenance\r\nwas as the sun shineth in his strength. Rev. i. 16.\r\nFor the wotd of God is quick and powerful, and sharper\r\nthan a two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder\r\nof soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Heb.\r\niv. 12.\r\nStand therefore having your loins girt about with truth\r\nand having on the breast-plate of righteousness . . . And\r\ntake the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit,\r\nwhich is the word of God. Eph. vi. 14-17.\r\nWith this allusion in my script to truth, compare\r\nMrs. Wilson's quotation from Hamlet\r\n:\r\nAbove all things to thine own self be true. The next phrases in my script of June 13 : though I should perish\u2014the prater of Ajax, are an allusion to a passage in Homer's Iliad, where\r\nthe Greek warrior Ajax, finding himself and his com1 Ps. cxxxvii. 4\r\n2 Cant. ii. 1.\r\n332 Mrs. W.

The symbol represents the Greek\r\nletters x an<^ P\r\nan<^ r )> the *wo letters of the\r\nname Christ. The legend runs that when Constantine\r\nthe Great was on the march against Maxentius, whom\r\nhe soon afterwards defeated at Saxa Rubra, he saw\r\none day a luminous cross in the sky above the midday sun, inscribed with the words Hoc signo vinces (By\r\nthis sign thou shait conquer). During the following night\r\nChrist himself appeared to Constantine and diiected him\r\nto set the symbol of the cross upon his standard a ad\r\nmarch on with assurance of victory. As a result of\r\nthese two visions Constantine adopted the Christian faith\r\nand set upon his standard (labarum) a cross, a crown,\r\nand the monogram ch r. There is thus a connexion of thought between my allusion\r\non June 13, to \" the sign by the way \" (interpreted\r\nby me as a cross) and Mrs. Wilson's impression on the\r\nmorning of June 14 of the Constantinian monogram,\r\nand it is worth noting that in her first impression she\r\nsubstitutes a cross for the Greek letter p. Moreover,\r\nthe cross which Constantine saw in the sky, the sign\r\n1 The letter-press describing the picture (in the Magazine of Art) speaks of the old beggar \"sitting by the wayside,\" and this perhaps accounts for my\r\nmistake about the title of the picture. The phrase \"the wayside cross\"\r\nwhich occurs in two earlier scripts of mine (January 31 and September 23,\r\n1912) is probably an emergence of the same group of associations.\r\n334 Mrs. W. H.

On April 14, 1916, I read this paper,\r\nsubstantially as it appears here, at a meeting of this\r\nSociety, at which Mrs. Wilson was present. On the\r\nfollowing day, April 15, 1916, Mrs. Wilson and I tried\r\nanother experiment and her record on that occasion\r\ncontains the following words : \" Hark all ye that pass by ! Is there any sorrow\r\nlike unto this soriow ? \" The reference here is to Lamentations i. 12 :\r\nIs it nothing to you, all ye that pass by ? behold, and see\r\nif there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow . . . Now the opening words of this verse (italicised above)\r\nare the motto of the picture by Frank Dicksee, with\r\nwhich, as I have said, I associated the phrase in my\r\nscript \" the sign by the way.\" When I read my paper\r\non April 14, I was awaie of this fact, having looked\r\nup the leproduction of the picture (see above, p. 332),\r\nbut I said nothing of the motto in my paper, as it did not appear relevant to the matter in hand. I\r\nwas interested therefoie to find that Mrs. Wilson had\r\nquoted it in her recoid on the following day, April\r\n15, and on April 18 I wrote to ask her whether she\r\nknew the picture by Dicksee of which I had spoken\r\nin my paper and knew what was the motto to it. Mrs.\r\nWilson replied that, so far as she knew, she had never\r\nseen the picture in question and had no idea what\r\nthe motto might be. It is obviously impossible to\r\nprove that Mrs. Wilson is correct in thinking that she\r\nhas never had any normal knowledge concerning the\r\npicture and its motto,1 and therefore the quotation of this\r\nmotto in her record of April 15, 1916, nidy be due\r\nto a revived memory. The most probable alternative\r\nhypothesis seems to be that Mrs. Wilson's impression\r\nof the passage from Lamentations was deiived by thoughttransference from my mind.\r\n1 As to whether Mrs. Wilson is likely to have seen the original\r\npicture, it is worth noting that it was exhibited in the Royal Academy\r\nof 1881\u2014at which date Mrs. Wilson was a young child and still living\r\nin America\u2014and was bought by a private collector.\r\n336 Mrs. W.

She said he was the \"heretical Pharaoh\" and an interesting character. So far as I can remember she told me nothing more of him\r\nthan that.\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments ivith a New Automatist. 337\r\nMy script on June 16, 1915, was written in two\r\nparts, one at 3.20 p.m. and the other contemporaneously\r\nwith Mrs. Wilson at 10.15 p.m. 1 The earlier part contains the following passage : And it came to pass in 40 days\r\n\r\ndays of penance\u2014the peace-offering.\r\nWhen I read this script through immediately after\r\nwriting it, I supposed that the allusion in these words\r\nwas to the Temptation in the Wilderness.\r\nThen was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness\r\nto be tempted of the devil.\r\nAnd when he had fasted forty days and forty nights,2 he Avas afterwards an hungered.3\r\nI still hold that this interpretation is almost certainly\r\nconect, although there are two other passages in the\r\nBible to which it might be thought that allusion was\r\nmade.\r\n(a) Genesis viii. 6.\r\nIt came to pass in forty days that Noah opened the window\r\nof the ark which he had made ; and he sent forth a raven.\r\n(b) Exodus xxxiv. 28 (the story of Moses going up into\r\nMount Sinai)\r\n.\r\nHe was then with the Lord forty days and forty nights : he did neither eat bread, no* drink water.\r\nThe first words quoted from the script \" and it came\r\nto pass in 40 days \" are an almost exact quotation\r\nfrom the passage in Genesis and it might therefore be\r\nheld that the words of my script must be taken as\r\nreferring to the flood ; but this interpretation does\r\nnot satisfactorily explain the next words of the script \" days of penance,\" which must be taken into consideration as indicating the trend of thought expressed\r\n1 See Appendix, p. 348.\r\n2 I am indebted to Mr. Bayfield for the suggestion that the temporal form of this sentence (\" when he had fasted,\"' etc.), is repre- sented in my script by the words \" and it came to pass.\"\r\n3 Matthew iv. 1, 2.\r\n338 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\r\nin the writing. These words might refer equally well\r\nto the sojourn of Moses on Mount Sinai or to Christ's\r\nsojourn in the Wilderness, since both were periods of\r\nfasting ; indeed the transition of thought from one\r\nevent to the other is very easy. I do not propose to\r\ndiscuss the connexion between them ; it is enough\r\nfor my purpose to point out that the marginal reference\r\nat Luke v. 1 (the Temptation in the Wilderness) is to Exodus xxxiv. 28 (Moses on Mount Sinai). But\r\nI believe that the allusion in my script is rather to\r\nthe Temptation, chiefly because that is how I interpreted the words, immediately after writing them, and\r\nI think an automatist's contemporary interpretation of a script is likely to be correct. But whether or no\r\nmy script should be interpreted as referring explicitly\r\nto the Temptation, an allusion to it may be regarded\r\nas implicit in the script. For to any one familiar with\r\nthe Gospel narrative a reference to a period of 40 days\r\nwhich were \"days of penance\" would inevitably recall\r\nthe Temptation, the most famous of all such periods.\r\nAssuming then that in my earlier script on June 16,.\r\n1915, there is a reference, at least implicitly, to the\r\nTemptation, there is on this point a cross-coriespondence\r\nbetween Mrs. Wilson and myself, for her first impression\r\non that day, received a few hours after my script was\r\nwritten, was of the Temptation.\r\n1 now turn to the second part of my script of June\r\n16, 1915, written during my experiment with Mrs. Wilson.\r\nIt begins as follows : Dominus illuminatio mea 1 [The Lord is my light]. non eadem vultu demisso [Not the same with downcast face]\r\nthe walls of stone\u2014the city wall a walled city\u2014Avatchman what of the night ? the answering word\u2014the sleeping\r\ncity\u2014the bridge at midnight\u2014a poet's dream\r\n\r\nI will first analyse this script, considering especially\r\nthe various literary allusions which it contains and\r\ntheir implications. In this case also I am interpreting\r\nmy script according to opinions which I formed before\r\n1 Psalm xxvii. 1 ; the motto of the University of Oxford.\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments with a New Automatist. 339''\r\nI had any knowledge of Mis. Wilson's contemporary\r\nrecord. The script begins with the opening words (in\r\nLatin) of the 27th Psalm, \"The Lord is my light.'\"\r\nThe next words, also in Latin, are obscure and I will\r\nnot discuss them here. The phrase \" Watchman what\r\nof the night ? \" involves two literary associations :\r\n(a) It is a quotation, in the first instance, from Isaiah\r\nxxi. 11 : Watchman what of the night ? The watchman said : The\r\nmorning cometh and also the night : if ye will enquire,\r\nenquire ye.\r\nThere is probably an allusion to the watchman's\r\nanswer in the concluding words of the script (not quoted\r\nabove) \" into the coming night.\"\r\n(6) \" Watchman what of the night- ? \" is also the\r\nfirst line of a poem by Swinburne called A Watch in\r\nthe Night. 1 This poem is included in a volume (Songs\r\nbefore Sunrise) the subject of which is the Italian War\r\nof Liberation. I myself associate the words with Swinburne rather than with Isaiah.\r\nThe next phrases of the script contain several literary\r\nallusions which it is not very easy to disentangle. \" The\r\nbridge at midnight \" is a quotation from a poem by\r\nLongfellow :\r\nI stood on the bridge at midnight,\r\nWhen the clocks were striking the hour.\r\nBut although the actual words are from Longfellow,\r\nthe two phrases between which they occur in my scriptsuggest that the literary association lying behind them\r\nis with three other poems, all of which are more familiar\r\nto me than Longfellow's.\r\nReferences to a sleeping city and a bridge at once\r\nrecall Wordsworth's Sonnet on Westminster Bridge, especially\r\nthe lines : Dear God ! the very houses seem asleep,\r\nAnd all that mighty heart is lying still.\r\n1 The words \" what of the night ? \" are repeated in the first line\r\nof each stanza, e.g.\r\nli Italy, what of the night ? \"\r\n340 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\r\nIt should be observed however that Wordsworth did\r\nnot stand upon Westminster Bridge at midnight, for\r\nhe says that : The city now doth like a garment wear The beauty of the morning.\r\nThe allusion to midnight has probably drifted in through\r\nmy recollection of Longfellow.\r\nThere is yet another literary association contained in\r\nthe words \" the sleeping city,\" and this association\r\nwill explain, I think, the reference in the script to\r\n\" a poet's dream.\" In Fragments of Prose and Poetry by\r\nFrederic Myers, there is a poem called Venice, which\r\nconcludes with the following lines : How sleeps that city now ! and far is fled Her tale of fights outfought and Doges dead.\r\nThe flying Fames ring round her still ; but she\r\nDreams in her melted Pearl of sky and sea. For me too dreaming let the sunset fire Shade the dark dome and pierce the pillared spire ! Let night and peace the cosmic promise pay,\r\nAnd even the Soul's self dream into the day ! The phrase of my script \" the sleeping city \" echoes\r\nMyers's words : \" How sleeps that city now,\" and the\r\nprobability that there is here an allusion to Myers's\r\npoem is, I think, strengthened by the allusion in the\r\nscript to \"a poet's dream.\" For not only do these\r\nwords suggest Myers's phrase : \" For me too dreaming,\r\netc.,\" but they are a quotation from Wordsworth's\r\npoem on A Picture of Peele Castle : Ah ! Then, if mine had been the Painter's hand,\r\nTo express what then I saw ; and add the gleam,\r\nThe light that never was on sea or land,\r\nThe consecration and the Poet's dream.\r\nThis poem had been associated with Myers's Venice\r\nin an article by Mr. J. G. Piddington, published in\r\nProceedings S.P.E., Vol. XXVI., pp. 174 ff.\r\n1\r\n1 There are further allusions to Peele Castle in my script of June\r\n16, 1915 (see Appendix, p. 348), i.e. \"the golden gleam\" (cf.\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments with a New Automatist. 341\r\nWe are now in a position to consider my second\r\nscript of June 16, 1915, in relation to Mrs. Wilson's\r\ncontemporary record.\r\n(a) The opening words \" The Lord is my light \" express\r\nthe same idea as we find in Mrs. Wilson's allusion to\r\nAknaton and \" his symbol for divine beneficence, the\r\nsun,\" followed by the first words of Cardinal Newman's\r\nhymn \" Lead, kindly light.\"\r\n(6) Mrs. Wilson had an impression of a \" city on\r\nthe banks of a great river,\" followed by impressions\r\nof \"a ruined amphitheatre \" and \" the Forum at Rome.\"\r\nMy contemporary script on the other hand speaks of\r\nthe city Avail\u2014a walled city . . . watchman what of the night ?\r\n. . . the sleeping city\u2014the bridge at midnight.\r\nThese phrases, if we take them together, relate apparently\r\nto a city on the banks of a river (implied Li the\r\nreference to a bridge), and there is possibly a further\r\nconnexion of thought between Mrs. Wilson and me\r\nin my quotation from Swinburne's poem, A Watch in\r\nthe Night, the subject of which is the Italian risorgimento, and Mrs. Wilson's allusion to Rome, with which\r\nshe seems, according to the sequence of her impressions,\r\nto identify the city on the banks of a river.\r\n(c) I have pointed out that the allusions in my script of\r\nJune 16, 1915, to \"the sleeping city\" and \"the poet's\r\ndream \" contain in my opinion a reference to Frederic\r\nMyers's poem entitled Venice. This point is interesting\r\nwhen we remember Mrs. Wilson's contemporary impression\r\nof \"the lion of St. Mark with the halo and the open\r\nevangel.\" These are the arms of the city of Venice\r\nand the earlier part of Myers's poem contains the lines : And one great word the lords of Venice wist : \" My peace be with thee, Mark Evangelist ! \"\r\nProceedings S.P.B., Vol. XXVI., pp. 183 ff.), and probably \"like a\r\nglass \" (ef. Peele Castle, \" Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea \"), and J' the flowing tide\" (cf. Peele Castle, \"No motion but the moving\r\ntide\"). Both these lines from Wordsworth's poem are quoted in Mr. Piddington's article.\r\n342 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part\r\nAt the end of her record of June 16, 1915, Mrs.\r\nWilson noted that whilst dressing on the following morning she was haunted by the words \" The spirits of\r\njust men made perfect \" (Heb. xii. 23). Now the\r\nmotto to the published edition of Myers's poem is from\r\nthe Aeneid (Book VI., p. 691): \" nee me mea cura\r\nfefellit [nor has my care misled me],\" but another\r\nmotto was written by Myers on a MS. copy of the\r\npoem. It is taken from Hebrews xi. 40 : \" That they\r\nwithout us should not be made perfect.\" 1 There is not only a verbal similarity between these words and\r\nthe quotation from the following chapter of Hebrews,\r\ngiven by Mrs. Wilson, there is also a connexion of\r\nthought ; for the writer of the Epistle contrasts the\r\n\" elders,\" those who lived before the time of Christ,\r\nand \" without us \" wsxe not \" made perfect \" (Heb.\r\nxi. 40), with the followers of Christ who have been\r\n\" made perfect \" through Him (Heb. xii. 23). Mrs.\r\nWilson's allusion to this last passage may therefore\r\nbe due to a subconscious impression of the alternative\r\nmotto and Myers's poem Venice.\r\nThe facts about these two mottos to the poem are given in Proceedings S.P.B., Vol. XXVI., pp. 205 ff., and\r\nthe poem itself is discussed there at some length. Wemust assume that Mrs. Wilson had at some time read\r\nthis discussion (see above, p. 309), but that would not\r\naccount for the fact of her alluding to the city of\r\nVenice, and perhaps indirectly to Myers's poem Venice,\r\non the day when my script almost certainly alludes\r\nto the poem.\r\nI have included in this report only the first seven\r\nof my experiments with Mrs. Wilson, as they make a\r\nconvenient group for discussion. We have continued the\r\nexperiments since that time and have obtained results\r\nof considerable interest, some of which may form the\r\nsubject of a later report.\r\n1 These words are clearly alluded to in a line of the poem,\r\nthus : \" Nor even their joy without us perfected.\"\r\nlxxiv.] Some Experiments with a New Automatist. 343\r\nTabular Summary.\r\nJune 16, 1915.\r\nWilson Record.

Why I at once decided he was\r\nthe husband in Browning's The Ring and the Book, I do not know, or why, except that it is, I think, the most\r\nbeautiful part of the poem, I found myself thinking of the\r\npart where the Pope sums up the case, and especially of\r\nlines that run something like this :\r\n\" Give one good moment to the tired old man,\r\nWeary of finding all his world amiss.\"\r\nI know that is not a correct quotation, but I can get no\r\nnearer. Then came a picture, I mean an impression, of a wood\r\nin spring-time. Just one great mass of white blossoms.\r\nThen trees again, but this time evergreens, and this time\r\nit was winter, for though they too seemed covered with\r\nwhite flowers, it was snow. One fir-tree, outlined against\r\nthe intense blue of the sky, stayed with me for a long time.\r\nThen it was autumn, and T was one of two people on horseback in a dreary swamp. There were humps of long, dead\r\ngrass sticking up out of the black mud, masses of yellow\r\nreeds, and the trees, for it was still a wood, were leafless. We were alone and in danger, for our horses could not find\r\nfirm footing. 1 The last two impressions seem to have nothing to do\r\nwith what went before. A small company of men in armour\r\nled by a young knight, bareheaded and with long hair.

Bayfield.\r\nSince a few of the experiences which form the subject of this\r\npaper are without corroboration, it seems desirable to begin\r\nwith a word or two about the lady to whom they oc- curred, lest you should regard these uncorroborated incidents\r\n\u2014or, indeed, the main narrative\u2014with any suspicion. Of\r\ncourse, as our experience has taught us, it is only prudent, in the case of any one not well known to us, to\r\nreceive unsupported statements on the subjects with which\r\nthe Society is concerned with a certain amount of reserve ; but in the present case you will, I think, agree with me\r\nthat the incidents which are confirmed by the testimony\r\nof others lend full credibility to those which are not so supported.\r\nThis lady, who belongs to a family well known in North\r\nDevon\u2014her maiden name was Chichester\u2014has been known\r\nto me from her childhood and to my wife from her birth ; indeed, our families are connected by marriage. Of the\r\ntruthfulness of her statements we have no doubt, and I\r\nhave myself carefully cross-examined her on each of the\r\nincidents that are now to be brought before you. I ought further to state that those accounts which are in\r\nmy own language, and which form the majority, were\r\nwritten down from information given in conversation\r\nseveral weeks before I received the confirmation of other\r\npersons concerned. That is to say, my account of any\r\nparticular incident is really her own independent account,\r\n1 This paper, with the exception of the last in< ident (p. 373) was read\r\nbefore the Society on November 22, 1915, and was printed in the\r\nJournal for January-February, 1910\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 351\r\nnot a story put together by me upon a comparison of the\r\nwhole evidence. She signed each account separately when I\r\nhad written it, and has since read and signed the whole paper\r\nas correct. Similarly, her written accounts were given to\r\nme before I received the corroborations. From childhood,\r\nas she tells me, she has had experiences similar to those\r\nrecorded here, but until the occurrence of one tragic\r\nincident which I shall have to relate, attached no particular importance to them. The recent experiences were\r\nfirst brought to my own notice a few months ago. I\r\nat once urged her to make contemporary notes of all such\r\npremonitory impressions, but although she fortunately did\r\nso in two subsequent cases, in three others the good\r\nintention was forgotten.\r\nIn 1910 Miss Chichester married Lieut. George Harley\r\nPownall, R.N., and they went to live at Harwich, where\r\nhe was in command of a submarine. She tells me that when\r\nthey were engaged she felt convinced\u2014it seems to have been\r\na settled conviction and more than a mere fear\u2014that he\r\nwould not five long ; but admits that she considered the\r\nsubmarine service a dangerous one even in time of peace.\r\nWe may see reason to think that this opinion was perhaps\r\nnot the sole cause of the presentiment. Lieut. Pownall\r\nwas of a robust constitution and his health was excellent.\r\nOne day while they were at Harwich she saw, or thought\r\nshe saw, through a window that looked on the street, her\r\nhusband come up on his bicycle, get off, and approach the\r\nhouse. She then heard the door open and shut, and the\r\nsound of his footsteps in the hall. As he did not come\r\ninto the room, she went out but found no one. This was\r\nin the afternoon. Lieut. Pownall, who had not been near\r\nthe house at that time, returned about an hour later. 1 In 1913 Lieut. -Commander Pownall (he had been promoted\r\nin 1911) was appointed First Lieutenant of the Egmont,\r\ndepot-ship of the submarines at Malta, with command of\r\n1 Some ten or eleven years ago, when away on a visit, Miss Chichester\r\nhad a visual hallucination of her mother, who, being then at home, had\r\nendeavoured (without any previous arrangement) to make herself visible to her daughter. She had previously had a similar hallucination of her\r\nmother, but without intention on the latter's part.\r\n352 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [PART\r\nthe Submarine Flotilla there. Mrs. Pownall went out with\r\nhim.\r\nIn August 1914, after the outbreak of the war, Mr. R. E.\r\nKnox, R.N.. 1 who was on the staff of Admiral Carden,\r\nAdmiral Superintendent of the Dockyard, said in Mrs.\r\nPownall's presence, \" Anyhow we [meaning the Admiral\r\nand his staff] shall not leave Malta, for the Admiral has\r\njust received an extension of his appointment \"\u2014or words\r\nto that effect. 2 A few days later, about August 12, on\r\ncoming down to breakfast Mrs. Pownall said she had\r\ndreamed on the previous night that Admiral Carden was\r\ngoing to have command of a fleet at sea, but nowhere\r\nnear England. This was said to her husband and Mr.\r\nKnox, and later to Captain L. T. Esmond.3 Since it was\r\nthen common knowledge that the Admiral was not to be\r\nrelieved, her friends naturally dismissed the dream as absurd. Some five weeks after this (I am betraying no\r\nsecret, for the fact was at once publicly known) Admiral\r\nCarden was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, then at the Dardanelles.\r\nThis is corroborated by Mr. Knox as follows :\r\nOctober, 1915.\r\nIn August 1914 I was [on the staff of] Admiral Carden.\r\nI remember that towards the end of the month 4 I said to\r\nMrs. Pownall that the Admiral and his staff would be fixtures\r\nat Malta during the war, as the appointment of the Admiral\r\nwho was to relieve him had been cancelled. I remember also\r\nthat a few days later Mrs. Pownall said she had dreamed\r\nthat Admiral Carden was in command of a Fleet at sea. Lieut. -Commander Pownall, Captain [Esmond], and I regarded it as extremely improbable that he would leave Malta Dockyard.\r\n(Signed) R. E. Knox.\r\n1 Not the real name or initials.\r\n2 There was, I believe, no formal \" extension \" ; it would be more correct\r\nto say that it became known that the Admiral was not to be relieved as had\r\nbeen expected.\r\n3 Not the real name or initials.\r\n4 Since sending this statement Mr. Knox has written that he cannot\r\nclearly recall what time in August the incident happened. Mrs. Pownall\r\nfixes the date as being a few days after August 8, on which day she\r\nand her husband moved into the house in which the dream occurred.\r\niiXxrv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 353\r\nCaptain Esmond writes from Malta on October 23, 1915 :\r\nMrs. Pownall told me in August 1914 that she had dreamed\r\nthat Admiral Carden was to have a command at sea, but\r\nnowhere near England. This was generally regarded as improbable, in view of the fact that the Admiral had only\r\nrecently received an extension of the appointment he then\r\nheld at Malta,\r\nSome time after the outbreak of the war, but before\r\nSeptember 7, 1911, the question of the despatch of\r\nsubmarines from Malta to the Dardanelles was discussed among Mrs. Pownall's friends. It is natural to\r\nsurmise that the discussion began after August 10, and\r\nthat it arose from the fact that the Goeben and Breslau\r\nhad on that day succeeded in reaching Constantinople.\r\nThe naval officers were of opinion that the submarines\r\nwould remain at Malta for the defence of the island.\r\nMrs. Pownall, however, constantly affirmed to her husband\r\nand others that the submarine flotilla would be sent to the\r\nDardanelles and that he would go with them. She will, I\r\nam sure, not quarrel with me if I say that her grasp of naval\r\nstrategy is not such that this conviction, opposed as it was to expert opinion, is likely to have been based on\r\nreflection and judgement. The declaration of war against\r\nTurkey, it will be remembered, was not made until\r\nNovember 5, 1914.\r\nThe premonition is corroborated by Mr. Knox as follows :\r\nNovember 1, 1915.\r\nI remember Mrs. George Pownall saying in August 1914 that\r\nthe Malta submarines would be sent to the Dardanelles. We\r\nall considered this most improbable.\r\n(Signed) R. E. Knox.\r\nCaptain Esmond writes under date October 23, 1915 :\r\nBefore the Submarine Flotilla left Malta for the Dardanelles\r\nit was the general opinion in Naval circles that it would not be\r\nso employed, being required for the defence of the island. I remember that Mrs. George Pownall nevertheless affirmed more\r\nthan once that the submarines would be sent to the Dardanelles.\r\nThis took place.\r\n354 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [PART\r\nOn September 7, 1914, Mrs. Pownall saw her husband\r\npass across the harbour in his skiff. She had frequently seen him do so, but on this occasion she said to herself, \" He is going to the Admiral to receive orders for the\r\ndispatch of the submarines to the Dardanelles.\" This was\r\nin fact the case, and the flotilla left Malta next day.\r\nLieut.-Commander Pownall made the voyage in the\r\nHindustani, a collier, which was afterwards renamed\r\nthe Hindukush and became the submarine depot-ship at\r\nthe Dardanelles. He remained on this ship until he was\r\ntransferred to a transport on some day between the 17th\r\nand 25th of April, 1915.\r\nWhen her husband parted from her, Mrs. Pownall felt absolutely sure she would never see him again, 1 and from\r\nthat day onwards she always felt peculiarly depressed on\r\nSundays, and mentioned the fact in letters to her husband\r\nmany times. On Sunday, April 25, 1915, he was killed\r\nby a bursting shell while in charge of a boat taking part\r\nin the first landing on Gallipoli. He was wounded in the\r\nearly morning and died at 10.30 a.m. On that same afternoon at Malta Captain Esmond called\r\non Mrs. Pownall and delivered a letter written to her by her\r\nhusband, whose letters were sent that way by private\r\narrangement\u2014probably for greater safety or more rapid\r\ndelivery. After giving her the letter Captain Esmond\r\nleft Mrs. Pownall in the drawing-room, saying he was very\r\ntired and would go into the smoking-room and have a nap. She proceeded to read the letter, which was dated the\r\n17th of April, and when about half through was seized\r\nwith an overpowering conviction that the landing had taken\r\nplace and that her husband had been killed. The conviction\r\nwas so strong that she felt impelled to go and tell Captain\r\nEsmond at once, but refrained from disturbing him. I have\r\nnaturally not been able to ask to see this letter, but Mrs.\r\nPownall assures me that it contained nothing about naval\r\nmatters beyond the statement that her husband was going\r\non to a transport.\r\nIt should be explained that the officer in command of a submarine flotilla does not live on a submarine, but on\r\n1 Her own words are : \" I had not a shadow of doubt about it.\"\r\nLxxrv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 355\r\nwhat is called a depot-ship, which may be any ship that is suitable for the purpose. Lieut.-Commander Pownall, as I\r\nhave said, had up to the time of writing been on the\r\ncollier Hindukush. When Mrs. Pownall read that he was\r\ngoing on to a transport, she wondered why this was, but\r\nher only conclusion was that for some reason he was to\r\nbe temporarily transferred from his submarine duties. No\r\ndoubt the removal to a transport might suggest duties in\r\nconnexion with the troops, and as I have recently learned,\r\nthis was in fact the explanation, for the naval officers who\r\nsuperintended the landing were all placed together on an\r\nempty transport in order to make the necessary arrangements. Mr. Knox, however, writes to me that a naval\r\nofficer would not necessarily infer from the change even\r\na relinquishment of the submarine duties ; \"it might only\r\nmean that a transport was being used as a Submarine Parent\r\ninstead of the collier which had hitherto been used.\" We\r\nshall see that the transference did not suggest to Captain\r\nEsmond any participation in the landing. He had peculiar\r\nfacilities for knowing all that was to be known, and shortly\r\nbefore this had told Mrs. Pownall that the landing would\r\nnot take place for some little time.\r\nTogether with the letter from her husband, Captain\r\nEsmond had brought to Mrs. Pownall a letter from Mr.\r\nKnox, who also was at the Dardanelles. She does not\r\nremember which she opened first. Mr. Knox's letter has\r\nbeen destroyed, and he has no recollection of its contents.\r\nMrs. Pownall, however, is sure that it contained no refer- ence to the landing of the troops ; and we may take it for certain, that even if anyone had known the precise\r\nday of the landing more than a week before, Mr. Knox\r\nwould not have divulged so vital a secret, and also that he\r\nwould certainly not have said a word about Lieut.-Commander Pownall's taking part in the operation, even if he\r\nhad then any expectation of his doing so. Before Mr.\r\nKnox left, Mrs. Pownall had obtained from him a promise\r\nthat he would send to Captain Esmond a telegram with\r\nthe news of her husband's death whenever it should happen ; she says she did this because she was sure he would\r\nbe killed. This telegram, as we shall see, Mr. Knox sent.\r\n356 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\r\nTo continue the story. When after about an hour\r\nCaptain Esmond returned to the drawing-room, Mrs. Pownall told him she was sure the troops had landed and that\r\nher husband had been killed. He replied that he did not\r\nbelieve it for a moment ; firstly, because he did not think\r\nthe landing would take place for a day or two, and,\r\nsecondly, because whenever it took place, it was most\r\nunlikely that Lieut.-Commander Pownall would have any\r\npart in it. Apparently nothing that he could say produced any effect, and she replied that she was sure she\r\nwas right. So sure was she, that she asked him to promise\r\nthat he would himself bring her the news when it came, and\r\nhe said he would certainly do so if the need should arise.\r\nI now give Captain Esmond's account of this interview,\r\nwritten from Malta ; it confirms Mrs. PownalPs account with\r\nextraordinary particularity.\r\nOn Sunday April 25th 1915, the day on which Lieut. Comdr\r\nPownall was killed, I took to Mrs. Pownall at her house a\r\nletter written from her husband to her and sent under cover\r\nto me. After giving her the letter I went into the smokingroom and slept for an hour. On my return to the drawingroom Mrs. Pownall told me she was sure her husband had\r\ntaken part in the landing and been killed. I was not aware\r\nthat the landing had taken place, and did not expect the\r\nattempt to be made for 2 or 3 days. That Lieut. Comdr\r\nPownall would land seemed to me improbable, as he was O.C.\r\nSubmarines. However, I had heard that he had received some\r\nappointment other than that of O.C. Submarines. In reply to\r\nMrs. Pownall's statements I said that it was of course possible,\r\nbut that in view of the fact that 10 beachmasters had been\r\nappointed by the Admiralty, whom I had seen passing through\r\nonly 3 or 4 days previously, I did not think for a moment,\r\nthat a valuable submarine officer would be taken as a beachmaster. This was my honest belief. Mrs. Pownall then asked me to bring her the official news of\r\nher husband's death, and I said I would be sure to do so, if it came. When the news actually arrived I was unavoidably prevented from fulfilling this promise. As far as I am aware, the\r\nonly news Mrs. Pownall received of her husband's death was a\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition, and Telepathy. 357\r\nprivate telegram from Mr. [Knox . . .] to me. When I received\r\nit [this was on the Wednesday after the death] H. E. the\r\nGovernor was expected and I could not leave my office, and\r\nmy telegram was communicated to Mrs. Pownall by Mrs.\r\nLimpus, wife of the Admiral Superintendent. On my arrival\r\nat 2.0 p.m. (2 hours after receiving the telegram) Mrs. Pownall\r\nwas quite calm, and told me that as soon as she saw Mrs.\r\nLimpus she knew she had come to tell her her husband was\r\ndead. She was expecting the news hourly.\r\nCaptain Esmond appends the following note to his accounts\r\nof the three incidents in which he was concerned :\r\nOctober 23, 1915.\r\nThe facts I have related above are absolutely true and I am\r\nprepared to swear to them, if necessary.\r\n(Signed) L. T. Esmond, Captain, . . . Some account of Lieut.-Commander Pownall himself is desirable for a complete appreciation of this incident, and\r\nit will be most convenient to give it at this point. He\r\nwas an exceptionally talented and able naval officer, and\r\nso far as it can be said of any one man in a service\r\nthat contains so many men of great ability, there can be\r\nno doubt that his death is a serious loss to the Navy.\r\nNot only was he a master of his particular business, but\r\nhe also possessed considerable literary and other gifts, and\r\nwas a most agreeable and interesting companion. His\r\nappointment at Malta is evidence of the estimate which\r\nthe Admiralty had formed of his abilities.\r\nYou have no doubt been wondering how an officer so valuable for his proper and most important duties came to\r\nbe engaged in one of the landing parties. One asks with some\r\nindignation and a bitter literalness, Que (Liable allait-il faire\r\ndans cette galere ? No authoritative explanation is likely to\r\nbe obtainable, and we can only suppose that it was a case\r\nof sheer necessity. Similar things have happened before,\r\nand will, I imagine, happen again. It is small comfort\r\nfor those who mourn for him, though it says much for our Naval Service, that, as is shown by our later submarine successes in Turkish waters, his command has\r\nevidently passed into no less able hands.\r\nz\r\n358 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\r\nI have said thus much of this officer\u2014and I would also\r\nremind you of Captain Esmond's opinion on the matter and\r\nof Mr. Knox's remark on the removal to the transport\r\nin order that it may be clearly seen how little reason,\r\nhumanly speaking, Mrs. Pownall had for supposing her\r\nhusband would be in any special danger at the Dardanelles\r\nand how she was least of all justified by any ordinary\r\ncalculation of probabilities in her conviction that he had\r\ndied as one of a landing party. . We have now to return to Malta. Mrs. Pownall spent\r\nthe earlier part of the evening of April 25 (the day of\r\nthe death and of her impression concerning it) alone in\r\nthe house ; she had allowed her maids to go out, and\r\nthere are no children. She was sometimes on the first floor and sometimes on the second, but on whichever\r\nfloor she might be, she heard from time to time footsteps\r\non the floor below ; the impression was of human footsteps, but she did not otherwise distinguish them. She\r\nwent down three times to search but found no one. Becoming uneasy, she went out and induced a friend,\r\nMme Davie, to come and spend the evening with her.\r\nShe did not mention the footsteps to her, nor her\r\nconviction of her husband's death, but Mme Davie\r\nalso heard footsteps and also searched twice for an explanation in vain. A letter has been written to the lady,\r\nasking for her confirmation on this point, but no answer\r\nhas been received. Mrs. Pownall thinks she must have left Malta.\r\nIn London on this same night a dream was dreamed which\r\nonly perversity, as it seems to me, could dissociate from Mrs.\r\nPownall's distress at her husband's death, of which she had\r\nbecome so strangely convinced. Before relating the dream\r\nI should state that the \" John \" who appears in it is a brother of Mrs. Pownall who died in Sumatra in September, 1914. In view of the experiences accumulated in this\r\npaper, it is somewhat remarkable that Mrs. Pownall had\r\nno premonition of her brother's death nor any telepathic\r\nimpression of any kind in connexion with it, although he\r\nwas her favourite brother and there was a strong mutual\r\naffection between them. The dream occurred to a sister\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 359\r\nof Mrs. Pownall, Mrs. Grenfell White, and the following is her account of it, with her husband's confirmation.\r\nNovember 6, 1915.\r\nOn a Sunday night last April I dreamt that I saw Vera [Mrs\r\nGeorge Pownall] crying dreadfully, and I saw John very plainly,\r\nand he said to Vera, ' I wish T could speak to you, but I\r\ncan't.' When I woke up I said to my husband, ' I knoiv something has happened to George '\r\n; and I then went on to\r\nurge him very strongly to remember what I was going to tell him, and in particular to remember that I had told him before\r\nwe had any knowledge that my forebodings were true. I then\r\ntold him my dream, and my insistence made him remember the\r\ncircumstances clearly. We afterwards learned that George was\r\nin fact killed on that Sunday. I had not previously dreamt\r\nabout John since his death in September 1914.\r\n(Signed) Thomasine Grenfell White.\r\n155 Sloane St., London.\r\nNovember 6, 1915.\r\nThe above is a true account of what occurred.\r\n(Signed) W. Grenfell White.\r\nOn the following day, Monday, April 26, although Mrs.\r\nPownall's impression of her husband's death was less\r\npainfully vivid, the conviction was as strong as ever,\r\nand she proceeded to tear up papers and letters and do\r\nother things which she would not otherwise have done,\r\nin view of an early return to England. She actually told\r\nher maid that she would have no further need of her services.\r\nOn the next night, Tuesday, somewhere about midnight\r\nshe suddenly woke up in bed, and after a tew minutes heard\r\nfootsteps in the street below. Her first thought was that\r\nit was Captain Esmond bringing her the news as he had\r\npromised, and she felt relieved when the steps went past\r\nthe house. This feeling, however, was followed by the\r\n'thought, \" He will not come ; Mrs. Limpus [wife of\r\nAdmiral Limpus] will bring me the news.\"\r\nOn the Wednesday morning Mrs. Pownall went out into\r\nthe town, and on her return at 1 o'clock found Mrs.\r\nLimpus waiting for her with a telegram confirming all\r\n360 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\r\nthis sad foreknowledge. The telegram ran as follows : \" Pownall killed 25th beach party. [Knox.] \" Soon after\r\nthis she received a note from Captain Esmond saying he\r\nwas very sorry that he had been unavoidably prevented\r\nfrom fulfilling his promise to bring the news himself. As\r\nyou will remember from his statement, he also called at\r\n2 o'clock.\r\nMrs. Pownall left for England on Monday, May 3, 1915,\r\nand there was a curious premonition in connexion with her\r\ndeparture. The boats, which go weekly, normally come\r\ninto Malta and leave again after a stay of a few hours. Mrs.\r\nPownall had expected to leave on Tuesday, May 4, but\r\nCaptain Esmond had told her that the boat had been\r\ndelayed and would not come till the Thursday. Onwaking on Monday morning at about 7.30 she felt con- vinced that the boat would leave at 11 o'clock that day,\r\nand at once got up and made preparations to start.\r\nShe usually got up between 9 and 10, after breakfasting\r\nin bed. At 9.30 she received a note from Captain Esmond\r\ntelling her that the boat would leave at 11 that day, and\r\nshe started by it at that hour. In peace time the boat\r\nwas accustomed to leave in the afternoon, but after the\r\noutbreak of the war, according to Mrs. Pownall's recollection, the hour varied. I do not know at what hour the\r\nboat came in on the morning in question, but I can think\r\nof no normal means by which Mrs. Pownall, lying in bed\r\nin her house, could become aware of its arrival, or indeed\r\nof the arrival of any ship. Captain Esmond writes to methat he cannot remember anything in connexion with this\r\nincident beyond the broad fact that \" the boat arrived\r\ntwo or three days before she was expected and upset all the arrangements.\" This, however, is fortunately all the\r\ncorroboration we require.\r\nOn reaching England, Mrs. Pownall went to her parents\r\nin Devonshire, and stayed with them for about ten days.\r\nAt this time she had not been informed whether her\r\nhusband had been wounded in the head or in the body,\r\nnor whether he had or had not died instantaneously ; but\r\nshe told her mother, while on this visit, that she was sure he had been shot in the back and had not died at once.\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 361\r\nHer mother has only a vague recollection of this, but Mrs.\r\nPownall is positive on all three points. Some time in\r\nJune she received a letter, dated May 31, from the\r\nChaplain on board the transport, informing her that Lieut .- Commander Pownall had been wounded in the back and\r\nhad lingered a few hours. She had not written to any one\r\nfor information on the point, and this was the first that had\r\nreached her. Before receiving this letter, Mrs. Pownall had\r\nreceived two others from the Dardanelles, one from an\r\nofficer and one from an able seaman, but neither made any\r\nreference to the locality of the wound.\r\nThe next three experiences I give in Mrs. Pownall's own\r\nwords. She made no contemporary notes, but says that\r\nher recollection is clear.\r\nOctober, 1915.\r\nIn July 1915 I was staying at Eastbourne with Miss Bayfield, who was driving a motor ambulance in the neighbourhood.\r\nMr. [R. E. Knox] was also there on leave, expecting a fresh\r\nappointment. One day I told him he would get his appointment on such and such a day, naming a day of the week four\r\ndays ahead. I remember counting the days as they went by.\r\nHe obtained his appointment on the day I named.\r\n(Signed) Vera Pownall.\r\nMr. Knox has sent the following confirmation of ithis, and\r\nfortunately has been able to supply the dates :\r\nIn July 1915 I was on leave at Eastbourne and was expecting an appointment. On Friday 30th July Mrs. Pownall\r\ntold me I should be appointed on the following Tuesday, which\r\nproved true. (Signed) B. E. Knox.\r\nI now come to another little incident which may readily\r\nbe accepted, though from the nature of the case corroboration is impossible.\r\nOctober, 1915.\r\nOne morning in October 1915 my copy of the Times had\r\nbeen brought up to me as usual while I was in bed, and was\r\nlying near me where the maid had placed it, folded as it always is, with the front page outside. I had not myself\r\n362 Rev. M. A. Bayfield, [PART\r\ntouched it. Just as I was about to take it up I had the\r\nimpression that I should find among the casualties the name\r\nof Major Ash, of the Middlesex Regiment, as either killed or wounded. On opening the paper and looking down the casualty\r\nlists I found his name among the wounded. I did not know\r\nMajor Ash well, having only met him at Malta two or three\r\ntimes, and I had no particular interest in him, though I knew\r\nMrs. Ash fairly well while we were both at Malta. I had had\r\na letter from her some three months before this. I had not\r\nbeen thinking of Major or Mrs. Ash, and I did not know\r\nwhether he was on the Western Front or at the Dardanelles,\r\nor indeed where he was.\r\n(Signed) Vera Pownall.\r\nThe next incident also occurred in October, 1915. I\r\nshould state that my daughter has for the last two months\r\nbeen temporarily living with Mrs. Pownall in London. I\r\ngive the story as written down at their dictation, beginning with Mrs. Pownall's account :\r\nAt about 7.15 p.m. on October 12, 1915, at my flat in\r\nLondon, I made the following note on the back of a tradesman's bill:\u2014'I feel that there will be a Zep. raid to-night or to-morrow at 9.45 p.m. V. Pownall. Oct. 12.' For the rest\r\nof that day the matter was entirely absent from my mind.\r\nOn October 13 Miss Bayfield and Mr. [J. Knox, Mr. R. E. Knox's]\r\nbrother, dined with me at the flat at 7.15. During dinner I found it strangely difficult to collect and control my thoughts\r\nand seemed to myself to be in a state of suppressed excitement\r\nand expectancy, but I was expecting nothing in particular. I\r\ndid not think of Zeppelins, and I had entirely forgotten the\r\nmemorandum written on the previous evening. No thought\r\nof Zeppelins occurred to me until we were standing outside in\r\nthe street at about 5 minutes past 8, when Miss Bayfield said,\r\n' What a lovely night for Zeppelins !\r\n' The night was clear and\r\nstill. Even then I did not think of my note. When we heard\r\nthe first bomb dropped on London that evening we were in\r\na theatre ; I at once remembered my memorandum and looked\r\nat my watch, which gave the time as 9.40. My watch loses\r\nabout 5 minutes each day, and I regulate it every morning\r\nat about 9.30 by the clock on the Great Central Hotel, which\r\nLxxrv.] Recent Gases of Premonition and Telepathy. 363\r\nI can see from my windows.

During dinner I noticed that\r\nVera seemed extraordinarily distraite and preoccupied. More\r\nthan once she did not reply when we spoke to her, and she\r\nseemed to pay imperfect attention to what was going on. Also\r\nshe talked little. All this was quite unusual with her, especially\r\nat dinner and when entertaming guests. I said to her something to the following effect, ' What is the matter with you ? I never knew you so vague !\r\n' She replied, ' I feel something is going to happen.' [' When I said this I did not think of\r\nZeppelins.' Vera Pownall.] I said, ' What ?\r\n' She answered\r\nthat she did not know. I then said, ' To whom ?\r\n' and she\r\nsaid, ' To all of us.' I said, ' When ?\r\n' and she replied ' Oh,\r\nsoon ' [meaning, as Mrs. Pownall has explained, within a day or\r\nso]. Then she apologised for being ' so vague,' and we all laughed about it. After dinner we were going to a theatre. When Mrs. Pownall\r\nand I were putting on our things I said to her, ' Is it going to\r\nhappen to you or me ? ', and she replied, ' Oh no ; we are all\r\nin it.' Either now or earlier I said to her, ' Is it something\r\nawful ? ', and she answered, ' No.'\r\nWhile we were at the theatre we heard the bombs, and at the\r\nsound of the first or second Vera said to me, ' I wrote that down\r\nyesterday and put it in my dressing-table drawer.'

I may add\r\nthat the newspapers of October 12, 1915, so far as I am\r\naware, contained no warning of a Zeppelin raid, and the\r\nlast previous raid\u2014the only one that had been made on\r\nLondon\u2014took place more than a month before, on\r\nSeptember 8. The last case which I have to bring before you occurred\r\nten days ago, November 12, 1915. The following is Mrs.\r\nPownall's account of it :\r\nNovember 13th, 1915.\r\nYesterday morning, when I began to read the paper, I had it fixed in my mind that I should see \" British Submarine Lost \",\r\nand I hunted through the paper expecting to see something\r\nabout it, but found nothing. A Commander from the Admiralty\r\ncame to luncheon, and at lunch I said to Cyrille and him,\r\n\" Did I dream it or did I see in yesterday's or to-day's paper\r\nthat a British submarine had been lost ? Was it in any\r\npaper ? \" The Commander said, \" No,\" and also Cyrille. This\r\nmorning, shortly after 12 o'clock, I saw a poster, \" British\r\nSubmarine Lost. Official.\" We bought a Pall Mall and found\r\nit was true. (Signed) Vera Pownall.\r\nMiss Bayfield writes : November 13th, 1915.\r\nI have read Mrs. George Pownall's statement about the British\r\nsubmarine, the loss of which was first reported in to-day's\r\nevening papers, and certify that it is a true statement in\r\nevery detail.\r\n(Signed) Cyrille Bayfield.\r\nCommander B. E. Remold, R.N., writes :\r\nNovember 11th, 1915.\r\nOn Friday last, November 12, I lunched with Mrs. George\r\nPownall and Miss Bayfield at 2m Hyde Park Mansions, and I\r\nremember that at lunch Mrs. Pownall said something to the\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 365\r\nfollowing effect : \u2014\" Did I dream it or did I see it in yesterday's or to-day's paper that a British submarine had been\r\nlost ? \" I also remember that Miss Bayfield and I replied that\r\nthere had been no such announcement in the papers.\r\n(Signed) B. E. Reinold, Comr.R.N.\r\nThis brings me to the end of my story, but if you are not\r\nalready wearied, I should like to add a few remarks on some\r\nof the incidents\u2014offering, perhaps, by the way, a few targets\r\nfor the discussion which I hope will follow.\r\nA resolute critic, unconvinced even of telepathy, might\r\ndismiss this somewhat remarkable series of predictions as merely so many examples of chance-coincidence, accounting\r\nperhaps for their number by a reference to the extraordinary runs on the red or the black at Monte Carlo,\r\nand to other similar phenomena. I must confess that\r\nsuch a view would seem to me to be a fresh illustration\r\nof the surprising credulity of the incredulous, who, rather\r\nthan accept a new truth which conflicts with their prepossessions, are ready to believe the incredible. The simplicity which would believe that we have here to do with\r\nnothing but chance, would appear to be capable of believing anything. This explanation, then, I unhesitatingly\r\ndismiss, and seek further afield.\r\nSeveral of the incidents are obviously explicable by telepathy between the living, and may be considered to\r\nstrengthen the evidence for it\u2014perhaps to extend our\r\nconception of it. Three others\u2014Admiral Garden's appointment, the despatch of the submarines, and the Zeppelin:\r\nraid\u2014may be so explained, if we make certain assumptions ;; but of the premonition of the visit of Mrs. Limpus and some\r\npoints of detail in other cases telepathy seems to me to offer\r\nno explanation at all. To take first the hallucination at Harwich, we may\r\nsuppose that Lieut.-Commander Pownall, being compelled\r\nto leave his newly married wife alone for most of the\r\nday, was always desirous of returning home as soon as\r\nhis duties permitted. He might often, consciously or unconsciously, while in the midst of his work picture\r\nhimself so returning. On this particular afternoon a\r\n366 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\r\nthought of the kind\u2014perhaps a\r\n\" high-explosive \" one, so\r\nto speak, caused by an apparent chance of an early\r\nreturn afterwards found to be no chance\u2014may have\r\ncaught Mrs. Pownali at a favourable moment, and the\r\nvisual hallucination was the result. One only wonders\r\nwhy hallucinations of this kind do not occur more often.\r\nTelepathy will explain the dream about Admiral Carden's\r\nappointment, if we make a wild and quite gratuitous\r\nassumption. The dream, you remember, occurred about\r\nAugust 12, 1914. Now, the Goeben and Breslau reached\r\nConstantinople on August 10, and their escape caused\r\nmuch irritation in this country. At the Admiralty and\r\nin Government circles the irritation was no doubt acute.\r\nIt is conceivable\u2014I do not venture to say that it is more\r\nthan conceivable\u2014that someone then in high office, whose\r\nname I forbear even to guess, under the stimulus of this\r\nirritating disappointment, flashed out a very highly explosive thought the impact of which was felt as far as Malta \u2014the thought being something like this, \"X. must be\r\nrecalled, and Carden must have the Mediterranean command ! \" Whether the thought was justifiable or not of course I do not discuss, and it does not matter ; nor does\r\nit matter that the change (which, as we know, was\r\nactually made) did not take place till more than five\r\nweeks after the date of the dream. This audacious suggestion is, of course, a mere fancy, but it is the best I can myself make in the interests of telepathy. On its merits I attach small value to it, and I have reasons for\r\nbelieving it to be improbable. I am not at liberty to\r\nimpart these reasons, but those of you who have friends\r\nin naval circles will perhaps be able to obtain information\r\nfrom which you can form your own opinion on the\r\nmatter.\r\nSimilarly, the dispatch of the submarines could be explained\r\nby telepathy from the Admiralty, if the step was decided\r\nupon there at a sufficiently early date. Perhaps we may\r\nsome day be allowed to learn how this was ; but in\r\nview of the fact that the flotilla was ordered to leave at\r\nsome twenty-four hours' notice, it does not seem likely that\r\nthe matter was discussed and decided in London more\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 367\r\nthan a day or two before. Otherwise one would have\r\nexpected longer notice to be given.\r\nThe incidents of the steamer, the wounding of Major Ash,\r\nand the loss of the British submarine obviously suggest a\r\ntelepathic explanation, since in each case some one knew\r\nthe facts before they reached Mrs. Pownall. With regard\r\nto Mr. Knox's appointment also, it is possible that somebody at the Admiralty thought the thought, \"in 3 days'\r\ntime we shall send Mr. Knox notice of his appointment.\"\r\nAll the same, both the thought itself and the transference\r\nof just that thought on a trivial matter are not easy to\r\nexplain. As to Mrs. Grenfell White's dream, which is veridical on the only point that we can test \u2014Mrs. Pownall's distress, telepathy, while it accounts for the knowledge of her grief, does not account for the presence of\r\nthe brother. Nor does it account for the mysterious\r\nfootsteps heard in the house at Malta the same evening,\r\nwhich in view of the dream, it does not seem merely\r\nfanciful to connect with him\u2014unless we are to connect\r\nthem with the husband. I do not mean that a spirit's\r\nfootsteps may be audible ; but I can imagine that if my\r\nsubliminal consciousness receives the impression of a spirit's\r\npresence or influence (I do not know what word to use),\r\nthe impression might emerge in the vague form of an\r\nhallucination of the sound of footsteps.1 With regard to the Zeppelin raid, we may say, if we\r\nlike, that Mrs. Pownall obtained her information from the\r\nGermans in Belgium who were planning it. At first blush\r\nthat may seem easy ; but we must remember that the\r\nonly rapport between them is a violent mutual repulsion,\r\n1 It was suggested by a speaker at the meeting that the hearing of footsteps may have been the result of expectation, but the suggestion seems altogether gratuitous. Why should there be any such expectation ? Mrs. Pownall had never before had this hallucination, though she had\r\nfrequently been alone in the house in the evening, and convinced as she was of her husband's death, one would suppose that the last thing she\r\nwould expect would be to hear his footsteps ; moreover, she did not\r\ndistinguish them as a man's footsteps. It may be added that Lieut.\r\n\r\nCommander Pownall had never lived in this house ; Mrs. Pownall moved\r\ninto it after he left Malta. Mme Davie had not been told about the\r\nfootsteps before she thought she heard them herself, so that in her case\r\nit is equally difficult to imagine why she should expect to hear them.\r\n368 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\r\nand the production of rapport by repulsion seems unlikely.\r\nMoreover, as these Germans presumably thought in German\r\nand Mrs. Pownall's knowledge of that language is extremely\r\nslight and (as I have proved by experiment) quite insufficient to understand such a message as might be presumed,1 one must ask how it came to be so conveniently\r\ntranslated in transit. Or can such a thought (all the\r\nconcepts which it embraces being familiar to the receiver)\r\nbe transmitted from mind to mind, without the employment of language ? I am disposed to think that this may\r\nbe so, although, so far as I am aware, we have no\r\nrecorded example of telepathy between people who do not\r\nunderstand each other's language. Even so, however, not\r\nall our difficulties are removed. How are we to explain\r\nMrs. Pownall's precise knowledge of the hour of the raid ? On the telepathic hypothesis, the enemy proposed to himself to drop his first bomb on London at 9.45 ; but if he\r\ndid, we know enough of aerial navigation to be able to\r\nsay that he was highly unlikely to keep to his time-table\r\nwith such astonishing precision. In this case, therefore,\r\ntelepathy cannot, I think, be lightly allowed to have the\r\nlast word.2 The knowledge of her husband's death may well have been\r\napprehended by Mrs. Pownall telepathically ; the impression\r\nmay have been subliminally received at the moment of death,\r\nto emerge in some mysterious way through the handling\r\nof the letter. There is, however, one point in this painful\r\nepisode which telepathy does not wholly explain.\r\n1 In the following sentence, \" Ein Viertel vor zehn werden wir iiber London ankommen,\" the only word translated was -iiber.\r\n2 An article in the Observer of October 3 contained the following\r\nparagraph : \" Sunset coming earlier, the hours of the possible arrival of German\r\nairships over London is put forward, and this month we may expect\r\nthem as earlj. as 10 p.m. In November, December, and January, they\r\nmight in certain conditions get here before 9.30 p.m. ; and, other things\r\nbeing equal, they will be a trifle less particular about the amount and\r\ndirection of the wind during the winter, for they will have a greater\r\nduration of dark hours for the job.\" Mrs. Pownall takes the Observer\r\nand it must therefore be presumed that she read this article ; but even\r\nso we are not much helped. The impression was not received until 10 days later, and \" as early as 10 p.m.\" does not suggest 9.45.\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 369\r\nMrs. Pownall appears to have known for many months\r\nthat her husband would be killed at the Dardanelles, and\r\nalso, as I incline to think, that it would be on a Sunday.\r\nAt any rate, she was possessed by an unshakable conviction on the former point, and the conviction was justified\r\nby the event. She did not, I believe, consciously expect\r\nthat he would die on a Sunday, but her remarkable\r\ndepressions on Sundays look like the formless emergence of a subliminal impression to that effect.1 The depressions were peculiarly distressing and usually culminated in\r\nweeping. They began when she woke in the morning,\r\npassed off towards midday, and returned about tea-time.\r\nNothing at ail like them occurred on other days, and\r\nduring the week, but for the one great trouble, Mrs.\r\nPownall preserved her normal cheerfulness. Of course, there\r\nare countless instances of people saying that they are\r\n\" convinced \" they will never see someone dear to them,\r\nbut they do not mean more than that they greatly\r\nfear it will be so. Mrs. Pownall's other veridical predictions\r\nseem to forbid us to regard the present case as one of\r\nmere forboding, and she herself absolutely refuses to regard\r\nit as such. Every prediction of the future must be considered on its merits and in its own setting, and having\r\nregard to all the circumstances, I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat we have not here a case of actual foreknowledge.\r\nWith every desire to show common sense, I am unable to\r\naccept accidental coincidence as a satisfactory explanation\r\nof the facts. But if it is a case of foreknowledge,\r\nhow are we to account for it ? I can imagine three\r\n1 Dr. Wingfield once told me of a patient, a young lady, who for a long\r\ntime had refused to go out of the house for fear that something dreadful\r\nwould happen to her, she knew not what. Suspecting this vague fear to be the emergence of something more definite in the subliminal, he\r\nhypnotised her and told her to dream of the thing she was afraid of. On waking her, he bade her make notes of her dreams and bring the\r\nnotes to him. She brought notes of some half-dozen, of which he\r\nselected one. The dream was of an incident in a story she had read when a\r\nchild : a girl, whose friends wished to get hold of her money, had been taken\r\nout and driven off to a lunatic asylum. Put into the trance again, the\r\npatient now confessed that the fear that this might happen to herself was the cause of her unwillingness to go out of doors. With this knowJedge the cure was simple and was immediately effected.\r\n370 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\r\npossible views, and someone may suggest a fourth or more.\r\nFirstly, we may suppose the information to have been\r\nconveyed by a spirit who had knowledge of the future.\r\nSecondly, we may suppose that the mind can of itself,\r\nand on its own initiative, travel into a world of thought\r\nwhere there ib no past or future\u2014where all that is, all\r\nthat has been, all that is to be, is equally known and\r\nknowable. Thirdly, there is a supposition which those\r\nwho find it difficult to believe that we on earth ever come\r\ninto contact with a spirit world, would perhaps prefer\r\nto either of these two. We may suppose that a man in\r\nperfect health may by some mysterious means come to\r\nhave, consciously or subliminally, a foreknowledge of the\r\nvery day of his death many months before it takes place \u2014and that, although his death is to be a violent one, and\r\nnot due to some disease whose rudimentary existence the\r\nsubliminal may be supposed to be capable of noting, while\r\nit is also able to forecast and to time with accuracy its fatal development. We may suppose that Lieut. -Commander Pownall had this foreknowledge and was unable\r\nto prevent the communication of it telepathically to his\r\nwife. This idea is not to be hastily rejected ; but it must be admitted that it transcends normal experience\r\nquite as outrageously as does the idea of communication\r\nwith a spirit world, or that of our ability to penetrate\r\ninto a world of thought such as I have suggested ; moreover, it lacks at present any substantial support. It is,\r\nhowever, the explanation offered by Professor Flournoy of a case of foreknowledge of death from disease described\r\nin his book Esprits et Mediums. That case, which is very\r\nwell attested, is so remarkable that I gave a summary of\r\nit in a review of the book in Vol. XXV. of the Proceedings. Since it may be thought to lend some support\r\nto this last theory, I will give a bare outline of the story\r\nhere. For convenience, I accord the dates to the Russian\r\ncalendar, which is twelve days behind ours. A certain Mme Buscarlet of Geneva, after acting for\r\nthree years as governess to the two little daughters of\r\nM. and Mme Moratief at Kasan in Russia, returned to\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 371\r\nGeneva in August, 1883. At Kasan she became acquainted\r\nwith a Mme Nitchinof and a Mile Olga Popo'i. Mme\r\nNitchinof was headmistress of the Institut Imperial at\r\nKasan, a school which Mme Moratief's daughters began\r\nto attend after Mme Buscarlet's departure, and she and\r\nher husband were intimate friends of the Moratiefs. On\r\nDecember 10 (our 22nd) Mme Buscarlet wrote a letter to\r\nMme Moratief, but did not post it till the 12th, and it reached Kasan on the 20th. Professor Flournoy saw both\r\nthe letter and the envelope with the Geneva and Kasan\r\npostmarks. After about a page of Christmas greetings,\r\nthe letter goes on as follows. It is written in French, but\r\nI translate, omitting all that is not essential.\r\nLast night I had an absurd dream. . . . You and I were on\r\na country road, when there passed in front of us a carriage\r\nfrom which came a voice calling you. When we got to the\r\ncarriage we saw Mile Olga Popo'i lying stretched across it inside,\r\ndressed in white and wearing a cap trimmed with yellow ribbons.\r\n[Mme Buscarlet told Professor Floumoy that the cap also was\r\nwhite, and that she had seen the body of a lady invested for\r\nburial in this manner in Russia.] She said to you, ' I have\r\ncalled you in this manner to tell you that Mme Nitchinof leaves\r\nthe Institute on the 17th.' The carriage then drove on. How\r\nludicrous dreams are sometimes.\r\nAfter this the letter turns to other subjects.\r\nIn a letter written in reply and dated Kasan, December 20 (the day on which Mme Buscarlet's letter arrived),\r\nM. Moratief wrote to Mme Buscarlet that he and his wife\r\nhad dined at Mme Nitchinof 's house on the 13th, which\r\nwas four days after the dream. After dinner Mme Nitchinof felt unwell, but a doctor who arrived immediately\r\ndiagnosed nothing more than an ordinary slight sore-throat\r\n(une simple et legere angine). On the 14th and 15th the\r\ndoctors, three in number, failed to find anything alarming,\r\nand only on the morning of the 16th was the illness\r\nrecognised as scarlet fever. At 5 p.m. on that day the\r\npatient could hardly speak, and at 11.45 the same night she\r\ndied. For fear of infection, the body was removed from\r\nthe school to a neighbouring chapel at 2 a.m. on the 17th.\r\n372 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\r\nThus Mme Nitchinof did indeed \" leave the Institute \" on\r\nthe 17th. Mile Olga Popoi's intrusion into the dream is unexplained\r\n.\r\nThere remains one final puzzle. If Mrs. Pownall had\r\nexpected that official news of her husband's death would\r\nbe sent to Admiral Limpus, she might naturally suppose\r\nthat it would be brought on to her by Mrs. Limpus.\r\nQuestioned on this point Mrs. Pownall wrote : \"I could\r\nnot possibly have expected Admiral or Mrs. Limpus to\r\nbring me the news. Official news of the death of a Naval\r\n\u2022officer always comes straight from the Admiralty to the\r\nwife or nearest relative. About a fortnight after George\r\nwas killed I had a letter from the Admiralty telling me of\r\nhis death. I arranged with Mr. [Knox] that, should anything happen to George, he was to send a telegram to\r\nCaptain [Esmond].\" Now, Mr. Knox's private telegram to\r\nCaptain Esmond arrived in Malta at noon on the Wednesday,\r\nand until a few minutes after that no one on earth could\r\nknow by any normal means, nor even by telepathy, that the\r\nnews would be brought to Mrs. Pownall by Mrs. Limpus.\r\nHer intervention was the outcome of an accident which\r\ndid not happen till noon on that day. How, then, could\r\nMrs. Pownall know of it twelve hours before ? The following considerations, which I present because they\r\noccurred to me and might be thought to touch the point,\r\nreally afford no solution of the mystery. In asking Captain\r\nEsmond to \" bring her the official news \" Mrs. Pownall\r\nseems to have had some dim notion that it might be\r\nofficially telegraphed to Malta direct from the Dardanelles,\r\nthough on a moment's reflection she would have remembered that headquarters authorities communicate casualties\r\nonly to the Admiralty or the War Office. She was well\r\naware of this. Such a telegram, if sent\u2014though passing,\r\nas did all official telegrams, through Captain Esmond's\r\nhands\u2014would have been addressed, she thinks, to Admiral\r\nLimpus. She tells me she never thought of this until I\r\nquestioned her on the point ; her only thought was that\r\nCaptain Esmond was always the first recipient of official\r\nnews, and she had forgotten for the moment her arrangement with Mr. Knox. Moreover, even if it had occurred\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 373\r\nto her that an official telegram from the Dardanelles would\r\nbe addressed to the Admiral, she would not have thought\r\nof Mrs. Limpus as a possible messenger ; she would have\r\nfelt sure that Captain Esmond, when forwarding the telegram to the Admiral, would at the same time inform him\r\nthat he had promised to break the news to her himself,\r\nif it should come.\r\nNOTE.\r\nNovember 22, 1915.\r\nI have read Mr. Bayfield's paper, and declare that it faithfully describes my experiences and the facts connected with\r\nthem.\r\n(Signed) Vera Pownall.\r\nADDENDUM.\r\nThe reproduction of the foregoing paper in the Proceedings affords me the opportunity of adding the following\r\nletter, written to me by my daughter and received on\r\nJanuary 21, 1917.\r\n2m Hyde Park Mansions, W.\r\nJanuary 20, 1917.\r\nYou will, I am sure, be interested in the following peculiar\r\nbehaviour on Vera's part on the last 3 evenings, 17th to 19th\r\ninclusive.\r\nOn the 17th, between tea and dinner, she felt very breathless with heart palpitations, combined with a great depression\r\nand a feeling of vagueness, which passed off when she went\r\nto bed. On the 18th she had been to tea with Mrs. Pownall\r\n[Mrs. Vera Pownall's mother-in-law], and felt ill and had heart\r\npalpitation there. She returned here between 6.0 and 6.30,\r\nand felt her heart [disturbed] again and was very depressed\r\nindeed. She tried to rouse herself and throw it off, but\r\nthough the palpitation passed, the depression did not, and I\r\npersuaded her to go to bed. She kept saying she felt her\r\nmemory was going, and that she felt so vague and stupid.\r\nAfter dinner in bed she was better, and the depression passed\r\nand she slept well.\r\n2 A\r\n374 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\r\nLast night, the 19th, we had tea about 5.0 and then I wrote\r\nsome letters in my room. About 6.0 I went into the drawingroom and found V. lying on the sofa in the most extraordinary\r\nstate of depression. I have never seen her like it before. She\r\nsaid she couldn't throw it off. She had tried to read, and to\r\nwrite a letter, but found it impossible. She said she felt so vague, and that everything she said and did was mechanical ; that she didn't feel as if she was herself at all, but someone\r\nelse. She said she felt as if she might go melancholy mad.\r\nShe then said she felt very much as she had at that time in\r\nMalta when George died,\u2014very receptive, and all noises seemed\r\nlouder, and little things made her jump. I put it all down to\r\nher being in a, low state of health, though I thought it strange\r\nthat all the rest of the days, until after tea, she was in excellent spirits and feeling much better for her massage.\r\nWhen she said she felt as she had in Malta and very receptive, I said,, \" Perhaps you are going to get something [meaning\r\nsome supernormal communication]. What a pity you don't\r\nfeel the war is going to end, or the Town Hall in Berlin is going to be blown up ! \" Not many minutes after this this dreadful explosion [the\r\nSilvertown explosion of Jan. 19, 1917] took place. It was like a huge gun going off, and as we rushed to V.'s window [that\r\nis, her bedroom window, which affords a wider view than the\r\ndrawing-room], I said, \" That will take you out of yourself.\"\r\nWe did not hear any definite news at once, but after the\r\nexplosion Vera said she felt as if some great load had been\r\nlifted from her mind, the feeling of relief was so great.\r\nI was not at all frightened, as I knew by the sound that it was not very near ; but later V. told me that she had never had such a feeling of fright in all the Zepp. raids we've been\r\nin, and she felt quite sure she was going to be killed,\u2014that\r\nthe roof might fall in or the walls. I gather that this feeling\r\nonly lasted a moment or two, and then she felt as if she was\r\nherself again and no longer vague at all, though rather shaken\r\nand very tired. I think she was almost on the verge of being\r\nin a trance.\r\nThis is a very lengthy story, but I felt sure you would be\r\ninterested, as I don't see how her health accounts for the\r\nmost peculiar state she has been in for the last 3 evenings,\r\nlxxiv.] Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 375\r\nnever till between tea and dinner, and feeling worse between\r\n6.0 and 7.0\u2014and the explosion was about 6.30 or 6.45.\r\nThis evening she is quite normal and not at all depressed, and\r\nit is now past 6.40 p.m.\r\nShe also told me later, that before the explosion she felt she was going to be killed, but did not tell me for fear of\r\nalarming me, as she was not thinking of it all from a psychic point of view.\r\n(Signed) Cyrille Bayfield.\r\nOf the last sentence, which the writer's haste has left\r\nsomewhat obscure, I have received the following explanation. Mrs. Pownall felt so ill that she thought she was\r\ngoing to die of this mysterious illness. This feeling, with\r\nan inconsistency which she did not perceive, was combined\r\nwith a conviction that something dreadful was going to\r\nhappen and that she would be killed. She did not feel, as in\r\nthe case of her premonition of her husband's death, that her\r\ncondition was due to an external cause. If she had told my\r\ndaughter that she felt she was going to die, the latter would\r\nnaturally have been much alarmed. If, on the other hand,\r\nshe had thought her depression was premonitory, say, of\r\nan air-raid, and that it was from this that she might\r\nperish, she would have mentioned the fact ; but that idea never occurred to her.\r\nThe incident is not necessarily evidential, but it seems\r\nstriking enough to deserve recording in connexion with\r\nthose which precede it. Too many loincidences spoil the\r\nsceptic broth.\r\nM. A. Bayfield.\r\n376 Jane Harrison. [part\r\nSUPPLEMENT.\r\nVII.\r\nIN MEMORIAM\u2014Mrs. A. W.

Margaret de Gaudrion Merrifield came up to NewnhamCollege in 1877, the year of the opening of Old Hall.\r\nAs Student, Lecturer, Associate, Member of Council, constant\r\nfriend, her connection with the College knew no break ; to\r\nthe generations to whom she cannot leave her memory she\r\nhas left a legacy of \u00a3500.\r\nOn her mother's side she came of French stock, and of\r\nher two-fold ancestry she was most justly proud. Throughout\r\nher life her attitude towards superstition, ancient and modern,\r\nwas not of protest and intolerance but of almost physical\r\nshrinking and disgust. I often tried to interest her in savage\r\nsuperstitions and rites \u2014she used to shudder and say, \" how\r\ncan you work at such things\u2014ugh.\" She lived through an\r\nage when obscurantism was rampant and her later work\r\nbrought her in intimate contact with charlatanism ; it brought\r\n1 The obituary notice of Mrs. Verrall, which has already appeared\r\nin Proceedings (Pt. LXXIL), was concerned almost entirely with her\r\nwork in psychical research, and it was thought that members of the\r\nS.P.R. would be interested to learn something of Mrs. Verrall from a more personal standpoint. We have to thank the Committee of the\r\nNewnham College Club for permission to reprint this article, written by\r\na college friend of Mrs. Verrall's for the Newnham College Letter for 1916.

A free-thinker\r\nin the full sense and a protestant against all superstition\r\nshe remained to the end.

I was\r\ntaking down names for a concert and I asked hers. \" Margaret de Gaudrion Merrifield \" she answered, with a polite\r\nand dignified little bend of the head. I looked at her with\r\nsome amusement\u2014she was so very, very young\u2014and said,\r\nmore because she attracted me and I wanted to talk to her,\r\nthan from any second-year brutality, \" I'm afraid I can't\r\nspell all that. Will M. de G. do ? \" The answer came with\r\nperfect good temper, \" 0, please, whatever is most convenient,\"\r\nand another little bow. At cocoa that night, in the college\r\nslang of the moment, we decided that young M. de G. had\r\n\" come to count.\" And count very much she soon did.\r\nHer education had been on the best modern lines of the\r\nday ; her father's private interests were scientific \u2014he was\r\na well-known naturalist\u2014she herself came up intending to\r\nread political economy and moral science. The family were\r\nintimate friends of the Fawcetts. Through long hours on\r\nthe window seat of my room we wrangled over ancient and\r\nmodern, and at last, though she knew little Latin and no\r\nGreek, she consented to try classics. I believe the heroic\r\ndifficulties tempted her adventurous spirit. Her place in the\r\nTripos, handicapped by lack of training as she was, showed\r\nher linguistic poAvers, and she never regretted her choice.\r\nNor could anyone regret it, for her classical training was\r\nthe basis of a high companionship in marriage. But I have\r\noften thought with some misgivings that I may have done\r\nan ill turn to science, and it was with real pleasure that I saw her later turn her eager, enquiring, and truly scientific\r\nmind on Psychical Research.\r\nAs a girl, what impressed her friends most in her was her-\r\n378 Jane Harrison. [part\r\nboundless, tireless life and vigour ; she was simply hungry\r\nfor work. A little knot of college friends used to discuss\r\nfuture careers and look over lists of appointments together.\r\nOne day she came on some toilsome post which she thought\r\nwould suit her. She read aloud the regulations and conditions,\r\nthen frowned suddenly and flung the paper away. \" Compulsory retirement at sixty ! Oh, that's no good.\" The\r\nstory caused Dr. Verrall perennial joy. \" That's May all over,\" he said, and \" compulsory retirement at sixty \" became\r\na household word.\r\nShe never then dreamt of Academic work, and was to the\r\nend never in spirit Academic. Her appointment as classical\r\nlecturer came as a surprise. I was her senior, and we had\r\noften talked over what the classical work was to be when\r\nI was appointed. Dis aliter visum. Never shall I forget\r\nher generous rage when she was pi eferred before her friend.\r\nShe came immediately up to London to see me, and literally\r\nstamped about the room, healing thereby her friend's hurt\r\nvanity. Then and then only did I see her thoroughly irrational. It was far into the night before I could persuade her that\r\nrefusal would be as useless as Quixotic. She, like Dr. Verrall,\r\nwas the staunchest of friends. Even the early years of the\r\nmarriage, which soon followed her appointment, never submerged friendship.\r\nAbout her teaching work, Miss Sharpley, who was in turn\r\nher pupil and her colleague and always her intimate friend,\r\nwrites : \" Mrs. Verrall held the post of resident lecturer in classics\r\nfrom 1880 until her marriage in 1882, and she continued\r\nto lecture for the College with intervals till shortly before\r\nher death. I think her most characteristic work was perhaps\r\ndone in the teaching commonly described as 'giving back\r\nthe Trinity papers.' Some of her pupils may have cavilled\r\nat the uncompromising blue pencil which paid no heed to the literal correctness of the translation they submitted, but\r\nto those who were capable of appreciating points of style\r\nthe painful process brought the joy of a new insight.

They were\r\nbeing dealt with as intellectually mature and the matter of\r\nreal scholarship was being put before them. Knowledge they\r\ncould lay no claim to was attributed to them. Her ' as\r\nof course you know ' was not ironical. One might look up\r\nto see if she was laughing, but no, she always meant it, and\r\none settled back into a larger self-respect. In discussion of\r\npoints and difficulties she would be swift and unqualified\r\nat first in her pronouncements, but ready instantly to place\r\nher mind at another's standpoint while they maintained a\r\ndifferent view from hers, and to allow it often more than\r\nits just value on the first impression.\r\nLatterly she had returned her teaching fees into the College\r\nfunds.\r\nHer work as examiner for the College in scholarship ex- aminations was excellent in method and reliability. It was\r\ntrenchant, clear-eyed and discriminating.\r\nShe was for many years a member of the meeting of\r\nClassical Lecturers, which sits at the end of each term to\r\ndiscuss plans and make arrangements for the next term's\r\nwork. As a Colleague she was business-like, unselfish and\r\nconvenient. There was never anyone less fussy\u2014never worried\r\nwith the tiresome, always above vexation and offence. As\r\nher service to the College as a teacher had its own distinction and has enriched the teaching tradition of Newnham,\r\nand is recognised with gratitude and admiration and with\r\nthe sense of a gap to be ever filled by something different, so too her contribution as a fellow lecturer had a special\r\nquality\u2014a quality, I think, of comfort and nobility, the\r\nwarm memory of which is a part of the possession she leaves\r\nto the College generations who have known and loved her.\"\r\nMiss Matthaei confirms Miss Sharpley's view. Mrs. Verrall\r\nshe found as a teacher very full, swift, and spite of her great\r\nswiftness always clear. She corrected very freely, never\r\ncontenting herself with the conventional depreciatory scratch.\r\nShe was quick to praise as well as to criticise, and specially\r\nappreciative of any evidence of style.\r\n380 Jane Harrison. [part\r\nWe called her \" M. de G.,\" and throughout her life M. de\r\nG. she always was, very French as well as English. If I\r\nunderstand and sympathise with our great Allies at all, it\r\nis mainly through her. Her Frenchness came out in small\r\nthings\u2014if they are small\u2014in her rather formal and always\r\nunfailing courtesy of manner. Of course we chaffed her\r\nwhen, on passing her best college friend, she would give a\r\npolite little bow. I believe she loyally tried \u2014but she never\r\ncould really master the cheery half-shamefaced grin which is among intimates our accepted English salutation. The war\r\nhit her hard on the French as well as the English side.\r\nThe suspense as to whether England would join in was anguish\r\nto her. Yet she kept careful guard over passion. She had\r\nreally no material for hate in her, nothing poisonous to fester ; but once she said to me, \" How dreadful it is ; if the war\r\ngoes on we may all come to hating the Germans.\" So French\r\nwas she that she never could really feel the perilous pomposities of the Latin idiom. At a Swiss table d'hote a French\r\nneighbour tried to sketch something for her with a blunt\r\npencil. \" Je ne demanderai mieux que de vous satisfaire,\r\nMadame, mais \"\u2014with a bow and an elegant wave of the\r\nstump of a pencil \u2014\" Vinstrument est rebelled Two unmannerly\r\nBritons hid their faces choking with suppressed laughter,\r\nwhy she could never qiute realise, but later on in the evening,\r\nwith her beautiful fairness and perfect good temper she said, \" I think I do understand a little what you two very foolish\r\npeople were laughing at.\"\r\nFrench she was also in big things, in fact in her whole\r\nmentality. There was about her personality an alertness, a clarity, a dexterity which left some of us with a feeling\r\nthat we were half-baked and wholly imfinished. I shall never forget the three weeks I spent with her pulling together\r\nthe MS. draft of our Mythology and Monuments of Ancient\r\nAthens. With characteristic alacrity and precision she said\r\nat the outset, \" I can give you three weeks, and we must\r\nfinish it up.\" In the little inn at Robin Hood's Bay, which\r\nto me now has its special sanctity, I laid before her a frightful tangled mass of material and, what is worse, conflicting\r\nopinion. She sifted it and sorted it, and saw through it with a swiftness that was then and is still to me little short\r\nlxxiv.] In Memoriam Mrs. A. W. Verrall. 381\r\nof miraculous. She dived into my mind, dredged up tangled\r\ndebris, and convicted me of only half-conscious confusions ; she insisted that decision was possible and must be made.\r\nOnce I remember her swiftness flurried me, and I said crossly, \" I wish to goodness you'd wait and let me make up my\r\nown mind.\" \" I should wait a long time,\" she said, and\r\nwe both burst out laughing.\r\nShe was one of the rare people who can really \" change\r\ntheir minds \" \u2014most of us slowly and painfully shift and\r\nadjust our prejudices \u2014I mean she really altered her views\r\nowing to the rational arguments that were presented to her.\r\nAnd this she could do with an astounding, kaleidoscopic\r\nswiftness that left many of us gaping and gasping. This\r\ncapacity for swift volte, face was disconcerting to the lobbyist.\r\nShe would promise her support to a measure and see reason\r\nto change her view at the last moment. The prudent lobbyist\r\ndid well to see her to the door of a committee-room, and\r\neven there she was not safe. So perfect was her own rectitude that, when she suddenly voted against your most cherished\r\nscheme, she confidently looked for your sympathy and approval.\r\nA generous confidence breeds generosity ; she was not often\r\ndisappointed.\r\nHer reasonableness was the more remarkable because she\r\nwas a person of rather violent prejudice, and this is not\r\nsupposed to go with reasonableness. Certain quite harmless\r\nweaknesses she could not tolerate \u2014notably any detailed\r\ndiscussion of food. This cannot be laid to the charge of\r\nher. French ancestry. \" How can you encourage that disgusting man ? \" she said to me almost angrily of an earnest diner\r\nat table-d'hote, whose single-hearted devotion to the menu,\r\nand whose missionary zeal for our conversion had rather\r\ntouched me. \" If you go on letting him talk about food\r\nI shall move our places.\" Often the prejudice was quite\r\nbaseless. \" No,\" she would say, \" I can't do with him ! don't ask me to like him ; he rubs me up the wrong way.\"\r\nWhen pressed for reason her French mind would hark round\r\nfor some small lack of tenue : he had lolled about on the\r\nsofa ; she had been met in the town without gloves ; but\r\nyou felt, and she often acknowledged, that it was just blind\r\ninstinctive prejudice. Yet with all this she somehow con-\r\n382 Jane Harrison. [part\r\ntrived\u2014and it was a great strength, though also a slight\r\nweakness\u2014to keep her intellect clear of her emotions and\r\ninstincts ; it seemed to work alone unhampered. I suspect\r\nagain this trait was Latin rathei than Teuton. It seems\r\nto belong to a very high level of civilisation, and she was\r\nthe most civilised creature I have ever known.\r\nShe was an admirable citizen, punctiliously law-abiding. \" Laws are made to be broken,\" was an English truth that\r\nshe never could grasp. That she with her clear head, Avide\r\nknowledge of facts and strong sense of public duty, should\r\nbe voteless, was in itself a reductio ad absurdum of the antisuffragist position, yet her voteless condition never abated\r\nby one jot her interest in public affairs. As a true democrat\r\nshe desired the vote, and she was a member of the National\r\nUnion, but she was never an ardent or even very active\r\nSuffragist. Once I remember she forbade the subject to be\r\nmentioned at Sunday supper ; not that she wavered for a moment in her convictions, but she was very easily bored\r\nand disliked stale or fruitless controversy. \" We have said\r\nall there is to say. Do let us talk about something else.\"\r\nYet her private views as to the independence of a woman's\r\nlife were at times startling. She was listening once to the\r\naccount of how a brilliant intellectual woman had dropped\r\nall her literary interests after marriage and devoted herself\r\nentirely to domesticity and the furthering of her husband's\r\ncareer. \" She has simply given up her whole life to him,\"\r\nthe speaker ended ; \"it is wonderful ! \" \" Wonderful,\" said\r\nMrs. Verrall ; \" I call it simply squalid ; fancy giving up\r\nyour own life to your husband ! \" and\u2014reflectively\u2014\" how it would bore Arthur if I did ! \"\r\nShe was a keen politician ; she and Dr. VerralJ maintained\r\ntheir steady Liberalism at a time when Liberalism, in Cambridge\r\nat least, was not very easy, and when many of their old\r\nLiberal set dropped away on the Irish question. Of a lapsed\r\nLiberal friend she said to me, \" We can't discuss politics\r\nwith him any more ; that's useless ; he is rabid, and I suppose we are ; but we are determined it shall not change\r\nour friendship,\" and it never did. One of her closest friends\r\nwas suddenly converted from rank Toryism to ultra-Socialism ; that friend she met always with the same smiling\u2014not sym-\r\nlxxiv.] In Memoriayn Mrs. A. W.

In theory, though\r\nby no means in practice, she was the perfect democrat. We\r\nwere once discussing the question of whether an Associate\r\non becoming Principal should cease to be an Associate. 1 A\r\ntimid Associate urged that some might feel a difficulty in\r\nspeaking freely when the Principal was present. \" She will\r\nnot be present,\" said Mrs. Verrall, firmly ; \" she will have\r\nbecome an Associate.\"\r\nThough so good a citizen, she was no philanthropist. When\r\na national need arose she could and did work gallantly against\r\nfast declining health, as Secretary of the University Belgian\r\nCommittee in Cambridge. But she said to me once, \" I\r\nsuppose there is something wrong in me, for I'm no good\r\nat ' good works ' \u2014they bore me.\" In like manner, she was\r\nno initiator of reforms. This last characteristic she perhaps\r\ntook on from Dr. Verrall, who drove his own revolutionary\r\ntrain of thought quite cheerfully along the most antiquated\r\nUniversity rails. It was not, I think, \" something wrong\r\n\"\r\nin her, but something rather profoundly right. She seemed\r\nto feel, with Ivan Karamazov, \" One can't live in rebellion,\r\nand I want to live.\" In her character there were plenty\r\n\u2022of \u2014not faults, but little obvious, loveable and intensely logical\r\nabsurdities, which allowed her friends to laugh at her, and\r\nso made her doubly dear. But in one important direction\r\nshe unconsciously led the way morally, and somehow anticipated the new religion that seems dawning among the\r\nyoung. She showed us\u2014but here I am putting into words\r\nwhat she never formulated\u2014that the whole, or at least the\r\nchief, Duty of Man is not to do good, or even to be good,\r\nbut rather, in obedience to healthy impulse, to work, to\r\ncreate, to \" energise,\" and thereby enrich the commonwealth.\r\nHerein lay her sanity and her success. This instinctive advanced outlook was the more marked, as she was never very\r\nkeen about, or closely in touch with young movements, and\r\nshe was impatient of discussion societies. At the founding\r\nof the Cambridge Heretics Society I tried to get her sympathy\r\n1 The Associates of Newnhani College are an elected group of old\r\nstudents, having a certain share in the government of the college.\r\n\r\nEd.\r\n384 Jane Harrison.

She had not the born linguist's\r\npassion for words. What she really cared for was that\r\nmysterious thing, style. She owned somewhat reluctantly\r\nthat Ibsen was great as a dramatist, but he gave her, she\r\nsaid, little pleasure. She promised to read Dostoievsky, and\r\neven after her last illness had set in began to learn\r\nRussian, for she had the true stylist's dislike to translations,\r\nbut she prophesied that she would never \"enjoy\" him.\r\nIt was characteristic of her rather belles-lettres attitude that\r\nshe always expected to \" enjoy \" great literature. Markedly\r\nun-modern she was in her literary tastes, yet to her as well\r\nas to Dr. Verrall was dedicated the book of verse by young\r\nCambridge poets. The fact speaks volumes.\r\nHer output of original work in classics was small. Constant teaching work, wide human and political interests, a household most competently managed (her servants stayed\r\nwith her for years), and incessant social duties all made\r\nheavy inroads on her time. Sunday, which brings breathing\r\nspace to some of us, was devoted to entertaining London\r\nfriends and old pupils. During Dr. Verrall 's tutorship generations of undergraduates were welcomed at Sunday luncheon,\r\nand, in fact, it was open house all day. Moreover, the\r\nlater years of her life were given to intricate Psychical work.\r\nHow delicate and exact her classical work was is shown\r\nby her last contribution, on Tivo Instances of Symbolism\r\nin the Sixth Mneid {C.R., 1910, p. 43). It is specially\r\ncharacteristic as marking the blend of Classical and Psychical\r\nResearch.\r\nIt is easy to catalogue qualities. Personality, the thing\r\nwe love, escapes us. There are so many young, splendid,\r\nvigorous, noble people whom yet one does not love. Our\r\nfriendship, her's and mine, was one long, affectionate, dispassionate animosity.

For it extends over three fat,\r\nelaborately-indexed 1 volumes (only ninety pages in the third\r\nbeing devoted to the ' Patison ' case), and approximates to 2500\r\npages of reading matter and nine pounds in weight, while its published price is $20. Nevertheless, it really is a great case, and no one who has read it will belittle it. Rather will he\r\nadmonish others to follow his example if they would be considered up to date in the literature of psychology and psychical\r\nresearch, and express an earnest hope that some of the professional psychologists and psychiatrists will be open-minded\r\nenough to study it. For not only will it give them a very\r\nfine study of what appears to be a very typical and instructive case of the multiple personality which even the most conservatively ' orthodox ' psychologists have by now come to accept\r\nas a fact, and a case moreover which was carried to a remarkably successful conclusion by the manipulative skill, persever- ance and devotion of Dr. Prince ; but it will have also a\r\npleasing element of surprise. For just when they think they\r\nhave come to an end of it, it starts off again in a new direction,\r\nand challenges them to think furiously, by developing vistas of a very startling and unorthodox kind. Yet when they think it over as a whole they will find it very difficult to say where in\r\n1 The index, however, is not very good.\r\nLXXIV.] Revieiv. 387\r\nthe course of its perfectly smooth and objective record they can draw the line between science and pseudo-science, between what\r\nthey are willing to accept as normal fact and what they are determined to reject (with far too little investigation) as supernormal and superstitious. A condensed narrative of the plot\r\nwill illustrate this curious difficulty.\r\nI.\r\nThe heroine of the case, Miss ' Doris Fischer,' was born in\r\n1889, of German-American parents, as the youngest of thirteen\r\nchildren. The father contracted the drink habit while serving\r\nas a soldier during the Civil War, and this proved to be the\r\ncause, not only of all the family troubles, but also of the\r\ntragedy of ' Doris's ' dissociations. For, in 1892, when she was\r\nthree years old, the intoxicated father in the course of a quarrel\r\nwith her mother, took her and dashed her on to the floor. This shock ' dissociated ' her into the ' Real Doris,' ' Margaret\r\n\r\nand ' Sleeping Margaret '\r\n; but no one suspected the dissociation\r\nuntil Dr. Prince took charge of her nineteen years later, discovering 'Margaret' on Jan. 20, 1911, and 'Sleeping Margaret'\r\ntwo days later. All that the mother had noticed was that her\r\nyoungest child was queer, subject to moods and apparent lapses\r\nof memory, in which she would ' forget ' what she had just\r\ndone or said. No wonder, seeing that ' Margaret ' used to\r\nalternate with ' Real Doris,' and the latter knew nothing of\r\n' Margaret's ' doings, unless ' Margaret ' chose to tell her. Fortunately ' Margaret,' unlike ' Sally ' in the ' Beauchamp ' case, was well-disposed towards 1 Real Doris,' and from the first used to amuse her and keep her quiet, by ' making her play\r\nwith her fingers and see things that were not there ' (p. 108),\r\nand though she sometimes got her into trouble by her childish\r\nfreaks (for she never grew mentally older than ten), the pair\r\nlived happily enough with each other and their mother, to whom\r\nboth were devoted, until ' Doris ' was seventeen. Then, on May 6, 1906, the mother died after a short illness, aggravated\r\nby a painful scene with the father ; the result of this agony was\r\na further ' dissociation.'\r\nThe new personality, ' Sick Doris,' started life with no\r\nknowledge whatever of the past, unable to speak or to under-\r\n388 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART\r\nstand language, to eat. swallow, dress, etc., and in fact not\r\nfar short of the helplessness of that perfect example of the\r\n'psychological baby,' the Rev. Mr. ' Hanna ' after his fall, in\r\nDr. Sidis's famous case. Like Mr. Hanna she had an adult\r\nmind to learn withal, but unlike him she had also a ' subliminal\r\nteacher ' in ' Margaret,' prompting her from within and able\r\nand willing to take a hand in averting disaster from the common\r\nbody. This shows that when one suffers 'dissociation' it may\r\nbe an advantage to have been dissociated before. ' Margaret ' was able to talk to ' Sick Doris ' through her lips, but soon found\r\nthat the only way \" to get her to understand was by doing\r\nthings,\" an observation which should be taken to heart by intellectualists who will not admit that acting has anything to do\r\nwith understanding. ' Sick Doris ' did not attribute to herself\r\nthe movements of her body initiated by ' Margaret ' (a fact\r\nwhich has a bearing on Hume's theory of causation), but\r\nimitated them and other things ; the first thing she understood\r\nwas the language of gesture. As a teacher ' Margaret ' had, of\r\ncourse, peculiar advantages, having an inside view of ' Sick\r\nDoris's ' mind and a power, in emergencies, of driving her ' in,'\r\ncoming ' out,' and assuming control of the body herself. On\r\nthe other hand, she had the limitations of a little girl of ten,\r\nwith a quick temper, and easily grew tired or impatient. It\r\nis not astonishing that in the end she came to despise and\r\nloathe her pupil, who never got over the disadvantages of her\r\nbirth, being \"lacking on the side of the affections, though\r\nmorbidly the slave of duty, and lacking in humour, in conceptions of the abstract, and in other respects \"\r\n(p. 171). So\r\nshe often annoyed ' Margaret ' excessively, who retaliated by\r\nscratching and otherwise tormenting her, much as ' Sally ' did\r\n' B I.' Still her self-sacrificing labours at first are beyond all\r\npraise, and the account of the education of ' Sick Doris ' as told by ' Real Doris,' when she had inherited her memories\r\n(p. 221 f.), is excellent reading. ' Margaret's ' lessons were\r\nmostly given at night, and at first she kept ' Sick Doris ' awake\r\nall night in order to teach her. In this way the defects of\r\nthe new personality were concealed from human eyes, though\r\nnot from the keener discernment of dogs and parrots, who\r\nobserved the difference between ' Sick Doris ' and ' Margaret,'\r\nand much preferred the latter (p. 233). What, however,\r\nLXXIV.] Review. 389\r\nparticularly irritated ' Margaret ' was not her congenital stupidity,\r\nbut her morbid appetite for work. She speedily developed a\r\nhabit of going into a sort of trance in which she embroidered\r\nwith extraordinary skill and speed, without intermission or\r\nrepose. ' Margaret ' had to participate in these bouts,, and\r\ngreatly resented being * worked.' In about two weeks from\r\n' Sick Doris's ' first appearance they were on scratching terms.\r\nThis, as Dr. Prince observes, p. 235, was \" a rather futile\r\nperformance, as S.D. was partially anaesthetic ... so that M.\r\nwas the one chiefly to suffer \" from the injuries inflicted on\r\nthe common body. She also pulled out her hair in long\r\nstrands with much violence, and set her night-gown on fire. Fortunately both were well-disposed towards the primary\r\npersonality, ' Real Doris,' and willing\u2014as it will be remembered\r\n' Sally ' Beauchamp was in the end\u2014to be sacrificed in order\r\nthat she might be restored. At this time the relations of\r\nmutual comprehension between the three personalities, all of\r\nwhich were recognisable by distinctive expression, intonation\r\nand manners, as may be seen from the illustrations, were these\r\n(p. 47 f.). (1) \"Real Doris had no direct knowledge of the\r\nthoughts or acts of any of the secondary personalities.\" She had,\r\nhowever, been from the first in communication with 1 Margaret,'\r\nwho could ' use the same mouth without her volition.' and also\r\nused to write notes to her. Besides, thoughts of ' Margaret's '\r\nmight ' bubble up ' into her mind, and colour her dreams.\r\n(2) \" Sick Doris knew, or was capable of knowing, all that\r\nR.D. did, said, experienced and thought,\" and was (probably)\r\nsubliminally co-conscious with her, as ' Margaret ' certainly was. But she had no access to the mind of ' Margaret,' and when\r\nthe latter was ' out,' i.e. in control of the body, she was \" as\r\nif annihilated for the time being.\" As was the case with\r\n' Real Doris,' ' Sick Doris ' and ' Margaret ' also \" wrote notes to\r\neach other, and held frequent oral conversations \"\r\n(p. 49), and\r\n' Sick Doris ' received other intimations of ' Margaret's ' feelings\r\nand wishes. (3) 'Margaret' \"had, or was capable of having,\r\nknowledge of the experiences of every sort and the thoughts\r\nof both R.D. and S.D.,\" though it was alleged that her knowledge of S.D. only was immediate, while her knowledge of\r\nR.D. was reflected from S.D.'s mind as from a mirror. Further, when the other two were ' out,' she was subliminally\r\n2b\r\n390 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\r\nco-conscious and could ' watch ' them, but (unlike ' Sally ') she\r\ndid not claim to have uninterrupted consciousness. For though\r\nshe never ' dreamt ' 1 she slept, and was sometimes ' away and\r\nsleeping,' perhaps because there was a deeper personality still.\r\n(4) This was (rather inconveniently) denominated ' Sleeping\r\nMargaret,' because first discovered (p. 463) on April 5, 1911\r\nwhile ' Margaret ' was asleep, and in several respects was the\r\nmost remarkable feature in the case. She never manifested\r\nexcept when ' Margaret ' was asleep, and subsequently, when\r\n' Margaret ' had gone, in the sleep of ' Real Doris,' and had\r\npower only over the vocal organs, and in rare emergencies over\r\nthe limbs. But then she was not allowed to develop, and to\r\n' get her eyes open ' like Sally Beauchamp (p. 814). But for\r\nthis she would, as she said, \" probably have become the hardest one to deal with.\" For mentally she was the most impressive\r\nand inclusive ; she knew all that the others did and thought,\r\nseeing M.'s thoughts directly, those of S.D. reflected from the\r\nconsciousness of M. and those of R.D. reflected from S.D. via\r\nM. Her mind was that of a mature, sensible woman, and\r\nafter Dr. Prince had won her confidence, she was always willing\r\nto give (excellent) advice in the treatment of the case. She\r\nclaimed to date back to ' Doris's ' infancy, and to have ' come\r\n'\r\nat the same time as ' Margaret '\r\n; but none of the others were aware of her existence, which ' Margaret ' only discovered in\r\nNov., 1911, by telepathically reading Dr. Prince's mind (p. 799),\r\nand she preserved to the end the attitude of a benevolent but\r\ndetached and independent spectator. When she had had her\r\nlittle evening chat with Dr. Prince she would relapse into\r\nsilence, and in the daytime would usually ' go away ' on busi- ness of her own, about which she was very reticent, and she\r\ncould glean what had happened in her ' absence ' only from the\r\nminds of the others. (5) ' Sleeping Real Doris ' was little more than a disturbance in the sleep of ' Real Doris,' due, as\r\n' Margaret ' said (p. 247), to \"a little crack in the R.D.\" She was started by a fall down the stairs on Oct. 2, 1907, but never\r\ndeveloped very far. Dr. Prince doubts whether she had self- consciousness, and she had no knowledge of any of the others,\r\n1 Pp. 414, 787. As against these positive statements in the 'record' the\r\nremark in the summary on p. 50 that M. was subject to ' simple dreaming v must be a slip.\r\nLXXIV.] Review. 391\r\nnor had they access to her mind. All she ever did was to\r\nrehearse with mechanical accuracy, like a phonograph, conversations and soliloquies in which R.D. or S.D. had participated.\r\nSuch was the ' Doris ' Family when the case came under Dr.\r\nPrince's notice in Nov., 1909, and such it had been (with the\r\naddition of ' Sleeping Real Doris ' in 1907) since the mother's\r\ndeath in 1906. Ever since that catastrophe the ' Real Doris '\r\nhad been practically suppressed. She ' came out ' only for a few minutes at a time, and the least disturbance sent her ' in,'\r\ni.e. away, again. Dr. Prince estimates that during the five\r\nyears 1906-11, her conscious existence can hardly have amounted\r\nto three days, and tells us that when he talked to what happened to be ' Real Doris ' in November, 1909, she had not\r\nspoken to anyone since her mother's death four and a half\r\nyears before ! (p. 257).\r\nIt was, therefore, a singular piece of good fortune that S.D.\r\nshould have wandered one day in Jan., 1909, into the Episcopal\r\nChurch in Pittsburgh of which Dr. Prince was then rector, and\r\nthat just as he began to preach R.D. should have emerged and\r\nlistened to the whole of the sermon. Still it was S.D. who,\r\nin October, 1909, joined the Sunday school of his church,\r\nand attracted the attention of Mrs. Prince. S.D. at this time was her father's household drudge, terribly overworked, and\r\ntormented by ' Margaret,' who resented the ' sewing fits ' in\r\nwhich she was made to participate, underfed, and in a very\r\nbad state of health. Mrs. Prince made her come to the rectory,\r\ngave her food and allowed her to rest and to sleep, soon\r\nnoticing that in her sleep her hands used to scratch and otherwise torment her body. This was ' Margaret ' avenging herself\r\nupon ' Sick Doris '\r\n; but it was not until Jan., 1911, by which\r\ntime Dr. Prince had interested himself in the case, that its significance was understood. Dr. Prince had read his namesake's book on the ' Beauchamp ' case, suspected 'dissociation,'\r\nand soon unravelled the major complications. He at once\r\nrecognized that in order to effect a cure, and indeed to save\r\nthe girl's life, it was necessary to take her away from her\r\nfather, and despite some opposition from the father, who was\r\nto go to a Veterans' Home, carried through his scheme. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Prince adopted Doris, and on Mar. 2, 1911, she\r\nentered their household, and her cure commenced.\r\n392 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\r\nThe conduct of this cure reflects the greatest possible credit\r\non Dr. Prince, both as a man and as a layman (medically).\r\nFor even though he had the advice of the professor of\r\npsychiatry of the local University, not many professional\r\nphysicians or psychologists would have managed the affair so smoothly and with so few mistakes. Dr. Prince proceeded on\r\nthe very sound principle that all the conditions should be\r\nrendered favourable to the return of the primary personality,\r\n' Real Doris,' and that she should be encouraged to occupy as much of the total life as she was able to endure, while the\r\nsecondary personalities should be allowed to manifest as little as possible, and should have their opportunities of activity\r\nand self-expression curtailed as much as possible. Hence, even when it was found necessary to let them come, in order to\r\nrest ' Real Doris ' and to relieve her from the strain of con- tinuous living, they were kept asleep as much as possible. As\r\nregards method, Dr. Prince did not employ hypnotism, but\r\nfound personal influence and persuasion more effective, having\r\nspeedily discovered that all the personalities were very suggestible, especially when asleep. The application of these therapeutic methods demanded, however, great tact as well as patience ; for the secondary personalities had to be kept in\r\ngood Immour and tolerant of their treatment, lest their\r\nopposition should jeopardize its success. ' Margaret ' especially\r\ncould clearly have done as much mischief as ' Sally ' in the\r\n4 Beauchamp ' case. Both for this reason, and because she was the latest comer,\r\n1 Sick Doris ' was the first to be attacked, with the enthusiastic concurrence of 'Margaret.' She yielded ground rapidly, and in a very curious way. Within a week her memories began to go,\r\nbut most of them (though not their accompanying emotions)\r\nturned up again in the mind of ' Real Doris,' and afforded her\r\nsome ex post facto compensation for the experience she had\r\nmissed. It was now S.D.'s turn to be absent for days at a\r\ntime, to become anaesthetic, and generally to dwindle and to\r\ndiminish in vitality. But her retrogressive development took\r\nthe curious form of growing younger. She who had been born\r\nadult, now experienced her first childhood. Jn two months'\r\ntime she was reduced to helpless infancy, and on June 28th,\r\n1911, her last brief appearance was recorded. Similarly, the\r\nlxxiv.] Review. 393\r\nrecitals of ' Sleeping Real Doris ' grew rarer and shorter, until\r\nshe too petered out, in April, 1912.\r\nThe evanescence of ' Margaret ' was a slower process. Her\r\ndecline, as measured by loss of power over ' Real Doris ' and\r\nof the ability to know her mind and to ' watch ' when ' in ' {i.e. subliminal), set in at once, and continued as the ' Real Doris '\r\ngrew stronger and occupied more and more of the day. Like\r\nS.D. she too grew progressively younger, though receding only\r\nfrom the mentality of a girl of ten to that of one of five. She\r\nalso grew more and more anaesthetic, and her sight shortened,\r\nuntil she became totally blind, though she retained to the end\r\nher remarkable auditory hyperaesthesia. Her last appearance\r\noccurred in April, 1914.\r\nSo there was no one left of the family besides ' Real Doris '\r\nand ' Sleeping Margaret.' And as the latter only manifested\r\nin R.D.'s sleep, without encroaching upon her waking hours, the\r\ncure was for practical purposes complete. Theoretically, however, ' Sleeping Margaret ' remained a great puzzle, and part of\r\nthe anomalies (yet to be mentioned) which differentiated the case from ordinary dissociations of personality. With her mature\r\nintelligence, detached attitude and curiously restricted control\r\nof the body, she was obviously unlike the alternating personalities. Finding that she alone was not amenable to suggestion,\r\nand singularly reticent about herself, Dr. Prince (perhaps\r\nunwisely) suggested to her that she was a spirit (p. 767). She\r\nrepudiated the idea repeatedly\u2014in Nov., 1911, Oct., 1912 (p.\r\n1307), Feb., 1913 (p. 1101). But always in a way suggestive\r\nof a desire to baffle an impertinent inquirer. Thus the second\r\nof these denials was provoked by an allegation made through\r\n' Margaret's ' automatic planchette-writing, purporting to come\r\nfrom Doris's mother, that she was ' the guard ' (or spirit\r\n' guide ') but would deny this. She admitted that she was \" the\r\none that guards \" and that her own coming was in response\r\nto the praj^ers of Doris's mother, denied both that ' Margaret *\r\ncould have written the messages (\" You know very well that\r\nshe does not understand what is written \") and that she herself\r\nhad, and replied to the question ' then it is a spirit ?\r\n' \" No,\r\nI think that is nonsense.\" Her subsequent denial was still more enigmatic. To an inquiry as to what she was, she\r\nreplied, \" Well, I am not a spirit . . . Don't you know that a.\r\n394 F. C. 8. Schiller. [part\r\npersonality can go from one person to another ? \" (No.) \" Well, it can. I don't mean such a one as S.D. But M.,\r\nfor example, if she had become more fully developed\u2014a personality gets to be more like the real person when fully\r\ndeveloped\u2014if she had gone on and developed, until she was\r\nout most of the time, and then had been suddenly forced out \u2014and you could have done it, though it would probably have\r\nruined R.D.\u2014she could have gone to some other person.\" (To\r\nwhat sort of a person ?) \"To some nervously weak person\r\n\" (You reason this out ?) \" No, I know it.\" (From your own\r\nexperience ?) \" I didn't say that.\" Surely Dr. Prince was\r\njustified in regarding this curious theory of possession as detracting seriously from the denial that ' Sleeping Margaret ' was a spirit. Finally, in August, 1914, when ' Margaret ' had\r\nbeen gone four months and it had been arranged that ' Doris ' was to have some sittings with Prof. Hyslop's medium, Mrs.\r\nChenoweth, ' Sleeping Margaret ' was prevailed upon to make\r\nan extraordinary statement (p. 1264). She wrote \" I am a\r\nspirit, so called by people who live on the earth. I do not\r\nknow whether I have a name or not. I only know that I\r\nwas sent by some one higher to guard Doris when she was\r\nthree years old. There are lots of guards like me but they\r\ndo not stay with the people they guard.

What could be more fantastic, and also more instructive, than\r\nthe coming into being, and the passing out of it, of her various\r\nLXXIV.] Review. 395\r\npersonalities ? What could more vividly reveal the utter\r\ninadequacj7 to the facts of the old metaphysical dogma that a\r\nsoul is a simple and indivisible spiritual substance ? Souls seem to be composed of strata that extend down into the\r\nsubliminal with no perceptible limits, and capable under\r\npressure of developing new stratifications or obliterating old\r\nones. It is, of course, tempting\u2014and medical minds usually\r\nfind the temptation irresistible\u2014to connect these stratifications\r\nwith the structure of the brain, and this theory is in our case supported by the very definite local habitations in the head\r\nwhich M. and S.M. assigned to themselves and their colleagues.\r\nBut such attempts are usually found to turn metaphors into\r\narguments, and invariably involve themselves in far-reaching\r\nconfusions of the physical and the psychical. 1\r\n(2) Moreover these astounding facts are as damaging to\r\nmaterialistic dogma as to the old-fashioned spiritualism. A\r\nsoul's organization is not adequately expressed by physical\r\nanalogies. Its so-called ' dissociations ' are not mechanical\r\nprocesses, even when they are excited by bodily injuries. Nor\r\nare they wholty morbid. What stands out very clearly in\r\nDoris Fischer's case is that they are really teleological\u2014protective reactions to alleviate the burden of living. But the\r\nsame lesson was really implicit also in the earlier cases, though\r\nthe bias of the doctors who recorded them has not infrequently\r\nobscured it. Thus even in the very earliest case of all, that\r\nof ' Felida X.,' it is recorded that the secondary personality was a great improvement on the condition of the primary ; while Dr. R. O. Mason's case of\r\n1 Alma Z.' presents very\r\nclose analogies to ' Doris Fischer's,' in that it too had a childlike secondary personality -very like ' Margaret,' and ' Twoey '\r\ndeclared that she had come to help ' Number One.' It is quite probable that if ' Sally ' in the Beauchamp case had\r\nbeen handled by Dr. Morton Prince as sympathetically as\r\n' Margaret ' was by Dr. Walter Prince, she too would have\r\nconsented to be a curative influence, 2 and it should be remembered that in the end it was she who gave away the secret\r\n1 Cf. e.g. Dr. Morton Prince's notion of ' neurograms ' and my criticism\r\nof it in Proc. S.P.fi. Pt. LXX., pp. 495, 490-501.\r\n2 Cf. ' Sleeping Margaret's ' testimonial to Dr. Prince on p. 750, which\r\nindicates that a different policy might have led to disaster.\r\n396 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\r\nof the Beauchamp family, and that she consented to her own\r\nsuppression. 1 Also, it is only fair to say that Dr. Morton\r\nPrince was a pioneer in the therapeutic handling of secondary\r\npersonalities, and that his successor profited by his experiments. 2\r\nLastly, it should be realized that the form of alternating personality which we all normally experience, viz. ordinary sleep,,\r\nis definitely therapeutic in its function ; and that if we were\r\nnot capable of it we could not live.\r\n(3) It is clear that every case of ' dissociation ' has individual\r\nfeatures of its own, and differs from every other. 3 There is a\r\ngeneral family resemblance, but we must be chary of too hastily\r\narguing from one case to another. Thus if we compare ' Doris\r\nFischer ' with ' Miss Beauchamp,' we can note the following\r\ndifferences in the ' dissociations.' (a) The Real Miss Beauchamp\r\nwas wholly dissolved into her 'dissociations,' 'BI' and ' B IV '\r\n(the latter remaining latent for six years after splitting off),\r\nwhereas the Real Doris was not dissolved or extinguished, but\r\nbecame an alternating personality, who was driven off the\r\nscene for a time but gradually recovered the power to maintain\r\nherself, (b) She recovered the memories of ' Sick Doris,' as\r\nMiss Beauchamp did those of B I and B IV ; but the character\r\nof S.D. did not enter into the composition of her own, whereas\r\nthe real Miss Beauchamp was a synthesis of B I and B IV.\r\n(c) In the Beauchamp case there was nothing analogous to\r\nthe way in which S.D. and M. evanesced, by reduction to infancy and weakness, nor did Real Doris ever inherit the mental\r\ncontents of ' Margaret ' as well as those of S.D. (d) Though\r\n' Margaret ' corresponded in a general way to ' Sally,' there are well-marked differences. She was much less potent, even at\r\nher strongest, and was finally extinguished, and not merely\r\n' squeezed ' back into the subliminal. It would perhaps be\r\ntrue to say that ' Sally ' combined the parts played in the\r\nFischer case by ' Margaret ' and ' Sleeping Margaret.' But\r\n1 The Dissociation of a Personality, p. 519 ; cf. p. 521.\r\n2 In Sidis and Goodhart's case of the Rev. T. C. Hanna the dissociating\r\nshock was apparently entirely physical. But could we have known what\r\ndamage precisely it had done to the brain, we might hope to understand\r\nwhy, to repair it, it was expedient to start the new ' Mr. Hanna ' afresh\r\npsychically, and to dissociate him from his whole past.\r\ns This was ' Sleeping Margaret's ' view too, cf. p. 750.\r\nLXXIV.] Review. 397\r\n(e) there is no real analogue in the Beauchamp case to ' Sleeping Margaret.' Or if there was, Dr. Morton Prince failed to\r\ndiscover it.\r\n(4) This possibility must be seriously reckoned with. We\r\nare far too ready to ascribe finality to the knowledge of the\r\nhour and to assume that what has not been found, or is not\r\nofficially recognized, does not exist. But few facts are so\r\nobtrusive as to force themselves upon us if we will not look\r\nfor them, and still fewer so strong that they can make their\r\nway against hostile prejudice. Now the professional interests\r\nof doctors are such as inevitably to prejudice them in certain\r\ndirections, and it is possible that they may overlook a good\r\ndeal. At any rate the Doris Fischer case suggests that in\r\nall such affairs there may be a good deal more than meets the\r\nordinary doctor's eye. It seems to point to a whole array of\r\nmysteries which are usually not explored because medical prejudice fights shy of them and medical attention is directed\r\nelsewhere. We may take it that medical records are usually\r\nincomplete where they approach the supernormal. Incidents\r\nbordering upon this region are recorded, if at all, only apologetically and under protest. Nevertheless, it is fairly well\r\nrecognized that cases of ' dissociation ' exhibit hyperesthesias\r\nas well as anaesthesias, though rarely in such abundance as\r\nin our case. Supernormal knowledge was observed in other\r\ncases also, e.g. in ' Alma Z.,' ' Lurancy Vennum,' and\r\n' Mr. Hanna.' As for the Beauchamp case, it will be re- membered that ' Sally ' seemed so supernormal to Mr.\r\nM'Dougall as to drive that great authority into an argument\r\nfor sheer spiritism. 1 In the Doris Fischer case the supernormal, though still subordinate to the psychological interest,\r\nbulks large\u2014perhaps only because it was fully and fairly\r\nrecorded. At any rate it is to be accounted a piece of good\r\nluck rather than an anomaly that the case fell into the hands\r\nof investigators who were not afraid to explore its supernormal\r\nside. Nor can it be too strongly impressed on future investigators that scientific completeness and honesty require them\r\nnot to omit what look like supernormal incidents merely\r\nbecause they do not understand them. We know so very little about the intimate ' nature ' and structure of ' souls,' and about\r\nProceedings S.P.H., Vol. XIX., p. 430.\r\n398 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\r\ntheir disorders and potentialities that we should not allow any\r\na priori prejudice to impede the investigation of whatever facts\r\nwe can observe. Nor should we acquiesce too easily in terms\r\nlike ' dissociation ' as the beginning and end of wisdom. They\r\nare little more than descriptive metaphors, and explain neither\r\nwhat originally ' associates ' a soul into the sort of unity it normally has, nor what disrupts this unity, so strangely and\r\ncapriciously, to the varying extent illustrated in these abnormalities. It may then very well be, as Prof. Hyslop contends,\r\nthat supernormal influences usually accompany a\r\n' dissociation.'\r\nand may be detected, if they are looked for. If so, this will\r\nbe an additional reason for cultivating a very open mind, in the hope of unravelling their complexities. These considerations, therefore, lead us on to the supernormal side of the\r\nDoris Fischer case.\r\nIII.\r\nThe supernormal side of the Fischer case is developed at great\r\nlength in Vol. III., which contains Dr. Hyslop's account (with\r\nsome annotations by Dr. Prince) of twenty-three sittings Doris\r\nhad in Nov. and Dec, 1914, with his medium ' Mrs. Chenoweth,'\r\ntogether with more or less relevant references to Doris in over a hundred subsequent sittings, down to Dec. 22nd, 1915. In\r\nthis part of the narrative the atmosphere is frankly spiritistic,\r\nin accordance with Dr. Hyslop's well-known convictions. But\r\nin a more moderate way the supernormal element had figured\r\nalso in the first two volumes. For Dr. Prince had from the\r\nfirst conscientiously recorded all the apparently supernormal\r\nincidents that occurred spontaneously. These may be classified\r\nunder the heads of (a) telepathy and clairvoyance, (b) hallucinations, and (c) automatic writing, and are deserving of consideration whatever may be thought of Volume III.\r\n(a) On a number of occasions 1 ' Margaret ' evinced a power\r\nof knowing Dr. Prince's past thoughts, discovering, e.g. in this\r\n1 I have not been able to count those recorded, and unfortunately the\r\nindex happens to be almost worthless on this important point. It omits,\r\nunder ' Margaret, telepathy,' the cases on pp. 508-10, 739, 799 and 804, and\r\nunder ' Margaret, clairvoyance ' those on pp. 335-346, 376-8, 661, is nugatory\r\nunder ' telepathy,' and quite incomplete under ' clairvoyance ' and 1 tele- voyance.'\r\nlxxiv.] Review. 399\r\nway that he had written to Dr. Morton Prince about the case\r\n(p. 804), and that ' Sleeping Margaret ' existed (p. 799). She\r\nexplained these feats variously, by saying that she saw it in\r\nhis eyes, at which she used to gaze fixedly on such occasions, or that he had ' formed words with his lips,' although he had\r\nnot moved them (pp. 509-10). She also explained that she saw,\r\nnot his actual thoughts, but what was \"passing like a parade\r\ndown underneath.\" Dr. Prince was convinced that this power\r\nwas genuine, and it is difficult to deny that it was ' telepathic'\r\nIn addition there are reports of clairvoyance due to her (pp. 301,\r\n661), and she was once sent on a clairvoyant expedition with\r\nconsiderable success (pp. 376-8). The curious case on pp. 508-10,\r\nin which she knew what Dr. Prince had been reading hi a book, seems to attest both telepathy and clairvoyance. On one\r\noccasion (pp. 335-46), ' Sick Doris ' appears to have had a\r\nclairvoyant vision, in which ' Margaret ' may have been implicated.\r\n(b) Hallucinations of a possibly veridical sort occurred to\r\n' Sick Doris ' and ; Real Doris,' and also ; in connexion with a\r\nproof ' Sleeping Margaret ' had promised him, to Dr. Prince.\r\n' Sick Doris,' when she first came, was frequently comforted in her\r\ntroubles by visions of the mother she had never seen, who spoke\r\nkindly to her, teste ' Margaret ' (pp. 244, 442). In November,\r\n1912, ' Margaret ' reported that ' Real Doris ' had several times seen their mother, and this was confirmed by S.M. and R.D.\r\nwho said\u2014\" I Avas sitting in the henyard day before yesterday\r\nat half past four, feeling sad, and holding a chicken, looking\r\ndown at it when I saw a shadow. That made me look up\r\n\r\nI thought it must be you ; and I saw my mother, just as\r\nplainly as I ever saw her, dressed in a calico dress which she wore when I was a child about eight years old. She looked\r\ndown on me and smiled and her face shone\u2014it seemed to\r\nreflect light. I saw her only a second, and then she suddenly\r\ndisappeared. I saw the same thing yesterday afternoon\r\n\r\n(pp. 1042-4). As for Dr. Prince he was awakened from a dream by hearing himself called ' Walter '\r\n:\r\n' Sleeping Margaret '\r\nspontaneously claimed to have made this experiment (pp. 1214-5).\r\nSubsequently the same thing happened again, and could not be\r\nexplained (p. 1258 f.).\r\n(c) Automatic writing first occurred in July, 1911, when a\r\npencil was put into ' Margaret's ' hand while she was asleep.\r\n400 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\r\nIt took the form of a message from her mother, Emma Fischer.\r\nOn Sept. 30, 1912, ' Margaret ' was induced to experiment with\r\na planchette, and she continued to do so at intervals until\r\nMarch, 1913. These experiments did not yield anything that was properly evidential, but it was curious, especially in view\r\nof the infantile character of the automatist, that the names of\r\n' Emma Fischer ' and ' Walter M ' (Dr. Prince's father) should\r\nbe given, and that ' Sleeping Margaret ' should be referred to\r\nas ' the guard ' and ' the one who guards the sleep of Doris\/\r\nIn 1914 Doris did some automatic writing, which claimed to\r\ncome from her ' guards,' other than ' S.M.,' but was not\r\nevidential.\r\nSuch was the situation when Doris came east from San\r\nBernardino, Cal. (whither the Princes had moved in June, 1912)\r\nto sit with Mrs. ' Chenoweth ' under the superintendence of\r\nDr. Hyslop. The main points to be tested were, of course,\r\n(1) whether Mrs. 'Chenoweth' would give facts about her\r\nsitter that she could not have known by normal means, and\r\nmore particularly would refer to Doris's curious history ;\r\n(2) whether knowledge could be produced which was not known\r\nto Dr. Hyslop and yet was verifiable by Dr. Prince ; (3)\r\nwhether evidential communications could be obtained from\r\n' spirits,' and more particularly from ' Emma Fischer.'\r\nNow if, as Dr. Hyslop assures us, any normal knowledge of\r\nDoris Fischer by Mrs. ' Chenoweth ' was out of the question,\r\nit is clear that considerable success was obtained under all three heads. And certainly very elaborate precautions were\r\ntaken. Mrs. ' Chenoweth ' was, of course, told nothing about\r\nher sitter, who was introduced into the room after she went\r\ninto trance, and left it before she came out.\r\nUnder these conditions ' Doris's ' ' dissociation ' was diagnosed,\r\nin general terms but unmistakably, in the third sitting, and\r\nascribed to obsession by evil spirits. Her condition was (with\r\nsome ' fishing ') attributed to a fall and connected with her\r\nfather (p. 373 f .), whose failings were plainly indicated (pp.\r\n471-3). Her mother communicated copiously, gave her name,\r\nand claimed to have appeared to her on ' two or three' occasions\r\n(cf. the story of the henhouse above). She remembered the flowers\r\nat her funeral as violets and white roses, which was contrary\r\nto Doris's (very imperfect) recollection, but could be verified\r\nXXXIV.] Review. 401\r\nby Dr. Prince from his knowledge of ' Margaret's ' treasures\r\n(p. 303). She told inter alia a highly evidential anecdote\r\nabout a lame pet ' Skippy ' of Doris's youth, who, however, was said to be a dog and not a cat 1 (pp. 424-5). But she did\r\nnot confirm planchette's story of the blow that had killed her.\r\nAll these statements came in the presence of ' Doris,' and so may be attributed by believers in telepathy to infiltrations from\r\nsome stratum or other of her mind. But some evidential\r\nmatter was given subsequently, when Dr. Hyslop sat alone\r\nwith the medium. The names 'Walter F. Prince,' 'California,'\r\n' Doris's ' real name ' Brittia ' (pp. 842, 850, 851) are examples.\r\nBut these may all have come from Dr. Hyslop's mind. 2 About ' Sleeping Margaret ' there arose a sharp conflict with\r\nDr. Prince's interpretation. For though Mrs. ' Chenoweth's\r\n\r\n' controls ' accepted her term ' guards ' instead of ' guides '\r\n(p. 438), they declined to recognize her as a ' spirit ' at all, and declared her to be merely Doris's ' subconscious.' This\r\nview was accepted by Dr. Hyslop, but not by Dr. Prince.\r\nS.M. did not in fact manage to keep her promise to authenticate herself through Mrs. ' Chenoweth,' but neither did the\r\nlatter 's ' controls ' find any support in Dr. Prince's records.\r\nAnd ' Sleeping Margaret ' stuck to her guns manfully, and the\r\ndescription of the sitting at which Mrs. ' Chenoweth ' was taken\r\nto the house where Doris was sleeping, identified her (without\r\nseeing her) as her sitter, with the cross-examination of ' Sleeping\r\nMargaret ' which ensued, is one of the most striking episodes in\r\nthe whole record. It would appear, therefore, to be necessary\r\nto choose between these two conflicting views, even on a\r\nspiritistic interpretation of the facts : whichever is adopted, the\r\nother has to be declared a subliminal romance, similar to those\r\nof ' Mile. Helene Smith.'\r\nDr. Hyslop not unnaturally prefers to believe in his medium's\r\n' controls,' but he hardly appears to recognize what a monstrous\r\ntale they have induced him to tell. He asks us to believe\r\nthat a titanic struggle between the powers of good and evil\r\n1 Doris remembered only a cat ' Skippy.' But it may have been\r\n' Margaret's ' name for a subsequent dog who also was lame, and if so ' Doris ' would not remember it.\r\n2 Whether he also knew about ' Sick Doris's ' embroidery, which was\r\n\u2022explained (p. 830), is not made clear.\r\n402 F. G. S. Schiller. [PART\r\nwas going on for years over, and in, the soul of ' Doris Fischer.'\r\nOn the one side were a host of obsessing ' earth-bound ' spirits\r\nled by Cagliostro, of whom ' Margaret ' was one ; on the other\r\nthe whole ' Imperator ' band, supported by . all the departed\r\npsychical researchers from Edmund Gurney to William James,\r\nand by ' Minnehaha,' Laughing Water, the good component in\r\nthe obsessing double personality called ' Margaret ' by Dr.\r\nPrince. Moreover, all these distinguished persons seem to be\r\nlabouring under a delusion. They think that the struggle is\r\nstill on, and are unaware that Doris has been cured, and is now as sane and normal as anyone\u2014indeed completely so on\r\ntheir own theory, which makes ' Sleeping Margaret ' into a subsconcious part of ' Doris.' If such are the ignorance and\r\nsense of values that prevail among the good influences on the\r\nspiritual plane, it is no wonder that the devils have things\r\nprettjr much their own way on the earthly. Perhaps by the\r\ntime ' Imperator ' and Co. have realized that they have actually\r\nhelped to save the soul of one little girl, they may discover\r\nthat there has been a war in Europe, which has ruined souls\r\nby the million and dealt a staggering blow to civilization.\r\nThe principle of economy, then, seems decidedly to favour\r\n' Sleeping Margaret's ' conceptions of the function of spirit\r\n' guards ' and of the organization of the world of spirits. It\r\nis much more moderate, and accords well with the evidence,\r\nwhereas the claims of the Chenoweth ' controls ' were wholly nonevidential and unsubstantiated. This is not, however, to endorse\r\nher theory, either. For the possibility of telepathy and\r\nsubliminal intercommunication between individual minds cannot\r\nbe dismissed as lightly as by Dr. Hyslop. I am quite disposed\r\nto admit that ' telepathy ' may be, and has been, overworked\r\nas an explanation, but it does not follow that we should henceforth accept even the most improbable version of the spiritist\r\ninterpretation. I can agree also that ' telepathy ' and ' dissociation ' are both descriptive terms, rather than explanatory\r\n(pp. 8, 150, 170). But it hardly follows that telepathy is \" not\r\nworth serious consideration as a rival of spiritistic theories \"\r\n(p. 20). Before we can say that we shall have to know a\r\ngreat deal more about ' spirit,' incarnate as well as discarnate.\r\nAt present ' spirit ' is best regarded as a descriptive term too,\r\nand indeed the soundest philosophy of science is disposed to\r\nlxxiv.] Review. 403\r\nhold that all terms are descriptive, and that the old notion of\r\n' explanation ' was a prejudice. It seems wiser, therefore, to\r\nsuspend judgment as to the source of the supernormal features\r\nin the case of Doris Fischer : their value in any case is not\r\ndiminished, but increased, by the discrepancies between the\r\nevidence collected by Dr. Prince and Dr. Hyslop. For nothing\r\nis more likely to impede investigation than premature accept- ance of ' explanations.'\r\nIt remains to be noted, from a literary point of view, that\r\nin Mrs. Chenoweth's record the utterances on p. 693 are in verse and should have been printed as such, and (if possible)\r\nidentified. They sound as if they might have come from Myers's\r\nSt. Paul, and so may be evidential. ' Cagliostro's ' argument for\r\nthe reality of hallucinations, even of those of delirium tremens, on p. 532, is very curious, and should appeal to our ' new\r\nrealists,' while he clearly got the better of Dr. Hyslop in the\r\nethical argument on p. 661. Lastly, the spirited account of\r\nthe suicide spirit who wanted to be dead and insisted that he\r\nwas, is worth quoting. He declared (p. 821 f.) \" I am of no\r\nnation and no land ; my hold on life is broken and I beg you\r\nlet me proceed on my journey to silent death land. Man I was, but now a phantom, soon to lose form as memorj? in\r\ncloud and clod. Pray disturb me not . . . My soul is doomed,\r\nmy day is ended. You are walking my way. I hear your\r\nvoice, the echo of my words is borne to my dying brain. Why\r\nthis delay ? (What delay do you mean ?) I would be released\r\nand pass on to death.\" Evidently two views may be taken\r\nof immortality, even after death, and if ' Sleeping Margaret '\r\nwas, as she said, a spirit that had lost her identity, here was\r\none that had tried hard and failed.\r\nF. C. S. Schiller.\r\n404 Eleanor Mildred Sidgivick. [part\r\nREVIEW.\r\nRaymond, or Life and Death, with Examples of the Evidence\r\nfor Survival of Memory and Affection after Death. By\r\nSir Oliver Lodge. (London: Methuen & Co. 1916.) 1\r\ni This book, well described by its title, has had a remarkable\r\nsuccess with the public, and no fewer than seven editions\r\nhave been issued since its first appearance in November, 1916.\r\nThis success is natural, for Sir Oliver Lodge has a gift of\r\nsimple, popular exposition ; and at a time when so many\r\nare mourning near friends and relatives cut off in their prime,\r\nand so many are desiring evidence that the separation is not complete or permanent, a book by him offering such\r\nevidence in the case of his own son is sure to be widely\r\nread. It is indeed the hope of affording comfort and help\r\nto such mourners that has led Sir Oliver to publish the\r\nbook.\r\nThe volume is divided into three parts. The first is a short\r\naccount of his son Raymond, Avho was killed on the Western\r\nfront on September 14, 1915, with extracts from letters from\r\nhim and about him. The second, and longest, part consists\r\nmainly of notes of sittings, with professional mediums, or\r\nin the family circle, held with a view to getting into communication with Raymond after his death. To these are added such comments and information as are required to\r\nenable the reader to estimate the value of any evidence\r\nthat certain verifiable communications exhibit knowledge\r\n1 This review was first published in the Hibbert Journal for April,\r\n1917, and we have to thank the Editor for his permission to reprint\r\nit here. A short review of Raymond has already appeared in the S.P.R.\r\nJournal for January, 1917, but it seemed desirable that this book\r\nshould be discussed in the Proceedings also, and at greater length,\r\nnotwithstanding that so important a part of the evidence it contains\r\nhas appeared in Part LXXII. of the S.P.R. Proceedings.\u2014Ed.\r\nLXXIV.] Review. 405\r\nbeyond that normally possessed by the medium\u2014and especially\r\nevidence that Raymond is the source of this knowledge.\r\nThe reader would do well to begin his study of the book\r\nby reading the introduction to Part II. (p. 83), as this shows\r\nclearly Sir Oliver Lodge's own attitude to the subject, and\r\nthe spirit in which he has written. The third part, called \" Life and Death,\" is of a more theoretical nature. In it Sir Oliver discusses, in a series of short essays, various points\r\nconcerning matter, life, and mind, and some of the theoretical\r\ndifficulties likely to be felt by persons endeavouring to fit the subject of communication with the dead into the scientific\r\nframework they already possess. He also discusses some\r\nmethods used in obtaining communications, and some theories\r\nand hypotheses corcerning the process involved. Part III. concludes with an article reprinted from the Hibbert Journal\r\nof July, 1911, on \"The Christian Idea of God.\"\r\nThere are good evidential points in Part II. such as no\r\nstudent of the subject can afford to overlook ; but too much\r\nshould not be expected. If we had no evidence but what\r\nthis book contains, the cautious student would hesitate to conclude more than that there was a good prima facie case\r\nfor investigation. As Sir Oliver Lodge says (p. 85), \" To\r\nbase so momentous a conclusion as a scientific demonstration\r\nof human survival on any single instance, if it were not\r\nsustained on all sides by a great consensus of similar evidence,\r\nwould doubtless be unwise ; for some other explanation of a merely isolated case would have to be sought.\" He himself, before his son died, had become convinced by other\r\nevidence that survival and communication were verifiable\r\nfacts. \"Speaking for myself,\" he wrote in 1911, \"and with\r\nfull and cautious responsibility, I have to state that as an outcome of my investigation into psychical matters I have\r\nat length and quite gradually become convinced, after more\r\nthan thirty years of study, not only that persistent individual\r\nexistence is a fact, but that occasional communication across the chasm\u2014with difficulty and under definite conditions\r\n\r\nis possible.\" 1 In 1909, in his book, The Survival of Man,\r\nwhich gives an account of the evidence then before him,\r\nhe says rather more tentatively (p. 321), \"The hypothesis\r\n1 Raymond, p. 389, reprinted from Hibbert Journal of July, 1911. 2c\r\n406 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick. [part\r\nof surviving intelligence and personality, \u2014not only surviving\r\nbut anxious and able with difficulty to communicate, \u2014is the simplest and most straightforward, and the only one\r\nthat fits all the facts.\" He is quite justified therefore when\r\nhe says {Raymond, p. 85), in defending the bringing forward\r\nof his new evidence, \" I myself considered the case of survival\r\npractically proven before, and clinched by the efforts of Myers\r\nand others of the S.P.R. group on the other side ; but\r\nevidence is cumulative. . . . Each stick of the faggot must\r\nbe tested, and, unless absolutely broken, it adds to the\r\nstrength of the bundle.\"\r\nAnd there is no doubt that the stick this book adds to\r\nthe bundle is a solid and valuable contribution. To anyone\r\nwho may feel disappointed that the mass of evidence here\r\npresented is not greater, or more overwhelming, I may point\r\nout that good evidence of survival and communication is more difficult to devise\u2014quite apart from the difficulties\r\nthere clearly are in producing it\u2014than persons new to the\r\nsubject are apt to think. One great difficulty is that the\r\npossibility of thought-reading from the sitter has to be excluded. To put this difficulty in Sir Oliver Lodge's own\r\nwords : \"The gradually recognised possibility of what may\r\nbe called normal telepathy, or unconscious mind-reading\r\nfrom survivors, raises hesitation\u2014felt by most studious and\r\nthoughtful people\u2014about accepting such messages as irre- fragable evidence of persistent personal existence ; and to overcome this . . . difficulty, it is demanded that facts shall\r\nbe given which are unknown to anyone present, and can\r\nonly be subsequently verified \"\r\n(p. 346).\r\nSpace forbids my attempting to give even in outline any\r\naccount of special incidents, but I may mention that among\r\nthose fully described the one which best meets the above\r\ncondition is the group-photograph case,\r\n1 of which the details\r\nwill be found in Chapter IV. of Part II. The E.A. incident\r\n(pp. 243-46), of which, however, full particulars are not given, seems also to have been a remarkable one. I should like\r\nalso to call attention to the \" Honolulu \" incident (pp. 212,\r\n215-16, 271-75). This incident includes correct references\r\n1 This is the case described even more fully than in Raymond in Sir Oliver Lodge's paper (Proc. S.P.R. , Part LXXL, pp. 132 ff.).\r\nlxxiv.] Review. 407\r\nto songs sung by Raymond, and an interesting correspondence\r\nbetween a sitting with a medium in London and a con- temporaneous family sitting at Birmingham. Incidentally\r\nI think it throws light on conditions of communication. But\r\nwe must admit with Sir Oliver Lodge that it does not completely exclude explanation by telepathy between living minds.\r\nA considerable number of the communications purporting\r\nto come from Raymond Lodge show knowledge which, while\r\nit can hardly have reached the medium in any normal manner,\r\nmay without improbability be accounted for by telepathy\r\nfrom the sitter or other living person. As already said,\r\nsuch cases cannot be used as distinctive evidence of communication from the dead. Nevertheless they strengthen that\r\nevidence indirectly by showing that supernormal power is at work.\r\nMy own provisional belief, based on a comparison of thoughttransference experiments with evidence of communication from\r\nthe dead, is that the latter is not different in kind from\r\ntelepathic communication between the living. In both cases we have\u2014as I believe\u2014communication between miiid and\r\nmind otherwise than through the senses. In both cases it apjiears generally to reach the normal consciousness of the\r\nrecipient in an uncertain, scrappy, and imperfect way, mixed\r\nwith ideas and associations appaiently imported by the re- cipient ; and in both cases, especially perhaps if the recipient\r\nof the communication is in trance, and therefore his normal\r\nconsciousness in abeyance, what is said is liable to have\r\nthe incoherence of dreams.\r\nI do not think Sir Oliver Lodge quite agrees about this,\r\nfor (on p. 330) he expresses a belief that the communicating\r\nintelligence with difficulty and imperfectly operates the brain\r\nof the medium in the place of the medium's own mind ; and he can hardly suppose that this happens when the communicator is a person in the body. At the same time he\r\ndoes not exclude my hypothesis\u2014at least as regards automatic\r\nwriting\u2014for he says (pp. 355-6), \" The intermediate mentality\r\nemployed in this process seems to be a usually submerged\r\nor dream-like stratum of the automatist. ... In some cases the content or subject-matter of the wiiting may emanate\r\nentirely from [this stratum] and be of no more value than a\r\n408 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwiclc. [part\r\ndream. . . . But when the message turns out .to be of evidential\r\nvalue it is presumably because this subliminal portion of the\r\nperson is in touch, either telepathically or in some other way,\r\nwith intelligences not ordinarily accessible,\u2014with living people\r\nat a distance perhaps, or more often with the apparently\r\nmore accessible people who have passed on.\"\r\nAs regards the mixed, and therefore untrustworthy, nature\r\nof the communications he is in entire agreement with me,\r\nand frequently warns the reader th?t they cannot be taken\r\nat their face value without examination. For instance, on\r\np. 180, \" It is unlikely that lucidity is constant all the time,\r\nand Feda \" [the so-called control of the medium through\r\nwhom the communication is supposed to come] \" may have\r\nto do some padding.\" Or again, p. 192, \" I should think\r\nmyself that they \" [i.e. statements about life on the other\r\nside] \" are of very varying degrees of value and peculiarly\r\nliable to unintentional sophistication by the medium.\" Or\r\nagain, on the same page, \" Some books, moreover, have been\r\nj^ublished of late, purporting to give information about ill- understood things in a positive and assured manner, and it\r\nis possible that the medium has read these and been influenced by them.\" Or again, on p. 269, \" A good deal of\r\nthis struck me as nonsense ; as it Feda had picked it up\r\nfrom some sitter. But I went on recording what was said.\"\r\nIt is certain, then, that no supposed communications,\r\nwhether through private persons or professional mediums,\r\nshould be accepted uncritically at their face value. But the\r\ndifficulty is greatly increased in the case of professional\r\nmediums for three reasons. Firstly, many of them\u2014perhaps\r\nmost, are more or less fraudulent. Even where there is some\r\nreal power it acts fitfully, and the temptation to supplement\r\ngenuine with manufactured evidence must often be great\r\nwhen the medium's living depends on satisfying sitters. My\r\nsecond and third reasons do not necessarily involve conscious\r\ndeception. The second is, that the need of producing something must tend to increase the amount of what may be\r\ncalled padding. The third is, that the effort to get into\r\nrelation with the affairs of a constant succession of new\r\nsitters and to give them tests is apt to develop a habit of\r\nfishing, of rapid inference from small indications, and of bold\r\nLXXIV.] Review. 409\r\nguessing. For these reasons I think resort to professional\r\nmediums is to be deprecated.\r\nSir Oliver Lodge in his wholesome advice to bereaved persons\r\n(pp. 342-3) also deprecates it for many people. \" It maybe asked,\" he says, \"do I recommend all bereaved persons\r\nto devote the time and attention which I have done to getting\r\ncommunications and recording them ? Most certainly I do\r\nnot. I am a student of the subject, and a student often\r\nundertakes detailed labour of a special kind. I recommend\r\npeople in general to learn and realise that their loved ones\r\nare still active and useful and interested and happy\u2014more\r\nalive than ever in one sense\u2014and to make up their minds\r\nto live a useful life till they rejoin them.\r\n\" What steps should be taken to gain this peaceful assur- ance must depend on the individual. Some may get it from\r\nthe consolations of religion, some from the testimony of\r\ntrusted people, while some may find it necessary to have\r\nfirst-hand experience of their own for a time. And if this\r\nexperience can be attained privately, with no outside assistance,\r\nby quiet and meditation or by favour of occasional waking\r\ndreams, so much the better.\"\r\nI am afraid that, notwithstanding this excellent advice,\r\nRaymond is likely to lead many people, who had much better\r\nnot do so, to go to professional mediums, and is likely to encourage a very undesirable trade. I can only hope that\r\nthe evil of this will be compensated by the comfort which\r\nthe book will bring to many mourners.
