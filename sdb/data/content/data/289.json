She had one sibling, a sister, who died in infancy.1\n\nHelen was educated at home by her mother before attending Newnham College to study classics, earning first class honours in the Classics Tripos. She afterwards read psychology for a year at the University of London and in 1913 was appointed Demonstrator of Psychology at King\u2019s College, London. She was elected a member of the British Psychological Society in 1914.\n\nAmong her friends she counted Aelfrida Tillyard, poet, mystic and briefly a disciple of the occultist Aleister Crowley. She was also a friend of the poet Rupert Brooke, whom she met at Cambridge before the First World War and helped with the production of comic plays.2\n\nIn 1915, she married William Henry Salter, a former pupil of her father who was also to become a prominent member of the SPR, serving as president in 1947-48. The marriage ceremony was conducted by Rev MA Bayfield, a family friend and active member of the Society. The couple had two children, Imogen (b 1926) and Martin (b 1929).\n\nShe held public offices in local government, including chair of the Saffron Walden Rural District Council from 1937 to 1947. She later became an Income Tax Commissioner, a post she held until her death in 1959.  Psychical Research\n\nHelen Salter\u2019s mother Margaret Verrall was intensely interested in psychical research, joining the SPR in 1889 and being elected to its governing council in 1901. The family home at 5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge was the scene of s\u00e9ances with mediums, and experiments such as crystal gazing and table turning. 3 As a five-year old, Helen took part in telepathy experiments with her mother.4 She played games with Frederic Myers, a founder member of the SPR, and also knew the SPR\u2019s first president Henry Sidgwick, his wife Eleanor, and Richard Hodgson, one of the Society\u2019s most active investigators of mediums.\n\nMargaret Verrall\u2019s experiments included automatic writing, in which the hand writes material that appears not to originate in the conscious mind. Following the death of Myers in 1901, statements &nbsp;that appeared to originate from his surviving mind began to feature in her scripts. In the following years, interlinking references relating to Myers and other deceased colleagues multiplied in her trance writings and those of other mediums and automatists, generating the body of survival evidence referred to as the Cross-Correspondences. Encouraged by her mother, Helen produced her first script in 1903, aged twenty (see more below).  Society for Psychical Research\n\nSalter joined the SPR in 1905 and in 1910 was appointed assistant to Alice Johnson, the research officer. She was then research officer from 1916 to 1921, and editor of the SPR Journal and Proceedings from 1916 to 1929 and 1946 respectively. She joined the SPR Council in 1921, a position she held for thirty-nine years.\n\nIn 1915 she started teaching psychical research to third-year psychology students at King\u2019s College, London. This was the first course of its kind, but her pioneering role has largely gone unacknowledged.  Salter\u2019s Researches  Angel of Mons\n\nIn 1915, Salter undertook an investigation of reports emanating from the battlefields of northern France, of visions of supernatural entities intervening to support the Allies. This was the SPR\u2019s most significant wartime investigation, published in its Journal as \u2018An Enquiry Concerning \u201cThe Angel at Mons\u201d\u2019. Under the presidency of FCS Schiller, the Society had set a sceptical tone towards wartime phenomena and this enquiry was no exception, concluding, against contemporary popular opinion, that fatigue was the likely explanation. But Salter\u2019s research broke new ground in establishing the problems of interpreting eyewitness testimony.  Gladys Leonard\n\nTowards the end of World War I, Salter conducted research on the medium Gladys Leonard, initially in participation with the novelist Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall and Radclyffe-Hall\u2019s partner Una Vincenzo (Lady Troubridge). The committee held a total of 73 sittings, some of which featured communicators who identified themselves as Margaret and Arthur Verrall, Salter\u2019s deceased parents. The experiments included \u2018book tests\u2019 in which the medium accurately identified passages in volumes in distant locations that she could have no way of knowing.5  Eva C\n\nIn 1920, Salter joined a SPR committee charged with examining Marthe B\u00e9raud, a young French girl whose apparent ability to produce materialized forms in s\u00e9ances had been investigated by French researchers Charles Richet and Gustave Geley and, in considerable depth, by Albert von Schrenck-Notzing in Munich.6 &nbsp;Forty sittings were held with Marthe (now referred to pseudononymously as \u2018Eva Carriere\u2019 or \u2018Eva C\u2019) under relatively strict control conditions at the SPR offices in Hanover Square. &nbsp;The phenomena fell far short of that reported earlier: the researchers observed various substances, disc-like shapes, pointed objects, hands and faces (the latter appearing roughly drawn and flat), like photographs, but were unable to reach a firm conclusion about them.  Telepathy Experiments\n\nSalter returned frequently to the study of telepathy. An early contribution to the Journal was a 1915 paper on thirty-four experiments with two sisters, Louisa and Kathleen Tipping, at the SPR offices in London. Of these nine were successful, a result she considered inconclusive.\n\nTrials with volunteers the same year yielded one successful subject, who, aided by hypnosis, received \u2018vivid mental pictures\u2019 in experiments with Salter acting as \u2018sender\u2019.7\n\nTogether with her husband, Salter had success in informal experiments with Gilbert Murray, a former SPR president with an apparent gift for telepathic perception.8\n\nIn a large-scale experiment, a radio appeal for listeners\u2019 experiences resulted in a postbag of 400 letters, of which 58 were found to be potentially evidential. This research was published in book form as Evidence for Telepathy in 1934 and as a chapter in the 1936 volume Essays in Honour of Gilbert Murray. Here Salter stressed the general unreliability of memory, especially when emotionally charged, and the consequent need for full contemporaneous documentation and witness corroboration.\n\nOther of Salter\u2019s conclusions about telepathy \u2013 for instance that it cannot be trained, and that laboratory experiments should use \u2018gifted\u2019 subjects (those deemed to have a special faculty for it) &nbsp;\u2013 were largely confirmed by later researchers. She doubted whether an emotional bond between two individuals is required for telepathic interaction, pointing to spontaneous cases involving strangers, although bonded pairs such as twins and couples have been found by contemporary experimentalists to be especially promising subjects. She also observed that communication with the dead, if it occurs, should be classed as telepathy.9  Cross-Correspondences\n\nSalter grew up in the world of the cross-correspondences, her mother Margaret Verrall not only producing seemingly evidential scripts as an automatist, but also analysing them as a researcher. In 1906 it was noticed that scripts produced by different automatists appeared to be connected \u2013 without their knowledge and in the absence of any communication between them \u2013 from which it was inferred that they might be being directed by discarnate personalities, to provide evidence of having survived death. &nbsp;Encouraged by her mother, Salter began to experiment with trance writing, producing automatic scripts in quantity from 1907 and continuing until 1932.10\n\nAs an example: in 1907, scripts produced by Verrall at her home in Cambridge were found to contain a drawing of three arrows. The following day Leonora Piper, a Boston medium, received a message, purportedly from the deceased Richard Hodgson, to the effect that he had given an \u2018arrow\u2019 to Margaret Verrall. Five days later, Salter, in a different location and unaware of these messages, similarly produced an arrow during an automatic writing session.11\n\nSalter also worked on the interpretation of messages. One of her earliest publications in the Journal (1911) considered to what extent the appearance of them being linked might be put down to chance. Her later work included an analysis (1914) of trance writing material produced by five siblings of the Mckinnon family,12 and in 1938 a possible communication from her father (\u2018A Sermon in St Paul\u2019s\u2019).13  Selected Works  Books\n\nEvidence for Telepathy: The Response to a Broadcast Request for Cases (1934).
