For vvhiift they difregard\nthe teiti1nony of their fenfes, and indolently\nafTent to things on the credit of others.\nthey remain pailive dupes to their own credu-\nlity, and feldom examine whether they are\nright or \\Vrong. An error thus admitted, is\nreluCtantly corred:cd, and becomes the copious\nfource from \\vhich nutnberlefs faHe opinions\nflo\\v.\nThere are perhaps but few that are not diffi-\ndent in deviating fro1n principies efiablifhed by\nn1en of general crud ition, w hofe geniufe~ were\nqualified to interrogate nature 'vith fuccefs :-\nB\u00b7It an error once difcovered fhould be imme-\ndiately correCted, in oppofition to the ipfe dixz\u00b7t\nof all the dogmatifis of fevcntecn centuries.-\nMan by nature poffeffes a niju.r .formativus, and\nB\n\f( 10 )\nis as prone to novelty and invefiigation, as the\nearth is to revolve from ungovetnable laws of\nnature. Yet~ there are few difcoveries in tLe.\nhealing art but what n1eet \\V ith tumultuous op-\npofition, from the congregated legions of rre-\njudice, ignorance and an1bition. Some nomi-\nnal philofophers difbelieve every propoGtion\nthat does not accord with the infallible doc-\ntrines of their imn1aculate ancefiors; and others\nare fo extremely illiberal, as to difcard every\nnew principle in which they can have no claim\nto interefi. A glaring example of the latter\n\\Ve have, in the degrading denunciations of the\nEngli01 philofophers, \u00b7when the illufirious Dr.\n\u00b7Franklin's difcovery of the identity of Light-\nning and EleCtricity vvas firft delivered to the\n\u00b7\u00b7world. A fecond, no lefs true, we have in\nthe difcovery of Dr. Perkins' Metallic Opera-\ntion, \u00b7which vvill like the former arife triunl-\nphant atnid11 the counter, but [utile, vocifera-\ntion of prejudice and ignorance. Some rejec1\nthe latter, becaufe they vvere not t.he inventors.\nOthers quefiion the tefi:imony of their fenfes,\nbecaufe they cannot explain the modus operandi\nthereof, by referring it to the good old doc-\ntrines of Van Hehnont, Doleus, or Stahl.\nYet the happy day is perhaps not far diftant,\n.when envy mufi: fall a facrifice to truth, and\nbehold this problern accounted for, on a o.ative\n\u00b7law of the animal reconomy.\nThat the bodies of ani1nals poffefr a fluiJ\nanalogous to electricity, haJ long been fufpett-\ned by Phyiiologifis and other fpeculative phi-\nlofophers. The n1atter long refted ho\u00b7wever ott\n\f( I I )\npure conjecture alone, and the apparent intri-\ncacy of the fubjeCJ: depreifed the hopes of the\nbolJe!l: experi1nenters. But accident not un-\nfrequently does more for the real advancement\nof fcience, than boai~ed art and genius are able\nto accotnpliih. It was accident that firll: fug-\ngefied to th~ celebrated Gallz'leo, the,~~con:O:ruc\u00ad\ntion of that optical infl:rument denominated the\ntelefcope. It was accident that firfi led the\nimmortal Ne\u00b7wton to the original conception of\nthat principle of gravitation, by which he af-\nterwards cxplaineJ with fuch facility the\nnlO\\'ements and ex qudite balance of the tnate-\nrial univerfe. It \u00b7was alfo acciJent-that firft\nfuggeited to the ingenious and indufirious Gal-\n~uani, the n1ode of experimenting \\Vith effeCt on\nthe fublime and intricate fubjeet of Anitnal\nElectricity. '' \\Vhilfi Profe!for (;a!vani was\nengaged ii1 diffeCting a frog, in a room \\Vhere\nfome of his friends \\Vere amufing then1felves\n\\vith an electrical-machine, one of them drev;\n~ fpark from the, conduCtor,. at the fame in-\n.fl:ant that the profelTor tou~hed one of the\nnerves of the animal. In an initant the \\Vhole\nbody of the frog \\Vas iliook by a violent con-\nvulfiun. The profe:l.for was afroniilied at the\nphenomenon, and believed it owing to his hav-\ning v.rounded the nerve. 1'o a:l.fure himfelf\n\\vhether this \u00b7was really the cafe or not, he\npricked it \\Vith the point of his knife;. he the.n\ntouched the nerve with the inftrument as at firft,\nand ordered a fpark to be taken from the rna-\u00b7\nchine ; on \\V hich the contractions \\vere renew-\ncd. 'The experi1nent \\Vas repeated a third\nB 2\n\f( 12 )\ntitne, but the animal rc1nained tnotionlcfs.-\nHovJeYer, upon perceiving that he held his\nfcal pel by the handle, \\Y hich \\\\';1s of ivary (a\nbad conductor) he changed it for a n1etallic\nor~e, and re-excited the n1oven1cnts, which he\nconfiantly failed of doing -vvhilfi ufing an elec-\ntric fubftance. \u00b7 After having rnadc a nutnber\nof experi tnents 'vith the electrical tnachine, he\nrefolved to profecute the fubjeet \\Vith atrnof-\npherical electricity. vVith this view he raiied\na conductor upon the roof of his houfe, fron1.\n\\vhich he brought an iron \\Vire into his rooxn,\nto this attached n1etal conductors, connected\nv.rit h the nerves of the anin1als defiined to be\nthe fubjec1s of his expcritnents, and to their\nlegs he tied -vvires \u00b7which reached the floor.-\nConfiderable rnoven1ents \\Vere obferved in the\nanimals whether of cold or \\varn1 blood \\V hen-\never it lightened. T'hefe preceded thunder,\nand corrcfponded \\Vith its intenfity, and even\ntook place when any Hanny cloud paifed over\nthe apparatus. 'Vith fitnilar vie\\vs he fufpend-\ned frogs on Inetal hooks fixed in the fpine of\nthe back, upon the iron railing of his garJrn;\nfeveral tin1es he retnarked that thefe anitnals\ncontracted, and appe~red to receive fhocks .-\nAt firfi he conceived the rnove:rncnts 'verc ow-\ning to changes in the atrnofphere, but a\nn1ore fcrupulous exarnination undeceived hitn.\n-H'1ving placed a prepared frog upon an iron\nplate in his room, and hQpp~ning \\Vith his dif-\nfec.ting forceps to prefs it againft the plate, he\nobferved the 1novtmcnts to take place.

J)r. Valli, an\nItalian phyfician, was the 11rfi that co-operated\nvv\u00b7ith the celebrated Galvani, in invefiigating\nthat animal fluid the exifience of v.rhich had\nbeen fo long fufpeeled, but fo ]ately realized\nby aB:ual experi1nent. After repeating the ex-\npcrirr,ents of his predeccffor, and infl:ituting n\nferies of experitnents fuf11ciently tedious and\n. lengthy, Dr. Valli conceives hitnfelf unequivo-\ncally authorized to conclude, that the anirnal\nf1 uid of Galvani, was entirely the fan1e wiLh\nthe ful\u2022tle Jnatter of electricity. rfhis conclu-\nfion he alledges to be the fpontaneous and ne-\nceffary refult of the fo1lo\u00b7wing pofitions, wbich\nhe delivers as fubflantiated and confirrned by\n~1..C1:ual experitncnt :\n\" I 11, Subfrances which conduct electricity,\nare condut1ors likewife of the nervous fluid.

In fucceffion\nto Dr. Valli, Mr. fowler entered the lift of\nphilofophers, in invefiigating the fublimc but\nintricate fubjecl: of Anitnal Electricity. A,nd\nto ufe his O'-Vn \\Vords, \" i\\fter,\" fays he, \" a\ngreat variety of experin1cnts of \\vhich it \\vould\nbe unneceffary here to relate 1110re than the\nrefult, I found, that I could not excite in an\n\f( 15 )\nanitnal the appearances defcribecl by Galvani,\n\\V ith any fubftances whatever, w hcther folid or\n:fluid, except the metals : and that the mutual\ncontatt of two metals \\Vith each other, fo far\nas I wa5 able to detennine, \\Vas in every cafe\nneceffary to the etTec1.\" And after findhing a\nferies of experiments, a feries fufficiently nu-\nmerous and diverfified for the d1ablifhment of\ngeneral principles, J:\\11 r. Fowler favours us \\vith\nthe following concluGons refpeCting the nature\nof the nervous fluid. When lnving fl:ated a\nfe\\v analogies between the animal fluid of Ga\/...\nvani, and that of the Torpedo, &c. he then re-\nverfes the comparifon and lays do\" n feveral\npoints of what he terms effential difference, not\nonly bet ween the two preceding fluids, but alfo\nbetween the fluid of Galvani, and the matter of\nelectricity. \" This influence,\" fays he, (re-\nferring to the nervous fluid of animals) differs\nboth fron1 that of the 'Iorj'edo, &c. and from\neleCtricity, in producing no fenfation (in man\nat leafr) :at all fimilar to that of an electrical\nfhock. 'fhey however produce a difagreeable\nfenfation, even in frogs, independent of that\n'vhich mufi neceffarilv arife from irritation and\nInufcular contraCtion.J\" But the mofi impor-\ntant and characteriftic difference which I have\nyet difcovered between this new influence and\nelectricity, confiils in their efFects upon the\ncontracl:ile po\\vers of animals. Electricity has\na tendency to defiroy that povver UfOD which\ncontratt:ion derends; vv hereas the n1etals have\nin all my experiments had the directly oppofite\netfec1. \" Oxygene is, fo far as I know, the\n\f( )\non.l.y fiinHdu:; in nature, whofe cfiects are at all\nanalogous.\u00b7:* T'hc difference here tnentioned\nby Mr. Fowler) is in tny opinion 111ere!y owing\nto the various degrees of the powc~s applied,\nand not to any fpecifir or elementary difFeTencc\nin the powers the1nfdves. 1'he electrical fhock\nis injurious and deleterious fron1 cxcefs, but in\ncafes of diminifhed n1obility frorn pan'tlyft~,\ncontufion, &c. it is not only a falutary but an\ninvaluable fiitnulis, and happily fitted to re-\nfrorc the contractile po\u00b7wers of the fyftem.-\nF'rotn \\vhence then :uifes this dfential difference\ndefcribcd by i.Vlr.
