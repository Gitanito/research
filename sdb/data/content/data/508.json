Of the two, it is more important at present\nthat our position should be as thoroughly and as widely as possible\nunderst-ood .by our friends-I mean by those who are willing to co-\noperate with us; since, up to the present time, those hostile to our\nwork have mostly delivered their criticisms from so V6ry broad and\ndistant a view of it, that it would be too sanguine to hope that they\ncould be affected by any explanations of details.\nThe point to which I refer is our claim to be a scientific society, and\nto carry on our work in a scientific spirit and by scientific methods.\nSome not unfriendly critics have urged on me that this pretension is\nabsurd: \"You may be right,\" they say, \"but at any rate it is a pitched\nbattle between you and modern science; if you win, modern science\nwill receive a hard blow.\" If this were true, I for one should entirely\ndecline so unequal a struggle; but we hold it to be the reverse of true.\n__ We admit, of course, that the majority of scientific experts still keep\naloof from us, and that the agreement of experts is the final test of the\nestablishment of truths ;-indeed we may apply to the scientific world\nwhat an eminent statesman has said of the political world, that the\nmain duty of a minority is to try to turn itself into a majority. But\nthis is just what we hope to do; not so much by direct controversy, as\nby patiently and persistently endeavouring to apply to the obscure\nmatters which we are studying methods as analogous as circumstances\nallow to those by which scientific progress has been made in other\ndepartments.\nAnd even now I conceive that the conflict between our view-\neither the general aSsumption on which we proceed or the particular\nfacts which our committees claim to have established-and the views of\nS\nDigitized by Google\n\f246 President's Address. [July 18,\nthe majority of scientific men, is really much less profound than many\nconflicts that go on within the field of recognised science. For there\nwe contiilUally see an internecine struggle of opposing positive doctrines;\nbut' what we have opposed to us is not really any positive doctrine\nor proved method of another school of inquirers-much less any\nestablished positive conclusion of science-but mere sweeping negations\nof persons who have mostly given no study or thought to the matters\nabout which they deny; or, at any rate, a mere general presumption\nagainst what appears to have no affinity to facts already systematised.\nWith the few positive contributions which physicists or physiologists\nhave offered towards the explanation of the phenomena we are\ninvestigating, we have no conflict whatever. We recognise in almost\nall cases a partial truth in such explanations; what we maintain is that\n.a careful comparison of them with the facts shews them to be inadequate_\nA very different objection seems to be sometimes felt to our\nattitude of scientific inqui.rers by some of the persons who are in\nthe best position for assisting our investigations. I mean persons who\nbelieve themselves to have certain knowledge on the most important\nmatters on which we are seeking evidence, who do not doubt that they\nhave received communications from an unseen world of spirits, but who\nthink that such communications should be kept as sacred mysteries\nand not exposed to be scrutinised in the mood of cold curiosity which\nthey conceive to belong to science. Now we do not wish to appear m-\ntrusive; at the same time we are anxious not to lose through mere\nmisunderstanding any good opportunities for investigation: and I\ntherefore wish to assure such persons that. we do not approach these\n1l1atters in any light or trivial spirit, but with an ever-present sense of\nthe vast importance of the issues involved, and with every desire to\n:give reverence wherever reverence is found to be due. But we feel\nbound to begin' by taking these experiences, however important and\nhowever obscure, as a part of the great aggregate which we call\nNature; and we must ascertain carefully and systematically their\nimport, their laws and causes, before we can rationally take up any\ndefinite attitude of mind with regard to them. The unknown or\nuncommon is not in itself an object of reverence; there is no sacredness\nin the mere limitations of our knowledge.\nThis, then, is what we mean by a scientific spirit; that we approach\nthe subject without prepossessions, but with a single-minded desire to\nbring within the realm of orderly and accepted knowledge what now\nappears as a chaos of individual beliefs. In saying that our 11l.ethoth\nare scientific, we do not of course pretend to possess any technical\nknowledge or art, needing elaborate training. \"Science,\" as an eminent\nnaturalist has said, \"is only organised common-sense;\" and on ground\nso very new as most of that is on which we are trying to advance, the\nigitized byGoogl\n\f1883.J Presidentj\n8 A.ddre88. 247\norganisation of common-sense, which we call scientific method, must\nnecessarily be very rude and tentative. Indeed, the value to us of the\nscientific experts whom we are glad to count among our number\ndepends much less on any technical knowledge or skill thau on the\ngeneral habit of mind-what I may call the \"higher common-sense\"-\nwhich their practice of scientific investigation has gi...en to them j\nsomewhat greater readiness and completeness in seeing considerations\nand adopting measure\\'! which, when once suggested, are not only\nintelligible, but even obvious, to the common-sense of mankind at large.\nFor instance, nothing can be JIlore obvious than the need of making\nas systematic and extensive a collection of facts as possible; partly in\norder to establish as fact what, we believe, can only be established by\nsuch an accumulation of evidence; and partly in order to obtain by\nclassifioationa general view of the leading characteristics of the facts, so\nthat we may be started in a right direction for investigating their con-\nditions. But this need does not seem to be thoroughly understood. Thus\na representative of the intelligent public has informed us that we have\nnow given facts enough, and that the intelligent public now demands\nfrom us a satisfactory theory ofthem. Speaking for myself, I am afraid\nI must ask the intelligent public to restrain its impatience for a year or\ntwo more: a restraint which hardly ought to be difficult, considering\nthe length of time for which it has remained in a state of contented\nnescience on these subjects. Again, a friend who has sent me a valuable\nfirst-hand narrative of Thought-transference at a distance, has thought\nit needful to apologise, on the ground that we\" must be inundated with\nthese stories.,. Well, it is in one sense true that we are inundated; the\nstream of them keeps flowing in more strongly than I had anticipated;\nbut we wish to be still more inundated-the tide is a favourable one\nand it cannot rise too high for our purposes.\nAnd this leads me to speak of the desire 'which the Council enter-\ntain to get as much co-operation as possible in the experimental work\nof the Society. We have endeavoured by the\" Circular No.1,\" priDted\nin our last Proceedings, to stimulate the formation of local committees\nand independent centres of investigation in the subjects, especially, of\nThought-transference and Mesmerism. I am sorry to say that this\ncircular has so far produced little effect: I wish, therefore, earnestly to\ncall the attention of our members to it, and emphasise our desire forthe\nkind of co-operation which it suggests. Any great increase in the\nnumbers of the committees appointed by the Council seems undesir-\nable: but these committees would be glad to give the benefit of their\nexperience, in any way that may be desired, to any local committees\nthat may be started on an independent basis for this kind of research-\nor supposing such local committees to prefer complete independence,\nwe should be no less glad to avail ourselves of their results. In short.\nDigitized by Gougle\n\f248 President'8 Addres8. [July 18~\nif any member or associate of our Society feels moved to assist in any\npart of our work, and does not find that the circular to which I have\nreferred gives him sufficient guidance as to the best method of doing\nthis, he has only to write to the secretary of the committee whose sphere\nof operations interests him most, and the committee will do their best\nto find for him a useful line of co-operation.\nI have said that we cannot have too many well-attested narratives.\nor records of experiments, even with a vi9W to establishing the general\ntrustworthiness of the results. The reason for this lies in the impossi-\nbility, or extreme difficulty, of absolutely excluding, in anyone case\ntaken by itself, explanations of the phenomenon recorded which refer\n,it to causes already recognised by science. This leads me back to the\nquestion of the scientific method of dealing with the evidence attested;\nas to which, again, w~ find ourselves in prima facie opposition with\nthe majority of scientific men. But here, again, as I have said, the-\nopposition does not arise from any general unwillingness on our part to\naccept the explanations of our opponents; on the contrary, we a.re\nespecially anxious to give them all due weight in the collection and\ntreatment of our evidence. We only refuse to admit them where we\nfind that the hypotheses manifestly will not fit the facts.\nThus, e.g., before coming to our conclusion as to Thought-trans-\nference we considered carefully the arguments brought forward for\nregarding cases of so-called \"Thought-reading\" as due to involuntary\nindications apprehended through the ordinary senses; and we\ncame to the conclusion that the ordinary experiments, where\ncontact was allowed, could be explained by the hypothesis of un-\nconscious sensibility to involuntary muscular pressure. Hence we have\nalways attached special importance to experiments in which contact\nwas excluded; with regard to which this particular hypothesis is clearly\nout of court.\nAgain, take Faraday'S well-known experiments on table-turning.\nI have no doubt that Faraday rendered a real public service in prevent-\ning ignorant persons from supposing an unknown force required to\nexplain the turning round of a drawing-room table when a group sit\ndown to it in an evening party. And if the eminent physicist had been\nable to explain, 4t the same simple and effective way, the rarer but yet\nstrongly attested cases in which tables are reported to have moved\nwithout contact, or to have risen altogether off the ground, he would\nhave really \" exploded the whole nonsense\" of table-lifting. But we\nsubmit that it is not a scientific way of dealing with a mass of\ntestimony to explain what you' can, and say that the rest is untrue.\nIt maybe common-sense; but it is not science.\nHere, however, our more careful opponents, when they cannot find a\nphysical explanation for the facts related,fallback on various psychologi\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.] Pre8ident'~ .Ad(fl'e88. 249\n-cal explanations of the fact that they are related. They say that the\nreporters have been deceived by \"conjuring tricks\" or illuded by\n\"expectant attention,\" or led into involuntary exaggeration from the\nimpulse to entertain their hearers with marvels, or have laid undue\nstress on accidental coincidences,through oblivion or non-observation of\ninstances on the other side:-or when there is nothing else left they sim-\nply say, with more or less polite circumlocution, that we or our in-\nformants must be telling lies.\nHere, again, we admit that every one of the suggested causes-..-not\n-excluding the last-has bet'n, in the history of human delusion, a 'Vera\n.caUBa of marvellous narratives; and the whole detail of our procedure\nin the different departments of our inquiry is governed by the need of\ncarefully excluding them. What we venture to think unscientific is\n__ the loose way in which our opponents fling them about, without any\nproper attempt to determine the limits within which they are probable.\nThus, e.g., when a man pays a guinea to attend a spiritualistic\n-exhibition in a room over which the recipient of the money has perfeo,t\n.control, it is reasonable to attribute to preparation and sleight of hand\nwhatever of the results could be produced by a professional conjurer on\nJlis platform; but it is not, therefore, equally probable that similar\nresults in a private dinino-room are due to the hitherto latent conjuring\npowers of the housemaid. When a man goes to a house which he knows\nto be haunted, it is not a noteworthy fact that he dreams of a ghost; or\n-even if he lies awake at night in a nervous condition, he is likely to\nmistake the rattle and sigh of thll wind for evidences of ghostly visitants ;\nbut it is not, therefore, plausible to refer to \"expectancy\" apparitions\nfor which the seers are \"holly unprepared, and which they at first take\n.calmly for their relatives. When a marvellous story is told af~r dinner\nby a person who heard it from a friend of the cousin of the man who\nwas actually there, we may reasonably suppose that an indefinite\n\u00b7amount of thrilling detail has been introduced in the course of tradition,\n-especially if the links in the chain of tradition are supplied by persons\nwho are not accustomed to regard scientific accuracy as important\nin these matters; but it is not therefore legitimate to explain in\nthis way a narrative which is taken direct from the diary of the original\n\u00b7eyewitness. We may ultimately be able to shew that the whole mass\nof evidence presented to us under each of these heads is clearly\nexplicable by causes which all will admit to be natural: but I cannot\nthink that this result will be attained without a more careful and\npatient examination of the evidence than our critics deem it worth\nwhile to give.\nFor the purpose, then, of this examination, our primary endeavour\nis to collect phenomena, where explanations like those above mentioned\nhave at least a high degree of improbability. In no single case can the\nDigitized by Google\n\f250 P,\"esidcnt's Addres8.

For all records of experiments\nmust depend, ultimately, on the probity and intelligence of the persons\nrecording them; and it is impossible for us, or any other investigators,\nto demonstrate to persons who do not know us that we are not\nidiotically careless or consciously mendacious. We can only hope that\nwithin the limited circle in which we are known, either alternative will\nbe regarded as highly improbable.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.].

SeC'retaf\"lJ.\nThe experiments recounted in the first Mesmeric Report took\n__us up to II. certain defined point. They were conclusive as to the pro-\ndllction of a very singular physical and mental state in the \"subjects \"\nof them; but the majority of them contained no conclusive indication\nof any peculiar or specific influence, exercised by the organismor the\nwill of one person on the organism or will of another. It has long\nbeen known that the fixation of the eyes in a particular manner\nwhich slightly strains their muscles, or a gentle monotonous\nstimulation such as that produced by passes, or even the monotonous\nticking of a watch held to the ear, win throw the nervous\nsystem of II. sensitive\" subject\" into an abnormal state, in which he is\nat the mercy of a \"dominant idea,\" or of external suggestions and\ncommands, and responds to them in an automatic way. Facts of this\nsort, and the theories of nervous change by which they may be accounted\nfor, are clQssed together under the name of Hypnotism; what distin-\nguishes Hypnotism, as a thcory, from Mesmerism being just this-that\nthe one denies and the other affirms\u00b7 the existence, in certain cases, of II.\n8peci.ficinjluence 0'1' effluence,passing from the operatQr to the\" subject.\"\nWe should be the first to admit that the commoner of the phenomena\npopularly styled \"mesmeric,\" those, for instance,associated with platform\nexhibitions,are for the most part quite explicable on the hypnotic hypo-\nthesis-in other words, that fixation of certain muscles, or gentle mono-\ntonous stimulation of one of the senses, is competent to produce a con-\ndition in which the normal cOlltrol of ideas and choicc of movements is\ntoo. great extent abolished. It is, however, worth while to remark that\neven the more ordinary exhibitions suggest points which have not been\nsufficiently noticed by those who reject all idea of any specific influence.\nFirstly, the objection to the sufficiency of the hypnotic explanation,\nfrom the faot that some persons can operate successfully and others\n\u2022 THB COUIICIL HOLDS ITSBLF GIIIIIERAJ.LY IIBSPONSIBLE Fun THE REPORTS OF ITS COllXITTEES.\nAT TJlIII HIIIAD OF EACH RRI'OUT THill IIAMRS OF TIIOSR llEllBRRS OF COMlIITTEE WHO ARB\nSPEOIALLY RESPONSIBLE 1\"011 ITS COXPOSITION ARE MARKED WITH ASTEIlISK8.\nDigitized by Google\n\f252 Second lleport 0\/ tile Oommittee on Mesmeri8m. [July 18,\ncannot, has never been realised or met. There are all varieties both\nof powl:'r and of susceptibility; But if we take a casual group of persons,\nomitting those who are in no degree susceptible, we shall probably find\nthat they be arranged somewhat in the following order. A and B can\nhypnotise tltemselves, either by the inward and upward squint, or, as it\nmay sometimes seem, by mere imagination and expectancy. C and D\ncannot hypnoti~e themselves, but can be hypnotised by gentle\nrhythmical stroking at the hand of almost anyone. E and F can be\nslowly and partially affected by almost.any one, but immediately and\nthoroughly by a given \"mesmerist,\" X. And the rest of the letters of\nthe alphabet can be sent into the sleep-waking state by X, and by X\nalone, even though they may have no previous notion that X can affect\nthem-nay, even though they are distinctly told that it is not X but Y\n~vho will be able to control them. In such 0. case-as we have our-\u00b7\nselves seen-Y may be as Goliath and X as David in comparison, but\nthe big man will not succeed in doing in an hour what the small man\n. who has the specific gift will do in five minutes.*\nSecondly: Just as X alone can send these persons into the trance,\nso X alone can awake them out of it. It is very easy to take care\nthat the subject sho.ll have no previous notion that X alone will be\n, able to wake him; and, as a matter of fact, the most striking illustra-\ntions of this thesis are cases where every one present, mesmerist in-\ncluded, is new to mesmerism, and believes that anyone who chooses\ncan wake any \"subject 1\/ up again. The typical case is somewhat as\nfollows. A group of persons at an evening party begin to mesmerise\neach other in joke. One of the guests sends a schOOlboy to sleep,\nand drives off, thinking nothing more about it. At\u00b7 the end of the\nevening the boy's parents try to wake him up. They cannot do so I\nThe boy begins to rave, all;d is worse when touched or spoken to.\nNext morning they send in alarm for the guest who has done the\nmischief. He succeeds in waking the boy, but the experiment is\nfollowed by a week of headache and depression.\nThis brings us to a third point, tending to shew th~ reality of the\nmesmeric influence, namely, the distress and even danger which some-\ntimes follows on cro88-rnesmeruation-on passes, that is to say, made by\nZ upon a person whom X has already mesmerised, and over whom X\nmay make passes as often as he likes with only a soothing result. .In\nsuch acase, Z's passes or personal contact mayvery probably have no effect\n* Nothing in Heidenhain's treatment of the subject is more unsatisfactory\nthan his attempt to account for the existing differences in the power of pro-\nducing the result by differences of temperature, moisture, and style,of movement.\nin the several operators' hands. All that is needed, according to his own theory,\nis gentle monotonous stimulation. The number of hands in the world whose\n\"moisture, temperature, and style of movement\" are, or can be made, such as to\nallow of this BOrt ofstimulation, are clearly innumerable; and the fact of whon,.\n-exceptional operative powers is thus left quite unexplained.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.] Second Repo'rt of the Oommittee on Mes111e1'ism. 253\nwhatever; but in a specially sensitive\" subject\" they sometimes bring\n.about a state of mental chaos, of alternating violence and bewilderment\nwhi.::h, though it almost always subsides after a time, constitutes a risk\nagainst which experimenters in mesmerism must before all things be\non their guard. To the reality o! this singular state, whatever its\n-cause, we can testify from personal experience. Now the \"dominant\nidea,\" so far as it exists here, must be strong fear or dislike to all\nhuman beings except one; but inasmuch as there bas been nothing\nwhatever to suggest such an idea. to the \" subject's\" mind, its\n-existence is not an explanation, but 0. fact which itself seems explicable\n-only on the hypothesis of a special rapport established between the\n\" subject\" and his recognised controller.\nAnd fourthly, passing from these general characteristics of the\n--.,'Plesmeric state to more definite experiments, we may observe\nt1l:t.t even the rough platform exhibitions often present features\nwhich seem quite irrelevant to any theory of paralysis of the\nwill, or subjection of the mind to a suggested idea. A boy, for\ninstance, is told that he may bave a sovereign if he can pick\nit up. He struggles to do so till the sweat runs down his face; while\nhis countenance, so far from being blankly acquiescent, is full of\nincredulity, resolution and rage. Sometimes he will succeed in doing\nwhat he is told he cannot do-he will wrench his Hat palm away from\nthe operator's Hat palm after an apparently desperate struggle. Can we\nsuppose that in these cases volitional power has been paralysed, or the\nnerve-functions normally associated with the desired acts inhibited,during\n.all the time that the boy has been vehemently struggliLg to perform\nthem ~ The theory which covered the cases of the frog stroked into\nimmobility, or the cock set staring at a chalk line, must be considerably\nstretched if it is to suffice us here. Or let us take a case in which the\nobvious effoct is a. mental one. A boy in a light state of trance is\nasked what is his name, and gives it; he is at once asked again, and\nnow (at the mesmerist's silent wish) he eannot remember it. It may be\nsaid that the idea that it is impossible to recall the name, though not\nvirtually expressed, is suggested to him by the very nature of the\nexperiment. But at any rate this idea is so far from being dominant\nin his mind that he will sit for half an hour hopefully struggling for\nthe word, as may be proved by asking him from time to time what he\nis thinking about. It may be answered: \"It is not needful that the\nsuggested idea should absorb the mind, but only that the brain should\nhave been thrown into such a state that particular centres or sets of\n(lonnections can easily be made to suffer inhibition of t;heir normal\n-functions. All that is neeess9.ry is to inhibit the nerve-activities which\nnormally accompany the boy's utterance of his name.\" But ~hat,then,\nare we to take as the immediate cause of such inhibition1 Surely the\nDigitized by Google\n\f,254 Second Report qfihe Oommittee on1lle8meri8m. [July 18~\nsuggested idea that the action is impo88ible. But here the boy's.\nconviction is that the action is p088ible,\u00b7 so that we shall have to conceive-\nthe inhibition as consequent on an idea which the boy at most imagines\nas present in 80me on8 else's mind, and which he persistently refuses t(}\nadmit into \/,is own. That is to say, we must credit with this singular\ninhibitory power an idea which is nevertheless unable to prevent its\nexact opposite from dominating consciousness. So that here again the\n.inhibitory theory will have to be stretched to embrace facts almost\ndirectly opposite to those which it was originally started to explain.\nClearly, however, public exhibitions are very ill-suited for producing\nconviction; nor is the platform the place for delicate experimentation.\nWe will therefore proceed to give a fe'Y samples of the more conclusive\nresults, indicative of the specific mesmeric influence, which we have\nobtained in private. We hoped to have by this time added largely to\ntheir number; but have, unfortunately, been prevented from doing this\nby the illness of the operator whom we were employing.\nProminent among these are various phenomena belonging to the\nclass of mesmeric rapport. Of the subdivisions of this class, the one\nmost widely attested by previous observers is perhaps that of community\nof sensation between the operator and th('l \"subject\"; and to us the\nresults obtained in this department are of special interest, owing to their\nbearing on those further phenomena of Thought-transference between\npersons in a normal condition, which have only quite lately obtained\nany degree of scientifio recognition. Not, of course, that the two sorts\nof phenomena are by any means identical; but it may be hoped that the\ntwo inquiries will throw light on one another; and at any rate the d prim\nobJection of impossibility to which the facts are exposed is the same in\neither case, and is satisfactorily disposed of by proof of the reality of\neither. We may \u00b7observe that it is to experiments in rapport that the\nhypothesis of collusion seems specially appropriate; and it must be met\nby an accumulation of experiments with different\" subjects.\" But\nfortunately the hypothesis has not,in the departments of Hypnotism and\nMesmerism, the same plausibility as it had in relation to some\nof our experiments on Thought-transference, the \" su~jects\" of\nwhich were in a normal state. For the peculiar condition of the mes-\nmerised or hypnotised\" subject\" is one which, after a little experience.\nit is not ('Iasy to mistake; and the irrepressible honesty and directness\nof conduct which characterise it have been generally recognised by those\nwho deny no less than by those who maintain the reality of the\ne, mesmeric\" agency.\"\n'\" For a case in which the hypothesis of a code was absolutely excluded by the\nfact that theinvestigator was himself the mesmeriser, see Professor Barrett\u00b71! paper\nrea.d before the British Association at Gla.sgow in 1876, and partly reprinted in\nthe last nnmber of our II Proceedings:'\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883:] .Second Report oj tke Oommittee Ol~ Mesme1'ism. 255.\nA series of experiments, illustrating one form of rapport-the com-\nmunityof sensatlon,-was included in our last Report. We are pur-\nsuing this branch of inquiry, but will defer a further account\u00b7 until a,\nconsiderable number of cases have been collected and compared.\nA much more.distinctive sort of mesmeric sympathy may be found\nin the extraordinarily exalted susceptibility of the\" subject \" to sensory\nimpressions received from the operator. As long as this merely takes\nthe form of exalted sensibility to the operator's voice, combined as 0.\nrule with deafness to other voices, it no doubt may be and frequently\nhas been explained in the old way, as due to the dominance of a single\nidea.--the possession of the\" subject's\" mind by the idea of his operator's\ncontrol making him abnormally wakeful and responsive to any sensible\nsigns that can be recognised as issuing from him, and correspondingly\n---inattentive to all others. Even so, the experiment may be so arranged\nas to bring out very clearly the abnormal physical state on which it was\nBraid's great merit to insist; for if the operator's voice and words.\nbe distinguished among a perfect Babel of other voices, the sensorium\nof the percipient must be at any rate in a most remarkable state\"\nanalogous, e.g., to that of a person who should distinguish the flame of a\ncandle held against the sun. But it seems impossible to carryon the\n\"hypnotic\" explanation in any W9.y to cases where the sensory impres-\nsion is not a spoken sentence,but the faintest whisper of a monosyllable..\nThe individuality of voices (at any rate where there is no excep\u00b7\ntional peculiarity in the pronunciation of consonants, such as a\nlisp) depends entirely on timbre and inflexion, which are produced\nby the vocal chords and by changes in the shape of the pharynx,\nand which have no place at all in a low whisper. It is easy for\nanyone to assure himself of this by shutting his eyes and getting a.\ndozen of his acquaintances in turn faintly to whisper such a mono-\nsyllable as \" Fred \" in his hearing; he will find himself totally unable to\nidentify the author of the sound. How far the case is otherwise with a\n- mesmerised\"subjeot\" may be seen from the following experiments. Our\nformer\" subject,\" Fred Wells, being placed in a corner, with his back\nto the room, Mr. Smith and two of our own number kept whispering.\nhis name, \"Fred,\" as softly as possible and at uncertain intervals; he in\nevery case responded to Mr. Smith, anI} in no case to either of the others.\nAgain, Mr. Smith took his place in a corner of the room, side by side\nwith one of the observers ; Wells, again in a tolerably deep state of\ntrance,was seated in the opposite corner, in such a position that he could\nnot have seen Mr. Smith even had his eyes been open and in their normal\nstate; and one of the present reporters kept up a perpetual loud howling\u00b7\nand clapping at the distance of an inch or two from his ear. Mr. Smith\nthen at quite uncertain intervals, whispered the one syllable\" Fred,\" so\nfaintly as to be inaudible to the gentleman who was sitting in contact\nDigitized by Google\n\f256 Second Report oj illC Oommittee on Mesmerism. [July 18,\nwith him, and who saw his lips move. Wells responded at once to every\n,such whisper. This experiment was successfully repaated ten times. Mr.\nSmith, with his companion, then went into the adjoining dark room,\nwhere thick curtains separated him from the \"subject,\" and again ten\nimmediate responses were given to the whispered wol\"!i, which at tha.t\n\u00b7distance would have been inaudible to an ordinary ear even if listened\nfor in perfect silence, instead of amid unearthly bellowing. On being\n\u00b7asked afterwards whether he had heard the bellower's voice, Wells\nreplied that he had only heard Mr. Smith; but when the latter prepared\nhim for being spoken to by the gentleman to whose loudest vocal efforts\nhe had thus been impervious, and when that gentleman then addressed\nhim in the gentlest tone, .he a.t once complained loudly of the excessive\nnoise.\nA stranger phenomenon still, and one which takes us altogether out_\nof the region of exalted sensibility, is the effect produced on the power\nof response by the unexpressed will of the operator. Our experiments\non this head have been made on our friend, Mr. Sidney Beard. A list\nof twelve Yeses and Noes in arbitrary order was written by one of our-\n.selves and put into Mr. Smith's hand, with directions that he should\nsuccessively \"will\" the \"subject\" to respond or not to respond, in\naccordance with the order of the list. Mr. Beard having been previously\nput into the deep trance, and lying with closed eyes, a tuning fork was\nstruck and held at his ear, with the question, \"Do you hear 1\" which in\nthis case was asked by one of ourselves, as the ordinary insensibility\nto other voices than those of the operator had not supervened. This\nwas done twelve times with a completely successful result, the answer\n\u00b7or the failure to answer corresponding in each case with the \"yes\" or\n\"no\" of the written list-that is to say, wi!ih the silently concentrated\n.will of the mesmerist.*\nThese cases,it will be observed, however conclusive they may appear\n* Similar trials on other occasions were equally successful; as also were trials\nwhere the tuning.fork was dispensed with, and the only sound was the question,\n.\" Do you hear 1.. asked by one of the observers. On these latter occasions, how-\never, Mr. Smith was holding Mr. Beard's hand; and extreme adherents of the theory\nof \"muscle-reading\" might maintain that\" yes\" and \"no\" indications were\ngiven by unconscious variations of pressure. How completely unconscious the\nsupposed \"reader\" was of any such sensible guidance will be evident from Mr.\nBeard's own account. .. During the experiments of January 1, when Mr. Smith\nmesmerised me, I did not entirely lose consciousness at any time, but only ex\u00b7\nperienced a sensation of total numbness in my limbs. When the trial as to\nwhether I could hear sounds was made, I heard the Bounds distinctly each time,\nbut in a large number of instances I felt totally unable to acknowledge that I\nheard them. I seemed to know each time whether Mr. Smith wished me to flAy\nthat I heard them; and as I had surrendered my will to his at the commencement\n-of the experiment, I was unable to reassert my power of volition whiljlt under his\ninD.uence.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\f\" \\\n1883.] .

Even so the heart of the mystery, the mental rapport, the\n~...problem\u00b7why the one influential person should always be the operator,\nremains wholly unravelled; since no amount of supposed hypnotic su];)..\nmission to the operator's will could afford a solution to cases (like thost)\njust described) where there was nothing to suggest to the \"subject\"\nwhat that will at that particular moment was. But further experiment&.\nmake it almost impossible to doubt the reality of some sort of special\nforce or virtue, passing from one organism to the other, in the process\nof mesmerisation ; and however vague at present may be our conceptions.\nof the nature of this p\"'!lsical rapport, there is at any rate a satis-\nfaction in being able to point to it as the basis or condition of the\n1nental.\nWe find what seems at any rate a probable indication of such physical\neflluence in cases where the \"subject\" is allowed to remain in a perfectly\nnormal condition, with the exception of local effects produced on him\nwithout contact, and without any possibility that the idea or expectation\nof them shall dominate his mind. Such an experiment is the following\nwhich in the first instance was suddenly improvised, and which we have\nrepeated between thirty and forty times without a single failure. The\n- \"subject\" was blindfolded and seated at a table, on which his ten 'fingers\nwere spread out beforehim. A screen, formed of thickbrown paper quad-\nruply folded, was then placed in front of his body in such a way that\nit rested on his fore-arms and against his breast and head, extending far\nbeyond him in all directions. On some occasions holes were n:.ade in the\npaper for his arm to pass through, so that the screen became a gigantio\nbreastplate reaching high above his head. No one probably will deny\nthe possibility of so arranging this simple apparatus as to make sure\nthat the boy's fingers should be completely concealed from his sight, even\napart from the blindfolding; and no one who witnessed the experiments\nfound it possible to, entertain the slightest doubt on this score. Two\nout of the ten fingers were then selected by one of the present reporters\nand silently pointed out to :Mr. G. A. Smith, who then, standing beyond\nDigitized by Google\n\f.258 Second Report of tlte Oommittee on Me8merigm. [July 18,\nthe screen at a distance of some feet from the subject, proceeded to make\nextremely gentle passes over them. Oare was taken to preserve such a.\n'\u00b7distance between the tips of Mr. Smith's fingers and those which he was\noperating on as to preclude all chance of 'contact, or even of the produc-\ntion of a sensible current of air. The experimenters themselves were\ntotally unable to detect any such current when similar slowpasses were\nmade over their own fingers, though their hands were decidedly less\nthick-skinned and more sensitive in the ordinary sense than those of the\n\" subject;\" but, to make assurance doubly sure, one of them as a rule\nkept making passes over two of the eight non-selected fingers, imitating\nMr. Smith's pace and mode of action as completely as possible. It was\n-even found possible to dispense altogether with movement, the mesmerist\nsimply holding his fingers in a downward direction over those of the\n\" subject;\" but the results were obtained more quickly when passes--\nwere made. It is needless to say that Mr. Smith (whose genuinely\nscientific curiosity on the subject has led him throughout to welcome\nthe most stringent tests and conditions) was under the closest observa-\notion during the whole experiment. ,After the passes had been continued\nfor a minute or less, the two fingers proved to be perfectly stiff and in-\nsensible..The points 'of a sharp carving fork ~9ntly applied to one of\nthe other fingers evoked the sort of start and protest that might have\nbeen expected; the same points might be plunged deep into the\nchosen two without producing a sign or a murmur. The insensibility\nbeing once proved, the stabs were on several occasions made with a vio-\nlence which it required some nerve to apply, and which would have\nseemed barbarous 00 an ignorant bystander unless he had chanced to\nnote at thesame instant the smiling silence or easy chatter of the victim\nand on all occasions what was done was sufficient to produce in a normal\nfinger, however pachydermatous, a most acute pang. The experiment\nwas equally successful when varied by applying a lighted match to the\nmore sensitive region surrounding the nail; but it was not thought well\nto repeat it often in this form, as we were unwilling to cause the\" sub-\nject,\" even with his own consent, any sensible amount of subsequent\ninconvenience. It may possibly be suggested* that some organisations\n'\" The only other objection that occurs to us is that it is possible here to suppose\na. case of direct inhibition-that, though the currents of air or changes of temper-\nature produced bY'movements of the operator's hand were imperceptible to the\n\" subject,\" they yet sufficed to setup a weak monotonousstimulation, whereby the\npower of response in the particular sensory centre was gradually annulled, But\n(1) other operators ought then to succeed; (2) the explanation does not extend to\nthe cases where the operator's hand did not move; (3) the explanation is itself\nmost violent, and contrary to all analogy. Heidenhain himself never suggests\nthat the weak and monotonous stimulation which induces the hypnotic state can\n\u00b7be so weak as not to reach the threshold of consciousness; and it seems incredible\nthat suchsub-liminalstimnlation should suffice to bring a.bout the localanresthesia\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.J Second Report oj tlte Oommittee on 1J[esme,\u00b7iS1n. 259\nare extremely impervious to pain; and that the youth, lJeing warned\nof what was coming.by the slight preliminary pricks 011 some of the\nfingers which retained their sensibility, was enabled to set his teeth,\nand to carry out the wholly inscrutable and useless project of enduring\nthe agony when it came without complaint. Anticipating this\nobjection, on a. good many occasions after we had convinced ourselves\nof the genuineness of the phenomenon, the wielder of the fork or the\nmatch took care to begin with one (if the mesmerised fingers. The\nassault then came, it' will be observed, at a moment which it was\nimpossible for the \"subject\" to foresee; and we know of no warrant\nfor the assumption that an ordinary youth, who is sitting with relaxed\nlimbs in quiet unconcern, would be able to control every sort of refl.ex\nstart or twitch when a naked flame is suddenly: applied to one of the\n___most sensitive parts of his person. It is wise, however, to guard\nagainst even unwarranted assumptions; and we have accordingly\nrepeated the experiment with other\"subjects \"-one of them a delicate\nwoman, whose shrinking from pain was such that the merest touch of\nthe point of the fork on one of her un-mesmerised fingers would cause\na half-hysterical cry. The trials with her were fully as successful as\nthose with the robu~ter organisms; but were sooner discontinued, owing\nto the difficulty, in the case of very thin-skinned and delicate hands,\nof taking such measures as under ordinary conditions would cause\nsevere pain without running the risk of subsequent annoyance or\ndisfigurement.\nThe rigidity of the mesmerised fingers could be tested with, if\n:possible, even more certainty than their insensibility, by simply telling\nthe \" subject,\" after a minute of mesmerisation, to close his or her fist;\nthe selpcted digits in every case refused to bend with the others, and\n-thus for the first time revealed to their possessor what particular pair\nit was that had been operated on. And opportunities sometimes\npresented themselves for testing this rigidity and want of motive\npower in an impromptu way. Thus it happened one night that the\nY011th whose fingers were the subject of the experiments just described\nwas lying in a very deep mesmeric sleep, with his head buried in a\ncushion and one hand extended andgrasping the back of the sofa frame.\nOne of the present reporters silently threw a screen over his head and\nbody, leaving only his one hand exposed, and then beckoned to the\nmesmerist to approach and make a few noiseless passes over the hand.\nwhich (when produced, as above described, withoutsuggestion) is a far rarer phe-\nnomenon than the general hypnotic state. Lneal and pal\u00b7tial inhibition of par-\nticular sensory centres, brought about by t\/.1\/felt stimuli, while general volition\nand consciousness remain quite unimpaired, would at any rate, bear no relation\nwhatever to the inhibition (as Heidenhain conceives it) of the fl:ltole aI'ea of voU-\ntion and consciousness by a monotony of felt stimuli.\nDigitized by Google\n\f260 Second Report of the Oommittee Oli Me8merism. [July 18\nThe screen was then removed, and the boy wakened by the usual clap\nand call. On endeavouring, however,to rise and leave the sofa, he found\nhis hands tightly glued to the framp, nor did all his efforts avail to-\nwithdraw it until some reverse passes had restored it to animation.*\nWe have advisedly described the results described in the last two\nparagraphs as only a probable indication of a specific efHuence. For we\ncannot pronounce it impossible that they may merely represent a special\nform of TI\/'(Jl\u00a3gl~t-tranif6'l'encJ. If we admit that the operator's know-\nledge as to what particular finger he is operating on is an idea\ncommunicable by Thought-transference, and that such knowledge, when\nimparted to a \"subject,\" might lead to paralysis of sensation in the\nfinger to which his att13ntion was thus directed, then it is not incon-\nceivable that the same train of events might happen with the omissw\",\nof the psychical element of the \"subject's\" knowledge. In other.._\nwords, it is conceivable that some process of nervous induction, not\nfrom finger to finger but from brain to brain, might produce the\ninsensibility, without excitation in the \"subject's\" brain of that\nparticular activity which would correspond with a conscious idea of\n.the particular finger. This hypothesis requires at any rate to be\ncarefully tested.\n,The reality of the physical efHuence is ~uch more strongly\nsuggested by the fact that, though emitted only from living bodies, it\ncan be made to produce effectswhich inhere for some minutes in inorganic\nones. An object which has been handled, or over which passes have\nbeen made, by a mesmerist, will be recognised and picked out of a num-\nber of similar objects by a peraon who is sensitive to that mesmerist's\ninfluence. This phenomenon is no doubt rare, but fortunately it is one\nwhich it is particularly easy to test. In the following case, for example,\nthe \"subject\"-a gentl~man with whom we have frequently experi-\n\u2022 In oonnection with this experiment, we may quote the following passage\nfrom Professor Mayo's TNJ,tks contained in Po'[1'Ular Bupe7\u00b7ltitio1ll, 3rd edition,\np: 155 :-\"A servant of mine, aged about twenty-five, was mesmerised by Lafon-\ntaine for a full half-hour, and, no effect appearing to be produced, I told him he\nmight rise from the ohair and leave us. On getting up ,he looked uneasy, and\nsaid his arms were numb. They were perfectly paralysed from the elbows down-\nwards, and numb to the shoulders. This was the more satisfaotory, thatneithp,r\nthe man himself, nor Lafontaine, nor the four or five speotators expected this\nresult. The operator triumphantly drew a pin and stuok it into the man's hand,\nwhioh bled but had no feeling. Then, heedlessly, to shew it gave pain, Lafontaine\nstuok the pin into the man's thigh, whose flashing eye and half-suppressed growl\ndenoted that the aggression would certainly have been returned by another, had\nthe arm whioh should have done it not been really powerless. However, M. La-\nfontaine made peace with the man by restoring him the use and feeling of his\narms. This was done by dusting them, as it were, by quiok transverse motions of\nhis extended hands. In five minutes nothing remained of the palsy but 0. slight.\nstiffness, whioh gradually wore off in the oourse of the evening.\"\n.\nDigitized by GoogIe i\n\f.1883.] Second Report of tlte Oommittee O\/j JJ1esmm\u00b7ism. 261\nmented, and whose anxiety for complete tests has always been fully\nequal to our own-was engaged in conversation by one of our committee\nin a room on another floor during the time that the process of mesmer-\nising the chosen object was going on. That process consisted merely of\npasses and occasional light touches, and was most carefully scrutinised '\nthroughout. When it was concluded, the mesmerist was taken into a\nthird room by another member of the committee, and] the \"subject\"\nwas then introduced into the room where the mesmerised object lay\nII.mong a number of others. This object had of course been selected by\none of ourselves, and its position in relation to the others was generally\nchanged after the mesmerist had left the room and before the subject\nentered it; but this was a superfluity of precaution, as the two were\nnever for an instant within sight or hearing of one another. In the\nfirst experiment a cardboard box, in the second a pocket-book, selected\n--from a small group of ten small objects (including, e.g., a lump of wax, a\npen-wiper, a paper-knife, &c.), was mesmerised and was successfully\npicked out by the\" subject\" after he had held each of the objects for a\nmoment in his hand. We have found it best to avoid using coins and\nmetallic substances, as our results with them, though sometimes start-\nlingly successful, have been uncertain; and also they are so easilywarmed\neven by very slight contact with the hand, that it is necessary in their\ncase to take special measures for insuring equality of temperature between\nthe o~ject operated on and the others. After the second trial we elimi-\nnated the uncertainty as to results which might arise from the use of a\nvariety of substances, and employed ten small volumes, resembling each\nother as closely as any two peas. Anyone of thesethat we selected having\nbeen operatedon,the \"subject\" identified the particular volume'four times\ni.n succession the instant that he touched it, and ~aain on a fifth occasion\nafter taking up each of the ten in turn. The sense of 81nell was in no\ncase resorted to; and to avoid all chance of Thought-transference\noOr of unconscious indications, we were careful that the particular\n. member or members of the committee who had selected the volume,\n3nd knew which of the ten it was, should avoid watching this\npart of the proceedings. In the last tri8.l (as well as in other\nsuccessful experiments of the same kind) no contact whatever\nhad taken place between the hands of the mesmerist and the book.\nThat the very slight contact which was permitted ill the precediilg\ntrials could produce such a change of temperature in a cardboard box or\nthe binding of a book as would be sensible to humanhands aminute after-\nwards, seems a violent assumption; but we took the precaution, during\nthe mesmerising process, of ourselves giving a similar amount of hand-\nling to some of the nine objects which were not being operated on. The\nchances against succeeding by accident in seven consecutive trials of this\nkind are ten millions to one; and the experiment may therefore, we\nT\nDigitized by Google\n\f262 Second.Report 0\/ tlte Oommittee on Mesmeri8m. [July 18.\nthink, be considered a tolerably crucial one. The\" subject\" described\nhis sensation on taking up the right object as \" a kind of mild tingling.\"\nThis result may be compared with Esdaile's most striking account of\nthe effect of \"mesmerised water\" on his Hindoo patients. Our own\nexperiments on the power of a sensitive \"subject\" to detect water over\nwhich mesmeric passes had been made, have been successful to the\nextent of giving results ~nst which, on the hypothesis of accidental\noccurrence, the chances were hundreds to one: but in these matters it\nis perhaps a justifiable demand that the adverse chances shall be\nreckoned by millions.\nWe have been here concerned with the reality of an influence other\nthan thoSe which any form of l~'!Ipnotic theory has recognised; and\nhave defined the particular sorts of experiment in which such an\ninfluence may be most clearly traced. But though the experiments\u00b7 .\nabove recorded were made under accurate scientific conditions,\u00b7 and\ntheir results therefore seem to us to constitute a strong prinJd facie\ncase, we are fully a.ware that their number must be very largely\nincreased before we can hope for any wide scientific acceptance of a\ntheory of mesmeric influence; and the chief object which we have had\nin view in the present Report is to indicate lines of inquiry, and to\nemphasise the importance of vigorously following them up. For this\npurpose\u00b7 what has been said will, we hope, prove sufficient.

It appeared, however, on\ninquiry afterwards, that all surmised what was coming, and thought of the full\nscene. There were two trials.

Professor Barrett, the ReT.\nE. H. Sugden (Bradford), Hr. Guthrie, and Mr. Birchall were present. The\nexperiments were nearly all failures; but after the \"subjects\" (Miss R. and\nMiss E.) had become familiarised with the presence of the strangers by some\npin\u00b7finding experiments of Mr. Sugden's, their capacity improved.

In another experiment, it was agreed to think of a scene, and Mias R. was\n\"'requested to leave the room. In her absence, it was decided to think of Cinderella.\nthe Prince kneeling before hEIr, trying on the glass slipper. On Miss R.'s return,\nshe was blindfolded and isolated. Presently sheappeared to be very muchamused\nat something, and laughed, but oould not be induced to tell what she saw. After\nprotracted waiting, she would not say anything, and other experiments were pro-\nceeded ,with. Afterwards, the experiment was renewed, M,r. B. kneeling down\nbefore one of the ladies, to represent the scene. Miss R. again displayed much\namusement, and finally asked, \"Is it Cinderella 1\" She was then asked what she\nhad seen, and replied, .. I saw a little girl in rag\" sweepingup the hearth, and the\nfairy godmother looking in at the door.\" Asked if this was what she saw before,\nsaid, ., Yes, but I did not know who it was.\" Asked why she did not tell us what\nshe saw, she said, \" I could not suppose you would think of any picturelikethat.'\u00b7\nWhen told of the actual picture thought of, she said she had no idea of it. The\npicture she had described was very distinct ;-she saw the little girl sweeping up\nthe hearth, and the old woman looking in at the door, but she did not know who\nthey were.\nAs it was not convenient to carry on the experiments during the summer, no\nmore sittings were held till the end of A11lJt1Bt. The young ladieII reported that\nthey did not try any further experiments among themselves. The first meeting\nin the autumn was held as follows :-\nAugust 80, 1888.\nP\"CIBflt: Mr. Guthrie, Miss B-d, Miss J., Miss Ro, and Hiss E.\nThere was not the usual amount of interest taken by any of the persons\npresent, and the experiments were nearly all failures. Some experiments on the\n\" transmission of tastes \" were, however, successful.\nOne incidentisspecially noteworthy. An outline in white paper of a teapot\nwas shewn on a black ground. Miss R. sa'd, \"I see a white ground with\naomething dark and long and indistinct in the middle of it. Oh I there is a line\nof yellow all round it. Itis aquare, longer one way than the other,\" and (then ina\npuzzledmanner) \" It can't be a window.\" Halfway through the description Mr.\nG. noticed thatshe wasd~oribing a gold-framed and glazed fashion plate, a little\ndistance above the object, and he removed the object.\n&Jlt~mb~r 26, 1888.\np,.elent: Mr. Guthrie, Miss B-d, Miss C., Miss B., and Miss E.\nA number of experiments were tried. There were more suoee88eB than on the\n30th August, butstill a great many failures. First thfl distinguishing of shades\nof colours was tried. Some of them were described with grsat aoouracy, but as\nthey were allselected on acoount of their peculiar shlldes, in order to test aoeuraoy\nof colour perception beyond the mere naming of the vivid primary colcurs, the\nDigitized by Google\n\f276 Experiments in T1tougM-Tl'al\/,~.fereilce.\ndescriptions might ot might not be considered accurate. Further, the colours\nhaving been selected by daylight, did not look the same by gaslight, and the\ndescriptions given under such circumstances were not applicable w~ seen by\ndaylight. It was also thought that the colours of other objects in the room might\nmingle with the colour thought of, in the way of colour composition, and that\nthe various \"willers\" might thus see the colours differently. These experiments\nwere abandoned. after takiug up a good deal of time.\nMr. Guthrie then tried the reception ot pains, but failed. In contact with\nMiss R. (blindfolded) he tried to convey to her by concentration of thought and\nsilent movement of the lips the name\" Peter\" but failed. In the same contact\nMr. G. then directed Miss R. to do as he did, and moving his right (and disen-\ngaged) arm, Mi8B R. made a fair imitation ofthe movement.\nIn the same experiment without contaCt, Mr. G. standing behind MiBB R.,\nmoved his closed fists round each other. Mi8B R. did the same in a faint, un-\ndecided manner.\nA taste experiment was next tried. In one room Mi8B C. reported that Miss\nR., in contact with MiBB R-d, who had carraway seeds in her mouth, said, \"I\ntaste biscaits-something in biscuits-it tastes of carraway seeds.\"\nSimilarly, Mr. G. being in contact with Miss E. in another room, the latter\nsaid, \" I taste something sour.

[July 18t\nIII;\nAPPENDIX TO THE REPORT ON MESMERISM.\nIn the Report printed abovet we were mainly occupied with one\nfundamental question-the question of the reality of the mesmeric force;\nin other wordst of the reality of the specific facts of Mesmerismtwhether\nmingled with, or standing beyond and distinct from, those of Hypnotism.\nAs time goes on we shall hope to deal with some further departments of\nthe subject, including the vexed questions (often called, par excellence,\nthe higher phenomena) of clairvoyn.ncet phreno-mesmerismt mesmeric\nhealing, and mesmeric effects produced without either fixation, manipula.\"\" ,\ntion, or expectancy. But one fact remains which concerns the lower\nphenomena as much as'the higher, and which is of such fundamental\nimportaIlCo in the studYt whether of Hypnotisin or of Mesmerism, that\nthe statement of it (though involving references to future topics) will\nfind its most fitting place here. It is a fact on which Dr. Elliotson,\none of the acutest minds that ever applied itself to these subjects,\nfrequently insisted, but which both mesmerists and anti-mesmerists,\nthough for different reasons, have often been tempted to ignore.\nBriefly it is this: that (with certain exceptions to be hereafter\nexplained) the more startling effects of Hypnotism and Mesmerism may\nbe matched with occurrences, either closely parallel or absolutely\nidentical, which have occurred spontaneously; while at the same time,\n. the rarity and the pathological character of their spontaneous\noccurrence are entirely in a.ccordance with that theory of ezceptional\nnervous affection which has throughout recommended itself to us.\nThe fanatical mesmerist is apt to keep this spontaneous occurrence in\nthe background, as tending to impugn the unique character of the\ninfluence which he is celebrating. The anti--nesmerist begins by\nrelegating these mysterious phenomena to the scanty chapters on\n\" Somnambulism\" which form one of the weakest points in the\nmedical conspectus of man; and then, when he is confronted with\nthese same phenomena as produced by Mesmerism, he exclaims thatthey\nare incredible, and dismisses them as inconsistent with established\nphysiological laws. Now it is perfectly true that some of these\nphenomena do sound incredible ; that they cannot possibly be fitted\ninto our present conceptions of the way in which the nervous systenl\nacts. But it is not Mesmerism which is responsible for them, but\nNature; that is to say, Mesmerism offers a special way of producing\nphenomena which have been spontaneously produced in ways wholly\nDigitized by Google\n\f-..\n1883.J .AjJjJendi.c to tlte Report on lJIestnel\u00b7is1n\u2022. 285\nunknown to us for centuries before Mesmer was born. To prove this\nin detail .(0. task which we hope hereafter t() attempt) would carry us\nfar beyond our present limits.\u00b7 We must content ourselves here with\nreferring the reader to the list of authorities given below, a list\nwhich, though by no means exhaustive, contains, we think, full justifica-\ntion of all that we shall at present advance.*\nWhat, then, are the main modifications of ordinary waking con-\nsciousness, which spontaneous sleep-wakers (to use a term of convenient\nvagueness) have been observed to present 1 The rough analysis, which\nis all that we shall here attempt, shews us that these modifications\nextend irregularly over one or more of five regions.\nConfining oursel~'es to broad distinctions of external manifestation,\nwe find obvious changes occurring in (1) sensibility to pain; (2) sensory\nand supersensuous perception; (3) the current of consciousness;\n(4) memory; and (5) emotional disposition or character. In each of\nthese particulars we are familiar with certain changes induced by\nstates of nutrition, by expectant attention, by narcotics, by disease.\nBut in each case the spontaneous sleep-waking state will be found to\ncarry us on by an unbroken series from changes which are familiar and\nin a certain sense explicable, to changes which altogether transcend the\nbounds of our systematised knowledge.\nThus, as regards sensibility to pain, we have first the ordinary\nsomnambulist, who shews much the same bluntness of sensibility as\nn man shews when deeply absorbed in reverie, but who may nevertheless\nbe awakened by a sharp blow or the touch of a hot object. Then\nwo come to cases such as that of Professor Haycock, who \"would preach\nin his sleep so steadfastly that no pinching would wake him;\" t and\nthen to such cases as that of Mrs. Griffiths, a patient of Dr. Lingen's t\nwho was repeatedly laid up with severe scalds, caused by her unfortunate\nhabit of cooking her husband's dinner in the somnambulic state and\n'\" Sec the collections of somnambulic and other cases contained in the follow-\ning works :-Dr. Abercrombie on the lntelll,ctuaZ Powers; Dr. Azam in Rente\nSeientijiq'w for 1876, 1877, and 1879; Dr. Belden's ACCO'Ilnt of Jane Ridel'; Dr.\nErasmus Darwin's Zoo1t01IIia ;~Dr. Dyce in ErZinhll1'uk PMloaopllicaZ PranaactillnB,\n1822 j Dr. Dufay in RCfJ'UO &iL'nUjiqu.f!, 1876; Dr. Elliotson in his Phy,ioZoUY\nand the Z\"iBt, vol. iv.; Dr. Macnish's PlliZ0811J'ky {II Steip; Dr. Mayo's Trtltlill\ncontaiMd in Popula,' Supe1'atitiona; M.

[July 18,\nthen throwing the boiling water over her legs, without any perception\nof having done so till she spontaneously \"came to herself.\" In' this\ncase, and in others like it, there was no indication whatever of nervous\nlesion in the ordinary st!l.te, nothing to account for this idiopathic and\nfitful insensibility to the severest pain.\nAgain, in the matter of the acuteness of sense-perception, we are\nfamiliar with marked exaltations of sensibility in fever, or under the\ninfluence of certain drugs. It does not surprise us to find that the\nsense of muscular balance in the somnambulist is often so acute that\nhe can pass without tottering along roofs wholly impassable to his\nwaking feet. It does not surprise us to find that he can at times hear-\nBOunds which are too faint for other ears to catch. But we begin: to 00\nstaggered when 'Ve come to a metastasis of function, when the patient,\ndeaf to all shouting at her ear, hears a whisper at the pit of her\nstomach.\" And as regards vision, the sleep-waker's condition offers 0.. .....\nseries of puzzles. We are of course prepared to believe that the eye\nmay- become sensitive to amounts of light far lower than are normally\nperceptihle. Wc hear, therefore, without incredulity of the sleep-\nwaker who threads her needle under the table, or blows out the candle\nat midnight before she wnshes up the dishes, under the impression that\n~he had just had breakfast, and that it is wasteful to bum lights in\nbroad daylight. But the observers of sleep-waking eases go on to insist\non what seems a quite needless stumbling-block; they tell us that the\neyes of the sleep-wakers are not open but shut, with pupils upturned, or\nthat if the eyes are open, at any rate there is \" no speculation\" in them,\nbut a mere vacant glare. If we reply that this must be a mistake of\nobservation, they go on to oTerwhelm us with casest where the patient\nreads with the palm of her hand, or with the back of her neck, or\ncriticises the moves of chess-players sitting immediately behind her.\nNor is even this all. Professor Mayo became convinced, or, as he\nexpresses it, \"resigned himself to the belief,\" that these spontaneously\narising powers sometimes attain' a degree so extraordinary that we\nprefer to describe it in his own words :-t \"The patient manifestsnew\nperceptive powers.

The mesmerist, when he claims that,\nhe can limit the stream of consciousness, and bestow a temporary\ndominance on some one idea or emotion, only asserts that he can\nproduce a phenomenon,which admittedly occurs already both in\napparent health and in disease. The power of suggestion begins in the\ncondition of ordinary dream before it attains its intenser degree in\nsomnambulism. The sleeping officer follows with growing anxiety the\ndescription of a battle whispered to him by his friends, till at last he\njumps from his bed and runs headlong away.\" The sleeping beauty,\nwhose ingenious lover has obtained permission to breathe his own name\nin her ear, is melted at last into tenderness for him by the strange.\nrecurrent dream. In more, advanced stages the sleep-waker acts out.\n-ms.vision among waking men; he fancies himself employed in some\nhabitual duty, answers only the remarks which bear on this supposed\nemployment, and neglects all external stimuli which he cannot,\nco-ordinate with his dominant train of ideas.\nIt is possible that we may ultimately be able to trace an unbroken\nline of progression from the voluntary and transient hypertrophy of\na mental image which is necessary for the thinker who wishes it to-\nstand forth distinctly in his brain, to the degenerative hypertrophy of\na group of such images which renders them permanently dominant in.\nconsciousness and impossible to dislodge. . And the key to such\ninquiries seems to lie in the 'somnambulic state-midway between\nidiopathic reverie and monomania-and combining an hallucination as\nprofound as the lunatic's with a capacity of recall as sudden as the shock\nwhich arouses a Socrates to the perception that he is not in the ideal\nworld, but before Potidrea. The great drawback is the rarity of these\ncases of instructive trance; and when the mesmerist claims to repro-\nduce them, he is merely offering to reproduce by empirical means an\n__ observed abnormal state, which physiologist and psychologist alike may\nwell desire to be reproduced. It is of course a question of evidence as.\nto whether or not the mesmerist succeeds in this avowedly empiricaL\nreproduction of a most obscure nerve-condition; but there is at any\nrate no reason whatever why his evidence should be slighted, or his,\nattempt dismissed d priori as fantastic and unphysiological.\nThe next point on which, as we urge, the claims of Mesmerism.\nhave already been far exceeded by the unsought phenomena of Naturo\nis that of intermittent memory-of the establishment of a second state\"\nwhich carries on its own memories from one access to another, but\nwhose recollection of the normal state is in varying degrees imperfect,\n\u2022 Abercrombie, p. 277.\nDigitized by Google\n\f288 Appelldiz to the R,ep01\u00b7t on lJ[e8me'l'ism. [July 18,\nand which is itself altogether forgotten so soon as the normal state\nrecurs. The complexity of these intercurrent memories may reach a\npoint which imagination can scarcely realise. Dr. Mayo cites a case of\nquintuple memory, where a normal state was interrupted by four\nseparate morbid states, each with a memory of its own. The phe-\nnomena, whether of amnesia or hypermnesia, which mesmerists allege,\nreach no such marvellous pitch as this; but they offer a means of\n\u00b7direct experimentation such as cannot otherwise be obtained in this\ndirection; and some of the cases adduced-as of the so-called \"mes-\nmeric promise,\" or impression made on the brain in the mesmeric state,\nwhich irresistibly works itself out in the subsequent normal condition\n-present a singular conformity to some of the best physiological\nspeculations on the mechanism of memory.\nThe fifth point which we mentioned as conspicuously subject to,..\nmodification from obscure but spontaneously arising causes, Was'\ncltaracter-the set of emotional and volitional dispositions which make\nup a recognisable personality. Oharacter is of course largely influenced\nby memory: a change in the body of pictures reproducible at will must\nIleeds change the general conception of the universe on which a man's\nmore definite views and preferences are based. And there is a child-\nlike sense of freedom and deliverance in the escape from the tr~\u00ad\nmelling recollection of what one has done in the past, and what other\npeople think about one,which forms a marked feature in many accounts\nof spontaneous double-consciousness as well as of mesmeric trance.\nBut the history of spontaneous double-consciousness includes also cases\nwhere character alters-as though through some altered distribution of\nthe supply of blood to the brain-while in the altered state the\nmemories of the normal state are preserved, Such cases are of much\nimportance with reference to certain allegations of permanent change\nin emotional disposition effected by Mesmerism; and it may not be out\nof place to refer here to Dr. Azam's case of Felida X. (the earlier\nstages of which have been already summarised in lJ[ind)-a story which I\nbrings home to us the relativity of human judgments, the pathetic\nlimitations of man's outlook on the world, more forcibly than any\nromance :-\nFeIida X., an hysterical young woman living in the South of France, be-\ncame subject in 1856 to accesses of what wa3 at first considered as somnambu-\nlism-Rtates lasting a few minutes or hours, of which she retained no\nconsciousness on regaining her normal condition. Gradually the duration of\nthese accesses increased; theybecame considerable enoughto rank asa \"second\nstate;\" and itwas observed that in this second state Felida perfectly remem-\nbered the first state, though in the first or normal atate she forgot the second.\nThe secondstate graduallygrew upon her till it has become almost continuous,\nher relapses into the first state occupyingperhaps not more than one day per\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.J Appendix to the Report on Me8meris\/n. 289\nmonth. And it is remarkable that her s.econd state is in all respects superior\nto her first. Her health is better i her chamctel' is more chee'li\u00b7tl and even;\nher memory perfect for both states. She is aware of her occasional entry\ninto her first state, but she considers that as abnormal, and though not unduly\ndistressed by it she would fain avoid its occurrence. When in the first state,\non the other hand, her aches and pains return, and her memory for the\nsecond state disappears. She is then truly miserable, even to the verge of\nsuicide, and ht'lplessly bewildered bythe vast gaps in her memory, which arc\nso profound and extensive that if her husband or children happen tG be out\nof the room at the moment when she enters the first state she does not knolV\nwhether they are alive or dead, and waits anxiously to see whether\nthey come in again. She is ashamed of this loss of memory, and uses all her\nart to conceal it. Of late she has hit on a plan which somewhat lessens this\ninconvenience. When she feels that an access of the first state is coming on,\nshe writes a letter to her other self, giviug a precis of the facts which she\nconsiders it desirable that that self should know. Thus, for instance, she\n-details the orders which have to be executed, the measurements of chintz,\n&c.But there are cases where the poor creature is gla:i to forget. For example,\nin the second state she learnt facts giving her grave cause for jealousy as to\nher husband's conduct with a female friend of her own. So much did this\ndistress herthat she attempted suicide. She was rescued before life was extinct;\nand then in her new misery she ardently desired the return of the first state,\nwith all its suicidal gloom-preferring, as one may say, to hang herself in\nforgetfulness of the truth, rather than because she remembered it. She has\nsince then, in fact repeatedly returned to the first state, and knows nothing\ntherein of the trouble which has come 011 her second self. Yet this immunity\nis not without its inconveniences; for while, in the second state, she rejects\nindignantly all acquaintance with the treacherous friend, she knows that\nthere will be,:as it were, intercalary days of amnesty when she will greet her\nagain with cordiality and ease.\nThe brief sketch thus given of some of the abnormal phenomena of\nsensation and consciousness which do unquestionably occur and which\nnnquestionably occurred before Mesmerism was named or thought of,\nmight easily have been indefinitely extended. But enough has been said\n~ ~e think, to shew how unscientific is the objection urged against Mes-\nmerism on account of the incredible character of the phenomena said to\nbe thereby induced. It mayor may not be the case that the mesmeric\nprocess induces these phenomena; but to call such phenomena apriori\nincredible, is to ignore or disregard an immense though scattered mass\nof testimony (of a perfectly unbiased kind) to the existence of precisely\nsimilar and of still stranger phenomena, which have been sporadically\nobserved in all ages and countries in which anything like accurate\nobservation has been possible.\nFor \"OUr own part we feel so strongly the profundity of the mysteries\nwhich the phenomena of somnambulism involve that we cannot recog-\nnise any apriori objection to what may be called the grotesque simpli-\ncity of method with which Mesmerism attacks them.

E. H. SUGDEN, B.Sc., OF BRADFORD.\nAbout six months ago I was led to try a few experiments in so-\nealled Thought-reading, as exhibited by Stuart Cumberland, and I was\nvery soon convinced that all that he had done, and much more, could be,\neffected by careful interpretation of muscular indications. A number\nof public lectures afforded me opportunity for confirming my opinionby\nnumerous experiments performed upon a great number of \"subjects,\"\nusually strangers to myself, but selected by the audience or chairman of\n-- the meeting. A few general results may be worth putting upon record.\n(1) Cltaracter o\/tlM: Experiments.-They included the discovery of\npersons thought of in the audience, and articles worn by them ; the\nfinding of pins and other hidden articles; reading the numbers of bank\nnotes, both by means of tickets with the ten digits printed on them and\nplaced on a table, and by writing the numbers on a blackboard; the\nlocalisation of pains; following a track chalked out on the :floor; and\nQther similar tests. It will be observed that in all these cases the\nthought discovered is a thought involving either motion in a definite\ndirection, or a definite point in space, the position of which has been\nindicated by movements.\n(2) Modus operandi.-The subject was directed to concentrate his\nwhole attention on the person, number, &c., thought of. I (of course\nblindfolded) took his left hand, as being more aQ.tomatic than the right;\nthen if the object was to find some person or thing in the room, I\nwalked somewhat rapidly in front of my patient, following the indica-\ntions he gave, until the person or thing was reached. If the number of\n_ \"a bank note was to be discovered, I moved the patient's hand rapidly\nto and fro over the figured cards on the table until I found where it\nmost contentedly rested, so obtaining the five figures in succession; or\nelse lo.id his right hand upon the back of my own; and following his\nindications wrote the figures successively on a blackboard. In localising\na pain, the patient's hand was rapidly passed over his body until some\npreferential point was discovered. I found further that for the large\nscale experiments it was quii;e enough to have a walking stick between\nmyself and the patient, he holding one end and myself the other;\nindeed, I have succeeded occasionally with only a piece of thin wire as\nthe connective. '\nIn all cases muscular indication was all that I used ; I never had any\nthought borne in upon my mind, or any image produced there; there\nDigitized by Google\n\f292 Note on MU8cle~ReadiJlg.\nwas no genuine Thought-reading. I simply followed muscular signs.\nThese varied very much in clearness and force. Sometimes the subject.\npositively did all the work, leading me to the place, writing the figures,\nand so on while I was passive as possible; in such cases I have often\ngone on to write words or sentences upon the board under their guidance.\nBut such instances were rare; as a rule, I had to make a careful esti-\nmate of the muscular resistance In each direction and follow\nthe line of least resistance until the place was reached or the\nfigure so far shaped as to be recognisable; then the indications usually\nbeca.me very much more positive.\n(3) Failures and thmr Cattses.-I more or less completely failed in\nabout one case in four on an average. Probably the failures would have\nbeen fewer if I had had ladies as my patients; IlS I have always, in\nprivate experiments, found them very good subjects. In every case of\nfailure where inquiry could be made, sufficient renson WIlS discovered:\nThe most usual cause was determination not to allow the thing to be\ndone; ~he patient having an idea that it WIlS a question of his will\nbeing conquered by mine, and so bracing himself up to resist.\nOccasionally persons came forward, determined to thwart me, either\nbecause they thought it was \"all humbug,\" or because they considered\nthe phenomena to be due to spiritualistic agencies. When the subject\nhad a financial interest in the experiment, I found success to be very\ndifficult to obtain. Boys, IlS a rule, I found to be impracticable subjects;\npossibly because they found it impossible to concentrate their thoughts\nintensely, whilst facing a large audience. I soon found out, too, that\npersons with cold, dry hands were never so easy to deal with as those\nwith warm, moist hands. .\n(4) The Experience of tlte Fatients.-It is most important to note,\nthat in almost all cases, the question WIlS aSked, \"Did you give me any\nindication of what you were thinking about 1\" and the answer was\ninvariably \"No, not the lellSt.\" The whole was done without any\nconsciousness, and often in spite of a resolution to be quite passive.\nThis should be remembered, whenever contact has been allowed in\nsupposed genuine experiments in Thought-reading. The assurance of\nthe person who is in contact with the Thought-reader, that he gave him\nno indication, is absolutely worthless. The most respectable and trust-\nworthy persons have, over and over again, IlSsured me that they have\nnever moved their hand, when I have known that they have simply used\nmy hand as a pen, and have written with it, and the chalk it held,\nusing far more effort than they would if the chalk had been in their own\nfingers. It should be further noted that contact with my hand is not\nnecessary. I have succeeded in finding a person thought of in a room,\nwhen the patient's hand was simply laid upon my forehead, or upon my\nshoulders. The result of my experience would lead me to doubt any\nDigitized by Google\n.-\"\"\"\n\fNote on lIltescle-Readulg. 293\ncase of alleged Thought-reading where contact of any kind had been\nallowed.\n(5) One or two observations, bearing on the unconscious action of\nthe mind, may be recorded. I noticed very often that when an article\nhad been hidden in one place, and then transferred -to another, my\npatient almost invariably took me first to the first place,and then after\nashort search there suddenly went off to the right place. The same\nsort of thing has happened in the case of figures. If the figure has\nbeen changed, the one first thought of came out first, only to be declared\nwrong. Once in writing a bar.k note number, I could get nothing but\ntwos; they were declared to be wrong; .. but,\" said the patient, \"there\nwere twos on another part of the note which I particularly noticed.\"\nThis is of interest as bearing on the well-known fact that in so-called\nspiritualistic revelations the things told are things which the questioner\n-.... has possibly even forgotten, but which have once been in his mind.\nI also found that it is difficult for the mind to avoid transferring\nitself from one thing to another like it. In finding pins, &a., I have\noften been led, not to the right place, but to a place similar to it; as\ne.g., the pin has been in one corner of the room, and I have gone to the\nother; or it has been in some one's pocket, and almost every pocket that\nI came near has had to be searched. One case was very singular. The\npin had been hidden in the hAel of a man's h9ot, under the instep. I\nwas at once taken to a man near the platform, and got down to his boot\nheel and to the very spot where the pin really was, but in another man's\nboot. I could get no farther with that\"subject\"; but on taking another\nI at once found the right man, and the pin in his boot-heeL\nI may finally add that I have no special power in this direction. I\nhave rarely found anyone who could not pretty readily succeed in per_\nforming any of these experiments after a very little practice; and even\non the first attempt, if they had confidence.\nw\nDigitized by Google\n\fDigitized by Google\n\f","_id":508}
