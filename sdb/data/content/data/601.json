PIPER'S TRANCE\nPHENOMENA.\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nPREFACE.\nThe main interest of Mrs. Piper's trance phenomena lies\nundoubtedly in the evidence they afford of knowledge acquired\notherwise than through the senses\u2014whether from the living\nor from the dead. This evidence has been set forth and\ndiscussed in numerous papers in the Proceedings, of ivhich\na list is given below. To these papers I must refer those\nwho are interested only in such evidential matter. For in\nthe present paper they will not find what they want. There\nis no attempt in it to give any of the evidence for super-\nnormal powers, with which it is concerned only incidentally.\nIts object is to throw light on the working of the trance\na\n\fii Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nconsciousnesses from a psychological point of view, and, among\nother things, on the question whether the intelligence that spealcs\nor writes in the trance, and is sometimes in telepathic com-\nmunication with other minds (whether of the living or of\nthe dead), is other than a phase, or centre of consciousness,\nof Mrs. Piper herself.\nA LIST OF PAPERS CONCERNING MRS. PIPER\nPREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN THE PROCEEDINGS\nVol. VI. (1890), pp. 136-659. \"A Record of Observations\nof Certain Phenomena of Trance,\" by F. W. H. Myers,\nSir Oliver Lodge, Dr. Walter Leaf and Professor William\nJames.\nThis deals with the sittings in England in 1889-1890.\nVol. VIII. (1892), pp. 1-168. \"A Record of Observations of\nCertain Phenomena of Trance,\" by Dr Richard Hodgson.\nThis deals with sittings in America from 1886 to 1891.\nVol. XIII. (1898), pp. 284-582. \"A Further Record of Ob-\nservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance,\" by Dr.\nR. Hodgson.\nThis deals with sittings in America from 1892 io 1895.\nVol. XIV. (1898), pp. 6-49. \"A Further Record of Ob-\nservations of Certain Phenomena of Trance,\" by Pro-\nfessor Romaine Newbold.\nThis deals with sittings with which Professor Newbold\nwas concerned from 1891 to 1895.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Papers. in\nVol. XVI. (1901), pp. 1-649. \"A Further Record of Ob-\nservations of Certain Trance Phenomena,\" by Professor\nJ. H. Hyslop.\nThis deals with Professor Hyslop's sittings in 1898-1899,\nand contains also accounts of certain experiments by him,\nand discussions. Professor Hyslop has published accounts\nof his later sittings in the Proceedings of the [new] American\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nVol. XXII. (1908), pp. 19-440. \"A Series of Concordant\nAutomatisms,\" by Mr. J. G. Piddington.\nThis deals with concordant automatisms between Mrs.\nPiper and other automatists, and some experiments during\nher visit to England in 1906-7.\nVol. XXIII. (1909), pp. 2-121. \"Report on Mrs. Piper's\nHodgson-Control,\" by Professor William James.\nThis records and discusses the HodgsonP communications\nwhether as control or communicator during the year following\nhis death, namely 1906.\nVol. XXIII. (1909), pp. 127-280. \"Report on some Trance\nCommunications received chiefly through Mrs. Piper,\"\nby Sir Oliver Lodge.\nMost of this paper is concerned with sittings with Mrs.\nPiper arranged for by Sir Oliver Lodge, and at which\nhe was generally present, in England, in 1889, 1890, 1906,\n1907. Two sittings in 1905 in America are included.\nVol. XXIV. (1910), pp. 31-200. \"Further Experiments with\nMrs. Piper in 1908,\" by Mrs. H. Sidgwick, Mrs. A. W.\nVerrall and Mr. J. G.

Verrall.\nThis gives the record of all \" Bennie Junot's \" communica-\ntions from 1899-1905.\na 2\n\fiv Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nAll the above papers are primarily concerned with the\nexhibition in Mrs. Piper's trances of knowledge supernormally\nacquired, though incidentally some other points are discussed.\nThere have also appeared in the Proceedings four papers\ndiscussing the published evidence, viz. :\nVol. XIV. (1898), pp. 50-78. \"Discussion of the Trance\nPhenomena of Mrs. Piper,\" by F. Podmore.\nThis paper takes the view that there is undoubtedly\ntelepathy with the living, but insufficient evidence to prove\nanything further. The Piper phenomena are compared with\nthose of Adele Maginot and others.\nVol. XV. (1900), pp. 16-38. \"Discussion of the Trance\nPhenomena of Mrs. Piper,\" by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nThis papei takes the view that, assuming there is com-\nmunication with the dead through Mrs. Piper, the evidence\npoints to its being telepathic in character.\nVol. XV. (1900), pp. 39-52. \"Discussion of the Trance\nPhenomena of Mrs. Piper,\" by Andrew Lang.\nThis paper is described by its author as \" Reflections on Mrs.\nPiper and Telepathy\/'\nVol. XXVI. (1912), pp. 147-173. \"The Latin Message Experi-\nment,\" by Mrs. Anna Hude (with Note on same by\nMr. J. G.

He also intended to add records of further inci-\ndents strengthening the general evidence. Unfortunately\nthese intentions were never carried out. All that appeared\nof the intended Part II. was a valuable contribution by\nProfessor W. Romaine Newbold,3\ndiscussing sittings with\nwhich he was concerned in 1894-5. Of these sittings\n\u2014\n33 in number\u201415 \" were devoted for the most part to\ngetting evidence to prove the identity of the alleged com-\nmunicators ; the remainder to getting from them their own\ntheory of the phenomena and their description of the con-\nditions under which they were working and of the life they\nlive.\" \" While it is impossible at present,\" Professor New-\nbold continues, \" to accept these statements as true, it is of\nthe greatest importance to put them on record as afford-\ning clues for the guidance of experiments with other\nautomatists.\" The material provided by this latter series\nwas, however, left to Hodgson to deal with in the paper\n*\"A further Record of Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance.\"\nBy Richard Hodgson, LL.D. S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 284-582.\n2\nOp. cit., p. 406.\n3\n\"A further Record of Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance.\"\nPart II., A. By Professor William Romaine Newbold. Proc, Vol. XIV ,\npp. 6-49.\nA\n\f2 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nwhich never saw the light, Professor Newbold concerning\nhimself, in his paper, with the evidence for identity only.\nNor did Hodgson ever reply to an article by myself,1\nin which I discussed his theory of the nature of the\ncommunicating intelligence and its relation to Mrs. Piper ;\nand pointed out what seemed to me good grounds for my\nview. I regret this the more because he is known to have\ndisagreed with me and to have intended to write an\nanswer, and it is only by free discussion that we can hope\nto arrive at sound conclusions.\nHodgson not only did not carry out these various\nintentions, but, so far as I know, he left no notes of what\nhe intended to say in any form available for use by\nothers. It is unfortunate, because his experience of the\ntrance manifestations in Mrs. Piper's case was greater than\nthat of any other student of the subject ;\nand because the\nrecords of his own sittings with her probably include\nexperiments and attempts to elucidate points to which we\nhave not the clue, and the significance of which is therefore\nlost to us. Moreover, even apart from this, we who read\nhis records of sittings have, as it were, only the dry bones,\nand doubtless lose much that made the communications life-\nlike and impressive, and which he might to some extent\nhave made us realise had he himself written about them.\nAs Professor William James says (Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.,\np. 32) :\nOne who takes part in a good sitting has usually a far\nlivelier sense, both of the reality and of the importance of the\ncommunications, than one who merely reads the record. Active\nrelations with a thing are required to bring the reality of it\nhome to us, and in a trance-talk the sitter actively co-\noperates. * * * But a sitting that thus seemed important\nat the time may greatly shrink in value on a cold re-\nreading ; and if read by a non-participant, it may seem\nthin and almost insignificant.\nThis advantage of personal participation in a sitting is,\nhowever, not entirely unmixed, for the dry light of criticism\n1 \" Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper.\" Proc, Vol.\nXV., pp. 16-3S.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 3\nis perhaps more easily brought to bear when uninfluenced\nand unimpeded by dramatic or emotional elements. In\nmuch the same way, when we wish to get at facts it may be\nbetter to read a statement of them to ourselves rather than\nto hear even the same statement eloquently set forth by an\norator with a parti pris. It must be remembered, of course,\nthat a conversation of any vividness, whether carried on\non the medium's side by voice or by writing, is hardly\npossible unless the sitter can act his part and behave as\nthough his interlocutor were what he professes to be, even\nwhen he suspects him of play-acting. Thus Mrs. Piper's\nsitters cannot escape sharing in the performance, whatever\nview they take of its genuineness.\nIt would be interesting to know why Hodgson failed so\ncompletely to carry out his intentions. One reason was\ndoubtless that he was busy. The constant superintendence\nof Mrs. Piper's sittings\u2014in 1896 and 1897 generally six a\nweek, and latterly usually three a week during some three-\nfourths of the year\u2014and the keeping of records of them,\nmust have been a time-consuming and rather fatiguing\nbusiness, and there was as well the business of the American\nBranch of the S.P.R., of which he was secretary. And of\ncourse the material with which he had to deal was con-\nstantly growing on his hands. I think, however, that he\ndid not expect this growth to continue indefinitely. The\nrecords show that the trance personages frequently spoke\nof Mrs. Piper's power coming to an end in a year or two,\nas well as of the probable withdrawal of the Imperator\nBand\n\u2014\ni.e. the particular group of soi-disant communicating\nspirits in whose communications Hodgson was specially\ninterested from 1897 onwards. The records also show\nthat a continued and prosperous life was prophesied for\nHodgson himself. 1\nThe first prophecy might well have\nmade him feel that it would be more profitable to delay\nwriting till he had the whole of the evidence before him ;\nand the second prophecy, if he attached any importance\nto it, would tend to support the impression, natural in a\nhealthy man of his age, that there was no need for haste\n\u2014that he had time before him.\n1\nFor instances of these prophecies see Appendix, pp. 332-333.\n\f4 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nWhatever the cause, however, of Hodgson's not giving us\na further instalment of his study of Mrs. Piper's trance\nphenomena, we can merely note and regret the fact and\nendeavour to make what use we can of his material with-\nout his assistance. Some of this material regarded as\nbearing on the evidence for the identity of the alleged\ncommunicators has already been published. Professor\nHyslop's sittings, on which he reported in Hodgson's life-\ntime in Proceedings, Vol. XVI., and some of those on\nwhich he reported in the Proceedings of the American\nSociety for Psychical Research, Vol. IV., belong to the\nperiod between Hodgson's last report and his death\n;\nand so do the Junot sittings, edited by Miss Verrall and\npublished in Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., pp. 351-664. Hodg-\nson once told me, as I well remember, that he attached\ngreat value to the latter series as evidence of identity,\nespecially as being one which could be published quite\ncomplete. It is also a series in which\u2014owing to the Junot\nfamily living at a great distance from Boston (where most\nof the sittings were held), and to their being unconnected\nwith other sitters\u2014there need be hardly any fear of leakage,\nof information having accidentally reached Mrs. Piper\nthrough other sitters. Unfortunately, though the conviction\nof personal identity produced was strong, the amount of\nactually veridical statement beyond any probability of guess-\nwork is less in amount than one could have wished.\nThere have also been published certain cross-correspondences\nbetween Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Verrall which occurred in 1902\nduring Hodgson's life-time (see Proceedings, Vol. XX.,\npp. 212-218).\nThere is other material in the records, which there is\nlittle doubt added to the evidence for supernormal com-\nmunication ; but some of it is too private to publish, and\nin hardly any of it is it now possible to judge of the value\nof the evidence, because we cannot tell how much Mrs.\nPiper's supraliminal or subliminal self may have known\nnormally. The record of what passed at sittings is not\ncomplete. Hodgson was often asked to leave the room\nduring parts of sittings, and on other occasions he was not\npresent at all. The sitters were sometimes known to Mrs.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 5\nPiper in her normal state, and sometimes known to each\nother, so that there were possibilities of leakage which\ncannot now be estimated. Tor these reasons the records\ncan add little to the evidence for the identity of com-\nmunicators already published. Moreover, they do not\non the whole afford evidence different in kind from that\nwhich we already have. Mr. Gerald Balfour and I, who\nhave between us read through all the available records\nleft by Hodgson, have therefore come to the conclusion\nthat so far as they are concerned it is not worth while to\nattempt to present more evidence, as such, of knowledge\nreaching Mrs. Piper's trance personality in a supernormal\nmanner\u2014and in this conclusion Mr. Piddmgton concurs.\nWe think, however, that some attempt should be made\nby examining all the available records, both published and\nunpublished, to analyse further the phenomena of the\nvarious trance states ; to discover in what respects the\ncommunicating intelligences concerned, and alleging them-\nselves to be independent of one another, are differentiated ;\nwhether their account of themselves is consistent ; and to\nwhat extent, if at all, their claim to be other than a\nphase, or particular centre of consciousness, of Mrs. Piper\nherself is justified. Opinions on these questions have been\nmuch divided. For instance, as Professor William James\nsays {Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 3) :\n\" Dr. Hodgson was\ndisposed to admit the claim to reality of Rector and of\nthe whole Imperator-Band of which he is a member,\nwhile I have rather favoured the idea of their all being\ndream creations of Mrs. Piper, probably having no existence\nexcept when she is in trance, but consolidated by repetition\ninto personalities consistent enough to play their several\nroles.\" My own opinion in 1899 was that, however true it\nmay be that there is really communication between the\nliving and the dead, the intelligence communicating directly\nwith the sitter through Mrs. Piper's organism is Mrs.\nPiper. This opinion was expressed in the article already\nreferred to {Proceedings, Vol. XV., pp. 18, 19), and I may\nas well say at once that it has remained substantially\nunchanged.\nIncidentally, it will be desirable in the course of the\n\f6 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\ndiscussion to bring into more prominence than has yet\nbeen done the weakest side of the Piper trances\u2014cases of\nobviously false personations and false claims, of ignorance\nand misapprehensions shown by the trance personages,\nand so forth. Not that the existence of these things has\nbeen ignored by any of the investigators, or that specimens\nhave not been given ; but in joapers mainly concerned with\nevidence for the exhibition of knowledge not normally within\nMrs. Piper's reach, their importance is naturally subordi-\nnate, and we think that the place which they occupy in the\ntrance communications as a whole and the important bearing\nthey must have on such questions as we are now proposing\nto discuss, has perhaps hardly been appreciated by those\nwho have only had the hitherto published evidence before\nthem. I propose, therefore, besides referring to such cases\nwhere the discussion requires it, to give, among other\nthings, specimens in the Appendices of what may be called\nMrs. Piper's trance communications at their worst.\nMuch of the material on which this paper is based has,\nas I have already said, been studied by Mr. Gerald Balfour\nas well as by myself, and I have had the advantage of\nhis notes on it as well as of his criticism of what I have\nwritten, though the responsibility is entirely my own.\nTo PREVENT MISAPPREHENSION, I AM ANXIOUS TO SAY\nEMPHATICALLY AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF MY DISCUSSION\nTHAT I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT KNOWLEDGE IS\nOFTEN EXHIBITED IN THE COURSE OF MRS. PlPER'S TRANCE\nUTTERANCES WHICH CAN ONLY HAVE REACHED HER BY SOME\nSUPERNORMAL MEANS\u2014BY WHICH I MEAN OTHERWISE THAN\nTHROUGH THE ORDINARY CHANNELS OF SENSE.\nFor evidence of this I must refer my readers to the\npapers already published in the Proceedings about Mrs.\nPiper, 1\nfor I do not propose to go into it in the present\npaper. Nor do I propose to discuss the question whether\nthe evidence, if accepted, does or does not carry us beyond\ntelepathy from the living. I will only say that since I\nwrote my previous paper in 1899 two very important\nthings have happened. First, evidence tending, in my\nopinion, decidedly to support the hypothesis of communica-\n1\nFor a list of these see Preface.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 7\ntion from the dead has been obtained through automatists\nother than Mrs. Piper ; and secondly, the development of\ncross-correspondences has introduced a new line of evidence\nto which Mrs. Piper has contributed her share. The weak-\nness I pointed out in 1899\u2014that we depended for evidence\nof communication from the dead on one medium alone\n\u2014\nhas therefore disappeared. Nevertheless, partly because I\nam not going to deal in this paper, except incidentally,\nwith evidence for telepathy either with the living or the\ndead, partly because I am unable to agree with Hodgson\nas to the extent to which Mrs. Piper's trance utterances are\nindependent of her, and partly because I must dwell on\nabsurd elements hi those utterances, what I have to say\nmay seem to some readers to belittle the value of the\nevidence obtained through her for communication otherwise\nthan through the senses. I am, therefore, the more con-\ncerned to make it clear that hi my opinion Mrs. Piper's\nsupernormal powers are very important. It is indeed\nchiefly because of their importance that I think it worth\nwhile to make a careful study of her trance phenomena.\nBefore going further, I wish to define the way in which\nin what follows I propose to use the two words \"control\"'\nand \"communicator,\" both familiar to the readers of reports\non Mrs. Piper. In previous discussions these words have\nsometimes been used as synonymous, and it will, I think,\nconduce to clearness to assign to each a special meaning.\nBy \" control,\" then, I mean the intelligence which is\nand professes to be hi direct communication with the\nsitter by voice or writing\u2014the intelligence which Hodgson,\nwhen he wants to distinguish, calls the \" direct com-\nmunicator.\" 1\nBy \" communicator \" I mean an intelli-\ngence for which the control professes to act as amanuensis\nor interpreter, or whose remarks the control repeats to the\nsitter.\n1\nFor the benefit of those not familiar with spiritualistic literature I may\nremark that the word \" control \" is in regular use in this sense in mediumistic\nparlance. Nearly all trance mediums, professional or otherwise, have their\n\" controls,*' and speak ''\nunder control,\" and indeed the general dramatic\nframework of Mrs. Piper's sittings is common to most trance mediums.\n\f8 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [PAET\nI am not at present making any assumptions as to whether\ncontrols or communicators are or are not what they pro-\nfess to be, namely, spirits of dead persons ; or whether\nthey are or are not phases of Mrs. Piper's consciousness,\nand if so whether the dissociation between them and the\nnormal consciousness is so complete that they merit the\nname of secondary personalities. In the discussion that\nfollows the aim is to obtain light on these questions.\nBut whatever theory we adopt it will, I think, be con-\nvenient in describing the phenomena to use the words\n\" control \" and \" communicator \" in the senses above\ndefined.\nAll readers of our Proceedings will readily recall as instances\nof \"controls\" in the trance state, Phinuit, \"George Pelham\"\n(whom I shall throughout call G. P.), Rector. In the\nwaking-stage the \" control,\" according to the definition\nabove given, almost invariably purports to be Mrs. Piper\nherself. The friends of sitters generally appear in the role\nof \"communicators.\" But the roles of control and com-\nmunicator are interchangeable : a communicator may\nbecome a control and may oscillate between the two func-\ntions ;\nand, of course, a control can and does communicate\non his own account. Sometimes, as we shall see, it is\ndifficult for the sitter to know whether the communicator is\nsupposed to be communicating through a separate control\nor whether he is the control himself. But on the whole it\nis generally, I think, fairly clear what is happening or\nsupposed to be happening. Doubt, when it occurs, is often\nthe result of a further dramatic complication which we may\ncall \"assisted control,\" when the communicator is repre-\nsented as writing or talking himself, but with Phinuit or\nRector or G. P. supporting him, as it were.\nThe dramatic form above indicated is consistently main-\ntained throughout the trance proper : all the characters\nappearing in the drama being represented, and representing\nthemselves, as permanent independent entities\u2014spirits of the\ndead\u2014quite distinct from Mrs. Piper herself. Mrs. Piper's\nown spirit is represented as temporarily removed and having\nno concern in the business at all. Her body is said to be\nin the meanwhile occupied by the control who works the\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 9\nwriting or speaking mechanism ; and the reason that a con-\ntrol must intervene between communicator and sitter is\nsaid to be that successful working with the medium's organism\nneeds special capacity and practice. Whatever our theory\nof the underlying reality, it would be very inconvenient\nnot to accept this dramatic form and speak of the char-\nacters in the drama as they speak of themselves. When,\ntherefore, in what follows, I refer to the control as he or\nshe as the case may be, or say that Rector is writing, and\nso forth\u2014this mode of describing what occurs must not be\ntaken as implying any theory whatever as to the true\nnature of any of the personages in the drama.\nIt may be convenient to my readers to be reminded briefly\nof the history of Mrs. Piper's trance phenomena. She first\nwent into trance in June, 1884, when consulting a profes-\nsional medium, Mr. Cocke, about her own health (see Pro-\nceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 46-47). Phinuit, who called him-\nself a French physician, was among her earliest controls, but\nat first only for medical diagnosis. She had a number of\nother controls, \" Chlorine,\" Mrs. Siddons, John Sebastian\nBach, Longfellow, Commodore Vanderbilt, and Loretta\nPonchini\u2014the last purporting to be an Italian girl. 1\nAccording to Mrs. Piper's father-in-law, Chlorine was at\nfirst the principal control for outside sitters, and Loretta\nPonchini and Mrs. Siddons for sittings in the Piper family.\nAfter a time Bach, who represented himself as leader of\nthe band, said they were going to concentrate all their\npowers on Phinuit, and he became ultimately the chief\ncontrol. There is a certain interest in comparing this\naccount of the development of the early trance controls\nwith the later development of the control of the Imperator\nBand, which in some ways resembles it. We have, in the\nlatter case, Stainton Moses professing to bring his former\ncontrols\u2014Imperator, Rector, etc. These at first aU take\nturns in controlling, till finally Rector is established as the\nregular control. There is this difference between the two\ncases, however, that Rector always had Imperator in the\n1\nBach and a soi-disctnt French doctor called Finny were controls of Mr.\nCocke.\n\f10 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nbackground keeping a general supervision over things, while\nPhinuit appeared to act on his own responsibility alone.\nProfessor William James first came across Mrs. Piper in\n1885,1\nand introduced her to Hodgson in 1887 when the\nlatter went to America as secretary of the American Society\nfor Psychical Research. From that time she has been in\nalmost constant relation with the Society in America or in\nEngland. The time during which systematic records have\nbeen kept divides itself naturally into four periods. During\nthe first the principal control called himself Phinuit, and the\nsittings were all voice sittings, that is, Phinuit talked to\nthe sitters. This period lasted till 1892. Three reports were\npublished dealing with it : one by Professor William\nJames in 1886 in the Proceedings of the American Society for\nPsychical Research ; one in 1890 in our Proceedings, Vol.\nVI., by an English committee on sittings held in England in\n1889-90, but including a further report by William James ;\nand one by Hodgson published in 1892 in the Proceedings,\nVol. VIII.\nThe second period extends from 1892 to January 1897.\nDuring this period Phinuit still continued to control and\nto communicate by voice, but a leading part was played\nby a new control, \" G. P.\"\u2014a gentleman recently deceased\n\u2014and he and other controls gradually adopted the plan of\ncommunicating in writing, conversations with the sitter\nbeing carried on by the sitter speaking and the control\nwriting. This period, which we may call the G. P. regime,\nwas reported on by Hodgson in 1897 in Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., and Professor Newbold's paper in Proceedings,\nVol. XIV. (see above, p. 1) was also concerned with it.\nThe earlier part of this second period afforded interesting\ninstances of double control\u2014Phinuit talking and G. P.\nor some other control writing on different subjects at the\nsame time. This and the extraordinary vividness and\ntruth to life\u2014to judge from his friends' accounts\u2014of the\n\" G. P.\" control make me think that in 1892 occurred\nprobably the culmination of Mrs. Piper's automatic powers.\nThere are other considerations to which I shall call atten-\ntion later, which seem to point in the same direction ;\nand\n'Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 651.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 11\nI think it is true, whether G. P. was an intelligence\nindependent of Mrs. Piper or not.\nDuring the third period, which extended from the begin-\nning of 1897 till Hodgson's death in December, 1905, the\nprincipal controls were the Imperator Band (professing\nto be the spirits who formerly communicated through Mr.\nStainton Moses), and from March or April, 1897, onwards,\nchiefly Rector. George Eliot and another literary lady,\nK. F., also took prominent parts as controls in 1897, while\nthe transition to Rector's becoming the important control\nwas going on.\nPhinuit made his final appearance on January 26, 1897,\nand G. P. since that time has taken a comparatively sub-\nordinate part. At the beginning of this Imperator regime,\ncommunication by voice, which is stated to be much more\nfatiguing to the medium than communication by writing,\nwas discontinued ; and when a few months later it was\nresumed, it was rarely used except with two or three\nfavoured sitters, most of whom, though not all, had, I think,\nbeen previously hi the habit of sitting with Mrs. Piper. It\nwas perhaps partly in order to reduce communication by\nvoice that Phinuit was got rid of\u2014removed to a higher\nsphere and relieved from his earthbound condition, it was\nexplained. A very pleasing change introduced by the new\ncontrols was a quiet and placid jDrocess of going into trance\ninstead of the convulsive movements, often unpleasant to\nwitness, with which it used generally to be accompanied\npreviously. As stated above, the Hyslop sittings {Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XVI., and some in the Proceedings Am. S.P.R.,\nVol. IV.) and the Junot sittings {Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.)\nbelong to this third period.\nThe immediate difference introduced by Hodgson's death\nin December, 1905, which I have called the beginning of the\nfourth period, was, apart from the loss of his management\nof the sittings, chiefly the appearance of a communicator\nclaiming to be Hodgson. Hodgson has also frequently\nappeared as control, though Rector retained his position as\nchief control. Imperator was in a sense the chief control\nboth in the third and fourth periods, as Rector always\nrepresented himself as acting under Imperator's direction,\n\f12 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PAET\nbut Imperator very seldom himself controlled, i.e. he very\nseldom, after the spring of 1897, professed to write or speak\nhimself. The early appearances of Hodgson, whether as\ncontrol or communicator, were reported on by Professor\nWilliam James in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., and by Pro-\nfessor Hyslop in the Proceedings of the American 8.P.R.,\nVol. IV.\nThere has been considerable variation in the sittings of\nthis period, for the English sittings in 1906-7\u2014which Mr.\nPiddington reported on in our Proceedings, Vols. XXII.\nand XXIII. , and Sir Oliver Lodge in Vol. XXIII.\u2014pre-\nsent a somewhat new type ; and those of Mr. Dorr in\n1908-9\u2014reported on in our Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.\u2014\na\ndifferent type again. It was during this period, in the\nspring of 1909, that Dr. Stanley Hall had a series of six\nsittings on which he and his assistant, Miss Amy Tanner,\nPh.D., reported in a book entitled Studies in Spiritualism,\npublished at New York in 1910, and reviewed in our\nProceedings, Vol. XXV.\nWhen Mrs. Piper came to England for her third visit at\nthe end of 1909, her power of going into trance seemed to\nhave left her. She was not at all in good health, which\nmay have had something to do with it. But whatever the\ncause, repeated attempts to go into trance produced no\nresults till May, 1910, when Miss Margaret Bancroft\u2014an\nAmerican friend of Hodgson's whom Mrs. Piper was well\nacquainted with, and who had been a frequent sitter\n\u2014\nhappened to visit England, and, by encouragement and\nsuggestion apparently, succeeded in getting the trance to\ncome on for a short time, and some fragmentary writing to\nbe produced. Mrs. Piper when normal again was much\ngratified by this result, for she had feared that her power\nhad gone.\nAfter this, sittings of the usual type began to occur\nagain at intervals. There were one in May and two in\nJuly, 1910, under the management of Sir Oliver Lodge, and\na certain number also under his management in the autumn\nand winter of 1910-11.

This was, of course, alarming. By-\ndirection of the controls periods of weeks were left without\nsittings, but apparently with no good effect The Imperator\nBand said at different times that the sittings were bad for\nthe medium and must stop\u2014that they, the Imperator\nBand, must go. They took what purported to be a final\nleave on May 24, 1911\u2014the first sitting since the middle\nof February. Another sitting was held on July 3, at which\nMrs. Isaac Thompson, well known to Mrs. Piper (see Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXIII., pp. 162-196), and who had been\nasked for by the controls, was present ; but the Imperator\nBand did not appear ;\n\" Madame Guyon,\" who had in the\nprevious winter been referred to once or twice by the con-\ntrols, and had once sent a message, took their place. On\nJuly 31, 1911, a sitting promised by the controls to Lady\nLodge took place, at which her friends communicated\n;\n\" Madame Guyon \" opened it, but Imperator came at the\nend to close the light for good. This was Mrs. Piper's last\nsitting. But it is interesting that a power of automatic\nwriting in an apparently normal state developed to some\nextent. More will be found about this in Chapter III.,\npp. 127-129.\nWhether the cessation of Mrs. Piper's power of going into\ntrance is due to some permanent change in her, or whether\nthe power will return after really prolonged resting, it is,\nof course, impossible to say. Mrs. Piper herself and also\nthe controls are disposed to regard the change as a con-\nsequence of Dr. Stanley Hall's experiments. On one occa-\nsion, in testing for ansesthesia, he produced a blister and\nother effects from which some discomfort was experienced\nafter the trance was over ;\nand, what was more resented by\nthe controls, he deceived the Hodgson control\n\u2014\" told awful\nwhoppers,\" as the control expressed it\u2014and induced him\nby verbal suggestion to accept a false claim of acquaintance,\nto introduce imaginary communicators, and so forth. No\ndoubt these things were disturbing, and may have inter-\nfered with a calm confidence in the sitter, which had perhaps\nbecome a necessary predisposition for going into trance ;\n\f14 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nand what would probably be worse, if the controls are\nphases of Mrs. Piper, may have undermined their confidence\nin themselves. 1\nAt the same time no immediate ill effect\nseems to have been produced. After the Stanley Hall\nsittings Mrs. Piper took her usual summer holiday, and in\nthe autumn gave sittings to known friends as before. The\nweek before she was to have sailed for England she gave\nso many consecutive sittings that she exhausted herself,\nand was subsequently laid up with a very severe cold. She\nhad to defer her sailing, and was still much out of health\nwhen she reached this country. As before remarked, this\nillness, which continued for some time, may have interfered\nwith the faculty of going into trance.\nBut it seems equally probable that the prolonged failure\nto go into trance\u2014occasional failures occurred from time\nto time at all periods\u2014was merely the last step in a gradual\ndecline of power, for there are indications that the sittings\nhad been becoming more of an effort and more exhausting\nas time went on. It was for this reason that sittings,\nwhich up to about 1898 were frequently held on six days a\nweek, and before 1887 sometimes more than once a day,\nwere reduced to three per week. It was for this reason also\n\u2014so it was stated\u2014that writing sittings were preferred to\nvoice sittings, as less tiring. It was probably for this\nreason, at least in part, that the Imperator Band preferred\nwhat may be called medical sittings, or preaching sittings\nin which general advice was given, or sittings in which\nconsolation to the bereaved was proffered, to attempts at\npurely evidential communications.2\nAnd, moreover, all\nthrough the Imperator regime occasional prophecies were\nmade that \" the light \" would fail.\n1\nI think Dr. Stanley Hall\u2014though a psychologist, and though predisposed\nto the belief that the trance personalities were forms of Mrs. Piper\u2014over-\nlooked the fact that he might in this way be permanently injuring her\npsychologically as a subject of experiment.\n\"E.g. on March 19, 1897, the Control (Rector) says :\nR. It is now time to give some comfort and not so much questioning\nbecause the light is not equal to it, my friend. * * * We see\nthat the light would be withdrawn if such things were to be\ncontinued.\nR.

Piper's: Prdnde: Phenomena. 15\nBefore proceeding-, to , any , more detailed analysis and dis-\ncussion, I had' better'' give .-.\nin- ffeijifej introductory chapter a\ngeneral description of the trance \"and the process of going\ninto and coming out of it, and of the physical conditions\naccompanying it ; and in doing so I shall chiefly have\nin mind the later periods of Mrs. Piper's mediumship\n\u2014especially the sittings in 1907, at which I was myself\npresent. In the Phinuit and G. P. periods going into\ntrance was usually a disagreeable process for all concerned,\naccompanied by convulsive movements and grinding of\nteeth, but under the Imperator regime it became, as already\nremarked, quiet and peaceful.\nWhen during these later periods she desired to go\ninto trance, Mrs. Piper sat down at a table with a pile\nof cushions hi front of her and wiUed to go off, apparently\nas one wills to go to sleep. As in the case of sleep success\nwas usual but not invariable. She liked to have some one\npresent who knew about the trance and on whom she\ncould rely, but no one touched her or took any part\nin inducing the trance. The person in charge merely\nsat quietly beside her. After a varying interval her\nconsciousness of her surroundings seemed to become\nsomewhat confused, and then to disappear, visions of spirits\nand imaginary scenes being substituted. It can hardly be\nsaid that a definite line could be observed between different\nstages of consciousness as she went off. Moreover, the\nonlooker is, of course, only aware of them by occasional\nremarks or gestures, and often nothing was said at all\nduring any part of the process of going into trance. What\nwas occasionally said, however, showed that it resembled\nthe waking process, though naturally in reverse order, and\nthe waking process afforded much more opportunity for\nobservation.1\nUsually very soon after the first wavering\nof consciousness, Mrs. Piper's head dropped on to the\npillows, with the face turned to the left, and away from\nthe sitter who sat on her right in order to read the\nscript ; and then for a few minutes she appeared to be in a\n1\nIn the chapter on the waking-stage (Chapter VI.), I shall have occasion\nto refer to some important manifestations in going into trance, notwith-\nstanding their comparative rarity.\n\f16 MjrssJlenr'y\\lliag\\i$cl$.-. [paet\nprofound sleep. A\nDuring this period . the sitter could move\nabout as he pleased, withoux fear ;\n.cf , disracbing her, but\ncould not, of course,\" 'assume that her consciousness was\naltogether as impervious to impressions as appeared. After\na few minutes the right hand woke from this sleep and took\nthe pencil the sitter gave it, and the trance consciousness\nhad begun. The rest of the body remained inert and\nquiescent.\nThis was what happened in a purely writing sitting. In\nthe old voice sittings Mrs. Piper's whole body appeared to\nbe muscularly alert, and the whole upper part of it in use,\nexcept the eyes which were usually closed. Hodgson tells\nus in his first report that he also found the eyeballs rolled\nup whenever he examined them. On one occasion he held\nthe eyelids open and urged Phinuit to move down the eye-\nballs into their ordinary waking position. This was accom-\nplished with apparently considerable effort and strain, and\nafter about half a minute they rolled up again suddenly\n(see Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 5). When Dr. Stanley Hall\nand Dr. Amy Tanner raised the eyelid during a writing\nsitting in 1909, i.e. some twenty years later, . the eyeball\nseemed to be in a normal position\u2014not rolled up\u2014so this\ncannot be taken as an invariable symptom of the trance.\nHodgson found that the pupils reacted to light. The sense\nof hearing and the active sense of touch were in normal\noperation in the Phinuit clays, and he could localise pinches,\nbut there seems to have been a very considerable degree\nof insensitiveness to pain (see Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 447,\n1\nThe attitude assumed was, of course, the result of training. That the\nbrief sleep is really profound so far as the body is concerned seems to be\nconfirmed by an observation of Hodgson's on April 22, 1897, when Mrs.\nPiper happened to be troubled with a cough. She coughed while going\ninto trance\n\u2014\" Mrs. P.'s spirit not yet departed,\" as Hodgson expresses\nit. The cough ceased during the sleep, but began again \" with incoming\nof other spirit.\" The interval of sleep was sometimes very brief. Thus\nMr. Dorr, recording a voice sitting on March 20, 1905, says about her going\noff :\n\" Passes into sleep, head drooping, and almost immediately rising\nagain.\" When the communication is by voice, it should be observed, the\nhead is erect, not lying on the pillows. On the other hand, on one\noccasion (September 13, 1898) it is recorded that \" owing to some difficulty\nin arranging the cushions Mrs. Piper slept quietly for ten minutes before\nwriting\n\"\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 17\nand Vol. VIII., p. 5), and smell and taste seem to have been\nat least weakened in the trance (see Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\npp. 4 and 5). Dr. Stanley Hall and Miss Tanner in 1909\ntried some tests of a similar kind to Hodgson's, in a writ-\ning sitting, but seem to have been left in doubt as to\nwhether the sensibility was or was not in any respect\nbelow the normal {Studies in Spiritualism, pp. 17-21 and\n235-245).\nIn the purely writing sittings the whole body, as already\nremarked, seems inert, 1\nexcept the right hand, which is\nvery active and expressive\u2014gesticulating as well as writing,\nand exercising an apparently delicate sense of touch with the\nfinger tips. The sense of hearing is also in operation, and\nis, I have myself no doubt, exercised through the ears in the\nordinary way, though some have thought that the organ\nof hearing is for the time being in the hand. 2\nThe writing\nhand is sensitive to being touched by the sitter, who can,\nhowever, take hold of the head or left hand and move them\ninto a more comfortable position on the pillows without\nany apparent consciousness on the part of the patient. But\nit must be observed that it was often because his attention\nwas drawn by the script to some unnamed form of dis-\ncomfort that the sitter w%s led to give such assistance.\nIt may be worth while to give a few specimens of help\ngiven in this way by the sitter at different periods. We\nmust first observe that until Phinuit's final withdrawal in\nJanuary, 1897, there was generally an assumption while\nwriting was going on that he was in possession of the head\nand the rest of the body other than the writing hand, even\nwhen it was lying inert on the pillows. The following is a\nspecimen of help given to the medium under these circum-\nstances on June 27, 1895. Professor W. Romaine Newbold\nwas the sitter, and the writing control purported to be Sir\nWalter Scott. (For a more complete extract from the record,\nsee Appendix to Chapter III., p. 437.)\n1\nWhen writing sittings first began in 1892 and a writing and speaking-\ncontrol sometimes purported to be present at the same time, it was only,\nI think, when the speaking control lapsed into the background, and was, in\nfact, in abeyance, that the body sagged down and had to be supported.\n2\nThis question is further discussed below, pp. 54-55.\n\f1\n8\nMrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\n[Medium's head falls from the cushion.]\nW. R. N. Wait a moment Sir Walter while I fix the head of\nthe medium in place.\nW. S. Yes sir. [Hand stops writing until the head is\nagain firmly set in place. Phinuit thanks me in\nstifled tones. I ask whether the light is going\nout. Hand replies]\nW. S. The light so called ? No sir.\nAfter Phinuit's final departure the function of occupying\nthe head, etc., while another control is writing is sometimes\nsaid to be performed by Rector. Thus on March 5, 1897 :\n[Disturbance with the head of Mrs. P.]\n{George Eliot writes.} Rector holds the other side and\nbegs me to ask you to assist the material while he holds\nthe spiritual. Then I will go on with you. Pardon any\ninterruptions that may occur. [I rearrange Mrs. P.'s head\nwith cushions, etc.] Better so. Thanks to you.\nThe idea of this kind of divided control was gradually\ndropped, and I think there was no such assumption in Mrs.\nPiper's later sittings. The writing hand then simply asks\nfor assistance to be given to the light\n\u2014\" light \" in this con-\nnexion meaning medium.

Sir\nOliver Lodge tells us {Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 447) that\n\" her pulse is affected beyond what [he] can imagine to be\nthe control of volition,\" but he does not tell us either the\ndegree or the direction of the change. Hodgson quotes in\nVol. XIII., p. 479, the following report by Dr. Lena V.\nIngraham, who had a sitting with Mrs. Piper on March 12,\n1893, preliminary to a very serious operation which she was\nto perform on her two days later. Dr. Ingraham gave\nHodgson the following statement as regards this sitting :\nMrs. Piper's pulse before the trance was rapid, from\nthe fact that she became rather excited over dread of\nexamination, operation, etc., but just before the trance it\nwas about 72 per minute, and was not accelerated during\nthe trance.\nHer temperature was 99 degrees before, during and after\nthe trance.\nMiss Tanner, Ph.D., in the book already quoted, Studies\nin Spiritualism, p. 14, writes as follows about pulse and\nbreathing\u2014her observations relating to the six sittings she\nand Dr. Stanley Hall had in 1909 :\nHer entrance to the trance state is voluntary, though\nshe is unable to describe in detail her mental attitude\nShe usually carries on a casual conversation with the sitters\nwhile sitting in an arm-chair in front of a table on which\nthree pillows are placed. She tries not to think intently\nof anything, and more or less consciously she makes her\nbreathing much slower. She begins to look sleepy, the eyes\nbecome slightly fixed and staring, within a minute the\nmouth drops open, and the eyes become rigid, the breath-\ning is still slower, and in five or six minutes from the\nfirst look of sleepiness the head is dropped on the pillow,\nthe breathing is slower by one half than normal, and very\nstertorous, and the hand is ready to write. Usually as\nthe trance comes on the face twitches slightly, and\nsometimes the fingers do also. Sometimes there is some\nincoherent talking. The pulse varies from about 84, which\nseems to be the normal rate before the onset of the\n\f20 M?:s. Henry SidgwicJc. [PABT\ntrance, to between 70 and 76 at the close. The breathing\nvaries from 20 to 22 for the normal, to between 7 and\n10 during the trance, up to the time the hand ceases to\nwrite. It then becomes gradually more rapid, rising to\nnormal in the course of fifteen minutes.\nOn page 18, Miss Tanner says :\nThe breathing varies from approximately 22 in the\nnormal to, at lowest, 7, and, as a rule, 10 in the trance.1\nThis profound variation in the breathing, with the lessened\noxygenation of the blood, must result in a partial suffoca-\ntion, a temporary toxemia, and is probably the agency by\nmeans of which the normal consciousness is put out of\ncommission and the control put into possession.\nHowever this may be, it seems highly probable that the\nslow breathing accounts for the great desire for fresh air\n\u2014\nwide open windows being frequently insisted on even in the\ncoldest weather.\nStertorous breathing in going into trance is sometimes\nrecorded by various observers, but I do not think it\noccurred, at least in my own experience, after the trance\nwas fully established. The breathing while the writing was\ngoing on was, in the sittings of 1906-7, exceedingly quiet.\nA remark made by Miss Tanner, lower down on the page\n(18) from which I last quoted, that \"both ears are un-\ncovered,'' suggests that the face was buried in the pillows,\nwhich would thus make an obstruction to breathing which\nmight lead to its remaining stertorous during the trance\nproper. In our sittings the head was turned to the left\nand the right ear was buried in the pillow, and pains\nwere taken by the sitter to see that the pillow did not\nobstruct mouth and nose. This was also Hodgson's\npractice ;\ne.g. he records on December 18, 1905, \" R. H.\nslightly rearranges Mrs. P.'s head, as she begins to breatbe\nrather heavily. The nose was pressing somewhat on the\ncushion.\"\n1\nCompare Sir Oliver Lodge's observation on Mrs. Piper's coming out\nfrom her last trance (Appendix to Chapter III., p. 510), when her breathing\nseems almost to have stopped.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper s Trance Phenomena. 21\nReaders of Proceedings are already familiar with the\nprocedure in what I may call the trance proper, 1\nwhich has\nbeen more than once described in our Proceedings. I may\nrefer the reader especially to Sir Oliver Lodge's account of it\nin Vol. XXIII., pp. 131-135, and spare myself further\ndescription. Much less, however, has been said about the\nwaking-stage, of which Hodgson seems to have taken com-\nparatively little account,\u2014and which, indeed, had not in\nthe sittings up to the end of the period with which his last\nreport deals, taken the important place which it has since\noccupied. I will therefore now give a pretty full general\naccount of the waking-stage, based on notes of the sittings\nheld in England in 1906-7.\nWhen the writing came to an end\u2014finishing rather faintly\nand feebly, and usually with words of leave-taking\u2014the\nright hand became relaxed and as inert as the rest of the\nbody ; the pencil was dropped, and Mrs. Piper had again,\nas in going into trance, the appearance of being in a pro-\nfound sleep. After an hiterval of from two to five minutes\nfrom the dropping of the pencil, but sometimes longer, 2\nshe\nbegan to raise her head and body into an upright sitting\nposture. This sometimes began with stretching out the\nleft arm. The raising of the head was accomplished slowly\nand with effort. Sometimes it fell again on to the cushions\nafter being raised or partially raised ; the sitter could\nprevent this and sometimes hasten the proceedings by slightly\nsupporting the head. Then the eyes gradually opened, but\nwithout seeming to see what was actually before them. They\ntended to look upwards at what, from pointing and smiles\nand other gestures, and from words spoken later on, appeared\nto be visions of people and scenes of great brilliancy and\nbeauty. Sometimes these imaginary persons gave her\nimaginary flowers, which she would hold between her finger\n1\nIn calling the main part of the sitting the trance proper, to dis-\ntinguish it from the more unstable condition passed through at the begin-\nning and end, I do not mean to imply that a strict definition of trance would\nnot include part at least of the waking-stage.\n2\nIn the last sitting recorded, July 31, 1911, it was a quarter of an hour\nafter the writing ceased before the waking-stage began (see Appendix to\nChapter III., p. 516).\n\f22 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PABT\nand thumb and smell with great apparent enjoyment. 1\nThe\nright hand\u2014the one that had been writing\u2014was drawn\nup on to the cushion stiffly and with apparent difficulty\nafter she had attained the erect sitting posture, and some-\ntimes not till after the speaking had begun. She often,\nin course of waking, complained of \" aches,\" and rubbed\nthe back of her hand.\nShe usually began to speak two or three minutes after\nbeginning to sit up, but speech was sometimes delayed\nlonger, and the gestures above mentioned, in which\nhead and hands came into play, often preceded it. The\nvocal organs, and especially the muscles used in articu-\nlation, seemed generally not to be completely available at\nfirst, and whispered and murmured words were pronounced\nin an inarticulate manner, which made them difficult and\noften impossible to catch. The thickness of speech was\nlike that of a person half awake and unwilling to rouse him-\nself, but apparently the failure to control the muscles of\nspeech was not in Mrs. Piper's waking-stage voluntary, for\nsometimes at request, or spontaneously, she would try to\nrepeat distinctly, but try vainly. She was certainly often\naware of the indistinctness and was liable to be irritated by\nit. On one occasion\u2014December 19, 1906\u2014she remarked,\n\" My speech isn't good\u2014they haven't taken the bonnet\noff me yet \"\n\u2014the bonnet being something often mentioned\nwhich she says her visionary people put on her when they\nsend her back to her body, and which perhaps is her dream\nexplanation of actual difficulty in speaking and seeing, though\nit may be merely a way of accounting for the disappearance\nof the heavenly visions. Generally some minutes elapsed\nafter the waking stage speaking began before what she said\nbecame at all distinctly audible and coherent sentences\ncould be made out.\nThe speech was addressed sometimes to the visionary\npersonages in whose company she seemed to herself to be,\nand sometimes to the sitter whose questions and suggestions\nshe would generally respond to, though, as a rule, apparently\nregarding him quite impersonally and remaining almost\n1 The particular imagery tending to prevail in the waking-stage varied\nat different periods (see Chapter VI.).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 23\nunaware of his existence till she was nearly normal. Some-\ntimes what she said seemed to be a repetition addressed to\nno one in particular of remarks she was hearing.\nConsciousness of her actual surroundings seemed to come\ngradually and by steps, there being a brief period when the\nvisionary surroundings and the real ones were apparently\nperceived more or less together, and during this period she\ncould sometimes be put back a step by judicious questions\nand remarks calculated to fix her attention on the visions.\nShortly before normal consciousness returned an experience\nconstantly occurred which she described as her head snap-\nping, and which, as Sir Oliver Lodge remarks {Proceedings,\nVol. XXIII., p. 186), she half seems to expect the sitter\nto hear. \" Sounds like wheels clicking together and then\nsnaps,\" she said, describing it on one occasion (Nov. 11, 1906,\nProceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 187), and on another (February\n20, 1907), \" Heard my head snap ? It goes suzz\u2014suzz\u2014er\n\u2014suzz and then it cracks.\" This snap of late years\ngenerally occurred twice with a short interval between,\nbefore she completely recovered her normal consciousness.\nI think it was a less invariable phenomenon hi earlier days.\n\" I hear something snap in my head sometimes,\" she said\non February 27, 1897.\nThe sensation is not always described in terms of\nsound. Thus on March 6, 1897, she said, \"When some-\nthing seems to snap in my head I can't remember any more.\nIt seems as if there were some threads at the back of my\nhead, and then they got pulled to the front, like three\nthreads it seems, and when that gets puUed to the\nfront all that I see is stopped.\" And on December 13,\n1897, \" I felt that separation hi my head.\" On November\n13, 1905, this feeling of separation is combined with sound,\n\" Did you hear my head snap ? I feel as if there was some\ndivision in my brain.\" On January 1, 1907, she said,\n\" Head snapped twice in two places.\" I should imagine\nthat the sensation is due to some change hi flow of blood\nto the brain. Mrs. Piper takes this view herself, perhaps\nas the result of a suggestion from some sitter. Thus at the\nend of the waking-stage on January 13, 1909, when Miss\nPope was the sitter in charge, Mrs. Piper said, \" What did\n\f24 Mrs. Henry Siclgwick. [part\nMr. Myers mean by Bombino ? He said it just as my head\nsnapped. My head^ goes s\u2014s\u2014s click. I think the blood\nsettles back in my brain and then I am conscious.\"\nChange of circulation is also suggested by prickling sensa-\ntions, of which she sometimes speaks both in going into\nand coming out of trance. Thus on February 1, 1897 :\n\" I prickle from my head to my feet.\" January 22, 1901 :\n\" Well, I think I'll prickle all to pieces. Is it night ? You\nhear my head snap.\" March 6, 1901 (going into trance) :\n\" My face prickles terribly sometimes [rubbing her cheeks].\"\nNovember 20, 1905 (waking-stage) :\n\" [Rubbing her cheek]\n\" My face is asleep. Hear it snap ? * * * My face felt\njust like your foot when it goes to sleep. * * * It\nprickles.\"\nWhen she first perceived her actual surroundings her\nvision appeared to be blurred from want of proper focussing\nof the eyes or some other cause. Everything looked dark\nand horrid\u2014not it would seem merely from contrast with\nthe previous heavenly vision. In the London sittings the\nwindow was generally the first thing she made out clearly.\nShe frequently complained of spiders crawling on the wall\nand of cobwebs over her face. And she misinterpreted\nobjects, apparently from indistinctness of vision, taking on\none occasion (March 5, 1907) her own muff and bonnet on\na chair for a man, and on another (January 30, 1907) a fur\ncoat, similarly on a chair, for a cow, the sight of which at\nfirst amused her and then distressed her so much that she\nactually shed tears. On one occasion (March 20, 1905),\nafter a voice sitting with Mr. Dorr, the blurred vision con-\ntinued to some extent after she was practically normal, and\nshe recognised the fact and described it :\n\" Let me take\nyour glasses. I want to see if I can see any better with\nthem. I have a blurred feeling across my eyes The\nheaviness in my head has gone but my eyes are still a little\nblurred. I feel that if I would get my reading glasses and\nput them on it would help that, that feeling.\" Ten or\nfifteen minutes later she said :\n\" My eyes are quite clear\nnow, that blurred condition has all passed off.\" The follow-\ning remark on April 12, 1905, also indicates a consciousness\nof previously imperfect vision: \"Yes I can see perfectly. I\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper s Trance Phenomena. 25\nheard my head snap. When my head snaps you see I see\nclearly.\"\nOne thing concerning vision which she frequently men-\ntioned as having occurred just before she had completely\nrecovered normal consciousness, is different from indistinct-\nness of vision. She would say, namely, that the sitter, when\nshe first saw him, had looked to her very small and a long\nway off, as if, as she sometimes described it, she had been\nlooking at him through the wrong end of an opera glass.\nThis illusion may have been either an actual hallucination\nof vision or a pseudo-memory, arising from the theory that\nshe returned rapidly to her body from a distance. 1\nThus on\nFebruary 20, 1907 :\n\" I saw you, Mrs. Sidgwick, but you\nwere very small.\" This was at my first sitting with her\nin the series, and when normal or nearly normal, she pro-\nceeded to explain how when she is coming out of trance\npeople appear to her as through the wrong end of an opera\nglass. November 13, 1905 :\n\" I saw Mr. Hodgson, but he\nwas a long way off at first ; he was very smaU, then he got\nlarger. Did you hear my head snap ?\n\"\nThe reverse of this was said to happen to her vision of\nImperator as she returned to earth on April 8, 1897: \"I\nsaw that gentleman with the cross again, and he gets so\nsmall.\" At one time she speaks of something expanding\neither in the sitter or herself. Thus on April 17, 1905 :\n\" Oh,\nMr. Dorr\u2014I thought you were a small man, but you kept\non expanding ! [Becomes quite normal again.] \" And on\nthe following day :\n\" Did you hear my head snap ? You\nseemed so small and something in my eyes seemed to exjDand\nand expand till you became big.\" On May 24, 1905, a\ndifferent comparison is made :\n\" When I came out of this\njust now you looked very small, then you kept expanding,\nlike a rubber ball.\" Once at least (December 26, 1899),\nshe remarked in going off into trance :\n\" Everything grows\nso small.\"\nThe exact moment of return to normal consciousness can\n1\nAs against this theory, it must be observed that some people have, I\nunderstand, had experience of seeing things small and as though far off\nwhen in a semi-conscious state, as in trying to keep awake in church, or\nin recovering from an anaesthetic.\n\f26 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [PART\nhardly be defined ; \u2014indeed Mrs. Piper often remained in a\nslightly dazed condition for some little time after she had\nbegun to move about the room and talk in an ordinary way.\nBut the moment, so far as it could be determined, when she\nfully realised the situation and talked entirely rationaUy,\noccurred, during the sittings of 1906-7, from 14 to 26 or even\n30 minutes after the ceasing of the writing and dropping of\nthe writing hand. The time tended to lengthen, for in the\nfirst ten sittings of that series in which it is recorded, the\naverage duration was 18 minutes, and in the last ten, 23\nminutes. The reason probably was that those who\nmanaged the sittings\u2014chiefly Mr. Piddington and myself\n\u2014\ncoming to perceive that the waking stage was of considerable\ninterest and likely to produce evidential matter, our own\nremarks and questions retarded the return to normality.\nI am disposed to think that in Mr. Dorr's sittings of 1908\n(see Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.), the duration of the waking-\nstage was longer still, but this impression is only based on\nthe records of the remarks made in the waking-stage ; the\nactual time is not recorded. There can be no doubt, I\nthink, that the waking-stage was at least sometimes\nshortened by the request of the sitter, addressed either to\nthe trance personalities before the waking-stage began or\nto the waking-stage intelligence. The trance also could\nbe similarly shortened by suggestion. 1\nIt was sometimes\npossible, as I have said, to prolong a dream-like state when\nMrs. Piper had almost recovered, by keeping her mind on\nideas that had prevailed during the waking-stage. 2\nAfter\none of Mr. Dorr's sittings with a long waking-stage in 1908,\nMrs. Piper's daughter reported that her mother had had, an\nhour or so afterwards, a slight momentary tendency towards\nan apparent relapse into a dream-like state, and it appears\nthis had also happened on a previous occasion. Whether\n1\nHodgson sometimes helped to bring the trance to an end by physical\nsigns ;\ne.g. on November 30, 1892, a spirit controlled who had died of cancer\nin the stomach, and the medium apparently suffered so much, and gave\nsuch signs of physical anguish, that the sitters were afraid of exhausting\nher and helped to bring the trance to an end by pressing on the back of\nher neck. Phinuit commented at the next sitting on the discourtesy of\npreventing his returning to bid good-bye.\n2\nSee a case quoted below, p. 250.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 27\nthis tendency to relapse had any causal relation to the\nprolonged waking-stage is not known.\nThe consciousnesses of the trance and of the waking-stage\noccupy a large part of the discussion to follow. Here, how-\never, I may say, speaking briefly and quite generally, that\nthe consciousness of the waking-stage seems to resemble that\nof many dreams in instability, incoherence, and varying\nrelations to the actual surroundings. The scenery of the\nwaking-stage, the imagined surroundings, are generally dif-\nferent from Mrs. Piper's actual surroundings, of which, till\ntowards the end, she is to a large extent unaware. The\nshifting and uncertain nature of the imaginary surroundings\nand incidents is again like dreams, and the gradual com-\nbination of dream images with actual surroundings is like\nwhat sometimes happens to an ordinary sleeper when he\nwakes slowly. The muscles, however, are not relaxed nor the\nsenses in abeyance as much as in ordinary sleep. In this\nthe waking-stage is more like sleep walking ;\nthough, of\ncourse, the muscles come into use in some ordinary dreams\n\u2014as when a dog dreams of hunting and moves his legs and\nyaps in sleep accordingly. In the waking-stage Mrs. Piper\nis usually herself the principal character of the piece\u2014the\n\" I \" who sees and hears and feels and talks with the sitter.\nThe other characters are as a rule conceived as outside\nherself ; and even when then remarks are given in the first\nperson she usually, though I think not quite invariably,\nregards herself as repeating what they say.\nIn almost all these particulars the waking-stage conscious-\nness differs from the trance consciousness. The latter is\nstable and coherent\u2014that is, consistent with itself or nearly\nso\u2014while it lasts. It has a definite idea of its relation,\nspatial and other, to the actual surroundings, and there\nare apparently no imagined surroundings except spirits, who\nare usually conceived as present in the room. The writing\nor speaking \" I \"\u2014the control\u2014never appears to regard\nitself as Mrs. Piper, and always speaks of her conscious-\nness as outside itself, out of the body, and not at the\nmoment present at all. The control resembles, externally\nat least, the personation by a hypnotised subject of\ncharacters suggested to him by the hypnotiser\u2014as, for\n\f28 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ninstance, when told he is Napoleon, he acts the part. 1\nThis\nis, of course, more apparent in the voice sittings when the\nwhole body is more or less available for acting, than in\nthe writing sittings.\nWe have, then, three states of dissociation to study. (1)\nThe full trance state, in which the controlling intelligence\napparently believes itself to be other than Mrs. Piper, and\nnot to be in conscious relation with any part of her mind,\nthough conscious of the position of her body and conscious\nof her surroundings\u2014that is, of the room and the persons in\nit.\n2\n(2) The waking-stage, in which the controlling intelli-\ngence is consciously Mrs. Piper herself, but is not conscious\nof her surroundings. (3) The state accompanying automatic\nscript while Mrs. Piper is apparently normal, in which we\nhave two consciousnesses, or a divided consciousness, at\nwork ; Mrs. Piper fuUy aware of herself and her surroundings\n\u2014able to hear and to make remarks to other people, and\nto read the script and address questions to the scribe, and\nthe script at the same time (or at any rate in rapid alterna-\ntion) carrying on its own train of thought, or replying\nappropriately to remarks made. An account of this de-\nvelopment will be found in Chapter III., pp. 127-9. Concern-\ning a fourth state\u2014Mrs. Piper in semi-hypnosis\u2014I quote\nin an Appendix to this chapter (see p. 333) a brief report on\nobservations and experiments by William James, published in\nthe Proceedings of the American S.P.R. in 1886. Mrs. Piper\nwas not a very good hypnotic subject, but she could\u2014at\nthat time at least\u2014be put into a semi-hypnotic state, and\ncomparison between this and the trance proper and the\nwaking-stage is interesting.\n1\nCompare Professor C. Richet on Mrs. Piper (Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\np. 620) :\n\" Pour tout observateur habitue a voir ]es somnambules, l'etat\ncle Madame Piper est tout-a-fait le meme que l'etat de somnambules en.\nsommeil magnetique, avee transformations de personnalite.\"\n2\nThis, I think, extends to persons introduced after the trance has begun,\nand who are not sitting near Mrs. Piper or taking part as sitters.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 29\nCHAPTER II.\nTheories of \"Controls\" as to their Relation to the\nBody and Spirit of the Medium.\nWhat I have so far said is intended as an introduction to\nan examination of the records in detail for evidence as to the\nnature of the consciousnesses with which we have to deal,\nand their relation to Mrs. Piper's normal consciousness. It\nwill be convenient to begin this examination with the\naccounts given by the \" controls \" themselves as to the\nnature of control, and it is with this that the present chapter\nwill be occupied. Special series of sittings have been held\nat different times with the object of questioning the\n\u00a3:\ncon-\ntrols \" and ascertaining the views they put forward on this\nand other points. Hodgson had one such series with Phinuit\nas control in May and June, 1888. Professor Newbold and\nHodgson had one largely with the object of questioning\nG. P. in 1895, and Hodgson had a number of sittings in\nthe winter and spring of 1896-7 for the purpose of question-\ning the Imperator Band. These various series afford, on the\nwhole, the most important sources of our information, and\nI quote largely from them in the Appendix to this\nchapter, but we have to compare them with statements\nmade at other times. \\\nThe trance controls, as already said, always claim to be\nentirely distinct from and other than Mrs. Piper's spirit,\nwhich they say has left, or been removed from, her body\nwhile the control occupies it in her place. In the days\nwhen Phinuit was the principal control and the sittings all\nvoice sittings, and also in certain later voice sittings, the\ncontrol was supposed to occupy the whole organism. \" I\nuse the medium's organism as my instrument, exactly as\n\f30 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nshe uses it,\" says Phinuit on June 2, 1888 (see Appendix,\np. 339). Thus Phinuit having been asked by Hodgson to\nstand up :\nMrs. Piper stood up without changing the position of\nher feet, at the same time throwing her head slightly\nback and her chest forward, and thrusting the thumbs\njauntily into what would have been the armholes of her\nwaistcoat had she worn one. (Proceedings. Vol. VIII., p. 5,\nfootnote.)\nAgain, Miss A. M. R. writes on December 17, 1888 :\nMy friend took control first. He used to be lame * * *\nThis evening he sat about five or six feet from my\nfolding bed, on which were some ornaments. I asked\nhim if he thought he could walk over there * * * Instead\nof walking as Dr. P[hinuit] would do, he leaned heavily\non me, and seemed to hop or hitch along on one foot,\nexactly as a person would do who could only use one\nfoot in walking. After he came back, he dropped into\nthe chair exhausted, and said that was the hardest work\nhe had done since coming back, and that it was too\nmuch of the real life for him ;\n* * he was ver}7\nglad to\nhave had the opportunity to handle the articles with\nthe hands of the medium. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp.\n111-112.)\nAgain, Mr. Rogers Rich says of a sitting on November 8,\n1888 :\nI remarked an odd movement of the medium while under\nthis influence ; she apparently was twirling a moustache, a\ntrick which my friend {i.e. the control} formerly practised\nmuch. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 129.)\nCompare with this G. P. apparently pulling his moustache\non May 29, 1892 (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 579).\nMore explicitly Stainton Moses, controlling on June 24,\n1895 (in a writing sitting, however), says :\nI am so very delighted to find this bright path to\nEarth * * * I am here in every organ of a human body.\n(Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 39.)\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 31\nAgain, Hodgson records that, the astronomer Proctor con-\ntrolling on July 3, 1895 :\nThe hands and arms made movements as if holding a\ntelescope, looking through it, directing it upwards, turning\nit in a sweep, drawing it out, adjusting it, turning round\nthe eyepiece, working a side screw etc.1\nThere is an instance of not quite complete control of the\nlimbs recorded, which shows that it was usually conceived\nas complete. Hodgson writes :\nAt a sitting which I attended on February 20, 1888,\nPhinuit declared that one of his thumbs \" belonged to the\nmedium \" and added \" I cannot move that.\" {Proceedings,\nVol. VIII., p. 31, footnote.)\nThere are variations, however, in degree to the command\nof the organism claimed. \" Sometimes I do not get so\nmuch control,\" says Phinuit on June 2, 1888 (Appendix,\np. 339, and see also May 26, 1888, Appendix, p. 337).\nPossibly the control growing weak\u2014which is often said to\noccur towards the end of a sitting 2\n\u2014is another way of\nexpressing this, though this weakness is sometimes spoken\nof as due to want of \"light\" ;\ncommunicators, however, are\nalso spoken of as getting weak (see Chapter V., p. 162).\nThere are, moreover, besides variations in the degree of\ncontrol, some definite and constant limitations apparently,\nfor Phinuit tells us that he cannot taste, and, as stated\nabove (Chapter I., p. 17), experiments seem to confirm\nthis to a considerable extent. Another limitation is in the\nuse of the eyes, which are closed during the sitting. Phinuit,\nhowever, in the conversation on June 2, 1888, already\nreferred to, asserts that he does use the medium's eyes,\nand when reminded that they are closed, says he means\nthat he uses the medium's brain. The passage (Appendix,\np. 339) should be read.\nWith writing sittings, the idea of deliberate occupation\nby the control of part only of the medium's bodily frame\ncame in\u2014probably because expression by writing in Mrs.\n1\nFor a fuller report of this sitting see Appendix to Chapter III., p. 448.\n2\nSee, e.g. below, pp. 33, 43, 46, 338.\n\f32 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nPiper's trance began by being associated with divided con-\ntrol\u2014one control expressing himself by speech and the other\nby writing.\nWriting during Mrs. Piper's trance was not a new pheno-\nmenon in itself when the writing sittings began. Her first\nmediumistic manifestation seems to have been the writing of\na message \" under control \" (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp.\n46-47), and during later sittings scraps of writing were occa-\nsionally produced. Thus on December 24, 1889, in a\nsitting at which Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Thompson were present\nand Sir Oliver Lodge was taking notes, towards the end of\nthe sitting :\nHere he {Phinuit apparently} asked for pencil and\nscrawled a few words, getting very weak. Writing just\nlegible afterwards in mirror as \" Ted \"\u2014\" Isaac \"\u2014\n\" Horse \"\u2014\" Dear Brother \"\n\u2014{all topics which had been\npreviously mentioned during the sitting}. (Proceedings,\nVol. VI., p. 511.)\nAgain, on the following day, Phinuit says :\nGive me a pencil. [Wrote on back of letter while\nholding it to forehead, the word \" Nellie \" distinctly.]\nThere, that's her name and that's your Aunt Anne's\nwriting ; she wrote it.\n1\n(Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 513.)\nFor another instance see Vol. VI., p. 519, and for a per-\nhaps more instructive case see February 1, 1890 (Vol. VI.,\np. 538), as follows : Phinuit was controlling and speaking for\na communicator unknown to Sir Oliver Lodge, who was\nconducting the sitting and taking notes :\nO. J. L. Will you send him your name, sir ?\nW, i, 1. I will write it for you. Show him the\nchain again. Hold it up. (Medium writes.) There,\n1\nSir Oliver Lodge notes {op. cit. p. 515) :\n\" This writing was not '\nmirror\nwriting.' Usually when Phinuit wrote on card held in front of him the\nwriting was perverted so as to be legible in a mirror ; sometimes each letter\nwas right but the order perverted. Single letters like capitals were made\nproperly. But when the writing was done on paper held to Mrs. Piper's\nforehead, i.e. with the hand turned round\u2014pencil towards face\u2014as in the\npresent instance, the writing was ordinary.\"\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 33\nthat's my full name. [Wrote James Wilson back-\nwards, illegible till afterwards in mirror.]\nO. J. L. Is this his name ?\nYes, that's right. 1 * * * He's a dear old man, but\n1 can't hold him, he's gone. He was quite weak\nwhile writing. I can't do everything.\nI think there is no doubt that Phinuit is throughout the\nspeaker here\u2014speaking sometimes for himself and some-\ntimes for the communicator, but it appears to be claimed\nthat both \" Mr. Wilson \" here and \" Aunt Anne \" (see above)\nthemselves write. If so, it would seem to be as joint-control\nwith Phinuit and assisted by him, for there is no suggestion,\nas later, that his hand is taken away from him and used\nindependently. A somewhat similar incident is reported on\nMarch 10, 1892. Phinuit said the communicator would try\nto write, whereupon some not very legible attempts to write\na sentence were made. When the sitter (not Hodgson, by\nthe way) asked \" Why can't he talk that ?\n\" Phinuit replied,\n\" He's too weak.\" There seem to have been one or two\nsuch cases about this time, leading on to divided control\nand the full development of writing under the G. P. regime.\nA case of divided control was, however, apparently wit-\nnessed by Miss A. M. R. on May 23, 1891. Her friend H.,\nwho sometimes controlled\u2014as in the case quoted above,\np. 30\u2014more or less independently, 2\nwrote several sheets\nto which Miss R. appended the note \" Written when Phinuit\nhad control, but H. said he seized and controlled the hand\nand wrote it \" (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 292). But the\nfirst important case of divided control that came under\nHodgson's own observation occurred on March 12, 1892.\nabout ten days before G. P.'s first manifestation. It was\napparently an entirely spontaneous development. Hodgson\ndescribes it as follows in Proceedings, Vol. XIII. , p. 291 :\nThe sitter, a lady, had taken several articles as test\nobjects, among them a ring which had belonged to Annie\nD . Phinuit made references to this lady, giving the\n1\nN.B.\u2014The Christian name was wrong.\n2\nThough apparently with Phinuit's assistance, see Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII., p. 113.\nc\n\f34 31r$. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nname Annie, and just before the close of the sitting Mrs.\nPiper's right hand moved slowly up until it was over the\ntop of her head. The arm seemed to become rigidly fixed\nin its position,, as though spasmodically contracted, but the\nhand trembled very rapidly. Phinuit exclaimed several\ntimes :\n\" She's taken my hand away,\" and added :\n\" she\nwants to write.\" I put a pencil between the fingers, and\nplaced a block book on the head under the pencil. Xo\nwriting came until, obeying Phinuit's order to \" hold the\nhand.\" I grasped the hand very firmly at its junction with\nthe wrist and so stopped its trembling or vibrating. It\nthen wrote : \"I am Annie D [surname correctly\ngiven] ... I am not dead ... I am not dead but living\n... I am not dead . . . world . . . goodbye ... I am\nAnnie D .\" The hold of the pencil then relaxed, and\nPhinuit began to murmur \" Give me my hand back, give\nme my hand back.\" The arm, however, remained in its\ncontracted position for a short time, but finally, as though\nwith much difficulty, and slowly, it moved down to the\nside, and Phinuit appeared to regain control over it.\n1\nThere was no proof in this case that the intelligence using\nthe voice and that using the hand were really independent,\nbut sometimes there seem to have been two distinct and\nsimultaneous streams of consciousness, for Hodgson tells us\nthat it was not necessary for Phinuit to stop talking while\nthe hand was writing. He gives several instances of this\nin Vol. XIII., pp. 292-295 (see also p. 398), though without\nmuch detail. He seems even to have succeeded in getting\nwriting with both hands while Phinuit was speaking. Thus\nhe says :\nOn March 18, 1895, another attempt much more suc-\ncessful was made, when I was accompanied for the\npurpose by Miss Edmunds. Her \" deceased sister \" wrote\nwith one hand and G. P. with the other, while Phinuit\n1 After a few sittings at which the writing was done in the above-described\nattitude Hodgson, partly by peraua3ion and partly by force, induced the\narm to come down and write in a more ordinary manner on a table (Vol.\nXIII., p. 292). But convulsive movements and muscular contractions\ncontinued to occur during the writing at times till the Imperator regime\nbegan, and even occasionally afterwards.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena.\nwas talking, all simultaneously on different subjects. (Yol.\nxm\u201e p. 294.\nJ\nHodgson further says :\nWhen the sitter turns to pay attention to the hand.\nPhinuit frequently makes some such enigmatical remark\nas \" 1*11 help him.\" or \" 111 help to hold him up.\" At\nother times Phinuit will request that an article should\nbe given to himself {i.e. placed in the left hand}, so\nthat he might have something to engage his attention.\n* * * At any time., apparently under these circumstances.\nPhinuit can be evoked from his silence by talking into\nthe ear, and will at once resume the communication while\nthe writing continues without a break.\nThis phenomenon seems in some respects to resemble the\nexperience of some automatic writers (without trance), who\nfind it helpful to read a book while the writing proceeds.\nBut perhaps Gurney's experiments in post-hypnotic sugges-\ntion, in which his subjects would work out problems with\nplanehette while reading aloud, are more strictly analogous.\nThey are described in his paper on \" Peculiarities of\nCertain Post-hypnotic States\/'\" Proceedings, Vol. IV. For\nparticular examples, see pp. 317 to 321. but the whole paper\nmay be read with advantage in connexion with our present\nsubject.\nIt is to be regretted that we have not any fuller descrip-\ntion of the simultaneous working of two independent streams\nof consciousness in Mrs. Piper's case, for it might have thrown\nsome light on the nature of the \" control.'\"'' The power\nseems to have lasted only for two or three years (the years\nin which Mrs. Piper's powers perhaps culminated); for I can\nfind no such clear and complete instances of it among later\nrecords. Indeed there is some evidence that the power of\nseparate and simultaneous, as distinct from alternate, action\nwas lost. Phinuit seems to imply that he has not got it\nin a sitting of Professor Xewbold's on June 19. 1895 (see\nAppendix, p. 370). Phinuit says :\nI'll tell you another thing. While George talks to you\n{i.e. by writing}, if it was not for interruption I could\n\f36 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ntalk at the same time. George's thoughts have no more\nto do with mine than yours have.\nThere appear, however, to have been one or two instances\nof brief sentences being written simultaneously with some\ntalking in Professor Newbold's sittings in 1895.\nOn another occasion (December 21, 1896), Hodgson and\na lady being the sitters, Phinuit is talking when G. P. begins\nto write :\nG. P. I have just returned from Mexico. Who is speaking ?\nR. H. Phinuit's talking to the lady.\nG. P. I am interrupted, H. I wish the doctor to keep quiet.\nR. H. Never mind him. Go on with me.\nG. P. I have seen D. and there is no reason why they cannot\nput their . . . [the conversation between Phinuit\nand {the lady sitter} apparently disturbs G.

H. talks at some length in a very\nlow voice into the hand close to his lips, G. P. writing\nbrief but appropriate replies such as \" good,\" \" I am\nvery glad,\" \"leave it to me,\" etc.}\nThe difficulty of interruption is given as a reason for not\nattempting simultaneous communication at a sitting on\nJanuary 5, 1897, recorded by Hodgson. Phinuit was using\nthe voice when G. P. interposed in writing :\nG. P. H. I have several messages for you before I go\u2014if\npossible before the Doctor {i.e Phinuit} gets through\nR. H. Can you give these while Dr. is talking to these ladies ?\nG. P. No he interrupts me.\nThere was a curious incident on April 5, 1897, suggesting\nthat in the case of divided control one control may disturb\nthe other merely by its presence.

The manifestation of Annie D ,\nalready\nquoted (p. 33), seems to have been of this kind, and\na very clear case of it is given by Hodgson in Proceed-\nings, Vol. XIII., pp. 313-315.

From the\nrecord alone it would seem possible that there was con-\nfusion, and that G. P., intending to write, sometimes\nspoke by mistake ; in other words, that the supposed divi-\nsion of instruments (voice and hand) between the supposed\ndivision of consciousnesses (Phinuit and G. P.) was not con-\nsistently maintained. No doubt there was generally some\ndifference between G. P.'s way of speaking and Phinuit's,\nthough we are told very little about it,\n1\nbut this difference\n1\nOn April 11, 1892, Mrs. Howard records: \"We told him {G. P.} not\nto bother about it now, but to tell us at next sitting, a proposal which\nPhinuit recommended, but he himself in his gruff voice suggested '\nTheo-\nsophic' I told him no \" (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 302). Compare also\naccount of G. P. speaking on May 29, 1892 {Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 579).\n\f40 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ncannot always have been very marked, for at a sitting on\nMay 22, 1892, Mr. Howard did not at once perceive that\nthe speaker who opened the communication was G. P. and\nnot Phinuit, and the same mistake was made by both Hodgson\nand Mrs. Howard at a sitting on December 5, 1892, when\nthere was a change of control. Again, at a sitting on April\n13, 1892\u2014that is earlier than the mixed communication just\nquoted\u2014Mrs. Howard attributes to G. P. a sentence uttered\nwhile writing, which Hodgson (who was not present) thinks\nshould have been attributed to Phinuit speaking for G. P.\nThe case is instructive and I will quote it, prefacing with\npreceding portions of the record which illustrate both the\nmethod of G. P.'s entry at that time and the kind of difference\nof speech. It was the third \" G. P.\" sitting. 1\nThe recorder\nwas Mrs. Howard.\nPhintjit [speaking].

P.'s voice as distinct\nfrom Phinuit's is something of a digression. It is immaterial\nto the present argument whether the sitters were always\ncorrect in their diagnosis of who was speaking. My point\nat this moment is only that in the early days of the writing\ncontrol the speaking intelligence and the writing intelligence\nwere mutually aware of each other, and sometimes at least\nof each other's communications. Of course, in such cases\nwe have no proof that two distinct streams of conscious-\nness were at work. Both parts might be acted by one intelli-\ngence. And this is also true when two controls quarrel,\nor talk to each other. 3\nI do not think, however, that there\nis, or at any rate need be, conscious play-acting on the part\nof the trance personality, even when this possibility is not\nexcluded by actual simultaneous writing and speaking on\ndifferent subjects.\nDuring the first year of G. P.'s manifestation\u2014March,\n1892, to March, 1893\u2014he was gradually developing into an\n1\nIt was about a fortnight after this\u2014April 29, 1892 (see Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 292)\u2014that Hodgson succeeded in getting the writing done\nwith the writing pad on a table, but for a considerable time it continued\nto be at least sometimes necessary for the sitter to keep the hand steady\nby holding the arm.\n2\nThe date of this annotation is not known to us. The records of these\nearly G. P. sittings with Hodgson's original notes were lost, and he seems\nto have used the Howards' copy in writing his paper. But this copy he\ncould not obtain till the end of 1897 (see footnote to Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\np. 304).\n3\nFor examples see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 429 (in 1892), p. 575 (in\n1892), p. 500 (in 1894), etc.\n\f42 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nalmost purely writing control. He would sometimes control\nthe body and speak to the sitters, and sometimes borrow\nPhinuit's hand to write, notwithstanding the decided pre-\nference for speech expressed by the sitters ; and the amount\nof writing increased at the expense of the speaking. A\nbrief account of the sittings from this point of view will make\nthe development clear.\nIt was, I think, on April 29, 1892, 1\nthe occasion on which\nHodgson managed to get the arm to write with the writing\npad on a table, that occurred the first conversation carried\non on G. P.'s side by writing, and it seems quite possible\nthat Hodgson's action in facilitating the writing really sug-\ngested this mode of conversing. If so, we owe him a\ndebt of gratitude for promoting a method which has the\nmerit of furnishing automatically a record of the medium's\nwords, and thus is valuable for evidential purposes ;\nand in many ways for our present purposes, though it limits\nus in some respects. At this sitting there is also, I think,\nthe first hint that the head control and the hand control\nmay not always be aware of each other's communications.\nThe record says, in the middle of G. P.'s writing :\n[Phinuit wanted us to ask George if he, Phinuit, was\nhelping him.]\nG. P. Yes [we told Phinuit that George wrote yes.]\nEarlier in the sitting, while Hodgson was sharpening the\npencil, Phinuit intervened to \" spell out \" a sentence for\nG. P., the latter resuming the sentence he had been writing\nwhen the pencil was returned to him.\nOn May 14 there is speaking by Phinuit as well as writing\nby G. P., and once or twice, while conversation with the\nwriting is going on, appropriate remarks are interpolated\nby the voice (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 312-313), as\nin the passage I have already quoted above (pp. 38-39)\nfrom the sitting on May 16, though to a much less marked\nextent. 2\nOn May 17 we find G.

P. These sittings are\ndescribed and quoted from in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp.\n315-322 and 413-441, but we have the full stenographic\nreports and I use them here. At the first of this\nseries on November 22, G. P. first writes and later\nspeaks. The writing seems to come with difficulty,\nPhinuit talks about G. P., repeating the latter's remarks\nin connexion with the writing, making it evident that\nhe knows what is going on, though less evident that\nhe knows what is actually written. A considerable por-\ntion of the record of this sitting will be found in the\nAppendix (p. 352). In this and the following two sittings\nof the series (November 22, 28, 30, 1892) G. P. chiefly\nused the voice. On December 2 he wrote and then\nspoke, but changed to writing again when Mr. Marte, present\nfor the first time, came in (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\np. 420, and Vol. XV., p. 26), because, as he explained, he\nwas getting weak. On December 5 he chiefly wrote ;\nHodgson was trying to get an answer to a test question\nsent by R. T., whom he described by his initials, and at\nthe same time to get G. P. to give R. T.'s full name.\nThere was much shuffling and no success. It was only\nwhen this was over that there was a little speaking.\nPortions of this sitting also are given in the Appendix\n(p. 355). On the 7th G. P. wrote only, and on the\n9th, when Mr. Marte was again present, wrote only till\njust the end. On the 16th and 19th he spoke and wrote,\nand at the remaining four sittings of the series, December\n21, 22, and January 24 and 30, wrote only. On the\nfirst of these four days a friend of G. P.'s, Miss Vance,\nwas for the first time present and would have liked to have\nvoice communication, but G. P. could not be persuaded to\nspeak. Preference for writing when the sitters were new\nand tests were desired may have been due to the fact\nthat the slower mode of communication gave more time to\ncatch elusive ideas. But it undoubtedly also gave oppor-\n\fIf Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ntrinities of concealing ignorance by writing crucial words\nillegibly. 1\nThe fact that writing as G. P.'s habitual method of com-\nmunicating was developing in 1892 makes the records of this\nperiod important, because we may expect to find in them\nevidence about the early form of the theory of writing\noffered by the controls and may compare it with that pro-\nmulgated some years later. In 1895 G. P. asserted to Pro-\nfessor Newbold that he was not conscious of writing. For\nexample, on June 18, 1895 (see Appendix, p. 367), he says :\nG. P. It is like speaking through a * * telephone *\nW. R. N. Then how do you make a difference between writing\nand talking ?\nG. P. There seems ... is no difference to me. I only\nknow that I am writing by having been told so by\nHodgson 2\nThis view was subsequently endorsed by the Imperator\nBand and fully accepted by Hodgson, who says (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII.. p. 293) :\nIt would seem, moreover, that until instructed in some\nway, the quasi-personality that guides the writing is\nunaware that he is writing. The process from the point\nof view of the \"communicator\" {control} rather resembles\nthe definite thinking of his thoughts, with the object of\nconveying them to the sitter,\u2014and I feel very sure that\nthis is true whatever theory may be held as to the\nidentity of the '\"communicator\" {control}, whether this is\nwhat it purports to be, or merely another stratum of Mrs.\nPiper's mind believing itself to be an extraneous intelli-\ngence.\nAnd again at p. 405 :\nAfter having endeavoured as best I could to follow the\nwriting of thousands of pages, with scores of different\nwriters, after having put many incpiiries to the communi-\n1\nFor instances very suggestive ot this, see the above-mentioned\nsitting of Dee. 5, 1892 (Appendix, pp. 356-358).\n2\nWe do not possess a record of any conversation before 181)5 in which\nHodgson told G.

Nevertheless I am driven to a different con-\nclusion. For I cannot see what grounds he can have had\nfor deciding as he did, except the persistent, but not very\nconsistent statements of the controls themselves from 1895\nonwards, and possibly earlier ; and against this must be\nset the clear indications that they held a different view in\n1892, and also specific occurrences\u2014published and unpub-\nlished\u2014at the sittings which distinctly point the other way.\nTo begin with, take the first occurrence of trance writing\nunder Hodgson's observation (see above, p. 34). Phinuit\nexplained about the \" hand control :\n\" \" She has taken my\nhand away, she wants to write.\" This surely indicates\nthat both Phinuit and the writing control 1\nknew that writing-\nwas aimed at. Frequent remarks scattered through the\nstenographically reported series of sittings in 1892-3 referred\nto above, show that Phinuit knew what G. P. did with the\nhand when he had \" taken \" it ; that he knew when it\nwrote and, sometimes at least, knew what it wrote. For\nexample, on November 28, 1892 :\nPHnsruiT. George is writing that for a lady that speaks Italian.\nI can't speak it.\nR. H. Well, we can't make it out.\nOn December 16, 1892 :\nG. P. (writes).

P. also was clearly aware of writing. The passage\nquoted above (p. 41), where, on April 13, 1892, he said he\nhad not time to dot his i's, shows this. Again, on\nNovember 30, 1892 :\nG. P.

If Helen {Miss Vance} were to come and take\nthe medium's hands would you talk to her with\nyour own mouth ?\nG. P. (writing). No I want to write to her.\nLater than this, in 1894, we still find G. P. apparently\nconscious of writing. Thus on January 9, 1894, he says :\nG. P. I want to have a good talk with \"Marte\" and then I\nam done * * * But Hodgson, it won't do to stay\n\fis Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nhere always.

You mean you can't talk ?\nG. P. No, not clearly.\nR. H. You can do better in the writing ?\nG. P. Yes, I guess I can.\nOther controls similarly show consciousness of writing in\n1894. On March 3, 1894, the following conversation is\nrecorded with D. P. B. (wife of the sitter C. H.), communi-\ncating for the first time (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 507) :\nC H.

This very way by writing \u2014\nA strong reason for doubting the assertions made later\nby the controls, that they seem to themselves to be speaking\ninto an instrument\u2014as it were, a telephone\u2014which auto-\nmatically produces writing at the other end, is that correc-\ntions and other things occur in the writing which require\nthe writing process itself to be intelligently directed and\nnot to be merely mechanical ; and the intelligence directing\nit must be either the control or another intelligence inter-\nvening between the control and the material process of\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 49\nwriting Professor Newbold brings this point out well in his\nquestioning of G. P. in 1895 (see especially Appendix, p. 374).\nTaking specific instances from 1895 onwards\u2014how is it pos-\nsible to suppose that the particular method used on June\n18, 1895, to indicate the pronunciation of \"lead\" (see\nAppendix, p. 369)\u2014putting an e after the d to make the\nsitter who is reading the script understand that it is the verb\nmeaning to conduct and not the lead of a pencil that is\nintended\u2014was carried out by an intelligence unaware of\nwriting ? Again, on January 19, 1897 :\n{G. P. writes '\nannihilated '\nand Hodgson cannot read the\nword and makes various shots at it ; then :\n\u2014\n}\nG. P. anni.\nR. H. Annie something\u2014Animated\nG.

For instance, on March 30, 1897\n(see App. to Chap. III., p. 499), Hodgson records that\nGeorge Eliot wrote :\n\" distinguished gentlemen \" then \" looking \" was written\nand hand gestured to the words above for me to read it\nin its right place. I read \"distinguished looking gentlemen.\"\np\n\f50 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nCorrections are quite common. Here are two taken at\nrandom from the sitting of February 14, 1905. First,\n\"should\" is corrected to \"could\" by a c being superposed,\nand later in the sitting the record runs (control Rector,\nwriting for Mrs. H. as communicator) :\nIt took just the amount of light possessed [a slight\nhesitation] which he was [then hand turns back and\nwrites of in front of possessed and points to possessed] of.\nAnd again on July 6, 1905, \" except \" is written without\na p, the p being added over the t. Similar cases are\nrecorded in Proceedings, Vol. XXII., dealing with writing\nsittings of 1907 ;\ne.g. an erasure will be found at p. 101,\nand examples of the hand pointing to already written words\nto make the meaning clear at pages 87, 148, 335, 345.\nDrawings made in the course of writing also seem to\nshow that the communicating intelligence is conscious of\nusing a pencil or pen. Instances in 1907 will be found\nin Proceedings, Vol. XXII., pp. 153, 156, 345. And\nconsciousness of drawing is clearly shown ;\ne.g. in Proceed-\nings, Vol. XXII., p. 71, Rector having made attempts to\ndraw a triangle, says : \"I tried to draw it as he {MyersP }\nmade it.\" But drawings were made both earlier and later\nthan this. For example, on November 18, 1896, a control\nprofessing to be a little nephew of Hodgson's, wrote more\nor less baby language in capital (print) letters, and drew\nwhat purported to represent a horse and a pig. Conscious-\nness of writing seems also involved when, as Hodgson records\non March 5, 1897 (see Appendix to Chapter III., p. 496),\nhand makes movements as if trying to turn over the leaf\nwith the end of the pencil.\nWhat is difficult to reconcile with these facts and state-\nments is the theory that the writing control is a separate\nand independent spirit, taking the place of Mrs. Piper's\nspirit, which has been temporarily ousted altogether. If\nthe control was a phase\u2014a centre of consciousness\u2014of\nMrs. Piper, it is, of course, quite possible that it may have\nbeen aware of writing in 1892, but through some different\nsplitting of consciousness, due to suggestion by Hodgson or\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 51\nto some other cause, have become unaware of it in 1895,\nwhile yet some part of Mrs. Piper's consciousness was\nconducting the writing in an intelligent manner. This\nwould be the kind of thing that often happens in the case\nof negative hallucinations. A hypnotised person may have\na negative hallucination imposed upon him\u2014a hallucination\nthat some object is invisible to him\u2014and, while really believ-\ning that he does not see the object, may yet by his\nbehaviour show clearly that some part of him does see it,\nas otherwise he could not select it for invisibility. 1\nIt would be very interesting to know when and how the\nidea that the control was unaware of the process of writing\nbegan, but beyond the facts already given we have no means\nof tracing this. It is clear, I think, that G. P. knew he was\nwriting in 1892 ; that he and some other controls knew it\nin 1894 ; but that G. P. was not maintaining ignorance of\nthe process for the first time when Professor Newbold\nquestioned him in June, 1895. We know this last because\nG. P. refers to having been told by Hodgson that he was\nwriting\u2014a matter about which his memory is likely to have\nbeen correct. Such explanations by Hodgson occur fre-\nquently in subsequent unpublished sittings (1896 onwards),\nand apparently have sometimes to be given over and over\nagain at different sittings to the same control. This may\nhave helped to crystallise the idea of the supposed ignorance\nin the trance personality's mind, and may also have helped\nto put the theory into a shape acceptable to Hodgson, who\noften\u2014in my view too often\u2014corrects statements of the\ncontrol's, or gives them back in words of his own.2\nTake\n1\nFor a specific instance see Myers's Human Personality and its Survival\nof Bodily Death, Appendix to Chapter V., paragraph 546a (p. 499). The\nhypnotised person in this case is told that cards with odd numbers on them\nwill be invisible. The result is that he sees such a card when its blank side\nis presented to him, but does not see it when the side with the number\non it is towards him, to his great mystification.\n2\nThis procedure would, of course, be legitimate were we certain that\nthe control knew what he was talking about and only suffered from a diffi-\nculty in expressing it. In such a case, help in expressing it may shorten\nthe investigation while doing no harm. But if we have to answer the\nquestion :\n\" Does the control know what he is talking about, or is he merely\ntrying to conceal fundamental ignorance as well as he can ?\n\"\u2014which auto-\n\f52 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

Not the air * * the medium's arm.\nI think it is probable that if we had all the records, we\nshould find the notion that the control was unaware of writing\ndeveloping as a corollary to the notion that the spirit in\nbodily form occupied the hand and arm, which by June 18,\n1895, was so definite that G. P. explains that his head is\nin the hand, his feet at the elbow, and so forth (see Appendix\n367). The controls made no suggestion of anything of this\nkind in 1892-3, so far as we can tell from the stenographic\nreports already referred to. They do, however, say quite\ndistinctly that the writing control is not in the head, though\nthe speaking control is, and they say this in spite of the\nstatement that G. P. uses the \" brain through the hand\n\"\n(see above, p. 4G). One of the clearest instances is in the\nrecord of December 5, 1892, as follows :\n{G. P. is writing}\nR. H. I want to ask you a question George.\nG. P. Go on please R. H. You hear what I say ?\nG. P. Yes. [R. H. speaks into the ear of the medium]\nG. P. All right, that is the doctor in the medium's head and\nnot I. Yes ask your\n{After a good deal of conversation with G. P.\n(writing) and much shuffling on his part, and some\nirritation on Hodgson's, Phinuit intervenes (see App.,\np. 357)}\nPh. Why don't you speak to him ?\nR. H Well where is he ?\nmatic personalities are known often to do\u2014then clearly, in the interests\nof truth, no assistance in concealing the ignorance should be given. If\nI may say so, Professor Newbold was in this respect a better examiner\nthan Hodgson.\n\fLxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 53\nPh. Over there.\njfc sfc Jfi \u00abfc\nG. P. I don't know what you say * *\nPh. You speak to him, don't speak to me.\nR. H. Well, where can he hear that ?\nPh. He is over there by you. 1\nAgain, on January 24, 1893, Phinuit suddenly interjects :\nTalk to him there ; don't talk to me.\nAnd G. P. himself uses the same expression {e.g. on Decem-\nber 7, 1892, see below).\nBut on no occasion does \" there \" seem to mean in the\nhand as it would have done in 1896. In 1892 the hand\nis apparently conceived throughout as a hand. For instance,\non December 21\u2014G. P. writing, Phinuit intervenes :\nPh. He wants to know why you don't hold that {the hand}\nfor him then.\nMrs. Howard. We did but he slipped his hand down so slowly\n{and later in the sitting}\nG. P. Help me. Sitter. Yes, how shall I help you ?\nG. P. Hold my hand.\nThe idea of divided control and the speaking of G. P. as\n\" there \" soon led, however, at least in some sitters if not\nin the controls, to a sort of personification of the hand, as,\nfor instance, when on December 7, G. P. having written,\n\" talk to me there,\" Mrs. Howard says, \" Oh yes, the hand.\"\nThe fact that the hand not only writes but gesticulates in\na very expressive maimer 2\nwould further help to concentrate\nattention on it, and one can imagine how under questioning\nby sitters the theory, admitted by the controls themselves\nto be grotesque, of the hand and arm being occupied by\nthe spirit in the form of a small human body, might grow\nup. Other controls besides G. P. maintained it later, though\nwith some variations (see e.g. Appendix, pp. 382, 398, 427),\nand Hodgson certainly encouraged it, though probably not\n1 It may be observed that both head and hand hear the remarks made\nsometimes\n\u2014\ne.g. May 16, 1892 (see above, p. 38).\n2\nFor description see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 322.\n\f54 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\ntill after it was well established, by constantly explaining\nto new controls the supposed modus operandi.\nIt does not seem very consistent that the control occupy-\ning the hand and arm with his head in the hand, should at\nthe same time be aware that the hand plays the part of a\nhand in the ordinary way ;\nas, for instance, in handling a\npencil, shaking hands, or\u2014as in the following case on\nDecember 5, 1898\u2014in putting on a ring :\nCommunicator (through Rector as amanuensis). What have you\ndone with my (illegible) give me something, some-\nthing for James : my cap, my gloves, anything.\nYes give me something.\nSitter. I have only this ring which you gave me, you re-\nmember, [taking the ring from her finger she gives\nit * * * the right hand of Mrs. Piper seizes it\neagerly and puts it on one of its own fingers.]\nCommunicator. Yes I do, I do well and if you could only\nknow how I have changed since I met you here\nyou would be pleased I know.\nThis difficulty is, however, boldly faced on more than\none occasion, the control stating that the communicator\nuses his (the control's) head to feel something, or the com-\nmunicator (as on April 8, 1903, see Chapter V., p. 191)\nindicating a spot by getting Rector to put his head there.\nThe location of the organ of hearing for writing controls\nin the hand is part of the theory of the spirit being actually\nin the arm and hand. That the ear was in the hand was\nsteadily maintained from 1895 onwards by different con-\ntrols communicating by writing whenever asked about it\n\u2014\nincluding the Hodgson control in Dr. Stanley Hall's sittings\nin 1909 (see Studies in Spiritualism, pp. 229, 243, 251)\n\u2014\nand in accordance with this view they often held up the\npalm of the hand to the mouth of the sitter in order, as\nthey say, to hear better. Whether the living Hodgson\nbelieved that the sense of hearing was in the hand, I\ndo not know. He says in his report {Proceedings, Vol.\nXIII., p. 293) :\nIn all cases when the \" hand\n'\n' is writing independently\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 55\nof Phinuit, the sense of hearing for the \" hand control\n\"\nappears to be in the hand, whereas Phinuit apparently\nalways hears through the ordinary channel. This apparent\nheteraesthesia will be considered in Part II. of my Report.\nAnd again, on p. 398 :\nThe sense of hearing for this consciousness appears to be\nin the hand, and the sitter must talk to the hand to be\nunderstood.\nThe italicising of \" appears \" looks as if he did not\nbelieve it.\n1\nAnd it is of course almost impossible to\nsuppose it true, even if the controls really believe it.\nIt is quite possible that, without conscious acting, such a\nbelief might by suggestion produce a simulation of the\nresults. Something like crucial evidence on the subject\nmight possibly be obtained by closing the ears in such a\nway as to make hearing with them practically impossible.\nThis is no doubt a thing very difficult to do effectively. 2\nI had hoped that Dr. Stanley Hall, with the resources of a\npsychological laboratory at his disposal, might have accom-\nplished it, but he does not seem to have succeeded {Studies\nin Spiritism, p. 243).\nI have little doubt myself that successful elimination of\nthe ordinary channels of hearing would have stopped hearing\naltogether. I have never had any feeling at a writing\nsitting with Mrs. Piper that the control was hearing other-\nwise than through the ears. Nor was loud speaking neces-\nsary, as some sitters in America seem to have found. All\nthat was required was that the sitter, especially if unfamiliar\nto the controls, should speak distinctly and not too fast. 3\nThis was important, as Mrs. Piper's position was not favour-\nable for hearing\u2014her head being turned away from the\nsitter and one ear buried in pillows.\n1\nProfessor Newbold, however, is inclined to think he did believe it.\n2\nSee on this subject Sir Oliver Lodge's remarks in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIII., p. 244.\n3\nOn December 17, 1906, Rector said to Mr. Piddington, \" You may-\nspeak softly but slowly if you will for our understanding. J. 6. P. I'm\nsorry if I have been speaking too loud : I wanted to be clear. Rector.\nWe do not catch your words if they are spoken too rapidly or loudly.\"\n\f56 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nIt appears to be sometimes further claimed that the\nfingers act as organs of sight, or that they read by sense\nof touch. One such case occurred on January 18, 1899.\nHodgson was the sitter and Rector the control.\n{Hodgson tried to read aloud to the control a prayer\nsent as a message by a lady-\u2014a frequent sitter\u2014who\nwas at the time ill.}\nR. H. {reading}. \"Please help me oh ye powers of Love and\"\n\u2014can't read that next word\u2014\" make me well soul\nand body.\" [I spent a little time trying to make out\nthe word (which seems to me now quite clear),\nwhen the hand passed over the paper and lingered\nwith tips of fingers close to the word in question]\nRector, {writes}. Mercy R. H. Oh yes, Mercy.\nRector. He says it.\nThis cannot, of course, be taken as evidence of the exist-\nence of the supernormal form of perception apparently\nclaimed, because it is quite likely that the words of the\nprayer had been given either by the invalid lady, or by the\ncontrols at a previous sitting, and that consequently the\nword Hodgson failed to read was known to Rector. A\nsomewhat similar claim seems to be made by another con-\ntrol, K. F., on June 22, 1899. The sitter had taken with\nher a book of her own poems, and describes how the hand\nturned \" over the leaves-\u2014would go on and then backwards\nlooking for something ;\nfinally rested on p. 102,\" which had\na special appropriateness.\nA claim to see with the hand is implied again in sucb\nan incident as the following on March 25, 1903. The sitter\nwas Miss Bancroft, and Hodgson was also present to assist\nand record.\nG. P. enters apparently controlling and is introduced\nto Miss Bancroft.\n* * * *\nG. P. (writing). Gracie.\nMiss B. Is that the last name ? {i.e. the name the previous\ncommunicator had been trying to give through\nRector} [assent] Yes, I remember.\nG. P. She told it to me just as I came in.\n\fLxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper*s Trance Phenomena. 57\n[Hand moves about in front of Sitter's face and chest.\nI did not see this clearly as my eyes were on my\nwriting. R. H.]\nMiss B. What is it ? Something you want now ?\nG. P. No I am only looking at you just to get acquainted\nthat is all. don't mind me.\nNotwithstanding the elaboration of the theory it must\nnot be assumed that writing controls are always supposed\nto occupy the hand and arm when they write. The con-\ntrary seems to be implied, for instance, in the following\nconversation on April 26, 1897, between Hodgson and a\ncommunicator whom he calls H. C, apparently communi-\ncating through Rector. H. C. is taking part in certain\ncross-correspondence experiments about which more will be\nsaid in the next chapter (see pp. 115-118 and Appendix,\npp. 505-513), between Mrs. Piper and a medium Myers was\nsitting with in England, and has just described what she\naffirms she has written through the English medium.\nH. C. {through Rector}. I wrote distinctly this.\nR. H. You wrote it yourself ?\nH. C. Yes, I used the light\nR. H. Did you use her hand to write ?\nH. C. Yes, I placed my own hand upon hers.\nR. H. Were you conscious of writing %\nH. C. No, but I expressed the thought clearly, and the hand\nreceived it.\nR. H. Just as Rector is doing now ?\nH. C Yes, only his head is bowed down upon his hand and\nhis hand seized or seizes the hand of the earthly\nbody. This is as it appears to me.\nR. H. Thank you very much. When you thus write through\nthe other light, you do so I suppose unaided, 1\nmean unaided by any other spirit directly.\nH. C. Yes, if I understand you correctly. I did not deliver\nmy sentences to any other spirit. . . . no.\nCompare with this a description by Mrs. Piper in the\nwaking-stage of May 5, 1903, recorded by Mr. Dorr :\nRector's there ! Take him quickly ! He will let me in\n\f58 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nwhen he goes out. I can see my arm all numb ! I can\nsee his head on my hand. He has his head on my hand\nnow. He takes the ether out of it. I can see him go\ninto the air. I can see the cord on which I came in.\nHe looks like a priest\n!\nFurther, it would appear from the description given by\nMrs. H. as communicator on December 14, 1904 (see\nAppendix, pp. 431, 432), that Rector, while acting as\namanuensis, occupies the whole organism of the medium,\ntaking the place of her absent spirit. And one would have\nnaturally supposed that the same idea is intended to be\nexpressed by Rector himself when he writes of being in an\nempty shell and speaking through the holes (e.g. see above,\np. 52, and Appendix, p. 397, January 1, 1897), though\nHodgson interprets it differently.\nBefore leaving the subject of the supposed relation of\nthe control to the medium's body, it should be noticed that\nthe brain is not ignored altogether, though it would be\ndifficult to say how its function in the matter is combined\nwith the occupation of the arm as such by the control. In\n1888 Phinuit spoke\u2014rather oddly it must be admitted\n\u2014\nof the part played by the brain. It was on June 2 (see\nAppendix, p. 337) :\nR. H. You see the difference of mediumistic power as a differ-\nence in luminosity * * Can't you explain how it\nwould appear to me, supposing I investigated a\nmedium's body for the purpose of ascertaining the\ndifference in structure ?\nPh. You would see a very sensitive organism, you would\nsee a very large, peculiar, undeveloped brain ; what I\nmean to say, the brain is too large to be used by\nthe natural mortal mind of the medium.\nR. H. Do you mean there is a certain part of the brain which\nis used by the etherial organism and can be filled\nby the etherial organism of the spirit ?\nPh. Certainly.\nI have already quoted a remark by Phinuit on Decem-\nber 22, 1892, about G. P. using the \" brain through the hand \"\n(see above, p. 46) On November 30, 1892, G. P. himself\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 59\ntalks of the difficulty of expressing \" the thought through\nthe medium, through the brain of the medium, because it\nis so very material \" (see below, p. 69). Again, on\nDecember 19, 1892, G. P. writing, points out that there\nmust \" be more or less confliction between one's spiritual\nEgo or mind, and the material mind or Ego of the one\nyou are obliged to use \" {i.e. the medium}, and Hodgson\npresently asks :\nR. H. What becomes of the medium during trance ?\nG. P. She passes out as your etherial goes out when you\nsleep.\nR, H. Well, do you see that there is a conflict, because the\nbrain substance is, so to speak, saturated with her\ntendencies of thought ?\nG. P. No, not that, but the solid substance called brain, it is\ndifficult to control it, simply because it is material\n. . . her mind leaves the brain empty, as it were, and\nI myself or other spiritual mind or thought takes the\nempty brain, and there is where and when the con-\nflict arises.1\n(See Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 434.)\nThese statements were made before the theory of occupa-\ntion of hand and arm by the control was formulated, but the\nbrain is also referred to later. Thus on December 11, 1896\n(see Appendix, p. 391), Doctor writes :\n[Drawing of circle.] See that, that is an empty brain.\nI will fill it with light. I have done so. I wish to use it.\nOthers wish to use it. We divide it. I use one part or\none side. Doctor somebody uses another. George somebody\nuses another. There are four sides to an ordinary light.\nFrom the supposed relation of the controls to Mrs. Piper's\norganism we may proceed to the theory of their relation\nto her spirit and with this to the theory of mediumship\ngenerally. In this connexion the word \" light \" is in con-\nstant use and, as in the passage just quoted, is used in more\nthan one sense. It denotes the medium ; and it denotes\nwhat Hodgson calls the \" peculiar energy \" through which\nthe spirits act on the material plane ; it denotes some-\n1\nCompare with this statement one on June 18, 1895, Appendix, p 367.\n\f60 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthing which the spirits provide from their world to make\ncommunication possible ;\nand^it also denotes some quality\ninherent in all persons or objects which enables the spirits\nto discern the past history of objects. The use of the word\nto denote the medium perhaps originated in a metaphor\nintroduced to explain how the spirits distinguish mediums\nfrom other men. Thus at a sitting on December 25, 1889,\nrecorded by Sir Oliver Lodge, the Gurney control says :\nOne can tell a medium. She's like a ball of light. You\nlook as dark and material as possible, but we find two or\nthree lights shining. It's like a series of rooms with\ncandles at one end. Must use analogy to express it.\nWhen you need a light you use it, when you have finished\nyou put it out. They are like transparent windows to see\nthrough. Lodge it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle to us here in\na way though we understand it better than you. I work\nat it hard. I do. I'd give anything I possess to find out.\nI don't care for material things now, our interest is much\ngreater. I am studying hard how to communicate ; it's\nnot easy. But it's only a matter of a short time before I\nshall be able to tell the world all sorts of things through\none medium or another. (See Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 516,\nand Vol. XXIII., p. 151.)1\nThe expression was in use before 1889 and very likely\nfrom the beginning of Mrs. Piper's mediumship, though we\nhave no record of it. When Hodgson was questioning\nPhinuit about theory in 1888 a good deal was said about\nlight, Thus on May 26, 1888, Phinuit said :\nThere are spirits wandering round here trying to find\ntheir friends and the medium is given them for light.\nThey see this fight as I see the light of the medium.\nAnd on June 2, 1888 :\nPh. They {bad spirits} are attracted by certain lights, can\nsee dim lights in the body just as I can.\n* * * *\n1 I have quoted more of this passage than is required for my present\npurpose, because it is interesting as coming from the Gurney control, of whose\nhistory I shall have something to say later (see Chapter VIII., pp. 301-305).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 61\nR. H. What is the explanation of mediumistic power ?\nPh. Effervescing light.\nCompare also Appendix, pp. 341, 347, 348, for instances\nof the use of the word in 1888.\nIn 1892 we find G. P. talking of light. Thus, when asked\non November 30 (see Appendix) how he found the medium\nout, he says :\nG. P. It was by light, light alone ; to me her body was\nlight. 1\nOn December 5 G. P. proposes to answer questions on\nanother occasion \" before Old Phinuit uses up all the light.\"\nOn December 9 Phinuit complains that \" the light \" was\n\" not so good as it is sometimes,\" and G. P. also says\n\" this light is weak \" ; the difficulty on this occasion\nbeing apparently due to Mrs. Piper's ill health (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 428).\nIt is in a somewhat different way that Phinuit speaks of\nlight on January 24, 1893, when he says :\nAfter leaving the material body the body is like vapor,\nas it were, and then it is like light, composed of etherial\nsubstances, just as light (heat) inhabits your body now,\nor your body inhabits {interruption here}\nIn this passage it seems to be not mediumistic \" light \" that\nPhinuit alludes to, but the \"etherial body\" which spirits\nare supposed to have, and which is regarded as like light\nthrough a confusion between light and luminiferous ether.\nThere are in the records of sittings published by Hodgson\none or two scattered references to '\"light,\" and the diffi-\nculty of going into trance or giving a proper sitting because\nthere is \" no light,\" but it was on the unpublished records,\nespecially doubtless those of Professor Newbold's sittings\nin 1895 and of his own with the Imperator Band in 1896-7,\nthat Hodgson relied when he wrote the following precis\nof the theories of the trance personalities (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 400) :\nThe statements of the \"communicators\" {i.e. controls} as\nto what occurs on the physical side may be put in brief\n1\nBut compare context, Appendix, p. 355.\n\f62 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\ngeneral terms as follows. We all have bodies composed of\n\" luminiferous ether \" enclosed in our flesh and blood\nbodies. The relation of Mrs. Piper's etherial body to the\netherial world, in which the \" communicators \" claim to\ndwell, is such that a special store of peculiar energy is\naccumulated in connection with her organism, and this\nappears to them as \"a light.\" Mrs. Piper's etherial body\nis removed by them, and her ordinary body appears as a\nshell filled with this \" light.\" Several \"communicators \"\nmay be in contact with this light at the same time. * * *\nIf the \" communicator \" gets into contact with the\n\" light \" and thinks his thoughts, they tend to be repro-\nduced by movements in Mrs. Piper's organism. * * * Upon\nthe amount and brightness of this \"light,\" cceteris paribus,\nthe communications depend. When Mrs. Piper is in ill\nhealth this \"light\" is feebler, and the communications tend\nto be less coherent. It also gets used up during a sitting,\nand when it gets dim there is a tendency to incoherence\neven in otherwise clear communicators. In all cases, com-\ning in contact with this \" light \" tends to produce be-\nwilderment, and if the contact is continued too long, or\nthe \"light\" becomes very dim, the consciousness of the\ncommunicator tends to lapse completely.\nThis precis as far as it goes corresponds I think broadly\nwith the statements most frequently made by the controls.\nBut it is a simplification, and in simplifying contradic-\ntions, incoherences, and impossible pseudo-scientific state-\nments are omitted, which when taken together seem to me\nto show that no authority whatever can be attached to\nthe theories put forward. I think that most people will\nagree with this view, if they will take the trouble to read\nthe copious extracts given hi the Appendix to this chapter\nfrom the records of Professor Newbold's sittings in 1895,\nand from those held for the purpose of questioning the Im-\nperator band in 1896-7, as well as sundry remarks extracted\nfrom later sittings. It is not worth while attempting any\nfull analysis of the various statements made, but some of\nthem may be mentioned.\nWe are told that the etherial body is \" light, luminiferous\n\flxxi.] Psychologij of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 63\nether \" (Appendix, p. 366) ; that light consists of etherial\nand spiritual substance (p. 388) ; that it is spirit force drawn\nup by the spirit of the medium from the spirit world where\nthe whole atmosphere is light or spirit (p. 394). We are\ntold that the medium's body is like a fountain or large reser-\nvoir which becomes filled with light, i.e. the etherial atmos-\nphere of the spirit world (pp. 398, 417, 418, 422) ; that when\nthe control first enters the medium the light burns brightly,\nbut after a short time begins to expire (p. 413) ; fresh\ncurrents may, however, apparently be received during a sitting\n(p. 403, 428) ; and controls draw constantly the etherial\nstrength from the spirit-world while \" in the light \" (p. 422) ;\nexperienced controls may advantageously intervene \" to give\na clear light \"\n(p. 383). There may at some moments be too\nmuch light (p. 411) ; and an unduly short sitting may have\ndrawbacks because of the difficulty of removing from the\nbody of the medium etherial light which had not been used\nup (p. 436) 1\n; the light used up at sittings is, however,\nreplenished by the medium drawing fresh supplies from the\nspirit world in the intervals between the sittings (pp. 392,\n394, 395). Mrs. Piper's mediumship is due, we are told\nin 1896, to her body being inhabited by two distinct lights\n\u2014her normal spirit and the light of Phinuit\u2014the result being\na kind of storage battery (p. 389). The light within the\ncontrol uses the light within the hand as a telephone (p. 370).\nThe control follows the light and uses it as one would a type-\nwriter, only thoughts act instead of fingers (p. 367). A\ncontrol loses its grasp of the light as the sitting comes\nto an end (Appendix to Chapter III., p. 443). The\nlight is improved by keeping away all evil or outside\ninfluences (Appendix, p. 400), and \" the moie disturbing\nelements \" {in the form of unfamiliar sitters}, \" the lower\nburns the light \" so Imperator tells us on January 25,\n1897.\nPerhaps some readers will be inclined to say here that, as\nthe processes which it is attempted to describe do not belong\nto the physical world, the description of what occurs is neces-\n1\nWith adequate warning, however, this difficulty can be avoided appa-\nrently. \" Give us a few moments warning {before stopping} so that we\nmay change the light so as to do no harm as we remove it.\" Feb. 25, 1907\n\f64 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nsarily metaphorical, and that we cannot expect complete\ncoherence and consistency in metaphor. I think it is true\nthat the idea of light was at first used metaphorically, but\nas it was elaborated under questioning the metaphorical\ncharacter soon disappeared, and the warmest defenders of\nthe Imperator Band will hardly maintain that they intend\nto speak metaphorically when they commit themselves to\nstatements about the chemical composition of the etherial 1\nor spiritual body. It is composed, says Imperator, on\nFebruary 5, 1897 (see Appendix, p. 406), of air, light, and\na large amount of hydrogen, which is the lightest of any-\nthing known to them. When Hodgson demurs to lumini-\nferous ether consisting of air or hydrogen, Imperator says\nit is not the air or hydrogen of our planet and of our crude\nsciences, but their air and hydrogen, and he ultimately\nsubstitutes vacium\u2014one feels inclined to ask if there is any\nconnexion between vacium and vacuum\u2014for hydrogen.\nVacium is a body thoroughly spiritualised and pure, a part\nof God. It is still more surprising to learn on February 6,\n1897 (p. 408), that the spiritual body is composed of love and\nwisdom ; that love is a substance purer, lighter, higher and\nmore real and exquisite than anything else known to mortal\nman ; that it is truth, purity and sincerity\u2014and that the\nchief substance is vacium, known as love. The spirit of\nlove is real spiritual ether. Hodgson at this point sees a\nway out of the maze, and suggests to Imperator that what\nhe means is that from the idealistic point of view \" ether\nis the shadow, the representation on the material plain, the\nphysical analogue, of love,\u2014which is the real thing.\" But\nI do not think that most people reading the record will believe\nthat Imperator meant anything of the kind. To me it\nseems obvious that he was talking nonsense about what he\ndid not understand, exhibiting crass ignorance of elementary\nfacts of chemistry and physics, and a complete absence of\ngrasp of any distinction between qualities of mind and\nmatter (see Appendix, February 1, February 5, February 6,\n1897). 2\n1\nHodgson tells us (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 56) that it was from him\nthat the^controls^first acquired the terms etherial and etherial body.\n2\nHodgson, of course, saw the absurdity of much that is said by the various\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 65\nIn connexion with the various descriptions of the con-\ntrol actually occupying the medium's body, or grasping the\n\" light,\" must be considered statements of a somewhat\nbewildering kind which occur from time to time relating to\nits varying distance while controlling. I do not refer to\nsuch statements as that attributed to G. P. by Hodgson\nat the end of 1893 (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 323), \" that\nhe was going '\nfarther away '\nand would not be so available\nfor tests, but that he would continue to assist as far as pos-\nsible, and help any '\nstragglers ' to communicate \" ; for\nthis might only mean that he was less in touch with this\nworld than he had been 1\nand that his memories were less\nvivid. But it does not seem possible thus to interpret the\nfollowing assertion of increasing distance on January 16,\n1897. Hodgson had proposed to G. P. that he should at\nonce communicate through a medium Myers was sitting with\nin England, through whom George Eliot purported to com-\nmunicate,2\nand that he should enquire of George Eliot about\nthe matter. Accordingly he proposes to depart :\nG. P. Do you not see that I am getting farther and farther\naway [the writing has been fainter and more\nautomatic 3\nduring the last few sentences] and I will\ndo this errand for you at once.\nR. H. Is the light burning low ? [Hand speiring.]\nG. P. Pardon. R. H. Is the light burning low just now ?\ncontrols as well as we do, but he explained it to his own satisfaction by\nattributing it to defects in Mrs. Piper as the machine they have to use in\ncommunicating by voice or writing. If, however, the machine introduces\nsuch hopeless confusion into what they say, their communications seem\nto lose all value.\n1\nCompare Chapter III., p. 81, for a statement by Rector on April 23,\n1897, about G. P. having gone further from earth and being therefore less\nreliable for tests.\n2\nSee Chapter III. below, p. 115.\n3\nBy \" automatic \" in this connexion Hodgson means, I think, less\nenergetically controlled. When a sitting was drawing to a close the writing\nfrequently became very feeble and straggly during the last sentences, owing,\nas was explained, to the weakness of the control or the failure of the supply\nof light, and Hodgson describes this as becoming dreamy and automatic.\nHe also uses this expression about a feeble voice in speaking (see below,\nChapter VI., p. 213).\nE\n\f66 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nG. P. ... low. Eliot R. H. George Eliot ?\nG. P. there H. [Hand points] taking my light.\nR. H. Has she a message for me ?\n{George Eliot gives a message, apparently through G. P.}\nAgain, with good will we can interpret metaphorically\n\u2014as not really referring to space\u2014Rector's statement on\nMarch 3, 1897, that\nWe are very much nearer now than you think, yet we\nwill always be some distance from you.\nOr, on March 11, 1897, that\nWe are not near to your planet.\nAnd\nI have one {i.e. Imperator} who will stand by me and\nrender me assistance when necessary. I know of no one\nmore competent to do so than he. Yet when he actually\nreturns here he is not so near as I.\nBut actual space must surely be referred to in the follow-\ning dialogue on December 12. 1896 :\nR. H. {speaking to Imperator}. Are you present, close, or far\noff, guiding ?\nImperator (writing). I am present in space near thee.\nR. H. Like George or Moses when they are here talking to me ?\nImperator. Yes, yet not quite so near.\nAnd again, Imperator's explanation on February 5, 1897,\n(see Appendix, p. 407), of why his writing is always very\nfaint\n\u2014\" It cannot be otherwise. I am not so near\nyour planet as are some others \"\u2014can hardly be intended\nmetaphorically ; unless indeed the faintness of the writing\nis itself a mere symbol\u2014a very inconvenient symbol for\nthe sitter.\nIn the following case actual space, namely the distance\nbetween Boston and Mexico, seems to be taken account of\nby Phinuit. On November 24, 1896, he was by way of\nhaving started for Mexico when Hodgson called him back.\nHe calls him \" several times before he answers. He says\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 67\nhe was nearly there, i.e. Mexico.\" 1\nAnd presumably it is\nalso actual distance in space that he refers to on December\n5, 1896, when he explains unusual delay in answering to\nHodgson's call at the beginning of a sitting by saying, \" When\nyou first speak to me I'm very far away. Your voice\nseems a very long way off.\"\nWe shall have to consider the question of the supposed\nposition of communicating spirits in space again in con-\nnexion with communicators in Chapter V. (pp. 168-172) ;\nI will therefore only add here that sometimes a subjective\nview of distance\u2014differing for spirits and for mortals\u2014is\nsuggested. Thus Phinuit on June 22, 1895, says of the place\nwhere he found Stainton Moses, \" It would be a long way\nto you Billie, but not so far to me \" (Proceedings, Vol.\nXD7., p. 37), and again, Imperator, when speaking of the\ncanopy of heaven, the etherial veil or canopy which\nseparates the spirit world from ours, says on February 11,\n1897, in reply to Hodgson, that it would seem to us\nmillions of miles away from the earth, but to spirits\nit seems near (see Appendix, p. 411). On the other\nhand, Doctor affirms on February 2, 1897, that the spirit\nbody is of the same size and shape as the mortal body\n(see Appendix, pp. 403-5), though, in maintaining this he\nhas, in answer to Hodgson's questioning, to modify the theory\nabout the writing control occupying the arm as described\nby G. P. (see Appendix, p. 371).\nSo far we have been considering the alleged processes of\ncontrolling as they affect the controls. They have also\nto be considered in relation to the spirit of the medium*\nAll controls agree that she goes out of the body and they\ncome in, but beyond this there are considerable variations\nof statement at different times. The earliest account we\nhave, I think, is in Hodgson's stenographically reported\nexamination of Phinuit on June 2, 1888 (see Appendix,\np. 337) :\n1 At this time Phinuit, G. P., W. Stainton Moses, the Imperator Band,\nJulius Csesar, and others are engaged in trying to find a young man lost\nin Mexico (see below, p. 112). There were many affirmations of seeing him,\nbut no ultimate success.\n\f68 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nPhintjit says :\n\u2014\nWhen I come here, the medium passes into the spirit\nas it were. The medium's etherial organism goes\nthrough the spirit world;\nor various parts of the\nspirit world ; she wanders about like a spirit * * *\nShe takes my place as it were in the spirit world.\nWhen I begin to leave the medium * * * she begins to\nreturn and she gets nearer to me. I can actually\nsometimes, when I am here, see the medium. * * *\nSitter. How does she know {you are leaving the organism ?\n}\nPhinuit. Because she lingers in a certain sense near me.\nPhinuit's perception of the medium's spirit at what was\nprobably an earlier sitting than the above is incidentally\nmentioned in Hodgson's first report. He was experimenting\non Phinuit's success in describing the writers of letters placed\nin his hand, and says (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 24, footnote) :\nI asked Phinuit whether the writer of this second letter\n{viz. Mrs. Piper herself whom Phinuit had given a fair\ndescription of, but not named} was \"in the body\" or\n\" in spirit.\" He replied at once, \" In the body \" but\nadded :\n\" Why no ; that's curious. There she is in the\nspirit, talking to an old lady.\" This appeared to bewilder\nPhinuit, who, after some soliloquising and mumbling, went\non to another subject. Several times at the close of later\nsittings he referred to the \" medium \" as \" coming back,\"\n\" laughing,\" \" asking questions,\" \" trying to touch the\nsitter,\" etc.\nA similar incidental reference occurs in Sir Oliver Lodge's\nreport (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 516). At the beginning\nof a sitting on Christmas day, 1889, Phinuit said :\nCaptain {his nickname for Sir Oliver Lodge} do you\nknow that as I came I met the medium going out,\nand she's crying. Why is that ?\nO. J. L. Well the fact is she's separated from her children for\na few days, and she is feeling rather low about it.\nIn 1892 very similar statements were made. Thus on\nNovember 30 :\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 69\nR. H. Do you get right into the body of the medium George ?\nG. P. (speaking). The medium's spirit, her etherial, leaves the\nbody with the exception of a thread, and I take\nthe body as she leaves it.\nR. H. Your etherial goes in ?\nG. P. Just the same. Now I cannot talk to you, I could not\ntalk to you independent of a medium as I talk to\nyou now, but it is very trying, it is wearying to me\nand it is most difficult to express the thought\nthrough the medium, through the brain of the\nmedium because it is so very material.\nOn December 16, 1892, Hodgson says to Phinuit :\nR. H. Don't tire the medium out. You must not stay too\nlong.\nPh. I am going out when I get ready.\nR. H. The medium don't like to be too long in trance.\nPh. I don't care. Well, let her show up if she wants to\ncome out.\n{Presently, after saying au revoir, Phinuit exclaims :\n}\nPh. Oh, that is the medium. {Trance ends.}\nOn December 19, 1892, at the end of the sitting, Phinuit\nsaid :\nPh. Here comes the medium. She has got an ugly scowl on\nher.\nR. H. What for ? Because you kept her body too long ?\n[Medium comes out of trance.]\nOn January 24, 1893, there is a still more dramatic account\nof the return of the medium :\nPh. Who is that lady there ? Oh, here comes the medium.\nThat is the medium.\nMes. Howard. Are you and the medium good friends, or do\nyou quarrel ?\nPh. To tell you the truth, I don't care much about her.\n{at this point the hand makes characters of the deaf\nand dumb alphabet 1\nwhich no one is able to read\n\u2014\n1 \" Laura Bridgman \" rather often intervened at this period and attempted\ncommunication in what seemed to resemble the deaf and dumb alphabet.\nFor further particulars, see p. 113.\n\f70 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthen tries to write, spelling words backwards, after\nwhich Mrs. Howard asks}\nMrs. Howard. Doctor, are you trying to get your hand back ?\nPh. I am going out ;\ngive it here. Look at the medium,\nbeen sitting there waiting for me half an hour.\nIn all these cases, notwithstanding the thread mentioned\nabove (p. 69), the medium's spirit seems to be conceived\nas moving about freely among other spirits, approaching\nthe control when she wished to, as other spirits did, and\nthen visible to him ; also as exercising more or less free\nwill about leaving and returning to the body. Later, more\ncompulsion is suggested. For instance, on June 15, 1895,\nProfessor Newbold reports Phinuit as saying that when he\nturns the medium out he goes into her body on a string.\nOr, again, on December 8, 1896, Doctor talks of controls\nseizing the spirit of the medium and pulling her out of the\nbody, and then walking in (see Appendix, p. 388), and on\nDecember 11, of her spirit \"being removed\" (see Appendix,\np. 392, and compare also Appendix, p. 410, February\n6, 1897). Persuasion rather than compulsion, however, is\nspoken of on March 31, 1897 (see Appendix, p. 414), and\nprobably it is intended to represent this as what normally\noccurs. The free wandering while away from her body\nspoken of above seems to be denied in later accounts. It is\ndifficult, e.g. to reconcile it with MyersP 's account on March\n20, 1901, of the medium's spirit blocking up the doorway\nbecause it cannot be removed beyond it without breaking\nthe cord (see Appendix, p. 419), or with the clergymen\nof Mrs. H.'s account on June 3, 1903 (see Appendix,\np. 427), who hold the medium's spirit in one place all the\ntime that communications are going on. Notwithstanding\nthis, however, the old freedom seems to be indicated by\nmany of Mrs. Piper's waking-stage remarks, as we shall\nsee in Chapter VI. For instance, on December 24, 1906,\nshe said in the waking stage :\nI met Dr. Hodgson walking in the garden and I was\ntaking a message for him ; and then Myers came and\ninterrupted him ; and then I came down and down on a\ncord, and then I felt a pain here (rubbing solar plexus).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 71\nThe cord or string mentioned several times above is an\nimportant element in the descriptions of the process of con-\ntrolling, performing apparently three functions. It main-\ntains the connexion between the wandering spirit of the\nmedium and her body ; it serves as a sort of Jacob's ladder\nup and down which spirits pass between earth and heaven ;\nand it serves as a kind of telephone wire by means of which\ncommunicators convey what they have to say to the con-\ntrol. The first function is the one we hear of earliest. I\ndo not know when the idea first emerged, but I think the\nearliest mention of which we have any record was on June\n9, 1888 (see Appendix, pp. 342-6), when Hodgson and Phinuit\nwere discussing the possibility of another spirit taking pos-\nsession of the medium's body while she is asleep and her\nown spirit wandering. Phinuit talks of the latter \" holding\non to the brain,\" \" clinging to the brain,\" and Hodgson\ninterprets this as done through a \" chain of communica-\ntion,\" \" a chain that binds the etherial organism with the\nmortal body \"\n(p. 343), \" a thread \" (p. 344), \" a thread\nof connexion between A. and A.'s body \"\n(p. 345). Phinuit\nmakes no objection to Hodgson's description, but whether\nit represents his own idea we have no means of knowing.\nThere is, however, no doubt that in 1892 G. P. affirms\nthe existence of the connecting thread or cord (see above,\np. 69), and also in 1895 (June 18, 1895, Appendix,\np. 366) ;\nand, prompted by Hodgson, Imperator speaks of\nthe cord in this sense, February 6, 1897 (see Appendix,\np. 410). It is, however, difficult to reconcile the existence\nof this thread with the difficulty of findhig her body, which\nMrs. Piper complains of in the waking-stage of April 3,\n1897 (see Appendix to Chapter VI., p. 561).\nThe use of the cord as a path for spirits is apparently\nnot realised by G. P. when he says on June 14, 1895,\nthat he comes to earth without any inconvenience, \" seems\nlike flying \" (see Appendix, p. 365). Phinuit, however, on\nJune 15, 1895 (as we saw, p. 70), speaks of going into\nthe medium's body on a string ; and the idea is a good\ndeal elaborated afterwards. Curiously enough the first\ndescription in detail we have of the cord from this point\nof view is in a dream of Mrs. Piper's when hi on February\n\f72 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\n22, 1896 (see Appendix, p. 380). This is the only dream\nof Mrs. Piper's of which I have seen any record,1\nand it\nis interesting as bringing in controls and communicators\nwho were at that time figuring in her trance, and also as fore-\nshadowing to some extent future trance communications\nabout going out and in on the cord, and the cord being like\na ray of light, \" similar to a ray of light from the sun\nthrough a knot hole,\" described again by Mrs. H. (as com-\nmunicator) on December 14, 1904 (see Appendix, p. 432).\nSimilar descriptions may, however, have been given pre-\nviously at sittings of which I have seen no record. The\nsame sort of idea is probably behind Mrs. Piper's descrip-\ntion in the waking-stage of November 13, 1896 :\n\" They\ntook me out and brought me back, and when I came back\nI slid down a rope and I thought I would be caught before\nI got here.\" Mrs. Piper very frequently speaks in waking-\nstages of coming down on a rope or cord\u2014at any rate in\nthe later years of her mediumship.2\nDoctor, however,\nwhen he gives descriptions of the process of controlling on\nDecember 5 and 8, 1896 (see Appendix, pp. 383-388), seems\nindependent of any cord, and Imperator refers to none in\ndescribing, on December 15, 1896, how spirits approach the\nmedium; nor does Rector on January 1, 1897 (Appendix,\np. 397), though in all these cases the amount of detail\ngiven renders it strange that the cord as a path of egress\nand ingress should be omitted. Imperator, however, on\nFebruary 11, 1897, speaks of the spirit of the medium\nentering the spirit world, through the canopy dividing\nearth from heaven, by a thread (Appendix, p. 410).\nThe fullest accounts of the cord in this Jacob's ladder\naspect are those referred to above, given by Mrs. H. (as\ncommunicator) on June 3, 1903, and December 14, 1904.\nAccording to these accounts the cord which comes from\n1\nUnless, of course, we regard the trance, or waking-stage experiences\nof Mrs. Piper as in some sense dreams. The dream of February 22, 1896,\noccurred during ordinary sleep, and differed from the waking-stage or trance\nexperiences in being remembered.\n2\n1 think it does not occur in the records of waking-stages (which are\nnot very numerous) before November 13, 1896, nor again after this till the\nend of 1898. On January 13, 1899, she said in the waking-stage, \"Do you\nknow what I was doing ? I came down a long way on a string.'\"\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 73\nthe other world is made for the purpose each time 1\nand\nis specially attached by Rector to the medium's body.\nCompare also the account given by a spirit friend of\nMiss A. M. R.'s on May 24, 1904 (Appendix, p. 429).\nSometimes we are told there is a difficulty in attaching the\ncord; e.g. on February 24, 1904 (Appendix, -p. 428). It also\nis stated on various occasions, e.g. May 25, 1904 (see Appen-\ndix, p. 430), that it is one of Rector's functions to hold the\ncord at the medium's end while the trance lasts. To com-\nbine this with repeating to the sitters what communicators\nsay is stated to be one of the great difficulties he experiences\nas a control. Compare also the extract from the record of\nDecember 20, 1904, in the Appendix, p. 435.\nIt does not appear that the arrangements for the ladder\nare always as elaborate as those described by Mrs. H., for\nit is recorded by Miss A. M. R., who was the sitter and\nrecorder on June 21, 1905\u2014a voice sitting\u2014that Rector\nsaid that the spirits of deceased friends\nreturn to earth under various conditions\u2014possibly\nthrough lights, independently of lights, in their own\nspheres, and they pass over certain what we call spiritual\ncords to the earthly life, and reach thy spirit, and they\nguard that, and when thou dost feel impressed\u2014etc.\nI am not sure that the conception of the spirit of the\nmedium using the cord as a kind of ladder is consistently\nheld, for some of her waking-stage remarks seem rather to\nsuggest that she is let down by the cord. For example, on\nMarch 18, 1907, she says :\n\" I thought I was on a rope on\nthe end of it coming down very fast.\" But, on the other\nhand, the two ideas seem to be mixed on March 13,\n1907 :\n\" I thought I was up on a rope and I was sliding\ndown and I tried to get on the end of the rope and I\ncouldn't.\"\nThe third use of the cord ;\nas a kind of telephone\nor telegraph wire, is also described on June 3, 1903\n(Appendix., p. 427), as follows :\n1\nBut compare the view of Hodgson,, on July 31, 1911 (Appendix to\nChapter III., p. 514) about the permanent injury done to the cord by Dr.\nStanley Hall's experiments.\n\f74 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nMrs. H. {communicating through Rector}. I hear over the cord\nat which he {Rector} is at its end.\nR. H. And my voice travels to you on the cord ?\nMrs. H. Yes if it were not for this I could not U.D. you.\nR. H. And how does your thought reach Rector ?\nMrs. H. It reaches him over the cord also it vibrates to him,\nand he speaks it to you.\nIt is doubtless this use of the cord that Sidgwickp, com-\nmunicating through Rector, speaks of in some detail on\nFebruary 19, 1902 (see Appendix, p. 420). And the\nspeaking of communicators over the cord is frequently men-\ntioned, at any rate after this date (cf. also February 23,\n1904, quoted in Chapter V., p. 164, and May 24, 1904,\nAppendix, p. 429). It is perhaps the idea of a telephone\nor telegraph wire that leads Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage\nof November 20, 1905, to talk of the cord as a wire :\nWell I thought I was on the string. I thought I was\non a\u2014on a wire\u2014on a wire cord\u2014what would you call it ?\na wire cord\u2014not a wire cord but a wire. (See Appendix to\nChapter VI., p. 597.)\nOr a tube, as on February 4, 1903 :\nI was drawn in . . . like being drawn in on a tube . . .\non a cord. (See Appendix to Chapter VI., p. 590.)\nWhether or not the cord stands for any real element in the\nprocess of controlling and communicating, it is certain, I\nthink, that the idea develops in various ways, and that\nit does not represent anything of which controls and com-\nmunicators were necessarily and always aware.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 75\nCHAPTER III.\nIndividual Controls.\nFrom the consideration of control in general and the\ntheories as to its nature offered by the trance personalities,\nwe now proceed to discuss particular controls, and to\nconsider how far their claim to be personalities inde-\npendent of Mrs. Piper is made out.\nThe supposed controls may be divided into two groups\n\u2014\nprivate controls who control for their own friends whom\nthey knew on earth, and those which we may call for\nconvenience public or official controls.\nAs regards private controls, we have a good deal of\nevidence about Miss E. G. W.'s friend T. (see Proceedings,\nVol. VIII., pp. 28 et seq.), and some about Miss A. M. R.'s\nfriend H. {Proceedings, Vol. VIII. , pp. Ill et seq.), kindly\nfurnished by those ladies. We know that Hodgson's\nfriend \" Q.\" acted as control, and I believe that this was\na very important factor in the experience that convinced\nhim of the reality of communication from the dead. He,\nhowever, published very little about her as control ; it\nwas as a communicator through Phinuit that she gave\nthe important evidence of identity of which Hodgson tells\nus in Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 66-67. Under the head\nof private controls I may also mention the Gurney con-\ntrol, to which I shall have occasion to refer in Chapter\nVIII. Some of the most successful communicators occa-\nsionally manifested as controls for a short time, e.g. the\nbaby Ruthie (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 385) and Bennie\nJunot [Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 425).\nTwo observations may be made about private controls.\nThe first is that the evidence of identity may be con-\n\f76 Mrs. Henry Sictgwich. [part\nvincing to the friends to whom they manifest themselves,\nbut of a kind which is incommunicable to readers of the\nrecords. These may have to be content with the sitter's\nstatement that the resemblance to his or her friend was\nstriking. The other observation is that it is not always\nclear that the friend when professing to control is doing\nso entirely independently of, e.g. Phinuit or Rector. Miss\nA. M. R.'s friend H. definitely admitted Phinuit's assist-\nance (see Proceedings, Vol VIIL, p. 113). It must be\nremembered, moreover, that the line is by no means always\nclearly marked between controlling (direct communication)\nand communicating through a control acting as inter-\nmediary. 1\nPartly because public or official controls are more free\nfrom these complications and partly because taken all\ntogether there is more available material for consideration\nin their case, I propose in the main to deal with them in\nthe following pages.\nThe public or official controls perform two functions.\nFirst, they communicate on their own account, giving\nadvice or information or offering tests of supernormal\npowers. As regards advice, Phinuit and his successor\nRector were both of them very ready to give medical\nand hygienic advice or moral and spiritual advice and\nguidance, and did so with considerable effect. As regards\ntests, the official controls lend themselves to various\nexperiments and researches (for examples ' see below under\nJulius Caesar and George Eliot), and they are somewhat\naddicted to prophesying rather in the fortune-telling\nmanner, though not very successfully. 2\nThe second function\nof an official control is that of intermediary between the\nsitter and his spirit friends. There is, moreover, always\nI think some public control professing to manage the\nbusiness of communicating through Mrs. Piper, and to\ndirect and regulate the proceedings, even when not actually\ncontrolling.\nOfficial controls with these functions are usual with\n1\nCompare, e.g. the case of Dr. Thaw's friend quoted below, p. 82.\n2\nThough I have not gone into the matter statistically, I think I may\nsafely venture to say that their prophecies usually proved wrong.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 77\nprofessional mediums, and Mrs. Piper, who, as it were,\ncaught her mediumship from one of these, Mr. Cocke\n(see above, p. 9), would naturally find her automatic\nfaculty tending to develop on these lines whether spiritual\nentities, apart from herself, were concerned in the matter\nor not. But it is a fact that must not be overlooked\nthat to a subliminal self aiming at producing the effects\nshe did produce, the advantages of the particular dramatic\nform adopted would be obvious. For, in the first place,\nadvice is more impressive appearing to come from some\none other than the medium, and, in the second, less is\ndemanded from a spirit friend limited to communicating\nthrough another spirit, who may misunderstand what he\nis supposed to repeat, than from one purporting to talk\nwith the sitter directly. As a matter of fact, the\ndifficulty of this indirect communication is constantly\nadduced as an excuse for failure or confusion in the\nrecords before us. 1\nA dramatic form is, as is well known,\nreadily assumed in automatic writing and speaking, even\nwhen there is no reason to suppose an external intelligence\nat work, and, as is also known, means of facilitating its\ntask are apt to be eagerly seized by the subliminal self.\nThere is therefore no difficulty in supposing that if Mrs.\nPiper's trance personality be some subliminal centre of con-\nsciousness of Mrs. Piper, it either pretends to be, or\nimagines itself to be, a Phinuit or a Rector or a George\nEliot.\nTo decide between this and the spirit hypothesis we\nmust examine the sayings and doings of the controls,\nfind out whether the characters are consistently main-\ntained, whether there are manifestations of knowledge,\nincluding memories, which cannot be attributed to Mrs.\nPiper, or, on the other hand, defects in knowledge which\ncannot be attributed to the supposed spirit.\nAmong the public controls I will select for discussion\nand illustration, (1) as regular controls, Phinuit, G. P., the\nImperator Band, Hodgson, and Madame Guyon, and (2)\n1\nSee also a case below, p. 109, where after a failure Imperator throws\nthe blame on Rector and threatens to dismiss him as an incompetent\nintermediary.\n\f78 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nas occasional controls, Sir Walter Scott, Proctor the\nastronomer, Stainton Moses, Julius Caesar, George Eliot,\n\"Moses of old\" {i.e. Moses of the Exodus).\nAmong them the only ones who give independent\nevidence of identity are G. P. and Hodgson. One reason\nfor this is that these were private controls as well as\npublic ;\nthey met those who had been their intimate\nfriends in life, recognised them appropriately, remembered\nthings unknown to Mrs. Piper, and generally by their\nwhole maniere d'etre impressed intimate friends with their\nidentity. All this has to be discounted to some extent in\nthe case of Hodgson, on account of his being so well\nknown to the medium. 1\nBut G. P. was scarcely known to\nher at all, and the evidence set forth by Hodgson in\nProceedings, Vol. XIII., leaves little doubt that in con-\nnexion with this control there was sometimes 2\nsome\nsupernormal power at work, and further, that there is\ngood ground for supposing that the supernormal element\nwas more than telepathy from the living\u2014for supposing,\nin fact, that G. P. as a surviving entity was in some\nway concerned. But he may well have been concerned\nwithout our being obliged to believe that he \" controlled\n\"\nin the sense of finding Mrs. Piper's spirit removed from\nher body and taking its place.\nNone of the other public controls have any credentials\nat all. Of those I have named, both Stainton Moses,\nwho had not been dead three years when the control\nclaiming his name first manifested, and George Eliot, who\ndied in 1880, had living friends in England, and might,\none would think, have referred to things which would\nhave tended to convince these friends of their identity.\n1\nSee Professor William James's \" Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson\ncontrol \" in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.\n2\nI say \" sometimes \" because there are other times when the evidence\nis in my opinion not only neutral but against any real G. P. being\nconcerned at the moment at all. I may instance the effort of the\ncontrol G. P. (December 9, 1892) to converse intelligently with Mr.\nMarte on the philosophical views held by G. P. on earth (see Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XV., p. 26), and the shuffling attempts to answer, or\nrather to evade answering, a test question on December 6, 1892 (see\nAppendix to Chapter II., p. 355).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 79\nStainton Moses had even had some personal acquaintance\nwith Hodgson, and he was also confronted with another\nacquaintance who knew several of his friends, and with a\nman who had been his pupil as a boy, but he failed on\nany of these occasions to be convincing. His English\nfriends, too, sent questions to serve as tests which he would\nwhen in this world\u2014as far as can be judged\u2014have answered\nwithout difficulty, but nothing worth mentioning did he\nremember correctly. George Eliot was equally uncon-\nvincing.\nThe Imperator Band\u2014Imperator, Rector, Doctor, Mentor,\nPrudens\u2014were introduced by the so-called Stainton Moses\nas the same spirits who had inspired his automatic writing\nwhen he was alive, the writing published in his book, Spirit\nTeachings. The above names were pseudonyms, and the\nreal names claimed by these soi-disant spirits of the dead\nwere unknown to Hodgson and, at least as regards Impera-\ntor' s, had never been published. It would have been excel-\nlent evidence of supernormal knowledge if these names had\nbeen given, and it is almost inconceivable that they\nshould have been persistently forgotten either by their\nowners or by Stainton Moses. But not only were these\nnames not given, which might have been attributed to\nreticence, but a variety of other names were given with\nsolemn asseverations that they were the ones asked for, and\nothers equally wrong were apparently tentatively suggested.\nHodgson would, I think, have said that the quality of,\ne.g. Rector's communications\u2014the advice he gave, and so\nforth\u2014is so far beyond Mrs. Piper's normal powers that in\nitself it constitutes strong evidence of his independent\nexistence. Professor William James (see Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIII. , p. 3), though he \" favoured the idea of their {i.e.\nRector & Co.} all being dream-creations of Mrs. Piper,\nprobably having no existence except when she is in trance,\"\nadmitted that \"with all due respect to Mrs. Piper\" he\nfelt \" very sure that her own waking capacity for being a\nspiritual adviser, if it were compared with Rector's, would\nfall greatly behind.\" But hejj saw \" no contradiction\nbetween Rector's being on the^ one hand an improvised\ncreature * * * and his being on the other hand the\n\fso Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nextraordinarily impressive personality which he unquestion-\nably is.\" And this is surely borne out by the surprising\npowers exhibited by certain subjects in hypnotic trance.\nI cannot, therefore, count this as furnishing what I have\ncalled credentials.\nPhinuit, of whose gift for preaching Professor James\nspeaks, it may be observed, much as he does of Rector's, 1\nnotoriously failed to produce credentials\u2014so much so that\nbefore the advent of G. P., Hodgson for a long time felt\nthe most satisfactory hypothesis to be \" that of an auto-\nhypnotic trance in which a secondary personality of Mrs.\nPiper either erroneously believes itself to be, or consciously\nand falsely pretends to be, the '\nspirit ' of a deceased\nhuman being, Phinuit \" (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 57\n;\nVol. XIII., p. 286). \" Sir Walter Scott,\" \" Moses of old,\"\nand \" Julius Caesar \" could hardly be expected to produce\nevidence of identity, though somewhat more verisimilitude\nin their make-up might, I think, have been looked for.\nBut though these public controls fail to produce cre-\ndentials, they and all controls guarantee each other, as\nindeed might be expected on almost any hypothesis. They\nguarantee, that is, the reality of each other's independent\nexistence\u2014independent of each other and independent of\nMrs. Piper. They do not always guarantee each other's\nveracity or reliability. Thus, for instance, G. P. says of\nPhinuit on January 14, 1894 :\nHe is inclined to try too much at times, H., and thinks\nhe hears things when they are not close enough to him.\nHe is a mighty good fellow, but exaggerates a little\noccasionally when he is dull. Better rot tell him I say\nthis. (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 369 footnote.)\n1\nHe says in Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 654-5 :\n\" I must admit, how-\never, that Phinuit has other moods. He has several times, when my\nwife and myself were sitting together with him, suddenly started off on\nlong lectures to us about our inward defects and outward shortcomings,\nwhich were very earnest, as well as subtile morally and psychologically,\nand impressive in a high degree. These discourses, though given in\nPhinuit's own person, were very different in style from his more usual\ntalk, and probably superior to anything that the medium could produce\nin the same line in her natural state. Phinuit himself, however, bears\nevery appearance of being a fictitious being.\"\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 81\nAnd Rector says of G. P. on April 23, 1897 :\nWe would warn thee not to rely too much upon the\nstatements made as tests so-called by your friend George.\nHe is too far away from your earth now to be clear in\nregard to tests, test-conditions, etc. * * * his work in your\nfield is done * * * the conditions are such as to render it\nimpossible for him to reach you as he would like. He has\npassed beyond * * * not intentionally would he do or say\nanything, in the slightest, wrong, yet if called upon he\nmight err unintentionally.\nBut if G. P.'s statements were no longer to be relied upon\nin April, 1897, it is at any rate assumed that they were\naccurate earlier. And if the earlier G. P., who professed to\n\" control \"\u2014to take the place of Mrs. Piper's spirit in her\nbody\u2014-was all that he represented himself as being and was\ndoing all that he represented himself as doing, it seems\nimpossible that he can have been mistaken when he spoke of\nPhinuit, Rector, and the rest as being also entities inde-\npendent of Mrs. Piper. The whole thing, therefore, seems\nto stand and fall together. G. P. is our real authority for\nthere being any control by independent spirits. If the con-\nsistency either of his own personation, or of the per-\nsonation of the \" spirits \" he guarantees, breaks down, we\nare left practically without support for the hypothesis that\ncontrols are anything more than divided off centres of\nconsciousness of Mrs. Piper, personating and perhaps\nbelieving themselves to be independent spirits. 1\nBut first, to prevent any danger of misapprehension, let\nme here repeat that proof that controls are not independent\nspirits would not in my opinion even tend to show that\nthere was no real G. P. in the background, helping at\ntimes to inspire the personation of him. G. P. may thus\ncommunicate, and there may be sufficient evidence to prove\nit, without his being properly speaking a \" control.\" And\nif it be urged that so good a personation of G. P. would be\nimpossible based merely on the knowledge acquired from\nthe sitters, and telepathically from himself\u2014that telepathy\n1\nG. P. himself recognises that his credit is affected by false statements\nof guaranteed spirits (see Appendix, p. 454).\nF\n\f82 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\ncould not do as much as that\u2014I should reply three things.\nFirst, that, as I argued in my previous paper (Vol. XV.,\np. 21), it is easy to overestimate the completeness of\nresemblance required for a personation under the limiting\nconditions of the manifestation even when the voice is\nused, and still more when the personation is expressed\nonly in the words written (which are not in the supposed\ncontrol's handwriting),1\nand in the dramatic representation\nof manner through movements of the hand alone.\nSecondly, avowed communicators are often dramatically\nrepresented when there is no pretence of their controlling.\nI quoted a striking instance of this in the same paper\n(Proceedings, Vol. XV., p. 21), taking it from Hodgson's\nreport (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 567), and repeat it now\nfor convenience. It happened on May 10, 1892. It will be\nobserved that the occurrence of personation in this case is\nnot conjectural, but is asserted by the control. A friend of\nthe sitter's, Dr. Thaw, spoke in so life-like a manner through\nPhinuit that Dr. Thaw, wishins; to know whether it was\nhis friend or Phinuit who was speaking, said :\n\" Can you\ntell me anything about Dr. Phinuit ?\n\" The answer came\nfrom Phinuit\n\u2014\" I'm talking to you myself, you rascal ;\nI'm talking for him.\" \"Well,\" said Dr. Thaw, \"you're\ntrying to make us think he's talking,\" to which Phinuit\nreplied, \" I'm simply telling you what he says. I'm trying\nto imitate him.\"\nThirdly, in reply to the argument that telepathy cannot\naccount for so much, I should say that we know very\nlittle about the possibilities of telepathic communication,\nbut that whether the controls are other than phases of\nMrs. Piper or not, we have to admit for it a very wide\nscope. I am using the word telepathy, of course, in the\ncomprehensive sense in which I used it in my previous\npaper in Proceedings, Vol. XV., p. 18, and in which it is,\nI think, now very generally used\u2014in a sense wide enough\nto include any communication between mind and mind\notherwise than through the recognised channels of sense,\n1\nMr. Piddington thought an approximation to Myers's handwriting\n(which was known to Mrs. Piper) could be observed in some of the script\nof 1906-7.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 83\nwhether the minds communicating be in the body or not.\nHow, except by telepathy, are we to account for Mrs.\nPiper's recognition of a photograph of a deceased person\nknown to her only through a vision in the waking-stage\n\u2014\nsuch as the case of Mr. Marble, described by Sir Oliver\nLodge in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 275, and which,\nwith other cases, we shall have to discuss in Chapter VI.\nbelow. 1\nIt is Mrs. Piper herself, or at least some part\nof Mrs. Piper, who has the waking-stage vision and\nrecognises the photograph\u2014not a different controlling\nintelligence. A correct visual impression of the deceased\nperson cannot have reached her through her bodily eyes.\nIf she had one, therefore, it must have been the result\nof telepathy from the living or the dead.\nIt might, perhaps, be said that though Mrs. Piper\nundoubtedly does have vivid visual impressions in the\nwaking-stage, we must not assume that they are veridical\nor that the recognition of the photograph is due to one.\nThe right photograph might have been picked out owing\nto indications given unconsciously by the living persons\npresent\u2014or telepathically prompted either by the experi-\nmenters or by spirits without any previous visual impres-\nsion corresponding to it. Of course precautions were taken\non each occasion with a view to excluding these possi-\nbilities so far as living agents are concerned, but even\nif we grant their existence in the case of Mrs. Piper's\nselection of photographs, we cannot so explain the ex-\nperiences of, e.g. Cahagnet's subject, Adele Maginot.2\nHere,\nagain, there is no question of the perceiving intelligence\nbeing other than the medium\u2014that is Adele herself,\n1\nIn some of these recognition-of-photograph cases we seem to require tho\nfurther extension of the idea of telepathy to include communication\nbetween different streams of consciousness in the percipient, which Mr.\nG. W. Balfour pointed out as a probable hypothesis in his Presidential\nAddress in 1906 (see Proceedings, Vol. XIX., p. 392). For Mrs. Piper\nhas her vision in the waking-stage, and recognises the photograph in\nanother state of consciousness when all memory of the vision seems to\nhave vanished.\n2\nAlphonse Cahagnet, Arcanes de la vie future devoilis, Vol. II.\nPodmore gave some account of the man and the book in his discussion\nof Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena in Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 58-71.\n\f84 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthough Adele in hypnotic trance. Consider, for example,\nthe case No. 117 quoted by Podmore in Proceedings,\nVol. XIV., p. 61. M. du Potet asked for his friend\nM. Dubois, who accordingly appeared to Adele, and was\nminutely described as to appearance, dress, manner of\nspeaking, gestures, etc.\n\u2014\" si bien que je croyais le voir\nmoi-meme, tant le tableau en etait saisissant.\" The\napparition also answered questions correctly and with\nappropriate appreciation and behaviour. It is clear that,\nif the account given is to be relied on, Adele, if she\nwas a good mimic, might very plausibly have personated\nM. Dubois after seeing that apparition. But she did not\nsee the apparition with her bodily eyes. It must have\nbeen telepathic ; and Du Potet was inclined to attribute\nit to telepathy from himself on the ground that, as he\ndiscovered later, there were some points in the description\nwhich corresponded with his idea, but were not in fact-\ncorrect.\nWe may now proceed to more detailed examination of\nrecords concerning the public controls selected as types.\nThe history and development of the Phinuit and G. P.\ncontrols have been so fully related by Hodgson in Pro-\nceedings, Vols. VIII. and XIII., that it is needless to\ngive an account of them here. I will only remind the\nreader that Phinuit, without any formal farewell, made his\nlast appearance on January 26, 1897, ousted by the Im-\nperator Band ;\n1\nand that G. P., though he continued to\nappear from time to time almost to the end, occupied a\nsubordinate place after Imperator and Co. undertook the\nmanagement of affairs. Of the Hodgson control it is\nhardly necessary to give any long history. There will be\noccasions for incidental mention later on. Hodgson's early\nmanifestations, whether as control or communicator, are\ndiscussed in a very interesting paper by William James\n1\nIt was suggested by the Imperator Band on July 3, 1897, that they\nmight bring him back when he had made sufficient progress, but I do\nnot think he ever did reappear. His return was also offered to Sir\nOliver Lodge in 1906, but the latter did not press for it (Proceedings,\nVol. XXIII., pp. 280-281).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper s Trance Phenomena. 85\nin Proceedings, Vol. XXIII. He controlled rather fre-\nquently, writing either for himself or as amanuensis for\nothers till the end. 1\nSir Walter Scott.\nThe earliest in chronological order of the other controls\nnamed above on pp. 77, 78 was Sir Walter Scott. He had first\ncommunicated with Hodgson some time about 1894 through\nPhinuit, but we have not got the record of the occasion.\nAn interesting point about it, as we learn from a note by\nProfessor Newbold to the record of June 25, 1895, is that\nthe manifestation occurred the day after Hodgson had been\nreading Scott's Life and Letters, which had greatly interested\nhim. After laying down the book he had spent an\nhour or so smoking and thmking, with a strong personal\ninterest, of Scott. This looks as if the preoccupation of\nHodgson's mind with Scott led to his appearance. A\nsimilar apparent connexion with Hodgson's thoughts\noccurred on October 19, 1896, when the day after he\nhad been re-reading some of Stainton Moses' Spirit Teach-\nings, and, inter alia, Section VI., at the heading of which\nthe author refers to his meeting D. D. Home the medium,\na soi-disant Home controlled and wrote : \"I was with\na gentleman named Moses in the body also.\" 2\nHe wrote\nat some length, but there was little verisimilitude about\nthe control. Similarly, Madame Guyon's first appearance\n(see below, p. 123) may have been due to the fact that\nthe sitter on the occasion had been recently reading about\nher.\nSir Walter Scott's appearance as a control about a year\nlater than his first communication to Hodgson occurred\napparently spontaneously on June 25, 1895, at one of\nProfessor Newbold's sittings. He came to offer informa-\ntion about the planet Mars, which had, I gather (though of\nthis I am not sure), been a topic in his communication the\nyear before, and which had been talked of earlier in the\n1\nCompare below, Chapter V., pp. 197-200.\n2\nThis was in the middle of sittings at whicii Stainton Moses was\nmanifesting.\n\f86 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nsitting of June 25 with Phinuit, who professed to have\nfound Stainton Moses in Mars. For this part of the\nsitting, see Appendix to Chapter II. (p. 375). Sir Walter\nScott's entrance on the scene is recorded as follows ;\nHodgson and Professor Newbold were both present.\n[Hand changes. Becomes small and writes slowly]\nScott, Scott, Scott, I am extremely happy to be with\nyou sir ... I just strayed in here.\nR. H. This is Sir Walter Scott ?\nScott. Yes Sir I strayed . . . for a moment lend me your\nattention when you wish to hear anything concern-\ning Mars\u2014do not forget to call for me. I am . . .\nI have met Mr. Pelham { = G. P.} and I am\nenchanted with him intellectually.\nAfter a little further conversation he is asked to return\nthe following day. This he does, and also at six other\nsittings between June 25 and July 8 inclusive. He ex-\npresses himself in a precise and somewhat ceremonious\nway, and writes in a small, faint handwriting, signing his\nname at the end of his communication. The gestures of\nthe hand were gentle compared with those of other writing\ncontrols. The communications were concerned with ima-\nginary voyages among the planets on which he takes the\nsitter, Professor Newbold or Hodgson ; and with life in the\nspirit world. He manages, among other things, to betray\na portentous ignorance of astronomy.\nThe portions of the sittings of June 27 and 28, 1895,\noccupied by the Scott control are quoted in full in the\nAppendix to this chapter, pp. 437-448. In the course of them\nwill be found another incident tending to show telepathic\ninformation about what had passed or was passing in the\nsitter's mind (see Dr. Newbold's paper in Proceedings, Vol.\nXIV., pp. 48-49). Briefly, the control stated on June 27\nthat there were monkeys in the sun. This naturally excited\nlaughter in Dr. Newbold and Hodgson when they were\ngoing over the record of the sitting that evening, and\nthe next day the control spontaneously retracted the\nmonkeys and asked who had been laughing loudly with\nDr. Newbold over the imaginary journeys.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 87\nOne rather curious incident concerning this control's\nignorance and knowledge may be described here. On\nJuly 2, 1895, Sir Walter Scott asked Hodgson where he\nwould like him to take him.\nR. H. Have you ever been further away than the planet we\ncall Saturn ?\nScott. Further away . . . there is not a place or planet known\nto the human mind that we have not visited.\nR. H. I should like to take a trip further from the sun.\nScott. I do not understand.\nR. H. You took my friend to Saturn.\nScott. Yes Sir.\nR. H. I should like to go beyond Saturn.\nScott. I cannot catch your meaning sir. I cannot take you to\nplanets that do not exist.\nR. H. Haven't you seen a planet further away than Saturn ?\nScott. Mercury.\nR. H. I'm afraid the light's nearly exhausted Sir Walter.\nPerhaps you had better continue next time.\nIn the interval between this sitting and the next. Scott\nhas apparently made enquiries, or consulted Mrs. Piper's\nhalf-lost memories ; and Hodgson having asked the next\nday (on questions being invited to \" disentangle every\nmuddle should there be any \"),\n\" Can you tell me about\nthe planets beyond Saturn ?\n\" Scott replies, \" Oh yes,\nsir, all of them. You know they were distinguished one\nfrom another by names . . . [illegible] in Latin.\" Later in\nthe sitting an expedition to Uranus is spontaneously\noffered, and on July 5 to Neptune. The previous ignor-\nance or forgetfulness is the more curious as Neptune and\nits inhabitants turn out to be specially interesting, and\nare described at great length !\nProctor.\nOn July 1, 1895, Hodgson asked \"whether G. P. could\nhunt up Proctor the astronomer and get him to com-\nmunicate about the planets.\" G. P. is at first doubtful\nboth about the possibility and the utility of this pro-\nceeding, but gives way to Hodgson's view that Proctor\n\f88 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ncould speak of modern astronomical problems of which Scott\nmight be ignorant, and consents to try to find him. The\nresult is that a soi-disant Proctor turns up at the begin-\nning of the sitting of July 3, 1895, with a great deal of\ngesticulation representing the handling of an imaginary\ntelescope. I give the record in full in the Appendix\n(pp. 448-452). There is no astronomy in it, though there is\npseudo-science, but it has an interest for the investigator\nbecause there are some special features both about the\ngoing into trance and the beginning of the trance itself.\nIt was, so far as I know, Proctor's only appearance.\nW. Stainton Moses and his spirit guides. 1\nW. Stainton Moses, like Proctor, appeared first in con-\nsequence of a request to G. P. to bring him. This is\ndescribed, and the communications at this time of the\nso-called Stainton Moses are given at length in Professor\nNewbold's paper in Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 36-41. Pro-\nfessor Newbold's summing up (p. 41) gives the results from\nour point of view clearly, and I cannot do better than quote\nit here for the convenience of the reader.\nIn this case we have the difficulties which attach to the\nspiritistic theory brought out in the highest relief. The\ngeneral tenor of the communications, the allusion to Mr.\nSpeer, the reception of the names of Myers and Hodgson\nhave an air of verisimilitude. The communicator then\ngives us, with the most solemn asseveration of their\naccuracy and with apparent consciousness of the import-\nance of his statements to a cause which he had in life\nmuch at heart, three names which the real Mr. Moses must\nhave known and which of all possible things would seem\nto be the hardest for the spirit to forget\u2014the names of\nthe spirit friends who, as he claims, opened his eyes while\nstill on earth to the realities of the eternal life. And not\none of those names is true or has the least semblance of\ntruth ! Furthermore, of all points touched upon during the\nsitting this was the only one that was unknown to both\n1 W. S. Moses was very well known in spiritualistic circles. He wrote\nunder the nom de plume of M.A. Oxon.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 89\nthe sitters\u2014another item in favour of the telepathic\ntheory. 1\nTo my mind this failure on the part of the\nalleged Moses is an obstacle to the acceptance of the\nspiritistic theory which has not as yet been set aside\nand which must be satisfactorily explained before that\ntheory can be regarded as meeting the requirements of the\ncase.\nStainton Moses was called for again by Hodgson on\nOctober 1, 1896, the first sitting after a seven or eight\nmonths' interval, during which Mrs. Piper had been re-\ncovering from an illness which had necessitated an opera-\ntion. Hodgson said to G. P., \" Especially I want you to\nget from Stainton Moses the real name of Imperator.\"\nThe importance of this was emphasised, and G. P. pro-\nmised to get at Stainton Moses. On October 12, G. P.\nsays :\nI wish to tell you, H. I have seen Moses, and his\nthoughts are not as {clear as?} I would wish, yet I am\nhelping him and in a very short time after I have brought\nhim here several times he will speak and interpret his own\nmessages.\nMoses proceeds to communicate through G. P., com-\nplaining of a veil between him and Hodgson, and showing\nsome confusion. \" What is the meaning of all the con-\nfusion and lack of concentration of thought, I wonder,\"\nwrites G. P. for Moses, and continues as from himself to\nMoses. \" Oh, you will be clearer soon, sir. Have no\nmisgivings. I will stand by you. Oh yes, yes.\" 2\nAttempts are apparently made to give Imperator's name\n\u2014\ntwo or three suggestions being, it would seem, tentatively\nput forward, but with the usual want of success.\nOn October 14 he again communicates for a time, and\ncontinues what looks like fishing for the name of Im-\nperator. G. P. says of him, \" he is beyond me, H., and\n1\nDr. Newbold means here, of course, the theory of telepathy from the\nliving.\nz This kind of by-play is not uncommon, and is sometimes explained\nby the controls as registered accidentally. Its advantage in making\nclear the dramatic situation is obvious. For a conspicuous case see p. 39(\nJ.\n\f90 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nto draw him back is not so easy as one would think.\"\nStill G. P. promises remarkable tests through Stainton\nMoses soon, and says for him that Imperator is St. Joseph,\n\" the father of Christ \"\u2014which with other names suggested\nis again entirely wrong. The next step is that on October 16\na communicator calling himself Imperator writes through\nG. P. as amanuensis. He says : \"I am Imperator. I am\nthe intimate friend and adviser of the lamented S. Moses,\"\nand he uses Imperator's sign\u2014a cross. On October 17 he\nprophesied about the millennium (which was to come with\nthe beginning of the twentieth century) and about a great\nwar which was to precede it, involving all the great powers,\nof whose relations with each other and relative importance\nhe shows very inadequate knowledge. Hodgson, having\nlearnt from Myers that Imperator was not Joseph, speaks\nvery strongly to G. P. (on October 27, 28, and 29, 1896, see\nAppendix) about the deception involved on the part of\nboth Stainton Moses and Imperator. 1\nG. P. makes excuses.\nJoseph, he says, is a spirit who \" is called High Com-\nmander by thousands of intelligences \" in the other world,\nand thought he was meant when Imperator was asked\nfor. It is curious, on this hypothesis, that besides saying\nthat he was the intimate friend and adviser of Stainton\nMoses, he had spoken of England as the country \" in which\nI used to return so often\"; and that when Hodgson said\nhe understood that Moses \" held somewhat narrow theo-\nlogical views and that you {the communicator} led him\nout of them,\" he had replied, \" Oh yes I was deter-\nmined to do so.\" No explanation of these statements is\noffered. Moreover, it appears from the following curious\nconversation between Hodgson and G. P., after the\nfalse Imperator has gone on October 17, 1896, that the\nlatter had talked to G. P. about his communications to\nMoses.\nR. H. Have you seen much of Imperator ?\nG. P. Very little. There is one very strange thing about him,\ni.e. he is quite clear-headed, and yet I find him\n1\nHodgson was always very frank with the controls about their failures\nand false claims, their deceptions and absurdities, and his view of them.\nSome other instances will be found in the Appendices.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 91\nvery . . . [hand moves slowly about as though\nexploring in every direction.] . . .\nR. H. What's the matter ?\nG. P. I did not wish him to hear me, and I was simply\nlistening to see if he [was] present anywhere.1\nHe is\nvery anxious to make this light his, and I am not\nquite satisfied.\nR. H. He's inclined to talk about teaching and religions, etc.,\nisn't he ?\nG. P. You mean through Moses' light he was religious, etc.\nR. H. Yes, a great deal. I think his communications were\nchiefly of that type.\nG. P. Yes, he told me this, and I do not approve of a long\nRabble of Religions. Not by any means, I like\ntest-work enough sight better.\n* # * *\nR. H. Well we know our views and what we want.\nG. P. Yes, of course, only I wished you to fully understand\nmy position in the matter. This is my light and I\nam going to hold on to my own string.\nR. H. I'll back you up.\nG. P. I promised this, and I will keep my promise.\nIn the end (see Appendix, October 29, p. 457) it appears\nthat neither the real Imperator nor the real Stainton Moses\nhad been communicating so far. The real Stainton Moses\nwas present, but being confused employed his father to\ncommunicate for him. Hence mistakes. The real Moses\nis actually present with Dr. Arthur Myers, continues G. P.,\nand will now communicate through him.\nAccordingly, we get a very unplausible Arthur Myers\ncontrol, who, e.g. calls Hodgson, whom he knew well in\nlife, \" Sir.\" He gives messages on behalf of Stainton\nMoses, and then the latter \" controls \" himself. The\nrecord of part of his somewhat incoherent writing is\ngiven in the Appendix (p. 460). The incoherence is new\n;\nhe was quite coherent in 1895 (see Proceedings, Vol.\nXIV.).

[pabt\na good deal of information from Hodgson by way of\nencouragement in the form of leading questions. On the\n31st he says in answer to Hodgson that he has seen\nDoctor, Rector, and Imperator in spirit life, \" and if you\nwill ask me to come and bring them with me I will do\nso. You may put them to any tests possible. They are\nequal to any.\"\nThe assistance of Imperator and Co. is not, however,\nobtained at once. Stainton Moses controls on November 9,\n1896, without their appearing, though he again offers to\nbring them. On November 10 he writes : \"I have seen\nmy friends and they all agree with me as to the\ndesirability of proving to you just who we all are,\" and\na little later in the sitting :\nI have seen Dr., I. S. D. { = Imperator}, and Rector.\nOne would not assist. One, Rector, would not say\nanything. Doctor says he would be glad to help.\nI. S. D. says he also will be glad, and if you wish\nthey will give in their own handwriting a message\ngiving their names in full.\nR. H. I shall be delighted if they will. Can they do that\nnow ?\nW. S.

He will understand.1\nRector is accordingly fetched, but does not apparently\ntake any part in the proceedings that day. Imperator,\nhowever, says through Stainton Moses :\nImp.

Let me come first with this gentleman who is present\nnow.\nR. H. Mr. Pelham ? Imp. Yes, Sir, & I will.\nR. H. The very next time ? Imp. I will Sir.\n{To which Stainton Moses adds}\nW. S. M. Yes he will. I would tell you Mr. Hodgson, but\nsince they would so enjoy meeting you I would\nprefer they should do so.\nR. H. I leave it to your discretion. You know best.\nW. S. M. Yes. You see for years they would not tell me who\nthey were. Then after they did tell me, they would\nnot allow me to mention it to any one.\n* * * *\nThe next time I see this light burning I will mention all\nof these names. He says this * * * And he never\nbroke his word with me, and he will not with you.\n{A lot of explanation follows about the false Moses and\nthe false Imperator said to have previottsly com-\nmunicated. }\nAccordingly, at the next sitting, November 11, 1896,\nImperator controlled (see Appendix, p. 468). He prayed\nin the manner that subsequently became characteristic of\nhim, and gave a name, if not two names, but not the\nright one. His writing is very faint, and the pencil moved\n1\nAlbion House is again referred to at the next sitting. G. P. says :\n\" I went up to Albion House for him {Imperator} myself and told him\njust what you wished.\" And later again on November 17, 1896, G. P.\nsays that Imperator \" lives here in a fine old chateau \"\u2014of which\nAlbion House is presumably the name ! This kind of grotesqueness is\nnot common in the records, and it is of some interest that the surprise\nHodgson doubtless expressed in his voice did not prevent Albion House\nbeing referred to again.\n\f94 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nvery slowly. In the course of the sitting he promised to\nbring scent 1\nin time.\nOn November 13, Mentor, another of Moses's controls,\nprofessed to control, but rather unsuccessfully\u2014he chiefly\nproduced wild movements of the arm, but managed to\nwrite \" I am Mentor.\" Later in the sitting G. P. wrote :\nSay, one word, H, you have raised a rumpus over here,\nwith Moses and his many controls. They all want to be\npresent at once, and he also. Now that they have only\nfound out this light and there is no stopping them.\nStainton Moses at this sitting talked of bringing scent\n\" from our flowers here,\" but with less assurance than\nImperator had shown. \" I will try and see if I can bring\nit to you.\" After some talk about the \" Spiritualist\nAlliance \" and about Moses's Spirit Teachings\u2014subjects\nintroduced by Hodgson\u2014Moses suddenly says :\nW. S. M. Do you remember Ulysses ?\nR. H. Ulysses ! W. S. M. Yes.\nR. H. The famous Ulysses ? W. S. M. Yes.\nR. H. Of Homer ? W. S. M. Yes.\nR. H. Of the Odyssey ? W. S. M. Yes.\nR. H. The father of Telemachus ?\nW. S. M. Yes. I know him well.\nR. H. Do you remember Tennyson's poem about Ulysses,\n\u2014\n\" the weary oar \"\u2014and ending \" Beyond the utmost\nbound of human thought \" ?\nW. S. M. Yes, exactly, I do very well indeed, and he also\nremembers of having heard this read, but he did\nnot realize * * * that it was to him.\nR. H. Is he there now ?\nW. S. M. Yes, by you. Who was it that was said to have\nlaid the egg for Martin Luther.2\n1\nThe scattering of scent was a frequent phenomenon at Stainton\nMoses's own sittings, but not through the agency of Imperator. Not-\nwithstanding promises made more than once, it never occurred at Mrs.\nPiper's sittings.\n2\nThe person said to be standing by Hodgson was doubtless Mentor,\nwho definitely claimed to be Ulysses at this period\n\u2014\ne.g. on December 7,\n1896 :\n\" Yes. I am Mentor. Ulysses. I am he \" (see for further details\nProceedings, Vol. XV., p. 24). Martin Luther had been referred to at the\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 95\nR. H. I forget that expression. W. S. M. Do you ?\nR. H. Who said it ?\nW. S. M. Ulysses. He was said to have laid the\nR. H. What Ulysses ? W. S. M. Erasmus\n{Difficulties in reading intervene here}\nR.

Erasmus laid the egg.\nW. S. M. Yes. He is with me now.\nI think it will be agreed that it requires great good-\nwill not to attribute real fundamental confusion between\nErasmus and Ulysses to the control here\u2014not merely\nconfusion induced by difficulties in controlling.\nAfter some more talk and brief controlling by Moses's\nold friend Dr. Speer, by Imperator, and by Doctor\u2014the\nlatter holding the pencil awkwardly and the arm stiffly,\nand requiring instruction from Hodgson, but writing a\nlarge and heavy script\u2014Moses reappeared and the following\nconversation occurred :\nR. H. Doctor's very powerful.\nW. S. M. Always was. Rector more so if anything. Imperator\nis my idol.\nR. H. His writing is very faint. I suppose it's because he's\nfarther away from earth than they are.\nW. S. M. Yes. It is more difficult for him now than when he\nused to come to me.1\nprevious sitting (November 11, 1896, see Appendix, p. 470). This and\nsome of the other names mentioned by Mrs. Piper's controls at this period\nhad occurred in Myers's papers on the expei'iences of Stainton Moses in\nProceedings, Vols. IX. and XI.\n\u2014\ne.g. Erasmus, Grocyn, Lydgate, Louis\nNapoleon. In the script, however, we have not Louis Napoleon but Alex-\nandria Napoleon. Is this perhaps a combination of Louis Napoleon and\nAlexander Theliffsen, a name mentioned on the next page of Myers's article ?\nThe Piper Stainton Moses asserts in reply to Hodgson's query, that Alex-\nandria Napoleon is correct and will be found in his note-books. There\nhad also been a good deal in the journal Light recently about W. S. Moses'\ncontrols, but I do not know if Mrs. Piper ever saw this paper.\n1\nThis is irrelevant if it means it is more difficult for Imperator to\nwrite, for he did not profess to write himself through Stainton Moses.\nHe employed Rector as amanuensis.\n\f96 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nR. H. I suppose it's like going into a suffocating region\nlike going down a pit full of poisonous gases.\nW. S. M. Yes, as it was for me at first. I heard the voices\nof other spirits call and I gave their names to you\ninstead of my own, I suppose, from what I have\nheard you say. Too bad, but I was not aware of\nso doing.\nThese last statements were meant, of course, to explain\nhis failure in the sittings with Dr. Newbold in 1895, but\nany one referring to the account of these in Proceedings,\nVol. XIV., will find the explanation rather difficult to fit\nwith the facts.\nOn the next day, November 14, 1896, W. S. Moses\nagain appears and asks :\nW. S M. What would you have me do for you now, Mr.\nHodgson ?\nR. H. Rector has not written at all yet.\nW. S. M. No. Shall I call him here ?\n1\nI will speak to him.\nYes. Give my love, to Sidgwick, both Mr. and\nMrs., also to Myers, Watts, Massey, Wedgewood,\nBennett 3\nand any other friends who may enquire\nfor me.\nR. H. But Wedgwood is with you now, isn't he ?\nW. S. M. I intended this. He just mentioned to send his love\nalso.\nThis is an explanation clearly suggestive of shuffling.\nFor some months W. S. Moses continued to control\nfrom time to time. It would be tedious to refer to every\noccasion. The quotations already given will serve as\nspecimens, and I have quoted as further examples in the\nAppendix the parts of the sittings of December 4 and 5,\n1896, in which Moses controlled. On January 16, 1897,\nHodgson told G. P. that \" even Moses and his friends\nhaven't proved their identities. Doctor and Rector and\nImperator haven't given me their real names yet \" (see below,\n1\nRector writes later in the sitting (see Appendix, p. 470).\n2\nThe mere mention of these names is of no significance, as they\nmight all have been easily known to Mrs. Piper through the Proceedings\nof the S.P.R. or otherwise.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 97\np. 116). Questions from C. C. Massey intended, as mentioned\nabove, to draw out what should have been vivid recollections\non the part of Moses, were read to the control on January 21,\nbut the answers given were all wrong. Failure, however,\ndid not discourage the soi-disant Moses, who continued to\nassure Hodgson that in time he would give proofs of his\nidentity ; and excuses were made for him, as e.g. by\nDoctor on February 4, \" When one cannot extricate him-\nself from the crowd which surrounds him, as has been the\ncase here, one cannot express one's own thoughts clearly,.\nHence confusion. U.D. Such has been the case with poor\nold Moses. Yet he when not in the act of communicating\nis clear and coherent.\"\nVain attempts at identifying statements continue to be\nmade occasionally, as e.g. on March 2, 1897, when Moses\nwrote :\nWhen you see my friend Sidgwick kindly ask him if he\nremembers the evening we spent together at his own home\nwhen we discussed this very subject viz : the one of which\nwe were speaking spiritualism. Also ask him if he re-\nmembers saying he was willing to receive any thing that\nwas true, yet he must or preferred to judge of its truth\nfrom his own experience. I think if I remember rightly\nthis was the only evening I ever spent with him.\nUnfortunately, like the other attempts, this was a bad\nshot, for he never was in Sidgwick's house. On the whole,\nafter November, 1896, W. S. Moses takes a subordinate\nplace, retiring into the background as the Imperator Band\nbegin to take the leading place, and gradually ceasing alto-\ngether to control. He admits on April 2, 1897, that \" I\nnever could do what your friend Pelham has done, because\nI am not as clear and strong as he is. I do not get the\nsame control which he does.\" Hodgson, discussing him\nas a control (in Vol. XIII., p. 408), after observing that\nhe gave entirely wrong names for Imperator, Doctor, and\nRector, \" and failed later in attempting to answer test\nquestions propounded by some of his friends,\" adds that\n\" later still, however, he did furnish some private informa-\ntion, unknown to the sitters, and afterwards verified in\nG\n\f98 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PAET\nEngland, and well adapted so far as it went as an indica-\ntion of identity.\" I do not know what this private infor-\nmation was, nor whether it was beyond probable guesswork,\nnor whether it was drawn out by leading questions. (It\nwas not, I think, to Hodgson that it was given.) But I\ngather from the way Hodgson speaks of it that it does not\ngo far to outweigh the many irrelevant, implausible, and\nfalse statements which have to be explained away, and that\nconsequently we must regard W. Stainton Moses as having\nfailed to establish his identity. And, similarly, Imperator\nand his band, whatever they were, must be regarded as\nhaving falsely claimed identity with Stainton Moses's spirit\nguides.\nThe Imperator Band.\nIt was on January 26, 1897, that Imperator at the\nrequest of Hodgson undertook the part of chief control.\nAt the end of a communication by G. P., the latter\nwrites :\nG. P. Here comes + { = Imperator}. We must soon all\nleave, H. He is going to take charge of every-\nthing next time and keep us all out, so he sent me\nhere with others to free my mind and get through\nwith everything.1\nThen after a few more remarks G. P. leaves and\nImperator writes :\nImp. + Hail.\nR. H. Hail.\nImp. All is going well. The way is being opened slowly.\nPatience is not without reward. Father sustain him\nand give him strength, courage, hope and light. I\nwill command the light and it will obey. Your\nmessages 2\nwill be given by all. Time is all [?]\nHold thou no cross above thy head, but bear it.\n1\nIt will be observed that G.

What\nwouldst thou have me do ?\nR. H. I want you to take charge of the light and do what\nyou think best for humanity.\nImp. Ah yes I will, but at this meeting.\nR. H. [I ask whether my exterior or interior consciousness\naffects the communications, etc., my opinions, pre-\njudices, etc.]\nImp. At times you do.\nR. H. How can I lessen that ?\nImp. By attending to one thing first.\nR. H. Keeping to one thought.\nImp. Yes and not introduce so many outside intelligences.\nR. H. So that the stream of your thought shall go on without\ninterruption.\nImp. Yes, unbroken. But I have seen nothing but confusion\nhere.\nR. H. [I think I referred here to the several matters un-\nfinished.]\nImp. Yes, but you have had about all the tests that time\ncan give through this light. Now there should be\nhigher development. And it must be done. It is\nlike a child studying music. It must overcome the\ndrudgery, when in time it produces clear and\nbeautiful strains of music. The comjjarison is\nsimilar. I was free with my medium Moses. I\nmust be free here to do good work. I must give\nyou light and then the door will close here forever.\nR. H. In this medium ?\nImp. Yes. After my work has been completed I shall depart\nforever from this door and close it behind me.\nR. H. So that no harm can come ?\nImp. Yes, and leave the natural soul in its own environment.\nUntil then I will be constantly with you. I must\ndepart for the present and give you time in which\nto think it over.

[part\nof Proteus [?] Dante Homer 1\n[undecipherable words]\nI. S. D.\nHodgson on the next day told Mrs. Piper of the pro-\nposal that Imperator should take charge, \" reading her\nsuch portion of his {Imperator's } remarks as did not refer\nto the '\nother light.' \" He explained Imperator's relation\nto W. S. Moses, and left her a copy of his Spirit Teach-\nings to consider.2\nShe made no objection, and the re-\nvolution was accomplished. It was more than a sub-\nstitution of the Imperator Band for Phinuit, for Hodgson\nhimself, for a time at least, abdicated the direction of\naffairs, so that the controls had a completely free hand\nas to conditions. In Hodgson's brief account of the\nchange, at the end of Ins second Report (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 408), he speaks of it as having been deter-\nmined by the controls to a greater extent than the written\nrecords we have fully indicate. He says that Imperator\n\" demanded that the control of Mrs. Piper's '\nlight ' should\nbe placed in their hands,\" and that he (Hodgson) \" was\nrepeatedly and emphatically urged \" thereto by G. P.\nI have already, in discussing the Stainton Moses con-\ntrol, quoted passages from the records showing how\nImperator (who first controlled on November 11, 1896),\nand Doctor and Mentor (who first controlled on Novem-\nber 13), came on the scene. Rector's first appearance as\ncontrol was on November 14, 1896, and the account of this,\nas well as of Imperator's first appearance, will be found in\nthe Appendix to this chapter, pp. 468-470. In Chapter\nII. above, and its Appendices, are quoted numerous pas-\nsages giving accounts by Imperator, Doctor, and Rector\nof the process of controlling, and their pseudo-scientific\nexplanations of it. These accounts were for the most part\ngiven in the early months of their controlling, when, as we\n1\nSome of the names previously given in connexion with the Imperator\nBand.

Both symbols were used by the\nImperator of Spirit Teachings.\n2\nIt has been suggested that from an evidential point of view it was\nunwise to put Spirit Teachings into Mrs. Piper's hands, but ignorance\nof a published and easily accessible book could hardly have been assumed\nin any case.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 101\nhave seen, Hodgson questioned them closely on the subject.\nThere still, however, remain some things to say about the\ncharacters and functions of the members of the Imperator\nBand.\nImperator is represented as a very \" high spirit.\" \" I've\nnever seen any spirit higher than he is,\" says Phinuit on\nDecember 14, 1896. G. P. calls him his holy majesty.\nRector says on June 21, 1905 (as reported by Miss\nA. M. R.), \" No greater spirit ever appeared to earth than\nImperator. His power is divine, it is high, it is noble\n* * * He is in communion with the Great and Holy\nSpirit.\" Myersp says on May 20, 1903, that Imperator\n\" is all powerful.\" He himself appears to rank himself\nwith the prophets, and at times speaks as having received\ndivine authority. On one occasion he says to Hodgson,\nwho was in difficulty about getting money to pay for\nsittings, \" Cast thy burdens upon myself and God. We\nwill bear them all.\" And, speaking of the work of the\nband, Rector says for him on July 3, 1897, \" More\nsatisfactory, higher, clearer, better work than has ever\nbeen done since the days of Christ will be done there-\nafter. This will be nearly at the closing of this epoch. 1\nThen thou must look for other lights.\"\nImperator's communications read in the light of claims\nsuch as these produce on me an unpleasant effect of\npretentious inadequacy.2\nBut, though this is my own\nfeeling, it must be remembered that it does not appear\nto have been Hodgson's, nor that of some other sitters in\nAmerica. Hodgson would, of course, have agreed that it\nis impossible to accept all the statements made, but he con-\ncluded that the undeniable errors and inconsistencies must\n1 \" This epoch \" is, I think, the period of Mrs. Piper's mediumship. It\nmay, however, be the end of the epoch preceding the millennium (see above,\np. 90, and below, p. 122).\n2\nThe same is true of Stainton Moses's Imperator, who also made lofty\nclaims ; but it is much worse in the case of Mrs. Piper's Imperator,\nwhose communications are not only incoherent and contradictory but\naltogether on a lower level of culture than what we find in Spirit\nTeachings. This, of course, is what one would expect if the communi-\ncations either originate in, or are importantly affected by, the mind of\nthe medium concerned.\n\f102 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nbe attributed to the difficulty of working with the medium's\norganism. When and how he arrived at this conclusion I do\nnot know, nor whether he was first impressed with Impera-\ntor's teaching and inferred from it his wisdom and genuine-\nness, or, on the other hand, first accepted Imperator as a\nvery high spirit on the authority of G. P., and felt his teach-\ning to be impressive and authoritative on this account. 1\nPersonally, I can more easily understand the impressiveness\nof Rector as manifested in later years\u2014when Imperator\ntook little part except in opening and closing sittings with\ngreetings and prayer\u2014for Rector is less pretentious.2\nImperator's ignorance of science combined with assump-\ntion of knowledge, as shown in his discussion of the\nprocess of controlling, has been illustrated in Chapter II.\nand its Appendix. When his exposition of this subject\nwas finished, Hodgson started him on the history of\nrevelation, and thus gave him the opportunity of dis-\nplaying similar ignorance, combined with similar claims to\nknowledge, of history and theology. It was on February\n12, 1897, that Hodgson introduced the subject. He\nsuggested to Imperator that there were several interesting\nsubjects that he might discourse on, and continued :\nR. H. One of the most important subjects appears to me to be\na general or detailed account of the revelation of\nGod to man on this planet. About this you gave\nsome instruction to Moses which has been published\nin his Sjnrit Teachings. I refer to the references\nto the chief line of descent from Melchisedek to\nChrist in successive human beings who were guided\nby higher spirits from your world. And it seems to\nme that the world now might be ready to receive a\nfuller account of the lines of spirit influence in\ndifferent nations of the world. What do you think\nof the desirability of this ?\n1 Professor Newbold, who had much opportunity of knowing Hodgson's\nthoughts and feelings as the investigation proceeded, is inclined to think\nthat he accepted Imperator finally on account of his being an inseparable\npart of the spiritistic interpretation as a whole, having seen many cases\nwhich he regarded as practically conclusive.\n2\nFor William James on Rector's impressiveness, see above, pp. 79-80.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 103\nImperator agreed, and on the following day, February\n13, 1897, began his discourses on the subject with state-\nments about the openness to spirit influence of early man,\nmankind being then purer and more spiritually developed.\nThe discussion between him and Hodgson on that day,\nand how Hodgson brought him to agree to a statement\nin accordance with the theory of evolution, will be found\nin the Appendix, pp. 471-8. Imperator next returned to the\nsubject on February 20, 1897, with the words :\nImp. Hail friend of earth I am with thee again. Would go\nback to the early christian church the first revela-\ntion of God * * * There was the kingdom known in\nthose ancient days as the kingdom of Melchisedek.\nDuring this sitting, and some ten more in the course of\nFebruary and March, the subject is continued\u2014I cannot\nsay developed, for there is much repetition and very\nlittle information. The general line will be seen 1\nfrom\nthe record of March 10, 1897, given in the Appendix,\np. 478. Notwithstanding a good deal of assistance from\nHodgson, who both gave elementary information by way\nof criticism or in answer to questions, and also interpreted\nImperator's statements for him\u2014the latter managed to\nproduce a medley of nonsense and contradiction. He said,\nfor instance, on February 23 :\nFrom the days of M[elchisedek] to the life of Abraham,\nthere were many whose perceptions were such as to enable\nthem to gain knowledge of God, yet there were none of\nhis people who were in a condition for God to reveal\nhimself as he did to Abraham, i.e. between the days of\nM[elchisedek] and A[braham].\nBut when the next day, February 24, Hodgson demurred\nto the interval of time between Melchisedek and Abraham,\nhe withdrew it and said, \" that is wrongly registered, there\nwas no time between.\" He said also that Abraham \" did\nmore to develop and raise the Jews \" than any other in\nhis day.\n1\nTogether with a conversation with G. P. showing some dissatisfaction\non Hodgson's part, p. 484.\n\f104 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nHe said at the same sitting, February 24 :\nImp. From the time of M[oses] to C[hrist] men were en-\nlightened. Then after this period so changed did\nmen become, that they grew to be more of the\nearth, earthy, being misled by the teaching of the\nBible, their Book.\nHodgson suggests that he is perhaps referring to the\n\" dark ages,\" and Imperator admits this and says pre-\nsently :\nImp. To us the dark ages are known as existing only in the\ndays of the Papacy when in the reign of the Popes\nthey crucified and slaughtered God's people in large\nnumbers.\nOn March 10 Imperator says that Melchisedek after his\ndeath :\nImp. did live and so act upon the earth, manifesting himself\nin different form, that he actually reigned all\nthrough the days of Abraham M[oses] E[lijah] and\nE[lisha] down to the days of King David.\n* * * *\nThe wondrous workings of M[elchisedek] will never be\nblotted out of the history of the early church.\nHe talks on March 16 of Abraham preaching to the\nJews, and adds :\nImp He made kings of the Jews, built temples of worship,\nrescued Lot dost thou not U.D. me ?\nR.

It is expressed\nin a way different from ours.\nIt would, I think, be of little profit to examine these\ndiscourses of Imperator in further detail, though they bulk\nso largely among his utterances.\nOne thing to be remarked about the Imperator Band is\nthe change it, by degrees, undergoes. When Mrs. Piper\nwas in England in 1907, for instance, we had Imperator\nin the background supposed to be organising the whole\nbusiness, and communicating briefly at the beginning and\nend of the sittings with a greeting and a prayer and\nblessing. He was there to be referred to by his assistants,\nas it were, but communicated very little himself. Rector\nhad become the member of the band with whom sitters\nmostly came in contact\u2014the serious, earnest, patient\nindividual anxious to help everyone on both sides, whom\nall who have sat with Mrs. Piper of recent years\u2014indeed,\nI think, since 1898\u2014know. Communicators, while availing\nthemselves of his services, speak of him sometimes in such\npatronising terms as e.g. \" good old Rector,\" and seem to\nregard him as rather ignorant and a little stupid. \" It\nwas very stupid of Rector I must say {to write \"evangelical''\ninstead of \"Evelyn Hope\"} as Hodgson and Myers both kept\nrepeating it over and over again, to him,\" says G. P.\non March 6, 1907 (Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 61).\nMentor retired early, and Doctor\u2014at least so far as the\nDoctor professing to have been Stainton Moses's control\nis concerned\u2014appears very little after 1897. The Im-\nperator Band secured the services of another doctor for\npurposes of medical diagnosis and advice, namely, a\ndeceased Boston physician, Dr. Oliver. They speak of\nhim in 1904 as \" the doctor,\" as \" our doctor,\" and say\nhe \" came to us recently.\" But I do not think there is\nconfusion, at this stage at least, between him and Stainton\nMoses's Doctor ;\nperhaps there is later when he becomes\n\" Doctor \" without the \" the.\" I believe, however, that\nthe original Doctor of Mrs. Piper's Imperator Band (not,\nof course, of Stainton Moses's) regarded himself as a\n\f106 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ndoctor of medicine, at any rate after he had given up\nbeing Homer (see November 14, 1896, Appendix, p. 471).\nThus on December 3, 1896, there is an air of anatomical\nknowledge, and he spontaneously diagnosed and prescribed\nfor Hodgson who had a sore throat. There is an amusing\npiece of sensitiveness about his language on January 29,\n1897, when he says :\nYes, but I wish you to understand me because I am a\ngentleman and I know my letters thoroughly. I wish\ntherefore to get my sentences correct for your under-\nstanding.\nPrudens, another of Stainton Moses's controls, is not\nmentioned at first, I think, and at no time communicates\nmuch. His chief function is that of a messenger who can\nbe sent to look for spirits, or to convey a message to\nanother medium. He seems to be a vaguely conceived\npersonage, for though in 1899 he was described by Mrs.\nPiper in the waking-stage as a little old man, and though\nhe is generally spoken of as \" he \"\u2014as, e.g. on March 13,\n1901, when Rector says :\nPrudens who went and looked up this case * * * and\nwas explaining to me for thy U.D. the condition exactly\nas he found it to be ;\nor in 1907 {Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 88) when\nHodgsonP says :\nPrudens has been to Mrs. Verrall but he has not been\nable to get the message through to her ;\n-yet on May 26, 1906 {Proceedings, Vol. XXIIL, p. 81),\nhe turns up as a lady. William James was on this\noccasion the sitter and recorder, and Hodgson, who at\nthis time had been dead five months, the communicator.\nHodgsonp . You understand that we have to have a medium on\nthis side while you have a medium on your side,\nand through the two we communicate with you.\nW. J. And your medium is who ?\nHodgsoNj,. We have a medium on this side. It is a lady. I\ndon't think she is known to you.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 107\nW. J. You don't mean Rector ?\nHodgsonp . No, not at all. It is\u2014do you remember a medium\nwhom we called Prizdens ?\nW. J. Yes.\nHodgsonp . Prudens is a great help. Through Prudens we\naccomplish a great deal.\nThis, it may be observed, seems to involve a new view\nof the modus operandi.1\nThe same function is assigned to\nHodgsonp, on January 1, 1907, see Appendix to Chapter V.\np. 524. G. P. is sometimes described as taking notes on\nthe other side as Hodgson did on this ; but that is\ndifferent.\nTo return to Rector, who is from our point of view\nmuch the most interesting and important member of the\nband, he at first, as we have seen, controlled and com-\nmunicated only on his own account, just as Doctor and\nImperator did. It was not till March, 1897, that he took\noffice as intermediary between other communicators and\nthe sitter. Imperator speaks of him on March 4, 1897,\nas his chief assistant, and on March 11 he writes for\nImperator, and does so several times later in the month,\nthough they each also communicate directly on their own\naccount. On the 18th Rector says :\n\" I am between your-\nself and Imperator, and must listen to you both which is\nnot easy for a partially developed spirit to do.\" Towards\nthe end of the month other sitters besides Hodgson are ad-\nmitted for the first time since the Imperator Band took\ncharge, and Rector wrote for their friends ; so his position\nas intermediary and amanuensis may now be regarded as\nestablished. Moreover, he also about the same period is\nrepresented as performing Phinuit's former part in occupy-\ning the head and body, but without speaking, while George\nEliot writes with the hand. I quoted an instance from the\nsitting of March 5, 1897, in Chapter I. (p. 18), and another\nfrom that of April 5, 1897, in Chapter II. (p. 36). One on\nMarch 30, 1897, will be found in the Appendix to the present\n1\nMrs. Verrall tells me that the view that a medium is wanted on both\nsides was strongly held in the automatic writing of Mrs. Forbes, and that\nthe question was discussed by the latter with Hodgson on one of his visits\nto England about 1900.\n\f108 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nchapter (p. 499) ; and one on March 31, 1897, in the\nAppendix to Chapter II. (p. 415). An instance on March 9,\n1897, is perhaps worth quoting here because it led to a\nremark about spirits hearing, which may be compared with\nG. P.'s on October 17, 1896 (see above, p. 91). George\nEliot writes :\n\" Rector said I will remain with you here\nand arrange all these material things for you \"\u2022\n\u2014\ni.e.\nMrs. Piper's position, etc. ; and a little later, when asking\nfor a message to take to Myers, she writes :\n\" I do not wish\nyou to speak it loudly, but slowly, softly, so that I alone\nmay hear it, or no one but myself and Rector * * * Do\nnot let the rest of the spirits hear it. Rector says ready.\"\nRector may then about this date be described as having\ntaken Phinuit's place, especially as he also undertook\nPhinuit's function of medical adviser. One difference,\nhowever, was that Phinuit spoke and Rector wrote.\nRector never spoke during his first months of office, and\nlater only for a few favoured sitters. The post of inter-\nmediary is represented as a somewhat arduous one, for,\nin addition to the difficult task of both listening to\nthe communicator and writing down (\" registering \") what\nhe says, 1\nhe has to \" hold the light,\" or his \" position\nin the light,\" or \" hold the end of the cord.\" 2\nWhen\nthings go wrong Rector has to bear the blame, and\nhe only holds his post during Imperator's good pleasure.\nFor instance, there was serious trouble on December 19,\n1898, when there had been a very confused sitting. It was\na first sitting, that is the sitter had not been present before,\nand she did not recognise the professing communicators at\nall. She writes about it as follows :\nMore than thirty names were given but no names of\nany of my deceased or living friends were among them.\nEight different forms of relationship were given and the\n1 \" When I am not listening I can register well enough,\" says Rector\non January 25, 1905, and again on March 27, 1905: \"I find it im-\npossible for me to listen and register carefully at the same moment.\"\nOn both of these occasions Hodgson had complained of his writing one\nword on the top of another.\n2\nCf. Appendix to Chapter II., p. 430 (May 25, 1904), and also Appendix\nto this Chapter, p. 490 (May 24, 1904).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 109\nrelationship of myself to my departed friend was among\nthem, but nothing whatever was given to show the per-\nsonality of this friend.\nThe writing had been rapid and often illegible. At the\nnext sitting\u2014December 24, 1898\u2014Hodgson being alone,\nImperator (apparently through Rector) remarks, referring\nto the failure :\nWe cannot burden Rector with the responsibility of\ntaking care of new communicators, and we will search and\nfind another control whom we will have serve in his\nplace +. We find that unless all the forces are in activity\nfrom our side he is incapable of assuming the responsi-\nbility and * * * we are not at all times present * * *\nWe have been contemplating a trial with either Prudens\nor Doctor. We will during the next meeting for test\npurposes send either one or the other * * *. We cannot\nask thy friend George to take that position, as he is going\non to a higher and better condition.1\nRector is apparently forgiven however, as there is no\nsign of this contemplated change having been carried out.\nThere is another thing to notice about Rector, namely,\nthat the inconsistency of his statements as to the name\nhe bore on earth extends also to the language he spoke.\nOn May 26, 1898, the sitter, Mrs. \" Howard,\" reports\nas follows\u2014Rector was using the voice :\nRector talks about my health and all my affairs and is\nvery sweet and consoling. Then he says a prayer in a\nstrange tongue no word of which I can understand. He\nsays that I must say that prayer. I say I don't under-\nstand it. He says it is Hebrew and that he lived long\nago and was Hebrew and wishes me to learn to speak\nsome Hebrew words. He is sure I can do so. He then\nsays as nearly as I could tell :\n\" sick nim kim kray \" and\nsays that is one, two, three, four. Then he says \" ain,\nnim, kain, kr-g \"\u2014this last a guttural like German with no\nvowel sound. He is much pleased with my pronouncing\n1\nMore than a year and a half before this (April 23, 1897) it had\nbeen said that \"His work in your field is done\" (see above, p. 81).\n\f110 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthis correctly. He says he wishes much to teach me some\nHebrew\u2014that this will please Hodgson !\n1\nA few days later the same sitter, this time accompanied\nby her daughter, records :\nRector speaks in a clear deep voice, * * * He then\nprays in Hebrew. He says Hebrew is his native tongue,\neasier to him than English ; then translates.\nIt is curious after this to find Rector on January 16,\n1907, in England, writing as amanuensis for Imperator\nwhat he said he thought were Hebrew letters (they\nscarcely bore even a superficial resemblance), but unable\nto understand them himself.\nRector's statement on January 21, 1907 (see Proceedings,\nVol. XXII., p. 35) that his name was Francis, could\nhardly be consistent with Hebrew being his native tongue.\nNor, again, combined with the ecclesiastical character given\nhim in the trance communications,2\nis it easily reconciled\nwith his being spoken of by MyersP as \" good old Rector\nwho does not understand a word of Latin \" (see Proceedings,\nVol. XXII., p. 337).\nOne reason given in January, 1897, for the taking over\nby the Imperator Band of the management of medium\nand sittings was that the medium had been worn out by\nsittings for tests of identity or of supernormal power. If\nthe \" light \" is to last, they say, sittings for instruction\nand consolation must be substituted for test sittings, the\nimplication apparently being that the former are less of a\nstrain to the medium, who is spoken of as a \" battered\nand worn \" machine (February 6, 1897) which must be\nrepaired. Imperator writes (January 26, 1897, see above,\np. 99), \" You have had about all the tests that time\ncan give through this light. Now there should be higher\ndevelopment.\" 3\nAccordingly, under the new regime, the\nsittings not only become free from the convulsive move-\n1\nHodgson was in England at this time. The above syllables have no\nresemblance to the Hebrew numerals.\n2\nSee, e.g. June 3, 1903, p. 424, and December 14, 1904, p. 431, Appendix\nto Chapter II.\n3\nSee also similar statements in 1903. Appendix, p. 490.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. Ill\nments that previously preceded them, but become other-\nwise quieter, and they are largely devoted to instruction\nand exhortation. Hodgson describes the change in Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 409, and the change is also appar-\nent from the following account by a lady who had\nhad experience of both the Phinuit and Imperator regimes.\nShe writes in December, 1897 :\nThe April and May {1897} sittings were clearer\u2014as far\nas mistakes went\u2014than any I had ever had, and there\nseemed a stillness and peace, a freedom from the old\nhurry and confusion * * * There is a greater desire to\nhelp one to live a higher life shown * * * but as far as\nknowledge of the future goes, I cannot say that the new\ncontrols have been more correct than Phinuit was, but\nthey are not so ready to talk of the future or of material\naffairs.\nIt is noticeable, however, that the lofty ideal of the\nfunction of the Imperator Band as spiritual teachers and\nguides is scarcely consistently maintained. We find, for\ninstance, in June, 1899, that the Imperator group are\ngiving advice about investments, or if they do not give\nit themselves, introducing Flower, \"the great financier,\" to\ndo so. Imperator apparently personally invited him. The\nadvice does not turn out very well, and perhaps this is\nwhy six months later we find the controls saying that\nthey wish to give advice on financial matters only when\nthey choose. It is not to be asked for except perhaps\nby a certain named sitter.\nIt is probable that in 1897 the objection to tests\nreferred chiefly to sittings held with a view to obtaining\nproofs of the identity of communicators. At any rate\nthe objection did not apparently extend to looking for a\nmissing boy, or to experiments in what we should now\ncall simple cross-correspondences. 1\nThe distinction is\nnot difficult to understand, because immediate success is\ndemanded by a sitter seeking for evidence of the communi-\ncator's identity. If the supernormal information comes\neasily all would be well and probably no fatigue ensue, but\n1\nFor these see below under George Eliot, pp. 115-118\n\f112 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nif it is struggled for and perhaps not obtained\u2014the reader\nhas only to refer to the sitting of December 5, 1892, in\nAppendix to Chapter II. (p. 355), or that of March 18,\n1907, in Appendix to Chapter V. (p. 536), to see how\nfatiguing it would be. On the other hand, in the search\nfor the lost boy, or in carrying messages to or from a dis-\ntant medium, the sitter is as well satisfied at the time by\none decently plausible statement as another. He knows as\nlittle of the truth as the medium does.\nSearch for the missing boy D , who was officially\nreported to have died in Mexico, but who was believed\nby his relatives to be alive all the time, engaged the\nattention of the Imperator Band, of G. P., of Phinuit, of\nJulius Caesar, and of others, in the autumn and winter of\n1896-7, chiefly before the Imperator Band took charge.\nElaborate though vague accounts of places and buildings\nwhere he was asserted to be were given by the controls,\nwho go backwards and forwards between Mexico and\nBoston reporting what they see and saying that they are\nconstantly watching over him. Nothing came of it all,\nand there is, I believe, no reason for thinking that there\nwas anything veridical in any of the statements made. A\nfew references to the matter have already been inciden-\ntally made, and it will suffice if in addition I give the\nparticulars of Julius Caesar's intervention.\nJulius Caesar.\nThe first time Imperator controlled\u2014November 11, 1896\n(see Appendix, p. 470), he said :\n\" Julius Caesar is my\nfriend. He will not falter by the wayside. Not he.\" 1\nThe\nname, like other names mentioned at this time, was prob-\nably a feeler put out in the desire to find the names of\nStainton Moses's spirit guides. But having been so men-\ntioned, it seems likely that the idea acted suggestively in\n1\nA previous mention of the name Julius Caesar had occurred on\nOctober 30, 1896, when the Stainton Moses control made an enigmatic\nremark about him as follows :\n\" R. H. were you interested in the\nBacon Shakspeare controversy ? W. S. M. Yes very, yes very. I have\nmany fields to open up from Julius Caesar. I have many spirit teach-\nings to recall and discuss.\"\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 113\nproducing the control a few days later. We have an instance\nin 1892 of a person mentioned by one control appearing as\na control herself afterwards for no reason apparently except\nthat the name had been mentioned. On November 30,\n1892, G. P. controlling illustrated a point by referring to\nLaura Bridgman, the blind and deaf girl who was success-\nfully taught to read and write. Six days afterwards, and\non several later occasions, a Laura Bridgman control\nturned up, but said nothing of interest. At her first\nappearances there were movements of the hand suggesting\nthe deaf and dumb alphabet which no one present knew,\nbut no name was given. Phinuit professed not to know\nwho it was, though he said she had had a great struggle\nto get there. Subsequently the name was written.\nBut to return to Julius Caesar. On November 16, 1896,\nDoctor writes : \"Charles Adams. Julius Caesar. * * * I hear\na word from each for you.\" On the following day, Novem-\nber 17, talking with the control J. Hart 1\nabout Mexico\nand the search for D ,\nHodgson asked: \"Who went\nwith you on this last trip ?\n\" Hart proceeded to name\nvarious people\u2014Erasmus, Ulysses, D. D. Home, Alexander\nthe Great, Proteus, Julius Caesar. Hodgson misreads at\nfirst, then says :\nR. H. Oh, Julius Caesar.\nHart. Yes, did you know him ?\nR. H. I didn't know him personally, George, of course, but I\nknow about him.\nHart. I am not George.\nR. H. Hart I mean. The writing is so good and quick that it\nreminded me of George's manner I suppose.\nsfe $ s\u00a3 $\nHart. He is a brick.\nR. H. Julius Caesar % [Assent.]\nHart. And he went to Mexico with us.

H. Tell me the others.\nHaet. Yes. Can you believe it ? Can you imagine my being\nable to fly hand in hand with Julius Caesar 1\nOn the following day, November 18, 1896, Hart affirms\nthat \" Caesar has got a powerful hold on this matter, and\nI assure you, H, old boy, that not a stone will be left\nunturned by us on this side.\" Then presently there is a\nscribble of the pencil and Julius Caesar takes control.\nHodgson reports :\n[After the scrabble, a wild fling of the arm, several\njerks, and bangs on the table, and then a plunge forward\non the table at full length, palm of hand upwards, turned\na little to the left, as if to shake hands. I touch the\nfingers as if to shake hands, but there is no response. I\nput the pencil between the fingers, and it seems to under-\nstand and the arm draws back and I help it into position\nfor writing.

Caezar is as great as ever he was. Adieu. G. P. I\nam off for Mexico.\nThis is, I think, Julius Caesar's only attempt to control,\nbut he is mentioned again on January 21. 1897, by\nPhinuit, who says, by voice, not writing :\nI just came back a little while ago {from Mexico}.\n^ ifc ifc\nImperator has been down there. And so has Moses.\nAnd Julius Caesar. It is Julius Caesar. They say the\nonly Julius Caesar. He walks around that place like a\nman on guard. He'll liberate that boy.\nGeorge Eliot.\nAnother and more frequent control\u2014George Eliot\u2014was\nintroduced in connexion with the attempts at cross-\ncorrespondence mentioned above (p. 111). They were\ncarried on for many days and with great elaboration\nthrough the Imperator Band, G. P., and others in January.\nFebruary, March, and April, 1897, but were entirely\nunsuccessful, notwithstanding constant affirmation of success\nby the controls concerned. The medium at the other end\nwas a non-professional medium, Miss C., with whom Myers\nwas having sittings in England. These sittings took place\npartly in London, and during about a fortnight in April,\nin a house reputed to be haunted in Scotland. Special effort\nwas concentrated over this fortnight, during which the\nsittings with Miss C. were no doubt more frequent than\nthey had been in London.\nThe first we hear of these experiments in the Piper\nrecords is on January 16, 1897, when Hodgson says to\nG. P. :\nFred Myers has got hold of a light * * * why can't\nyou give your pass-sentence.\nG. P. says he will if Myers calls for him, and Hodgson\ncontinues :\nThe medium is a Miss C [name given] and a spirit\nfriend of hers, a Miss T. is the chief communicator, I\n\f116 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nunderstand. George Eliot told Myers through that light\nthat she had communicated here. She did once when\n\" Q \" was writing.1\nYou can get hold of George Eliot\nthrough \" Q \" and make enquiries at once.\nAfter a brief interval, during which another matter is\ndiscussed, G. P. says :\nG. P. Oh I shall be so thankful if I can only use the light\nthere and give my pass-word.\nR. H. Take Doctor and Rector and the whole crowd of com-\nmunicators that come here and make them give\ntheir names to the other light.\nG. P. But I thought I had given you the names of nearly\nevery spirit in heaven already. The Egos of every\none of them have been seen by yours truly.\nR. H. Yes, but that's totally different. There's nothing\nthrough any other light. Even Moses and his\nfriends haven't proved their identities. Doctor and\nRector and Imperator haven't given me their real\nnames yet. And the evidence would be on a dif-\nferent basis if you could send corroborative messages\nthrough another light.\nAfter some more discussion, G. P. agrees, and then\nfetches George Eliot 2\n\u2014who communicates through him,\nand gives a message alleged to come from Myers and takes\none for him. Messages are sent and news of the other\nmedium given at each intervening sitting, and George\nEliot is spoken of as taking part, but she controls for the\nfirst time herself on January 20 ; Phinuit says :\n\" There's\na gentleman there wants to speak to \" Hodgson.3\nReport\ncontinues as follows :\n1\nThis was on December 16, 1893. \" Q.\" wrote :\n\" George Eliot is\nhere with me now * * * Yes, at this moment.

Ask\nhim if he received it as I have quoted it here.\nA good deal more of the same kind is said at this\nsitting, and George Eliot frequent!}' controlled 2\nafterwards\nduring the first half of 1897. Her topics were chiefly\nthese cross-correspondence experiments with Myers's\nmedium and elaborate descriptions of heaven (where, it\nmay be observed, she met, among other people, Adam\nBede). I give specimens of communications by her on each of\nthese topics in the Appendix, pp. 491-513. In connexion with\n1\nK. F., a friend of a frequent sitter, and herself a frequent control\nat this period.\n2\nThere is a little ambiguity sometimes as to whether George Eliot\ncontrols or communicates. In several cases expressions are used which\nseem nonsense unless she is controlling. But on March 15, 1897, in the\nmiddle of a communication in which Hodgson describes her as herself\nwriting, she says :\n\" We speak by thought unless we act upon some machine so-called\nmedium when our thoughts are expressed to the controlling spirit\nwho registers them for us ;\n\"\nwhich looks as if she regarded herself as communicating through an\namanuensis. She more than once herself acts as amanuensis for Im-\nperator.\n\f118 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthe first, I also give Myers's statement of the failure of the\nexperiments and Hodgson's discussion with George Eliot about\nit, and also (p. 513) a record of a similar and equally futile\nattempt at cross-correspondence between Mrs. Piper and\nthe same medium, Miss C , when Hodgson is erroneously\nsupposed to be sitting with her in November, 1897, though\non this occasion it is \" Q.\" and the Imperator Band who\nare the messengers\u2014not George Eliot. The curious thing\nabout these experiments is the definite and uncompromising\nassertions of the controls, not only that they have taken\nthe messages proposed, but that they have seen the other\nmedium and sitters and their surroundings, which they\ndescribe, and have brought back messages from them\nwhich they give\u2014all this that they describe being\nerroneous and having no relation to the facts. False\nstatements of the same kind were made, it will be remem-\nbered, in 1908 when some cross-correspondences reaUy did\ntake place (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIII. ). The controls\nseemed unable to distinguish the unsuccessful from the\nsuccessful attempts, and gave similar circumstantial and\nunveridical accounts of supposed visits to Mrs. Verrall\nand others.\nTo return, however, to George Eliot :\n\u2014on April 1, 1897,\nRector informs Hodgson that she has been promoted to\napparently a high position in the band of controls and\ncommunicators.

[part\nprophecy desired by Hodgson (a desire not, so far as we\nknow, mentioned to Mrs. Piper or her controls), no reason\nis indicated. It may well be, however, that the New\nTestament phrase, \"Moses and the prophets,\" or some\nrecollection of the pre-eminence among prophets attributed\nto him in the Old Testament (see Deuteronomy xxxiv. 10),\nsuggested Moses as a leading prophet when prophecy was\nwanted. It was on December 18, 1899, that he made\nhis solitary appearance, and Hodgson notes at the end of\nthat sitting :\n[In connection with the above statement made by\n\" Moses,\" I note that the war between the British and\nthe Boers has been much on my mind lately, and that I\nhave several times recently since my previous sitting on\nNov. 15,\n1\nmeditated on the desirability of asking Im-\nperator if he knew of any one specially competent to\nmake prophecies on questions of war on this planet.\nProphecies were made at the end of 1896,\n2\nand also\nI think in 1897 and 1898 further prophetic references to\nwars were made at the sittings, but owing to my own\nignorance and that of other sitters of the trance con-\nditions, these prophecies were somewhat confused, and I\nhoped that perhaps more definite statements could now be\ngiven.

It was given\nthrough G. P. as control on October 17, 1896, and, though hardly con-\nsistent with the prophecy made by \" Moses of Old,\" in certain respects\nresembled it.

Her name occurs first on\nOctober 23, 1910. Sir Oliver Ledge was in charge, and a\nfriend of his who was to be the principal sitter was\nwaiting to come in after the trance had begun. The same\nsitter had been present on the immediately preceding\noccasion, October 13, and Gurney had then controlled.\nThe sitting of October 23 begins thus, Imperator appar-\nently controlling :\nImp. + Hail\n-f- Friend what asketh thou of me ? + I. S. D.\nO. J. L. Imperator I want you to help us. There is a friend\nin the next room wishing to speak with one on\nyour side.\nImp. Friend it may be difficult for you to realise that our\nwork is nearly at an end, but it is really so.\nO. J. L. Don't go in a hurry.\nImp. We have remained a good long time with you and\nnow I must soon call my messengers away, -f-\nI. S. D.\nO. J. L. We are grateful for all they have done for us. Do\nyou know our friend Gurney ?\nImp. Yes well, all he is trying to do. We see his light\nand U.D. his desires well. He controls fairly well.\nGuyon also\nO. J. L. Do you mean Madame Guyon ?\nImp. helps.\nThe occurrence of the name was striking, because the\nattention of the sitter, who came in a few minutes later,\nhad recently been drawn to the subject of Quietism (of\nwhich Madame Guyon was a prominent exponent) owing\nto a reference to it hi a message received through the\nwriting of another automatist, which message claimed to\ncome from^ Gurney. This fact was known to Sir Oliver\nLodge, but nothing, so far as is known, had been said on\n\f124 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pakt\nthe subject to Mrs. Piper, and there appears to be no\nreason why the name should come into her mind normally\nat this time. 1\nIt is mentioned again, still with no apparent\nrelevance, later in the sitting. Gurney is communicating\nand says to the sitter :\nE. G. Is {M } clearer ?\nSitter. Yes\nE. G. I have explained everything to her all about how to\ncommunicate and everything and all about Guyon.\nYes and her help.\nNo more happened in connexion with Madame Guyon\ntill February 8, 1911. In the interval there had been\nthree sittings and three other attempts to go into trance\nwhich had failed. On this day the following brief isolated\ncommunication occurred in the middle of the sitting a propos\nto nothing apparently :\nGuyon says it\nI hunted all through life for Christ and found him in\nmyself. I am happier now.\nThere is undeniably a certain appropriateness to Madame\nGuyon hi this remark.\nWe next hear of her on July 3, 1911, when without notice\nshe comes as the control in charge of the sitting\u2014in Im-\nperator's place, in fact. The sittings that winter and spring\nwere few and far between, because, as mentioned above\n(Chapter I., p. 13), Mrs. Piper had often great difficulty\nin going into trance and sometimes in coming out, and long\nrests between trances were prescribed by the controls. Even\nso, a considerable proportion of the attempts to go into\ntrance failed altogether. On May 24 a difficult trance\noccurred. Rector said :\nR. If we could accomplish anything by coming we might\ntry otherwise it would be wiser to discontinue. We\nare sorry to leave you. We have been your friends\nand done our best to prove our life.\nO. J. L. Yes indeed, and we are grateful.\n1\nMadame Guyon in life appears herself to have been an automatist, but\nwhether this was known to Mrs. Piper at any time I do not know.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 125\nR. We did hope to restore the light but it seems fruitless.\n{At the end of the sitting, however, Rector said :\n}\nAfter many Sabbaths try again.\nApparently the next incident was a little impromptu\nsitting of Mrs. Piper with her daughters on June 10 at\nwhich the controls urged that there should be a sitting\nwith Mrs. Isaac Thompson, well known to Mrs. Piper both\nas a friend and as a sitter. Accordingly a sitting on\nJuly 3, 1911, was arranged for her and her son. Sir\nOliver Lodge was taking charge, and records the beginning\nof the sitting as follows :\nCross in air {this was a common Avay for Imperator\nand Rector to begin}\nMme. G. I greet you friends. I am Mme. Guyon I come to\nsupervise and render such assistance as seems\nwithin my power. Guyon.\nO. J. L. Oh, that's very interesting.\nMme. G. I will now stand aside and give way to my new\nfound friend.\nThe writing was small and good. After it had been\nread, the hand was seized with excitement, scored the\npaper, broke the pencil, and presently wrote as Hodgson,\nwho apparently continued to write through the sitting,\nacting as amanuensis for Isaac Thompson. At the end\nhe wrote in his own name again, and when he had taken\nleave and O. J. L. had said \" Good-bye, Hodgson,\" a\ncross was made in the air again, and in a changed hand-\nwriting came :\n\" Goodbye friends and may you rest in\npeace. + Mme G.\" In the waking-stage that followed,\nMrs. Piper said :\n\" That lady who prays all the time said\nrun away now \" ; and after the \" snaps \" hi her head\n\u2014\nthat is, when nearly normal\u2014\" I saw a lady with a cross\nin her hand and a lot of pretty people.\"\nMrs. Piper only once more\u2014so far as we know\u2014went\ninto trance. It was on July 31, 1911. The trance was\nlong incoming on, but the writing at last began :\nMme. G. + I am glad to meet you friend. I am Guyon.\nO. J. L. Hail Madame Guyon, glad to see you\nMme. G. God be with you one and all. A friend is waiting to\n\f126 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [part\nspeak. I'll step aside. God's blessing on you.\nMme G.\nThe main part of the sitting was occupied with com-\nmunications from Lady Lodge's relations and friends,\nHodgsonP apparently acting as amanuensis. Imperator\nclosed the sitting and Madame Guyon did not appear\nagain that day, but in the course of his final remarks\nHodgsonP spoke\u2014at least so I interpret him\u2014of the possi-\nbility of automatic writing without trance being developed,\nand then said :\n\" Mme will get through in any case, this\nwe are sure of.\" This final part of Mrs. Piper's latest trance\nsitting, and the subsequent waking-stage, are quoted in the\nAppendix (p. 514).\nThere are two things worth noting about the latest\ndevelopments of Mrs. Piper's trance. The first is that all\nthe difficulty attending the going into trance\u2014the evidently\nfailing power to do so with safety\u2014did not apparently\nprevent communications of evidential value occurring when\nthe trance did come on. By evidential value I mean, of\ncourse, of value as affording evidence in the trance utter-\nances of knowledge which cannot have reached Mrs. Piper\nthrough her senses. Unfortunately this evidential matter\nwas too private for publication, but I gather that some of\nit bears comparison with some of the best that has been\npublished. I do not here raise the question of how far\nthe sitter was an important factor in the result, as this\nis of general application throughout the evidence, and does\nnot, therefore, specially affect the present point.\nThe second point is that the introduction of Madame\nGuyon as a control was apparently intended to be a step\nin the direction of peacefulrtess in the manifestations\nbeyond that already attained under the Imperator regime.\nThis is perhaps made clearer in the automatic writing\nwithout trance to be described presently. But it can\nhardly have been meant that this gain in peacefulness\nwould be secured by a method of going into trance\nquieter than the very quiet one which had already become\ncustomary. Presumably, therefore, it meant either a dis-\nposition to some lighter form of trance, or more probably\nto the automatic script without trance which actually\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena,. 127\noccurred. It would be very interesting to know how far\nthe development of automatic script was the result of a\ndeliberate plan made by some intelligence, possibly a\nsubliminal self, with the object of making up for the loss\nof power to go into trance ; to know whether Sir Oliver\nLodge's suggestion in May (see below) to try for automatic\nscript set this plan going ; and whether the substitution\nof Madame Guyon for Imperator at the last two trance\nsittings was part of the plan. But these things must, I\nfear, remain matter for conjecture.\nThe automatic writing under Mine. Guyon's direction,\napparently foreshadowed in the last trance by the Hodgson\ncontrol, showed no signs of beginning till September 20,\n1911, but it is interesting that one brief piece of script\nwithout trance had already occurred in June. About the\nend of May, seeing that the trances seemed likely to come\nto an end, Sir Oliver Lodge suggested to Mrs. Piper's\ndaughters to try if she could do automatic writing in a\nnormal state. The idea was not new to her ; she had\nseen something of the kind produced by others, and had\nin previous years occasionally tried for it herself, though\nwithout success. To give a concrete instance, she had\ntried vainly on June 20, 1895, in Dr. Newbold's presence\nimmediately after a sitting during which the control\n\u2014\nG. P.\u2014had been asked :\n\" Could you use Mrs. Piper's hand\nwhile she is conscious?\" and had replied: \"I'll try. I\ndo not know.\" 1\nSoon after Sir Oliver Lodge's suggestion, namely, on\nJune 4, 1911, when Miss Violet Lodge happened to be\npresent with the Piper family party, Mrs. Piper complained\nthat her hand felt numb, and it occurred to one of her\ndaughters to give her a pencil. At first nothing happened.\nThen the position of the pencil was changed, and it was\nplaced between her first and second fingers. A little scrap\nof script was then obtained consisting first of a drawing of a\nseven-legged insect, then the words \" A Rachne,\" and then\na drawing of a spinning-wheel\u2014all three in one line. The\n1\nA sentence, veridical apparently, had however been written automati-\ncally on April 25, 1894. while Hodgson \" was managing to keep her\nout of trance successfully\" (see Chapter VI., p. 211).\n\f128 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nletters were written detached, quite plain, and with a back-\nward slope, totaUy different in character from the trance\nwriting. The word Arachne\u2014Greek for spider\u2014and the\nspinning-wheel make it practically certain that the badly\ndrawn creature was meant for a spider ; but Sir Oliver\nLodge satisfied himself that neither his daughter nor Mrs.\nPiper or her daughters attached any meaning to \" Arachne,\"\nand they called the creature a beetle.\nIt is rather curious that, notwithstanding this successful\nattempt, nothing came but scribbles when Mrs. Piper next\ntried on September 20\u2014just as might happen to any one\ntrying to obtain automatic writing for the first time. The\nfollowing attempt was little better, consisting mainly of\nrepetitions first of \" Mme.\" and then of \" G.\" The next,\non October 8, again consisted of repetitions of \" Mme.\" and\n\" Mme. G.,\" but these were interspersed with drawings of\necclesiastical objects. The fourth attempt on October 11\nbegan to be more coherent. It was made fairly clear that\na rosary and a particular kind of cross were to be sym-\nbolic of Mme. G. just as a -f- was of Imperator. The name\nGuyon was not given, but Gun was repeated several times.\nThen a soi-disant Hodgson wrote and brought about an un-\nmistakable coincidence, which it is very difficult to suppose\neither accidental or due to any normal knowledge of Mrs.\nPiper's, between the script and Sir Oliver Lodge's preoccupa-\ntions on that day. The script also said :\nTrust Mme G and things will soon be clearer * * * A\nmost holy influence is being brought to you * * *\nSeveral other scripts followed, getting more and more\ncoherent. Mme. Guyon always purported to be present,\nthough the full name was not written except backwards.\nThe longest and in some respects most interesting of the\nscripts was produced on October 28, 1911, in the presence\nof Sir Oliver Lodge. The writing continued for about an\nhour conversing with him in the manner of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance script, and accompanied by some of the trance\nmannerisms. For instance, the hand was sometimes held\ntowards Sir Oliver's mouth as though to listen to what\nhe said. Mrs. Piper too spoke of a tingling in hand and arm\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 129\nat the beginning and end, a sensation sometimes experienced\nin connexion with the trance (see Chapter I., p. 24).\nMme. Guyon purported to open and close the script\njust as she would have done had it been a trance com-\nmunication. In short, it resembled a trance communication\nin almost all respects, except that Mrs. Piper was in full\npossession of her normal consciousness all the time, though\nshe did not attempt apparently to follow what the script\nsaid. Sir Oliver asked for Hodgson, who then purported to\nwrite, Mrs. Piper saying she felt the influence in her arm\nchanging. After conversing with this Hodgson control for\nsome time, Sir Oliver sent a message to Myers, who there-\nupon took control, the writing again changing somewhat. He\nsaid, among other things, that Mme. G.\nhas taken up the light and is the chief control now. We\nshall all greet you often and give you much help. We\nare only in the primary stage\nA drawing of Madame G.'s cross presently led Sir Oliver\nto say \" Madame G. is coming again,\" and Mrs. Piper re-\nmarked : \"I like her, she is most quiet and restful \" ; and\nagain when the writing was over :\n\" That is the quietest\npeacefulest influence. I feel rather rested when she has\nbeen.\"\nIt is clear, then, that some intelligence behind the\ntrance communications, and behind the subsequent auto-\nmatic script, looked forward to further communications of\nan interesting kind under the Guyon management. But\nthese anticipations have not so far been fulfilled. Mrs.\nPiper sailed for America on October 31, 1911, and since\nthen has sent a few scripts to Sir Oliver, namely, one\nin 1911, three in 1912, some in 1914, and again several in\n1915. Madame Guyon has continued to take the lead, and\nmessages from different communicators have been written,\nbut the output is somewhat meagre in amount and its\ncontent for [the most part of little interest, though\none ov\\ two of the scripts of 1915 give more promise of\nevidential communications. It is possible that Mrs. Piper\nhas not herself been interested in obtaining script, and\nthat more might come if she were.\ni\ni\n\f130 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nCHAPTER IV.\nIndications (1) of Artificiality in the Language of\nthe Controls, and (2) of Common Memories and\nAssociations of Ideas in Different Controls.\nThe two lines of investigation included in the heading of\nthis chapter are distinct, but it is convenient to group\nthem together because certain cases may belong to\neither. Moreover, both may conveniently be considered at\nthis point of the whole discussion when the reader has\njust been introduced to some of the individual controls.\nApart from what they say about themselves and each\nother, our knowledge of controls depends almost entirely\non their language\u2014that is, on the way they speak and\nwrite. They are not like men living among us, whom we\nmight know well even if they never spoke or wrote at\nall. The examination of their manner of speaking or\nwriting may therefore be very important. Some controls\nhave, it is true, certain characteristic gestures. For in-\nstance, Phinuit, we learn from Hodgson's records in 1896-7,\nhad a habit of rubbing Mrs. Piper's right cheekbone with\nher left hand when he first appeared. Different writing\ncontrols hold the pencil differently, press on it with dif-\nferent degrees of force, and tend to exhibit different\nmovements or contractions in the hand as a prelude to\nwriting. But these movements are not very revealing ;\nand whether they were at first accidental and then become\nhabits of Mrs. Piper's organism associated with particular\ncontrols, or whether they were merely signals, like Im-\nperator's cross and Madame Guyon's rosary, intended to\nannounce the writer, we have no means of knowing.\nThe language used by each control in speaking or\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 131\nwriting is similarly more or less characteristic. Phinuit's\nway of speaking with a semblance of French accent and\na few French words was peculiar to himself and markedly\ndifferent from that of others. The G. P. and Hodgson con-\ntrols both evidently spoke with a sufficient resemblance to\nthe language of those gentlemen in life to be impressive\n\u2014\nsometimes very impressive\u2014to their friends ;\nand their\nwritten communications resembled their speech. The differ-\nence of style exhibited by other controls can be studied\nby the reader in the preceding chapter and its appendix.\nHe can there observe the elaborateness of George Eliot\n;\nthe pomposity, with a tendency to use biblical phraseology,\nof Imperator ; the brusquerie and colloquialness of G. P. ;\nthe stilted style of Julius Caesar and \" Moses of Old,\"\nand so forth.\nThe question is\u2014are these differences due to habit ?\nIf they are, whose habit is it ? Or are they, on the\nother hand,\u2014again like the cross and the rosary\u2014merely\nsymbols ? In the case of Phinuit, of George Eliot, of\nG. P., of Hodgson, and of others stated to have lived\ncomparatively recently, the habit is no doubt supposed to\nbe their own ; and the fact that it is tempered by Mrs.\nPiper's habit would, perhaps, not be very surprising even\non the theory of almost complete control by spirits. But\nwhose habit is revealed in the language of Imperator and\nRector ? We do not know what then original language was\nsupposed to be. Their own view about this presumably\nvaried with their views about the names they bore, and,\nas we have seen, Rector in particular made inconsistent\nstatements about his native language (see above, pp. 109, 110).\nBut at all events they did not profess to be modern\nEnglishmen or Americans. Nor did they derive their\nstyle solely from Mrs. Piper's habitual mode of speaking,\nor from that of the sitters. 1\nNor is their style the same\nas that of Stainton Moses's Imperator. Whence, then, did\ntheir language habits come ?\nIf pressed they might, perhaps, themselves have an-\nswered this question by saying that they used the same\n1\nThey sometimes however professed that they borrowed words or modes\nof expression from the sitter (see Chapter VIII., p. 299).\n\f132 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nlanguage in communicating that they used among them-\nselves in the other world, only modifying it a little to\nsuit our habits. It is true that they and other controls\ntell us that communication between spirits is by thought,\nor by ideas\u2014not by speech. 1\nBut other statements\nsuggest that in practice English, with some deviation from\nordinary usage, is the language of the other world. For\ninstance, on March 3, 1897, Rector speaks about \" emana-\ntions.\" Hodgson asks him what he exactly means by\nemanations, and Rector replies, \" Spirits. We speak in\nthis way among ourselves. It is difficult to bear in mind\nthat I am speaking to an earthly friend.\" 2\nGeneral questions of style are rather elusive and difficult\nto discuss, but one peculiarity of the language of Im-\nperator and of Rector\u2014the use of the second person\nsingular during parts of their careers as controls, but not\ninvariably-\u2014gives us the opportunity of studying a definite\npoint of style statistically, as it were. The investigation\nreveals clearly, I think, that a habit of using the second\nperson singular was deliberately adopted, was cultivated\nwith some difficulty, and finally, so far as Rector was\nconcerned, was deliberately dropped. This, of which I\nshall, I think, be able to convince the reader, affords as\nfar as it goes distinct evidence of an artificial attempt to\nspeak in a particular manner. It shows that some intelli-\ngence was planning the make up of Imperator and Rector,\nor that they themselves were playing a part.\nTo judge from Stainton Moses's Spirit Teachings, his\nImperator, who however did not \" control \" himself but\ncommunicated through Rector, only used the second\nperson singular in addressing the deity. His style is a\npulpit style, and the form \" ye \" occasionally occurs in\naddressing people collectively, but to Moses himself he\nsays \" you.\" The false Imperator, who communicated\nthrough G. P. in October, 1906, and claimed to be Joseph\n(see above, p. 90) apparently also used \" you \" in addres-\nsing Hodgson, unless G. P. translated into that form for\n1 See Appendix to this chapter for instances of this assertion.

When Mrs. Piper's Imperator first controlled (on\nNovember 11, 1896, see Appendix to Chapter III., p. 468)\nhis communication consisted largely of prayers in which\nnaturally the word \" thou \" was used. Hodgson was, how-\never, addressed as \" you \" more than once, though \" thee\n\"\nwas used in the farewell phrases. At Imperator's second\nappearance, which was very brief, he used \" thou \" in\ngreeting Hodgson. At his third time of controlling,\nNovember 17, 1896, the second person plural is chiefly\nused, though he says once \" I will be thy spiritual ad-\nviser,\" following it with \" I will show you the way.\"\nExamination of subsequent sittings show a similar mixed\nuse, and I do not think it is clear that Imperator intends\nto use the second person singular regularly and habitually\ntill about the middle of February, 1897. It may have\nbeen that Hodgson's invitation to him on February 12 to\ngive an account of the revelation of God to man suggested\nthat scripture language was appropriate\u2014whereas before\nthat \" thou \" and \" thee \" may have been introduced as part\nof a more general attempt at archaic or poetic language. 1\nAs, for instance, on December 8, 1896, when the sentence\n\" Look thou yonder and see your faithful friend George\n\"\nillustrates both the use by Imperator of the word \"yonder,\"\nunusual in ordinary modern English prose, and the lapse\ninto \" you \" of a sentence begun with \" thou \" as the\nmode of address. At any rate it can hardly be doubted,\nafter February 12, whatever we think before, that though\nthe use of \"thou\" and \"you\" are still mixed, \"thou\"\nis the form intended and \" you \" comes in by mistake.\nIt is after this date, too, that these lapses begin appar-\nently to be sometimes noticed by the control, and what\nseem rather flimsy excuses for them to be made. The\nfollowing example of this occurred on February 22, 1897.\nImperator writes :\nIn the days when Christ appeared this evil was subdued.\nYou will U.D.\u2014 Thou speakest not to me. I am not\nyou. Rector says you. I command all quiet. Go on.\n1\nThere is a good deal of this kind of mixture of \" thou \" and \" you \" in\ne.g. Scott's novels.\n\f134 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nI do not profess to understand fully the by-play be-\ntween spirits here, but it seems clear that the sentences\nfollowing \" you will U.D.\" are intended to explain the\noccurrence of \" you.\" A little further on the enquiry\nabout understanding is put in the form \" Dost thou\nU.D. ?\n\"\nIn the above passage it is fairly clear that Imperator\nwas \" controlling \" himself\u2014not employing Rector as\namanuensis, as he began to do in March, 1897 (see above,\np. 107). Rector's mode of addressing Hodgson in 1897\nwas, however, in the second person plural, though he was\napt to get a little confused between \"you\" and \"thou\"\nwhen his subject was one on which Imperator had pre-\nviously communicated, or when he was acting as amanu-\nensis for Imperator. 1\nHe seems to realise this himself\nsometimes, for on March 11, 1897, when there had been\nsome mixture of \" thee \" and \" you,\" he interpolated at\none point :\nI use my own expression when speaking for him [i.e. Im-\nperator] at times, because I am more accustomed to so doing.\nAfter which Hodgson is consistently addressed as \" you \"\nto the end of the sitting.\nBy the summer of 1898, however, the use of the second\nperson singular had apparently become easy to Rector,\nand he had taken to using it on his own account.\nExactly when this change took place it is difficult to say,\nbecause Rector generally wrote for Imperator or for the\nImperator Band, or for the friends of sitters, and the\npassages where it is certain that he speaks for himself\nalone are comparatively few. But we can trace the\ntransition to some extent. Thus, on January 28, 1898, he\nis undoubtedly saying \" you \" to Mrs. L. (see Appendix to\nChapter III., p. 514). Again, on May 14, 1898, a sitting\nhi which \" thou \" and \" you \" are much mixed, Rector\nseems clearly to speak for himself in the following passage :\n1\nA case occurred on March 19, 1897, of what seems to be confusion under\nthese circumstances ingeniously explained by getting temporarily rid of\nImperator, who is represented as returning a little later in the sitting. It\nis quoted on p. 151 below in another connexion.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 135\nSitter. Is this my father ?\nRector. Yes he is dictating to me.

Read not\nfor many weeks, rest your mind, take things easy.\nAmen, and rest thy body a great deal.\nAnd in the following passages in sittings of June 8\nand 9, 1898, it is again clearly Rector who is communi-\ncating on his own behalf, and this time using the second\nperson singular without mistake :\n{June 8, 1898.)\n{Rector writing after a long communication from a friend\nof the sitter.}\nRector. Rector. I am with thee friend of earth and what has\ntaken place no mortal mind must know. Speak not\nof thy friends anxieties.\n(June 9, 1898.)\nI am Rector and I am speaking for thy brother, thy\nhusband and thy son, they are present but I am\nspeaking for them\n{and later to Miss Edmunds who was recording}\nI have told thee this time and over and again\nWith the evidence before us of the development of\nRector's use of the second person singular, the following\nremarks made by him and Imperator to Mrs. L. on\nApril 9, 1900, read rather strangely. They came to close\nthe sitting after a friend of Mrs. L.'s had been con-\ntrolling :\nR. Friend we return to thee once more and strange to say\nwe have discovered that our language is not like\nthine of earth. For instance we see that thou dost\nsay you, and why not thou ?\nMrs. L. Sometimes we say thee and thou to friends, but in\nour language usually only in speaking to God.\nR. All yes, we U.D. but such is the language of our\nown life\n\f136 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nThe use by Rector of the second person singular con-\ntinued with occasional momentary lapses till the summer\nof 1905. But when on October 30, 1905, sittings are\nresumed after the summer holidays, the habit is changed\nfor some unexplained reason. Hodgson was alone present\non October 30. \" Thee \" is used in the opening greetings\nto him\u2014and the use of thou and you is mixed on the\nfollowing pages when the controls are explaining that\nMrs. Piper's mediumship is not likely to be continued\nlong :\nWe are desirous of finding one or more good lights through\nwhich communication can be established for thy\nwork, as we shall not long continue here as we\nhave previously and many times stated. We do\nnot intend to return so often as formerly friend.\nWe may continue to return on first 1\nand second 1\nbut it is doubtful if we return continuously on\nthird 1\nas formerly. Therefore it will be well for\n[hand turns to spirit] you to look well to other\nlights.\nAfter this the second person plural is used during the\nremainder of this sitting with one possible lapse ; and it\nis also used in those that follow, whether Rector is speak-\ning for himself alone or for the Imperator Band, except\nthat \" thee \" is apt to occur in the initial greeting. That\nthe change was deliberate seems to be shown by the\nfollowing passage in the sitting of November 22, 1905, in\nwhich a lapse occurs. Hodgson was the recorder and only\nsitter. Rector was writing and had addressed Hodgson\nin the second person plural. Then in arranging for a\nsitting for a new sitter described as \" Mrs. R.'s sister,\"\nthe following occurs :\nR. Wilt thou [Hand turns to spirit]\nWill you [Hand assents to spirit]\nGeorge is teaching me these words. Will. U.D\nR. H. Yes.\nR.

P. apparently intervenes\non one occasion to get \" you \" said instead of \" thee\n\"\n\u2014possibly to cover up a tendency to slip into \" you \" on\nRector's part. It happened on October 13, 1902. Rector\nwas writing, and Hodgson was the sitter and recorder.\nR. He tried to speak to thee and ask thee to call on\nMrs. D. to see if he could not [send] a message\nto . . . say you Rector . . . send a message to\nyou . . . George said you . . . say [written above\nyou] you\nR. H. (reading) George said say you.\n{Hodgson comments on this :} [Apparently G. P. is\ncommunicator and wished Rector to say you and\nnot thee.]\nOn May 24, 1904, there is a criticism by the com-\nmunicator, the so-called Dr. Oliver, of Rector's language\nas old-fashioned and a statement that they were \" teaching\nhim how to use different language \" (see Appendix to\nChapter III., p. 490). Possibly it is intended to represent\nthe change to \" you \" in October, 1905, nearly a year and\na half later, as the result of this instruction.\nHodgson died quite suddenly on December 20, 1905, and\nthe last record of his which we have is that of a sitting\non the day before\u2014December 19, 1905. The next sittings\nof which we have the complete records were those in\nEngland in 1906-7. The use of the second person plural\nby Rector was quite established throughout these sittings,\nexcept that in the one voice sitting during the series (on\nNovember 16, 1906, see Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 234)\nhe began by using \" thee.\" In subsequent sittings of\nwhich we have records\u2014viz. Mr. Dorr's in 1908, Miss\n1\nThere is another instance of consciousness about language on the same\nday, though in the form of Rector's remarks about the language of com-\nmunicators. He says of a communicator :\n\" R. This lady is a most\ninteresting spirit and when she speaks herself I find she does not say\nawfully, but George does repeatedly . . . say . . . awfully . . . U.D.\nR. H. Yes. R. He supplies words often to help out a new com-\nmunicator.\"\n\f138 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nPope's in 1909, and the English sittings of 1910-11\n\u2014\nRector continued to address the sitter as \" you.\"\nDefinite changes of language, such as those we have\nbeen considering, can only be explained, so far as I can\nsee, by supposing the control to be, in some degree at\nleast, personating a character to which he thinks a special\nway of speaking appropriate, and accordingly adopts it as\nwe might do in acting a charade. The apparently\naccidental slips which occur in the use of this language\npoint in the same direction, but less distinctly perhaps,\nbecause it might be argued on Hodgson's theory that\nthese, like grammatical mistakes, were due to \" the\nmachine \" ; that is, to the control's manner of speech\nbeing interfered with by the tendency of Mrs. Piper's\norganism to work in the way habitual to it.\n1\nIt must be observed, however, that the grammatical\nmistakes made in the Piper script are of two distinct\nclasses. There are those consisting in the misuse, but not\nuniform misuse, of old grammatical forms which are not\nhabitual to Mrs. Piper's normal waking self\u2014as, for\nexample, where the form \" dost \" is used for \" doth \" or\nvice versa, or \" ye \" is used in addressing a single indi-\nvidual. The following are instances :\n\" Dost not thy book\ndrop him {Melchisedek} about the time of Israel,\" said\nby Imperator in 1897, and again, \" When dost thy book\nspeak of Salem?\"; \"Thou mistaketh God's power,\" said\nby Imperator or Rector on June 3, 1898 ;\n\" Friend be ye\nnot discouraged time will be given thee for all things\nwell,\" said by Rector for himself and Imperator on\nNovember 20, 1899 ; \"If thy brother faileth in his work\nfail ye not but turn to him and lend him thy helping\nhand,\" said by Imperator on November 3, 1902 ;\n\" If\nthou hath increased,\" said by Rector on December 20,\n1904. See also, for other mistakes of the same kind, an\nextract from the sitting of December 20, 1904, in the\nAppendix to Chapter II., p. 434. This class of mistake is\n1\nA slip occurred on December 12, 1906, which goes against this tendency-\nof- the- organism theory. Iloctor, who by this time had given up the use of\narchaic language, except occasionally in the initial greeting, wrote \" The\nlady present hath light a little.\"\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena . 139\nnot instinctive, it is not due to bad habit, but to absence\nof habit, or, at least, imperfectly formed habit. They are\nlike the mistakes we make in speaking a foreign language\nwhich we have acquired imperfectly, and they point to a\nform of language being used artificially.\nThe other class of grammatical mistake is doubtless due\nto bad habit in Mrs. Piper, whose grammar, I am bound\nto say however, is usually excellent. I think the com-\nmonest error of this class is the use of \" as \" for \" that\n\"\nin certain connexions, which is liable to occur with all\nsorts of controls. Thus\u2014taking examples from G. P. and\nGeorge Eliot, both educated writers in this life\u2014we have\nG. P. remarking on October 29, 1896, \"Well, I cannot say\nnow as he is the Moses you wish \" ; and again on January\n26, 1897, \" I laughed and said I am plain George Pel-\nham and no special Angel as I know of.\" George Eliot\nwrites on March 30, 1897 : \"I hardly know as there is\nenough light remaining for me to continue \" ; and on\nApril 5, 1897, \" Do not know as I have ever seen a\n'\nHaunted House.' \" We may compare also GurneyP on\nJanuary 25, 1897 : \"I do not know as I mean in a day\nor two, but it may in a week or two.\"\nThere is a record of a conversation about grammatical\nmistakes of this sort which took place between Hodgson\nand Myersp communicating through Rector on February 4,\n1902. It is worth quoting, as it contains views expressed\nby Hodgson and by the trance personalities on the subject,\nand as it is, moreover, the conversation about \" Nigger\ntalk \" to which William James refers in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIII., pp. 18-19.\nR. H. Do you remember about your laughing with me once\nand your saying that doubtless you would some\ntime be coming back and talking nigger-talk ?\nMyersp . Yes indeed, Well, very well do I remember this.\nIs this what you would call my talks with you\nnow % R. H. No\n\u2014\nMyersp . I should really like to know if it sounds anything\nlike it.\nR. H.

The plain,\nstraightforward meaning is that mistakes like the insertion of the redundant\n\" of,\" are often due to Rector's not understanding what the communicator\nsays.\n2\nThe old-fashioned Quaker use of \"thee\" is, of course, different from\nthat of the ordinary second person singular, which may have been Rector's\nreason for not attempting it at first.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 141\nin November, 1902, when he was habitually using for\nhimself the ordinary second person singular as his mode of\naddress. The second case was in July, 1907, after he had\ngiven this up. Mrs. Piper had previously known both the\nsitter and the communicator of November 24 and 25,\n1902. The control was Rector, writing, and Hodgson was\npresent as recorder throughout the first of the two sittings\nand through the greater part of the second. The sitter\nwrote afterwards :\nThe sittings as a whole were highly satisfactory to me ;\nwere very characteristic of Mr. W. Although so personal\nand private they might not be of much evidential value\nto others\n\u2014\nto me, it was positive assurance that Mr. W.\n{the communicator} was really there.\nDuring the first sitting the sitter used the Quaker\n\" thee \" throughout, but the communicator addressed her\nthrough Rector as \" you.\" As regards the second sitting,\nHodgson notes :\nAfter Mrs. P. had lost consciousness and with eyes closed\nwas sinking into trance, {the sitter} asked me why\nMr. W. didn't use thee in communicating as he was\nin the habit of doing during life. I explained to her\nbriefly that G. P. was probably helping, and that in\nany case the verbal forms were liable to be affected\nby the intermediary or intermediaries. Nov. 25, 1902.\n\u2014R. H.\nIn Mr. W.'s communications at this sitting \" you \" is\nused at first, but afterwards \" thee.\" Shortly before the\nchange is made the following remarks occur :\nSitter. I want to know all that is on thy mind, dear. Speak\nfreely.\nMr. W. I heard better then dear.\n[Between spirits] thee yes thee\nMr. W. I hope you U.D. that Mr. {Pelham = G. P.} is helping\nme, dear.\nSitter. I am most grateful to him.\nMr. W. He is kindness personified. I can come more easily\nto-day.\n\f142 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nIt is worth remarking that though the communicator\nmay have thus repeated the two points of the conversation\nwhich took place while Mrs. Piper was seemingly uncon-\nscious\u2014the appropriateness of Mr. W. using \" thee \" and\nthe assistance of G. P. as a probable explanation of his\nnot doing so\u2014though he may have repeated these without\nhaving heard the conversation, it certainly looks as if the\nconversation suggested his remarks and the subsequent\nadoption of the form \" thee.\" If we could be sure that\nthis was so, it would be important in its bearing on the\ninterpretation of the Piper phenomena. Experienced in-\nvestigators would of course always assume, as Hodgson\nevidently did in this case, that anything said in the\npresence of the medium during the period of deep sleep\npreceding the trance might reach the trance con-\nsciousness.\nThe second instance occurred at one of the Isaac\nThompson sittings recorded by Sir Oliver Lodge (Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXIII.). The Thompson family being\nFriends, the older members of it appear, sometimes at\nleast, to have used the second person singular in talking\nto each other. The records printed by Sir Oliver Lodge\nin Vol. XXIII. , pp. 162-198, show, however, that it was\nscarcely used at the sittings either by sitters or com-\nmunicators. The exception occurred on July 3, 1907 (op.\ncit. pp. 192-193). Rector was controlling. When Mr. E.\nThompson said to a recently deceased uncle communi-\ncating :\n\" Can you tell us from whom you ordered it ? \",\nthe uncle replied through Rector as amanuensis :\n\" That\nwould be difficult to get through to thee.\" And later in\nthe same sitting, when Isaac Thompson was communi-\ncating, his widow, who had been addressing him as you,\nsays :\nMrs. T. And Isaac, we want to send our love to thee and\nCharlie. Theodora is here. * * *\nCommunicator. Theodora dear are you better (Theodora had\njust come into the room.)\nRector. I say you R. Because I understand it better. Rector.\nHe says Thee, but I say you. I understand it\nbetter.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 143\nWhether this is genuine\u2014that is to say, whether Rector\nwas translating the communicator's \" thee \" into \" you \"\nall through (except in the one case of the uncle quoted\nabove)\u2014or whether it was a piece of hedging due to Mrs.\nThompson's \" thee \" suddenly suggesting to Rector that\nthis was the form he ought to have been using, it is, of\ncourse, impossible to say. The difference between the\nexcuse given here and that given in the previous instance\nis noteworthy.\nThere is another line of language development analogous\nto the change in Rector's usage of \" thou \" and \" you,\"\nbut mixed up, I think, with some confusion of thought.\nIt is in the use of the names for periods of time\u2014hour,\nday, week, etc. \u2014and for the days of the week. The\ncontrols maintain that there is no time in the other world,\napparently meaning thereby no divisions of time. I am\nnot sure when this idea was first mentioned, but for our\npresent purpose the following bit of conversation between\nG. P. (writing) and Hodgson on October 16, 1896, is early\nenough. Hodgson had been talking about mistakes in\nprophecies made by controls, and referring to correct\nprophecies also.\nG. P. Oh I do see, yet H. it is like this. The facts are\nvisible perfectly, and there is a perfect panorama\nof things going on continuously before us. Now\nthen when I see a picture or which is to me a\nstern reality, I mention the fact. Yet whether it\nprove itself a fact within one week, one year, I\nam unable to say. I am willing to admit this, H.\nI have only learned this by experience. That there\nis no time here is an established fact.\nft. H. There are changes and there must be time.\nG. P. I mean to say not as there is time in the material\nworld, no division of time.\nR. H. Not the same kind of division ?\nG. P. No but totally different.\nThis idea is carried right through the Imperator regime\nand to the end of Mrs. Piper's trances, and after a while a\nresult of it is asserted to be that the controls cannot\n\f144 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nunderstand the meaning of time names. Thus William\nJames says {Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 115) :\n\" The\nweak talk of the Imperator-band about time is reproduced,\nas where R. H. pretends that he no longer knows what\n'\nseven minutes '\nmean (May 14, 1906).\" And, as another\nexample, in the record of Dr. Stanley Hall's sittings in\n1909 (Studies in Spiritism, p. 231), occurs the following :\nSitter. Can we meet two weeks from to-day ?\nHodgsonp . Oh, don't talk like that. Oh, don't talk, I can't\nUD.\nSitter. Can we come second after second coming ? Will that\nbe right ?\nHodgsoNj, I'll enquire. [The hand rises, beckons, questions, and\nwrites,] Yes. Very good. I'll be here.\nOr again on November 26, 1906 :\nSitter (O. J. L.) The sitting will be in the afternoon.\nRector. Afternoon ?\nSitter. Yes, your medium does not mind, and it suits the\nlady better.\nRector. I do not think we fully understand the time : can\nyou explain more explicitly ? R.\nSitter. I only mean it will be later in the day : after the\nsecond meal, instead of after the first.\nRector. It will not matter to us, friend, we think + R.\nAnd on April 9, 1907, at one of the sittings in London :\nSitter (E. M. S.). Not to-day at all. Perhaps next week\n[Hand seems not to understand]\nSitter. Perhaps after next Sabbath.\nRector. Oh yes I U.D. thank you.\nThis want of understanding does not occur at first. G, P.\nin the passage quoted above writes of \" week \" and \" year \"\n;\nand, what is more to the point, the Imperator Band make\nno pretence of not understanding such words in 1897. For\nexample, on June 28, 1897 (Hodgson recording, Rector\nwriting) :\nR. H. Shall I come to-morrow, or shall I wait a week, or a\nmonth, or three months or six months ?\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 145\nRector. We will mention a time for thee and when the time\napproaches fail us not. One more week and we\nshall know.\nR. H. The nest time that I come is to be a week from\nto-day ?\nR. We would prefer to see thee the day before the\nSabbath\nR. H. To-day is Monday, and I will come again on Saturday.\nR. It will be well. We have many preparations for the\nSabbath always in our world.\nDays of the week have to be constantly referred to in mak-\ning appointments with controls for future sittings, and the\nideas of day and week and of particular days of the week\nare never lost\u2014it would have been very difficult to make\nappointments with the trance personality if they bad been\n\u2014but the Imperator Band adopt a peculiar nomenclature\nfor them. The working days of the week are numbered\nconsecutively from Sunday, and described as following one\nor other of the Sundays in a series numbered from the actual\ntime of speaking. Monday of next week would be described\nas the first after the coming Sabbath\u2014or simply as first after\ncoming, with Sabbath understood. In this way, though\nthe word \" day \" is used, the word \" week \" and the names\nof the days of the week are avoided. This practice, for which\nI find no reason given in the records, seems to have begun\nsome time in 1898 or 1899. Certainly in the following\npassage on November 4, 1897, it is Mrs. L., the sitter and\nrecorder, rather than Rector, who approximates to it.\nMrs. L. Can you give me now a time or times when I can\nhave my sittings so I can send word to Hodgson.1\nR. Yes. Monday\nMrs. L. The day after next Sabbath 1\nR. And the day following etc.\nHfL $ $ a|c\nMrs. L. Am I to understand that you will meet me personally\non Monday ?\nR. At 4.30. It is so.\n1 With a view to the cross-correspondence experiments, of which the\nfailure is described in the Appendix to Chapter III., pp. 513-514, Hodgson\nwas in England at this time.\n\f146 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nAnd other instances of the use of time names at this\nperiod could be added.\nBy the autumn of 1898 the Imperator Band's new way\nof describing the days referred to had become more or less\nestablished, and it was readily adopted by the sitters, but\nthe word \" week \" was still sometimes used by Rector him-\nself and by sitters talking to him to the end of 1898\nand through 1899 ; and Hodgson could still in 1898 talk to\nRector of Monday, Tuesday, to-morrow, etc. It is hardly\nworth continuing the examination of the records for the\nexact gradations in the use by the controls of time names\nor for the moment when they began to protest that they\ndid not understand them. It would be difficult to deter-\nmine either with any exactness ;\npartly because Hodgson\nand others concerned with making appointments, which is\nthe connexion in which dates and therefore time names most\nfrequently occur, got to use the peculiar nomenclature of the\nImperator Band with great consistency, and therefore gave\nno occasion for protest ; and partly because there are slips\nand inconsistencies in the controls' own use of the words. As\nMiss Verrall says (Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 454, footnote) :\nThe controls often protest against the use of words denot-\ning periods of time, e.g. morning, week, etc., and\nsometimes appear unable to apprehend their meaning. At\nother times, however, they use these very words themselves\nand their attitude does not seem to be based on any\nconsistent principle.\nIt would be easy to multiply examples, but I think I have\nsaid enough to prove the point I wished to bring out, viz.\nthat the Imperator Band (with HodgsonP in their wake)\nprofessed in e.g. 1906 a difficulty in understanding words\nof a certain class which they knew and used correctly\nand apparently naturally in 1897. Either, therefore, their\nknowledge of the English language had deteriorated or\ntheir ignorance was assumed\u2014assumed, it would seem, with\na confused idea that it supported a theory about time in\nthe other world expressed by G. P. in 1896 in the passage\nquoted above, and by the Doctor of the Imperator group\non April 18, 1904, as follows :\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 147\nWe have many times (perhaps not I personally) stated\nthat which is true that we have no stipulated time\nin our world. Therefore we more or less lose the\nconditions of time in your world after entering this. 1\nAnother point we may notice is that there are occasional\nlapses from the mode of expression proper to a particular\ncontrol which are suggestive of artificial use. For instance,\non April 7, 1897, George Eliot, writing, says in the course\nof a description given in the first person singular of her\nexperiences in heaven :\nYou might ask the question \" Are there bees in heaven.\"\nYou might also ask as to whether there were birds\nin heaven. We would answer both by saying there\nare both. We answer from experience. We have\nseen them.\nI was visited for a moment by an acquaintance viz.\nRector. This is why I said we.\nQui s'excuse s'accuse, and it is the not very plausible excuse\nhere offered, that makes the case suspicious. No excuse\nwas needed, for the \" we \" might quite well stand for \" we\nin heaven.\" But Rector when speaking for Imperator\nalways said \" we,\" and George Eliot's excuse looks like a\nconsciousness of having accidentally fallen into this\n\" we \" habit ; a thing which might easily happen if there\nis an underlying unity in the trance personalities.\nThat there was a slip in the next case is certain. On\nMarch 23, 1897, the following passage occurred in the course\nof a conversation between Rector and Hodgson :\nR. H. Where am I going for the experiments to which you\nreferred %\nR. We do not know your country well.\nR. H. It is near where I am now ? R. Yes, sir.\nR. H. Yes, sir ? R. Yes, friend.\nNow Rector does not address any one as \" Sir,\" so it would\nseem that this slip must have been due either to a momentary\nconfusion as to his own identity, or as to the part he was\n1 The occasion of this remark, as of Gt. P.'s, is that no reliable date can\nbe given for the fulfilment of a prophecy.\n\f148 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nplaying. Some difficulty in deciding who is communicating\nin the script, suggesting possible temporary confusion in\nthe control as to his identity, is liable to occur, but it is\nseldom so definite as in this case.\nAnother incident may be quoted resembling the last, only\nit is not the form of address, but the form of a written\ncapital letter appropriate to another control that is used\nand corrected by the control. It was on April 20, 1897.\nG. P., who, I think, had not controlled since March 24,\nopened the sitting. The following is Hodgson's record\nwith his remarks as usual in square brackets :\n[G. P. writes] [Shakes hands]\nR, H. Halloo George.\nG. P. How are you H. ? [The H as Rector usually makes\nit, type\nR. H. First rate, George, old chap. What's the news ?\nG. P. Just left Newbold.

That there is a common\nstock of memories and associations, besides, of course, in-\ngrained ones such as are implied in the common use of the\nEnglish language, cannot, I think, be doubted, but what\nhas further to be determined is whether it amounts to more\nthan can naturally be accounted for by supposing the con-\ntrols to talk things over among themselves. Do the cases\nI am about to refer to indicate, on the other hand, that\nthe individuality of the controls is less distinct than they\nassert ? What they say is (June 5, 1900, Rector writing) :\nOur intelligence doth not live within the boundary line\nof the brain of this light or any other U.D. but\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 149\nwhether our sentences seem broken or unintelligent or\nwhat not we know we are independent and individual\nintelligences acting through and upon it as mortals would\nregister sentences with a machine and mortals hath no right\nto gainsay it and ere we cease our work they will surely\nknow. Remember this friend.1\nDoes their common stock of associations show this to\nbe untrue ? I do not think the examples I have to bring\nforward can be regarded as conclusive on the subject,\nbut they are suggestive and worth considering.\nI will begin with an instance of the occurrence to G. P.\nand to George Eliot of the same language difficulty on\nconsecutive days which may possibly be a mere coinci-\ndence, but which at any rate can hardly be due to the\ncontrols concerned talking to each other behind the\nscenes. On January 19, 1897, G. P. controlling wrote\nat the end of the sitting :\nG. P. Yes, I intend to do this, H . . . Yes yes, they {i.e.\nthe Imperator Band} two too. The verb too\nbothers me at times\n1\nThe sitting at which this was said was a kind of farewell to Hodgson\nbefore the summer holidays, though it was not quite the last of the season.\nNothing in the record of the sitting accounts for the emphatic assertion ;\nbut I think it may have been in part at least due to my own and Mr. Andrew\nLang's papers in Proceedings, Vol. XV. On April 3, 1900, the following\nconversation took place between Hodgson and G. P. about this, and there\nis no record of Hodgson being present at any sitting between April 3 and\nJune 5 :\n\u2014\nG. P. What have you been discussing now, H. ? R. H. Oh\nI don't know exactly, George. I expect soon to reply to some criticisms\non my report of these things. They\u2014for example\u2014allege that there must\nbe an admixture of the\u2014what is called the subliminal consciousness of\nMrs. Piper, because when Doctor came and talked about Homer, said I\nam Homer and so on, and in answer to my question if he was Homer the\nreply came yes and so on, a lot of statements made when their group first\nbegan using the light. O. P. Well, don't they know yet that they were\nin no wise developed and were more or less confused themselves or will they\nnever U.D. anything ? R.H.I think probably it will be pretty hard to\ndrive some things into the heads of those who have not been through a long\npractical experience. G. P. Well, don't bother yourself too much, H\nthere is ... a long road that has no turn. Keep to the right and when\nthey think they know the most they know the least, so what does it matter\nany way * * * * Well, stick to it and in spite of all things you will surely\nwin. R. H. I know. G. P. I tell you you will sure. R. H. I have\nno doubt.\n\f150 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\nR. H. The word too. G. P. Verb\nR. H. Verb ? G. P. Yes To two too. G. P.\nOn January 20, George Eliot wrote :\nG. E. I am waiting for your message.\nR H. Do you remember the words of Shakespeare :\n\" Spirits are not finely touched\nBut to fine issues \" ?\nG. E. Is this quotation from the Tempest or\nR. H. I think Measure' for Measure.\nG. E. Oh yes. [R. H. repeats the passage several times\nduring the writing]\nG. E. Spirits are not finely touched but to two too two [?]\nfine issues. I hear you better this way {i.e. holding\npalm of hand towards Hodgson's mouth}\nR. H. I understand.\nG. E. Spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues. Very\ngood indeed.\nWe should think it an odd coincidence if two acquaint-\nances independently spoke of this difficulty on consecutive\ndays. At the same time, it must be observed that the\ndifficulty may have been differently caused on the two\ndays. G. P. evidently made a mistake and wrote \" two\n\"\nwhen he meant \"too.\" George Eliot, on the other hand,\nperhaps failing to understand the quotation at first, did\nnot know which of the three words was meant.\nThere are various instances in which a solidarity among\ncontrols seems to be assumed\u2014in which, that is, a control\ntalks about what \" we \" have done or experienced, though\nhe is not by way of having been concerned in the matter\npersonally at all. Sometimes the want of complete appro-\npriateness of this mode of speech is noticed, as, for\nexample, in the remarks of the Doctor quoted on p. 147\nabove. The Doctor at this time (April, 1904) was said to\nbe a Dr. Oliver who had died in September, 1903, and\nhad apparently joined the Imperator Band, \" Our doctor\n\"\nwho \" came to us recently,\" Rector says on December 13,\n1904. When Dr. Oliver says \" we have many times\n1 Note G. P.'s persistence in a quasi-grammatical error, which G.

Rector\nwas controlling, acting as amanuensis for Imperator.\nHodgson was the sitter and recorder, and his notes are\nas usual in square brackets. They were discussing the\nadmission of other sitters and communicators for the sake\nof the fees.\nRector. We have through this channel given as many proofs\nof spirit identity as we can.

H. I understand. It's all right. I wasn't sure what you\nwrote.\nR. Yes. We did not U.D. you. At least I did not.\nDo you wish us to name the communicators ?\nR. H. Yes. Of course.\nR.

[part\nNow we would send only those who are clear and\ncoherent and it is now time to give some comfort\nand not so much questioning because the light is\nnot equal to it, my friend.\nThe sentence in this passage relevant to our present topic\nis, of course, the first, in which Rector claims on behalf of\nthe Imperator Band the evidence for spirit identity given\nbefore they came on the scene at all, and then corrects him-\nself. I have quoted more of the passage than this, because\nthe end of it throws further light on the beginning, and be-\ncause in the middle occurs an example of change from the\nsecond person singular to which I have referred in a foot-\nnote on p. 134 above, and it seemed better to give this here\nrather than to break the passage up.\nThe next instance I have to give is somewhat different.\nOn November 12, 1898, when Hodgson and Rector were\nmaking arrangements for future sittings, the following con-\nversation took place :\nR. There is nothing of great importance at this meeting\nto be settled further, but thou hast a friend, viz.\nNewbold who would desire to come to us later,\nand he must not be overlooked.\nR. H. Very good.\nR. No matter when he asks, it must be arranged for.\nR. H. I shall be very glad.\nR. And we must have it so understood,\nR. H. Yes.\nR.

For the first time since our last meeting with him\nwe are working with and for him directly * * *\nand -f attention has been called to him in par-\nticular of late and infinitely better arrangements are\nbeing made for him.\nI know of no reason for this outburst about Professor\nNewbold at this time. The records throw no light on it.\nThe interesting point in it hi connexion with our present\nsubject is Rector's reference to him as if the Imperator\nBand knew him, for they had never nie\u201et him through Mrs.\nPiper. Any knowledge they had of him as giving light\nmust, it would appear, have been obtained from Stainton\nMoses or other spirits, and \" our last meeting with him \"\ncan only be interpreted on the hypothesis of a solidarity\namong controls\u2014what Stainton Moses had done counting\nas if the Imperator Band 1\nhad done it. Dr. Newbold\ntells me that the only sitting he had between those of\nJune, 1895 (to which much reference has been made in\nprevious chapters), and 1906, was one towards the end\nof January, 1896, before the Imperator Band had\nbeen introduced. The only other sittings he has had\nwere the two in 1906, from which William James quotes\nlargely in his paper on the Hodgson control in Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXIII. , and it was not till then that he\nhad any converse with Rector. Dr. Newbold suggests that\nthe allusion on November 12, 1898, may perhaps be to the\nfact that he was the first to enquire for Stainton Moses\nand to invoke the Stainton Moses control, through whom\nhe asked for the names of Imperator, etc. But \" giving\nlight \" in script parlance could not, I think, mean this. A\nperson sitting with Mrs. Piper during the trance \" gives\nlight \" when he or she is what I should call a good sitter\n\u2014\none with whom the process of communication goes easily\nand well, and who gets good results. 2\nThat Dr. Newbold\n1\nIt is true that Stainton Moses is on one occasion at least mentioned as\nhaving joined this band, which is perhaps to be regarded as a very loosely\nconstructed one. It is possible that \" we \" should sometimes be taken as\nmeaning all the controls and communicators whom Imperator undertakes to\ndirect.\n2\nCompare Chapter VIII., pp. 295-297.\n\f154 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nwas a good sitter in this sense will not be doubted by any\none who has read his own paper in Proceedings, Vol. XIV.,\nor William James's account of his sittings hi 1906 in Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXIII. Rector was quite right as to the\nfact that he had \" given light,\" in the sense that he was a\ndesirable sitter to have, but how did Rector know, and why\ndoes he claim that the light was given to \" us \" %\nThe next case to be considered is one where association\nof ideas clearly plays a part. It happened on November\n22, 1905. The following conversation took place between\nHodgson and Rector :\nR. H. I have various matters to mention, first especially a\nspecial request to Imperator. [Hand {gestures as\nto a spirit.} Cross in air.]\nRector. He will U.D.\nR. H. I have an earnest request from Lodge, the friend of\nMyers and myself.\nR. One moment friend.

See Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.,\np. 163. The sitting took place on December 11.}\nIt is clear here that the mention of Sir Oliver Lodge either\nreminded Rector of a message he had been asked to send\nto \" the Captain,\" or (on the more sceptical view) suggested\nto him that such a message would be dramatically appro-\npriate. Why did it do so ? Why did Rector (quite cor-\nrectly of course) associate the name Lodge with Phinuit's\nold nickname for Sir Oliver ? The association was not\nalways represented as operative, for when Mrs. Piper was\nin England in 1906-7 Sir Oliver had been present at a good\nmany sittings before, on his enquiring about Phinuit and\nsaying he was a friend of his, Rector asked, \" Could you\nby any possibility be the friend on earth whom he called\nCaptain ?\n\" (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIIL, p. 280).\nThe next case I have to discuss is one in which the associa-\ntion of ideas cannot be doubted, though it led to inappro-\npriate reminiscences. In England in November, 1906, Sir\nOliver Lodge arranged and superintended three sittings at\nwhich a friend of his whom I will call Mr. Richard Forrest 1\nwas present as sitter. He was introduced to the trance per-\nsonages anonymously, and Mrs. Piper was not supposed\nto have heard her sitter's name. At the second sitting the\nname Helen was given in connexion with a lame little boy,\nwho had been mentioned at the first sitting and said to be\neight or ten years old. At the same sitting Burlington is\nsaid to be Helen's father. These names and statements had\nno meaning for Mr. Forrest. At the third sitting the names\nRichard and Helen, and Robert and Helen, were connected\ntogether.\nA few days later, December 3, 1906, Sir Oliver Lodge,\nsitting alone, addressed the soi-disant mother of Mr. Forrest\nas Mrs. Forrest, so from this point the name was\ncertainly known to the trance personalities, whatever may\nhave been the case before. Later in the sitting the\nfollowing conversation occurred :\nRector. There are four children. She speaks of a daughter.\nO. J. L. Well that I do not understand.\n1\nOther names are substituted for the real ones throughout this case.\n\f156 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nR. And she calls her Helen. She must be the wife of a\nson, we think, and he has a boy whom she thinks\ngot injured. Now then, if this is so, and Richard\ndoes not know of it, it cannot get out of his mind,\ncan it \\ R.\nO. J. L. Well will she tell me which son Helen is the wife of ?\nR. Robert.\nO. J. L. Very well, Helen is the wife of Robert.\nR. Yes, and this spirit who calls himself Burling [or\nBuling] is near him\nO. J. L. That is the one you got, Burlington.\nR. Yes, they called him Cajjtain.\nO. J. L. Very well, that may be good.\nR. Yes, it is a fact. I hear it most distinctly\nLater still in the sitting the name Joseph Hird was written\nas part of a message to Mr. Richard Forrest, but without\nany obvious connexion with the rest of the message.\nMr. Richard Forrest had a cousin Robert Forrest in the\nUnited States of America, whose wife's name was Helen, and\nthe combination of the names Robert Forrest and Helen\nsuggested enquiries there. In response, the following facts\nwere elicited. Mrs. Helen Forrest's mother's name\u2014not her\nfather's\u2014was Burlington, and she, Helen, had an uncle called\nCaptain Burlington. She had no lame child, but a cousin\nabout her own age named Joseph (surname not Hird) was\nlame, and Captain Burlington had been rather interested\nin him. Mrs. Robert Forrest's father, Mr. Vance, had been\na member of the American branch of the S.P.R. and inter-\nested in its work, and was on friendly terms with Hodgson,\nwho often saw him and his family and told them about the\nmost recent Piper manifestations. Mrs. Robert Forrest\nbefore her marriage had had a sitting with Mrs. Piper when\nG. P., whom she had known in life, controlled, and also\nPhinuit. It is further almost certain that some trance per-\nsonages were aware that she had become a Mrs. Forrest,\nbecause on one occasion at a sitting with Mrs. Piper an\nenquiry had been made of the controls, who would at\nthis timej probably be Rector and Co., about Mr.\nForrest's health, on behalf, as I understand it, of Mrs.\nForrest.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 157\nExamination of Hodgson's records brings out the further\nfacts that Mrs. Forrest's father, Mr. Vance, had a sitting\nwith Mrs. Piper in 1892 and another in June, 1895. At the\nlatter G. P. and Phinuit successively acted as intermediaries\nfor Captain Burlington, for whom the sitter had asked by\nname, giving also his title. It was a very confused sitting,\nbut various things were said for Captain Burlington, and\nsaid more clearly at a subsequent sitting of Dr. Newbold's.\nThey were, however, completely wrong. Mr. Vance wrote\nto Hodgson :\nDear Mr. Hodgson. As to the enclosed interview with\nMrs. Piper, I can only say that it amounted to just\nnothing at all. Also, that the subsequent sayings when I\nwas not present, have no significance. It seemed to be\nall guessing. Nothing said by the supposed Captain\n[Burlington] about his death, his book, his friends, etc.,\nwas even approximately correct. One wonders why so\nmuch that is fraudulent gets mixed up with the sayings\nof a medium of Mrs. Piper's undoubted honesty. It would\nbe so much easier to say that Captain [B.] could not be\nfound or was unable to communicate ! Why is it neces-\nsary to falsify about him ? * * * I was intimate with\nhim [Capt. B.], and know that he could (and would if\nhe could) give me evidence of his continued existence.\nThe last sentence is something of an Irishism\u2014but you\nsee what I mean. So this interview must take its place\namong the complete failures which, as well as the mysterious\nsuccesses, challenge further enquiry.\nAt the sitting this letter refers to, the soi-disant Captain\nBurlington enquired about \" your girl Helen,\" which is of\nno evidential importance, but shows that Captain Burlington\nand Miss Helen Vance were associated for the intermediary,\nwho was at that moment Phinuit.\nG. P. continued to take an interest in \" Helen \" and her\naffairs, for on January 7, 1897, after abruptly referring to\nMr. Vance, he said :\nG. P. Helen is married. R. H. Yes, I know.\nG. P. Got a boy. R. H. I didn't know that.\nG. P. Yes, she has, I see it. Positive.\n\f158 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nA similar interpolation, irrelevant to what was being\ntalked about, occurred on March 17, 1897 :\nG. P. Did you find out about Helen's boy ?\nR. H. What Helen's boy ? [Difficulty {was} in deciphering\npartly, but partly because I thought of my sister\nEllen's boy.]\nG. P. Vance.\nR. H. No, not yet.\nG. P. Aren't you slow ?\nIn this case, then, we have a misleading track starting\nfrom the name Forrest 1\nleading through Helen to Captain\nBurlington. Rector may, through his own experience as\nintermediary, have been acquainted with this track as far\nas \" Helen.\" G. P. had all the associations. But how did\nRector get to the name of that false and futile communicator\nCaptain Burlington 1 That name relatively to Mr. Richard\nForrest was irrelevant ; as indeed were several other names\nmentioned at his sittings, but these may have been mere\nguesses, which \" Captain Burlington \" clearly was not.\n1\nHow the name Forrest was arrived at we do not know. It may, of\ncourse, have been telepathic ; but as Mrs. Piper was staying in Sir Oliver\nLodge's house at the time, and the sittings were held there, it is almost\nimpossible to be sure that the name had not leaked out through some channel\nor other and become normally known to her.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 159\nCHAPTER V.\nCommunicators.\nIn this chapter we have to consider the soi-disant personalities\ncalled by Hodgson indirect communicators ;\npersonages\nwhose appearance or statements are described by the con-\ntrol\u2014by Phinuit, G. P., Rector, Hodgson, etc. ; or for whom\nthe control acts as intermediary or amanuensis, professing\nto repeat as exactly as he can what they say. It is in this\nway, for the most part, that the friends of sitters communi-\ncate with them,1\nand communicators (like controls in the\ntrance proper) always profess to be spirits of persons who\nhave lived on earth and died\u2014unless indeed we stretch the\nmeaning to include pet animals whose spirits are in one or\ntwo cases described.\nIt will be well to approach the study of communicators\nas we did that of controls, from the point of view of their\nown theories, and to examine what they and the controls\ntell us about the process of communicating. They agree\nthat it is by no means simple and easy. There are many\ndifficulties to be overcome, and these difficulties are repre-\nsented as accounting for much of the failure in getting\nclear and satisfactory communications.\n(1) A first difficulty is that, though the communicator\nis not in control, he is liable\u2014to use Hodgson's words\n(Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 401)\u2014to suffer from \" bewilder-\n1\nThis is true, speaking generally, and especially true of the Phinuit\nregime. It is less true apparently of the early years of writing sittings.\nHodgson says (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 293) :\n\" If writing occurs at any\nsitting it usually purports to come directly from some deceased friend of the\nsitter,\" and (p. 331), \" Since the development of the automatic writing,\nmost communicators have made some attempt to express their thoughts\ndirectly through this channel.\"\n\f160 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nment \" produced \" by his relation to the '\nlight.' \" Some-\ntimes this is described as a difficulty in breathing. For\ninstance, on March 30, 1904, Hodgson and a sitter being\npresent, and Hodgson recording :\nSitter. How far away do I seem from you ?\nCommunicator. As I would express it were I in the body you\nseem about ten feet. If I could only come a little\ncloser I should U.D. better what your expressions\nare. But they won't allow me to come any nearer\njust now. They say I could not do so well because\nI could not breathe.\nA year later\u2014March 27, 1905\u2014-the same communicator,\nwhom I will call John, observed :\nI am talking as it were through a thick fog and it\noften suffocates me.\nThe difficulty is sometimes expressed in terms of mental\nbewilderment\u2014as by Bennie Junot on June 20, 1899 (see\nProceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 377) :\nI have no bother unless I try to speak, then it all\ngoes away from me before I have a chance to say\nit.\nOr again, on May 2, 1905, by the communicator John\nquoted above, whose friends questioned him a good deal\nabout the process of communication :\nJohn. I find my thoughts become clouded at times\nespecially when I am trying to recall experiences\nand narrate them at the same time. I often feel\nconfused and long to leave here for a few\nmoments in order to refresh myself. You have no\nidea how pleased I am to see you in this way.\nHowever it is rather confusing and I find my\nthoughts often wandering when I am trying to\nspeak.\n$ $\nSitter. Why is it that you can talk away so glibly and clearly\nas you are doing now about the conditions, but the\nmoment I want you to give a correct and detailed\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 161\naccount of some incident in your life you become\nconfused ?\nJohn.

I will explain\nbriefly, as I U.D. it.\nI come here delighted with the thought of seeing you.\nThe moment I enter this atmosphere I find the\nincident I have on my mind suddenly leaves me.\nI have to get some one here to take my place for a\nfew moments until I collect my thoughts again so\nto speak.\nAnother thing which confuses me greatly is your lack\nof U.D. the incidents to which I refer which have\nbeen 1\nso completely registered on my mind. Besides\nI always feel the presence of some one else with\nyou which prevents me from expressing my thought\nclearly.\nSitter. And . . . you see, J ,\nyou are talking finely and\nlike a book now, but the moment you turn to give\nyour memories your talk becomes seemingly crazy.\nJohn. It is the most exasperating thing on our side\nto give clearly our earthly recollections. It is like\na wild panorama before us when speaking in this\nway especially when giving detailed accounts of our\nearthly experiences.\nTo this category of difficulties belong expressions like \" It\nis hard to come into the light sometimes \" (see Proceedings,\nVol. XXIV., p. 462), or \" wait until I pass through the\nlight \" (same volume, p. 380), or \" the Good Priest is\nhelping me to keep my thoughts clear \" (same volume,\np. 390).\nThe mind-wandering theory is recognised by Hodgson\nwhen speaking to communicators, and on one occasion\n(October 13, 1902)\u2014when H. Sidgwick is communicating\nthrough Rector and offering specific alleged but erroneous\nrecollections, after having been told that previous statements\nwere wrong\u2014he says :\n1\nThe word \" been \" omitted at first and added above.\nL\n\f162 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nR. H. Do not hurry. Would it not be better for you to\nthink of some special private incidents between\nyourself and Mrs. Sidgwick and go over in memory\none of these again and again so that you could\nautomatically reproduce it here, even should your\nmind wander while communicating ?\nH. S. Possibly. I will try this especially.\nRector. Gone. This spirit seems weak, when trying to speak.\nIt is to be regretted that Hodgson did not try to test the\ntheory in this case by seeing whether the specific things\nstated when under the influence of mind wandering were\nor were not subsequently remembered and reaffirmed.\nThe effort of communicating is said to exhaust the com-\nmunicator as well as the control (see e.g. Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIII., p. 180, at the end of a sitting, \" He is here, but\nhe is getting weak\"). On account of this exhaustion, the\ncommunicator during a long communication sometimes\ngoes out to \" get his breath,\" to \" refresh himself.\" This\nhappened twice, for instance, during a long conversation\nbetween Miss A. M. R. and a communicating friend on\nMay 24, 1904. He says :\nI have got to go out a moment\u2014you will excuse me\n\u2014I must go out for a little change. My thoughts begin\nto wander, and if I stayed you would be displeased\nwith my wandering thoughts, so I will just go out and\nget refreshed and return instantly.\n{After silence for perhaps a minute he returns}\nThe second time he thus went out another communi-\ncator took his place for a short time,1\nwhich is a way the\nsituation was often dealt with. 2\n1\nOn returning, the first communicator here says about the second : \" 1\nmet Mr.- and he told me he just wanted to speak to you a moment while\nI was refreshing myself, so I said '\ngo ahead and ask Rector if you can\nget in.'\n\"\n2\nFor other instances of fatigue and resting, see Proceedings, Vol. XXII.,\np. 338 : \"I am too [weak] to tell it to-day. My thoughts wander . . .\ngood-bye \" ; p. 339 :\n\" Wait until he rests and I will get it clearer \" {G. P.\nthen communicates and afterwards MyersP returns} ; p. 360 :\n\" Oh yes\ndo while I can hear you clearly \" ; and Vol. XXIII., pp. 7, 8, 11, 89, 95,\netc., also below, pp. 198, 545.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 163\n(2) A second hindrance to communication arises from the\ndifficulty the control as amanuensis has in hearing or\nunderstanding the communicator. I say \" hearing\n\"\nbecause the process is generally so spoken of, and the\ndetails of such descriptions as are given are generally in\nterms of sound. We cannot, however, suppose that com-\nmunication either between two discarnate spirits or centres\nof consciousness, or between a discarnate spirit and one\noccupying the organism of the medium is by air waves\nimpinging on physical organs of hearing. Such communi-\ncation must be telepathic, since the ideas must be trans-\nmitted otherwise than through organs of sense,1\nand if the\ncontrol thinks he hears the communicator, his perception\nmust be hallucinatory. Nevertheless, it will be convenient\nto discuss the alleged difficulties of communication in the\nterms in which the controls present them to us, and this\nis for the most part in terms of hearing.\nIt may be remarked, however, that there are some things\nwhich suggest seeing rather than hearing ;\ne.g. on March\n19, 1900 {Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 416), Bennie Junot\nsays through Rector or G. P. :\nYou should see the kindly men who are teaching me\nhow to find the way to speak clearly. * * * here my\nwords form in the Gloria and they speak them out for\nme. {' Gloria '\nis a new word, and Rector on being asked\nsays Bennie means by it 'the light.'}\nAgain, an error on June 2, 1907, does not appear like\none due to mishearing (Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 254).\nMyersp communicating through Rector ends a sentence :\nin order to make it still more de finite\n{Myersp apparently in some way becomes aware that\n\" de finite \" has been written thus in two words, and\nremonstrates, at any rate Rector says :\n}\nAll right, I will. I am sorry. Rector, {and continues\nfor Myersp :\n}\nYes definite I registered a star, etc.\n1\nAs remarked in Chapter IV., the controls themselves on various occa-\nsions tell us that spirits converse by thought (see p. 132 and Appendix to\nChapter IV., p. 518).\n\f164 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nWhen Rector, on March 6, 1907, says about an attempt\nof his to draw a triangle, \" I tried to draw it as he,\" i.e.\nMyersp, \"made it\" (Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 71), he\nmeans, I imagine, that MyersP was drawing a triangle for\nhim to copy. Sometimes, moreover, the control is repre-\nsented as imitating the communicator's gestures as well as\nhis words. For instance, on May 24, 1904, Miss A. M. R.\nreports the communicator as saying through Rector in the\nvoice sitting already quoted from :\nIf the eye was opened to the spiritual and you could\nsee me as I stand here talking with you, you could see\nevery gesture I make, which is copied by Rector. He\nimitates me as I speak with you.1\nWhatever the significance of these passages may be, how-\never, there is no doubt that the usual view of the process\nexpressed by both communicators and controls is that one\nspeaks and the other hears. But it appears that the hear-\ning is liable to be imperfect and the speaking indistinct.\n\" You see she has a peculiar voice and it is difficult to hear\nall she says,\" says G. P. of a communicator on June 26, 1894\n(see Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 27). It appears also that\nfrom some unexplained causes the sounds undergo some\nchange in travelling from communicator to control. Thus,\non February 23, 1904, Bennie Junot says through the control\n(Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 587) :\nI have to speak over the line to you and I cannot\nalways make the sounds audible to those to whom I\nspeak {i.e. the controls.}\nOn March 4, 1903, the following is recorded by Hodgson\n1\nIn connection with this obtaining information from the communicator\nby sight, compare the cases quoted below of the control having visual\nhallucinations, and of communicators writing for the control to see\n(pp. 181-186).\nCompare also an incident on December 7, 1892, when Hodgson was\nenquiring of Phinuit about the whereabouts of a lost young man.\nPhinuit says, he is in Dakota. \" R. H. How can you find out that ?\nPh. These letters are written right before me ; I can see them just as plain\nas this. And another thing, he has got letters in a little desk before him\nwith that initial on top.\"\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 165\n(a communicator has been struggling to give a pet name\nthrough Rector) :\nRector. If thou couldst only realize the difficulties in registering\nsounds thou wouldst U.D. my position. R.\nR. H. Yes. I understand of course only in part. But . . .\nR. E invariably when spoken by a spirit to me through\nthe light sounds like i and vice versa.\nThe difficulty of hearing a name is referred to again on\nFebruary 25, 1903 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 555).\nVain attempts had been made to get a certain name, and\nHodgson, who was in charge of the sitting, interposed :\nR. H. The name is not right, Rector. Better get George to\nget it and not make the attempts on the machine\nin this way to get the sounds registered when it is\nso difficult.\nRectoe. We thank thee. We do not clearly see the registering\nas thou dost. We repeat by sound and it tries us\nsometimes to U.D.\nThe expedient here advocated by Hodgson of bringing\nan experienced communicator like G. P. to help an inex-\nperienced one in making Rector understand was one often\nadopted, but it, of course, adds another wheel to the\ncomplicated machine. For examples, see the Appendix,\npp. 520-524, also Chapter VII., p. 289.\nThe control's difficulty in hearing is somewhat differently\nstated in the following extract from a voice sitting of June\n30, 1902 (sitter and recorder, G. B. D.) :\n[Rector has difficulty in getting the word '\nbroader,'\nand afterwards explains to me :]\nSometimes friend, when I hear a word I hear two words\nwhich convey the same meaning\n* * * *\nSome mortals in the body, friend, wonder why these\ncommunications are not continuous\u2014I say this, Rector\n\u2014\nthey would not think so if they had to deliver them,\nlet me assure you, friend. They come intermittently and\nbrokenly\u2014Owing to the registering of the thoughts it is !\nI get their replies and sayings through the vibrations.\n\f166 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nWith this again we may compare the following message\nfrom Myersp on June 2, 1907, quoted in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIII., p. 253 :\nRectob. Myers will open first this day. He says when messages\ncome from him he understands that the language\nis not always as he would speak it, but it gathers\nso much on the way when it is being transmitted\nit sometimes loses its natural tone. Understand ?\nAnd also the following extract from the sitting of July 11,\n1904 (sitter and recorder, Hodgson). The communicator\n\" John \" says through Rector writing :\nI heard Miss talking with George but whether\nhe used his own expression or hers I cannot say. * *\nYou forget * * that oftentimes our words travel a long\ndistance before they are registered at all and when they do\nthey lose much of their significance. You seem to think we\nare just close to you when we are speaking but this is\nnot so really.\nConfusion caused by spirits talking to each other, and\nthe control not distinguishing the words intended for him,\nis mentioned on July 6. 1904 (see Appendix, p. 526-7). And\nBennie Junot complains on February 19, 1901 (see Proceed-\nings, Vol. XXIV., p. 463) of interruptions by other spirits.\nHe says to his mother :\nMy mistakes are not due to lack of memory on my\npart or lack of love for you, but due to a misunder-\nstanding on the part of the good man {i.e. Rector} who\nis good enough to repeat my words to you and other\nspirits who sometimes interrupt me when I am speaking.\nInstances of remarks of spirits to each other or of the\ncontrols' own remarks to spirits being written down, acci-\ndentally as it is sometimes alleged, are not infrequent,\nand instances have been quoted in preceding chapters.1\nPoor Rector, it seems, suffered from yet another diffi-\nculty in following the communicator's remarks, for he told\n1\nE.g. pp. 89, 92, 133, 137. See also pp. 184, 399.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 167\nHodgson on May 25, 1904, that he had partly lost his\nunderstanding of earthly language. He said :\nI have not after so many so called years in spirit life\n\u2014not a complete U.D. of the earthly words therefore I\nmay not comprehend readily their meaning.1\nOther descriptions of the control's difficulties in getting\nhold of the communicator's messages will be found in the\nAppendix, pp. 524-528.\nAn added difficulty for the control in reporting the com-\nmunicator correctly occurs, one must suppose, when the\nformer, absorbed in \" registering,\" does not attend to the\nmeaning of what the communicator says or to the remarks\nof the sitter to which the communicator replies. Rector\nrepresents this as occurring on April 12, 1897, when he\nwas acting as amanuensis for G. P. (sitter and recorder,\nHodgson). Hodgson had been speaking to G. P. about an\nincident concerning which Myers had written to him,\nnamely, the apparition of Hodgson's double to the medium\nwith whom Myers was experimenting in England. G. P.\nsuggested an explanation which did not commend itself to\nHodgson. Hodgson continued :\nR. H. Well, now, let me ask Rector himself if he knows any-\nthing about the incident of which Myers wrote.\nG. P. Yes, certainly.\nR. H. Well what do you know ?\nRectoe. You wish to speak with me ?\nR. H. Yes. I wish to ask you the question which I have\nbeen asking George, and I want him to listen also\nto your reply.\nRector. Repeat kindly. When I am speaking for some other\nspirit, I do not\nR. H. follow the sense particularly. [Hand assents]\n{When the incident is explained to Rector he says he\nknows nothing about it.}\nIn Hodgson's sittings during the Imperator regime failure\nto make communications clear to the control is generally,\n1\nFor further passages from this sitting describing Rector's difficulties\nsee Appendix to Chapter II., p. 429.\n\f168 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nI think, attributed to want of skill or experience in the\ncommunicator ; but in England in 1907 denseness on the\npart of Rector, arising it would seem from stupidity or\nignorance, seems to be assumed as a cause of failure in\ngetting communications through to the sitter.\nThus MyerSp says, on June 2, 1907 (Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIII., p. 255)\n:\nDo you realise how difficult it is to receive your words\n{presumably certain Greek words} and translate them\nclearly to Rector, who understands nothing of what I am\ntrying to tell him ?\nOn May 7, 1907 (Proceedings, Vol. XXII. , p. 391) :\nYou understand the difficulties in quoting to Rector\nwho must repeat for me.\nAnd on May 6, 1907 (Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 383) :\nIt is very clear to me my only difficulty is in making\nit quite clear to R{ector}\nIn speaking thus plainly about \" good old Rector,\"\nthrough Rector himself, MyersP was, perhaps, counting on\nhis \" not following the sense particularly.\" Compare also\na remark of G. P.'s on March 6, 1907, quoted above, p. 105.\nIt will have been noticed that the distance the sounds\nhave to travel is sometimes spoken of as one cause of the\ndifficulty the control has in hearing the communicator\ncorrectly, and under the next head it will appear as also\naffecting the hearing of the sitter by the communicator.\nWhat exact meaning is to be attached to the idea of\ndistance is as difficult to determine in the case of com-\nmunicators as in that of controls (see above, Chapter IL,\npp. 65-67), and all the more because the statements made\nabout it are not very consistent. The distance of the\ncommunicator is sometimes represented as varying, and\ncommunication as being clear only when he is near.\nThus on April 20, 1897, Rector, apparently addressing the\ncommunicator, writes :\nCome a little closer to this [Hand beckons to spirit.]\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper 's Trance Phenomena. 169\nOn July 1, 1898, the communicator says :\nI am coming to help my child if she will only hear\nme. I am very far off. I want to reach her more\nclosely\nOn November 21, 1898, another communicator :\nI am coming nearer and nearer and in a few minutes\nI will be able to hear all you say to me.\nAt Bennie Junot's first appearance\u2014June 19, 1899 (see\nProceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 356)\u2014he is represented as\napproaching :\nRector. We see among our friends here a young man who seems\ndazed and puzzled. He is not near enough to us\nfor us to give him much help at the moment but\nwill be presently * * * George is here with him and\ntrying to urge him to come closer as . . . that he\nmay see into thy world more clearly.\nBennie (through Rector). I hear ... I hear something. Where\nis my mother I want very much to see her. I\ncan breathe easier now.1\nI want to go home now . . .\nand take up my studies and go on. I see some one\nwho looks like my father * * * Father I hear\nsomething strange . . . can it be your voice.\nCommunicators are represented as receding as well as\napproaching. Thus on February 18, 1901 (Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIV., p. 451), Bennie says :\nI am getting . . . far away now.\n* * * *\nRectok. Friend it will be better to ask him again when he is\nnearer the light\nAnd on March 2, 1903, Rector says about an exhausted\nand unsuccessful communicator :\nHe is getting far away friend hope he will return refreshed.\n1\nThis may refer to the suffocating effect of the \" light,\" or to Bennie's\nmis-recollection of his last illness as affecting his breathing (see Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 414). As a matter of fact, he died of con-\ngestion of the brain.\n\f170 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nIn these cases distance and weakness seem to be\nequivalent.\nSometimes, however, nearness does not seem to help much.\nThus on April 9, 1902, Rector, in a voice sitting, said to Mr.\nDorr :\nThis spirit, friend, is very, very close to me yet I\nmay not be able to catch all the sounds of the voice.\nAnd sometimes distance seems to be no hindrance. For\nan instance, see in Appendix to Chapter II., p. 427,\nMrs. H.'s account on June 3, 1903, of speaking over the\nend of a cord, which, she thinks, is about a quarter of\na mile long. 1\nWhen Hodgson asks whether she is a quarter\nof a mile away, she replies, \" about this distance, I should\nsay,\" and as she represents Rector as being in the medium's\nbody, this means a quarter of a mile from the control as\nwell as from the sitter. Nevertheless, her communication\nwas very clear. Her views on her position varied,\nhowever, for on February 18, 1903, she had said through\nRector :\nMrs. H. Do you understand that I am looking into your face\nnow.\nR. H. I wish I could see you.\nMrs. H. Can't you . .\nIt is worth observing that Rector seems to know nothing\nabout this quarter of a mile, for on June 8, 1903, only five\ndays after the statement about it was made, the following\nconversation occurred about another communicator, K. F.,\nwho had made a sudden brief incursion during a sitting :\nRector. She has gone.\nR. H. {with the statement of June 3rd in mind} Rector, was\nshe a quarter of a mile off ? [Hand listens as\nthough not understanding.] Was she a quarter of a\nmile off ?\nRector. No she came down close to me. Here comes\nagain {after going \"out a moment\" to \"think up\nsome of the things \" he had seen}, rubbing his\nhands over his forehead.\n1\nThe full account is worth reading for the theory of communication.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 171\nThe communicator is undoubtedly constantly located in\nthe seance room and in a definite spot there, as on April 13,\n1892, when Phinuit says about G. P. :\nHe is close by (pointing with hand) He has just passed\nbehind you. He is looking over Jim's shoulder * * *\nHe wants to write. I think he will come and take my\nhand soon.\nAnd the hand in a writing sitting constantly turns to\nlisten to the communicator as though standing close by,\njust as it turns to listen to the sitter (compare Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XIII.. p. 399). Some communicators, how-\never, never seem to get near. Thus on January 21, 1902,\nH. Sidgwick is said to be \" some distance from the light\nwhich accounts for the apparently weak speech.\"\nSome of the statements quoted suggest that the ideas of\nthe trance personalities about the position and distance of\nthe communicator depended partly, at least, on whether\nhe was conceived at the moment as speaking in the usual\nway or as speaking as by a telephone, which is, I\nsuppose, the idea implied in \" speaking over a cord.\"\nAnd a further complication is introduced by the meta-\nphorical use of distance, to which I called attention in\nChapter II., pp. 65-66, and which should possibly be assumed\nin some of the statements about the position of communi-\ncators quoted above. In the following instance on March\n26, 1902, the ideas of distance and of bewilderment from\nentering the sphere of the light seem to be combined :\nCommunicator. If I seem far off or at times bewildered it is\nnot because I am really so but owing to the con-\nditions into which I enter while impressing [speak-\ning ? ]\nThe word \" seems \" again in the following passage\n(Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 25) suggests distance ha a\nmetaphorical sense. The sitting took place on June 25,\n1894, and G. P., asked if he could give the communicator's\nname, replied :\nI'll ... I don't believe it because I can scarcely hear\nher, she seems so far away.\n\f172 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nThe alleged relation of communicators to the bodily\norganism of the medium (discussed below, pp. 187-192) makes\nthe meaning to be attached to distance still more difficult\nto disentangle.\nThe presence or absence of spirits from the immediate\nneighbourhood is sometimes spoken of apart from the\nquestion of hearing them speak. Thus on January 2, 1907,\nthe following conversation between himself and Rector\n(writing) is reported by Mr. Piddington :\nJ. G. P. Could I speak to Myers now ?\nR. I'll see if I can see him about\nI'll send for him wait (Pause\u2014hand moves about\nenquiringly.) he will be here presently. I believe\nhe has gone to see if he can see Miss Johnson at\nthe other [\" Light \" is the obvious completion of\nthe unfinished sentence.]\n(Agitated movement of hand.)\nHere he is. Speak.\nSpirits are, I think, never conceived by the trance\npersonalities as otherwise than in space, and on April 5,\n1897, we find it expressly stated (by George Eliot) that\n\"it is impossible for individual spirits to be in more than\none place at a time.\" An approximation to this is, how-\never, suggested on one occasion by the communicator\nwhom I have called Mrs. H., who on July 2, 1904,\nclaimed a \" sixth sense of double consciousness,\" as\nfollows :\nR. H. What new senses have you ?\nMrs. H. I have in every way the same that I had when in\nthe body with the additional sixth sense of double\nconsciousness. For instance when I am speaking\nwith you, I am speaking with some one else at the\nsame time with another consciousness\n(3) Returning to the difficulties of communication, a third\nimpediment is due to the communicator's difficulty in hear-\ning the sitter. About this the information given us varies.\nOn April 7, 1897, George Eliot controlling says to Hodgson\nabout the communicator :\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 173\nFriend, this lady hears you, as is not usually the case.\nAnd the following remark by G. P. on June 24, 1894 (see\nProceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 34), suggests indirect hearing :\nG. P. Do you see these people.\nR. H. No, George, not we.\nG. P. Why is it possible when they are so near, yet I know\nyou do not, yet it seems as though you must . . .\nYes . . she says this distinctly and is still coming\nnearer and now requests you to speak.\nW. R. N. Can she hear me ?\nG. P. I can and I am the telephone.\nNevertheless, it is generally assumed that the communi-\ncator does hear the sitter directly as the control does,\nthough perhaps with more difficulty. And the statement\nthat the communicator is expected to hear is often\nexplicitly made. Thus on June 22, 1895, Professor\nNewbold reports G. P. as saying (Proceedings, Vol. XIV.,\np. 37) :\nHere is Stainton Moses, do you wish to see him % Well,\nnow let me give you a bit of advice. Speak slowly and\ndistinctly, making sure that you articulate properly, or in\nother words well * * * then he will answer to me all\nquestions distinctly. You see he is talking to me now.\nA conversation followed in which G. P. apparently acted\nas amanuensis, though shortly afterwards Stainton Moses\nseems to have \" controlled \" himself. On March 3, 1903,\nin a conversation quoted in the Appendix, p. 530, the com-\nmunicator says to the sitter, \" I heard you splendidly, that\ntime my dear.\"\nThe Bennie Junot sittings offer several clear examples of\nthe communicator hearing the sitter, and of the difficulties\nthat occur. Thus on March 28, 1900 {Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIV., p. 426), Bennie says to Hodgson :\nBennie. Do you hear me or do you see me or how do you do ?\nR. H. {Explains how a writing sitting is conducted.}\nBennie. Well that is queer too because I hear you and I see\nyou very clearly.\n\f174 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nOn June 28, 1904 (Vol. XXIV., p. 608), Bennie says to\nhis brother :\nI hear every word you say R but Helen got her\nwords so mixed I could not U.D. very well\nOn November 20, 1905 {Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 655),\nBennie says to his father :\nI U.D. every word you say dad you speak so clearly. I\nwish I could speak to you that way.1\nThe communicator \" John \" said on January 16, 1905,\nthrough Rector as amanuensis :\nLet me first explain to you that I am not a long way\noff\n2\nand that although I speak to another spirit who\ntakes my words to you I do see you dear and I hear\nyour voice.\nAgain on March 12, 1907, when Hodgsonp was communi-\ncating through Rector, E. M. S., replying to a remark of\nhis, said :\nE. M. S. I am very glad, Mr. Hodgson. Will you tell him so,\nRector ?\nRector. Yes he U.D. what you say.\nRector makes what seems a very explicit statement\n1\nThere is a curious conversation on November 21, 1905, between\nBennie and his mother concerning communication between them when\nno medium is present (Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., p. 659). Mrs. Junot says :\n\" When I think of you, does it bring you to me ? Bennie : Almost invari-\nably and is a great help. * * * Every thought is registered upon what\nyou call air it is ether really, and your thought waves reach me just\nas mine do you. U.D. Mrs. J. : Yes Bennie I understand. But are both\ngood and evil thoughts registered ? Bennie : Evil thoughts become puri-\nfied by the ether before they reach us.'' For registering of thoughts,\ncompare Rector on June 30, 1902 (see above, p. 165). Selection\namong thoughts by the ether, as spoken of by Bennie, based on the\nsignificance of what is said as well as on its sound, seems to open\nthe way to much possible misrepresentation and confusion !\n2\nIt will be remembered that John said six months earlier :\n\" You seem\nto think we are just close to you when we are speaking, but this is not so\nreally \" (see above, p. 166).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 175\nabout all the sitter's words being heard by the com-\nmunicator on February 26, 1902, when he says to the\nsitter, who has been explaining her want of certainty\nas to the communicator being really what he claims\nto be :\nRemember friend if statements appear which seem inco-\nherent and unsatisfactory it is in part due to the over-\nanxious state of his {the communicator's} own mind also.\nAnd remember doubting on thy part doth not improve\nmatters. Not one word from thy mortal lips escapeth\nhim or his hearing especially when he is not speaking\nhimself.\nSome further instances of the hearing, but imperfect\nhearing, of the sitter by the communicator will be found\nin the Appendix, pp. 528-533, and it is perhaps unnecessary\nto multiply examples further.\nIt may be well to call attention here to the fact that the\ncontrol's difficulty in hearing the sitter is represented as\nsimilar in kind to that of the communicator. Thus on\nApril 1, 1897 (when no communicator is concerned),\nRector says to Hodgson, who is recording and has been\ncomplaining of indistinct writing :\nWe hear ofttimes your voice in the same way, indis-\ntinctly. At times the words sound very distant, and we\ndo not grasp what you are saying.\n(4) In writing sittings a fourth source of confusion in\ncommunicating arises from the difficulty the sitter is liable\nto have in reading the writing, which is never good and is\nworse at some times than at others, and which is apt to\nbe worst of all in giving names or statements that might\nbe evidential. Rector on March 27, 1905, asserts that he\nwrites one word over another and so forth, because he\nfinds it impossible \" to listen and register carefully at\nthe same moment although \" he tries \"to do so at all\ntimes.\" Also he says on April 29, 1907, \" perhaps you\nwill read better next time * * * I can't register unless\nyou U.D. well \" {Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 164).\n\f176 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nWith the process of communicating bristling in this way\nwith difficulties real or alleged, it is, of course, easy to find\nexcuses for the frequent failures of communicators. The\nquestion is, Are these excuses valid ? We know that there\nare genuine communications\u2014this paper is, as already\nstated, based on this assumption\u2014and their imperfection is\ndoubtless due to difficulties of some sort in communi-\ncation, whether the controls' account of the nature of the\ndifficulties is correct or not. But there are other cases\nwhere it is quite certain that the communicator is not\nwhat he professes to be, and where the communications\nare false or worthless. I think hardly any one well\nacquainted with the facts would deny this ; but it is\nnever admitted by the controls, who try to explain away\neven the worst failures. We are, therefore, obliged to\nassume that all their elaborate statements about the\ndifficulties may either be consciously fabricated to cover\nup failure, or be a form of self-deception to account for it\nto themselves.\nAt this point it will be desirable to give instances of false\ncommunicators. I referred at the end of Chapter IV. to\none bad failure\u2014that of the supposed Captain Burlington\n\u2014which may serve as a specimen, and in the Appendix\n(p. 533) will be found another case, from Hodgson's records\n(in 1902), of dissatisfaction with the communicator\nstrongly expressed by a sitter, Mrs. E., and commented\non by Rector. The full record of the sittings on which\nMrs. E. comments certainly seems to bear out what she\nsays. I may add that she expresses well the impression\nproduced on me by a good many sittings. As a specimen\nI give, in the Appendix, p. 536, the record of one at which\nI was myself present as recorder in 1907. HodgsonP was\nthe communicator, and he apparently failed to recognise\nthe sitter, an intimate friend of Hodgson's in life, or to\nunderstand any clues she gave him, so that it is very diffi-\ncult to suppose that his claim to be Hodgson was justified.\nYet\u2014and it is for this reason that I have chosen this par-\nticular example\u2014in the midst of all the confusion and the\nfeeling about for facts and indications, occurs a flash of\nsupernormal perception, or so it appears, in the form of\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs, Piper's Trance Phenomena. 177\npart of a cross-correspondence. 1\nAnother variety of failure\n(on December 19, 1898) is referred to in Chapter III.,\np. 108, a propos of the blame being thrown on Rector. In\nthis case it is difficult to make out whether the control\nregards any one communicator as having tried to express\nhimself, or whether crowds of relations and friends are\nrepresented as having been clamouring incoherently.\nWe are not, however, limited to inference from the failure\nof communicators for evidence that they are sometimes not\nwhat they profess to be, for Dr. Stanley Hall in 1909 took\na short cut to positive evidence by deceiving the control\nHodgsonp ,\n2\nand asking for a niece, Bessie Beals, who had\nnever existed, but who was nevertheless produced at several\nsittings. She said little at first, but communicated more\nfully by the third sitting, and connected specific memories\nwith the sitter\u2014mainly, though not entirely, such as might\nbe suggested by his statements and questions. When in\nthe end Dr. Hall told HodgsonP that he (Hall) had been\ndeceiving him, and that there was no such person as\nBessie Beals, Hodgsonp maintained her reality. The\nfollowing is the report of the conversation (Studies in\nSpiritism, p. 254) :\nDr. Hall. Well, what do you say to this, Hodgson. I asked\nyou to call Bessie Beals, and there is no such\nperson. How do you explain that ?\nHodgsonp\n. Bessie Beals is here, and not the \u2014\n{Note by Miss Tanner.}\n[At this point we laughed and I made some remark\nto the effect that that was just what we had\nsaid Hodgson would do, and the hand continued\nthus,]\n1\nThe cross-correspondence on \" Cup \" described by Mr. Piddington in\nProceedings, Vols. XXII., p. 179 ;\nXXV., p. 304. There is also some reason\nto think that the communicator showed knowledge of the name of the sitter's\nhusband (see Vol. XXII., pp. 186, 188). For other almost certainly false\ncommunicators, see Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 37-42 and 57.\n2\nStudies in Spiritism, p. 171, etc. Dr. Hall's investigation, intended\nto be limited in duration and scope, did not impose on him any need of\nretaining the confidence of the trance personalities (see above, Chapter I.,\npp. 13-14).\nM\n\f178 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PART\nHodgsoNj,. I know a Bessie Beals. Her mother asked about her\nbefore. Mother asked about her before.\nDr. Hall. I don't know about that, Hodgson. Bessie Beals is\na pure fiction.\nHodgsonp\n. I refer to a lady who asked me the same thing\nand the same name.\nDr. Hall. Guess you are wrong about that, Hodgson.\nHodgsonp . Yes, I am mistaken in her. I am mistaken. Her\nname was not Bessie, but Jessie Beals. 1\nWe can only say about this explanation that it is not\nplausible. Like G. P.'s explanation of the appearance of\nthe false Imperator (see above, p. 90)\u2014also a communi-\ncator, by the way\u2014it breaks down over the details of the\ncommunication. Dr. Hall might accidentally have hit on\nthe name of a previous communicator, but it is very\nunlikely that this communicator would have had memories\nappropriate to Dr. Hall's fictions and have admitted him\nas her uncle.\nIt must, then, be admitted that some communicators are\nnot genuine, while other communicators offer evidence of\nidentity which, if it does not necessarily come from the\nspirits they claim to be, at least shows knowledge of those\nspirits which cannot have reached Mrs. Piper's mind by\nnormal means. This being so, is it possible to find a\nformula which will express the relation to the control of\nall communicators\u2014both successful and unsuccessful ? Are\nthey or are they not essentially different ? Is the unsuc-\ncessful communicator a figment of the control's imagina-\ntion, while the successful communicator is an independent\nentity ? If so, can we draw a definite line between them ?\nAre we to judge a communicator, rej)resenting himself as\nthe same, to be on some days a figment and on others\nan independent centre of consciousness, according as he\nis unsuccessful or successful in producing a plausible\nsemblance of the person he professes to be ? And if the\ncommunicator is a figment, is the control conscious of it, or\n1\nIt is noticeable that notwithstanding this explanation Mrs. Piper seems\nto have seen Bessie Beals in the waking-stage of this sitting. \" Hello\n\u2014\nthere's Bessie,\" she said (op. cit., p. 257).\n\u00bb\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 170\nis he himself deceived ? In other words, what is the\ndegree of independence of control and communicator ?\nAre two more or less independent centres of consciousness\ninvolved ; whether consciousnesses of separate individuals\nor different centres of consciousness of Mrs. Piper ? Or\nis the communicator a dream or hallucination of the\ncontrols 1 Or is the dramatic presentation of him pure\nplay-acting by the control ?\nThere is no doubt that the dramatic distinction between\ncontrol and communicator was in general maintained with\nmuch consistency, though there were cases\u2014as is natural,\nperhaps, on any hypothesis\u2014in which it was difficult for\nthe sitter to distinguish between them. In general, control\nand communicator each plays his appropriate part at\nsittings where both are stated to be present, and some-\ntimes incidents occur which show that to each is at least\nattributed an independent memory. For instance, on\nMarch 26, 1902, Hodgson tells Rector at the beginning\nof the sitting that it is intended to ask the expected\ncommunicator, whom I will call Phil, to find in the other\nworld a Mr. Hackley, and explanations are given as to\nwho Mr. Hackley is and why it is desired to get into\ntouch with him. This was before Phil was supposed to\nbe present. When later in the sitting Phil himself, who\nis communicating through Rector, is spoken to about it\nhe appears not to know who Mr. Hackley is, and the\nexplanation has to be given over again.\nBut it is difficult to find anything in all this beyond the\nscope of acting. The dramatic form might be assumed, and\nwhat we want to know is whether it is ever anything more\nthan the way in which the control chooses to present what\nhe has to say. We want to know whether the control ever\nreally feels the communicator to be a being with a con-\nsciousness and a will independent of his own, and whether,\nwhen he attributes to him a bodily form and a definite\nposition in space, he really seems to himself to see him ;\nand, similarly, whether when the communicator is repre-\nsented as speaking, the control ever really seems to himself\nto hear him. If the externality from the control's point of\nview is established, we must further ask to what extent\n\f180 Mrs. Henry Sidgioich. [pabt\nif at all, it is reciprocal. Is there ever a separate con-\nsciousness which in any degree feels itself to be actually\ntaking the part in the drama which the control attributes\nto the communicator ? Or are the control's perceptions\nmerely hallucinations\u2014representations of its own ideas\nveridical or otherwise ? For if the communicator does seem\nto the control external to itself, as our dream personages\noften do, this would, of course, not solve for us the\nquestion whether it is anything really external. A Bessie\nBeals might appear as real as a G. P. to the control. And,\non the other hand, if the whole dramatic form were play-\nacting, it might still be the framework in which veridical\ncommunications come to us. In fact, the question of what\nis the nature of the communicator as dramatically pre-\nsented to us, is distinct from the question whether there\nis any real communicator in the background. A real com-\nmunicator\u2014say G. P.\u2014might be the source of information\ndisplayed, and even the model for its dramatic presenta-\ntion, without being either an actor in the drama presented\nto us or in any way responsible for it.\nIt will simplify matters if we concern ourselves for the\npresent only with what I may call the dramatic communi-\ncator and his true relation to the control. We may put the\nquestion as to what the control's impressions are in the\nform : Does the trance control see and hear the communi-\ncator with the same degree of externalisation that Mrs.\nPiper evidently does in the waking-stage ? The externalised\nquality of the waking-stage visions is, as will be seen in the\nnext chapter, so manifest that it gives us a useful standard\nof comparison. I think it hardly possible that any one\nshould read records of waking-stage visions without\nrealising that to the seer they are entirely objective\u2014that\nshe really believes herself to be seeing and hearing, as\noutside herself, what she describes. I am quite sure that\nno one could be present during a waking-stage of any\nimportance without realising it. There is no acting\nabout it any more than there is in the hallucinations\nof delirium, or, for that matter, than there is in our\nordinary dreams.\nThe trance controls are more sophisticated than the\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 181\nwaking-stage Mrs. Piper. On any hypothesis as to what\nthey are, we can hardly, after what we have seen in\nprevious chapters, exonerate them from a tendency to act\na part (even if they believe it to be their own part), and\nto make what they affirm about their experiences conform\nto a theory. It is therefore much more difficult to feel\nsure that when they speak of a communicator as external\nto and independent of themselves, as occupying a definite\nposition in space, and so forth, they are expressing the\nsimple truth as it appears to them at the moment.\nNevertheless, I think there is sometimes evidence, apart\nfrom their assertion, pointing to its being true, even\nallowing for good acting. Such evidence is naturally\nmore easy to find in voice sittings, when\u2014the whole\nupper part of the body coming into play\u2014a greater range\nof expression is possible than in writing sittings.\nPerhaps the most striking case is one given in Hodgson's\nfirst report on Mrs. Piper (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp.\n104-5). The sitting took place on December 28, 1888,\nand the sitter and recorder was the Rev. W. H. Savage,\nbrother of the Rev. Minot J. Savage. Phinuit was, as\nusual in those days, controlling, but in his notes, contrary\nto the custom that has been usually adopted, Mr. Savage\nspeaks of Phinuit as Mrs. Piper, and uses the feminine\npronoun. He reports as follows :\nAfter several remarkable sayings she {i.e. Mrs. Piper\nas Phinuit} suddenly said \" Ah ! Here is somebody\nfrom outside\u2014he says his name is Robert West.1\nHe\nwants to send a mesage to your brother.\" Then, after\na moment, \" I wrote an\u2014he is writing it and I am\nreading for you\u2014an AR-TI- article A-G-A against his\nW- work in the AD-V- Advance. What the dickens is\nthe Advance V I said \"It is a paper.\" * * * I said to her\n\" Can you see him ?\n\" \" Yes \" she replied. \" How does\nhe look ?\n\" I asked. \" He has greyish blue eyes, a beard,\na rather prominent nose, a firm mouth, a large forehead,\nand he brushed his hair up, so,\" brushing my hair with\n1\nRobert West, as we learn from Hodgson's report, had previously\ncommunicated directly and indirectly for another sitter, Miss E. G. W.\n\f182 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nher hand, to show the fashion of his. \" He is of medium\nbuild, rather tall.\" * * *\n{So far is quoted from the account of the sitting written\non the same day. The following was added by the sitter\non July 5, 1890.}\nWhen Mrs. Piper began speaking of Mr. West, she turned\nwith a surprised look, as at an unlooked for interruption,\nwith the remark \" Ah ! here is, etc.\" When I asked for\na description she turned in the same direction and said,\n\" Hold up your head and let me look at you.\" Then she\nwent on to describe as given in the statement.\nIt is a pity that these last touches, so important from\nour present point of view, were not included in the\noriginal record, but if we can trust the accuracy of Mr.\nSavage's observation and memory, Mr. West must have\nappeared to Phinuit as a realistic human figure capable\nof movement and standing in the room. The appearance\nmust have been what we should have called, if Mrs. Piper\nhad had her eyes open (which she doubtless had not),\na waking visual hallucination. Whether it also affected\nthe sense of hearing is not clear, but the somewhat\nunusual feature of writing by the communicator for the\ncontrol to see 1\nsuggests that it was not auditory.\nAnother instance of what appears to be a vision by\nPhinuit of the communicator as standing in the room\noccurred on March 18, 1892 (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\np. 558). Phinuit, who is talking for Ruthie, the baby\ndaughter of Dr. and Mrs. Thaw, says :\n\" There she is\nstanding by Aleck. See!\" and a little later remarks:\n\" Here's this little girl talks just as if she were alive.\"\nCompare also Phinuit's description of G. P.'s position\non April 13, 1892, quoted above (p. 171), and the following\non April 22. 1892, as noted by Mrs. Howard :\n[When George went out and stood beside Phinuit and\n\"rested\" for a while {after controlling}, while Phinuit\nwas talking he (Phinuit) took up the little screen for\nthe lamp that G. had given me and turned it round\n1\nFor an instance of this in a writing sitting, see extract from sitting\nof April 20, 1897, Appendix, p. 544.\n\fLXXI.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 183\nso that the flowers on it should be seen by anyone\nstanding behind him. He, Phinuit, then said \" he is\nmuch pleased that you brought this, he wants me to\nhold it up so that he can see it, he is smiling \" * * *\n]\n1\nThe localisation in the actual surroundings is less clear\nin the following two cases, but the detailed description in\nother respects makes up for this. The first is from Pro-\nceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 66-67. Hodgson, ' after reporting\na strikingly accurate description given by Phinuit on\nJanuary 20, 1888, of a peculiar mark in the colouring of\none of the eyes of his friend \" Q,\" continues :\nI asked Phinuit how he obtained the information\nabout the eyes. He said that \" Q \" was standing close\nto him and showing him her right eye so that he could\nsee it clearly, and saying that that was what I wanted.\nThis peculiarity in the eye was what I had in mind\nwhen I asked Phinuit for a detailed description of\n\"Q's\" face.\nThe second is from Professor Newbold's paper (Proceed-\nings, Vol. XIV., p. 37), and is a description by Phinuit of\nseeing W. Stainton Moses on June 22, 1895 :\nPh. Do you know Billie, George is talking to such a\nfunny looking man ; he has a long double coat with\na large collar and cape,\u2014a long beard, large eyes\nwith drooping lids, [fairly shouts with laughter.]\nGeorge is shaking his fingers at me.2\nInstances of Phinuit apparently seeing the medium's\nspirit while he is controlling are given in Chapter II.,\ne.g. \" talking to an old lady \"\n(p. 68), \" got an ugly\nscowl on her \"\n(p. 69). Though this is not a halluci-\nnatory vision of a communicator, it is in some ways\nanalogous.\n1\nIn this case, however, though Phinuit certainly describes G. P. as though\nhe saw him, he appears to locate him behind himself. For examples of\nthis kind of vision, see Proceedings. Vol. III., p. 114, and Vol. X., p. 90.\n2\nProfessor Newbold tells us that this description of Stainton Moses\nanswers to the notion he had of him at the time, derived from portraits.\n\f184 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\nThere is similar evidence for Rector as control in voice\nsittings seeing the communicator as external to himself.\nThus on April 9, 1902, sitter and recorder G. B. D. :\n[Hand stretched out and moves circling round.]\nRectoe. She passes round on that side.\nCommunicator. \" I think I'll have to\u2014 \"\nG. B. D. What ?\nRector. I did not catch that friend. Oh, she comes back to\nrepeat it ; she says \"I do not want you to lose\nanything ! I was coming a little closer, going round\non the other side.\"\nEarlier in the same sitting, Rector's language and\nactions seem to show that he is really seeing a figure of\na lady, though whether she is a communicator or a\ncasual intruder is not clear from the extracts from the\nrecord which are all we have. Rector had been speaking\nfor a male communicator, and the record proceeds thus :\n[Rector to G. B. D.] His voice seems faint somehow.\n[Rector, not to G. B. D.] Why of course I know you ! [Smiles\nand then explains to G. B. D.] I just recognized\nthis lady. [As before to other personality] Why, I\nwas so absolutely [word lost] in what I was saying\nthat I did not really notice you. [To G. B. D.\nagain] There are two things of the utmost import-\nance, friend ; and those I will clear up, or endeavour\nto do so, at our next meeting.\nAgain on June 17, 1902, sitter and recorder G. B. D , we\nhave :\nR. This spirit is very near to me, friend.\nG. B. D. What spirit ?\nR. Thy brother. G. B. D.

Still\nthere are instances in writing sittings where the circum-\nstantial details given, or gestures of the hand alone, add\nsomething to the mere statement that the communicator is\nseen, and give an air of reality to the vision. We may take\nas an example an incident on December 28, 1905 (see\nProceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 7), during Hodgson's first\nappearance after his death. Rector writing says of him :\nHe holds in his hand a ring . . . He is showing it to\nyou. Cannot you see it, friend ?\n1\nTwo incidents on April 26, 1898, give a dramatically vivid\nimpression of externalised visions by the control\u2014the second\nbeing of a deceased pet dog. The control was a private\ncontrol, the young son of the sitters, Mr. and Mrs. B., and\nMiss Edmunds was taking notes. The control's grand-\nmother had been communicating, and the sitters had just\nchanged places and rearranged themselves. The record\ncontinues :\nControl, don't walk over Grandma, don't walk over Grandma\ndear do not walk all over Grandma.\nSit tees. We are so sorry\nControl. Yes dear all right now.\nSitters. We did that so that Papa could sit dowD more.\nControl. I am so glad. Yes Bonnie Bonnie\nSitters. What Bonnie is that. What is that once more ?\n[Hand pointed to Mr. B.]\nControl. Paw on Papa. Paw on Papa.\nSitters. Have you something more to say to Papa ?\nControl. Come here sir sit down and wait hold him Ruth\n{control's dead sister} until I get through Mamma\nMamma come and see him as he looks now.\n[\" Bonnie \" {the sitters note} was {control's} St.\nBernard dog. He had a habit, when sitting on his\nhaunches near one of us, of putting his paw up\n1\nCompare Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 71, where Rector writes of MyersF :\n'\nHe holds up a circle.\"\n\f186 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nagainst us for recognition. The \" Come here sir\n'\nis very characteristic of {control}, and also Mrs.\nPiper's hand as she beckoned the dog at the same\ntime. Bonnie died * * * a year after {control}\npassed out, and since his death had not before been\nmentioned at any sitting.]\nOther examples of seeming externalisation in writing\nsittings are given in the Appendix, pp. 544-546.\nFrom the communicator also we get similar statements\ndefining the place in the room which he occupies. Thus\non April 15, 1898, the sitter having changed her place, the\ncommunicator says through Rector writing :\nYes now you walked right over me Auntie . . . did\nyou not see me holding up my hand to you.\nAnd again on January 28, 1907, when HodgsonP was\ncommunicating through Rector writing, Mr. Piddington\ngot up suddenly to move something, whereupon HodgsonP\nsaid :\nHodgsonp\n. You must not step so near.\nJ. G. P. I'm so sorry ; I forgot.\nHodgsonp\n. I am where you went then while I am speaking.\nThe following is also, perhaps, an instance\u2014on February\n26, 1902 :\nDearest do you know what I am doing here. I am\nstanding beside Rector telling him what to say for me.\nAnother example is given in the Appendix, p. 546. In\nthe present connexion, however, the value of what com-\nmunicators say is difficult to estimate, for as we can\nonly know their sentiments through the controls, we can\nhardly take what they say as evidence of separate and\nindependent consciousness of localisation.\nMoreover, we must in any case be cautious in our inter-\npretation of mere description without action, even when\ndetails are given, for they may be intended to be sym-\nbolic and not to represent anything actually seen ;\nas, for\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 187\ninstance, when the communicator, Isaac Thompson, says on\nDecember 13, 1905 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 165) :\nI hold this bottle in my hand for identification * * * I\nhad much to do with them when in your world.\nThe control in this case says nothing about seeing the\nbottle.\nIn cases like those I have quoted, the control in the\ntrance proper, like Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage, seems\nclearly to conceive a communicator outside itself with an\nindependent consciousness of its own and a definite position\nin space. The control conceives itself as in occupation of\nMrs. Piper's body, and the communicator as outside that\nbody and with a body or semblance of a body of its own.\nIt sometimes sees the communicator and sometimes hears\nhim, and sometimes both.\nBut things occur at other times which are very diffi-\ncult to reconcile with this conception of a communicator\nin no way concerned with Mrs. Piper's organism\u2014things\nwhich, in fact, suggest either some confusion or fusion\nbetween itself and the communicator in the mind of the\ncontrol, or some sort of joint control. One of these\nthings is that communicators are apt to affect the\nhandwriting. An example of this on December 2, 1898,\nwill be found in the Appendix, p. 528, and the follow-\ning on November 15, 1899, is a case in point. The sitter\nand recorder was Hodgson, and Rector was the control\nwho acted as amanuensis. The trance-personages had\nbeen prescribing for an absent lady who had asked for\nmedical advice, and, this being finished, the conversation\nproceeds as follows :\n.Rector. Unless thou hast further inquiries to make this day\nwe will release this directing spirit {presumably the\ndoctor} and pass on to other things\nR. H. Yes, very good.\nRector. Gone.\nCommunicator.

[R]\n{Hodgson annotates as follows} : [The influence of the\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 189\ncommunicators on the writing was very noticeable\nin the case of Mr. and Q. The writing was\nmuch restrained and in different ways. Thus when\nRector was writing for Q. the writing tended to\napproximate to that produced in previous years\nwhen Q was producing the writing directly herself.\nBut to-day apparently Rector was really the im-\nmediate amanuensis.]\nI take it on Hodgson's authority that Rector was\nacting as amanuensis, for as he was present his means of\njudging were better than ours are. But I confess that from\nthe record alone, omitting Hodgson's comment, I should\nnot have felt at all sure that Mr. D and \" Q.\" were\nnot regarded by the trance consciousness as controlling\nand writing for themselves. Either way they seem to be\nconceived as in some way influencing the organism, for it\nis difficult to suppose that cramped handwriting was\nintended merely as an imitation of their manner. In\ncertain cases it is perhaps possible to suppose something\nof the kind. When HodgsonP communicates, the hand-\nwriting is sometimes larger than when Myersp does (in\nneither case is it like the handwriting of the supposed\ncommunicator 1\n), and it might be said that this is because\nthe control is trying with the hand to indicate Hodgson's\nmore boisterous manner.2\nBut a cramped handwriting\nhardly seems a good way of imitating the manner of\nMr. D\u2014\u2014 or of \" Q.\" If deliberately adopted by the\ncontrol it can only be symbolic, not imitative ; and if\ndue to direct influence of the communicator on the writing,\nthen\u2014if control and communicator are distinct conscious-\nnesses\u2014there is some sort of combined control.\nAn incident related in Miss Verrall's \" Report on the\nJunot sittings of Mrs. Piper\" {Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.,\n1\nSome have thought that there was sometimes a faint approximation\nto Myers's handwriting, which was known to the medium and had\nsome marked features.\n2\nOn June 2, 1907 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 253) the small\nhandwriting appears to have been only adopted for Myersp when Rector\nwas writing for him in the first person, not when he was reporting\nin the third person what he said.\n\f190 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PAET\np. 530) illustrates the point still more clearly. It occurred\non February 23, 1903. Miss Verrall notes :\nAt this point with the appearance of Hugh Irving {Mr.\nJunot's deceased black coachman}, the writing changes\nand \" there is a tendency to make extra curling loops\nto the strokes.\" When the sitters complain of illegibility\n{\"owing to the curious looping\"} Rector apologizes on\nthe ground that \" he (that is H. I.) speaks queerly.\" It\nappears that peculiarity of speech on the part of a\ncommunicator is here represented by peculiarity of writing\non the part of the control.\nThis curly writing was used, it should be observed, only\nduring Hugh's first two remarks. When its illegibility is\nremarked on, it is given up. Hodgson notes on his original\ntranscript that presumably Hugh gave these two sentences\ndirect to Rector, and that afterwards apparently G. P.\nacted as intermediary\u2014intermediary between Hugh and\nRector, I suppose he means. When Hugh had once\npreviously communicated (on February 11, 1902), no such\npeculiarity in the handwriting seems to have appeared.\nSometimes the effect of excitement in the communicator\nis represented as producing illegible writing on the part\nof the control. The following extracts illustrate this and\nalso Hodgson's acceptance of the theory :\n(Feb. 26, 1900.)\nHodgson recording for several sitters, friends of the com-\nmunicator called above Phil. Rector writing.\n[Writing very scrawly and not read at the time through-\nout.]\nR. H. Rector, please explain to Phil that he must be abso-\nlutely calm. Otherwise the writing cannot be read.\nWe cannot possibly continue unless the writing is\nbetter, and the machine will not produce this clearly\nunless all is peaceful.\nR. We . . . we . . . will call our leader. Wait for us.\n[Slight pause. Writing resumes more slowly and\nclearly.]\n{Two days later. February 28, 1900, same sitters and\ncommunicator.}\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 191\nR. H. Rector, please, the writing seems to be deteriorating.\nR. Well I am absorbed in his sayings which accounts\nfor it. I am anxious to keep him quite calm and\nclear as I am giving all my attention to him. But\nspeak kind friend if I am not clear in my own\nduty.\nA similar fusion of control and communicator seems to\nbe implied when the communicator uses the hand for\npurposes other than writing. An instance of its being\nused to represent the communicator looking round the\nroom is given by Sir Oliver Lodge in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIII., p. 188. It occurred on November 12, 1906, at\none of the Isaac Thompson sittings in England, Mr. E.\nThompson being the recorder :\nMrs. Thompson. Can you remember this room ?\nCommune. Give me time and I'll see. [Hand waves about and\nseems to look round everywhere] Can it be the\nnursery, Sue dear.\nMrs. T. Yes it's the old^nursery, where^we have been so often\ntogether.\nIt might be asked in this case whether Isaac Thompson\nwas not himself controlling, but I think it is clear that\nit is not so conceived by the trance personality. The full\nrecord shows that Isaac Thompson said at the beginning :\n\" Remember if you cannot see me, I am standing here\nbeside you, impressing my thoughts upon this sensitive\nplate\"; and that a little later he complained of not being\nable to make Rector write the pet name by which he\nused to call one of his daughters. The sitters apparently\nassumed throughout that Rector was controlling.\nAn instance of a more ambiguous kind is recorded by\nHodgson on April 8, 1903, as follows :\nCommr. I had a red mole on my shoulder * * * I'll show\nyou . . .\n[Hand touches over my left shoulder, and presses a\npoint at back.]\nR. H. Back of left shoulder ?\nCommr. Yes where Rector put his head.\n\f192 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\nR. H. \" His hand.\"\nComme. head. Wait I'll watch him.\nR. H. Yes. [Hand feels again in same place on my left\nshoulder.]\nCommr. Yes there.\nThis looks to me suspiciously like a change in the point\nof view in the middle\u2014the communicator beginning\nby conceiving himself as touching the spot and then\nremembering that it is not he but Rector who should\ncontrol the hand. There is perhaps a similar ambiguity\non March 26, 1902, when, as recorded by Hodgson, a\ngesture of affection (this interpretation is mine) seems to be\nmade with the hand by the communicator. It is stated\nthat the \" hand draws block book back and rests a moment\non wrist of sitter \"\u2014the sitter being the communicator's\nfather.\nAnother way in which the hand is affected by the com-\nmunicator is seen when the latter's excitement is expressed\nby movements of the hand. Perturbation of the hand is\noften mentioned in the records, and often concerns, or may\nconcern, the control only\u2014as, for instance, when it occurs\nwith a change of control or a change of communicator, or\nwhen the control at length succeeds in grasping what the\ncommunicator is trying to say, or perceives that the com-\nmunicator has grasped some idea, 1\nor when the sitter fur-\nnishes a piece of information. But there are other times\nwhen it is obviously the communicator's excitement which\nis represented by the perturbation of the hand. For\ninstance, on December 13, 1905, at a sitting recorded\nby Hodgson when Rector was the control and Isaac\nThompson the communicator (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.,\np. 166):\nR. H. I am an old friend of Professor Lodge\nCommr. LODGE.\nR. H. Yes.\n1\nFor examples, see Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 373, where Rector grasps\nthe name Abt Vogler, and Appendix, p. 533.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 193\nCommr.

Drugs ... Do not go. Wait for me. LIVERSTOOL.\netc.\nAnd further on in the same sitting :\nR. H. I am interested in Psychical work and sent Mrs.\nPiper many years ago to England,-\u2014don't you\nremember seeing Mrs. Piper ?\nCommr. Piper ?\nR. H. Yes and the [Perturbation in hand.]\nCommr. Oh yes I remember Piper. Was Mrs. Piper a medium,\nan American lady ?\nIn cases of the communicator affecting the movements of\nthe hand, whether in writing or otherwise, it seems probable\nthat the control is aware of the fact ;\nindeed, he sometimes\nclearly is. But the question remains, Does he consciously\nexercise volition in the matter ? If not\u2014if, for instance, he\nis surprised when the hand goes through motions of looking\nround the room, or when queer speaking results in queer\nwriting\u2014there must either be a telepathic influence from\nthe communicator expressing itself through the control as\na \" motor automatism,\" or there must be something of\nthe nature of joint control by two or more distinct centres\nof consciousness. In either case something must happen\nlike what happens in automatic writing without trance,\nwhen the normal consciousness of the writer is aware that\nwriting is going on, but not aware of directing it. It will\nbe observed that this joint control, if there be joint control,\nis different from the divided control described in Chapter\nII. There there was a division of the organism between\ntwo controls ; Phinuit was said to occupy the head and\nsome other control the hand. In joint control, control\nand communicator affect the same motor centres concerned\nwith the same hand and affect them simultaneously, so that\nthe action of the communicator modifies that of the control.\n\f194 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nOn the other hand, if the control is solely responsible for\nthe movements of the hand, he is playing a part. He is\napparently \" trying to imitate \" the communicator, as\nPhinuit said to Dr. Thaw (see above, Chapter III., p. 82) ;\nand as in a writing sitting action is limited to the hand, the\nimitation becomes partly symbolic. But there is of course\nyet another possible alternative. The appearance of in-\nfluence by the communicator on the movements of the hand\nmay be an artifice more or less consciously employed by\nthe control to make the drama clearer to the sitter.\nThere is a passive form of apparent fusion of control and\ncommunicator in connexion with Mrs. Piper's organism\u2014\na\nform not concerned with motor centres\u2014of which the con-\ntrol is undoubtedly aware. This is the experiencing by the\ncontrol\u2014so it is alleged\u2014of the pain suffered by the com-\nmunicator in his or her fatal illness. It is liable to happen\nin voice sittings and at a communicator's first appearance\n\u2014\nnot, I think, at subsequent appearances. Controls also\nsometimes suffer from a recurrence of their own pain (e.g.\nthe case referred to in the footnote to Chapter I., p. 26), and\nthis is sometimes represented as the result of association on\nreturning to earthly conditions. But it is not at all clear\nwhy it should happen to the control when the person who\nsuffered was the communicator. Symptoms accurately re-\npresented serve, of course, as evidence of identity, but for\nevidential purposes description would generally serve as\nwell as acting\u2014as in the case of \" Kakie \" Sutton (Decem-\nber 8, 1893, see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 485)\u2014and in the\ncases I now refer to the control represents himself as not\nmerely acting the part of a sufferer, but as suffering. A\ngood example of this is recorded in Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\np. 537, as having occurred on February 14, 1892, at Dr. and\nMrs. Thaw's first sitting, when their little girl Ruthie com-\nmunicated through Phinuit. I give the relevant part of the\nrecord in the Appendix, p. 548.\nThere is another variety in the relation between control\nand communicator which further complicates matters, which\nwe may call assisted control. The communicator is some-\ntimes represented as controlling to the extent of doing the\nwriting or talking himself with assistance, or sometimes\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 195\napparently without assistance but while Rector \" holds the\nlight.\" This appears to be different from either joint\ncontrol or divided control. One type of assisted control is\nreported by Miss A. M. R. in Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\np. 113, as follows :\nWhen my friend H. takes control of the medium it\nseems to be quite a different personality {from Phinuit},\nalthough there is something in the voice and manner of\nspeaking that is like Dr. P. The voice, however, is not\nnearly so loud. When I asked him why this was, he\ntold me that Dr. P. was right by him and that he\ncould not stay a moment without his help. In a great\nmany little ways he is quite like what my friend used\nto be when living. * * *\nAnother interesting case of assisted control\u2014an important\ncase in its bearing on the whole theory of the process of\ncontrolling\u2014occurred on March 3, 1894, and is quoted by\nHodgson in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 505-510. 1\nOn\np. 504 the sitter, Mr. Charles Heywood, gives his description\nof what occurred as follows :\n{The sitting} was devoted wholly to automatic writing.\nPhinuit was very quiet, and \" George Pelham \" seemed\nto be the controlling and directing intelligence. Of course,\nnearly all the writing was done by the \" D. P. B.\n\"\nintelligence, but Pelham seemed to supervise, and at times\ntook the pencil himself and assured me that he was\nlooking after things. D. P. B. spoke of Pelham as\nstanding within \" ear-shot,\" if such a term may be used.\nIt must be noted about this case that Hodgson, who was\npresent during part of the sitting, expresses the opinion (Vol.\nXIII., p. 505) that \" Probably G. P. was acting as amanuensis\nthroughout,\" which illustrates the difficulty of interpreting\nthe relations of control and communicator in certain cases,\nand shows that different sitters may take different views of\nthe dramatic situation. It is possible that Hodgson's view\n1\nI have already quoted from it in discussing the control's conscious-\nness of writing in Chapter II., p. 48.\n\f196 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nof this case was influenced by the conclusions he had come\nto as to the modus operandi in general, for the report of\nthe sitting, so far as it is given, certainly seems to me to\nfit best with Mr. Heywood's view of what was supposed to\nbe occurring. And this view seems to be definitely sup-\nported by other cases. For example, on February 17, 1903,\nwhen Hodgson was himself sitter and recorder, a com-\nmunicator, who had communicated on a previous occasion,\nrather unexpectedly turned up and wrote a message to his\nmother. Hodgson asked :\nR. H. Rector, did he write himself ?\nRector. He did while Prudens held him. He U.D. wonder-\nfully well.\nFor a similar case on November 22, 1905, see Appendix,\np. 523.\nThe amount of assistance given in assisted control seems\nto vary, and sometimes consists apparently in little more\nthan Rector being needed to open and close the sitting.\nDifferent degrees of it are represented in a sitting on\nMay 24, 1904, at which Miss A. M. R., whose description\nof the nature of her friend H.'s control is quoted above,\nwas sitter and recorder. It was a voice sitting,\nand she took down what was said stenographically. At\none point Dr. Oliver communicating says :\n\" Rector is\nrepeating for me my sentences as best he can.\" Yet\nwhen Dr. Oliver takes leave and Rector returns, he asks\nthe sitter :\n\" Friend hath the doctor finished,\" as if he\ndid not exactly know what was going on. (For fuller\nextracts from this part of the sitting, see Appendix to\nChapter III., pp. 490-491.) Then a recently deceased friend\nof the sitter's communicates\u2014Rector introducing him\nand then stepping aside\u2014and in answer to some question 1\nsays :\nOh Rector is holding the light : I could not, they\nwould not let me do that, dear. Not quite now, but I\nmay be able to later. But they have to support the\nlight, some friend has to look after it.\n1\nThe question is not recorded, but the sitter thinks she asked whether\nthe communicator was talking through Rector.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 197\nThe exact significance of this, however, is doubtful, for\nafter a long conversation \" Rector returns \" saying : \"I\ncame to close the light.\" Some conversation between\nhim and the sitter follows, in the course of which Rector\nsays :\nI have been talking for thy friend and I may use\nsome of his expressions. He teaches me much in\nlanguage.\nSo perhaps it was Rector talking all the time, in spite\nof his having \" stepped aside \" when the friend came. A\ndeceased relative of the sitter's communicates after this,\nand in his case Rector changes from reporting what he\nsays in the third person to speaking for him in the first\nwithout any transition\u2014with no \" stepping aside \" or return-\ning. I think that in a sitting such as this it is difficult not\nto suppose that there is some shifting in the point of view of\nthe trance consciousness.\nLight is thrown on the possibilities of assisted control\nand the views of Rector regarding it in extracts from another\nsitting of Miss A. M. R. (December 20, 1904) given in the\nAppendix to Chapter II., p. 434.\nIn later years this arrangement of Rector appearing at\nthe beginning and end of the sitting, and presumably man-\naging the light, while some communicator writes himself in\nthe middle, became more marked\u2014or rather it is recognised\nmore definitely as a change of control. This development\nhappened especially as regards the Hodgson communicator.\nIn the early days after Hodgson's death Hodgsonp did not\napparently contemplate acting as control at all. Thus in\na sitting recorded by Mr. Dorr in 1906 1\n(see Proceedings,\nVol. XXIII., p. 160), the following conversation occurs :\nG. B. D. I wanted to ask whether you ever controlled the\norganism of the light yourself, or whether it is\nwholly done by Rector.\n1\n1 do not know the exact date of this sitting, but it must have been in\nthe first half of 1906, I think. Mrs. Piper came over to England at the\nbeginning of November, 1906, and it was her usual practice to take three\nor four months' holiday in the summer and autumn. Hodgson died\nDecember 20, 1905.\n\f198 Mrs. Henry Sidgiviclc. [part\nHodgsonp\n. It is wholly clone by Rector and it will continue\nto be. I shall take no part in that.\nG. B. D. Then it is he who is speaking ?\nHodgsoNj,. It is Rector who is speaking and he speaks for me.\nI have no desire to take Rector's place. I trust\nhim implicitly and absolutely.\nG. B. D. And he constantly reports for everyone ?\nHodgsonp .\nEveryone. There is no question about that. In\nthe first place he is more competent to do it, he\nunderstands the conditions better than any indi-\nvidual spirit ; he is fully capable and is under the\nconstant direction of Imperator. When I finished\nwith the conditions in the earthly life I finished\nwith my control over the light.\nNevertheless, at Hodgsonp's very first appearance, Decem-\nber 28, 1905, eight days after his death, he had either\ncontrolled or in a very marked way affected the hand (see Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXIII., p. 7). Sitter and recorder, Miss Pope :\nRector had been writing, when the hand dropped the\npencil and worked convulsively several seconds in a\nvery excited manner.\nMiss P. What is the matter ?\n[The hand, shaking with apparently great excitement,\nwrote the letter H., . . . bearing down so hard on\nthe paper that the point of the pencil was broken.\nIt then wrote \" Hodgson.\"]\nMiss P.

Better wait for a few\nmoments until he breathes freer again. * * *\nPresently he will be able to conduct all here.\n{Rector then describes him as showing the sitter a\nring.

I impress\nmy thoughts on the machine {This suggests con-\ntrolling} which registers them at random, and which\nare at times doubtless difficult to understand. I\nunderstand so much better the modus operandi than\nI did when I was in your world.\nThat HodgsonP sometimes took Rector's place seems\nclearly indicated on November 23, 1906, in a sitting\nrecorded by Sir Oliver Lodge (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.\n,\np. 243), when Hodgsonp says :\nI am Hodgson, but I cannot take Rector's place to-day.\nHowever I will make a poor attempt to speak through\nhim.\nIn 1908, at Mr. Dorr's sittings, Rector seems regularly to\nopen and close the sittings, but MyersP or HodgsonP appar-\nently often, if not always, control in the middle. HodgsonP\nsays explicitly on April 21, 1908 : \"I am writing for\nMyers.\" On March 17, 1908, an indication that Rector is\nreally supposed to be away and to come back to close\nthe sitting is rather curiously given. Myersp, who is com-\nmunicating and apparently controlling, says :\nMyeesp\n. I am getting a little weak.\nG. B. D. Had you not best stop now ?\nMyersp . Soon. I think I saw Rector a moment ago,\nG B. D. You had best go now I think.\nMYERSp. I do not think we ought to go on. Let us end. I am\ntoo weak to go on. Good bye.

We cease now and may the blessings of God rest on\nyou + R Farewell (R)\nOn July 16, 1910, there can hardly be any doubt that\nRector's stepping aside and afterwards returning means that\nhe leaves the communicator to write himself. Sir Oliver\nLodge and Miss A. Johnson were present. Rector opened\nthe sitting with his usual greeting and then wrote :\nRector. A friend is here who wishes to greet you.

Peace patience and\ntrust -f Farewell (R.) 1\nIt appears, then, that neither is the line between assisted\ncontrol and full control a very clear one, nor the line between\nassisted control and communication through a control.\nThrough different degrees of assisted control, communicator\nand control, or, as Hodgson would have expressed it, in-\ndirect and direct control, seem almost to merge into each\nother.\nIn all the above examples of partial control by the com-\nmunicator, or of ways in which the communicator affects\nthe organism of Mrs. Piper, it is difficult to suppose the\ncontrol unaware of interference, and in some cases he\nadmittedly is aware of it. But there is a joint use of the\norganism, inseparable, I think, from so-called indirect com-\n1\nIn Vol. IV. of the Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical\nResearch, Prof. Hyslop records several sittings in which Hodgson is\nrepresented as taking actual control during part of the sitting, and on his\nsaying '\nGood-bye,' Rector describes himself as returning (see op. cit.,\npp. G17, 627. 700, 720). Compare also Dr. Stanley Hall in May, 1909.\nHe asked Hodgson to lift Mrs. Piper's left arm. Hodgson said he\ncould not. \" You do anything you want to with this right arm and\nhand,\" said Dr. Hall. \" That is my head, you stupid, head,\" replied\nHodgson (Studies in Spiritism, p. 239).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 201\nmunication of which the control may be unaware. I mean\nthe use of the medium's organs of hearing. In a voice\nsitting the control admittedly hears the sitter in the\nordinary way through the ear, and in a writing sitting,\neven if the existence of an organ of hearing in the hand\nbe credited, the control still hears through the organism.\nCommunication between control and communicator, if and\nso far as these are separate centres of consciousness, is, as\nalready said (p. 163 above), presumably telepathic. But how\ndoes the communicator \" hear \" the sitter ? Does he\nbecome aware of the sitter's remarks by direct telepathy\nwith him, or by telepathy with the control who has heard\nthe remarks through Mrs. Piper's organism, or does the\ncommunicator also hear through the ears ? The third of\nthese hypotheses is the only one universally applicable. The\nfirst is at least sometimes inadmissible, because mistakes\nare made which are obviously mistakes of hearing not mis-\nunderstanding of ideas, and the second also because the\nmistake of hearing is at least sometimes not the control's.\nAn auditory mistake can only occur where there is actual\ntransmission of sound ; if the mistake is not made by the\ncontrol, it must be made by the communicator to whom,\ntherefore, the sound must be transmitted directly ; and to\nreceive it directly he must use the medium's organs of\nhearing.\nExamples of auditory mistakes which are clearly not the\ncontrol's are naturally rare, but we find one, I think,\nrecorded in Proceedings, Vol. XXIL, p. 88, when on\nMarch 11, 1907, MyersP communicating mishears \"Dwarf\"\nas \" Wharf.\" The words Giant and Dwarf had been\nchosen by Mr. Piddington on February 19, 1907, as a\ncross-correspondence message to be taken to Mrs. Verrall,\nand had been given by him to Rector when MyersP was\nnot supposed to be present. On March 11, when MyersP\nwas communicating through Rector writing, Mr. Piddington\nrecurred to the subject. MyersP did not understand, and\nthe following conversation took place :\nMyersp . Could you explain a little about first word. I do\nnot feel sure of it.\nJ. G. P. \" Giant \" Myeesp\n. Oh Giant yes yes.\n\f202 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nJ. G. P. Yes ; and \" Dwarf.\"\nMyersp\n.

Giant and Dwarf. R.\nIf we accept the drama here as genuine, Rector through-\nout understands \" Giant and Dwarf,\" but in spite of this,\nand in spite of the probability that through association of\nideas \" giant \" would suggest \" dwarf \" rather than \" wharf,\"\nMyersp judges from the sound that \"wharf\" is meant, and\nRector writes it for him. It is clear, therefore, here that\nif the mistake of MyersP was genuine he was led to it\nneither by the ideas of the sitter nor by those of the con-\ntrol, but solely by the imperfectly apprehended sound of\nthe sitter's words.\nWe find another instance of mishearing by MyersP on\nApril 29, 1907 (Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 158), when\nhe failed to catch the word \" author \" in a remark of\nMrs. Verrall's, and asked first if it was \" water \" and then\nif it was \" Arthur,\" showing that he had partially grasped\nthe sound;\nbut not the meaning. 1\nInstances in which the communicator congratulates him-\nself and the sitter on the correctness with which the latter\nreads aloud the communicator's remarks strongly suggest\ndirect hearing by the communicator of the sitter's reading,\nthough it is conceivable that this was apprehended tele-\npathically through the control. A case occurred on February\n19, 1901 [Proceedings. Vol. XXIV., p. 463) :\n(R. H. reads the whole sentence {Bennie Junot's com-\nmunication through Rector} over in a natural\nmanner as if speaking it himself and not merely\nslowly deciphering it.)\nBennie. Yes, this is exactly right, how did you do it 1 How\ndid you happen to hear me so distinctly, I am\ndelighted\n.\n1\nThe argument depends, of course, on the mishearing being genuine,\nwhich it may be rash to assume.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 203\nR. H. Well, Rector made the machine work, and although\nI could not read it at first, it was all well done\nby him.\nAnd similarly on May 23, 1906 {Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.,\np. 172), on the script representing a remark of Isaac\nThompson's being read out, he says :\n\" Correct. Oh my,\nI hardly realized I could speak so well.\"\nIndisputable instances, showing that hearing by the com-\nmunicator is meant literally, are not easy to find. But I\nthink any one studying the records, or even the extracts I have\ngiven (above pp. 173-175 and Appendix, pp. 528-533) illus-\ntrating the difficulties of the communicator in \" hearing \" the\nsitter, will agree that a considerable amount of straining would\noften be required to enable us to attribute a metaphorical sense\nto the word. I think it is almost certain, therefore, that\nthe communicator as dramatically represented\n\u2014\ni.e. the\nintelligence responsible for the communicator's side of the\nconversation\u2014really hears the sitter's remarks, and, if so,\nhe must, like the control, use the medium's organs of hear-\ning. This, if control and communicator represent inde-\npendent centres of consciousness, implies of course joint\ncontrol, though neither centre of consciousness need be\naware of it.\nI am afraid it will be felt that in this chapter, even more\nthan in others, questions have been raised without being\ndefinitely answered ;\nand, in fact, the evidence does not\nenable us to answer all definitely. It may, however, be\nuseful to sum up here a few of the points which I think\nhave been made clear by the evidence presented in this\nchapter. First, although there have been veridical com-\nmunications, communicators cannot be taken at their face\nvalue, as they are sometimes manifestly false, though even\nwhen false, the dramatic distinctness of communicator and\ncontrol is maintained. Secondly, suspicion is thrown on the\nalleged machinery of communication both by its manifest\nadaptation to concealing of ignorance, to hedging, and to\ncovering up false tracks ; and by the inconsistencies and\nabsurdities in the accounts given of it. Thirdly, there is,\nhowever, evidence that the dramatic communicator is, on\nsome occasions, something more than a conscious dramatisa-\n\f204 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\ntion by the control, since the latter sees him apparently as\nan externalised vision. Fourthly, on the other hand, there\nis also evidence for more merging of control and communi-\ncator, especially in the matter of joint control of Mrs. Piper's\norganism, than the trance personalities admit.\nAll these points being taken into account, grave doubts\nare thrown on the genuineness at any time of the dramatic\npresentation of the communicator. Veridical communica-\ntions are received, some of which, there is good reason to\nbelieve, come from the dead and therefore imply a genuine\ncommunicator hi the background. But the dramatisation\nof even genuine communicators, with the whole dramatic\nmachinery employed, is probably merely dream-like.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper s Trance Phenomena. 205\nCHAPTER VI.\nThe Waking-Stage and the Corresponding Stage in\ngoing into Trance.\nThe waking-stage, as we have called the stage passed\nthrough in coming out of the trance, and the corresponding\nstage preceding the trance proper, deserve rather full treat-\nment here because they are but little discussed in Hodgson's\npapers about Mrs. Piper. Indeed, it was only in the\nlatter part of the period covered by his second Report\nthat they began to assume importance. These stages, more-\nover, which are obviously similar in kind, are of great in-\nterest in the study of the trance consciousness, especially\nas in them the relation of the intelligence in possession\nof the organism\u2014which usually, if not always, regards\nitself as Mrs. Piper herself\u2014to the other personages in\nthe drama is simpler and less sophisticated than in the\ntrance proper. There is no indication of artificiality about\nit, no suggestion of acting, and it has no theory to conform\nto. Its behaviour is more spontaneous\u2014in this resembling\nour ordinary dreams. It does not perform for an audience,\nwhereas the consciousness of the trance-proper necessarily\nhas the sitter in view in all it says.\nI have already described in the introductory chapter (pp.\n15-27) the process of going into and coming out of trance\nas it has appeared of late years. In the present chapter,\nbesides examining as far as we can the states of conscious-\nness involved, we have to consider the changes and develop-\nments that have occurred in the process in the course of\nMrs. Piper's mediumistic history.\nSince the beginning of the Imperator regime in 1897, going\ninto trance appears to have been pleasant to Mrs. Piper until\n\f206 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nthe latest sittings (1910-11), when it had become difficult\nand uncertain and was approached with some anxiety. And\ncoming out of trance was also accompanied by pleasant sen-\nsations, though just before normal consciousness returned\nshe was distressed by the contrast between the bright world\nshe seemed to herself to be leaving and the grimy one she\nreturned to. She also appeared to suffer some discomfort\nfrom a dazed feeling which lasted a little while after she was\notherwise normal. 1\nOn March 23, 1897, when just back\ninto her normal state she expressed to Hodgson her feelings\nabout it. \" Oh how dreadful this is. I used to think it\nwas horrible to go to sleep, but now its the awakening.\"\nHodgson's record continues :\n\" Mrs. P. enlarges on this,\nsaying that it is now a pleasure to her to go into trance, 2\nwhereas she once used to dread it. But she doesn't like\ncoming back.\" At any rate, since early in 1897 the\nprocess both of going into trance and coming out of it has\nbeen a quiet one, and has evidently been accompanied by\nthe sensation of pleasant sights and sounds.\nIn these respects the Imperator regime introduced a\nmarked improvement on what used to occur before. In\nthe Phinuit days both the going into and the coming out\nof trance were generally accompanied by convulsive move-\nments and grinding of teeth very unpleasant to witness,\nand probably unpleasant to go through, and one cannot\nwonder that Mrs. Piper dreaded it. The following is a\ndescription given by Sir Oliver Lodge of a typical case on\nNovember 30, 1889, (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 444) :\n3\nI sat facing Mrs. Piper in a partially darkened room.\n1\nThis is, I suppose, equivalent to saying that the state of dissociation\ninvolved in trance is not completely removed. By a dazed feeling we mean\na want of complete confidence in our prompt apprehension of our surround-\nings, of the milieu in which we find ourselves, as manifested to us through\nour senses in the normal way.\n2\nOn May 1, 1899, Mr. Dorr records similarly: \"In going into trance\nMrs. Piper said that the feeling which came to her was like the shutting\ndown of day, the descending of twilight. She used to have, she said, a\nsensation of falling, but now '\nI never feel more calm in my life than\nwhen I am going to sleep '\n\u2014passing into trance. '\nIt is very pleasant\nto me\u2014just for a moment while I am able to realise it.'\n3\nCf. also Prof. Richet's account, Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 618.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 207\n* * * Mrs. Piper sat still, leaning forward in her chair,\nand holding my hands. For some time she could not go\noff, but at last she said, \"Oh, I am going,\" the clock\nhappened to strike one (for a half hour), and she twitched\nconvulsively, ejaculated \" don't,\" and went into apparent\nepilepsy. [I had seen epilepsy several times before and\nrecognised many of the ordinary and obvious symptoms\n;\nnot, of course, pretending to speak medically.] Gradually\nshe became quiet, and still holding my right hand, cleared\nher throat in a male voice, and with distinctly altered\nand hardened features, eyes closed and unused the whole\ntime.\nPhinuit once\u2014at the beginning of a sitting on June 22,\n1895, in which the trance had come on unusually suddenly\nand while Mrs. Piper was actually carrying on a normal\nconversation with the sitter-\u2014said :\nI took the medium quickly, I saw the light long ago\nand was hurrying to it. Sometimes I'm there long before\nshe goes. When she goes out I see her spirit and I go\nin on a string while she goes out. Sometimes she sees\nme as we pass and she tries to go back and fight with me,\nunwilling to move out.\nIt is possible that this account represented a real struggle\non the part of Mrs. Piper's subconscious self against\nentrancement, notwithstanding the deliberate decision of\nher normal self to go into trance, and that this struggle\ncaused the convulsions ; while in the Imperator days\nthe subconscious self may have become more amenable.\nAgainst this, however, it must be noted that before 1897,\ncoming out of trance was also often accompanied by\nconvulsions, and indeed that violent convulsions would at\ntimes seize the writing arm while the communications\nwere proceeding (see Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 7).\nWe have not, however, much description of the coming\nout of trance in the early days. The details of the process\ndo not seem to have been thought interesting, and in the\nEnglish sittings of 1889-90 I find no ordinary case described\nin detail. Here is a brief record of that on November 30,\n1889, by Myers (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 469). Phinuit says :\n\f208 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nI begin to feel weak. I must go. Myers ! Myers !\n(and gradually Mrs. Piper came to herself.)\nThe following account by Dr. Walter Leaf evidently refers\nto an exceptionally bad waking-stage on January 1, 1890,\nafter a sitting he had superintended (Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\np. 599) :\nAfter this Dr P[hinuit] became incoherent, and kept\ncalling out, \" Walter, help me, help me ; I can't turn\nround.\" 1\nThe trance passed off very slowly and with\nunusual symptoms. The medium, on coming to, appeared\nto be very prostrate and distressed.\nNor is there very much about the coming out of trance\nin Hodgson's first Report (Proceedings, Vol. VIII.). The\nearliest case mentioned occurred in May, 1886, when\nMr. Barrett Wendell reports that \" Mrs. Piper's recovery\nfrom the trance state was, perhaps, the most shocking sight\nI ever witnessed \" (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 97).\nMr. J. F. Brown, who had sittings with Mrs. Piper 2\nin\nJune and October, 1888, reports (op. cit. p. 87) that\nPhinuit having taken leave (on June 11),\nthe medium twisted, groaned and grated her teeth just\nas she did when going into the trance, then stared about\nwildly and appeared to be coming to herself. She seemed\nsurprised to see me, and said, \" Are you here ? I didn't\nknow you were here.\" She acted bewildered for a moment\nand in answer to my question said she felt dizzy.\nMr. Brown also tells us (p. 92) that after his final sitting\non October 20, 1888 :\nWhen the medium was coming to, she saw snakes on\nmy hands and kindly pulled them off. She complained\n1 \" Turning round \" in trance parlance means getting out, or perhaps\nsomething preliminary to getting out, of the medium's body, i.e. ceasing\nto control. Compare, for example, Rector on Hodgson in 1906, as quoted\nby Sir Oliver Lodge in Vol. XXIII., p. 236.\n2\nIt should be mentioned that Mr. Brown wrote in 1891 that he was fully\nconvinced that Mrs. Piper's dealings with him had been false and fraudu-\nlent throughout, and Hodgson understood that he thought the trance\nsimulated (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 85).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 209\nof being pricked on the hand, said, \" Don't prick me so,\" or\nsomething like that, and after she was entirely herself\nasked me two or three times if I had pricked her. I\nassured her that I had not.\nMiss Gertrude Savage also describes both the going into\ntrance and the coming out of it at a sitting she had on\nOctober 23, 1888 {Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 101, 103).\nAfter a moment or two of conversation Mrs. Piper, who\nhad complained of a headache, said :\n\" I only hope I can give you something satisfactory, for\nwhen my head aches so, it is rather apt not to be so\nsuccessful.\" We then went into the darkened room adjoin-\ning, and she took my hand in hers. Immediately her\nfingers began to twitch and then her whole body, and she\ngroaned and ground her teeth, and constantly muttered,\n\" Oh, what's the matter ? What is the matter ?\n\"\n# $\nOn going into the trance state Mrs. Piper's voice became\nguttural, harsh, and she spoke with a decided accent. 1\nKeeping my hand in hers, and pressed against her fore-\nhead, she began instantly to speak. * *\nAt the end of the sitting, Miss Savage says :\nMrs. Piper then came out of the trance, with a face\ndrawn and haggard, and with a dazed look in her eyes.\n\" Who are you ? \" she said. \"I do not know who you\nare, do I ?\n\" I said, \" No, but I will tell you now.\"\nMr. Rogers Rich writes {Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 127) :\nMy first sitting with her was on September 6th, 1888.\nWith little trouble she went into the trance\u2014a state which\nwas entirely new to my experience\u2014and after a moment's\nsilence, which followed her rather violent movements, I\nwas startled by the remarkable change in her voice\u2014an\nexclamation, a sort of grunt of satisfaction, as if the person\nhad reached his destination and gave vent to his pleasure\nthereat by this sound, uttered in an unmistakeably male\nvoice, but rather husky.\n1\nThat is, Phinuit's French accent, or imitation of French accent.\no\n\f210 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\n\" A moment's silence \" after the convulsions, here\nmentioned, presumably corresponds to the few minutes\nof seemingly deep sleep which sitters became familiar\nwith later.\nThe process of going into trance continued, as already\nsaid, to be disagreeable till 1897. The following is a\ndescription given by Mrs. M. E. P. {Proceedings, Vol.\nXIII., p. 499) of March 2, 1894 :\nThe passing into the trance state was disagreeable to\nwitness. It seemed to me like a person inhaling ether 1\nvery unwillingly, and with more or less struggle.\nThere are few records of the duration of the convulsive\nmovements in going into trance. I only know of one. Dr.\nThaw records about the first sitting at which he was present,\nviz. February 14, 1892 :\n\" Convulsions strong ; continue ten\nminutes \" {Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 537). The duration\nas well as the violence of the struggle varied, and a struggle\ndoes not seem to have been a necessary or invariable accom-\npaniment of going into the trance. The following two cases\napparently show a gradual loss of consciousness without\nstruggle, or an approach to the trance condition not obvious\nto the sitter. The first was on November 19, 1888 {Pro-\nceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 106), when the sitter, Miss Z., before\nthe sitting began, showed Mrs. Piper a stone which she\nhad brought as a test object concerning which the trance-\npersonality might give information. Miss Z. reports :\nShe took it in her hand, put it between her teeth, and\nthen said, \" It was given you by a gentleman, a great\nsmoker * * * A man I have the impression has been to\nme, and whom I call very fascinating.\" Upon my deny-\ning that the man had seen her, as I thought then was\ntrue, she said, \" I cannot have made a mistake ; but\ncome quickly into the other room, and sit down as soon\n1\nCompare January 23, 1907, when the comparison of going into the\ntrance to the inhaling of ether seems to have occurred to the medium, as\nhere to the onlooker. Mrs. Piper going into trance says, \" I'm going round,\nd you see ? Can't you smell it ? \" J. G. P., \" Smell what ? \" Mrs.\nPiper, \" Ether.\" (Heavy breathing follows.) There are other references\nto ether in this sense in waking-stages.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 211\nas you can, for I can't wait long.\" She afterwards told\nme she was then partially in the trance condition.\nThe second case occurred on December 21. 1893, and is\nreported by Mrs. Sutton from notes taken by Mrs. Howard\nduring the sitting. The report says (Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\np. 489) :\nMrs. Piper was sitting talking with us, not ready to be\nentranced, when she suddenly put her hand to her head,\nrose, and moved toward the window. Before reaching it\nshe staggered and would have fallen but that we supported\nher to a chair. For an instant only she seemed lifeless,\nthen as suddenly rose full of animation under the control\nof G. P.\nWith this we may compare a case reported by Hodgson\nin which an undesired trance was averted on April 25, 1894\n{Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 344).\nThis morning, one of our members, Mrs. R., was trying\nexperiments in crystal gazing and automatic writing.\nMrs. Piper had her hand resting occasionally on Mrs. R's.\nMrs. P. felt some pushing, etc., in her hand. I put pencil\nin and we went on talking. Turning to talk to another\nlady present, a Mrs. G\u2014,\nmy attention was attracted\nsuddenly by Mrs. P.'s breathing. She was on the point\nof being entranced, and while I was managing to keep\nher out of trance successfully, her right hand with pencil\nwas dashing off * * * \" Add lo instead of and.\" 1\nThe seeing of \" spirits \" in the waking stage, definite\nexternalised visions or hallucinations, 2\nwhich was so\ncharacteristic of later waking-stages, evidently sometimes\noccurred in the earlier period, for we have the following\ndescription by Miss A. M. R. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\np. 112). It relates to the end of the sitting of\nDecember 17, 1888, from which I have already quoted an\n1\nIt was afterwards made clear that this referred to a name given in trance\nthe day before, and meant that Rollo was to be substituted for Roland.\n2\nThe snakes described by Mr. Brown (see above, p. 208) were apparently\nan instance of hallucinatory vision, though not of spirits.\n\f212 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nextract in Chapter II., p. 30. A friend of Miss R.'s was\ncontrolling :\nI asked my friend if he would not get my sister, who\nseemed to be there, and Dr. P. and all to stand back\nof me when the medium returned, to see if she could\nnot see them. So when half out of her trance she\nexclaimed at something which she saw. She described\nafterwards three persons whom she saw\u2014two gentlemen\nand one lady\u2014and also some beautiful flowers. I have\nhad a similar experience with her twice before. On one\nof these occasions she described my friend (referred to\nabove) in general terms, and added :\n\" His nose was just\na little bit crooked.\" This amused me, as my friend and\nI, before his death, frequently disputed as to the straight-\nness of his nose, and I always maintained that it was\nslightly crooked. I am satisfied that Mrs. Piper could\nhave known nothing whatever of this.\nIt was, however, under the G. P. regime (1892 onwards)\nthat waking-stages with visions by the medium began to\nbe at all common, and that speech by the medium during\nthem was gradually developed. It was on April 28, 1892,\nthat occurred the incident of the name Peirce, which\nG. P. had failed to give in the trance, being called out\nin what we should now call the waking-stage ; and it is\nnoteworthy that from Hodgson's remarks about this it\nseems to have been the first waking-stage in which he\nheard Mrs. Piper speak. At any rate it led to his first\ndescription of this. The contemporary record says (Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 305) :\nFinally Phinuit said he had to go, and Mrs. Piper began\nto come out of trance. Convulsive movements worse than\nusual, and then whispered voice muttering some words\nindistinguishable * * * Further unintelligible sounds, among\nwhich the name Peirce was alone distinct. This name was\nspoken twice, and was not in either Phinuit's or Mrs. Piper's\nordinary voice. Shortly after this Mrs. Piper came to\nherself.\nOn this Hodgson, whose paper was published in 1898,\nremarks (Proceedings. Vol. XIII., p. 306) :\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 213\nSince this sitting I have frequently heard Mrs. Piper\nspeak during the interval between trance and waking, on\nthe borderline of waking. On rarer occasions I have\nheard her speak just as she is losing consciousness before\nthe trance. At both these times her voice, though slightly\ndifferent from the ordinary voice in conversation, is not\ndifferent to the extent that the remark in my contempor-\nary note above seems to suggest. Sometimes it is a whisper,\nmore commonly not ; but it always sounds dreamy or\nautomatic, i.e. it sounds just as I should imagine Mrs.\nPiper's voice would sound if she were talking in her\nsleep, either aloud or in a whisper.\nI do not, however, find records in 1892 or 1893 of\nMrs. Piper in the waking-stage speaking to spirits or\nrepeating the observations of spirits (unless it occurred on\nNovember 28, 1892, as suggested below, p. 220), though\nseveral cases of visions are mentioned, chiefly\u2014as was also\nthe case under the Imperator regime\u2014visions of controls or\ncommunicators who had played a part in the trance.\nAt the sitting on November 28, 1892, such a vision of\nG. P. is mentioned, and a subsequent selection of G. P.'s\nphotograph as that of the man she had seen. 1\nThis\nsitting is also notable because, after this vision, Mrs. Piper\nwent into trance again and later in the sitting there were\napparently two abortive beginnings of waking. The sitting\nis described in Proceedings, Vol. XIII. (pp. 416-417). I\nquote from a somewhat longer stenographic report the\naccount of the waking-stage that occurred in the middle\nof it. The sitting took place at the house of Mr. and\nMrs. Howard, who with their daughter Katherine were\npresent as well as Hodgson and the stenographer. G. P.\nhad been controlling when :\n[At 9.16 the medium comes out of trance but before\nwholly out exclaims\u2014\" There is the man with the beard.\"]\nR. H. What is he saying %\n1\nOn December 22, 1892, we learn from the stenographic report that \" When\npartially out [of trance] she seems to see something and when asked what\nit was, she says she saw the same gentleman she saw once before ;\njust\nsaw him smile ; did not see him do anything.\" This was doubtless again\na vision of G. P.\n\f214 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pabt\nMrs. Piper. Did you see him ? I dreamed that I saw a\ngentleman with a book and a pencil in his hand\nand he was writing.\nR. H.

Oh no, I did not see either of you. Oh no, I\nwas dreaming, I think.

For one\ndeliberately arranged by the control Phinuit see Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\npp. 43-44. And for a relapse into trance with convulsions after Mrs. Piper\nhad begun to come out (on November 18, 1893), see Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\np. 483. (This case is quoted below in Chapter VII., p. 290). For a brief\ninterval of apparent sleep during a sitting between two controls (Gurney\nand Phinuit), see Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 553. I think that in later years\nintervals longer than a few seconds\u2014such, for instance, as would be involved\nin holding \"the healer's influence\" (see below, p. 310)\u2014were avoided.\nPerhaps it was as a means of avoiding them that, when a control or com-\nmunicator temporarily withdrew the interval was filled with general talk\nby Rector, or by a brief episode concerning some other communicator.

P. had been writing, after which\nPhinuit talked, and then Madame Elisa controlled and\ntalked in a whisper for a short time to Mrs. Howard.\nFrom this point I quote the stenographic report, which\nis rather fuller than that given in Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\npp. 426, 427 :\n[At 10.17 the medium comes out of trance.

There was a case after a voice-sitting with Mr. Dorr\non April 17, 1905, of Mrs. Piper coming out of trance with the usual kind\nof waking-stage, and going back into the trance to write a message to\nHodgson. (See Appendix, pp. 595-596).\n1\nMr. Leaf, it will be remembered, had taken charge of some of the\nsittings in England in 1890.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 217\nwith something in her hand, I don't know what\nit was.\nR.

I can't tell you, it is going from me now.\nThe consciousness\u2014or perhaps I should say memory\u2014of\nthe waking-stage impressions here seems less broken up\nthan was usually the case in more recent sittings, but it\nis possible that we have here only part of the waking-\nstage recorded. Whether the description of the halluci-\nnatory lady resembled Madame Elisa or any other person\nknown to the sitters we are not told.\nAnother definite waking-stage vision is reported by Miss\nEdmunds on November 22, 1893, as I find from unpublished\nnotes. She writes :\nAs she came out of trance Mrs. Piper described a\nman standing, placing the fingers of one hand on the\nother and stroking his whiskers etc.\u2014characteristic of {one\nof those who had controlled during the sitting}.\nOn March 14, 1893, i.e. between the two waking-stages last\ndescribed, Mrs. Pij)er underwent a serious operation, already\nreferred to above, p. 19, and it is interesting to note that\nin coming to herself from the influence of the anaesthetic\nshe seems to have gone through a waking-stage resembling\nthose in coming out of trance. Hodgson had gone to the\nsanatorium and remained in the building while the\noperation was performed, so that he might be of assistance\nin case of any unusual occurrence. He writes (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 479) :\nAfter the operation, and while Mrs. Piper, who had been\ntaken to her room, was still under the influence of the\nether, and apparently unconscious of any person present,\nDr. Ingraham requested me to enter the room, as Mrs. Piper\n\f218 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nwas calling for me. I went in and spoke to her, but\nshe seemed to be quite unaware of my presence, although\nshe moaned occasionally, and several times called out\nspasmodically \" Mr. Hodgson.\" During this interval of\nunconsciousness her attention became fixed as upon an\nobject of interest, and she exclaimed :\n\" Who is that\nold man ? Take him away.\" Then came a pause as if\nshe was listening, and she then added, \" Oh, no. He's\na nice old man. He can stay.\" This naturally caused me\nto think of Phinuit.\nAnother instance of a \" waking-stage \" after an anaes-\nthetic will be found in the Appendix to this chapter,\np. 579. It occurred on April 24, 1901, nearly eight years\nlater than the one just described, and it will be observed\nthat here it is Imperator, the chief control of this later date,\nwho appears.\nThe waking-stages of the sittings of June 25 and 26, 1894,\nare described by Dr. Newbold in Proceedings, Vol. XIV.,\npp. 25 and 27. In the second of these occurs hearing of\nspirits by Mrs. Piper and repetition of what spirits say,\nboth common features of later waking-stages, but here\nperhaps developing ;\nthough, on the other hand, there\nmay have been more of it before this than the records\nclearly reveal (see next page). It is curious that the\ntalking for spirits on June 26 was followed by a relapse\ninto unconsciousness from which there was considerable\ndifficulty in getting Mrs. Piper to wake.\nIn a waking-stage of November 9, 1894, of which Miss\nEdmunds gives a brief account, Mrs. Piper has again auditory\nas well as visual hallucinations :\nOn coming out of trance Mrs. Piper said :\n\" Oh I hear\nsome one calling '\nWater !\n' He says '\nOh I want water\n!\n'\n\"\nShe also gave a very good description of Mr. C. excepting\nthe nose. Said she saw a gentleman with very clear eyes,\netc.\nPhinuit had during the sitting commented on the com-\nmunicator's \" eyes as clear as a bell,\" and the latter had\nhimself referred to his calling for water in his last illness.\nIn 1895 we have in the records of Dr. Newbold's sittings\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 219\nseveral notable waking-stages. I quote first those of April\n24 and May 8, both recorded by Hodgson\n{April 24, 1895.)\n[After Phinuit goes, there is whispering, Pttee p'see\nrepeated frequently, then Euthee and papa repeated\n\u2014\nother sounds possibly, but these were all I could hear.\nMrs. Piper in coming out bent forward as though seeing\nsomething and murmured in her own voice :\n\" Mrs. Dow\nand the baby.\" On questioning her immediately after-\nward she said she had seen Mrs. Dow with \" two little\nones.\"] 1\n(May 8, 1895.)\nPresent W. R. N. and R. H.\nAt end of trance, after Phinuit left there were signs\nof another \"control.\" There was a murmuring which N.\nthought sounded like Walter, but which R. H. thought\nwas Water.\nMrs. Piper appeared to have a vision as she was coming\nout of trance, and on being questioned said she saw a\ngentleman arm in arm with Mr. Pelham. They were\nlaughing and rocking from side to side.\u2014She didn't re-\nmember having seen the gentleman before. \u2014He was not\nvery much larger than Newbold, had a pointed beard very\ndark brown, dark eyes,\u2014glasses. \" His moustache was\nput out this way \" [indicating that it was pushed up and\nout from the upper lip]. His glasses were spectacles and\nthe wire went over and behind the ears.\nBoth these accounts begin with partially heard whispering\nor murmuring regarded by Hodgson at the time as signs\nof another \" control \" taking possession when Phinuit\nleft, and therefore as occurring during the trance proper.\nJudging from later experience, however, it seems very\npossible that these words are part of the waking-stage\n1\nThese names and phrases belong to communicators in the sittings of\nDr. and Mrs. Thaw in 1892 (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 384, 385, and\n536-582). The names recurred in several waking-stages (see below, p.\n256, and Appendix, p. 550).\n\f220 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nand spoken by Mrs. Piper in propria persona\u2014perhaps\nrepeating after spirits. The waking-stage of later years\nusually began in this way ;\n1\nand there was no doubt\nabout its being the waking-stage, because it followed the\nperiod of apparently profound sleep which succeeded the\nclosing of s\nthe sitting by Imperator and Rector, and it\nonly began after Mrs. Piper had raised her head from the\npillow and opened her eyes.\nBut if these whispered words in April and May, 1895,\nare really part of the waking-stage, it would seem not\nimprobable that the whispered Italian words on November\n28, 1892 (see above, p. 215) were also part of a waking-\nstage, notwithstanding Phinuit's brief apparent return to\nsay au revoir. At any rate, so far as one can judge from\nthe almost necessarily imperfect description, there is a good\ndeal of likeness between the two cases ; and it seems\nto follow that the distinction in the state of consciousness\nbetween the trance proper and the early part of the\nwaking-stage is not in essence so marked as is suggested\nby what we now regard as typical cases, or perhaps the\none may intrude into the other. We shall presently see\nthat there are some other things pointing in the same\ndirection. In the Phinuit and G. P. days there certainly\nseems to have been a less obvious division between trance\nand waking-stage than under the Imperator regime, but\none would like to know exactly what symptoms led the\nrecorder on November 28, 1892, to say \" Mrs. Piper is appa-\nrently about to come out of trance.\"\nIn a sitting of Dr. Newbold's on June 14, 1895,\nthe whispering is definitely placed by him in the waking-\nstage. The description is interesting also because I think\nit is the first we have of the gradually waking Mrs. Piper\nseeing the sitter as a black and horrible object\u2014which\nshe commonly did later. Dr. Newbold's record is as\nfollows :\n[Coming out Mrs. Piper whispers, nearly all unintelligible]\nBetter give me my own body ... I want my husband.\nElliott [?] I want . . . Sallie . . . my father was with\n1\nSee description in Chapter I., p. 22.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 221\nme ... I want\u2014everybody to go away\u2014[to N.] you\nlook blacker than the ace of spades\u2014horrible . . . [Draws\naway from him with expression of loathing.]\nOh dear [relapses several times] Oh yes, Dr. Newbold,\nOh I am so sleepy and stupid. I heard all sorts of\nvoices calling to me. There was a lady who kept pulling\nand picking at me and txy'mg to say something but I\ncouldn't understand her. It seemed as if my mind and\nhers were trying to get together but could not. I was\ndeaf to her and I felt I had to go somewhere, where I\ndid not know. She had beautiful dark hair, a little\nsilvered, black eyes, very small hands. I saw the same\nlovely lady I saw yesterday. She had light hair, dark\neyes. The other one seemed more earnest or serious, and\nkept all the time talking to me, or trying to.\nWhen Mrs. Piper talks, as represented in the latter part\nof this record, of what she has seen or experienced\u2014describes\nit as one might a dream from which one has waked up\u2014she\nis, of course, in a nearly normal condition. When quite\nherself, the memory of the dream has generally disappeared\n(see, e.g. a remark by her, p. 217). The reference to seeing\nthe same lovely lady as yesterday seems to show that while in\nthe waking-stage she has memory of previous waking-stages.\nIt is to be noted that sitters' friends when described by\nMrs. Piper, whether in the trance proper or in the waking-\nstage, are apt to be described in flattering terms, said\nto be lovely or the most beautiful spirit she ever saw,\netc. This can hardly be a strictly accurate description\nof her visions, because these, when we can test them,\nresemble the originals as known on earth. But I think\nthat, at least since 1896, the \" spirits \" seen in the waking-\nstage do share the beauty of the waking-stage visions.\nIn the trance proper the flattering descriptions may be due\nto a desire to please sitters, though there is something of a\nmore general character in a remark such as Phinuit made\nabout K. F. on December 12, 1896 :\n\" She's a beautiful\ncreature. You don't know how beautiful a beautiful soul\nis till you come over here.\"\nWe may observe one distinction between waking-stages\nof this period and later, that there is a distinct tendency\n\f222 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc.

Then something\nsnapped in my head and I got my own eyes again.\nBad dreams like this seem to have disappeared with\nthe convulsions under the Irnperator regime, as did also\nunpleasant impressions in going into trance\u2014for instance,\nthe one on June 20, 1895, when Mrs. Piper going into\ntrance says : \"in a tone of horror '\nTake him away ' \"\n;\nimmediately after which Phinuit controls.\nThere are several things to note about the waking-stage\njust described, as illustrating waking-stages generally.\nFirst, in the earlier part the dream seems to be going on.\nThen a different stage of consciousness comes on and she\n\f224 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nbegins to describe the dream of which she has given frag-\nmentary indications while it was proceeding. 1\nHodgson's\nquestions probably prolonged this stage by keeping her\nmind on the dream. I should surmise, however, that the\nquestions were answered without any distinct consciousness\nof who was asking them, and that full consciousness of\nthis only came on at the point when she sits upright and\nlooks at Hodgson with an air of recognition, and it is\nprobably to this moment, before the snap, that belongs the\nfurther impression of seeing with spirit eyes, through her\nbodily eyes, the spirit body as well as the mortal body of\nHodgson.\nWaking-stages, or rather the earlier parts of waking-\nstages, seem to vary in the degree of consciousness ex-\nhibited of the presence of the sitter. In some cases the\npresence of the sitter does not seem to be recognised. An\nexample of this will be found on p. 559. On the other\nhand, in a case such as is recorded on June 17, 1895 :\nSallie said give my love to the boys. Oh how many\nUncle Williams. Who do you suppose that old lady can\nbe ? She is persistent. She is always here ; was standing\nwith her hand on your shoulder.\nthe spirits and sitter seem to be brought into definite\nspacial relation with each other.\nThe subject-matter of the waking-stage dreams or impres-\nsions can often, perhaps generally, be traced in recent\ntrances. 2\nThus the occupation of the medium's body by\nPhinuit, and seeing with spirit eyes, etc., had been spoken\nof in the trance from which Mrs. Piper was waking on\n1 Compare a note concerning waking-stages made by Hodgson on\nDecember 26, 1896: \"There appear to be two somewhat separated stages\nof Mrs. Piper's subliminal {subliminal = waking-stage}. (1) Where she\nbears the same relation to the '\ninvisibles '\nand the sitter as the ordinary\nspeaking 'communicator' {= control} does, e.g. Phinuit. (2) Where she no\nlonger is seeing and hearing the '\ninvisibles '\nbut only remembering what she\nhas just passed through. Both of these stages are frequently observable,\nbut often only one. There is nearly always a trace of (2) in the beginning\nof her normal-consciousness return, a dreamy rapidly-fading recollection.\"\nIn neither stage, it may be remarked, do we get the whole of what waa\ndreamt.\n2\nFor some exceptions, see below, p. 245.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 225\nJune 25, 1895, and the survival of animals and their real\nexistence and development in the spirit world had been\ndiscussed in the trance of June 20.\nAnother noteworthy point about the waking-stage of June\n25, 1895, is the snap in the head. It is the first record, so\nfar as I know, of Mrs. Piper remarking on this sensation at\nthe time of its occurrence, and expecting the sitter to hear\nit. The snap was, however, spoken of on June 21, 1895\n(see Appendix, p. 549)\u2014after a waking-stage which, by the\nway, again seems to have been a bad dream experience\n\u2014\nand spoken of in a way that shows it was not an experience\nnew to her.\nFor comparison with the waking-stage of June 25, 1895,\nI may give that of February 19, 1907, where all seems\nbright and pleasant except the returning to this dark\nworld. I select this one from among others because it\nillustrates well the breaks of consciousness in the waking-\nstage. The Bennie Junot incident is apparently quite\ndisconnected from the rest, and Bennie had not been\nmentioned during the trance.\n(February 19, 1907. Waking-stage.)\nSitter and Recorder, J. G.

And it did not become an invariable, or\nvery nearly invariable, occurrence till about the middle\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 227\nof February, 1897, which suggests that its development,\nat least partly, depended on the cessation of the habitual\nuse of the voice in the trance proper. This, as we have\nseen, was one result of the departure of Phinuit and taking\nover of the direction of trance utterances by the Imperator\nband. Talking while going into the trance remained only\noccasional to the end. Nothing would be gained by\nquoting every case of talking either in going into or\ncoming out of trance. I give in the Appendix to this\nchapter a selection from among the more interesting or\ntypical cases, chosen to illustrate various points, and\nchosen from different years so that the reader may have\nthe opportunity of following the further development.\nBut it may be well to give here some further general\ndescription of the waking-stage during most of the\nImperator regime. I pointed out in the introductory\nchapter\u2014-and it is illustrated by various waking-stages\nreferred to in the present chapter\u2014that in the earlier part\nof the waking-stage Mrs. Piper conceives herself to be in\na world of spirits brighter and better than this, and is\nunaware apparently of her actual surroundings. In that\nother world her own spirit walks about among other\nspirits, as, for instance, on April 3, 1900, when she says\n(see Appendix, p. 571) :\nSay, Rector took me into the other world and I've been\nall round through the garden with Mrs. Hodgson and that\nlittle boy.\nOr on December 24, 1906, when she says (in the passage\nquoted in Chapter II., p. 70, in another connexion) :\nI met Dr. Hodgson walking in the garden and I was\ntaking a message for him ; and then Myers came and\ninterrupted him ; and then I came down and down on a\ncord.\nThe spirits she thus meets may be false communi-\ncators ;\ne.g. she appeared to see \" Bessie Beals \" in the\nwaking-stage (see above, p. 178, footnote). But though\nher own spirit is there, I do not think that she ever\nmeets there the spirit of any other living person. On\n\f228 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthe other hand, her visions of spirits sometimes persist\ninto that part of the waking-stage when she begins to\nreturn to this world and to be aware of her real surround-\nings, and thus get mixed up with these. For instance,\non November 17, 1902, Hodgson reports that Mrs. Piper\nremarked to the effect that the silk robe swirled over\nher, and on my asking her what it was, she said that\nwhen he (apparently Imperator) turned, the silk robe went\nover her pillow.\nOr again on December 8, 1902, Mr. Dorr reports :\n[Staring at G. B. D.] Well, who is that lady with her\nhand on your shoulder\u2014something misty shut down right\nover it\u2014That's no dream, Mr. Hodgson !\nOr on February 20, 1901, after one of the Bennie Junot\nsittings :\nSee that cord I came in on ?\nThere was a young man almost in my way. I did not\nstep on him, did I ?\nOr on April 16, 1901, R. H. and G. B. D. present:\nI felt so numb\n[To R. H.] If you'd put your head over a moment ago\nyou'd have hit Rector right in the mouth !\nCompare also the waking-stage of March 5, 1897\n(Appendix to Chapter III., p. 499). This intrusion of\nspirits into the semi-normal consciousness of the later part\nof the waking-stage is not necessarily accompanied by any\ncomplete recollection of the part these spirits have played\nin the previous dream or even of their having played any\npart at all. There is generally a distinct break in memory\nwhen the consciousness of actual surroundings begins, and\nvery often such breaks will also appear in the middle of\nthe part before this point, or of that after it, or both.\nIn fact, Mrs. Piper seems to come to herself through a\nvarying number of strata of consciousness as it were.\nThe tendency to absurd misinterpretation of what she\nsees is another dreamlike characteristic apt to exhibit itself\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 229\nin the second part of the waking-stage. I gave some\ninstances in Chapter I. as illustrations of probably\nblurred vision. But it requires absence of normal power of\njudgment as well as blurred vision to suppose that a fur\ncoat on a chair is a cow in the room (see above, p. 24),\nor that Mr. Hodgson's arm is an elephant's trunk, as\nMrs. Piper did on January 22, 1901 :\nYou hear my head snap ?\nI thought you were an elephant. I thought that was\nan elephant's trunk [pointing to R. H.'s left arm lying\nacross the table] Oh is that you, Mr. Hodgson ?\n1\nThere is generally, I think, throughout a waking-stage a\nsort of framework of the dream common to most of the\nwaking-stages of about the same period, though varying\nwithout marked transition from period to period. Thus\nthe general religious atmosphere and the idea of edifying\ninstruction being given by Imperator to the medium con-\nstantly occurs in 1897. And the same phrases are often\nused. I think the kind of similarity I mean can be\nobserved in those waking-stages of March, 1897, quoted\nin the Appendix. In 1907, when Mrs. Piper was in\nEngland, a vision of a kind of temple with archways in\nwhich apparently the spirits were grouped was frequent.\nIn the later part of the waking-stages after 1898 the\ncoming in on a cord is very frequently spoken of\u2014and so\nforth. Flowers constantly played an important part\nin waking-stages of all periods, and were often perceived\nthrough three senses\u2014sight, smell, and touch. Some\nimagery or remarks indicating that Mrs. Piper regarded\nherself as visiting a heavenly region, conceived in various\nways, occur in almost all waking-stages under the\nImperator regime. But nothing about these waking-stage\ndreams is invariable, and there are cases where the ideas\nare apparently entirely derived from the immediately\npreceding or recent trances proper, and the scene of\nthe drama is in this world, though not in the actual\nsurroundings\u2014visits to Mexico and to Myers's medium in\n1\nA tendency to illusion in a minor degree was exhibited in occurrences\non December 12 and 17, 1906 (see Appendix, p. 601).\n\f230 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nEngland are instances (see below, p. 247, and Appendix,\npp. 551-553).\nIt remains to try to make out something about the intelli-\ngence concerned in the waking-stage talk or in that going\ninto trance, and what its relation is to the personalities of\nthe trance proper and to the normal Mrs. Piper.\nIn the detailed description of the going into trance, which\nHodgson gives in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 397-399, he\nseems to conceive of two distinct consciousnesses in Mrs.\nPiper, one aware of this world and the other of another\nworld. His theory put shortly seems to be that in going into\ntrance the subliminal consciousness first mixes itself with\nand then ousts the supraliminal consciousness, and finally\nitself disappears, taking the supraliminal consciousness\nwith it and leaving the \" spirits \" free to act in its\nabsence. This process he conceives as occurring in reverse\norder in coming out of trance. In his typewritten records\nof sittings he always heads his account of the waking-\nstage with the words :\n\" Mrs. Piper's subliminal speaks,\"\nor some similar phrase ; and the waking-stage came to be\ncalled by him and other sitters \" the subliminal.\"\nI think it is possible that Hodgson would himself have\nadmitted that he used the term \" subliminal,\" both in the\npassage in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., just referred to, and\nin his records, a little loosely. 1\nFor though the dream\nconsciousness of all of us, and Mrs. Piper's waking-stage\nconsciousness\u2014which, as I remarked in the introductory\nchapter (p. 27) have obviously many points of resemblance\n\u2014may, as compared with the normal waking consciousness,\nbe more open to influence from the subconscious, and\nhave more access to subliminal memories, the differences\n1\nHe says, in introducing his description (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p.\n397) : \"I shall use terms as far as possible which are familiar to the\nreaders of our Proceedings, even although they may not be strictly\naccurate in their application.\" A friend who frequently discussed the\nphenomena with Hodgson tells me that he doubts whether by '\nsub-\nliminal '\nhe meant to imply more than '\nnot included in the memory of\nthe normal consciousness '\nbut I think the description I have tried to\nsummarize above is difficult to reconcile with this as the whole meaning\nof the word.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 231\nmore constantly in evidence are of the nature of limita-\ntion rather than extension. The confusion, incoherence,\nand frequent absurdity arise largely from the absence of\nperception of the actual surroundings, from unstable and\nrapidly shifting memory, and from partial abeyance of\nthe critical faculty\u2014the faculty of judgment. These are\nhardly the results one would expect from the combined\noperation of consciousnesses aware between them of two\nworlds.\nWhen two more or less independent consciousnesses are\nat work, as in automatic writing, one must be subliminal\nto the other if both belong to the same individual. But\nin dreams it is difficult to say what is subliminal and what\nis not. At any rate, I prefer to avoid difficult questions\nabout the subliminal consciousness and to put the question\nto be determined in the form :\n\" Does the intelligence which\nspeaks in the waking-stage conceive itself as being Mrs.\nPiper ?\n\" This question, I take it from Hodgson's use of\nthe word subliminal, he would have answered in the affirma-\ntive. 1\nIn the later part of the process of waking\u2014when the\nexperiences of the earlier part are being described\u2014there\nis, of course, no doubt. It is Mrs. Piper herself who de-\nscribes them. And whenever these experiences take the\nform of vision, it is Mrs. Piper herself who sees. Again,\nthe spoken remarks in the earlier part are often obviously\naddressed by Mrs. Piper to a spirit or to an impersonal\nauditor, or occasionally to the sitter.\n2\nThus we sometimes\nget Mrs. Piper's side only of a conversation with spirits.\nFor example, on February 12, 1897, the record of the\nwaking-stage begins :\nI will be good. I will be good. I'll do the best I can.\nI do try. Yes, I do. Yes I do. Oh yes I do. Yes I\nwill. Yes, and in this world too.\n1\n1 think, in fact, that what he means when in his records he describes\nthe waking-stage as \" Mrs. Piper's subliminal speaking \" is simply that the\nspeaking intelligence does not conceive itself as an independent spirit, as\nit does in the trance proper, but that at the same time it is not the normal\nwaking Mrs. Piper.\n2\nSometimes the sitter, though realised as an individual, is not recog-\nnised. See e.g. p. 247 (April 16, 1897), and Appendix, March 29, 1897,\np. 559 ; May 22, 1900, p. 572 ; March 26, 1902, p. 585 ; March 1, 1905, p. 594.\n\f232 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nWhich sentences are followed by a remark showing that she\nhas conceived herself as conversing with Imperator. (For full\nrecord see Appendix, p. 553.) Or, again, on March 23, 1897,\nthe record begins with one side of a conversation which\nMrs. Piper appears to be holding with Mrs. Dow during\na sort of morning call in the other world\u2014Mrs. Dow 1\nhaving been one of the communicators during the trance :\nWho told you that ? . . . Yes, she has. She has grown.\nShe's quite a large girl. 1\nWhose boy is it % He came here\nfirst, did he ? ... Oh I see. He's a very good man,\ndon't you think. That's Rector. Well, I think I could\nstay with you, Mrs. Dow, but I'm going back. 2\nOther instances in which Mrs. Piper's side only of a\nconversation is uttered aloud will be found in the\nAppendix.3\nAs an example of Mrs. Piper herself being the sole\nspeaker, but describing what she sees or hears to an\nearthly auditor apparently without consciousness of whom\nshe is describing it to, the waking-stages of February 23,\n1897, and May 22, 1900, may be referred to (see Appendix,\npp. 553, 572). Sometimes in the first part of the waking-\nstage Mrs. Piper is obviously the sole speaker whose remarks\nare given, but she addresses some of her remarks to the\nspirits and some to the earthly auditor. For instance, on\nMarch 27, 1897 (see Appendix, p. 559), she begins by de-\nscribing what she sees, and when she comes to the words\n\" Would you please let me go sir \" is apparently addressing\nImperator.\nIn most waking-stages\u2014even the early parts of them\n\u2014\nat least some of the remarks are obviously the remarks of\nMrs. Piper in propria persona. But there are a certain\nnumber of cases where the remarks of spirits to Mrs.\nPiper are given in the first person, unaccompanied by any\nremarks of Mrs. Piper's own\u2014where we have, in fact, the\n1\nSee above, p. 219. The girl who has grown is doubtless Ruthie Thaw.\ns\nThe passage quoted on p. 206 above about Mrs. Piper's dislike of coming\nback, etc., follows immediately here in the record.\n3\nSee March 24, 1897; April 15, 1897; May 11, 1897.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 233\nspirit's side of the conversation but not Mrs. Piper's. For\ninstance, on April 8, 1897, the record begins :\nCome here spirit and answer me [?]\nI am the messenger of God, the Life, the Light. I will\nguard thee well.\nGo spirit, take up thy body.\nSay to him these are the paths of light and truth, and\nmay God be merciful to you.\n[Almost normal.]\nMr. Hodgson, I saw that gentleman with the cross\nagain {Imperator} and he gets so small, 1\nand when I get\ninto this room again, oh I feel so horrible ...***\nThey're pouring . . .\n(R. H. Heard the snap yet ?)\nOh I just heard it. I felt as though they were pouring\nsomething over me. 2\nAre we in cases like this also to suppose Mrs. Piper to\nregard herself as speaking, repeating the remarks of\nspirits ? Hodgson apparently did so, and I believe that\nin most cases this interpretation is right. The reasons for\nthinking so are that the voice, when more than a whisper,\nis like Mrs. Piper's when she is undoubtedly speaking for\nherself or clearly acting as intermediary for a spirit,3\nand\nthat in other cases, in which both spirits and Mrs. Piper\nherself speak, the fact that she is repeating for spirits is\nsometimes made clear, the manner being much the same\nas when it is not made clear. 4\nThere are many instances\nin which we have the remarks of both Mrs. Piper and of\nspirits, where the question whether she regards herself as\nrepeating the spirit's remarks, arises just as it does in\ncases where the remarks are all those of spirits.5\nAnd\n1\nCompare Chapter I., p. 25.\n2\nFor other examples see Appendix, March 8 and 12, 1897.\n3\nFor a definite example of this see Appendix, May 26, 1898.\n4\nSee, for example, Appendix, April 26, 1897.\n5\nSee, for examples, Appendix, March 4, 13, 17, 22, 26, 29 and April 1,\n1897 ; March 20, 1907 ; also Vol. XXII., p. 302, May 7, 1907 ;\nAppendix,\nMay 13, 1908. On April 26, 1897, and March 31, 1897, there are indica-\ntions that she knows she is repeating for spirits.\n\f234 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nthere is at least one case (June 10, 1897, see Appendix)\nwhere the question is raised by a conversation that occurs\nbetween Mrs. Piper and a spirit hi going into trance.\nThere is one phenomenon which occasionally occurs\nwhich may possibly throw some light on this question of\nrepetition for spirits in the first person\u2014namely, the\nrepetition by Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage of the\nsitter's remarks\u2014what Haidenhain and Charcot, when they\nobserved it in hypnotised subjects, called echolalia. Accord-\ning to that school of hypnotism, the repetition was due\nto a mechanical reflex\u2014to action of the nerves without\nvolition. The more modern view is, I believe, that it is\nthe result of volition and due to mental suggestion of some\nsort ; the hypnotised person repeats parrot-like because\nfor some reason or other he thinks that is what he is intended\nto do. 1\nThis kind of mimicry is recorded at least twice by\nHodgson, on June 20, 1899, and March 10, 1902, and\nonce by Dr. Stanley Hall in the spring of 1909. The\nfollowing are Hodgson's records :\n(June 20, 1899.)\nPresent, R. B. J. and R. H.\n[inarticulate]. God is spirit [?]\nThere's that same one. There's the same one . . .\nbefore\nOh I don't know. I won't ache.\nWho's * * * [inarticulate] There he is. I want to go\nout. That's that other one.\n(R. H. Hallo) Hallo\n(R. H. Mrs. Piper) Mrs. Piper\n(R. H. Are you all right ?) Are you all right.\n(March 10, 1902.)\nPresent, Mrs. B. and R. H.\n\" That's Katie . . . That's Katie . . . That's Katie.\" (R. H.\nWhat Katie ?) I don't know [R. H. says :\n\" Hello !\n\" \" Good\nmorning.\" \" All right.\" \" It's a fine day.\" \" Alta quite\n1\nMrs. Piper similarly automatically imitated speech and gesture when\nput into semi-hypnosis by William James (see Appendix to Chapter I., p. 334).\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 235\nwell ?\n\" and several other analogous phrases to stimulate\nthe return of Mrs. P.'s ordinary consciousness ; she repeats\nautomatically after me the words I say. Finally she\nbecomes normal, and to my query \" all right ?\n\" replies\n\"Yes, thank you.\"]\nDr. Hall's record I give in Appendix, p. 612. It will\nbe seen that some of the remarks repeated after him were\nrather longer than Hodgson's, also that the mimicry\noccurs in a longer waking-stage, which continues after it\nfor some little time before complete normal consciousness\nis recovered.\nAs Mrs. Piper clearly has in the waking-stage vivid\nauditory hallucinations, as well as those of sight and smell,\nit seems just possible that she may sometimes mimic her\nown hallucinations, as in the instances just quoted she\nmimicked Hodgson. Against this, however, it must be\nobserved that the instances we have of repetition after\nthe sitter occur in a later part of the waking-stage\u2014\na\npart more near to normal awakeness than the instances of\nrepetition of the remarks of spirits. And, moreover,\nrepetition for spirits is certainly in many cases intelligent\nand deliberate, as, e.g. on March 16, 1908 (see Proceedings,\nVol. XXIV., p. 67), where, in the midst of allusions to\nthe Mneid, she says to the sitter :\n\" Don't you hear me ?\nMr. Myers is whispering in one ear and I am trying to\nget it out at the other.\"\nOn the whole, as I have said, I have little doubt that the\nspeaking intelligence of the waking-stage not only generally\nbut practically always regards itself as Mrs. Piper\n\u2014\nsometimes speaking for herself and sometimes repeating\nwhat she hears spirits say. There are, it is true, certain\nextreme and comparatively rare cases difficult to reconcile\nwith this view. These, or some of them, may perhaps,\nhowever, represent lapses into something resembling the\ntrance proper after the marked break between trance\nand waking-stage. One of these peculiar cases occurred\non January 16, 1907 ; it is quoted in full in the Appendix.\nOn this occasion the waking-stage began with the clear\nutterance in the first person, and in a deep voice like a\nman's, of a communication substantially and unmistakeably\n\f236 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthe same as one which Rector had given in the third\nperson during the trance proper as a message from Mr.\nJoseph Marble. It is very difficult to distinguish this from\na brief voice communication with Mr. Marble as control.\nThe case just referred to is, I think, the only one the\nrecord of which mentions a change of voice in the waking-\nstage,1\nbut there are others where a spirit seems to con-\nverse with the sitter in the waking-stage without any\nacknowledged intervention of Mrs. Piper. Something of\nthis kind seems to have happened on April 8, and on\nOctober 21, 1901 (see Appendix, pp. 577, 582), when\nthere was a short conversation between MyersP and\nHodgson. Again, on April 2, 1902 (see Appendix, p.\n585) Bennie Junot seems to speak himself to Hodgson in\nthe waking-stage, and gives veridical information\u2014or, at\nany rate, information which leads to the recovery of the\nlost dog Rounder. 2\nIt happened on April 27, 1908,\nwhen Myers is represented as speaking, and as answering\ndirectly when Mr. Dorr asks a question. The following\nis an extract from Mr. Dorr's record of this waking-stage :\nHave no doubts, no fears ; I am Frederic Myers that\nonce lived among you, among men * * * I said the\nDoctor would recover from his rheumatism.\n(G. B. D. Who is that ?)\nDr. Verrall. Do you know him \\ He is a friend of mine.\nIt apparently happened again on May 12 and 13, 1908\n(see Appendix, pp. 609, 610, for the full account). On the\nlatter date Mr. Dorr, who was again the sitter and recorder,\nwrites about the waking-stage :\nR. H. appears, talking in the first person to G. B. D.\n1\nWe have possibly another example in the waking-stage of February\n26, 1907 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 95). Immediately after vain\nattempts by Mrs. Piper to say the word \" laurel \" distinctly, the words\naphasia, aphasia \" were uttered. Mr. Piddington, who was the sitter\nand recorder, recalls these words as having been said in a hurried whisper\ncoming out in a way very different from that in which Mrs. Piper's utter-\nances in the waking-stage usually do. It gave him the feeling of having\ncaught a remark by MyersP or G. P... which the speaker had not meant\nhim to overhear.\n2\nFor the details of this case see Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., pp. 515-518.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 237\nin a direct way unusual in the subliminal of these sittings.\nWhat he talks about, however, is merely the Latin verses\nwhich he is endeavouring to translate, attempts at transla-\ntion and questions about the words he has misunderstood.\nIn the following two waking-stages, reported by Miss\nTheodate Pope, we again have Hodgson seeming to con-\nverse directly with the sitter and in the first person,\nbut nevertheless Mrs. Piper's remarks in propria persona\nseem to show that she regarded herself as present\nthroughout.\n{Dec. 21, 1908. Waking-stage.)\n{HodgsonP,\nMyersp, and others had communicated during the\nsitting. There had been a good deal said about the\ndesirability of writing in Greek, Latin and Italian for\ntest purposes.

P. writing] Oh I forgot I must not talk.\nThe changes here are decidedly confusing. Judging from\nwhat Mrs. Piper says in the last paragraph, some of the\nabsurd attempts at a foreign language are to be attributed\nto a Myers personality. Then with the words \" Hello\nGeorge,\" a Hodgson personality comes in. \" George\n\"\nis probably Mr. Dorr, and, if so, there is an illusion as to\nwho the sitter is, such as not infrequently occurs in the\nwaking-stages ;\nonly it is generally Mrs. Piper in propria\npersona who addresses Mr. Dorr as Hodgson e.g. on Dec. 8,\n1902 (see above, p. 228), or as Mr. Piddington in 1908. 1\nThe remarks about Boodle, etc., show a knowledge of what\nhas occurred during the sitting. Yet, after Miss Pope has\nspoken and the Hodgson personality apparently recognises\nher identity, he greets her as though they had not met for\nsome time, although just before the trance proper ended\nthey had been talking like old friends. Mrs. Piper clearly\ncomes in herself with the first \" Oh.\" The minister is Im-\nperator or Rector. Who it is that says \" We're up the\nmountain, etc.,\" is not clear.

The \" I will, etc.,\" seems to be a reply by\nHodgson to Miss Pope, and the next words to be addressed\nby him to Mrs. Piper, and then comes a conversation\nbetween her and him.\nDirect speaking by Hodgsonp seems to have occurred again\nin the waking-stage of Mrs. Piper'sTlast sitting\u2014July 31,\n1911\u2014recorded by Sir Oliver Lodge,r and which is quoted\nin the Appendix to Chapter III. \\ (p. 516). And here\nalso Mrs. Piper would ajDpear to have regarded herself\n\f240 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nas present if we attribute the words \" There's Mabel\n\"\nand \" I got that through \" to her, as I think we should.\nThe waking-stage record begins :\n[She waved her hand and said :\n\u2014\n]\nThere's Mabel.\nI wanted to speak but I couldn't. God bless you\nyou dear old thing. I love you always always. We\nshall meet again. By bye.\nI brought her Lodge I want you to know who she\nis. I'm Dick\n[O. J. L. whispered into Mrs. Piper's ear, \" Yes, J know, Dick\nHodgson, and you brought Mabel.\" * * *]\n[Satisfied sigh.] I got that through. Good-bye.\nIt is clear in all these instances that the sitter had\nthe impression of conversation with a control or com-\nmunicator other than Mrs. Piper, like that in a voice\nsitting, and it seems probable that a tendency to some\nsort of assimilation between the method in trance proper\nand in waking-stage was being developed in the later\nyears of Mrs. Piper's trance. Perhaps the remark in the\nwaking-stage of May 12, 1908, \" I'm half myself and half\nsomebody else \" (see Appendix, p. 609), points the same way.\nIn connexion with these cases, where spirits seem to be\nconceived as conversing directly with the sitters, we may\nnotice some, where the beginning of the waking-stage carries\non, without apparent recognition of any interruption, the\nlast part of the trance\u2014notwithstanding the interval of deep\nsleep that has intervened. This happened, for instance, on\nJune 3, 1898 (see Appendix, p. 565), when the trance having\nended before Imperator could write his accustomed prayer,\nit came early in the waking-stage.\nProbably a similar making up in the waking-stage for an\nomission in the trance proper is illustrated at the sitting of\nJuly 2, 1902 (see Appendix, p. 587), when, as it was the last\nsitting before prolonged summer holidays, various frequent\ncommunicators send farewell messages of affection to their\nfriends. One would have expected this to be done in the\ntrance proper, as happened e.g. at the corresponding sitting\nin 1903. But most of the trance communication was taken\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 241\nup by discussion and what one may call reconciliation between\nHodgson and Rector, who had had one of their not very\ninfrequent misunderstandings about the management of the\nsittings, and there was apparently little time for anything\nelse. Imperator and Rector take their leave, and then,\nwhen the waking-stage begins, come the omitted greetings\nfrom communicators to their friends.\nClear continuity occurs on March 13, 1901, when Hodgson's\nrecord describes the end of the trance and beginning of the\nwaking-stage as follows :\n(March 13, 1901.)\n{Rector and Imperator take leave. Hodgson writes :} [I was\nabout to take the pencil out of fingers when the hand\nbent somewhat spasmodically holding pencil tight, and\nwrote in strong characters, contrasting with the immediately\nprevious faint writing] Remember * * * [Pass-sentence]\nHyslop 1\n{The waking-stage begins :\n\u2014\n}\nThat's my test to him.

Tell Hodgson there's more truth than poetry in it.\nThere's Fred and Doctor Myers. All transparent. That's\npretty,\nEtc.\nOn March 20, 1901, again, at the end of the sitting\nHodgson was reading to Rector a letter from a previous\nsitter to a communicator, but had to stop half-way\nthrough because it was time for the sitting to end. The\nwaking-stage begins :\nThat so ! All I could do to stay and hear it. Better so.\nFarewell.\n1\nPresumably Professor Hyslop's father. Professor Hyslop, in con-\nnection with a medium he was experimenting with, had been spoken of\nduring the sitting.\na\n\f242 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nThis kind of continuity is occasionally strikingly shown\nin going into trance. One instance of it is given in the\nAppendix to Chapter III., p. 448, the case where Proctor,\nwho on July 3, 1895, made his first and only appearance\nin the trance proper, is also introduced as making remarks\nin the preceding going-into-trance-stage.\nOn March 15, 1897 (see Appendix, p. 556), the exact words\nsaid by Mrs. Piper going into trance, perhaps repeating after\nImperator, are said by Imperator to Hodgson as soon as\nthe usual greetings have been exchanged.\nIn the following case, recorded by Hodgson, Imperator\nseems to play successive parts of the same drama in the\nstage of going into trance, in a somewhat ambiguous early\npart of the trance before the writing begins, and in some\nof the first written sentences\n:\n(March 29, 1897.)\n[After a short time she breathes heavily, and this is\nfollowed by repetition in low voice of what seems to be\na prayer which she is repeating after some one. Following\nthis is heavy breathing again. Entranced completely.\nAttempt to speak. I finally caught what sounded like\n\" Imperator Servus Dei,\" but couldn't hear anything else.\nThe hand made sign of a cross and touched the (Mrs. P.'s)\nforehead and apparently assented when I repeated \" Imper-\nator Servus Dei.\" Soon the attempts at speech ceased,\nand the hand gave indications of being \" more seized.\"]\n[Imperator writes]\nImp. -|- Hail R.

We know of higher and better\nspirits whom we prefer to bring. We have faith that\nwe shall be all powerful.\nA few weeks earlier, on March 5, 1897, something of the\nsame kind happened with George Eliot as control (see\nAppendix to Chapter III., p. 491). Mrs. Piper going into\ntrance said, \" I'll never be able to remember that,\" and\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 243\nappeared to attempt to recite some poetry. Then George\nEliot begins the trance by announcing herself and writing\nfragments of verse in an almost illegible hand, after\nwhich she greets Hodgson and explains that she was\nreciting poetry to a lady whom she saw passing over the\nboundary line. In both these last- mentioned cases, the\ngoing-into-trance drama is continued into or repeated in\nthe beginning of the trance proper, which beginning is\nalso more inchoate than is usual.\nBut the most curious case of the trance following up\nthe indications of the going-into-trance-stage occurred on\nApril 20, 1897 (see Appendix, p. 562). Mrs. Piper going\ninto trance had a vision apparently of Dr. Newbold.\nShe said, \" I think that must be Dr. Newbold, and he's a\nbad cold too.\" The first control in the trance is G. P., who,\nimmediately after greetings to Hodgson, says, \" Just left\nNewbold, saw him in chair reading, not feeling any too\nwell physically either.\" What are we to suppose happened\nin this case ? Did G. P. show Mrs. Piper a vision of Pro-\nfessor Newbold, or did he take her there with him ? Or\ndid she have a telepathic impression from G. P. ? Or\nwere the two intelligences, Mrs. Piper in the going-into-\ntrance-stage and the G. P. control, in effect the same, only\nin a state of, so to speak, broken up consciousness with\ndiscontinuity of memory ? Mrs. Piper not infrequently\nappeared to see spirits as she was going into trance, and\nthe spirits she saw were often those who controlled or\ncommunicated in the ensuing trance, especially those who\ndid so immediately the trance began. But the vision of\nApril 20, 1897, just described was different. What she\nsaw was not a spirit, but a living person, and the same living\nperson that the spirit who immediately afterwards con-\ntrolled said he had been seeing.1\nStudy of the connexions between the ideas of the trance\nproper and of the waking-stage is of the greatest importance\nas bearing on the nature and relations of the consciousnesses\ninvolved. In the cases just described, the connexion con-\nsists in a continuation in one state of what has been begun\n1\nThere is no indication that she placed this living person in the spirit\nworld (see above, p. 227).\n\f244 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nin another, or of the making good in the waking-stage of an\nomission in the preceding trance communication. But there\nis much other evidence of connexion\u2014indeed, there is some\nin almost every waking-stage. As a rule, there is no\nevidence that any connexion is recognised by the intelli-\ngences concerned, no avowal of knowledge in the waking-\nstage of what has occurred in the trance or vice versa.\nThe cases where such recognition is affirmed are, of\ncourse, very important, but it will be convenient to\nreserve them for discussion in connexion with a fuller\ndiscussion of the memory relations between Mrs. Piper's\nvarious states in Chapter VII.\nWhere the connexion between the ideas of the two states\nis not explicitly recognised in either, the commonest case\nis simply the appearance of the same personages in both.\nIt happens in most waking-stages that at least some of\nthe personages Mrs. Piper speaks of seeing or hearing\nhave figured as controls or communicators in the preceding\ntrance proper, and that this presence in both states is\nnot accidental is confirmed\u2014if confirmation be needed\u2014by\nfinding that on one occasion at least the absence of\nImperator is noted in both. On February 27, 1897, he\ndid not appear at all in the trance proper, and Stainton\nMoses who controlled during the last part of this said he\nwas sent in his place, and that he (Imperator) had \u00a3:\nbeen\ncalled in another direction.\" Accordingly Mrs. Piper\nvery properly sees nothing of him during the waking-\nstage, and remarks towards the end of it, \"I didn't see\nthe man with the gown on,\" i.e. Imperator.\nThe identity of personages in trance and waking-stage is\nby no means complete. All the trance personages do not\nnecessarily appear in the waking-stage, and, on the other\nhand, characters sometimes appear in the waking-stage who\nhave no connexion with the trance proper that immediately\npreceded it. I think, when this is so, they have always\nappeared in some earlier trance, at least I do not know of\nany clear case of a communicator appearing for the first\ntime in a waking-stage. This may, however, be an\naccident, for ideas other than the recognition of a person\nas present, do sometimes appear for the first time in a\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs, Piper's Trance Phenomena. 245\nwaking-stage. The reference to Ajax in the waking-stage\nof October 28, 1896 (see Appendix, p. 456), is perhaps an\ninstance, as I know of no previous reference to Ajax. The\nstatement by Bennie Junot in the waking-stage on April 2, 1902,\nthat \" John Welsh has Rounder \" (see p. 236, and Appendix,\np. 585) is certainly a case in point, and instances that\noccurred in the English sittings of 1906-7 and Mr. Dorr's\nsittings of 1908 have been published in Proceedings, Vols.\nXXII. and XXIV. The Rufus Miller case (December, 1905)\npresents the same feature\u2014the Christian name coming out\nfirst in the waking-stage. It is an interesting case, because\nthe erroneous idea that Rufus Miller was still alive is com-\nmon to two trance communications and an intervening\nwaking-stage\u2014not the waking-stage of either trance ; but\nthere is no knowledge explicitly shown of the waking-stage\nin the trances or vice versa, though the second trance com-\nmunication refers to the first across the ignored waking-\nstage. A note on the case, with quotation of the records,\nwill be found in the Appendix, pp. 598-601.\nA marked and almost verbally exact correspondence of\nideas without acknowledgment is shown in the trance and\nwaking-stage of January 16, 1907 (Joseph Marble), already\nreferred to above in another connexion (pp. 235-236, and\nquoted in the Appendix, p. 602). Another good instance\noccurred on December 12, 1896. Doctor, who at this time\nsuggested that his name was Lydgate,1\ncontrolling, said at\nthe close of the trance proper :\n\" Well we draw our forces\nfrom our own world.\" In the waking-stage Mrs. Piper\nsaid :\n\" Doctor Lindrum (?) [stumbling over name] says\ndraw forces from our world.\" A case occurred again on\nJanuary 28, 1902, in connexion with the sphere-spear cross-\ncorrespondence (see Proceedings, Vol. XX., pp. 213-216).\nThe following is an extract from the trance proper\u2014sitter\nand recorder Hodgson.

Hodgson\nsuggested that they should take Mrs. Piper's spirit there,\nand accordingly they professed to do so, and described\nher being seen by the English medium. Of this visit to\nEngland Mrs. Piper was apparently aware in the waking-\nstage, which is recorded by Hodgson as follows :\nI saw every one of them\n(R. H. Every one of whom ?)\nI saw every single one of them.\nI saw Myers as plain as day.\n(R. H. Did he see you ?)\nWho's that speaking to me ?

Doubtful.\nLow murmur, hard to catch] 2\nWe should here have very interesting evidence tending\nto support the assertion that Mrs. Piper's spirit is removed\nby spirits during the trance, if there had been any truth in\nher account of what she saw. As it is, this account must\nshare with the statements in the trance proper Myers's\n1\nIt had been stated in the trance that Myers's medium had seen Mrs.\nPiper's spirit.\n2\nA vase of flowers in Myers's own room had been casually mentioned\nin the trance, but not in connexion with Mrs. Piper's spirit.\n\f248 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ncondemnation of the whole series of descriptions of what\nwent on at the English sittings as absolutely without\ntruth. 1\nThis being so, who was the dreamer or inventor\nwho manufactured these stories ? If it was not some ele-\nment of Mrs. Piper herself that was originally responsible,\ndid she share the dream telepathically ? Or did a deceiving\nspirit persuade her that she had been at the English sitting ?\nIt seems easier to suppose that Mrs. Piper dreamt through-\nout\u2014in one form appropriate to the occasion in the trance,\nand in another, corresponding to some extent with the first\nbut not identical with it, in the waking-stage.\nSomething of the same kind happened before the\nImperator regime began, in connexion with the search for the\nlost boy in Mexico (see waking-stages of November 16 2\nand\n18, and December 8, 1896, in the Appendix, pp. 551, 552).\nThere had been no profession in the trance proper of taking\nMrs. Piper's spirit to Mexico, but her waking-stage per-\nsonality seems to have conceived itself as sharing the\nsearch and seeing the persons and buildings which had\nbeen mentioned in the trance. It is noticeable that on\nDecember 8, 1896, she acts in the waking-stage as though\nbeing shown a building\u2014apparently one described in the\ntrance proper at a previous sitting\u2014then and there. As\nbefore said (p. 112), there is no reason to regard any of\nthis Mexican business as veridical.\nAnother variety of connexion was shown on February 18,\n1903 (see Appendix, p. 591), when Mrs. Piper in the waking-\nstage had a vision\u2014the first for many years\u2014of Phinuit,\nwho had been spoken of during the trance. This instance\ndiffers from the others in that the vision of Phinuit seems\nto have been the result not of any experience of the control\nor communicator during the sitting, but merely of its being\nmentioned that the communicator had seen him.\nThe waking-stage visions of personages who control or\ncommunicate in the trance are often very vivid and definite.\nFor instance, visions of Phinuit, Rector, and Imperator are\ndescribed in a way that shows that their appearance is\n1\nSee Appendix to Chapter III., p. 507.\n2\nThe waking-stage of November 16 presents the curious feature of Mrs.\nPiper being very much out of breath owing to imaginary running.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 249\nvividly conceived. A description of Phinuit on October 12,\n1896 (p. 551), of Imperator and Rector on June 29, 1898,\nand of Rector on June 20, 1905 (p. 566), will be found\nin the Appendix. As regards Rector it must be admitted\nthat he appears to have shaved hi the interval between the\ntwo descriptions if they both refer to him.\nBut one of the most important and interesting points\nabout Mrs. Piper's waking-stage is that the visions of\npeople that occurred in them were apparently sometimes\nveridical. She appeared to see friends of sitters as the\nlatter knew them, when she cannot possibly have seen\nthem in life herself. There is a good deal of evidence\npointing to this. Not only were her descriptions of their\nfriends\u2014often given with great detail. 1\nand sometimes\nincluding peculiarities of movement and gesture\u2014generally\nadmitted by sitters to be wholly or in the main correct,2\nbut she has on several occasions picked out from among\nother photographic portraits that of the person thus seen.\nI have quoted above her recognition of the photograph of\nG. P. (pp. 213-215).\nWe have another case among Hodgson's unpublished\nrecords, which occurred in 1900. A new sitter had three\nsittings in succession\u2014June 11, 12, and 13, 1900. Her\ndeceased husband wrote a little himself, and then com-\nmunicated through G. P. and Rector. The communications\nwere confused and their evidential value difficult to\nestimate, 3\nbut some description of the communicator was\ngiven in all three waking-stages, and Mrs. Piper picked\nout his portrait in a photographic group of thirty-one men\nin the waking-stage on the 11th and in another group of\nseventeen on the 12th. The records of the waking-stages\nof the 11th and 12th are given in full in the Appendix,\n1\nThere was sometimes, I think, a little feeling about for details. See\ne.g. the remarks about moustache and blue eyes on June 11, 1900,\nAppendix, p. 573.\n2\nIn this power Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage resembled Adele Maginot\n(see above, Chapter III., p. 83).\n3\nThe communicator could not remember his own profession or the name\nby which he called his wife, and\u2014what is worse\u2014made bad shots at both ;\nand yet there were some good things evidentially in the course of these\nand later sittings, besides the recognition of the portrait.\n\f250 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\npp. 573-576. The mention on the 12th that the com-\nmunicator \" laughs one-sided \" is an instance of correct\ndescription of peculiarity of movement. It is to be\nnoticed that the photographs were on both days sub-\nmitted to Mrs. Piper before she had completely recovered\nher normal consciousness, and that on the second day,\nafter fixing on the likeness, she seems to have gone back\nagain into a somewhat deeper phase of the waking-stage.\nThe G. P. photograph was selected by Mrs. Piper after the\nwaking-stage, when apparently quite normal again. And\nso it was in the Joseph Marble cases (December, 1906, and\nMay, 1907) described by Sir Oliver Lodge in Proceedings,\nVol. XXIII., pp. 275-278. G. P. had, however, been seen\nin the waking-stage and the fact was remembered, and in\nthe second Joseph Marble case the same is true. The first\nJoseph Marble case is somewhat different, because he had\nundertaken in the trance to show himself, and because,\nnotwithstanding this, there is no indication of his having\nbeen seen that day in the waking-stage. I shall return to\nthis case in Chapter VII. pp. 273-276.\nDuring Mrs. Piper's last series of sittings a very interesting\nexperiment is reported by Sir Oliver Lodge, which throws\nlight on the waking-stage consciousness and memory, or,\nat least, suggests possible answers to questions. At a sitting\non December 2, 1910, a locket which had belonged to one\nof the communicators had been brought out by the sitter\nand remarked on by the communicator. At the end of the\nwaking-stage, when Mrs. Piper was almost normal again,\nthough not quite\u2014she had apparently felt a snap, and she\nhad just talked about the darkness of the room and about\nfeeling numb\u2014Sir Oliver handed her the locket in its case.\nThe sight of it seemingly put her back into the waking-stage\ndream. Sir Oliver reports as follows :\n(Mrs. Piper pounced on it with interest saying,)\nThat was the little girl's. That was what I saw. The\nlady was trying to tell me about it. She said\nsomething about putting hairs in it.\nThe little girl held it up before her eye (Imitating\nthe action of an eye-glass,) like as if she wanted\nher eye-lash in it.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 251\nThere is a lady there looks like aunt, but very young\nwhen she went over.\n(Referring again to the locket,) It's a pretty thing,\nisn't it ? Is that glass or iron on it %\n(O. J. L. I don't know.)\nThey were trying to figure it out what it was, and\nthey thought it was flowers.\nOh dear I'm afraid I'm not very intelligent. I wish\nI could remember what they said but my thoughts\nare going.\nThey were all there, I never saw anything so pretty,\nsuch a happy group. And all of a sudden they leave\nme. Why do they ?\nI feel my head going round and round and then\nthere's a snappy sound.\nI got it in my head that you were going to leave me\nand I hadn't strength to speak and tell you not\nto go. My thoughts had begun to go. I wanted\nto say Don't leave me, but I couldn't. I felt that\nif you left me to-day I didn't know what was to become\nof me.\n{This about her fear of being left, refers to an incident\nthat occurred at the beginning of the sitting when Mrs. Piper\nwas going into trance but was only partly off. After a little\nconversation about this Mrs. Piper said, referring to the locket\nagain :\n}\nDo you know I saw all that, or I saw a representa-\ntion of that. It's a funny thing but there's a little\ngirl up there and she was going to put something\ninside it. She wants her mother to put her hair\nin it. Where's her mother ? I don't know what\nit means at all. I saw a perfect representation\nof it just like that. It's queer, I don't see how\nyou got it down here so quickly. Isn't that queer %\nIt's transfiguration.\nWell now that's quite clear.\n(Mrs. Piper here looked round over her shoulder. There was\nno one else now in the room, and she said\u2014\n)\nI thought Briscoe was there. {Mr. Briscoe had been\nthere just before she began to go into the trance.}\n\f252 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nDo you know who that gentleman is that stands\njust in front of me here i He has a dark moustache,\na very striking face, a tall gentleman with square\nshoulders. He constantly stands here just in front\nof me. I don't see him now you know.\nI think I'll get up and sit in the armchair by the\nfire. My feet are cold.\n(This being done and her back turned, 0. J. L. looked through\nfirst some volumes of Proceedings and then in \" Fragments of\nProse and Poetry \" for a portrait of Gurney {who had also\nbeen one of the communicators during the sitting and had\nbeen mentioned by name earlier in the waking-stage.} Hiding\nthe name, he brought it and put it in front of Mrs. Piper\nto see whether she would remark on it. She pounced on it\ninstantly.)\nThat is the very same man, the very man. Oh I'm so\nglad you showed me that. It's the same man * * *\nHe is a tall man with square shoulders. He's very\nearnest. He spoke to me. I wish I could remember\nthat a little while longer. He had rather a stoutish\nlady with him, a motherly looking lady. His face\nis clear and younger than that, and he seemed to\nbe working hard, so busy.\nYou knew who I meant. You guessed it from the\ndescription. How did you know ?\n(O. J. L. Well I guessed.)\nIt isn't your brother, is it ? Excuse me asking, but\nhe seemed very near to you when I was over\nthere.

J.

It was not\nat all secure and certain like the other one. All it could mean\nwas that the lady spoken of in the waking-stage had been\nsomething like that.)\nAfter some time spent in ordinary conversation with\nMrs. Piper and her daughter, who had been called in,\nSir Oliver Lodge asked her :\nO. J. L Did you ever know Mr. Gurney ?\nMrs. Piper. No I never knew him.\nO. J. L. No, I suppose he was dead before you came over to\nEngland.1\nMrs. Piper. I don't know. I never saw him. I don't know\nwhat he looked like. I should not know him if I\nsaw him. Perhaps Miss Johnson has a picture of\nhim in her room ?\nO. J. L. Yes.\nMrs. Piper. Oh well I suppose I have seen it, but I never\nidentified it or knew which it was. I don't feel to\nknow his appearance properly.\nIt is the locket experiment I chiefly wish to call atten-\ntion to here. In the trance proper the little girl as\ncommunicator had spoken about the locket and about\nsomething inside it, but in the record of the waking-\nstage, before it was shown, though the little girl is\nmentioned the locket is not. We cannot, however, be\nsure from this that it did not form any part of the\nwaking-stage dream, for Mrs. Piper probably does not\nmention all she sees, and, moreover, some of the waking-\nstage utterances are almost always too inarticulate to\nbe caught. Mrs. Piper cannot have seen the locket itself\nuntil Sir Oliver Lodge showed it to her as described above.\nHer right hand doubtless handled it during the trance when\nit was produced, but she could not have seen it then, as\nher face was turned away on the pillows. Nor, again,\nwas there, so far as we can judge, any knowledge in\n1 Gumey died in 1888, and Mrs. Piper's first visit to England was in\n1889.\n\f254 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nMrs. Piper's normal mind of the little girl, who was to\nher at the moment of the experiment therefore probably a\nforgotten dream, recalled by the sight of the locket. Why\nand how did the locket recall it ? How did a never-before-\nseen locket get appropriately associated with an un-\nremembered dream-child ?\nIn trying to answer this we have first to observe that the\nrecognition of the locket, and the recognition of likenesses\nof sitters' friends, are phenomena resembling each other\nso much as to make it probable that they are both to\nbe explained in the same way. If this be so, then the\nrecognition of the locket cannot have depended on its\nhaving been actually present and handled during the\ntrance proper, for this possibility is absent in the case\nof sitters' friends. We need not, therefore, consider either\nwhether vision without eyes (clairvoyance) of a material\nobject ever occurs, or whether a sense of touch may be\nso delicate as to make construction from it of an exact\nvisual image possible.\nThere remain explanations by telepathy either from a\nsitter or a spirit. What exactly would have to be telepathi-\ncally conveyed ? If there really was a visual hallucination\nfully representing the locket before the actual locket was\nseen, the telepathy must have come in there ; the vision\nmust have been telepathically produced. We have no evi-\ndence of this in the case of the locket except Mrs. Piper's\nstatements after seeing it, and this might have been a\npseudo-memory, produced by the association of it with\nthe little girl telepathically derived in a sudden and con-\nvincing way from Sir Oliver Lodge at the moment of his\nshowing the locket. A hypothesis of this kind was\nsuggested by Hodgson as an explanation of the utility of\n\" influences \" (which are to be discussed in Chapter VIII.),\nand it was as an \" influence \" that the locket was intro-\nduced at the sitting. The hypothesis might, perhaps, be\nstretched to include the cases of selection of photographs\nof friends, although the sitter does turn away while the\nselection is made. But in these cases there generally has\nbeen some description of a vision given before the photo-\ngraph afterwards declared to resemble it has been pro-\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 255\nduced. And that Mrs. Piper does have vivid visions in\nthe waking-stage will not, I think, be doubted by any\none who has followed this chapter so far.\nOn the whole, I think, the hypothesis that these visions\nare sometimes telepathically produced and veridical, repre-\nsenting a person or thing so well as to be recognisable, is\nthe one that fits the facts best. Who the telepathic agent\nis, or whether there is a single agent or more than one, are\nquestions about which it is more difficult to come to a decision.\nIt is much to be regretted that Sir Oliver Lodge had no\nfurther opportunity of trying these important experiments,\nand that so few are recorded by Hodgson.\nQuestions of conscious memory in the waking-stage of\nthe trance, and vice versa, I propose, as already said, to\ndefer to the next chapter. But it will be well to say a\nfew words here about memory from one waking-stage to\nanother. There is some evidence of this, though not, I\nthink, a great deal.\nOf course the recurrence of similar ideas and images in\ndifferent waking-stages about the same period, which I\nmentioned above (p. 229), cannot be accidental. There\nmust be a causal connexion of some kind, either memory\nor similar external facts. But it need not be the\nconscious memory of the waking-stage intelligence. This\nmay not be aware that it had had the same ideas, the\nsame dream experiences, before. To be sure that there is\nsuch a memory we want it stated plainly, or at least\napparently implied in what is said. There are very few\nclear statements of this kind, and the stratified memory\nduring the waking-stage tends, by making the communi-\ncation fragmentary, to reduce the occasions for them.\nThere are, however, sometimes indications that the experi-\nences of the waking-stage which Mrs. Piper is going through\nare not new to her. A very definite one occurred on\nNovember 13, 1900 (see Appendix, p. 577), when she\nsaid\n:\nI wish I could remember where I go. Sometimes I go\nfarther away than others, but I can't be dead, can I ?\nThere are also references to having seen waking-stage\n\f256 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\npersonages before, as on December 22, 1892 (see above,\np. 213, footnote) :\nshe saw the same gentleman she saw once before ;\njust\nsaw him smile ; did not see him do anything\nand on June 14, 1895 (see above, p. 221) ;\nI saw the same lovely lady I saw yesterday,\nor on April 8, 1897 (see above, p. 233) :\nI saw that gentleman {i.e. Imperator} with the cross again.\nAnd there are comparisons, as on October 12, 1896 (see\nAppendix, p. 551), when she says she has seen\nthat man again. That must be Phinuit. I never saw\nhim so clearly before.\nThe statement \"Margaret and Ruth grown much larger\nthan when I saw {them} before\" made in the waking-\nstage of June 15, 1895, and in substance again on June 24,\n1895 (see Appendix, p. 550), must refer back to some\nprevious experience either in a former waking-stage or\notherwise, and if we had more complete information it\nmight throw interesting light on the relations between\nMrs. Piper's different states of consciousness. Ruthie and\nMargaret were twin children of Dr. and Mrs. Thaw (see\nProceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 384-385 and 536-582). Ruthie\ndied at the age of fifteen months near the end of 1891\nand Margaret earlier. Mrs. Piper had never seen them or\nknown anything about them in life. In the first half of\n1892, Dr. and Mrs. Thaw had sittings with her, and the\nrecords of Ruthie's communications through Phinuit are\namong the most interesting evidential matter concerning\nMrs. Piper that we have. This was before the days of\nregular waking-stages, and we have no records of any in\nconnexion with these sittings. How then did the waking-\nstage Mrs. Piper know about these children ? Of course,\nif she did know about them in 1892. it would be natural\nthat she should think of them as grown much larger in\n1895, but we can hardly suppose that this experience\nreferred to the difference between them as seen in the\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 257\nwaking-stage of April 24, 1895 (see above, p. 219), and\nin those of June, 1895, and I do not think we have\nrecords of any waking-stage mention of them earlier.\nThere easily may, however, have been waking-stage\nvisions unmentioned by Mrs. Piper, or unrecorded, and\nperhaps the easiest hypothesis to make is that she remem-\nbered such a vision.\nAnother possibility is that the recollection was derived\nfrom the normal Mrs. Piper's knowledge or dreams, for\nthough no account of Dr. Thaw's sittings had been published\nin 1895, it is practically certain, I think, that Mrs. Piper\nhad been told about them in her normal state, since she had\nstayed with Dr. and Mrs. Thaw as their guest, and there\nwould have been no advantage\u2014rather the reverse\u2014in con-\ncealing from her, at any rate after the first few sittings, that\ncommunications were believed to have come from the\nchildren. Then, again, we may ask whether the recollection\ncould have been derived from Phinuit;\nfiltered through\nfrom his consciousness\u2014whether he is a phase of Mrs. Piper\nor a separate entity\u2014to the waking-stage consciousness,\nso as to appear to the latter a memory of its own. Or,\nagain, we may ask whether Mrs. Piper's spirit, or that part\nof her which constitutes the waking-stage consciousness, is\npresent with communicators and controls during the trance\nproper. But as regards this it must be remembered\nthat there is no indication that the controls conceive it as\npresent when they are acting as intermediaries between\ncommunicators and sitters\u2014in fact the contrary is, on the\nwhole, suggested (see Chapter II., pp. 67-70). Altogether\nthe case under discussion does not by itself furnish\nsufficient data for arriving at a conclusion as to its\ninterpretation\n\f258 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nCHAPTER VII.\nRelation to each other of Mrs. Piper's Different\nStates of Consciousness.\nThe relation to each other, especially as regards memory,\nof Mrs. Piper's normal consciousness, her trance state\nproper, and the waking-stage that precedes and follows\nit, is of great importance, and has not in the preceding\nchapters been dealt with at all fully.\nInvestigators are generally agreed that the normal Mrs.\nPiper has no conscious knowledge of what passes during the\ntrance. Statements on this point by Sir Oliver Lodge and\nby Hodgson will be found in Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 445,\nand Vol. VIII., p. 54. The absence of conscious knowledge\nwould not of course imply that there was no subliminal\nmemory of what had passed, or that portions of this\nmight not be brought into the supraliminal consciousness\nby suitable stimuli and thus affect actions or thoughts. I\ndo not think we have positive evidence that this happens,\nbut it would be rash to assume that it does not. I can\nimagine, for instance, that association of ideas might\ninduce the emergence of some memory of a trance\nincident into the normal consciousness in the same way\nthat\u2014as most of us probably have occasionally had to\nsurmise\u2014a forgotten dream is responsible for a pseudo-\nmemory, an erroneous impression, obtruding itself into our\nwaking life. And I can imagine that if in her normal con-\ndition Mrs. Piper came across, e.g. a name or a poem that\nhad been referred to in the trance, her attention might be\nattracted to it, and information or ideas about it might\nbe then intentionally or unintentionally acquired by her\nin a way that would not have happened but for a sub-\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 259\nconscious interest in the subject due to the trance happen-\nings. At any rate, it would be unsafe to assume either that\nno subconscious knowledge of the trance exists, or that\nno interpenetration from the subconscious can occur while\nMrs. Piper's conscious knowledge of the trance happenings\nis limited to what she has learnt through the talk of\nsitters or through published statements.\nThe normal state is less cut off from the waking-stage,\nof parts of which there is often, as we have seen in the\nlast chapter, an evanescent memory as the normal con-\nsciousness returns. The waking-stage happenings apparently\nvanish in the same sort of way that our dreams often do,\nand by special effort or attention can sometimes be made\nto persist longer, and even perhaps permanently. Some\nmeasure of the duration of these evanescent impressions\nis afforded by Sir Oliver Lodge's experiments on the\nrecognition of the photograph of Joseph Marble (see below,\npp. 274-276).\nThe converse question, whether the controls\u2014that is,\nthe consciousness of the trance proper\u2014share the know-\nledge possessed by Mrs. Piper of what she thinks and\ndoes, or of what happens to her in her normal condition,\nis more difficult to answer, and different views on the\nsubject have been expressed. It is discussed by Sir\nOliver Lodge in Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 448, and Vol.\nXXIII., pp. 177-181 ;\nby Dr. Walter Leaf, Proceedings,\nVol. VI., p. 560 ; and by Hodgson, Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII., p. 55. Up to a certain point there is agreement.\nI do not think that any one doubts that Mrs. Piper's\nhabitual or memorised knowledge\u2014her general stock of\nacquirements, or what we may call memory transformed\ninto habit 1\n\u2014is to a very large extent if not completely shared\nby the controls. They share, for instance, her knowledge\nof language and of writing, and apparently her general\ninformation ; and that these acquirements as used by\n1\nReaders of M. Bergson's works, especially Matiere et Memoire, will\nrecognise the distinction here assumed between two kinds of memory :\n(a) the recalling of facts and experiences as events in time and space, and\n(b) what I have called memorised knowledge, or memory transformed into\nhabit.\n\f260 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthe controls are Mrs. Piper's acquirements is shown by\ntheir limitations. The controls cannot apparently use\nlanguages with which Mrs. Piper is unfamiliar, although\nsome of the persons they profess to be spoke such\nlanguages on earth ; and the general statements about\nscience or historj^ or philosophy or contemporary politics\nshow, broadly speaking, as we saw in Chapters II. and III.,\nlimitations of knowledge natural in Mrs. Piper, but not\nnatural in the professed controls. I think that few investi-\ngators who have thought about the subject would greatly\ndisagree with this ; and on the hypothesis that the controls\nare spirits distinct from Mrs. Piper, it would be explained by\nthe necessity of using an organism trained in a particular\nway. Thus Hodgson, describing a discussion with Phinuit\non the latter's inability to speak French, though claiming\nto be a French doctor, says {Proceedings, Vol. VIII..\np. 50) :\nI replied that this explanation {i.e. the one offered by\nPhinuit} was very surprising, and that a much more\nplausible one would be that he was obliged to use the\nbrain of the medium, and could therefore manifest no\nmore familiarity with French than she possessed. This\n\u2014trite enough-\u2014suggestion appeared to Phinuit also more\nplausible, since a few days later he offered it himself to\nanother sitter as an explanation of his inability to sustain\na conversation in French !\nBut the possession of Mrs. Piper's memorised knowledge\nis also, of course, shared by the waking-stage conscious-\nness, while yet there are undoubtedly breaks of some\nsort in memory between the trance and the waking-\nstage, within the waking-stage itself, and also between\nthe waking-stage and the normal state that follows it.\nNone of these breaks go so deep as to cut off Mrs.\nPiper's memorised knowledge, which evidently persists\nthrough all the changes. The question which it is difficult\nto answer is whether the break which there clearly is\nbetween the trance and the preceding normal state\u2014if\nit is true that the working of the trance-consciousness\nis unknown to the normal consciousness\u2014cuts off anything\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 261\nfrom the trance-consciousness. Does the trance-conscious-\nness, potentially at leasts know all that is known to the\nnormal consciousness\u2014not only memorised knowledge, but\nrecent facts and experiences ? And, if not. can we in\nany way distinguish what will and what will not be\ncarried on into the trance-consciousness ?\nIt is on these questions that the evidence is uncertain.\nSir Oliver Lodge says in 1S90 (Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\np. 448)\n:\nSo far as my present experience has gone, I do not feel\nsure how far Mrs. Piper's knowledge or ignorance of\nspecific facts has an appreciable influence on the communi-\ncation of her trance personality.\nIn 1909 he goes rather further and says (Proceedings,\nVol. XXIII., p. 177) :\nIt seems to me that * * * her normal knowledge has in\nreality very little if any influence on the information\nthat is obtained during her trance. The trance personalities\nappear to be ignorant of, or to be groping after a\nnumber of things that Mrs. Piper knows quite well.\nAnd again, p. 181 :\nI myself am unable to trace much, if any, connexion\nbetween the trance knowledge and her normal knowledge.\nFor instance, a sitter introduced by name is no more\nlikelv to have his name mentioned during a sitting than\none who is introduced as an anonymous stranger. I make\na general statement of this kind believing that careful\nanalysis will bear it out, and as a challenge to any one\nwho will bestow time and labour upon the work of\nanalysing the records from this point of view.1\nDr. Walter Leaf in 1890 took a view somewhat different\nfrom Sir Oliver Lodge. He says (Proceedings, Vol. VI.,\np. 559) :\n1\nNotwithstanding this challenge, I have not undertaken the proposed\nanalysis for the same reason that leads me to the conclusion that Hodgsonr\ns\nunpublished records cannot be made much use of for evidential purposes\n\u2014namely, that our knowledge of what Mrs. Piper's probable normal\nknowledge was, is too incomplete.\n\f262 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nThe question of the amount of communication existing\nbetween the two states is in the nature of the case\nobscure, and the evidence, so far as I have been able\nto see, is mainly negative. Dr. Phinuit makes many state-\nments which may easily have been learnt by Mrs. Piper ;\n* * * on the other hand knowledge about {the sitters}\nand their surroundings which Mrs. Piper certainly possessed,\nwas not as a rule given by Phinuit. * * * One observation\nbearing on this point was made by Mrs. Verrall. In her\nthree sittings, her eldest girl was frequently mentioned, but\nher name, which she had never mentioned to Mrs. Piper,\nwas not given. After her last sitting, No. 63, she purposely\ntook an opportunity of calling the child Helen in Mrs.\nPiper's presence. At the very next sitting where Mrs.\nVerrall was mentioned, that of Mrs. B., No. 66, Helen was\nnamed by Dr. Phinuit. There is therefore ground for\nsupposing that * * * the abnormal state is conscious of\nwhat goes on in the normal, but not vice versa ; but that\nthis connexion is purposely obscured.\nAn observation made on one occasion (February 27,\n1907), perhaps points in the same direction. Before the\ntrance began a half joking conversation was started by Mrs.\nPiper about the pencils used, and Mr. Piddington remarked\nthat very few had been broken during the trance writing\nlately, and added, \" Of course, you'll break a lot to-day on\npurpose.\" Whether by pure coincidence, or as the result\nof this remark, four or five pencils were broken by Rector\nduring the sitting that followed. Mrs. Piper had never\nreferred to the pencils before.\nHodgson writing in 1892 (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 55)\ndid not agree with Dr. Leaf, and was inclined to the\nview that \" the change to the trance personality involves\na partial obliteration of the facts known to the normal\nwaking self.\" He says (p. 54) :\nI have not been able to trace any continuity of\nmemory between Phinuit and Mrs. Piper. I have already\nstated my belief that Mrs. Piper is entirely ignorant of\nwhat occurs during the trance, and Phinuit is, or pretends\nto be, equally unaware of the knowledge possessed by\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 263\nMrs. Piper, and of the incidents which happen to her in\nher ordinary life. On one occasion, not long before a\nsitting (June 30th, 1888), Mrs. Piper was startled by a\nvery near sudden clap of thunder, and Phinuit, on being\nafterwards questioned, appeared to have no knowledge of\nthe circumstance, and apparently tried to guess at what\nhad occurred. Similarly on questioning Phinuit at one of\nmy early sittings concerning the life of Mrs. Piper, he\nprofessed ignorance on the subject, but said that he\nwould \"find out things\" about her.\n* * * *\nI have also met with several cases where Mrs. Piper\nknew not a little of the sitter's ordinary environment,\nnames of friends, etc., and yet this information was not\ngiven by Phinuit. Further, indeed, I have known Phinuit\nunder such circumstances to be confused and to make\nmistakes upon points well known to Mrs. Piper. Still, all\nthis \" ignorance \" may be \" the perfection of acting \" on\nthe part of Phinuit, * * *\nIt is the sophistication of the control, the impossibility\nof feeling sure that he is not acting, the certainty that\nhe sometimes is, and also that he is apt to say, regardless\nof consistency, whatever he thinks will support any\ntheory he has advanced, or will impress or please the\nsitter, that makes it impossible to arrive at a definite\nconclusion on the question under discussion\u2014without, at\nany rate, an opportunity of comparing a great many more\ncases bearing on it than we have. Hodgson believed\nthat in these respects G. P. and Rector & Co. were\nmore trustworthy than Phinuit, but as the reader already\nknows, I am unable myself to see much improvement.\nThe difficulty of coming to any conclusion is increased\nwhen we take account of other possibilities, besides a\nclean cut between what is known on one side and on\nthe other, of the division between the normal state and\nthe trance. There may be ordered selection, either of\nthings that are remembered out of a general forgetfulness,\nor of things that are forgotten among a general recol-\nlection. It is possible for instance that, as I suggested\n\f264 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nabove, subliminal interest in the topics of previous trances\nmay cause isolated facts like the name of Mrs. VerralTs\ndaughter to be carried on into the trance-consciousness\nwithout general memory. It is possible, similarly, that\nsuggestions connected with trance procedure, as in the\npencil case above, may select themselves for persistence.\nAnd, on the other hand, it is perhaps possible that a\ngeneral memory may be accompanied by forgetfulness of\nthings immediately connected with the train of thought\nbroken off by the trance, so that the impression made\nby a clap of thunder just before the trance began might\nvanish with the normal consciousness. 1\nAll this is con-\njecture. Some study of hypnotic memory has doubtless\nbeen made which might indicate whether the conjectures\nare plausible or not. But I do not know where to find\nsuch a study, and as experience would, I imagine, vary\nwith different hypnotic subjects and with different hypno-\ntists, as it certainly does with different mediums, we\nshould still in the end have to judge each case on its\nmerits.\nThe controls constantly profess ignorance of Mrs. Piper's\nstate of health or state of mind, of the effect on her of\nprolonged sittings, and so forth. But there appears to\nbe some inconsistency in the things they say. For\ninstance, on April 28, 1902 (see Appendix, p. 614), while\nprofessing to depend on the sitter for information about\nher health, they also say that they have themselves\ndiscovered that she has eaten injurious food. At other\ntimes they profess to know about her when not con-\ntrolling, though not when they are. Thus Mr. Dorr\nreports on March 20, 1905 :\nI asked some questions which I had in mind regarding\nthe extent to which they were able to perceive the\nphysical condition of the medium during the trance, in\nanswer to which Rector said that they only became\nconscious of it after leaving the light\u2014which was the\n1 This would be analogous, except that it lasted through the trance only,\nto the loss of memory of immediately preceding events liable to occur in\ncases of concussion of the brain.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 265\nreason why it was necessary for them to depend upon\nus on this side for observation of the passage of our\nearthly time. {This means that the controls did not\nalways know when the sitting was going on so long as\nto exhaust Mrs. Piper.}\nOn the other hand, with the help of some object\nbelonging to Mrs. Piper\u2014an \"influence'' (see next chapter)\n\u2014the controls, or perhaps I should say the medical\nmember of their band, diagnose her case when she is\nunwell, and prescribe for her as they would for another\nperson. This is done, of course, while the sitting goes\non, but it is not explained why her own body will not\nserve as an \" influence.\" After thus prescribing on\nJanuary 14, 1907, \"Dr. Oliver\" adds: \"I quite under-\nstand her case and will look after her \"\u2014agreeing with\nRector's remark above that he becomes conscious of her\ncondition after leaving the light.\nAs to knowledge of Mrs. Piper's thoughts and feelings,\nthe view maintained by the controls is curiously exemplified\nin the sittings of April 28 and 29, 1902 (see Appendix, pp.\n614. 616), where Hodgson acts as go-between between them\nand the normal Mrs. Piper. Whether the professed\nignorance is altogether genuine, it is, of course, impossible\nto say. Perhaps a possible view is that the trance\npersonalities really are largely ignorant of the normal\npersonality's thoughts and feelings, but are capable of\nrealising them in part by, e.g. directing special attention\nto them. An instance was quoted above (Chapter II.,\np. 68) in which on December 25, 1889, Phinuit did show\nknowledge of Mrs. Piper's feelings, though not of the\ncause for them, but as he professed to have learnt what\nhe knew by meeting her spirit going out crying as he\ncame in, it should perhaps count among instances of\nlucidity in moments of transition, to which I refer below.\nIn considering the value of the controls' assertions of\nignorance concerning Mrs. Piper, it must be kept in mind\nthat their theory that they are external spirits tem-\nporarily occupying Mrs. Piper's organism, but otherwise\nquite independent both of her and of other living people,\nmakes them anxious to show that they neither share\n\f266 Mrs. Henry Sidywick. [part\nMrs. Piper's normal knowledge nor acquire knowledge\ntelepathically from the sitter, and emphatic declarations\nare made on both points\u2014declarations so sweeping as to\novershoot the mark. The following is such a declaration\nabout Mrs. Piper's knowledge made by G. P. on January 4,\n1894 (sitter and recorder, Hodgson) :\nG. P. But sometimes there is bound to be confusion, which\noften I cannot prevent * * * Sometimes, when\nI am here, throwing my thoughts, or in other words,\ntrying to express them through this medium, I not\nonly express my own words, but I sometimes hear\nothers speaking, and now and then put in a word\nwrongly.\nIt is the times that you don't hear distinctly\n\u2014\nunderstand, there is a conglomeration of words all\nmixed up together, but believe me, it is no fault\nof ours. Yet, if there was the least remembrance,\nor trace even, of the medium's own brain, or\nthoughts left to be mixed up with ours, she would\nnot write as badly as we do sometimes. Yet I do\nknow\u2014Do you understand this 1 Consequently it is\nno fault of hers, and if she was the most intelligent\nperson on earth . . .\nR. H. It would make no difference.\nG. P. No not the slightest.\nIt is worth noting as evidence that the trance, including\nthe waking-stage, fills a gap of which the normal con-\nsciousness is unaware except from external signs, that\nthe idea in Mrs. Piper's mind just before she begins to\nsink into trance is apt to recur as soon as she is normal\nagain. As she put it to Mr. Piddington on January 28,\n1907, immediately after the sitting and quite spontaneously,\n\" What I think about last when I go to sleep 1\ncomes\nback to me first of all when I wake.\" Mr. Piddington\nasked her what she was thinking about then, and she\nreplied, \" Oh, about your writing to Professor Hyslop.\"\nShe had just before settling down to go into trance\nexpressed strong annoyance at an article by Professor\n1\nThat is, go into trance.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper s Trance Phenomena. 2ti7\nHyslop which had appeared in an American journal.\nOther instances of this were noted by Mr. Piddington\nboth before and after this conversation. For instance,\nbefore settling down to the trance on February 20, 1907,\nshe told a story about Sir Oliver Lodge, and after the\ntrance spontaneously referred again to this story.\nLeaving the normal consciousness, we have to study\nthe memory connexions between trance proper and waking-\nstage. But first we may observe that the memory in\none trance of what has happened in preceding trances\nis very good\u2014much better than that of most sitters.\nThe controls are very seldom mistaken in assertions as\nto what has occurred, and when they have once connected\nthe appropriate communicators with a sitter, very seldom,\nif ever, fail to do so again. Also, there is very little\ntendency to mix up one sitter's affairs with those of\nanother, except perhaps in putting out feelers with a\nnew sitter. In one respect the memory works too well\nand seems sometimes to inhibit, as it were, corrections\nwhich the communicator, if really communicating, should\nbe able to make. For instance, in the case of one sitter\nwho had a good many sittings and got a good deal that\nwas evidential, Rector after various attempts fixed on\na name as the one by which the sitter's husband called\nher. It was not right, but Rector, having once decided\non it, stuck to it. To the end, I think, he failed to\nlearn what the name really was. Another instance is the\nrepeated calling of a family friend of the Junots \"Judge\"\ninstead of \"Major,\" by Rector writing for Bennie Junot\n(see Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., pp. 443-470). Miss Verrall\nattributes this to uncontrolled association of ideas, also\nnoted by Hodgson in his second report. She says (Vol.\nXXIV., p. 352) :\nOne clearly marked characteristic is the large part played\nin the trance utterances by the association of ideas. Dr.\nHodgson has referred to this characteristic in his Report\non Mrs. Piper (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 333),1\nand\n1\nWhen Hodgson wrote, his opinion was that it was when the com-\nmunicator became exhausted and stupefied that irrelevant associations\n\f268 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PAET\nfrequent traces of it are to be found in the sittings now\nunder consideration {i.e. the Junot sittings}. If a group\nof names has been once associated together, an allusion\nto any one of them is very likely to produce allusions to\nthe others. The human mind in its normal condition is\nlargely influenced by such associations, but their force is\ncontrolled by conscious and deliberate choice. In the case\nof Mrs. Piper's mind, during trance, this control is appar-\nently lacking, so that associations once formed will often\nrecur without regard to their immediate relevance. This\ncharacteristic will also explain the tendency to repeat a\nmistake once made. For instance, the confusion between\n\"Judge\" and \"Major\" persists through the sittings, in\nspite of the fact that some part of the medium's mind\nis apparently aware of it.\nThat there is some continuity of memory between\nwaking-stage and waking-stage is sufficiently shown by\nthe evidence adduced in Chapter VI., pp. 255-257, though\nthe instability and incoherence of the waking-stage make\nthe continuity less obvious than it is between trance and\ntrance, and^also probably make it less complete.\nWe now come to the more important question of\nmemory between trance and waking-stage. I gave in\nChapter VI. evidence of continuity of some kind between\nthe two\u2014the same persons, the same topics, and some-\ntimes almost verbally the same sentences appearing in\nboth. But I have deferred till now the consideration\nof cases where the trance-consciousness shows awareness\nof what has passed in a previous waking-stage, or where\nthings come . out in the waking-stage in accordance with\nwhat has been promised in the trance.\nThe first cases of the kind occurred before the waking-\nstage was fully developed, and the first I know of con-\nsisted in a name that had been asked for in the trance\nbeing called out just as the trance came to an end.\nDr. C. W. F. reports on May 17, 1889 (Proceedings,\nVol. VIII., p. 99) :\nof ideas took effect. But this is certainly not the case with the two\npersistent mistakes as to names referred to in the text.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 269\nAt my first seance {January, 1889} Dr. P{hinuit} said :\n\" Your friend William is here, and * * * is determined\nto give you his whole name before I go out.\" As Mrs. P.\nbegan to come out of the trance, \" Pabodie \" was spoken\nwith great force, and Mrs. P. gave a start, saying,\n\" Somebody spoke right in my ear.\" I thought she\nseemed to think I had done so. At my third seance\nDr. P. said spontaneously, \" William Pabodie sends his\nlove to you * * * \"\nA similar incident reported by Hodgson in Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., pp. 305-8, occurred on April 28, 1892, and\nhas already been partly quoted in Chapter VI., p. 212,\nin connexion with the development of waking-stages.\nThe sitter, Mr. Peirce, whose name is believed to have\nbeen unknown to Mrs. Piper, was apparently recognised\nby G. P. during the sitting, but a difficulty was made\nabout giving his name. When Mrs. Piper was coming\nout of trance, among unintelligible sounds \" the name\nPeirce was alone distinct. This name was spoken twice,\nand was not in either Phinuit's or Mrs. Piper's ordinary\nvoice.\"\nAt the next sitting on the following day, G. P. (writing)\nexplained :\nG. P. I could not speak to Dr. [Phinuit] to make him under-\nstand what I wanted him to say, so I tried to tell\nthe medium just as she was coming into her body\nagain, and I hope she told you the test you asked\nfor. Please answer me, did she tell you ?\nR. H. Yes, she gave us the name.\nG. P. That is all you asked me for. I will now explain.\nI had so many things in my mind about . . .\nand other things which you had asked me to do\nfor you. The fact is I really had no time or\nstrength to tell you anything about anybody else.\nAnd again later in the same sitting apparently :\nG. P. Do tell Peirce how I tried to tell the medium, but I\ndon't know you got, whether you got it or no.\nR. H. Yes, we got it.\n\f270 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nG. P. Good. You see I saw her spirit just as she was going\nin and as I could not tell Dr. I took the\nchance.\nThe claim of the controls in these cases that they\nare responsible for the message given through the returning\nspirit of the medium is clear. An exposition of this plan\nof communing with her soul, as G. P. calls it, given by\nhim on November 30, 1892, will be found in the\nAppendix, p. 616. Also Phinuit's views on the subject\nexpressed on December 7, 1896, will be found in the\nAppendix, p. 617.\nA similar case, where not only a name but a message\nwas given, as Mrs. Piper came out of trance, is described\nby Hodgson in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 372. He\n\" understood, as it was described later, that * * * G. P.\ngave it to the '\nreturning consciousness '\nof Mrs. Piper.\"\nThese cases before the full development of the waking-\nstage are clearly of the same nature as the later ones\nwhen the dividing line between trance proper and waking-\nstage had become more marked, and the waking-stage\nlonger and more important. The utterance of the name\nPeirce, and G. P.'s subsequent claim that he had given\nit to the medium as she was returning to her body is,\nfor instance, very like a case described in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIV., pp. 556-557, when a name which had been asked\nfor\u2014Miriam\u2014was uttered in the waking-stage of February\n25, 1903, and Bennie Junot claimed at the next sitting at\nwhich he communicated to have given it \"to a spirit\nreturning to its body.\"\nA rather interesting case of the same kind occurred in\n1900, the sitter being Professor Hyslop, and Hodgson\nrecorder. It was interesting because the success was\nincomplete though sufficient, I think, to make it certain\nthat an attempt was made. On February 5, 1900,1\na\nname had been asked for but not given.

On May 24, 1904, at the end of the voice\nsitting recorded by Miss A. M. R. from which I have\nalready several times quoted, her brother-in-law com-\nmunicated 1\nthrough Rector, giving his relationship, but\nwhen asked for his name saying :\n1\nIt is worth noting that Miss A. M. R. reports that this brother-in\nlaw, recently dead, who had never seen Mrs. Piper, but to whom Miss\nA. M.

[part\nI will tell you before I go, I will whisper it to the light\nas I see it return.\nIn the waking-stage which followed shortly, Mrs. Piper\nimmediately after the first snap of her head said :\nOh did you hear my head snap ?

We shall refer to him later as he hath tried many\ntimes to appear to the spirit of the light while\nreturning to the earthly body. * * * dost thou\nknow whether he hath succeeded in showing him-\nself.\n(January 20, 1904.)\nR. H. I looked through all my notes of the words of the\nlight while returning during this season, but can\nfind nothing to indicate that she saw Dr. Blodgett.\nRector. We are glad to know friend as it helps us to U.D.\nhow near the spirit must be to be seen.\nThese extracts about Dr. Blodgett are worth studying\nin connexion with the very important case reported by\nSir Oliver Lodge of the recognition of the photograph\nof Joseph Marble. His account of this case will be found\nin Proceedings, Vol. XXIII., pp. 276-277, but he does\nnot mention the detail\u2014unimportant from the point of\nview of his paper, but important in the present con-\nnexion\u2014that the experiment was proposed by Joseph\nMarble communicating and Rector controlling in the\ntrance proper of the day on which the recognition was\nfirst made. The relevant extract from the record is as\nfollows .\n(Dec. 3, 1906.)\nSitter and recorder, Sir Oliver Lodge. Rector writing,\nJoseph Marble communicating through him.\nJ. M. As a proof of my identity I will show my face to\nthe spirit of the light when it returns, so that it\ncan be recognised by the same spirit before it quite\nre-inhabits its body, from twenty photographs of\nmen resembling myself. U.D.\ns\n\f274 Mrs. Henry Sidgvrick. [part\nO. J. L. Yes, I understand ; he will show himself to the\nmedium before she has completely recovered con-\nsciousness, in the expectation that she will after-\nwards have sufficient recollection of his appearance\nto pick out a photograph of him from among\nothers.\nRector. Yes, we did this for our friend Hodgson occasionally\nwhen he was in the body\nIn regard to this statement of Rector's T know of no\ninstance of selection of photographs before this date\nexcept those discussed in Chapter VI., namely, the G. P.\ncase (p. 213), and the case of June 11 and 12, 1900, which\nis quoted in the Appendix to that chapter (pp. 573-575).\nThere may, of course, have been other cases of which\nwe have not got the records. In the G. P. case, which,\nby the way, occurred some years before the Imperator\nband came on tha scene, Mrs. Piper was apparently normal\nwhen she recognised the photograph. In the 1900 case the\nrecognition occurred during the waking-stage, and I think\nthat this is what Joseph Marble really proposed in the\npresent case, though Sir Oliver Lodge apparently understood\nit otherwise. Joseph Marble's proposal to appear was\nmade in the earlier half of the sitting, and a considerable\nvariety of communicators and communications followed ;\nMyers being the last person spoken of in the trance. In\nthe waking-stage, which is given in full by Sir Oliver in\nProceedings. Vol. XXIII. , p. 276, no mention of Joseph\nMarble nor reference to the proposed experiment is recorded,\nand it was perhaps for this reason that Sir Oliver did not\nimmediately pursue the experiment. It was about an hour\nand a half after the sitting, lunch having intervened, that\nhe showed Mrs. Piper eleven photographs of men, and asked\nher if she had ever seen any of them.\nShe looked over them, hesitating on the one representing\nMr. Joseph Marble for some time, and then picked that\nout and said she had seen that man somewhere, but she\ncould not remember where.\nThis must be regarded as only a partial success. A\nmuch more definite one was obtained at Sir Oliver Lodge's\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs, Piper's Trance Phenomena. 275\nnext sitting five months later, May 19, 1907, when a\nnumber of photographs were placed before her just as\nshe came out of the waking-stage {Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIII., p. 278), and she immediately pounced on one\nwithout the slightest hesitation saying :\nThat is the man I saw. I saw him. That is the man I\nsaw. I saw him up there : such a nice face. I could see\nhim. I could see Mr. Hodgson pushing him up to the front.\nShe had said in the waking-stage :\nFine looking man, his name is Joe. Mr. Hodgson keeps\npushing him in the front row. Foreground.\nWhen an hour or so later the photographs were again\nput before her, she looked at them as if for the first\ntime and said, \"I do not know the photographs.\" She\nthen hesitated long over the right one, saying she had\n\" seen him somewhere,\" but finished up by saying, \" No,\nI do not know.\"\nThe degree of recollection here seems closely to resemble\nthat after about the same interval of time on December 3,\nand I think it probable that if Sir Oliver had shown\nher the photographs on the first occasion as immediately\nafter her normal consciousness returned as he did on the\nsecond, the recognition would have been equally vivid.\nWould this imply that she had the promised vision in\nthe waking-stage of December 3, although she did not\nmention it ? We cannot tell. There is no reason to\nassume that she describes out loud all she sees in the\nwaking-stage, and, in fact, indications of the contrary\nmay be found in the waking-stage records. See, for\ninstance, the locket case above, comparing pp. 250 and 253.\nThe question is not unimportant, because if she really\nhad no impression of Joseph Marble in the waking-stage,\nthe degree of recognition of his photograph which she\nexhibited must have been j:due to some recollection by\nthe normal consciousness of the trance 7\nproper, though only\nan^ evanescent recollection, as by the evening of the next\ndayJfit had entirely disappeared. Sir Oliver Lodge says\n(Vol. XXIIL, p. 277) :\n\f276 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nNext day, in the evening, I tested Mrs. Piper again\nwith another set of photographs of men, partly the same\nand partly different, but containing among them the critical\none. This time, however, it was looked at without com-\nment and without interest, and no remembrance of the\nappearance seemed to persist. She remembered the fact\nof having recognised one before ;\n1\nbut when asked to do\nit again, she picked out, after much hesitation, a different\none as a possibility, and said that she thought it had\nbeen found in America, that the memory evaporated in\ntime, and that it was strongest within an hour of the\nsitting.\nSir Oliver Lodge's experiment with the locket, and its\ncontext, described in Chapter VI., pp. 250-255, should be\nstudied in connexion with this question of vanishing\nmemory, and, indeed, from one point of view, the whole\nof the latter part of Chapter VI., pp. 240 to the end, belongs\nto our present subject.\nUnder the influence of the cross-correspondence experi-\nments in the English sittings of 1906-7 and Mr. Dorr's\nsittings of 1908, both the expression in the trance of\nintention to communicate through the waking-stage, and\nthe recognition in the trance that such communications\nhad been attempted in a preceding waking-stage, became\nmore frequent than they had been before. This was,\ndoubtless, at least pai'tly due to the recognition of the\nimportance of the waking-stage by those in charge of the\nsittings, and to their consequently encouraging it more\nthan Hodgson ever did.\nTwo instances in 1907 will be found in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXII. On February 26, in the waking-stage which is\nquoted in full (Vol. XXII., pp. 94-96), Mrs. Piper spoke\nabout laurel wreaths, and indicated apparently that G. P.\nhad said he would tell \" her \" (presumably Mrs. Verrall)\nabout laurel wreaths. On the next day, during the trance\n(Vol. XXII., p. 96), MyerSp communicating, said :\nMyebsp\n. I gave Mrs. Verrall Laurel wreath.\n1\nThis recollection adds to the certainty that she was in possession of\nher normal consciousness when making the recognition.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 277\nJ. G. P. Yes, quite right ; she got it.\n* * * *\nMyebsp . Yes I gave her that and as the spirit of the light\nreturned to its body I tried to grasp it * * *\ngrasp the spirit, so as to give it you last time.\nJ. G. P. Yes I heard it quite well ; laurel wreath.\nOn March 6\u2014in the waking-stage\u2014also given in full\nin Vol. XXII., pp. 150-152, Mrs. Piper quoted \" moaning\nat the bar when I put out to sea,\" and also spoke of\nArthur Hallam. On March 13, the next sitting at which\nMr. Piddington was alone, MyersP said a propos of the\nquotation from Crossing the Bar having appeared in\nMrs. Verrall's script :\nMyeesp\n. I did quote those lines to her. I also quoted them\nto this light * * * while Hodgson held it for me.\nAnd later in the sitting he said about the name Arthur\nHallam, \" I gave it to the spirit of this light while it was\nreturning.\"\nIn the sittings of 1908 the waking-stage was still further\ndeveloped under the influence of Mr. Dorr, who, having\nbeen told about the evidential value of some waking-stage\ncommunications in the English sittings of 1907, laid great\nstress on waking-stages. He began to do this on March 23\n1908, when he urged HodgsonP , who was communicating,\nto give him all they could \" through the subliminal.\" The\nhand bowed assent and wrote, \" We gave Laurel Wreath\nthrough the subliminal when we could not do so through the\nhand,\" referring, no doubt, to the incident of February 26,\n1907, just described. At this same sitting of March 23,\n1908, Mr. Dorr asked MyersP what the word Lethe sug\ngested to him, and obtained important elements of the\nanswer in the waking-stage as well as some in the trance\nproper. Full particulars and copious extracts are given\nin Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., pp. 86-95, but what concerns\nour present subject is that MyersP made statements on\nMarch 24 in the trance proper as to what had occurred\nin the waking-stage of March 23. Mrs. Piper in the waking-\nstage had seen a vision of a lady with a bow and arrows.\n\f278 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nwhich she described with some detail (see Proceedings. Vol.\nXXIV., p. 89). To this HodgsonP refers without any\nprompting on March 24, saying, \" he {i.e. Myers} drew\nthe form\u2014a picture 1\nof Iris with an arrow\n'\n' ; and later\nin the sitting it is again mentioned, apparently by MyersP :\nMyebsp\n. Did the light quote Picture 1\nI made for her spirit as\nit returned ?\nG. B. D. The picture of Iris ?\nMyebsp\n. Yes.\nG. B. D. Yes, she did. But I thought it was Diana. She\ntold me about it very clearly.\n* * * *\nMyersp or Hodgsonp\n.\n* * * I was given the lines by Pidding-\nton which I gave to the light's spirit to make you\nunderstand my meaning of Iris.\nThe lines which had been repeated in the waking-stage\nwere an incorrect version of the first two lines of Long-\nfellow's weU-known song beginning \" I shot an arrow into\nthe air.\" Mr. Piddington had quoted the first line of this\nto HodgsonP on February 25, 1907.2\nThat the trance\npersonalities on March 24th knew something about the waking-\nstage on the 23rd is here clear. And it is also clear as\nregards \" Sybil \" in the same waking-stage. MyersP says\non March 24 :\nI told the Light to say sybil last time.\nG. B. D. Yes, the Light did say Sybil in the subhminal.\nImportant and interesting references in the trance writing\nto preceding waking-stages occur in many of these sittings\nof Mr. Dorr's, but it was not his object to trace the relations\nbetween trance and waking-stage consciousnesses, and his\n1\nWhat Mrs. Piper described was not a picture but an apparently solid\nfigure in the air pointing an arrow at her. Probably \" picture \" should\nnot, however, be taken too literally.\n2 This was the day before the mention of laurel wreath in the waking-\nstage \u2014an approximation of dates which suggests that association of\nideas may have led to the quotation of this line in the waking-stage\nof the sitting at which the laurel wreath incident had been again\nreferred to.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 279\nhabit after March 24 of reading to the trance personalities\nthe record of previous waking-stages\u2014unobjectionable from\nhis point of view and in some respects enlightening\u2014is apt\nto invalidate the evidence for the independent memory of\nthe facts by the trance personalities. 1\nThis is all the more\nthe case, because while claiming knowledge of what was\nattempted in the waking-stage, they generally profess not\nto know how far the attempts succeeded.\nOf memory the other way\u2014memory in the waking-stage\nof the trance, or, at least, of promises made in the trance\nbeing carried out in the waking-stage\u2014there are several\ninstances. Thus on March 31, 1908, Mr. Dorr,\u2014after reading\nsome lines from the invocation to Zeus in the Agamemnon\ntranslated, as he told MyersP ,\nby his brother, Mr. Ernest\nMyers,\u2014said\nNow I want you to try whether you cannot give me\nlater, in the subliminal perhaps, the name of the old\nGreek play from which these lines are translated * * *\n[Hand bows assent.]\nThe waking-stage shortly followed, and the first audible\nword was \" Agamemnon.\"\nOn April 13, in the waking-stage, which is quoted in\nfull in the Appendix to Chapter VI. (p. 605), four\nquestions which had been asked in the preceding trance\nproper are more or less answered, and in the case of\nthree of them MyersP had undertaken to try to give the\nanswers in the waking-stage. These three questions are\ngiven on pp. 607-608.\nThere is an interesting case on April 6 and 7, 1908, where\nthe promise is made to attempt a communication in the\nwaking-stage. The attempt partly succeeded and was com-\npleted in the trance next day. Mr. Dorr had on March 23\nasked the communicators for a translation of a certain\nGreek line. It is quoted (and translated) in Fragments of\nProse and Poetry, p. 48. The English is \" striving to save\nmy own soul, and my comrades' homeward way.\" The\n1\nAn earlier case, on January 14, 1897, in which the evidence for\nindependent memory was invalidated in the same way, will be found\nin the Appendix, p. 618\n\f280 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PART\nfirst half had been more or less successfully given, and\non April 6 Mr. Dorr asked MyersP if he could not give\nthe rest.\nG B. D. Now try whether you cannot get the rest of that\nliue through to me. kcu vottov eTu'ipwv\nMyebsp\n, I am not sure that I can get it through to you\nclearly but perhaps a few words will do. I'll try\nto give it through the sub. will try it as the spirit\nleaves.\nAccordingly in the waking-stage is said :\nOn the homeward way \u2014striving to save my soul and on\nthe homeward way.\nOn April 7, immediately after the first greetings, comes :\nMyeesp\n. Comrades' homeward way.\n{after some discussion by G. B. D. \" of how much\nis lost in the subhminal \" and the reasons for it}\nMyebsp . We are trying our best to make her understand\nto-day, and we feel if we do not remain too long\nin the hand we may be able to do better in the\nhead. Let us try.\nG. B. D. I am greatly pleased at getting what you have just\nwritten,\n1\nComrades' homeward way.' This gives me\nnow the rendering of that whole fine.\nMYEBSp. I gave it in the subhminal again and again last time.\nThat is why it comes out now.\nThese two statements by MyersP are, I think, of consider-\nable importance in the light they throw on his conception\nof the relation of the consciousness of the trance proper\nwith that of the waking-stage. The first statement almost\nidentifies them, for the expressions \" in the head \" and\n\" in the hand \" are habitually used of the method of control\nhi voice sittings and writing sittings respectively ; so that\nthe implication is that MyersP is thinking of himself as\nusing the medium's vocal organs in the waking-stage in the\nsame direct way that it is asserted the control does in a\nvoice sitting. Of course, the statement may have been an\naccidental slip ; but a slip of this kind would indicate a\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 281\nwant of stability in MyersP 's view as to the process of\ncommunication.\nThe second statement, implying that efforts to get a\nthing said in the waking-stage lead to its coming out\nin the trance, is again an unexpected admission in view\nof the theories put forward by the trance personalities.\nIt is more easy to reconcile with the view that in both\nstates the mind directly expressing itself in speech or\nwriting is Mrs. Piper's, in more or less successful telepathic\nrelation with other spirits, than that it is in one case\nMrs. Piper's and in the other an alien spirit using her\norganism directly.\nThat these reflexions are not irrelevant to our present\nsubject we see at once when, granting that there, is\nevidence of some memory connexion between what is\nsaid in trance and in waking-stage, we ask whose memory\nit is. There is nothing in most of the instances given\nto show whether it is Mrs. Piper's or that of another\nspirit\u2014say, Myers or Hodgson. On the theory that the\ncontrols in the trance are independent of Mrs. Piper's\nspirit, and say what they have to say without its inter-\nvention, the memory exhibited is that of the controls or\ncommunicators. They remember what they said or wrote\nin the trance and what they tried to say to Mrs. Piper's\nspirit in the waking-stage. On the theory that the\ncontrols are always Mrs. Piper playing a part, though at\ntimes inspired by real communicators, it may still be\nthe communicators who remember what they said through\nMrs. Piper in each state ; but it is equally tenable that\nit is some part of Mrs. Piper which remembers. When\nthere is evidence of supernormal knowledge, she may\nremember in one state knowledge telepathically received\nin another, just as she may remember from one state\nto the other knowledge otherwise acquired. This would\ngive us a natural interpretation of the sentence, \" I gave\nit in the subliminal again and again last time, that is\nwhy it comes out now.\"\nThe same ambiguity as to whether it is Mrs. Piper's\nmind operating throughout or that of the controls doing\nso, manifests itself in another kind of case\u2014the case of\n\f282 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [part\nsuggestion in the trance proper affecting the waking-\nstage. Hodgson, and other sitters also, when desirous of\nshortening the waking-stage, not infrequently asked the\ncontrols, before the trance ended, to send back the spirit\nof the light quickly ; and the suggestion certainly some-\ntimes took effect. In Hodgson's view this was because the\ncontrol was an independent spirit concerned with managing\nthe return of Mrs. Piper's spirit and willing to oblige\nHodgson. But it may equally well have been suggestion\nof the ordinary kind affecting Mrs. Piper herself directly.\nBefore trying to decide between these rival hypotheses,\nthere are other things to be considered in connexion\nwith the waking-stage intelligence. In all the cases so\nfar discussed of professed communication outside the\ntrance proper, it is the returning spirit of the medium\nwhich is said to be the channel of communication. But\nthere is another plan, namely, that the communicator\nshould catch the control as the latter leaves the medium\nand make clear to him what the desired word or name,\nwhich he has failed to give, are, so that he may be\nbetter able to write it next time. This was a plan which\nMyergp professed to use several times in April and May,\n1907.\nBut before describing these cases we may observe that\nthis plan, like that of communicating through the returning\nspirit of the medium;\nseems to be foreshadowed in two\ninstances, mentioned by Hodgson, before the full develop-\nment of waking-stages. In both a final effort, as the\nsitting ended, to give a name that had been asked for\nwas made through the control and not through the\nspirit of the medium.\" The first was the Mannors case,\nMay 17, 1892, of which particulars are given in\nProceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 471-2, and also p. 310.\nHodgson says :\nThe writing ended * * * Suddenly Phinuit called out\n\"Who's M-AN-N-O-R-S. I got that for H-O-D-G-S-O-N.\nTell Hodgson I gave this to you as I could not stay there\nlonger on account of Elisa.\" This was G. P.'s message\napparently through Phinuit. \" Mannors \" was the surname\nof Madame Elisa.\n\fLxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 283\nThe second case was M. Paul Bourget's on December 11,\n1893 (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 310). Hodgson writes:\nAfter the writing apparently was finished and the hand\ndropped, it was seized again suddenly and violently, and\nwrote a name beginning with A, but the other letters\nwere indecipherable. This was followed by the name\nVenice.\nThese, Hodgson understood, were, as far as they went,\nanswers to test questions put by M. Bourget to the\nchief communicator at his sitting.\nHodgson says {op. cit., p. 311) about such final efforts :\nThe explanation offered is that the communicator's mind,\nwhen the act of communicating is broken, regains the\nbalance which it lost while communicating, realises more\nfully the questions that were put, and recalls more clearly\nthe answers. The swift resumption of communication while\nthe answers are \" on the mind,\" and before other thoughts\ncan intervene, is likely to result favourably.\nThis explanation will not as it stands apply to the\nmore or less analogous cases of 1907, but so far as it\nimplies a moment of special lucidity as the trance proper\ncomes to an end, I think there is something in it.\nThe case in 1907 of speaking to Rector as he left\nthe light, about which most was said, occurred on April 17\nand it was also, I think, the first case of the kind. The\nrelevant passages from the records will be found in\nProceedings, Vol. XXII., pp. 369-373 and 305.\nThe investigators were at that time trying to get\nMyersp, who seemed to have referred to Browning's\nAbt Vogler, to give the name of the poem from which\nhis words came ; and I, being in charge of the sitting\non that day, asked him whether he professed to have\ngiven it. He replied through Rector as amanuensis, \" No,\nI have not been able to get it through, but I hope to\ndo so.\" At the very end of the trance he made another\nreference to the subject as follows :\nMyersp . Mrs. S. I shall see you again and as soon as Rector\nleaves the fight I will catch him and spell out letter\n\f284 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nby letter the poem to him. and give it to you at\nonce when I see you again. I'll wait for him to-day\nM.\nE. M. S. I shall see you on the third after coming {i.e.\ntranslated from trance language, April 24} alone.\nMYEBSp. I'll surely give it then if not before.\nIn the waking-stage of the same day, which quickly\nfollowed, Mrs. Piper said :\n\" Mr. Myers has got Rector\nby the ear, whispers into it.\" Note this apparent know-\nledge by the waking-stage consciousness of what is going\non. At the next sitting (April 22) I was not present,\nand nothing concerning the matter occurred except that\nin the waking-stage Mrs. Piper gave as a message from\nMyers :\n\" Mr. Myers says I must keep my promise \" ;\nwith words indicating that the promise referred to was\nthe promise to give the name of the poem. On April 24,\nsome time after the beginning of the sitting, a clear\nand nearly successful attempt to keep the promise was\nmade through Rector. After getting as near as \"A B\nVolugevar,\" Rector remarks :\nI can't quite repeat the last two letters, but he caught\nme after I left the light and told me what it was. R.\nAfter some further talk in the course of which MyersP\nsays, \" I gave Rector one more letter. How do you\npronounce ABt \" ; and after Rector has got \" Abt \" and\nI have finished \" Vogler \" for him, he says :\nRector.

However, in the waking-stage Mrs. Piper said,\n\" What do they say to me. Got Rector by the ear \"\n\u2014\nthe same expression she used on April 17. At the next\nsitting, May 6 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 170),\nMyerSp gives as his answer \" Plotinus,\" and says, \" I\ncaught Rector at our last meeting and spelled it out to\nhim clearly.\"\nVery shortly after this at the same sitting, May 6,\n1907, MyerSp was asked for a particular line in Abt\n1\nMr. Piddington gives reasons for thinking that there was an attempt\nto answer the question about the Greek words on the real next time,\nApril 29, but that owing to confusion Myers,, was headed off from it\n(see Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 161). For further extracts from the\nBitting on April 30, see Proceedings, Vol. XXII., pp. 165, 168.\n\f286 Mrs. Henry SidgivicJc.

Perhaps\nthis is because MyersP and HodgsonP seem in those\nsittings to have written themselves, without the inter-\nvention of Rector as amanuensis, so that if the greater\nfacility of getting through what was wanted, which\napparently exists at the moment of transition from trance,\nwas to be made dramatic use of at all, it could only be\nthrough the waking-stage communication.\nIt is to be observed that whether this telling things\nto Rector as he comes out is or is not, in fact, the same\nprocess as telling them to the waking-stage consciousness,\nat any rate the dramatic distinction is consistent^ main-\ntained. The things professedly said to Rector do not\ncome out till Rector controls again, and the things pro-\nfessedly said to the \" spirit of the light \" generally come\nout at once in the waking-stage. The two things seem,\nhowever, to be bound together by MyersP's remark on\nApril 7, 1908 (see above, p. 280). And further it must\nbe admitted that, considering how many words\u2014let alone\n1\nFor further extracts from the sittings in question, see Proceedings,\nVol. XXII., pp. 382-92.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 287\nletters\u2014Rector apparently successfully grasps and trans-\nmits while writing, it is difficult to imagine why a process\nof literally spelling a name to Rector \" letter by letter\n\"\nshould be easier behind the scenes than during the trance\nscript ; and this difficulty necessarily inspires some doubt\nwhether the process is accurately described. But if it is not\naccurately described, what becomes of Mrs. Piper's seeing\nMyers taking Rector by the ear and whispering to him ? Is\nthis a recollection in the waking-stage of what has been\npromised in the trance ?\nI think the giving questions to the communicator at\none sitting to think over for communication at the next\n\u2014\na course recommended by the trance personalities\u2014 is very\nlikely also connected with special lucidity at the moment\nof transition. It is, perhaps, significant that G. P. recom-\nmends it (April 29, 1892) in the midst of explaining the\nutterance of the word Peirce. He says :\nThe better way for you ... to get things from me is\nto ask me to look up things for you and then let me\ntell them to you quite clearly (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\np. 308)\nThe following instance is of some interest, though\nnothing came of it, because it is Rector who undertakes\nto see that the communicator gives a name (through him,\nof course) instead of the communicator trying to teach\nRector to do so, as in the cases we have been considering.\nIt was on March 2, 1903 ; those present were two sitters,\nwith Hodgson recording. Rector says towards the end\nof the sitting :\nR. Better give him {the communicator} some things to\nthink over\nR. H. Will he tell us something about this knife, for one\nthing.\nR. Yes. {And a little later}\nR. H. She asks if he can tell her first name.\nR. I'll see that he calls it on his return. Rector.\nNeither the name nor facts about the knife seem to\nhave been produced at the sitting next day\u2014and, of\n\f288 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\ncourse, the professed advantage of thinking over things\nmay have been, on this and other occasions, a mere\ndevice for postponing admission of complete ignorance.\nOn the other hand, it is quite possible that a genuine\ncommunicator might find it advantageous to have an\ninterval for thinking over answers to questions and for\nreviving memories\u2014and even to a false communicator,\na mere personation by a phase of Mrs. Piper, an oppor-\ntunity for reflexion and putting two and two together\nmight be useful. I am inclined to think, however, that\nwhen the plan succeeds it is probably generally due to\na moment of special lucidity at the transition out of or\ninto the trance state\u2014a moment in which the trance\nintelligence succeeds in grasping ideas transmitted tele-\npathically, either from the sitter or the communicator,\nto which it has previously been impervious. It is possible\nthat greater lucidity at the transition moment may be\ndue to the trance personality being then relieved from\nthe effort of acting parts. What portion of the waking-\nstage should be regarded as included in such a transition\nmoment it is, of course, difficult to say.\nActivity between sittings is sometimes alleged to take\nthe form of the control conversing with the communicator\nto get information from him. The following is a successful\nexample of this plan in which some of the things said\nsuggest that the transmission really occurs at the time\nof ending the trance. On January 17, 1905, at a sitting\nat which Hodgson was recorder and a lady sitter present,\nthe sitter asked the communicator \"John\" for a certain\nname, and on its being only partially given\u2014Edgerley\nfor Edgerton\u2014Hodgson said to Rector :\nR. H. It would probably be better for him to give that\nas well as names of his other friends, to George\nbetween this meeting and next, and let George\ncome in at the beginning of next meeting and give\nall.\nR. Very good. Poor George has his hands full so to\nspeak in keeping his {presumably the communi-\ncator's} thoughts clear over this cord.\n{G. P. was apparently helping the communicator.\n\fLXXI.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 289\nA little later\u2014just at the end of the sitting\u2014when\nthe communicator takes leave there is a disturbance\nin the hand, and G. P. writes}\nG. P. Adieu H. I'll go with him and have a chat.\nThe next day, January 18, the same sitters being\npresent, Mrs. Piper in the going-into-trance stage says\n\" George,\" and, after the usual preliminary greetings by\nImperator and Rector, Rector says, \" We bring George\nthis day for a few moments.\" G. P. begins with greetings\nand breaks off a sentence to write :\nG. P. EdgERton\nSitter. Good enough, John, that is splendid, that's right.\nG. P. I got him to tell it me after we left.\n{Later in the sitting he said}\nG. P. I can do so much better with him in this way and\nhe U.D. so much better when he is not speaking.\n{and later still}\nSitter John, it is splendid that you got Edgerton's name\nthrough correctly.\nJohn. I owe this all to our good friend who helps me\nto-day and the gentleman present with you who\nmade the suggestion to George.\nSitter Can you give Edgerton's first name ?\nJohn. Yes I'll give him in the same way and he will take\nit to the light as I go out.\n{I gather, however, that he failed to do so.}\nTwo cases from Hodgson's published reports of what was\npossible lucidity at the moment of going into trance have\nbeen already quoted in Chapter VI., pp. 210, 243.\nAn incident in a sitting on November 18, 1893, is an\ninstance of lucidity at the moment of Phinuit going out,\nthough in this case the effort to communicate produced\nre-entrancement. It is described in Hodgson's Report,\nVol. XIII., p. 483. The sitter was Mr. A. A. C, who\nexpected communication from his brother Harry, owing\nto a message having been sent to him by the latter through\nG. P. some months before. Hodgson was recording. Amid\nsome confusion communications came successively which\nT\n\f290 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nwere appropriate to previous sitters, but not to Mr. A. A. C.\nThen Phinuit talked further, but the only relevant matter\nwas \" young man named Harry\u2014I want to see my\nbrother,\" and Phinuit complained of confusion. Hodgson\ncontinues :\nMrs. Piper had begun to come out of trance, but was\nstrongly convulsed again, and the hand moved to write. I\nput a pencil in it, and a very direct personal communi-\ncation was written to the sitter, who was addressed by his\nfirst name. The full name\u2014first, middle, and surname\n\u2014\nof his brother Harry, from whom the communication\npurported to come, was written several times, with great\nviolence tearing the paper of the block book. The wild\nanxiety of the communicator, as shown in the writing and\nin the movements of Mrs. Piper's hand and arm, was very\nstriking. * * * Phinuit stated on November 23 that when\nhe \" went out \" he found this young man, who begged most\nearnestly for the opportunity of speaking to his brother,\nand that he, Phinuit, had \" helped him in,\" etc.\nThe existence of a greater capacity or of more favour-\nable conditions for receiving impressions supernormally at\nthe moment of transition into or out of the trance state\nwould not in itself throw light on the question of whose\nmemory connects the trance proper with the waking-stage.\nAnd, in fact, I am disposed to think that the cases of\nconscious memory in one state or the other, of the kind\nwhich have been discussed in this chapter, can be explained\nequally well as due to the memory of some part of\nMrs. Piper, or of the controls or communicators ; and\nthe claim of the trance personages, of course, is that\nit is their memory which is concerned.\nThere are, however, a few cases which seem definitely\nto point to the memory being that of some element of\nMrs. Piper. They may be divided into two classes :\n(a) cases where there is specific reason for thinking that\nthe control professing to remember is not genuine ;\n(b)\ncases where the knowledge in the waking-stage which shows\nconnexion with the trance is claimed by the waking-\nstage consciousness as acquired by direct experience.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 291\nOf the first kind the case of January 13 and 14, 1897.\ngiven in the Appendix (pp. 617-618) is a specimen, and I\nam not sure that there are any others. In this case\n\" Hannah Wild \" controlling on January 14 repeats a\nline of a hymn which had been uttered in the waking-\nstage the day before, and on being asked by Hodgson\nwhether she had sung it \"to the medium when she was\ncoming into her body last time,\" replied that she had.\nThe evidence for conscious memory here is vitiated by\nHodgson's leading question, but it is quite possible that\nthe conscious memory existed, and in any case the repeti-\ntion of the same line is conclusive evidence of some\nkind of continuity. Now \" Hannah Wild \" was, it will be\nremembered, an old communicator, and the attempts\nmade to obtain evidence of her identity, as described\nby Hodgson in his first Report,1\nwere extremely interesting\nand afforded important evidence of the supernormal acquisi-\ntion of knowledge. But, as Hodgson says,2\nthe evidence\n\" seems to be very far from proving the presence of Hannah\nWild \" ; and I should go further and apply to the whole\nseries of sittings what he says at an early stage of it, viz.\nthat the result \" suggested that however Phinuit succeeded\nin obtaining the names and other impressions which proved\nto be more or less correct, he at least did not g;et them\nfrom the '\nspirit '\nof Hannah Wild.\" Later appearances of\n\" Hannah Wild \"\u2014the one we are dealing with among them\n\u2014did not make it more probable that the real Hannah\nWild was concerned.\nBut if it was not Hannah Wild herself who claimed on\nJanuary 14 to remember singing that hymn to the returning\nspirit of Mrs. Piper the day before, who was it ? It must\nhave been either some phase or element of Mrs. Piper\nherself, who somehow in both states associated the hymn\nwith Hannah Wild, or it must have been a personating\nspirit.\nThe argument hi a case of this sort is briefly that\nthe fictitiousness of the trance personage implies that\n1\nProceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 10-16 and 69-84; see also Professor\nW. James on the subject, Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 657.\n2\nOp. cit., p. 15.\n\f292 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ncommunication by it with Mrs. Piper in the waking-\nstage is fictitious also. In the second class of case the\nargument is in a sense reversed. It is that as Mrs. Piper\nin the waking-stage claims immediate knowledge of facts\nor ideas common to the two states, it is probably some\nphase or element of her mind that has the knowledge in\nboth states. Examples of this class have been given in\nChapter VI. The claim of Mrs. Piper's waking-stage\nconsciousness to have visited England and Mexico in\nspirit are cases in point (see Chapter VI., pp. 247-248,\nand Appendix, pp. 551, 552). The case of her seeing\nProfessor Newbold while going into trance, and G. P.\nprofessing to have done so as soon as the trance began\n(p. 243), again seems to be of the same kind. And\nthe case described on p. 248, and Appendix (p. 591),\nof Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage seeing Phinuit, for the\nfirst time for years, on the day when the trance com-\nmunicator had spoken of meeting him in the other world,\nis, I think, analogous\u2014the idea of Phinuit in the trance\nhaving probably suggested the vision to the waking-stage\nMrs. Piper.\nThese cases are not numerous, but they are, I think,\nsufficient to show that the interdependence of trance\nand waking-stage ideas is sometimes at least due to\nMrs. Piper's mind operating in both states and carrying\nideas from one to the other. This implies some under-\nlying memory connexion, though not necessarily a conscious\nmemory in either state of the other. That it is not\nalways a conscious memory is shown by such indications\nas, e.g. Mrs. Piper's surprise at seeing Phinuit \" away\nup there \" in the case just mentioned, and by the frag-\nmentariness and dreamy futility which sometimes char-\nacterises the waking-stage expression of the idea carried\nover. Myersp\u2014to take him as an example of communi-\ncators\u2014when claiming that it is he who is responsible\nfor the connexion of ideas between the two states, gets\nover the difficulty of the fragmentariness by professing\nignorance of what exactly he has got Mrs. Piper to\nunderstand or to utter in the waking-stage (see e.g. p. 278).\nThis is quite possibly true ;\n\u2014indeed, if a real Myers is\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 293\ncommunicating, he may well be attempting to do so\nthrough Mrs. Piper in both states and not know how far\nhe is succeeding in either. But I think it is clear that\nin some cases there is connexion of ideas between the\ntwo states without a MyersP to carry them over.\n\f294 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nCHAPTER VIII.\nEffect of Sitters and of so-called \" Influences \" on\nthe Trance Phenomena.\nIt is impossible to study the voluminous records of Mrs.\nPiper's trances without perceiving that the nature and\nquality of the communications vary very much. The\nextracts already given in this paper show this, and it\nbecomes still more manifest if those given in previous\nreports are taken into account. They vary, of course, with\nthe controls, as we saw in Chapter III. ; but they vary\nalso with the sitters ; and they vary in style and manner\nas well as in evidential and other qualities.\nThat the sitters must influence the trance communica-\ntions to some extent is, of course, obvious. For one thing,\nthey are themselves personages in the drama, and the part\nthey play in it and the way they play it must affect\nthe way the trance personalities play theirs. This happens\nin ordinary conversation. We all of us inevitably talk to\ndifferent acquaintances differently and on more or less\ndifferent topics, and the complaisance of the controls,\ntheir desire to please, would tend to develop this tendency\nstrongly. And in the trance drama the sitters not only\nlargely determine the subjects of conversation, but the\npersonages who shall take part in it. They explicitly or\ntacitly demand that their own friends shall manifest\nthemselves and produce evidence of identity, or give\ninformation on particular points. Then again, besides\nplaying a part in the drama and influencing the selection\nof the other characters, the sitters are the audience. It\nis all played for them, and their presence and participation\nvery likely help to prevent dreamlike wanderings, such\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 295\nas occur in the waking-stage when, generally speaking, no\naudience is assumed to be present ; or incoherences, such\nas are liable to occur in automatic writing done in solitude,\nwhen the automatist exercises no deliberate influence on\nwhat is written.\nIt is clear also that the controls at times deliberately\nadapted their remarks to sitters with more regard to\nexpediency than truth. I give an extract in the Appendix\n(p. 619) from the record of a sitting on November 23,\n1899 from which it appears that assurances of an opposite\nnat re had been given to two sitters. I suspect that in\n{ ! is particular case Rector was advising somewhat morbid\npeople, and that in trying to smooth over difficulties in a\ncomplicated situation consistency was sacrificed. This is\nconjecture, but there is no doubt that Rector did sometimes\nact with a good deal of success as adviser and helper in\ncases of mental trouble and difficulty.\nIn cases such as that just referred to, what the control\nsays is influenced by what he learns about the sitter by\nmeans of normal tact and observation. But there are other\ndifferences in the sitters which have to be considered.\nThe controls speak of some sitters as giving them light\n\u2014\nmeaning that with them communication goes easily. 1\nBut\nwhat qualities in the sitter produce this result is not clear.\nProbably anything that puts the controls at their ease does\nso, and they have very likely not analysed further. It is\nsometimes alleged that mediumistic power in the sitter works\nthis way ;\ne.g. on February 22, 1900, Rector says :\n\" Mrs.\nX is a light and gives us light always, therefore she cannot\nbut help the light under such conditions as she brings.\"\nAnd again on January 1, 1907, \" B. has some light herself,\nwhich is a help to us.\" But the opposite is also asserted,\nfor we learn from Miss A. M. R. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\np. 113) that Phinuit stated that a certain sitter \"was very\nmediumistic herself, and weakened him when talking with\nher.\" However this may be, it seems certain that some-\nthing in the sitters affects the evidential value of the com-\nmunications. As I said in my previous paper on Mrs. Piper\n(Proceedings, Vol. XV., pp. 35, 36) :\n1\nSee above, Chapter IV., pp 152-154.\n\f296 Mrs. Henry Sidgtvick. [part\nDifferences in the veridicality of the communications are\nevidently at least partly due [to] the sitter. The success\nof sitters in obtaining interesting communications varies, as\nwe know, enormously, and there are persons who sit\nwith Mrs. Piper\u2014have even sat often with Mrs. Piper\n\u2014\nwho though they receive plenty of communications, receive\nnone which there is the slightest reason to suppose\nsupernormal at all. It is, I think, the case that the\nsitters who obtain most evidence of supernormal communica-\ntion of some kind are those whose sittings afford evidence\nof supernormal communication of all kinds, both of thought-\ntransference from the sitter and of communication with the\ndead or with distant living minds. If it were only a question\nof information derived by Mrs. Piper telepathically from\nthe sitter, it would be easy to attribute the failure of an\nunsuccessful sitter to his being a bad agent ; but a good\nsitter seems in some way to make the process of trans-\nmission easier, even when he does not seem to be the\nsource of the information.\nHodgson (see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 371) recognised\nthis difference, but was inclined to attribute it merely to\nwant of tact and sympathy in the sitter, or to what we may\nperhaps call want of will to be communicated with. But\nthough defects of this kind in a sitter doubtless have some\neffect, they will not, I am sure, account adequately for\nmuch of the failure, any more than such differences of\nmental attitude will account in thought-transference experi-\nments for the complete failure of some agents in com-\nmunicating ideas to percipients with whom other agents\nsucceed. There must be a quality of mind or brain, not a\nmere mental or emotional attitude, which makes a person\na good telepathic agent, and it is highly probable, I think,\nthat the quality making for good agency also makes for\ngood percipiency and vice versa, some kind of attunement\nbetween the two incarnate minds concerned being also per-\nhaps needed. I suggested in my previous paper that this\npsychical quality, whatever it may consist in, may cause\nthe sitter possessing it to serve, not only as a telepathic\nsource of information to the controls, but as a possible\ntelepathic channel of communication between his com-\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance. Phenomena. 297\nmunicating friends in the other world and the controls.\nIf this last point could be established it would certainly help\nto remove some of the difficulties connected with supposed\nveridical communications through Mrs. Piper\u2014at any rate\nthe difficulty of accounting for the selection of communi-\ncators. But it does not specially concern our present\nsubject and I do not propose to say more about it now.\nI discussed it somewhat more fully in the paper referred\nto. The other point, the sitter as a telepathic source of\ninformation, requires further consideration here, because on\nthis the controls at various times expressed views, though\nnot always quite consistent ones.\nFirst we may remark that the evidence for thought trans-\nference from the sitter does not solely consist of cases where\nthe sitter as a source of information is an alternative to the\nspiritistic hypothesis. There are a certain number of in-\nstances of thoughts at the moment in the sitter's mind, or\nwhich have been in his mind recently, being reproduced\nin or affecting the trance communications in a way that\ncan hardly be attributed to chance. As examples may be\nmentioned the cases I called attention to in Chapter III.,\np. 85, of the first appearance as controls of Sir Walter\nScott and of D. D. Home following promptly after\nHodgson had been reading about them, and of Madame\nGuyon's first appearance occurring similarly in connexion\nwith a sitter who had been reading about her. 1\nA case\nof knowledge of what Hodgson and Professor Newbold\nhad been thinking is mentioned on p. 86. A case of a\nreply being given at a sitting on December 8, 1893, to pre-\nvious thoughts of the sitter, which had not been mentioned\nin Mrs. Piper's presence, will be found in Proceedings, Vol.\nXIII. , p. 489, as follows :\nThe day before the sitting Mr. Sutton had questioned\nwhether it was right or desirable for them to bring them\nback for our gratification. It did not occur to him during\nthe sitting, but Alonzo said, \" Do not think it wrong to bring\nus back\u2014we love to come.\"\n1\nIn this last case there may, however, have been a cross-correspondence\n(see Chapter III., p. 123).\n\f298 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nIn the same way Hodgson records on December 2, 1902,\nthat a subject he and a previous sitter had discussed two\ndays before\u2014a fourth dimension of space\u2014turned up at\nthe sitting.\nHodgson several times notes the uttering by the controls\nof a thought at the moment in his mind, but in some cases,\ne.g. in one on March 19, 1897, quoted in Chapter IV.\n(p. 151), and perhaps in one on July 1, 1895 (Appendix, p. 627),\nthe coincidence might result merely from the same idea being\nsuggested to both by what had been said. Professor Hyslop's\ncase quoted below, however, p. 299 (October 10, 1906), seems\nfree from this objection. And a somewhat similar case\n(January 24, 1893) is described in Proceedings, Vol. XIII.,\np. 438, when G. P. divined what Hodgson was going to\nask him to do, and said he heard him say it. Hodgson had\nnot done so\u2014at least at the sitting\u2014and replied that G. P.\nmust have heard his thought.\nThought-transference of this limited kind the controls\nsometimes admit, but they are chary of admitting even this\nmuch, and go so far on other occasions as to deny that they\nget ideas from the sitter's mind at all. Their dislike of the\ntelepathic hypothesis is probably due to the fear that it\nwould militate against a spiritistic hypothesis. This comes\nout, for instance, in passages from the sittings of May 23\nand 24, 1905, which will be found in the Appendix, p. 620.\nAnd these passages also bring out inconsistencies in which\nthe unqualified denial of telepathy from the sitter involves\nthe controls. On May 23, G. P. is very emphatic in his\nassertion that the sitter's \" mind has nothing to do with\nit.\" The next day Rector expresses amusement at the\nsitter's idea \" that we were able to pick out of thy\nmind * * * words or names of friends, etc.\" The sitter\nsays she is not alone in this opinion, which leads Rector\nto say rather inconsistently :\nNo mortal could possibly be more conscious of this\nattitude toward [us ?] than we ourselves are. Remember\nfriend we are in no wise dead or asleep to the realisation\nof the thoughts of mortals concerning us. We not only\nunderstand fully what they think but we often hear\nconversations which actually take place between mortals.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 299\nThe fuller extracts from these two sittings in the\nAppendix will be found interesting, and with them should\nbe compared Rector's remarks on April 15, 1897 (Appendix,\np. 621).\nOne way in which the controls seek to limit the admis-\nsion of telepathic help from the sitter is by granting that\nthey borrow words from the sitter but not ideas. See\ne.g. February 13, 1897 (Appendix to Chapter III., p. 477):\nR. H. These words suggested to me a misappreciation of\nwhat you really meant.\nImpekatok (writing). I am not responsible for my words. I\nam obliged to borrow more or less of your own.\nR. H. That is to say, you have a thought, and the words\ndepend in part at least on your interlocutor.\nImp. Yes\nThis same idea was expressed by Rector (as reported\nby Mr. Dorr) somewhat more fully on March 20, 1905\n(see Appendix, p. 622). Mr. Dorr had suggested that\ncommunications were influenced by the mind of the sitter,\nand Rector replied that the language in which the thought\nwas expressed was often largely borrowed from the sitter's\nmind, but that the thought itself was not.\nIn 1906, on the other hand, HodgsonP,\ncontrolling or\ncommunicating, franldy admitted mind-reading on more\nthan one occasion. Thus on March 21, 1906, the following\nremarks are recorded by Professor Hyslop (see Proceedings\nAmerican S.P.B., Vol. IV., p. 682) :\nProf. Hyslop. I have seen evidences every now and then that\nyou get my thoughts which I do not utter.\nHodgsonp. Indeed I do. I am as clear in reading your\nthoughts as you are in thinking them.\nAnd again on October 10, 1906 (op. cit., p. 719) :\nHodgsonp .\nHyslop I am going to tell you something private.\nI do not want you to remarry that woman with\nthe children.\nProf. Hyslop. To whom do you refer ?\nHoDGsoNp. I mean the one in your life now.\n\f300 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nProf. Hyslop. Good, I did not want to open that matter\nfirst.\nHor>GsoNp. Good. I hear you think almost. I almost hear\nyou think.\nPossibly, however, HodgsonP retained some anxiety lest\nthe idea of telepathy from the sitter should be carried too\nfar\u2014at least, this may be the implication in the following\nconversation on April 25, 190G (o}). cit., p. 696) :\n{Reference had been made to a correct statement by\nHodgsonp about something said in a conversation\nHodgson had had with Professor Newbold.\n}\nProf. Hyslop. Yes Hodgson, and you told me the same thing\ntwice.\nHodgsonp. What thing before I came over do you\u2014\nProf. Hyslop. Yes Hodgson.\nHoDGsoNp. Oh yes I remember it well.\nProf. Hyslop. Good.\nHoDGsoNp. There is no telepathy in this except as it comes\nfrom my mind to yours.\nProf. Hyslop. Good. Then telepathy is at least a part of the\nprocess by which you communicate with me ?\nHoDGsoNp. Most assuredly it is and I had a vague idea before\nI came over.\nProf. Hyslop. Yes, you did.\nHodgsonp . You remember our talks about the telepathic\ntheory of our friends' thoughts reaching us from\nthis side telepathically\u2014[correct] communicating tele-\npathically from our side to yours.\nTo the influence of sitters\u2014not necessarily telepathic\n\u2014\nwe may attribute, I think, a remarkable difference in\nquality, varying apparently with the country in which\nthey occur, in the communications of GurneyP ,\nMyersP ,\nand HodgsonP , whether as communicators or controls.\nGurneyP was a much more interesting communicator in\nEngland than in America, while with HodgsonP the reverse\nwas the case, and the importance of MyersP as a communi-\ncator was greatly enhanced when Mrs. Piper came to\nEngland in 1906. The effect of place was, I imagine, acci-\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 301\ndental, except so far as Mrs. Piper's associations may have\nmade Myers seem to her a more appropriate communicator\nthan Hodgson in England, and thus have helped sub-\nliminally to bring him into comparative prominence.\nBut it is probable, indeed practically certain, that the sitters\n\u2014different in the two countries\u2014had hi various ways an\nimportant influence on the communications, and this might\nwell account for the greater interest of what MyersP had\nto say in England.\nThe case of HodgsonP is more difficult to understand.\nDuring the first few months after Hodgson's death he\nappeared to be a most vivid and impressive communicator\nto marry of his friends in the United States, as readers of\nWilliam James's Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson Control\n[Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.) are aware. Why in England,\nonly a few months later, HodgsonP should have almost\nentirely failed to recognise intimate friends of Hodgson's,\nor to be put on the track of memories which one would\nsuppose Hodgson must have retained, one does not see.\nThe fact that it was three or four years since Hodgson\nand his English friends had met in the flesh hardly seems\na sufficient explanation.\nThe Gurney case is still more curious. Gurney died in\nthe summer of 1888, and a Gurney control made its\nappearance through Mrs. Piper in America on several\noccasions in March, 1889, when Professor William James\nwas present. He gives some account of it in Proceedings,\nVol. VI., pp. 655-6, which was published in 1890, calling\nthe control \" E.\", and says \" neither then, 1\nnor at any\nother time, was there to my mind the slightest inner\nverisimilitude in the personation.\" Hodgson, who was\npresent at at least one of these sittings, also describes\nthis control in Vol. VIII., pp. 44-45, agreeing that it was\nnot like Gurney. He adds :\nIf we assume that this control was the \" make-up \" of\nMrs. Piper's secondary personality, it apparently involved\nsome very subtle use of information drawn telepathically\n1\nThat is at the first appearance, when GurneyP purported to communicate\nthrough Phinuit. On other occasions he \"'\ncontrolled \" himself.\n\f302 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nfrom at least the minds of the sitters, and at the same\ntime the most extravagant ignorance and confusion con-\ncerning other facts, some of which were known to the\nsitters, and which we should expect to be vivid in the\nremembrance of \" E.\"\nMrs. Piper visited England in the winter of 1889-90, and\nthere the personation was good. Some very private\nthings, too private for publication, which could not\npossibly be known to Mrs. Piper, were referred to\u2014first\nin the presence of sitters who were aware of them ; and\nthe control as witnessed by Sir Oliver Lodge was vivid\nand plausible, and to some extent evidential. Extracts\nfrom Sir Oliver Lodge's sittings at which Gurney appeared\nare given in Proceedings, Vol. VI., and more fully in\nProceedings, Vol. XXIII., pp. 140-1 02. I have quoted\none passage in Chapter II., p. 60. The pseudonym \" E.\" was\nadopted in reporting in 1890, partly because of the\nextremely private nature of the more evidential matter,\nand partly because of the badness of the American mani-\nfestations. For the two reasons together it seemed better\nto wait for further developments before bringing any\nGurney communications as such before the Society. That\nthese further developments were to be expected was\nclearly indicated in the passage referred to above, and\nagain in such passages as the following (evening of\nFebruary 3, 1890, op. tit., p. 158) :\nWell Lodge I must be going. Good-bye. Stick to a good\nthing and don't give it up. Go on with the investigation.\nI will help you. This will be the thing of the future,\nand will increase people's happiness. More mediums will\narise, and communication will be easier. Good-bye.\nPhinuit professed to think highly of Gurney's capa-\ncities as a control, as is shown by a remark he made\n(morning of February 3, 1890, op. cit., p. 160) to Sir Oliver\nLodge who had asked that a certain communicator should\ncontrol instead of only sending messages, and was told it\nwas too difficult. He pleaded that Mr. Gurney did it,\nto which Phinuit replied :\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 303\nYes, Mr. Gurney does, but Mr. Gurney is a scientific\nman, who has gone into these things He comes and turns\nme out sometimes. It would be a very narrow place into\nwhich Mr. Gurney couldn't get.\nAfter Mrs. Piper's return to America, however, nothing\nfurther of interest seems to have occurred. Gurney com-\nmunicated and controlled occasionally, but in a brief and\nineffective manner, and other controls seemed to assume that\nthis must necessarily be so. G. P. said on November 30,\n1892 :\nG. P. He has not been allowed and not had the power to\ncome back as I do.\ni|e 3|e 3fe a|c\nHe would like to have been a help to you but he\nhas not been allowed through this medium or any\nother.\nR. H. Well, Phinuit told us that Gurney told him that he\nwould give us a long article.\nG. P. I think he will be able to do a few things like that,\nbut never do what I do.\nAnd again on June 15, 1895, G. P. said of him to\nProfessor Newbold :\nG. P. A brighter man never existed, yet when he tries to\nspeak he is all balled up.\n'\nBalled up '\nis, I understand, American slang for confused.\nG. P.'s view must therefore be held to be in contradiction\nto the facts if it was Gurney who controlled in the English\nsittings of 1889-90. But GurneyP in America himself sup-\nported G. P.'s view, for he said to Hodgson on January 25,\n1897 :\nGurneyp (writing). I have been very much interested in your\nfriend George. He has just taken my place and\ndone what I should have liked to have done.\nR. H. He's been a jewel.\nGuBNEYp. Yet I fear my [undecipherable] was too shaky to do\nso. My head was not clear, and is not yet, when\nI speak to you.\n\f304 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nAnd again, in the course of a brief communication\nthrough Rector on October 31, 1900, he said :\nI am out of my general haziness into light at last.\nThis he repeated on January 29, 1902, saying :\nI have passed out of my haziness since Myers and\nthe rest of the comrades joined me.\nBetween these two last-mentioned sittings, on April 8,\n1901, Mrs. Piper, in the waking-stage, made the curious\nremarks recorded as follows (see Appendix to Chapter VI.,\np. 578) :\n[To R. H.] That's a queer tiling. I'll tell you some-\nthing. R. H. What ?\nThere's Mr. Sidgwick, and they've taken Mr. Gurney\nout of a hole. They found him and took him out.\nYou never saw a man so pleased as he was. He's\nnearer than he was. He's getting {next words\napparently lost.\n}\nWhat change had occurred to put GurneyP into a haze,\nor a hole, or to cause him to be \" balled up \" after he\nhad been so clear in 1889-90, does not appear. Nor does\nhis coming out of the haze appear to have led to improved\ncommunications.\nIn England in 1906-7 he did not, I think, put in an\nappearance, and I believe that after 1903 his next mani-\nfestation was in England in 1910-11. He was then\nexpected by one of the sitters introduced by Sir Oliver\nLodge, and, after being asked for, communicated clearly\nand with a good deal of appropriateness to the occasion. It\nwill be remembered that Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage of\nDecember 2, 1910, after a sitting in which GurneyP had\ncommunicated, described a visionary man she saw in a\nway that fitted Gurney, and when shown a photograph\nof him recognised it with a decision that impressed Sir\nOliver Lodge as genuine. The incident is described fully\nabove, Chapter VI., pp. 252-253. What was also apparently\na vision of him had occurred two months earlier on October\n10. There had been a similar one on October 31, 1900,\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 305\nafter the sitting quoted from above. Mrs. Piper said in\nthe waking-stage :\nThere's a great tall man with a large moustache.\n{Hodgson appends the note} [E. G.?] 1\nIt is certainly difficult to put all these communications\nfrom and concerning GurneyP together so as to make a\nconsistent personality, and the easiest explanation of the\ndiscrepancies seems on the whole to lie in the different\nexpectations of Hodgson in America and Sir Oliver Lodge\nand other sitters in England.\nFrom the influence of sitters we may pass to the\nsupposed influence at sittings of objects connected with\nparticular persons, whether dead or living. Such articles\nor objects are often in the conversations between sitters\nand trance personalities simply called \" influences,\" and I\nshall use this term in what follows. Influences are supposed\nto bring the control into touch with then owners or former\nowners, and are sometimes spoken of as a source of infor-\nmation which may be used to prove that the presence of a\nsitter is not necessary. Thus, on April 27, 1904, Hodgson\nrecords the following remarks, elicited through an \" in-\nfluence \" of Mrs. B. being presented to Rector who had\nexpressed a wish to hear from her :\nR. + {i.e. Imperator} before the light permanently closes\non the earthly side of life would like to use it for\nfifteen or sixteen Sabbaths {i.e. weeks} for the purpose\nof obtaining messages etc. from our world from influences\nalone, for the express purpose of proving to mortals the\nfact that it is not necessary for them to be present at\nthe light to obtain such. 2\nSitters wishing for some particular communicator, or\ndesiring information about some distant living person, are\ngenerally advised to bring to the sitting some article\nconnected with him, one that has been much worn or\n1 It is not of course unlikely that Mrs. Piper in her normal state\nhad seen a likeness of Gurney in England in 1889-90.\n2\nInfluences were much in use about this time for medical diagnosis.\nu\n\f306 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nhandled by him being preferred. This \" influence \" is\nput into the hands of the medium or placed close to the\nwriting block. In a voice sitting it can be held by the\nmedium all the time, and in a writing sitting it can be\nfelt and grasped at intervals. During the G. P. regime,\nwhen divided control was the usual condition\u2014or at least\nwas supposed to be\u2014an \" influence \" would often be given\nto the left hand to occupy Phinuit's attention and enable\nG. P. to write with the right hand uninterrupted by\nPhinuit. Influences are not represented as always necessary,\nnor are they always asked for, but their absence is some-\ntimes an excuse for failure.\nOne's first impression naturally is that all this must be\nnonsense, but the evidence on the whole seems to show\nthat some effect is produced by influences, though probably\nnot in the way the controls say and perhaps think.\nHodgson says in his first Report (Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 21)\nthat he thinks Phinuit\nis much more likely to succeed with the help of such\nobjects than without them. It is quite conceivable, of\ncourse, that Phinuit's belief that such articles act as clues\nmay itself influence his success, even though that belief be\nmerely subjective.\nAgain {Proc, Vol. VIII., pp. 56-57) :\nPossibly Phinuit may be assisted in some way by in-\nanimate objects which have been much worn or handled by\nspecific persons, and, as I have said, they seem to add to\nthe chances of his success. * * * Phinuit apparently claims\nthat such objects bring him into relation with the persons\nwho have handled them, whether such persons be living or\ndead. Now where the sitter knows the circumstances con-\nnected with the object, the associations will probably form\na specially vivid cluster of experiences in his mind, con-\nscious or subconscious, owing to the very presence of the\nobject within the field of his perception, and this may help\nPhinuit to discover and disentangle these associations by\ndirect thought-transference. Where, on the other hand,\nthe sitter is ignorant of the circumstances connected with\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 307\nthe object, it may, at any rate, form a sort of point de\nrepere enabling Pbinuit to get telepathically, through the\nmind of the sitter, at the mind of the distant living\nperson from whom the object was obtained, and who\nknows of its associations.\nI do not think further experience has thrown much\nmore light on the subject, and perhaps that is why\nHodgson does not discuss it again in his second report.\nA good deal has, however, been said about it by the\ntrance personalities since his first report was written, and\nit may be well to give some account of their statements.\nAccordingly, I quote in the Appendix various general\naccounts given by them, and also particular cases of the\nuse of influences connected with dead or living people,\nwhich illustrate or throw doubt on their theories. These\nare arranged in chronological order. The fullest account\nin some respects is that given by Doctor on February 8,\n1897 (see p. 628), but he confines himself almost entirely\nto the use of influences from the point of view of communi-\ncators. From this point of view he, with the assistance\nof Hodgson, attributes five uses to an influence. It attracts\nits former owner, stimulates his associations, makes him feel\nat home, and, owing to \" its own light,\" in some way gives\nhim strength to communicate. It also helps \" him to avoid\nbeing telepathically acted upon by spirits,\" whether in or\nout of the body apparently. This last is presumably what\nRector means when he talks of the influence holding \" the\ndesired spirit apart from others avIio might otherwise un-\nconsciously interrupt \" (Dec. 2, 1902, see Appendix, p. 637),\nand keeping \" the communicators clear \" (May 6, 1903, see\nAppendix, p. 638).\nG. P., in his account given to Professor Newbold on\nJune 20, 1895, and to Hodgson on July 1, 1895 (see\nAppendix, pp. 624, 626), looks at the matter from the point\nof view of the control who, it is said, gets from the influence\nan impression of the owner, living or dead, which enables\nthe control to recognize him in the spirit world ;\nor,\nin the case of a distant living owner, to diagnose,\nmedically or otherwise, his case. G. P., as control on\nDec. 26, 1896 (see Appendix, p. 628), confirms this idea\n\f308 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthat recognition by the control of the spirit owner of an\ninfluence is an important object to be attained by pre-\nsenting it, for he says the absence of the influence after\nthe first sitting will make no difference, \" I would know\nhim anywhere after this.\"\nIt is interesting to note that G. P. and Doctor both\ndeny, or at least are very sceptical about, the possibility\nof what is called psychometry\u2014the learning from an\nobject its own history without the intervention of a spirit\nconnected with it (see Appendix, pp. 625, 634).\nWe are told various other things about influences, such\nas that their effect diminishes with use (see Appendix,\nFebruary 8, 1897, p. 632), and with lapse of time (Appen-\ndix, June 20, 1895, p. 624, and April 11, 1905, p. 642) ;\nthat they deteriorate from being carried across the water\n\u2014i.e. the Atlantic Ocean (Appendix, November 22, 1905,\np. 643), and, again, from having been handled by many\npeople (Appendix, June 20, 1895, p. 624), or being much in\ncontact with other influences. These difficulties, whether\ngenume or not, obviously afford excuses for failure.\nIt will be observed that the effective part of an in-\nfluence is sometimes described as its \" light,\" or as\n\" etherial.\" This part is sometimes said to be taken to\nthe other world for use apart from the sittings apparently.\nThus, on March 7, 1900 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.,\np. 409), Bennie Junot says :\nYou see I took all my influences with me. [At end of\nprevious sitting the hand fingered some of the articles\n{that had belonged to Bennie} and acted as if \" drawing\nsome influence\" from them, after the writing ceased.\u2014R. H.]\nAnd I am better now and perhaps I can tell you more.\nAnd again, on March 27, 1900, Bennie says (Proceedings,\nVol. XXIV., p. 425) :\nHe who is helping me is calling me to take my influences\nand give it up for now.\nCompare also Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 492, where\nPhinuit is said, on December 21, 1893, to make a motion\nof drawing something from a living child's lock of hair and\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper s Trance Phenomena. 309\ngiving it to the child spirit, Kakie, saying, \" Now she has\nit. She can get nearer her little sister with it.\"\nIt is rather bewildering to find on Jnly 5, 1904\n(Appendix, p. 639), that the spirit of the influence cannot\nthus be taken to the spirit world unless the influence\nis held by the medium before the control begins to depart\n\u2014notwithstanding that the presence of an influence during\nthe waking-stage tends apparently to keep its spirit\nowner hanging about against his will (see April 14, 1908,\nAppendix, p. 643). Rector, having failed to take the spirit\nof Mr. D.'s influence away with him on July 4, 1904,\nhas to show the influence itself to Imperator during the\nsitting on the 5th, as well as to take away its spirit at the\nend of the sitting.\nVarious views as to the influences of living people will\nbe found expressed in the cases quoted in the Appendix.\nPhinuit's theory on January 24, 1893 (p. 623), apparently\nwas that the perspiration of the body on the influence is\ncarried on the air and that he follows it to the person's\nspiritual body ; \u2014an explanation which, as one of the\nsitters, Mr. Howard, remarks, \" is very obscure.\" Rector,\non October 28, 1902, takes a more spiritual view apparently.\nThe influence brings the spirit of its living owner almost\nas close to him as the sitter, he can see it so perfectly\n(p. 636). It is, however, the body of Mr. X. that he sees\nso plainly on December 8, 1902 (p. 638), and on December\n19, 1904 (p. 640), it was \" the astral light which the\narticle carried with it which brought \" him \" in immediate\ntouch with \" the owner's organism. On February 7, 1905,\nseveral erroneous guesses having been made about the\nowner of the influence which had been in Hodgson's pos-\nsession for some weeks, Rector opines (p. 641) that\nWe see his condition from the objects presented at the\ntime when they were connected with him. This is a\ntrifle confusing as the case stands now.\nAnd on April 24, 1905 (p. 643), the control, owing to a\nspecial sympathy between a father and daughter, is able\n\" to reach her aura through his objects.\"\nAltogether, what the controls say is not very explanatory.\n\f310 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nnor I think does it add much to the data Hodgson\nhad before him when he framed the telepathic hypothesis\nquoted above. That hypothesis still seems to me plausible,\nthough I learn from Professor Newbold that Hodgson had\ndefinitely abandoned it.\n1\nIt involves, of course, the active\npart in the telepathic process being taken by the controls,\nwho must get out of the sitter's mind certain ideas, con-\nscious or subconscious, which are grouped together there\nand marked off by the presence of the influence. The in-\nfluence in its effect on the sitter's mind may even form a\nkind of frame into which ideas derived by the controls from\nelsewhere may or may not be found to fit\u2014a sort of touch-\nstone by which the appropriateness of ideas can be tele-\npathically tested before they are selected for utterance. It\nis not at all incompatible with this hypothesis about in-\nfluences that they are by no means used with uniform\nsuccess, and that communicators may sometimes claim as\ntheirs articles presented by sitters, and yet fail altogether\nto give the slightest evidence of identity, or to offer any\nplausible communications.\nBut influences were resorted to and apparently found\nuseful in Mrs. Piper's trances in cases where the useful-\nness cannot have consisted either in the things G. P. and\nDoctor claim for them, or in their being aids to tele-\npathic selection. For instance, when Mrs. Piper was in\nEngland in 1906-7, and also later, the trance controls\nprofessed to get strength and help when the hand grasped\na handkerchief, known as \" the healer's influence,\" which\nhad belonged, I believe, to a lady in America\u2014a mental\nhealer (see Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 308). It would\nbe grasped at moments of seeming weakness, not because\nany communication with its former owner or her friends\nwas sought for or obtained, but for the strength to be\nderived from it. We can hardly, however, suppose that\nthe handkerchief was an important and persisting store-\nhouse of strength, especially as, according to the control's\nviews, it must have lost some of its effect in crossing the\n1\n1 do not know what hypothesis he put in its place, given, what I think\nwas the case, that he believed in the efficacy of articles in attracting \" spirits\nand in tapping a stream of veridical communications.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 311\nocean. Influences, again, connected with a constant com-\nmunicator like Hodgson can hardly have been required for\nany effect in facilitating selection from the mind of the\nsitter, though their presentation by a sitter may sometimes\nhave indicated in a normal manner that communication\nwith Hodgson was desired. Nor, though it is asserted\nthat Hodgson's influences did attract and hold him,\napparently by a process he found it difficult to resist\n(see April 14 and 21, 1908, Appendix, pp. 643, 644), would one\nsuppose them necessary either to attract him, or to make\nhim feel at home, or to stimulate associations.\nIt is possible that the use of influences was sometimes\na piece of ritual. Of ritual\u2014forms and ceremonies to be\nobserved\u2014there is a good deal in Mrs. Piper's trance\nprocedure, as will be obvious to readers who have followed\nmy examination of it so far, and ritual may have an im-\nportant subjective effect both on medium and sitters.\nBut there is another possibility to be considered. The\nuse of the healer's influence, if not of Hodgson's, suggests\nthat holding an object for a few seconds with the hand\nmay have had a kind of steadying effect on the trance\ncondition\u2014helping perhaps to fix the attention and avert\nsome tendency to dream-like instability. It may have\nhelped in some such way as holding a friend's hand helps\nsome people to maintain self-control when in pain. Or the\nmere pause involved in grasping an influence, slight as it\nwas, may have been helpful in some way, as is suggested,\nfor example, by the following passage in Mr. Dorr's record\nof March 17, 1908 (Mr. Dorr it will be remembered was\ntrying to draw out reminiscences of classical literature from\nMyersP ) :\nMYEBSp. VENUS\n[Written haltingly and pausing between letters to\ngrasp influence of healer and hold it for a moment.\nThis was repeatedly done during the sitting in get-\nting difficult words through.]\nG. B. D. Good. Write it again.\nMyebsp. Wait until I get fight VENUS.\n[Takes influence again and holds it for another\nmoment.]\n\f312 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nMyeksp . Beauty. Apple angered Juno.\nAn incident is recorded on May 8, 1908, at another of Mr.\nDorr's sittings, of a longer pause partly filled by grasping\ninfluences, which, if it was not mere acting, perhaps illus-\ntrates the point further. After HodgsonP has translated the\nTavern Club motto with considerable energy :\n[The hand now rests, limp and cold, without move-\nment for some time, then writes very faintly :]\nHoDGsoNp. Exhausted . . . wait.\n[A long pause now follows, G. B. D. placing in the\nhand the Healer's and R. H.'s influences, which\nit holds tightly for a while, then writes :]\nHoDGsoNp. That took so much light, George.\nIt somewhat confirms the idea that one object of\ninfluences was to have something to grasp\u2014whether with\nthe desire to secure a pause or for some other reason\n\u2014\nthat when Dr. Stanley Hall substituted on one occasion\nfor Hodgson's influences some similar articles of his own,\nthe change was not seemingly noticed by the Hodgson\ncontrol, who held Dr. Hall's influences with apparent\nsatisfaction (Studies in Spiritism, pp. 236-253). This is\nwhat one would expect if all that was really wanted was\nsomething to grasp at intervals. That it was the accus-\ntomed form of the article associated with Hodgson that\ncounted rather than any real connexion of it with him, is\nindicated by an incident on December 31, 1906, reported by\nMr. Piddington. Rector writes\n:\nR. We want the influence friend.\n(J. G. P. gives skull cap, and hand rejects it.)\nJ. G. P. Both are Hodgson influences ; but the one you had last\ntime and the time before is not here.\nR. Too bad why do you change them. We wish him to\nbecome accustomed to the same it will help much\nto avoid confusion.\nAt some periods of the Piper history the same advantage,\nwhatever it was, seems to have been obtained by resting\nthe hand on the head of the sitter. This happened very\nfrequently in 1896 and 1897 with various controls and\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 313\nsitters. It is asked for as giving strength. I give two\nexamples from these years in the Appendix (November 17,\n1896, and November 10, 1897, p. 644), and also a later one,\nMarch 17, 1908. See also March 5, 1897 (Appendix to\nChapter III., p. 498). On at least one occasion, March 3,\n1897, a pause is secured by another plan\u2014Rector asks to\nhave something read to him. He says, \" Read for me a\nmoment * * * not my statements. Anything to give me\nstrength.\" Hodgson recited some lines of poetry, after\nwhich Rector proceeded with his discourse 1\n(see Appendix,\np. 645). Perhaps the object here and in other cases may\nhave been to gain time to think what to say next.\nIn the cases so far referred to it was the control who\napparently desired a pause ; but the need for one, or for\nrest of some sort, is constantly said to be felt by com-\nmunicators. This is sometimes attributed to the difficulty\nof remaining in the suffocating air of this world (see Chapter\nV., p. 160), sometimes merely to fatigue and weakness.\nWhatever the cause of the exhaustion\u2014whether, as the\ncontrols say, it is due to the quasi-physical difficulties of\ncommunicating or to the strain of making the control under-\nstand ; or whether, as we must suppose if we think the\ncommunicator's part as represented to us is an acted part,\nit is due to the mental effort required in the case of a new\ncommunicator or one trying to give evidential matter\n\u2014\nwhatever the cause, the result is that the communicator\n\" goes out \" for a shorter or longer time. An example will\nbe found in Chapter V., p. 162 (May 24, 1904). In this\ninstance the intervals during the communicator's absence\nwere filled in one case by a silence, in the other by a more\nstereotyped communicator who said nothing of special in-\nterest. My impression is that such intervals are usually\nfilled up with talk of a kind involving little effort, either by\nthe control or a familiar communicator, but it would b\nrash without further investigation than I have made to\naffirm this as a fact. 2\n1\n1 understand from Professor Newbold that at one period Hodgson\nthus recited poetry to the control not infrequently.\n2\nFor a note about breaks in the trance of a more marked kind\u2014definite\ninterruptions in the trance state\u2014see p. 215, footnote.\n\f314 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

This supernormal element\nI take for granted, and its existence must therefore, of\ncourse, be taken into account in briefly summing up the\nconclusions to which the examination of the material may\nlead us.\nThe principal questions to which we want answers\nare :\n(1) Is there reason to think, as was maintained by\nHodgson in his second report, that any spirit independent\nof Mrs. Piper exercises at any time direct control over any\npart of Mrs. Piper's organism ?\n(2) If not, or indeed in any case, what kind of divided\nconsciousness is manifested in Mrs. Piper ? Are the con-\ntrols secondary personalities and in what sense ?\nTo the first question my answer is probably already\nplain to the reader, even if it has not been explicitly\nstated. The intelligence in direct communication with the\nsitter, whom we have called the control, is not, as it\nprofesses to be, an independent spirit using Mrs. Piper's\norganism, but some phase or element of Mrs. Piper's own\nconsciousness. This conclusion rests chiefly on the evidence\nset forth in Chapters II. and III. and the Appendices thereto.\nI do not see how on any other hypothesis we are to\n\f316 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\naccount for absurd personations like, e.g. Julius Caesar,\nwhich, it will be observed, is in no way distinguished by\nother controls as different in nature from themselves.\nNor on any other hypothesis can we easily account for\nthe absurd statements made and the ignorance exhibited\nby these other controls. We cannot, for instance, reason-\nably suppose that the limitations of Mrs. Piper's organism\nnot only inhibit the getting through of scientific informa-\ntion, but alter what does come through into nonsensical\nstatements dressed up in pseudo-scientific jargon. Even\nif we ought not to expect Rector and Imperator, who\nprofess to have lived on earth in more or less remote\ntimes, to be acquainted with modern science\u2014any more\nthan we can expect it of Mrs. Piper 1\n\u2014we should still less\nexpect these exalted spirits to use scientific nomenclature\nin a way that shows total want of understanding of what\nthey are talking about.\nAnd the ignorance is not confined to science. Mrs. Piper\nmight easily have given little attention to Old Testament\nhistory or the history of Christianity, but that Imperator,\nif the great spirit he professes to be, should undertake to\ninstruct Hodgson in the true inwardness of these things,\nand contrive even while confining himself to vague gener-\nalities to talk so much nonsense about them, is difficult\nto conceive. Again, Mrs. Piper might well have erroneous\nnotions concerning Adam Bede and imagine him to be\na real person whom she might meet in the other world,\nbut it is hardly possible that George Eliot should make a\nsimilar mistake and report having met him without\nexpressing any surprise. G. P.'s philosophical talk (see\nProceedings, Vol. XV., p. 26) is another case in point.\nBut I need not multiply instances in which the trance\n1\nIt must be allowed, however, that some of the nonsense talked\n(e.g. monkeys in the sun, p. 86) is not what we should expect the normal\nMrs. Piper to utter, and must, if a centre of consciousness of Mrs.\nPiper is responsible, be attributed to a dream-like abeyance of the inhibi-\ntory faculty. We all in our normal state refrain from saying some things\nof which we feel doubtful, for fear of making fools of ourselves ; in doing\nso we often conceal ignorance, but also, no doubt, fail to give ourselves\ncredit for knowledge which we more or less possess, or could make a good\nguess at.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 317\nutterances are natural enough as coming from Mrs. Piper\nbut not as coming from the supposed control, even\nif allowance be made for confusion and difficulty.\nCommunicators are not supposed, like controls, to\ninfluence Mrs. Piper's organism directly, but I may as\nwell say here that, in the case of what I have called\nthe dramatic communicators\u2014communicators as manifested\nat the sittings\u2014(see p. 180), there are much the same\narguments for refusing to regard them as entities inde-\npendent of Mrs. Piper as there are in the case of the\ncontrols. Dramatic communicators, like controls, are\nsometimes clearly false, and no criterion is offered in the\nrepresentation itself, or in its relation to the control, by which\na false communicator may be distinguished from a true one.\nThe existence of false communicators is not admitted at all.\nThere are, however, two respects in which the com-\nmunications both of controls and communicators appear\nat times to transcend what the normal Mrs. Piper could\nproduce. First, they sometimes show greater capacity in\ncertain directions than she probably possesses in the normal\nstate\u2014as, e.g. when advice is given, impressive to the\nrecipient of it both in form and matter. And, secondly,\nthey sometimes give evidence of possessing information,\nconnected with special persons dead or alive, which is\nnot accessible to the normal Mrs. Piper, and which may\neven be, as in the G. P. case, sufficient to enable so\nsuccessful a personation to be produced that some of his\nfriends found it easier to suppose it not a personation\nat all, but G. P. himself. It is these powers which\nhave led investigators like Hodgson to accept the trance\npersonages' own account of themselves at its face value\n\u2014\nat least, to a large extent. But, though these powers are\nof great interest and importance in the study of the case,\nthey are, it seems to me, quite as compatible with the hypo-\nthesis that the trance personalities are phases or elements\nof Mrs. Piper as with any other. The increased capacity is\na phenomenon frequently observed in the case of hypno-\ntised persons, and presumably is not due to a real or funda-\nmental increase of mental power, but to the removal of\nsomething\u2014as, e.g. want of confidence or of power of atten-\n\f318 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\ntion\u2014which inhibits a power always there, though generally\nlatent. About this there is, of course, nothing supernormal\nin the psychical research sense.\nAs to the supernormal knowledge, its source is an\nimportant question. If it all came telepathically from\nliving persons near or distant, no one would be likely to\nregard the interposition of an alien spirit controlling Mrs.\nPiper's organism as a necessary hypothesis. Up to the\ndate of his first report\u2014dealing with the evidence to the\nend of 1891\u2014Hodgson was of opinion that the evidence\nwas not sufficient to prove more than this. He wrote\n(Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 57) :\nPutting aside all the facts which can be explained by\ndirect thought-transference from the sitter, and considering\nsimply the information given which was not known to the\nsitter and which purports to come from \" deceased\n\"\npersons, but which was known to, and afterwards verified\nby, distant living persons,\u2014is there sufficient ground for\nconcluding that Phinuit is in direct communication with\n\" deceased \" persons, and that he is a deceased person\nhimself as he alleges ? I think that the evidence here\npresented, together with that previously published, is\nvery far from sufficient to establish any such con-\nclusion.\nLater, the evidence that some of the knowledge super-\nnormally acquired comes from the dead became stronger,\nchiefly owing to the G. P. case, and it has been further\nstrengthened by more recently published evidence. Does\nthis alter the argument ? Surely not, if communication\nwith the dead is also telepathic. And unless telepathy\nbetween the living is a physical process, a hypothesis\nwhich becomes more and more improbable as our know-\nledge increases, it is natural to suppose that telepathic\ncommunication between spirits in the body is similar in\nkind to communication between spirits out of the body,\nand between spirits in the body and spirits out of it ;\nthe main difference being that the body is a great\nhindrance to any awareness, or full manifestation, of such\ncommunication.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 319\nI do not forget that to some people the remarkably\nsuccessful personation of dead persons which sometimes\noccurs seems difficult to explain by telepathy, but I have\nalready given reasons in Chapter III., pp. 81-84, and in my\nprevious article, Proceedings, Vol. XV., pp. 21, 22, for\nbelieving the material necessary to successful personation\nto be within the range of what telepathy can produce.\nI may add here that I think the difficulty sometimes felt in\nadmitting this arises partly from a tendency to limit the\nscope of telepathy which has been fostered by the use of\nthe terms \" agent \" and \" percipient \" to denote respectively\nthe mind which is the source of the information transferred\nand the mind which receives it. These technical terms,\nintroduced in the early days of the S.P.R., had their origin in\nthought-transference experiments in which the person from\nwhom the idea is to be transferred tries to concentrate his\nmind on it with a view to transferring it. But the term\nagent is not very happily chosen, since it assumes that this\neffort of concentration is an effective part of the process of\ntransference, whereas for anything we know it may have\nno effect except that of ear-marking the idea it is desired to\ntransfer. It is possible that the so-called agent's part is\npurely passive, while the percipient has to play the active\npart and extract the idea or combination of ideas from the\n\" agent's \" mind. It is more probable, perhaps, that the\nactive part may be played by either of the two minds con-\ncerned in the transmission, or sometimes by both together.\nAt any rate we must be careful to remember that we know\nvery little about the process of telepathy, and not to assume\nthat the conditions and limitations of telepathic com-\nmunication can be inferred from those under which\nthe communication through the senses, with which we are\nfamiliar, occurs.\nTo the a priori reasons for thinking that evidence\npointing to communication with the dead does not in\nitself support the hypothesis of a control which is not\na phase or element of Mrs. Piper, we may add the obser-\nvation that evidence for such communication has also\nbeen obtained through other automatists whose automatic\nscript is produced without eclipse of the normal conscious-\n\f320 Mrs. Henry SidgivicJc. [part\nness, and therefore clearly without its temporary removal\nto another sphere while the control takes its place. 1\nOf course, communication with the dead, when it occurs,\nmust imply a real communicator in the background, but\nthe point is that this does not necessitate either the\ndramatic communicator or the control being other than\nphases or elements of Mrs. Piper. Nor does it exclude\nthe possibility that the dramatic communicator is a\nfiction, or a dream, or a hallucination, of the control,\neach of which things it sometimes appears to be. That\nit is with phases or elements\u2014centres of conscious-\nness\u2014of Mrs. Piper, and not with entities independent of\nher, that the sitter is in direct communication seems to me\nfor the reasons given to be the hypothesis which best\nfits the facts so far as we know them : that under which\nthey most readily fall into an intelligible order and are\nmost easily interpreted. And it is also a hypothesis\nagainst which no valid arguments have, so far as I have\nseen, been adduced.\nThere is a point about the veridical information offered\nwhich tends to confirm this hypothesis and is worth\nconsidering in the light of statements by the controls\nthemselves. It is the usually scrappy and imperfect nature\nof the information. Neither this nor the excuses made for\nit fit well with the idea of a well-informed control in\ncommunication with other spirits, but hampered in expres-\nsion by an imperfect machine. The excuses made, as\ndescribed in Chapter V., seem to interpolate the machine\ndifficulty between communicator and control as well as\nbetween control and sitter, though, if the machine be\nMrs. Piper's brain, it is not easy to see how it comes\nin there. What the attempts to give evidential communi-\ncations constantly suggest is a striving of the control\n1 1 do not wish to be taken as affirming dogmatically that no influ-\nence of a telergic kind can ever be exercised by an external mind,\ni.e. that an external mind can never affect our nervous system in\n'the same way that our own mind does. I think there is practically no\nevidence for it at present. But we know so little about the whole\nsubject, including the way our own minds affect our bodies, that dog-\nmatic assertion is best avoided. It is even possible that telepathy and\ntelergy may merge into each other.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 321\nafter information from all sources, guessing sometimes,\nfishing for information from the sitters sometimes, piecing\nslight hints together, and eagerly seizing on any impression\nor information obtained, whether normally or telepathically,\nwithout always knowing how it is arrived at or whence\nit comes. Mental groping of this kind, omitting what\ndepends on conversation with the sitter, is what the\npercipient appears often to feel he is doing in thought-\ntransference experiments. Among crowding impressions he\nhas to pick out the right one. It certainly seems, therefore,\nmore appropriate to attribute such feeling about for\ninformation, which in the end comes in an uncertain and\nfragmentary fashion if it comes at all, to some part of\nMrs. Piper's mind than to an alien spirit.\nOf course, that there is this groping is an inference from\nwhat comes out, but it is based on a general impression\nderived from a good many records of sittings, and occasion-\nally the controls make remarks which suggest that it is a\nfact and even that they are aware of it. Phinuit once, so\nHodgson reports (it was at the end of the sitting of April\n29, 1892 ; see Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 309),\nmade a few remarks about the difficulty of seeing things\nclearly, etc. \"It is like looking through a keyhole into a\nroom and trying to find out about the people passing\nbackwards and forwards.\"\nThe illustration so aptly describes what, as I have said,\nthe communications constantly suggest that I think this\nwas probably a candid account of Phinuit's experience.\nRector on one occasion asked whether a name he had\ngot right\u2014the family name of a sitter\u2014had been given by\nthe sitters, as it in fact had, or by the communicator.\nHere, again, it seems quite possible that the question was\nas innocently asked as it appeared to be, and that he\nreally did not know how he had learnt the name. The\nincident occurred on April 24, 1907, at a sitting at which\nI alone was present. Rector's opening remark after the\nusual greeting was :\nR. Friend we wished to correct an error if error it be.\ni.e. regarding the spirit who spoke last {at the\nx\n\f322 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nprevious sitting}. Was it he gave us the name or\nwas it given on your side first ?\nE. M. S. Which name, Rector ?\nR. I'll ask him. Forbes 1\nE. M. S. I told you some time ago that Mrs. Forbes was\ncoming again to a sitting, but I only told you after I\nbelieved you knew her quite well. [Her name had\nnot, however, been previously given and mentioning\nit was a slip on my part. E. M. S.]\nR. I knew her from the moment I saw her light friend\nand when her companion spoke first\nE. M. S. It was because I thought you knew her that I spoke\nto you of her as a friend.\nR. Yes quite I U.D. it so far as I could U.D. anything,\nbut I can't always be quite certain, just how much\nI am registering of what is said in the body,\nE. M. S. I see.\nR. or on our side, therefore I may register things which\nyou say as well as those spoken by friends on our\nside.\nE. M. S. Yes, I think you do sometimes, but very seldom.\nR. I do try not to do so.\nThis explanation of Rector's is interesting, but not\nrelevant to the point in question, for it was on April 17\nthat I had given away the name, and it was not referred\nto in the script till the next sitting, April 23. When I\nfirst mentioned it, HodgsonP , who was communicating\nthrough Rector, responded intelligently and appropriately,\nas understanding whom I was speaking of, and without\nsurprise at the mention of the name. He conversed, in\nfact, as if he had known it all the time, but he did not\nrepeat it.\nThe same idea of the difficulty of selecting among many\nconfused impressions is suggested by the rather frequent\nreference to a crowd of unmannerly 2\nspirits trying to get\nto the \" light \" and having to be kept back. The following\n1\nThis is substituted for the name actually given.\n2\nThe adjective is mine.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 323\nis an instance of this on March 11, 1897. Rector is\nspeaking of Iraperator and says :\nI am his assistant and follower always. He is capable of\nkeeping the others back and preventing much unnecessary\ninterference.\nThe struggle to find out things is referred to by Mrs.\nPiper in rather a curious way towards the end of the\nlong waking-stage of April 10, 1907. I was again myself\nthe recorder. She had been talking disjointedly about the\ncommunicators of the trance proper when she turned to\nspeak to me, though whether to me as other than an im-\npersonal auditor I do not know. The record goes on :\n(Confidentially to E. M. S.) People in the body never\ntell me anything [I think this was in contrast to the\nspirit people. E. M. S.] They seem to expect me to\nfind out things and I don't [know how they expect me\nto do it.]\n1\nIt is to be noted here that in the waking-stage Mrs. Piper\nseems to identify herself with the personages of the\ntrance proper\u2014for it is they who are expected by people\nin the body to find out things. This should be kept in\nmind hi seeking the answer to the second question to\nwhich we now turn.\nThe question is, granted that the controls are not alien\nspirits but some phase or fragment of Mrs. Piper, what\nkind of divided consciousness is manifested ; are the\ncontrols secondary personalities, and if so, in what sense ?\nThis question is a good deal more complicated and there-\nfore more difficult to answer than the one just discussed.\nIt cannot be answered by a simple yes or no.\nHodgson, in a passage from which I quoted in Chapter\nin., p. 80, says (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 57, and com-\npare Vol. XIII., p. 286) :\nThe hypothesis which for a long time seemed to me the\nmost satisfactory is that of an auto-hypnotic trance in\n1\nThese last words are doubtless in square brackets in the record,\nbecause I failed to put her exact words down at the moment of speak-\ning, and therefore was only certain of the meaning.\n\f324 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nwhich a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper either\nerroneously believes itself to be, or consciously and\nfalsely pretends to be, the \" spirit\" of a deceased human\nbeing, and further fictitiously represents various other\npersonalities according to the latent ideas of some of the\nsitters.\nHe had apparently already abandoned this hypothesis\nwhen he published his first report. Nevertheless, I believe\nit to be at any rate an important approximation to the\ntruth. I am disposed, however, to demur to Hodgson's\nuse of the word \" secondary personality,\" or at least to\nsay that it is not very clear how he applies it. Does he\nmean that Mrs. Piper's hypnotic self is a secondary per-\nsonality which imagines itself to be, or pretends to be,\nPhinuit ? Or does he conceive the hypnotic consciousness\nsplit up, and if so, how ? I think he really means that\nit is the hypnotic self as the dominant centre of con-\nsciousness for the moment that takes itself to be, or\npretends to be, Phinuit. And this is what appears to me\nto agree best with the facts. The hypnotic self, or some\nelement of it, successively personates a number of different\ncharacters\u2014Phinuit, G. P., Stainton Moses, Rector, George\nEliot, etc., but I think that there is no divided off part\nof Mrs. Piper which has assumed and permanently retains\nthe character of, say, Rector, and is in that sense a\nsecondary personality. Rector has no more persistent\nexistence than Hamlet has. When the part of Rector is\nnot being played he has no existence, just as Hamlet,\nhowever well the part is acted, ceases to exist as soon\nas the actor leaves the stage. That part of Mrs. Piper's\nmind which is used in acting as Rector may act as a\ndifferent control when Rector's part ends, and is doing\nsomething else when the trance is over.1\n1\nI do not say that by suggestion and education a Rector or a Phinuit\nmight not have been developed, who could manifest as a secondary per-\nsonality in Mrs. Piper's ordinary life, doing things her normal self was un-\naware of and might have objected to, as Leonie.2 did in the well-known\ncase of Madame B. (see Myers, Human Personality, 230a). But there\nis no sign of this in Mrs. Piper's case, unless we regard as such her impres-\nsion of the presence of Phinuit or Imperator when recovering from the\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 325\nThe comparison to a part played on the stage must\nnot, however, be carried too far, for whether or no Mrs.\nPiper's trance self sometimes deliberately plays a part, there\nare at other times elements in the trance drama which seem\nto preclude conscious acting. I refer especially to what\nhappens in the cases described by Hodgson (see Chapter\nII., p. 35) in which two controls carry on simultaneous\nbut independent conversations by voice and writing respec-\ntively, and in the cases where the control sees the com-\nmunicator as external to himself (see Chapter V., pp. 181-186).\nBoth these phenomena require us to suppose the trance\nself split for the time into two centres of consciousness\nacting more or less independently, just as we have to\nsuppose this when a negative hallucination is experienced\nby a hypnotised person (see Chapter II., p. 51), and such\nsplitting up cannot, so far as we know, be brought about\nby the conscious act of any centre of consciousness\ndominant for the moment.\nWhile, however, these things show that sometimes at\nleast there is division of personality of various degrees\nof completeness and complication during the trance, there\nare other considerations supporting the view stated above\nthat this particular division exists during the period of\ntrance only. For one thing, any splitting up that involved\na relatively permanent separation of as many centres of\nconsciousness as there are controls, with new ones con-\nstantly emerging, and each continuing along with the\nnormal Mrs. Piper to believe itself a separate personality\nand each liable to take in alternation the dominant position,\nwould be a form of divided consciousness not hitherto\nclassified. Moreover, such a hypothesis would be attended\nby some of the same difficulties as that of alien spirits\ncontrolling Mrs. Piper's organism. It would be almost as\ndifficult to reconcile one as the other with the evidence set\nforth in Chapter IV. for artificiality in particular controls,\nespecially artificial peculiarities of language not consistently\nmaintained, and common memories and associations of\nideas in controls who ought to be entirely distinct ; or\ninfluence of an anaesthetic\n\u2014\ni.e. when in an artificially produced state of\ndissociation.\n\f326 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nagain with the evidence, such as is given in Chapter III.,\nof inconsistencies in the make up of controls, and con-\ntradictions in what is said of them by themselves and\nothers at different times. And it must be noted further,\nthat the view that some centre of consciousness is present\nthroughout, which at least during the waking-stage realises\nitself as Mrs. Piper, and which during the trance proper\nacts or dreams the trance personages, is supported by\nthe indications of a tendency for the waking-stage, in\nwhich the dominant personality conceives itself as Mrs. Piper,\nto develoj) in the direction of resemblance to the trance\nproper (see Chapter VI.), and the consequent difficulty of\ndrawing theoretically a definite and permanent line between\nthe two ; and also by the indications, such as they are, that\nthe Mrs. Piper of the waking-stage sometimes identifies\nherself with the consciousness of the trance proper.\nThe best analogy to the controls of Mrs. Piper's trance\nis probably to be found in the personations that can be\nobtained through suggestion with some hypnotised persons.\nI called attention in Chapter I. (p. 27) to the superficial\nresemblance between the two. It is not unlikely that\nwith some hypnotic subjects it would be possible to\nimitate Mrs. Piper's trance phenomena further by making\nthem see a hallucinatory communicator while they them-\nselves were personating some one else ; or even by getting\nthem to personate two characters at once, one speaking\nand the other writing. There does not seem to be any\nobvious reason why this should be more difficult than the\nsimultaneous working of arithmetical problems and reading\naloud, which Mr. Gurney obtained by post-hypnotic suggestion\n(see Chapter II., p. 35).\nWhether a hypnotised person adopting a suggested\ncharacter really believes himself to be that character is\ndifficult to determine. It probably varies with different\nhypnotic subjects and at different times. And, similarly,\nMrs. Piper in a state of self-induced hypnosis may some-\ntimes deliberately and consciously personate the control,\nand at others believe herself to be Rector or Phinuit, while\nat still other times something between the two may occur\nand she may have a more or less hazy consciousness of\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 327\nbeing Rector but also of being Mrs. Piper. That such\nmixed states of consciousness are possible we all know from\ndreams ; and we may also observe them in children in a\nnormal waking state. Children may, e.g. be genuinely\nfrightened by a wolf, knowing all the time that it is not a\nwolf, but their own father assuming the character at their\nown request. It seems not unlikely, though difficult to\nprove, that a child's normal state may resemble that of an\nadult in hypnosis in the fact of the subliminal self being\nfreer to act\u2014less kept under by the supraliminal\u2014than is\nthe case with normal grown up people. Such mixed or dual\nconsciousness was perhaps what led to Phinuit's description\n(see Chapter II., p. 31) of his inability sometimes to get\ncomplete possession of Mrs. Piper. He may have been\nreferring to the occasions when the trance-personality felt\nitself to be simultaneously Phinuit and Mrs. Piper. An\ninteresting case will be found in Proceedings, Vol. XL,\npp. 309-316 (see especially p. 314), where Mr. C. H. Tout\ndescribes his experiences in falling into semi-trance and\nin this state involuntarily personating some one else while\npartly retaining his normal consciousness, so that he\nseemed to himself to be two persons at once.\nIt is not only in the likeness of the controls to hypnotic\npersonations that Mrs. Piper's trance resembles hypnotic\ntrances. The dream-like incoherence of the waking-stage\nwith its sudden breaks of memory, and the tendency both\nin waking-stage and trance proper to hallucination, are\nfeatures which may readily be observed in hypnotic trances\nin which different stages of consciousness occur ; and the\nrealisation by the hypnotised person of his own identity, as\nwith Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage, is what ordinarily\noccurs when no personation is suggested. Also the trance\ndream, if I may call it so, recurrent in its general outline,\nand the order of succession of consciousnesses manifested\nin the course of it, could doubtless be produced in a\nsuitable hypnotic subject by appropriate suggestion and a\nlittle education.\nIt is certain that such suggestion was present in Mrs.\nPiper's case and may therefore have operated. Mrs.\nPiper wills to go into trance with a definite idea,\u2014originally\n\f328 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [paet\nderived from her sittings with Mr. Cocke (see p. 9),\u2014that\nher own personality is to disappear and its place to be taken\nby various other spirits whose function is to converse with\nthe sitter, advise him, and put him into communication\nwith the spirit world. Accordingly, in a typical sitting of,\nsay, 1907, she conceives herself during the going-into-trance-\nstage as gradually withdrawing and consequently losing\nher awareness of the actual surroundings. When she con-\nceives herself as quite gone, a brief interval of deep sleep\noccurs during which no consciousness at all seems to be\npresent so far as external manifestation goes, but during\nwhich nevertheless there is reason to think that ideas may\nbe received through the senses by some element of con-\nsciousness, and may act suggestively in the subsequent\ntrance proper (see e.g. Chapter IV., p. 142). From the\ndeep sleep awakes a consciousness apparently conceiving\nMrs. Piper's spirit as absent and itself as another spirit\nwho is there for the purpose of conversing with the\nsitter. Who this other spirit is to be and also what\nhe is to begin by saying is sometimes foreshadowed in\nthe utterances and gestures of the going-into-trance-stage,\nas though it had been suggested beforehand,-\u2014and it is, of\ncourse, quite likely that the normal Mrs. Piper does some-\ntimes suggest it to herself consciously or subliminally as\nshe goes off. There is a similar relation between the ideas\nof the trance proper and of the waking-stage which succeeds\nthe deep sleep that follows the withdrawal of the controls.\nDuring this waking-stage the consciousness present again\nrealises itself as Mrs. Piper, who conceives herself as coming\nback to this world from the spirit world. In the latter she\nmeets personages of the trance proper, whose company she\nsometimes enjoys up to the moment when she feels her\nretiirn as complete, and fully realises herself as back in\nthe actual surroundings.\nThis succession of events corresponds with the ideas\nwith which the trance was entered upon, and there is an\nunderlying unity of plot in the story notwithstanding the\ndream-like incoherence of the waking-stage. Details suit-\nable to the occasion would naturally be suggested on any\nparticular day, and we can sometimes see in the records\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena. 329\nhow from time to time changes in the controls and other\nmodifications of the trance dream were apparently suggested\nby the sitters or by the desires of the trance consciousness\nitself.\nThe states of consciousness in trance and waking-stage\nare, as we have seen, very different. In the waking-stage\nwe have consciousness of her own identity together with\nunawareness of the actual surroundings ; in the trance\nproper no apparent consciousness of herself and complete\nand keen awareness of the sitter and surroundings ;\nduring\nthe waking-stage incoherence and instabnity with discon-\ntinuity of memory ;\nduring the continuance of the trance\nproper complete coherence and, notwithstanding changes\nof assumed personality, apparent stability. It is probable\nthat the direction of attention to the sitter and the need\nof carrying on a conversation satisfactory to him has a\nsteadying effect ; but there is also some reason to think that\n(as suggested in Chapter VIII., p. 311) the maintenance\nof stability and coherence sometimes involves an effort.\nThe evidence published by our Society seems to show\nthat dissociated states\u2014hypnosis, trance, automatic writing,\nordinary sleep\u2014are favourable to the emergence of tele-\npathic impressions, and such emergence may occur in any\nof the stages of Mrs. Piper's trance, other, of course, than\nthe deep sleep. But as we saw in Chapter VII., the transi-\ntion stage at the end of the trance proper, \" when Rector\ngoes out,\" which may perhaps be the deep sleep itself, seems\nmore favourable to the effective receipt of telepathic\nimpressions than the trance proper. It may be that the\neffort just spoken of, to remain coherent and to satisfy\nthe sitter, acts as a hindrance to telepathy. On the other\nhand, the Avaking-stage, if favourable to telepathy in one\nway, appears in another to hinder its manifestation, for\nwords and names telepathically learnt may be uttered in\nthat stage while the ideas to which they should be\nattached are through the dream-like incoherence turned into\nnonsense.\nI have been endeavouring to show the resemblances be-\ntween Mrs. Piper's trance and hypnosis as regards changes\nand divisions of consciousness. But what psychical pro-\n\f330 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [PAET\ncesses are involved in these changes and divisions, either\nin hypnosis, or in the Piper trance if it differs from hypnosis,\nwe do not know. We may perhaps usefully represent\nit to ourselves as some sort of shuffling and rearrange-\nment of centres of consciousness, interconnected, but to\nsome extent independent, with one of them sometimes suffi-\nciently dominant to keejD order, as it were, and secure the\nkind of stability exhibited in the trance proper. But how\nfar, if at all, such a representation has any true resemblance\nto the facts, our present state of knowledge does not enable\nus to say.\nTo sum up very briefly my own conclusion about Mrs.\nPiper's trance, I think it is probably a state of self-\ninduced hypnosis in which her hypnotic self personates\ndifferent characters either consciously and deliberately, or\nunconsciously and believing herself to be the person she\nrepresents, and sometimes probably in a state of conscious-\nness intermediate between the two. In the trance state\nher normal powers transcend in some directions those of\nher ordinary waking self, as is often the case in hypnosis.\nAnd further\u2014what makes her case of great importance\n\u2014\nshe can obtain, imperfectly and for the most part frag-\nmentarily, telepathic impressions. Or rather, as it would\nperhaps be more correct to say, such impressions are not\nonly received by her as the result of her own telejmthic\nactivity or that of other spirits\u2014spirits of the living or\nmay be of the dead\u2014but rise partially or completely into\nthe consciousness operating in the trance communications,\nand so are recognised.\nI have in attempting to expound and justify this theory\nand in discussing the facts on which it is based, used very\nfrequently such words as \" probably,\" \" perhaps,\" \" some-\ntimes.\" That is because it seems to me impossible at\npresent to prove any theory on the subject. Provisionally\nthe one I have put forward is what seems to me to fit the\ncomplicated facts of Mrs. Piper's case best. But it would\nbe rash in so elusive and difficult a subject to try to come\nto any final conclusion on this case alone. Much more study\nis required of hypnotic and other dissociated states in\ndifferent people, including of course cases of automatic\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Pipers Trance Phenomena. 331\nwriting produced while the normal consciousness is appa-\nrently in full operation, especially those in which there is\nthe same kind of evidence for supernormal powers as in\nMrs. Piper's. Such investigation might lead to an entire\nrevision of my interpretation of the relations of Mrs. Piper's\nstates of consciousness.\nIf my attempt to study the psychology of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance phenomena suggests any lines of observation or ex-\nperiment to be pursued in other cases, it will have served\na useful purpose.

It will be\nobserved that some of the symptoms in the semi-hypnosis\noccur in the waking-stage\u2014indistinct speech constantly, and\n\f334 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nautomatic imitation of speech and gesture occasionally (see\nChapter VI., p. 234, and Appendix to Chapter VI., p. 612).\nCurious to ascertain whether there were continuity between\nthe medium-trance and the ordinary hypnotic trance, I made\nsome observations ad hoc upon Mrs. P[iper]. My first two\nattempts to hypnotize her were unsuccessful. Between the\nsecond time and the third, I suggested to her \" control \" in\nthe medium-trance that he should make her a mesmeric\nsubject for me. He agreed. (A suggestion of this sort made\nby the operator in one hypnotic trance would probably have\nsome effect on the next.) She became partially hypnotized on\nthe third trial ; but the effect was so slight that I ascribe it\nrather to the effect of repetition than to the suggestion made.\nBy the fifth trial she had become a pretty good hypnotic\nsubject, as far as muscular phenomena and automatic imitations\nof speech and gesture go ; but I could not affect her con-\nsciousness, or otherwise get her beyond this point. Her\ncondition in this semi-hypnosis is very different from her\nmedium-trance. The latter is characterized by great muscular\nunrest, even her ears moving vigorously in a way impossible\nto her in her waking state. But in hypnosis her muscular\nrelaxation and weakness are extreme. She often makes several\nefforts to speak ere her voice becomes audible ; and to get a\nstrong contraction of the hand, for example, express mani-\npulation and suggestion must be practised. The automatic\nimitations I spoke of are in the first instance very weak,\nand only become strong after repetition. Her pupils contract\nin the medium-trance. Suggestions to the \" control \" that he\nshould make her recollect after the trance what she had been\nsaying were accepted, but had no result. In the hypnotic-\ntrance such a suggestion will often make the patient remember\nall that has happened.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 335\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER II.\nTheoeies of Controls as to their Relation to the\nBody and Spirit of the Medium.\nThe extracts from records of sittings of which this Appendix\nconsists are supplementary to those given in the text, and\nform an important part of the evidence on which statements\nin the text are based. In some cases they give the con-\ntext of quotations in the text. The arrangement is strictly\nchronological all through, and the six sections into which the\nAppendix is divided are marked by important divisions of\ntime. The chronological order has the disadvantage of\nmixing up the different topics dealt with in the chapter,\nso that in reading the Appendix through the reader would\nhave the feeling of continually jumping from one subject\nto another. On the other hand, topics could not be kept\napart without cutting up many of the extracts given. More-\nover, the chronological development is in itself of some\nimportance.\nRemarks in large print and those enclosed in { } are\nnotes or comments of my own.\nA.\nExtracts from Stenographic Reports of Five Sittings,\nMay 26\u2014June 30, 1888.\nThese are the sittings referred to by Hodgson (Proceed-\nings, Vol. VIII., pp. 2-3), as given gratuitously by Mrs.\nPiper, for the purpose of enabling him to find out what he\ncould from Phinuit in any way he chose, concerning his own\npersonality, his knowledge, his relations to Mrs. Piper, etc.\nHodgson used the results in his Report, and seems at one\ntime to have intended to publish rather full extracts, though,\nas he says, \" the results were decidedly unsatisfactory so\n\f336 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nfar as regards the receipt of any exact explanation.\" I\nagree with him, however, \" that in the task of estimating\nthe general character of the trance personality,\" \" certain\nportions of these accounts are worth reproducing.\" The\nportions bearing on Phinuit's theory of \" control \" are what\nare here quoted. In what follows, Ph. stands for Phinuit\nand S. for Hodgson or the stenographic reporter. The\nlatter was herself interested and had had a good many\nsittings with Mrs. Piper. The record does not distinguish\nbetween the two questioners, but no doubt in the great\nmajority of cases S. here stands for Hodgson.\n(May 26, 1888.)\n* * * *\nS.

Can't you explain how it would appear to me, supposing\nI investigated a medium's body for the purpose\nof ascertaining the difference in structure ?\nPh. You would see a very sensitive organism, you would see\na very large, peculiar, undeveloped brain ; what I\nmean to say, the brain is too large to be used by\nthe natural mortal mind of the medium.\nS. Do you mean there is a certain part of the brain which is\nused by the etherial organism and can be filled by\nthe etherial organism of the spirit ?\nPh. Certainly.\nS. The reason why all people are not mediumistic is because\nthey crowd out others and fill it all up ?\nPh. Yes.\nS. You are not likely to expect of a person that uses up\nevery bit of himself, to be mediumistic ?\nPh. That was never found in your country.\nNow you see when I come here, the medium passes into\nthe spirit, as it were. The medium's etherial organ-\nism goes through the spirit world, or various parts\nof the spirit world ; she wanders about like a spirit ;\nshe gropes about that way (putting out hands).\nJust when I get ready to come here, she goes out\nI drive her out. She takes my place, as it were, in\nthe spirit world.\n1\nThis passage is quoted in Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 9.\nY\n\f338 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nS. How does she appear to the spirits ?\nPh. Well, she looks strange to the different spirits and they\nlook strange to her probably.\nS. What characteristic does she exhibit that marks her off\nas still inhabiting a material organism ?\nPh. She looks darker. S. Like an evil spirit ?\nPh. Oh, not like an evil spirit, but not so shining, gleaming.\nS. Is it a matter of common knowledge that persons who\nlook like that have to go back to the body ?\nPh. Some of them do not understand it ;\nthey think it is\ncurious.\nS. The same as white people who inhabit a certain country,\nsuddenly see a black man ?\nPh. Yes.\nS. Is she conscious all the time that she must return ? Is\nshe like a lost bird ?\nPh. She goes round ; when I get ready to go out I leave the\nmedium's organism weak, in a certain sense ; then\nwhile her spirit is roaming about it has gathered\nstrength enough to put back into that what I have\nexhausted. She gathers up a certain amount of\nenergy. She is helped on by various spirits and\ngood spirits too. Then when I begin to leave the\nmedium, I get weak, have exhausted all the material\nenergy I could get from her, she begins to return\nand she gets nearer to me. I can actually some-\ntimes, when I am here, see the medium.\nS. How do you communicate with her ? How does she\nknow ?\nPh. Don't you see, I am leaving the organism.\nS. How does she know it ?\nPh. Because she lingers, in a certain sense, near me. At the\nsame time, your spirit mother comes here and tells\nme she is here, only I can tell her from the other\nspirit because she is a little darker.\nS. She comes and tells you you must go ?\nPh. Oh no. Her spirit would stay in the spirit forever and\nlive there if I should stay here too long, but I have\nonly a certain amount of strength given me and\nwhen I have exhausted that I have to go whether\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 339\nI like it or not, and she comes back, and she\nactually stands by me pulling on me to get me out,\nand then she gradually gets back again.\nS. Didn't she have great difficulty at first to get back ?\nPh. She was afraid of me I guess at first.\nS. I mean to get back again ?\nPh. Sometimes people have asked me what made me make\nthe medium suffer so. You know, sometimes she\nrealises the fact that I am getting here and is kind\nof afraid to let me come, for she is afraid she won't\nget back again, but I talk to her and tell her she\nwill get back all right, so she comes right back and\ntakes my place. Then when I have the medium's\norganism, I can feel sometimes. In the first place,\nthe medium's body, the hands, arms, head, feet,\u2014\nI\nitch tremendously\u2014they feel heavy to me, hard\nwork to get them round, and then I try to force\nenergy ; still they are heavy. Then I exert a great\ndeal of will power and I can do anything. (Stretches\nout hand.) Then again, I can see you ; I can see\nyour etherial ; I can see a fac-simile of yourself,\nbut I cannot see the material only as I touch you.\nI have a sense of feeling and can feel. I use the\nmedium's organism as my instrument, exactly as\nshe uses it. Then I hear with the medium's ears.\nSometimes I do not get so much control.\nS. To all intents and purposes you use the medium's organ-\nism precisely as you would if you were a human\nbeing ?\nPh. Exactly.\nS. How is it that you do not use the medium's eyes ?\nPh. I do use the medium's eyes.\nS. You told me the last time that you used them about\nthere (pointing to spot over the eyes).\nPh. Oh, I mean to say that I use the medium's brain ; I do\nnot need eyes.\nS. Could you use the eyes if you tried ? Have you ever\ntried ?\nPh. One time a gentleman in the body wanted me to open the\nmedium's eyes. They are closed now, are they ?\n\f340 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\nYes. Open them and look at me. Can't you open them ?\nYou have not any control over the muscles of the\neyelids ?\n(Feels of the eyes.) No, I think if I should practise I\nthink I could do it.\nWell now, try that and practise it, won't you ?\nI will try very soon.\nIs it because you have not got quite perfect control of\nthe organ ?\n(Trying to open them.) I do not see how you do it.\nYou open my eyes.\nThe eye-ball, the iris, appears to be turned right up\ntoward the nose, as though you were asleep, just as\nthough you were in an abnormal state.

How could she remember when I am here ? She goes\naway when I come.\nS. You told us last time that she wandered about in the\nspirit world ;\nwhy doesn't she remember ?\nPh. Because I take all the strength out of the medium's body,\nout of the brain.\nS. Doesn't she bring back strength with her ?\nPh. She does, but you know she comes right back where she\nleft off when I get here.\nS. I don't understand why she does not remember all the\nsame.\nPh. Remember what ? Remember me ?\nS. You talk with a sitter's friends, and you come into the\nmedium's body, and you tell us what they have told\nyou. Now, why can't I say to the medium, \" You\ns.\nPh.\ns.\nPh.\nS.\nPh.\ns.\nPh.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 341\ngo and talk with, my spirit friends and when you\ncome back tell me what they have said ?\n\"\nPh. Because I have exhausted the medium physically. I have\ntaken away all the light.\nS. When will she remember the experiences in the spirit\nworld ?\nPh. When I get her all used up, I guess. I have tried so\nmany times to make the medium remember. For\ninstance, when I go out I say to her, \" Do you\nthink what you have seen ;\nenjoy it ?\n\" Don't\nshe remember ?\nS. No, she never remembers anything. Why can't you make\nher remember ?\nPh. Because I paralyse the brain, I guess.\nS. Supposing the medium went out of her body. . . .\nPh. Well, you go and take a dose of ether and see how much\nyou remember when you get out of it.\nS. What happens when I take a dose of ether ?\nPh. Your brain gets numb.\ns. I can't remember what has been going on in that time\nbecause nothing does go on ?\nPh. Even so, but the power in the brain has been exhausted.\nAt the same time, your etherial goes out of yourself.\nWhen you go to sleep you dream.\nS. My etherial does not go out then ?\nPh. I tell you it does. S. Always ?\nPh. Yes. When you wake up you remember, because your\netherial was acting on your brain all the time.\nFor instance, when you go to sleep your etherial\nwanders about, but at the same time,\u2014your etherial\nsees your mother in another part of Australia, and\nthat is, your mind exercises that in your brain, puts\nthat single incident. That is a dream in your mind.\nWell, when you awake, your normal self again, and\nyour brain is no more being used as in a dream,\nthen you remember that you dreamed a certain\nthing. Well, sometimes it is true and sometimes it\nis not.\nS. What makes it not true, if dreams are always realities ?\nYou say that in dream life the etherial body always\n\f342 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\npasses out of the organism, and then the dreams\nrepresent real experiences ; is that what you mean ?\nThen follows a long discussion, very confused on Phinuit's\npart, about sleep. Hodgson wants to know the explana-\ntion of dreams, and what is the difference between a veridi-\ncal and a purely imaginary dream. Phinuit says the\n\" etherial \" always goes out of the organism in sleep and\napparently maintains that it sees the thoughts that the\nsleeper has had while awake, mixes them up and impresses\nthem upon the brain, but that it also sometimes really com-\nmunicates with distant people and impresses what it learns\non the brain. Hodgson also wants to know whether another\nspirit could take possession of the sleeping organism and\npermanently keep out its own spirit, and if not why not.\nPhinuit seems to reply that no spirit would wish to do so,\nand that it could not if it would, because the etherial is still\nholding on to the brain. Also that the sleeping body is\nas useless for purposes of communication as a dead body.\nMoreover, if a spirit did get possession during sleep or other-\nwise it could not remain long because the light and strength\nget exhausted.\nIt is perhaps noteworthy that Hodgson in this conversa-\ntion introduces the idea of a chain or cord, binding the\netherial body, when it goes out in sleep, to the physical,\n\u2014an idea which plays so large a part later on, especially\nin waking-stage utterances. Phinuit does not use the\nmetaphor himself here, though he does not exactly reject\nit. The following are the relevant passages :\nPh. I cannot come and control the medium when the medium\nis asleep. At the same time, it is still there ; I\ncannot use it to articulate, to speak to you. Then\nagain, you see the light is not sufficient ; it is not\nstrong enough, powerful enough, bright enough for\nme to follow it. Well, invariably, people that have\nnot the mediumistic light, of course there is nothing\nthere for the spirit to use. Your etherial is still\nholding on to the brain.\nS. How do I hold on to the brain ? How does my etherial\norganism hold on to my brain ?\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 343\nPh. What makes you move ? S. I desire to.\nPh. That is what I do when I leave the body ; I desire to\nkeep the soul (?) in my own possession. The brain\nand the etherial, which controls the physical, are\nlinked together and there is no use for a spirit to\ncome in there between.\nS. He cannot separate that from it ?\nPh. No sir, he cannot ; when you are in the sleep state your\nbrain is in a very different way ; it is in anything\nbut a natural state when you are asleep. For\ninstance, your brain is acting when you are awake ;\nyou are learning, studying, reading something ;\nwell,\nwhen your eyes are closed and that is gone from\nyour view, your brain is at rest.\nS. Now supposing here is a very strong etherial organism,\nwhich is spirit, and he watches the organism of a\nperson in the body, and he sees that person going\nto sleep. Gradually the organism of that person\nbecomes still, and he sees the etherial organism of\nthat person come out of the body and begin to\nwalk round, and he sees the chain of communication\nbetween that person and his own body. Very well,\nthat strong spirit thinks, \" I will have a good time ;\nI will murder that man,\" and he goes and breaks\nthe chain and { ? that } binds the etherial organism\nwith the mortal body, and he takes possession of\nthat body. Why can't that happen ?\nPh. Because the etherial and the brain are connected when\nyou are asleep. If your etherial should let go the\nbrain and the body would be dead.\ns. You mean to say that if this strong spirit broke that\nchain of communication, it would not do him any\ngood ?\nPh. I mean to say that you would pass out of the body\nfor ever.\nS. Do you mean that the body would be dead ?\nPh. I mean to say that when you sleep the nerves of the\nsystem, the entire system is dead, as it were ; the\netherial is there just the same ; it wanders about\n;\nfor instance, it is like a thought. Your etherial\n\f344 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\ncertainly controls the physical. When your brain is\nat rest the etherial dances about, wanders about\n;\nat the same time clings, as it were, to the brain,\nnever leaves the brain, and no spirit power is\nstrong enough to break it.\nS. It requires too much energy ?\nPh. No spirit is mean enough to want to kill anybody when\nthey are asleep. Common sense ought to teach you\nthat any of your spirit friends would not want to\ncome and use your organism when you are in the\nunconscious state ; to begin with, he has got no\nuse for it.\nS. But this is the idea ;\nsuppose this is Mr. A., and we will\nsay A. has a strong, healthy body, and we will say\nthat A. has killed B. in the mortal body. Very\nwell, we will say B. is an elderly man and A. is a\nyoung man. A. kills B. and takes possession of\nB.'s property. B. is a spirit then, isn't he ? Suppose\nthat B. is an evil spirit. B. Avatches A. going to\nsleep, and he sees A.'s etherial body beginning to\ndance round, as you described it just now, but still\nkeeping hold of his own brain. Then B. says \"A.\nhas murdered me ; he has driven my etherial\norganism out of my body and I cannot enjoy the\nmortal life, but all the same I shall have my\nrevenge now, and I will simply cut that thread off\nfrom A., and I will go into his body instead of A.,\nand I will enjoy myself in A.'s body.\" Do you\nunderstand ?\nPh. Yes.\nS. Do you mean to say that that is an impossible thing,\nthat for some reason or other B. cannot do that ?\nWhy can't he ?\nPh. Certainly he cannot. Although you are asleep, your body\nis at rest, but it is rest from sleep, from a natural\nsleep which is ordained. You are in a very different\ncondition from what you are when you are awake\n;\nyour etherial has ceased to act ; it is exhausted\n;\njowv etherial has not the power to grasp a thought,\nan impression, that is on your mind during the day.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 345\nYour spirit simply watched your physical while you\nare resting ; then it can in a certain way com-\nmunicate with the etherial, and when you are awake\nyou can remember it. But the spirit has no reason\nand no power to lift up the physical when it is\nasleep, and make use of it.\nS. Why can't B., who is a spirit, drag the etherial organism\nout of A.'s body, or if A.'s gets out, why can't B.\nkeep it out ? Is it a thing that you cannot under-\nstand yourself ; is it beyond you ?\nPh. Oh no, I know all about it ; I know I cannot control\nthe medium's organism when she is asleep. The\netherial is on the outside instead of in the inside.\nS. Now supposing you come to the medium, and you say\n\" Come out of that, come out of that,\" and she says\nno and you say \" Come out of that ; I will make\nyou come out,\" and then you make her come out\nand you say \" I am not going back here any more ;\nI will stop here in the body.\"\nPh. I cannot stop here in the medium's body ; when the light\nand the strength are exhausted, I have to go.\nS. So that if a man broke the thread of connection between\nA. and A.'s body, and if he could get into A.'s body\nfor a short time, then he would be there only just\nas long as this reservoir lasted, and then he would\nbe dead a second time ?\nPh. That is all.\nS. Is it in accordance with the laws of the universe that a\nspirit cannot break the chain that binds the living\norganism with the etherial body ?\nPh. Certainly. S. But you do not know why ?\nPh. Certainly, I do ; when you are asleep it is just the same\nas if it was dead. Now if it is dead how is the\nspirit going to take hold of it ?\nS. Because in the case I am supposing, I am supposing that\nthe spirit uses it just as the etherial is about to\nreturn to the body.\nPh. Your etherial still clings to the brain, but it leaves the\nother portion of the body. Then there is nothing, no\nspirit power can sever that from the brain.\n\f346 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pabt\nS. But why can't they ?\nPh. Why, because there is life there.\nS. I can sever an etherial body from the body.\nPh. Certainly, because you can take his life, but a spirit\ncannot do that.\nS. Why can't he ? I believe I have got an idea of the\nreason now myself. My idea is this, that the spirit\ncan act upon the etherial part of the bond con-\nnecting the etherial organism with the ordinary body,\nbut that part of that bond consists of more gross\nmatter which can only be acted upon by a person\nwho is on the material plane, and that therefore a\nperson who is still in the body can break that link,\nbut a spirit cannot.\nPh. But why can't he ?\nS. Because he cannot act upon that matter unless that\nmatter happens to be connected with a mediumistic\nperson. Is that right ?\nPh. Where does the life come in, the life of the brain ?\nAt this point Hodgson changes the subject, or at least\ntries to approach it from a different side, by asking if there\nis such a thing as murder in the spirit world.\nLater in the sitting the following occurs :\nS. Now tell us how it was that the medium first came to\ngo into this state, and who first controlled her ?\nWhat made her mediumistic ? Was there any\nevent which made her body mediumistic ?\nPh. Any event ? No.\nS. Has she always been mediumistic from childhood ?\nPh. It is born with you when you are put into the body, and\nchildren sometimes are controlled by spirits if their\nbrains are strong when they are very young, but if\nthey are not strong physically and mentally there is\nnot enough there for the spirit to control it, and\nnever will until it can handle it and handle it\nright.\nS. Now tell us the history of your own control and the\nother spirits that controlled her, etc.\nPh. Oh, there are several different spirits that I am not\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 347\nparticularly acquainted with. They call them a\nband of spirits, but they are called that in the body\nmore so than in the spirit. For instance, when I\nor any spirit finds that there is a medium, that is, a\nlight, every spirit that can will follow that fight to\nsee if they cannot handle it, use it. For instance,\nyou try to lift a stone and you are not strong\nenough to do it ;\nyour brother tries and some one\nelse tries, and finally there is some one strong\nenough to do it. That is the way I got here.\nS. Other spirits had tried before you ?\nPh. Only one or two. S. What others really succeeded ?\nPh. There was Loretta Ponchena, an Italian girl : then there\nwas,\u2014I don't know,\u2014Henry Longfellow, I believe.\nS. Who else ?\nPh. I don't remember ; it was the spirit of Mr. Longfellow,\njust the same.\nS. Was it the real spirit of the poet ? (Think the answer\nwas yes.)\nPh. Then there used to be a Mrs. Sarah Siddons.\nS. What did she do ? Ph. Oh, nothing.\nS. What sort of a person is she ?\nPh. I don't know ; I guess she used to be an actress ; I do\nnot know her very well.\nS. Who else ? \u2014Beethoven ?\nPh. Musical ? S. Yes.\nPh. No. S. Did Admiral Blake come ?\nPh. No, never heard the name before. S. Commodore Wiley ?\nPh. No, never heard the name. S. Who came ?\nPh. Chief Justice Marshall ; that is all.\nS. Did you ever know any naval officer that came ?\nPh. Commodore Vanderbilt ; he was not a naval officer\n;\nCommodore is his name. He is a decent sort of\nfellow ; nice old fellow, but he is profane ; used to\nswear like a Turk.\nS. None of those could manage the medium's body as well\nas you %\nPh. No. S. Who is the leader of this band of spirits ?\nPh. There is no leader at all.\nS. That is what the mortals call it.\n\f348 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nPh. Certainly ; it is a various number of people that try to\nuse the medium's organism.\n{June 16, 1888.)\n4 % % $\nS. Have I got any light about my brain ?\nPh. Certainly, a great deal. S. Luminosity ?\nPh. Yes. S. What impressions am I subject to ?\nPh. I do not know as I can illustrate that to you clearly\nbut I will try. If you had a friend that was ill\nyou would know it, you would feel impressed, but\nit would be done through the spiritual influence.\nDo you call that one mind acting on another ?\nS. Yes, we call that telepathy.\nPh. Well, I tell you it is not at all. You get an impression\nthrough some disembodied spirit, or it may be a\nvery powerful action of your own etherial.\nS. That is what I think it is likely ; tell me how I can act\nin that case. You mean it is the action of me on\nthe other person, that my etherial really takes\ncognizance of what is going on ?\nPh. Oui, that is the idea. I can tell those that are in\nsympathy with me when I first see them. I can\nlook right through them. They do not believe I\nam here. And another thing I go on talking to\nthem ;\nthey sit perfectly indifferent ; if they would\nput some feeling and some sympathy and give them-\nselves up in earnestness, and were desirous of getting\nsomething from the spiritual world, it is an un-\nmistakable fact that they will get it every time,\nand I will guarantee it. But even that lady that is\ndreadfully sad ; now she has got feeling, she is sad\nand sorrowful in the material, but she has got no\nsincerity in really calling up her friends, because\nshe thinks it is impossible, and it is just as hard to\nbreak through that ice as it is for you to break\nan iron. I will guarantee that if you will bring a\nsympathetic lady, a lady that is anxious to get\nsomething and will put her soul and heart into it,\nher soul particularly, I will guarantee you that if\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 349\nshe has got friends in the spirit I can talk with\nthem. Now for instance, Ella Brown; you take that\nname ; that name will come to me and that\nperson will say she is Ella Brown, but that friend\ndoes not start up and be glad to see her, but\nsimply sits cool and quiet and does not say whether\nshe knows Ella Brown or not.\n* * *\nSometimes, don't you see, they won't listen to me. They\nput themselves so hard and stern and so within\nthemselves, no feeling, no sympathy, no belief, no\nnothing, and it is just as impossible for their friends\nto reach them, because I am so sensitive. For\ninstance, I can talk, criticise, lecture from one\nyear's end to the other, generally speaking ; at the\nsame time you can say a thing to me which makes\nme deucedly weak, in a cold, hard, stern, unsympa-\nthetic, unkind tone. But I will guarantee that if\na lady or gentleman comes to me with sincerity,\nand anxious for me to tell them something, I will\nguarantee to tell them what they want to know.\nAnd I do not care if I get here forty times. You\nmay do whatever you have a mind to. Do as\nanother gentleman did ; he got me to come here\nand he went and got a cloth bandage and tied it\nall over my head. Well, you can do the same if\nyou like.\nS. To see if you can see anything ?\nPh. No, no ; then bring in your friend, your American friend,\nand if they are sympathetic I will guarantee to tell\nthem their friends. You can do all you like to me ;\nI do not care.\n* * * *\n{Here were made the experiments in localising pinches,\nand in smelling and taste, referred to in Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII., p. 5.}\n* * * *\nS. That sense of effort, that feeling of struggle, does that lie\nin the connection between the etherial organism and\nthe ordinary organism 1\n\f350 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nPh. You see I control the medium.\nS. But supposing another spirit was looking on at your\nfeeling of effort, what would they see ? What does\nthe effort consist of ?\nPh. I make an effort because I have the use of the medium's\nhands.\nS. Is that effort in order to make your etherial catch hold\nof the medium's physical ?\nPh. Oui, you know I have got hold of it all the time.\nS. If that connection were more perfect the effort would not\nbe so great ?\nPh. No.\nS. The more imperfect the connection is, the greater the\neffort is ?\nPh. Certainly. The medium is matter and I am etherial.\nS. What sort of shape has the etherial organism ?\nPh. Fac-simile of the one in the body, mouth, nose and eyes.\nS. What is the etherial mouth for ?\nPh. Supposing that I should come to you without the medium,\nhow do you suppose I could talk to you ? If I had\nnot any mouth I could not whisper, I could not talk\nto you.\nS. But there are a great many people who do not come to us\nwith their mouths ?\nPh. That is very true.\nS. Then you can hear us without any ears, can't you ?\nPh. Certainly ;\noh, I have got etherial ears.\nS. You can hear without etherial ears ?\nPh. Certainly.\nS. What is your nose for ? You do not go snuffing about\nin your etherial body ?\nPh. Oh no. S. Then what is the good of it ?\nPh. The etherial retains that shape because it has had that\nshape in the body. You must remember I am like\na little boy, like learning my lessons over again. Do\nyou know, I do not believe there is a spirit comes\nback to earth through any medium that is stronger\nor more learned about different things than I am.\nI do not believe you will even find a spirit that is\nstronger to bring back friends than I am. I say\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 351\nthat because I have seen so many spirits that really\nhave been back to earth, and I have never found\none that said that they could use the medium, and\nI do not say this because I am conceited ; I tell\nyou because it is the actual truth. I have talked\nwith a good many of them and they say they\ncannot use the medium to hear. But I am not a\nvery good hand to lecture, I am not a very good\nhand to explain, unless you put the question very\nquietly, slowly, and very simply to me.

The account of it\nwas taken down from Mrs. Piper's lips by Miss Lucy\nEdmunds, Dr. Hodgson's assistant, on February 24, 1896,\nand signed by Mrs. Piper. It is of interest, as showing a\nresemblance between the dream ideas and those of the\ntrance imagery (compare, e.g. below, June 3, 1903, p.\n422 ; December 14, 1904, p. 431 ; March 5, 1897, p. 494 ;\nMarch 30, 1897, p. 499).\nOn two occasions, when recovering from an anaes-\nthetic, Mrs. Piper had experiences suggestive of her trance\nlife. The first occasion was on March 14, 1893, and\nHodgson's description of it is quoted on p. 217. The\nsecond occasion was in 1901, and the description will be\nfound in the Appendix to Chapter VI., p. 579. It\nresembled in many respects a waking-stage.\nMassachusetts General Hospital, February 24, 1896.\nMrs. Piper gives an account (with frequent pauses and rests)\nof a vision which she had on the night of Saturday, February 22\n[L. E. taking notes].\n[Mrs. Piper explained that her recollection of the vision was\nbecoming dim ; that she could have given a better account\nhad she told it to Dr. Hodgson on the day after it happened.\nTo-day it was an effort to remember, and she could only give\na somewhat fragmentary account.]\nOn Saturday night I went to sleep and at about one o'clock\n-\n\u2014I think it was one because I awoke soon after\u2014I had a\ndream or vision. The first experience I had was as though I\nwas being raised from my bed while still in my body, that is\nto all intents and purposes I was in my body. Then I felt\na strong hand clasping my arm on the left ; it seemed like\nthe hand of a man. On my right I was being lifted apparently\nwithout any contact.\n\f378 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nI saw a man with long wavy hair and stoop-over shoulders.\nI think it was Phinuit. I saw George {i.e. G. P.} 1\nalso. It\nwas he who seemed to be holding me up.\nThen I heard voices saying, \" Come, we wish to take you\nwith us ; we wish to give you a rest from your tired body,\"\nand without further sound I was raised. There was a break\nbetween my hearing the voices and my being lifted or raised\nabove my bed. I was conscious of not being on my bed.\nThen I was carried in space until we came to a delicate blue\ndrapery hanging in folds as though blowing in the breeze.\nIt seemed to be immovable until we passed through when it\nparted, and I was not conscious of there being any sides to it\n;\nI then heard a rustling sound as of people approaching, but I\ndidn't hear the footsteps. It was like the rustling of garments,\nand then I saw a light as though all space\u2014the whole earth\nwas aglow\u2014such a light !\n\u2014I never saw anything like it before.\nThen I heard children's voices as though singing, and a\nchorus like young ladies' voices ; I was surrounded by them ;\nthey were everywhere and they then seemed to form a ring\naround me. They were all very beautiful, and passing around\nfrom one to the other was what seemed to be a silken banner\nor sash which they seemed to be holding. It was soft and\nsilky and entwined about with flowers, and it was held from\none to the other so that the silken band helped to form a\nring. They had beautifully sandalled feet. I heard the rustling\nof their garments (something like the rustling of tissue paper)\n\u2014loose, Greek, flowing garments. They danced about as they\nformed the ring ; then the ring seemed to separate and they\ndispersed. I felt it was a sort of greeting to me as it were,\nthat is, the ring and their dancing and singing.\nWe passed on along a smooth walk hedged on either side\nwith flowers. We came to pillars\u2014they looked like real\npillars, but were not solid-looking, almost transparent. The\npillars seemed to be an entrance to what seemed to be a\n1\nHow much Mrs. Piper in her normal state knew about G.

She had in\n1892 had visions of him in the waking-stage and afterwards, when\nnormal or nearly so, had recognised photographs of him.

It seemed as though one whole side of the\nbuilding was open, the pillars forming the entrance. Inside\nthe building as we passed, I saw a long bench or table around\nwhich many men were writing ;\nthey were each one sitting\nback one to the other and did not seem to pay any attention\nto me. It seemed as though some sort of educational work\nwas being carried on. I looked into their faces as we passed\nthe building ; their faces were smooth and devoid of all\nwrinkles,\u2014they had very clear complexions.\nI suddenly saw an elderly gentleman. He was gray-haired\nand had bluish-gray eyes, heavy moustache\u2014no beard\u2014dis-\ntinguished looking,\u2014face rather small. He said he was not\nlame now ; he took hold of his robe and began to dance,\nsaying, \" See, I am not lame now.\" 1\nA young lady was with\nhim ; she was very lovely. She had dark hair combed back\naway from her forehead, pompadour fashion\u2014large eyes and\nintelligent, sweet face.\nThen I saw an elderly gentleman with hair white and a full\nwhite beard-\u2014clear eyes\u2014intelligent\u2014large distinguished nose.\nHe resembled Mr. Hodgson, but Mr. Hodgson has more dreamy\nand spiritual expression about the eyes. I said to Mr. Hodg-\nson : \"I could take that gentleman to be your father.\"\nI also saw a dark-complexioned gentleman with pointed\nbeard\u2014very intelligent looking\u2014but rather small. He ap-\nproached George. I saw them shake hands and heard them\nsay, \" Hulloa, old fellow,\" or something of the kind. They\ndiscussed, but I could not hear what they were discussing. All\nseemed so happy : I also saw an aunt of mine who died of\ncancer and also a cousin who died of consumption. I got\nalong so easily and did not seem to walk, but made progress\nwithout stepping\u2014I stood erect.\nI saw two of Mrs. Thaw's children. I was conscious that\nthey were hers but did not see Mrs. Thaw's mother.\nA thin-faced young man came to me who was anxious about\na friend of his ; he wanted information which I could not\ngive him. He was about 30 or 35. He may have been Dr.\nThaw's brother. He was perhaps looking for his wife\u2014This\nwas my impression.\n1\nMost of, if not all, these specifically described persons were, I think,\nfriends of sitters and had previously figured in Mrs. Piper's trances\n\f380 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nI think I saw Mr. D. (L. E. \" Did you know Mr. D. ? \")\nYes, I saw him once or twice at Mrs. D.'s house.\nI saw Mrs. S.'s husband and her son and her aunt, and\nshe seemed to be doing something with her hands as though\nshe were picking something to pieces. I seemed to see every-\none I had ever known who has died.\nI saw a very tall gentleman ; he was extremely tall. They\ncalled him Charles.\nAs I was beginning to see a great number of people ap-\nproaching, I felt as though some one had stabbed me in the\nback. When I was first being taken up, I seemed to follow\na streak of light ; it seemed to be a ray of light, similar to\na ray of light from the sun through a knot hole, and we\nfollowed that light. When I felt the stab, I felt that the\nsame light was behind me, and it seemed to be a cord or\nstring but nothing tangible, and it seemed to be the same ray\nof light which led me off away from this sphere. As these\npeople approached me, some one seemed to be pulling on the\ncord, though I could not say it was a cord\u2014it looked like a\nlight and felt like cord. Some one kept pulling and I was\nbeing lowered and taken from my feet\u2014(I had been standing\nerect)\u2014to a position of lying down, and then I awoke and I\nhad a feeling that I had not been asleep but had been awake\nand had had this experience while awake\u2014and yet my body\nwas so heavy I could not move\u2014my body seemed so dark\nand heavy as though it did not belong to me ; I had to\nstruggle for breath. I felt depressed to think that I had got\nback. I could not move a limb at first.\nL. E. Piper.\nAs regards the stab mentioned in this record, compare\nthe waking-stage of November 29, 1905, when Mrs. Piper said :\nMrs. P. Isn't that awful. Coming down on the cord ? I got\nstabbed, and a pain in my heart.\nSitter. Who stabbed you ?\nMrs. P. Cord stabbed me. {Hodgson notes : Detachment of\netherial cord ?\n}\nSitter. Well tell us about it.\nMrs. P. Well I don't know ... I slid down ... I slid on it.\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 381\nOn May 24, 1905, the back is spoken of in the waking-\nstage as the point of attachment of the cord.\nSitter.

I\nslid down on it before I [they ?] went out.\nOn other occasions the heart or the stomach are spoken\nof as the points of attachment of the cord. Thus, in the\nwaking-stage of July 4, 1904, Mrs. Piper says, \" Rector\ntook a cord out of my stomach,\" (Appendix to Chapter\nVI., p. 593 ), and in the sitting of June 3, 1903, the com-\nmunicator says (p. 424), \"the spirit of the medium passes\nout on a cord which is attached to the heart or solar\nplexus I should say \" (see Chapter II., pp. 71-74, for a\ndiscussion of the cord).\nE.\nExtracts from Sittings, October, 1896, to June, 1897.\nThis period includes a number of sittings chiefly occupied\nwith questioning the Imperator Band as to the process of\ncontrolling, etc., as seen from their side.

Tell me more about the atmospheric conditions.\nW. S. I think that I have done so upon other occasions sir,\nand were you the gentleman to whom I gave them ?\nW. R. N. Not to me, Sir Walter, but to a friend of mine. I have\nread what you said, and I think you did not say any-\nthing of the atmosphere.\nW. S. Well, pardon me sir, I will then. The planet, as we\nsee it materially is rather cold. For instance, there\nare icebergs and many of them on this planet i.e. on\nsome parts of it ; in others it is warmer and enough\nso to produce vegetation.

You\nseem choked, and yet you ask me to go on. Well,\nnow we wish to pass through this fog of seemingly\nsmoke, fire, electricity, as Mr. Pelham terms it. I\nborrowed the phrase sir, and now we begin to reach\nthe planet Jupiter. We pass around the surface peep-\ning into it . . . onto it . . . and we see nothing of\nany importance except the continual sparks, so called,\nwhich conglomerate together and as yet are in a very\nunsettled state\nW. R. N. Take me further.\nW. S. This all seems to us strange and interesting. We see\nall in one mass a conglomeration of atmospheres which\nwhen settled in one body looks like a planet.\nW. R. N, Then Jupiter is not solid ?\nW. S. Not at all solid.\nW. R. N. Take me elsewhere, especially where there is life.\nW. S. What is the general idea of Jupiter on your planet sir 1\nW. R. N. I know little astronomy, Sir Walter, but I think Jupiter\nis believed to be a red hot solid surrounded by dense\nclouds\nW. S. But it is not at all solid as we can pass through it.\nW. R. N.

You had species in mind, had you not ?\nW. S. species, yes sir, this was exactly the expression which\nI wish to express or use\u2014their plumage is to you\nsomething magnificent and indescribable.

You mean then that Venus is passing through a stage\nanalogous to the carboniferous era on the earth ?\nW. S. I do, only it is more perfect and real at this stage.\nBirds, insects and flowers grow in this atmosphere\nonly when the time comes for the flowers to decay\nthey simply droop, wither and fall, then immediately\nothers spring up and fill their places.

Yes, sir, but let me say sir that before I left you I found\nout afterward that I had taken you through the\nplanet, viz. sun and that we had followed it all the\nway to the earth. Well sir we were beginning to see\nmonkeys, don't you recall ?\nW. R. N. Yes, and this I could not understand and meant to ask\nyou.\nW. S. No you do not understand my idea [The left hand\nbegins to gesticulate rapidly,\u2014I think it was trying\nto use the deaf-mute language] We went to the sun\nand experienced heat. Well then we found it un-\nbearably hot.\nW. R. N. Won't you tell that other spirit to go ?\nW. S. He is going sir. Then sir. Well then we began to\nfollow its light as far as the tropic of Capricorn, when\nwe reached the earth of course, here we saw the\nmonkeys flying in and out of sand caves. There I\nbegan to lose my grasp on the light.\nW. R, N. May I ask a question ? W. S. Yes sir.\nW R. N. Is the sun a mass of incandescent vapor or does it con-\ntain a solid centre ?\nW. S. It is simply as a planet a mass of heat and lava.\nW. R. N. What are the sun spots ?\nW- S. This is the shadow of the earth sir.\nW. R. N. You are thinking of eclipses. I understand this, but\nI mean the black spots sometimes seen on the sun ?\nW. S. Oh I beg pardon sir, I did not understand your\nquestion, thoughts,\nW. R. N. I beg your pardon.\nW. S.

What definition do they give to the word, sir ?\nW. R. N. A canal is a large trench or ditch, cut that water may\n\f444 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nflow through it. These marks are supposed to be\nsomething of the kind.\nW. S. On Mars and discernible from earth ? Well they are\nnot openings at [all] sir, but are reflections caused\nby certain lights from the sun sir which brings to\nthe eye a dim aspect which looks like straight lines\nyet they are the peaks and shadows of the moun-\ntainous region in the planet Mars and can only be\nseen under certain conditions of light from the\nsun.\nW. R. N. Let us go on to Saturn and then tell me of the destiny\nof the human spirit.\nW. S. Yes sir, delighted, this is as much a pleasure to me as\nto yourself sir, as to you. Remember we were\nfollowing the sun and we finally came to earth because\nmore particularly of exhaustion. Well do you under-\nstand now that we do not find animal or vegetable\nlife in the sun.\nW. R. N. I am glad to hear that, for it troubled us.\nW. S. Oh you could not have thought that I wished to con-\nvey the idea that there were actually monkeys living\nin the sun, sir.\nW. R. N.

H. Well, his prophecies are exceedingly improbable. At first\nit looked as if he meant that there would be a great\nEuropean war, but it appeared that he meant only\nthat America would go to war with Spain and Turkey.\nSpain and Turkey are small powers any way. And\nwhile this looks improbable, the only thing that we\ncan judge him by is the positive statement that he\nmade that he was Imperator, and with the cross-\nmark attached. This being wrong, what value can\nbe attributed to his prophecy ?\nG. P. Yes, but I would not question so difficult a problem. Let\nit come as it will, H.

The evidence for identity and spirit-com-\nmunication all comes on your shoulders. Apart from\nwhat you have done, the evidence seems to me to be\nentirely inadequate.

He says that was a secret which he would never\nmake known to any one on earth, and always said\nthat the world should never know his secret, yet when\nI beg of him to tell me and explain the importance\nof his telling me, he then takes this course, and\nI do not know who his friends were, in earth or\nout.\nR H.

In other words, every person whom he\nhas ever known dashes through his mind, and then\nthere is no use in trying to hold him here.\nR. H. And we get nothing but lies and swindles.\nG. P.

No mortal mind, as I have many\ntimes said before, can ever realize it until they have\nbecome spiritual beings.\nJust his playing brought forth all this beautiful chorus.\nThere never was anything like it, as I thought.

She bowed she\naddressed me with a smile and whispered \" listen.\"\nWell, first I will describe in part her appearance.\nShe was the most saintlike looking creature I had\never seen, the most beautiful woman, as I thought.\nHer eyes were aglow with light. Her voice like the\nsoft and mellow sound of a silvery lute. This was\nwhen she addressed me. She was slight of stature,\nlarge eyes, oval face, more of the Greek, of which\nI had fancied in my mortal mind . . . Yes, but\nmy fancies were like a hideous nightmare in com-\nparison with the real beauty of the face.\nShe then smiled and began to sing. Oh such a\nheavenly sound I had never even had the faintest\nidea of. It is simply impossible for me to describe\nit. I could never do it. Analogy there is none.\nBut she sang ... to me, and the song was of spirit-\nlife in a state of perfection. I will ere long give\nyou some idea of the nature of the song.\nR. H. You mean the words.\nG. E. Yes. I hope I will be able to make you understand it.\nWhen she had nearly finished her song, as in the\ncase of Rubinstein's playing, she was accompanied\nby a chorus of voices, but unlike R ,\nthey were\nyoung ladies instead of birds.

I said as soon as I col-\nlected myself and my thoughts sufficiently to\nrealize who and what I was ;\nwell, this is Heaven\nin reality. I then wondered why I had not gone\nbefore.

No, he is justified in feeling as he does. Yet I know\nthat he does not understand just what did take\nplace with us.

You remember\nthat you did succeed in giving some very clear\nstatements some time ago. And the important\n[lesson] to be derived from these recent circum-\nstances seems to me to be this. I frequently\nurged this upon the old control here Phinuit, and\nalso upon my friend Pelham. And there seems to be\na curious inability among all of you, to discriminate\nbetween what possibly goes on in the subliminal,\nand what goes on in the normal consciousness which\nwe know, or our full material world. Statements\nhave frequently been made in the past which seem\nexplicable only on the supposition you cannot\ndistinguish, or at least, cannot with any certainty\n\f512 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ndistinguish, between the subliminal and the ordinary.\nDo you understand clearly ?\nG. E. Yes. I think I do perfectly, but I found when I was\nspeaking there, there was a constant interrupting\nstream of thought, for which I could not account.\nNow, friend, no one understands this better than I\ndo, and in replying I would ask to have him\naccept the possibility of my being present, only\nthis,\u2014and you will both one day know for a\ncertainty that what I have said and done was not\nfalse.\nR. H. George Eliot.\nG. E. Yes, my friend, I hear you.\nR. H. Of course the question from the evidential point of\nview is\u2014What proof is there that any supernormal\nbeings of any kind are communicating through\nthis so-called light. Among the answers that might\nbe given is that there are some intelligences which\nare deceivers, pretending to be George Eliot, Rector,\netc., and of course if I were convinced that you\nand the others were consciously trying to mislead\nme, I naturally would not place any reliance upon\nyou. But taking your statements exactly for\nwhat you offer them, regarding you as George\nEliot and K P as K F , and so\non : it is of course clear that however pure and lofty\nand sincere in every way in your desires to help\nhumanity and Myers and myself as among the\nmeans and so on,\u2014it is, I say, clear that there\nare some regions where it is very difficult for you\nto see clearly yourselves just what transpires, and it\ntherefore follows that I cannot be certain of the\nstatements that you make, although recognizing\nyour profound sincerity and goodness and earnest-\nness and sacrifice. Is this clear ?\nG. E. Yes, perfectly. [An arrival apparently here, probably\nImperator]\nR. H.

[pakt\nWaking-stage.\n[Mrs. Piper was a long time coming to, and there was\nsome anxiety about her breathing. We had Alta\n{Miss Piper} in out of the garden, and fully a\nquarter of an hour elapsed before the waking-stage\nbegan. Mrs. Piper had had an idea of bringing a\nbottle of eau de Cologne with her, and this was\nnow brought into use on a handkerchief ; it cer-\ntainly seemed to revive her, causing her to take\ndeep breaths, whereas there had been long intervals\nwithout any breathing at all.\nPresently the waking-stage began, and she waved her\nhand and said :]\nThere's Mabel.\nI wanted to speak but I couldn't. God bless you,\nyou dear old thing. I love you always\u2014always\nWe shall meet again. By bye.\nI brought her Lodge I want you to know who she\nis. I'm Dick.\n[O. J.

Dr.\nHall used no instruments except the esthesiometer and\nalgometer (to test sensitiveness), and these were used on\nthe hand. By head, however, the Hodgson control prob-\nably meant hand, as he was pleased to call the hand his\nhead. The experiments in sensitiveness were not objected\nto by the control at the time, nor apparently by the normal\nMrs. Piper later, after they were explained to her. But\nthey produced temporarily unpleasant after-effects about\nwhich, before they were explained, her daughter wrote in\nsome distress. Dr. Tanner writes, summarising Miss\nPiper's complaints (Studies in Spiritism, p. 246) :\n\" It\nappears that some time after the sitting red spots appeared\non Mrs. Piper's palm, and her index finger was numb for\ntwo or three days, the red spots being the after-effects of\nthe esthesiometer pressure, and the numbness probably\ndue to the pain-pressure experiments. Her lower lip was\nalso blistered from the camphor used.\" It seems absurd\nto suppose that temporary physical effects such as these\nshould permanently affect Mrs. Piper's mediumistic powers.\nIt is much more likely that, if Dr. Hall is responsible at\nall for the failure of her powers, it was the psychological\neffect of his deceiving the trance personality that did the\nharm (see above, Chapter I., p. 13). But I think the\nfailure had been gradually coming on, and would have\noccurred in any case.\n\f518 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV.\nSome Passages about Speaking by Thought.

There is a misapprehension by S2\njust\nbelow in connection with Rector's initial R. She\napparently interpreted this as the next letter of the\nname, and perhaps said \" then R.\" Rector repeats\n\" then R \" and understands the mistake she is\nmaking and tries to explain it to her, \"it is I\nwho is saying R.\" But she fails to understand,\nand thinks that the name MOORE is given.\n\u2014\nR. H., March 8, 1903.]\nRegarding Hodgson's note, it seems to me more natural\nto suppose that it was the communicator (through Rector)\nwho said, \" then R ... it is I who is saying R,\" and that\nthe point of the remark was that he did not wish the R to\nbe taken for Rector's signature.\nIt is interesting that in the going into trance stage\nthe next day, March 4, when the sitters of March 3 were not\npresent, Mrs. Piper said the name Moody in an uncaught\ncontext as follows :\nMrs. Piper. * * * [Not caught] * Mr. Moody * and * * *\nR. H. Mr. who ? Mrs. Piper. Mr. Moody *\nR. H. Mr. Moody what ? Mrs. Piper. * * * [Not caught.]\nMoody put in an appearance as communicator later in the\nsitting, Rector introducing him by \" Moody wishes to speak\nto you,\" but what he said was incorrect. I have quoted\nthese extracts as illustrating several points : (1) the \" hear-\ning \" of the sitter by the communicator ; (2) Hodgson's\nacceptance of the view that the control actually (not meta-\nphorically) \" hears \" the communicator, and is therefore\nliable to auditory mistakes\n\u2014\nW for double 0 ; (3) the mode\nof fishing for a name in a writing sitting. Observe the re-\npeated request to the sitter to speak the letters after Rector,\nwhich would, of course, help him to know if they were right\nor wrong and give him chances of^correcting them ; (4) the\n1\nMoody would not have been appropriate in either place where Music\ncame.\n\f532 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nemergence of the correct name first in the going into trance\nstage, which is unusual. We cannot regard the correct\ngiving of the name the next day as necessarily more than\na guess, considering the limited number of names beginning\nwith MOO, and that Moore had been tried and rejected.\nBut whether arrived at by telepathy or guessing, it is im-\nportant and probably significant, from the psychological\npoint of view, that what the control failed to get at on\nMarch 3 should on March 4 have reached both the waking-\nstage consciousness of Mrs. Piper and the control.\nSitter:\non March 3 and 4, 1903, was the same as on\nDecember 19, 1898, when Rector nearly got dismissed for\nhis bad management of a new communicator (see Chapter\nIII., pp. 108-109), and also the same as on November 15, and\nDecember 18 and 19, 1905, when a correct name came out\nfirst in the waking-stage (see Appendix to Chapter VI.).\nShe and a friend had a good many other sittings.

Was this an instance of his own alleged difficulty\nin catching words because of his long absence from earth ?\n(see p. 167) ; (3) the cramping or perturbation of the\nhand when the communicator changes and when a point\nis grasped (see p. 192).\nExamples of Communicators almost certainly False.\nGeneral Comment by Mrs. E. on sittings of December 3, 10, and\n17, 1902. Dated December 20, 1902.\nOnly one who knows the facts can appreciate how thoroughly\nthese alleged communications ring false. I freely made suggestions\nwhich in every case were adopted by the communicator with\na claim of full recollection and understanding ;\nyet the re-\nsponses, while appropriate to the general situation, lacked\nevery shred of individuality, and miscarried whenever the\nleast additional statement was ventured in the response.\nMost of my suggestions were reintroduced, at one time or\nanother, by the communicator, as original matter,\u2014in some\ncases as evidence of identity. But in every case there was a\nlack of knowledge of the context that defeated the attempted\nallusion. On the third sitting I asked leading questions which\nwere calculated to mislead ; and in every case the communi-\ncator fell into the trap, with a result that would have been\nludicrous had it not been so disgusting.\nWhile I gave a good many suggestions purposely, I gave\nsome by accident and without realizing that I had done so\nuntil long afterward. For instance, the word Pet, page 51,\n\f534, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\noriginal document, of December 3rd Sitting, I must have read\nas Pern, at the time, as it was with difficulty that Mr.\nHodgson persuaded me, in going over the original writing,\nthat the T was not an M. But by commenting on it as M.,\nas I think I must have done, I gave away a private name\nwhich at the time greatly startled me. At the time I believed\nthat this name proved thought-transference, if nothing more.\nBut I now see that it simply means that the communicator\nwas quick to catch up my suggestion and adopt it as if\noriginal.\nIf the communicators had been fragmentary and incoherent\nin his (or her) utterances, I should have considered the evi-\ndence inconclusive, and should have assumed it to be possible\nthat people were speaking across ^the grave who could not\nmake themselves articulate. As it is, I am convinced that\nsome intelligence was impersonating, deliberately and with\nconsiderable ingenuity, and yet on the whole doing it so ill\nthat the deception is proved beyond a peradventure.\nG. P., by the way, was as signal a failure as the other\nalleged speakers in saying a single word that smacked of in-\ndividuality, or met the situation. He undertakes to be a\ntrained communicator, yet he was as helpless as the novices\nin saying anything to show any one's identity.\nTo attribute the inappropriateness of the communications\nto a lack of full consciousness in the communicators seems to\nme to simply torture the evidence. It is incredible to me that\nany one could make this claim who has any knowledge of\nthe persons who it was alleged were speaking.\nE. G. E.\nMrs. E. had told the controls at the end of her last sitting\nwhat she thought of the communications, and accordingly\nat Hodgson's next sitting (December 24, 1902) Rector\nintroduced the subject, and the following conversation\ngives the views put forward by him :\nR. We feel sad because Mr. E. could not realize how to\nexpress himself better, but it may be the case\noccasionally unavoidably . . . unavoidably ... as we\ncannot do for every mortal alike.\n* * * *\n\ftxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.\u2014Appendix. 535\nShe will not be comforted friend ?\nR. H. She feels I think quite sure that what came is\nj\nthe\nmanifestation of some false deceiving intelligence\npretending to be her husband and showing, as she\nbelieves, to her conclusively that it is not, using\nher suggestions and trying to trick her into the\nbelief that it is her husband.\nR, Sad the thought for any mortal to maintain. We\nknow that Mr. E. and none other was present but\nhe could not be made to U.D. the conditions of\nspeech, and what we required of him. He in other\nwords is dreaming and only half conscious of her\npresence. But so far as deceiving spirits are con-\ncerned we can truly say there are none such repre-\nsented here. No matter how vague and incoherent\nthe messages may appear * * * Some time when thou\nart to meet us alone we would ask thee to give us some\narticle of his that we may see what help we may\nbe able to give him * * * He can be awakened to\nrealize what is desired of him without relapsing\ninto a state of coma whilst attempting to speak.\nTherefore we wait his coming with patience and\nfaith in his being able to speak clearly. +.\nHave we ever deceived thee friend ?\nR. H. No. I understand, I think, the situation clearly, but\nof course I know little about the states of mind\nof communicators. What little I know it took me\nyears to learn. Scarcely any one on this side has\neven such little appreciation of the conditions as\nI have acquired, and the conclusion of Mrs. E. is\nprobably that which nearly every person would\nreach if dealing with her own experiences here alone.\nR. Where we may meet with one failure we meet with\nmore that are not. Of course communications will\nalways be given in a fragmentary way. It cannot\nbe otherwise through any light.\nI am myself unable to see how a state of confusion or\ndreaming or coma can account for the kind of communi-\ncation complained of by Mrs. E., which seems to require\na consciousness sufficiently alert and acute to seize any\n\f536 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nindications which may enable it to personate with plausi-\nbility a character about whom it starts in almost complete\nignorance.\nThe following comment by the sitter\u2014a Mr. D.\u2014on the\ncommunications of January 20 and 21, 1898, are worth\ncomparing with Mrs. E.'s, though the cases differ in that\nin Mr. D.'s case his friend seems to be represented as writing\nhimself\u2014not through Rector\u2014though the latter was assist-\ning him or at least superintending the process :\nIn sentences of from six to twelve words, he ought to\nhave been able to have given one clear cut and un-\nmistakable experience, name, or thing well known to us\nall, or known only to himself, to be verified afterwards.\nPerhaps we expect too much.

Waking-Stage.\nSitter and recorder, Hodgson.\n[Several words not caught. Then many repeated attempts at\na name which her words \" It's George saying \" indicated that\nG. P. was trying to get her to give. The name approximated to\nMartha {Barton.} Martha was quite distinctly given at least\nonce, but the Barton was not quite reached. This name as\nshe gave it sounded\u2014not clearly\u2014more like Barralen or Parralen,\nand on my saying \" spell it,\" the letters she gave sounded more\nlike P.a.r. than B.a.r. She did not get any further in the\nspelling than the r. I suggested {Barron} and {Barran} and\n{Parson}, but none of these was accepted, she continued trying\nto repeat the name. No assent was made either to Martha\nor Mother which I suggested for the other sound. When\nI said Martha {Barton}, she stopped repeating the sound, a\nsmile broke over her face (which previously had a strained\nlook forward while she was automatically repeating the name)\nand she said \" that's it, sure. George says sure.\" This\nnote is made practically from memory on the afternoon of\nthe day of the sitting, Feb. 4, 1903. What follows is from\nmy shorthand record.]\nHear it ! That's his sister.\nR.

There's a little old lady with gray\nhair kind of wavy parted in centre and put around\nlike that off her forehead.\n[Mrs. P. makes motion with her right hand suggesting\ncurvature in front part of hair.

P. had promised to find out and let Hodgson\nknow \" after I go.\" Presumably \" Martha Barton \" is\nthe result. Mr. Barton, the previous sitter, however, who\nthought some things in the trance communications good,\nsaid, \"We know of no Martha {Barton}. We have a\ncousin Martha \u2014\u2014, nee {Barton}, but she is alive and\nwell.\"\nI have quoted this waking-stage for the sake of the\nMartha Barton incident, which seems of interest in con-\nnexion with the waking-stage consciousness. The con-\nfidence of the waking-stage intelligence in accepting the\nname, though a name of no significance, which is suggested\nto it is interesting, but might be due to Hodgson's own\nconviction conveyed in his tone.\nThe case is also interesting as an example of failure\nto carry out successfully a promised attempt to get a\nname or other word in the waking-stage.

Taylor had communicated on the 18th in the trance,\nbut had not mentioned Rufus Miller, so that the first\nclear mention of him and the first mention of his Christian\nname was in the waking-stage.\n(2) Rufus Miller, though he had really been a friend\nof the communicator's, is erroneously supposed to be\nalive both by the waking-stage intelligence on the 18th\nand by the trance intelligence on the 19th\u2014until the\nlatter has been clearly told by the sitter that he is dead.\nTaylor living could have been under no misapprehension\nabout this, and Taylor as communicator repudiates the\nmistake\u2014shuffles out of it not very plausibly. If there\nwas really, as he claims, no n)istake in idea, the same\nconfusion in expression must have occurred in waking-\nstage and in trance.\n(December 12, 1906.)

It will be noticed that it\noccurs here after she has become partially conscious of her\nactual surroundings, but before her consciousness is normal\nand before the first head snap.

[part\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER VII.\nRelation to bach other of Mrs. Piper's different\nCase illustrating the supposed relation of the trance personality\nto the normal Mrs. Piper (see pp. 259-266).\nIn April, 1902, Mrs. Piper had been ill from what her\ndoctor called nervous indigestion and in bed for several\ndays, and when attempts at sittings were resumed she\nfailed twice to go into trance. On April 28 (Hodgson\nbeing alone present) Rector wrote immediately after the\nusual greeting :\nR. Speak friend and give answer to the question we\nput to thee this day. There hath been great\ncloudiness over the light which hath debarred us\nfrom entering it. We found it impossible to return.\nHast thou any knowledge of its condition ?\n{The physical symptoms, dizziness, etc., are then\ndescribed by Hodgson, and Rector intervenes :}\nAfter our last meeting with thee we discovered that\nthe light hath partaken of either meat or fish of a\nvery poisonous nature and we had forbidden either.\nThis we found had caused great disturbance and\ndone great harm.\n{The controls proceed to prescribe a suitable diet, and\ndiscussion follows about the discontent which Hodgson\ndescribes Mrs. Piper as feeling and for which,; he\nsuggests reasons of which Rector disapproves. The\nfollowing conversation then takes place :}\nR. H. Shall I talk specially with the light and ask her to\ntell me briefly and plainly what her mind is towards\nyou and towards the whole situation and bring\nthis to you ?

Absolutely.\nWe wish to know what we can do to help her to\nfeel that we are truth love and wisdom, that our\nwork is God's work and His only.\nChiefly the question of our uses of the organism her\nbelief and the question of future gain from a\nworldly point of view.

We desire her\nto be happy, most happy with us if it be\npossible.\n# * # *\nAsk her any and every conceivable question which\nmay occur to thee whilst speaking and note down\non material paper the answers received from her and\nbring them before us.

[part\nHodgson accordingly had a talk with the normal Mrs.\nPiper, and reported to Rector on April 29, 1902. The\nfollowing is an extract from the conversation :\nR. H. Until lately she thought that you were severe with\nher and requested her {through Hodgson of course}\nto do things without realizing what her environment\nwas, that you did not understand the cares she had,\nthe trouble with her family, and her trials generally\nas a wife and mother\nR. Perhaps there may be a little truth in this but we\ndoubt if we have not seen much and it is not of\nus to be severe.\nIn these two sittings together, we have a clear assump-\ntion of ignorance on the part of the trance consciousness\nof the thoughts and feelings of the normal Mrs. Piper,\nand also of her surroundings and physical symptoms,\nexcept so far as the controls had learnt these by external\nobservation.\n0.

I may not be able to answer this question in detail,\nand yet I will give you my answer according to my\nexperience. Articles worn by a person when in the\nbody contain a certain form of magnetic power.\n[I object to the word magnetic,1\nreferring to the\ntechnical uses of scientific terms and the lax popular\nuses, etc.]\nDoctor. Ah but it is and is known to us as magnetic. We\nare attracted to the hght which the article carries\nwith it, and which it has received by having been\nused or worn by a spirit when in the body. It\nattracts in nearly the same way as a magnet\nattracts a needle. It carries with it its own sphere.\nIt has hght of its own. It has an etherial cover-\ning which is to us attractive or magnetic. It has\na slight etherial covering as it were.\nR. H. Firstly, then, such an article has some portion of\netherial attached to it. Has that etherial been\nleft there by the owner ? Is it a fragment so to\nspeak of his etherial ?\nDoctor. Yes, it is. For instance, had it not been worn by\nhim when in the body it would not have any\nattraction for him.\nR. H. Is that etherial on the article, has that been shed,\nso to speak, by the etherial covering of the spirit\nwhen in the body %\nDoctor. Yes it has.\nR. H. And not by the spirit etherial inside the covering ?\nDoctor. No.\nR. H. Just as there is perspiration from the skin of the\nordinary body, so there is etherial emanation from\nthe etherial covering ?\nDoctor. Yes, which can only be discerned by your spirit\nwhen out of your body.\nR. H. Under ordinary circumstances.\nDoctor. Under all circumstances.\nR. H. Perhaps I had better say, in ordinary cases.\n1 This is a little hard on Doctor, as the word magnet had been used\nin connexion with influences by Hodgson himself on November 30, 1892\n(see p. 355), and by Professor Newbold on June 20, 1895 (see p. 625).\n\f630 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nDoctor. Yes better.\nR. H. I was thinking of the case of a seeing spirit still in\nthe body.\nDoctor. Yes, depends however upon the development or . . .\n[undec.] of the spirit when in its body.\nR. H. Of what service is it to the spirit coming back and\ncommunicating ?\nDoctor. It so attracts him that he is enabled thereby to recall\nand relate some incident which was well known to\nhim when in his body, . . .\nR. H. Does it act in any other way, on this particular\npoint, than as a stimulus to his associations ?\nDoctor. Not to my knowledge.\nR. H. I bring an article of A, unknown to me. The con-\ntrolling spirit gets the person ? How ?\nDoctor. [According] to my understanding it is by joining the\ntwo lights.\nR. H. Can't read.\nDoctor. Bringing together the two lights.\n\\I misinterpret.]\nDoctor. No. joining the two, the controlling spirit being one\nlight, while the article carries its own light, and\nwhen being held by the controlling spirit he is\nable to words [?] vague [?] vague [?] attract the\nowner by it precisely as you for instance attract\nyour friends by being present when the reservoir\nis filled with ether, only this is chiefly done by the\ncontrolling spirit instead of the article alone. I\nwill illustrate. I am the controlling spirit. I have\nmy own light. You hand me an article worn by\nA. I hold it with my own light. The two are\ndissimilar. I am surrounded byd spirits. I attract\nthem by the light of the article which I hold. I\ndo not see any one who seems to recognize the\narticle. I may then see some friend of my own\nto whom I may speak and ask him to make a\nsearch for the owner. When he does this he\ndescribes the light, i.e. as it appears to him when\nthis is visible to him. He searches for the owner,\nand by the power of the spirit that you eouid\n\flxxi.] Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance.-\u2014Appendix. 631\nnot U D, he finds its owner among many, and brings\nhim forth. Instantly he recognizes his article. I\nhave seen your friend Pelham do this again and\nagain.\nR. H. Just as a dog might find its master in a crowded\nbuilding, so the spirit can find the owner of the\narticle, but in a much more, to us, marvellous\nfashion.\nDoctor. Repeat. This all sounds strange to me.\n[I repeat] Yes, more complex. You may use this\nanalogy for your understanding\nR. H. Having got him here, then ?\nDoctor. I have seen it done repeatedly. Personally I have\ndone very little if any of this attracting spirits by\narticles worn by them when in the bodies, yet I\nhave been an onlooker many times.\nR. H. Having got him here, then the article serves as a\nstimulus to his associations ?\nDoctor. Yes, independently of his friend.\nR. H. But suppose I bring the article. I don't know\nanything about the person to whom it belongs,\nbut we have got him here.\nDoctor. Ah yes. He sees his article or better the fight of\nhis article with etherial\nR. H. Clinging to it.\nDoctor. Clinging to it, taken from his body, etherial covering\nof his body.\nR. H. It has served the purpose of attracting the spirit\nand stimulating his associations. Has it any other\neffect ?\nDoctor. I do not U D. Put your question differently.\nR. H. I bathe in the sea. It cleanses my organism but\nit also invigorates otherwise. I might cleanse my\norganism in my room with soap and water, but I\nwouldn't get the same invigoration. The bathing\nin the sea has more than one effect.\nDoctor.

Not to my knowledge. More advanced spirits might\nbe better able to enlighten you on this point. I do\nnot think it however. I believe in such cases the\ninterior consciousness of the person holding such\narticles as named by yourself viz. ore, is more or\nless impressed by some spirit intelligence who was\nformerly connected with the locality from which\nthe ore was produced.\nWould it be possible for the interior consciousness\nof the person holding the ore, let us call this\nperson the percipient,\nvery well\nto see the locality herself ?\nAs it were clairvoyantly as you would term it ?\nYes.\nYes, impressed however by some spirit.\nNot by her own power ?\nNo. This is where persons on earth are ignorant.\nA distant percipient is given an article by a person,\nbelonging to B, and the percipient describes the\ncharacter of B, and perhaps special incidents. Is\nthat possible ?\nYes, providing the person possesses light. Otherwise\nnot, and would be untrustworthy.\nIt is a possible thing ?\nYes, indeed. The person possessing light can be\nimpressed by a spirit to describe such scenes and\nsurroundings\nand give a description of character ?\nyes also.\nBut she can't give it herself ?\nNo.\nHere is a woman in a distant city. Call her X. A\nperson known to me gives to X a letter by me\nand asks X for an account of the writer.
