W. H. Myers on \"Recognised Apparitions\nOccurring more than a Year after Death,\" both of which are printed\nbelow.\nII.\nADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT ON\nTHE CENSUS OF HALLUCINATIONS.\nIt is known to all members and associates of the Society for\nPsychical Research-at least to all who read this journal-that an\nattempt is being made 011 a large scale to obtain as accurate statistics\n\"as possible relative to the frequency, the specific nature, and-so far\nas may be-the causes of what I will briefly call Hallucinations.\nThe scale on which we are planning our census of Hallucinations\nis an ambitious one: it must be an ambitious one if we are to succeed\nin our aim; I do not think we can be satisfied with less than 50,000\nanswers to the first and most general question tba.t we are asking;\nand if we are to get 50,000 answers, we want a great deal more assis-\ntance than we have as yet got.\nI wish to express my gratitude, and the gratitude of th08(l who are\nworking with me, to the members and others who are aiding us in this\ntoilsome task; at the same time, I wish to urge on all members and\nassociates who have not yet offered aid that this is eminently a task for\nco-operative labour, in which everyone interested iu Psychical Research\nought to take a share. A copy of the single question that we wish to\nbe asked in all cases has beeu sent to every member and associate,\nwith spaces for 25 answers; we shall be happy to send any more copies\nto anyone who will a.pply for them; and if every member and associate\nwould only collect a single batch of twenty-five answers, and\npersuade some one friend to collect another batch, we should get in\nthis way over 30,000 answers and should have no doubt of being able\nto make up our 50,000.\nI fear, however, that it is too much to expect this universal\nco-operation. I hope, therefore, that every zealous person will collect,\neither personally or by friends, as many batches as possible. And I\nDigitized by Google\n\f8 The Oens'UB of HaUucinations. [July 8,\nmay add that we shall equally welcome assistance from persons who\nare not members or associates. I ought to add that we have carefully\nframed our question so that we may fairly ask for co-operation from\npersons of all opinions; it does not imply either belief or disbelief in\nthe reality of ghosts, or in telepathy, or in any other explanation of the\nphenomena inquired into. It runs as follows: \"Have you ever,\nwhen believing yourself to be completely awake, had a vivid impression\nof seeing or being touched by a living being or inanimate o~iect, or of\nhearing a voice, which impression, so far as you could discover, was\nnot due to an external physical cause 7\" I hope it will be seen how\nimpartially the question has been framed. The most bigoted Materialist\ndoes not deny that certain persons have the imprel!sions here described;\nthe most convinced Spiritualist does not usually attribute them to an\n\" external physical cause.\"\nThis ll'.ads me to say a word on the general term used to denote\nthese experiences. We require some one general term, and the best\nthat we can find to include all the species is \"Hallucination.\" I\nadmit the word to be open to some objection; because some people\nnaturally understand from it t.hat the impression so described is\nentirely false and morbid. But I need not say to readers of\n\" Phantasms\" that this is not our view: many of these experiences-\nthough doubtless they all involve some disturbance of the normal\naction of the nervous system-have no traceable connection with\ndisease of any kind: a.nd a certain number of them are, as we hold,\nreasonably regarded as \"veridical\" or truth-telling; they imply in\nthe percipient a capacity above the normal of receiving knowledge,\nunder certain rare conditions.\nWhy, then, it may be asked, do we use a term that implies\nerroneous and illusory belief1 I answer, first, because in every experi-\nence that we call a Hallucination there is an element of erroneous\nbelief, though it may be only momentary, and though it may be the\nmeans of communicating a truth that could not otherwise have been\nknown. If I seem to see the form of a friend pass through my room,\nI must have momentarily the false belief that his physical organism is\noccupying a portion of the space of my room, though a moment's re1l.ection\nmay convince me that this is not so, and though I may immediately\ndraw the inference that he is passing through a crisis of life some miles\noff, and this inference may tum out to be true. In the case of a\nrecurrent Hallucination known to be such, we cannot say that the\nfalse belief ever completely dominates the percipient's mind; but still, I\nconceive, it is partially there j here is an appearance that bas to be\nresisted by memory and judgment.\nIt' is, then, this element of error-perhaps only momentary and\npartial-which is implied in our term \"Hallucination,\" and so much\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] The Ce718U8 of Halluci'natiom.\nwill be admitted by most intelligent believers in ghosts: for there are\nfew of such believers who really hold that a ghost is actually seen as\nan ordinary material object is seen: i.e., that it affects the percipient's\neyes from the outside by redecting rays of light on them. But we wish\neven those ghost-seers who hold this belief to have no difficulty in answer-\ning \"Yes\" to our general question: and therefore in framing it we\navoided the word co Hallucination,\" though we have thought ourselves\njustified in using it in the \" Instructions to Collectors\" at the back of\nthe paper.\nAnd all would certainly admit that in many cases \"Hallucination\"\nis the only proper term. For instance, one of our informants saw a\nhand and arm apparently suspended from the ceiling-the owner of\nthe real counterpart of this hand and arm being alive and heard at the\ntime moving about in the next room.\nThe word\" apparition\" is, no doubt, a neutral word that might be\nused of all visual experiences of this kind; but it could only be used of\nvisual cases. Usage would not allow us to apply it to apparent sounds\norapparent touches.\nI think, then, that we must use \"hallucinations of the senses\" as a\ngeneral term for the experiences we are collecting: meaning simply to\ndenote by it a sensory effect which we cannot attribute to any external\nphysical cause of the kind that would ordinarily produce this effect.\nIn some cases we can refer it clearly to 0. physical cause within the\norganism-some temporary or permanent physica.l condition. In other\ncases-quite apart from telepathy-it is equally clear that the cause is\nprimarily psychical. For instance, in the case of persons who have\nbeen hypnotised, it may result from a post-hypnotic order. Thus in an\narticle by Mr. Gurney, in Proceedings, Part XII., pp. 12, 13, there is an\ninteresting account of the result of a. suggestion made by him' to a\nsubject named ZijIah in the hypnotic trance, that she would have a\nhallucination of him at a certain fixed time on the following day; and\nthere is a letter from Zillah's mistress describing the surprise caused\nto Zillah by seeing Mr. Gurney come into the kitchen and say \"Good-\nafternoon,\" at the appointed time. Here we can trace the origin of the\nidea which thus externalised itself. In other cases, as with the arm\nabove mentioned, the idea arises spontaneously by association or other-\nwise in the mind. In other cases, again, the idea which thus externalises\nitself may, as we believe, come into the mind from the mind of a\nperson at a distance-the idea of \" dying friend reaching us from his\nmind and rising above the threshold of consciousness in the form of a\nhallucination, just as the idea of Mr. Gurney rose above the\nthreshold of consciousness in Zillah's case in the form of a hallucination.\nA link between the two is afforded by those rare and interesting\ncases, of which several have been recorded in the publications of our\nDigitized by Google\n\f10 The C6'n8'U8 of HaUucinations. [July 8:\nSociety, where one person is able from a distance and by a mental pro-\ncess alone to cause an apparition of himself to another. We have reason\nto think that the resulting sensory effect is in all these cases essentia.lly\nthe same, though the cause of it is very different in different cases ; and,\ntherefore, in the present state of our knowledge, it seems best to apply\nthe term \"hallucination\" to all.\nI have dwelt thus long upon the use of the word hallucination-\nbecause the discussion brings out incidentally the importance of\nmaking the statistical inquiry we are engaged in as to the kind of\nhallucinations that occur, and the proportion of people that experience\nthem. It is clear from what we have said that the subject of hallu-\ncinations is of importance to psychologists and physiologists, for whom\nthey throw light on the workings of the mind and senses. And it is\nalso of some practical use to inquire into them with a view to dispelling\nthe alarm they frequently cause. But it is for those interested in\nPsychical Research that they are at present most important-a.nd that\nwhether they are supporters or opponents. For those who believe in\ntelepathy it is of course very important to study as completely as\npossible the mode in which, as it appears, telepathica.1ly imparted ideas\nare apt to manifest themselves. But, apart from this, it is absolutely\nnecessary, in order to prove that the hallucinations of dying persons\nare really connected with their death, to form some idea of the relative\nfrequency of such hallucinations compared with those which do not\ncorrespond with any external event. Apparitions of living persons\nwhen nothing seemingly is happening tQ them are common-much\ncommoner than veridical ones. Mr. Gurney ca.1culated that, if a man\nsaw an apparition of his friend, he would be justified in assuming the\nchance that his friend had died within an hour of that time as about\n1 in 40. If this conc~usion be correctly drawn from adequate data, we\nneed not feel extremely alarmed about our friend if we see his apparition;\nthough, at the same time, the frequency of the coincidence is very far\nbeyond what chance would give. But it has been doubted whether the\nnumber of answers which Mr. Gurney collected-5,700--is sufficient\nto give accurately thc proportion of the popUlation who have seen\napparitions; and ?tlr. Gurney himself considered it quite insufficient\nto determine the proportion of coincidental to non-eoincidental cases.\nTo arrive at this he endeavoured to form an estimate of the size of\nthe circle from which our veridical cases are drawn. This is necessarily\nextremely uncertain, and though I think the estimate given in\nP\/w,ntasTn8 is probably in excess of the truth and therefore allows\na margin against the telepathic hypothesis, this view has not been\ntaken by critics of that work, some of whom think that the circle has\nnot been assumE'<l lal'ge enough. At any rate we should all agree with\nthe critics in thinking that it would be much better if we could\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] The Ce'nB'UB of Hallucinations. 11\ndispense with conjecture altogether and know the experiences of a\nsufficient number of persons to enable us to tell from the statistics\nalone what proportion of the population have hallucinations and what\nproportion of these are coincidental. If we can collect 50,000 answers\nI think we could do this, but the coincidental cases are too rare for us\nto rely on a smaller number.\n[Some account of the progress of the census so far was here given.\nAn account of the answers received up to October 24th, 1889, will be\nfound in the Supplement.]\nI have tried to show that all the phenomena to which our question\nrelates-veridical or not-should be called hallucinations. I must,\nhowever, admit that it is not very easy to draw the line unmistakably\nbetween what is a hallucination and what is not. The difficulty meets\nus in all directions. For instance, are sounds heard in a so-called\nhaunted house hallucinations or are they real sounds1 This question\nwould be answered di1Ierently by different persons, and it was because\nwe felt that hopeless ambiguity would be introduced into our results\nby including noises as distinct from voices that we limited our inquiry\nin auditory experiences to voices. But the difficulty of drawing\nthe line is not thus entirely avoided. It is often difficult to decide on\nthe degree of externalisation of an experience both in visual and\nauditory cases. For instance, it may be asked-how does a vivid\nvisual impression seen with the eyes shut count, and ho~ does this\ndiffer from an apparition seen in the dark 1 Or again, how far is the\nkind of experience which is sometimes described as an internal voice,\nor as a soundless sound, an auditory hallucination 1 I do not think\nthat in fact there is any sharp line between such a mental image as\nmost of us can ca.ll up and a genuine hallucination-experiences of all\ndegrees of externalisation occur between the two. There are some\nwhich we have no hesitation in calling hallucinations and some which\nwe can equally confidently say are not, but there are some which it is\ndifficult to decide about. As regards these, I would say to those who\nanswer our question--put down either yes or a query, and give details,\nleaving to the Committee who will have to analyse the results the\nburden of deciding how they should be classed.\nOne other point of doubt about our question may here be men-\ntioned. We determined to secure as far as possible that our answers\nshould be the bond fide answers of grown-up people by asking the\nquestion only of people who have attained the age of 21. But we\ndid not mean by this, as has been understood in some cases, to\nexclude experiences which had occurred to those answering at any age.\nAgain some collectol\"S have asked me whether uneducated people\nmay be included in the census. There is no objection to this-indeed\nI think it desirable to include all classes-but collectors will find\nDigitized by Google\n\f12 The Oe'MU8 of Hallucin.a.tions. [July 8,\nthat a good deal of care and trouble must be taken to make sure\nthat uneducated people quite understand the question.\nI have kept to the last the most important of the special points to\nwhich I wish to draw attention. It is not only necessary, as I have\nsaid, that our census shall be sufficiently extensive, but it is also of\nfundamental importance that it shall be impartial, that the collector\nshould not yield to any bias in favour of collecting either positive or\nnegative answers. It is, of course, natural that the collector should be\nmore interested in obtaining experiences of the positive kind, and it is,\nof course, very probable that when it is known in his circle of friends\nand acquaintances that he is making this collection, that cases of such\nexperiences should be mentioned to him. It is, however, obvious that\nif answers to() which he is directed in this way were simply included in\nhis list without any special mark, the impartiality of the result would\nbe fundamentally vitiated. In order to guard against this danger,\nand at the same time not to lose any information which might have an\nimportant value for our inquiry, we advise all our collectors when they\nsend in their lists, to put a cross against any answer the nature of which\nwas known to them through information received before they asked the\nquestion.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] On &cognised .Apparition8. 13\nIII.\nON RECOGNISED APPARITIONS OCCURRING MORE\nTHAN A YEAR AFTER DEATH.l\nBy F. W. H. MYERS.\nThe last Part of these Proceeding. included an exposition,-begun\nby the late Mr. Edmund Gurney and completed by myself,-of the\nprincipal cases in our possession where an apparition occurring soon\nafter the death of the person figured seems plausibly referable to some\nother than a merely subjective origin i-seems, in fact, to have been\nl&epathic or veridical,~ real communication from some mind outside\nthe percipient's own. In choosing these cases a line was drawn at a\nyear after death;_ line partly arbitrary, but partly determined by\nthe fact that after that lapse of time recognised apparitions with even\na primd facie claim to be classed as veridical, become exceedingly rare.\nThey are rare, and they are in many ways perplexing; but it is\nnonl:! the less our duty to discuss them. Inconclusive when considered\nby themselves, they are full of instruction when we compare them with\n. the larger groups which include apparitions at or shortly after death.\nThe momentous step, of course, is already taken so soon as we\nconsent to refer any poBt-mor~ apparition,~ating even from the\nmorrow of the death,-to the continued agency of the decedent. Few\nreaders will question the assumption that in that unknown journey\nce n'ut que Ie premier pas qui co!Ue.\nAnd since we are standing here on the threshold of new per-\nplexities, let us pause for a moment and consider what is the\nphenomenon which we are looking for,-what connotation we are to\ngive to the word \"ghost,\"-a word which has embodied so many\nunfounded theories and causeless fears. It would be more satisfactory,\nin the present state of our knowledge, simply to collect facts without\noffering speculative comment. But it seems safer to begin by briefly\npointing out the manifest errors of the traditional view; since that\n1 The papers in th_ ProceedifIQ' which deal with evidence aim rather at setting\nforth that evidence accurately and impartially than at expressing-what is compara-\ntively unimportant-the precise degree of belief at which the writer hiulself may\nhave arrived. But in th_ papers on posthumous apparitiODB the hypothe888\ndiscuIsed are at once 80 momentous and 80 disputable that it seems well to repeat here\nthe notice prefixed to all th_ Proceeding., and to remind the reader that I am not\nspeaking &8 the mouthpiece of my colleagues in the Council of the S.P.R. Variou8\nconverging linea of evidence have led me individually to think it probable that in lOme\nat 1\n. . of the cases here cited there has been a real agency of deceased persons. But\nno one e1ae is reeponaible for that opinion; nor do I even claim that the evidence\ncited is enough to prove ita truth.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Recogniaed Apparitions occu\/rring [July 8,\ntradition, if left unnoticed, would remain lodged in the background\neven of many minds which have never really accepted it.\nBriefly, then, the popular view regards a \"ghost\" as a ckceased\npentm permitted by Provickncs to hold communication with survivor,.\nAnd this short definition contains, I think, at least three unwarrantable\nassumptions. .\nIn the first place, such words as permiBBion and Provickncs are\nsimply neither more nor less applicable to this phenomenon than to\nany other. We conceive that all phenomena alike tak.e place in\naccordance with the laws of the universe ;-and consequently by\npermission of the Supreme Power in the universe. Undoubtedly the\nphenomena with which we are dealing are in this sense permitted to\noccur. But there is no apriori reason whatever for assuming that\nthey are permitted in any especial sense of their own, or that they form\nexceptions to law, instead of being exemplifications of law. Nor is\nthere any aposteriori reason for thus supposing,-any such inference\ndeducible from a study of the phenomena themselves. If we attempt\nto find in these phenomena any poetical justice, or manifest adaptation\nto human cravings, we shall be just as much disappointed as if we\nendeavoured to find a similar satisfaction in the ordinary course of\nterrene history.\nIn the second place, we have no warrant for the assumption that\nthe phantom seen, even though it be somehow cau,ed by a deceased\nperson, is that deceased person, in any ordinary sense of the word.\nInstead of appealing to the crude analogy of the living friend who,\nwhen he has walked into the room, is in the room, we shall find for the\nghost Ilo much closer parallel in those hallucinatory figures or phantasms\nwhich living persons can sometimes project at a distance. When\nBaron von Notzing, for instance, caused by an effort of will\nan apparition of himself to a waking percipient, out of sight, he was\nhimself awa.ke and conscious in the pla.ce where, not his phantom but\nhis body stood. Whatever, then, that phantom waI,-however\ngenerated or conditioned,-we cannot say that it was himtJe1\/. And\nequally unjustifiable must be the common parlance which speaks of the\nghost as though it were the decedent himself-a revenant coming back\namongst living men.\nAll this, of course, will be already familiar to most of my readers,\nand only needs repetition here because experience shows that when-as\nwith these post-mortem phantoms-the decedent has gone well out of\nsight or reach, there is a fresh tendency (so to say) to anthrO[X\u00bbnorpl'iBe\nthe apparition; to suppose that, as the decedent is not provably\nanywhere else, he is probably here; and that the apparition is bound\nto behave accordingly. All such assumptions must be dismissed, and\nthe phantom must be taken on its merits,-as indicating merely a\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than a Year after Death. 15\ncertain connection with the decedent, the precise nature of that\nconnection being a part of the problem to be solved.\nAnd in the third place, just as we cease to say that the phantom iB\nthe decedent, so also must we cease to ascribe to the phantom the\nmotives by which we imagine that the decedent might be swa.yed. We\nmust therefore exclude from our definition of a ghost any words which\nassume its intention to communicate with the living. It ma.y bear\nsuch a relation to the decedent that it can reflect or represent his\npresumed wish to communicate, or it may not. If, for instance, its\nrelation to his post-mortem life be like the relation of my dreams to my\nearthly life, it may represent little that is truly his, save such vague\nmemories and instincts as give a dim individuality to each man's trivial\ndreams.\nLet us attempt, then, a truer definition. Instead of describing a\n\"ghost\" as a dead person permitted to communicate with the living,\nlet us define it as a manifestation 0\/perBiBtent perfJO'Tl,(J}. energy,-or as\nan indication that some kind of force is being exercised after death\nwhich is in some way connected with a person previously known on\nearth. In this definition we have eliminated, as will be seen, a great\nmass of popular assumptions. Yet we must introduce a further\nproviso, lest our definition still seem to imply an assumption which we\nhave no right to make. It is theoretically possible that this force or\ninfluence which, after a man's death, creates a phantasmal impression\nof him, may indicate no continuing action on his part, but may be some\nresidue of the force or energy which he generated while yet alive.\nThere may be veridical after-images :-such as Mr. Gurney hints at\n(Proceedings, Vol. IV., p. 417), when in his comments on the recurring\nfigure of an old woman ;-seen on the bed where she was murdered,-\nhe remarks that this figure suggests \"not so much any continuing local\naction on the part of the deceased person, as the survival of a mere\nimage, impressed, we cannot guess how, on we cannot guess what, by\nthat person's physical organism, and perceptible at times to those\nendowed with some cognate form of sensitiveness.\"\nStrange as this notion may seem, it is strongly suggested by many\nof the cases of haunting which do not fall within the scope of the\npresent paper. It will be remembered that Mrs. Sidgwick's paper on\nPhanta8m8 of tM Dead brought out the fact that there is strong\nevidence for the recurrence of the same hallucinatory figures in\nthe same localities, but weak evidence to indicate any purpose in\nmost of these figures, or any connection with bygone individuals, or\nwith such tragedies as are popularly supposed to start a ghost on its\ncareer. In some of these cases of frequent, meaningless recurrence\nof a figure in a given spot, we are driven to wonder whether it can\nbe lOme decedent's past frequentation of that spot, rather than any\nDigitized by Google\n\f16 On .Recognised Apparit';'o'n8 occtl\/rring [July 8,\nfresh action of his after death, which has generated what I have\ntermed the veridical after-image,-veridical in the sense that it com-\nmunicates information, previously unknown to the percipient, as to a\nformer inhabitant of the haunted locality.\nSuch are BOme of the questions which our evidence suggests. And\nI may point out that the very fact that such bizarre problems should\npresent themselves at every turn does in a certain sense tend to show\nthat these apparitions are not purely sUbjective things,-do not\noriginate merely in the percipient's imagination. For they are not like\nwhat any man would have imagined. What man's mind tends to fancy\non such topics may be seen in the endleBB crop of fictitious ghost-stories j\n-which furnish, indeed, a curious proof of the persistence of pre-\n.conceived notions. For they go on being framed according to canons\nof their own, and deal with a set of imaginary phenomena quite\ndifferent from those which actually occur. The actual phenomena, I\nmay add, could scarcely be made romantic. One true \" ghost-story \"\nis apt to be very like another j-and all to be fragmentary and\napparently meaningleBB. Their meaning, that is to say, lies in their\nconformity, not to the mythopreic instinct of mankind, which fabricates\nand enjoys the fictitious tales, but to BOme unknown law, not based on\nhuman sentiment or convenience at all.\nAnd thus, absurdly enough, we BOmetimes hear men ridicule the\nphenomena which actually do happen, simply because those phenomena\ndo not suit their preconceived notions of what ghostly phenomena\nought to be j-not perceiving that this very divergence, this very\nunexpectedness, is in itself no slight indication of an origin outaUk the\nminds which obviouslywere BOfar from anticipating anything of the kind.\nAll this needs to be remembered before we approach the special\ncases which form the subject of this paper. For the narratives on\nwhich we shall now have to dwell are precisely those which do the most\nnearly correspond to the popular view of what a ghost should be. They\nare cases, at any rate, where the figure was recognised, and in BOme of\nwhich there was an apparent object in its apPearance. It is, of course,\nnot the emotional but the evidential value of these recognitions which\ninterests us here. The identification of a figure previously unknown,\nor of a previously known figure under certain conditions, is naturally a\npoint de \"pere of first-rate evidential importance.\nTwo main points have to be made clear in every such case. Firstly,\nwe have to assure ourselves that the apparition was really veridical,-\nnot a mere subjective hallucination, or a trick of memory, or a hoax.\nAnd, secondly, we have to make sure that it was really recognised;-\nthat BOme kind of link existed between the phantasm and BOme\ndeceased person. Some kind of link we demand j but what that link\nmay be,-in wha.t sense the ghost represents the decedent,-this is our\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] .More than a Year after Death. 17\nmost perplexing question. And in order to get what light we can on\nthis point, it will be well to arrange our cases in what may be called a\ndescending scale of personality i-beginning with those where there\nseems to be an intelligent purpose in the phantom; then giving those\nwhere there seems to be a. purpose, but not in our sense an intelligent\none; and lastly, taking those where no purpose is discernible, but the\nwhole manifestation seems like a dead man's incoherent dream.\nThe difficulties and weaknesses of the evidence will be pointed out\nas we proceed. And finally we may discuss, by the aid of such\nanalogies as we possess, what are the least improbable conjectures\nwhich we can form as to the nature of these phantoms, and what light\nour evidence throws upon any theory of po8t-mortem existence.\nI. Let us begin, then, with phantoms raised, so to say, to their\nhighest power i-apparently showing intelligence, and knowledge of\nearthly matters. Are there any grounds, we may in the first place ask,\nfor the popular notion that ghosts may possess more knowledge of\nthings on earth than survivors possess 7 Especially tha.t they come to\nwarn of death or disaster which for men on earth is still hidden in\nobscurity 1 Or can they discern physical dangers,-robbers, precipices,\nor the like,-which the living man fails to see 1 and do they ever\nintervene to guide or protect him 7\nIt will be seen that we ha.ve very little evidence which points to\nsuch powers as these. I will begin with th~ most striking case ;-one\nwhich was sent in 1887 to the American S.P.R. Professor Royce and\nMr. Hodgson vouch for the high character and good position of the\ninformants; and it will be seen that, besides the percipient himself, his\nfather and brother are first-hand witnesses as regards the most\nimportant point i-the effect produced by a certain symbolic item in\nthe phantom's aspect.\nI.-From Mr. F. G., Boston.\nJanuary 11th, 1888.\nSm.-Replying to the recently published request of your Society for\nactual occurrences of psychical phenomena. I respectfully submit the fol-\nlowing remarkable occurrence to the consideration of your distinguished\nSociety, with the assurance that the event made a more powerful impreBSion\non my mind than the combined incidents of my whole life. I have never\nmentioned it outside of my family and a few intimate friends, knowing well\nthat few would believe it, or else ascribe it to some disordered state of my\nmind at the time, but I well know I never was in better health or\npoasessed a clearer head and mind than at the time it occurred.\nIn 1867, my only sister, a young lady of 18 years, died suddenly of\ncholera, in St. Louis, Mo. My attachment for her was very strong. and the\nblow a severe one to me. A year or 80 after her death, the writer became a\ncommercial traveller, and it was in 1876 while on one of my Western trips\nthat the event occurred.\nc\nDigitized by Google\n\f18 On Recognised Apparitions occ'U\/rring [July 8,\nI had \" drummed II the city of St. Joaeph, Mo., and had gone to my\nroom at the Pacific House to send in my orders, which were unusually large\nones, 80 that I was in a very happy frame of mind indeed. My thoughts, of\ncourse, were about these orders, knowing how pleased my house would be at\nmy success. I had not been thinking of my late sister, or in any manner\nreflecting on the past. The hour was high noon, and the sun was shining\ncheerfully into my room. While busily smoking a cigar, and writing out my\norders, I suddenly became conscious that lOme one was sitting on my left,\nwith one arm resting on the table. Quick as a flash I turned and distinctly\nsaw the form of my dead sister, and for a brief second or so looked her\nsquarely in the face ; and 80 sure was I that it was she, that I sprang forward\nin delight, calling her by name, and, as I did 80, the apparition instantly\nvanished. Naturally I was startled and dumbfounded, almoat doubting my\nsenses ; but the cigar in my mouth, and pen in hand, with the ink still moist\non my letter, I satisfied myself I had not been dreaming and was wide awake.\nI was near enough to touch her, had it been a physical possibility, and noted\nher features, expression, and details of dress, &C. She appeared as if alive.\nHer eyes looked kindly and perfectly natural into mine. Her skin was 80\nlife-like that I could see the glow or moisture on its surface, and, on the\nwhole, there was no change in her appearance, otherwise than when alive.\nNow comes the moat remarkable COf\\firmation of my statement, which\ncannot be doubted by those who know what I state actually occurred. This\nvisitation, or whatever you may call it, 80 impressed me that I took the next\ntrain home, and in the presence of my parents and others I related what\nhad occurred. My father, a man of rare good sense and very practical, was\ninclined to ridicule me, as Ite laW how earnestly I believed what I stated ;\nbut he, too, was amazed when later on I told them of a bright red line or\nIlCratM on the right-hand side of my sister's face, which I distinctly had\nseen. When I mentioned this, my mother rose trembling to her feet and\nnearly fainted away, and as soon as she sufficiently recovered her self-\nposaeaaion, with tears streaming down her face, she exclaimed that I had\nindeed seen my sister, as no living mortal but herself wasaware ofthat scratch,\nwhich she had accidentally made while doing lOme little act ofkindness after\nmy sister's death. She said she well remembered how pained she was to\nthink she should hav6, unintentionally, marred the features of her dead\ndaughter, and that unknown to all, how she had carefully obliterated all\ntraces of the slight scratch with the aid of powder, &c., and that she had\nnever mentioned it to a human being, from that day to this. In proof, neither\nmy father nor any of our family had detected it, and positively were unaware\nof the incident, yet I BaW the IlCratM as bright as if just made. So strangely\nimpressed was my mother that even after she had retired to relt, she got up\nand dressed, came to me and told me Me knew at least that I had seen my\nsister. A few weeks later my mother died, happy in her belief she would\nrejoin her favourite daughter in a better world.\nIn a further letter Mr. F. G. adds :-\nThere was nothing of a spiritual or ghostly nature in either the form or\n-dress of my sister, she appearing perfectly natural, and dressed in clothing\nthat she usually wore in life, and which was familiar tome.

The dress had no\nparticular &BBOci&tion for me or my mother, no more 80 than others she W&8 in\nthe habit of wearing ; but to-day, while I hmIe forgotten all Mr otMr df'UlU,\npi''\"'' and combs, I could go to her trunk (which we have just &8 she left it)\nand pick out the very dress and ornaments she wore when she appeared to\nme, 80 well do I remember it.\nYou are correct in understanding that I returned home earlier than I had\nintended, &8 it had such an effect on me that I could hardly think of any\nother matter ; in fact, I abandoned a trip that I had barely commenced, and,\nordinarily, would have remained on the road a month longer.\nMr. F. G. a.gain writes to Mr. Hodgson, Ja.nuary 23rd, 1888:-\nAs per your request, I enclose a letter from my father which is indorsed by\nmy brother, confirming the statement I made to them of the apparition I had\naeen. I will add that my father is one of the oldest and most respected\ncitizens of St. Louis, Mo., a retired merchant, whose winter residence is at\n--, Ills., a few miles out by rail. He is now 70 years of age, but a\nremarkably well-preserved gentleman in body and mind, and a very learned\nman, as well. As I informed you, he is slow to believe things that rea.aon\ncannot explain. My brother, who indorses the statement, h&8 resided in\nBoston for 12 years, doing busineB8 on --street, as per letter-head above,\nand the last man in the world to take stock in statements without good proof.\nThe others who were present (including my mother) are now dead, or were\nthen 80 young as to now have but a dim remembrance of the matter.\nYou will note that my father refers to the \"scratch,\" and it was this that\npuzzled all, even himself, and which we have never been able to account for,\nfurther than that in lOme mysterious way I had actually seen my sister nin!'\nyears after death, and had particularly noticed and described to my parents\nand family this bright red scratch, and which, beyond all doubt in our minds,\nwaa unknown to a 80ul save my mother, who had accident&lly caused it.\nWhen I made my statement, all, of course, listened and were interested ;\nbut the matter would probably have passed with comments that it was a freak\nof memory, had not I asked about the scratch, and the instant I mentioned it,\nmy mother was aroused as if she had received an electric shock, as she had\nkept it secret from all, and 8M alone W&8 able to explain it. My mother was\na sincere Christian lady, who was for 25 years superintendent of a large\ninfant class in her church, the Southern Methodist, and a directress in many\ncharitable institutions, and was highly educated. No lady at the time stood\nhigher in the city of St. Louis, and she was, besides, a woman of rare good\nBense.\nI mention these points to give you an insight into the character and\nstanding of those whose testimony, in such a case, is necesasry.\n(Signed) F. G.\nFrom Mr. H. G.\n--, Ills., Jamtary 20th, 1888.\nDBAR F.,-Yours of 16th inst. is received. In reply to your questionl!l\nrelating to your having seen our Annie, while at St. Joseph, Mo., I will state\n02\nDigitized by Goo~\n\f20 On R\u00a3cognised Apparitions occurring [July 8,\nthat I well remember the statement you made to family on your return home.\nI remember your stating how she looked in ordinary home dress, and\nparticularly about the scratch (or red spot) on her face, which you could not\naccount for, but which was fully explained by your mother. The spot was\nmade while adjusting something about her head while in the casket, and\ncovered with powder. All who heard you relate the phenomenal sight\nthought it was true. You well know how sceptical I am about things which\nreason cannot explain. Affectionately,\n(Signed) H. G. (father).\nI was present at the time and indorse the above.\n(Signed) K. G. (brother).\nThe apparent redness of the scratch on the face of the apparition\ngoes naturally enough with the look of life in the face. The phantom\ndid not appear as a corpse, but as a blooming girl, and the scratch\nshowed as it would have shown if made during life.\nThis symbol, in its essential point,-the manifestation in a phantom\nof a change in personal appearance which the percipient had no oppor-\ntunity of observing during life,-may be compared with the \"Newgate\nfringe\" grown before death by Lieutenant B. (Proceedings, Vol. V.,\np. 470), and observed by General Barter in Lieutenant B.'s phantom.\nBut it can seldom happen that the aspect of a near relation can furnish\nan evidential indication so distinct as this. Even assuming an\nintelligent purpose in the phantom, one does not see what could in\nmost cases be represented beyond a mere likeness of the deceased; and\na mere likeness of a known face must always be lia'ble to be taken for\na purely subjective hallucination. The death of the mother in this\ncase, a few weeks after the apparition, is noteworthy. If the apparition\nhad been delayed there would have been no one left on earth who was\ncapable of interpreting its symbolism. We may therefore class this as\na case in which it is possible,-though not, of course, provable,-that\nthe decedent was aware of the approaching death of a survivor. If\nthe incident is correctly recorded, or if it is not a mere extraordinary\ncoincidence, it certainly seems probable that recognition was intelli-\ngently aimed at.\nIn the next case the ghost is seen by several persons, and it moves\ninto a room where the decedent's sister is lying on her death-bed.\nThere is, therefore, an indication of knowledge of earthly events,-but\nnot of an earlier or fuller knowledge than survivors themselves possess.\nII.-From Miss Pearson, 15, Fitzroy-square, W.O.\nApril, 1888.\nThe house, 19, St. James's-place, Green Park, had been taken on a very\nlong lease by my grandfather, a solicitor, in large county practice, having his\noffices in Essex-street, Strand.\nThere my father was born and his two sisters, Ann and Harriet.

They had been devotedly attached to each other. In November,\n1864, I was summoned to Brighton. My Aunt Harriet was then very ill\nthere. Mrs. Coppinger, the daughter of Mr. Thomas Pearson, my father's\nbrother, was there, and her son, Mr. George James, by her first husband,\ncame up and down. Eliza Quinton was nursing her. She only craved to\n\u00b7go back to the old house where she was bom, and I made arrangements with\nthe railway company and took her home.\nThis was in the second week in December. She became worse and\nworse. Eliza continued to nurse her, and Mrs. Coppinger, Mrs. John\nPearson, the wife of a nephew, and myself helped with the night work.\nMiss Harriet Pearson slept in a large three-windowed bedroom over the\ndrawing-room. The room behind was occupied by Mrs. Coppinger and\n.myself, though one of us was generally in the patient's room at night. On\nthe night of December 22nd,l864, Mrs. John Pearson was in the room,\nMrs. Coppinger and myself in the back room j the house lighted up on\nthe landings and staircases, our door wide open.\nAbout 1 or 2 a.m. on the moming of December 23rd, both Mrs.\nCoppinger and myself started up in bed j we were neither of us sleeping, as\nwe were watching every sound from the next room.\nWe saw some one pass the door, short, wrapped up in an old shawl, a\nwig with three curls each side and an old black cap. Mrs. Coppinger called\nout, \"Emma, get up, it is old Aunt Ann.\" I said, co So it is, then Aunt\nHarriet will die to-day.\" We jumped up, and Mrs. John Pearson came\nrushing out of the room and said, \"That was old Aunt Ann. Where is she\ngone to 1\" I said to soothe her, \"Perhaps it was Eliza come down to see how\nher mistress is.\" Mrs. Coppinger ran upstairs and found Eliza sleeping\nin the servants' room. She was very awestruck but calm, dreued and\ncame down. Every room was searched, no one was there, and from that\nday to this no explanation has ever been given of this appearance, except\nthat it was old Aunt Ann come to call her sister, and she died at 6 p.m.\nthat day. EMMA M. PEABsoN.\nThe housekeeper, who is still with Miss Pearson, writes as follows:-\nI was living with Miss Ann and Miu Harriet Pearson, in 19, St. James's-\nplace. After the death of MiBB Ann I remained with her sister, and when\nshe became very ill and was ordered change of air, I went with her\nas nurse to Brighton. Mrs. Coppinger was there and Mr. George .Tames\nnow and then. Miss Emma Pearson was sent for and came down. She\nbrought her aunt back to London. I continued to nurse her. I remember\non the early morning of December 23rd being called up by Mrs. Coppinger,\nwho said that she, Miss Emma, and Mrs. John Pearson had seen someone\ncome upstairs and pass into the patient's room. Was it 11 I said no. Mrs.\nCoppinger said, \"They said it was old Aunt Ann.\" We searched the house\nand could find no one. Miu Harriet died in the evening of that day, but\nbefore that told all of us that she had seen her sister aud knew it was\nher, and she had come to call her.

The relation of time between the apparition and the\ndeath is also uncertain. The phantom's brother was undergoing at the\ntime his last illness; but that illness was a long one.\nIII.-From Madame de Gilibert, The Paddocks, Hayward's Heath.\nThe Hon. Auberon HElrbert and other members of the family have\nkindly looked through the dates, &c., in this narrative, which, so far as\ngiven by Madame Gilibert, were correct.\nSir Robert Herbert, K.C.M.G., writes :-\n\"It is an unUlually well authenticated ltory, as far as the honesty of the\nreporter goes.\" Mr. Robert Marsham remarka that .. the fact that the\nsuperior servant Garland leemed vexed at first when the little Charlotte\nKing described what she had seen, would rather seem to imply that the\nghost had been known to appear before.\"\nLady Carnarvon died February 10th, 1826.\nThe Earl of Egremont died November 11th, 1837.\nJune, 1883.\nIn my early days I lived in a large house, belonging to my grandfather\n[the Earl of Egremont], at Petworth, from which we removed on his death\n(1837); from this date I conclude that I could not have been younger than\n11 or older than 12 when the following occurrence took place, between the\nbeginning of the year 1836 and the winter of 1837.\nI mUit describe that part of the hOUie which we, the family, occupied on\nthe ground door. My grandfather's room was on the south side of a long\npassage, which communicated with the more public parte of the hOUie.\nOpposite his door, on the north side of the passage, was a swinging, red\nbaize door, which led to a narrow corridor, having on one side two doors,\none my mother's bedroom, and the other the door of my father's dressing-\nroom ; on the other side was a small staircase, leading to two rooms occupied\nby Garland, a superior servant, who took care of my grandfather, who was\nvery old. All the grandchildren were very fond of Garland, who spoilt us\nall. One afternoon I had gone up to her rooms, and not finding her, as she\nhad not returned from the steward's room from dinner, I turned to go\ndownstairs. I generally \"slid\" down those stairs in a way peculiar to\nmyself. Balancing myself on my chest, and straightening myself into a\nnearly horizontal position, I Uled to let myself go down the incline with an\nimpetus. I was in this position, just about to launch myself, when I was\naware of a figure, which came from the baize door, and which astonished me\nand made me pause. It was a female figure, in soft, clinging drapery,\ngreyish whitish,-some sort of shawl or kerchief crossed over the bosom;\nthe features, well-cut, delicate, and of an aquiline type; but what struck me\nmost was the head-dress or coif, which had lace lappets or strings which,\npassing under the chin, were tied in a. bow on the top of the head. I was,\nas I said, astonished, but not frightened. So many people did go about the\nhouse that it never occurred to me to be anything supernatural. But when\nthe figure glided past the two doors I have mentioned, a sort of revulsion\ntook place in me. I let myself slide down the balustrade and rushed to stop\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than a Year ajteT Death. 23\nher and tell her that there waa no \"way out.\" (There was a diaUl8d door,\nbut it had been long blocked up.) I could not have been five aeconda\nbehind the figure, but when I reached the blocked door, there waa nothing.\nI 1meto no one could pass, but I ran round to the children's nurseries,\nwith which that door had communicated, and began asking the nurses\nwhether they had seen \"an old woman in a white dressing-gown and grey\nshawl and lace ribbons under her chin tied on the top of her head,\" adding,\n\"and she had a nose like Mrs. Pullen\" (the head laundress, who waa_a 80rt\nof female Duke of Wellington). I only got laughed at and snubbed by the\nnUl'llell, but when Garland came in and I told her, she seemed vexed at first,\nand ended by scolding me, 80 I was \"shut up\" ; but nevertheleaa I knew\nthat I could not account for it, and every detail of dreaa, feature, and gait is\naa vivid now lUI it was at the time.\nMany years afterwarda I W&8 in Paria after my marriage, and I UI8d to\nsee a cousin of my mother's, who had married abroad, and I told her once\nwhat I have above narrated. Madame de Vabner at once said to me, c'My\ndear, you have described your great aunt to the minutest item of her dress\nand appearance.\" (Madame de Valmer had been brought up by Lady\nCarnarvon, her aunt.) \"And,\" continued Madame de Valmer, .. she came,\nyou say, from the swing door which led to your grandfather's room. She\ncame to fetch her brother. He died very soon after.\" Of course, I do not\nbelieve this explanation of the mysterious figure; still, the nurseries with\nwhich the diauaed door communicated had been Lady Carnarvon's apart-\nments, and she had died there.\nC. DE GILIBUT.\nIn a.ns1Pfer to inquiries, Madame de Gilibert says :-\nThe only two portraits of Lady Carnarvon at Petworth represent her\nvery young. In one she is with my grandfather, and is quite a child. In\nthe other-a Gainsborough looking head-ehe is quite a young woman, her\nbrown hair tied with a ribbon, nothing at all resembling the muftling head-\ndreaa I saw. C. DB GWBBRT.\n[I have had an interview with Madame de Gilibert, who seems a very\nintelligent and clear-headed person. She gave me precisely the same account\nfliwd IIO\u00ab.-E.G.]\nMadame de Gilibert has had no other hallucinations.\n\" I have never even,. aa far aa I can remember, dreamt a dream.\"\nIn each of these cases there has been some evidential point to\ndistinguish the apparition from a merely subjective hallucination. In\nthe first there was the unknown alteration in the familiar face; in the\nsecond there were more percipients than one; in the third the figure was\nunknown to the percipient, but seemingly recognised by others from her\naccount. We possess a few other cases resembling these except for the\nabsence of precisely this evidential quality. That is to say, they are\napparitions of a deceased friend, coinciding with the beginning of a.\nsurvivor's fatal illness, or symbolising in some way his approaching\ndeath. This amount of coincidence may, of course, be highly\nimpressive to the percipient, if he has never before expelienced any\nDigitized by Google\n\f24 On\u00b7Recognised Apparitions occurring [July 8,\nhallucination. But we cannot claim such ca.ses as evidential,. since it\nis possible that the hallucination may have been determined by the\noncoming illness; or, although occurring during health, it may, by\nalarming the percipient, have helped to fulfil its own prognostication.l\nThis would have been, perhaps, the fittest place for a case which\nwas printed in the last article (Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 422), where\nMrs. Bacchus sees the phantom of a man recognised from her descrip-\ntion as the deceased husband of a lady whose corpse was then lying in\nthe house where the ghost appeared. If we accept that recognition as\nvalid, we must suppose that the phantom was in some way induced by\nthe death of the wife.\nAnd to this category, in fact, belong the rather numerous ca.ses (see\nProceedings, Vol.V., p. 459, note) where a dying person sees the forms of\nfriends already dead. Dying men may, for aught we know, be specially\nliable to subjective disturbances of perception; and we cannot, therefore,\ntake account of cases where the dying man, and he alone, sees figures of\nfriends whom he knows to be dead. But in a few cases a dying man is\nreported to have seen, mixed with figures of those whom he knows to be\ndead, the figure of someone of whose decease he has not yet heard. As\nregards the dying man, we may call such a vision a kind of clairvoyance\nin extrtmis. But the apparition seen-if more than a mere fancy-\nmust be classed as a phantom which indicates knowledge of what is\npassing on earth, and is in some way conditioned by the death of the\nsurviving friend. Such death-bed visions are by their very nature not\nlikely to be shared by more than one person. We have only one case,\nA.nd that at second-hand, where a. watcher beside the dying bed sees\ndistinctly the same figures which the dying person sees. But death-bed\nexperiences have very rarely been observed with the right kind of care,\na.nd we may hope for a good deal more information when the scientific\ninterest of these visions, as from \"a peak in Darien\" (to use Miss\nCobbe's simile), is more generally understood.\nBut apart from knowledge as to the death of survivors, is any\nknowledge of other earthly matters ever displayed by a ghost 7 There\nare many stories of dangers averted by ghostly intervention; are we to\nassume that the departed watch over us, and guard our earthly days 1\nThe following case is a striking specimen of this class, the phantom\nhaving been seen by two persons. The brevity of the rebuke, conveyed\nmerely by a name twice repeated, is a point in favour of the narrative;\nfor long speeches put into the mouths of ghosts are pretty sure to be\nI In the Journal S.P.R. for December, 1888, p. 359, will be found an account of an\napparent prediction to a moribund person of the date of his death by his deceased\nfather's figure, seen in a dream.

It is noteworthy that one of the percipients in this case\nhad already experienced a \" vision of consolation\" under circumstances\nof strong emotion. Taken by itself, that consolatory vision might\ncertainly have been classed as purely subjective. But the fact that\nthe only other hallucina.tion which this percipient experienced was (as\nI should myself hold) a veridical one, may inspire BOme doubt as to\nwhether that earlier vision also may not have had BOme veridical basis.\nIV.-From a lady who desires that names may not be published.\nJune 9th, 1885.\nOur mother died while we were all very young; and as I, the fourth\nchild of seven, was the eldest living daughter, I became early acquainted\n(from my eighth year) with sorrow of varioua kinds and degrees, principally\ncaused, however, by the harshne88 and frequent neglect of housekeeper and\naervants towards my baby brother and sister. The two eldest boys-between\nwhom and myself was a gap of some years-were almost always away from\nhome, and ultimately went abroad, 80 that from the time I was quite a\n'little child I was continually with my father, who made much of me, and at\nlast I became his constant companion. He never married again, and our\nlove was probably, therefore, a closer union even than commonly exists\nbetween a father and daughter while the latter is of tender years. It was a\ngreat pain to me ever to be away from him, especially after my 14th\nyear, at which time he began to make me his confidante as well as companion;\nand we had frequent earnest talks and diacU88ions on many subjects. At\nlength, when I was about 18 yea.ra old, a terrible grief befell us, viz.,\nthe death of my two elder brothers within a few weeks of each other, while\nthey were still abroad.\nMy father's sorrow was great; and at the same time he became seriously\ntroubled with many doubts regarding various points of Christian faith, and\n80 gradually lost nearlyall his buoyancy of spirit, and became sadly depre88ed\nand worn-looking, though only 48 years old. For a year he thus su1fered,\nwhen it was arranged that, so soon as he could plan to leave home, he should\ngo to lOme seaside place, and try what new scenes would effect. He also\nperpuaded-;-nay, insisted-that I should go away for awhile, without waiting\nfor him. and accompany some friends to South Devonshire.\nThe writer then narrates how a sudden summons brought her back\nto find her father dead.\nI went early to bed, to escape the presence and sympathetic ministrations\nof the many in that kind household who gathered around me; and by my\nown choice I shared the room of a motherly-looking personage, whom I\nIUppoaed to be my cousin's nurse. She occupied the larger bed in the room,\nand I a smaller one placed at some distance from hers. She was soon asleep\nand breathing heavily; but I was lying in deepest anguish, beset not only\nwith the grief of the sudden 1088 sustained, but with the wretched fear that\nmy beloved father had died too suddenly to find peace with God, regarding\nthose miaerable doubts that had 80 troubled him. As the night wore on,\nthe pain of heart and thought grew worse and worse, and at length I knelt\nin prayer, earnestly pleading that my distreSBful thoughts might be taken\nDigitized by Google\n\f26 On Recognised Apparitions occurring [July 8,\naway, and ~ &88urance of my father's peace be given me by God's Moet\nHoly Spirit. No immediate relief came, however, and it W&8 early dawn\nwhen I rose from my knees, and felt that I must be patient and wait for the\nanswer of my prayer.\nNow a longing suddenly seized me to creep into that kind-faced woman's\nbed, and to feel perhaps 1888 lonely there. Her bed W&8 opposite a\nwindow, over which a white blind W&8 drawn, and &8 I softly lifted the bed-\nclothes and 8&t for a moment after drawing my feet up into the bed, I\nnoticed the pale dawn feebly lighting up the window, and the movement of\na little bird on the sill outside; but the room itself W&8 &8 yet almost dark.\nI was just about to slip quietly down into the bed, when on the opposite\naide of it (that on which the nurse W&B sleeping) the room became suddenly\nfull of beautiful light,in the midst of which stood my father absolutely trans-\nfigured, clothed with brightn888. He slowly moved towards the bed, raising\nhis hands, &8 I thought, to clup me in his arms ; and I ejaculated: \"Father! \"\nHe replied, \"BleBBed for ever, my child I For ever bleBBed !\" I moved to\nclimb over nurse and kiaa him, reaching out my arms to him ; but with a\nlook of mingled aadn888 and love he appeared to float back with the light.\ntowards the wall and was gone I The vision occupied so short a time that,\nglancing involuntarily at the window again, I 8&W the morning dawn and the\nlittle bird just as they had looked a few minutes before. I felt sure that God\nhad vouchsafed to me a wonderful vision, and was not in the least afraid,\nbut, on the contrary, full of a joy that brought floods of grateful tears, and\ncompletely removed a.ll anguish except that of having 100t my father from\nearth. I oft'er no explanation, and can only 8&y mOlt simply and truthfully\nthat it all happened just as I have related.\nYou may find a solution to the occurrence in the sympathy which had\nexisted between my dear father and myself; or, &8 friends have often\ninsisted, in the condition of excitement and exhaustion which I W&8 suft'er-\ning at the time; but after all these years of life and experience, the memory\nof that wonderful morning is ever vividly fresh, and real, and true.\nThe writer's husband adds, under date June 17tb, 1885:-\nThe narrative, as related above, is substantially the 8&me given to me by\nMrs. P. &8 early &8 1865, and at subsequent periods.\nw.

The door\nwas locked; and on that same side (to my left) my husband was lying, with\nthe curtain drawn, towarda which his face was turned.\nRoughly, the position was thus-\nr-- Furniture\nDooI\n-\nBed IJSet.\n[ Cot I\nBay Window\nL ,-1\n[\n-\n'---\n0\n..J\nDrawers and\nLamp\nChimney\nAA the bed had curtains only at the head, all before us was open and\ndimly-lighted, the lamp being turned down.\nThis takea some time to describe, but it was 8till just about 9.30,\nGertrude not yet awake, and I just pulling mY8elf into a balf-sitting posture\nagainst the pillows, thinking of nothing but the arrangements for the follow-\ning day, when to my great astonishment I 8&W a gentleman 8tanding at the\nfoot of the bed, dreaaed as a naval officer, and with a cap on his head having a\nprojecting peak. The light being in the position which I have indicated, the\nface was in 8hadow to me, and the more 80 that the visitor was leaning upon\nhis arms which rested on the foot-rail of the bedstead.

As\nI turned towards him he sprang out of bed as though to attack the man, but\nstood by the bedside as if afraid,or in great perplexity,while the figure calmly\nand slowly moved towards tM 1lXIll at right angles with the lamp in the dirac-\n.tion of the dotted line. As it passed the lamp, a deep shadow fell upon the\nroom as of a material person shutting out the light from us by his intervening\nbody, and he'diBBppeared, as it were, into the wall. My husband now, in a\nvery agitated manner, caught up the lamp, and turning to me 88id, \"I mean\nto look all over the house, and see where he is gone.\"\nI was by this time exceedingly agitated too, but remembering that the\ndoor was locked, and tha~ the mysterious visitor had not gone towards it at\nall, remarked, \"He has not gone out by the door!\" But without pausing,\nmy husband unlocked the door, hastened outof the room, and was soon search-\ning the whole house. Sitting there in the dark, I thought to myself, \" We\nhave surely seen an .apparition I Whatever can it indicate-perhaps my\nbrother Arthur (he was in the navy, and at that time on a voyage to India)\nis in trouble: such things have been told of as occurring.\" In some luch\nway I pondered with an anxious heart, holding the child, who just then\nawakened, in my arms, until my husband came back looking very white and\nmiserable.\nSitting upon the bedside, he put his arm about me and 88id, \"Do you\nknow what we have seen 1\" And I 88id, \"Yes, it was a spirit. I am afraid\nit was Arthur, but could not see his face \"-and he exclaimed, \"Oh I no, it\nwas my father I \"\nMy husband's father had been dead fourteen vears: he had been a naval\nofficer in his young life; but, through ill-health, had left the service before\nmy husband was born, and the latter had only once or twice Been him in\n~niform. I had never seen him at all. My husband and I related the occur-\nrence to my uncle and aunt, and we all noticed that my husband's agitation\nand anxiety were very great: whereas his usual manner was calm and\nreserved in the extreme, and he was a thorough and avowed sceptic in all-\nso-called-supematural event&.\nAs the weeks passed on my husband became very ill, and then gradually\ndisclosed to me that he had been in great financial difficulties; and that, 1\\t\nthe time his father was thus sent to us, he was inclining to take the advice\nof a man who would certainly-had my husband yielded to him (as he had\nintended before hearing the warning voice)-have led him to ruin, perhaps\nworse. It is this fact which makes us most reticent in speaking of the event;\nill addition to which, my husband had already been led to speculate upon\ncertain chances which resulted in failure, and infinite sorrow to us both as\nwell as to others, and was indeed the cause of our coming to --, after a\nyear of much trouble, in the January of 1871.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than\u00b7a Year after Death. 29\nNone of IlS were particularly ready to believe in such evidences,\nnotwithstanding my experience at my father's death, because we had reo\ngarded that as a special answer to prayer; 80 that no condition of \"over\u00b7\nwrought nerves,\" or \"superstitious fears,\" could have been the cause of the\nmanifestation, but only, 80 far as we have been able to judge by subsequent\nevents, a direct warning to my husband in the voice and appearance of the\none that he had most reverenced in all his life, and was the most likely to\nobey.\nDr. a.nd l\\lrs.

W. B. P.\nI will add one other first-hand narrative, which comes from a\nrespectable source, although the death of all persons concerned in it\nprevents cOlToboration.\nV.-From :Mr. Happerfield, Postmaster.\nRoad, Bath, May 12th, 1884.\nWhen myoId friend John Harford, who had been a Wesleyan lay\npreacher for half a century, lay dying, in June of 1851, he sent for me, and\nwhen I went to his bedside he said, \" I am glad you have come, friend\nHapperfield ; I cannot die easy until I am assured that my wife will be\nlooked after and cared for until she may be called to join me in the other\nworld. I have known you for many years, and now want you to promise to\nlook to her well-being during the little time which she may remain after me.\"\nI said, \" I will do what I can, so let your mind be at rest.\" He said, \" I can\ntrust you,\" and he soon after, on the 20th day of the month, fell asleep in\nthe Lord. I administered his affairs, and when all was settled there remained\na balance in favour of the widow, but not sufficient to keep her. I put her\ninto a small cottage, interested some friends in her C&l!e, and saw that\nshe was comfortable. After a while Mrs. Harford's grandson came and\npropoeed to take the old lady to his house in GIoucestershire, where he held\na situation as schoolmaster. The request seemed reasonable. I consented,\nproviding she was quite willing to go ; and the young man took her accord\u00b7\ningly. Time passed on. We had no correspondence. I had done my duty\nto my dying friend, and there the matter rested. But one night, as I lay in\nbed wakeful, towards morning, turning over busineBB and other matters in\nmy mind, I suddenly became conscious that someone was in the room. Then\nthe curtain of my bed was drawn aside, and there stood my\u00b7departed friend,\ngazing upon me with a sorrowful and troubled look. I felt no fear, but\nsurprise and astonishment kept me silent. He spoke to me, distinctly and\naudibly in his own familiar voice, and Aid : \"Friend Happerfield, I have\n\f30 On BecogniBed Apparitions occu,rri,ng [July 8,\ncome to you because you have not kept your promise to see to my wife. She\nis in trouble and in want.\" I 818Ured him that I had done my duty, and\nwas not aware that she was in any difficulty, and that I would see about her\nfirst thing, and have her attended to. He looked satisfiedand vanished from\nmy sight. I awoke my wife, who was asleep at my side, and told her what\nhad occurred. Sleep departed from us, and on arising, the first thing I did\nwas to write to the grandson. In reply he informed me that he bad been\ndeprived of his situation through persecution, and was in great straits,\ninsomuch that he had decided on sending his grandmother to the Union.\nForthwith I sent some money and a request to have the old lady forwarded\nto me immediately. She came, and was again provided with a homeandhad\nher wants supplied. These are the circumstances as they occurred. I am\nnot a nervous man ; nor am I superstitious. At the time myoId friend came\nto me I was wide awake, collected, and calm. The above is very correct, not\noverdrawn. C. lIAPPERFlBLD.\nThis last case, however, suggests a fresh difficulty,>-namely,\nas to the real origin of the monitory voice. There is a good\ndeal of evidence, from the Dalmon of Socrates downwards, to the\noccurrence of monitions or warnings which in various ways inform\nthe percipient of some approaching danger. And sometimes these\nmonitions are associated-by an impression, or by an actual vision-\nwith some deceased person, who is supposed to be acting as a guardian\nor protector to the person thus admonished.\nBut it is a well-known fact,-pointed out by ElIiotson, and\nrepeatedly noticed since his day,-that hypnotised or somnambulic\nsubjects have a tendency to develop a pseudo-guardian,-to refer the\nknowledge or sensation which comes from sub-eonscious strata of their\nown mind to some imaginary spirit, whom they sometimes see beside\nthem in visible form. Thus, in the classical case of \"Estelle,\"-that\npatient of the elder Despine, whose history is so curiously concordant\nwith the most recent observations,-Estelle in her secondary condition\nsupposed herself to be directed by a spirit, \"Angelique,\" who was\nobviously a mere personification of her own supernormal knowledge of\nthe state of her own organism. Similarly in cases of automatic writing,\nthe message which really comes from the unconscious self of the writer\nwill sign itself by the name of some deceased relative. It is therefore\npossible, and even probable, that in some of the cases where warnings\nhave been conveyed by some phantasmal figure simulating a dead\nfriend, the real source of the warning has been somewhere in the\npercipient himself. And thus, for instance, in the Happerfield case,\njust cited, the phantom may have been the mere dramatic projection,\neither of knowledge telepathically acquired by the percipient, or of a\nmere sub-conscious current of anxiety as to the welfare of a protlg\/~ of\nwhom he had heard no news for some time.\nWhile thus discussing the indications of a knowledge of earthly\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] .More than a Year after Death. 31\nevents afforded by phantoms, there is one curious type of cases which I\nought to mention, although by their very nature they can hardly occur\nmore than a year after death-I mean cases where some manifestation\noccurs just before the news of the death is received by the percipient.\nIn a case given in the last paper (Proceeding\" Vol. V., p. 408), the\nRev. G. M. Tandy saw Canon Robinson's apparition just before he\nopened a newspaper-given to him in its wrapper by a friend-which\ncontained the announcement of the Canon's death. In that case no\ntelepathic communication from living persons seems possible; for\nneither would the Canon's surviving friends think specially of Mr.\nTandy, nor could they possibly know when the news of the death would\nreach him.\nWe have received a similar case from Mr. Magnusson, Assistant\nLibrarian in the Cambridge University Library, where a strong\nimpression of the death of a friend in Iceland came upon him-not\nat the time of the death, but at the time when the letter announcing\nthe death hadjust reached England. As this was only an impression,-\nthough\" painfullystrong one,-and was not recorded at the time, I do not\nquote the incident at length. But a case of Mr. Cameron Grant's, briefly\nmentioned by Mr. Gurney in Plw,ntasmB ojtlUJ Living (II., p. 690), seems,\non further study of his diary, to illustl\"lilote the present point so curiously\nthat I must refer to it here. After mentioning two other cases in\nwhich entries in Mr. Grant's diary confirm his recollection of strong\nimpressions nearly coincident with deaths, Mr. Gurney continues :-\n\"I have studied in Mr. Grant's diary the full record of a third case\nwhich was even more remarkable than the first, as it included the\npeculiarity that, for some time after his first impression, he felt forcibly\nimpelled to draw the figure of the person who died. The case was made\nthe more striking to me by the fact that Mr. Grant was so certain that\nthe death (the time of which he had only very vaguely learnt) must\nhave coincided in date with his impression, that he had actually not taken\nthe trouble to verify the coincidence. He left it to me to find in the\nTimu obituary-as he confidently foretold that I should-that the\ndeath (which was quite unexpected) occurred, thousands of miles from\nthe place where he was, on the day preceding that on which the entry\nin his diary, relating his impression of the previous night, was written.\nThe impression of that night did not, however,bear distinct reference to\nthe particular person who died, but was a more general sense of calamity.\nCertain reasons which at present make it desirable not to publish the\ndetails of this case may in time cease to exist.\"\nNow,on a fuller inspection of Mr. Grant's voluminousjournal,(largely\na business record,) which he has kindly permitted me to make, it appeared\nthat the impulse to draw the dying man was the most marked feature\nin the- whole incident, and furthermore that this impulse came on some\nDigitized by Google\n\f32 On Recognised Apparitions occurring [July 8,\nmonths after the death-but on the night previous to the day on which\nMr. Grant saw, in a casual newspaper received in Brazil, the announce-\nment of his friend's demise in Scotland.l\nThe possibility of a telepathic impulse from the surviving members\nof the family of course suggests itself: but Mr. Grant was in a wild up-\ncountry station in Brazil; and it seems impossible that anyone could\nguess at wha.t date the news would reach him. The rough sketch which\nMr. Grant was impelled to make contained two figures (of which the\nsecond was a servant) and a window; and it truly represented, as he\nafterwards learnt, the circumstances of the death.\nThis narrative in some sense fits in with a few cases (cf.Plumtasma\nof the Living, I., 272, and possibly II., 52) where an impression or\nhallucination seems to have continued for some time and then ceased\nwhen the news of a death arrived. On the other hand, there are a few\ncases (see Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 519) which suggest that if indepen-\ndent clairvoyance exist, the perception of letters arriving, or about to\narrive, In&y form one of its readiest manifestations. The subject is one\nto which observation should be specially directed.\nOn the whole, therefore, our cases where knowledge of earthly\naffairs on the decedent's part is clearly indicated are few indeed. I\nmay add a case of Mr. Da.le Owen's,' where the knowledge which the\nghost seems to show is not of a death, but of a more mundane event.\nVI.-In March, 1846, Mrs. R., wife of Dr. R., of Philadelphia,was sitting\nwith her two daughters in her dining-room about midday. They all three\nsaw a figure enter, move through the room, contemplate a portrait of Dr.\nR., and disappear. Mrs. R. and the elder daughter, who saw the figure hest,\nidentified it in dress and aspect with Dr. R.'s mother, who had died about\n10 years before.\nThe ladies narrated this incident to the Rev. Mr. Y., and he independently\ngave to Mr. Owen (at whatdate is not said) an account .. tallying exactly\"\nwith the account given to him by the two ladies mainly concerned.\nOn the return home of Dr. R. that evening it further appeared that the\napparition involved a remarkable coincidence. .. Shortly before her death,\"\n1 I am not sure how many hours the impulse lasted, Mr. Grant having been obliged\nto return toBrazil before sending me a copy of the pa88&gIl in his joumaI.\nt The DebtJtea.bk Land, 2nd Ed., p. S19.-Mr. Robert Dale Owen's works contain\nseveral narratives which might find place in this collection. I have preferred to leave\nthe reader to consult them for himself, and judge of the value to be attached to them.\nMr. Owen cannot be cIa.aaed as a first-rate obBerver; having been once at leaat grossly\ndeceived by fraudulent mediums. Noris his standard of what constitutes etJid_ very\nhigh, as is shown by the admiasion to his volumes of RUndry remote and inconclusive\nstories. But, on the other hand, his own honesty and his strong wish to be accurate are\nundoubted. He wrote out the acoounts given tohim with care, and, &8 a rule, submitted\nthem for revision to the narrator. Where the narrators wereknown to him &8 persons of\nprobity and position, and give their account at first-hand, we maybe pretty sure that the\nmain facts arecorrect. It is greatly to beregretted that the fullnamea are 80 rarely given,\nand that Mr. Owen's papers either have not been preserved, orare not now accessible.l.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More tka;n, a Year after Death. 33\nsays Mrs. Owen, \"Dr. R.'s mother had strongly advised her son to buy a house\nin the neighbourhood, which he ultimately purchased. She had also about\nthat time stated to a friend of hers, Mrs. C., that if her son did well, she\nwould, if permitted, return from the other world to witness his prosperity.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 As nearly as could be ascertained, at the very hour [of the apparition]\nthe deeds by which Dr. R. became the legal proprietor of the house in which\nshe appeared were delivered to him by its former possessor.\"\nThe inference suggested is that here the prosperous action-as in other\ncases the impending or the actual decease of the survivor-a1;tracted the\nattention, and thence in some way induced the appearance, of the long-\ndeparted friend.\nWe proposed roughly to divide the apparently motived actions of\nthese apparitions into the reasonable and the unreasonable :-that is to\nsay, into actions which seem to imply real intention on the decedent's\npart, and actions which suggest the mere unconscious working out of\nsome old prejudice or bygone impulse. Under which class of motives\nare we to place the desire to pay one's debts 1 This desire is in itself\nlegitimate; but nevertheless, when the debts are trifling, there seems\nsomething undignified in a post-mortem preoccupation with a small\naccount which the decedent has left no funds to settle; so that all he\ncan now do is to get a stranger to pay it for him. Yet such is\n. the situation suggested in a narrative which Dr. Binns, an author of\nsome scientific repute in his day, gives in his Anatomy of Sleep, p. 462,\nadding that \"perhaps there is not a better authenticated case on\nrecord.\" It consists of a letter written October 21st, 1842, by the\nRev. Charles M'Kay, a Catholic priest, to the Countess of Shrewsbury.\nThe Earl of Shrewsbury sent on the letter to Dr. Binns. It is quoted\nby Dale Owen (Foot\/olla, p. 294). I abbreviate it here:-\nV1I.-\" In July, 1838, I left Edinburgh to take charge of the Perthshire\nmissions. On myarrival inPerth, I was called upon by a Presbyterian woman,\nAnne Simpson, who for more than a week had been in the utmost anxiety to\naee a priest. [This woman stated that a woman lately dead (date not given)\nnamed Maloy, slightly known to Anne Simpson, had ' appeared to her during\nthe night for several nights ' urging her to go to the priest, who would pay a\nsum of money, three and tenpence, which the deceased owed to a person\nnot specified.]\n\" I made inquiry, and found that a woman of that name had died, who had\nacted as washerwoman and followed the regiment. Following up the inquiry\nI found a grocer with whom she had dealt, and on asking him if a female\nnamed Maloy owed him anything, he turned up his books, and told me she did\nowe him three and tenpence. I paidthe sum. Subsequently the Presbyterian\nwoman came to me, saying that she was no more troubled.\"\nThis account, though first-hand, is remote, and I know of no recent\ncases that are quite parallel. But the point on which I here insist is\nthat the triviality of the ghost's alleged motive is no reason for\ndisbelieving the narrative. We have no right to assume that ..\nD\nDigitized by Google\n\f34 On Recognised Apparitions OCCU\/M-1\/ng [July 8,\ndecedent, by the mere fact of his decease, will see things in a larger\nlight, or shake oft' the anxieties, the prepOBBessions, the superstitions\nof earth. Or even if we assume that he does in some sort enter on a\nlarger existence, it does not follow that the conduct of his apparition\nwill reflect his new knowledge rather than the impulses originated by\nhis earthly being.1\nIn fact, as we shall presently try to show, there is some reason to\nsuppose that the apparition is due to something like the working out of a\npost-hypnotic suggestion. It may be entirely absorbed in the fulfilment\nof an idea implanted in the decedent's mind in his earthly days, or\nimpressed upon him at the moment of death. Thus we may conceive a\nmurdered man, for instance, as feeling persistently that he ought not\nto have been murdered,-that his existence should still be continuing\nin his earthly home. And if his apparition is seen in that home, we\nneed not 8&y that he is \"condemned to walk there,\" but rather that\nhis memory or his dream goes back irresistibly to the scene to which in\na sense he feels that he still belongs.\nI 8&Y\" his memory or his dream \" ; but it is of course pOBBible\nthat neither word may suggest a close parallel to what actually occurs.\nThere may be a deeper severance in the personality of the dead-\na psychical fractionation such as that on which Indian and other\nphilosophies have been wont to dwell-which may allow of a greater\nindependence and persistence in the apparition than we usually\nassociate with the notion of a dream. There is nothing per Be improbable\nin the idea that our personality-so much more fractionable even during\nour earthly life than we were wont to imagine-should be susceptible,\nwhen liberated from the body, of still profounder divisions. For the\npresent, howev~r, it seems better to keep to more familiar analogies,\nand to use the word \"dream\" as the widest term available; though,\nof course, without assuming that the decedent is in any sense asleep.\nLet us suppose, then, that the decedent tends to dream of scenes and\nevents in the past, and that the way which he has of old been\naccustomed to regard such scenes or events is still dominant in\nthat dream. We shall not then be surprised to find that what I have\n1 It has been remarked that dying pel'BOllB aeem inwardly sometimes to be pre-\noccupied with some very small and remote matter.

And\namongst these we shall observe a frequent preoccupation with the mortal\nremains or skeleton of the departed person. There is at any rate a\nwell-marked group of cases where the phantom seems to wish to draw\nattention to the fact that a skeleton is concealed in some unexpected\nplace. When skeletons are found thus hidden, it is of course probable that\nthere has been foul play; and the cause of the phantom may be\nsupposed to have been in the first instance the desire of the deceased\nto reveal the murder ; although the haunting may continue when all\npossibility of bringing the criminal to justice may have passed away.\nThere is, however, another possible way of accounting for this\nconnection between apparitions and skeletons. We may ascribe the\nhallucinatory figure, not to any action on the part of the dead, but to\nthe hyperaesthesia of the living. It has often been supposed that\ncertain \"sensitives\" are aware in some obscure manner of the proximity\nof dead bodies. Developing this possibility (Proceeding8, VoL IV.,\np. 154), I cited two cases where such susceptibility might serve to explain\na feeling of horror experienced (1) in a room in whose roof (one story\nhigher) the dried-up body of a murdered baby was afterwards found ;\n(2) in (and above) a room beneath whose flooring several skeletons were\nsubsequently discovered. In each of these cases there was proximity\nunder the same roof. But in the case which I shall now cite there was\nno such proximity between the percipient and the skeleton. The\nskeleton, as will be seen, was buried in an open field which the\npercipient merely traversed from time to time. The bones were some 40\nyears old; and kelp had been burnt above the spot where they lay. It\nseems incredible that a man should be thus affected by a distant\nskeleton and yet capable of fulfilling the ordinary duties of life; which\nin the case of a serious Scotch bailiff must undoubtedly have included\nattendance, in the midst of buried skeletons, at church. The facts of\nthis case are unusually clear and well-evidenced ; the interpretation is\nmore than commonly difficult.\nVIII.-DISCOVERY 011' A HUMAN SKELBTON BY REVBLATION IN A DREAM.\nFrom the Banfflkire Journal of January 30th, 1872.\nA moat unusual and extraordinary occurrence has excited considerable\ninterest in the district around Banft'during the past few days, the chain of\ncircumstances leading to which we are in a position to relate authoritatively.\nWilliam Moir is grieve at the farm of Upper Dallachy, in the pariah of\nBoyndie, about three and a-half miles west of Ban1I', and a mile west of the\nfishing village of Whitehills. Moir is an intelligent, steady, and modest\nman, 35 years of age, and married. Shortly After Whit Sunday last, he\ndreamed that, on a particular spot near the farm of Dallachy, he saw lying\na dead body with blood upon the face. The dream was 80 vivid that every\npoint connected with it was deeply impressed upon his memory. The 8pot\nD 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f36 On Recognised ilpparitions occurring [July 8,\non which he dreamed he saw the body lie W\/UJ a slight mound on the sloping\nground which bounds the farm and stretches to the seaside, and about 16ft.\nfrom the high water mark. For a time after the dream, Moir did not think\nmuch about it; but the idea of the dead man afterwards haunted him, and\nhe could not exclude it from his mind. By-and-bye the matter took so firm\na hold upon his thoughts that never was he a moment unoccupied but the\nidea and the vision returned to him.\nAn incident happened in the month of July last, which Moir, at the time,\nthought was the interpretation of his dream. A person who had been an\ninmate of the Banffshire Lunatic Asylum,at Ladysbridge, was found drowned at\na point about 2OOyardsfrom where Moirdreamt he saw the deadbody lie. There\nis a boat belonging to the farm at Upper Dallachy, in which Moir and some of\nthe men-llervants occasionally went to Lea and amused themselves with fishing;\nand it was while out in this boat that the dead body of the lunatic was\nobserved. It so happened that Moir was the first person to put his hand upon\nthe dead body ; and he and his companion proceeded to carry the body to\nthe village of Whitehills. When the two men were so carrying the dead body\nof the lunatic, they passed over the exact spot where Moir in his dream had\nseen the dead man lying, and the recollection of his dream became very vivid\n\u00b7at that moment. When about six yards beyond the spot, Moir's companion\nslipped his foot, and the end of the board upon which lay the lunatic's body\nfell to the ground. Moir, keeping hold of his end of the board, observed\nthat there was blood upon the face of the corpse, and he looked upon the\nincident as the fulfilment of his dream.\nStill, however, the vision of the dream came back upon the man. He\ncould not go out walking or sit down at home in the evening without the\nrecollection coming before his mind. Indeed, he began to think that his\nintellect was being affected, and he was conscious of becoming taciturn,\nmorose, and absent. The disagreeable feeling continued to increase in in-\ntensity, and, during last week, it became positively painful. On Wednesday\nlast, iu the discharge of his ordinary duties, he went to an outlying portion\nof the farm, and, while he was there occupied, the idea of the dream left\nhim. On Wednesday evening, however, it came back with increased force.\nOn Thursday morning he went down to Stakeness, a portion of ground\nrecently attached to the farm, and about 400 yards from the spot with which\nhis vision was associated, and, while there engaged, his oppressive thoughts\nwere dissipated. He returned to his house on the farm, and, after sitting\nawhile, he intended to proceed to the portion of the farm at which he had\nbeen on Wednesday, which lay on the side furthest from the sea.\nWhile Moir was on the way from the house, the idea of his dream\noccurred to him with Buch intense vividness that he turned and went back\nto the house. Saying nothing to anyone in the house, he took a Bpade, and\nwalked direct to the spot of which he had BO distinct a recollection in con-\nnection with his dream, and removed a little of the turf from the surface.\nAfter he had done so, he put the spade down its full length into the ground,\nand lifted up the earth. In the Bpadeful of earth, however, there was an\nentire human Bkull. The man was not at all affected by the appearance of\nthe skull, the idea in his mind being that the turning-up of the skull was\nDigitized by Goo~\n\f1889.] More than a Year after Death. 37\nnothing more than what was to have been expected. He took other spade-\nfuls of earth, and brought up the lower jaw with teeth, followed by the\nshoulder bonea, and, digging further along, dug up other bones of a human\nbody as far as the thigh. Laying the bonea out on the surface of the ground\njnat in the position he had found them buried, he realised that he was digging\nup a skeleton. At that juncture Moir stopped digging, and went to an\nelevated spot about 50 yards from the grave, where he called upon William\nLorimer, the cattleman at the farm, who was pulling turnips in a field.\nLorimer went to Moir, and both returned to the spot, when Moir recom-\nmenced digging, and brought out the lower bones of the skeleton. Both men\nthen threw the bones into the cavity, and covered them up. Moir's first\nintention was to let the bones lie, but, on second thoughts, he went to the\nvillage of Whitehilla to consult Mr. Taylor, merchant there, as to what he\nshould do. Moir had not been 10 minutes in the shop when Inspector\nM'Gregor, of the county police, who had been in Whitehilla, accidentally\ncalled at the shop. Moir reported to the inspector what had taken place,\nand the two proceeded to the spot where the bones lay. By the time they\narrived there it was dusk, but the inspector had the skull and BOme of the\nbonea uncovered at once.\nOn Friday morning Inspector M'Gregor returned to the place, and had\nthe whole of the skeleton taken up.\nThe place where the remains were found, and which had been so long\n&88OCiated with the disagreeable dream in the mind of Moir, is not at all a\nlikely spot for an ordinary grave. The body could have only been covered\nwith about 18in. of mould, and underneath it there were only two or three\ninchea of shingle, covering a surface of rock. The bonea were considerably\ndecomposed, and they may have lain there for about half a century. The spot\nwas enclosed by a circle of stones, froni eight to 10 yards in circurilference ;\nand the stones and shingle were 80 discoloured as to indicate that they had\nbeen subjected to the influence of fire. It is believed that the enclosed circle\nwas the site of a kiln for burning kelp. At one time kelp-burning was a\nbusine88 of BOme importance in the district, and there were more than a dozen\nof these kilns upon the beach, within a few milea to the weat of Banff, the\nlast of which were only discontinued about half a century ago.\nThe finding of the remains has been reported to the 'Procurator-Fiscal,\nand the bones have been taken charge of by the police, pending an investiga-\ntion and instructions as to their disposal.\nCuriosity will naturally exist as to how the finding of the skeleton has\nafter a time affected the mind of Mr. Moir. After meeting with Inspector\nM'Gregor, the subject of the dream ceased to har&88 him, and he has since\nenjoyed an entire immunity from his previous mental troubles.\nThe whole circumstances of the case, &8 we have related them, are con-\nfirmed by a variety of evidence, which shows them to be as undoubted as they\nare unusual and remarkable.\nSupplementary statement by Mr. Moir, Dallachy, at a conversation\nheld in the Journal office, Banff, on Friday, July 19th, 1872.\nMr. William Moir is a native of the pariah of Monymusk, in Aberdeen-\nshire. He is 35 years of age, is married to a Mias Humphrey, from\nDigitized by Google\n\f38 On Recognised Apparitiom occurring [July 8,\nBanffshire. Both Moir and his wife saw Dallachy for the first time\nwhen they came to live there four ysal'll ago. Moir had become\nfamiliar with all the ground on the farm by walking over it, in the ordinary\nCOUl'lle of his duties. There was nothing particular to attract his attention\nto the spot mentioned in the narrative, and he had not paid any attention to\nit more than to any other part of the farm, till in June, 1870, he dreamed\nthat he came to the spot and saw a man lying on it, with his clothes on, but\nbare-headed. The man seemed to be lying on that particular spot, the same\nas if he were drunk or in a senseless condition. The first time Moir had\noccasion to pass the spot after he had the dream, it occurred to him when he\ncame to it that it was the spot on which he had seen the man lying. He\nnever dreamed before nor since about anything of the same kind, and is\ngenerally a very BOund aleeper. Moir could not say whether the man was\ndead or alive when he saw him in the dream, but he dreamed that he stood\nand looked at the man, and on seeing the head bare and the face covered with\nblood, he said to himself in an offhand sort of way, \"That man has come off\nwith the wont of it.\" Subsequent to the dream Moir forgot about the man,\nbut his mind was always troubled about the spot ofground upon which he saw\nthe man lying.\nMoir carefully read over the narrative and said it was quite correct. He\nhad read the narrative over and made corrections when it was written before\nbeing printed, and immediately after the event occurred.\nCertified by\n(Signed) A. RAMSAY, Editor Ba'ILffshire Journal.\nThe next letter is from Mr. Alexander Thurburn, of Keith, to Mr.\nT. A. Stewart, one of H.M. Inspectors of Schools.\nKeith, March 12th, 1883.\nMy DEAR STEwART,-I send herewith a reprint from the BanffBkir.\nJournaZ of the story of Moir's dream, from which is omitted a suggestion\nM to the identity of the skeleton which proved erroneous. I also enclose a\ncopy of a supplementary statement which gives a few further particulars and\nexplains the steps taken for checking the accuracy of the original narrative.\nThe supplementary statement is written from notes which Nicol wrote in\nshorthand while Mr. Ramsay was questioning Moir on some points which I\nhad asked him to investigate.\nAs the matter was investigated by the criminal authorities there can be\nno doubt of the substantial accuracy of the facts. The Fiscal might tell you if\ndesired what was done. I learned from Mr. Ramsay that there was\nno story of murder, robbery, or the like associated with the spot where the\nbody WM found. If hyperresthesia can be admitted as the cause, Moir was\njust the sort of man in whom we could imagine such a condition to arise. He\nseems to have been of an exceedingly sensitive, nervous temperament, and if\nI remember right he fell into a state of religious depreBBion such M seriously\nto unhinge his mind before his death, which took pla.ce in or about October,\n1873. Mias Cobbe's theory in the Echo, therefore, seems to me the most\npoBBible one. I made some inquiries (with the view of testing another\nsuggestion of MiBS Cobbe's) regarding his early history and the pOSBibility of\nhis having heard the story in boyhood and forgotten about it. It is, of\ncourse, impoBBible to obtain absoZuk proof of the negative in such a case,\n\f1889.] More than a Year aJt6r Death. 39\nbut Moir, the gardener, told me of the movements of all the members of the\nfamily, and I could find no trace of any meaD8 whereby they, who came\ncomparatively recently to the county, could have knowu circumstances\nconnected with the mystery of which the people in the immediate district\nwere ignorant. If I can furnish any further details I shall be glad to do 80.\nALBX. TBUlUIVBN.\nMr. Thurburn adds further particulars &8 follows :-\nKeith, Ma,lI26tA, 1874-\nI have been making inquiry as to the points on which you suggeated\nthat information might be got about the late Mr. Moir, who dreamed of the\ncorpse at Dallachy, but all that I have learned is of a negative character. I\ndiscovered that there was an uncle of his, a James Moir, a jobbing gardener\nin Keith, to whom I am indebted for my facta,-the minister of Monymuak\nto whom I wrote having told me that nothing could be learned there as all\nthe family had left that parish years ago.\nI find from James Moir that the deceased's grandfather was a native of\nInsch, in Aberdeenshire, and had a family of six, of whom the deceased'.\nfather was the third, and James (my informant) the fifth, and that he\nremoved to the parish of Monymusk when James was a mere child. The\ndeceased's father was alao very young when he was taken with the others to\nMonymusk, and he continued in that parish where the deceased was alao\nbrought up until he left it to go to service.\nJames Moir, the gardener, knows ofno previous connection with the Ban1l\"\ndistrict, nor of any friends of the family from that neighbourhood who could\nhave communicated to any of them the history of any events that might\nhave occurred there. The tragedy at Dallachy must have been kept a\nprofound secret, since the inquiries of the authorities have a1l\"orded no clue\nto its aolution, and therefore anyone acquainted with the facts is not likely\nto have spoken of them except to a very confidential friend. I think it may\nsafely be asaumed that had such a close confidence existed between anyone\nfrom the neighbourhood of Ban1I\" who could have knowu about the story,\nand any of the Moir family, during the lifetime of the late Mr. Moir, his\nuncle, the gardener, would have knowu of it; 80 that it appears extremely\nimprobable that the story can have been told in Moir's hesring in his child-\nhood and been forgotten by him.\nMr. Stewart kindly inquired personally into the case, and writes &8\nfollows :-\nKeith, April 7th, 1883.\nDBA.B Sm,-I have to-day interviewed Mrs. Moir, and I enclose a state-\nment signed by her. She is an intelligent, fresh-faced woman, apparently\nbetween 40 and 50. She was very willing to answer my questions, and said\nabe had received many letters and answered many inquiries already. I\nasked her if she had seen the spot where the skeleton was found, and whether\nits appearance suggeeted a grave 1 She said she had often seen it, that it had\nno appearance of being a grave, and that the fishermen passed overit on their\nway from the sea. I asked her if, after the skeleton had been uneArthed, her\nhusband still had these dreams 1 She said he had not, but that the shock to\nhis system led to his death. She described all the circumstances, how her\nDigitized by Google\n\f40 On Recognised Apparitions occurring [July 8,\nhusband had this weight on his mind, which she often urged him, even on\nher knees, to impart to her, as she knew that something was preying upon\nhim. But, in her own words, \"he had not the power\" to do it. I asked\nher if she meant that he was unwilling to tell her about it, because it might\nmake her uneasy, and she said this was not the way of it, but that he felt\nhimself bound not to reveal his experience, even to her. He often went out\nand prayed to be delivered from the burden, and at last thought that his\nreason was going. And\u00b7 now comes part of the history I had not heard before.\nShe ssid that the old people in Boyndie knew of the sudden disappearance of\na man named Elder some 40 or 50 years ago. He was said to have gone to\nAmerica, but had not been traced, and it was generslly believed that he had\nbeen murdered, and that, too, in the room. intohich. Moir elept. Drs. Hirschfeld\nand Mawson, who examined the skeleton, gave as their opinion that it had\nlain there for about 40 years. Mrs. Moir also ssid that the soil, some 16\ninches deep, covering the skeleton must have been brought there for the pur-\npose, as there was no soil of that kind in the neighbourhood. Her opinion was\nthat the case had been hushed up to\u00b7sparethe feelings of their friends. Now,\nof course, you must take all this for what it is worth. Mrs. Moir made the\nstatements to me to-<lay.\nT. A. STBWAllT.\nP.S.-I omitted to mention that Mrs. Moir said that the skull bore\nmarks of violence.-T. A.

He told me after that he felt he could not, although\nthe thought of it was sometimes like to deprive him of his reason. He then\nspoke of it quite openly,and ssid it gave him no more trouble; but why this poor\nman should have bad any trouble with it at all seems to me incomprehensible.\nHe was more than an ordinary, honest, hardy, straightforward man, much\nrespected by Mr. Wilson and also his former masters. Neither he nor any of\nhis relatives had ever been in that part of the country until he was sent from\nMilton to take charge of the farm.\nMiss M. F. Reid, whose father was in 1872 parish minister of Auchendoir,\nAberdeenshire, gives a concordant, but more detailed account, and adds :-\nFebntary 24th, 1883.\nAny addition to the statement of Mrs. Wilson, which you may find in my\naccount, I have taken from notes of the story I made at the time, as related\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than a Year after Death.\nto me by reliable persons in the district where I lived, who knew Moir\nbefore his migration to this sea-board farm. I remember distinctly being\ntold then that Moir's reticence--as he said afterwards-during these months\nin which he did not divulge his dream proceeded from an unaccountable\nfeeling, as if he himself had somehow been witness of, or implicated in, the\nmurderous act. This does not quite come out in the Wilson narrative, but\nI know this fact impressed itself on me at the time, and I remember\nthinking that did I believe the doctrine of metempsychosis, this circumstance\nwould have indicated that in some other phase of existence Moir had\nwitnessed the deed, which on his revisiting the spot he now became coJllCious\nof through the medium ofthis confused dream. The revolution in his fee1ings,\nafter the whole circumstance became known, was most remarkable. Moir\nthen spoke feelingly of the matter in all its details, and said his former\nmorbid feelings seemed like the memory of a painful dream.\nMARy F. REm.\nIf in this case we reject-as it seems to me that we are forced to\nreject-both the hypothesis of chance coincidence and the hypothesis of\nhypenesthesia, we are confronted with a conception of a strange and\npainful kind. A man-himself, as the tradition hints, not blameless-\nis murdered in a bedroom of a. Scotch farmhouse. His body is carried\nout and hastily buried in the open field. For 40 years the murdered\nman retains some consciousness of this tragedy. He broods over the\nfact of his death in that room, his interment in that stony hillock. At\nlast the bedroom is occupied by a man sensitive to the peculiar influence\nwhich (on our hypothesis) these broodings of deceased persons diffuse.\nThe dream of the dead passes into the dream of the living; it persists\nin Moir's mind with the same intensity as in the murdered man's own\nimagination. The purpose once achieved,-the discovery made,-the\nohlession ceases.\nAnd we may indeed say that if we carry our ideas of telepathy into\nan unseen world, this is the kind of haunting which we should expect\nto find. We are dealing presumably with a world of influenCes j and\nwe can believe that a man may come within a current of influence\nagainst which no ordinary means of self-defence can avail, and which\nmay persist as long as certain links between the unembodied and the\nembodied mind hold good. And on the same principle we might\ninterpret the horror connected with the presence of a baby's corpse in\nthe roof ; referring this to some persistent current of influence from the\nunhappy mother who presumably p1a.ced it there.\nAll this must at present be mere speculation; but at any rate these\ndiscoveries of skeletons are in civilised countries so rare, that any account\nof haunting which can be shown to have originated before the discovery\nof the skeleton has considerable value as a coincidence.\nI give another case of this kind (already alluded to), from Mrs.\nMontague, Crackanthorpe, Newbiggin Hall, Westmoreland.\nDigitized by Google\n\f42 On Recognised Apparitions OCC'II\/rring [July 8,\nJ'INM l1th, 1883.\nIX.-Herewith my \"Northamptonshirenights \"__nddays, as accurately\ntold as I can. But, beyond being very real to me, I am afraid they won't avail\nyou much. For you see I heard nothing, saw nothing, neither did the maid.\nI toa8 startled when my father told me of the rector's confe88ion as to the\n\"disagreeableneBB\" ofthat end of the house-months afterwards-but what\nmade most impreBBion upon me was, that having battled through the night\nwith my vague terrors sUcceBBfully, I could tlOt sit in that arm-chair, in the\nsunshine, next day, with the BOund of the cook singing over her work close\nat hand.\nIn the summer of 1872, my father occupied a rectory house (passenham)\nnot far from Blisworth, in Northamptonshire, for a few weeks, and I went\ndown to spend three days with him and my mother at Whitsuntide ; my two\nchildren and their nurse being already there. The room given to me was over\nthe dining-room; next door to it was the night nursery, in which my:nurse and\nchildren slept, the rest of the inmates of the house being quite at the other\nend of a rather long passage. I hardly slept at all the first (Saturday)night,\nbeing po88eBBed with the belief that someone was in my room whom I should\nshortly see. I heard nothing, and I saw nothing. The next morning,\nSunday, I did not go to church, but betook myself to the dining-room with a\nbook. It was, I remember, a perfectly lovely June moming. Before I had\nbeen a quarter of an hour in the room, and whilst wholly interested in the\nbook, I was seized with a dread, of what I did not know ; but in spite of the\nsunshine and the servants moving about the house, I found it more\nintolerable to sitthere than it had been to remain in the room above the night\nbefore, and 80, after a struggle, and feeling not a little ashamed, I left the\nroom and went to the garden. Sunday night was a repetition of Saturday.\nI slept not at all, but remained in what I can only describe as a state of\nexpectation till dawn, and very thankfully I left on the Monday afternoon.\nTo my father and mother I said nothing of my two bad nights. The nurse\nand children remained behind for another week. I noticed that the nurse\nlooked gloomy when I left her. and I put it down to her finding the country\ndull, after London. When she returned she told me that she hoped she\nwould never have to go to stay in that house again. for she had not been able\nto sleep there during the fortnight, being each night the prey of fears, for which\nshe could not account in any way. My father left this rectory at the end of\nthe summer ; and some time afterwards he was talking of the place to me,\nand mentioned laughingly that before he entered it the rector had \" thought\nit right to let him know that that end of the house in which I and my\nchildren were put up was said to be haunted, my room especially, and that\nseveral of his visito~his sister in particular-had been much troubled by\nthis room being apparently entered, and steps and movements heard in the\ndead of night. I do notlike to letyou come in,\" the rector added, \" without\ntelling you this, though my own belief in it is small.\" Within, I think, a year\nor 18 months at most of my father's leaving, the house had to undergo\nconsiderable repair, and amongst others, a new floor had to be laid in the\ndining-room. On taking up the old boards four or five (I forget which)\nskeletons were found close under the boarding ina row, and also close to the\nhearthstone. Some of the skulle ofthese skeletons were very peculiar in form.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than a Year after Death.\nThey were sent up to London for examination. I am ashamed tosay, at this\nmoment, I forget what was the exact verdict pronounced on them by the\nexperts.\nThe Rev. G. M.

But I\nwill close this group with a narrative of an apparition observed in a\nroom from which a skeleton had been removed (without the percipient's\nknowledge) some considerable time before the figure was seen.\nX.-Sent by Mrs. Bevan, Plumpton House, Bury st.

Such motivedcases form a smaIl\nproportion only of the na.rra.tives of ghostly appearances. On the view\nhere advanced, this was likely to be the case; tke great majority of\nBuch manifestations were likely to have no distinct meaning or purpose.\nIn popular tradition, on the other hand, the meaning, the object, of a\nghost's appearance is apt to make the principal point of the story.\nAccordingly we find that when ghosts have no motive it has been\nthought necessary to invent one; and houses where haunting figures\noccur have been lavishly decorated with ancient tragedies-murders and\nsuicides of the most shadowy type-in order to justify the phantasmal\nvisits.\nAll these dim unhistorical stories we must set aside. We must\nrealise the fact that haunting figures usually occur without any such\nsensational background. And we must simply consider the few\nindications as to their true nature which the actual evidence offers.\nIn the first pla.ce, and having regard to the popular division of\nhauntinga into local and personal cases,-haunted houses and haunted\nmetI,-we observe that the evidence for haunted men is of a very weak\nDigitized by Google\n\f46 On Recognised Appari,tiom occu,rring [July 8,\norder. That is to say, in few of the cases where a man is troubled with\nthe same phantom, recurring again and again in different places, is\nthere reason to class the apparition as more than a mere subjective\nha.llucination. We do not find modem parallels to confirm the\noften-cited story of Mdlle. Claizon, who was haunted nightly by\nthe sound of a pistol shot (connected with the dying threat of a\nslighted lover), which sound is said to have been heard equa.1ly\nby other persons present at the time. The drift of the evidence, I\nrepeat, makes not for haunted men but for haunted places. It tends\nto show that figures resembling deceased persons are sometimes seen\nin the former habitat of those persons, under circumstances which\nmake their explanation as after-images or as chance-resemblances im-\nprobable. It is plain, however, that these figures can seldom occur\nunder good evidential conditions. If I see the figure of my dead friend\nin the room in which he lived, you may say that this was a mere after-\nimage; a vivid recollection of how my friend used to look. If you,\nwho never knew my friend, see a phantom in the same house, you do\nno. realise whom the phantom represents. To make evidence, our two\nvisions must be juxtaposed; and your description of the figure must\nbe identified with the known figure which I saw. This may be done,\nand has been done, more or less perfectly, in a variety of ways. Or, of\ncourse, a mere single vision of an unrecoguised figure may be in itself\nstrongly evidential, if only the percipient can identify the personage,\nwith proper precautions, from picture or photograph.\nBut there is no part of our inquiry where more care as to evidential\nconditions is needed, or where less care has actually been used. In\nour former discussions on apparitions coincident with a death, we found\nthat even the strongest personal interest in the vision was often in-\nsufficient to induce the percipient to record it properly, or to collect the\nmost necessary corroborations. And in these cases of so-called \" haunt-\ning\" the meaning of the apparition is still less the personal concern of\nany given percipient. Posterity-let us hope-will smile at the tone\nof many of the accounts which people give of such experiences,-their\nsense of personal injury at the idea that such a thing should happen to\ntke~-their unabashed avowal of having been terribly frightened at a\npoor phantom which could not hurt a fly. While there is so much\ndiffused timidity in regard to the so-called\" supernatural,\" the owners\nof house-property naturally take the fact into account, and conceal\nwell-attested ghosts as carefully as defective cesspools. The result is\nthat we have a great number of incomplete narratives,-narratives\nwhich do not indeed break down, but which stop short i-the experience\nof one percipient being given first-hand and in detail, but other cor-\nroborative experiences being promised, perhaps, and then withdrawn, or\ngiven with restrictions which render them useless as evidence. In this\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than a Year after Death. 47\ndepartment we have repeatedly had reason to believe that unwilling\ninformants have minimised or even denied their own experiences, from\nthe quite groundless fear that we might so use their narratives as to\ndepreciate the letting value of the haunted residence. We trust that\nwith a truer conception of the facts im'olved these repugnances are\nalready beginning to give way; but they have thus far kept most of\nour evidence for hauntings in a state ill-suited for public producti~n.\nThere are various cases where from my knowledge of the infor-\nmants,-and (if I may so say) of the non-informants,-I see strong\nreason for believing that something supernormal has occurred. But\nthere are few cases which I can print in anything like a complete form.\nThe publication of even a few narratives, however, may do something\nto remove vulgar prejudice, and to prompt to further inquiry.\n\"It came to nothing\"; \"What was the meaning of it t\" ; \" It\nseems such a senseless thing for a departed spirit to do\" i-such are\nthe usual comments on the purposeless class of manifestations on which\nwe enter now. I have already implied that this very purposelessness,\nin my view, ought apriori to have been expected, and forms a strong\nargument in favour of the origination of these phantoms somewhere\noutside the observer's mind. For I hold that now for the first time\ncan we form a conception of ghostly communications which shall in\nany way consist or cohere with more established conceptions; which\ncan be presented as in any way a development of facts which are\nalready experimentally known. Two preliminary conceptions were\nneeded,-conceptions in one sense ancient enough; but yet the first of\nwhich has only in this generation found its place in science, while the\nsecond is as yet awaiting its brevet of orthodoxy. The first conception\nis that with which hypnotism and various automatisms have familiarised\nus,-the conception of multiplex personality, of the potential c0-\nexistence of many states and many memories in the same individual.\nThe second is the conception of telepathy; of the action of mind on\nmind apart from the ordinary organs of sense; and especially of its\naction by means of hallucinations; by the generation of veridical\nphantasms which form as it were messages from men still in the flesh.\nAnd I believe that these two conceptions are in this way connected,\nthat the telepathic message generally starts from, and generally\nimpinges upon, a sub-conscious or submerged stratum in both agent\nand percipient.! Wherever there is hallucination,-whether delusive\nor veridical,-I hold that a message of some sort is forcing its way\nupwards from one stratum of personality to another,-a message which\nmay be merely dreamlike and incoherent, or which may symbolise a\nfact otherwise unreachable by the percipient personality. And the\n1 See Pkafltalml o\/eM Lf,11;\/n{l, Vol. I., p. 23L\nDigitized by Google\n\f48 On Recogni8ed Apparitions oCC'U'l'Ting [July 8,\nmechanism seems much the same whether the messa.ge's path be\ncontinued within one individual or pass between two i-whether A's\nown submerged self be signalling to his emergent self, or B be\ntelepathically stimulating the hidden fountains of perception in A.\nIf anything like this be true, it seems plainly needful that\nall that we know of abnormal or supernormal communications\nbetween minds, or states of the same mind, still embodied in flesh,\nshould be searched for analogies which may throw light on this\nstrangest mode of intercourse between embodied and disembodied\nminds. Our steps on this uncertain ground must needs be short and\nwavering. But they may help to mark the right direction for future\ninquiry, and to dispel certain vulgar preconceptions which can only\nmislead.\nA communication (if such a thing exists) from a departed person\nto a. person still on earth is at any rate a com~unication from a mind\nin one state of existence to a mind in a very different state of existence.\nAnd it is, moreover, a communication f~m one mind to another which\npasses through some channel other than the ordinary channels of sense;\n-since on one side of the gulf no material sense-organs exist. It will\napparently be an extreme instance of both these classes-of communi-\ncations between state and state,] and of telepathic communications;\nand we ought, therefore, to approach it by considering the less advanced\ncases of both these types.\nOn what occasions do we commonly find a mind conversing with\nanother mind not on the same plane with itse1f 7- with a mind\ninhabiting in some sense a different world, and viewing the environ-\nment with a difference of outlook greater than the mere difference of\ncharacter of the two personages will account for 7\nThe first instance of this sort which will occur to us lies in\nspontaneous somnambulism,-or colloquy between a person asleep and\na. person awake. And observe here how slight an accident allows us\nto enter into converse with a. state which at first sight seems a type of\nincommunicable isolation. \"Awake, we share our world,\" runs the old\nsaying, \"but each dreamer inhabits a world of his own.\" Yet the\ndreamer, apparently so self-enclosed, may be gently led, or will\nspontaneously enter, into converse with waking men.\nThe somnambulist,-or rather the somniloquist,-forit is the talking\nrather than the wa1king which is the gist of the matter,-is thus our\nfirst natural type of the revenant.\n1 Some word iB much needed to expreaa communicatiOI1ll between one state and\nanother-e.g., between the aomnambulic and the waking state, or, in hypnotism, the\ncataleptic and the aomnambulic, &C. The word \"methectic\" (p.f6fICT'IIC0s) seems to me\nthe moat suitable l-pecially since p.l8fEIf happens to be the word used by Plato\n(Parm. 132 D.) for participation between ideas And concrete objects. Or the word\n\" inter\u00b7state .. might be preued into this new duty,\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than a Year afteT Death. 49\nAnd observing the habits of somnambulists we note that the degree\nin which they can communicate with other minds varies greatly in\ndifferent cases. One sleep-waker will go about his customary avocations,\nwithout recognising the presence \u00b7of any other person whatever.\nAnother will recognise certain persons only; or will a.nswer when\naddressed, but only on certain subjects i-his mind coming into contact\nwith other minds only on a very few points. Rarely or never will a\nsomnambulist spontaneously notice what other persons are doing, and\nadapt his own a.ctions thereto.\nNext let us tum from natural to induced sleep-waking i-from\nidiopathic somnambulism to the hypnotic trance.-Heretoo, throughout\nthe difTMent stages of the trance, we find a varying and partial (or\nelective) power of communication.-Sometimes the entranced subject\nmakes no sign whatever. Sometimes he seems able to hear and answer\none person, or certain persons, and not others.-Sometimes he will talk\nfreely to all; but however freely he may talk, he is not exa.ctly his\nwaking self.-And as a rule he has no recollection, or a very imperfect\nrecollection, in waking life of what he has said or done in his trance.\nJudging, then, from such a.nalogy as communications from one\nliving state to another can suggest to us, we shall expect that the\ncommunication of a disembodied or discarnate person with an incarnate,\nif such exist, will be subject to narrow limitations, and very possibly\nwill not form a part of the main current of the supposed discarnate\nconsciousness.\nLooking back upon some of the cases above given, we shall recognise\nthat this description is at any rate consistent with their details, so far\nas it goes. The phantasmal figure has rarely seemed to meet the living\npercipient with any direct attention, but rather to be working out some\nfore-ordained suggestion with little reference to any other mind.\nAnd now to take the other aspect of the analogy which presented\nitself. Let us consider the characteristics of telepathic communication;\nsince the intercourse of the discarnate with the incarnate,-however\ndifferent it may be from thought-tra.nsference among living persons,-\nmust, at least, be ka different from thought-transference than from\nordinary speech or gesture.\nBeginning, then, with small experimental cases of thought-trans-\nference, we observe that the agent who projects a mental picture is\nnot commonly aware whether he has succeeded in transfering it or no;\nand we also observe that it is often imperfectly tra.nsferred, or\nincorrectly realised by the percipient. Analogically, we may suppose\nthat the discarnate intelligence may project a picture into some living\nmind without being aware that he has done so; and moreover, that\nthis picture, as realised by the living person, may differ considerably\nfrom the picture existing in the discarnate mind. Our next step is\nE\nDigitized by Google\n\f50 On Recognised Apparitions occurring. [July 8,\nstill more important. For we come to cases where the image projected\nbefore the percipient's consciousness is not that of a mere dia.gra.m., or\nnumber, or material o~ject of any kind, but is an image of the\n\" agent\" himself. Readers of PhantaamB ofthe 'Living will remember\nthat in these cases the agent is not usually aware of having produced\nthis effect on the percipient. There are, indeed, some instances where\nhe himself has some kind of corresponding impression,-as of seeing\nthe percipient at the moment when the percipient sees him,-and to\nthese we have given the name of reciprocal cases. And in many cases\nit is impossible to say whether this reciprocity existed or no, since the\nagent dies almost at the moment of the apparition. Still, these cases\nas a whole confirm the view already suggested, that the agent in\napparitions is not necessarily conscious of the effect which he is in\nsome way producing. And, finally, there is a small but very instructive\ngroup of cases where the agent has voluntarily induced an apparition\nof himself to a distant percipient, as a matter of experiment i-acting\nthus as nearly as possible in the way in which we may imagine a\ndeparted friend to act, if he desires to make an impression of his\npresence upon a friend who survives. What, then, is the behaviour of\nthe apparition thus produced' How far does it indicate intelligence or\ninitiative 7 How far does its action form a part of the normal train of\nconsciousness-or enter into the normal train of memory-of the agent\nfrom whom it in some way emanates7 Let us consider the principal\ncases of this kind recorded in PhantaamB ofthe Li1Ji.ng.\nCase 13, Vol. I., p. 103.-Figure speaks-uncertain with what\namount of intelligence. Agent (asleep at the time) is not conscious of\nhaving succeeded in appearing.\nCases 14, 15, 16, Vol. I., p. 104-109.-Mr. S. H. B.'s figure is seen,\non four occasions, as willed by him. On three of the occasions he is\nasleep, on the fourth in a state of self-induced trance-like concentration.\n-In no case does he know afterwards whether he has succeeded or\nnot.-On one occasion the figure performs a trifling act which Mr.\nS. H. B., had willed that it should perform. On another occasion it\nperforms a similar action without any previous intention on Mr. S. H.\nB.'s part.\nCase 685, V01 II., p. 671.-Mr. Cleave is hypnotised; sees a\nroom at a distance; is twice seen in that room.-In this case the agent\nremembers his own apparent presence in the distant room.-The\nfigure merely stands in the room; does not act.\nCase 686, Vol. II., p. 675.-Mrs. Russell, in waking state, desires\nintensely to become manifest to her family at a distance (Scotland\nto Germany).

Notzing, in waking conditions,\ndesires to impress himself upon a person out of sight. He succeeds;\nbas no knowledge that he has succeeded.\nIt will be seen that these cases which, as we have said, ought\ntheoretically to form the closest parallel to post-mortem apparitions,\ndo in effect actually present us incidents strongly resembling the\nbehaviour of those posthumous phantoms.\nTo put the matter in a crude way; the behaviour of phantasms of\nthe living suggests dres.ms dreamt by the living persons whose phantoms\nappear. And similarly the behaviour of phantasms of the dead suggests\ndreams dreamt by the deceased persons whose phantasms appear. The\nactions of these phantasms may therefore be expected to be vague and\nmeaningless, or at any rate to offer little response or adaptation to the\nactions of the persons who observe them. For they will presumably\nbe conditioned either by some definite previous self-suggestion, (as in\nS. H. B.'s case, above cited), or by some automatic recurrence to a\nfamiliar train of associations.\nAnd under the heading of \"automatic recurrence\" we ought\nprobably to place the appearances which seem to depend on locali.ty\nalone. Whatever position the departed may\" hold towards space,-\nwhether they inhabit our space, or some other form of space, or are\nextra-spatial entities,-we must suppose that their memory deals with\nthe space-relations of the past. And if there be a memory of space,\nthis is in itself a relation to space. If the decedent recollects scenes\nwhich he has known, then we may conceive that this recollection of his\nmay become somehow perceptible to other minds.\nThe notion that unembodied intelligences can have any relation to\nspace may appear to some minds as unphilosophical. It seems to lead\non to those primitive forms of materialism; those savage conceptions of\nthe spirits of the dead, which modern SpiritualiSm undoubtedly repro-\nduces under a new colour, but which philosophy has learnt to disdain.\nWe can, however, form no real conception of a disembodied existence;\nand it is better not to assume as a matter of course either any\nresemblances or any differences from our own condition beyond what\nthe actual evidence points to. And at any rate this conception of\na tkad mtf,ff,', dream,-of a probably unconscious gravitation of some\nfraction of his disembodied entity towards his old associations;-6\nflowing of some backwater of his being's current into channels familiar\nlong ago i-will serve to supply a fairly coherent conception of the\nmeaning of those vague ktJtmting' into which, as we have seen, our\nnarratives of recognised post-mortem apparitions imperceptibly glide.\nB2\nDigitized by Google\n\f52 On hcognised Apparitions occv,rring [July 8,\nThe strong and weak points of the evidence for recognised appari-\ntions and for vague hauntings a.re in some sense complementary to\neach other. Recognised apparitions have an obvious meaning, but\nweak attestation j vague ha.untings have strong attestation, but are\nhard to interpret. If recognised apparitions of the dead, under\ncircumstances precluding the possibility of mere subjective hallucina.-\ntion, occurred BO frequently that chance-coincidence were excluded, we\nshould have a right to 8.BBume that the so-ca.lled dead were still in some\nway influencing the living. But, a.s we have seen, the evidence to such\nappearances is a.s yet so scanty that although personally I incline to\naccept it, I cannot present it to others a.s at present conclusive. On\nthe other hand, the evidence that in certain hoUBeB several persons\nhave had hallucinations, independently of each other, and beyond the\nlimits of chance-coincidence, is, I think (a.s Mrs. Sidgwick's paper in\nVol. III. showed), exceedingly strong. The question remains a.s to\nwhat the meaning may be of these localised, recurrent hallucinationsj\n-whether they indeed bear any relation to departed men. And the\ngrotesqueness of these haunting phenomena,-their unlikeness to any\neffect which a reasonable decedent might be expected to wish to\nproduce,-ha.s been a strong argument against a.scribing them to the\nagency of a departed spirit.\nBut these incongruities seem less puzzling if we regard these\nhaunting sights and BOunds a.s the fragmentary reflection of some dead\nman's ineradicable dream. On tha.t view we need not look for reason\nin what is unrea.sonable, for purpose from what is purposeless. For\nthough in the la.st resort it would be an intelligence like our own from\nwhich these phenomena would spring, yet that intelligence would be\none with which we could enter into no real community. We should be\nobserving and analysing,-not messages from those who love, nor\nrevelations from those who know,-but the incoherent nightmare, the\nincognisable reverie, of the innumerable unremembered dead.\nThese reflections apply to a great number of narratives of haunting\nwhich, a.s above explained, are in themselves almost necessarily tedious\nand inconclusive. I will give one or two only at length j but will first\nbriefly indicate the character of BOme of the rest.\nWe have, for example, a ca.se (\" the Gillingham ghost\") where\nthree persons separately see the figure of an old woman in a house\nwhere an old woman, reputed of similar a.spect, used to reside. We\nhave a ca.se where a young man reading with a tutor (at Waterperry,\nnear Oxford) sees a phantom of a farmer of very upright carriage on a\nbridge where, (unknown to the percipient,) a farmer, formerly a\nsoldier, had been found dead some years before. We have a ca.se\nwhere a lady sees the figure of a. young girl run across a room (at\nCombermere Abbey), which room had previously been the nursery\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] MO'1'6 than a Year after Death. 53\nin which (as family tradition, unknown to the percipient, went) a\n16-yea.r-old daughter of the house had been found one morning dead\nin her bed. We have a case where three persons independently sa.w\nthe phantom figure of a young woman (at B. Court). One of these\npercipients, at least (probably all of them), remarked (in 1881) that the\nhead of the figure was not visible. In 1883 a skull was discovered\nbeneath t,he foundl!otions of the room into which this figure disappeared.\nWe have several cases of an isolated hallucination seen in a room\nwhich had previously been frequented by a person resembling the\nfigure seen,-this fact being unknown to the percipient. Thus Mr.\nA. W. Hall, of St. Thomas's House, Oxford, tells us how he sa.w a\nvenerable old man \"sitting writing at the table in the centre of the\nroom in which I was,\" the room being one in which there had, in fact,\nbeen previous rumours (unknown to Mr. Hall) of the appearance of\nLord Hood, Mr, Hall's great-grandfather, whom he had never seen.\nAnd through the kindness of the Bishop of Ripon we have procured\nthe following narrative from Mrs. Pittar (a near connection of the\nBishop's), whose verbal account was given to us in nearly the sa.me\nwords. I print the case ;-not as possessing high evidential value, for\nthe identification of the figure is plainly conjectural; but in the hope\nthat some reader may be able to get further information as to the\nChltea.u de Prangins,-an easily accessible place.\nXL-In the year 1867 I was travelling in Switzerland with my husband,\nand we stopped at the Chlteau de Prangius, near Nyon, which is now a\ncollegiate achool for boys.\nOur bedroom was a large, oblong room, overlooking the Terrace and Lake\nLeman, with an old-fashioned black writing-table in the middle of it. There\nwas nothing unusual about the room or the circumstances, and I went to bed\nand slept soundly. But in the middle of the night I suddenly awoke in a\nstate of terror, not, apparently, from a dream, for I had no impre88ion of\nhaving beendreaming, but witha sort ofcertainty that a tall, thin, old man, in\na long flowered dressing-gown, was seated and writing at the table in the\nmiddle of the room. I cannot say what gave me this certainty, or this\ndistinct picture, for I did notonce turn my eyes to the place where I felt that\nthe intruder was seated. n did not, in fact, occur to me at the time how odd\nit was that I thus knew of his appearance without seeing him. The room was\nflooded with brilliant moonlight ; but I did not venture to turn my head.\nMy cries awoke my husband, who naturally thought that I had had a night-\nmare, and could not understand my persistent assertion that an old man in a\nflowered dressing-gown was in the room. At last he persuaded me to look at\nthe table where I had felt that the old man was sitting ; and there was no\none there.\nNext morning my husband mentioned my extraordinary nocturnal terror;\nthe account, to our great surprise, was received as a matter of course, the\nlandlord's married daughter merely remarking, \"Ah, you have seen\nVoltaire.\" It appeared on inquiry that Voltaire, in extreme old age, used\nDigitized by Google\n\f54 On Recognised Apparitions OCCVIM\";'ng [July 8,\noften to visit this CMteau, then the property, I believe, of Lucien Bonaparte,\nand the room in which we slept was known to have been his sitting-room. Of\nthisneither my husband nor myself knew anything. I had not been thinking\nabout Voltaire, nor looking at any portrait of him, nor did it once occur to\nme that the figure could be his until I heard that morning from the landlord\nthat the same figure was reported to have been seen in the IlIlome room, and\nthat it was supposed to be Voltaire's.\nI have never had any other hallucination of any kind.\n1885. EMILY PrrrAB.\nHow long after death-we may ask, aprOPOB of this story of\nVoltaire-is there any evidence for the continued action of the\ndeparted 1\nThere are a good many accounts of appearances primA. facie\nrepresenting persons dead for 50 or 100 years. But obviously the\ncases where identifoation of so remote a figure is possible are likely to\nbe also cases where there may have been some kind of anticipation 011\nthe percipient's part ;-some association of a famous personage (the\nEmpress Catherine of Russia., &:c.), with rooms which that personage is\nknown to have inhabited.\nWe have a few cases where an unrecognised figure in old-fashioned\ncostume has been seen by more than one person, simultaneously or\nsuccessively. Thus a phantom in cavalier's garb was seen in daylight\nby two percipients together in an avenue at Twickenham. The\nevidential value of such cases will depend on the view which we\nultimately adopt as to whether collective hallucinations are ever woolly\ndelusive, or imply some sort of reality outside the percipients' minds.\nThere is a case investigated by Dale Owen (FootfallB, p. 304)\nwhich, unless it be an elaborate and purposeless hoax, stands almost\nalone in the definiteness of date and communication. This was given\nto Mr. Owen by the two principal percipients,-the \"wife of a field-\nofficer of high rank in the British army\" and a young lady, her friend\nand visitor. It was also independently confirmed by a Mrs. 0., who\nhad been a servant in the house at the time of the occurrences. The\nstory seems too complex to admit of being explained away by anything\nshort of an elaborate hoax played on Mr. Owen; and it seems\nimprobable that these ladies should have contrived such a deceit, or\nshould have induced the former nurse to take part in it, or should have\nallowed the story, if false, to be printed and reprinted without\ncomment. Mr. Owen, it must be remembered, was a man of the world\nand a diplomatist j-in no wayan absurd personage, but liked and\nesteemed in good society in several countries. We have endeavoured\nin vain to trace the percipients; and even the house (now, ~ Owen\nsays, a farmhouse) could not be positively identified by an inquiry\nwhich we caused to be made on the spot.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than a Year after Death. 55\nThe gist of the story is that, after many noises heard at Ramhurst\nManor by various persons, three figures appeared to Miss S., and one of\nthem also to Mrs. R., and that to both percipients the figures gave the\nsurname of Children, adding that Richard Children, one of the figures,\ndied in 1753. In Hasted's History of Kent (published 1778) the facts\nof Richard Children's residence at Ramhurst Manor, of his having a\nwife and son, and of his death in 1753, were verified.\nTo this cl&88 of cases belongs the remarkable narrative which forms\nthe gist of Mr. Hugh Hastings Romilly's TnMJ Story of tllS Western\nPacific (Longmans, 1882). Mr. Romilly has since been Deputy-\nCommissioner of the Western Pacific. On his book Mr. Gurney has\nthe following note :-\nThis book gives one the highest opinion of its writer's strength of\ncharacter, as well as of his modesty. Mr. Romilly's muther, Lady Elizabeth\nRomilly, assures me that the story is rather under-coloured than exaggerated,\nand that it is a most literal transcript of events, which Mr. H. H. Romilly\nwrote out, very unwillingly, at his father's urgent request.-E. G.\nI give an abstract of the incident, which is at any rate interesting\nas one of the few recorded cases of really close scrutiny into the\ngrounds of a savage belief by a cool and capable observer.\nXII.-In the earlier part of his narrative, Mr. Romilly has described the\nmurder on Christmas Eve, 1879, of a native called Kimueli, in the island\nof Rotumah, by an Australian half-caste, who was afterwards convicted of\nthe crime. Mr. Romilly had seen the wounded man before his death. \"A\npiece of coarse cloth or calico was over the top of the head, and round it,\nto keep it in its place, were strips of banana leaves. The whole was secured\nwith cotton and strips of fibre.\" Next year at the same season, Mr.\nRomilly, with a friend named Allardyce, was inhabiting a house in Rotumah,\nabout 200 yards from the house of a friendly in1luential native called Alipati,\nor Albert, who used usually to come with other friends and smoke with\nMr. Romilly in the evening.\nFor two days before Christmas Day this man Albert did not appear; and\nMr. Romilly learnt that he was afraid to walk from one house to the other\nbecause Kimueli's ghost had been repeatedly seen.\nOf course I laughed at him. It was an every-day occurrence for natives\nwho had been out late at night in the bush to come home saying they had\nseen ghosts. If I wished to send a me888ge after sunset, it was always neces-\nsary to engage three or four men to tske it. Nothing would have induced any\nlnan to go by himself. The only man who was free from these fears was my\ninterpreter, Friday. He was a native, but had lived all his life among white\npeople. When Friday came down from his own village to my houBe that\nmoming, he was evidently a good deal troubled in his mind. He said :\n\" You remember that man Kimueli, Bir, that Tom killed.\"\nI said, \"Yes, Albert says he is walking about.\"\nI expected Friday to laugh, but he looked very serious and said :\n\" Every one in Motusa has Been him, sir ; the women are 80 frightened\nthat they all sleep together in the big house.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\f56 On :&cognised Apparitions ocC'Ul1\"1'ing [July 8,\n..

It\nappeared that his head was tied up with banana leaves and his face covered\nwith blood. No one had heard him speak. This was unusual, as the ghosts\nI had heard the natives talk about on other occasions invariably made\nremarks on some commonplace subject. The village was very much upset.\nFor two nights this had happened, and several men and women had been\nterribly frightened. It was evident that all this was not imagination on the\npart of one man. I thought it possible that some madman was personating\nKimueli, though it seemed almost impossible that anyone could do so\nwithout being found out. I announced my determination to sit outside\nAlbert's house that night and watch for him. I also told Albert that I should\nbring a rifle and have a shot, if I saw the ghost. This I said for the benefit\nof anyone who might be playing its part.\nPoor Albert had to undergo a good deal of chaff for being afraid to walk\n200 yards through the bush to my house. He only said :\n\" By-and-bye you see him too, then me laugh at you.\"\nThe rest of the dAy was spent in the usual manner. Allardyceand I were\nto have dinner in Albert's house ; after that we were going to sit outside and\nwatch for Kimueli. All the natives had come in very early that day from the\nbush. They were evidently unwilling to run the risk of being out after dark.\nEvening was now closing in, and they were all sitting in clusters outside their\nhouses. It was, however, a bright moonlight night, and I could plainly\nrecognise people at a considerable distance. Albert was getting very nervous,\nand only answered my questions in monosyllables.\nFor about two hours we sat there smoking, and I was beginning to lose\nfaith in Albert's ghost, when all of a sudden he clutched my elbow and\npointed with hisfinger. I looked in the direction pointed out by him, and he\nwhispered \" Kimueli.\"\nI certainly saw about 100 yards off what appeared to be the ordinary\nfigure of a native advancing. He had something tied round his head, as yet\nI could not see what. He was advancing straight towards us. We sat still\nand waited. The natives sitting in front of their doors got closer together\nand pointed at the advancing figure. All this time I was watching it most\nintently. A recollection of having seen that figure was forcing itself upon my\nmind more strongly every moment, and suddenly the exact scene, when I had\ngone with Gordon to visit the murdered man, came back on my mind with\ngreat vividness. There was the same man in front of me, his face covered\nwith blood, and a dirty cloth over his head, kept in its place by banana-leaves\nwhich were secured with fibre and cotton thread. There was the same man,\nand there was the bandage round his head, leaf for leaf, and tie for tie,\nidentical with the picture already present in my mind.\n\"By Jove it it Kimueli,\" I said to Allardyce in a whisper. By this time\nhe had passed us, walking straight in the direction of the clump of bush in\nwhich my house was situated. We jumped up and gave chase, but he got to\nthe edge of the bush before we reached him. Though onlya few yards ahead\nof us, and a bright moonlight night, we here lost all trace of him. He had\ndisappeared, and all that was left was a feeling of consternation and\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] M0f'6 tham, a YeaT afteT Death. 57\nannoyance on my mind. We had to accept what we had seen ; no explana-\ntion was pouible. It was impossible to account for his appearance or\ndisappearance. I went back to Albert'a house in a moat perplexed frame of\nmind. The fact of its being Christmas Day, the anniversary of Tom'a attack\non Kimueli, made it atill more remarkable.\nI had myself only aeen Kimueli two or three timea in my life, but atill I\nremembered him perfectly, and the man or ghost, whichever it was who had\njust pasaed, exactly recalled his featurea. I had remembered, too, in a general\nway how Kimueli'a head had been bandaged with rag and banana-leaves, but\non the appearance of this figure it came back to me exactly, even to the\nposition of the knots. I could not then, and do not now, believe it was in the\npower of any native to play the part 80 exactly. A native could and often\ndoes work himself up into a atate of temporary madneu. under the influence\nof which he might believe himself to be anyone he chose; but the calm,\nquiet manner in which this figure had paaBed was, I believe, entirely\nimpouible for a native, acting auch a part, and before auch an audience, to\n_me. Moreover, Albert and every one elae acouted the idea. They all\nknew Kimueli intimately, had seen him every day and could not be mistaken.\nAllardyce had never seen him before, but can bear witneu to what he 88W\nthat night.\nI went back to my house and tried to dismisa the matter from my mind,\nbut with indifferent aucceB8. I could not get over his disappearance. We\nwere 80 close behind him, that if it had been a man forcing his way through\nthe thick undergrowth we must have heard and aeen him. There was no\npath where he had disappeared.\n[The figure was never aeen again.]\nFrom this savage scene I pass to a similar incident which occurred\nto a gentleman persona.lly known to me, (and widely known in the\nscientific world), in a tranquil and studious environment. The initials\nhere given are not the true ones.\nXIlI.-On October 12th, 1888, Mr. J. gave me mild 110Ce the following\naccount of his experience in the X. Library, in 1884, which I have taken\ndown from memory next day, and which he haa revised and corrected :-\nII In 1880 I succeeded a Mr. Q. 88 librarian of the X. Library. I had\nnever seen Mr. Q., nor any photograph or likeneu of him, when the follow-\ning incidents occurred. I may, of course, have heard the library 888istants\ndeacribe his appearance, though I have no recollection of this. I W88 aitting\nalone in\u00b7 the library one evening late in March, 1884, finishing aome work\nafter hours, when it auddenlyoccurred to me that I ahould miaa the laat\ntrain to H., where I W88 then living, if I did not make hute. It W88\nthen 10.55, and the laat train left X. at 11.5. I gathered up lOme botlka\nin one hand, took the lamp in the other, and prepared to leave the librarian'a\nroom, which communicated by a pa888ge with the main room of the library.\nAs my lamp illumined this pa888ge, I 88W apparently at the further end of\nit a man'a face. I instantly thought a thief had got into the library. This\nW88 by no means impouible, and the probability of it hsd occurred to me\nbefore. I turned back into my room, put down the books, and took a\nrevolver from the safe, and, holding the lamp cautioualy behind me, I made\nDigitized by Google\n\f58 On Recognised Apparitions occ'U\/rring [July 8,\nmy way along the paaaage-which had a comer, behind which I thought my\nthief might be lying in wait-into the main room. Hero I saw no one, but\nthe room was large and encumbered with bookcases. I called out loudly to\nthe intruder to show himself several times, more with the hope of attracting\na passing policeman than of drawing the intruder. Then I saw a face\nlooking round one of the bookcases. I say looking rouM, but it had an odd\nappearance as if the body were in the bookcase, as the face came 80 closely\nto the edge and I could see no body. The face was pallid and hairleaa, and\nthe orbits of the eyes were very deep. I advanced towards it, and as I did\n80 I saw an old man with high shoulders seem to rotate out of the end of\nthe bookcase, and with his back towards me and with a shu1Bing gait walk\nrather quickly from the bookcase to the door of a small lavatory, which\nopened from the library and had no other acceB8. I heard no noise. I\nfollowed the man at once into the lavatory; and to my extreme surprise\nfound no one there. I examined the window (about 14in. x 12in.), and\nfound it closed and fastened. I opened it and looked out. It opened into\na well, the bottom of which, 10 feet below, was a sky-light, and the top open\nto the sky some 20 feet above. It was in the middle of the building and no\nolle could have dropped into it without smashing the glass nor climbed out\nof it without a ladder-but JlO one was there. Nor had there been any-\nthing like tune for a man to get out of the window, as I followed the\nintruder instantly. Completely mystified, I even looked into the little\ncupboard under the fixed basin. There was nowhere hiding for a child, and\nI confeBS I began to experience for the first time what novelists describe as\nan 'eerie' feeling.\n\"I left the library, and found I had miMed my train.\n\"Next morning I mentioned what I had seen to a local clergyman, who,\non hearing my description, said, \"Why that's old Q. !\" Soon after I saw\na photograph (from a drawing) of Q., and the resemblance was certainly\nstriking. Q. had lost all his hair, eyebrows and all, from (I believe) a\ngunpowder accident. His walk was a peculiar, rapid, high-shouldered\nshufBe.\n\"Later inquiry proved he had died at about the time of year at which I\nsaw the figure.\n\"I have no theory as to this occurrence, and have never given special\nattention to such matters. I have only on one other occasion seen a\nphantasmal figure. When I was a boy of ten I was going in to early dinner\nwith my brothers. My mother was not at home, and we children had been\ntold that she was not very well, but though we miBSed her very much were\nin no way anxious about her. Suddenly I saw her on the staircase. I\nrushed up after her, but she disappeared. I cried to her and called to the\nrest, \"There's mother!\" But they only laughed at me and bade me come\nin to dinner. On that day-I am not sure as to the hour-my second sister\nwas born.\n\"I have had no other hallucinations. When I saw the figure of X. I was\nin good health and spirits.\"\nIn a subsequent letter Mr. J. adds: \"I am under a pledge to the X.\npeople not to make public the story in any way that would lead to identity.\nOf course I shall be glad to answer any private inquiries, and am willing\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] MO're than a Year after Death. 59\nthat my name should be given in confidence to bond jid6 inquirera in the\nusual way.\"\nThe evidential value of the above account is much enhanced by the fact\nthat the principal assistant in the library, Mr. R, and a junior clerk, Mr.\nP., independently witneB8ed a singular phenomenon, thus described by Mr.\nR. in 1889:-\n\"A few years ago I was engaged in a large building in the --, and\nduring the busy times was often there till late in the evening. On one\nparticular night I was at work along with a junior clerk till about 11 p.m.,\nin the room marked A on the annexed sketch. All the lights in the place\nhad been out for hoUl'B except those in the room which we occupied. Before\nleaving, we turned out the gas. We then looked into the fireplace, but not\na spark was to be seen. The night was very dark, but being thoroughly\naccustomed to the place we carried no light. On reaching the bottom of the\nstaircase (B), I happened to look up j when, to my surprise, the room which\nwe had just left appeared to be lighted. I turned to my companion and\npointed out the light, and sent him back to see what was wrong. He went\nat once and I stood looking through the open door, but I was not a little\nastonished to see that as BOOn as he got within a few yards of the room the\nlight went out quite suddenly. My companion, from the position he was in\nat the moment, could not see the light go out, but on his reaching the door\neverything was in total darkneas. He entered, however, and when he\nreturned, reported that both gas and fire were completely out. The light in\nthe daytime was got by means of a glass roof, there being no windows on the\nsides of the room, and the night in question was so dark that the moon\nshining through the roof was out of the question. Although I have often\nbeen in the same room till long after dark, both before and since, I have\nnever seen anything unusual at any other time.\n\" When the light went out my companion was at C.\" [marked on plan.]\nMr. P. endoraes this: \"I confirm the foregoing statement.\"\nIn subsequent lettera Mr. R. says :-\n\"The bare facts are as stated, being neither more nor less than what\ntook place. I have never on any other occasion had any hallucination of the\nsenses, and I think you will find the same to be the case with Mr. P.\"\nThe light was seen after the phantom j but those who saw the light were\nnot aware that the phantom had been seen~ for Mr. J. mentioned the\ncircumstance only to his wife and to one other friend (who has confirmed to\nus the fact that it was 80 mentioned to him), and he was naturally particu-\nlarly careful to give no hint of the matter to his assistants in the library.\nIn the Journo1 S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 207, will be found a tirst-hand\nrecord, sent by the Rev. W. S. Grignon, \"of two apparitions of the\nsame deceased peraon to two persons,-re1atives,-at intervals of two\nto four years after the death-apparently on the same spot.\" Some\nother cases which might have been noticed in the present paper will be\nfound in Mrs. Sidgwick's paper on Phantasms of the Dead, already\ncited. Specially important is the case of haunting in a modern villa\n(Vol. III., p. 117), which haunting has continued since the publication\nDigitized by Google\n\f60 On Recognised ..Apparitions ocC'U\/M\"ing [July 8,\nof Mrs. Sidgwick's paper, though we are not permitted to give any\naccount which might lead to recognition.\nI will conclude my quoted cases with a somewhat painful and\ncomplex narrative, which ought, I think, to be considered when we are\ntrying to form a conception as to the true significance of \"haunting\"\nsounds and sights.\nXIV.-The following case, which we owe to the kindness of Mr.\nWilfrid Ward (and of Lord Tennyson, for whom it was first committed\nto writing some years ago), is sent by Mrs. Pennee, of St. Anne\nde Beaupre, Quebec, daughter of the late Mr. William Ward (a\nConserva.tive M.P. for London), and sister of the late Rev. A. R. Ward,\nof Cambridge.\nWeston Manor, Freshwater, Isle of Wight.\n1884.\nIt was in the year 1856 that my husband took me to live at a house called\nBinstea.d, about five miles from Charlottetown, P. E. Island. It was a good-\nsized house, and at the back had been considerably extended to allow of extra\noffices, since there were about 200 acres of farm land around it, nece88itating\nseveral resident farming men. Although forming part of the house, these\npremises could only be entered through the inner kitchen, as no wall had\never been broken down to form a door or passage from upstairs. Thus the\nfarming men's sleeping rooms were adjacent to those occupied by the family\nand visitors, although there was no communication through the upstairs\ncorridor.\nIt was always in or near the sleeping apartment, immediately adjacent to\nthe men's, that the apparition was seen, and as that was one of our spare\nbedrooms, it may have frequently been unperceived.\nAbout 10 days after we had established ourselves at Binstea.d, we com-\nmenced hearing strange noises. For many weeks they were of very frequent\noccurrence, and were heard simultaneously in every part of the house, and\nalways appeared to be in close proximity to each person. The noise was\nmore like a rumbling which made the house vibrate, than like that produced\nby dragging a heavy body, of which one so often hears in ghost stories.\nAs spring came on we began to hear shrieks, which would grow fainter\nor louder, as if someone was being chased round the house, but always\nculminating ina regular volley ofshrieks, sobs, moans, and half-uttered words,\nproceeding from beneath a tree thatstood at a little distance from the dining-\nroom window, and whose branches nearly touched the window of the\nbedroom I have mentioned.\nIt was in February (I think), 1857, that the first apparition came under\nmy notice. Two ladies were sleeping in the bedroom. Of course, for that\nseason of the year a fire had been lighted in the grate, and the Jirepla.ce\nreally contained a grate and not an American substitute for one.\nAbout 2 o'clock, Mrs. M. was awakened by a bright light which pervaded\nthe room. She saw a woman standing by the fireplace. In her left arm was\na young baby, and with her right hand she was stirring the ashes, over which\nshe was slightly stooping.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] More than a Year after Death. 61\nMrs. M. pushed Mias O. to awaken her, and just then the figure turned\nher face towards them, diacloling the features of quite a young woman with\na singularly anxious pleading look upon her face. They took notice of a\nlittle check shawl which was CI'OII8ed over her bosom. Mias O. had previously\nheard BOme tales concerning the house being haunted (which neither\nMrs. M. nor I had ever heard), so jumping to the conclusion that she\nbeheld a ghost, she screamed and pulled the bedclothes tightly over the\nheads of herself and her companion, 80 that the sequel of the ghost's pro-\nceedings is unknown.\nThe following spring I went home to England, and just before starting I\nhad my own experience of seeing a ghost. I had temporarily established myself\nin the room, and one evening, finding my little daughter (now Mrs. Amyot)\nfar from well, had her bed wheeled in beside mine that I might attend to\nher. About 12 o'clock I got up to give her some medicine, and was feeling\nfor the matches when she called my attention to a brilliant lightshining under\nthe door. I exclaimed that it was her papa and threw open the door to admit\nhim. I found myself face to face with a woman. She had a baby on her left\narm, a check shawl crossed over her bosom, and all around her shone a\nbright pleasant light, whence emanating I could not say. Her look at me\nwas one of entreaty-almost agonising entreaty. She did not enter the room\nbut moved across the staircase, vanishing into the opposite wall, exactly\nwhere the inner man-servant's room was situated.\nNeither my daughter nor myself felt the slightest alarm ; at the moment\nit appeared to be a matter of common occurrence. When Mr. Peunae came\nupstairs and I told him what we had seen, he examined the wall, the stair-\ncase, the passage, but found no traces of anything extraordinary. Nor did\nmy dogs bark.\nOn my return from England in 1858 I was informed that \"the creature\nhad been carrying on,\" but it was the screams that had been the worst.\nHowever, Harry (a farm-servant) had had several visits but would tell nC)\nparticulars. I never could get Harry to tell me much. He acknowledged\nthat the woman had several times stood at the foot of his bed, but he would\nnot tell me more. One night Harry had certainly been much disturbed in\nmind, and the other man heard voices and sobs. Nothing would ever induce\nHarry to let anyone share his room, and he was most careful to fasten his\ndoor before retiring. At the time, I attached no importance to \"his ways,\"\nas we called them.\nIn the autumn of the following year, 1809, my connection with Binstead\nceased, for we gave up the house and returned to Oharlottetown.\nI left Prince Edward Island in 1861, and went to Quebec. In 1877 I\nhappened to return to the island, and spent several months there. One day I\nwas at the Bishop's residence, when the pariah priest came in with a letter in\nhis hand. He asked me about my residence at Binstead, and whether I could\nthrow any light on the contents of his letter. It was from the wife of the\nthen owner of Binstead, askinghim to come out and try to deliver them from\nthe ghost of a woman with a baby in her arms, who had appeared several\ntimes.\nAfter I went to live in Charlottetown I became acquainted with the\nfollowing facta, which seem to throw light on my ghost story.\nDigitized by Google\n\f62 On .Recognilled Apparitions occurring [July 8,\nThe ground on which Binstead stood had been cleared, in about 1840, by\na rich Englishman, who had built a very nice house. Getting tired of colonial\nlife, he sold the property to a man whose name I forget, but whom I will call\nPigott (that was like the name). He was a man of low tastes and immoral\nhabits; but a capital farmer. It was he who added all the back wing of the\nhouse and made the nece88&ry divisions, &c., for farming the land. He\nhad two sisters in his service, the daughters of a labourer who lived in a\nregular hovel, about three miles nearer town. After a time each sister gave\nbirth to a boy.\nVery little can be learnt of the domestic arrangements, since Pigott bore\nso bad a name that the house was avoided by respectable people ; but it is\ncertain that one sister and one baby disappeared altogether, though when\nand how is a complete mystery.\nWhen the other baby was between one and two years old, Pigott sold\nBinstead to an English gentleman named Fellowes, from whom we hired it,\nwith the intention of eventually buying it. The other sister returned to her\nfather's house, and leaving the baby with Mrs. Newbury, her mother, went\nto the States, and baa never returned. Before leaving she would reveal\nnothing, except that the boy was her sister's, her own being dead. It was\nthis very Harry Newbury that we had unwittingly engaged as farm-servant.\nHe came to bid me farewell a few months after I left Binstead, saying he\nwould never return there. In 1877, I inquired about him, and found that\nhe had never been seen since in Prince Edward Island.\nIn another letter dated September 24th, 1887, Mrs. Pennee adds:-\nAnother fact baa come to my notice. A young lady, then a child of\nfrom 5 to 10, remembers being afraid of sleeping alone when on a visit at\nBinstead on account of the screams she heard outside, and also the \"woman\nwith a baby,\" whom she saw paasingthrough her room. Her experience\ngoes back some 10 to 15 years before mine.\nIn a further letter, dated St. Anne de Beaupre, Quebec, January\n23rd, 1889, Mrs. Pennee gives additional facts, as follows:-\n(1) Mrs. PennlSe interviewed Father Boudreault, the priestsent for by the\nC. family to exorcise the house. Father B., however, was on his death-bed;\nand although he remembered the fact that he had been sent for to Binstead\nfor this purpose, he could not recollect what had been told him as to\napparitions, &c.\n(2) Mrs. M., who first saw the figure, baa gone to England, and cannot\nnow be traced. Mrs. PennlSe adda:-\" The lady in question told several people\nthat she saw a woman with a baby in her arms when she slept at Binstead ;\nand, like myself, she noticed a frilled cap on the woman. The woman whose\nghost we imagine this to be was an Irish woman, and perhaps you have\nnoticed their love of wide frills in their head-gear.\"\n(3) Mrs. PennlSe revisited Binstead in 1888, and says, \"The tree whence\nthe screams started is cutdown; the room where all saw the ghost is totally\nuninhabited ; and Mrs. C. would not let us stay in it, and entreated us to\ntalk no further on the subject. From the man we got out a little, but sbe\nfollowed us up very closely. He says thatsince the priest blessed the house a\nDigitized by Google\n\f1889.] MOTe than a Year after Death. 63\nwoman baa been. seen (or laid to have been seen, he corrected himself)\nround the front entrance, and once at an upper window.\"\nThe list of cases cited in this and the previous paper, while\ninsufficient (as I have already said) to compel conviction, is striking\nenough to plead for serious attention to a subject which will never be\nproperly threshed out unless the interest taken in it assumes a scientific\nrather than an emotional form. Considering how long this scattered\nbelief in the appearances of dead persons has existed, it is really extra-\nordinary that so little trouble should have been taken to determine\nwhether that belief was well-founded or no. For be it observed that\nthere has been just as little diligence, just as little acumen, shown\namongst the scoffers as amongst the credulous. It is often said that\n\"ghost-stories break down on examination\"; but what really happens\nis, not that the inquirer detects fraud or mistake in the story, but that\nthe story is both presented and criticised in a vague and careless way,\nis sifted by nobody, and sinks or swims as a mere matter of luck. Mr.\nGurney was in the habit of collecting specimens of cases sent to\nourselves which broke down on his inquiry. These contain some\ncurious specimens of human error; and we hope some time to offer\nsome of them to the public. But hardly any hints of value, it was\nfound, could be drawn from previous destructive criticisms, which\nare generally of the most superficial kind. In fact, so far as any\nexact investigation goes, the present subject is almost absolutely\nnew,. and the group of cases now presented--of whose evidential\nimperfections I am thoroughly aware-must be taken as a 'I1itukmiatio\nprima, or mere first handful from an ungarnered field.\nSomething will have been done, I hope, to encourage the quest for\nfurther evidence if I am thought to have suggested a parallel between\nthe now known modes of action of the embodied mind and the possible\nmodes of action of the disembodied mind, which may at least enable us\nto see something logically probab~e,-rather than somethinggrotesquely\nmeaningless,-in the reported behaviour of the ordinary apparition.\nMost assuredly, if these supernormal phenomena are to be explained at\nall, they must be explained by finding some laws which govern at once\nthese post-mortem manifestations and the manifestations of spirits still .\nin the flesh. Two such laws I believe to exist. In the first place, I\nbelieve that telepathy-the transference of thought through other than\nsensory channels-exists both as between embodied spirits and as\nbetween embodied and disembodied spirits. I hold that there is a\ncontinuous series of manifestations of such power, beginning with\nthought-transference experiments and hypnotism at a distance, pro-\nceeding through experimental apparitions and apparitions coincident\nwith crisis or death, and ending with apparitions after death i-the\nDigitized by Google\n\f64 On Recognised Apparitiom occwrring [July 8,\nresults, in my view, of the continued exercise of the same energy by\nthe spirits of the departed.\nAnd in the second place I regard it as analogically probable\nthat the thesis of multiplex personality,-namely, that no known\ncurrent of man's consciousness exhausts his whole consciousness,\nand no known self-manifestation expresses man's whole potential\nbeing,-may hold good both for embodied and for disembodied\nmen. And consequently I believe that the self-manifestations of the\ndeparted,-being communications between states of being almost\nimpassably disunited, -must needs form an extreme type of those\nfugitive and unstable communications between widely different strata\nof personality of which living minds offer us examples; and that\n\" ghosts\" must therefore as a rule represent-not conscious or central\ncurrents of intelligence-but mere automatic projections from con-\nsciousnesses which have their centres elsewhere.\n&.

In Homer's view the dead men themselve8-in the only\npersonality worth possessing-were lying, a prey to dogs and to every\nbird, on the plain of Troy. Plotinus, on the other hand, could not\nbelieve that the automatic self-glorifications, the fading recollections of\n\" Hades' house,\" could represent the true personality of the ascending\nsoul. \"The shade of H~rakIes,\" he said, \"might boast thus to shades;\nbut the true H~rakles for all this cares nought; being transported into\na more sacred place, and strenuously engaging, even above his strength,\nin those contests in which the wise wish to engage.\"\nIt must be enough thus to indicate that the view here taken of the\ninadequacy of apparitions as a true means of communication between\nthe dead and the living does by no means negative any belief which we\nmay hold on other grounds as to the life and love of the departed.\nThe present need is not of speculation, but of evidence ;-of a real\ndirection of competent intelligence towards the collection and criticism\nof a far larger mass of well-attested narratives than the efforts of a few\nmen during a few years have succeeded in getting together. It may\nindeed be that such recorda may prove explicable--I can scarcely say\nDigitized by Goo~\n\f1889.] M01'6 t\/wm, a Year after Death. 65\nby known laws-but by laws whose discovery will only slightly further\nextend our experimental psychology in some of the dinlctions in which\nit is now rapidly adva.ncing.

These\nnew experiments are, in my view, more decisive than any of those\nwhich I have detailed in the above-mentioned memoir.\nIn fact, as I had there remarked, the earlier experiments were\ngravely compromised by the most important and incontestable fact that\nwhen playing-cards were used there was no lucidity. \"Here,\" I said in\nconclusion, \"we have a fact absolutely negative, which must inevitably\ncast some doubt on the experiments in the reproduction of diagrams.\"\n(p. 149.)\nWhen the subject is called upon to divine a drawing, a name, a\nmalady, an incident of some kind, the probability of a right or\napproximately right answer is hard to calculate. To take an example:\nWhat is the probability that, given a drawing such as Figure 66, p. 99,\n110 reproduction as accurate as Figure 66 bis will be obtained by\nchance alone 1 The calculation is an impossible one. One can only\nsay that the chance of such reproduction is not very small.\nOn the other hand, when a playing-card is used, the probability is\na known, a measurable quantity; as measurable as any fact in- science.\nIf I put the queen of hearts, without knowing myself what card it\nis, in an envelope, and am told that the queen of diamonds is in the\nenvelope, I can calculate all the probabilities involved j the chance\nthat a queen will be chosen h\\), that a red queen will be chosen (1\\)'\nthe chance that the card chosen will not be the queen of hearts (H),\nthat it will not be a. heart at a.ll (I). &c., &0.

This argument-which I am surprised to note\nin the German magazine Sphinxl-is far from sound. For if by\nexperiment one obtains a result antecedently very improbable, it is\nassuredly permissible to conclude that something besides chance has\nbeen at work. Otherwise one would never come to any conclusion at\nall. The doctrine of chances, in fact, is at the bottom of all\nscientific argument, in chemistry, physics, physiology alike, although\nmasked in these cases by the predominant importance of the special\nconditions of each experiment.\nA chemist seeking to determine the atomic weight of potassium,\nand obtaining the number 39 in two successive experiments, will not\nset the result aside as due to chance. He will try once more with\nincreased exactness, and if he again obtains 39 he will accept the\nresult. He will not attribute the coincidence of the three numbers to\n\"a lucky run.\"\nIf, then, I obtain a series \u00b7of concordant results whose antecedent\nprobability, on the ground of chance alone, is of one to a thousand\nmillions, I shall maintain that chance does not explain this; but that\neither lucidity veritably exists, or there is some defect in the method\nof experimentation.\nAnd this may be advanced with the more confidence, inasmuch as\nthe alternative between lucidity and non-lucidity is in these experi-\nments a perfectly distinct one. Up till now-if you will-lucidity had\nnever been clearly proved either by myself or by anyone else. The\nexperiment was still to be made; and either the affirmative or the\nnegative view could still be maintained. If, then, my new experiment\nis indisputably cogent in one or the other direction, it must be regarded\nas deciding the question.\nWell, in the series of experiments which I shall now recount,\nlucidity has shown itself in the clearest manner; and, so far as the\npossibilit.y of chance is concerned, there is left no room for doubt.\nThe subject on whom these experiments were made was Leonie\nB., well-known in connection with the celebrated experiments of\nM. Gibert and M. Pierre Janet.2 I need not, therefore, insist on\nthe special characteristics which her hypnotic trance presents.\nThese experiments have been, for my part, of a very laborious\n1 Die aogennanten Spiritistilchen Ve7\"Iue\/z.e del Pro\/uwr.

She spent two months and a-half in my house (June 29th--\nSeptember 11th, 1888). As I could keep her entranced for a long time\nwithout injury to her-generally during the night-I have repeatedly\nsat by her side from 8 p.m. till 6 a.m. For it was not in the earliest\nmoments of her trance that she could tell the cards under the envelope,\nbut after long and apparently very laborious endeavour.\nThe manner in which she arrived at this result was very curious-\npossibly very instructive, if any real clue to the process can be found.\nShe held the envelope between her hands, and then drew on a sheet of\npaper a cluh, a heart, a diamond, 1\\ spade; and she repeated these\ndrawings over and over again, saying, \" It is red, black, club, heart,\"\n&c., but not making up her mind to a definite choice till after a long\nperiod of uncertainty. This period of guessing was still longer when the\nexact number of pips on the card was to be told. In that case she\ncounted on her fingers, repeating the process again and again\nad nauseam.\nMy patience was thus pretty severely tried. To wait three, four,\nor five hours at dead of night till a card is named, one needs a\nconsiderable share of perseverance. Had it been my intention-which\nHeaven forbid I-to submit these experiments to some academic\ncommission, I should not have ventured to ask of anybody whatever to\nendure seanc68 like these, often, alas! completely without success. To\nendure such seanc68, one must be directly interested in the experiment.\nAn onlooker would have lost patience before attaining the smallest\nresult.\nMoreover, during all this time she never ceased talking of other\nthings-a.sking me all kinds of questions, describing the episodes of\nher past life, expressing a kind of childish affection for m&-full\nof gaiety and mockery, and rapidly catching the ridiculous side of\neveryone whom she had come a.cross,-talking, in short, of everything\nexcept the card which she was trying to tell. \"She was waiting for it\nto come,\" she said, aud suddenly, in the midst of our conversation, she\nwould stop and name a card-then begin again two or three times to\ntalk; and it was only at the end of all this that she settled definitely\nwhat card she would name.\nIt is clear, I think, that had I known the card I should have ended\nby indicating it to her in spite of myself. From weariness or inad-\nvertence, I should have given some sign which would have betrayed my\nthought. I believe, indeed, that in a sitting of five bours I could\nmyself manage to discover any card known to the experimenter, merely\nby aid of the hints which his exhaustion might allow to escape him in\nthe course of so tedious a trial. But, as the case actually stood, I could\nreveal nothing to Leonie, for I was myself absolutely ignorant as to\nwhat the card in the envelope might be.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\fLucidity 0'1' Olairvoya'nC6. 69\n4s in my previous experiments, the card was taken by me (at\nrandom and unseen) from a mixture of 10 packs of 52 cards each; the\nDumber of packs thus admitting of the recurrence of the same card\nseveral times running. .The cards which had once been used were not\nemployed a second time. I placed the card in an opaque envelope, which\nI closed myself completely and gave to Leonie. When she had decided\non the card, I took back the envelope; I satisfied myself that it was\nintact, and I opened it, and took the card out. Sometimes Leonie\nopened the envelope herself; but I had always first satisfied myself\nof the absolute integrity of the envelope-a condition without which,\nas I assured her, the experiment could not count.\nThese envelopes, called opaque8 in trade, were in fact not absolutely\nopaque. They were sufficiently so, however, entirely to prevent the\ncolour of pips from being discerned by t'l'ammiUecllight, whatever\nthe source of illumination. I succeeded, with great difficulty, and\nafter efforts which lasted some minutes,\u00b7 by placing the card in\nfull sunshine or in the light of a powerful lamp, in seeing the\npips and colour of the card by reflected light. But Uonie never\nacted in this way. She made no effort to look at the card, but\ncontented herself with feeling it between her fingers, and crumpling\nthe envelope in her ha:nd, scribbling, meantime, upon the envelope itself\nher interminable scrawls, representing club, spade, heart, and diamond.\nShe remained, moreover, almost constantly in a dim light, at some\ndistance from my armchair, and never tried to hold the card in the\nlight of the lamp.\nFurthermore, in order to preclude all possibility of ordinary, even\nhypermsthetic sight, from the experiments of July 22nd onwards, I\nplaced the card and envelope in a second opaque envelope, so that the\ntwo superimposed opacities rendered the card absolutely invisible to\nthe sight of normal people. It will be seen that this precaution in no\nway modified the success of the experiment.1\n1 I made several experiments on diagrtJ\"\" with Uouie. Some of these succeeded\nbetter than any of thOlle which I recounted in my last memoir, but I do not mention\nthem here, for I wish to confine myself to matter of absolute proof. and I do not think\nthat experiments with diagrams have the same demonstrative force as experiments\nwith cards, where the chances are exactly known. I will mention one observation\nalone; a remarkable instance either of thought-transference, or, as I am strongly in\u00b7\nclined to suppose, of lucidity.\nOn Monday, July 2nd, after having passed all the day in my laboratory, I\nhypnotised Uonie at 8 p.m., and while she tried to make out a diagram concealed in\nan envelope I said to her quite suddenly: \"What has happened to M. Langlois!\"\nL!onie knows M. Langlois from having seen him twoor three times some time ago in\nmy physiological laboratory, where he acts as my assistant. \" He has burnt himself,\"\nLeonie replied. \" Good,\" I said, \"and where has he burnt himself! .. ..

Of this I am ahlolutely certain,\nand I am certain that I had not mentioned the incidentof the burn to anybody. More\u00b7\nover, this was the first time for nearly a year that M.

Of course, I give here all the words I used, and\nonly the words I used, when I interrogated Leonie.\nDecisive though this observation WIlo8, I should find it very hard to estimate the\nprobability of a correct guess.

In the first place,\nwe have one set in which the card was told completely, pips, suit, and\ncolour, and another set in which only the suit was told. But let us\nbegin by examining the whole group of the experiments; we shall\nthen see what are the lines of division which we must draw between\nthem.\nIn these 68 experiments the antecedently probable number of\ncards told completely right will be either one or two; the probable\nt I wished to try the same experiment with a completely new pack.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\fLt\u00a3Cidity (Yf' Clairvoyance. 73\nnumber of suits rightly named will be 17, and the probable number of\ncolours rightly Damed 34.\nWe may compare these numbers with the cards actually drawn at\nhazard, and then with the cards guessed by LOOnie.\nA.-Cardll etl.tirely right.\nAntecedent probability\nBy actual chance-drawing ...\nGuessed by LOOnie ...\nB.-Cardll with 81'\" right.\nAntecedent probability\nBy actual chance-drawing .\u2022.\nGuessed by LOOnie ...\nC.-Carda with colour right.\n1 or 2\n1\n...12\n... 17\n...19\n...36\nAntecedent probability ... 34\nBy actual chance-drawing ... ... 38\nGuessed by LOOnie ... ... 45\nIt will be seen that under each of these three categories there was\na notable excess of actual successes over the antecedent probabilities,\nand that this excess was more marked in proportion as the antecedent\nprobability was smaller. The result of actual chance-drawing will be\nseen to have corresponded pretty closely to the theoretic probabilities.\nIf we consider the numbers day by day we shall soo that almost\nevery day there was a marked excess of successes.

And on\nthat day only one card was tried, Leonie being extremely ill. The\nactual chance-drawing twice shows an excess over Leonie's successes, is\ntwice equal, and on the other nine days is inferior.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\fFurther Ergpe'l\"innents in Hypnotic\nIt will be seen also that (1) the interposition of a. second envelope,\nand (2) the employment of a new pack of cards did not apparently\nmodify Leonie's lucidity. In the first series (one envelope) in 45 trials\nwe find 7 cards told completely right, and 23 with suit right-the\ntheoretic numbers being 1 and 11. In the second series (two opaque\nenvelopes) in 16 trials we find 5 cards were told completely right,\nand 7 cards with suit right-the theoretic numbers being 0 and 4.\nIn the third series (fresh pack of cards and two opaque envelopes)\nin seven trials we find 5 cards with sui\\; ~ld rightly-the theoretic\nnumber being 2.\nBy a rough calculation, the probability that in 68 trials there\nwill be 36 8Uccesses at least in guessing the suit is found to be less\nthan too;:..,.\nReturning to what has been already said, we see a.t once that these\ntrials must be divided into two groups. In the first group come the\ntrials where the card guessed was completely described (pips, suit, and\ncOlour); in the second group come the cases where the \/lUit alone was\nguessed.\nIt is remarkable in how large a proportion of those cases in which\nLeonie described the guessed card completely, the description was\ncompletely right.\nThe following is a list of the cases where the guessed card was\ncompletely, or nearly completely described :-\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\nTrue Card.\n10 H\nKnD\nKD\n10\nQS\nIH\nKnH\nKC\n2D\n4D\nKH\nQD\nlC\nQH\n10 H\nKC\n9D\nCard Deecribed.\nKH.\nFD\nKD\n10\nFS\nIH\nKnS\nKO\n2D\n4D\nKH\nQD\n10\nQD\nlOB\nKC\n9D\nThus in 68 trials Leonie only 17 times offereda full description, and\nof these descriptions there were two where the description was\nincomplete-\" court-ca.rd in diamonds\" for knave of diamonds, and\n\" court-card in spades\" for queen of spades-an incompleteness which\nassuredly ought not to count as an error. But let us set aside these\nDigitized by Google\n\fLucidity fYI' Clairvoya'nC6. 75\ntwo incomplete descriptions, and consider only the 15 complete ones.\nWe find that in 15 cards completely described there were three errors.\nAnd these errors were only partial ; king of hearts for 10 of hearts;\nknave of spa.des for knave of hearts; queen of diamonds for queen of\nhearts.\nNow the antecedent probability of a completely correct description\nis -h ; and if we calculate the probability of correctly describing 12\ncards out of 15 we arrive at a fraction so small as to leave us a moral\ncertitude that chance alone cannot have brought about such a result.\nThis probability is approximately 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.\nIt seems to me, then, to be needless to insist further that chance is\nnot here the agent. It is not chance, it is something else; what else\nwe must presently try to determine.\nBut first let us see what is to be made of the other experiments if\nwe eliminate these 17 trials. Fifty-one trials remain, in which Leonie\ntold the suit right 21 times; whereas the probable number was 13.\nThe chance of telling the suit right 21 times in 51 trials is small; but\nyet far greater than the chances with which we have just been dealing.\nThis result alone would not suffice to establish Leonie's lucidity. It\nproves, however, that even when the best experiments are omitted, she\nstill replied with more accuracy than chance-drawings actually gave,\nor theoretically should give.\nBut there is a wide difference between these 51 trials where the\ncomplete description of the card was not given, and the 17 trials where\nit tDt.W given. Taking the wit alone (chance of rightness 1) we find,\nin the first group of 51,21 successes; in the second group of 17, 15\nsuccesses. The chance of 15 successesin17 trials is roughly 1in10,000,000.\nI shall not dwell further on the hypothesis of chance, which seems to\nme absurd. It is not chance which can give the right card 12 times\nin 15,1\nSince, then, the hypothesis of chance must be rejected, we need to\nscrutinise the conditions of the experiments. In the first place it is\nplain that thought-transference (wggution mentale) cannot be\ninvoked as an explanation. Only in two cases (Experiments 57 and 19)\nwas such transference possible. In Experiment 57 my friend M. E.\nGuiard had looked at the card before he placed it in the envelope. He\nabstained from giving any indication, and contented himself with\nanswering, .. Right!\" when Leonie said, \"It is the king of clubs.\"\nIn Experiment 19, after Leonie had said erroneously, \"It is a\nclub,\" I looked at the card and saw that it was a king of diamonds.\nI am absolutely certain that she could not see the card while I looked\n1 See p. 151 in Proceeding, XII. In the 433 trials recounted in my previous\npaper there were only six carda fully deacribed.\nDigitized by Google\n\f76 Fwrthe,' Experiments in Hypnotw\nat it. She then said, \"It is the queen of diamonds,\" without any\nindication on my part further than by telling her that it was not a\nclub. (This experiment has, of course, been counted as a failure.)\nThe examination of the cards of which a full description was given,\nshows an interesting peculiarity. They were mainly court-cards and\naces. Among the 17 fully-described cards, while the proportion given\nby chance would have been 5 or 6 court-cards and aces, there were in\nfact 13. She seems then to see court-cards better than cards with pips.\nWe come now to the delicate and difficult question: W8I her\nsuccess due to some defect in the experimentation'\nMy mode of procedure was as follows: From the midst of 10 packs\nof 52 cards each, 1 drew at hazard a card which 1 placed in an opaque\nenvelope. I did this in low light at one end of my library, which is\nnearly five metres in length, Leonie sitting at the opposite end, with\nher back turned to me. Moreover, I drew the card very rapidly, so\nthat in order to see it it would have been necessary (1) to lie on the\nfloor in front.of me; (2) to bring the lamp and set it on the floor. It\nis then absolutely (I say ohlolutely) impossible that the card could have\nbeen seen at the moment when I put it in the envelope. The envelope\nwas gummed, and 1 closed it at once. Certainly, during an experiment\nwhich sometimes lasted two or three hours, I occasionally took my eyes\noff the subject for some instants; but it is impossible to open a gummed\nenvelope in a few instants-water and minute care are needed-\nwithout leaving some trace. At the moment when I was about to\nopeu the envelope I rigorously observed that it was the same\nenvelope, that it had no tear in it, and that the fastening was\nabsolutely intact. Consequently the envelope had not been\nopened, and it was the same envelope. The name of the card\nindicated by Leonie was written by her in full, or written by me,\nbefore the envelope was opened; and, moreover, I kept an exac1i-a\nreligiously exact-account of all the experiments made; so that the\n15 experiments, with 12 successes, must be regarded as the exact\nnumber. No conscious or unconscious, mental or non-mental sugges-\ntion could be made by me, since I was totally ignorant of the card\nplaced in the envelope.\nAt the moment when the envelope was opened my eyes did not\nquit the card which Leonie drew from the envelope till the moment\nwhen I had recognised what it was. Often I withdrew the card myself,\nin which case no trickery was possible. Unfortunately, in some cases,\nwhich I have very wrongly omitted to note, Leonie, as I have said,\nwithdrew the card herself. I followed it with my eyes carefully when\nshe did not show it to me immediately, and I am sure that it was in\nfact the card withdrawn from the envelope which she showed me. Still,\nthis is a small flaw in my method, necessitating, to my great regret, a\nDigitized by Google\n\fLucidity or Olairvoya'nC6. '17\ncertain reserve in my expressions of absolute certitude. The reader,\ndoubtless, will consider my scruples as exaggerated; for it is absurd to\nassume in Leonie a manual skill greater than that of the most accom-\nplished conjurer. To make the card in the envelope disappear, and to\nreplace it by another at 25 centimetres from me,-that is all but\nimpossible; and if I give expression to this objection it is not that I\nsuppose that Leonie could have tricked me in these experiments, but\nbecause I desire to suggest against myself all the objections which can\npossibly be made. This objection, then, seems to me to have little force,\nfor the following reasons :-\n1. Because the good faith of Leonie was almoBe a.1UJayB complete.\n(On this point a special discussion will be needed.)\n2. Because in many oases-half at least of the cases-it would have\nbeen absolutely impossible for her to use any trickery.\n3. Because it would be necessary to credit her with an incredible\nskill in prestidigitation, of which she certainly is quite devoid. She\nbarely knows the names of the cards.\nWe come, then, to the question of Leonie's good faith. I need not\nsay that I am not speaking of simulation of the hypnotic trance. This\nshe does not and cannot simul\"te. But there is in her a double\nexistence. She is Leonie when she is awake, and Leontine when she\nis entranced. Leonie and Leontine are two quite distinct personages ;\nand assuredly Leontine does not simulate the trance; her entranced\nstate is as real as Leonie's waking state.\nBut this Leontine has a very active and definite character of her\nown. She has tastes, affections, memories, which have created for her\na real personality. It would then be quite possible that there should\nbe, not indeed simulation of the trance, but trickery in the trance,\nwhich is a very different thing. The question is : Is Leontine capable\nof deceiving me ~\nTo my great regret she ia so capable. I am obliged to state that I\nhave once caught her actually cheating me; 1 and this, in fact, is the\n1 The wayin which LOOntine oheated. during one of thOll8 states ofunoonsciousn888\nof whioh I spoke above, was this: I had drawn a card and marked it, without seeing it,\nand taken it into the next room. Then I told her to try to gIl888 it.

But\na fraud of Leontine's is not the same thing as a fraud of an ordinary\nperson, on account of the complexity of Madame B.'s constitution.\nWe have, as already said, Leonie, the waking personage, Leontine, the\nentranced personage, and moreover Leonore, a different personage,\nwhose somnambulism is extremely profound, a.nd on whom M. Perrier,\nand afterwa.rds M. Janet, have made some instructive experiments.\nBesides these three different personalities, characterised by memories\nspecial to each, there are others also-Leonora, let us say, for\ninstance-corresponding to Madame B.'s condition of spontaneous\nsomnambulism during normal sleep,l and perhaps other states of\nconsciousness, of which we have no knowledge.\nThus Leontine sometimes performs actions of which she retains no\nrecollection. She writes whole phrases without knowing that she\nhas written them. M. Pierre Janet has taught her to do this;\nso that I should be tempted to believe that if there has been fraud on\nLeontine's part, that fraud has been unconscious. This distinction is\nimportant from a moral point of view; but from our present experi-\nmental standpoint it ought to inspire us with a great distrust, a\nmarked prudence in our conclusions. I only insist, therefore, on the\n15 experiments above given, because I am certain that no conjurer,\nhowever accomplished, could have told me the 12 cards which Leonie\ndid actually tell me.\nPART II.\nThe experiments described above were made ill June and July,\n1888. They did not completely satisfy either my friends or me; in\nfact, though they are conclusive aga.inst the hypothesis of chance, they\ndo not show in an absolutely irrefutable manner that there is not some\nsort of extraordinary visual (retinal) acuity, and, moreover, they leave\na not altogether negligible place for the hypothesis of trickery.\nIt was necessary therefore to try to meet this two-fold objection,\nand, on this account, I tried two new series of experiments with\nLeonie. .\nThe defective points in the former experiments are :-\n(a) Leontine may change the envelope that I give her containing\nthe card to be guessed, and, having with her an envelope containing a\nsimilar card, may present it to me as if it were the envelope that I\nhad given her.\n1 Ordinary nomenclature is quite inadequate to represent these different phaaea.\n\fLucidity 0'1' Clairvoyance. 79\n(6) Leontine may open the envelope that I give her, take the\ncard out, look at it, shut up the envelope again and pretend to have\nguessed it.\n(c) Leontine may hide a. card in her hand, and, when she openll\nthe envelope herself, ma.y give it to me as the one gue886d.\nI ha.ve already expla.ined that these three objections are not, in my\nopinion, valid, for\n(1) I hardly took my eyes off L. from the moment when I gave\nher the envelope, and there was never any suspicious gesture, 1108 if\nshe were attempting to unfllo8ten the two superposed envelopes. One\nknows how difficult it is to unfllo8ten a gummed envelope.\n(2) The envelope that I gave her WIlo8 almost (but not quite)\nalways marked, so that the substitution of another for it was im-\npossible.\n(3) From the moment when L. opened the envelope, I absolutely\nnever took my eyes off the card that she took out of it, and, in some\ncases, I opened the envelope myself.\nBut although these objections do not seem to me to have much\nforce, the fact of their being raised demands for them a complete\nrefutation. I therefore took the following precautions :-\n(1) The selected card was marked, and I kept in my pocket the\nten packs of cards from which I had taken it.\n(2) The envelope in which the card was put was sealed with\nsealing\u00b7wax and had a special mark.\n(3) I opened the envelope myself, and, when once Leonie had\ndesignated the card, she touched neither it nor the envelope.\nThese precautions are such that no conjurer could find satisfactory\nobjections to them.\nI uiade two series of experiments with Leonie; the first in Mr.\nMyers' house at Cambridge from Thursday, January 31st, to February\n15th, 1889. This series failed completely, which seems to happen when\nthe series of experiments is not sufficiently prolonged. Thus, for the\ncards of the first part-the first experiment was on July 10th. But I\nhad hypnotised Leonie at intervals since May 20th, that is, for a month\nand a half.\nThe last I16ries of experiments was carried out at my house in Paris,\nfrom July 12th to August 26th, under the conditions described above,\nthe only difference being that, having no more\" opaque\" envelopes, I\nused some which are not opaque to transmitted light and the card in\nthe envelope was then enclosed in a second envelope, 80 that each card\nwas in a double envelope. Of course I satisfied myself that the card\nthus enclosed was absolutely invisible to our normal eyes.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\f80 Further Experiments in Hypnotic\nThis series of experiments is tabula.ted below, with the same\narrangement as before.\n'3-& Card\nOard Oard\nDate. in gu~\ndrawn at Remarks.\n~~ Envelope. by hazard.\nLeonie\n1 July 13 28 H QS\n2\n\"\n9H S 2D\n3\n\"\n4H D 38 (A.maIl card, thatis, 2, 3, 4 or5.\n4 July 14 60 8 9B She wrote O.\n5 .. 10D 0 AO 8he wrote D\u2022\n6 .. 10D 0 8S\n7\n\"\nQD 0 QH 8he wrote O.\n8 July 15 KH 0 3H\n9\n\"\n100 H QD\n10\n\"\n9D 8 3D\n11 July 17 80 8 60 She wrote O.\n12\n\"\n7D 0 KO\n13 July 18 8H 0 2H She wrote H.\n14\n\"\n30 H 5H She wrote O.\n15\n\"\n58 S QS\n16 July 21 20 0 80\n17\n\"\nKnH 0 8D\n18\n\"\n60 0 AH\n)\n19 July 22 Kn8 F8 lOB\n20\n\"\n2D 8 80\n21 July 29 48 S AH She wrote H.\n22\n\"\n88 S 20 8he wrote S.\n23\n\"\nKD Q8 KnS She said suddenly: \"There is a\nJUly 30\nfigure, a queen or a king.\"\n24- AH D 2H She drew ~eraistently an ace on\nKnS Kn8\nthe enve ope and wrote O.\n25\n\"\nKnD\n26 July 31 AO 4D 10H\n'n\n\"\n38 3H 70 She said 8.all the time,and3 of S.\n28, Aug. 1 58 28 KnS\n29\n\"\n5D D KS She laid: \"A.maIl D.\n30 Aug. 4 AS 8 5S\n31\n\"\n8H 80 2H\nFrom this experiment onwards. the cards were put into a three-fold envelope\n32 Aug. 4 40 H 8D\n33\n\"\n7D S 10D\n34 Aug. 6 2D 5S KnH\n35\n\"\n60 0 10D\n36 Aug. 10 KS 2H 4H She said: \"It isa figure,\" at the\nmoment when I was going to\n3'1 ..

Kn8 FO QO\nAlthough if we take the whole of this second series of experi-\nments, the amount of success is not more than we might have\nexpeeted by chance, there is, I think, nevertheleaa, some evidence point-\ning to lucidity. Leonie only attempted to gue88 anything more than\nthe suit in 25 cases ; in 9 of those 25 cases she gueBSed that the card\nwas a court-ca.rd, and in 7 out of the 9 this was true. In 5 of these\ncases, moreover, she gueBSed rightly the suit to which the court-card\nbelonged. Only once, when a court-ca.rd was drawn and she attempted\nto guess more than the suit, did she fail to designate it as a court-e&rd.\nThis certainly looks like some abnormal capacity for discerning court-\ncarda, especially when we remember that it was mainly in guessing\ncourt-cards and aces that she succeeded in the first series.\nCONCLUSION.\nAs to the conclusions to be drawn from this long series of experi-\nmenta, there are only four poaaihle hypotheses.\n(1) Some defect in the experimentation.\n(2) Chance.\n(3) Some exceptional acutene88 in retinal vision or in the sense of\ntouch.\n(4) Some capacity of obtaining knowledge, whose modus opera7Kii\nis absolutely unknown to us.\nG\nDigitized by Google\n\f82 Furtlter Experiments in Hypnotic\n(1) As far a.s I can see, there WI\\S no defect of experimentation in\nthe second series of trials. I have not the presumption or conceit to\naffirm that there wa.s none, but, for my part, I do not see in what point\nthe experiments can be defective. The card is marked by me and put\ninto three envelopes sealed with sealing-wax; Leonie attempts to guess\nit in my sight. I take it out of the envelope myself, and I only take\naccount of her final guess.\nIn the first series the defect in the experiments was very slight,\nso slight that I myself consider the experiments to be valid: the\nhypothesis that Leonie cheated me a.s often a.s would be required to\naccount for her success-by substituting a card chosen by her for the\none that I had taken, or another envelope for the envelope that I gave\nher-seems to me absurd. Experiment 57, besides, tells against this\ngreatly strained explanation, and so does the fact that so large a\nproportion-13 out of 17-of the cards fully guessed were court-cards\nand aces.\nWe must then &Ccept the experiments of the second series as\nirreproachable and those of the first series as almost irreproachable.\n(2) Ohance cannot be credited with the designations of the first\nseries. In fact the probability of guessing 12 out of 15 cards right is\nso small that it is absolutely certain that chance could not produce\nsuch a series.\nThe experiments of the second part are less conclusive, but Leonie's\nsuccess in designating court-cards in these experiments appears to me\nto afford distinct confirmation of the first series. It would certainly\nhave been more satisfactory if the second series of experiments had\nbeen a.s successful a.s the first, but nevertheless, I think, we may con-\nclude from the two series taken together that neither chance nor\ntrickery will explain Leonie's success.\n(3) We are left, then, to the two other hypotheses of visual or tactile\nhyperacuity on the one part, and on the other part of a faculty of\nknowledge whose modus agendi is unknown to us.\nAnd first as to tactile hyperesthesia. The pips and the figures are\npainted on the cards, and rise in a relief which, though very slight, might\nenable a person whose sense of touch was abnormally acute to recog-\nnise a card enclosed in an envelope. But I do not regard it as possible\nthat this could be done through two thicknesses of paper. The sense of\ntouch which could a.ccomplish this feat would be very unlike the\nsense of touch which we actually know.\nIs it then to be explained by some specially keen power of retinal\nvision 7\nThat is possible, and I confess that my mind is not quite made up on\n-this point. The fact that Leonie discerns court-ca.rds and aces especially\nDigitized by Google\n\fLucidity or Clairvoyance. 83\nwell would seem to point to retinal vision. But on the other hand,\nthe addition of a second envelope did not affect the result. Also the\nentranced Leontine seems to have her eycs closed. I believe that the\neyelids are only lowered, and that the rays of light, half-intercepted\nby the eyelids, do reach the retina, but at any rate she never looks\nat anything except with nearly closed eyes, and allowing only a small\nmy of light to enter beneath her eyelids, and this is by no means a\nconvenient way to look at things. And further, she does not attempt\nto take the cards into the sunlight or lamplight.\nMoreover, in judging of this question we must not leave out of\naccount the numerous instances of lucidity shown by Leonie a.nd other\nsomnambules, in cases where it cannot be due to retinal vision. (See,\ne.g., the example quoted by me on p. 164, Proceeding\" Part XII.)\nI may add that even if it be retinal vision, a retinal vision so much\nmore developed than ours would almost amount to a new percepti\\\"e\nfaculty.\n(4) We have, consequently, to admit the existence of some faculty\nentirely unknown to us-lucidity or 8econd-sight-whichever name is\napplied to it-which is to be met with quite exceptionally in certain\nsubjects, and, even with them, quite irregularly and with no possibility\nhitherto of determining the conditions of its occurrence.\nBut the method that I have adopted to prove this important fact is\npurely empirical and cannot carry conviction with it. In the\nexperimental sciences, one thing is necessary, viz., to be able to control\nthe conditions of the experiment. If a chemist were to find a new\nsubstance and were to declare himself unable to sa.y how he found it\nor to produce it again, nobody would listen to him, a.nd that would\nperhaps be reasonable. In the same way, I have obtained some\nphenomena of lucidity, but I frankly declare myself unable to tell how\nI obtained them or why I succeeded sometimes and sometimes failed,\nand I cannot undertake to produce them again. This is empiricism,\nnot science.\nI cannot, however, draw from this any discouraging conclusion.\nOn the contrary, we have here a whole series of absolutely new\nphenomena immersed in deep shadow, like every science in its infancy.\nThe problem then must be attacked resolutely but methodically,\nas in experimental sciences. Perhaps after all the so-called occult\nsciences are only a chapter in Physical Science-a singularly delicate\nPhysical Science-and I am firmly convinced that we must have\nrecourse to Physical Science in attempting some explanation and some\ndefinition of these phenomena, which, to my mind, are certain but\ninexplicable.\nG2\nDigitized by Google\n\f84 Dup~ Per8onality.\nv.\nDUPLEX PERSONALITY.\nAN ESSAY ON THE ANALOGY BETWEEN HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA AND CEBTAIN\nEXPERIENCES OP THE NORMAL CONSCIOUSNESS.1\nBy THOMAS BABKWORTH\u2022\n.. A good use of unoommon things is to force us to look more curiously at the\nmeaning of common things which we overlook habitually.\"-M.a.uD8LEY.\nSeejng that no result ca.n be produced experimentally in an organ-\nism, of which the ca.uses and the constituents are not pre-existent in it,\nit would be strange indeed if the remarkable performances of hypnotised\npersons had no parallel in the experiences of daily life. For, however\nwidely the one may differ from the other in the degrees and nlodes of\nmanifestation, there will be sufficient resemblance in their nature and\noperation to enable us to recognise them as symptoms of the same\nfunctions, or effects of the same forces. Naturally, the first class\naffords the most attractive subjects for speculation, being more clearly\ndefined, more salient in feature, and more startling in results; but\ngranting these points of vantage, and allowing moreover that beyond\ntheir inherent interest they have a relative value in throwing light\nupon the constitution of mind in abnormal states, I am inclined to\nthink that one of their chief points of interest will prove to be the\ndirecting of attention to corresponding normal features, laws, and\noperations of mind, which we might otherwise leave unnoticed although\ncontinually in presence of them.\nAs an instance I may point to those indica.tions of distinct phases\nof consciousneSli which have been termed \"Duplex\" or \"Multiplex\nPersonality.\" At present it seems to me that\" Duplex Persollality\"\nwould be a term wide enough to cover nearly all the phenomena\nrecorded; but at all events, without these and similar investigations,\nthe Unity of human consciousness would have remained a dogma\nunshaken and almost unchallenged. It is to the manifestation of this\nDuplex Personality-called elsewhere, and in relation to other C8oIIeS,\nprimary and secondary consciousness-that I wish to address myself,\nwith the object of showing how their comparatively dissevered and\nalmost opposite action is not only observable in the hypnotic state,\nbut also in the every-day actions of life, and that it is chiefly owing\n1 What is here published is a portion of an e88&Y by Mr. Barkworth, somewhat\nenlarged since it was read at a meeting of the Society on January 25th, 1889.

The actions of the hypnotic state, on the other hand,\nare largely chal\"l\\Cterised by what may be called automatism; that is to\nMY, being started by suggestionl they seem to be carried on without\nvolition until the effect of the impulse dies out, or until the suggested\naction is fully completed, and cannot therefore be any longer continued,\nor until the suggestion is changed, or put an end to, by the operator.2\nIn these cases, however, it is only the execution and not the initiation\nof the movements which is automatic, the suggestion for them being\nexternal to the subject's own personality.\nHypnotic subjects are usually so harried with suggestions as to have\nlittle opportunity for showing what they would do if permitted to follow\ntheir own inclinations, and just as any absurdity seems in dreams to be\nperfectly natural and commonplace, so in the hypnotic trance the most\nbizarre notions can be imposed upon a subject without arousing in him\nany sense of incongruity. A man can be made to believe that he\nis a hen, and to chuckle and spread his wings over an imaginary brood\nof chickens, but neither in this case, nor in the more or less similarly\nabsurd dreams which are often experienced in natural sleep, does any\nsense of improbability, still less of the ludicrous, seem to strike the\nsleeper. I except, however, those dreams which the harassed, over-\nworked man suffers from when he, in sleep, goes over again the\nanxieties and worries of the day's study or business, or rehearses those\nof the morrow. In this case his sleep is not sufficiently profound to let\nthe reasoning powers rest, or in the language of hypnotists, his primary\nconsciousness is not completely inhibited, consequently his dreams are,\neven painfully, rational and coherent, and he commonly remarks on\nwaking that he feels fatigued rather than refreshed. We have, how-\never, instances of complete automatism in the case of the sleep-walker\nwho goes through a variety of complicated actions entirely self-sug-\ngested.

Thus the\nsomnambulic dairymaid will tum the chum,the needlewoman will work\naway at the unfinished garment, to the completion of which she has\nbeen anxiously looking to provide her weekly rent, and so on. A far\nrarer and more interesting case, of which instances are not wanting, is\nthat of the sleep\u00b7walker, whose actions are .aot only not suggested by the\nmemories of his waking life, but are of such a nature as he could not\nperform in his wakingstate, e.g., physically-walking or climbing along\nthe edges of roofs or narrow parapets where a single false step would\nbe death;1 mentally-writing poetry, or composing music above the\nlevel of his ordinary powers. In these last-named cases automatism\nseems to rise to intuition.\nHaving thus distinguished between actions mental or physical,\nwhich are (a) voluntary, (b) suggested and automatic, and (c) intuitive\nand automatic, we may now Pl'OCeed to inquire how far the two latter\nstates are exhibited in the ordinary actions of healthy persons in their\nwaking hours, bearing in mind that in their case the term suggestion\nmust be restricted to the self-imposed dictates of their own will auto-\nmatically executed.\n(A) On the first of these classes there is no need to dwell. The\nmental processes and actions comprised in it cause or constitute the\nvast majority of the conscious acts of sane persons. The will not only\ndetermines upon them,but presides over their fulfilment,and they attain\ntheir end by a succession, or a combination of thoughts, or thoughtful\nacts, consciously planned, or co-ordinated, to a definite intelligible end.\nIn reading a book, in writing (not copying) a letter, in conversation,\nand in all forms of study wo have examples of this class.\n(B) The second class, which includes the bulk of the phenomena\nwith which it is my present purpose to deal, presents to us voluntary\nand automatic consciousness acting in combination, but far more inde-\npendently than is commonly supposed.

The mind having in the meantime become engaged with other\nsubjects, the limbs nevertheless continue to perform the prescribed\naction until the mind, being recalled to the subject, chooses to arrest or\nvary it.\n1. The simplest cases in illustration of this are those of walking,\neating, or dressing, where the action once voluntarily commenced is\ncontinued to completion, although the mind has in the meanwhile\nbecome wholly engrossed with another subject. The case is shown much\nmore clearly, however, when the suggestion takes the form of a standing\norder engrained by habit. If a good hypnotic subject were ordered\nthus: \"Every morning at nine o'clock you will leave your house and\nwalk to- the end of the street where you will catch the bus,\" he would\ndo so until the suggestion wore off.\nNow, let it be supposed that a man who is usually accustomed to\ndo this very thing, one morning receives a letter, which absorbs his\nattention at the time when he is leaving his house to go in a new and\ndifferent direction. If his mind be so engrossed with the letter as to be\nwithdrawn from considering his destination, and so from imposing a\nnew suggestion upon his movements, the old suggestion will continue to\noperate, and he will from \"force of habit,\" as it is termed, walk to the\nend of the street and perhaps even get into the \"bus,\" and proceed some\ndistance, till his mind, accidentally recalled to the subject, peremptorily\nsuggests to him to stop the \"bus\" and retrace his route. This is\ncalled \"absence of mind\" to which some persons are more subject than\nothers, just as some persons are better hypnotic subjects than others.\nH you have an office or chambers from which you set out to transact\nbusiness at another place, afterwards returning to your own office, the\nhabit ofalways returning there will become a standing suggestion, and\nwhen a day comes that you have three or four places to go to instead\nof one, you will find, if your mind is much engrossed with business, that\ninstead of going the round of these places at once, you persist in\nreturning to your own quarters between each call, and to your great\nvexation have to go back more or less over the same ground, just when\nyou arrive at your own door. This is a case taken from repeated\nexperience.\n2. The case becomes more interesting when the action is more com-\nplicated. It is often found that in reading music at the pianoforte, for\ninstance-it matters not whether the piece is seen for the first time or\nnot-the player will frequently allow his mind to wander to other\ntopics, and become so interested in them as quite to forget what he is\ndoing, and cease to be conscious of any attention to it. Nevertheless\nthe suggestion having been originally imposed by the mind to play the\nDigitized by Google\n\f88 Duplex Personality.\nmusic, the fingers will continue automatically to do so, and the eyes to\nfollow the type, while all the time the thoughts and the attention are\nfar away, and this will continue until something occurs to recall the\nmind to the music, such as reaching the end of the piece, or coming to\na passage presenting new difficulties for consideration-such as the\nmode of fingering it-when normal and conscious exercise of the\nintellect or reasoning power is called for to solve the new question\nthus raised. This case is a distinct and marked advance upon the\nformer one. In that the action was only the simple act of walking\ncontinuously in a given direction, repeating the same movement of the\nlegs till the goal was reached, while in the case of the pianoforte\nplayer there are the separate movements of ten fingers ooordinated to\none end, not monotonous, but varied in every successive bar, read\nand followed from the printed page, yet all done without consciousness\nof the ordinary kind, and with no exercise of the will beyond the first\nsuggestion which started it. With this case may be compared those\nplanchette experiments related by the late Mr. Gurney (Proceedings\nof the Society for Psychical Research, Part XI., No.3) in which certain\nsuggestions of words to be written, or of calculations, were offered to a\nsubject during hypnotisation. Being then awakened and made to\nread aloud, his band on a planchette, he automatically executed the sug-\ngested task, although his mind was wholly given to the book. The\nperformance of music affords, however, a still more striking illustration\nof the relative functions of the primary and the secondary conscious-\nness. In learning a new instrument, the production of each note is for\na long time a separate intellectual act. The choice of the note in\ncorrespondence with the printed sign upon the page, the mode of pro-\nducing it with the lips, or the bow, in combination with the fingers,\nare all subjects of distinct thoughts, of which we are definitely aware.\nBy slow degrees and continued practice the action tends to become\nautomatic, that is to say the sight of the printed note suggests\ninstinctively to the lips and the fingers those combined movements which\nare necessary to produce it. At length there comes a time when we\npass from the one state to the other, and, when playing a scale, for\ninstance, we abandon the attempt to think of each note separately,\nand simply starting from the top of the scale, and trusting ourselves\nto automatic guidance, we arrive at the bottom of it we know not how;\nand after further practice are enabled to play the scale with a rapidity\nwhich defies the effort to follow with the mind the separate pro-\nduction or fingering of the notes. Not only is the action of the primary\nor voluntary consciousness of no use here, but the attempt to exercise it\nis a distinct obstacle to success, and we have in this fact one reason why\n\"nervousness\" causes performers to fail or \"break down,\" as it is called.\nThe anxiety to do well and the fear of failure cause the player, instead\nDigitized by Google\n\fDtuple:e PersO'll4lity. 89\nof abandoning bimself to the action of bis automatic faculties, to\nobtrude operations of thought and will upon his fingers, and as his\nthoughts are not capable of following his fingenl with sufficient\nrapidity, there ensues a want of correspondenCle between the two modes\nof action, the first not being able to keep pace with the second,\nwhich, as it were, is tripped up. The player is in fact thinking\nof one note when he is playing another, although he may not be able\nto discern the fact.\nA physiological account of this phenomenon is given by Ferrier\n(Functions ofthe Brain, pp. 252-3) as follows :-\n\" We have reason from the facts of comparative physiology to regard the\ncorpora striats as the centresin which these habitual orautomatic movements\nbecome organised. \u2022 Though the consciousneaa of sensory\nimpreaions must precede any truly volitional act in response thereto, we\nfind that by education and frequent repetition the action becomes 80 easy as\nto follow impression without conscious discrimination or attention, the nexus\nbetween impression and action becoming 80 organically welded in the sensory\nand motorcentre. as to assume the character of reflex action below the domain\nof consciousness. In this case we may suppose thatimpressions made on the\norgans of sense travel up to the optic thalami, and thence pass directly to\nthe corporastriata instead of takillg the larger or conscious circle through the\nsensory and motor centres of the hemispheres. . . \u2022 We may express it\nthus that in actions requiring conscious discrimination, and voluntary eftort,\nthelarger circle of the hemispheres is involved, but that in the actions which\nhave become habitual and automatic, the larger circle is groatly relieved by\nthe organic nexus between impression and action which baa been established\nin the sensory and motor basal ganglia.\"\nThe physiological theory thus stated may suffice to account for the\nsimpler classes of automatic actions. But even here it is noteworthy\nthat the distinguished writer from whom I bave quoted, in his\nendeavour to show that the reactions in question are \" outside the sphere\nof psychical activity properly so called,\" is unable even to state his own\nview without resorting to the language of metaphor when he speaks of\nthe \" nexus between impression and action becoming organically welded\nin the sensory and motor centres\" :-we might safely challenge the\nauthor to show us anatomically the \"organic weld\" of which he speaks.\nWe shall, however, presently see that both in hypnotic experiments\nand in ordinary states of consciousness there is abundant evidence of\npsychical activities, involving the action of the hemispheres and the\nhigher centres of the brain, which nevertheless are outside the domain\nof normal consciousness and volition.\nThe higher we go in tracing the physical correlative of the mental\nprocess the more difficult it becomes to locate it. While the merely\nsomatic energies, whether motor or sensory, can be assigned with reason-\nable certainty to their respective centres, the higher seats of thought\nDigitized by Google\n\f90 Dwplex Per80'f1,(J},ity.\nand reason cannot be found at all. The most that Dr. Ferrier feels hin}-\nself entitled to say on this point is that\" there is nothing inherently\nimprobable in the view that frontal development in special regions\nmay be indicative of the power of concentration of thought and intel-\nlectual capacity in special directions,\" although considerable portions of\nthe frontal lobes may be removed without any obvious impairment of\nfunction. Nor do they respond to electrical stimulation.\nAt this point I shall venture to change the nomenclature which is\nusually employed-and which I have so far myself used-to designate\nthe two modes of consciousness that I have distinguished, viz., primary\nand secondary. These terms appear to me objectionable as implying\neither (1) an order of succession in time which is not found in the\nfacts, or (2) a difference in moral dignity or functional importance\nwhich is at present a mere assumption. The terms\" active\" and CI pas-\nsive \" consciousness seem to ~e better adapted to express my own view\nof the duality of consciousness, and I propose therefore to adopt them\nin future. Under the head of CI active consciousness\" I shall include\nall those voluntary operations of the mind which normally determine\nour actions; while referring to CI passive consciousneBB\" all the phe-\nnomena of automatism, whether in the normal or hypnotic state, and\nthe power which, while employed to carry out the suggestions of the\nwill, either of the individual himself or of another person, is occasion-\nally able to transcend the behests laid upon it with highly interesting\nresults.\n3. We may now advance to higher forms of the exhibition of the\np888ive consciousness. In walking we had an instance of simple auto-\nmatism; in playing, of combined and complicated automatic action,\nbut in neither case was the passive consciousness called upon to do any-\nthing more than follow Dlechanically a prescribed course of action,\nindicated in the first instance by the initial movement of the limbs set\ngoing by the will, and, in the second case, by the notes printed on a\nsheet of music. In the case of adding up long columns of addition,\nhowever, we get to something beyond either of these. Here, again, the\naction is at first voluntary throughout, and gradually tends to become\nautomatic. A beginner needs aU his attention, the addition of each\nfigure as he ascends the column being a problem to be separately con-\nsidered; but I have found that by degrees it is possible to cease think-\ning of the figures, and by collstant practice to be able to add with great\nrapidity and correctness while the mind is far away and busily engaged\nwith other subjects. Here there is no longer a merely monotonous\nmovement to be kept up, nor a printed guide to be followed, but a\nsuccession of independent mental actions which are not foreseen, nor\ntaken at second-hand from a. printed page, but arise spontaneously and\nadapt themselves to any combination of figures.\nDigitized by Google\n\fDuplex Per80'1\/,ality. 91\nThe fact that these combinations are not foreseen, and yet are dealt\nwith as fast as they arise, would at first sight seem to show that the\npassive consciousness was capable of originating as well as of executing\npsychical actions. Further consideration will, however, disprove thi~\nso far as the present case goes. We have here, in fact, the develop-\nment of the operation of standing suggestions. It has become a stand-\ning order of the mind that two and two make four, and that nine and\nfour make thirteen, and so on; and hence it is no longer necessary for\nthe mind to re-enact the rule on every separate occasion, but the passive\nconsciousness automatically obeys it, although the mind is \"absent.\" A\nparallel case in hypnotics is thus related by Mr. Gurney (Proceedings,\nPart XII., pp. 4 and 5 )\n.. A large number of experimenta were made in the working out of SUDl8\nby the \u2022secondary intelligence,' the sum being given to the subject while he\nwas in the hypnotic state, and the 8D8wer being written down by him\nautomatically with a planchette, while he was in the normal state, and wholly\nunaware both of the act of reckoning and of what he was writing. \u2022\nHe was made to place his right hand on the planchette \u2022 hi. attention being\noccupied by reading aloud' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 or some similar device...\nThe italics are my own.\nIn these cases and that of unconscious sight reading of music, it\ndoes not seem possible to consider the mental action (which is applied,\nfor the first time, to a new subject requiring the exercise of much\nhigher than merely mechanical powers), as being a.ccomplished by the\nshorter circuit of which Dr. Ferrier writes. We must therefore con-\nclude that automatic processes are occasionally wrought out in the\nhigher cerebral tracts also. \u2022\nA curious case bearing on the same point was mentioned by Mr.\nMyers at ono of the meetings of the Society for Psychical Research. A\ncertain clerk in a French office having been hypnotised was told that\ntwo and two made five. Next day all his work went wrong, and it\nwas not for some time discovered that he had in every place, when two\nand two came together, added them as five. In his case the standing\norder of his own intellect to consider two and two a.s four had been\nsuperseded by the new injunction which continued to operate, although\nhe had no recollection of receiving it.\n(C) We now come to the consideration of the third class of mental\nand physical actions, those, namely, which I have ventured to d~8Cribe\nas not only automatic but intuitive. I mean by this term actions that\nappear to involve intuitive mental powers. I am aware, of course,\nthat the existence of such powers is denied by some metaphysicians,\nwho attribute the performance of actions which can be acquired neither\nby instruction, nor by personal experience, to hereditary instinct, and\nthe embodied experience of the race. This denial is not surprising,\nDigitized by Google\n\f92 Duplea; Personality.\nsince if we allow the existence of purely intuitive powers, we seem\nvirtually to assert that effects can exist without a cause. Nevertheless\nthere remains a class of phenomena which apparently fulfils this very\ndefinition, and although far from asserting that there is no cause for\nthem, I think it is impossible in our present state of knowledge to\nshow the cause, and I therefore adopt the word intuitive, provisionally,\nto describe them.\nI will take as a first, and typical, instance of intuitive thought\nand action, the case of musical improvisation. The power of improvis-\ning music so as to employ the full capacity of the instrument, and to do\nso with unhesitating fluency and without any conscious effort of the\nmind, is somewhat rare; and in describing it, I am compelled to rely\nchiefly on my own experience. Where this power exists it exhibits the\nfaculty of intuitive passive consciousness in full exercise. The will\nis entirely inoperative. Not only is no decision formed as to the theme\nor its modifications, but there is not even any knowledge of what the next\nbar will be. Thus I have constantly sat and listened to my own impro\nvisations, with as much interest as, and with no more knowledge of,\nwhat was coming next, than another listener would have, and this\nstatement applies not only to melody or theme, but to the most elabor-\nate modulations of harmony, effected equally, moreover, without any\ndependence on a theoretical knowledge of music, and in accordance with\nsome unknown instinct.\nWe have seen that in those actions which are suggested\nand automatic, the will is able to control the passive conscious-\nness sufficiently to initiate them and to ensure their ultimate\nfulfilment. It is far otherwise with those which are intuitive\nand automatic. The will of the player may seat him at the organ, but\nall its efforts will not cause ideas to flow. The faculty will, indeed, not\nbeing extinguished but only dormant, respond to a limited extent-the\nlimits being those of habit, and of facility resulting from experience\n-but the result will be poor and tame, and will disappoint no one more\nthan the performer himself. The fact of effort, then, will at once prove\nthe absence of inspiration, and warn the artist to desist.\nThe independence of the will shown by the passive consciousness in\nits higher manifestation of intuitive power is, in fact, one of its most\nremarkable characteristics; and the efforts of will not only fail to\ninduce these manifestations, but tend to hinder them, by disturbing that\nserene and complete absorption in the task, which is essential. It seems\nhighly probable that the extraordinary powers of impromptu versification\nshown by Theodore Hook and the late Mr. Serjeant Payne were of the\nsame intuitive kind as the faculty of musical improvisation above spoken\nof. To sit down to\u00b7 the piano at a moment's notice and reel off verse\nafter verse of rhyme, without any consciousness of effort and without\nDigitized by Google\n\fDuplex Per8onality. 93\nthe least previous preparation, seems to imply intuitive power able to\ndispense with the ordinary process of intellectual construction. For\nconsider, in the composition of even the simplest verses on a given\nsubject, according to the usual method, how many elements of construc-\ntion have to be kept in view. There is, first, the rhythm or correct\nsylla.bic balance of the lines; next the rhyme requiring a word to be\nfound at the end of each line phonetically in correspondence with the\none above, and, concurrently with these, the invention of coherent\nsentences which shall not only convey definite ideas, but shall do so with\nso much wit and appropriateness as to cause the greatest amusement\nto the company. I think it probable that if Mr. Hook or Mr. Payne\nhad been asked the question, they would have said that their conscious\nmental participation in the performance was confined to that of a\nlistener, and that they were wholly unable to say how it was produced,\nor to foresee the termination of a verse at the beginning of it.\nTo a limited extent, and with important modifications, the same\npowers are exhibited by an orator. The subjects of an oration are, of\ncourse, prepared entirely by the voluntary activity. of the intellect, so\nare also the order in which they come, and similar intellectual activity\nis very seldom entirely absent during delivery. But in the\nextemporaneous composition of individual sentences there is much that\nseems intuitive. A sentence will be begun of which the conclusion is\nnot foreseen. Words rise at the right moment spontaneously to com-\nplete it. Sometimes, indeed, when the speaker is searching either his\nmemory or his notes for the next head of his discourse, his mind will be\nso occupied with this endeavour that he has for a few sentences to\ntrust almost entirely to the phrase-fonning intuition to keep him going\ntill he is ready to start on the new subject. In proportion as he is able\nto abandon himself to this phrase-forming faculty with confidence, so\nwill his address be fluent and unconstrained, and so also will he reap\nthe advantage of being able to concentrate his mind upon the more\nimportant task of marshalling his subjects and elaborating his argu-\nment. In an unpractised speaker, or at the commencement of a speech,\nwe see the same hindrance offered by the intrusion of the will upon the\nautomatic powers which we previously noted in the case of the musical\nperformer. The self-conscious speaker, unable to trust him-\nself to automatic guidance, labours to compose each sentence\nseparately, and consequently trips and stumbles like the player on an\ninstrument to which he is not accustomed. In connection with the\nautomatic power of phrase-forming I may here mention a fact drawn\nfrom my own experience. It often happens that in the drewsy con-\ndition of incipient slumber, when the active consciousness is almost\ninhibited though not entirely lost, phrases form themselves spon-\ntaneously in the mind, having relation to no subject in particular,\nDigitized by Google\n\f940 Duplex Personality.\nentirely disjointed from one another, and of course devoid of any\nconnected sense. Thill suggests an interesting question, viz., whether,\nwhen the condition passes from drowsiness into sleep, these broken\nfragments of language ever weld themselves into a coherent whole) and\nif so, what may be the effect produced 1 Now, it sometimes has\nhappened to persons, entirely devoid as they and their friends suppose of\nany poetic faculty, to dream of reciting or reading long pieces of poetry-.\nThey seem in their dream to be reading or reciting it without the\nslightest effort of either memory or invention, and to continue some-\ntimes for a space that would occupy several pages. Yet, on waking, not\na word is remembered. The question then arises: Did I, in my\ndream, repeat real lines of poetry, or did I only fancy that I was doing\nso upon a merely general idea of poetry in the mass 1 The latter idea is\nusually accepted by the person himself, on the ground that as he could\nnot possibly write poetry with any amount of effort when he was awake,\nit would be incredible that he should compose it without effort when he\nwas asleep. I have lately, however, had occasion to doubt this con-\nclusion. Dreaming of being at the Royal Academy and of referring to\nthe catalogue for the name of a picture, I found it, as is often really\nthe case, described not by a title, but by a verse of poetry ha.ving\nrelation to its subject. I read off this verse with the same total\nabsence of effort and unconsciousness of invention that attends all\ndreams, and, as it happened, instantly woke. The verse is not worth\nquoting, but it rhymed and scanned correctly, had a metaphorical\napplication quite appropriate to the subject of the picture, and (what\nis most significant) it would have heen quite beyond my powers to\nhave invented it when awake. What followed was equally curious.\nWhile I lay for some time ina drowsy state, the phrase-forming\nfaculty I have before alluded to seemed to have been set going by the\ndream, only that, instead of broken fragments of prose, there ensued\nbroken snatches of verse, fragments of lines entirely disconnected,\nboth as to subject and matter.\nIt would be interesting at this point to search for any parallel to\nthese intuitive and automatic processes of mind that could be found\nin the history of hypnotic experiment. Unfortunately, however, the\nlast thing hypnotisers ever seem to think of is to encourage the subject\nto follow his own intuitions or exercise his own inventive powers, and\nfrom first to last he is made the slave of external suggestion. The only\ncases at all resembling the intuitive manifestation of the passive\nconsciousness I can recall are those of the famous Madame B., whose\nsecondary self sometimes induced her to take railway journeys, or\nwrite letters; of the patient described in Animal Magmtism,l who,\n1 Page 199.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\fDuplex Per8onality. 95\nin a spontaneous attack of hysteria., commanded his own arm to bleed,\nwhereupon soon afterwards the cutaneous hremorrhage was displayed;\nand of others acting under what is called \"self-suggestion.\"\nThat these were not self-suggestions in the ordinary sense, that is,\nthat they were not suggestions proceeding from the primary or active\nconsciousness, and executed by th~ secondary or passive conscious-\nness, is proved by the fact that as soon as Madame B.'s primary\nconsciousness was aroused she put a stop to proceedings which it\nhad never sanctioned. Thus having embarked in a train under the\nsecondary influence, she left it and returned home as soon as the\nprimary self resumed its sway.\nSo also in the other case the suggestion and its execution both\ntook place while the patient was in the abnormal condition of spon-\ntaneous hysterical trance.\nTo sum up: in contrast to our ordinary experience of voluntary\nintellectual and ratiocinative activity, which progresses by effort and\ngradation, we must recognise the existence in man of a different kind\nof consciousness, which I distinguish as \"passive,\" which operates\nautomatically, instinctively, and sometimes intuitively, and progresses\nper ,altum and without effort. To the latter kind of consciousness\nbelongs what is called Genius, in contrast with Talent, which is\nexhibited by the former.\nI now proceed to consider how far the active and the passive\nconsciousness are distinguishable in the operations of the faculty of\nmemory. An ordinary operation of memory consists-a.s is well known\n-in a chain of associated ideas, each idea leading to the next, and that\nto the one beyond. Thus the mention of Spain in a geography lesson\nprovokes the associated ideas of Madrid and Sherry: the occurrence of\nthe first notes in a tune, or the first words in a poem, provoke the\nassociated idea of those which follow; if we have an appointment to\nkeep at noon, the arrival of noon provokes the associated idea of the\nappointment, and so on. Taking this to be the memory belonging to\nthe active consciousness, I would hazard the conjecture that the passi.,,-e\nconsciousness has also a memory peculiar to itself and fundamentally\ndifferent from the other :-the first memory consisting of successive\nconcatenated impressions, the second of a homogeneous pictorial\nimpression.\nAccording to this view we should expect the secondary memory of\na hypnotised subject to be able to repeat a lesson as well backwards as\nforwards, and this is pretty much what is found to be the case in the\nvery few experiments that have been tried.\nIn November, 1888, Mr. G. A. Smith kindly consented to wake\nsome experiments for me of this nature, and though there was only\nopportunity to try them on one subject, the results as far as they went\nDigitized by Google\n\f96 Duplex Per8onality.\nmay be claimed in support of this view. After a number of experi-\nments in repeating figures forwards and backwards and, adding\nthem up while in the hypnotic sleep, with remarkable results which\nthere is no time now to consider, the memory peculiar to the passive\nconsciousness was further tested with short sentences both during the\nsleep and after wakening.---fI.g., Sentence read to the subject \"all the\nmakers named are good.\" He was then told to write the sentence\nbackwards with the planchette and being awakened he recollected as\nusual nothing about it. He was then set to work with the planchette\nwhile a newspaper was held over it and he was occasionally engaged\nin conversation. When the planchette ceased the following curious\nresult was found to have occurred. When told to write the sentence\nbackwards, the intention was that the words only should be written\nin reverse order, but otherwise in the usual way; the subject had,\nhowever, understood the command to be that he should spell the\nwords backwards and turn the letters the wrong way. In order to\nread the writing, therefore, it was necessary to hold it to a looking-\nglass, and so held it was quite legible. If any person will attempt to\ndo the same in his ordinary condition he will discover the difficulty of\nthe performance, which can only be accomplished, if at aU, for the first\ntime, by picturiDg to his own mind the reversed appearance of the\nletters and words, and this requires a considerable effort; but--a.s I\nsuggest-the pictorial memory of the passive consciousness succeeded in\ndoiDg it without the least hesitation or difficulty. (See also Proceed-\nings, Part XI., pp. 306 and 307, in which \"a subject of Mr. Gurney's\nis reported to have spelt words with a planchette backwards as well as\nforwards.)\nAnother instance of the pictorial or impressional memory is quoted\nby Mr. Myers from Dr. Mesnet (Proceedings, Part XI., p. 235). The\nsubject, a soldier who had received a gunshot wound in the head at\nSedan, leaving extraordinary effects, \"was writing on a sheet of paper\nwhich lay on a pile of about ten similar sheets. We quickly drew the top\nsheet away, and his pen continued to write on the second sheet.\" The\nautomatic nature of the process proves it to have been the work of the\npassive consciousness. \"This process was repeated, and on the fifth sheet\nthere was nothing but his signature at the bottom. Nevertheless, he\nread over and corrected his letter on this blank fifth sheet, scattering\nstops and corrections over the empty page, each of which corresponded\nto mistakes made on the co-ordinate points of the pages which had been\nsnatched away from him.\" He was, therefore, acting upon a pictorial\nmemory of what he had written on the preceding sheets.\nA similar explanation may be suggested of the memory of drowning\npersons who on recovery ha.ve repeatedly declared that they saw the\nwhole of their past lives spread out before them, including every\nDigitized by Google\n\f\u00b7 Dup~ PerlJO'YU1.lity. 9'1\nincident.1 We may suppose that when the active consciousness is\ninhibited by suffocation, the pictorial memory of the passive conscious-\nness is sometimes brought into prominence, by which the past life is\npresented as on a canvas, so as to form one complete and homogeneous\nimpression. It is, however, not only in su~h supreme crises that indica-\ntions of the passive memory are to be found.\nIn counting, for instance, we usually adopt the primary method of\nreckoning each unit separately. It sometimes happens, however, that\nin listening to a clock striking in the night we may forget to count the\nstrokes until several have struck, but are nevertheless able to recover\nthe lost ground by considering them as one impression, conveying the\nidea of the correct number to the mind. This is in fact counting by\ngroups instead of units. I am able to adopt it as far as four, but other\npersons have told me that they can go as far as six or eight. I conceive\nthese groups to be realised by the pictorial memory just as the picture\nof four dots on a screen would be recognised as such by the eye without\nany conscious process of counting.\nBinet (La ViBitm Jfentale) remarks on this subject-a.s the result\nof a long series of elaborate experiments upon the subjects of hysterica.1\na.ruesthesia.: \"Quant ala complexite des operations accomplies par\nla conscience secondaire, nous en avons cet exemple, que si on fait un\nnombre donne d'excitations insensibles, c'est souvent la conscience\nsecondaire qui les compte, et la conscience prima.ire n'en connait que Ie\ntotal.\"\nThe remainder of Mr. Barkworth's paper deals with analogies\nbetween the phenomena of natural and hypnotic sleep and emotional\nstress; emotional and hypnotic a.westhesia.; hypersthenic muscular\nexertion during hypnotic catalepsy, somnambulism or emotional excite-\nment; delusions due to insanity and to hypnotic suggestion, &c. The\napparent submergence of moral discrimination sometimes exhibited in\ndreams and in the hypnotic state is also dwelt upon and inferences\ndrawn from it.\n1 Instances of this are too numerous to quote.

HOME.\nBy WILLIAM CaOOKEB, F.R.S.\nIn the year 1874 t published in a collected form various papers,\ndating from 1870 to 1874, describing inquiries made by myself,\nalone or with other observers, into the phenomena called Spiritual. In a\npaper reprinted from the Quarterly Journal of Science, for Janua.ry,\n1874, I announced my intention of publishing a book, which should\ncontain my numerous printed and unprinted observations.\nBut this projected work has never seen the light. My excuse,-a\nreal excuse, though not a complete justification,-lies in the extreme\npressure of other work on my time and energies. The chemical and\nphysical problems of my professional life have become more and more\nabsorbing; and, on the other hand, few fresh opportunities have\noccurred of prosecuting my researches into\" psychic force.\" I must\nconfess, indeed, that I have been disappointed with the progress of\ninvestigation into this subject during the last fifteen years. I see little\nabatement of the credulity on the one hand and the fraud on the other\nwhich have all along interfered, as I hold, with the recognition of new\ntruth of profound interest.\nThe foundation of the Society for Psychical Research has, however,\nsomewhat altered the situation. We have here a body of inquirers of\nwhom the more prominent, so far as I can judge, are quite sufficiently\ncritical in their handling of any evidence making for extraordinary\nphenomena, while they bring to the task that patience and diligence\nwithout which an investigation of this sort is doomed to failure.\nInvited to contribute to the Society for Psychical Research Proceed-\nings, some of my notes on seances with D. D. Home, I feel I ought not\nto decline. I am not satisfied with these notes; which form, so to\nsay, only a few bricks for an intended edifice it is not now probable\nI shall ever build. But, at least, they are accurate transcripts of facts\nwhich I still hold to be of deep importance to science. Their publica-\ntion wilf, at any rate, show that I have not changed my mind; that\non dispassionate review of statements put forth by me nearly twenty\n,years ago I find nothing to retract or to alter. I have discovered no\nflaw in the experiments then made, or in the reasoning I based upon\nthem.\nI am too well aware there have been many exposures of fraud on\nthe part of mediums; and, that some members of the Society for\nPsychical Research have shown the possibility of fraud under circum-\nDigitized by Google\n\fNotes of Siances with D. D. Hcnne. 99\nstances where Spiritualists had too readily assumed it was not possible.\nI am not surprised at the evidence of fraud. I have myself frequently\ndetected fraud of various kinds, and I have always made it a rule in\nweighing Spiritualistic evidence to assume that fraud may have been\nattempted, and ingeniously attempted, either by seen or unseen agents.\nI was on my guard even in D. D. Home's case, although I am bound\nto say that with him I never detected any trickery or deceit what-\never, nor heard any first-hand evidence of such from other persons.\nAt the same time, I should never demand that anyone should con-\nsider Home, or any other medium, as \"incapable of fraud,\" nor should\nI pin my faith upon any experiment of my own or others which fraud\ncould explain. The evidence for the genuineness of the phenomena\nobtained by Home in my presence seems to me to be strengthened\nrather than weakened by the discussions on conjuring, and the ex-\nposures of fraud which have since taken place. The object of such\ndiscussions is to transform vague possibilities of illusion and deception\ninto fkfinite possibilities; so far as this has yet been done, it has, I\nthink, been made more clear that certam. of Home's phenomena fall\nquite outside the category of marvels producible by sleight of hand\nor prepared apparatus.\nBut I must not be supposed to assert that all, or even most of,\nthe phenomena recorded by me were such as nojuggling could simulate.\nMany incidents,-as slight movements of the table, &c.,-were\nobviously and easily producible by Home's hands or feet. Such move\u00b7\nments, &c., I have recorded,-not as in themselves proving anything\nstrange,-but simply as forming part of a series of phenomena, some\nof which do prove, to my mind, the operation of that \"new force\"\nin whose existence I still firmly believe. Had I described these seanc68\nwith a view to sensational effect, I should have omitted all the non-\nevidential phenomena, and thus have brought the marvels out in\nstronger relief. Such was not my object. In most cases the notes\nwere written-primarily for my own information,-while the phenomena\nwere actually going forward, but on some few occasions they were\ncopied or expanded immediately after the seance from briefer notes\ntaken at the time. They are here reprinted verbatim j and the petty\ndetails which render them tedious to read will supply the reader with\nall the material now available for detecting the imposture, if any,\nwhich my friends and I at the time were unable to discover. I\nMy object in publishing these notes will have been attained if they\nshould aid in inducing competent observers, in this or other countries,\nto repeat similar experiments with accurate care, and in a dispassionate\n1 The note. here published are accounts of eelected Han08ll, but in each -\ntIelected, the full account of the IIhnce is given.\n!I 2 _\nDigitized by Google\n\f100 Notes of Seances with D.

Towards\nend of Bitting (during the fire test) the candle on the table and one on\nthe mantelpiece were put out. The others were alight the whole time.

MI!W.F\nA small sofa table stood about two feet from Miss Douglas and Mr.\nHome in the position shown in diagram. Miss Douglas commenced by\nreading aloud a few extracts from Robert Chambers's introduction to Mr.\nHome's book, Incident. of my Life.\nPMuomeflG.-The table tilted several times in four or five directions at\nan angle of about 25deg., and kept inclined sufficiently long for those who\nwillbed to look under with a candle and examine how the hands of Mr. Home\nand the others present were touching it. Sometimes it stood on two legs,\nand sometimes it was balanced on one. I, wbo had brought a spring\nbalance in my pocket, was now invited'by Mr. Home to try an experiment\nin the alteration of weight.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNotes of Seances with D. D. H~. 101\nAs it would have been inconvenient without disturbing the sitting to\nhave experimented on the total weight of the table, t.he balance was\nhooked under one edge of the table, and the force required to tilt it\nmeasured.\n.lkperiment 1.-\" Be light.\" An upward pull of 21b. required to lift one\nof the feet off the ground, all hands lightly touching the top of the table.\nEzperiment 2.-\"Be heavy.\" As soon as this was said, the table\ncreaked, shuddered, and appeared to settle it.aelf firmly into the lloor. The\neffect was as if the power of a gigantic electro-magnet had been suddenly\nturned on, the table constituting the armature. All hands were, as before,\nvery lightly touching the upper surface of the table with their fingers. A\nforce of 36lb. was now required to raise the foot of the table from the lloor.\nI lifted it up and down four or five times, and the index of the balance kept\npretty constant at 36lb., not varying more than lIb. Whilst this was going\non, each person's hands were noticed. They were touching the table 80\nlightly that their aggregate downward preBlure could not have been many\nounces. Mr. Home once lifted his hands for a moment quite off the tallle.\nHis feet were tucked back under his chair the whole time.\nExperiment 3.-\"Be light.\" Conditions the same as before. An upward\npull of 71b. required to tilt the table.\nEzperimetlt ~-\" Be heavy.\" The same creaking noise as in Experiment 2\nwas again heard. Every person (except Mr. O. R. and myself, who was\nstanding up trying the experiment) put the ends of the fingers under-\nflMth the table top,t.he palma being upwards and the thumbs visible, 80 that,\nif any force were uncollsciously exerted, it should tend to diminish the\nweight. At the same time Mr. O. R. took a csndle and stooped under the\ntable to see that no one was touching the legs of the table with their knees\nor feet. I also stooped down OCCBBionally to verify Mr. O. R.'s statement\nthat all was fair bencsth. Upon applying the spring balance, I saw that\nthe table was pulled up at ~51b. Immediately this was announced I felt\nan increase of weight, and, after a few trials, the pull was increased to 48lb.,\nat which point the index stood steady, the leg of the table being about 3in.\noff the lloor.\nExperi_1t 5.-\" Be hcsvy.\" The conditions were the same as before,\na little more care being taken by the sitters to keep their feet well tucked\nunder their chairs. Hands touching the under side of the table top as before.\nThe index of the balance rose steadily, without the table moving in the\nleast, until it pointed to 461b. At this point the table rose an inch, when\nthe hook of the balance slipped off, and the table returned to its place with\na crasb. The iron hook had bent out sufficiently to prevent it holding the\ntable firmly any longer, 80 the experiments were obliged to be discontinued.\n(After the seallce was over, the normal weight of the table was taken. Its\ntotal weight was 321b. In order to tilt it in the manner described in ~he\nexperiments a pull of Sib. was required. When lifted straight up at three\nequi-distant points, the spring-balance being at one point, a pull of 100b. was\nrequired. The accuracy of the balance could be depended on to about lib.,\nnot more.)\nRaps were heard from different parts of the table and the floor, and the\ntable quivered rapidly several times.\nDigitized by Google\n\f102 Notes of Seances with D. D. Home.\nMr. Home appeared slightly convulsed about the arma and body. Sud-\ndenly he Baid aloud, \"Robert Chambers is hore; I feel him.\" Three loud\nraps wore immediately heard from the IlmaU BOfa table about two feet behind\nMias DouglM, and this table then alowly glided up to within five inches of\nMiasDouglas and Mr. Home. The movement was very st~y and noiaeleas,\nand occupied about five seconds in going the distance of 20 inches. When\nit stopped, Mr. Home drew attention to the fact that both his feet were under\nhis chair and all hands were on the table. He moved a little nearor to\nMr. O. R. and turned his legs and feet as far away from the table as he\ncould, asking the sitters to make themselves quite certain that he could\nnot have produced the movement of the table. While this was being\nnoticed, the small table again moved, this time slowly and a quarter of an\nmch at a time, until it wasagain close to Mr. Home and Mias Douglas.\nA flower in a glaas standing in the centre of the small table was moved,\nbut not taken out of the glaas.\nMr. Home and then Mias Douglas said they felt touched under the\ntable. The sleeve of Mias Douglas's dreas was pulled up and down several\ntimes in full view of all present. Mr. Home Baid he asw a hand doing it.\nNo one else BaW this; but Mias Douglas felt a hand, which, however, was in-\nvisible, put on her wrist immediatelyafter.\n\/ Mr. Home held the accordion under'the table by one hand, letting the\n,\/ keyed end hang downwards. Presently it commenced to BOund, and then\nplayed \"Ye Banks and Braes,\" &c., and other airs, and imitated an echo\nvery beautifully. Whilst it was playing in Mr. Ho~e's hand (his other hand\nbeing quietly on the table) the other gentlemell looked under the table 110\nsee what WI\\B going on. I took particular notice that, when the instru-\nment was playing, Mr. Home held it lightly at the end opposite the keys,\nthat Mr. Home's feet had boots on and were both quiet at some distance\nv from the instrument, and that, although the keyed end was rising and fall-\ning vigorously and the keys moving as the music required, no hand, strings,\nwires, or anything else could bQ seen touching that end.\nMr. O. R. then held the accordion by the plain end, Mr. Home touching\nit at the Bame time. Presently it began to move and then commenced to\nplay. Mr. Home then moved his hand away and the instrument continued\nplaying for a short time in Mr. O. R.'s hand, both of Mr. Home's hands\nbeing then above the table.\n\" Some questions were then asked and answers were given by 'raps and\nnotes on the accordion. The alphabet being called for by five raps, the\nfollowing message WI\\B spelled out :--\" It is a glorious truth. It WI\\B the\nBOlace of my earth life and the triumph over the change called death. Robert\nChambers.\"\nA private me88&ge to Mias Douglas was given in the Bame manner.\nThe table was then tilted several times as before, and once rose com-\npletely off the ground to a height of about three inches.\nMr. Home Bank back in his chair with his eyes closed and remained still\nfor a few minuteR. He then rose up in a trance and made signs for his\neyes to be blindfolded. Thill was done. He walked about the room\nin an undecidod sort of manner, came up to each of the sitters and made\nsome remark to them. He went to the candle on a side table (close to\nDigitized by Google\n\f.Notes of Seances with D. D. Home. 103\nthe large table) and p&88ed bis fingem backwards and forwards through\nthe flame several tunes 80 Blowly that they must have been severely\nburnt under ordinary circu1U8tances. He then held his fingem up,\nsmiled and nodded 8.8 if pleased, took up a fine cambric handkerchief\nbelonging to Miss Douglas, folded it up on his right hand and went to the\nfire. Here he threw off the bandage from his eyes and by means of\nthe tonga lifted a piece of red hot charcoal from the centre and deposited\nit on the folded cambric; bringing it &croBS the room, he told us to\nput out the candle which was on the table, knelt down clOse to Mm.\nW. F. aud spoke to her about it in a low voice. Occasionally he fanned\nthe coal to a white heat with his breath. Coming a little further round\nthe room, he spoke to Mias Douglas saying, \"We shall have to bum \"\nvery small bole in the handkerchief. We have a reaaon for this which\nyou do not see.\" Presently he took the coal back to the fire and handed\nthe handkerchief to Miss Douglas. A small hole about half an inch in\ndiameter W8.8 bumt in the centre, and there were two small points near\nit, but it W8.8 not even singed anywhere else. (I took the handkerchief\naway with me and on teating it in my laboratory, found that it had not\nundergone the slighteat chemical preparation which could have rendered it\nfire-proof. )\nMr. Home again went to the fire, and after stirring the hot coal about\nwith h_is hand, took out a red-hot piece nearly 8.8 big 8.8 an orange, and put-\nting it on his right hand, covered it over with his left hand 80 8.8 to almost\ncompletely enclose it, and then blew into the small furnace thus extemporised\nuntil the lump of charcoal W8.8 nearly White-hot, and then drew my attention\nto the lambent flame which W8.8 flickering over the coal and licking round\nhis fingem; he fell on his knees, looked up ina reverent manner, held up\nthe coal in front and said: \"Is not God good 7 Are not His laws won-\nderful'\"\nGoing again to the fire, he took out another hot coal with his hand and\nholding it up said to me, .. Is not that a beautiful large bit, William 1 We\nwant to bring that to you. Pay no attention at present.\" The coal, how-\never, W8.8 not brought. Mr. Home said: .. The power is going,\" and soon\ncame back to his chair and woke up.\nMr. O. R. left at 11 o'clock. After this, nothing particular took place.\nThe following refers to a somewhat similar incident :-\nE1:tractfrom a lettel' from M,\u00b7. Orooku to Mrs. Hone1J1000d, describing an inci-\ndent at a &ante (m April 28th, atwl incorporated in Mrs. Honeyu:ood\"\nnotes of the seance.\nAt Mr. Home's request, whilst he W8.8 entranced, 1 went with him\nto the fireplace in the back drawing-room. He said, \"We want you to\nnotice particularly what Dan is doin!t.\" Accordingly 1 stood close to the\nfire and stooped down to it when he put his hands in. He very deliberately\npulled the lumps of hot coal off, one at a time, with his right hand and\ntouched one which W8.8 bright red. He then said, \"The power is not strong\non Dan's hand, 8.8 we have been influencing the handkerchief most. It is\nmore difficult to influence an inanimate body like that than living flesh, 80, aa\nthe circumstances were favourable, we thought we would show you that we\nDigitized by Google\n\f104 Notes of Seances with D. D. Home.\ncould prevent a red-hot coal from burning a handkerchief. We will collect\nmore poweron the handkerchief and repeat it before you. Now!\"\nMr. Home then waved the handkerchief about in the air two or three\ntimes, held it up above his head and then folded it up and laid it on his hand\nlike a cushion: putting his other hand into the fire, took out a large lump of\ncinder red\u00b7hot at the lower part and placed the red part on the handkerchief.\nUnder ordinary circumstances it would have been in a blaze. In about half a\nminute, he took it oft' the handkerchief with his hand, saying, \"As the power\nis not strong, if we leave the coal longer it will burn.\" He then put it on\nhis hand and brought it to the table in the front room, where all but myself\nhad remained seated.\n(Signed) WILLLU( CRooKBB.\n(II.)

Lighted with candles the whole of the evening.\nOrder of sitting:-\nMlls.D. M~WI!C\nThe small sofa table, mentioned in the account of the last _nce at this\nhouse, was about two feet behind Miss Douglas. An accordion belonging to\nme was on the table, and a small candlestick and candle.\nPht1lomt1la.-In a few minutes a slight tremor of the table w&8felt. Mr.\nA. R. Wallace W&8 touched. Then Mrs. Orookes felt her knee touched and her.\ndreas pulled. Miss Douglas's dreas W&8 pulled, and I W&8 touched on my\nright knee &8 by a heavy hand firmly placed on it.\nThe table tilted up on two and sometimes on one leg several times, rising\nat the side opposite each person successively, whilst all who wished took the\ncandle and examined underneath to see that no one of the party W&8 doing\nit with the feet. Granting that Mr. Home might have been able, if he so\ndesired, to influence mechanically the movement of the table, it is eVident\nthat he could only have done so in two directions, but here the table moved\nsuccessively in six directions.\nThe table now rose completely oft' the ground several times, whilst the\ngentlemen present took a candle, and kneeling down, deliberately examined\nthe position of Mr. Home's feet and knees, and saw the three feet of the\ntable quite oft'the ground. This was repeated, until each observer expreaaed\nhimself satisfied that the levitation W&8 not produced by mechanical means\non the part of the medium or anyone else present.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNotes of &ances with D.

The letters given out were\ntaken down :-\n\"We igh-\"\nThinking this the commencement of a sentence we tried to get the next\nle~ter, but no response was given.

Is g right 1\" \" Yes. \" \"Is It, right 1\" \" Yes.\"\nAfter thinking for a moment it suddenly occurred to us that the word was\n\" Weigh,\" and that it referred to an experiment I had come prepared to\nrepeat-that of measuring the variation in weight of the table by means of\na spring balance.\nA perfect shower of raps showed that this interpretation was the correct\none.\nI accordingly repeated the experiments which were tried at the last\nsitting at this houae, using a stronger spring balance.\nExperiment 1.-\" Be light.\" The table tilted, when the balance showed\na weight of scarcely half a pound\u2022\n.l?l:periment 2.-\" Be heavy.\" The table now bore a pull of 201b. before\nit tilted up on one side, all hands being placed under the top edge of the\ntable, thumbs visible.\nExperiment 3.-1 now asked if the opposing force could.be so applied as to\noause the table to rise up off the ground quite horizontally when I was pulling.\nImmediately the table rose up completely off the ground, the top keeping\nquite horizontal, and the apring balance showing a pull of 23lb. During\nthis experiment Mr. Home's hands were put on the table, the others being\nunder as at fin.t\u2022\n.Experiment 4.-\" Be heavy.\" All handa beneath the table top. It\nrequired a pull of 43lb. to lift the table from the floor this time.\nE:eperiment 5.-\" Be heavy.\" This time Mr. B. took a lighted candle and\nlooked under the table to assure himself that the additional weight was not\nproduced by anyone's feet or otherwise. Whilst he was there observing I\ntried with the balance aud found that a pull of 27lb. was required to lift the\ntable up. Mr. Home, Mr. A. R. Wallace, and the two ladies had their fingers\nfairly under the top of the table, and Mr. B. said that no one was touching\nthe table beneath to cause the increase of weight.\nWhen these experiments were finished we all sat quietly round the table\nfor a few minutes, when suddenly the small sofa-table came up to within\nabout six inches of Miss Douglas. It glided along with a quick, steady\nmovement. It did not move agaiu after it stopped the first time.\n(Just before I sat down to the seance, remembering that this table had\nmoved up to the circle apparently of its own accord the last time we had a\nseance here, I pushed the table a little away from its usual place, putting it\njust about two feet behind Misa Douglas's chair.\nI took notice then that there was no string or anything elae attached to it.\nAfter I had 80 placed it no one elae went near it, so that its movement on this\noccasion was entirely beyond suspicion.)\nMiss Douglas's chair moved partly round. On attempting to replace it as\n\f106 Notes of Seances with D. D. Home.\nbefore ahe said she could not move it, as it was firmly fixed to the floor. I\nattempted to pull it along, but it resisted all my efforts.\nMr. Home's chair then moved 8everal times, IUld tilted up on two legs,\nwhilst Mr. Home's feet were up in the chair in a semi-kneeling P08ture, and\nhis hand8 before him not touching anything.\nThe table cloth in front of Mr. Home just at the edge of the table was\nbulged outwardsas if a hand were beneath it,and we then saw a movement of\nthe cloth as if fingers were moving under it.\nMr. Home then took the accordion in one hand in his usual manner, and\nheld it beneath the table. At first chords were BOunded, and then a very\nbeautiful piece with bass and treble was played. Each of the gentlemen in\nturn looked at the accordion under the table whilst it was playing.\nMr. A. R. Wallace then asked for\" Home, 8weet Home.\" A few bare\nof this air were immediately BOunded. He looked under the table and said\nhe saw a hand distinctly moving the instrument up and down, and playing\non the keys. Mr. Home had one hand 011 the table and was holding the top\nend of the accordion, whil8t Mr. A. R. Wallace saw this hand at the bottom\nend where the keys were.\n(ill.)

On\ntrying afterwards the normal pull required to tilt it, we found it to be\n141b.\nIt was now proposed to put out the candlesand sit by the light coming .in\nfrom the windows, which was quite suflicientto enable us to see each other,\nand the principal articles of furniture in the room.\nWe presently heard a noise in the back drawing\u00b7room as if a man had got\noffthe couch and was comingto us. Mrs. Wm. Crookeslaid it came up to her,\nand she then felt a pair of large hands on her head, then on her shoulders\nand on her back. Her chair was then moved partly round towards Mrs.\nGregory away from Mr. Home.\nA noiseand crash as of something flilling was now heard behind Mrs.\nWm.

It was uninjured. The table (10) had been moved up close to\nMrs. Wm.

The light was then put out, and the following message was\nspe1t:-\n\" The Four Seasons. Winter first.\"\n\" Spring.-The Birth of the Flowers.\"\n\" Birds in Summer.\"\nThe above messages were given whilst the piece was being played. It\nwould be impoasible to give any idea of the beauty of the music, or its\nexprossive character. During the part typifying summer we had a beautjful\naccompaniment, the chirping and singing of the birds being heard along with\nthe accordion. During autumn, we had ..

Home took the accordion in his right hand, whilat his other hand was\nbeld by Mias Douglas and Mrs. Wm. Crookea. The others present also\njoined handa. The accordion played, and we then saw something white\nmove from the table close to Mias Douglas, pasa behind her and Mr. Home,\nand come into the circle between him and Mrs. Wm. Crookes. It floated about\nfor half a minute, keeping a foot above the table. It touched Mrs. Wm.\nCrookes, then went round near to the others as if floating about with a cir-\ncular movement.

Very loud raps\nwere then heard on the table and in other parts of the room. Movements\nof the table were felt, and then all was quiet. We lighted the candle and\nsaw that the small table which had already moved up to Mias Douglas, had\ntravelled right acroaa the room, a distance of nine feet, and, thumpingagainat\nthe door, had produced the noise we had all heard.\nNothing else took place after this.\n(IV.)

E was 80 arranged that it dipped into water\nin D, but was 2 inches from D all round the circumference, and 51 inches\nfrom the bottom. It was sufficiently firmly supported to prevent any knock-\ning or pushing to which it might be subjected from being communicated to\nthe glaas vessel D and thence to the board and spring balance. I and my\n&llistant had well tested it in this respect beforehand.1\nUnder the table was the wire cage deacrlbed previously,2 and three Groves\ncells were in\u00b7 connection with the surrounding wire.

It had descended to 14tb., showiDg\nan additional tension of (14-5-) 91b.\nAs this result had been obtained when there was BCal'Cely light enough to\nsee the board and index move, I asked for it to be repeated when there was\nmore light. The gas was turned up and we at as before. Presently the\nboard was seen to move up and down (Mr. Home being some distance oft'\nand not touching the table, his hands being held), and the index was aeen to\ndescend to 7Ib., where the register stopped. Thill showed a tension of\n7-5=2Ib.\nJ See seance lV.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNotes of Seances with D. D. Home. 111\nMr. Home now told us to alter our position. We now sat as follows :-\nMI!!WI!IC.

Loud\nraps were heard on the table and then on the mahogany board, and the\nlatter was shaken rather strongly up and down. The following message was\nthengiven :-\n\" We have now done our utmost.\"\nOn going to the spring balance it was seen by the register to have\ndescended to 9lb., showing an increase of tension of (9-5=) 4tb.\nThe apparatus was now removed away from the table, and we returned to\nour old places (see first diagram).\nWe 86t still for a few minutes, when a meaaage came :-\n\" Handa off the table, and all joined.\"\nWe therefore sat as directed.\nJuat in front of Mr. Home and on the table, in about the posit.ion shown\nat A on the first diagram, was a thin wooden lath 23! inches long, Ii inch\nwide, and f inch thick, covered with white paper. It was plainly visible to\nall, and was one foot from the edge of the table.\nPresently the end of this lath, pointing towards Mr. Wr. Crooke&, rose up\nin the air to the height of about 10 inches. The other end then rose up to a\nheight of about five inches, and the lath then floated about for more than a\nminute in this position, suspended in the air, with 110 visible means of sup-\nport. It moved sideways and waved gently up and down, just like a piece\nof wood on the top of small waves of the sea. The lower end then gently\nsank till it touched the table and the other end then followed.\nWhiIat we were all speaking about this wonderful exhibition of force the\nlath began to move again, and rising up as it did at first, it waved about in &\nsomewhat similar manner. The 'startling novelty of this movement having\nnow worn off, we were all enabled to follow ita motions with more accuracy.\nMr. Home was sitting away from the tablo at least three feet from the lath\nall this time; he was apparently quite motionleaa, and his handa were\nDigitized by Google\n\f112 ,Notes of Seances with D.

Any movement by his feet was impossible, as, owing to the large\ncage being under the table, his legs were notable to be put beneath, but were\nvisible to those on each side of him. All the othera had hold of hands. As\nsoon as this was over the following message was given :-\n\" We have to go now j but before going we thank you for your patience.\nMary sends love to aunt, and will play another time.\"\nThe 8ISance then broke up at a quarter to twelve.\n(VI.)

It\nfelt like a strong, quick shudder passing through it.\nMr. Home now took the accordion in the usual manner and held itunder\nthe table. It was presently sounded and notes played. During this time\nMias Bird and Dr. Bird got under the table and BaW the movement. The\ngas was now put out and the spirit lamp lighted. The yellow flame made\neverything look very ghastly and quite took the colour out of Mrs. Wm.\nCrookes's coral ornaments. She took oft' her coral necklace, and laid it on the\ntable cloth, just over the opening in the table by the spirit lamp. In a short\nDigitized by Google\n\fNotes of Seances with D. D.

In a short time we all heard a movement of the accordion\nunder the table, and accordingly Mr. Home placed one hand in Mrs.\nWm. Crookes's hands, the other in Mrs. Wr. Crookes's hands, and placed\nboth his feet beneath my feet. In this manner it was physically impossible\nfor him to have touched the accordion with hands or -feet. The lamp\nalso gave plenty of light to allow all present seeing any movement on\nhis part. The accordion now commenced to Bound, and then played\nseveral notes and bars. Every one present expressed themselves quite\noonvin('.ed that this result could not poBBibly have been effected by Mr.\nHome's agency.\nMr. Wr. Crookes now said that the accordion was brought up to his knees\nand preBBed against them. He put his hand down and took it by the handle.\nIt then played in his hand, Mr. Home's hands and feet being held by oth~rs\nas before. Presently Mr. Wr. Crookes said that the accordion had left his\nhand (which he then put on to the table). We could hear it moving about\nunder the table, and then it presscd up against my knees, and on putting my\nhand down I felt the handle turned into my hand. I held it for a minute\nbut it did not play. I then gave it to Mr. Home, and it then played\nin his right hand a tune which Serjt. Cox had asked for, \"Ye Banks\nand BraeB,\" &C.\nAfter this a very beautiful piece of music was played. It was remarked,\n\"This must be the music of the spheres.\" A message was given:-\n\" This is.\"\nAfter a little time the music stopped and we turned the light lower, but still\n1 Miss Bird writes :-\nI remember the circumstances stated in this seance. I had noticed that the\nnecklace worn by Mrs. Wm. Crookes looked green. I asked her why her beads\nwere green. She assured me they were her oorals, and to convince me the\nnecklace was passed into my hands. Instead of passing the necklace back I simply\nput it opposite me in the middle of the table. Almost as soon as I had placed the\nneck1aoe it 1'086 in a spiral shape. I called out eagerly to my brother, Dr. Bird,\nto look at the extraordinary conduct of the threaded corals, and whilst I was\nendeavouring to get his attention the erect necklaoe quietly Bubeidedin a coil on the\ntable. I have often recalled the incident, and although a sceptic by instinct, this one\nstrange experience has made it impossible for me to doubt the assertions of others\nwhoee judgment is clear and whose uprightness is above suspicion.\nOctober. 1889. ALICB L. BIRD.\nTo this Dr. Bird adds :-\nI recollect my sister calling ont to me, .. Look, look, at the necklace,\" b~at that\nmoment my attention was directed elsewhere, and I did not actually see the pheno-\nmenon in question. GBORGB BIRD.\nAt the moment this oocurred I was writing my notes and only caught sight of the\nneclclaoe as it WaR settling down from ita first movement. It made one or two slight\nmovemente afterwards, and, as I state, it seemed to me as if it had been moved from\nbelow. I mentioned this at the time and was then told by Miss Bird and others that\nthe necklace had behaved as is now described by her. Not having seen it myself I\ndid not alter the statement in my note\u00b7book. W. CBOOJ[II8.\nI\nDigitized by Goo~\n\f,\n114 Notes of Sea'nC68 with D. D.

The music\ncommenced again strongly, and then Mr. Home brought the accordion over\nthe top of the table and held it opposite to Dr. Bird. We then all saw it con-\ntracting and expanding vigorously, and heard it emitting sounds, Mr. Home\npart of this time supporting the instrument on his little finger tip by means\nof a stringI had tied round the handle.\nSerjt. Cox held a flower under the table with the request that it\nmight be taken and given to a lady. It was soon taken from his hand, and\nafter a considerable time, when the circumstance was almost forgotten,\na white object was laid on the edge of the table, between Miss Bird and\nMr. Wr. Crookea, and shE! said her dress was pulled very much. As the\nobject moved about it was seen to be Serjt. Cox's flower. The message\nthen came:-\n\"We gave it you. A flower.\"\nMr. Home then went into a trance, .poke a little to Mrs. Wr. Crookes in\na low tone, and then got up. He walked about the room in an undecided\nsort of way, but finally sat down again, saying it all felt confused, and then\nwoke.\nA message was then given :-\n\" Hands oft'the table.\"\nWeaccordingly removed our hands and joined hands all round. In aminute\na alight movement of my note-book was heard, and I could see that a volume\n(Incidents in my Life), which waa resting on the leaves to keep them down,\nwas gradually sliding over it in jerks about an eigJath of an inch at a time.\nThe motion was visible toall present and the noise was alao plainly heard by\neveryone. Nothing more than this took place, and we soon had the\nmessage:-\nII We find we have no more power.\"\nThe meeting then broke up.\nDuring the latter part of the evening Mra. Wm. Crookes, who was sitting\nnear Mr. Home, felt her hands and arm constantly touched and stroked, and\nthe form of fingers was for some time moving about under the cloth close to\nIter. These were felt by myself and Miss A. Crookes, and our hands were\npatted by them at our request. Mrs. Wm. Crookes also saw a delicate\nfinger and thumb playing about a rose in Mr. Home's coat and plucking the\npetals one at a time and laying lOme on the table by her side and giving\nothers to Mrs. Wr. Crookes. Three times she saw an entire hand rise up\nand pSll quite over her own hands, which were on the table. It was .mall,\nplump, and delicately shaped, ending at the wrist in a cloud.\nAt another time luminous appearances were seen on Mr. Home's head\nand before his face. All present saw 10 much, and Mra.

It then raised itself up at one end and then fell down again.\nNext it lifted up sideways and turned half over. It continued moving about\nill this mannor for several minutes. Mr. Home aaid he saw a hand over the\nlath moving it about. No one else saw the hand.\n\/ The 1I.0wers in the bouquet were moved and rustled about several times.\nA message was then given, the answers being sometimes given by raps\n011 the table and sometimes by the wand rising up and striking the table\nthree times in rapid succession :-\n\"A prayer.\"\nMr. Home took the accordion in the usual manner and we then were\nfavoured with the most beautiful piece of music I ever heard. It was very\nsolemn and was executed perfectly : the ., fingering\" of the notes was\nfiner than anything I could imagine. During this piece, which lasted for\nabout 10 minutes, we heard a man's rich voicel accompanying it in one comer\nof tho room, and a bird whistling and chirping.\nMr. Home then held his hand over the bouquet and shook it (his hand)\nwith a rapid quivering movement.\nI asked if the pencil would be taken and a word written on the paper\nbefore our eyes. The pencil was moved and lifted up two or three times, but\nit fell down again. The lath moved up to the pencil and seemed trying to\nhelp it, but it was of no use.\nA message was given :-\n\" It is impOBBible for matter to pS88 through matter; but we will show\nyou what we can do.\"\nWe waited in silence. Presently Mrs. Wm. Crookes aaid she saw a\nluminous appearance over the bouquet. Mr. Wr. Crookes said he saw the\nsame, and Mr. Home said he saw a hand moving about.\nA piece of ornamental grass about 15 inches long here moved out of the\nbouquet, and was seen to slowly disappear just in front at the position (8) on\nthe plan,as if it were pS88ing through the table.\nImmediately after it had disappeared through the table Mrs; Wm. Crookes\nsaw a hand appear from beneath the table, between her and Mr. Home,\nholding the piece of grass. It brought it up to her shoulder, tapped it against\nher two or three times with a noise audible to all, and then took the graaa\ndown on to the floor, where\"the hand disappeared. Only Mrs. Wm. Crookea\nand Mr. Home saw the hand; but we all saw the movements of the piece of\ngraaa, which were as I have described.\nIt was then told us that the grass had been paaeed through the division in\nthe table. On measuring the diameter of this division I found it to be barely\nith inch, and the piece of graaa was far too thick to enable me to force it\n1 See inoident on p. 122.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\fNote8 of Seances with D.

Yet it passed through the chink very quietly\nand smoothly and did not show the least signs of pressure.\nThe message was then given by notes on the accordion :-\n\"God blessyou.

In order to meet Mr. G. 's objection the short end of\nthe board was firmly supported on a foot (A) in such a manner that no amount\nB\nI\" Q\nof pressure of the hands at (B) produced any appreciable movement of the\nlong end. The adjustments were made and well tested by myself before Mr.\nHome entered the room.\nI took Mr. Home's two hands and placed them myself in the proper\nposition on the board, the tips of his fingers being (at B) just half-way from\nthe extremity to the fulcrum. Mrs. Wm. Orookes, who was sitting next to\nMr. Home, and by the side of the apparatus, watched his hands the whole\ntime, and I also watched him whilst the plate of glasa was moving. Six plates\nwere tried and good results obtained. The experiments were not tried\ndirectly oneafter the other, but when all was ready Mr. Home generally\ntold me when to set the clock going, saying that he felt an influence on the\ninstrument or that he saw a spirit standing near. On one or two occasions\nloud raps were heard on the board, and the signal to set the clock going was\ngiven at my request by three raps. The board sometimes swayed sideways\n88 well as vertically.\nDuring the progress of one of these experiments the chair in which I\nhad been sitting, which was standing near the apparatus, was seen to move\nup close to the table.\nThe register of the index showed a maximum pull of 21b.\nDigitized by Google\n\f118 Note8 of Seances with D.

He then left go and the\naccordion remained there. He then placed hie two handa one on each of my\nahoulders. In this position, no one touching the accordion but myself, and\nevery one noticing what was taking place, the instrument played notes but\nnotune.\nMr. Home then sat down in hie chair, and we were told by rape to open\nthe table about an inch or an inch and a-half.\nMr. T. touched the point of the lath, when rape immediately came on it.\nThe planchette, which was on the table resting on a aheet of peper, now\nmoved a few inchee.\nSounds were heard on the accordion, which was on the floor, not held by\nMr. Home.\nThe comer of the paper next to Mrs. Wm.

D. Home.\nWe had IIC&lCely sat down a minute when raps were heard from di1rerent\nparts of the table j a strong vibration of our chairs and the table was felt,\nand sounds like thumps on the door were heard. A curious metallic tapping\nsound was heard on the iron screw of the table.\nA message :-\" &J.,ftsh,\" in reply to a remark I made.\nA rustling was heard on the table, and one of the glass dower trougha was\nseen to move along by jerks, till it had travelled about two inches and had\ngot a little on to a large sheet of paper. This movement continued whilst all\nwere watching it. Mr. Home's hands were quiet in front of him.\nThe wooden lath was then seen to slide an inch or so backwards and\nforwards.\nMr. Home took the accordion in the usual manner, holding it under the\ntable. It immediately began to sound. Mr. Home then brought it from\nunder the table (he said it appeared to move of its own accord, dragging his\nhand after it), playing all the time, and at last held it hanging down at the\nback of his chair in a v~ry constrained attitude, his feet being under the\ntable and his other hand on the table. In this position the instrument\nplayed chords and separate notes, but not any definite tune. The sounds on\nit became louder and the table began to vibrate j this got stronger and\nstronger until the noise of the accordion playing simple chords was very\ngreat, whilst the table actually jumped up and down keeping accurate time\nwith the musio. This became so violent that it might have been heard all\nover the house. It ceased suddenly and in a minute recommenced.\nMiss Douglas said: \"Dear spirits, how pleased you would have been\nhad you lived to witneas the progreas Spiritualism is now making.\" Imme-\ndiately a message was given in reply :-\n\"We are not dead I\"\nMr. Home brought the accordion back to under the table,when it sounded\nnotes again. There was a sound &It of a man's bass voice1 accompanying it.\nOn mentioning thia, one note, \"No,\" was given, and the musical bar re-\npeated several times slowly, till we found out that it was caused by a peculiar\ndiscord played on a bass note. On finding this out the instrument burst out\nwith its usual jubilant bar.\nMiss Douglas saying that she felt touched, I asked if we might get some\ndirect writing. Two raps were given. I asked Miss Douglas to put the\nmarked sheets of paper and pencil under the table by her feet, and requested\nthat something might be written on it.\nThree raps.\nThe power now seemed to go to the lath j it was lifted up several times\nat alternate ends to a height of several inches and then doated quite above\nthe table.\nThe planchette moved irregularly along the paper, making a mark with\nthe pencil.\nSome of those who were preaent said they saw a luminous hand touching\nthe paper. I saw the paper raised up at the side away from Mr. Home.\nI felt touched strongly on the knee by something feeling like fingers.

I said, \"Is any-\nthing written on it1\"\n\"Yea.\"\n. It being too dark to see what was written, I asked that it might be\ntold me by rape, and on repeating the alphabet I got the following :-\n\" Rctojdourdanie.\"\nOn striking a lighh GIle following was seen neatly written:-\nR. O. toJ. D.\nOur Daniel.\nMiss Douglas said the R. O. was Robert Ohambers, whilst J. D. were the\ninitials of her own name.\nAs the paper was a sheet I had marked and it was free from any writing\nwhen put under the table, whilst no one had moved from the table in the\nmeantime, this was as striking a manifestation as I had ever seen.\nMrs. Home,who for some time past had said a bandwas holding her band,\nnow said that the band was under her dress. Each of us in turn went round\nand felt it. To me it felt very small and I could not distinguish any form\nwhich I could be certain was a band. Mrs. Wm. Orookea, who went next,\nsaid it was at fint very small but it seemed to grow large as she felt it until\nit was exactly like a large band, the knuckles and fingers being very distinct.\nThe band remained with Mrs. Home for half an hour at least. On asking for \/'\nthe name of the band which had held hers, the name\n.. Alexandrine \"\nwas spelt out.\nA BOund like the snapping of fingers was heard. On speaking of this it\nwas repeated at our request in different parte of the room.\nThe wooden lath which was lying just in front of me appeared to move\nslightly, whereupon I leaned forward and watched it intently. It rose up\nabout half an inch, then sank down, and afterwards turned up on one end\ntill it was upright, and then descended on the other side till it touched one\nof Mr. Home's hands. One end remained all the time on the table whilst\nthe other end described a semicircle. The movement was very deliberate.\nThe lath then moved away from Mr. Home's bands and laid itself across the\nplanchette. Both it and the planchette moved slightly. The lath then moved\noff and stood quite upright on the table. It then slowly descended.\nThe aocordion, which had been for BOme time quiet under the table, now\nwas heard to BOund and move about. Presently Miss Douglas felt it come\nto her and push against her knees.\nThe window curtains at the end of the room furthest from the door, and\nseven feet from where Mr. Home was sitting, were seen to move about.\nThey opened in the centre for a space of about a foot, exactly as if a man had\ndivided them with his hands. Mr. Home said he saw a dark form standing\nin front of the window moving the curtains, and Mrs. Wm. Crookes and\nMr. O. Gimingham also said they saw a shadow of a form. The form was\nthen seen to go behind one curtain and move it outwards into the room for\na distance of about 18 inches. This was repeated several times.\nThe wooden lath now rose from the table and rested one end on my\nknuckles, the other end being on the table. It then rose up and tapped DIe\nDigitized by Google\n\f124 Notu of Seances with D. D. Home.\nseveral times. Questions which I put were answered \"Yes\" or\" No,\" in\nthis manner. I said, \"Do you know the Morse alphabet7\" \"Yes.\"\n\" Oould you give me a message by it 7\" \"Yes.\" As soon as this was\nrapped out the lath commenced rapping my knuckles in long and shorttaps,\nin a manner exactly resembling a \" Morse\" message. Myknowledge ofthe\ncode and of reading by sound is not sufficient to enable me to say positively\nthat it was a message; but it BOunded exactly like one; the long and short\ntaps and the pauses were exactly Rimilar, and Mr. O. Gimingham, who has\nhad practice with the Morse code, feels almost certain that it was BO.\nAfterwards at my request the Morse alphabet was given distinctly by taps\non the table. During this time Mrs. Wm. Orookes was standing on the other\nside of the table by Mrs. Home. Her chair between me and Mr. Home\nwas empty and I could see Mr. Home's hands resting quietly on the table\nin front of him.\nMr. Home went into a trance, and addressed several of us in turn.\nThe ~ce ended at about 11.30 p.m.\n(X.)

SIDGWICK, AND MR. G. A. SMITH.\nThe experiments in thought-transference about to be described have\nbeen carried out with four different percipients while in the hypnotic\ntrance, Mr. Smith, who hypnotised them, being the agent. The\nexperiments were usually directed and arranged by Mrs. Sidgwick, who\nalso took the notes which form the basis of the present paper. On two\nor three occasions, however, she was absent and her place was taken\nby Professor Sidgwick, who was also present on most other occasions\nin July and August.\nMost of the experiments were in the transference of numbers of\ntwo digits, Mr. Smith looking at the numbers and the percipient\nguessing them. The number of experiments of this nature tried with\nMr. Smith in the same room as the percipient was 644, of which\n131 were successes; and the number tried with Mr. Smith in another\nroom was 228, of which only 9 were successes. In these numbers an\nexperiment in which two percipients were at work at the same time is\ncounted as two. By a success we mean that both digits are correctly\ngiven, but not necessarily placed in the right order. Of the 131\nsuccesses with Mr. Smith in the same room the digits were reversed in\n14; and of the 9 successes with Mr. Smith in a different room the digits\nwere reversed in 1. We had no numbers above 90 among those we\nused. If the percipients had been aware of this the probability of their\nguessing the right digits in the right order in one trial by pure chance\nwould have been 1 to 81, and the probability of their guessing the right\ndigits in any order half that. But, as\u00b7 at different times they guessed\nall the numbers between 90 and 100,we believe that they were not aware\nthat our series stopped at 90, in which case their chance of being right\nin a single guess was 1 to 90. No one will suppose therefore that 117\ncomplete successes in 664 guesses was the result of chance. Good days\nand bad days alike are included in the numbers given, though, as will\nbe seen in the sequel, on some days no success at all was obtained. It\nwas clear that the power of divining the numbers was exceedingly vari-\nable, but whether the difference was in the agent or the percipient or on\nwhat circumstances it depended we have so far been unable to discover.\nEight persons, at least, besides Mr. Smith, tried to act as agents,\nbut either failed to hypnotise the percipientll, or to transfer any impres-\nDigitized by Google\n\fEaperiments in Thought-Transference. 129\nsion. Nor did others succeed in transferring impressions when the\nhypnotic state had been induced by Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith himself\ndid not succeed except when the percipients were hypnotised.\nWe shall give in full the account, written at the time, of the first\nday's experiments with each of the percipients-not because these\nexperiments are the most conclusive, or were carried out under the best\nconditions, but because they give perhaps more insight than others\ninto the impressions of the percipients, who were more lively and\ninterested in the matter while it was new to them. We do not profess\nto give every remark made; Mrs. Sidgwick had not time to take down\nall that was said, but she believes that she recorded all that was\nimportant.\nThe first subject with whom any success was obtained was a Mr.\nW., a clerk in a shop, aged probably about twenty-one or twenty-\ntwo. Mr. Smith had hypnotised him on three previous occasions,\ntwice in public and once in private, but. had not tried thought-\ntransference experiments with him before. The last occasion on\nwhich he had been hypnotised was on June 13th, 1889, on which\noccasion we had tried experiments of a different kind with him.\nHe is a very sensitive hypnotic subject, but to all appearance\na normal and healthy young man, somewhat athletic. Between June\n13th and July 4th thought-transference was attempted with several\nsubjects in vain. On July 4th Mr. W. came to Mr. Smith's house\nagain, and after some other experiments, it was for the first time\ntried with him. First we tried him in guessing colours, pieces of\ncoloured paper gummed on to cards being used. Mr. W.'s eyes were\napparently closed; Mr. Smith sat in front of him, facing him and\nholding the card up with its back to him. We feel practically certain\nthat Mr. W. could not see the colour normally. After each guess Mr.\nSmith said, U Now we'll do another,\" whether the colour was changed\nor not.\nThe following series was obtained :-\nJlBAL COLOUB.\nOrange\nSame ...\nSame ...\nSame colour, but another shape...\nEmerald Green\nBlaCk...\nRed ...\nBlue ...\nOrange\nBrowD\nliB. w.'s au_a .t.IQ) BBIlABXL\nC'Red.\"\n\"Red.\"\n..

We determined to try numbers. Mr. Smith sat in the same\nposition as before and Mrs. Sidgwick wrote numbers on cards and\nhanded them to him.\nI'IUJIBBB LOOKBD AT.\n7\n4\n3\n... w:.

It was\ninteresting to watch the gesture and look of intelligence with which he\nsaid\" Oh I see it,\" when he realised the number--sometimes almost\ninstantly. Mr. W. promised to return on another day but did not do\nso, and we have had no further opportunity of experimenting with\nhim.l\nAs will be perceived the above experiments were improvised, and\nwe were not provided with suitable numbers. Before the next\nattempt we procured a bag full of numbers belonging to a game of\nLoto, and drew the numbers out of the bag. The bag contained all\nthe double numbers up to 90. The numbers were stamped in raised\nfigures on little round wooden blocks and were coloured red-the sur-\nrounding wood being uncoloured. We give facsimiles as to form of some\nof these blocks, so that our readers may have what means there are of\njudging whether it was the image of the number or the idea of it in\nMr. Smith's mind that was effective. We may remark here that Mr.\nSmith believes himself to have the power of vivid visualisation.\nOn July 5th, Mr. T., a clerk in the telegraph office, came to be\nhypnotised. He is a young man aged about 19, who has been very\nfrequently hypnotised by Mr. Smith, and with whom many of Mr.\nGurney's experiments described in Proceedings, Y01. Y., were tried.\nWe had tried some thought-transference experiments of a different\nkind with him in the winter and spring-Mr. Smith silently willing\nhim to hear or not to hear certain sounds or questions addressed to\n1 He wrote the following poet\u00b7card:-\n..

We think it hardly worth while giving any detail\na.bout them here.\nOn July 5th, after some experiments of another nature, we tried a\nseries of 31 guesses of numbers of two digits drawn from the Loto bag,\nabove described. They were drawn out by Mr. Smith between his finger\nand thumb, which effectually concealed the figures, and placed in a little\nbox, about an inch deep, which he held in his hand with its back to\nT.

We\ngive, therefore, the results of trials with P. and T. in a tabulated form.\nThe following is an explanation of the Tables.-The left hand\ncolumn on each day gives the numbers drawn,l ILnd the right\nhand column the numbers guessed. When No. is printed instead\nof a number it is because the actual number was not noted down.\nA x in the place of a guess means that the percipient had no\nimpression of any kind. The successful trials are printed in thick\ntype, and so are the successful parts of half successes. Cases where\nboth digits were right, but in reversed order, are counted as\nsuccesses. An asterisk affixed to a guess means that it was to some\nextent a second guess (for particulars of these see p. 146). The letter\npreceding the number drawn indicates the relative position of agent\nand percipient, as follows: tJ means agent close to percipient (not\nactually touching) and in front of him. b means agent two or three\nfeet from percipient in front of him. c means any greater distance of\nagent from percipient in front of him. Usually for position' c the\npercipient sat leaning back in an arm-chair on one side of a full-sized\ncard-table, not quite close to it and rather sideways to it, and Mr.\nSmith sat at the other side of the table; but sometimes Mr. Smith\nstood 10 or 12 feet from the percipient. d means that the agent was\nbehind the percipient and ~ear him. e, behind the percipient and some\ndistance off. f, the agent about three feet or more to one side of\npercipient.\nOther experiments besides those with numbers are given in the tables,\nbut not in any numerical statements.\nI On two or three oocasioDll numbers other than the Loto numbers, and not drawn\nat random, were looked at by Mr. Smith, but &8 this made no apparent difference we\nhave Dot thought it desirable to oomplicate the table by indicating them.\nDigitized by Google\n\f142 Experiments in Thought-Transference.\nTABLB I.\nTmALB WITH P.

Thus all P.'s attempts on July 24th\nand 25th, August 20th and 21st, September 22nd and 23rd, 82 in\nnumber, produced only 1 success-just what chance might be expected\nto give j while in 12 trials on August 17th he had 9 SUCceBBeS and 1\nhruf SUCCeBB. Similarly with T. August 19th, 21st, September 20th,\n22nd, October 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th show in the aggregate 83 trials\nwith 1 SUCCeBB j while on August 16th he was succe88fu1 7 times in\n16 trials. We have entirely failed to discover any cause for this\nvariation, nor even whether it depends on the agent or the percipient.\nSuch things as the brilliant success on August 16th and 17th, and the\ntoW failure on August 19th, 20th, and 21st, suggest that the difference\nis not in the percipient j for why should P. and T. vary together'\nDigitized by Google\n\fEaperiments in Thnught-Transference. 151\nBut, on the other hand, they did not always vary together, so that it\nis difficult to attribute the difference entirely to the agent. Thus, on\nSeptember 23rd, when P. and T. were both guessing at the same time,\nT. was quite right 3 times and half right 4 times in 9 guesses; while\nP. failed totally. During these experiments Mr. Smith was sitting 7\nor 8 feet, or perhaps more, from T., and somewhat nearer to P. On this\noccasion T. had come in after we had begun experiments with P., and\nwe hypnotised him partly to get him out of the way and partly in the\nhope that remaining for a while in the hypnotic sleep might render\nhim more susceptible to telepathic impressions. We were much\nsurprised when, without anything being said to him about it, he began\nto guess numbers.*\nA similar difference between P. and T. showed itself on the next\nday, September 24th, but in a still more puzzling way. T. came in as\non the 23rd, was hypnotised, and set in the same position as before.\nP. was failing, and continued to fail, whereas T. had fair success--2\nsuccesses and 3 half S1Jccesses in 8 trials. After the 8 trials we stopped,\nawoke P., had some talk, exchanged the positions of P. and T., and\nre-hypnotised him. Then, for no reason that we could see, P. began to\nsucceed and T. to fail. Later on in the same day P. made his most\nsuccessful set of attempts with Mr. Smith outside the room. During\nthis he and T. sat together on the same sofa leaning against one\nanother, but T. failed completely.\nThis was not by any means the only day on which we had\nexperience of temporary runs of success within the day itself, as the\ntables clearly show. In particular it is remarkable that on October 27th\nand 28th, amid general failure, P. should on each day have had two\ncomplete successes running. The successes on the 27th occurred after\na longish rest (without awakening), but this was not the case on the\n28th. Before the first success on the 28th P. was told that we would\nrest after this one more, which may have had a stimulating effect,but\na similar promise was not efficacious on other occasions. The same\nphenomenon-2 right guesses in succession on an otherwise unsuccessful\nday-was exhibited by T. on July 24th.\nThese three pairs of successes are isolated, not only from other\nsuccesses, but from half successes; but on some of the successful days\nwe find half successes grouped round the successes. Thus on July 6th\nP. not only has one run of 7 successes and another run of 4, but in his\nfirst 17 guesses there are 11 successes and 6 half successes-not a\n\u2022 AI Hr. Smith Wall not talking, and no one else had been put in communication\nwith T., no information could be given to him all to when a fresh number Wall being\nlooked at. It Wall owing to thia that he made two attempts at one of the numbers-46.\nP. wall very long-three minutel!l-in getting any impreuion that time, and T. had\nboth of his impr-wna with a coneiderable interval between them before P. spoke.\nDigitized by Google\n\fsingle complete failure. On July 9th and on July 27th he had nms of\n8 successes and half successes. On July 29th a run of 9, on August 17th\nof 10, on September 21st of 6. Similarly T., on the first day he tried, after\nbeginning with five complete failures, has, in the course of the next 23\ntrials, only two which are not either successes or half successes. On\nJuly 26th, in 10 consecutive trials, there wa.s only one completefailure.\nOn August 16th he began with two failures, and then had 10 successes\nand half successes in succession, a.ll after that failing again. As we\nhave already pointed out, there are, on September 23rd, 7 successes and\nhalf successes in his first 9 trials, and on September 24th there are 5 in\nthe first 6 trials, with no success to speak of afterwards.\nSometimes, a.s the tables show, these runs of success seem to be\nintroduced or stopped by a change of conditions; but this is by no\nmeans uniformly the ca.se. And in this connection we may ca.ll\nattention to two or three sets of attempts where the percipient received\nno impression at all. The most curious of these wa.s on August 20th\nwith P. We began with two attempts while Mr. Smith wa.s outside\nthe room. Up to this date, a.s will be seen in Tables III. and IV., no\nimpression had been produced under these conditions. But what is\nremarkable on this occa.sion is that the 4 succeeding attempts with Mr.\nSmith in the room, and even quite close to P., were absolute blanks.\nIt Wa.s only after being woken and re-hypnotised that P. began to see\nnumbers, though this wa.s scarcely an improvement, a.s they were all\nwrong.\nThe position of Mr. Smith relatively to the percipient, so long a.s\nboth were in the same room, did not seem to us to affect the success of\nthe experiments on the whole, but with Mr. Smith outside the room\nour success wa.s poor, though still, in the ca.se of P., considerably beyond\nwhat might be expected by chance.\nDigitized by Google\n\fExperiments in TMUflht-Tramference. 153\nTABLB IlL\nTRIALS WITH P.

There are, we think, several\npoints about the experiments, taken as a whole, which look hopeful,\nas a discussion of them will perhaps show.\nIt will be noticed that both in the experiments with the curtain\nbetween agent and percipient and in those where Mr. Smith stood\nin the passage, the first attempts resulted in complete blanks-\nthe percipient had no impression at all. Why this should have\nbeen it is hard to say. We always tried to conceal from the\npercipient that Mr. Smith had left the room or that there was\nany change in the conditions. Of course we cannot feel sure that\nDigitized by Google\n\fExperiments in Tlwught-Transference. 157\nwe succeeded in concealing it, but at any rate the percipients never\nalluded to his absence, never seemed conscious of it, and never\nsuggested anything of the kind as a cause of failure. T. several\ntimes remarked that the numbers seemed very far away and so small\nas to be difficult to see, but he did not seem to connect this with\nthe distance of Mr. Smith. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the\nabsence of impression was merely the effect of suggestion-of an idea\nworking itself out in the percipient's mind. It is perhaps more likely\nthat. the idea of difficulty in the agent's mind may have been an obstacle\nto success. However this may have been, it is noteworthy that the very\nfirst tilDe we succeeded in getting any result at all with Mr. Smith in the\npa.ssa.ge (September 24th), we were very fairly successful-P. obtaining 2\ncomplete successes and 3 half successes in 10 trials. On this occasion P.\nand T. sat together on the sofa, near the wall on the side of the room in\nwhich the door was, but not touching the wall. It had been intended\nthat Mr. Smith should stand just on the other side of the wall, so as to\nbe near them, but with the wall between. This plan was, however,\nforgotten. Mr. Myers, who was with Mr. Smith drawing the numbers\nfor him, happened to take up that position, and Mr. Smith stood beyond\n\"he door, so that there was not only the wall with the closed door in it\nbetween him and the percipients, but a distance in a straight line of\nperhaps 8 or 9 feet.\nWe had no further opportunity of experimenting in this room,\nas Mr. Smith, who was temporarily occupying the house, was on\nthe point of moving. The October experiments were carried on in\nan arch on the beach at Brighton. It was divided into two floors-\nthe upper one entirely occupied by a sitting-room, from which a\nstairca.tle, closed by a door at the bottom, led down into a lobby. In\nthis lobby, the door being closed, Mr. Smith stood or sat while trying\nto influence the percipients from a distance, they sitting upstairs. But\nthough he was thus below them, his actual distance from them can not,\nwe think, have been materially greater than on September 24th. It is\npossible, of course, that a feeling of greater separation may have\nproduced a bad effect on the experiments, but it is not necessary to\nsuppose this, since the experiments in different rooms in October only\nshared in t.he general want of success of all the experiments at that\ntime. October 26th was the best'of the October days both for P. and\nT. with Mr. Smith in the room with them, and we observe that\non this day, out of the only 4 trials made when Mr. Smith was down-\nstairs, P. had one success and one half success and T. 3 half successes. It\nis to be regretted that we did not begin experiments in different rooms\nearlier on this day, but the success had not been striking, and we waited\nfor a better vein, which did not come. On the whole, though Miss B.'s\nwant of success is an argument the other way, the result of our\nDigitized by Google\n\f158 - Experim,entJJ in Thought-Tramference.\nexperiments rather suggests that the special difficulty, whatever it may\nhave been, of obtaining good results with the agent in one room and\nthe percipient in another was overcome on September 24th, at least, as\nfar &8 P. was concerned, and that what interfered with success in\nOctober, when by far the larger number of these experiments were tried,\nwas some general difficulty. Unfortunately, it seems not improbable\nthat this general difficulty may simply have been boredom on the part\nof the percipients in the hypnotic state, of which there were several\nsigns, and that in that case we may be dependent on new percipients to\nenable us to pursue the investigation.\nWe have now to discuss the nature of the impression received. It\nwas probably owing to our own suggestion at the beginning that this\nwas almost always visual, though it is possible that the fact that\nMr. Smith's impression was visual may have contributed to this result.\nIt would be interesting to find out whether a new percipient could\nbe similarly made to have auditory impressions. In two or three cases\nT. said that he saw nothing, but that something seemed to tell him\nthat the number was s<Hond-so, but\" something II neyer told him right.\nThe difference between this form of impression and his more ordinary\none is well illustrated by one of the experiments on July 25th. The\nnumber drawn was 66. T. said, \"Something says 37, is it '\" Mr.\nSmith: .. Can't you see that '\" T.: .. No.\" S.: \" Well, I want you\nto tell me what you see.\" T.:\" I can't see anything.\" S.:\" Well,\nlook hard.\" T.: .. Now it's something-6'\" S.: .. Well'\" T.:\" I\ncan't see anything else.\" S.: .. Well, look hard.\" T.: .. Can't see\nanything else.\" (Pause.) S.:\" Can you see anything now'\" T.\n.. I 8fIe a 6; nothing else.\" The number was then put away, and T.\nwas told that he saw only 6 because the number consisted of two sixes.\nT.: .. Oh, that's it, is it; but I ought to have seen two sixes, then, and\nI only saw one.\"\nThis last remark illustrates a characteristic point about the\nimpressions, namely, that they were perfectly definite perceptions,\nnot to be changed by consciously received suggestions or by an\nexercise of the imagination. Another illustration may be given of\nthis. On August 21st P. was told that he was now to see something\nquite different-not a number at all, and Mr. Smith then looked at\nthe word DOG. As after some time he had had no impression whatever,\nMrs. Sidgwick told him it was a word. As this did not help him she\nadded that it was something he was fond of. Still P. had no\nimpression, so she told him to try to see one letter-the first letter of\n~he word. Presently P. said: \"I see an S or an 8-it's gone again ; II\nquite regardless of the fact that a word could not begin with 8.\nIn saying that the impressions were perceptions-not guesses in the\nDigitized by Google\n\fEa:periments in ThO'll{}ht-Tramference. 159\nproper sense of the word-we do not mean that they were always clear ;\nbut when not clear it was, so to speak, clearly perceived that they were\nnot clear. It is somewhat difficult to decide whether the impressions\nought to be called hallucinations because the percipients had their eyes\nclosed, and we have, therefore, no clear conception of what the aggre-\ngate of their visual sensa.tions W8o8 and what relative place in the\naggregate this particular one had. The experiments with open eyes\nwhen the numbers were seen on the sheet of paper, though they\nprove that the impression could be externa1ised 808 a visual hallucina-\ntion, cannot, of course, prove that it had the same characteristics in\n80 different stage of hypnotisation. The question is complicated by\nthe fact that P. was, at times at any rate,-808 his remarks in\nthe Rance of which the full account h8o8 been given show-conscious\nthat he W808 not seeing in an ordinary way, but that his eyes\nwere closed. Nevertheless, the percipients spoke so persistently\nof seeing, seemed so clearly to locate what they saw in 80 particular\npoint in space, and so clearly at times expected others to share the\nimpression, that we caJl hardly doubt that it had to them the\ncharacteristics of 80 8ensa.tion received through the eyes. In the seances\ndescribed at length the reader h8o8 already some of the material for\nforming 80 judgment on this point, and we may quote here 80 few more\nincidents which seem to throw light on it.\nOn July 9th, after the successful guess of 10, Mrs. Sidgwick 808ked\nMr. Smith in writing, which W8o8 our mode of communication with each\not;her about the experiments, to tell P, that he (Mr. Smith) did not\nknow what he would see now, that he did not think it would be\nnumbers, but that P. W808 to tell him whatever it W808. Mrs. Sidgwick\nthen handed to Mr. Smith the letters CAT, taken from 80 spelling\ngame and arranged in the lid of 80 box in such 80 manner 808 to make it\nimpossible for P. to see them had his eyes been open. The experiment;\nW8o8 quite unexpected by Mr. Smith, who had never seen the spelling-\nbox, 808 well 808 to P., Mrs. Sidgwick hoping that the mild surprise\nwould produce some interesting result. P. said excitedly (and we\nthink pointing, though this is not recorded in the note-book): \"There\nit is-there's 80 cat, look.\" S.:\" '\\Vhat do you see'\" P.:\" Why,\nCAT; don't; you see it' Did you think I saw 80 black cat or 80\ntabby' I wish I had; I'm very fond of animals. I mean the letters.\"\nIn this connection we may mention another incident which had nothing\nto do with the present experiments, but ha.s some bearing on the\nquestion under discussion. P., when left to himself in the hypnotic\nstate, usually starts dreams and hallucinations on his own account.\nThese generally relate to the circumstances of his every day life; for\ninstance, he will carry on conversations with 80 brother or companion\nwhom he imagines to be present. Once, when left in this way with\nDigitized by Google\n\f160 Experirnents in Thought-Transference.\nclosed eyes while we were attending to sOmeone else, he began to go\nthrough all the action, with appropriate words, of petting an imaginary\ncat which sat on his knee and climbed about him and over the back of\nhis chair. When Mr. Smith asked him what he had got there he\nseemed indignant at the stupidity of the question because Mr. Smith\nmust be able to see that it was a cat.\nSuch remarks as the following-selected among many-all seem to\nshow a belief on the part of P. that he really saw the numbers :-\nOn July 29th, 48 having been drawn, P. said: \"These two are\nplainer. If you always put them up like that I'll always tell you.\"\nLater on the same day 48 was drawn again. After a pause P. said,\nwith excitement: \"That's that 48 again, just as clear as before.\"\nIn another trial on the same day, when 20 was drawn, P. said:\n\"45; shall I wait to see if they change ~ I see them up in the air\nsideways a bit.\"\nOn August 21st-a day when we had no success at all-I7 was\ndrawn, and P. guessed 83, remarking that they were \"bigger numbers\nto-night. I seem to see them quicker.\"\nLater on the same day he remarked of one of his impressions that\nboth figures seemed half rubbed out. Similar to this was a remark he\nmade on October 30th. The number drawn was 44. P. said: \"2 and\na 0, the 0 plainest, but not very plain. The numbers are getting too\nold, I think.\"\nOn October 29th, in one of the trials with Mr. Smith downstairs,\n59 having been drawn, P. said: \"I can see 5-and a 2, one after the\nother-5 again and 2 underneath it. It was 25 afterwards. There it\nis now. Do you see it, Mrs. Sidgwick 1\"\nIn the next trial the impression persisted after the guess had been\nmade and when we wanted to go on to the next. So Mrs. Sidgwick\nsuggested to P. that he should look away from it. P. said he would,\nthen laughed, saying he had looked away for a moment and then looked\nback, and in that moment the numbers had gone. Similarly on\nOctober 30th, after guessing a number (quite wrong, and also\nunlike T., who had spoken first). P. said: .. I did not know there was\nanother up. I did not look, and there it was in front of me. The five\nwas the clearer of the two.\"\nOn another occasion, October 27th, Mr. Smith being in the same\nroom with him, P. said: \"Would you mind my sitting a little nearer;\nI can't see well.\" He was told that the numbers had been brought\nnearer, which satisfied him, but the guess he made was nevertheless\nwrong.\nT.'s remarks about his impressions were very similar. Thus, on\nJuly 25th, the number drawn being 25, T. saw nothing for some time,\nthen said: .. A sort of 5.\" S.: \" Well. what else 1\" T.:\" 5-8-no,\nDigitized by Google\n\fExperiments in Thought-Tra'I\/JJlerence. 161\nnot 8-it's a bad shaped one-35.\" S.:\" Sure it's a 31\" T.:\" It's\nmade badly.\"\nAgain, on October 27th, the number drawn being 34 and P. having\nguessed 98, T. said: \"8-looks like O-it's a 9-the 0 not quite\nplain-I think it's meant for a 9-one over the other.\" And again in\nthe next trial: \"It's a 9 and a 3-9 at the top. That 9's very bad.\"\nOn September 20th. T. said, in answer to questions, that he saw\nthe numbers right up in the comer~rk on a. light ground-very\nsmall He also complained on this day and at other times of their\nbeing\" such a long way oft' you can scarcely see them.\"\nT. gave quite a dift'erent account of his impressions when guessing\nnumbers with Mr. Myers as agent. He did not then talk of seeing,\nthough he had been told he would either see or hear a number. When\nasked whether he heard or saw it he replied, \"No, I seem to imagine\nit\"; and he said the same when Mr. Leaf was trying thought..\ntransference with him.\nAn interesting point about the impressions of the percipients will\nalready have been noticed by the reader, namely, their frequently\ngradual development, along with which we may consider the\nvarying times which they took to come. Quickness was not specially\nassociated with rightness. On August 16th, T.'s successful attempts\nvaried in the time they took from 15 seconds to 21 minutes, and on\nAugust 17th, P. when successful took from 45 seconds to 31 minutes.\nWe did not always time our experiments, so have no complete record.\nThe longest time recorded was 3 minutes 50 seconds. This was on\nSeptember 21st; the impression, when it came on that occasion, was\nwrong and also fleeting, and the attempts before and after it produced\nno impression at all. A rather remarkable experience on the sameday,\nhowever, suggests that the impression, Aven when right, may take much\nlonger to come and may even be deferred-meaning by that that it may\nbe received by the percipient after the agent has ceased to direct his\nmind to it and when he has begun to try to convey to the percipient a\ntotally different impression. What happened was this. After two\nsuccessive correct guesses by P., the number 19 was drawn. We waited\nfor til minutes, and then, as P. had no impression, gave it up, and drew\nanother number, which turned out to be 43. Twenty-five seconds after\nthe new number was drawn P. said 19. This was recorded and another\nnumber drawn, viz., 75, 13 seconds after which P. said 43. Thus two\nnumbers in succession were rightly given, but one stage late. The\nnumbers had not been named aloud, and P. had a double sheet of paper\nover his head, so that he could not have seen them even if they were\nhandled carelessly after being given up. It makes it less likely that the\noccurrence was due to chance that it happened in a run of successes ;\nthere had been 4 half successes and 2 successes in the 6 previous trials.\n)I\nDigitized by Google\n\f162 E:eperiment8 in Thought-Transference.\nOnce at least-viz., in the experiment of August 1Tth-P. had his\nimpression before Mr. Smith looked at the number. It was wrong, as\nmight be expected, but he stuck to it after Mr. Smith began to look. The\nimpressions often came almost immediately, though we have no shorter\ntime recorded than 13 seconds. One of the quickest was a right guess\nof T.'son October 26th. To stimulate their interest, we had put P. and\nT. lin rapport with one another and told them to try who could see the\nnumbers quickest. Then 21 was drawn, and instantly T. said, \"2 and\na I.\" So instantaneous was it that Mrs. Sidgwick, who did not know\nthe numbers, thought that T. had guessed at random and without\nwaiting for the usual visual impression, in order to be before P. She\ntaxed him with this, but he declared that he had seen it.\nThe gradual development of the figures was of two kinds-either\none figure coming before the other, or the figures forming themselves by\ndegrees. A good instance of the first is afforded by one of T.'s\nsuccessful guesses on August 16th. The number was 32. He said 3.\nProfessor Sidgwick said: \"Do you see only one 1\" T.: \"Yes.\"\nProf. S. : \"Try to see another.\" T.:\" 2.\" Mr. Wingfield, who was\ntaking the time, recorded 30 seconds for the first and 55 seconds for the\nsecond. Again, on July 29th, the number drawn being 30, P. said:\n\" I see 3-1 see one of them now. Mr. Smith, please look at both of\nthem.\" S.:\" All right, I'm looking at both of them.\" P.:\" There's\na 0.\"\nThe following is a case of gradual development of one of the\nfigures. It was on July 27th; the number drawn was 89; P. said:\n\" 9.\" S.:\" Yes 1\" P.:\" 8 in front of it. I thought it was going to\nbe a 0 at first.\"\nButone of T.'s guesses of cards was as marked an instance of gradual\ndevelopment as any, though his impression was not derived from Mr.\nSmith. Mr. Smith was downstairs looking at a 9 of clubs. P., who\nwas not en rapport with T., guessed 5 of clubs. Then T. said: \"Has\nMr. Smith put anything up yet t Oh, yes, yes (meditatively). I see\nit now (then counting), I, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5, yes-a. bla.ck-5 of clubs.\nOh, I see them plain; 5 still.\"\nQuickness and clearness did not necessarily go together; for\ninstance, in one of the trials on October 30th (wrong, but made more\nquickly than his recent attempts) P. said, \"That's quick, isn't it'\"\nAsked whether it was plain, he said, \"Not very, but it came\nsuddenly; the others took some time to form.\"\nNor, again, did clearness and rightness necessarily go together,\nthough we do not remember that P. was ever excited by the vividness\nof an impression except on certain occasions when it was right. T. was\nnever excited at all.\nT., on more than one occasion, began to guess numbers when we had\nDigitized by Google\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 163\nnot intentionally called his attention to the subject; he had, however,\nseen P. doing it before he was himself hypnotised, and this may\nhave suggested itself to him. P., as far as we remember, only once did\nanything of the kind, and that instance was a rather curious one. He\nhad been left in a deep sleep with a paper over his head and at a\nconsiderable distance from Mr. Smith and T., while '\\\\'e were trying the\nexperiments with the latter with his eyes open on October 29th. Mr.\nSmith was looking at the 4 of spades and T. had been describing the\nimaginary knave of diamonds which he saw on the paper in front of\nhim. Suddenly P. said: \"Let's have a game of cardsl -4 of spades.\"\nS.: \"What's that you are saying 7\" P.:\" About a 4 of spades I saw.\nI thought you were putting up cards.\"\nWe now come to the most important question of all, namely, how\nthe impressions, which thus visually presented themselves to the\npercipients, reached their minds.\nBefore discussing the successful attempts at divining the number\non which Mr. Smith was concentrating his attention, it is worth notic-\ning that in certain unsuccessfUl attempts when P. and T. were guessing\ntogether, they influenced each other, or, at any rate, P. influenced T.\nThere were 156 of these joint trials. In 11 cases the order of guessing\nis not noted, in 21, which we may call mixed guesses, the digits were\nnamed singly, and either alternately by the two percipients, or else one\nhaving named a digit, the other named two, and then the first finished.\nIn 38 cases T. completed his statement before P. began; and in 86 P.\nsimilarly guessed first. Now among these 86 cases in which T. did not\nmake his guess until after P. had finished, he guessed the same two\ndigits as P. 16 times,1 in 13 of which the digits were in the same order\nas P.'s. This might not have seemed remarkable if we had previously had\nreason to suppose that T. could always hear P., but, as a matter of fact,\nthey were usually not en rapport with each other-neither apparently\nknew that the other was present, and when assured that he was and\ncommunication attempted, each would get annoyed with the other's\nrudeness in not answering him, however much he raised his voice and\nshouted to him. And the proportion of these imitative guesses was\nrather larger when they were not en rapport than when they were.\n1 One of our devices to stimulate their interest had been to call guB88ing carda a\ngame, the day before.\nI None of these were sUOOllllllfuI guesses. Had they been, the second couId not\nof coursehave been counted. But though P. and T. did not influence each other for good,\nthere is some reason to think that they sometinIes influenced each other for evil-the\nimpression from the oo-percipient overcoming that from Mr. Smith. Thus on one\noccasion (September 24th), when the number drawn was 74, T. said 7, then P. said\n57, upon which T. said 75. Asked to repeat, he said: II I think it was 7,4; I said\n5 but it was more like 4-had a tail to it.\" P. and T. were not en rapport on this\noocaaion.\nII 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f164 Experiments in ThCYUght-Transference.\nT. followed P. when not en rapport with him 63 times,l in 10 of which\nhis guess was the same as Po's, besides 2 where he glwe Po's digits in\nreverse order. So large a proportion as this can scarcely be due to\nchance, and we could strengthen the presumption that it was not, by\nan examination of the mixed guesses and of those in which T. gave\none number the same as Po's, or vice versd. The influence of T. on P.\nwas less marked, but appeared to exist. We must therefore suppose\nthat soundswhichfell unconsciouslyontheear yet produced an impression\non: the mind, of which the percipient became aware solely through its\nreproduction in a visual form-a supposition which is, of course, entirely\nin accordance with observations made by others.\nOne conclusion to be drawn from this is that for evidential purposes\nin psychical research no reliance can be placed on the fact that a\nperson-whether hypnotised or not-is entirely unaware that an\nimpression has reached him through his senses, if by any possibility it\ncould so have reached him. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the\nexperiments dealt with in this paper with anxious care in order to see\nwhether there was any possible channel of sense through which the\nagent's impression could have reached the percipients.\nThE:' eye is, we think, absolutely excluded. There were a sufficient\nnumber of successful experiments with Mr. Smith behind the percipient\nand with the percipient's head covered over, to make it unnecessary to\nconsider the various possibilities of careless handling of the numbers,\nreflection in the cornea, or changing facial expression and gesture.\nThe sense of touch may also, we think, be regarded as excluded.\nThere was never any direct contact between agent and percipient\nexcept in one or two cases where it was purposely tried and did not\nproduce success, and it seems absurd to suppose that vibrations of the\nfloor caused by rhythmical movements of the agent, of which he was him-\nself unconscious and which were invisible to others, can have been\npowerful enough to affect the percipient.\nWe are reduced, then, to the sense of hearing. Here, again, all in-\ndications by leading questions or changes in the tone of voice are ex-\ncluded by the success of the experiments when all who knew the num-\nber were absolutely silent. There seem to be only two ways in which\nthe impression could have reached the percipient through his ears-\neither by means of faint unconscious whispering of the number by Mr.\nSmith in the effort of concentrating his attention on it, or by means\n1 It ought to be stated that in two of these cases Mrs. Sidgwick repeated the\nnumber after P. before T. spoke. She was herself, however, not en rapport with T. in\none of these tw~, and as regards the other, it did not appear from othel' experinlents\nthat T. was easily influenced in his guesses, consciously.\n. 2 Com~~ some of the incidents mentioned in the paper on recent experinlents\n111 crystal VISIOn, Proceeding\" Vol. V.

Both suppositions\nappear to involve hypel'll!llthesia in the percipient, since the supposed\nsounds were unperceived by attentive bystanders, and nothing else\nthat we observed gave us any reason to suppose that the percipientR\nwere hypermstbetic; indeed their apparent unconsciousness of Mr.\nSmith's absence when he was in another room seems to show that they\nwere not. But let us assume. hypermsthesia; let us also assume, what\nwe have no ground for regarding as at all probable, that Mr. Smith\nmay have whispered o.r counted unconsciously after his attention had\nbeen called to the danger of doing so; and let us examine the two\nsuppositions. On either a certain number of failures would almost\ncertainly occur, in which\u00b7 the indications given would be imperfectly\napprehended. .\nOf the two suppositions, unconscious whispering seems the less\nimprobable, because the concentmtion of the mind on a written or\nprinted number with a view to having as intense an impression of it\nas possible, is found to cause a certain tendency to say the number\nmentally, but no tendency to count it. The symbol for a number is in\nthis respect unlike, for instance, a playing card, where a tendency to\ncount the pips often does accompany the effort to concentrate one's\nmind on it. Now any whispering or faint pronouncing of the number\nwould lead, one would think, to numbers whose names have common\nchamcteristic letters being mistaken for each other. Thus we should\nexpect to find fours and fives interchanged because of the f; sixes and\nsevens because of the s; perhaps twos and eights, and ones and nines\nbecause of the t and the n ; and possibly fives and nines becauseof the i.\nThree would stand by itself as quite different from all the others. We\nconfine ourselves to the single digits, because the names of double\nnumbers are pmctically compounded of the names of the two digits of\nwhich they are composed. .\nNow if we examine the guesses we do not find that any of these\nmistakes are prevalent. The following three tables show the numbers\ndrawn, with the corresponding guesses, analysed into single digits :-\nDigitized by Google\n\f166 Experiments in Thought-Transference.\nTABLB V.\nP.'S GUBSSES ALONB ON SUCCESSFUL DAYS, MR.

Table VI. similarly\ngives T.'s guesses on successful days. Table VII. gives all the guesses\nof all the percipients (except one or two where more than two digits\nwere guessed), whether joint or not, when Mr. Smith was either in the\nsame room with them or divided from them only by a curtain. The\nfirst column in each table refers to the numbers drawn, the first\nline to the number guessed. If therefore,for example,we want to see in\nTable V. how many times 5 was guessed as 1, we find 5 in the first column\nand follow the line headed by it till we come under 7 in the first line.\nThe number thus arrived at namely 3, is the number of times 5 was\nguessed by P. as 1 on his successful days. In making these tables we\nhave counted guesses in which both digits were given in reversed\norder, as reversed, so they are not included among the cases of corre-\nspondence between numbers drawn and numbers guessed. After\nallowing for what would probably have happened by chance alone, the\nnumber of guesses with both digits right but reversed is about\n5 per cent. of the number completely right. If, therefore, the same\ntendency to reverse the number occurred in unsuccessful attempts,\nwhen the number was imperfectly apprehended, we must assume that\nabout 5 per cent. of the numbers in the tables are wrong, when judged\nin relation to the origin of the idea in the percipient's mind.\nNow let us consider the effect of counting. This would lead to a\ntendency to guess the numbers immediately above and below the right\none, especially in the larger numbers. Here also we confine ourselves\nto single digits, since the digits, if there is counting at all, must be\ncounted separately. It is absurd to suppose that anyone would count\nup to 12, for example, because he was concentrating his mind on that\nnumbel\u00b7. Turning to the tables we find from Table VII. that eight\nmistakes were made twenty times or more. These were: 1 guessed as\n3 and as 5, 2 guessed as 3, 3 guesssed as 2, 4 guessed as 1 and as 3, 1\nguessed as 2 and 8 guessed as 3. Of these eight, only three could\npossibly be explained by unconscious counting, viz., 3 for 2, 2 for 3,\nand 3 for 4. But of these the two first might equally well be explained\nas results of the kind of imperfect vision of the number so often\ncomplained of by the percipients, and this is also the explanation\nsuggested by the most prevalent mistake of all, namely 8 guessed as 3.\nAnd that this is the true explanation is further suggested by the fact\nthat 3 is very seldom guessed as 8. For though an 8 half rubbed out\nmight resemble a 3, a 3 could not so easily be converted into a badly\nseen 8,whereas with 2 and 3 the possibility of mistake would be recipro-\ncal; an imperfect 2 might be mistaken for a 3 as easily as a 3 for a 2.\nOn the whole, therefore, 'we think that an examination of the facts\naffords no support worth considering for the supposition-in itself as\nDigitized by Goo~\n\f170 Experiment~ in Tlwught-Tmnsje'l'ence.\nwe have said extremely improbabl~f unconscious counting hyper-\nIeSthetically heard. Further the supposition of counting cannot\npossibly explain the successful guessing of CAT and the guessing of\n.BEEF for BEE. If this was the result of unconscious auditory\nindications at all, it must have been of whispering, a supposition, as we\nhave seen, quite unsupported by anything in the guessing of numbers.\nFinally, though our success with the agent in another room was\ncomparatively small, it was, in P.'s case, quite sufficiently beyond the\nprobable amount to afford support to the view that the conditions of\nsuccess, whatever they were, were, at any rate, independent of uncon-\nscious auditory indications.\nBefore leaving the tables we may call attention to the fact that a\ndecided number-habit is exhibited,1 especially by T., which led him to\nguess the higher numbers, 7, 8, and 9, comparatively seldom, and that\nthis seems to have affected successful and unsuccessful guesses alike.\nThe number 9 had of course a smaller chance of being guessed right on\naccount of the absence of numbers above 90. There were scarcely\nenough trials, probably, to reveal any number-habit as regards double\nnumbers, but the guesses extended over the whole range. All numbers\nturned up, all were guessed. Only fourteen were never guessed right.\nThese were 14, 25, 28,33,47, 51, 54, 55,60,62,73,77,85,90. One\nnumber, viz., 24 was guessed right seven times including two of W.'s\nguesses on July 4th. One number, 48, was guessed right five times.\nSix were guessed right four times, viz., 15, 16, 30, 35, 36, 15. Ten\nwere guessed right three times, viz., 20, 29, 32, 31, 39, 42, 58, 71,\n76, 81. The rest were guessed right either once or twice.\n1 It is ~]y neoeeaary to remind our readers that a number-habit affecting the\npercipient only can have no tendency to increase the number of au_ful gueues.\nA diacuuion of this aubject will be found at page 209.\nDigitized by Google\n\f","_id":565}
