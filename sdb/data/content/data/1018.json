To retain\nwhat we are told, we mud receive at once both\nPleafure and Inftru&ion. This neatnefs of Stile,\nwas peculiarly cultivated by the Antients. It\ncame originally from the Eafl, where all Science\nwas taught in Parables and Proverbs. In Greece,\nthey refined upon this, and laid down the Rudi\u00ad\nments of Knowlege in Aphorifms. Amongft the\nRomans, this manner of teaching was much efteem-\ned, and nothing more admired, even in the po-\nliteft Ages, than Sentences.

The firft\ntells us, that L. Clodius Hrmippus lived one hun\u00ad\ndred and fifteen Years, and five Days, by the\nBreath of young Women, which is worthy the\nConfideration of Phyficians and of Pofterity. Ac\u00ad\ncording to the Commentator upon Pliny, the\nName of this Long-liver was not Hermppus, but\nUirpanus, and the Date of his Life one hundred\nand fifty-five Years and five Days, with this addi\u00ad\ntional Circumftance; that he did not live by the\nBreath of young Women, but ofyoung Men. The\nLawyer again reduces the Life to the fame Stan\u00ad\ndard, and contends only, that his Name was Hir\u00ad\npanus, and that he received this extraordinary\nNourifhment from the Breath of Youths.\nIf therefore we take this Infcription as it fiends\nby the Confent of all thefe Writers, it informs us\nof a Fa\u00a3t equally Curious and Important, viz.\nThat\nb Ad Juftiniani Novel, 5.\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 5]\nThat a certain Pcrfon, no Matter whether his\nName was Hermippus, or Hirpanus, reached a very\nadvanced Age, by the Ufe of the Breach of young\nWomen, or of young Men. Now, whether this\nwere a real Fu\u00a3t which adtually happened, or\nwhether it be the Invention of fome malicious W it\namongft the Antients, in order to exercife the\nTalents of Pofterity, I concern not myfelf: It ap\u00ad\npears to me, in the Light of a Phyfical Problem,\nwhich may be exprdjed in very few Words, viz.\nWhether the Breath of young Women may\nprobably contribute to the maintaining long Life,\nand keeping off old Age ? This is what I pro-\npole to examine \u2022, this is to be the Subject of my\nDifcourfe, in which, if what I deliver be Enter\u00ad\ntaining and Ufeful, the Reader need not trouble\nhimfelf much about the Truth or Falfehood of the\nInfcription.\nB u t it will be neceffary, before we come to\nthe ftritff Examination of this Propofition, to\nremove fome previous Difficulties out of the\nWay. In thefirft place, therefore let us enquire,\nwhether the Term of Life be a fixed or moveable\nThing. Some of the mod learned amongft the\nJews, have thought it abfolutely determined by\nthe Decree of God, and have alleged various\nScriptures for the Proof of this. c The moft\nAntient\nc Manaf. ben Ifrael de term, vitae.\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 6 ]\nAntient Philofophers, both in Chaldea and Egypt,\nthought the Life of Man depended upon the Stars,\nand by pretending to predidt its duration, plainly\nfhewed, that they thought it abfolutely under the\nInfluence of the Heavenly Bodiesd. The Stoicks,\nif they meant the Power of the Stars, by what\nthey diled Fate, were alfo of this Opinion; but\nwhatever they meant by Fate, mod evident it is,\nthat diey thought the Life of Man, as well as every\nother Thing, depended thereupon6; and that con-\nfequcntly it was unalterable by any means, within\nthe Compafs of human Power. Now, if there be\nary Truth in thefe Opinions, if there be the lead\nFoundation for any one of them, the Cafe is clear,\nthat all further Enquiries are Vain; for to what\nend fhould we fearch out the mod probable\nMeans of extending Life, when we are certain, that\nthis is a Thing bryond our Capacity? or at lead,\nincertain v\/hether it be or not?\nI n order to open the Way to further Specu\u00ad\nlations upon this cu ions and important Subject,\nI wili begin with the S lution of this Difficulty,\nand take upon me to prove, that contrary to the\nNotions cf thefe Divines and Philofophers, there\nis no fuch Thing, as a f \u00bb\ntied Term of Life by\nthe Law of Nature; or which is the fame thing in\nother Words, by the exprefs Will of Divine Pro\u00ad\nvidence.\nd Diod : Sicul: Hid: lib: i Diogen. Laert. e Plut. de\nplacit. Phiiofoph. Diogen: Laert: Senec.\n\f[ 7 ]\nvidence. In the firft place, I lay it down as an\nabfolute Certainty, that Contingency, is eflential\nto that mode of Rule purfued by the Divine Power,\nin the management of fublunary Things. Caufes\nindeed neceflfarily draw after them their Effie&s;\nbut then I deny, that there is any Chain of necef-\nfary Caufes, and becaufe it would require much\nTime and Space to eftablifh this Doctrine gene\u00ad\nrally, I will keep clofe to my Subject, and content\nmyfelf with proving it, as to this particular Point.\nIt is a thing agreed on all Hands, that the Law\nof Mofes, propounded chiefly Temporal Bleflings,\nand amongfl: thefe, long Life; now this is abfolutely\nincompatible with the Doftrine of a fix\u2019d Term,\nand therefore if there be any Paflfages in the Scrip\u00ad\nture which look this way, we mutt interpret them\nin fome other Senfe, for the part muft accord with\nthe whole, and it is idle to allege a few detach\u2019d\nPaflages againft the Scheme of the whole Book.\nAgain we are told, that God commended Solomon\nfor praying to him for Wifdom, rather than long\nLife, or lor Riches, which plainly thews, that he\nmight as well have afked for either, as for it; but if\nthis Inference ehipleafes, take the exprets D-ciflion\nof God thereppon; who, in the fame Place, fays,\nthat if Solomon, walked in the ways of David his\nFather, he would lengthen his Days f. Add to\nthefe\n\f[ s ]\nthefe Arguments, that it was theconftant Practice\not the belt Men, and fuchas moll intimately knew\nthe Will ol God, to pray in Terms irrecon-\ncileable to iiich an abiolute Decree. Thus Hezekiah\ndefired that his Life might be ipared 8. Elias h and\nJonah, that their\u2019s might be Ihortnedl.\nB u t , to put the matter out of Doubt, one\nneed only confder, the Choice given to David, by\nthe Prophet Nathan k, of War, Peflilence, or\nFamine, in confequence of which, he chofe Pelti-\nlence; now, if there had been a fixed Time of Life,\nhow could this Choice, have poflibly taken Place ?\nAll the Perfons who died of the Peililence, mull,\naccording to the Doftrine I am refuting, have died\nif there had been no Peflilence, becaufe the de\u00ad\ncreed Term of their Lives was expired. On the\nwhole, therefore it is apparent, that a fixt Term\nof Life, is inconfillent with the reafon of Things,\nwhich is what we call the Law of Nature, wherein,\nif I may be allowed the Expreffion, there is a fet\u00ad\ntled Contingency. It is contrary to the Principles\nof Religion, as deducible from the natural Light\nof our Underftandings, and it is dire&ly contrary\nto Revelation, lo that I take it for granted, that\nthe moll pious Man in the World, that will fe-\nrioufly confider thefe Arguments, mull remain\nfatisfied,\ng Ifaiah, xxxviii. 3. h 1. Kings, xix, 4. * Jonah\niv, 3, k 11. Samuel xxiv, 13.\nDigitized by Original from\n. INTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ io 3\nThe ocher Argument I allege, is this-. That\nfince the Authority of the Antients is out of the\nCafe, if there be any modern Stoicks, who are dill\nof this Opinion, they mud fhew us the Grounds\nof it, and this, not from fuch Chimerical Notions\nas are laid down by the pretended Sages in judici\u00ad\nary Adrology, but from the fettled and unques\u00ad\ntioned Principles of true Philofophy. When they\ndo this, or at lead, when they attempt to do it, it\nwill be Time enough to examine how far this new\nSydem of theirs is rational. In the mean Time,\nI will conclude this Point with that fettled and\nmod reafonable Maxim of the Civil Law, That a-\nlout Things which are not, and about Things which\ncannot be made appear, there is the fame Reafon %\nthat is, there can be no reafoning about them,\nthey mud be confidered in the fame Light, fince\nnothing can be more idle, than to difpute about\nthe Confequences of a Thing, before the Thing\nis made manifcd, or we have any real ground for\na Difpute.\nW e have now done fomewhat towards e-\nftablidiing the Foundation of our Do&rine; but\nthere is dill another vulgar Notion in our Way,\nwhich mud be removed ; or to fpeak more pro\u00ad\nperly, explained. By this, I mean the prevail\u00ad\ning Opinion that the Life of Man is limited\nto a certain Term, and becaufe we fee People\ngrow Old at a certain Age, by which I mean, grow\nInfirm\nDigitized by ' Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE \u2018 .THE GETTY RESEARCH\n\f[ \u00ab \u00bb ]\nInfirm and Decripcd; for Oldnefs has not fo\nmuch Reference to Time, as to Condition; and\nI account him Old, who has loft his Strength, ra\u00ad\nther than one who is advanced in Years. But, be-\ncaufe I fay the Maladies that attend old Age, come\non in moft People at a certain Period, they are\nheld to be neceflary; and if there were any Truth\nin this, we fhould be ftop\u2019d again, here would be\na new Barrier through which we fnould be able\nto find no Pafiage, and when we talk\u2019d of re\u00ad\ntarding old Age, People would expedt we fhould\nmake them Young again. It is requifite, there\u00ad\nfore, that this Matter be explained, and fet right,\nand that the Reader be fatisfied how far the in-\ncommodiaes of Old Age are ofNecefilty, and how\nfar the Product of natural Caufes, which may be\naffedted by the Skill and Art of Man.\nT h e human Body is a Machine, actuated by\nan immortal Spirit, and which is more to my\nPurpofe, fabricated by an Almighty Hand. It\ncannot be luppofed, that this Dwelling fhould be\nfo flightly, or fo injudicioufiy contrived, as that\nit fhould wear out in a very fhort Space of Time.\nThis does not feem very agreeable, either to the\nNature of Man, confidered as a rational Creature,\nor with that infinite Skill and Wifdom which is\nevident in the Compofition of the human Frame.\nWhen therefore the Divines fay, that Sin intro\u00ad\nduced Death, they feem to fpeak Philofophically ;\nB 2 and\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 12 ]\nand if I may be allowed to explain their meaning,\nI ffiould be inclined to fay, that Difeafes and\nDeath are not incident to the human Body by the\nWill of God, or which is the fame Thing, by\nthe Law of Nature, but were Superinduced by\nthe Follies and Vices of Men, which carry in\nthem naturally the Seeds of Death; and therefore,\nif it be an Evil, w\nT\ne ought not toaccufe Providence,\nbut our felves. Yet I will readily acknowlege,\nthat taking Things as they now Band, and have\nflood for many Ages pad,' there is no Hope left\nof Immortality in this Body, or even of pro\u00ad\nlonging our Lives to three or five hundred Years;\nbut dill I affirm, that there are no fettled Periods\nin Nature, no inevitable Laws which conjoin\nWeaknefs and Infirmity with a certain Number of\nYears ; but that it is very poffible, nay, and very\npra&icable too, for a Man to extend the length of\nhis Life, much beyond the common Date, and\nthat without feeling the incommodities of Age,\nfor otherwife, this would be rather avoiding Death,\nthan preferving Life.\nTo prove this, I (hall fird make ufe of Rea-\nfon, and next of Experience : I ffiall make it evi\u00ad\ndent by Arguments, that it may be fo, and by\nIndances, that it has been fo-, and then if any\nSceptic has a Mind to doubt the Truth of my\nP'j&rine, I ffiall leave him in his own Road,\n^vhere his Ignorance will infallibly bring upon\nhitB\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 1 3 ]\nhim the juft Punifhment of his Obftinacy, an\nhaftier Extinction of Life than he need othervvife\nhave fuffered.\nA ll wife Men have agreed, that Nature, by\nwhich I mean the Wifdom of God, manifefted in\nthe Order of all Things, aCts uniformly in every\nRefpeCt, and affigns proper Periods to all Things.\nSolomon fays, 'There is a Time to be borny and a\nTime to die m; a fhort Maxim, which may admit\nof a long Commentary. The Life of Man does\nnot certainly confift in Eating and Drinking, in\nWaking or Sleeping, or in the indulging by\nturns the Gratification of his many Appetites ; for\nif this was fo, the ufual Term of Life would cer\u00ad\ntainly be long enough, and there have been actu\u00ad\nally Inftances of People who have been fo fati-\nated with the round of thefe trivial Actions, as to\nbe weary of Life, before Death was at Hand, and\nin Confequence of this wearinefs, have haftned it.\nBut as the Divine Old Man juftly obferves.

I fhall not dwell long on what is\nfaid of the great Age of the Antidiluvian Patriarchs,\nI fhall content myfelf only with a few Obferva-\ntions that are neceflary to my Purpofe, the Truth\nof which cannot be drawn into Difpute. In the\nfirft Place, let it be noted, that though Men lived\nto be then very Old, yet the Species was new. The\nhuman Body had been but lately taken out of the\nEarth by its Creator, and retained therefore a great\ndeal of its primitive Strength. We fay common\u00ad\nly in our Days, that a Man who lives Faff, takes\nPains to deftroy his Conftitution \u2022\n, and on the\nPrinciples of Mofes, we cannot but allow, that\nthe Fabric of Adam's Body muft have been much\nftronger, and better compacted than ours \u2022, and\nthis it was, that preferved him fo long, after he\nhad loft that Tree of Life, or Rule of Living\nwhich was fuited to his primitive State. My fe-\ncond Obfervation is, that thefe Patriarchs lived\nin another World ; I mean a World otherwife\nconftituted than ours, and after another Manner ;\nand therefore, what we are told of their Age, is not\nmore incredible, than a Multitude of Fadts which\nExperience and Evidence oblige us to believe\ntrue.\nITUTE\n\f[ *7 ]\ntrue p.

As to its Difpofition, they fay,\n\u201c its like Youth itfelf, and contains an equal and\n\u201c temperate Complexion; and the Signs of a\n\u201c temperate Complexion in Men, are, when their\n\u201c Colour is made up of White and Red, when\n\u201c the Hair is yellow inclining to Rednefs and\n\u201c Curling. According to Flirty, when the Flefh\n\u201c is moderate, both in Quality and Quantity;\n\u201c when a Man\u2019s Dreams are delightful; his Coun-\n\u201c tenance chearful and pleafant, and when in his\n\u201c Appetite of Eating and Drinking he is mode-\n\u201c rate. This Medicine indeed, is like to fuch a\n\u201c Complexion ; for its of a moderate heat, its\n\u201c Fume is temperate and fwect, and grateful to\n\u201c the Smell; when it departs from this Tern-\n\u201c perature, it departs fo fir from its Virtue and\n\u201c Goodnels. This Medicine doth therefore tem-\n\u201c perately heat, becaufe it is temperately hot; it\n\u201c therefore heals, becaufe it is whole. When it\nu is Sick, it makes a Man Sick.

This Thing is feldom found, and\n6\n6 although fometimes it be found, yet it cannot\n\u201c commodioufly be had of all Men. And inflead\nct of it, the Wife do ufe that Medicine which is\n\u201c in the Bowels of the Earth, complete and pre-\n<\ne pared, and that which fwims in the Sea, and\n\u20184 that which is the fquare Stone of the noble Ani-\n\u201c mal; fo that every Part may be free from die\n\u201c Infection of another. But if that Stone cannot\n\u201c be acquired, let other Elements feperated, df-\ntl vided, and purified be made ufe of.\n\u201c Now when this Thing is like to Youth that\n4\n6 is of temperate Complexion, it hath good Ope-\n\u201c rations; if its Temperature be better, it pro-\n\u201c duceth better Effe&s; fometimes it is even in\nPI 2 \u201c the\nDigitized by \u2022 Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ So I\n\u201c the higheft Degree of its Perfection, and then\n\u201c it operates bell, and then there is that Property\n\u201c whereof we have fpoken of before.

For other\n\u201c Medicines principally Heat and Moiften the\n\u201c Body *\n, and Secondairly, they ftrengthen the\n\u201c native Heat ; but this doth principally ftrength-\ncc en the native Heat, and after that, refrefhes the\nt\u00a3 Body by moiftning and heating it. For it re-\n\u201c duces this heat in old Men, who have it but\n\u201c weakly and deficient, to a certain ftronger and\n\u201c more vehement Power. If a Plaifter be made\n\u201c hereof, and applied to the Stomach, it will help\n\u201c very much, for it will refrefli the Stomach\n\u201c itfelf, and excite an Appetite*, it will very highly\n\u201c recreate an old Man, and change him to a kind\n\u201c of Youth, and will make Complexions by what\nct means foever depraved or corrupted better.\ntc M a n y wife Men have fpoken but little of\n\u201c this Thing, they have indeed laid down another\ntc Thing like it, as Galen in his fifth Book of\ntc fimple Medicines, and Johannes Damafcenus,\n\u201c in his Aphorifms. But it is to be obferved,\nte that Venus doth weaken and demolifii the Power\n\u201c and Virtue of this Thing; and it is very likely\nci that the Son of the Prince, in his fecond Canon\n\u201c of Simple Medicines, fpoke of the Thing,\n\u201c where\nDigitized by 0r|ginBlfrom\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\ft *1 1\n4t where he faith, that there is a certain Medicine\n\u201c concealed by wife Men, lead the incontinent\n\u201c fliould offend their Creator.

Others have believed,\nthat\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 61 ]\nthat our Author intended here to deferibe a kind\nof precious Stone, but fucli muft be abfolutely un\u00ad\nacquainted with his manner of Writing \u2022\n, for he is\nno affefter of Mifteries, in order to ftrike his\nReader with Amazement, or to raife his own Re\u00ad\nputation, both of thefe Things he juftly contemn\u00ad\ned. His Obfcurity proceeds from this, that at\nthe Time he wrote, he was in Priion for writing\nagainft the Philofophy that was then current, and\nhe addrefs\u2019d this Book to Pope Nicholas IV. his\nProfecutor, in order to obtain his Pardon \u2022, but be\u00ad\ning doubtful how far it would operate, he was\nvery cautious in Writing, that he might not\nafford room for a fecond Accufation, of laying\nThings lecret in their Nature open to vulgar Ca\u00ad\npacities. Now, if be was here deferibing a pre\u00ad\ncious Stone, why fhould he talk fo darkly ? This\ncertainly did not require fo much Pains to be ta\u00ad\nken to hide it, and fo far would fuch a dark Ac\u00ad\ncount have been from ferving his Purpofe, that\nit would have been viffbly contrary to his Defign,\nby leaving Room for extraordinary Conjectures,\n\u2022 _\nwhere, without the leaft Danger he might have\nfpoken out. Whereas, if our Interpretation be\nadmitted, there was the utmoft Reafon for all\nthis Caution; his Apology is perfectly reafonable,\nand all the Doubtings and Hefiitations that are\nthrown in, appear fo many modeft Excufes, very\nartfully and very properly placed.\nL et\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 6 3 ]\nL e t us confider this Defcription of Bacon's,\nand compare it with the Picture drawn by the\nHand of a Greater, and ftill more knowing Man,\nand we fhall be apt to think that we hear Solomon\ndefcribing the lovely Shunamite. Look upon Bacon's\nWords again, and imagine the thin Veil to be\nremoved; you will then fee the pcrfeft Figure of\nthis Damfel that was very Fair *\n, you will difqern\nthe Rofe of Sharon, and the Lilly of Domafcus ;\nher Hair like Purple, in curling Locks; her two\nyoung Roes that are Twins, feeding among Lillies;\nher Head filled with the Dew, and her Locks with\nthe Drops of the N ight; her Countenance fair as\nthe Moon, clear as the Sun ; her Fruit fweet to\nthe Tafte, as fhe fets under the Shadow with great\nDelight; her Spikenard and chief Spices, while\nthe South Wind blows upon her Garden, that the\nSpices thereof may blow; her Well of living Wa\u00ad\nters, and Streams of Lebanon; and here the faireft\namong Women is wounded by the Watchmen,\nand then her Beloved departs.\nT h i s Commentary lufficiently explains the\nText, but to put it beyond Doubt, and to apply\nall this effedtually to my Subject, I fhall touch\ngently on two or three remarkable Paflages. In the\nfirfl Place, our Author fays, that this Medicine is\nliken\u2019d to that which goes out of the Mine of the\nnoble Animal, and what can this Mine be, but\nWoman, in whom, as in a Mine, the noble Ani\u00ad\nmal\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 6 4 \\\nmal is formed. Then again, our Author fays,\nthe Infirmity of a brute Animal rarely paflfes into\nMan, but into another Animal of the fame Kind \u2022,\nbut the Infirmity of a Man, paflfes into Man, and\nfo does Health becaufe of Likenefs. Here he lays\nopen a great Secret in Philofophy, viz. That\nthere is a Sympathy in Health, as well as Con\u00ad\ntagion in Difeafe, and that as a Morbid Breath\ninfects, fo a wholefome one may exhilerate. Ta\u00ad\nken in this Senfe, nothing can be eafier, plainer,\nor more rational, nor is there any other Senfe,\nthe Words litterally taken, can bear. The laft\nPaflage I (hall remark is, when he obferves, that\nVenus weakens and diminifhes the Power and Vir\u00ad\ntue of this Remedy. How exa&ly does this agree\nwith the pertinent Reflexion of the Author of the\nBook of Kings, when repeating the Ufes David\nmade of Abijhag *\n, he fays, with a particular Em-\nphafis, but the King knew her not ? A young Vir\u00ad\ngin taken in this Manner, recalls Heat and Life\ninto an old Man ; but if forgetting that this is a\ntemporary and artificial Vigour, he ufes it as if it\nwere a natural One ; he may indeed give Life to\nanother, but it will beat the Expence of his own.\nWhen thefe Exploits are related to us as Marks of\nold Men\u2019s Vigour, we Ihould fet them down as\nMarks of their Folly too; for as Solomon fays, that\nthere is a Time to be born> and a dime to die j\nfo\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTIT\n\f[ \u00ab5 ]\nfo Nature and true Philofophy teaches, that there\nis a Time to beget, and a Time to abftain from be\u00ad\ngetting.\nI will take the Liberty alfo of drawing fome\nAdvantage even from the lecond Objection, fince,\nwith refpedt to Eaftern Princes, though it be true\nthat moft of them die early, yet is it no lefs true,\nthat where they do not die violent Deaths, they\nfrequently live to a great Age ; as for Infiance,\nShah Abbas, and Anrer.gxebe. Now if we confider\nthe immenfe Fatigues of thefe Monarchs, the\nmany Battles they fought; the tedious Marches\nthey made; the variety of Dangers they run\nthrough, and the vafl Expence of Spirits that a\nLife of fuch continued Adlion, fuch intenfe\nThought mull occafion; it will not be eafy to find\nin a Country, where the Art of Phyfic is far from\nbeing fo perfect, as it is even in Europe: I fay it\nwill be hard to find in fuch Places, any Medicine\ncapable of producing fo extraordinary Effedl, if\nwe exclude this of which I am fpeaking. For\nthough I am very doubtful, and therefore lay no\nStrefs on the Wholefomenefs of the Breath of\nW omen; yet, in the Seraglios of fuch Princes,\nthere are always fo many Virgins, and thefe of\nfuch near accefs to the Perfon of the Prince, that\nI cannot but apprehend his Vigour and Health, to\nbe greatly fupported by thefe odoriferous Streams\nI of\nDigitized by\nERNET ARCHIVE\n\f[ ]\nof falutary Air. I cannot help adding what feems\nto be dill a dronger Argument in Favour of\nmy Suppofition, and that is, that the Arab Prin\u00ad\nces fcattered through the Dominions of the Grand\nSignior, who are lefs expofed to foreign Wars,\nor domedic Intrigues, than other oriental Princes,\nactually live beyond the ordinary Age ofMan, and\ndie at lad as every Man ought to die, becaufe their\nBlood can run no longer. At lead, I have a right\nto make ufe of a Circumdance fo probable as this\nis, in iupport of my Opinion, when it is thought\nreafonable to take a Faft, which has only a fuper-.\nficial refemblance to the Cafe I have dated, as a\nfufficient ground for an Objeftion againd the\nPofition I am endeavouring to make good; Pro\u00ad\nbability is certainly nearer a-kirrto Evidence, than\na bare Similitude of Circumfiances, which vanifhes\nupon a drift Examination.\nA f t e r thefe Excurfions, let us return to a\nmore drift Examination of our Subjeft: I have\nalready fhewn how the Breath of Virgins may\noperate upon old Men, when mix\u2019d with the com\u00ad\nmon Air, and fo refpired by them. But let us\nconfider a little, whether thefe numerous and\nfubtile Effluvia may not operate fome other Way\nthan this. All Phyficians agree, fince the Doftrine\nof the Circulation of the Blood has been edablifh-\ned, as well as made known to the World, by the\nSkill\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ <7 ] . : t.\nSkill and Learning of that incomparable Eiv*lijh-\nman Doctor Harvey m; that a great Part of our\nAliments, after entering the Blood, are thrown\nout from thence in fo imperceptible a Manner,\nthat this kind of Evacuation, is very properly ftilcd\ninfenfible Perfpiration. This was firlt carefully\nexamined by Sanftorius> who found that it was far\nmore confiderable alone, than all the other ani\u00ad\nmal Secretions taken together n. If this be fo, and\nthat it is fo, no Man in his Senfes now doubts,\nthen it follows, that there muft be prodigious\nQuantities of the Matter of this infenfible Per\u00ad\nfpiration, mixed in the Air, furrounding the per-\nfpiring Bodies, and confequently this Air, muft be\nimpregnated ftrongly with the Qualities inherent\nto that Matter.\nI f we pufh this Enquiry ftill further, and la\u00ad\nbour to make ourfelves acquainted with the Na\u00ad\nture of the Particles that are thus thrown off, a\nI 2 little\nmOur Author alludes here to the remarkable Felicity of\nDodlor Harvey, who firft found out, and then fully demon-\nftrated the Dodtrine of the Circulation of the Blood, which\nwas at firft as moft new Inventions are, oppofed with great\nHeat and Spleen ; but came at laft to be as generally received\nand admired, as it deferves.

For\nfince infcnfible Perfpiration is owing to the Circu\u00ad\nlation of the Blood, it necefiarily follows, that\nthe Particles thrown off by the Blood, muff par\u00ad\nticipate of the Nature of that Fluid from which\nthey are thrown off. Now we know the Blood of\nyoung People to be foft, oily, and balfamic, as\nwell as we can know any Thing, becaule this ap\u00ad\npears to us from its Effedts, which are a brlfk and\nlively Difpofition \u2022, perfect Health, and quick\nGrowth, to all which, a Blood thus conftituted,\nis abfolutely neceflary.

If this Argu\u00ad\nment be not allowed, it will be hard to aflign any Rational\nCaufe, why one Place Ihould be more Healthy than another ;\nand to underhand this Dottrine perfectly, the Reader ought to\nCQnfult Mr. Boyle\u2019s Treatife of the Wholefomenefs and Un*\nwholefomnefs of the Air,\n\f[ 7\n9\n]\nto guard againft, and to ward off the latter; fo\nby a Parity of Reafon, it fhould feem, that of all\nthe Methods contributing to Health, the former\nought to prove the moft efficacious: That is to\nfay, we think there is no way hitherto laid down\nfor preferving the Vigour of the Body, and there\u00ad\nby fecuring fuch a Supply of animal Spirit^, as\nmay fupport the Dominion of the Soul, in its full\nextent and activity, fo feafible as this; which is\nfuggefled to be the Source of the Longevity, and\nHealthfulnefs of Hermippus. For if infenfible Per-\nfpiration be made through the Pores, fo that there\nis a continual Steam tranfpiring from every Body,\nthen it follows, that where an old Man is con-\nftantly attended by many young Women, his\nBody mud be furrounded with an infinite Quan\u00ad\ntity of the perfpirable Matter flowing from them ;\nand if on the other Hand, he not only perfpircs\nthrough the Pores, but alfo receives by them as\nhas been already demonftrated, the fineft and moft\nSpirituous Particles of other Bodies into his own,\nthen it is very evident, that fuch an old Man mud\nbe, as I obferved before, in fuch a Situation, as\nwill enable him to draw the greateft poffible Bene\u00ad\nfit from this moft comfortable Medicine.\nT he more ftri&ly we confider the Stru&ure of\nthe human Body, and the certain Caufes of Health\nand Sicknefs, the more Reafon we (hall find to be\nfatisfied with, and to acquiefce in the Syftem we\nDigitized by\n| INTERNET ARCHIVE\n' Origirval from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\nhave\n\f[ 8\u00b0 ]\nhave laid down. Reafon and Experience have\nconvinced us, rhat the Body is a Pneumatico-hy-\ndraulic Machi , compofed of Fluids and Solids,\nand that a good Conftitution, or healthy Difpo-\nfition arifes from the proper Motion of the one,\nand a due Circulation of the other. It is alfo, no\nlefs certain, that this Motion, and this Circulation\ndepend reciprocally on each other. For as the Cir\u00ad\nculation is obftru&ed, lefiened, and in lbme meafure\nHopped from the want of a proper Motion of the\nSolids, occafioned by their Lofs of the true Tone\nand Texture which they ought to have \u2022,fo this very\nLofs on the other Hand, ariles from their not re\u00ad\nceiving a timely and fuitable Supply of Nutrition\nfrom the circulating Juices\"\u2019. Hence that drynels,\nfliffnefs, and rigidity of the Fibres, which pro\u00ad\nperly caufes the Difeafe, we call old Age, to pre\u00ad\nvent which, in a natural, rational, and phyfical\nWay, the only proper Method is, to provide a\nconftant, equal, and effectual Supply of fmooth\nBaliamic and Lubricating Particles from the cir\u00ad\nculating Fluids. If this could once be done, it\nis, I think, very apparent, that old Age could no\nmore attack the human Body, than any other Dil-\neafe, againft which, proper Precautions may be\ntaken. But, as it is not to be expeifted that hu\u00ad\nman Wifdom Ihould be able to perfect fuch a Me\u00ad\nthod,\nwBoerhaav. Inftit.

Children while in the Womb, are in a\ngreat Meafure free. This I think is fo extreamly\nclear, and plain, that it is fimply impoflible for a\nMan to be in any Perplexity about it, and therefore\nI fhall proceed to the next Stage of Life, and en\u00ad\nquire into the Method which is therein purfucd\nby Nature.\nIn the State of Infancy, there is likewife an ex\u00ad\ntraordinary Provifion necefiary of this humid Ma\u00ad\nter, not only fufficient for performing the ordinary\nFunctions of animal Life, but alfo to facilitate the\nr\ngrowth of the Child, and this too proceeds from\nthe Mother. Nature has furnilhed her with\nBreads, and with Milk, which is the mod luitable\nNutriment, that under fuch Circumdances, the\nhuman Body can receive; and in extream old Age,\nwhen the Body is a fecond Time reduced to the\nFeeblenefs of Infancy, Milk, and efpecially Wo\u00ad\nmens Milk, is found to be of very great Ufe, and\nin confumptive Cafes alfo, is allowed to be a mod\nadmirable Redorative. Hence I think it plainly\nappears, that the radical Moidure, fo neccflary\nto\nDigitized by Original\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY\n\f[ i o 4 ]\nto fupply the Flame of Life, and to keep it not\nonly alive, but vigorous and clear, is to be fought\nin Woman. I forefee one great Objection that\nmay be made to this, viz. That I infid not on\nthe Breath or Effluvia of Women, but of Virgins.\nYet weigh the Cafes thoroughly, and you will find\nall that I have advanced, very confident. The\nNourifhment of a Child in the Womb, and an In*\nfant at the Bread, is a Nourifhment no way fit\nfor Perfons in Years, and therefore I approve what\nBacon delivers from the Arabian Phyficians, viz.\nThat Milk is an improper Diet for old Men. This\nhinders not its being ufeful when People are quite\nworn out, for that may furnifh Strength to a dy\u00ad\ning Flame, that would not advantage a Lamp in\nits ordinary Situation. Perfons in the lad Stage\nof Life, are frequently emaciated, and in this\nCafe, Milk may help *\n, but dill there is a wide dif\u00ad\nference between the natural and gradual Decay ofthe\nhuman Body, and what the Phyficians call a Con-\nfumption, there mud be confequently a Difference\nin their Cure. Thus from certain and almod felf-\nevident Principles, I have edablifhed the Reafon-\nablenefs of this Propofition, that the Breath and\ninfenfible Perfpiration of Virgins in a young and\nhealthy State, mud be very falutary for old Men,\nand may very probably be a means of prote&ing\nthem from thofe Infirmities, which ulually attend\nan advanced Age. Now, in refpe<ft to this, it\nmatters\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ i \u00b05 ]\nmatters not at all, whether the Infcription I fet\nout with be founded in Truth or not, neither is\nit requifite to believe that I have hit exadtly on the\nMethod ufed by Hermippus. The fmgle Point in\nQueftion is, whether I have fhewn that Senfe in\nwhich I take this Inlcription, to be agreeable, to\nthe Dictates of Reafon, and the Laws of Nature ;\nand as to this, every Reader muft decide for him-\nfelf. Before he does this, there is another Sort\nof Evidence that he ought to hear, and which,\nfor the Sake of Truth I fhall readily produce.\nT h e r e are two Sorts of People whofe Inter-\neft it is particularly to decry this Dodtrine on a\nSuppofition that it is deftrudtive of their own, to\nwhich they are prodigioufly, and perhaps unrea-\nfonably addidted: I mean the Aftrologers and\nHermetic Philofophers. I fhall examine what\nboth may objedt, rather for the Entertainment and\nSatisfaction, than for the Conviction of the wifer\nPart of the World, who are already well enough\napprized of the Credit due to thefe Virtuofi; and\nwhen I have done this, I fhall draw to a fpeedy\nConclufion, from an Alfurance that nothing more\ncan be neceflary to eftablifh the Probability of this\nMethod for prefcrving Health and Life, and for\ndefending our Bodies from the Infirmities of old\nAge as long as their Conftitutions will permit.\nT he modern Patrons of Aftrology, for fuch it\nfeems there are, will probably pretend, that this\nO Notion\nDigitized by Original from 1\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCHI\n\f[ io6 ]\n\u00ab\nNotion of Hermippm was a mere Fancy, and that\nif he really reached to an Age fo advanced, it\nwas not through the Afliftance derived from the\nBreath of Virgins, bat from the happy Pofition\nof the heavenly Bodies at the Time of his Birth.\nIt is, however, lucky for me, that they can never\nmake good this Objection, becaufe I prefume their\nArt will not furnifli them with the means of Con-\nftruCting any Scheme of his Nativity. I know\nthey may plead the Authority of Thomas Aquinas %\nand other great Men who have given into thele\nOpinions. I know too, that they may produce\nfome extraordinary Inftances of the Verification of\nAftrological Predictions; particularly thofe of\nBqfil, who was fo famous at Florence, and of La\nBrcjfe, at Paris, who were particularly happy in\nguefling at future Events, and in having their\n. Predictions recorded by Hiltorians of Credit.\nT h e former of thele foretold to Coftno de Me\u00ad\ndici, then a private Citizen at Florence, that he\nwould attain fome very high Dignity, in as much\nas the Afcendant of his Nativity was adorned with\n\u2022\nthe fame propitious AfpeCts, as thofe of the Em\u00ad\nperors Augujlus, and Charles V. had been; and he\nwas accordingly raifed to the Dukedom of Tufcany,\nin\ns One ftrong Pafiage among many in his Writings, runs\nthus.

If the Affrologers are content\nto grant me this, I am willing to compromife the\nMatter, and which, I think is as much as they can\nexpedt, to allow this Dodtrine to be derived from\nthe Stars. But, if they are fo tenacious of their\nown Notions, as not to accept of fo fair an Offer,\nI fhall rccurr to my firft Principles, and deny\n.abfolutely the Certainty of their Art, and demand\nas good Reafons for the Credit of Aftrology, as I\nhave produced in favour of my own Syffem, be\u00ad\nfore I enter the Lifts with them. Affirmation is\nnothing in this Age, wherein Men expedt Proofs\nfor every Thing. Let them ffiew us then, that\nthey can predidt an Earthquake, Whirlwind, or\nfo much as an Irruption of Mount Etna nay, let\nthem but mark the Rainy, and fair Days for a\nwhole Year in any Climate in Europe, and I will\nbe content, that their Affertions weigh down my\nEvidence, and that the long Life of Hermippus\nIhall be afcribed to a happy Conjundtion of humid\nStars, in the Sign Virgo, which was the Interpre\u00ad\ntation once offered me by a learned Aftrologer of\nthis Inlcription, and which, together with my\nowh Sentiments, I freely lubmit to the Judgment\nof the Impartial Reader.\nSuch as feek after Truth, difguife nothing, and\nare fo far from being afraid of feeing their Opinion\ncanvaffed, and even refuted, that on the contrary,\nnothing pleafes them better, becaufe they are ftill\ngainers\nDigitized by \" Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ III ]\ngainers by the Difpute *\n, fince, when Truth is once\ndifcovcred, they have as much right to it, as he\nwho found it. In the prefent Cafe, if this Trea\u00ad\ndle of mine fhould dir up any wifer Man to look\nfor a better Solution of the Problem I have dated,\nand he fhould luckily fall on the genuine Method\nof Hermippus, he could not rejoice at it more than\nI, nor would he find any one more willing to\nown, or to applaud his Ingenuity. Let us read,\nlet us meditate, let us difpute, but all for the fake\nof Truth, which is the great Property of Man\u00ad\nkind, conditutes all our Happinefs, and which it is\ntherefore our common Intereft to purfue. The\nPoint I have now in view, is todifcover the means\nof prolonging Life, without feeling the Infirmities\nof Age \u2022\n, to the Difcovery of which, if the Pub\u00ad\nlication of this Treatife any way contribute, not\nmy end only, but the end of Mankind is anf-\nwered, and a mod noble Point of Science will\nbe illufirated, from what many might at fird\ntdeem an idle Difpute.\nI fhall not treat the Hermetic Philofophers al\u00ad\ntogether fo brifkly as I have done the Adrologers *\n,\nbecaufe, without doubt, there have been amongd\nthem, many very excellent Perfons. I cannot take\nupon me to fay, when they began to lay claim to\nthe Univerfal Medicine, by which they pretend to\npreferve Life for many Centuries, at lead, of which\nthey fay Artephius was an Indance, who lived by the\nUfe\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\n\ft \u00ab 3 l\nUle of it, to the Age of 300, or as fome fay, neat\n1000. This is certain, that the Society of the Ro'\nficrucians openly claimed it as one of the Privileges\nof their illuftrious Body. Peter Mormius, who for\nought I know, was one of the laft of them that ap-\n. peared in Public, reduced their high Pretenfions,\nwhich at firft were very extenfive, to the Polfefliori\nof three Secrets. Of thefe, the firft was the Per\u00ad\npetual Motion ; the fecond, the Art of tranfmu-\nting Metals *\n, and the third, the Univerfal Medi\u00ad\ncine. In the Book publifhed by this Mormius,\nthere are abundance of curious Things, though he\ndoes not fufficiently explain himfelf, efpecially up\u00ad\non the laft Subjectu. It is, however, well enough\nknown, that thefe Illuminati afierted, that they\nhad a Power of prolonging their Lives for many\nAges, nor is it very clear from their Writings,\nwhether, what they are pleafed to call the Philofo-\npher\u2019s Stone, be not at once the great Secret of\nTranfmutation, and of the Univerfal Medicine.\nT h e cleareft Account of this Matter that I\nhave ever met with, is in the Anfwer of a French\nP Adept,\nuThis Mormius went into Holland in the Year 1630, were\nhe demanded an Audience of the States-Genera), in order to\ntender them certain Propufitions from the Fraternity of Rofi-\ncrufians, which they refufed to hear; this did not, however,\nhinder Mormius from publi(hing a Treatife under the follow\u00ad\ning Title, which is now become a fcarce and valuable Book.\nArcana totius naturae Secretiflima, nec ha&enus unquam de-\ntefta, a Collegio Rofiano in Lucem produntur, Opera Petri\nMormii, in 24 Lugduni Batavorum, 1630.\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 114 ]\nAdept, to Doctor Edmund, Dickenfon, Phyfician to\nKing Charles II. and a profeft Admirer of the\nHermetic Philofophy.

There is a\nthird Edition of it printed in Germany, in 1721. The Au\u00ad\nthor was one of thofe very great Men, whofe Merits are better\nknown abroad than at home ; he is mentioned by the learned\nOlaus Borrichius, and many other foreign Writers, with much\nRefpeft, and juit Teflimonies of Efteem for his extenfive\nKnowlege.\n- Original from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ \u201d 5 ]\n\u00a3o, at Tome Relations well attefted, that feem to\nfavour the Truth of it.\nT h e r e happened in the Year 1687, an odd\nAccident at Venice, that made very much ftir then,\nand which I think deferves to be fecured from\nOblivion. The great Freedom and eafe with\nwhich all Perfons, who make a good Appearance,\nlive in that City, is known fufficiently to all who\nare acquainted with it; they will not therefore be\nfurprized, that a Stranger, who went by the Name\nof Signor Gualdi, and v\/hj made a confiderable Fi\u00ad\ngure there, was admitted into the bell Company,\nthough no body knew who, or what he was. He\nremained at Venice fome Months, and three Things\nwere remarked in his Conduct. The firft was,\nthat he had a fmall Collection of fine Pictures,\nwhich he readily Ihewed to any Body that defired\ni t ; the next, that he was perfectly verfed in all\nArts and Sciences, and fpoke on all Subjects with\nfuch Readinefs and Sagacity, as aftonifhed all who\nheard him ; and it was in the third Place obferved,\nthat he never wrote or received any Letters; never\ndefired any Credit, or made ufe of Bills of Ex\u00ad\nchange, but paid for every Thing in ready Mo\u00ad\nney, and lived decently, though not in Splendor.\nThis Gentleman met one Day at the Coffee-Houfe\nwith a Venetian Nobleman, who was an extraor\u00ad\ndinary good judge of Pictures: He had heard of\nSignor Gualdi's Collection, and in a very polite\nP 2 Manner\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ *\n>\n<\nS ]\n. Manner defired to fee them, to which the other\nvery readily confented. After the Venetian had\nviewed Signor Gualdi's Collection, and exprefled\nhis Satisfaction, by telling him, that he had never\nfeen a finer, confidering the Number of Pieces of\nwhich it confided; he cad his Eye by chance over\nthe Chamber Door, where hung a Picture of this\nStranger. The Venetian look\u2019d upon it, and then\nupon him. This Picture was drawn for you, Sir,\nfays he to Signor Gualdi, to which the other made\nno Anfwer, but by a low bow. You look, con\u00ad\ntinued the Venetian, like a Man of Fifty, and yet\nI know this Picture to be of the Hand of Titian,\nwho has been dead one hundred and thirty Years,\nhow is this poflible ? It is not eafy, faid Signor\nGualdi, gravely, to know all Things that are\npoffible \u2022, but there is certainly no Crime in my\nbeing like a Picture drawn by Titian. The Ve\u00ad\nnetian eafily perceived by his manner of fpeaking,\nthat he had given the Stranger Offence, and there\u00ad\nfore took his leave. He could not forbear fpeaking\nof this in the Evening to fome of his Friends, who\nrefolved to fatisfy themfelves by looking upon the\nPicture the next Day. In order to have an Op\u00ad\nportunity of doing fo, they went to the Coffee-\nHoufe about the Time that Signor Gualdi was wont\nto come thither, and not meeting with him; one\npf them who had often converfed with him, went\ntO his Lodgings to enquire after him, where he\nh^rd,\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE \u201c THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ l l 7 ]\nheard, that he fet out an Hour before for Vienna,\nThis Affair made a great Noife, and found a Place\nin all the News-Papers of that Time *\nT h is Story agrees very well with what is faid\nby Doctor Dickenfon*sCorrelpondent, who obferves,\nthat the Adepts are obliged to conceal themfelves\nFor the fake of Safety, and that having a Power\nnot only of prolonging their Lives, but alfo of\nrenovating themfelves, they take Care to ufe it\nwith the utmoft Difcretion, and inflead of making\na Difplay of this wonderful Prerogative, they\nmanage it with the utmoft Secrecy, which he lays\ndown as the true Caufe of the World\u2019s being in\nfo much Doubt about the Matter. Hence it comes\nto pafs, that though an Adept is poffelfed of great\u00ad\ner Wealth than is contained in the Mines of Peru.\n,\nyet he always lives in fo moderate a Manner, as\nto avoid all Sufpicion, and fo as never to be dis\u00ad\ncovered, unlefs by fome unforefeen Accident, like\nthat which happened to a famous Englifo Artift,\nwho difguifed himfelf under the Name of Eugenius\nPhilalethes, and whofe true Name is laid to be\nThomas Vaughan, the cleareft and moft candid\nWriter of all the Hermetic Philofophersy. He tells\nus\nx Memoires Hiftoriques, 1687, Tom i. p. 365.\ny The moft famous of his Pieces is intitled, Introitus Aper-\ntu s ad Occlufum Regis Palatium, This was written originally\nin Englifh, has been tranflated into almoft all the European\nlanguages, and is unqueftionabiy the beft and cleareft Rook\nupon the Subject that is extant in any Tongue.\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\ft n 8 ]\nus of himfelf, that going to a Goldfaith, in or\u00ad\nder to fell twelve hundred Marks of fine Silver,\nthe Man told him at firft Sight, that it never\ncame out of the Mines, but was the Produdt of\nArt, as not being of the Standard of any Nation\nwhatever ; which furprized Philalethes fo much,\nthat he withdrew immediately, and left the Gold-\nfaith in Poflfeffion of hisTreafure. This famous\nMan, who certainly was an Adept, if ever there\nwas one, led a wandering kind of Life, and fell\noften into great Dangers, merely from his poffefling\nthis great Secret. He was born, as we learn from\nhis Writings, about the Year 1612, and what is\nthe ftrangeft part of his Hiftory, he is believed\nby thofe of his Fraternity, to be yet living, and\na Perfon of great Credit at Nurenberg, affirms, that\nhe converfed with him but a few Years ago. Nay,\nit is further afferted by all the Lovers of Hermetic\nPhilofophy, that this very Philalethes, is the Pre-\nfident of the Illuminated in Europe, and that he\nconftantly fits as fuch in all their Annual Meetings.\nIt is on the one hand true, that there is fomething\nwild and incredible in thefe Relations, and yet it\nis as certain on the other, that feveral who atteft\nthem, are Perfons of irreproachable Character,\nand even with Refpedt to this Philalethes, he was,\naccording to the Report of the great Boyle, and\nothers who knew him, a Man of remarkable Piety,\nand of unftained Morals. In the Englijh Planta\u00ad\ntions,\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ \u201d 9 ]\ntions, he became acquainted with one Starkey, a\nChymift, before whom he made Projection, but\nfinding that Starkey was a vicious and extravagant\nMan, he broke off his Acquaintance with him,\nwithout communicating any part of his Secrets2.\nBut it may be faid by liich as look upon this\nwhole Affair, as an idle and rediculous Thing,\nand who confider all thefe Relations, however\nattefted, or fupported, as mere Dreams, orVifions.\nI fay it may be alleged by thefe angry Critics,\nthat it is a direct Proof of the Fahhood of their\nPretentions to long Life ; that we have diftindt\nAccounts of the Time when their molt celebrated\nPatriarchs, fuch as Roger Bacon, Raymond Lully,\nand Bafil Valentine died, and were buried. If there\u00ad\nfore, thefe Men could not preferve their own Lives,\nor even protraft them beyond the ordinary Extent,\nwhat probability is there, will thefe People lay,\nthat any of the Fraternity fhould prolong their\nLives in the Manner they relate ? In Anfwer to\nthis, the Adepts always infinuate, that if thefe\ngreat Men died, it was by their own Choice, and\nthat many of their Fraternity ftill decline that\nlength\n2 This George Starkey, was originally an Apothecary, had\na Head turned to Chemiftry, but managed his Affairs fo ill,\nthat he was obliged to Tranfport himfelf to ih Plantations,\nwhere ne became acquainted with Philalethes, of u.iich \\c-\nquamta ce he boafts much in his Writing'.

This I muft confefs, is an unfatisfaCtory\nAnfwer, efpecially to fuch as make the Objection,\nbut then, fay the Adepts, it is the only Anfwer\nthat becomes us to give *\n, we do not aim at the\nConviction of thefe Sort of People, we are not de-\nfirous of making a Noife in the World, we do\nnot even regard the poffefiion of Riches, and long\nLife as blefiings in themfelves; further than that,\nthey enable us to do good, and the foie Reafon of\nour ever mentioning fuch Secrets, being in our\npoffefiion, is in Order to lead to our Society fuch\nworthy Perfons as deferve to be affociated. Now,\nhowever Weak, however Sophiftical, this Rea-\nfoning may appear to the generality of Mankind,\nyet upon the Principles of the Hermetic Philofo-\nphy, it muft be allowed to be extreamly Plaufible,\nand in all fuch Cafes, we muft admit Men to\nargue from their own Principles, and not from\nthofe we lay down.\nAs I do not profels myfelf either an Adept, or\nlb much as a ftudent in this Sort of Philofophy,\nI lhall take the Liberty, as the matter of FaCt\nnearly concerns the SubjeCt of which I am treat\u00ad\ning, to Ihape out another Anfwer to this Objection,\nand it is this, that perhaps we are not always fo\nfecure as to the Deaths of thefe Virtuofi, as we\nimagine. The continuance of their Lives is a\nThing, that though they boaft of in one Senfe,\nyet\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTF JTE\n\fyet in another they ftudioufly affeCt to conceal.\nOf this, I (hall give an extraordinary Inftance,\nwhich will be fo much the more entertaining to\nthe Reader, as for any thing I know; it has not\nyet been taken Notice of by any Writer upon this\nSubject, not even by the profcfled Hiftorian of this\nFraternity, notwithftanding he has made larger\nCollections concerning them, and their Philofo-\nphy, than any Man that ever let Pen to Paper.\nThis Inftance will be alfo found the more ex\u00ad\ntraordinary, fince I take it from one who never\npretended to be an Adept, and who, therefore,\nought to be confidered as an unprejudiced Witnels.\nBut before I enter upon this Story, I muft defire\nmy Readers to obferve, that I lay down barely\nFaCts as I find them, and do not pretend to m-\ntereft myfell in the leaft, as to the credit they may\nmeet with.\nA m o n g s t the Hermetic Philofophers, who\nare allowed to have attained the higheft Secrets of\nScience, Nicholas Flamel of Paris, has been al\u00ad\nways reckoned one of the moft confiderable, and\nhis right to this Reputation, the leaft to be con-\ntefted. The Hiftoryof this Flamel, whoflournn-\ned in the XIV. Century is very curious: He was\na Perfonof a good Family, though much reduced\nin point ofFortune ; had quick Parts a lively Wir,\nand with the advantage of no more than an ordi\u00ad\nnary Education ; was lent to Paris to get a living\nas\nDigitized by \u2022 Originalfrom\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ 122 ]\nas he could.

After much Search to little\npurnofe, he met at laif with a Jew Phyfician at\nLeon, who had been lately converted to the Cril-\ntian Religion, and who was well verfed in this\nkind of Science; this Man, at the Perfuafion of\nFlamel, confented to go with him to Paris; but\nwhen they were got as far as Orleans, the Phyfi\u00ad\ncian who was far in Years, and little accuftomed\nto the fatigue of Travel, fell fick of a Fever,\nwhich carried him off in a few Daysb.

Befides,\nif this had been the Cafe, it is impofiible to account\nfor two Circumftances; the firft is, that the King\nof France Ihould be fatisfied with the Account that\nFlamel thought fit to give to Cramoifi; the other,\nthat this Story Ihould never break out during the\nLife of Flamel, nor within an Age after his Death:\nBut as I know there are People, who, to avoid\nbeing fufpe&ed of Credulity, will fwallow any\nThing oppofite to what they think, it would be\na Ihame to believe; I fhall deftroy this Critical\nHiftory of Flamel*s Riches, by an Argument,\neven that thefe People dare not diferedit.

The\nSieur Lucas was no Hermetic Philofopher, no\nChymift, no deep Student in the Sciences ; and if\nwe guefs from his Writings, no Man of Art, or\nAddrefs; but a bold, rough, free-fpoken Tra\u00ad\nveller, who had feen much, and was willing to\ntell the World all he had feen. If from hence,\nany Ihould be led into an Opinion that he was a\nCredulous Man, and might be eafily impofed on,\nI have nothing to fay to that; I do not intend to\nturn Advocate for the Solidity of a Traveller\u2019s\nUnderftanding, any more than for the Truth of\nHermetic Phflofoph\u2019\ny. I only lay down Things\nas they are, or at lead: as they appear to be, and\nleave all the reft to the Readers Decifion. All\nI infift upon, as to the Sieur Lucas's Relation, is\nthis, that he could not be deceived as to the M at'\nter of Fa6t; he could not dream the Story he has\ntold us; he could not fee it in a Vifion, and as to\nthe reft, Id o not concern myfelf about it; he\nmight poftibly be cheated by the Mohammedan\nMonks, for I can readily conceive, that Monks\nR of\ne See the Preface to the Book from which this Story is taken,\nwhich is entitled Voyage de Sieur Paul Lucas fait par Ordre\nDu Roi dans La Greet, &c.

But it is now time to\ncome to the Story, and therefore I fhall put an end\nto my Reflections.\nH e informs us, that being at BrouJJa, in Natolia,\nand going to take the Air towards a little Village\ncalled Bournous Bachy, at a fmall Diftance from\nthence, in Company with a Perfon of DiftinClion j\nhe met with the following Adventure, which I\nfhall relate to you exaCtly in his own Words. We\nwent together to a little Mofque, fays he, where,\none of their moft eminent Dervifes was interred.\nIt is always a Dervife that has the Cuftody of fuch\nPlaces, which are, generally fpeaking, pleafantly\nfituated, adorned with Gardens and Fountains,\nand on that Account, fet a-part for public Walks,\nand Places for Recreation. We were quickly in\u00ad\ntroduced into a little Cloifter, where we found\nfour Dervifes, who received us with all imaginable\nCivility, and defired us to partake of what they\nwere eating; we were told, what we foon found\nto be very true, that they were all Perfons of the\ngreateft Worth and Learning. One of them,\nwho faid he was of the Country of the Usbecks,\n(a Tribe of Tartars) appeared to me more learned\nthat)\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITILITE\n\fL VJ A j\nthan the reft, and I believe verily he fpoke all the\nLanguages in the World. As he did not know\nme to be a Frenchman, after we had converfed\nfometime in the Furkifh Languages, he afked me,\nif I could fpeak Latin, Spani\/h, or Italian. I told\nhim, that if he pleafed, he might talk to me in\nItalian \u2022, but as he foon difcovered by my Accent,\nthat it was not my Mother Tongue, he afked me\nfrankly, what Country I came from. As foon as\nhe knew that I was a Native of France, he fpoke\nto me in as good French as if he had been brought\nup at Paris. How long Sir, faid I, did you ftay\nin France ? He anfwered me, that he had never\nbeen there, but that he had a great Inclination to\nundertake the Journey.\nI did all that lay in my Power to ftrengthen\nthat Refolution, and perfuade him to it, in order\nto which, I told him, that there was no Kingdom\nin the World more polifhedj that Strangers ef-\npecially were extreamly well received there, and\nthat without Queftion, he would receive the great-\neft Satisfaction from this Journey. No, no, re\u00ad\nturned he, I am not in fuch a hurry to make it,\nI fhould be a Fool to flatter myfelf with any fuch\nHopes *\n, I am one of the Sages, and I know that\nit is enough to hinder me from enjoying Quiet\nthere, fo that I am not like to think any more of\nthe Matter. 1 took a great deal of Pains to con\u00ad\nvince him, that he was deceived, that fome bad\nR 2 People\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f' ' [ , 3 2 - !\nPeople had given him ill ImprefTions of my Coun\u00ad\ntry-, tliat France on the contrary, was the very Nur-\nfery of the Learned, and that the King, whofe Sub\u00ad\nject I had the Honour to be, was the greatefl Pa\u00ad\ntron of the Sciences. I went further (till, I told\nhim, that though I had not the Honour to be of\nany learned Profeffion myfelf, yet his Majefty was\npleated to defray the Expences of the Travels in\nwhich he law me engaged, and this with no other\nView than to procure Notices of thofe Things,\nthe Knowlege of which, remained yet necefiary\nfor perfecting the Sciencesj fuch as of Herbs that\nmight be ufeful in Phyfic, antient Monuments,\nthat might contribute to the Illuftration of re\u00ad\nmarkable Events, and confequently ferve to render\nHiltory more compleat; the View of the Coun\u00ad\ntries themfelves, in order to the rectifying Geo\u00ad\ngraphical Charts\u25a0\n, in fine, I run through all the\nProofs i could think of, in order to convince him\nof the Inclination that prevailed in France, in Fa\u00ad\nvour of the Sciences, and of Learning, all which\nhe attributed to the Climate, and feemed to ap\u00ad\nprove what I faid, out of pure Civility. At laft,\nhowever, he feemed to be ravifhed with the fine\nThings I told him, and went fo far as to allure\nme, that fome Time or other he would certainly\ngo thither. Our Converfation being ended, the\nDervifes carried us to their Houfe, which was at\nthe Bottom of the Mountain, very near Bournous\nBachy,\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH IN:\n*\nl l E\n\fBacbyy where having dia. 1\n; \" I x k my\nleave of them, but with a Promife, however, that\nI would come and fee them again.\nO n the 10th, the Dervife whom I took for an\nUJbeck, came to pay me a Vifit. I received him\nin the bell Manner pollible, and as he appeared\nto me a very Learned, as well as curious Man, I\nIhewed him all the Manufcripts I had bought,\nand he allured me, they were very valuable, and\nwritten by great Authors: I mull lay, in Favour\nof this Dervife, that he was a Perfon every way\nextraordinary, even to his outward Appearance.\nHe lhewred me abundance of curious Things in\nPhyfic, and promifed me more *\n, but at the fame\nTime he could not help faying, that it was ne-\ncefiary, that I Ihould make fome extraordinary\nPreparations on my Side, in order to put myfelf\ninto a Condition of profiting by the Lights he was\nable to give me. Tojudge according to his Ap\u00ad\npearance, he Ihould have been a Man about thirty,\nbut by his Difcourfe, he Teemed to have lived at\nleaft a Century, and of this, I was the more per-\nfuaded from the Accounts he gave me of fome\nlong Voyages he had made.\nH e told me, that he was one of feven Friends,\nw'ho all w\nrander\u2019d up and down the World, with\nthe fame View of perfecting themfelves in their\nStudies, and that at parting, they always appoint\u00ad\ned another Meeting at the End of twenty Years,\nin\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITLTE\n\f[ 134]\nin a certain City which was mentioned, and that\nthe firft who came, waited for the reft. I per\u00ad\nceived, without his telling me, that Broujfa was\nthe City appointed for their prefent Meeting.\nThere were four of them there already, and they\nappeared to converfe with each other, with a Free\u00ad\ndom that fpoke rather an old Acquaintance, than\nan accidental Meeting. In a long Converfation,\nwith a Man of great Parts, it is natural to run\nover abundance of curious Topics. Religion and\nnatural Philofophy took up our Thoughts by\nTurns, and at laft, we tell upon Chemiftry, AI-\nchymy, and the Cabala ; I told him, that all thefe,\nand efpecially the Notion of the Philofophers\nStone, were now regarded by moft Men of Senfe,\nas mere Fictions and Chimeras. That, returned\nhe, ought not to furprize you, for in the firft Place\nwe ought to fufter nothing to aftonifh us in this\nLife ; the true Sage hears all Things without be\u00ad\ning fcandalized at them ; but though he may have\nfo much Complaifance, as not to fhock an ignorant\nPerfon when he talks of thefe Things, yet is he\nobliged, do you think, to fink his Underftanding\nto a Level with vulgar Minds, becaufe they are\nnot able to raife their Thoughts to an Equality\nwith his ? When I fpeak of a Sage, faid he, I\nmean that kind of Man to whom alone the Title\nof Philofopher properly belongs. He has no fort\nof tie to the World, he fees all Things die and\nrevive\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ *35 ]\nrevive without Concern; he has more Riches in\nhis Power, than the greateft of Kings, but he\ntramples them under his Feet, and this generous\nContempt, fets him even in the midfl of Indi\u00ad\ngence, above the Power of Events.\nH e r e I Hop\u2019d him. With all thefe fine\nMaxims faid I, the Sage dies, as well as other\nPeople. What imports it therefore to me, to\nhave been either a Fool, or a Philofopher, if\nWifdom hath no prerogative over Folly, and one\nis no more a Shield againft Death than the other?\nAlas! faid he, I perceive you are abfolutely unac\u00ad\nquainted with fublime Science, and have never\nknown true Philofophy. Learn from me my\nFriend, fuch a one as I have defcribed dies indeed,\nfor Death is a Debt which Nature exads, and\nfrom which therefore no Man can be exempt; but\nthen he dies not before the Time fix\u2019d by his great\nCreator. But then you muff obferve, that this Pe\u00ad\nriod approaches near a thoufand Years, and to the\nExtent of that Time a Sage may live. He arrives\nat this, through the knowlege he has of the true\nMedicine. By this means, he is able to ward off\nwhatever may impeach, or hinder the Animal\nFunctions, or deftroy the Temperature of his\nNature. By that, he is enabled to acquire the\nKnowlege of whatever God has left within the\nCognizance of Man. The firft Man knew them\nby his Reafon ; but it was this fame Reafon that\nblotted\nDigitized by Originalfrom\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ i 3<\n* ]\nblotted them again from his Mind ; for having\nattained to this kind of natural Knowlege, he\nbegan to mingle therewith his own Notions and\nIdeas. By this Confufion, ,which was the Effects\nof a foolifh Curiofity, he rendered imperfect even\nthe Work of his Creator, and this Error it is, that\nthe Sage labours to redrefs. The reft of Animals\na\u00a3t only by their Inftindt, by which they preferve\nihemfelves, as at their firft Inftilution, and live as\nlong now, as when the World firft began. Man\nis yet a great deal more perfect j but, has he ftill\npreferved that Prerogative we mentioned, or\nhas he not loft long ago the glorious Privilege of\nliving a thoufond Years, which with fo much Care\nhe fhould have ftudied to preferve ? This then\nit is, that the true Sages have retrieved, and that\nyou may no more be led into miftakes; let me\nafiure you, that this is what they call the Philo-\nfophers Stone, which is not a Chimerical Science,\nas fome half read People fancy, but a thing Solid\nand Sound. On the other Hand, it is certainly\nknown, but to a few, and indeed it is impofiible\nit fhould be made known to moft part of Man^\nkind, whom Avarice or Debauch deftroy, or\nwhom an impetuous defire of Life kills.\nSurprized at all I heard, and would you\nthen perfuade me, faid I, that all who have pof-\nfefled the Philofophers Stone, have likewife lived\na thoufand Years? Without doubt, returned he\ngravely.\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE * THE GETTY RESEARCH INS\n<\nTE\n\f[ >37 ]\ngravely, for whenever God has been pleafed to\nfavour any Mortal with that BlefTing, it depends\nentirely on himfelf to reach the Age of a thoufand\nYears, as in his State of Innocence the firft Man\nmight have done. I told him, that there had been in\nour Country, lome of thofe happy Mortals that were\nfaid to have poflcfled thisLife-giving Stone, and yet\nhad never extended their Days to fuch a Length as\nto go with a decripidnefs, that muft attend fuch an\nexcefilve an Age, into another State. But, con\u00ad\ntinued he, don\u2019t you know that the Appellation\nof a Philofopher, is much proftituted \u2022\n, let me tell\nyou once again, there is none properly fuch, but\nthofe who live to the Age I have mentioned. At\nlaft, I took the Liberty to mention the illuftrious\nFlamel, who, I faid, had poflefled the Philofopher\u2019s\nStone, but was dead to all Intents and Purpofes\nfor all that. At the mention of his Name, he\nfmiled at my Simplicity. As I had by this Time\nbegun to yeild fome degree of Credit to his Dif-\ncourfe, I was lurprized he fliould make a Doubt of\nwhat I advanced, upon this Head; the Dervife\nobferved this, and could not help faying with an\nAir of Mirth, and do you really think the Thing\nfo ? do you actually believe Flamel is dead ? No,\nno, my Friend, continued he, don\u2019t deceive your-\nfelf, Flamel is living (till, neither he nor his Wife\nare yet at all acquainted with the dead. It is not\nabove three Years ago fince I left both the one and\nS the\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ >33 1\nthe other in the Indies, and he is, laid he, one of\nmy beft Friends; upon which, he was going to\ntell me, how their Acquaintance grew, but Hop\u00ad\nping himfelf Ihort of a fudden, that, faid he, is\nlittle to the purpofe, I will rather give you his\ntrue Hiftory, with refpe<5\nt to which, in your\nCountry, I dare fay, you are not very well ac\u00ad\nquainted.\nW e Sages, continued he, though rare in the\nWorld, yet are we equally of all Sedls and Pro-\nfeflions, neither is there any great inequality a-\nmongft us on that Account. A little before the\nTime of Flamel, there was a Jew of our Fra\u00ad\nternity ; but as through his whole Life he had a\nmoll ardent Affe&ion for his Family, he could not\nhelp defiring to fee them after he once came to\nthe Knowlege of their being fettled in France.\nW e forefaw the Danger of the Thing, and did\nall that in us lay, to divert him from this Journey,\nin which we often fucceeded. At laft, however,\nthe Paffion of feeing his Family grew fo ftrong\nupon him, that go he would; but at the Time\nof his Departure, he made us a folemn Promife to\nreturn to us as foon as it was pofilble. In a Word,\nhe arrived at Paris, which was, as it is now, the\nCapital of the Kingdom, and found there, his Fa\u00ad\nther\u2019s Defendants were in the higheft Efteem a-\nmong the Jews. Amongft others, there was a\nRabbi, who had a Genius for the true Philofophy,\nand\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INST .TE\n\fC \u00bb3P ]\nand who had been long in Search of the great\nSecret.

The Pre-\nfervation of Life, the defending the human Body\nfrom decay, and of rendering it a fit Tenement\nfor the Soul to inhabit, in that Seafon in which\nfhe is moft capable of exerting her nobleft Fa\u00ad\nculties, are grave and ferious Subjects; with which\nno trivial Matters ought to mingle. Befides, to\nfpeak my Opinion freely, though I think the Me\u00ad\nthod of Hermippus extreamly proper for repairing\nthe Waftes of Nature, and preventing the Incom-\nT 2 modities\nI INTERNET ARCHIVE\nDigitized by Original from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ !4 8 ]\nmodities which ufually attend on Years; yet I am\nfar from believing, that this Method would con\u00ad\ntribute at all to the Extention of Youth, but rather\nthe contrary; and for this I think, I am able to\noffer fome very probable Reafons.\nI n the firft Place, it will be neceffary to ob\u00ad\nserve, that I do not here mean by Youth, a ftate\nof Infancy or Childhood, but rather that robuft\nState between twenty-five and forty; for the Con\u00ad\nvention of very young People with each other,\nI conceive to be as wholefome for their Bodies, as\nit is pleafant and agreeable to their Minds. But\nwhen the human Body is arrived at its full\nStrength, and is in that State of Health in which\nTemperance and Equanimity will maintain it, a\nSurcharge of animal Spirits may not only prove\nufelefs, but dangerous. It is an old, and a very\ntrue Obfcrvation, that the moft florid State of\nHealth, is that, in wT\nhich a Man is in the greateft\nPeril, in cafe he receives any Infedlion, and the\nReafon is obvious, viz. becaufe the animal Spirits\na\u00a3t then with the utmoft Vigour, and confequently\nmuft do the more Mifchief, if by any means they\nare tainted.

I might alfo obferve, that the Converiation\nof many young Women, might, in the Summer\nof Life, draw along with it other Inconveniencies ;\nbut thefe are Subjects on which I do not chufe to\ninflft, becaufe it is not eafy to treat them with that\nDelicacy, which a Philofophic Difcourfe like this,\nrequires ; and becaufe the flighted Hint is fufflcient\nto fuggeft more to a Man of good Senfe, than is\nat all neceflary to be delivered upon this Subject.\nI take it therefore for granted, that I have ai-\nflgned the proper Bounds to my Remedy, and that\nI may fafely define it, the Cordial of advanced\nYears, which can never be fafely adminiftered, till\nfrom ajuft Application of Reafon, there has been\nproduced an ablolute retreat of Appetite n.\nBut if any one fhould be mad enough to pur-\nfue this Objection further, and cry out, of what\nSignificancy then is your Remedy ? why in fuch a\nSituation would you extend Life at all, or of what\nufe is Years when deprived of Enjoyments?

For as on the\none hand, I cannot allow that fuch a Perfon fhould\ngratify, or fo much as feel his Pafiions, fo on the\nother, I would not have him plunged into deep\nand perplexing Studies, but rather amufed and di\u00ad\nverted by purl'uits of another Nature. At parti\u00ad\ncular Sealons, indeed, he might difcourfe with his\nFriends on grave and ferious Topics ; but I would\nnot have fuch Conventions return too frequently,\nfor fear of their leading him by Degrees into Me-\nlancholly, which is nothing elfe but fixing the\nThoughts too intently on a fingle Objedt.

It would not therefore\nfurprize me, if thefe Gentlemen fhould take it into\ntheir Heads, to treat this as a Whimfical and\ntrifHing Performance, becaufe I know that accord\u00ad\ning to their Syftem, old Men are fo many Incum\u00ad\nbrances, of which, the State ought to be difcharg\u2019d.\nIt is upon this Principle I prelume, that fome\nIndian Nations make great Feafts in their Families,\nwhen their Chief becomes decripid, and when\nthefe Rejoicings are over, fairly put him out of\nthe Way \u00b0. Our Free-thinkers in Politics there\u00ad\nfore.\n\u00b0 I remember to have read in a late French Writer, that\nthis is pra&ifed by fome of the barbarous Nations, who live\nin the Neighbourhood of Hudfon\u2019s Bay ; and he fays lurcher,\nthat he was prefent at one of thefe Fealts, at the Clofe of\nwhich, the Son cut the Throat of his Father. I do not re\u00ad\ncollect, that he bellows any ReheCtions upon this Palfoge ;\nbut from the Account he has given us of the Country, I think\nit\n\fr *5* ]\nfore, muft necefiarily have a bad Opinion (at leaft\nwhile they are young) of fuch a Proportion as\nthis, which intends no more than prolonging the\nLives of thofe, who, in the Account of our\nMachiavelijis, ought to be in their Graves already.\nWhat Benefit, fay they, can refult to Society from\nmaintaining People paft their Labours, and who,\naccording to this very Scheme, are declared unfit\nfor Propagation ? The Public is only benefited by\naCtive and induftrious Perfons, why then fhould\nfo much Care be taken to preferve People fit only\nfor a fedentary Life ? If the ordinary Laws of Na\u00ad\nture can be difpenfed with, let it be in Favour of\nthe Public Weal, why fhould the extravagant\nDefire of Life be gratified, rather than any other\nextravagant Defire whatever? Reflections like\nthefe, it is evident, muft induce thefe over-wife\nPerfons to treat my Book with Contempt, what\u00ad\never Opinion they may have of the Arguments\ncontained in i t ; and therefore it is neceflary for\nme to fliew, that thefe Maxims, how plaufible,\nhow refined foever they may appear, are very far\nfrom\nit no difficult Matter to diftinguiffi the Caufe of fo inhuman (I\nfhould be in the wrong to call it fo brutal) a Cuftom, which I\ntake to be this, that they find it very difficult in that part of\nthe World to acquire Subfifiance, and therefore think them-\nfelves under a kind of Neceffity of maintaining only fuch as\nare ufcful. This, 1 perfuade myfelf, was the Original of fo\nhorrid a Pradlice, which cannot, however, be founded on real\nNeceffity, becaufe thefe People who murder their Parents,\npreferve their Children, though equally helplefs.\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INST\u00a7\n\f[ *53 ]\nfrom being either jult or realonable, and which is\nftill of greater Weight in the prefent Cafe, ai*e\nfar from being calculated for the Benefit of Man\u00ad\nkind in general p.\nI t is, I think, a Fadl fo well eftablifhed, that\nI need be at no great Pains to prove it, that\nmoll of the Mifchiefs and Miferies broughr upon\nprivate Families, and even upon whole Nations,\nflow from the Warmth of Mens Pafiions, and\nfrom their indulging their irregular Inclinations at\nthe Expence of others, nay and of Society it-\nfelf. I cannot, therefore, help thinking, that it\nmight be a means of leflening thefe Evils, if\np It may be, perhaps, thought I exaggerate a little in\nfuppofing, that there are People capable ot reafoning in fuch\na Manner; but, whoever conliders the Principles of the Spar\u00ad\ntan Government, and the Syllem of Morals, recommended by\nLycurgus, will be of another Opinion. Neither are we to\nimagine, that only fevere Politicians are inclined to fuch a\nDodtrine ; there have been in all Ages fome polite Writers,\nand refined Wits, who have been inclined to treat old Age,\nnot as a Misfortune only, but as a Crime. For Inftance, Cor\u00ad\nnelius Gallus, one of the Favourites of Auguftus, and himfelf\nthe Patron of Virgil, and of Horace, paints old Age thus.\nStat dubius tremulufq; fenex, femperq; malorum\nCredulus et Stultus quae facit iple timet.\nLaudat prxteritos, prefentes defpicit annos:\nHoc tantum in redlum quod facit ipfe putat.\nTrembling and Doubtful, ftill the Old we find.\nAnd much to Credit all ill News inclin\u2019d ;\nFoolilhly fearful of what e\u2019re they do,\nAnd when it\u2019s done, they\u2019re apprehenfive too.\nPafs\u2019d times their Praife, the prefent claim their Spighf.\nAnd only what they do thcmfelves is Right.\nu we\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\n\f[ IJ4 3\nwe could encreafe the Number of thofe who are\nfree from fuch irregular and depraved Appetites,\nand are confequently mod capable of conducing\nwith Judgment and Integrity, either public or\nprivate Affairs. It is remarkable, that in all\nwell-governed States, a certain maturity of Age\nis required before Men are entrufted, not only\nwith the Management of public Concerns, but of\ntheir own. Upon what Reafon then is this found\u00ad\ned ? Is it not becaufe they are thought to want in\nthe firft Place, the Lights of Experience, and in\nthe next, to be too much hurried by their Pafiions ?\nIf this be right, and if it be not right, the wifeft\nMen in all Ages have been in the wrong: If this\nI fay be right, why fhould we fancy Men pal's\u2019d\ntheir Labours; for being in pofTeffion of thofe\nQualities which are certainly the firft Ingredients\nin the conftituting true Wifdom ? There will be\nalways People enough in the World full of that\nHeat, Vigour, and Strength, which is requifite for\ncarrying on the a<\n5\ntive and laborious Parts of Bu-\nfinefs ; but we fee plainly, that private Families\nare brought to Ruin, and by Degrees, great States\ndecay for want of that Moderation, Experience,\nand Forefight, of which, Men far in Years, and\nwhofe Spirits are not opprefifed with the Infirmities\nof Age, are ufually poffefTed.

As to what refpedts Generation,\nit is a very (light and idle Surmife *\n, for if in Po-\npifh Countries Monafteries are found no great In\u00ad\nconvenience, where thofe that (ill them make\nVows of Celebacy in the Flower of their Age,\ncertainly for Men who are turned of Seventy to\nforbear getting Children, can never be an Incon\u00ad\nvenience to any State.\nT hi s is undoubtedly a fufficient Anfwer as to the\ngeneral Reafoning of thofe I would refute; but\nwith Refpeft to the Do&rine I have endeavoured\nto eftablifti, a dill clearer and more explicit An\u00ad\nfwer might be given. For without enquiring\nwhether their Principles be wrong or right, I may\n.eafily obferve, that nothing I have laid down tends\nto burthen Society with a Race of Dotards. What\nI propofe, is quite the contrary. If, on the one\nHand, I plead for the Extention of human Life,\nI recommend on the other, fuch a Method as mud\npreferve the Faculties in the higheft Order.

It\nis, therefore, an unjuft and unfair Imputation up\u00ad\non my Principles, that they tend to burthen the\nWorld with ufelefs People, fince the utmoft to\nwhich they can be drained is, that I am for pre-\nferving as long as polTible, the Lives of fuch as\nmay be ufeful. As to the Subfiftance again of\nfuch People, it is eafy to difcern, that this can be\nbut a very trifling Expence, when compared even\nwith what they are able to acquire towards the\nIncreafe of the common Stock. So, that con-\nfidered in this, which is the very word Light\nin which the Thing can be put, a true Politician,\nand one who has a proper Regard for the Intered,\nand at the fame Time, a juft refpeft for the Rights\nof Mankind, will be far from thinking that I\nhave offered any Thing which can be prejudicial\nto a well-ordered Society, but have rather pro\u00ad\nvided a very good Method for fecuring a condant\nSupply of fuch Counfello\/s, as may preferve it\nin the bed Order poflible.\nO n this Occaflon, I beg leave to cite a Paflage\nwhich Tiilly hath put into the Mouth of the elder\nCato% thatdeferves as much Attention from its\nSolidity, and good Senfe, as it does Praife for the\nBeauty\nn \u2022 Ciccr. de Seneftute. c. ii.\nDigithze : by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH IN S T | PTE\n\f[ \\5 7 ]\nBeauty and Accuracy of Stile, in which it is deli\u00ad\nvered. C\n<\n*to is there anfwering the very Objec\u00ad\ntion, which I have been treating. \u201c If, fays hey\n\u201c Petulence or Lull be Vices more frequent among\n\u201c young Men than Old, yet all young Men are\n\u201c not infe6ted with them, but fuch only as want\n\u201c proper Talents, fo it is with that fort of Diftem-\n\u201c per which you call Dotage, it is indeed the\n\u201c Difeafe of old Men *\n, but, however, all old Men\n\u201c are not infe<5\nted with it. Appius was for fome\n\u201c Years quite dark, and yet he managed a Family\n4t of four Sons grown up, and five Daughters,\ntc with abundance of Relations and Clients, who\n* depended upon him. He kept his Mind always\n\u201c in order, and though his Vigour decayed, yet\n<\nc his Senfes never failed him. He preferved to\n<\n\u00a3 the laft Moment his Character, and his Au-\n\u201c thority every body looked up towards him as\n\u201c became their Station \u2022\n, his Slaves feared, his\n\u201c Children revered, and all who were about him,\n1\n4 Loved him. In a Word, he kept up the old\n4\n4 Difcipline, and did Honour to the RomanName,\n\u201c by preferving the Manners of his Family un-\n\u201c tainted. So that it is plain, old Age may\n\u201c maintain a graceful Superiority, ifit bejealous of\n\u201c its Prerogative *\n, if on all Occafions it maintains\n\u201c its right, if it never fneaks and gives way, but\n\u201c keeps up a Manly Spirit to the laft. For as\nct I approve fome Qualities of Age in a young\nMan,\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITI TE\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\n\f[ 'iS ] 1\n4\n4 Man, To a Youthful Spirit is very commendable\n44 in Men of Years, for while they preferve this,\n\u201c though the Body may feel the effe&s of Age,\n4\n4 yet the Mind ftands out of its reach. At this\n4\n4 very Inftant I am employed in writing the Se-\n\u201c ventb Book of my Antiquities, and am actually\n44 making large Collections from fuch old Records,\n44 as may ferve my purpofe. I likewife, Review,\n\u201c and fometimes touch a frefh, the Orations I have\n\u201c formerly made in the capital Caufes, wherein I\n44 have been concerned : I ftill keep up my Stock of\n44 knowlege in the Augurial, Pontifical, and Civil\n44 Law, and have time enough to read a great\n44 deal of Greek befides. I conftantly ufe the Py-\n44 thagorean Method for the Exercife of my Me-\n<\n4 mory, and every Evening run over in my Mind,\n4\n4 whatever I have faid, heard or done that Day.\n44 Thefe are the Exercifes of the Underftanding,\n44 and in thefe, as in a Chariot, the Soul takes the\n44 Air, while I am capable of thefe, I don\u2019t\n\u20184 give myfelf much concern about bodily Decays,\n4\n4 I am always at the Command of my Friends,\n4\n4 attend the Service of the Houfe frequently, and\n44 diftinguilh myfelf in Debates, wherein a Man\n44 compafies more by the flrength of his Facul-\n4\n4 ties, than he can do ellewhere, by Force of\n4\n4 Arms. But fliould it ever prove my Misfor-\n4\n4 tune to be confined to my Bed, and be thereby\n4\n4 rendered incapable of going through thefe Em-\n44 ployments.\nDigitized by oYiginal from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INST ^ fTE\n\f[ l 59 1\n5\u2018 ployments, yet the very thoughts of what I\n\u201c would do, if I were able, would confole me.\nBut thanks be to Heaven, I have no reafon to\n\u201c apprehend any fuch Thing, I have been abetter\n\u201c Hufband of my Time than fo, for let a Man\n\u201c be butconftantly exercifed in Labours like thefe,\n\u2022* and he will not fo foon find the Breaches of Age.\n,e Years will fteal upon him infenfibly, he will\n<\nc grow old by Degrees and without feeling it;\n\u201c nay, when he comes to break at laft, the Houle\n\u201c will crumble gently, and fall down fo (lowly,\nas not to give him any great Pain\u201d . This is\na very fine Picture, and contains a more finifhed\nApology for that {fate of Life which I am endea\u00ad\nvouring to extend, than my Abilities would luffer\nme to draw, but the very producing it, ferves my\npurpofe better than if I had wrote it. If I follow\nthe Sentiments of Cicero, and the Example of Cato\nthe Elder, who fhall queftion either my Senfe, or\nmy ConduCt ?\nI t ought to be further confidered, that for per\u00ad\nfecting many of the Sciences, a longer Life is\nrequifite than Men ufually enjoy ; or to fpeak with\ngreater Propriety, the free Exercife of their Facul\u00ad\nties to a more advanced Age. If we examine all the\nImprovements that have been made in true Science,\nwe fhall find, that they have proceeded from Men,\nwho have exercifed their Thoughts in fuch kind\nof Studies for a long Courfe of Years. The laft\nBooks\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f\u2022 C Ifo ]\nBooks of Arijlotle, are efteemed the mod pcrfeCt,\nfo are thofe of Seneca, which he wrote in an ad\u00ad\nvanced Age *\n, and we may fay the fame Thing\nwith requeft to modern Philofophers *\n, fuch as\nGajfendi, Bacon, and Newton. A ferene old Age is\ntherefore of the higheft Confeqnence in this Re-\nfpeCt, fince it would contribute to furnifli the\nWorld with new and uleful Lights, and prevent\nthe Expectations they conceive from the early\nProductions of great Men, from being fruftrated\nas they frequently are, by their premature Deaths.\nI muft likewife obferve, that mechanical Inventi\u00ad\nons acquire much Time to PcrfeCt them, and that\nvery profitable Dilcoveries, and very ufeful Ma\u00ad\nnufactures have been loft, by the Deaths of thofe\nwho firft Cultivated them, of which many Inftan-\nces might be given. We may likewife remark,\nthat fettling any new Plantation *\n, reforming a So\u00ad\nciety ; or in fhort, reducing any People who have\nbeen long under an ill form of Government, or\nin a great mealure without any, requires length of\nDays. Lewis XIV. changed entirely the Face of\nThings in France during his Reign, which was\nprincipally owing to the length of it, as it gave\nhim an opportunity of feeing molt of his Schemes\nbrought to bear ; whereas, the unexpected Death\nof the Great Czar Peter, caul'ed many of his Pro\u00ad\njects to be buried in Oblivion, and mult have over\u00ad\nturned the whole of his Glorious defign for re\u00ad\nforming\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal fror'\nTHE GETTY RESEARCI TE\n\f[ 1(0 ]\nForming his Subjects, and raifing the Credit of his\nCrown, with the reft of the European Powers \u2022\n, if,\nwhich was fcarce to be expected, his Succeflors had\nnot generally fpeaking, perfifted in the purfuit of\nhis Plan. We may therefore eafily difcern, that\nfuch an extention of Life as this Treatife propo-\nfes, would be fo far from contributing to burthen\nthe World with an ufelefs race of old Men, that\nit would really furnifh it with fuch People, as are\nmoft wanted for the Improvement of Knowlege,\nthe perfecting mechanical Difcoveries, and contri\u00ad\nbuting in other RelpeCts, to the Welfare of Man\u00ad\nkind.\nU p o n the whole, therefore, I think I may\nvery juftly conclude, that by examining this\nantient Infcription, I have not only exercifed my\nThoughts in a Manner that may contribute to\nthe Amufement of the Learned *\n, but that I have\nhinted many Things which may be of public\nUtility. In this RefpeCf, indeed, I think, I\nhave made the proper Ufe of the Infcription;\nfor certainly, it is much better to inform our-\nfelves as to Things than Words, and the World\nwould be much more indebted to the Labours of\nlearned Men, if they would pay that Regard to this\nMaxim which it deferves. What Ufe would\nit be of to Mankind, fuppofing it poftible for\nme to fix the Reign of the Roman Emperor,\nunder which Hermippus flourifhed ? or what\nX Thanks\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\f[ iS a ]\nThanks would my Readers owe me, if I had en\u00ad\ndeavoured to difcufs whether he lived to hundred\nand fifty-five, or a hundred and fifteen only. Have\nI not chofen the better Part, in examining what\nmay ftill be of fome Ufe, viz. By what Method\nhe arrived at fo great an Age, and how far it is\npracticable for us to follow his Method. I think,\nI may go ftill farther, and affirm, that I have\nmade it at leaft extreamly probable, that the An-\nhelitus Puellamm, is in fome Meafure the Breath\nof Life \u2022\n, in order to which, I hope I have effec\u00ad\ntually deftroyed fome Prejudices that affeCted the\nMinds even of People of good Senfe, as to the\nfettled Term of human Life, and the Impoffibility\nof prolonging it by Art. I have likewife, in the\nCourfe of this Differtation, collected the Senti\u00ad\nments of feveral great Men, who think, or lead\nfeem to me, to think in the fame Way that I do,\nand have thereby given an Opportunity to the\ncurious and inquifitive Reader, of fearching more\nftriCtly into their Opinions, in order to do them\nJuftice, in cafe, after mature Confideration, he\nthinks that I have failed in fo doing.\nI f this fhould contribute little to the Elucida\u00ad\ntion of the prefent Point, yet it might prove the\nMeans of bringing many Things of Confequence\nto light. We have made it evident, by our Cita\u00ad\ntions from old Books, that many of the Dilcove-\nries for which the Moderns are famous, were actu\u00ad\nally\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTI JTE\n\f[ i ]\nally known to the Learned in former Times;\nwhence we may [ cbably conje&ure, that fome\nother Things were know to them, with which\nwe are not acquainted, and the rather, becaufe\nthere is force anv Country where antient Monu\u00ad\nm ent are to be touiid, but we may diicern in them\nMarks of Skill and Capacity, that tranfcend the\nPower of modern Workmen, and though thefe\nmay not be agreeable to the prefent Tafte which\nfeems to be a handfome Exprefiion for the reign\u00ad\ning Humour of Mankind, that changes too\noften to deferve the Name of a Rule, yet they {till\nmanifeft great quicknefs of Invention, and the pof-\nfelfion of many Arts, that are now loft. It is fome\nCredit to Antiquity, that the oldeft building in\nthe World, which is the Temple of P\u2019\nhefeus at\nAthens, is by far the fineft; and in literature again,\nHomer and Hippocrates, plainly prove, that in\npoint of Genius, or of Induftry, the firft Ages\nare yet unrival\u2019d. There are fcveraJ Roads which\nlead to true Wifdom, we may fometimes reach it\nby going backwards, as well as forwards, and pro\u00ad\nfit as much be detecting the Prejudices of the\nModerns, as by refuting the Errors of Antiquity.\nIt is a juft Obfervation of the great Lord Verulam,\nthat much Learning frees us from thofe Miftakes\ninto which we are plunged, by having only a lit\u00ad\ntle. When firft the Moderns began to examine\nthe Writings of Herodotus, and Pliny, they found\nX 2 nothing\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\nOriginal from\nTHE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITL TE\n\ft 1 6 4 ]\nnothing but Abfurdities and Improbabilies; but\nnow, that we are better acquainted with Experi\u00ad\nmental Philofophy, we begin to have a better opi\u00ad\nnion of thefe Authors, and are obliged to confefs,\nthat in fome Cafes, fagacity may fupply Expe\u00ad\nrience. I am, however, ready to admit, that in\nfome Branches of Science, we have out done the\nAntients very much; but what of that, we are\nftill far fhort of Perfection. Our very Difcoveries\nprove i t ; for example, we difcern the Effects of\nGravity, we fee the whole Mechanifm of the Uni-\nverfe, depend upon i t ; but the Caufe has been hi\u00ad\ntherto inexplicable. We are well acquainted with the\nmany properties of the Needle, which were Secrets\nto former Times, but the caufe of its Variation re\u00ad\nmains a Secret to us. We have, indeed, made fome\nbold Gueffes at both, and it is not impoflible, that\nPofterity may be able to demonftrate our Conjec\u00ad\ntures ; as it is on the other Hand, likewife pof-\nftble, that they may prove them to be only idle\nConjectures. If we would avoid being deceived,\nwe mult decline Bigottry of all Sorts, we mull not\ncarry our Veneration for the Antients too far, and\nat the fame Time, we ought not to be afraid of\nufing a juft Freedom with the Moderns; fince it\nis not our Bufinefs to admire others, but to inftruCt\nourfelves.\nW ith the fame View of coming at Truth, by\nletting the Subject of which I treat in different\nLights,\nDigitized by Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTI\n4\nI\nJTE\n\f[ \u00ab65 ]\nLights, I have ftated the Opinions of others fairly,\nand have reafoned upon them as freely as I defire\nto fee my own Syftem treated. I have given the\nReader the Sentiments of Aftrologers, and of\nHermetic Philofophers on this Infcription, and\nhave left it to him to decide, whether they are\nmore in the right than I, or whether we may not\nbe all miftaken, and this Infcription have at laft\nfome other Secret, and yet more probable Senfe than\nany of us have reached. To encourage, an ex-\naft Difcuflion of this, I have often inculcated the\nUfefulnefs of fuch an Enquiry, and I think, have\nfully proved without the Poffibility of a Reply,\nthat as it is very practicable to extend the Thread\nof Life, beyond that length to which it ufually\nreaches, fo this will be a real Benefit, and not an\nidle, or trifling Difcovery. Thefe are the princi\u00ad\npal Points that I have laboured, and to avoid that\nheavinefs and drynefs which is commonly com\u00ad\nplained of, in Difcourfes of this kind: I have fre\u00ad\nquently made Excurfions for the Entertainment of\nmyfelf and my Readers, and have inferted abun\u00ad\ndance of curious Pafiages from fcarce and valuable\nBooks, that I hope will make full amends for the\ntrouble of perufing this Treadle, even to fuch as\nmay remain unconvinced of the Truth, or practi\u00ad\ncability of my Syftem. At leaft, I can fay this\nfor my Book and for myfelf, that nothing has been\nomitted within the Reach of my P ----- ~ u:~u\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE\n\f[ i 6 6 ] -\nmight render it at once both profitable and plea-\nfant-, and therefore, I hope, that if any one fhall\ntake the Trouble of Criticifing it, he willatleaft\ntreat it with that Candour and good Manners\nwhich I have ufcd through the whole, and not\nwith that fjrly and pedantic Peevifhnefs which is\ntoo often vifible in the Works of Minor Critics,\nwho value themfelves much more on expofing the\nFaults of other Men, than on manifefting any\nvaluable Qualities in themfelves, and are better\npleafed to deftroy an Edifice ere&ed by another,\nthan to acquire a juft Reputation, by raifing a\nbetter Structure of their own.\nT h e r e is one Thing more I muff remark,\nand it is this, that my Syftem is entirely on the\nright Side: I have not undertaken to demonftrate\nas many have done, a Paradox in the Teeth of\ncommon Senfe, and the common Interefl of the\nhuman Species, of which the famous Encomium\non Folly, and the Panegyric on Drunkennefs, are\nglaring Inftances ; but what I have laid down in\nthis Dilcourfe is, with a View to public Utility,\nand from a defire of doing Good; if therefore,\nupon throughly fifting this Difpute, the Matter\nfhould come at laft to be in Equilibrio, I hope the\nturn of the Scales will be allowed me ; for furely,\nif Senfe be preferable to Dotage, Eafe to Pain,\nor Life to Death, I have a fair Title to this Fa\u00ad\nvour. I would not be underftood, to intereft by\nthis\nDigitized by . Original from\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INS^i ^TE\n\f[ i<$7 1\nthis Means, the Inclinations or Prejudices of my\nReaders, on my Side, for that might prove Detri-\nfecure me againft the Effe&s of a Petulant H u\u00ad\nmour, which reigns but too much in the World, of\ndiHiking whatever has the appearance of Novelty,\nand fuppofing, that there is fomething equally Juft\nand Wife, in maintaining old Opinions againft New,\nand in running down any Syftem upon its firft Ap\u00ad\npearance. Againft this unequitable Prepoffeffion,\nin favour of Antique Notions, I fet up this Claim\nto the good Will of Men, founded on the Benefits\nrefulting from my Syftem, to the human Species,\neither confidered as Individuals or in Society. It\nwas upon the fame Principle, that the late Dr.\nHarvey, eftablifhed his Do&rine of the Circulation\nof the Blood, which he juftly obferved, would\nExempt the Art of Phyfic from many Reproaches,\nand enable us to give a clearer and more rational\nAccount of the Animal Oeconomy. On this\nBafis too, (lands the Philofophy of Sir Ifaac New-\nton, which is perhaps the nobleft Effort of the\nhuman Underftanding. I do not mean by this, to\ncompare my Invention with theirs, or myfelf to\neither of thofe great Men. All I aim at is, to\n(hew, that the greateft Men have had need of In\u00ad\ndulgence, when they propounded new Syftems *\n,\nwhence I infer, that iuch a defire cannot be thought\nmental to Truth ; but I introduce this remark, to\neither\n\f[ ]\neither unjuft or unrealonable, in the leaft, as I rea*\ndily own myfelf to be.\nH ere, then, let me reft this Affair, and after\ntaking fo much Pains to render this Work not al-\ntogether unworthy the View of the Public, or the\nEye of equal and impartial Judges, I refign it freely\nto their Confideration, and depend upon their Can\u00ad\ndour and Humanity for the kind Acceptance of my\nLabours.\nf i n i s :\nDigitized by\nINTERNET ARCHIVE THE GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE\nOriginal from\n\f","_id":1018}
