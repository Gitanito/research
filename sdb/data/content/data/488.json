Apparition at the Time of Death.\nL. 1220.\nThis case was first brought to our notice by Miss H. E.\nMacklin, who has been an Associate of the Society for some\nyears, in the following letter :\nJune 26, 1918.\nMy nephew, 2nd Lieut. David Macklin, was killed near Albert,\nMarch 27th [1918], his mother receiving the news from the War\nOffice on April 3. On the night March 27-28 (within a few hours\nof his death), she saw him (whether in sleep or not is doubtful),\nand believed it to be an intimation of his death. She made\nno written record at the time, but spoke of it that day to her\nsister and her servant.\na2 \u2022\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1919.\nIt is an interesting point tliat she saw him dressed in a way\nwliich surjirised and puzzled Jier, but which seems to have been\ncorrect. We could probably make certain.\nHelen B. Macklin.\nOn July 2, 1918, Miss Macklin called at the S.P.R. Rooms\nand save the Secretary further particulars in regard to the\ncase. As a result of this interview she kindly expressed her\nwillinoness to collect the necessary evidence.\nA statement from the percipient, Mrs. Macklin, was received\na few days later, as follows :\n'\nWhite Wood Corner, Sandy.\nJuly 5, 1918.\nMy sister-in-law has asked me to write to you about an im-\npression 1 had of my son coming to me about the time of his\ndeatli\n.\nI did not make any note of it at the time, but I know the\ndate, because I spoke of my impression next day to a sister who\ncame to visit me that day and to a servant who came home\nthe same afternoon, March 28th.\nWhen the German offensive began on March 21st, I was\nanxious about my son, because he was (2nd Lieut, in the 4th\nBedfordshire), as I believed, somewhere in the neighltourliood of\nArras.\nOn the night of the 27th March or in the early hours of the\n28th (I don't know the time), I had what I can only describe\nas a waking dream. I mean that it did not seem just an\nordinary dream to me.\nWhen I got uj) on the Thursday morning it was so vivid that\nit haunted me, and I spoke of it, as I said, on that day.\nIt seemed that I felt or heard footsteps along the verandah\noutside my bedroom window (I live in a bungalow), and that I\nruslied out knowing the steps were my boy's. (Bodily I did not\nleave my bed.)\nI seemed to see him with a \" tin hat\" and his jmck with webbing\nequi])ment, and my general feeling was great dismay tliat he\nshould be in ''\nTommy's kit,\" and I exclaimed, \" Oh, David boy,\nyou have never disgraced your officer's uniform and had to go\nback to Tommy's clothes.\" '\n'\n'\n(1 am i-ather troubled at repeating this, because it almost\nseems tn iin])ly that 1 h;id doubts of my boy, which T certainly\n\fJan., 1919. Gases. 5\nhad iiot. He was a very dear sou and brother, and had got\non splendidly as Intelligence officer; he was a most hapjiy and\nvery keen soldier, and letters from his senior officers and men\ntestify to his efficiency and courage, as well as to his thoroughly\ngood and useful work.)\nHe passed as in a flash and I can't say that he looked at\nme, it was more a feeling of knowing he was there. From that\ntime I expected bad news of him and I was not surprised to get\na telegram from the W.O. on the 3rd April, to tell me that my\nson had been killed in action on March the 27th.\n1 think that the dream or impression, whichever it Avas, haunted\nme all the more, because on the last evening of my son's leave\nbefore he returned to France on Jan. 31, I was helping him to\npack, and naturally there was one thought uppermost, though we\nwere both quite cheerful. I said to him, If what we can't\nhelp thinking about should happen, will you try to come to me ?\n\"\nI He did not say anything, but he would always try to do any-\nthing he could that I asked him, and I believe if it were in\nhis power that he would have willed to come to me at the time\nof his death.\nOn Friday, April 5th, two of my other sons came home. I\nwas talking to them about my impression of their brother's\ncoming to me and my trouble that he should be wearing Tommy's\nclothes. And they both said, \"That is how he would have\nseemed to you.\"\nI think that is all I can tell you, and it does not seem very\nmuch, but mv sister-in-law asked me to write.\nMarian M. Mauklin.\nY\nAfter making this statement Mrs. Mackliii wrote to her\nsister and to the servant to whom she had mentioned her\nexperience before it was verified to obtain their corroboration.\nWe quote her letters below to show that her enquiries \\\\'ere\ncouched in quite general terms. .\nLetter from Mrs. Macklin to Lizzie Reynolds.\nDo you remember when you came home for Easter, my teUing\nyou about a sort of dream I had had about Master David ^\nI have been asked if you would mind writing down what yon\nremember of what I told you.\nIf you. don't remember,, never mind, but if you do remember\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jak., 1919.\nanything, just state what \\ou can. Give your reason for re-\nmembering the date.\nTo this letter Mrs. Mackliu received the following reply :\nAugust 13, 1918.\nMrs. Macklin has asked nic to write what I remember concerning\nthe dream she had of her son, Mr. David Macklin. On March\n28th Mrs. Macklin related to me, how during some period of the\nnight of March 27th she saw in a dream Mr. David running\nalong the verandah in his tin helmet and private's uniform, when\nshe exclaimed :\n\" Oh, David, what have you done to disgrace\nyourself?\" -The following Wednesday [April 3] Mrs. Macklin\nreceived a telegram stating her son had been killed in action\non Wed.. March 27th. L. Reynolds.\nP.S.\u2014I am quite certain it was March 28th Mrs. Macklin\nspoke to me of her dream, as I had been away several weeks,\nand returned home on that date to spend Easter.\nLetter from Mrs. Macklin to Miss Bridgman.\nI have been asked if you would write an account of what\nyou remember of my telling you about my impression or dream,\nor whatever it may have been, of dear David on the day that\nyou came to White Wood Corner in March. Possibly you may\nnot remember anything. I don't want to remind you of any\ndetails or give you leads. But if you can write anything clearly,\nI want to send it to the tS.P.R.\nMiss Bridgniau replied to this letter as follows :\n^\n4 Sr. Stephen's Road,\nBayswater, W. 2.\n\" I have been asked by my sister, Mrs. Macklin, to write what\nI can remember of what she told me of her dream or vision\non the 27th-28th March this year.\nI can state that these were her words as nearly as possible\n:\n'\nI have a queer feeling about my David this morning. Last\nnight I saw him so clearly, he seemed to come suddenly round\nthe corner of the verandah, rushing, and in a great hurry dashed\npast me. He seemed to be dressed in an ordinary Tommy's\nuniform, with \" tin helmet.\" I said, \" Oh, David, you have done\niMiss Bridgman 's statement, which is not dated, was written in August,\n1918, but by an oversight was not sent to the S.P.R. until November.\n\fJa.v., 1919. Gases. 7\nnothing to disgrace your uniform as an officer.\" He did not\nreply, but disappeared to the right of the front of the bungalow.'\nI went to visit my sister on Thursday, March 28th, and it\nwas the day that I arrived that she told me of her dream.\"'\nH. M. Bridgman.\nIn reply to a further enquiry Mi's. Macklin informed us\nthat she had never had a similar impression or any other\nexperience of psychical interest that she could recall.\nThe statement of the two witnesses may be held to establish\nthe fact that Mrs. Macklin had this experience during the\nnight immediately following the death of her son at the Front\nand before any intimation of his death could possibly have\nreached her by normal means. The experience appears to\nhave been in the nature of an unusually vivid dream. The\nfact that Mrs. Macklin had been in special anxiety about her\nson for some days weakens the evidence, and if the case\nstood alone, we might conclude that the close coincidence in\ntime between the mother's dream and the son's death was\ndue to chance. But since the case belongs to a type con-\ncerning which a large amount of evidence has akeady been\nput on record, it seems likely that the dream originated in\na telepathic impression.\nWith regard to Mrs. Macklin's impression that her son was\nin a private soldier's uniform. Lieut. Macklin's body was never\nrecovered, and since many of those with him have been killed\nit has not been possible to obtain definite information on\nthis point. But it is a common thing for officers when they\ngo into action to be so equipped as to be practically indistin-\nguishable from private soldiers.\nWe are indebted to Mrs. and Miss Macklin for their permis-\nsion to use names.\n11. Coincidental Auditoey Hallucixatiox.\nL. 1221.\nThe following case of apparent telepathy we have received\nthrough the kindness of Mr. F. C. Constable of Wick Court,\nnear Bristol, a Member of the Society. He writes :\nThe two statements and letter given below speak for them-\nselves. Dr. Beavis, IVIrs. S.

SwlNDON, Od. \\7th.\nDear Mr. Constable,\u2014In reply to your note this is as nearly\nas I remember what passed between Mrs. Ashley and myself on\nthe day Arthur met with his accident. I missed him at his\nusual dinner hour, but his mother then told me that he did\nnot always come home at that time. After dinner I retired as\nusual to my little sitting-room and Mrs. Ashley to her duties\nat the back of the house. In about an hour's time I was sur-\nprised to hear her call out, \" Is that you Arty ? \" and getting\nno reply she came into my room saying \" Have you seen any-\nthing of Arthur ?\n\" I said \" No, I have not.\" She then seemed\nvery surprised, saying, \" Well, I heard him call out '\nMa,' (a pet\nname for his mother) as plainly as I have ever heard him, and\nif that was not his voice I have never heard it.\" I remarked\nthat it was very curious, and she then added, \" I hope there's\nnothing the matter with him. '\nSeeing that she was much\nagitated I tried to soothe her and said, \" Oh ! he will be home\nall right presently.\" This was all we said to each other and\nMrs. Ashley then went away, but soon after I heard a knock\nat the door and some one said, \" No answer,\" then I heard\nMrs. Ashley cry out and on going to her to see what had\nhappened she put a letter in my hand which she had just received\nfrom the works telling her of her son's accident. I think this\nis all you will want to know, and hope I have made it plain\nenough. I may add that I have been much impressed by such\na clear premonition ' of the sad event.\n'\u2022\nC. A. DoDl^.\n'Mr. Constable informs us, in reply to enquiries, tbat he has \"not the\nslij^htest doubt [Miss Dodd] used the term 'premonition' merely for 'abnormal\noccurrence.' \"\u2014that is not as implying that Mrs. Ashley's experience preceded\nthe accident. - -\n\fJan., 1919.

It did not arrive,\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. .Tax., 1919.\nSo, after two weeks waitino- there, I prepared to leave for New\nYork. T was living at the Vendome Hotel, where each room-\ndoor contains a plate of ground glass.\nI was seated under a light near the door, when T saw what\nseemed to be the shadow of an arm and hand sweep by the\nglass on the outside. I opened the door, but the corridor was\nempty.\nThen I returned to my seat and took up my book.\nThen a piece of furniture at my right, something like a chest\nof drawers, began to stir and creak, as do articles on a ship\nwhen the waves are high.\nWondering what could cause such a demonstration, I rose and\npushed the furniture aside to ascertain what was causing the\ndisturbance. And there, on the floor, and until then completely\nhidden by that piece of furniture, was the missing letter !\nIt had been pushed under the door by a bell-boy and pushed\nso hard that it had disappeared under the article of furniture.\nBut for the moving and creaking of the furniture my attention\nwould not have been called to it, and I would not have received\nthe letter. I have no explanation to offer ; had not then, nor\nhave I since, made any pretence of looking into \" the Occult\nSciences.\"\nI simply state the incident as it occurred.\nW. A. Whitecar.\nCOREESPONDENCE.\nTo Ihe Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nWiNDLKSHAM, CllOWEOROIJClH,\nSussex, November. 1918.\nDear Madam,- On the morning of April 4th, 1917, I woke\nup with a strong feeling that information of importance had\nbeen conveyed to me in my sleep. I had a feeling also that it\nwas of a consoling nature. I could only remember one word,\nhowever, Piave. It rang in niy liead, Piave ! Piave ! It was\nas though it were .some keyword, and if I could retain that, I\n.should have the essence of the message.\nNo doubt in my reading I mvist have seen the word, and on\nmy visit to the Italian front I had actually passed over the\nriver, but I had retained the names of none of the many streams,\n\fJan., 1919. Correspondence. 11\nsave only the Isonso, upon which the war was at that time\nbeing waged. Thus Piave conveyed nothing to vtxy mind. I\nwas so impressed, however, that I went at once into my study\nand looked up the index of my Atlas. By this reference J\ndiscovered that the name was that of a river about fifty miles\nin the rear of the Italian front, which was at that time victori-\nously advancing. I could imagine few more unlikely things\nthan that the war would be transferred to the Piave. None\nthe less I was so impressed by my dream that I drew up a paj^er\nat once, under the date April 4, 1917, in which I stated that I\nknew some great event of the war would centre on the Piave.\nThis was witnessed that morning by two witnesses. In view of\nmy feeling of elation on waking I took it that this event would\nbe favourable, tho' how a favourable event couid occur fifty miles\nin the rear was more than I could understand.\nIt is a matter of history how six months later the Italian\narmy was driven from its positions. Whilst it was in retreat\nI sent a sealed envelope to the S.P.R. with an account of my\ndream. The army crossed several points, such as the Tagiia-\nmeuto, where a stand seemed probable, and halted eventually\nupon the line of the Piave, which had been said to be un-\ntenable, since it was commanded from the left rear. They were\nstill there in February, 1918, when I was writing my \" New\nRevelation.\" In describing the incident I said, \" If nothing more\nshould occur the reference to the name has been fully justified,\npresuming that some friend in the beyond was forecasting the\ncoming events of the war. 1 have still a hope, however, that\nmore was meant, and that some crowning victory of the Allies\nat this spot may justify still further the strange way in which\nthe name was conveyed to my mind.\" This sentence appeared\nin print in April. 1918.\nIt will be recalled that it was on June 17th, 1918, that the\nfirst battle of the Piave was fought. It was not a great victory,\nbut it was a victory, and it is noteworthy that this date marked\nthe whole turning point of the war. Up to then the Allies had\nin this year sustained three severe defeats, that of the second\nSomme battle, the battle of the Lys, and the second Aisne\nbattle. On June 17th their prospects were very black. From\nthe day of the Piave battle they never looked back again,\nand on every front they had an uninterrupted record of victory,\nculminating, in the case of the Italians, in the second Piave battle,\n\f]2 Journal uf Society for Psychical Research. Jan ,\n1919.\nwhich was the most decisive in the war. Thus in conveying the\nname '\nPiave ' my comforter had given me the keyname which\nwould unlock the whole situation.\nNow how could this be accounted for by coincidence ? That\nis unthinlcable. Even if my subconscious self had known there\nwas a river called the Piave, that would not have shifted the\nItalian army back to it. Was it then telepathy ? But no one in\nthe world could have conjectured such a series of events. What\nthen was it ? I claim that the only possible explanation is that\nmy friends on the other side, knowing how much I worried over\nthe situation, were giving me comfort and knowledge. The\nordinary spirit has, so far as my reading and experience teach\nme, only a very limited and uncertain gift of prophecy. There-\nfore I have some reason to hope that my information came\nfrom a high source. Why I should have been so privileged\nabove others is the one point which is beyond my conjecture.\nArthur Conan Doylk.\n{The sealed letter to which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle refers above\nwas received by the Secretary on November 7, 1917, with a covering\nnote asking that it should be opened only at the writer's request. It\nran as follows :\nWiNDLESHAM, CrOWBOROUGH,\nSussex, November 4, 1917.\nIn the early sumnaer of 1917 I woke from sleep with the word\nPiave in my head, as the culmination of some dream of which\nI could remember nothing. I had no remembrance of the word,\nbut thought vaguely it was a place. The index of an atlas\nshowed me that it was a river some distance behind the Italian\nfront. I drew the attention of my wife and brother-in-law to'\nit that morning, and said something would surely occur there.\nAfterwards the Italians advanced and Piave seemed far in the\nrear. Now the tide has turned, tho' I have not yet seen the\nline of the Piave mentioned. It is always the Tagliamento.\nStill it is worth chronicling and putting into neutral hands.\nA. Conan Doyle.\nThis letter ivas opened and read on November 20, 1918, on re-\nceiving the further communication from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,\nwhich we print above. Eu.]\n\fNos.

Not only has our work been restricted by the\nfact that many of those whom we might have enlisted as\nco-operators in this country have been otherwise engaged, but\nintercourse of any kind with our foreign members, even with\nsuch as were allies or neutrals, has been very difficult. More-\nover, several foreign and British periodicals whose contents\nhave a bearing on our work have been either in abeyance,\nor much reduced. AU these factors have necessarily limited\nour outlook and opportunities for research.\na2\n\u00a321 0 0\n3 3 0\n3 0 0\n2 2 0\n2 2 0\n2 2 0\n1 1 0\n1 1 0\n1 1 0\n1 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 10 6\n0 10 6\n0 10 0\n0 5 0\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb.-Mab., 1919.\nSo far as the membership of the Society is concerned, the\nwar made its influence felt most in 1915, when the net\ndecrease was 96 ; in 1916 it was 31, but in 1917 we were\nable to report a net increase of 62, and in 1918 there has been\na further increase of 68. Fifty-seven new Members have been\nelected, including one Honorary Member, and 4 Associates have\nbecome Members ; 80 new Associates have been elected, and\n7 Members have become Associates. The number of Members\nelected last year was again large in proportion to the number\nof Associates. The losses from death, resignations, and failure\nto renew subscriptions amount to 21 Members and 48 Associates.\nThe total member.ship of the Society now stands at 1215, of\nwhom 348 are Members and 867 Associates.\nThe increase of interest in the Society's work which these\nfigures suggest is also indicated by the large sale of publica-\ntions. In the sales to the general public there has only been\na small increase, the amoimt last year being \u00a340 3s. 3d., as\ncompared with \u00a333 16s. 8d. in. 1917 ; but seeing that these\nsales are for the most part confined to the current volume, and\nthat our recent output has for various reasons been below\nthe average in size, we could hardly expect an increase here.\nWhat is noticeable and encouraging is that the sale of publi-\ncations last year to Members and Associates realised \u00a3104 15s. 9d.\nThis is the largest amount that the Society has ever obtained\nfrom this source in any single year. The previous record was\nreached in 1906, when the amount was \u00a383 12s. 3d. ; the\naverage annual amoujit for the ten years between 1904 and\n1913 was \u00a354 14s. 3d., so that last year's total was ahnost\ntwice our pre-war average. This total was chiefly made up\nby the sale of earlier volumes of Proceedings to those who\nhave recently joined the Society, which implies that our new\nMembers take a serious interest ki the work of the Society,\na fact of good augury for the future.\nIn July the Council decided to print in the Journal a\nstatement calling the attention of Members and Associates\nto the very great increase in the cost of printing and paper,\nwhich, if the average output of Proceedings and Journal was\nto be maiatained, would involve an extra expenditure of about\n\u00a3500 a year. The Council said that they hesitated at such a\ntinie to make a general appeal, but that if any Members or\n\fFeb.-Mab., 1919. Report of the Council for the Year. 19\nAssociates were willing to contribute, their generosity would\nbe much appreciated. The response to this appeal amounts\nalready to about \u00a3130, and donations are stUl being received.\nSeveral contributors have expressed a hope that the Society's\npublications would not be reduced ; some of them have offered\nto make an annual donation so long as the present rate of\nexpenditure continues, and some Associates have intimated their\nwish to become Members from January, 1919, in order that the\nPrmting Fund may benefit by their increased subscriptions.\nThe principal piece of research work carried out last year\nby the Society, as a Society, has been an enquiry into the\ntrance-phenomena of Mrs. Leonard. At the end of 1917, as\nstated in the Annual Report for that year, an agreement was\nentered into with Mrs. Leonard, whereby for a period of\nthree months from the middle of January to the middle of\nApril, 1918, she should give sittings only to persons for whom\nappointments had been made through the Society. It was\nmade a condition of granting these appointments that a\nrecorder approved by the Society should be present at each\nsitting to take notes, and that sitters should so far as possible\npro\\'ide the information necessary for enabling investigators\nto form a judgment upon the value- of the results obtained.\nAll the arrangements for sittings were in the hands of a\nCommittee appointed by the Council for that purpose, and\nMrs. Leonard received a weekly salary for her work. About\neighty sittings were held dm'ing this period. A preliminary\nreport on them is to be read to the Society by the Honorary\nResearch Ofiicer, and it is hoped that a fuller report upon\nthem may be published later.\nIn addition to supposed communications from spirits of a\ntype similar to those obtained through other mediums, sittings\nwith Mrs. Leonard are characterised by a special class of\nphenomena, Imown as \" book-tests,\" in which the communi-\ncator professes some knowledge of passages in books standing\nunopened in shelves in distant rooms. Into these the Society\nis also enquiring, and if the claim of supernormal know-\nledge made in connexion with these tests should be substan-\ntiated, the matter is likely to prove of some importance.\nAlthough the Society no longer has any definite agreement\nwith Mrs. Leonard, it has not lost touch with her. Miss\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb.-Mae., 1919.\nKadclyffe-Hall and Mrs. Troubridge, upon whose report of\ntheir own sittings the determination of the Council to enquire\ninto Mrs. Leonard's phenomena was partly based, are still\nhaving regular sittings of which careful records are kept\n;\nand the Honorary Kesearch Officer, Mrs. Salter, has also had\nsittings from time to time with good results.\nSome of the theoretical problems which are raised by the\nphenomena obtained through Mrs. Leonard and other mediums\nhave been the subject of discussion in the Journal, and\nespecially the question as to how we can account for veridical\ndescriptions given of the personal appearance of supposed\ncommunicators unknown to the medium. The explana-\ntions which have been put forward may be classified\naccording as they postulate a purely telepathic hypo-\nthesis to explain this phenomenon, or account for it by\na theory of quasi-materialisation. Those who adopt the\ntelepathic hypothesis may be further classified according as\nthey suppose the telepathy to be from the sitter, or from\nthe communicator. To this last supposition it has been objected\nthat the descriptions which the medium gives appear to be\nof people as others see them rather than as they appear to\nthemselves ; but in reply the suggestion has been made that the\ntelepathic impressions received by the medium are derived,\nnot from the communicator's conscious self as it existed when\nhe was aUve, but from his whole self, which may have a much\ntruer and profounder knowledge of his body than he ever\npossessed consciously. It has also been pointed out that the\nphenomena observed with mediums do not stand alone, but\nfall into line with other phenomena, such as veridical appari-\ntions of living persons. Sir Oliver Lodge has tentatively\nsuggested that the psychic interaction which appears to take\nplace with matter may take place also with the ether by\nwhich matter is interpenetrated, and that a deeper loiowledge\nthan we at present possess of the properties of ether may\nthrow light upon psychical problems.\nDuring the past year the Society has lost two old and\nvalued supporters by the death of Mrs. Benson, who had\nbeen a member of the Society since the year of its foundation,\n1882, and Bishop Boyd Carpenter, who had been a Vice-\nPresident since 1885, and was President in 1912.\n\fFeb. -Mae., 1919. Report of the Council for the Year. 21\nThe Assistant Secretary, Mrs. Thatcher, resigned in April,\n1918, and considerable difficulty was experienced in finding\nan efficient successor. As a consequence much extra work\nwas thrown on the Secretary, Miss Newton, who was without\nadequate assistance for a considerable period. The Council\nwishes to place on record their appreciation of the manner in\nwhich Miss Newton surmounted the resultant difficulties and\nsuccessfully carried out the work of the Office.\nThe financial position of the Society is on the whole satis-\nfactory, though not so favourable as the Balance Sheet might,\nperhaps, suggest. It is true that the General Fund has been\nable to repay \u00a3100 borrowed from the Endowment Fund,\nand also to transfer to the Endowment Fund the balance\n(\u00a3200) of Mrs. Verrall's legacy of \u00a3500. But the Society's\nIncome was augmented during 1918 in an exceptional manner\nby [a] donations to the Printing Fund amounting to \u00a3114 10s. 6d.,\n(6) by an unusually large number of Life Membership and\nLife Associateship payments, and (c) by an unusually large\nsale of back numbers of the Proceedmgs. Of these three\nsources of income, two at any rate, (6) and (c), are not\nlikely to continue to be as productive as in the past year.\nMoreover, a far heavier expenditure for printing than that\nshown in the accounts was incurred during 1918, and a further\npayment of about \u00a3500 will have to be made to the printers\nearly in 1919.\nTwo Parts of Proceedings were published last year, Part\nLXXV. in July and Part LXXVI. in November.\nThe number of meetings held during the year was four.\nOn January 31st, at a Private Meeting, Miss Radclyffe-Hall\nread the first part of a paper by Mrs. Troubridge and herself\non \"A Series of Sittings with Mrs. Leonard.\"\nOn March 22nd, at a General Meeting, Miss Iladclyffe-Hall\nread the second part of the paper described above.\nOn July 5th, at a General Meetuig, Dr. T. W. Mitchell read\na paper on \" The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality.\"\nOn November 15th, at a General Meeting, Sir Oliver Lodge\nspoke on \" Ether and Matter, and their possible Psychical\nBearings.\"\nIt is hoped that the two papers mentioned abo-ve will be\npublished later in Proceedings.\n\fo\n1-t Oi CO\nTO c: CO\nu'^OOO'-'OCOOOOlOOO^CO'-C'OOCO\nT\u2014t T\u2014I I\u2014\nI\nCO O O O '-'^ ^ <C O X CO O 1\u2014< li'j CD\n\" tH i-Hr-Hi-H Cld\no CO o OO'-O\nr-l\n3 00 OOt-\nCi O O CO\nI r-t o o\nCl C 1 ^\nO \u2022\ng o \u00a3\n3\nPL,\nto\np c3\ne^a3\nGOT\u2014 flJSOjOt:'\nPi\n\u2014 j_i a; w \u2014\na\n2 2 g\n0 CO\n0 0 I>\ntH\n0 * (M\n0 01\nCO 0 CO CO\ncf of\n3\n00\n00\n00\nCI ^\no\no\no\nOr:\nO C3\nJ, 5 V- '-'\n_ 55 ~ I\n;\no gx)Hpq\n, 4) o c:\nJ:-\n\u2014\n|o..\nSa\no\n00 -a \"\n-I a-<\nOJ c3 \u2022\nCO 3 c S\n05 5\nSo J='\u00b0\nfi g-\u00ab S 2i\nSs\"^3\n\"3\nm\n0 lO o^ooo 000a; 00 0 0\nCl ooi 0 1-H 0 0 0 I>\n1-t .\u20141 ( 1\u20141 \u201e r-f r-t T-H i-H\n0 0 i-H lO 01 (M 0 T-f CI\nCl I> CO CO CO ^ i-l Cl T-\" CO Cl\nCO 10 CO C<I CO\n<*J\nof oT\nSo\nI O :\nC*J 3\nr- Cl 00000\n0 Cl Cl 0 0 Cl\n-T- C] Cl Cl 0\ni.o o o\nf\u00bb \u2014\n<\n-< O CO c;\nrf o m 01 O 01 c: Cl\neg.\" ^^^^^\n3 >> \u2014\ni-H .-H W ^ Cl\no o c: o\nCl CO o\n1.0 CO Cl\n,2 <;\nc ^\n'4MB\ns o 1^ r :\nH ;\nra'-g 2 g =\n^ i o\n^ O C\ngo o 32\n\"\u2022^s 3 \u00ab\nCCKOOr-,\n\u00b0 3\nC 3\n3 .\nC\n^ 3\n\fis\n2\nIh \" O\na)r--a go\ns 0) = <B\nin\no\n,\no\no\no\nr\/2\n3\n0\n2 \" 5 e4\nH\no S ^' '5 .

Feb.-Mak., 1919.\nPERSONAL APPEARANCE OF THE DEPARTED.\nBy Dr. L. P. Jacks.\nIn a previous communication I pointed out that these appear-\nances, as described by mediums, seem to indicate not such\nknowledge as a person would have of what he looks (or\nlooked) like, but rather the view of an external observer.\nThey suggest the public view of his appearance and character\nas distinct from any -private view or estimate he may have\nformed of himself. If I may be allowed so ugly a word, the\ndistinction may be otherwise expressed by saying that they\nhave all the marks of being ^etero-biographical and not auto-\nbiographical. From this I inferred the likelihood that these\ndescriptions are derived telepathically from the mind of some\nperson (most frequently the sitter) who remembers, either\nconsciously or subconsciously, the outside or public view\nof the departed as he apjDcared during life.\nIn spite of what has been written by Sir Oliver Lodge,\nDr. Schiller, Professor Hyslop and Miss Sellers, this still seems\nto me the least difficult explanation, though I would not\ndeny that it has difficulties of its own. If, on the other\nhand, I am to view these appearances as autobiographical\nor 6eZ\/\"-painted likenesses, I find them both physically and\npsychologically unintelligible, and I can then account for them\nonly by supposing that spirits possess the power of working\nwhat must be called a miracle. Miss Sellers seems to make\nthe same supposition when she suggests that spirits \" have the\ninherent power to be in appearance what they thmk themselves\nto be.\" This I should say would be miraculous in the same\nsense that a power to increase my height by thinking myself\na cubit taller than I am would be miraculous. But is this\na scientific mode of explanation 1 If the spirits may be credited\nwith an \"inherent power\" to do whatever they are alleged\nto do, there would be no end to the claims on our credulity.\nUntil we have made up our minds on that point it is\nuseless to discuss the present question. How far may we\nascribe to spirits the power to perform feats which are\nimpossible to human agency under the known conditions, mental\nNor would it serve tlie purpose of recognition. If we are to be recognised by\nour friends we must \"build up\" as they think us and not as we think ourselves.\n\fFeb.-Mah., 1919. Personal Appearance of the Departed. 25\nand physical, of this life 1 I observe in many quarters a\nstrong tendency to do so, and it seems to me to require\ncriticism. Thus, in the case of a haunted house with which\nI had something to do, a door which was so bolted and\nbarred as to be absolutely unshakable by any human force\nwas alleged to have been violently shaken by the spirit. I\nargued thus : this door is unshakable\u2014but it is alleged to\nhave been shaken\u2014^therefore there is something wrong with\nthe evidence. The witness argued in a very different way\n:\nthis door is unshakable\u2014-but it has been shaken\u2014therefore\na spirit must have shaken it. The witness believed with\nMiss Sellers that spirits have an inherent power to do this\nkind of thing, and the more I urged the impossibility of\nthe thing the more convinced he became that a spirit had\ndone it. Which of these two is the right attitude of mind\nfor the psychical researcher ? The bearing of the point on\nthe present question is obvious. A spirit in the example\nbefore us produced a back view of its former bodily appearance\n\u2014painted his own portrait, as it were, from behind. Does\nthe normal impossibility (or next to impossibility) of doing\nthis indicate something m'ong with the evidence 1 Or does\nit increase the probability that a '\nspiritual ' agency has been\nat work ?\nFrom the general tenor of his paper I gather that Sir\nOliver Lodge would support my own attitude in this matter.\nInstead of appealing to a thaumaturgic power as the cause\nof these phenomena he endeavours, in the true scientific\nspirit, to correlate them with known facts. His argument\nis that the bodily appearance of the departed \u2022 is an instance\nof the normal process by which mind unconsciously builds\nup a body conformable to itself. On the general theory\nthat our bodies are thus moulded and made what they are\nby the mind I am entirely at one with him. But I doubt\nif this theory can be made to cover the facts now before\nus. For what the spirits ap|)arently do is not to manifest\nthemselves in the bodies they now possess, but to manifest\nthemselves in the bodies they formerly possessed\u2014^their age\nas it was, their dress as it ivas, even their hair brushed as\nit ivas. All this is clearly '\nout of the picture ' to which\nSir Oliver refers, and seems rather a breach of the theory\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb. -Mar., 1919.\nthan an instance of it. On the lines of the theory I should\nexpect my departed friend to manifest himself as he had\nbecome in the meantime ; instead of which he manifests as\nhe was a long time ago, with his old suit on and his age\nunchanged. Thus, though I agree that our normal minds\nhave what Sir Oliver calls a materializing faculty, I would\ninsist that they have no power of returning to their former\nmaterializations.\nNot, at least, in our waking experience. In dreams it\nis different, and I think Miss Sellers has done a service to\nthe discussion by reminding us that in certain dreams we\ngo hacli to our former selves and appear in self knowledge as\nwe were at earlier points of our existence. And I agree with\nMiss Sellers that the study of dreams would throw light on\nthis question of personal appearance\u2014and not on it alone\nbut on the whole group of phenomena with which it is\nassociated. I am not sme, however, that the result of such\na study would be favourable to the survival hypothesis. It\nmight be. At present I am strongly inclining to the belief\nthat in dreams we are all telepathists ; the dream cited by\nMiss Sellers, in which she seemed to herself to be another\nperson, suggesting to my mind that she was tapping somebody\nelse's experience.\nI pass on to the question of names. In the particular\ncase to which I referred, I had been struck by the fact that\na spirit who manifested his former personal appearance with\ngreat accuracy, even to minute details, was yet apparently\nunable to manifest his name, except in an imperfect and\ndoubtful manner. It seemed to me an odd thing that one\nwho could build himself up, clothes and all, and even indicate\npeculiarities in his appearance which could only be seen from\nbehind, should yet be unable to find the sound of his name,\nor to trace the letters of it, which his hand must have traced\nthousands of times on earth and which his eyes must have\nseen thousands of times after they had been traced. Dr.\nSchnier truly remarks that we do not usually think of ourselves\nby name, or at least that the knowledge of our name has\nvery little to do with our self-consciousness. But I should\nsay that our back-view has still less. As to clothes, people\ndiffer ; but I am very sure that my friend of the seance\n\fPeb.-Mar., 1919. Personal Appearance of the Departed. 27\nwhen on this earth was as far from thinking of himself in\nterms of his old coat as he was from identifying himself\nwith the somid or letters of his name. Yet the coat was\nmanifested and the name was not. On the other hand, our\nnames, while imessential to our self-consciousness, do play\na prominent part in our sensible experience, especially with\nthose of us who are cursed by an iatermxinable correspondence,\nand one would think that a mind returning on its old tracks,\nas Sir Oliver Lodge suggests the spirits do, would find his\nname one of the easiest things to pick out.\nAll this, however, can be retorted upon the hypothesis\nof telepathy, as both Dr. Schiller and Miss Sellers have been\nprompt to see. If the medium got the back-view of my\nfriend, and his old coat, telepathically from me, why did\nshe fail to get his name also ? It is a choice between diflS.-\nculties. On the survival hypothesis you have a departed\nspirit who has kept touch with his coat but lost touch with\nhis name ; on the other hypothesis you have a telepathist\nwho gets his coat from me but fails to get the nama It is\nnot easy to decide on which side the difficulties preponderate.\nOn the whole, however, I am inclined to think that they\nare Lighter for the hypothesis of telepathy. It is easier to\nunderstand how a telepathist. haviag succeeded in reading\none part of my mind, should fail or omit to read another,\nthan it is to understand how an educated man, in the other\nlife, should be able to reproduce his coat but unable to trace\nthe letters of his own name. Even when telepathy is known\nto take place it is never claimed, I believe, that the whole\ncontents of the subject's mind lie open to the telepathist.\nNor is the telepathist discredited because, after reading one\nof my thoughts correctly, he has failed to read another. It is\nas though I had accused a person of stealing my watch and\nthe defence were set up that he could not have stolen my\nwatch because he didn't steal something else which was in\nthe same pocket.\nSir Oliver Lodge suggests that I have no right to speak of\nthe spirit forgetting its name, and that what I take to be\nthis is probably due to the failure of the control to \" catch\n\"\nthe name which the spirit has correctly given. In the case\nto which I was referring, I doubt if this can be accepted : all\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb. -Mar., i919\nthe signs indicated that the failure was in the communicating\nspirit. But even if we do accept Sir Oliver's view, the result\nis merely to shift the difficulty from the spirit to the control.\nWhy, if the control can \" catch \" and reproduce long messages\nor sentences given by the spirit, should she be unable to\n\" catch \" the name in spite of the effort of all parties to get\nit through 1 Sir Oliver agrees with Dr. Schiller as to the\nunimportance of our names to our self-consciousness, the\nsuggestion being, I suppose, that spirits are not interested\nin their names. And yet, whether successfully or not, they\napparently make great efforts to get them through both by\nspelling and by sound. And naturally so ; for however unim-\nportant names may be in the psychology of self-consciousness\nthey are an important means of identification, and would\ninevitably be made use of by an intelligent spirit interested\nin getting itself identified by the sitter. He would use not\nonly his own name, but the names of those he remembered\nor was addressing\u2014-and apparently does so, when he can.\nI think^ that both Sir Oliver and Dr. Schiller show at this\npoint the disposition to draw a metaphysical herring across\nthe track. It is a very good herring but has no business\nhere.\nSir Oliver suggests further that I err in regarding the personal\nappearances as consciously enacted by the spirits on the basis\nof consciouslij remembered data ; and thinks that the diffi-\nculties I have indicated would disappear if we refer the pheno-\nmena to subconscious activities. Well, I am perfectly willing\nto translate the whole argument into subconscious terms, but\nI cannot see how this would ease the difficulty. The old\nquestion recurs in precisely the same form. If the spirit, by\nmeans of some subconscious activity, can produce a likeness\nor quasi-material embodiment of its former presence, including\nthe clothes it wore, why cannot it also, by means of the\nsame subconscious activity, produce a lUceness or quasi-material\nembodiment of its former name ? Why again, if subconscious\nactivities enable it to recover its former language and to speak\nit with fluency, should they not enable it to recover the one\nspoken and written word with which it was most familiar 1\nAre we to suppose that the realms of subconsciousness are\nreceptive to such things as a clean-shaven face and a tweed\n\fFeb. -Mae., 1919. Personal Appearance of the Departed. 29\nsuit (botli of which were \" built up \" on the occasion in\nquestion) and language in general, but intolerant of proper\nnames ? I see no reason to suppose anything of the kind.\nRecurring to the hypothesis of telepathy, Sir Oliver puts\nthe following case and asks whether I would regard it as a\ncrucial test\n;\n\" Suppose a perfectly unknown person is being described, one\nwhom the sitter has never seen ; and suppose he is ultimately\ntold to take messages from this stranger to a friend or\nacquaintance ; and suppose that on taking the message, and\nshowing the description, it is recognized as correctly repre-\nsenting the recipient's memory of the communicator.\"\nI have heard of several such cases and believe them to be\nwell-authenticated. Would telepathy cover them ?\nI can only give a hypothetical answer, for the simple reason\nthat I do not know, and am not aware that anybody knows\nwhat the range of telepathy is. The hypothetical answer\nwould be as follows :\n(1) If it were conclusively proved that telepathy is une\naffaire a deux, that is, always limited to the telepathist and\nthe person on whom he is immediately operating, then clearly\nthe case supposed is a crucial one and telepathy is ruled out.\n(2) But telepathy is not necessarily limited to two persons.\nIt may conceivably work through a network of centres\u2014all\nof them doubtless in the subconscious realm. Thus the\ntelepathist who taps my mind may through my mind have\naccess to the mind of my friend, and through his to that of\na third person, and so on. By the entry gained into one\nmind the telei)athist might in fact be able to read a whole\ngroup of minds with which the first is in some sort of relation.\nNothing of the kind, so far as I know, has been proved ; but\nneither do I know that it has been disproved, nor of any\nreason that renders it antecedently impossible. If this long-\nrange telepathy exists the case supposed is not a crucial one\nand telepathy is not ruled out.\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJi. Feb. -Mae., 1919.\nCASE.\nL. 1222. Auditory.\nThe following case is a good specimen of a sensory halluci-\nnation concerning a person which preceded by a short time\nthe unexpected arrival of that person. Several such cases\nwill be found in Phantasms of the Living and elsewhere, in the\nSociety's publications. Assuming that we can rule out chance,\nthe presumption is that the hallucination is due to a telepathic\nimpulse from the person on the point of arriving.\nWe arQ indebted for the first account we received of this\ncase to Miss E. Arkwright, who wrote as follows from Bourne-\nmouth :\nOn Tuesday, January 8, (at Grrange-over-Sands, Lanes), Mr.\nSaunders (a retired gardener of ours) heard a message (Mr. Saunders\nhas a grandson at the front called Tom). The message is this,\nthat Saunders heard \" Tom is coming to-day.\" Saunders was\nwide awake (about 7.30 in the morning), and had been for some\ntime. He looked round to see who it was speaking ; and there\nwas no one to be seen. If the message had not been uttered\nloudly Saunders would not have heard, as he is extremely deaf.\nWhen he went down to breakfast he told the incident to his\nfamily. They chaffed him and said he must have been dreaming.\nAfter brealcfast (at 9 o'clock) when Saunders was washing up the\nbreakfast things in walked the said Tom.\nOn January 7th they received a printed card from Tom from\nFrance to say he was very well and a letter would follow. His\nleave was quite unexpected. The message Saunders received was\non the following day, January 8th.\nAs our correspondent was unknown to us and had omitted\nto give her name, we asked Mr. RoUeston Walker, an associate\nof the Society living at Bournemouth, if he could find out\nmore for us. This he has very kindly done. He saw Miss\nE. Arkwright, who gave him a very satisfactory account of\nthe percipient, \" a most reliable, a matter-of-fact person.\"\nShe also put him in communication with her Aunt, Miss S. M.\nArkwright, at Grange-over-Sands, from whom she first heard\nthe story. To the latter lady he sent a note of points on\nwhich information was desired, and she was good enough to\ncall on the family of Mr. Saunders, who were known to her.\n\fFeb. -Mar., 1919. Case. 31\nFinding him absent she left a request for a written account\nof his experience, with the following notes of points to be\ndealt with.\n1. A signed statement from one or more of the persons to whom\nSaunders described his [experience] before the arrival of his\ngrandson.\n2. A statement as to the time of the son's arrival and its\nunexpectedness.\n3. Whether Saunders has ever had a similar experience, visual,\nauditory, or otherwise.\n4. The state of Saunders's health before and after the incident.\n5. His age.\n6. A confirmatory letter from Tom of the incident.\nIn reply she received the following statements from Mr.\nSaunders and his granddaughter :\nOn the eighth of January about 7 a.m. I heard four words\ndistinctly as I lay in bed: \"Tom's coming to-day.\" I asked\nMaud and her mother if either had been in the room. They\nanswered in the negative. I told them what I had heard. They\nthought I must have been dreaming. There it ended till the\nunexpected Tom turned up between 9 and 10 a.m. on the same\nday.\nMy health was good at the time, before and after.

Feb.-Mae., 1919.\nIt will be seen that Mr. Saunders has not answered the\nimportant question whether he has ever had other similar\nexperiences. Perhaps the meaning of the question as it\nstands was not very clear to him. If auditory hallucinations\nwere frequently experienced by him the evidential vahie of\nthe coincidence would of course be materially diminished. It\nseems probable, however, from the evidence before us that\nthe experience was at least rare and striking if not unique.\nAfter some time, no answer reaching her from '\nTom,'\nMiss S. M. Aikwright called on the Saunders family again,\nand learnt that a letter had been received from him but lost\nor mislaid. Miss Maud Saunders writes on January 13, 1919 :\nMy brother Tom, when we wrote to ask him if he remembered\nthe incident, said he remembered it quite well and only wished\nit had occurred again, but his letter is not to hand; so cannot\nsend it on to you. M. Saunders.\nCOERESPONDENCE.\nI. EFFECT OF LIGHT ON LONG ETHER WAVES AND\nOTHER PROCESSES.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nA curious and imi^ortant observation, made on the basis of\nexperience in long-distance wireless telegraphy, exhibits a strange\nkind of interference between ether waves of very different lengths.\nThe extremely short waves which ionise air interfere with the\neasy transmission of the long waves which are originated by\nalternating electric currents, and may conceivably have something\nto do with the optical opacity of dry haze.\nThis is an entirely different effect from the purely localised\nbands of interference which accompany the superjaosition of wave\nmotions and are a matter of simple geometry. In this phenomenon\nof interferenceJ^ands there is no destruction, only re-distribution,\nof energy ; and there is nothing akin to opacity whether of\nthe absorbent or of the reflective kind. It is moreover purely\nan affair of the ether : whereas opacity is always an effect brought\nabout by the presence of matter in the path of ether waves.\nThe ions or electrons which are liberated from matter by exceed-\ningly short waves raise a barrier or act as a reflector to extremely\nlong ones. Thus the phenomenon depends on the interaction\n\fFeb.-Mak., 1919. Gorrespon dence. 33\nbetween free ether and electrified particles immersed in it. So\nfar I have recently written to Nature, in connexion with a project\nfor observing the effect of the forthcoming solar eclipse of May\n29th on Wireless Telegraphy in the region of totality between\nBrazil and the Gulf of Guinea. I now continue on a different\ntheme.\nIt has been customary among non-physical writers to claim\nwireless telegraphy as analogous to telepathy\u2014as if that too were\nlikely to be a travelling physical process transmitted by the\nether at a definite pace. There is no evidence in favour of\nsuch a proposition, and the analogy between telepathy and wireless\ntelegraphy is merely popular and superficial. If telepathy were\nshown to vary as the inverse square of the distance, if it were\ninterrupted by metallic screens, even if it were obstructed by\nlight or by transition from light to dark between sending and\nreceiving stations,\u2014these facts would be relevant. But I know\nof no such facts.\nAn obstructive influence of light has always been asserted in\nconnexion with certain phenomena, it is true, and the consistent\ncharacter of this testimony is worthy of attention : but these\nphenomena have been always of the psycho-physical order-\nmaterialisations let us say, or direct voice, or movement of objects\nwithout contact\u2014 and never, so far as I remember, has any luminous\nobstruction been asserted for purely psychical phenomena such as\nI at present believe telepathy to be.\nIf it be true, however, that light really does interfere with what\nare technically known as \" physical phenomena, that fact is\nclearly important,\u2014for here we are dealing with Avhat must be\n2>artly a physical process and which if genuine .seems likely to be\nat least an interaction between ether and matter. So it may be\nthat either the etherial quiver known as light, or else the residual\nionised jKoduct of rapid ether waves, does exert some definite\nphysical influence inimical to the ready exertion of the material\nforces or manipulations necessary.\nIt becomes important, and it would seem comparatively easy,\nto ascertain whether still more rapid etherial oscillations, too rapid\nto affect the eye but exceedingly effective in ionising power,\nsuch as X-rays for instance, would also exert a detrimental\ninfluence, in a room otherwise and optically \" dark.\" Not\nnecessarily perfectly dark\u2014for since the longer waves of red light,\nwhich are known to have less ionising power, do not appear to\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb. -Mar., 1919.\nbe seriously hostile to physical phenomena, there would be evi-\ndential advantage in employing such illumination as usual.\nIf this country possessed a psychical laboratory, such as will\nsome day no doubt be established, or if Dr. Crawford could\ncontinue his researches at Belfast, the influence of X-rays coming\nthrough a thin aluminium partition into the operating room\n\u2014\nsuch rays being preferably put on or off at times unknown to\nthose present, so as to minimise the effect of suggestion,\u2014the\nexperiment would be well worth making. For a physical pheno-\nmenon, even a psycho-physical phenomenon, must have physical\nconcomitants ; and the investigation of these would be sure sooner\nor later to throw light on the mechanism of the at present barely\ncredible phenomena themselves, and determine their relationship\nin the orthodox physical family from which hitherto they have\nbeen too arbitrarily and ignominiously extruded.\nOliver J. Lodge.\nII. TBLERGY.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R\nThere has been some criticism, most courteous in form, of\nmy use of the word '\ntelergy '\nin a little book I have written.\nI think, then, it is but just I should be allowed to explain why\nI have so used the term : I beheve I have followed Myers'\nfootsteps directly.\nIn his great work on Huntan Personality he defines telergy\nas :\n\" The force exercised by the mind of an agent in impressing\na percipient\u2014involving a direct influence of an extraneous spirit\non the brain or organism of the percipient.\" How does he himself\ninterpret this definition ?\nOn page 197 of the same work he says telergy is a kind of\ncorrelative to telepathy. He says also :\n\" This action on the\nphysical brain may be due either to the percipient's own spirit\nor subliminal self, or else directly to the agent's spirit.\"\nOn page 526 he says \" That law (that spirits should influence\nmen) is the direct transmission of thought and emotion from\nmind to mind and the telergy\u2014to use here a word more active\nin its connotation than telepathy\u2014the telergy by which this\ntransmission is effected may be as imiversally diffused in the\nmetatherial world as heat in the material.\"\nThese statements of Myers, I think, show that he meant the\nword inoolving to be used in its ordinary sense not as meaning\n\fFeb. -Mar., 1919. Correspondence. 35\n'\ninvolving in every case.' If he meant the word involving to\nbe used as '\ninvolving in every case,' then, in his own great work,\nhe misused his own definition. F. C.

DREAM-ANALYSIS.\nTo the Editor of the Journal op the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014Students of Freud and Jung will have read\nMiss Johnson's article on Dream-Analysis in Part LXXV. of the\nProceedings with very great interest, and those who know Miss\nJohnson's work on behalf of the Society will not fail to be im-\npressed by the results. Even these, however, I venture to think,\nwill wonder whether the quality of dream-analysis is not strained\nwhen the solution does not drop dew-like into consciousness\nspontaneously.\nFor example (page 70), Miss Johnson says, (a) \" For a long\ntime I tried in vain to think of any other associations ; at last\nit occurred to me ; ... ,\" and (&) (page 82) \" when about\nfour months later I got the book again and read it carefully\n(in connection with another dream), I foimd to my surprise that\nAristophanes' primeval man was behind this dream also.\"\nIs it a legitimate process in dream-analysis to try and think\nof associations ? Can one reaUy be sure of distinguishing the\nspontaneous acquiescence felt to the connection of a memory mth\na dream incident, on waiving or in Freud's quiescent state, and\nthe feeUng of aptness residtant upon finding an associable idea\nin the course of one's reading afterwards ? Supposing in case\n(6) above, Miss Johnson had, in the course of her reading after\nthe dream, happed upon the story of Troy and the Wooden\nHorse, how would this have fitted in with the Rocking Horse\ndream ? There is a certain relevancy to the dream : the busy\nswarm of bees issuing from Samson's lion, Aristeus' ox, and the\nsoldiers pouring from the hollow horse.\nAgain in the Tableau Vivant dream, from the account of\nwhich (a) is taken, it seems to me, if I may venture to say so,\nthere seems to be a strong association with \" Alice through the\nLooking Glass \"\n;\nespecially if the brightly coloured dress of the\nhappy wife was red : I mean Alice with the Red and White\nQueens. The latter was of a distinctly hypochondriacal if not\nunhappy disposition, and the incident is largely connected with\nher cloak, which finally came off and blew away.\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. v-rh.-Uaw., itno.\nOf course this may have occurred to Miss Johnson and failed\nto awaken the necessary subliminal sense of approjjriateness.\nThe fact that the flat-faced dolls faced one another in the\ndoll dream while the dreamer was able to see their faces is of\ncourse quite possible in dreams, nevertheless it suggests a touch\nof \" secondary elaboration '\"\nin the actual outlining of the dream.\nThat \" '\nletters '\nsuggest literature and hence that a literary origin\nis to be looked for is not quite convincing, especially as the\nletters are so clearly assignable to the recent visit to the oculist.\nBut waiving the above criticisms\u2014the results obtained have\nperhaps an important significance in connection with the sugges-\ntion made by Miss May Sinclair in the Journal for May-June,\n1917 '\n: that the cross-correspondences may be traceable to sub-\nconscious desire on the part of the automatists (or an auto-\nmatist) to produce script of this kind. Here we have proofs\nthat Miss Johnson's subconscious self has been very busy corre-\nlating the ideas both manifest and latent in the old scripts, and\nthat they do not emerge full-fledged into her waking mind on\nanalysis, but some later than others. If we adopt Freud's\nnomenclature and suppose that some of the ideas (familiar now\nto readers of the Proceedings) were telepathically conveyed by an\nautomatist X, to A from the Unconscious, and others to B\nfrom the Pre-conscious (assuming that they (such ideas) do pass\nfrom the former to the latter on their way to Consciousness),\nand assuming further that in the absence of the analytical nisus\nthey do not reach consciousness at all\u2014if this is assumed, scripts\nproduced would have a purely living source, would perforce show\nthe complementary character, and no one would necessarily know\nwhence they originated.\nThe strength of Freud's theory is that it affords an explanation\nof the strange predilection of the subconscious for veiling its\nmessage in this inexplicable way. If it has a meaning it is not\nashamed of, why wrap it w.]) in symbolism '? If symbolism is,\nlike the appendix and tonsils, a rudiment of a bygone method\nof fimctioning, why should not the supraliminal have inherited\nthe faculty of interpreting its messages or \" ruminations \" ?\nErnest E.

Apparition at the Time of Death.\nL. 1223.\nWe owe the following case in the first instance to Mr. Hubert\nWales, who has been a Member of the Society for several\nyears and kindly undertook to collect the necessary evidence.\nIts special interest lies in the fact that some intimation of\nthe death of an officer in action appears to have been received\nin three different quarters at about the time of his death\nor very shortly afterwards, before any normal knowledge of\nwhat had occurred could have reached those concerned. The\nofficer in question was Captain Bowyer-Bower, and the following\nnotice of his death appeared in the Cotirt Journal of June 1,\n1917 :\nBowYER-BowER.\u2014Previously reported missing, now reported\nkilled in action on March 19th, Bldred Wolferstan Bowyer-Bower,\nCaptain the East Surrey Regiment and R.F.C., son of Captain\nand Mrs. T. Bowyer-Bower, of 30, Bramham Gardens, S.W., and\nof Ashanti, and grandson of the late Major-Ceneral Henry Bower,\naged twenty-two years. (Captain Bower's body, beside his\nberiddled plane, was found and recovered by his own father on\nMay 10th.) No mourning.\nIt appears from information received by Captain Bowyer-\nBower's mother (see below) that his death occurred in the\nearly morning.\n1. The most remarkable of the experiences which have\nbeen reported to us was an apparition of Captain Bowyer-\nBower which was seen by his half-sister Mrs. Spearman in\nIndia, within a few hours of his death. Mrs. Spearman's\noriginal report of her experience was obtained under the\nfollowing circumstances.\nShortly after Captain Bowyer-Bower's death, his fiancee,\nMiss Highett, had a sitting with a professional medimn, Mrs.\nBrittaiu, at which a statement was made which Mrs. Highett\nreports thus in a letter to Mr. Wales :\nWed. mil June [1918].\nI wish to tell you that Mrs. Brittain was quite a stranger to\nCaptain and Mrs. Bower and me. My interview with her took\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apkil, 1919.\nplace on September 29th, 1917. After telling me many things\nabout Mrs. Bower's son she said, \" He has a sister.\" I said,\n\"Yes, Cicely.\" She said, \"No, that's not the name.\" She\nwaited a few seconds and then said :\n\" Joan. She has a little\ngirl called Joan, now I get Dorothy.\" I said, \" Yes.\" He\nsays, \" Tell Dorothy she has the power to communicate.\" He\nalso said, \" She is not in this country.\" ^Eta Highett.\nMrs. Bowyer-Bower wrote to her step-daughter, Mrs. Dorothy\nSpearman (Captain Bower's half-sister) in India, with refer-\nence to the statements made to Miss Highett at this sitting.\nThe following passage is extracted from Mrs. Spearman's reply :\nCalcutta,\n2 Jan., 1918.\n. . . Now I have never told you this before because I was\nafraid you would not understand. Eldred was greatly on my\nmind when baby was born, and I could only think of him. On\nMarch 19th, in the late part of the morning, I was sewing and\ntalking to baby, Joan was in the sitting-room and did not see\nanything. I had a great feeling I must turn round and did,\nto see Eldred ; he looked so happy and that dear mischievous\nlook. I was so glad to see him, and told him I would just put\nbaby in a safer place, then we could talk. \" Fancy coming\nout here,\" I said, turning roimd again, and was just putting\nmy hands out to give him a hug and a kiss, but Eldred had\ngone. I called and looked for him. I never saw him again.\nAt first [I] thought it was simply my brain. Then I did think\nfor a second something must have happened to him and a terrible\nfear came over me. Then again I thought how stupid I was,\nand it must be my brain playing tricks. But now I know it\nwas Eldred, and all the time in Church at baby's christening\nhe was there, because I felt he was and know he was, only I\ncould not see him. All the time I thought why do I fee] like\nthis when Eldred is safe. And Mrs. K kept on telling me\nto look more cheerful ...\nMrs. Bowyer-Bower states that Mrs. Spearman was at a\nhotel in Calcutta at the time referred to in the above .extract,\nand in a letter to Mr. Wales she says :\nmh May, 1918.\n. . . The little boy whose Christening is mentioned was to have\nbeen his godson and the day he was baptized Eldred fell. Dolly\n\fApril, 1919, Gases. 41\n[Mrs. Spearman] did not of course know of Eldred's death, or\neven that he was out in France again, as he had been home\nseveral months and [had] only returned there three weeks when\nkiUed ...\nIn reply to a question addressed to her by Mrs. Bowyer-\nBower as to whether she had informed any one of her ex-\nperience before she knew of Captain Bowyer-Bower's death,\nMrs. Spearman wrote thus :\nDarjeeling,\nAugust 3rd, [1918].\n... I can only tell him [Mr. Wales] I saw Eldred, and, Peggy,\nI shall never forget the joy that went through me or the horror\nwhen I looked and called and could not find him or make him\nhear. No, I did not tell any one before I heard of his death\nand have not up to now. I did not tell Alec^ because I knew\nhe did not beUeve as I did. When I told him how Mrs. B\nsaw the W boy, Alec said it must have been a dream. One\nday Alec said, I wonder if any one has seen Eldred, and I said\nyes I have, and I explained what I saw and how I felt, and\nwhen I went to the Grand we took the same rooms and I showed\nhim where Alley stood. He now believes we can see those who\nhave gone. His belief is the same as my own. If Alec had\nbeen with me at the time. I would have called out to him and\nasked if he had seen Eldred, was he in the sitting-room. I only\nknew the K s in Calcutta, and often when I spoke to them\nthey would laugh. So I never said a word about Alley. In\nfact I thought it might be my own madness. I started a letter\nto you the same day and tore it up as I thought you would\nonly say it was cracked. . . .\nSubsequently a further statement concerning her experience\nwas obtaiaed from Mrs. Spearman in a letter to Mr. Wales,\nas foUows :\n12 Jan. 1919.\nMy step-mother Mrs. Bowyer-Bower asked me to write to you\nabout the vision I had of my brother.\nMy brother appeared to me on the 19th March, 1917. At the\ntime I was either sewing or talking to my baby, I carmot\nremember quite what I was doing at that moment. The baby\nwas on the bed.\nI had a very strong feehng I must turn round ; on doing so,\n1 Mrs. Sijearruan's husband.\n\f42 Joumcd of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil, 1919.\nI saw my brother Eldred W Bowyer-Bower. Thinking he was\nalive and had been sent out to India, I was simply delighted\nto see him, and turned round quickly to put baby in a safe\nplace on the bed, so that I could go on talking to my brother\n;\nthen turned again and put my hand out to him, when T found\nhe was not there. I thought he is only joking, so I called him\nand looked everywhere I could think of looking. It was only\nwhen I could not find him I became very frightened and the\nawful fear that he might be dead. I felt very sick and giddy.\nI think it was 2 o'clock the baby was christened, and in the\nchurch I felt he was there, but I could not see him. Two weeks\nlater I saw in the paper he was missing. Yet I could not bring\nmyself to believe he had passed away. I did fancy once I saw\nmy grandmother, but she seemed very misty, so it may have\nbeen fancy.\nI did not tell any one of the vision I saw of my brother for\nquite 1 or 2 months after I heard of his death, as I was\nstaying in the Grand Hotel, Clalcutta, and did not know anyone\nthere very well. My husband was not with me and I did not\nwrite to him about it, because he did not believe in these sort\nof things. However. I finally told him before writing to Mrs.\nBowyer-Bower. The only reason I did not mention it was, I\nfelt nervous people would only say I had imagined it, so decided\nto keep quiet on the subject.\nDorothy C. Spearman.\nIt is unfortunate that Mrs. Spearman should not have\nmentioned her experience to anyone before she knew of her\nbrother's death, but this weak point in the evidence is to\nsome extent counteracted, because the date of the experience\nis established by the circumstance (clearly recollected by Mrs.\nSpearman) that it occurred on the da} upon which her baby\nwas christened. The christening of the child, as we are\ninformed by Mrs. Bowyer-Bower, took place on March 19,\n1917, the day of Captain Bowyer-Bower's death. It is very\nunlikely that Mrs. Spearman's memory would deceive her on\nsuch a point as that, and it is evident from her statements\nthat the experience was of a striking and unusual character,\nthe apparition being so completely developed as to make her\nthink momentarily that her brother was actually present in\nthe flesh. She states that the experience took place \" in\nthe latter part of the morning,\" which means that allowing\n\fApril, 1919, Gases. 43\nfor the diiference of latitude it occurred at about the time\nof Captain Bowyer-Bower's death, seeing that, so far as can be\nascertained, he died in France in the early morning of the same day.\n2. Some visual impression of Captain Bowyer-Bower would\nalso appear to have been received at about the time of his\ndeath by his niece, a child of not quite three years old.\nThis incident was reported to Mr. Wales in a letter from\nthe child's mother, Mrs. Chater, Captain Bowyer-Bower's\nsister, thus :\nJune 5th [1918]\nMy mother Mrs. Bowyer-Bower tells me you wish me to write\nand tell you about my little girl saying she had seen my brother\nafter he was killed.\nOne morning while I was still in bed, about 9.15, she came\nto my room and said, \" Uncle Alley Boy is downstairs,\" and\nalthough I told her he was in France, she insisted that she had\nseen him. Later in the day I happened to be writing to my\nmother and mentioned this, not liecause I thought much about\nit, but to show that Betty still thought and spoke of her uncle\nof whom she was very fond. A few days afterwards we found\nthat the date my brother was missing was the date on my\nletter. This letter has since been destroyed.\nThe child was a httle under three years old at the time. . . .\nI have never attached much importance to this incident as it\nmay be just only a childish lie. Cecily Chater.\nConcerning the above letter Mrs. Bowyer-<Bower wrote to\nMr. Wales as follows :\n8 St. Paul's Road,\nBournemouth.\n12th June, 1918.\n. . .\n'\nAlley Boy ' was Eldred's pet name since he was a baby. .\n.\nI could not positively declare the date of Mrs. Chater's letter\nto me telMng me what Betty saw. It might have been the\n19th, 20th or 21st, but anyhow I received it down here before\nI got the War Office telegram announcing he was missing. Eldred\nfell on the Monday. The War Office telegram was received by\nme by post sent on from Bramhain Gardens, South Kensington, my\nhome, on Friday morning, March 23rd. ... I believe I received\nMrs. Chater's letter on the Wed. 21st It was 'positively a day\nor two before I got the other news. In any case she told me\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil, 1919.\nit was on Monday Betty tried to get her out of bed to come\ndown and see '\nUncle Alley Boy.' It proved to be about the\ntime the boy fell. His Colonel's account said he went out at\ndawn and after \" reconnoitring just over an hour over German\nlines he was pounced on from the clouds by an overwhelming\nnumber of enemy machines,\" etc., etc. He received the news\nfrom a Cavalry Patrol between 10-11 a.m. the same day.\n3. Concerning the third impression received at about the\ntime of Captain Bowyer-Bower's death, Mrs. Bowyer-Bower\nwrote to Mr. Wales, thus :\nJune 12th, 1918.\n. . . Mrs. Watson, an elderly lady I have known many years,\nwrote to me on the afternoon of March 19th [1917] after not\ncorresponding with me for quite 18 months, and said she felt\nshe must write because she felt I was in great anxiety over\nEldred. (I have her two letters in store in London, fortunately.)\nI wrote back and said Eldred was fit and happy, and I simply\ntook her writing thus [as an] excuse for writing again after so\nlong. I asked her in my reply what she felt about Eldred, and\nshe replied to this effect\u2014on the afternoon of the day she wrote,\nabout tea time, a certain and awful feeling came over her that he\nwas killed, etc., etc. It was the day . . .\nSubsequently in November, 1918, ]\\Irs. Bowyer-Bower sent\nto Mr. Wales the first of the two letters written to her by\nMrs. Watson, which runs as follows :\nMarch 19, 1917.\nSomething tells me you are having great anxiety about Eldred.\nWill you let me know ? Also have you good news of Tom ? . . .\nThe second of Mrs. Watson's letters Mrs. Bowyer-Bower was\nnot able to find, but her statement is sufficiently corroborated\nby the first letter, given above, which is dated March 19,\n1917, the day of Captain Bowyer-Bower's death.\nThe last two experiences, that of the child and that of Mrs.\nWatson, are not in themselves very striking, and if either\nstood alone, it might be put down to chance-coincidence. But\ntaken together, and especially taken in conjunction with Mi's.\nSpearman's remarkable experience, they are not without\ninterest, and assuming the agency of Captain Bowyer-Bower,\n1 March 19, 1917, was a Mouday.\n\fApril, 1919. Cases. 45\nthey suggest that this agency was unusually powerful and was\nfelt by more than one person.\nTwo later experiences, occurring after Captain Bowyer-\nBower's death was known, are also worth recording. They\ndo not fall into the same category as the three experiences\nrelated above, as indicating knowledge supernormally acquired,\nbut they were such as greatly to impress the percipients, and\nagain assuming the agency of Captain Bowyer-Bower ia the\ncase of the former experiences, they suggest that this agency\nhas continued to make itself felt since Captain Bowyer-Bower's\ndeath.\n4. The percipient in one case was Mrs. Bowyer-Bower, who\ndescribes her experience thus :\nJune 12, 1918.\nDuring the night, either in the late part of Nov. or early\npart of Dec. 1917, I came over very hot indeed and turned down\nthe eiderdown, etc. Some few moments later I became extra-\nordinarily cold with a most unnatural coldness. ... I doubled\nthe eiderdown over myself and tried to sleep and the feeling left\nme shghtly, but came back again stronger than ever and far more\nintense. While I wondered what I could do a yellow-blue ray\ncame right across the room and I at once blamed the housemaid\n(to myself) for not drawing the '\nRaid '\ncmtains together, thinking\nit was a Ught from the garage outside. I looked to make sure,\nbut the curtains were all well together, and as I looked the ray\nmoved right across the foot of my bed and then came round\nright across in front of where I lay. I watched, not at all\nnervously, and something like a crumpled filmy piece of chifion\nunfolded and the beautiful wavy top of Eldred's head appeared,\na few seconds and his forehead and broad, beautiful brow appeared,\nstill it waited and his lovely blue eyes came, but no mischievous\ntwinkle, but a great intensity. It all shook and quivered, then his\nnose came. More waiting and quivering and then his tiny\nUttle moustache and mouth. At this point he turned his head\nvery slightly and looked right into my face, and moistened his\nlips slightly with his tongue. I kept quite quiet, but it quivered\nand shook so much and no chin came, and in my anxiety I put\nout my hands and said :\n\" Eldred, I see you,\" and it all flickered\nquite out, Hght and all. It is possible it might have been a\ndream, one never can be certain at night, but in my own mind\nI am satisfied it was not. The eiderdown was doubled over me\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1919.\nin tlie morning when I was called, and it is not one of my habits\nto do things in my sleep. I certainly never slept after this, and\nI got slightly this cold feeling once or twice after and continued\nsmall rays several times during that night. Eldred referred to\nit through Mrs. Leonard in Jan. 1918. F. M. B. B.\n5. The percipient in the other case was Miss ^ta Highett\n(Captain Bowyer-Bower's fiancee), who describes it to Mrs.\nBowyer-Bower thus :\nThe Lodge, Hythe.\nJanuary ith, [1918].\n... I think I will tell you something that happened to me\na short time ago. I certainly did not dream it, or imagine\nit, but of course it may be something to do with my brain.\nI was going to tell you before, only I thought you would think\nme mad. I heard a number of raps when I was in bed and I\nbegan to talk to Eldred, and asked him tn rap\" twice if he was\never going to show himself to me. Almost inimediately two raps\ncame ; I waited a long time but saw nothing. Then I went\nto sleep. Afterwards I woke up and looked round and saw\nEldred on the bed beside me, he was wearing his blue suit. I\nsat up and started talking to him, [Miss Highett records what she\nsaid, and that \" his lips started to move \" and made a reply\n\" just above a whisper \"]. I then tried to touch him, but my\nhand went through him, and Uke a fool I started to cry, and\nhe disappeared. . . .\nA letter from Mrs. Bowyer-Bower to Mr. Wales, written\non May 30, 1918, states that \"Miss Highett had her vision\nin Dec. [1917]...\" In a subsequent letter, written in reply to\nquestions put to her by Mr. Wales, Miss Highett writes\n:\nSaturday I5th, [June, 1918].\n... At the time of my vision I knew of the experiences of\nMrs. Bower and Mrs. Watson and Mrs. Chater's child. [Miss\nHighett did not, however, know of the experience of Mrs. Spear-\nman. See date of Mrs. Spearman's letter.] You wish to know\nwhat 1 did between my waking and seeing the vision. As a\nmatter of fact I saw Mrs. Bower's son as soon as I woke up.\nAfter having seen the vision I switched on the electric light,\nwhich is by my bed, to look at the time and found it was four\no'clock in the morning. I think you will know by this that I\nwas perfectly awake. . .\n.\"'\nIn a further letter to Mr. Wales Miss Highett says that\nwhen she had this vision \" Captain Bower seemed to have a,\nlight all round him that made him perfectly visible.\"\n\fApku,, 1!)19. Gases. 47\nII. Appaeition at the Time of Death.\nL. 1224.\nThe following case was brought to our notice by Mrs. Willett,\nan Associate of the Society, who wrote to us concerning it\nthus :\nFir Tree End, Hayward's Heath,\nSussex, November 7, 1918.\nI inclose an account written from dictation by the Percipient\nof an appearance to her of a friend who was dying at the time.\nAda Orr, who is a single woman between 50 and 60, has been\nknown to me nearly all her life. She is an absolutely truthful\nand straightforward person. She is quite ready to answer any\nquestions, but particularly begs that the names of her friends\nshall not be made public. Mrs. B is a very nervous woman,\nand the subject of Mrs. S 's appearance has not been men-\ntioned to her. Mary Willett.\nThe statement by the perci^nent enclosed with this letter\nwas as follows :\nNovember 6, 1918.\nI went to see Mrs B in Road, on October 4, 1918,^\n[but] did not find her at home. As I came away from the\nhouse, I distinctly saw Mrs. S who formerly lodged with\nMrs. B standing by the corner of the house. Just like\na puff of cold air seemed to go over me. I saw exactly how\nshe was dressed. I noticed she was wearing her black hat\nwith a ribbon bow at the side. Her face was quite distinct.\nHaving seen her so distinctly as I came roand the corner of\nthe house, the next moment she had disappeared. I felt qiute\na creepy feeling all over me. At this time, I afterwards found\nMrs. S was dying at the Cuckfield Infirmary\u2014Mrs. B\nhaving gone to see her. She passed away at 2 a.m. the next\nmorning. When I saw Mrs. B a few days later she told\nme about Mrs. S and how she had longed to go \" home\nto die.\" She said this many times, but the doctor would not\nagree to her being removed. Before her death Mrs. S had\ntold her daughter how much she wished to see me.\n[Signed] Ada Orr.\nA further statement was obtained from Miss Orr, partly\nin reply to questions put by us, and partly by Mrs. Willett,\nwho kindly saw Miss Orr on our behalf. According to the\ninformation thus received. Miss Orr did not mention her\nexperience to anyone before she heard of Mrs. S 's death,\nexcept \"to an unknown woman passing by\" Mrs. B 's\nhouse at the time. The date of her visit to Mrs. B and\n^ By an error this date was first given as October 3, see below. \u2014Ed.\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, apiul, 1919.\nof her seeing the apparition is, however, clearly fixed in her\nmind, as she told Mrs. Willett, by the circumstance that these\nevents occurred on the day on which she heard of the birth\nof a great-niece. Mrs. Willett informs us that the child was\nborn on October 3. 1918, and the postcard annoimcing the\nbirth was received by Miss Orr on October 4, 1918. The\nmistake in Miss Orr's original statement, in which the date\nof her visit to Mrs. B was given as October 3, arose\ndoubtless through that being the date of the child's birth\nby means of which she had fixed the date of her experience.\nA written statement was obtained from Miss Orr on this\npoint, thus :\nDecember 17, [1918].\nI remember the date by hearing of the birth of my niece's\nBaby which I heard of by P.O. on the day that I saw Mrs. S .\nA. M. Oer.\nIn reply to a question as to how recently she had seen\nMrs. S and what she knew about her state of health,\nMiss Orr wrote on November 13, 1918, thus :\n[I] had not seen her for at least three months when she was\ntaken away from Mrs. B 's to the Infirmary. I had no\nidea her end was near. At the time I saw her I had had a long\nwalk and was *^ired, thought I would call at Mrs. B 's for\na rest, and heard afterwards she was with Mrs. S who was\ndying, which I knew nothing about. Ada Ore.\nIn regard to the date of Mrs. S 's death, independent\ntestimony was obtained through the Curate of the Parish,\nwho WTote thus :\nDecember 13, 1918.\nI have just found out\u2014quite indirectly\u2014from Mrs. B that\nMrs. S died at Cuckfield Infirmary on Saturday, October 5th,\nat 2 a.m. H. E. W.\nIt will be seen that it was not possible in this case to obtain\ncorroborative evidence from any one to whom Miss Orr had\nrelated her experience prior to her knowledge of Mrs. S 's\ndeath ; but her original statement was made only a month\nafter the experience occurred, when it was still fresh in her\nmind, and there appears to have been nothing in the circum-\nstances, as known to Miss Orr at the time, which would\nlead her to imagine that she saw Mrs. S . Miss Orr teUs\nus that she has never had any similar experience before, but\nher sister had one many years ago.\n\fNos. CCCLV.-CCCLVL\u2014Vol. XIX.

Herbert Thurston, S.J.\nThe phenomenon of \" elongation \" is of comparatively rare\noccurrence among alleged manifestations of the physico-psychic\norder. The case of D. D. Home has, of course, been widely\nand fully discussed, but materials for comparison are not\nabundant, and some account of an out-of-the-way sixteenth\ncentury example may possibly be of interest. The details\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1919.\nwhich I here submit are derived from the Process of Beatifi-\ncation of an Italian nun, Veronica Laparelli, who was born\nin 1537 and died in 1620.\nAlthough the Process has never been completed, the delay\nwas not due, I fancy, to any lack of the necessary evidence,\nbut probably only to want of funds, for a process of beatifi-\ncation, like a private bill in parliament, entails considerable\noutlay in taking evidence, printing reports, paying copyists,\netc., and when such a process drags on for fifty or a hundred\nyears the interest of promoters is apt to slacken. In the\ncase of Veronica Laparelli the first stages were successfully\ncarried through, and a fat volume of the usual blue-book\nsize enshrines the Positio super dubio an. constet de Virtutibus\nFide Spe el Charitate et Cardinalibus . . . in gradu heroico, in\nother words a statement of the claim of this particular servant\nof God to have practised virtue in a heroic degree. The\nprinted volume to which I refer ^ includes, as is usual, a full\nsummary of the evidence given by witnesses on oath before\nboth the \" ordinary \" and \" apostolic \" commission. Such\na blue-book, if we may so describe it, was intended exclusively\nfor the use of the members of the Congregation of Sacred\nRites charged with the examination of the cause, and references\nare given throughout to the official report of the depositions,\npreserved in the archives of the Congregation. The portion\nof the volume which concerns us here is that which describes\nthe ecstasies {estasi, ratti) of Suor Veronica. In middle life\n(about 1560 to 1590) she undoubtedly experienced many such\ntrances, but, as often in other similar cases, they do not\nseen* to have continued in old age. Hence the depositions\ntaken during the \" Processus ordinarius,\" i.e. the bishop's\ncommission, which sat in 1629, are somewhat less satisfactory\nthan might othepwise have been expected, owing to the fact\nthat at that date Veronica's own contemporaries were mostly\neither dead or very aged. Itx seems, however, that one of\nthe nuns, Suor Margherita Cortonesi, afterwards Abbess, wrote\na life of Veronica while she was yet living.\n' Tlie copy I liave used is in the library of the British Museum. It is\ncatalogued under \"Veronica (Laparelli), Saint,\"\u2014this is a mistake; she is not\nin fact canonized\u2014and was printed in Rome in 1747. The press mark is\n1229, h, 7.\n\fMat-Junk, 1919. Instance of \" Elongation.\" 53\nThis document was presented in evidence. Further, there\nwere a few of the nuns, and some externs, who had a clear\nrecollection of the ecstasies, while others deposed to what they\nhad heard about them from the older generation now passed\naway. Perhaps the most extraordinary of these trances was\none which once came upon Veronica when she was ringing\na joyous peal upon the convent bell on the eve of the great\nfestival of St. Francis. The bell went on and on, without\nstopping, and on going out to discover the cause, they found\nthat Veronica had fallen into an ecstasy without interrupting\nthe occupation upon which she was engaged. The ringing\ncontinued for three hours, during which they tried in vain\nto awaken her from the trance. Her hand gxasped the beU\nrope so firmly that it was impossible to wrest it from her,\nand in the end they found it necessary to cut the rope.\nBut even this operation, attended necessarily by a cessation\nof the noise and a diminution of the muscular effort, did not\nbring her to herself, and she went on for some time in the\ntrance state, moving her arm up and down as before.^ On\nthe feast of the Conversion of St. Paul (Jan. 25th) she used\nfor many years in succession to fall into an ecstasy which lasted\nfor fifty or sixty hours.\nThe Archpriest of Cortona (the convent to which Veronica\nbelonged was at Cortona), the Very Rev. Letio Passermi,\naged sixty-seven, deposed that in his youth he had seen her\nwhen she had already been three days in that state. \" She\nwas kneeling,\" he said, \" with her hands joined, her face\ntm'ned to heaven, her eyes open, fixed and unblinking \" [con\ngV occhi aperti e fissi che non battevano niente).'^ It was\nknown to all the community, as the manuscript Life, already\nspoken of, attests, that on some of these occasions \"'she was\nraised above the ground.\nMother Plautilla Semboli, a nun who in 1629 when she\ngave evidence was seventy-four years of age, deposed that the\nsaid Suor Veronica had many ecstasies and raptures, and that\nshe herself had frequently seen her in this state. \" In parti-\ncular,\" she went on, \" my late father, Averardo Semboli, on\none occasion came to the gTate of the convent and found there\nSister Veronica, kneeling in ecstasy, and he said to me, '\nlook\n^ \" Summarium in op. cit. p. 14\"2. - \/'*. p. 140.\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1919.\nand see what it is that Sister Veronica has under her knees,\nfor she seems to me to be taller than her ordinary stature '\n;\nand I thereupon put my haiid under her knee and I found\nthat she was lifted up above the ground.\" ^ Another witness,\nnot a nun, one Signora Magdalena Alari, aged sixty-five,\ndeposed that she had three times seen Suor Veronica in\necstasy, and on one occasion raised from the ground as much\nas a palm (? 10 inches), or a little more according to the account\nof some of the nuns. After which the witness goes on :\n\" And, as I stated above, I sav; her three times, on different\ndays, when one of the nuns aforesaid took a stick and passed\nit under the knees of the said Suor Veronica, so that the\npeople who were there present might see that the said Suor\nVeronica in her ecstasy was raised above the gxound. She\nknelt {stava) with her hands joined, motionless, her eyes\nfixed, and such a nimiber of people came to look at her\nthat the chapel was full of them. Suor Veronica, who had\ncome there to say her prayers, was inside the grate, which '\nwas then opposite the altar of the Blessed Sacrament.\" ^\n\"With regard to the fact of elongation the evidence is less\nprecise than one could wish, but in the process of 1629 the\nmanuscript life by Suor Margherita Cortonesi was cited to the\nfollowing effect\n:\n\" On one occasion, among others, when she (Veronica) being\nin the trance state was reciting her ofiice alternately with\nsome invisible being, she was observed gradually to stretch\nout imtil the length of her throat seemed to be out of all\nproportion (pareva facesse 'una gala lunga fuori di misura) in\nsuch a way that she was altogether much taller than usual.\nWe, noticing this strange occurrence, looked to see if she was ,\nraised from the ground, but this, so far as our eyes could\ntell us, was not the case. So, to make sure, we took a yard-\nmeasure {canna) and measured her height, and afterwtrds\nwhen she had come to herself we measured her again and she\nwas a \" span \" (at least ten inches) shorter. This we have seen\nwith our own eyes all of us nuns who were in the chapel.\"\" ^\nThe second piece of evidence is second-hand, but it was\n^ Stmiinnriitm, p. 138. - Snmmarium, p. 141.\n\"'\nSummarlum, p. 144.\n\fMay-June, 1919. Instance of \" Elongation.\" 55\ngiven in 1629 and is quite definite. Donna Hortenzia Ghini,\naged sixty-nine, then deposed that :\n\" Sister Lisabetta Pancrazi, formerly a nun in the said\nconvent, told me that on one occasion seeing that the said\nSister Veronica when in ecstasy seemed taller than m hef\nnormal state she took a yard-measure (canna) and measured\nher height, and that after the said Sister Veronica came to\nherself she measured her again with the said yard-measure,\nand she found that she was half an arm's length {un mezzo\nhraccio) shorter ; and this I know because I heard the said\nSister Lisabetta say it, as I said above.\" ^\nWitnesses in the \" Apostolic \" enquiry held in 1728, a\nhundred years later, evidently exaggerated the facts observed.\nThey, at that date, could only speak of the traditions surviving\nin the convent. The story, of course, had grown, and some\nnuns declared that in her trances Sister Veronica was at times\ntwice her normal height. Clearly, such evidence as this is\nquite worthless, while even the depositions just cited are by\nno means as full or as direct as one would wish. But the\npoint I would lay stress upon, even more than the evidence\nitself, is the extreme unlikelihood of these enclosed nuns having\ninvented such a detail as the elongation of Veronica's throat\nand body. They certainly knew nothing of Jamblichus, and\nwhile instances of levitation are very common in such records\nof saintly mystics, I have never previously come upon a case\nof apparent elongation. Moreover, this particular feature was\nevidently quite new to the Promotor Fidei (the \"Devil's\nAdvocate \") whose duty it was to criticise the evidence and\ncall attention to weak points. In his Animadversiones he\nsingles out among other details this incident of the reported\nelongation. It seems rather to have shocked him.\n\"Furthermore,\" he says, \"we may note a certain unUkeli-\nhood and incongTuity in the fact, as stated in the Summarium\n(p. 141), that on one occasion the body of the servant of\nGrod. when in ecstasy, stretched out and grew beyond its\nnatural measure, while other witnesses extend the same pheno-\nmenon to occasions when she was praying without any ecstasy.\nAnd thereupon he goes on to remark that this elongation was\nnot only intrinsically improbable, but that it could serve no\n^ SHinmarium, p. 141.\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-.Tune, 1919.\npurpose of edification or utility. It could uot help the servant\nof God herself, and would excite repulsion and alarm rather\nthan devotion in the beholder.^\nAnd there, I think, we may leave the matter, with the\nremark that even if the nuns Avere unscrupulous enough to\nbe willing to fabricate evidence, they would not be likely\nto invent things calculated to prejudice rather than to aid\nthe cause they had at heart.\nCASE.\nL. 1225. Telepathic.\nThe following case of a dream which appears to have had\na telepathic origin has been sent to us by the dreamer, Mrs.\nHanson, who has been an Associate of the Society for some\nyears. _\nAn account of her experience was received from Mrs. Hanson\nas follows :\nPleasaunce Cottage, Dorman's Park,\nNr. East Grinstead, January 7, 1919.\nI thought the enclosed dream might be of interest to the\nSociety for Psychical Researeli, of which I have been an Associate\nfor several years, so am sending details.\nSince the summer of 1915 I have, first personally and later\nthrough the Prisoners of War Care Committee, been sending\nregular parcels to Lance-Corporal W. D ,\nRoyal Scots Fusiliers\nRegiment, prisoner first at Doberitz and later at Guben, Branden-\nburg.\nI do not know the man or his family personally, and heard of\nhim through a friend who was interesting herself in the British\nPrisoners. Apart from occasional J)ostcards thanking me for the\nparcels, and two photographs and a group taken at the Prison,\nI have had no other correspondence with the man. Since the\nArmistice I have naturally awaited with interest any news that\nI might receive from him. I was away for Xmas, and as I had\nheard nothing from him I began to wonder if he was all right,\nand determined on my return to write to his wife and ask her\nif she had received any news.\n' Animadrersione\u00bb, p. 13.\n\fMat-June, 1919. Case. 57\nI had a good deal of correspondence to get through, and put\noff writing until Sunday, Jan. 5th. The previous night (Sat.\nJan. 4th) I had a very vivid dream twice repeated, in fact I\ncould be almost sure it came three times, but of twice I am\ncertain. In the dream I was with my husband in some strange\nplace talking to L.-C. D . We shook hands with him, and he\nsaid he was safe home. He was dressed in a dark imiform\nsimilar to that of one of the photographs he sent me. In\nthe morning (Jan. 5th) when I woke up I told my husband, and\nalso the maid when she came to wake us. I enclose both their\nstatements to this effect. The impression left by the dream was\nso vivid that I did not write to Mrs. D ,\nthinking I would\nwait a day or two longer in case I might hear of her husband's\narrival. This morning (Jan. 7th) I received a p.c. which I also\nenclose, dated by postmark Jan. 5th, from L.\/C. D saying he\nhad just arrived at Leith. Therefore when I was dreaming that\nhe was safely home he must have nearly reached Leith , . ,\nI am not in the habit of dreaming much, and seldom remember\nmy dreams, and only once before, a good many years ago, have\nI ever had anything of interest in this way. M. R. Hanson.\nA corroborative statement was enclosed from Mrs. Hanson's\nhusband, thus :\nJanuary 7, 1919.\nOn the morning of Jan. 5th, shortly after 7 a.m., my wife\ntold me she had had two most vivid dreams about her Prisoner\nof War, a man named D . She said that she and I met\nhim in a strange jilace, that we shook hands with him, and he\nsaid he was safe home.\nMy wife told me she was sure we should hear something of\nhim very shortly. B. F. Hanson.\nA further corroborative statement was enclosed from Mrs.\nHanson's maid, thus\n:\nJanuary 7th, 1919.\nI beg to say that at 7.15 on the morning of the 5th of January,\nI called Mr. and Mrs. Hanson. Mrs. Hanson said : \" I have\nhad such a vivid dream of D ,\" meaning a Prisoner of War,\nthat she through the Red Cross had been sending parcels to, and\nMrs. Hanson said : \"I was in a strange place with Mr. Hanson\nand saw D\u2014\u2014,'\"\nin the suit that he had sent her a photograph\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1919.\nof himself, and site said, \" I woke up, and went to sleep and\ndreamt of him again.\"\nIn a little over 40 hours I took a postcard to Mrs, Hanson\nand said, \" I think it's hom D .\" I might say I have been\nin service for Mr. and Mrs. Hanson some years. M. 0.\nThe postcard to which Mrs. Hanson refers in her statement\nhas an Edinburgh postmark, dated 4 p.m., January 5, 1919.\nIt reads :\nI have just landed at Leith, and am going on to\nPrisoners of War Recej)tion Camp,\nSouth Camp,\nRipon.\n[Signed] L.\/C. W. D\nR.S.F.\nIt appears, therefore, as Mrs. Hanson says, that at the time\nof her dream, the night of January 4-5, 1919, Lance-Corporal\nD was approaching Leith. The intention of sending a\npostcard to Mrs. Hanson may well have been in his mind at\nthe time, since he despatched it immediately on his arrival.\nThe coincidence is not a very striking one, but it seems\nworth while to put it on record, in view of the fact that Mrs.\nHanson does not frequently dream, or at any rate remember\nher dreams, and that this particular dream was vivid and was\nrepeated at least twice during the night.\nOBITUAEY.\nCharles Mason Barrows.\nWe have received from Mr. Arthur 0. Christensen of Brooklyn,\nN.Y., some account of the life and work of Charles Mason\nBarrows, who was for many years an Associate of the Society\nfor Psychical Research and died in 1918. In 1896 he con-\ntributed an article to Proceedings (Vol. XII. pp. 21 ff.) entitled\n*'\nSuggestion without Hypnotism.\"\nMr. Barrows, who was born in 1838, appears to have become\ninterested in the question of cure by suggestion at quite\nan early age, and for many years he practised healing with\nconsiderable success. He himself gives some account of the\n\fMat-Jone, 1919. Obituary. 59\nresults he achieved in the article to Proceedings which is\nmentioned above ; as its title implies Mr. Barrows did not\nuse hypnotism, but gave the suggestion to his patients in a\nwaking state.\nPerhaps the most interesting, though not the most successful\npart of his work, was his prolonged effort during the latter\nyears of his life to cure deafness by suggestion, and in par-\nticular deaf-mutism. He turned his attention to this subject\nfirst at the end of 1901, and in 1904, when he was living in\nBoston, he got into touch with Alexander Graham Bell, Presi-\ndent of the American Association to Promote the Teaching of\nSpeech to the Deaf, and a Committee was appointed to enquire\ninto his methods. Partly with the assistance of Dr. Hodgson,\nthen Secretary of the American Branch of the S.P.R., ten\nj)upils were obtained, but the results achieved, although not\nwithout interest, were inconclusive.\nIn 1907 JVIr. Barrows moved to New York, where he con-\ntinued his experiments.\nFlorence Linsky seems to have been the star pvipil. . . Letters\nfrom her parents and a doctor state that she was totally deaf\nand dumb when she began treatment, but that she became\nnormal in hearing and speech. John P. Hines of the St. Matthew's\nRoman Catholic Church at 216 W. 68th St., New York, wrote\non Jan. 5, 1910 :\n\" I have known her (Florence Linsky) from\ninfancy. She had spinal meningitis . . . which left her totally\ndeaf . . . convinced me beyond a doubt that the girl hears as\nAvell as the average. . . . She easily heard and repeated words\nand sentences which I spoke to her . . . under conditions that\n23revented her getting any help from sight.\"\nMr. Barrows also seems to have had some success with a\nman called Holton \" between thirty and thirty-five years old,\ndeaf and dumb from his birth.\"\nThe course began May 18th. All summer treatments were\n\u2022continued. On June 12th Holton wrote :\n\" When I am quiet\naround my work I hear some fellows talking. It does not last\nlonger than one or two minutes, but the hearing is getting clearer\nand stronger. When I first heard it was very faint, but now\nis about four times as clear.\"\" On June 30th, \" I told Mrs.\nHolton I would prove I could hear trolley cars. . . . She was\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1919.\nsurprised. I told her a piano was playing next door. She\ndid not believe me, and I told her to go and see. She was\nsurprised to find it was.\" On July 8th : \"I don't know what\nsome soimds I hear are. The hearing is really increasing.\" . . .\nOn Jan. 24, 1914, in a carefully written report, Mr. Luther H.\nHolton, cousin of Charles, . . . wrote: \"We are satisfied that\nC. N. B. Holton has acquired the ability to hear certain sounds.\"\nStill the case was not conclusive.\nUnfortunately Holton seems to have become impatient of\nthe treatment, and it was given up. Mr. Barrows continued\nhis efforts up to within a very short time of his death, but\nhe does not seem to have attained any results more definite\nthan those c[uoted above. He worked to the last, however,\nwith disinterested enthusiasm.\nCOEEESPONDEXCE.\nPERSONAL APPEARANCE OF THE DEPARTED.\nI.\nI'o the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nApril 8, 1919.\nDear Madam,\u2014Dr. Jacks will hardly expect a reply from me\nto his interesting discussion in the February\u2014March Journal.\nHe is seeking to find the simplest explanation of certain\nphenomena, but of course well knows that what we really need\nis not the simple but the true. He will say the simplest must\nalso be the truest, and I agree; but we cannot always judge\nwhat is really the simplest, until our knowledge is adequate.\nI go further, and say that the true explanation of anything is\nnot only in the long run the most simple, it is unique. A\nproblem has not two solutions but only one. Yet, as in a chess\nproblem, a number of false solutions appear at first sight both\nsimple and attractive, while the real solution may appear\nstrange and unlikely. Inevitably so in a period of half\nknowledge. Only when we fairly grasp the whole can the\nbeautiful simplicity of reality conspicuously appear.\nAn astronomical structure for the atoms of matter, if suggested\n20 years ago, would have appeared absurdly complicated, and\nthe lines in the spectrum of an element were felt to be almost\nhopeless in their variety ; yet law and order are dawning through\n\fMat-June, 1919. Corresponclen ce. 61\nthe mist, and a wonderful generalisation is beginning to appear.\nAt present we psychic enquirers may feel sometimes like asking\n\"Who shall roll vis awav the stone from the door of the\nsepulchre\"? But v.dien we arrive at the door we may find that\nthe stone is rolled away.\nOliver Lodge.\nII.\nTo the Editor of tJir Jovrn-al of the S.P.R.\nDear ]\\L4.dam, \u2014Dr. Jacks savs that \"these appearances, as\ndescribed by mediums, seem to indicate not such knowledge as\na person would have of what he looks (or looked) like, but rather\nthe view of an external observer.\" I now offer an argument\nwhich, if sound, proves that Dr. Jacks is right : the experience\nof mediums must, if veridical to us as evidence, give these\nappearances as those concerned were known to us, not merely as\nthey are or were known to themselves.\nIn the discussion of the question raised it would appear that\nMrs. Henry Sidgwick's exhaustive paper on the '\"Psychology of\nMrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena\" (Proc, Vol. XXVIII.) has\nnot been referred to. I tliink. if the theory she suggests be\naccepted, the problem before us is simplified. But, of course,\nany deductions I may suggest, I alone am responsible for.\nNow we (nearly?) all dream, and in dreams we picture other\npeople to ourselves as we kneic them. Most of these dreams pass\naway from us in memory. But some few do not so pass. Many\nprobably, like myself, have had innumerable dream.s which have\nall passed away: all passed away but some very few. Why have\nthese few remained marked and distinguished in memory ? Because\nof something distinct and separate from the appearance. The\nappearance is like all other dream experiences, but at its time\nof appearance it is uniquely marked as no more than the projected\nappearance- on our mortal plane of a spirit. We feel this, do\nnot know it. It is the strength of this feeling which stereotypes\nthe experience in memory. But, in every case, the appearance\nis of the person as known to us, not as known to itself. We\nfeel that the spirit has \"put on\" its anthropomorphic appearance\npurely for the purpose of appearing to and being recognised by\nus as we Icnew it on earth.\nAnd here, with all respect, I must differ from Dr. Jacks. He\nsays \"I should expect my departed friend to manifest himself\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1919.\nas lie had become iu the meantime; instead of which he manifests\nas he was a long time ago.\" . , .\n\u2022\n.\nIf metempsychosis be true and the departed friend has, after\ndeath, taken on some other material form^that of a bear ? \u2014he\ncould manifest himself as he had become in the meantime, though\nit is doubtful, even in such case, that he would be recognised.\nBut if, after death, he has form\u2014even etherial form\u2014which has\nnever been part of our human experience, he could not manifest\nhimself as he had become. Any such appearance to us would\nbe meaningless,\u2014for all thought is relative. In order to appear\nhe must appear as we knew him. Otherwise we could by no\npossibility recognise him,\u2014unless in ecstasy.\nIt has been well said that there are three John Smiths : one\nknown to his God ; one to himself ; one to others. If the John\nSmith known to himself and to others be the same, then cadit\nqitaest'io. But assume they are not the same? Then John\nSmith, in order to appear to others and be recognised, must\nappear as they knew him.\nIn fact we dramatize ourselves not only to others, but to\nourselves. What we know of each other is the dramatized \" I,\"\nand for a departed friend to appear to us and be recognised he\nmust appear as he was dramatized for us and not for liimself.\nI worry out this question in \"Myself and Dreams.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick's suggested theory agrees, I think, with human\nexperience and still leaves open the possibility of communication\nfrom spirits. But with such communication we are not now\nconcerned.\nMrs. Piper, when in trance, dreams: dreams even of Julius\nCaesar, clad in helmet and armour, with a sword, flying in search\nof a Mexican cowboy ; dreams of him so engaged in company,\nit would appear, with D. D. Home, Alexander the Great, Proteus\nand others. I think we must assume that iu all such dreams she\ndreamt of personages as they appeared to her, not as they\nappeared to themselves.\nI refer to Mrs. Piper's subjective dreams not for the purpose\nof throwing contempt, but to emphasize the fact that some q\u00a3\nher dreams are of individuals, imaginary or real, who appear to\nher as pictured by herself not by themselves. Pier dreams are\nlike to our own dreams. If they diifer it is in degree not in\nkind.\nNow with Mrs. Piper we find sometimes what Mrs. Sidgwick\n\fMay-June, 1919. Correspondence. 63\nlias termed \"flashes of iutelligeuce.\" Telergic messages are said,\nat times, to get through from a communicator ; that is, the\ncommunicator appears himself to use Mrs. Piper's brain as a\nmachine directly : he does not, first, affect her spirit and make\nher spirit use its brain for the message to emerge. (But cf. Proc,\nVol. XXVIII., p. 320.)\nBut is there any veridical case, where a \"flash of intelligence\"\nhas got through, qua appearance? Is such a thing possible for\nMrs. Piper herself, quite apart from the question of the evidence\nof it she could offer us if it occurred ?\nLet us assume that, in trance, Mrs. Piper's spirit is so free\nfrom the body that she is in communion with other spirits, though\nthe assumption is a bold oue. Even with this assumption it\nwould be impossible for Mrs. Piper to give us any evidence of\nhow these spirits appear to themselves or even as they appear to\nher : there is no language in existence to express such appearances.\nPor language can only use ideas for expression, and really spiritual\nappearances transcend ideas. I agree with William James that\necstasy is part of human experience. But the records of ecstasy\nare all anthropomorphic.\nI agree with Mrs. Sidgwick as to the relation which exists\nbetween Mrs. Piper on the one hand and her controls and\ncommunicators on the other. But this hypothesis, as she points\nout, does not interfere with any assumption as to telepathy from\nthe dead.\nWe have not before us for consideration the personal experience\nof mediums: all we have is the fvidencc they offer of their\nexperience.\nIf, free in spirit, mediums are in communion with disembodied\nspirits, they can offer no evidence of what is the appearance of\nspirits in reality : on return from the state of ecstasy no language\nis found available to express the past experience.\nBut, it is now assumed, the disembodied do return in such form\nthat mediums can give evidence to us of their appearance. For\nthis evidence to have any weight with us what must its nature\nbe ? It is worthless to us unless we ourselves recoenise the\npersonality in question.\nIt follows that the appearance, in order that we should recognise\nit, must be of the person as known to us, not as known to itself.\n_ . F. C. Constable.\n\f6'4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-June, 1919.\nIII.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.E,.\nDear Madam,\u2014Dr. Jacks in the Journal for February-March\nseems to find difficulties where perhaps there are none, as to th&\npower of spirits to build up bodies\u2014or to suggest what he calls\nfor tlie moment an (a<<obiographical representation of themselves.\nIt would appear that even on this plane each of us has an\ninherent idea what he or she looks like, and any Art-school\nmaster knows that in drawing from the life the tendency\nof the student is to reproduce him or herself, so that a tall\nstudent will have a tendency to draw the model tall and a short\nstudent makes the opjDosite mistake, and so with other attributes,\nas fatness or thinness. Artists have a tendency also to draw\nthemselves. Cruickshank's model in very many of his illustrations\nwas undoubtedly himself, and this effect was an unconscious one.\nAnyone with a capacity to draw will be able to draw himself not\nonly front but sid\u00a9 face, and will also make a fair representation\nof his back view.\nThis, I think, will be found to be undisputed.\nIf the spirits then have tlie power of building up a form, it\nrequires no supposition of a miracle on their part to build up a\nform which shall be like themselves as they were m life.\nAs to the incident of the unshakable door mentioned by Dr.\nJacks, the difficulty here arises from the word\u2014the door was\n\"unshakable\" and afterwards was shaken (apparently).\nIt would appear the adjective unshakable was wrongly used.\nA. G. WiTHERBY.\nIV.\nTo the Editor of tlie Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014Is it not possible that when a medium gives a\ndescription of the personal appearance of a departed spirit, th\u00a9\ndescription is derived from what I may term a retrospective\nvision of the deceased person, and his or her environment, when\nalive upon earth ? This vision would be similar to retrospective\ncrystal visions in which past events are reproduced in exact detail\ntogether with the characteristics of the persons who took part in\nthem.\nSucli a vision might be induced by telepathy from a sitter, or\nby telepathy from a departed spirit v\/ith whom the medium was\n\f-May-June, 1919. Correspondence. 65\nin some sort of communication. And the medium would not\nnecessarily knoAV from whom the telepathic influence was derived ;\nor the date of the vision : or whether the person seen was alive\nor dead.\nSuch visions were, I think, consciously seen by \"Miss A.,\"\nwho also received verbal communications from those she saw in\nvisions\u2014crystal and otherwise. And, if I remember rightly,\nLady Radnor particularly noted that when \"Miss A.\" described a\ncrystal vision at the time of seeing it, she usually spoke as if she\nwere in the midst of the people she described, not merely looking\nat them in a moving picture.\nI suggest that trance-mediums have similar visions, but,\nthrough being unconscious, are unable to describe them as\nvisions in the way \"Miss A.,\" who was alway.s fully conscious,\nwas able to do.\nS. M. KiNGSFORD.\nV.\nTo thr Editor of the Journal of the S.P.E.\nApril 28th, 1919.\nDear Madam,\u2014Dr. Jacks in his interesting article in the\nJournal for February-March, 1919, dealing with the question of\nwhether the personal descriptions given by a medium are the\nalleged spirit's conception of his own appearance, or the view of\nan external observer, seems, if I may venture to say so, to deal\ntoo much with the a priori aspect of the subject.\nWould not some a posteriori evidence throw more light on the\nmatter ? In other words, would it not be possible to collect and\nrecord the differences, if any, between the descriptions given and\nthose remembered by the sitter and others ?\nIn this connection my own small experience may be worth\nrecording. A recent long, and in many ways very \"evidential,\"\nsitting with Mrs. Leonard began with a description of my late\nwife, as having dark brown hair and dark brown eyebrows. I\nhave asked several people who knew her well what they considered\nthe colour of her hair, and one and all have unhesitatingly\nanswered \"black.\" But, and this is the point of my story, she\nherself in life always vehemently alleged, in despite- of the\nlaughing contradiction of myself and her friends, that her hair\nwas dark brown.\nBasil Hall.\n. ^\n\u2022 [This correspondence must now cease.\u2014Ed.]\n\f66 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research. mat-June, 1919.\nCO-OPERATIVE AUTOMATISM.\nTo the Editor of tin- Journal of the S.P.R.\nJannary, 1919.\nDear Madam,\u2014The most important advance in Psychical\nResearch that has been made in recent years has been the\ninstitution of co-operation between two or more automatists.\nThis is true irrespective of the results obtained, as to thef\nsignificance of which tliere is still room for much dispute. It\nis the method that matters, and the introduction of a new\nmethod into any science is an event of the first importance.\nThis new method, which may be called that of co-operative\nautomatism, was suggested in the first instance by an observed\nconcordance between the scripts of various automatists, and has\nbeen developed almost entirely in the direction of securing\ninternal evidence of the activity of independent intelligences.\nThe privilege of initiating experiments is not confined to those\nin charge of the experiments, but is even conceded to the very\n'\ncontrols '\n'\nwhose nature is under investigation. It is what I\nshould call a very advanced method, and it is my object in\nthis letter to throw out a few suggestions for a programme\nof very elementary experiments of a kind that seems to be in\ndanger of being overlooked in connection with that particular\nclass of automatisms generally included in the term automatic\nwfiting. (I am not aware of a generic term which covers\nautomatic hand-writing, planchette writing, use of \" Ouija board,\"\netc., and suggest 'manual automatism' as being a convenient\nphrase.)\nWhen a scientific worker is confronted with a relatively\nunknown conq^lex x, he can usually perceive or guess at the\noutset that it is to some extent at least determined by certain\nrelatively better known factors or conditions a, h and c. If\nthe subject matter permits, he proceeds to vary the quantity\nor incidence of a, h and c in order to watch the eifect on\noc. During the experimental process, other factors d and e\nemerge, and in the end he is able to state x in terms of \u00ab, h, c, d\nand ('. In the realm of Psychical Research x is usually a\nhighly elaborate complex about which we know very little. It\nis therefore necessary to start, as it were, at the very beginning\nand to vary in a systematic manner the most general and\n' I u.se the word control in a general sense, as indicating any soi-disant\n\" comnumicator. '\n\fMay-Junk, liil9. Correspondence. 67\nelementary conditions in which the phenomenon under observation\noccurs.\nWe may now apply this principle to the case of manual\nautomatisms. Regarded objectively, every such automatism is\nan event, determined in time, place and circumstances. Our\nprogramme of experiments will require us to vary each of these\nin turn in a scientific manner. Some experiments, of course,\nwould 'prove' more than others, and it will be useful, in\npassing, to consider the evidential value of one or tv\/o types\nof experiment. Take each of the above 'conditions' in order.\nI. Time.\n(a) Sipichronized automatisms. I am not aware that any\nsystematic attempt has been made with two or more automatists,\nworking in different places, to obtain exactly simultaneous\nmessages from the same control. If, as the result of a series\nof such experiments, it appeared that a given control never\nmanifests in two places at ])rccis(ly the same moment, it would\ntend to show that a control is independent of the automatists\nand is not a 'subliminal self of any one of them. If, on the\nother hand, simultaneous messages were received, it would seem\nto follow either that the control is not an independent entity,\nor else that it can 'divide its attention' in a supernormal way.-'\n(6) Periodic automatisms. The experimenter would then set\nout to obtain at certain definite intervals of time a series of\nmessages from the same control through different automatists\nand study any evidence there might be of development in time.\nAn experiment of this type was earned out by Mr. J. A. Hill,\nand is described on pp. 240 and 241 of his book \" Psycliical\nInvestigations.\" With a 'rapport' object which had belonged\nto a person recently deceased he obtained through different\nmediums results which varied from complete failure five days\nafter death, through partial failures, to '\"considerable evidence\"\nof \"identity and initiative\" some five and a half months after\ndeath. On the spiritist hypothesis, this apparent development\nindicates a gradual waking up of the spirit of the deceased\nperson. Experiments of this type, however, though valuable,\niMr. Lambert does not seeiu to have takeu into account the possibility of\n\"deferred impressions,\" i.e. that an impression might not emerge until some\ntime after the automatist had received it. This possibility would greatly com-\nplicate such an experiment as he suggests.\n\u2014\nEp.\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May-Junk, 1919.\nare by no means crucial in the sense of excluding any other\nthan the spiritist explanation. Psychometry might give the\nmedium (subconsciously) the simple information '\nthis object\nbelonged to a person who has been dead j: days or months,' and\nthe medium's constructive imagination, assisted by telepathy\nfrom the sitter, would 'construct' a spirit with just the right\namount of development, according to the common belief among\nspiritists that a period of sleep and gradual awakening follows\nbodily death. I do not suggest that this is the right explanation,\nbut the mystery that surrounds psychometry obscures the issue\nof all such experiments as formal proofs or even as evidence\nof the theory they are usually supposed to confirm.\nII. Place.\nIt seems to me a pity that the place where an automatism\noccurs is not always recorded as an essential particular. The\nquestion arises whether an automatist is more successful in one\nplace than another in obtaining messages from a given control.\nDo places exercise a kind of '\nrapport ' influence ? This seems\nto be believed by persons who obtain historical details about\nplaces by automatic writing, but I am not aware that this\ncircumstance has been systematically investigated in connection\nwith the evidence for or against the individuality and identity\nof controls. Experiments in this field are urgently required to\nthrow additional light on the vexed hypotheses of '\nclairvoyance,'\n'cosmic memory,' 'spirit return' and so on.\nIII. Circumstances.\nThis term covers a very wide range of conditions, from the\nemotional state of the automatist to the colour of the wallpaper\nin the room, and opens up a wide field for experiment. It\nmust here suffice to suggest variations of two very general\nconditions which may influence the phenomena under investigation,\nviz. :\n(a) preseuce or absence of liglit\n(h) presence or absence of sifters.\nIt seems to be a well-established fact that white light has\nas a rule a disintegrating effect on the 'mechanisms' which\nproduce telekinetic movements of material objects, but, so far\nas I am aware, it does not interfere with manual automatisms.\nThe point of this observation will be made clea.r by what\n\fMat-June, 1919. Correspondence. 69\nfollows. Certain considerations almost compel the conviction\nthat, at any rate with some automatists, the movements of the\nhand and arm are not centrally controlled through the mechanism\nof brain, nerve and muscle, but are imposed, as it were, locally\nby a kind of nascent ectenic force applied inside the arm (if\nthis contradiction in terms may be allowed). It is to be noted\nthat the interior of the arm (and of the whole body) is\nprotected by the blood in the capillaries from the direct incidence\nof actinic rays, which are harmful to certain vital processes, and\nprovides a suitable place for the application of that force wliich,\nwhen projected externally, causes telekinesis. Take, for instance,\nthe experiments described by Sir William Barrett in chapter xiv.\nof his book \"On the Threshold of the Unseen.\" The autoscope\n(an ouija board) there spelt out messages from letters concealed\nfrom the automatists and arranged in an order which was not\nknown to them. The suggestion of \" locally-imposed \" guidance\nis here very strong.\nThe further question arises whether the recorder of the\nmessages has anything to do with the success of such experiments.\nDoes the operating force use his eyes to direct the hands of the\nactual automatists? In other words, is he an unconscious\nco-operator in the experiments ? I have not come across any\ninvestigation of this possibility, which seems to me to be a real\none. To put this matter to the test, it would be necessary to\nexclude the recorder of the message and devise some means of\nkeeping a mechanical record of the movements of the autoscope.\nThis might be done by covering the letters on the table with a\nsheet of thin slightly frosted glass, such as that on which\nchildren trace pictures, and by fitting a pencil as one leg of\nthe autoscope. The pencil would leave a trace as it moved\nfrom letter to letter sufhciently clear, I imagine, to enable a\nshort message to be deciphered after the movement had ceased.\nThere are, of course, many other attendant circumstances that\nmight be varied. The field is a very wide one, and gives much\nscope for ingenuity in devising experiments. The purpose of\nthem should be primarily to ascertain the ohji'ctivc factors that\ndetermine the phenomena in question. The results would thus\nnot depend in any way on the veracity of the controls. Before\nwe proceed to the difficult task of trying to prove the identity\nof individual controls, it seems to me of paramount importance\nto study the nature of controls in general, and to find out\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Reseaixh. May-June, 1919.\nwhat are their powers and liTiiitations in so far as their activities\ncome witliin the scope of our experience. There is a tendency\nat present to concentrate attention on the subject matter of\nautomatic scripts and to pass by this other field for research.\nThere is, however, a real opportunity for systematic study in\nthe direction I have indicated. The mere task of setting out a\nscientifically arranged programme of experiments would in itself\nbe a labour of no small magnitude, and the execution of the\nwork would require the co-operation of many \"willing hands.\" ^\nG.

(Cassells.)\nTills brief notice of Mr. Hill's book must not be taken as a measure\nof its merits, unless it be in inverse ratio. One might go into\ndetail and write several pages, but it would come to the same\nthing ; one would only be saying at length what can be said\nin a single sentence,\u2014that the work is as admirable an intro-\nduction to the study of Psychical Research as could be wished,\nand a worthy successor to the valuable volumes on the same\nsubject that we have already had from the author's pen. One\nmay recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wishes to\nobtain in compact form a comprehensive account of what\n\"spiritualism\" ia, and what progress has been made in the\nstudy of it up to the present. A short resuint of the book's\ncontents will show how wide is the ground traversed. The\nmatter is divided into two parts. The First Part, entitled\n\"Historical and Evidential,\" comprises chapters on the early\nAntecedents of Modern Spiritualism, Swedenborg, Confluence\nof Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism in America, the Hydesville\nKnockings, Early Days in England, W. Stainton Moses, the\nSociety for Psychical Research, Physical Phenomena, Confirma-\ntory Phenomena in India, Ghosts, and Evidence, Proof and\nBelief. The Second Part, entitled \"Religious Aspect and\nCriticisms,\" deals with Spiritualism as a Religion, Materialistic\nand other Objections, Roman Catholic and Mystical Objections,\nSome Protestant Objections, Fechner's Theory of Life after\n^ Mr. Lambert hardly makes sufficient allowance for the extreme ditficulty\nof isolating such phenomena as tliose with which psychical research is cou-\ncerned, and determining which amf)ng a multitude of concomitant circumstances\nhave been crucial in the result oliserved. But doubtless it is desirable that\nsystematic experiments should be tried, so far as is possible, and we therefore\nprint Mr. Lambert's letter as indicating one or two directions in which an\nattempt might be made.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\fMay-June, 1919. Reviews. 71\nDeath, and Spiritualistic conceptions of After-Death Conditions.\nIn his final chapter Mr. Hill gives the conclusions at which\nhe himself has arrived. That he should carry his readers with\nhim to the adoption of all of them, he himself will not expect.\nWe have now left the objective for the subjective, and are\ndealing with questions on which there will be difference of\nopinion to the end of time. Tlius on one point, which this\nis not the place to discuss at any length, I find myself in\ncomplete disagreement with the authoT, and compelled to repeat\nwhat T think I have had occasion to say before in this\nconnexion. I cannot understand how \"spiritualism\" can be\nexalted into a religion, at least in any worthy sense of the\nlatter word ; more goes to the making of a religion than\nspiritualism can ever furnish. T fail to see liow it could even\nform a basis for religion. It has added nothing new to the\nChristian religion ; it has only furnished confirmation of\ncertain truths which have always been an integral part of it,\nand in the absence of which it would long ago liave fallen to\npieces. One other protest must be made On p. 5 Mr. Hill\nquotes from a book by \"a preacher and Principal of a\ntheological college,\" Dr. E. Griffith-Jones, as follows: \"Among\nthe reasons for the decay of the influence of the Christian\npulpit during the past generation, one is undoubtedly the\nfact that the doctrine of immortality has so largely lost its\nplace at the heart of the Christian message.\" This writer,\nwe must suppose, speaks from his own experience, but if he\nis speaking for the Church of England or tlie Church of\nRome, I cannot imagiiie a statement more preposterously\nnntrue.

Price\n3s. 6d. net.\nIn this volume Mrs, Travers Smith gives\u2014what one would\nexpect from a daughter of the late Professor Edward Dowden\nand wife of a Dublin physician \u2014a careful and critical account\nof her own psychical experiments, which have extended over the\nlast seven years. The method employed was that of the ouija\nboard, with two operators, usually a man and a woman, the\nlatter in most cases being Mrs. Smith. The letters were spread\non a table underneath a sheet of plate glass, and in some\nexperiments they were re-distributed so that the blindfolded\noperators did not know the position of any letter. Messages\neven under these conditions were rapidly spelt out by some of\nthe controls. But experience has shown the difficulty of complete\nblindfolding, and\u2014even when a screen was used as well\u2014the\nreader can never feel as sure as the experimenters perhaps quite\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. jnIay-June, 1919.\nlegitimately felt, that the letters were not seen, subliminally if\nnot pupraliminally. The evidence for supernormal faculty is\ntherefor\u00a9 mostly in the content of the messages.\nThe most striking cases are those of the pearl tie-pin (quoted\nin Sir W. F. Barrett's book On the Threshold of the Unseen,\na-nd briefly described in tlie review, Journal S.P.R., Vol. XVIII.,\np. 59) and of Sir Hugh Lane, who purported to communicate\nbefore the automatists became aware by normal means that he\nwas on the Lusitcmia. Mrs. Smith is \"almost convinced\" that\nthe communicator at this sitting and later ones\u2014when he\nexpressed emphatic wishes about the disposal of his pictures\n\u2014\nwas what he claimed to be : but she does not expect the sceptical\nreader to agree^ with her.\nThe regular \"controls\" were of the usual type: Peter Rooney,\nan Irisli American whose story about his deatli in Boston turned\ncut untrue ;\nEyeai\u2014an Egyptian priest of the time of Raraeses\nII. \u2014wlio was sentimental, suave, and unreliable, personating\nspirits whom he claimed to have brought ; Shamar, a Hindoo\nwoman, sensible and helpful; and so on. Thei:e persons'\nidentities being unverifiable, Mrs. Smith expresses no strong\nopinion, though she naturally finds it difficult to believe that\nthey are fractions of her own mind. \"Shamar\" has the\npeculiar power of \"bringing\" living people who are asleep, and\nthese often gave evidential messages, which they said they would\nforget on awaking. Some of the controls are good at psychometry\nalso, though in most cases the phenomena might be accounted\nfor by telepathy from one of those present.\nIt is to be hoped that Mrs. Smith will continue her investi-\ngations, for it is only by the study of a large collection of data\nthat we can expect to reach conclusions of any value. It is\nstill an open question whether in such phenomena we are dealing\nentirely with the subliminal levels of the automatists' minds, or\nwhether some external intelligence is at work ; but in either\ncase experiment should teach something, about discarnate minds\nor the methods of incarnate subliminals. In preparing any\nlater volumes Mrs. Smith will perhaps consider the desirabiUty\nof giving full accounts of all sittings, instead of extracts ; also\nof using \"sitter\" in the usual sense as meaning all those\nassisting at the experiment, rather than as meaning only those\noperating the traveller of the ouija-board, who may be called\nthe operators or automatists.\nSir William Barrett, who was present at many sittings,\ndiscusses in his Introduction the various theories of \"controls,\"\nand inclines to believe that some of them are separate entities.\nMost investigators v\/ill agree with him that we need to guard\nagainst using \"the subliminal self\" with a comfortable feeling\nthat we have thereby explained things. The tenn is useful, but\nit is often little more than a cloak for our ignorance.\n. .. J. Arthur Hill.\n\fNo. CCCLVII.\u2014Vol. XIX.

July, 1919.\nTHE \"MASKED MEDIUM.\"\nSome stir both in the press and in certain spiritist circles has\nbeen made recently by the performance of a lady under the above\ntitle at the Victoria Rooms of the Criterion, and later at the flat\nof the manager, Mr. Selbit. It might have been expected that\nthe claims of tliis lady, which included the power of describing-\nthe contents of a closed box filled with articles collected from the\naudience, and of producing a materialised spirit within the limits\nof time or with the regularity demanded hj the conditions of a\npublic performance, would have sufficed as a warning that the\nshow did not aim higher than to affoi'd an hour's pleasant mystifi-\ncation. And, if this were not enough, it might have been supposed\nthat the fact that Mr. Selldt himself is a well-known illusionist,\ndescribed in the telephone book as a \" Theatrical Novelty Pro-\nducer,\" would have daunted the faith of even the most robust\nbelievers. Judging, however, from the controversy that arose,\nand from the reports that we ourselves received from certain\nquarters, it is clear that the interest which has recently been-\naroused in spiritualism has not been accompanied l)y a correspond-\ning increase of the public critical faculty. It is, therefore, fortunate\nthat Mr. Selbit has had the candour to admit (see An Avwzing\nStance and an Exposure, by Sydney A. Moseley : Sampson Low,\nMarston & Co., p. 123) that the performance was \"engineered.\"\nThis admission is to Mr. Selhit's credit ; his show was ingenious,\nand his efforts were produced promptly and with scant attempt\nat mediumistic realism. If a certain temporary deception of the\nsimple has resulted, it would be unfair to hold Mr. Selbit himself\nas wholly responsible.\nCASES.\nI.\nL. 1226. Apparition at the Time op Death.\nThe foUo-^ving case of an apparition seen at the time of death\nhas reached us through Sir Oliver Lodge, to whom a report\nwas sent in the first instance. The apparition was that of\nLieut. David E. M'Connel, E.A.F., who was killed in a flying\naccident on December 7, 1918, and the percipient was one of his\n\fJuly, 1919. Gases. 77\nfellow-officers, Lieut. J. J. Laildn, R.A.F. The earliest report of\ntlie occurrence was contained in a letter to Sir Oliver Lodge from\nLieut. M'Comiers father, Mx. D. R. M'Connel, who writes thus :\nJanuary 16, 1919.\nKnowing your interest in psychical affairs, I take the liberty of\ngiving you the particulars of the reported appearance of my son\nat the time of his death through an accident while flying. T\nenclose the copy of the written statement of Lieut. Jas. J. Larkin\nof Scampton Aerodrome, to whom the appearance was made.\nI heard of the occurrence at my son's funeral on the 11th\nDecember (he was killed on the 7th December) and wrote as soon\nas I could to Lieut. Larkin, who replied on the 22nd December.\nThe statement made to me on the 11th by Lieut. Hillman, who-\nhas attested the correctness of the account given, corresponds\naccurately with the account itself. Lieut. Hillman had not\nbeen back to Scampton, or seen Lieut. Larkin, between the time\nof the funeral and the writing of the account. Lieut. Hillman\nwrote his attestation on reading the account in my house. The\nevent seems to have made a very vivid impression on the two or\nthree of my son's friends who heard of it. ... One other matter\nof fact I may mention. My son was fully dressed for flying,\nwith helmet, when he started. We happen to have a snapshot of\nhim taken by a fellow-officer just before he climbed into the\n\" camel \" which he flew. The account states that he \" appeared\n\"\nwith his naval cap on. My son began his flying career in March\nlast, entering through the R.N.A.S. before the amalgamation of the\nR.N.A.S. with the R.F.C. His elder brother had entered the\nR.N.A.S. and my son David was proud of his connection with\nthe earlier service. Having a complete kit of the naval flying\nservice, he always wore the naval flying uniform about the aero-\ndrome, and was one of only three at the drome who had followed\nthe same course in entering. His naval uniform was therefore\nwell known. It would not be at all an unusual thing that he\nshould have taken off his uncomfortable helmet on arriving back\nat the hangar, and exchanged it for his naval cap. Under the\ncircumstances, however, it is to be remarked that he wore his\nhelmet at the time of the accident ; and in the appearance to\nLieut. Larkin wore the naval cap. His mother informs me that\nhe was dressed, as usual, in his naval uniform below his flying\nthings, and that he had his naval cap with him in the fusilage\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1919.\nto wear on reaching Tadcaster\u2014the usual action. The O.C. states\nthat my son left Scampton for Tadcaster at 11.35 a.m. December\n7, '18.\nThe circumstances of the flight were as follows. My son, with\nother officers, had been to a dance at Lincoln on the night of the\n6th December. He got up rather late on the morning of the 7th,\nmissed parade, and also had no breakfast. The formal completion\nof all his tests for \" getting his wings \" were to take place on\nthe 7th. As the account states, he was on his way to start for\nthe Aerial Range to shoot off those final tests when he was\nasked by the O.C. to take one of two \" camels \" to Tadcaster.\nHe went therefore unexpectedly, rather fatigued, and without food.\nI may say here that his O.C. considered him a \" born flyer,\"\nand that he was a very cautious and careful flyer, though not\nshirking necessary risks. By most unusual favour, he had been\naccepted for permanent service before he had won his \" wings \"'\n\u2014\n-\nhad been nominated for an instructorship in flying, and was to\nhave left for the Camp of Instructors on the Monday following\nSa,turday, 7th December. The weather was fair when he left\nScampton to fly to Tadcaster, a distance of 60 miles. He was\naccompanied by another \" Avro \" plane\u2014a 2-seater\u2014which was to\nhave brought him back to Scampton after delivery of the \" camel.\"\nYou are probably aware that a \" camel \" scout plane is a\nnotoriously difficult and sensitive one, and requires continued\nstrain and effort to keep it down. At Doncaster the two planes\nran into fog. My son and his Avro companion descended, and my\nson described the situation to his flight commander and asked\nfor instructions by telephone. The reply was \" Use your own\ndiscretion.\" We suppose that my son's anxiety to finish his tests\nprompted him to continue. His companion states that neither of\nthem lunched at Doncaster. Between Doncaster and Tadcaster\nthe fog became very thick. The Avro man had to come down,\nand made a forced landing, successfully. My son circled round\nhim to see that he was all right and continued his flight to\nTadcaster. Sixty miles is not a long flight. But the fog was\nvery dense. In order to keep touch with the solid a flyer has\nto keep his plane under such circumstances about 150 ft. above\nthe surface of the ground\u2014a feat in a camel of considerable\ndifficulty.

Gases.\n3J to 3J hours on this occasion. I am told that it is as much\nas an ordinary flyer can do to fly a camel for 2 hours. The\nstrain on the arms is intense. In fact, his mother, who saw his-\nbody on Monday the 9th at midday, observed that his hands\nwere tightly clenched and his forearms swollen. As he at last\napproached the Tadcaster Aerodrome, the machine was seen approach-\ning by a man on the road about \\ mile distant from the camp, wha\nreported the fog to be extremely dense During the evidence at the\ninquest a girl, or young woman, said she was watching the plane,\nand saw it apparently \" side-slip,\" then right itself. It flew steadily\nfor a minute or two, then mounted suddenly and immediately \" nose-\ndived \" and crashed. The engine was full on when the crash occurred.\nMy son was thrown violently forward\u2014his head striking the gun\nbefore him, which was not hooded. One arm was broken, one\nleg was torn. The girl ran to the spot and \"found the officer dead.\"\nThe violence of contact seems to have stopped his watch, which\nregistered 3.25 p.m. His cigarette case was almost doubled up. These\nare the circumstances of the accident, so far as I am aware of them.\nI am informed by flying men that the reaction on reaching\nsafety after a difficult flight is so \" terrible,\" that fainting is not\nunknown. My son, it is thought, may have fainted ; hence the crash,\nand his inability to save himself. Or there was possibly engine\ntrouble. I am told also that when shot, or in danger, the immediate\nthought of the flyer is usually a quite trivial one, such as the sudden\ndesire for a cup of cocoa, or to get undressed at camp, etc. I mentioa\nthis because the \" appearance \" was not made at my son's home,,\nor to his mother, who was there at the time, but in his own\ncamp-room, and to a person who was a comparative stranger.\nHowever, his mother did have a strange impression at the hour\nof his death, of which she is writing an account herewith enclosed.^\nMy son had a happy, even joyous disposition. He had a brisk\nstep and manner which would account for the \" noise and clatter,'\"\nwhich Lieut. Larkin remarked and reports in his account. My\nson was 18 on the 15th April, 1918, having left Bedales School,\nHants, before military age, to enter the R.N.A.S. He had been\nheadboy at Bedales during that winter term.

He came into the room again at\n11.30 and told me that he did not go to the range, but that he\nw^as taking a \" camel \" to Tadcaster drome. He said, \" I expect\nto get back in time for tea. Cheero.\" He v\/alked out and half\na minute later, knocked at the window and asked me to hand\nhim out his map, which he had forgotten. After I had lunch,\nI spent the afternoon writing letters and reading, sitting in front\nof the stove fire. What I am about to say now is extraordinary\nto say the least, but it happened so naturally that at the time\nI did not give it a second thought. I have heard and read of\nsimilar happenings and I must say that I always disbelieved them\nabsolutely. My opinion had always been that the persons to whom\nthese appearances were given were people of a nervous, highly-\nstrung, imaginative temperament, but I had always been among\nthe incredulous ones and had been only too ready to pooh-pooh\nthe idea. I was certainly awake at the time, reading and smoking.\nI was sitting, as I have said, in front of the fire, the door of the\nroom being about eight feet away at my back. I heard someone\nwalking up the passage ; the door opened mth the usual noise\nand clatter which David always made ; I heard his \" Hello\nboy !\n\" and I turned half round in my chair and saw him standing\nin the doorway, half in and half out of the room, holding the\ndoor knob in his hand. He was dressed in his full flying clothes\nbut wearing his naval cap, there being nothing unusual in his\nappearance. His cap was pushed back on his head and he was\nsmiling, as he always was when he came into the rooms and\n\fJuly, 1919. Gases. 81\ngreeted us. In reply to his \" Hello boy !\n\" I remarked, \" Hello !\nback already ?\n\" He replied, Yes. Got there all right, had a\ngood trip.\" I am not positively sure of the exact words he used,\nbut he said, \" Had a good trip,\" or \" Had a fine trip,\" or words\nto that effect. I was looking at him the whole time he was\nspeaking. He said, Well, cheero !\n\", closed the door noisily and\nwent out. I went on with my reading and thought he had gone\nto visit some friends in one of the other rooms, or perhaps had\ngone back to the hangars for some of his flying gear, helmet,\ngoggles, etc., which he may have forgotten. I did not have a\nwatch, so could not be sure of the time, but was certain it v^as\nbetween a quarter and half-past three, because shortly afterwards\nLieut. Garner-Smith came into the room and it was a quarter\nto four. He said, \" I hope Mac (David) gets back early, we are\ngoing to Lincoln this evening.\" I replied, \" He is back, he was\nin the room a few minutes ago !\n\" He said, \" Is he having\ntea ?\n\" and I replied that I did not think so, as he (Mac) had\nnot changed his clothes, but that he was probably in some other\nroom. Garner-Smith said, \" I'll try and find him 1\n\" I then vfent\ninto the mess, had tea, and afterwards dressed and went to\nLincoln. In the smoking room of the Albion Hotel I heard a\ngroup of officers talking, and overheard their conversation and the\nwords \" crashed \" \" Tadcaster \" and \" M'Connel.\" I joined them\nand they told me that just before they had left Scampton, word\nhad come through that M'Connel had \" crashed \" and had been\nkilled taking the \" Camel \" to Tadcaster. At that moment I did\nnot beUeve it, that he had been killed on the Tadcaster journey.\nMy impression was that he had gone up again after I had seen\nhim, as I felt positive that I had at 3.30. Naturally I was eager\nto hear something more definite, and later in the evening I heard\nthat he had been killed on the Tadcaster journey. Next morning,\nGarner-Smith and I had a long discussion about my experience.\nHe tried to persuade me that I must have been mistaken, that\nI had not actually seen Mac on the previous afternoon about\n3.30, but I insisted that I had seen him. As you can understand,\nMr. M'Connel, I was at a loss to solve the problem. There was\nno disputing the fact that he had been killed whilst flying to\nTadcaster, presumably at 3.25, as we ascertained afterwards that\nhis watch had stopped at that time.

We had lots of discussions, political, social, and\neducational, but not once did we discuss anything bordering on\nthe occult or spiritual. Had we done so, I would perhaps have\nbeen able to account, in a measure, for his appearance in this\nroom at the time of his death. As it is, I have no explanation\nwhatever to offer.\nJas. J.

Garner -Smith's corroborative statement supplies evi-\ndence that Lieut. Larkin had identified the man who entered\nhis room on December 7, 1918. as Lieut. M'Connel before he\ncould have had any normal knowledge of the accident which\nhad only just occurred. The identification cannot therefore\nbe due to any trick of memory consequent on the news\nof the accident. That being so, the only normal ex-\nplanation which could be made to cover the facts would be\none of mistaken identity. It was with this possibility in mind\nthat we questioned Lieut. Larkin concerning the lighting of the\nroom. Obviously such a mistake would be far more likely to\noccur in a dim light. Lieut. Larkin's reply on this point is\nsatisfactory. The light, he tells us, was good, and under these\ncircumstances it is very difficult to suppose that Lieut. Larkin\ncould mistake a man, with whom he actually had conversation\nat a distance of only a few feet, for another man with whose\nvoice and appearance he was perfectly familiar. A further\nargument against the theory of mistaken identity is that\nLieut. Larkin observed that the man who entered his room\nwas wearing a naval cap.

Telepathic.\nA REPORT of the following case appeared in the Weslminster-\nCathedral Chronicle for March, 1919, and we are indebted\nto the Editor for permission to print it here. The names.\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1919.\nand addresses of all those concerned have been given to us,\nbut are withheld by request.\nThe report in the Westminster Cathedral Chronicle, which\nwe have slightly abbreviated, ran as follows :\nOne afternoon a short time back Fr. Brompton (to give the\npriest a fictitious name) was requested to visit a lady who was\nill. When he arrived at lier house he met the doctor who\nvery urgently requested him not to administer the last rites at\nthat particular moment, but to be satisfied with giving the patient\na few clieeriug words. He very reluctantly consented but, when\nhe saw the lady, greatly regretted his promise and the fact that\nthe doctor should have made such a request, as he feared that\nthe patient vras very much worse than he had been made to\nunderstand. However, his promise had been given ; so he arranged\nthat he would come again in the morning and administer the Last\nSacraments. Before he left the house, however, he gave the nurse\nhis telephone number and asked her to telephone should the\npatient become suddenly worse before the morning.\nAs usual, that night the telephone was switched on to one\nof the Father's rooms, as is the custom at the Oratory, with\na view to any jiossible sick-calls. Fr. Brompton retired to bed\nat his usual hour after reciting his rosary, in which he did not\nforget to include his patient of the afternoon. In the early\nmorning he was startled out of a deep sleep by his bedroom\ndoor opening, and saw, by the hght of the moon through his\nopen, uncovered window, a medium-sized, dark-robed figure stand-\ning by it, and understood the person to say something about\na sick-call.\n\" For heaven's sake, man,\" he hastily answered, sitting up\nin bed and rubbing his eyes, not quite sure if it was the Father\n-on duty or the lodge porter, \" speak clearly.\"'\n\" Be quick !\n\" came the reply in clearer tones. \" There is\nno time to lose. There is a telephone message.\"\n\" Right\u2014right 3^ou are !\n\"'\nat once answered Fr. Brompton.\nThe word \" telephone \" brought back in a moment to his mind\nthe sick-call of the previous afternoon, and it did not therefore\noccur to him to ask for the address. He sprang out of bed\n\u2014\nthe door closed as he did so. Turning on the light, he observed\nthat it was just on the quarter to four. He quickly dressed,\nand went to the chapel for the Holy Oils and the Blessed Sacra-\n\fJuly, 1919. Gases. 85\nment, remarking, by the way, on the forgetfulness of his caller\nto turn on the light for him. Making his way swiftly across\nthe space between the house and the gates that shut it oS\nfrom the main road, he found them locked as they should be,\nand had to knock up the lodge porter to let him out. Within\na minute or two he was well on his way to the house he had\nvisited the previous afternoon, and as he waited after his first\nring at the bell and congratulated himself on his smart arrival,\nhe looked at his watch and saw that it still wanted five minutes\nto four. He rang again\u2014and again. . . A clock in the vicinity\nchimed the hour. He rang and knocked. Strange that there\nis no one ready to answer the door after telephoning,\" he thought.\nIn the stillness of the moonlight night he thought he was making\nenough noise to wake the dead. The dead ! Could the worst\nhave happened ? His regret of yesterday came upon him with\nsudden force, so that he became alarmed. He banged at the\ndoor. The electric light was on in the hall and on the stairs,\nas he could see. He knew that there were only six people in\nthe house\u2014the sick lady in one room, her husband, given up\nas hopeless, in another, two day nurses (now evidently in a\nsound sleep), and the two night nurses in attendance on the\npatients. The children had all safely recovered from influenza\nand had been taken elsewhere. ... A clock chimed the quarter\npast. At last, to the priest's great rehef, the door opened.\n\"Come in, doctor,\" said a nurse; \"I fear you have been kept\n-waiting.\"\n\" I am not the doctor ; I'm a priest.\"\n\" Oh, I suppose they telephoned for you ? That's bad news.\nWill you go up 1\n\"\nFr. Brompton made his way up to the sick-room, and as\nhe quietly entered he saw the nurse kneeling by the Ijedside\nand noticed that she was very startled as he entered. He also\nheard the sick person saj^ng : \"I do wish Fr. Brompton would\ncome.\" Afterwards he learned that for the space of about half\nan hour before his arrival the lady had been expressing a wish\nto see him. The nurse, not being a Catholic, and not reahsing\nthat a priest would come outside the ordinary hours, suggested\nthat she should recite some prayers from a Catholic prayer-\nbook. Fr. Brompton arrived while she was doing this. He\n. at once gave the lady the Last Sacraments, much to her rehef\n-and peace of mind. Within an hour or two she became un-\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1919.\nconscious. After reciting the prayers for the dying, the priest\nprepared to leave the house.\n\" Thank you so much for coming so opportunely,\" said the\nnurse, \" but you quite startled me.\"\n\" On the contrary, thanks are due to you for telephoning.\"\n\" Oh, but I didn't !\n\"\n\" Well, someone did. I expect it was Mrs. 's sister.\"\nAs the nurses were not Catholics, the priest took it that one\nof the lady's relations had telephoned in her anxiety about her\nsister. Fr. Brompton heard that she died a few hours later. She-\nbecame a Catholic at the age of eighteen, and had been an\nexcellent one up to her pious death at the age of thirty-two.\nIn the evening of the same day, Fr. Brompton had occasion\nto speak to the Father whose duty it had been to answer the\ntelephone, and in the course of conversation said :\n\" By the way, I'm sorry I spoke to you so sharply last\nnight.\"\n\" Why, when do you mean ?\n\"\n\" When you came to call me.\"\n\" But I never called you last nightl\n\"\n\" My dear Father, you came to my room at a quarter to\nfour this morning and told me there was a telephone sick-call.\"\n\" I never left my room last night. I had a sleepless night\nand happened to note that I was awake at that very time,\nas I had my light on. And what is more, there was no telephone-\ncall last night \/\n\"\nIn the above story it should be borne in mind that Fr. Bromp-\nton had had no reason, up to the moment he spoke to the\nFather responsible for the night telephone, to suppose that any-\nthing unusual had happened. He had had a sick-call in the\nafternoon and would return the following morning in the ordinary\nway. He mentioned the sick person in his prayers as was his.\nwont in such cases. He made no special preparations before\ngoing to bed. He was awakened by his door being suddenly\nopened. He took the caller to be the Father on duty, and^\nwere it not that he knew it could not have been the lodge-\nporter, would not have spoken to the Father at all. It was.\nonly because he considered he had spoken roughly to him when,,\nas he presumed, he had called him, that he referred to the-,\nmatter at all when speaking to him on other business.

The above narrative correctly states my being called by\nFather [X.] in the early morning of November 22nd, 1918.\n[Father Brompton.]\n2.

A. W.\nIn reply to a further question concerning the nature of\nhis experience Father Brompton wrote :\nMarch 2lst, 1919.\nYou ask me whether the manner of my being called was a\nunique experience. There was nothing unique to me in the\nmanner of the call, it came like dozens of other sick-calls ; but\nwhat was, and is a unique experience to me is the denial of the\nperson who called me.\n[Father Brompton.]\nIt cannot be clearly determined whether Father Brompton's\nexperience was in the nature of an unusually vivid dream or an\nhallucination, that is, whether he was awake or asleep at the time.\nAccording to his own account he woke to see a figure stand-\ning by his door and heard it speak to him. But evidently\nupon such a point a mistake might easily occur ; it may\nbe that Father Brompton woke only at the moment when\nhe jumped from bed, at which time, he tells us, his bed-\nroom door was closed and the figure had vanished. The\norigin of his impression, whether dream or hallucination,\nwould appear to have been telepathic.\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1919.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo The Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\n\"THE HYENAS OP PIRRA.\"\nDear Madam,\u2014May I, through your Journal, call attention\nto an article in the Conihill Magazine for October, 1918>\nentitled \" The Hyenas of Pirra,\" by Mr Richard Bagot. My\nreasons are a hope that some of our members may be able\nto throw further light on this interesting subject, and a possi-\nbility that some day there may be a further investigation. There\nis here a chance that might add much to our knowledge ; at\nthe least it would clear up an error which bears on one like\nan evil dream.\nThe subject of the article is the supposed power of some indi-\nviduals of a race in N. Nigeria to change into animal form,\na somewhat startling proposition though not unknown to legend.\nMr. Bagot's article describes some experiences reported by Lieut.\nF. personally, and an experience of the late Capt Shott, D.S.O.\nWith variation of detail both narratives deal with the killing\nof natives when in the form of supj^osed hyenas. There is so\nmuch in the details which excludes commonplace explanations,\nand the Officers to whom the experiences happened seemed so\ndeeply impressed with what they learned on further inquiry,\nthat one is led to wonder whether here is not some new psycho-\nphysiological phenomenon. Can there, in other words, be any\nreal, solid, actual truth in the idea that men can at will put\noff their bodily form and take on another, and that the body\nof a ravening beast ?\nOf the accounts themselves the main facts are as follows.\nRaiding hyenas were wounded by gun-traps, and tracked in\neach case to a point where the hyena traces ceased and were\nsucceeded by human foot-])rints, which made for the native\ntown. At each shooting a man mysteriously dies in the town,\nall access being refused to the body. In Lieut. F 's exper-\niences the death wail was raised in the town almost immediately\nafter the shot, but Capt. Shott does not mention this. In Capt.\nShott's experience the beast was an \" enormous brute,\" readily\ntrackable, which after being hard hit made off through the\nguinea-corn. It was promptly tracked, and a spot was come\nupon where \" they found the jaw of the beast lying near a large\npool of blood.\" Soon after the tracks reached a path leading\n\fJuly, 1919. Correspondence. 89\nto the native town. The natives next day came to Capt. Skott\n\u2014and this is the curious part of the afiair\u2014and told him, with-\nout any regrets, that he had shot the Nafada\u2014a lesser head-\nman\u2014who was then lying dead mth his jaw shot away. The\nnatives gave their reasons as having seen and spoken to the\nNafada as he was, by his own admission, going into the bush.\nThey heard the gun and saw him return ^^-ith his head all\nmuflfled up and walking like a very sick man. On going next\nmorning to see what was the matter\u2014he had turned out all\nhis women on returning\u2014they found him as stated. The Nafada\nhad a bad reputation and was a noted \"hyena man;\" having\npower to change himself into a particularly large and cunning\nspecimen of the animal. Capt. Shott confessed that he was\nconverted from being a very sceptical soldier into rather more\nthan a half beUever in the strange powers claimed by certain\nof the natives in these districts. He also details the reasons\nwhy other shootings could not have been accomitable for the\ndeaths. For fuller details I must refer the reader to the\narticle itself, as it is not my point here to contest the record.\nIt is for reason of the many weird things which come to us\nfrom Africa from time to time that I think investigation of\nsuch a case as this last would be of service to science, and\nto psychic knowledge. If the phenomena are genuine, it seems\nthe changes must be the result of some power of de-materialis-\ning and re-materialising in a lower form\u2014is it always higher\nto lower ? \u2014one can hardly come to any other conclusion.\nBut what does this mean when turning to the j)sychic side,\nand can we solemnly face such an idea ? It may be quite worth\nwhile to glance at this aspect of the problem, assuming some-\nthing really to lie behind_ the reports, especially as several phases\ncome to the mind. In my own case first thoughts went to\nthe Theosophist teaching of collective soul in the lower ranges\nof animal Life. If by soul we here xmderstand the astral element\nof self\u2014and I cannot recall having heard any clear differenti-\nation made between them\u2014then it would seem that the same\nelement divided among the many becomes later a single entity\nin each higher individual. Such a theory would require a long-\nevolutionary period to effect the change in growth, and we might\nassume a wide borderland within which a tendency to go back\nto the former or lower state occasionally obtained. Could this\nbe an explanation in the present case ? It is not easy to visu-\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1919.\nalise so tremendous a process as the astral change or how it\nworked in physiological detail ; but no doubt, in the flesh, the\nmotive would be some deep racial instinct not yet quite extinct.\nThe tribe in question, we are told, were hardly if at all meat-\neaters, yet the man returns to the beast to hunt and eat flesh\nand even carrion. But it could hardly be this one desire which\nactuated the change, as that desire could more easily be satis-\nfied without it. The tendency would have to lie in some cause\nmuch deeper, such as the older racial instinct overmastering the\nnewer evolution. In the vast periods of time and change required\nfor Nature's processes no hard line of demarcation seems allowable,\nand if such a border-land existed to our comprehension now, no\ndoubt many strange and interesting things might be witnessed.\nWhen we come to think of the practical happenings, and\nstill assuming the changes to have taken place, we are in the\npresence of some very weird ideas. How, for instance, was the\nmaterial body changed, and what became (or becomes) of matter\nextraneous to, or not part of the body itself, such as food in\nthe stomach. In the changing back it would, after successful killing\nor finding, be considerable in quantity and even poisonous to\nthe reassumed man-body. Clothing also\u2014though that could\nbe discarded and resumed\u2014if missed on the return, might lead\nto discovery, for evidently the natives generally looked on the\n\" hyena-men \" as evil doers. In Capt. Shott's instance the man\nreturned all muffled up, and he could not have known of his\ncoming misfortune and need of wrappings. The whole thing seems\ntoo fantastic to discuss, but yet it does seem imperative to think\nabout it, if only to clear it all up. Again, the detached jaw ;\nwhy\nwas this discarded ? Is there a certain point beyond which the astral\nor other forces are unable to control the matter under change ?\nSurely so stupendous a power could control so small a detail,\nconsidering the magnitude of what was being done. To question\nfurther still : why was the man killed at all ? You cannot,\nso we are taught, kill the astral-body ;\nyet the man dies after\nthe change and without his jaw. Have we to assume that the\njaw was so far detached as to be killed at or before the moment\nof change ? If then the beasts had been shot dead what would\nhave happened ? It seems clear from the records that in these,\nand other native cases reported, the beings did not die as hyenas\nbut as men in their homes ; no dead hyena seems ever to have\nbeen found ; and only, in this one case, the dead jaw.\n\fJULT, 1919. Correspondence. 91\nAs Lieut. F. remarks, \" these experiences prove nothing ; but\nthey certainly give food for much thought,\" and as I think\nso too I have ventured to write this letter, in the hope, as\nI have said before, that some of our members more qualified\nto think with effect may be interested to enlighten us. There\nare of course many more incidents in the article than space\nallows me to mention.\nJohn Mostyx Clarke.\nEditorial Note.\u2014The evidence detailed in the original article in the\n\" Cornhill Magazine\" is certainly of a reimtrkahle character, and after\nreceiving Mr. Mostijn Clarke's letter we wrote to Mr. Richard Bagot,\nwho is himself a member of the Society, to ask whether he had\nreceived any information throwing further light wpon the matter.\nIn his reply Mr. Bagot said that he had not so far heard any-\nthing more, and he continued :\nI may add that in the article in question I merely reproduced\nverbatim the reports and letters sent to the said official [a friend\nof Mr. Bagot's who occupies one of the most important Govern-\nment posts in Northern Nigeria \"] by British officers well known\nto him, and that the authenticity and good faith of the writers\ncan be vouched for entirely. I have evidence of precisely similar\noccurrences that have come under the notice of Italian officials\nin Eritrea and Somaliland ; and in all cases it would seem\nthat a gravel patch thrown up by the small black ants is neces-\nsary to the process of metamorphosis. I drew the attention\nof Sir James G. Frazer (author of The Golden Bough) to this\ncoincidence, and asked him if he had come across in his researches\nanything which might explain the connection between gravel\nthrown up by ants and the j^ower of projection into animal\nforms ; but he informed me that, so far as he could recollect,\nhe had not done so. Italian officials and big game hunters\nassure me that it is considered most dangerous (by the natives\nin Somahland, Abyssinia, etc.) to sleep on ground thrown up\nby ants ; the belief being that any one who does so is liable\nto be \" possessed \" or obsessed by some wild animal, and that\nthis obsession having once taken place, the victim is never after-\nwards able entirely to free himself from it, and is compelled\nperiodically to assume the form and habits of some beast or\nreptile\nRichard Bagot.\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Price,\n10s. 6d.)\nMr. Carrington divides his book into two Parts, deahng with\nthe normal and supernormal aspects of the psychology of the\nwar. In Part One are described the soldier's attitude ard\nsensations during training and actual fighting, illustrated by\nletters home ; shell-shock is described, and allusion made to\nthe remarkable efficacy of suggestive methods of cure ; and\na chapter is given to German mentality and its gospel of fright-\nfulness. Part Two reviews almost the whole field of psychical\nresearch, from telepathy and apparitions to mediumistic messages,\nmaterialization, and vampires. Many interesting cases are quoted\nfrom various sources, of premonitions of death and its exact\nmanner, veridical apparitions of soldiers killed, and the like ;\nsome are from the Journal S.P.R., and Phantasms of the\nLiving ;\nmany of the others are not very well authenticated.\nBut even popular presentation of such cases has its use, for\nit trains the public in the estimation of evidence, a \" good\n\"\ncase showing up the lacunae of an adjoining weak one. Such\neducation is important, for it will help readers who become\npercipients of any psychical phenomenon to present it in as\nscientific a shape as possible.

Jung (of Zurich) read a paper on \" The Psycho-\nlogical Foundations of the Belief in Spirits,\" which, it is hoped,\nwill be published later in the Proceedings.\nA SUPPOSED \" POLTERGEIST \" CASE AND ITS\nEXPLANATION.\nThere have recently appeared in the Times reports of\nmysterious \" oil spurts in a Norfolk rectory.\" These pheno-\nmena occurred at the residence of the Rev. Hugh Guy, rector\nof Swanton Novers, near Melton Constable. Several investi-\ngators were called in, including Mr. Maskelyne, the well-known\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1919.\nillusionist, and various tentative exj^lanations were put forward,\nbut the origin of the phenomena remained obscure until they\nwere at last traced to a servant-girl of fifteen, employed at the\nRectory, who confessed to having produced them.\nA brief report of the phenomena appeared in the Times of\nAugust 30, 1919 ; the matter was discussed at greater length\non September 1st by Mr. Cloudesley Brereton, who had visited\nthe house, and on September 2nd a long report was printed from\na \"special correspondent,\" a part of which we give below :\nOn August 8, when there was a big explosion in France, earth\ntremors were felt at the village of Swanton Novers, and early in\nthe afternoon five greasy blotches appeared on the scullery wall\nof the house. At the same time, an odour of sandalwood oil was\nnoticed to be hanging about the garden. Although these mani-\nfestations aroused comment, no special signification was attached\nto them, and the following day the family left the village for a\nfortnight's holiday. If anything occurred dm-ing the period when\nthe house was closed it was not of a startling kind, but on\nAugust 23, when the rector returned home, water with a faint\ntrace of paraffin began to drip from the scullery ceiling. This was\nregarded as a matter for the local plumber, who was duly called\nin, but failed to discover the leaking pipe. On the following day\nwater fell from the ceiling of the maid's bedroom. The girl was\ntransferred to a bed placed in the bathroom, but immediately she\ngot there a fresh shower of oil and water occurred.\nThe situation rapidly became worse during last week. First the\ndining room, then the drawing room and bed-rooms were affected.\nVisitors who had come to stay with the rector had to leave.\nMr. Guy's two young nieces were driven from their rooms by\nanother shower of oil on their beds. On Wednesday oil and water\nspoiled the breakfast table cloth. \" In the scullery,\" the rector\ntold me, \" we were practically flooded out. The stuff came from\nthe ceiling in gallons. We made a hole through the floor above\nit, to discover the source of the downpour, to find even the laths\nto be dry. More extraordinary than anything is the fact that\nsince this hole was made not a drop of water or paraffin has\nfallen through it, but there have been drippings from other parts\nof the ceiling. The further end of the week the house had become\nuninhabitable. Much of the oil we find is highly inflammable.\"\n\fOct., 1919. A Supposed \" Poltergeist \" Case. 9T\nAbout five this afternoon, while Mr. Guy was showing me over\nthe almost empty rectory, a furniture remover let us know that a\nfresh shower had taken place in the kitchen. I went to look at\nwhat was happening, and saw that the floor was splashed with\nwater, and that a fresh discoloured patch about 18 in. long had\nappeared on the ceiling. From this spot half a dozen oily globules\nwere suspended, and occasionally one of these fell. There was a\nstrong smell of paraffin about the room, but that was general\nthroughout the house. The \" manifestation \" could have been\ncaused by some person thromng up a cupful of oil and paraffin,\nbut who would do this ?\nOne matter which requires clearing up is that the appearances\nof the oil are limited to the daytime, and are almost exclusively\nconfined to rooms where a little 15-year-old girl servant chances\nto be. \" The maid seems to act like a water diviner,\" the rector\nsaid. I noticed the girl to-day, and should not suspect her of any\ninclination towards practical joking.\nThe distribution of the various liquids which have been collected\nin the house was given to me as follows :\nDining room\u2014paraffin and petrol.\nDrawing room\u2014some paraffin.\nKitchen\u2014petrol, paraffin and water.\nScullery\u2014sandalwood oil, petrol, methylated spirits, paraffin,\nwater.\nBed-rooms\u2014water and paraffin.\nBath room\u2014water and paraffin.\nHall\u2014petrol, paraffin, water.\nWell\u2014paraffin.\nThere was another shower of the oil which is regarded as\nsandalwood this morning. This is only the second time this oil\nhas been seen.\nAmong the theories put forward were (a) a leakage through\nthe ground of paraffin from the village shop three hundred\nyards away, (6) a leakage from the petrol lighting-system\nestablished at the Rectory, (c) the existence under the Rectory\nof oil-bearing strata, such as those found at East Winch and\nelsewhere in Norfolk. None of these explanations, however,\nappeared to cover the ground. They did not, for example,\nexplain the traces of sandalwood oil found on two occasions,\nto say nothing of other considerable difficulties.\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1919.\nOn September 9, 1919, the following statement appeared in\nthe Times :\nThe Swanton Novers oil \" mystery \" has at last been solved.\nIt is due to a hoax perpetrated by a young servant girl, aged 15,\nemployed by the rector, the Rev. H. Guy, and his wife.\nMr. Oswald Williams, the illusionist, who is holiday-making at\nCromer, proffered his assistance to Mr. Guy, who, on his suggestion\ndismissed the girl for three days and caused the house to be shut\nup rigorously. During this interval no liquid fell. In the mean-\ntime, Mr. Williams cut off the water supply and removed all\nliquids from the premises except that he bestowed about the\nrooms haphazard several pails containing water strongly salted\nwith common table salt. On the return of the girl yesterday\nmorning she reported two more falls of liquid. This was found by\nMr. Guy to be salted water.\nNo accusation was then made against the girl, it being thought\nbest to await the return of Mr. and Mrs. Williams, who were due\nto arrive from Cromer again during the afternoon. Mr. Williams,\nMr. and Mrs. Guy, and two other persons then went into one of\nthe front rooms. Mrs. Williams proceeded quietly to an upper\nroom above the kitchen, the ceiling of which had been torn away\nby explorers seeking for the cause of the mystery. As the floor\nboards of the upper room had also been removed, there was an\naperture through which Mrs. Williams, by exercising great caution,\ncould see what was happening below. She plainly saw the girl\ntake up a glass and throw some of the salted water up to the\nceiling. She at once raised the alarm, and finally the girl, after\nfirst denying her hoax, made a clean breast of the matter in the\npresence of the whole of the party, and burst into tears.\nThe rector has addressed a note to Mr. Williams thanking him\nfor his timely aid, and making public acknowledgment of his\ngratitude for the sympathy and interest manifested towards him\nin a time of great difficulty.\nOn September 12, 1919, a letter from the rector of Swanton\nNovers, written on September 11, appeared in the Times, from\nwhich we quote the following extract:\nI might mention that directly the house was reopened last\nMonday morning [September 8], and before Mr. Williams arrived,\nthree splashes had occurred about 11.30 a.m., to which Mrs. Guy\n(alone at the time) had her attention drawn by the maid, who\n\fOct., 1919. Case. 99\nstated that the atmosphere had caused it. Mrs. Guy heard the\nbowl of water being moved from the sink, the water splash, and\nthe bowl replaced with noise in the sink. She secretly tasted it,\nand found it was salted. According to plan, she did not there\nand then accuse the girl, but waited the arrival of Mr. Williams\nand his party. I might add that on coming to the rectory at\n12.30 by the kitchen I tasted the spilt water myself, and corro-\nborated the facts. After the girl was caught I fetched both her\nparents, who were very upset at first, and refused to believe that\nthe girl was guilty ; but in face of the evidence, and in spite of\nthe girl's denials, they agreed mth our views\u2014expressing great\nregret, and ofiering to do all in their power to make good the\ndamage. Mrs. PhilUps\u2014the mother\u2014spontaneously ofEered to come\nand clean the house, and Mr. Phillips stated that he would move\nback all our things himself.\nSince then their feelings have been completely reversed, doubt-\nless owing to some outside influences.\nLastly, I am glad to have the opportunity of recording these\nfacts, as it may be of use to others placed in similarly strange\ncircumstances, and save them from much trouble, worry and\ninconvenience, not to mention the expense.\n(Sgd.) Hugh Guy.\nP.S.\u2014l have just discovered that the packing of the pump was\nsaturated with paraffin. This would account for the oil getting\ninto the well.\nIn view of the statements given above there can be little\ndoubt, in spite of the girl's subsequent denials, that the\nphenomena were due to her direct agency and no further\nexplanation need be sought. We print this report of the case\nas furnishing a good example of the kind of deceit against\nwhich investigators of such phenomena must be on their\nguard.\nP. 291.\nCASE.\nThe following case was reported to us by the percipient\nherself, who has been for some years an associate of the\nSociety and related her experience to the Secretary on\nFebruary 21, 1919. Afterwards, at the Secretary's sugges-\ntion, she sent us a written statement with corroboration.\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1019.\nThe experience appears to have beeu of a premonitory char-\nacter, but regarded simply as a premonition it is not very\nstriking and might be accounted for by chance-coincidence.\nWhat lends interest to the mcident and seems to make it\nworth recording, is the curious form in which the impression\nwas received. It appears to have been an automatism of\nspeech, and the percipient informs us that it is unique in\nher experience. The names and addresses of all persons con-\ncerned have been given to us, but by request pseudonyms or\ninitials are here substituted. The percipient, Mrs. McKenzie\n(pseudonjon) describes her experience thus :\nApril Uh, 1919.\nAbout two years ago I was sitting alone in my room at home,\nwhen I became aware quite suddenly that the muscles of\nmy throat and tongue were being used\u2014compressed\u2014by some\nenergy quite apart from myself\u2014and I heard myself say aloud\nthe words :\n\" [Angus (pseudonym)], D.S.O.\"\nThe sensation was so extraordinary that I spoke of it to my\nchildren. A will other than my own controlled my muscles,,\nwhile I was wide awake, seated in my arm-chair, and so far\nas my recollection serves not thinking of my sons at all. The\nwords did not arise in my mind, they were spoken without\nany sort of volition on my part.\nI had three sons serving\u2014two on the active list, one not yet\npassed fit after being on Gallij^oli\u2014my sons had all been on Gallipoli\nand all suffered from severe illness contracted there. [Angus] in\nparticular, though able to return to active service, never went\ninto the trenches without shortly having a recurrence of dysentery\nfever, or being wounded\u2014so much so that his hard luck had\nbecome proverbial in the family, and we felt that he had less\nchance than most people of gaining distinction. The words\nspoken seemed to us very unlikely to have any practical signi-\nficance. He was wounded for the third time on the 4th Novem-\nber 1918.\nTowards the end of January this year my husband received\na letter from [Angus] in which he said :\n\" One of Mother's dreams\nhas come true and I have been awarded the D.S.O.\"\nMy daughter and I were together upstairs, and my husband\ncalled the news to us, and my daughter instantly reminded me\nof what my tongue had said.\n\fOct., 1919. Case. 101\nThis son is the only one who has gained any decoration.\nI enclose a letter from a niece who has lived with us during\nthe war to whom I mentioned the incident and also one from\nmy son.\n[E. M. McKenzie.]\nThe following corroborative statement was enclosed from\nLt. Angus McKenzie (pseudonym) :\nFebruary 26, 1919.\nI remember some time ago that my Mother said she had\nreceived an intimation of some sort that I should receive the\nD.S.O.\nI remembered the incident sufficiently clearly to refer to it\nwhen I wrote to tell my Father that I had been awarded\nthis order. [Angus McKenzie,] Lt.\nA further corroborative statement was received from a\nniece to whom Mrs. McKenzie had related her experience\nbefore its verification, thus :\nFebruary 24, 1919.\nAbout a year and a half ago my aunt Mrs. [McKenzie] told\nme of a curious thing that had happened to her while she was at\nhome in Argyleshire.\nShe said that when she had been sitting in her room one\nday she had had a curious feeling in her throat and she was\nforced to say aloud \"[Angus], D.S.O. ,\" nothing more. She was\nvery diffident about telling me, as she said it was such an un-\nconnected thing, and was forced from her in such a jerky manner\nentirely as if some one else was using her throat muscles.\nWhen I heard that her son [Angus] had been awarded the\nD.S.O. I at once remembered what she had told us. M. E. H.\nCOEEESPONDENCE.\nI.\n\" The Reality of Psychical Phenomena.\"\nTo The Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014Mr. Whately Smith in his interesting paper {Proc,\nVol. XXX., pp. 306-333) on Dr. Crawford's remarkable experi-\nments on \" Physical \" phenomena remarks that \" results of similar\nimportance would not be unreservedly accepted by Physicists\nwithout thorough confirmation by independent investigators.\"\n\f102 Journal oj Society for PsycJiical Research. Oct., i919.\nA careful perusal of Dr. Crawford's book should convince any\none who has some slight familiarity with experimental work, and\nwho has no great a priori objections to these phenomena, that\nthe results given are substantially accurate, the more so in view\nof the wide margins which Dr. Crawford allows for instrumental\nand observational errors. Still to the ordinary reader, the hypo-\nthesis of illusion is always available as an explanation though, as\nwas clearly shown in Count Solovovo's paper (Proc, Vol. XXI.,\npp. 436-482), this hypothesis is untenable when the movement of\ninanimate objects is efiected. Still, confirmation is indeed very\nnecessary. It cannot be said that the occurrence of these pheno-\nmena is yet evidentially established as a fact. The presumption\nin their favour (owing largely to Dr. Crawford's work) is, however,\nso significant, that it is a matter of prime importance to establish\nthem beyond the possibility of refutation. When this is done,\nand not until then, we may profitably begin to frame theories to\nexplain the modus operandi of these occurrences.\nConfirmation\u2014employing the same medium and circle without\nwhich any results could not be strictly comparable\u2014is difficult.\nThe introduction of new observers appeared very often to have an\nadverse effect on the production of phenomena.\nWe have however a ready, and equally, if not more, satis-\nfactory, means of confirmation by the use of automatic recording\napparatus to register the various motions and efforts which, in\nDr. Crawford's experiments, were recorded only by visual in-\nspection. Such apparatus is already available which permits of\nthe synchronous registration of pressures, muscular efforts, etc.,\nwith far greater delicacy than is possible with the spring-balances,\nand other somewhat crude and insensitive apparatus, used by\nDr. Crawford.\nI have lately been reading M. Jules Amar's book Le Moteur\nHumain (of which a translation is about to be issued by Messrs.\nRoutledge). In this book considerable sjjace is devoted to the\npneumatic method of measuring efforts and j^ressures, due to the\nFrench physicist Marey.\nIn outline the method consists in providing a \" tambour \" (a\nsmall vessel with an elastic diaphragm), or a rubber bulb at the\nplace where the pressure is to be measured. The j^ressure to be\nmeasured acts either directly, or through springs, on the tambour\nor bulb. The latter is connected by a rubber tube, which can,\nif required, be of considerable length, to a similar tambour whose\n\fOct., 1919. Corres'po'iidence. 1U3\ndiapkragm actuates a style. The movement of this style is\nobviously proportional to the pressure exerted on the bulb or\ntambour. By the interposition of suitable springs, bet-\u00ab\"een the\npoint of application of the pressure and the rubber bulb, quite\nconsiderable pressures (as much as 15 Kg. in Amar's experiments)\ncan be dealt with, -R-hile by allowing the pressure to act directly\non the transmitting tambour, and increasing the length of the\nstyle actuated by the receiving tambour, very .small pressures can\nbe made to give movements of convenient amplitude.\nSeveral sets of receiving apparatus are mounted on a shde in\nfront of a recording drum (similar to that used for chionographic\nmeasurements of very short duration). The shde is traversed in\na definite relation to the rotational speed of the drum. Each line\nof apparatus can be readily calibrated before and after an experi-\nment by applying known weights at the transmitting end, and\nnoting the corresponding ordinates of the traces. Thereby the\nvalue of the pressure, say in kilogrammes or grammes, corre-\nsponding to 1 centimetre height of ordinate can be accurately found.\nIt will be observed that a number of absolutely synchronous\nrecords can be obtained of the jtressures at separate and different\nplaces by employing a corresponding number of elements. Thus,\nin the case of a table levitation, it would be possible to obtain\nsimultaneous records of the horizontal and vertical components\nbeneath the table, the variations in weight of the medium, and the\nquasi-rigidity of her muscles, if, as may be the case, this is\naccompanied by an alteration in bulk. Also if the operators\npermit, it might be possible to explore the periphery of the\n\u2022\u2022\npsychic cantilever \" since the small bulk of the tambour might not\ncause serious interference. As the graphs can easily be made\npermanent, and can be reproduced by photo-lithography it would\nthereby be possible to give evidence, which could not be refuted,\nthat the stated jjhenomena actually did take place.\nAnother great advantage of the apparatus is that the drum\netc., could be installed in a room adjoining the seance room\nwhere its actions could be observed in fuU white light. Turther,\nthe field of the psychic operations would not be encumbered with\nbulky apparatus, such as weighing machines and spring balances.\nI would also suggest the following simple direct reading arrange-\nment to register the actual movement of the table. Provide a\nvery light style working in a tube with a dehcate spiral spring.\nFix this to a side of the table so that it can mark on a large\n\f104; Journal of ISociety for Psychical Research. Oct., ioi9.\nsheet of smoked paper or a similar surface placed ou a vertical\nframe at the side of the table. If, as appears to be the case,\nlevitations can be obtained with but slight lateral oscillation, a\ntrace of the vertical movements woiild be given on the paper as\nthe spring would maintain a sufl&cient contact between paper and\nstyle for moderate lateral displacements.\nAt a later date, when levitation as a fact is definitely estab-\nlished, M. Amar's technique contains suggestions which might be\napplied to the investigation of the physiological condition of the\nmedium. He measures the expenditure of energy in working by\ncomparison of the consumption of oxygen and the respiratory\nquotient with those obtained when the subject is in a state of\nrest. Space does not permit of a description of the apparatus,\nbut its application should enable a definite decision to be given\nas to whether the expenditure of psychic force causes a corre-\nsponding expenditure of physiological energy. A decision whether\nnegative or positive would be of great value.\nA last suggestion, and I think an important one, is that the\npossibility of fraud (conscious or unconscious) should be eliminated\nby what I believe physiologists call \" control \" experiments. Any\ncareful reader of Dr. Crawford's book will probably come to the\nconclusion that many of the levitations, etc., could hardly have\nbeen effected by the sitters however much they tried. Thiis\nexperiments Nos. 23-5 are manifestations of a force which it\nwould seem impossible that the sitters could have exerted. Still,\nto make this quite certain, the attempt should be made to repeat\nthe experiments, with everything precisely as before, but with a\ncircle of independent, and preferably sceptical, persons equal in\nnumber and as far as possible similar in physique to the sitters,\nwithout, of course, any attempt to call in \" psychic \" assistance.\nIf, and when, the repetition of these experiments by normal means\nis found to be impossible, surely the action of extranormal forces\nis demonstrated, and we are released from those interminable\nand unsatisfactory discussions as to the bona fides of this or that\nmedium and circle. G. E. Wright.\nII.\nNomenclature.\nTo The Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014Much of the prejudice involved in the subject which the\nSociety for Psychical Research investigates is due to the fact that\n\fOct., 1919. Gorrespondence. 105\nthere is no satisfactory name for this subject. \" Spiritualism\n\"\ncarries too heavy a burden of associations ; and besides it is a\nphilosophical term with a technical meaning of its own.\n' Spiritism \" is still uglier, and with some people arouses even\nmore prejudice. We often take refuge in \" Psychic Research \"\n;\nbut this denotes the investigation, and not the subject. Cannot\nthe S.P.R. coin a neutral and respectable-sounding word for us to\nuse ? The need is really urgent.\nI notice that mental healing, or spiritual healing, attracted\nlittle attention from learned people until more scientific, or at\nleast more cumbersome names were invented. Or perhaps the\nnames followed the learned people : in any case we find now the\nmost orthodox scientists frankly immersed in psycho-therapeutics\nand psycho-analysis. Perhaps on this analogy we ought to invent\na good clumsy name for the learned, and a really nice name\n(such as you could put into a sonnet) for simple folk. \" PsycJio-\nDiaphory \" is the kind of thing the scientists would like, to describe\nthe phenomena or alleged phenomena of communication from\nanother plane of existence. A nice English name would be more\ndifficult to find ; but the S.P.R. contains many people who could\nhelp in this pretty art of word-making.\nOught we not also finally to discard the term \" Medium \" ? It\nwill never get rid of the associations of Mr. Sludge, and does great\ninjustice both to the subject with which we are concerned and\nto a respectable class of people. \" Sensitive \" is better ; but\nI think we could improve upon it, before it has come into general\nuse.\nThis is not a small matter. We hardly realise how necessary\ngood terms are, and how much harm is done by bad ones. And\nthe S.P.R. has sufficient authority and power to coin the necessary\nwords.

Oct., 1919.\nand amplify the conclusions to which his earlier researches had\nled him.\nHe finds that while his first \" cantilever \" theory of a simple\nrigid arm connecting the table to the medimn holds good for the\neasier levitations, a more complicated form of structure is used\nfor cases where heavy pressures are involved, or for such pheno-\nmena as the shifting of the medium and chair laodily along the\nfloor.\nThis is what one would expect, and all the results seem to\nhang together extraordinarily well. Especially simple and striking\nare the experiments (pp. 68-70) in which he locates the ends of\nthe \" psychic \" structures pressing against the bare floor or against\nthe legs of the medium's chair.\nPerhaps the most suggestive and intriguing point in the whole\nbook is the strong hint on p. 16 to the effect that means have\nbeen found to render the levitating structures visible to normal\neyesight. It is impossible to over-rate the importance of this\nadvance if it has actually been achieved ; if an observer can\nactually see the structures in j)Osition, there could be no further\nhesitation about accepting Dr. Crawford's results at their face\nvalue, and the progress of further research would be very greatly\naccelerated.\nScarcely less important is that part of the book which deals\nwith \" contact \" phenomena.\nIt is well known that there are many people who possess\nsufficient mediumistic ability to produce strong table movements\nof this type. In fact, the chances are probably in favour of any\nfour people being able to produce some sort of \" table turning\n\"\neffect if they try.\nDr. Crawford's experiments show that the movements obtained\nare greater than any which can arise from muscular pressure.\nThis is a fact which is not really any less remarkable than levita-\ntion without contact. The difference is only in degree and not in\nkind. It is greatly to be hoped that students of the subject will\nlose no time in repeating carefully the very simple experiments\ndescribed and thus checking Dr. Crawford's work. Experiments on\nthese lines put the chance of doing real research work on their\nown account within the reach of most who are interested in the\nsubject.\nIn this connection one very curious anomaly may be noted.\nContact phenomena, as their name implies, are essentially de-\n\fOct., 1919. Reviews. 107\npendent upon the sitters touching the table. In other words,\nphysical phenomena seem to be more easily produced with contact\nthan without it. And yet Dr. Crawford finds that if the medium's\nbare hand touches the levitated table in the course of non-contact\nphenomena the table instantly drops. In fact, that which is a\nsine qua non in the one case is fatal in the other.\nIn his last chapter Dr. Crawford describes some experiments he\nperformed with a \" direct voice \" medium. These took place in\ntotal darkness, and Dr. Crawford rightly refuses to attach any\ngreat importance to them.\nAll the same, they are well worth publishing, and, in the\nopinion of the present writer at least, distinctly increase the\ncredibility of this type of phemonenon.\nThere is, of course, one problem of supreme interest which\nstands out pre-eminent among the many connected with these\nphysical phenomena, namely, the question of the nature and\norigin of the curious substance which seems to be extruded from\nthe medium and is formed into the levitating structure, and of\nthe extraordinary apparent loss of weight by the medium which\nis associated with its production. This substance seems to be\n\" cropping up \" at various points of the field of Psychical Research.\nIt appears as almost the only reliable item in the researches of\nSchrenck-Notzing and of Madame Bisson with the medium \"Eva C.\"\nand the whole history of Psychical Research bristles with indications\nof it.\nIts existence seems incontestable, but its constitution remains\nobscure and forms the central problem for Psychical Research on\nthe physical side. Dr. Crawford's next publication which promises,\none gathers, to deal with his researches on the subject will be\neagerly awaited by all students whose interests centre round this\ntype of problem. W. W. S.\nDei Fenomeni d'Infestazione. By Ernesto Bozzako. (Luce e Ombra,\nRome.)\nIn his careful study, Dei Fenomeni cVInfestazione, Signer E.\nBozzano gives us so interesting a work on the subject in question\nthat one is almost tempted to forget that from the standpoint of\nmany investigators the veridical existence of many of the pheno-\nmena discussed is still open to doubt.\n\flOS Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., i919.\nIn a brief notice of a long work, its merits too often have to\nbe dismissed with a cursory word of appreciation, while the\nreviewer concentrates upon some criticism. It is in this spirit\nthat I am commenting upon Signer Bozzano's interesting chapter\nupon so-called \" Poltergeist \" phenomena, in which, with all due\ndeference to the relatively well authenticated examples he quotes,\nI think he proceeds to classification with rather too easy an\nassumption that the existence of the genuine Poltergeist is an\nestablished fact.\nIt is true that Signor Bozzano frankly admits the difficulties\nalmost invariably attendant upon the thorough investigation of an\nalleged Poltergeist ; but I venture to think that on page 156\nhe goes possibly too far in stating that the ^^olice authorities\nwhen called in \" scarcely ever achieve a solution of the mystery,\"\nor if he be correct in this statement, then I am inclined to\nquestion his implied deduction therefrom that a solution beyond\nthe achievement of the police must necessarily involve supernormal\nagency.\nSignor Bozzano goes on to say that where fraud is alleged,\n\" the very skilful charlatan capable of deceiving the '\nprofessionisti\ndePordine '\nis in most cases an ingenuous adolescent girl.\"\nNow I think Signor Bozzano has in this passage\u2014and con-\nsequently in his subsequent conclusions\u2014tended to overlook two\npoints :\n(1) That all police are not \"\nvery skilful.'\n(2) That '\nan ingenuous young girl,' especially at the age which\nof all others is productive of hysterical disturbances (an age\nwhich, as Signor Bozzano reminds us, so often figures in the role\nof Poltergeist medium), might, while duping a police agent, prove\nno match for a medical man well versed in the vagaries of con-\nscious or unconscious hysterical trickery.\nIn making these brief remarks I hope I shall not be misunder-\nstood, either by Signor Bozzano or by any prospective reader of\nhis valuable work. I am not suggesting that genuine Poltergeist\nl^henomena, and other alleged but infrequently investigated types\nof phenomena, do not exist, but only that further investigation\nshould precede the assumption of their existence.

The Section was formed \" to promote the\nstudy of the psychological side of medicine, especially the\nprinciples underlying different forms of treatment by suggestion\nand other psycho-therapeutic measures, dissociations of conscious-\nness, and analogous problems ; to publish original contributions\nby medical men on these subjects in special Medical Parts of\nthe Proceedings, to appear from time to time ; to consider\nthe possible bearings of these studies on Psychical Research\nproper.\"\nThe Council came to their decision on the grounds that the\npurpose for which the Medical Section had been created was\nnow being carried out by other medical and psychological\nSocieties, and they held that the objects of the Society would\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.-dec, 1919.\nbe better attained by appointing a Medical Committee to\nwatch, the work that was being done in various quarters, and\nto report on any matters which appeared of special interest in\nrelation to Psychical Research. A Committee was therefore\nappointed for this purpose, and the following Members of\nCouncil have consented to serve on it : Dr. W. M'Dougall,\nF.R.S. ; Dr. T. W. Mitchell; Dr. V. J. Woolley ; Dr.\nMaurice B. Wright.\nTHE CASE OP WILLIAM GILLAM.\n[Editorial Note.\u2014The following case is one in which a\nveridical statement was made in automatic writing, purporting\nto come from a deceased communicator, concerning a fact\nnot known at the time the script was produced either by the\nautomatist herself or by any other persons with whom she\nwas in touch. The automatist, Miss A. Childe-Pemberton,\nhas been an Associate of the S.P.R. for several years. From\nthe time when she first began to write automatically towards\nthe end of the year 1917, she frequently talked over her\nwriting with the Secretary, Miss Newton, and it was at Miss\nNewton's suggestion that she wrote the following report.\nThe purporting communicator is Miss Childe-Pemberton's\nnephew, Lieut. Edmund Childe-Pemberton, who died of wounds\nreceived in action on April 13, 1917. Since allusions are\nmade in the following report to sittings with Mrs. Leonard\nat which Lieut. Childe-Pemberton purported to communicate,\nit seems desirable to note that in the opinion of his relatives\ngood evidence of his identity was obtained at those sittings.]\nReport by Miss A. Childe-Pembertof.\nWilliam Gillam Avas Edmund Childe-Pemberton's servant.\nHe was with him at Vimy Ridge when he was wounded,\nApril 13, 1917, and went with him to the Hospital at\nBarlin, and was by his side that day till he died (April 13).\nGillam was faithfully attached to Edmund, and wrote immediate\naccounts of all that happened to Edmund's mother, t It was\nthrough him that we knew about Edmund's last hours, and\nthat his mother received his last message. Later he sent\n\fKov.-Dec, 1919. The Case of William Gillam. 113\nhome Edmund's note-book and watch and other things that\nhe had on him when he fell.\nGillam got leave in August, 1917, and came to see Edmund's\nparents at 12, Portman Street, on August 29 and 31,\nwhen he gave further details, and proofs of his faithful attach-\nment to Edmund. After he returned to the front to his\nRegiment (11th Hussars) I sent him parcels from time to\ntime. These he acknowledged promptly. I received answers\non the following dates : letter from trenches received Nov. 12,\n1917 ; field-card written Dec. 17, received Dec. 22, 1917 ; letter\nreceived Jan. 8, 1918 ;\nfield-card, dated March 3, 1918. This was\nthe last communication I received from Gillam and I did not\ncommunicate with him again myself, imtil I sent him a parcel\non April 8, 1918, which he never acknowledged (see below).\nThis parcel was not despatched until three days after the\nscript of April 5, 1918 (see below), in which it was stated\nthat a man (subsequently identified as GUlam) had lately\ndied. It will therefore be seen that at the time when this\nscript was produced I had no reason to suppose that anything\nhad happened to Gillam. Before passing on to consider the\nscripts written on and after April 5, 1918, something must\nbe said of a statement contained in earlier scripts.\nIn very early scrawls, when first I got writing from my\nnephew Edmund, some allusions were made to William GiUam.\nOn November 29, 1917, he said that William Gillam had\n\" come,\" that is, was now with him. It is my habit, when\nproducing automatic writing, to make statements or to ask\nquestions which are commented upon or answered in the\nscript. When I received a field-card from Gillam on December 22.\n1917, written on December 17, 1917, I told Edmund, when\nI was writing automatically on December 22, 1917, that he\nhad been incorrect. In reply, he wrote in the script\n:\nWe make mistakes,\u2014must be more careful to verify\u2014dent\nwant gammon you\u2014put you off writing\u2014still beUeve G. comes\nbefore long\u2014awfully sorry seemed a liar\u2014am not\u2014please dont\ndoubt it's absolutely me\n\u2014\nOn December 31, 1917, I had a sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nduring which I begged Edmund to be very careful not to\nmake mistakes as he had about Gillam, and he said (through\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Noy. -Dec,\nFeda) \" lie would make no wild predictions, but be very\ncareful.'\" He made allusions to this in the script of January 4,\n1918, saying :\n\" Must go more cautiously than I did.\" Also\nin the script of January 16, 1918, he said :\n\" A mistake to\nsuppose we are prophets & it has thrown people back in\nbelief\u2014I know I almost did you about Gillam.\" Again\nin the script of February 13, 1918, he said :\n\" When I first\ncame here I was so uplifted that I thought I was grown into\na kind of prophet, because one does sense such a lot of new\nthings.\"\nIt will be seen from the above extracts that at the end\nof November, 1917, a statement was made in the script that\nGiUam was already dead. This was afterwards admitted to\nbe an error, but it was suggested on December 22, 1917, that\nGillam would \" come before long.\" This was how matters\nstood until the subject was brought up again in April, 1918 :\nExtracts from the Script.\nApril 5, 1918.\nI have something interesting for you.

E. W. Holmes, V.C., M.M., of\nthe famous \" Indian rope-trick.\" The S.P.R. has already\nprinted two reports from witnesses who have seen this per-\nformance, but we have never obtained any photographs. We\nendeavoured therefore to get into touch with Lieut. Holmes\nv\/ith a view to examining the original negative, but in this\nwe have not so far succeeded.\nThe photograph depicts an open-air scene, a stretch of\ngrass apparently with a few trees in the background ; in the\nforeground stands the conjurer, holding in his left hand the\nlower end of the rope which appears to be about 10 ft. long.\nThe boy is balanced vertically on the upper end of the rope,\nw^hich rises straight into the air ; his arms are extended and\nhis legs are hanging down on either side of the rope. His\nwhole figure and the upper half of the rope are silhouetted\nagainst a light sky. The scene is thus described by Lieut.\nHolmes :\nOne day in May, 1917, I was standing on the veranda of my\nbungalow at Kirkee, near Poona, in the company of several\nother oflicers, when an old man and his boy came up to us over\nthe open ground, to give us his performance. He had no pole\n\fNov. -Dec, 1919. The Indian Rope-Trick. 125\n\u2014a thing which would have been impossible of concealment.\nHe began by unwinding from about his waist a long rope, which\nhe threw upwards in the air, where it remained erect. The\nboy climbed to the top, where he balanced himself, as seen in\nthe photograph, which I took at that moment. He then de-\nscended, and the conjurer, holding the pole with one hand, tapped\nit gently with the other, when it collapsed into rope-like flexibihty,\nand he coiled it round his waist, as before. I offer no explana-\ntion. I simply relate what took place before my eyes.\nIncluded in the article in the Strand Magazine is another\nstatement by a witness who saw the trick performed by a\nnative conjurer in Delhi in 1896, and again by the same man\nat Benares in 1897. His experience was similar to that of\nLieut. Holmes, but he did not take a photograph. The\nexistence of the photograph is an important point, because one\nexplanation of the performance which has been put forward is\nthat some illusion or hallucination is produced in the spectator,\nand the rope is never climbed at all. But such an explanation\nwill not hold where a camera is concerned. The account\ngiven by Lieut. Holmes suggests that possibly the efJect\nmight be produced by a very finely jointed rod made in\nthe semblance of a rope which would stiffen when thrown\nvertically into the air. To manipulate such a rod so that a\nboy could climb up it and poise himself at the top would be\na remarkable feat of juggling, but not perhaps beyond excep-\ntional skill. That the faculty exercised in the performance\nof this trick, whatever its nature may be, is as an exceptional\none is shown by the fact that the performance is so rare.\nIt is worthy of note that after the boy had descended from\nthe rope, as Lieut. Holmes tells us, the conjurer tapped it\ngently with his hand. If it was a jointed structure, the\nobject of the tapping may liave been to dislocate the joints.\nTwo reports by eye-witnesses of the Indian rope-trick have\nbeen printed in the Journal. In the earlier report, by Mr.\nS. T. Burchell (Vol. XI., p. 299), it is stated that the rope\nappeared to ascend to a height of about 15 to 20 feet.\nThe raised portion of the rope remained erect, while the other\nportion lay on the ground. . . . The boy then began to cHmb\nthe rope, hand over hand, with legs twisted round the rope in\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Kov.-Dec.1919.\nthe ordinary way of climbing. When he got to the top, the\nboy disappeared, but I could not tell the exact moment of\ndisappearance. One seemed to be gradually aware that he\nhad disappeared,' but not able to fix the exact moment of dis-\nappearance. The conjuror then commenced to harangue the\ncrowd and ask where the boy was. The boy then appeared\nin the open space, but I do not remember whether he descended\nthe rope or came from the outside of the crowd.\nThe second report (Vol. XII., p. 30), written in 1904 by\na lady whose name is withheld by request, describes the\nperformance of the trick in 1897 by a \" party of conjurers\n\"\noutside the verandah of a hotel in Bombay.\nOne of them threw a rope into the air which hitched itself\nup to apparently nothing in the sky above ; one could see the\nrope going straight up as far as one could see anything, and\nit certainly did not on being thrown up at once fall back to\nthe earth again. A small boy then swarmed up this rope, becom-\ning smaller and smaller, till he likewise vanished from sight, and\na few minutes later bits of his (apparently mangled) remains\nfell from the sky, first an arm, then a leg, and so on till all\nhis component parts had descended ; these the juggler covered\nwith a cloth, mumbled something or other, made a pass or two,\nand behold ! there was the boy smiling and whole before us,\nand the rope was jerked of! its invisible hook and rolled up,\nand the trick was done.\nThe jugglers were seated well below us on the open ground,\nwith no attempt at concealment, with nothing about them but\nthe very scant properties of an Indian conjuror (too well-known\nto require description).\nIt will be observed that of the three reports printed above,\nthe least sensational is Lieut. Holmes', which is corroborated\nby his photograph. Mr. Burchett's report agrees with Lieut.\nHolmes' save that he estimates the rope at fifteen to twenty\nfeet, whereas the photograph taken by Lieut. Holmes shows\nthat upon the occasion when he witnessed the performance the\nlength of the rope was only about ten feet, and Mr. Burchett\nspeaks of the boy as having disappeared from the top of the\nrope, whereas Lieut. Holmes tells us that he \" descended,\"\n\fNov. -Dec, 1919. Notefi on Periodical-^. 127\npresumably by means of tbe rope. Upon this point Mr.\nBuxctiett's statement falls more into line with the third report,\nmade seven years after witnessing the trick ; the boy is de-\nscribed as climbing to a great height, \" becoming smaller and\nsmaller until he likewise vanished from sight,\" and descending\nto earth apparently in pieces. This conclusion, which is one\nof the traditional features of the rope-trick, was apparently\nomitted upon the two occasions when Mr. Burchett and Lieut.\nHolmes witnessed the performance.\nA comparison of the three reports given above suggests that\nsome of the more sensational elements in the trick are to be\nexplained by means of the usual arts of the conjuror, raisiug\na certain expectation in the spectator's mind and distracting\nhis attention at the crucial moment. For what actually\noccurred on one particular occasion the photograph taken\nby Lieut. Holmes is the clearest evidence with which we have\nso far met.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nProceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research. Vol.\nXIII. August. 1919.\nThe number opens with an article by Dr. Hyslop which gives\nthe results of a questionnaire he had circulated to test the allega-\ntion that the evidential matter about his relatives which he had\nobtained in his sittings with Mrs. Piper might have been due\nto chance coincidences. The questionnaire was very full and\ndetailed, and Dr. Hyslop has no difiiculty in showing on the\nreturns that chance could not possibly have done what was\nclaimed for it. But his argument is less convincing in this\ncase than when he so ingeniously tested the value of the identifica-\ntions of ' spirit '-communicators through mediums by the close\nparallelism of the messages sent by communicators in the flesh\nwho were not allowed to give their names [cf. Proc. Pt. XLI,\nAppendix A] : for it is clear that the questionnaire embodies only\nthe '\nhits '\nin the Piper messages.\nThe second article, by Dr. W. F. Prince, is devoted to a\ncritical study of the '\nGreat Amherst Mystery.' It is shown\nconclusively that when due deduction is made for the defects\nin the quantity and quality of the evidence presented in Mr.\n\f128 Journal of Society fo)-' Psychical Research. '^oy.-Dsc,\nWalter Hubbell's book (now in its 55th thousand !) and its accounts\nare compared with the records in his original journal, the case\nconforms closely to the ordinary '\nPoltergeist ' type, with Esther\nCox as the perpetrator of the mysterious pranks. Dr. Prince,\nhowever, does not accuse her of conscious fraud, but supposes\nthat she was suffering at the time from '\ndissociated '\npersonaUty,\ndue to the shock of an unpleasant experience she had had shortly\nbefore the manifestations began. Dr. Prince's fine study practi-\ncally establishes this interpretation, but it is a pity that it is\nobscured by an unfortunate misprint on p. 118, where the vital\ndate is given as 1879, instead of 1878 (cf. p. 126).\nIn the third article Dr. Hyslop gives an account of his investi-\ngation of a real estate broker at Lynn, Mass., who frequently\nsuffered from veridical symbohc hallucinations referring to the\ncharacter and occupation of strangers who visited his office. On\nbeing scientifically tested, his success was nothing like so great\nas the newspapers reported, and Dr. Hyslop's attempt to convert\nthe apparent evidence for '\ntelepathy '\ninto proof of '\nspirit\n'\nagency by taking him to his medium Mrs. Chenoweth also did\nnot yield anything very conclusive. But the case is undoubtedly\nof value as throwing hght on the antecedents of '\nmediumship.'\nThe last article is a translation of Dr. W. Mackenzie's account\nof the '\nthinking dog,' Rolf of Mannheim, published in the Archives\nde Psychologic de la Suisse Romande, No. 52, December, 1913. This\narticle was fully reported on in the Society's Journal for June,\n1914. Now apparently, as there foreshadowed, evidence has been\ngot showing that Rolf did not understand the intelligent responses\nhe gave and that consequently the intelligence shown was not\nhis. A certain Dr. Neumann (at a time which is unfortunately\nnot stated, though it must have been before Frau Moekel died\na year or two ago) tried four types of experiment upon Rolf,\nall of which gave consistent results. (1) When Dr. Neumann\nheld the board on which the dog tapped his responses, the results\nwere wholly negative. \" No intelligence was manifested.\"\n(2) When Frau Moekel held it, but was ignorant of what the\ndog had to do, the answers were wrong. (3) When she, or\none or more of her daughters knew, the answers were right.\n(4) When experiments of the third type were repeated in the\nabsence of Frau Moekel, the dog at once failed to answer the\nquestions he had answered correctly before. Dr. Mackenzie,\n\fNov. -Dec, 1919. Notes on Periodicals. 129\nwho very candidly sent a copy of Dr. Neumann's paper to\nDr. Hyslop, is, not unnaturally, now afflicted vntk \" very dis-\ncomforting doubts about the actual genuineness of the whole lot\nof '\nresults '\nobtained with the Mannheim Dog,\" though he protests\nthat \" I have no direct evidence of any sort, about tricky com-\nmunications that might have been exchanged between the Moekel\nchildren and their (now deceased) mother, such as to vitiate\nmy own experiments.\" Still he thinks that \" Mrs. Moekel,\neven in perfect honesty, may have undergone much self-suggestion,\"\nand apparently believes that he was tricked, although he allows\nhis paper to be republished. There appears to be, moreover,\nno prospect of further investigations ; for though Rolf is still\nalive, \" he is said to be now completely negative '\nwhile Miss\nLuise Moekel, now married, has \" lost all interest about the\ndog,\" and refuses to exhibit him any further. The debacle\nseems as complete, and just, as that of the German Empire.\nAnd yet it is only fair to point out that, if we judge by the\nrecorded evidence alone, neither are all of Rolf's achievements\nexplained, nor is fraud (whether deliberate or as the amusement\nof an hysterical invalid) the only remaining explanation. Unlike\nDr. Neumann, Dr. Mackenzie did succeed (according to himself)\nin getting intelligent answers from Rolf under conditions when\nno one was in a position to prompt him, as notably in the card\nexperiments (of. pp. 243, 251-3), in which he elaborately assures\nus only Rolf could have seen the cards. Other observers in\nTierseele have made similar allegations (cf. Journal, June, 1914,\np. 256). Theoretically also both these results and Neumann's\nare compatible with some combination of the telepathic and\nMaeterlinck's cosmic reservoir' hypothesis (cf. Journal, July,\n1914, p. 272). But no doubt amid these perplexities most scientific\nmen will accept Dr. Neumann's verdict as final, though he is\napparently too cautious to allege fraud ;\nthey will jjrefer to\nbelieve that Dr. Mackenzie and the others who thought they\nhad made sure they were dealing with Rolf's unaided intelligence,\nwere careless observers and have not reported what actually\nhappened. And unfortunately such mistakes are so common\nthat no experienced psychical researcher will feel confident that\nthey are wrong. F. C. S.

The historical sketch of the beliefs in immor-\ntality in the first six chapters is very inadequate, and often\nmisleading. For instance, this is how he introduces James's\nfamous '\ntransmission '\ntheory of the relation of body and soul\nand the origin of consciousness in an ultra-physical sphere. \" It\nmeant that, even though consciousness might be a function of\nthe organism it might be transmitted to (sic) some other reahty.\n. . . . He recognized the law of transmission of motion and\nthought consciousness might conceivably be transferred in a\nsimilar way from the physical body {sic) to some other subject\n\"\n(p. 156). He goes on (p. 157) to ascribe to James an \" accep-\ntance of the materialistic view that consciousness was a function\nof the brain or organism. Hence whatever sympathy he had\nwith siirvival had to be indicated in a theory of transmission\nwhich seems to the present writer rank nonsense.\" So it does\nto the present reviewer ; but the nonsense is Dr. Hyslop's, and\nsuggests that if he ever read James's Human Lmmortality he\nhas completely forgotten it and reconstructs its argument, as\nthe German professor did his camel, out of his inner conscious-\nness. Or rather out of the word '\ntransmission,' which he has\nunhappily equipped with the wrong prepositions. For James's\n'transmission' was not a transmission \"from the physical body\nto some other subject,\" but through the body from a spiritual\nsphere, and suggested that our minds come from something\nmental that pre-exists \" {Human Immortality, p. 58). Also James\nwas careful to explain the ambiguity of '\nfunction,' and to show\nthat it might be either '\nproductive ' or '\ntransmissive,' whereas\nDr. Hyslop seems to confuse '\ntransmissive ' with '\ntransitive\n'\n(p. 137).\n\fNov. -Dec. 1919. Review.\nDr. Hyslop is on firmer ground when he discusses in the light\nof his abundant experience the modes of transmitting messages\nfrom the '\nspirit '\nworld, their interpretation and the nature of\nthe spiritual existence thus revealed. He is emphatic in declaring\nhis conviction that psychical research has accumulated evidence\nenough for him to \" treat the hypothesis of survival as scientifi-\ncally proved \"\n(p. 233) ; but his main aim appears to be to\ndiscourage the inference that therefore '\nspirit-communications\n'\ncan be trusted to reveal the nature of the after life, and insists\non the difficulties and complications of the process of communi-\ncating and the extent to which its products are coloured by the\npersonahty of the medium and hable to be vitiated by various\nsources of error. So that in the end little appears to him to\nbe estabhshed, as yet, beyond the fact of survival, and his dis-\ncussion is calculated to have a moderating influence alike on the\ncredulity of those who are ready to swallow anything that authen-\nticates itself in an abnormal manner, and on the presumption of\nthose who make bold to reject whatever does not seem to them\nconsonant with their preconceived notions of spiritual dignity\nand propriety.\nIn contending against these uncritical attitudes it is gratifying\nthat Dr. Hyslop has considerably modernized the philosophic\nconceptions employed. A '\nspirit '\nis no longer a simple (and\ntherefore indiscerptible) '\nsoul-substance '\nlurking behind the scenes\nbut a '\nstream of consciousness '\nthat contrives to exist apart\nfrom the physical body. The invocation of ideahsm removes\nthe traditional stumbhng-block which the somewhat grotesque\nimitation of this world, apparently revealed by the messages,\nwith spiritual replicas of houses, clothes, cigars, etc., used to\nconstitute ; indeed Dr. Hyslop is disposed to believe that post\nmortem existence is in \"a wholly mental world.' But he con-\ntinues to think reaHstically about the absolute reality of our\npresent world ;\nwhereas, if idealism is in order, nothing is easier\nthan the suggestion that it too is relative to a mental condition,\nand so of a like nature with the '\nspirit '-world which resembles\nit so much. In plainer language, if it is legitimate to suppose\nthat the world of the '\nspirit '\nmessages is a dream-world, and\nif physical reality may appear to be possessed by dream-worlds, it\nmay quite well be that our world is a further example of this\nand that our actual experience is of a dream - world too. We\ncan get no assurance of its absolute reality, either from science,\nwhich presupposes the data of experience in constructing its\nworld of physical reality, or from experience, which exhibits to\nus dream-worlds and transitions into and out of them. Conse-\nquently death as an experience might well seem like awakening\nfrom a dream, and whether we should bofieve ourselves to be\npassing into a more real world or lapsing deeper into nightmare,\nwould depend only on the intrinsic character and value of the\nnew existence as compared with the old. And obviously the\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.-Dkc, 1919.\ninherent difficulties of communication, would remain precisely the\nsame, whether we supposed that the denizens of a dream-world\nwere trying to impose on people so wide awake as ourselves,\nor that more enlightened '\nspirits ' were trying to arouse ms\nto higher realities : in either case they would have to be overcome\nbefore literal credence could be given to the information received.\nThey would have to be overcome to a far greater extent than\nthey have been, before the communications themselves could be\nregarded as adequate proof even of the fact of survival. Dr.\nHyslop's contrary conviction that to obtain supernormal knowledge\nof personal characteristics of the departed proves at least that\nthey still exist and are concerned in its transmission, even though\nthe bulk of the message may be grotesque or false, is surely\ntoo precarious ; for a number of alternative interpretations have\nbeen, or may be, given of the ajjparent situation. To mention\nonly one of the former, which though not very attractive or\nelevating in itself is of great antiquity and congenial with powerful\ninterests\u2014what if both the supernormal information and the\nmimicry of the departed should proceed from the craft and\nsubtlety of the devil ? It is clear that all the established\nchurches, which naturally regard '\nmediums '\nas doctors do un-\nlicensed practitioners, must incUne to this view, and notorious\nthat the Church of Rome has always officially done so ;\nmoreover,\nmetaphysical philosophers also are more likely to accef)t this\ntheory, when cornered and forced to admit that a priori reasoning\ncan determine nothing about a future life, than to take to patient\nscientific investigation of the alleged facts. ^ There is little likeli-\nhood therefore that the path of the psychical researcher will be\nmade less arduous in the future than in the past, though there\nis much to be said for Dr. Hyslop's contention (p. 329) that\n\" if our religious minds could have the courage to frankly abandon\npurely deductive methods, to make their peace with scientific\nmethod and to follow inductive methods, they would soon find\ntheir way out of the wilderness. They have everything to gain\nand nothing to lose by the appeal to facts instead of a priori de-\nfinitions and deduction from premises including more than their\nevidence supplies.

Telepathic; Impression.\nThe following report of an impression aj^parently derived from\na telepathic som:ce received at the moment of waking, has\nbeen sent to us by Mr. B. Jordan-Smith, an Associate of the\nSociety. In sending his first report of the case Mr. Jordan-\nSmith wrote as follows :\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nOrchardlea,\nGrosvenor Road,\nCaversham,\nReading.\nNovember, 27, 1919.\nThe enclosed details I think come within the category of \" Telepathy\nwithout Conscious Effort and may be of use to you for publica-\ntion in the Journal, or for the Society to keep.\nMiss B. M. Thomas is a Birmingham friend of ours and staying\nat the above address for a few days. So far I have never tried\nany telepathic experiments with the lady.\nAfter relating what she said was her dream, she modified it\nby saying that she was more or less in the stage of waking\n(half awake).\nMrs. Jordan-Smith confirms these statements as she was present\nat the time.\nB. Jordan-Smith.\nThe following statements were enclosed with this letter :\nNovember 2Gth, 1919 (written 10 a.m.)\nI.\nAt 8.30 a.m. this morning at breakfast at the above address. Miss\nEthel Thomas, a visitor, related what she said at the time was a\ndream, just on the point of waldng up, as follows :\n\" I was counting the number of men and women going on\nboard ship at Southampton, and the number was fifteen.\nI could almost tell who they were.\"\nI mentioned that I thought that this was a case of \" telepathy\nwithout conscious effort,\" and related that at 8.15 a.m. I was\n\fJanuary, 1920. Case. 139\nshaving in an adjoining room, and counting up in my mind the\nnumber of people going on board ship on Thursday, and on a\nship at Southampton, the same time. The total number was 15.\nMrs. Jordan-Smith just after I had shaved went into Miss\nThomas's room to rouse her.\nB. Jordan-Smith.\nII.\nNovember 26, 1919.\n[I was] just dreaming when Mrs. B. Jordan-Smith called me\nthis morning (or rather she came into my room and touched me\nand said :\n\" Breakfast will soon be ready, but no hurry \").\nI got up, without hurry, and came down and found Mr. and\nMrs. Jordan-Smith having breakfast. I said to Mrs. Jordan-\nSmith : \"I was dreaming about a ship when you came and woke\nme.\" Mr. Jordan-Smith then took it up :\n\" What about a ship ?\n\"\nhe asked. \"Oh,\"\" I replied, \"it was just going from Southampton,\nand I stood by counting the people going aboard.\" \" How many ?\n\"\nhe asked.\n\" Fifteen\" I replied.\nHe then told me that just before, and at the time Mrs. Jordan-\nSmith broke into my dream, he was shaving in bath-room, and\nwas thinking over a ship sailing from Southampton next day, on\nwhich he had fifteen passengers.\nEthel Marler Thomas.\n{witness) Annie Jordan-Smith.\nWe then wrote to Mr. Jordan-Smith to enquire whether he\ncould state that to the best of his belief no mention had\nbeen made in Miss Thomas's hearing of the fact that he had\na ship sailing from Southampton on the following Thursday,\nand we also enquired whether Miss Thomas would have any\ngeneral reason for associating with him a ship sailing from\nSouthampton rather than another port. In reply we received\nthe following answer from Mr. Jordan-Smith :\nIn reply to yours of the 2nd inst., re my experiences with\nMiss E. M. Thomas, \" Telepathy without Conscious Effort.\"\nThe evening previous to this experience, I in no way mentioned\nabout Passengers, Shipping or Southampton to Miss Thomas or\nany one at Orchardlea.\nI passed your letter without comment this morning (December\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. Januaey, 1920.\n3rd, 1919) to Mrs. Jordan Smith and on reading the same, she\ncommented to me :\n\" You never mentioned anything about\nShipping then, and generally you never talk about your business.\"\nI have no objection to my full name and address being used\nin connection with this.\nI sent your letter on to Miss Thomas without comment, and\nherewith enclose her reply.\nB. Jordan Smith.\nThe letter from Miss Thomas to which Mr. Jordan-Smith\nrefers, was as follows : >\n127 Barclay Road,\nBearwood, Birmingham.\nDecember ith, 1919.\nI have read the letter from the Editor of the S.P.R. and will\nnow answer his questions, which I think he has every right to\nask, as jsersonally I consider these instances no good at all as\nevidence, unless they are questioned and looked into from every\npoint of view.\nAs far as I can remember during my thirteen days visit to\nyour house, only one ship was mentioned and that was when\nyou remarked you might have to go to London, for the day to\nsee some people off from some docks there, and I said, \" Oh,\nif you go on a Friday be sure and visit the Caledonian Market,\"\nknowing your interest in antiques. I was not at all interested\nin the ship itself and can't even remember where it was going to.\nThat was in the early part of my visit and the dream occurred\non the last morning of my visit, the only morning in fact that\nI had breakfast with you ;\nhaving got ujj early to go into town\nwith Mrs. Jordan-Smith.\nRe the day before (Tuesday [November 25, 1919]) I saw you at\nlunch-time, but you didn't come up to tea, and 1 decided not to\ngo to the dancing-class with Mrs. Jordan-Smith, my foot being\npainful. I therefore spent the evening alone finishing a novel,\nand also looked at one or two humorous journals, with a view\nto getting ideas for my own art and work.\nYou and Mrs. Jordan-Smith returned about 10.35 and we had\nsupper, talked about dancing and went to bed, my mind being\nset very strongly all the time upon my art work and getting ideas\nfor same (I never draw ships or anything to do with ships, or\nthe sea, as you know).\n\fJanuary, 1920. Correspondence. 141\nIt was in fact only by the merest chance that I mentioned\nmy dream to you at all, not being at all superstitious about\ndreams myself, or taking any notice of them.\nI also think that names and addresses should be mentioned\nand he is quite at liberty to use mine.\nEthel M. Thomas.\nIt appears from the above statements that Miss Thomas\nhad no special reason on the morning of Wednesday, November\n26th, 1919, for thinking of a ship sailing from Southampton,\nand the fui-ther close coincidence between her waking impression\nand Mr. Jordan-Smith's thoughts, both in time and in contents,\nmakes it difficult to ascribe the incident to chance.\nWe are indebted to Mr. and Mrs. Jordan-Smith and Miss\nThomas for the trouble they have taken in this matter and\nfor permission to print their names and addresses.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nNOMENCLATURE.\n1.\nMadam,\u2014As suggested by the Rev. Percy Dearmer in his letter\nof Aug. 25th, there seems to be room for improvement in some\nof the terms more or less commonly used in connection with\npsychical research and it would no doubt be beneficial if a standard\nnomenclature could be agreed upon and authoritatively adopted\nbefore such terms become stereotyped in current hterature. This\nis . a matter which I think should be dealt with jointly by the\nCouncils of the English and American Societies for Psychical\nResearch.\nWith reference to a general name to cover the whole field of\ninvestigation, the terms \" Spirituahsm \" and \" Spiritism,\" as\npointed out by Mr. Dearmer, are both undesirable, and moreover,\nas commonly used, they refer only to one branch of the subject.\nA further objection, to my mind, lies in their tendency to obscure\nthe difference between soul (psyche) and spirit (pneuma) in the\nhuman trinity of body, soul and spirit. The two words are often\nemployed so indiscriminately, that soul and spirit come to be\nregarded as identical. Regarding the investigations of the S.P.R.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Januaht, 1920.\nas being relative to the soul, I think that for a general name for\nthe whole subject, \" Psychics \" would best meet the case, as\nbeing the simplest and analogous to physics, mathematics, etc.\nFollowing this analogy, the corresponding adjective \" psychical\n\"\nshould be adopted and the abbreviated form \" psychic \" should\nbe dropped.\nI am not quite sure whether the term \" psycho-diaphory,\"\nfor the phenomena or alleged phenomena of communication with\nanother world, is put forward by Mr. Dearmer as a definite\nproposal, but if so, I think he must have overlooked the medical\nterm \" diaphoresis,\" used to signify sweating. This will probably\nbe a fatal objection to the suggestion.\n\" Medium \" ought certainly to be discarded entirely. In the\nGlossary at the commencement of Human Personality, Myers stated\nhis preference for \" automatist \" or \" sensitive,\" and of the two,\nthe former seems the better, being free from implication as to\nthe origin of the phenomena.\nJ. T. COOTE.\nTo the Editor of the Journal op the S.P.R.\nII.\nMadam,- Dr. Dearmer's letter in the October issue of the Journal\nraises a point of real importance.\nAs we are the Society for Psychical Research the subject which\nwe investigate must obviously have a \" \" in it.\nThe \" ology \" which properly belongs to use has been appropriated\nby others. I think, however, that \" psychics \" is still to let.\nThis term seems logically correct. As an analogy we have the\nphysical society dealing with physics.\nThe objection is that the term \" jisychic \" has been somewhat\nwidely used to describe a sensitive or automatist. This use\nhowever is not very widely spread and can probably be sup-\npressed in due course.\nWe can frame several nice long words on ^y^V'^hics, e.g. the\nstudy of \" physical \" phenomena becomes psycho-dynamics, a\nsensitive is dia-psychic, ordinary people are adia-psychic.\nUndoubtedly the term medium, should be eliminated but we\nare hardly likely to get any better substitutes than sensitive\nand Automatist. \u2022\nThe \" really nice names for simple folk \" are impossible of\n\\\n\fJanuary, 1920. Revieio. 143\nattainment. All the simple nice names, and nasty ones too, have,\nlike the simple houses, been taken long ago.\nAnd why do we want names to put into a sonnet \" ? Does\nthe Reverend Doctor wish to see the terse prose of the S.P.R.\nproceedings give place to lyrics ? If so, our poetical sub-Uminals\nwill have to write the papers as well as supply material for them.\nG. E. Wright.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nIII.\nMadam,\u2014Mr. Percy Dearmer's letter of August 25, is very much\nto the point. Many people who are interested in Psychical\nResearch do not call themselves spirituahsts but would have\nno objection to be called Psychists (Greek, Psuche, the soul,\nistes, one who is skilled or has studied). Again, instead of talking\nof Spiritualism let us talk of Psychics (Greek, Psuche, the Soul,\nika, things relating to), just as we do of Optics, things relating\nto the science of magnitudes.\nThere is much more in a name than many realise, and a\ngeneral adoption of the above would raise the whole subject\nin the opinion of the public to a scientific plane.\nJ.

Mr. Hackett was an\nintimate friend, from his youth upwards, of Dr. Richard Hodgson,\nto whose enthusiastic work the Society owed much in its earlier\ndays, and, as he tells us in his Preface,\nabout one-third of the main quotations , . . came direct from Hodgson.\nHe left Australia in 1877, but we maintained a voluminous corre-\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Thus directly and indirectly Hodgson has\nmuch to do with the book, and, if it had been practicable, I would\nliave placed his name on the title-page,\nThis circumstance will give the book a special interest to members\nof the Society, who will find much in it to attract them on other\ngrounds. It contains a wide and varied selection from authors of\ndifferent periods, but especially from authors writing in \" the seventies\nand eighties \" of the last century, concerning many of whom, since\nthey have fallen out of sight in recent years, the reader will be glad\nto have his memory refreshed.\nBesides the quotations, Mr. Hackett has introduced many notes\nand comments of his own.

Whately Smith, Lady Troubridge, Miss Upton,\nLieut.-Colonel L. P. Winby, and Dr. V. J. WooUey.\nThe Report of the Council for 1919, printed below, was read.\nThe audited account of income and expenditure for the year\n1919, also printed below, was presented and taken as read.\nMrs. Leila Boustead, who had given notice of her intention\nto speak, rose and spoke as follows :\nMrs. Boustead said she was present on behalf of a large\nnumber of Members and Associates who felt convinced, as\nshe long had, that dissatisfaction exists with regard to the\nmethods of the Society. She had invited correspondence on\nthe question and had received a great number of letters, all\npractically without exception endorsing her views of the dis-\ncontent at the lethargic state of the Society. That morning\nshe had received a letter from an important Member, Sir\ni\\xthur Conan Doyle, stating that he would support the\nresolution.\nThe Society's sound and critical methods were well-known\n;\nit was called a Society for Research, but she submitted that\ntoo little research work was done. The Journal was often full\nof matter that was valueless and uninteresting.\nAnother subject upon which reform w^as desired was the\npapers read to the Society. She put in a plea for simpler\npapers. Those by leading lights in psychical research, men\nwhose names did not require to be mentioned, had always\nbeen interesting and to the point. But they had heard some\npapers which were not. One, of a medical nature on the\nconscious and unconscious complexes, was most technical and\ncould be followed only by the deepest scientists.\nThe S.P.R. had fallen into a rut of lethargy and had adopted\na non-progressive policy. The whole subject of psychical\n\fFebruaet, 1920. Anmud General Meeting. 147\nresearch had become one of the burning questions of the day\nand people would no longer be content with such slow\nmethods.\nMrs. Boustead suggested that new members should be elected\non to the Council and should be people who had leisure to\ngive time to the work, which many of those now on the\nCouncil had not. For this reason she suggested that half the\nnew members should be women.\nShe also suggested that more research officers should be\nappointed, not necessarily paid ; such officers to be elected\nfrom the Members and Associates according to their abihty.\nShe asked why the experiments of Dr. Crawford at Belfast\nhad not been taken up. These well-attested physical pheno-\nmena should long since have engaged the attention of the\nSociety, and she would ask why such things were neglected.\nShe suggested that several well-known mediums should be\ninvestigated and reports published. She knew that for this\npurpose money was necessary, but if the Society was not a\nwealthy one that was its own fault. If things were on a more\nprogressive footing, a large membership would come in. As\nit was, members resigned. She was sure many people would\ncome forward with funds if the work were more active.\nMrs. Boustead then proposed to submit a Resolution to\nthe meeting. The Chairman (Mr. G. W. Balfour) pointed out\nthat no notice of the Resolution had been given and no copy of\nit sent to the Secretary, although it appeared to be more or\nless in the nature of a vote of censure on the Council. It\nwas doubtful whether such a Resolution would be in order, at\nall events at this stage of the proceedings. He thought how-\never that Mrs. Boustead might be allowed to put it before\nthe meeting as an amendment to the Report.\nIt was then proposed by Mrs. Boustead and seconded by\nColonel Baddeley that the following Resolution should be\npassed as an amendment to the Report :\n\" Whilst fully recognising the importance of critical and\ncautious investigation into psychical research, and^ the perman-\nent value of the work done already by the S.P.R., we think\nthe time has come for a more active and progressive poUcy.\nThe impression widely exists that the official attitude of the\nS.P.R. (negative rather than positive) is more that of a detec-\nA 2\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. February, 1920.\ntive, anxious to expose fraud, than that of an open-minded\ninvestigator.\nAccordingly we desire the addition of new members on to\nthe Council, who will inspire a more active spirit into the\nSociety ; also the appointment of at least one additional\nResearch Officer, with or without remuneration, who will give\na patient and sympathetic enquiry into all evidence submitted\nby members and others.\"\nColonel Baddeley said that he had talked the matter over\nwith members of the Society and they gave it as their opinion\nthat there was not a close enough connexion in the Society\nbetween the various members scattered about the country\n;\nit was thought that if there were a closer connexion many\nwould be willing to do work and more research would be\ndone.\nThe Society inevitably had split up into certain groups of\nthought and it was desirable that work .should be carried out\nin all these groups. One group included those whose evidence\ntended towards the spiritualistic hypothesis. A second group\nthought that most of the phenomena could be explained by ab-\nnormal psychological processes, but agreed there was a large\nsupernormal residue. A third group had not found evidence\nfor any extraneous phenomena whatever. It was a pity that\nthe Society should carry out its research along only one of\nthese lines ; it should be carried out along each.\nMr. Everard Feilding asked along which line it ivas carried\nout, but Colonel Baddeley said that this was rather an invidious\nquestion.\n(Una) Lady Troubridge said that, in reply to Mrs. Boustead,\nshe and Miss Radclyffe-Hall had only been members of the\nSociety a short time when they came to the Secretary with\nsome reports ;\nthey received every encouragement and assist-\nance and were very shortly asked to read the paper which\nhad recently been published.\nSir William F. Barrett said he had had many letters\nfrom Members and Associates urging a more active policy, but\nhe wanted emphatically to say to those who might be dis-\nsatisfied with the somewhat slow and cautious methods of\nthe Society that any attempt to depart in the slightest way\nfrom the strictly scientific j^roceedings of the Society, or from\n\fFebruakt, 1920. Anmtal General Meeting. 149\nthe fundamental basis upon which the Society was founded\nwould meet with the most strenuous opposition on his part\nand on the part of many others.\nColonel Baddeley interposed to say that he was not\ncomplaining of the critical and sound basis upon which the\nSociety worked. The work of the Society was excellent, so\nfar as it went, but it did not go far enough.\nSir William Barrett (resuming) said that a crisis had\narisen in the history of the Society in its very early years.\nCertain influential members were anxious that the Society\nshould proceed more rapidly and approach more nearly to\nwhat they regarded as the spiritualistic standpoint. Their\nviews did not meet with the approval of the Council at the\ntime and several of them resigned. But to the views they\nadvocated the Society had steadily approached. You could\nnot hurry psychical research and you must not expect rapid\nprogress.\nCaptain Bennett said that, with regard to the investiga-\ntion of sporadic hauntings, the failure to investigate was\noften due to the fact that the number of people able and\nwilling to undertake these researches was limited. If those\nmembers who would give a general undertaking to do this\nwork, if possible, would send in their names to the Secretary,\ninterest in the Society would be spread over a larger area\nand good work would be done.\nMr. Baggally said he could speak from many years'\nexperience of investigating haunted houses, etc. It was neces-\nsary to have experienced investigators.\nMr. Bayfield said that the Resolution contained extra-\nordinary demands and he did not see how any Society could\nvote on all this at once.\nAs to the cry of discouragement by the officers of the\nSociety he beUeved it was to be found in the prospectus\nof rules that they earnestly asked all members to do all they\ncould for the Society. The complaint, he thought, was that\nmembers would not do enough. The Society had welcomed all\nthat its members would do.\nSecondly, as Mr. Baggally had stated, very few people were\ncapable of carrying on well a diflicult investigation. The\nSociety would find itself in an extremely false position if it\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. February, 1920.\nappointed a member who was unqualified and unsuitable for\nofficial research. An incapable investigator would damage\nthe prestige of the Society. Its position in the eyes of the\npublic depended very largely on the fact that it was careful,\nsober and deliberate.\nMr. Whately Smith said he would like to answer one\nspecific point which Mrs. Boustead had made. With regard\nto Dr. Crawford's experiments, the Society, he believed, had\ngot into touch with Dr. Crawford three years ago and had\ntried to enquire into the phenomena. Two years ago there\nhad been a suggestion that he himself and two members of\nthe Council should go over to Belfast to have sittings. But\nDr. Crawford had not agreed to this and up to the present\nwas not willing that any other investigators should take part\nin the case.\nMr. Feilding endorsed what Mr. Whately Smith had\nsaid about the attitude of Dr. Crawford. His reason for\nrefusing an investigation was that he was engaged on a series\nof experiments on one or two points, upon which he was\nanxious to satisfy himself before admitting the public in any\nway.\nMr. Feilding also drew attention to the great amount of\nwork that was done without there being anything to show for\nit. He said that having been Honorary Secretary for a number\nof years he had seen that a great many cases could never be\nbrought to the point at which any report upon them was\npossible ; he himself had been recently investigating a case of\nthat sort. He doubted whether, even if Mrs. Boustead's\nsuggestion of appointing another research officer were carried\nout, it would make much difference in the work of the Society.\nAfter some remarks by the Chairman on the importance of\nmaintaining the high scientific standard of the Society, the\nResolution was put to the Meeting as an amendment to the\nReport and was defeated by a large majority, only five persons\nvoting for it : the Report was then adopted.\nThe Chairman announced that the five retiring Members of\nthe Council offered themselves for re-election, and that to\nfill a further vacancy, caused by the previous retirement of\nDr. Milne Bramwell, Dr. L. P. Jacks, late President of the\nSociety and at present a co-opted member of Council, was\n\fFebrcaey, 1920. Meetings of the Council. 151\nproposed by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick and seconded by Mr. J.

Mitchell, hitherto a co-opted member.\nAs a result of the increase in the cost of the production\nof the Proceedings and Journal and in other expenses of the\nSociety, the Council decided, on the Hon. Treasurer's j)roposal,\nto suspend the election of new Associates.\nThe Report of the Council was considered, and approved as\namended, for the year 1919.\nThe 169th Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover\nSquare, London, W., on Wednesday, January 28th, 1920,\nimmediately after the Annual General Meeting ; The Rt.

Their names and\naddresses are given above.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nThe 61st Private Meeting of the Society for Members and\nAssociates only was held in the Council Chamber, at 20 Han-\nover Square, London, W., on Wednesday, January 28th, 1920,\nat 5 p.m. ; The Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour in the\nchair.\nMrs. W. H. Salter read selections from a paper by Mrs.\nHenry Sidgwick on \" A Report on Some Book Tests obtained\nthrough Mrs. Leonard.\" It is hoped that the full paper will\nbe published later in the Proceedings.\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1919.\nIn our Report for 1918 we drew attention to the fact that\nthe total membership of the Society which, as a result of\n\fFebruary, 1920. Report of the Council for the Year. 153\nthe war, showed a marked decrease during the years 1914,\n1915, and 1916, had since then been increasing. It is satis-\nfactory to be able to report a further substantial increase\nof 99 during the past year. Seventy-three new Members have\nheen elected, the average annual number elected during the\nprevious nine years being 27, and 17 Associates have become\nMembers, of whom a considerable proportion have taken this\nstep as a result of the aj)peal for donations towards the\ncost of printing ; 116 new Associates have been elected and\n8 Members have become Associates. The unusually large num-\nber of Members elected in proportion to Associates is a point\nof some interest in view of the financial position discussed\nbelow. The losses from death during the past year, 8 Mem-\nbers and 20 Associates, have been exceptionally large ; the\nlosses from resignations and failure to renew subscriptions\namount to 19 Members and 43 Associates.\nThe total membership of the Society now stands at 1305,\nof whom 403 are Members and 902 Associates, as compared\nwith 290 Members and 953 Associates at the end of 1913,\nthe last year before the war.\nEvidence of the increased interest taken in the Society's work\n<3an also be derived from the more frequent use made of the\nLibrary, and from the sale of publications. As regards the\nLibrary, the total number of books borrowed during the last\ntwo years exceeds the total number borrowed during the preceding\nfour. The total amount realised during the past year by\nthe sale of publications in this country is \u00a349 16s. Od. by\nsales to the general public, \u00a3111 Os. lOd. by sales at half-price\nto Members and Associates. Thus the unusually large sum\nof \u00a3104 15s. 9d. obtained bv sales to Members and Associates\nin 1918, has been exceeded. More significance attaches to\nthese figures when we remember that they are not affected\nby the recent increase in the price of publications and that\nthe output of the Society has again been small. The sum of\n\u00a38 13s. Od. has been realised by sales in America.\nLord Rayleigh was elected President of the Society last\nJanuary and gave his Presidential Address in April. His\nlamented death in June has left us for some months without\na President, as it seemed better not to fill the vacancy till\nthe usual time. The Society is to be congratulated that their\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJi. February, 1920.\npresidential chair was filled by so eminent a man of science,\neven for a short time, and it will be a lasting honour to us to\nhave his name on the roll of ex-Presidents.\nThe Society has suffered another loss of a much valued\nmember in the death of Sir William Crookes, a former President\nand Vice-President.\nThe Society will regret the retirement of the Hon. Everard\nfeilding from the post of Honorary Secretary which he has\nheld since 1903. Mr. Feilding has been abroad for the greater\npart of the last five years, and is rather frequently called\nabroad by business, and he thinks he can serve the Society\nas an ordinary member of the Council as well as he could\nin the capacity of Honorary Secretary. For the moment the\nCouncil have not filled his place.\nThe retirement from the Council of Dr. Milne Bramwell,\nafter giving us for many years the benefit of his support,\nleaves a vacancy on that body. Dr. Bramwell would have\nretired in rotation after this Meeting, which has the duty\nof filling his place and that of the five other members of\nthe Council who retire in rotation.\nThe casual vacancy on the Council caused by the death\nof Lord Rayleigh has been filled by the Council itself, under\nArticle 33, by the election of Dr. T. W. Mitchell, previously\na co-opted member. Dr. Mitchell's services to the Society are\nwell known.\nThe expense of printing has continued to be a subject of\nanxiety to the Council. The generous help they have re-\nceived from Members and Associates in donations (\u00a391 9s. Od.\nduring 1919, including \u00a350 from Mrs. Salter, and taking 1918\nand 1919 together about \u00a3206) and the additional subscriptions\nreceived from those Associates who have become Members,\nprevent immediate financial difficulty. But it now appears\nprobable that the larger part of the expenses of j^ri^ting,\nthat depending on labour, is likely to remain at its present\nhigh level. Other expenses, such as salaries, are rising, and\npresently rent will also rise. It would be impossible to go\non indefinitely appealing for donations, and the Council feel\nthat some way of permanently increasing the available income\nmust if possible be found. If we divide expenses by the\nnumber of Members and Associates of the Society, we find\n\fFebruary, 1920. Rejyort of the Council for the Year. 155\nthat the share per head is considerably over the guinea paid\nby Associates, and the Council have decided that for the\npresent at least, it will be best to try the experiment of\nelecting no new Associates, hoping that most of those who\nwould have joined as Associates will be willing to join as\nMembers. The elasticity secured by the changes lately made\nby the Society in its Articles of Association renders this\narrangement possible. Existing Associates will continue as\nbefore. It is also proposed to raise the price of both current\nand past Parts of Proceedings to outsiders. The half-price paid\nby Members for extra copies or back Parts will of course\ngo up automatically at the same time.\nThe Council hope that these arrangements may secure the\nnecessary increase of revenue. If they do not, other steps\nwill have to be taken to enable the Society to carry on its\nwork ; but the Council are reluctant either to raise the fees\npaid by existing Members and Associates or to reduce the\noutput of work or pubhcations, if it can be avoided.\nThe accounts for 1919, like those for 1918, look more\nfavourable than they should because the amount of matter\npublished during both years has been small. Only one Part\nof Proceedings was actually issued in 1919. This has been\npartly due to printer's delays and partly to other difficulties.\nThe result is a considerable accmnulation of matter for publi-\ncation, the first instalmcDt of which is Part 78, completing\nwhen the Index is ready Vol. XXX., which has been circulated\nthis month. Two further Parts should appear shortly, for\nwe have waiting for publication Dr. Mitchell's paper on the\nDoris Fischer Case, read in 1918 ; the Report on the Sittings\nwith Mrs. Leonard arranged by the Society which was read\nin part in January 1919 ; Dr. Jung's paper read in July\n1919 ; and Mr. Hubert Wales\" paper read in part in October\n1919 ; besides other matter.\nThe return of peace has, as we hoped, led to marked\nsigns of increasing activity in Psychical Research, and the\nadvent of a greater number of competent workers into the\nfield is likely to increase the amount of work done. Not\nthat we can reasonably expect much more rajjid progress\nin systematizing the knowledge acquired. That this should\nbe done is of course of the utmost importance, but progress\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Februaey, 1920.\nin it must almost necessarily be slow if it is to be good,\nand in order to secure a sound basis for interpretation further\naccumulation of empirical knowledge both by experiment and\nobservation is greatly needed. It is in the accumulation of\nthis that more workers are especially needed. As members\nof the Society well know, however, mere goodwill in an\ninvestigator is not enough. Neither spontaneous cases, nor\nexperiments, are of much use unless carefully observed and\nrecorded, and to do this well some experience is usually\nneeded, as, without it, points which it is important to look\nout for and record are not always realised. Some good work may\nlose its value in this way. But it is also to be observed that\nwork well done may sometimes have to remain in the archives\nof the Society unpublished and unprinted. This may easily\nhappen in negative cases, for if investigation leads to the\nconclusion that there has probably been trickery or self-\ndeception it is often impossible to say so publicly without\ngiving pain or annoyance to people who have perhaps taken\nspecial pains to give facilities for investigation. This kind\nof disappointment is not perhaps very important, because\nthough the particulars of such a case may be helpful in\nother investigations, it is of course positive evidence that\nwe are in search of. Another and more regrettable disappoint-\nment occurs when an investigator is unable to look into a\ncase with sufficient thoroughness to make his researches of\nuse ; or when having obtained all the available evidence he\nis unable to make up his own mind on the conclusion to\nbe drawn.\nAll this is perhaps something of a digression from a report\non the work of the year, but the Council is anxious it should\nbe fully understood that not all the investigations conducted\ncan be included in the publications of the Society.\nThe widespread interest taken recently in psychical research\nand in \" spiritualism \" has resulted in an increased number\nof interviews with peojDle visiting the Society's rooms in\nsearch of information and advice, which has been freely given.\nThis is a kind of work which has httle immediate result,\nbut from which both the public and the Society are likely\nin the long run to benefit.\nAll spontaneous cases or experiments that are sent to us\n\fFebruary, 1920. Report of the Council for the Year. 157\nwith permission to print, if they seem to come up to the\nevidential standard required, are printed in the Journal or\nfind their way into papers in the Proceedings.\nIt is perhaps a symptom of increasing help received by\nthe Council from members of the Society, and an earnest\nof still more in the future, that we have during 1919 had\nnine good spontaneous cases to print in the Journal as against\nsix in 1918 and seven in 1917. These nine, except a premonitory\ncase, are all recent, and have been recorded at intervals of a\nfortnight to ten months of their occurrence, and\u2014what is inter-\nesting\u2014four of them were apparitions at the time of death,\na kind of case important in itself and valuable because of\nthe definiteness of the coincidence. The Council also attach\ngreat importance to the piece of research carried out by Mr.\nHubert Wales independently and on his own initiative. If\nmore members could find opportunity for equally valuable\nwork the Society would greatly benefit.\nThe Society was glad to have the opportunity last summer\nof hearing a paper from Dr. C. G. Jung, which, it is hoped,\nwill shortly be published in Proceedings. Much of the work\nwhich is being done now in other branches of psychology\nhas an obvious bearing upon psychical research and anything\nwhich conduces to a rapprochement between workers outside\nour immediate circle is all the more desirable now that our\nown Medical Section has been suspended, as explained in\nthe Journal for November-December.\nThe Society's American Agents, the W. B. Clarke Co., having\nretired from business, the F. W. Faxon Co. have now been\nappointed in their place and are conducting the business\nactively and efficiently.\nThe Council have made arrangement for an investigation\nof the medium known as \" Eva C,\" of whose phenomena so\nmuch has been written by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing and by\nMadame Bisson, the lady with whom Eva C. lives. The\npubhshed reports, including Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's book,\nwere reviewed by Mrs. Salter in Proceedings, Vol. XXVII.,\np. 333, in 1914. The phenomena are curious and puzzKng and\nso far, as we think must be admitted, somewhat inconclusive.\nBut there are indications of some unexplained physiological\nor psychical phenomena, which need further elucidation.

Premonitory Dream.\nThe following case of an apparently prophetic dream was\nfirst reported in Light, September 13, 1919 : the names and\naddresses of those concerned are known to us, but by request\npseudonyms are used here.\nIt appeared from the statement in Light that Miss Jameson\n(pseudonym) dreamt of her fiance's death a few days before\nit occurred, when he was in apparently good health. In\nreply to a letter from the Secretary asking for further details\nand corroborative evidence, Miss Jameson wrote as follows :\n[Received September 15, 1919.]\nIn answer to your letter of the 12th, I had the dream which\nI wrote about on the 2nd [of August, 1919J, and told my mother\nabout it on the 4th, as I had thought it unlucky and did not\nlike to mention it before. My fiance and I spent the day\ntogether on the 5th, and he was perfectly well seemingly\u2014which\nwill prove to you that he appeared in perfect health\u2014and on\nthe following day\u2014the 6th, he died.\nIf there are any more details you would hke to know, I will\ngive them, but I would prefer, for private reasons, that my full\nname should not appear in anything public. G. B. [.JamesonI.\nTo this letter Mrs. Jameson's signature was appended thus :\nCertified correct. [Gwendoline B. Jameson.]\nIn reply to a further enquiry Miss Jameson wrote again\nthus :\n[Postmark, Seftemher 18, 1919.]\nIn answer to your letter of the 16th, I am afraid there is\nlittle I can add about that dream. I have already mentioned\nthat I went to bed as usual on the 2nd [of August, 1919] (not\nhaving eaten anything or thought of anything hkely to cause\na nightmare) and dreamt that I was beside a grave and some-\nthing said in my head, \" It is [Leonard].\"\" As the funeral party\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February, 1920.\nadvanced I noticed Mr. V. and Mr. L. (two of his greatest friends)\namong the followers ; when the burial was over and as they\nall moved away, I stumbled away from the grave and someone\ntook my arm. On turning round I found it was Mr. L. This\nwas my dream and it came true in every detail on the day\nthat [Leonard] was buried. I enclose my mother's account of\nit. You ask if I have ever before had any psychic exj^erience,\nI have had a few minor ones, but none which could be con-\nsidered evidential. G. B. [Jameson].\nWith this letter was enclosed the following corroborative\nstatement from Mrs. Jameson :\nMy daughter told of her dream on the Monday [August 4,\n1919], adding that she had felt first of all disinclined to, as\nit seemed a very unlucky dream. She was rather nervous about\nit, and told it to me in detail as in the account in Light. She\noften dreams vividly, and I remember that some have come\ntrue before, though I cannot recall exactly what they were.\n[Gwendoline B. Jameson].\nWe then wrote to Miss Jameson to ask for a statement\nconcerning the cause of her fiance's death in order to establish\nthe point that there had been no reason to anticipate it.\nWe also asked for some press notice giving the date of the\ndeath. In reply Miss Jameson wrote thus :\n[Received September 25, 1919.]\nI thank you for your letter of the 22nd. The first thing\nnecessary to complete the case I can tell you now. The verdict\nof the cause of my fiance's death was \" Angina Pectoris and\nheart in a state of Fatty Degeneration.\" None of his friends,\nnor myself, nor even [Leonard] himself had the slightest idea\nthat he had any disease of the heart, as, having always seemed\nnormal, he was not medically attended at any time. As for\nthe notice of his death, I am trying to obtain one through the\nPress Cutting Association and will send it as soon as it arrives.\nG. B. [Jameson.]\nA report of Mr. T 's death appeared in one ol the daily\npapers of August 8, 1919. We print the report below with a\nfew alterations to conceal the identity of Mr. T .\nAfternoon visitors to the on Wednesday [August 6, 1919]\nwere shocked by the sudden death of [Mr. T .] [A certain\n\fPebbuary, 1920. Correspondence. 163\npart of the entertainment] had just been completed, when [Mr.\nT ]\ncollapsed in his chair and died of heart failure.\nIt will be seen from the above report of the case that at\nthe time of Miss Jameson's dream neither she nor any one\n\u00ablse had any conscious knowledge that Mr. T 's death\nwas likely to occur soon. At the same time the physical\nconditions which caused his death were actually in existence\nat the time of the dream, and therefore we cannot exclude\nthe possibility that some knowledge of them might have been\nderived either by unconscious observation, or telepathically\nfrom Mr. T himself, who may have had some subcon-\nscious knowledge of his physical state.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nA SUGGESTED NEW TEST FOR EVIDENCE OF SURVIVAL.\nMadam,\u2014It has occurred to me that experiments on the lines\nindicated below might provide evidence of survival of a type some-\nwhat different from those with which we are familiar.\nThe evidence hitherto studied by the Society has depended on\nthe display by the ostensible communicator of knowledge, ability\nor initiative beyond the powers of the automatists concerned,\nbut characteristic of the communicator as known in life. The\nobstacle in the way of accepting such evidence as conclusive lies\nin the impossibility of assigning precise superior limits to the\nscope of telepathy and subliminal mental activity, and some test is\n\u2022clearly needed which shall be as uniquely characteristic of the com-\nmunicator's mind as a thumb-print, or a set of anthropometrical\nmeasurements, would be of his body.\nI suggest that a close approximation to this might be obtained\nby an adaptation of the \" word-association \" test sometimes used\nby psychoanalysts to discover the suppressed cause of nervous\ndisorders. In this method a list of, say, one hundred words is\nTead out and the patient is asked to reply to each with whatever\nword or idea first comes into his mind. These reactions are stated\nto be characteristic of the patient, and, in the light of psycho-\nanalytic experience, they frequently afford a clue to the cause of\nthe trouble.\nFor our purposes the procedure would be somewhat as follows :\n\u2014\nA list of standard words would be prepared and persons willing\nto participate in the test would be asked to \" react \" to them\nin the manner described above. The reactions would be recorded\nand preserved, but should be known only to the person tested.\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. February, 1920.\nThe same test would be applied to the automatists who work\nunder the supervision of the Society.\nIf, after death, one of the tested persons purported to com-\nmunicate, he would be asked to react afresh to the same list of\nwords and these new reactions would be compared with those\ngiven by him before his death.\nIf the two sets of reactions were found to be (o) identical or\nunmistakably similar, and (6) different from those of the automa-\ntist, the evidence of identity would, I think, be very strong.\nThe argument would be as follows :\n\" The way in which ideas are associated together in a person's\nmind is a function of that person's individual experience.\nBut the experience of every individual is unique.\nTherefore the association of ideas in every mind is unique and\nthus characteristic of that mind.\"\nThere are, of course, certain complications which are obviously\nlikely to arise.\nIt would be necessary to ascertain, for example, by means of\nseparate experiments, to what extent reactions vary from time to\ntime, and it might prove desirable to obtain a new set of reactions\nfor every person concerned at fairly frequent intervals.\nIt might also happen that the automatist would not record the\nactual reaction of the communicator to the test word, but that of\nhis or her own subliminal mind to that actual reaction-word as\nstimulus. But even so an exhaustive study of the automatists'\nassociations might enable us to trace the connection.\nMrs. Salter has suggested to me that it would be interesting\nto apply this test to (\u00ab) an automatist in the normal state and\n(b) to \" controls \" of the trance state. Quite apart from the\nquestion of survival as such this might well throw much light on\nthe psychology of trance personalities and should certainly be tried.\nI should very much like to receive criticisms of this plan and\nsuggestions as to the best means of carrying out the experiments.\nIn particular I should value the ojiinions of psychologists as\nto the \" uniqueness of such reactions and as to the kind of\nwords which would be m.ost suitable for use as tests.\nW.

Maiich, 1920.\nA GEOUP OF PSYCHICAL EXPERIENCES.\nEditorial Note.\nThe following report of her various psychical experiences was\noriginally sent by Miss Alice MacLellan, of Bridgeport, Conn.,\nU.S.A., to Sir Oliver Lodge, and forwarded by him to the\nSociety. In response to enquiries from tis Miss MacLellan\nobtained corroborative evidence in several cases. In some cases\nit has not been possible for one reason and another to obtain any\ndetailed corroboration, but Miss MacLellon's statement is perfectly\nclear, and the accuracy of her recollection is attested by the corrobo-\nration obtained of other incidents. It seemed best, therefore, to print\nMiss MacLellan s statement as it originally reached us {with a\nfew slight omissions), only breaking up the incidents in order\nto insert corroborative statements.\nWith regard to the last incident in the series, it is evident\nthat this dream made a very great impression on Miss MacLellan,\nand an impression of this sort is not to be dismissed as valueless\nmerely because it is subjective and incommunicable to others.\nAt the same titne, it is to be observed that prophecies concerning\nsuch an event as the end of the recent war have not the same\nevidential value as, for instance, the definite and speedily fulfilled\nprophecy of a railway accident included in Miss MacLellan'\ns\nnarrative (see below, p. 170). Innumerable prophecies were\nmade concerning the end of the war, more or less correct or\nincorrect, as the case might be ; Miss MacLellan's prophetic\nimpression is noticeable not so much for its correctness as for\nthe vividness with which it was stamped upon her mind.\nWe are much indebted to Miss MacLellan for the trouble\nshe has taken in obtaining all possible corroboration. The names\nand addresses of all those from, ivhom corroborative statements have\nbeen obtained have been given to us, but are withheld here at\nMiss MacLellan s request.\nSTATEMENT BY MISS MACLELLAN.\nFrom time to time during my life there have come to me\nstrange dreams which foretold future events ; there have\nbeen dreams in which I gained various items of information\nconcerning trifling personal matters ; and in these last few\n\fMarch, 1920. A Growp of Psychicol Experiences. 167\nyears the dreams have shown me another world, akin to this\none, peopled by those whom we caU \" dead.\" The Scotch\nare said to be gifted with \" second sight,\" and it may be\nthat from some long dead Scotch forebear I may have inherited\nthat trait in a slight degree. It has seemed best to me to\nwrite down some of these experiences, especially since a few\nof them have an apparent value for students of pyschical\nresearch, and there are a few items which are perhaps of an\nunusual value.\nI.\nThe first dream I recall, as one from which any definite\ninformation was gained, came to me about twenty years ago.\nIn the early summer of the year preceding I had lost a\nsmall scarf-pin, attractive in its design and valued for the\nsake of the giver, but of trifling value. At the time of its\nloss there was no recollection in my mind of when or where\nit had last been worn, and after a careful search of the house\nthe pin was given up as lost. The next year (in February,\nif my recollection of the matter is correct) I awoke one\nmorning with a dream still very vividly in my mind. In\nthe dream I had gone up into our attic, pushed aside a\ntrimk, and found the missing scarf-pin lodged in a crevice\nin the floor. On awaking that morning my first act was\nto don a dressing-gown and go hastily to the attic. When\nthe trunk in question was pushed aside, there lay my missing\npin just as in the dream ! I had no conscious knowledge of\nany such spot in the flooring, nor did I remember having\nworn the pin up in the attic. The only explanation which\nsuggests itself to me is that my sub-conscious mind knew\nwhen and where the pin was dropped, and after a lapse of\nmonths succeeded in communicating with my conscious mind\nduring sleep. This is the only theory I have had.\nII.\nIn January of 1899, it happened that I was in Toledo,\nOhio, the guest of an old school friend and former neighbour.\nMy visit was a most happy one, and her friends showed me\na charming hospitality, so that it seemed to me that I had\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1020.\nrarely been so delightfully entertained. One morning some-\nthing waked me very early and the impression came to me\nthat I must leave Toledo at once. Daylight found me puzzling\nover the kindest way to cut short my visit, and to break\nseveral engagements which had been made for me. It was\na rather difficult matter, and my hostess felt rather aggrieved\nthat I permitted a trifling cold to upset our plans. She\n. had a small and very informal card-party planned for the\nnext week, the invitations for which were to be given that\nday. But for some reason I did not then understand it\nwas easier for me to be firm in my decision than to agree\nto stay longer. For two days it was impossible to get a\nreservation on the train east, but on Friday she accompanied\nme to the station and saw me started east again. The\nmoment the train pulled out of the city, the weight which\nhad oppressed me began to be lifted. I felt that I had\nleft some unknown care behind me, and that my decision\nto return east had been wise and just.\nEarly Sunday morning her father died very suddenly, and\nhis funeral was held the very day she had selected for her\ncard-party !\nThis experience made me beheve that somewhere there is\nknowledge of coming events, and that such knowledge can\nbe communicated. In this instance only the fact that it\nwas necessary for me to go home (and thereby to end our\nplanning for the following week) was sent out to me.\nIII.\nIn 1906, while I was in Boston with one of my most intimate\nfriends, she sat for a photograph at the studio of one of\nthe fashionable Back Bay photographers whose work we\ngreatly admired. This was the last week in June. A few\ndays later the proofs were sent her and she selected two\nof them, ordering a number of photographs like each of the\ntwo proofs. The last week in July I met her and inquired\nif she had received her pictures yet, saying that I had hoped\nto have one given me on my birthday, early in August.\nThe night of July 31st there came a dream in which she\ncalled at our house with a package in her hand and said\n\fMakch, 1920. A Group of Psychical Experiences. 169\nthat tlie pictures had arrived but that the photographer\nhad finished up the wrong negatives. As we sat at dinner\non August 1st (my birthday), she came to call on me with\na package of photographs, and said exactly what she had\nsaid in my dream of the previous night.\nIt is still a puzzle to us to know how the mistake could\nhave occurred. The proofs were clearly marked, and the\nphotographer acknowledged his error when his attention was\ncalled to the matter, and sent the other photographs later.\nBut how did I see the mistake ? The pictures were in the\nmail at the time of my dream. Did I see them in the mail\nduring my sleep, or was some one at the office of the photo-\ngrapher cognizant of the error and was this communicated\nto me ? Or was it one of those cases where the uatm'al doubt\nconcerning orders, which may or may not be executed cor-\nrectly, dominated my mind '?\nOr is it true that everything\nwhich happens on this plane of life is but a reflection of that\nwhich has already occurred on the astral plane and in my\ndream did I catch a glimpse of something on the astral plane ?\nCorroborative Statement.\nWhile in Boston during the last week of June, 1906, I had a\nsitting with a photographer there who took a number of pictures\nof me. The proofs were sent to me at Bridgeport and I showed\nthem to iVIiss Ahce MacLellan who had been with me at the\nphotographer's in Boston. From these proofs I selected two and\nsent them back to Boston, ordering pictures finished up Uke both\nof these two particular proofs. About the end of July I met\nMiss MacLellan and she asked if the photographs had yet been\nreceived, adding that she had hoped to have one for her birthday\non August 1st. On the day of August 1st the photographs\narrived, but on opening the package I found that through some\nerror the photographer had finished up the photographs from one\nproof correctly, while he had finished up some photographs from\nanother proof which I did not like and he had omitted to send\nany photographs from the second proof I had selected.\nBut I took the package up to show Miss MacLellan that night.\nMTien she saw me she exclaimed that she had dreamed the pre\\dous\nnight that I came to see her with some photographs and had said\nto her that the photographer had finished up the wrong pictures.\n\f170 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research. Mahch, 1920.\nThis was absolutely true, and it was the particular proof which\nshe preferred that had been omitted. The photographs were in\nthe mail at the time she had this dream, as they had been mailed\nfrom Boston on July 31st, 1906. And when she told me of her\ndream I told her that that was exactly what the photographer\nhad done.\nI returned the photographs to Boston, the photographer apolo-\ngized for the error, and he sent the right photographs later.\n[Signed] G. H. L.\nIV.\nIn July, 1911, came what was at that time the most amazing\nexperience I had had of this sort. On July 8th, 1911, my\nonly sister was married. Two of her college friends were\namong the wedding guests and they remained over Sunday.\nSunday night [July 9, 1911] I dreamed of a terrible railroad\ndisaster. I could see the bodies lying on the ground after\nbeing lifted from the wreck, and distinctly saw some one\ntaken to the Galen Hospital for treatment. At that time\nthe Galen Hospital was a small private hospital, and emergency\ncases were usually taken to one of the large general hospitals,\nor to the Emergency Hospital of the city.\nOn coming down to breakfast my first thought was to\nlook at the morning paper and see if there had been such\na wreck. No such wreck was reported, but my brain was\ntoo absorbed in my dream to permit of my being tactful,\nand I remarked that I had dreamed of a terrible wreck.\nAs our two guests were to leave on a mid-morning train,\nand as my sister was away on her honeymoon, the topic of\nrailroad disasters was hardly a happy one, and was speedily\nlaid aside. When the noon papers were out and there was\nstill no mention of such a catastrophe, it convinced me that\nwhat I had seen in my dream was yet to happen. By this\ntime the matter had gotten on to my nerves quite thoroughly,\nand without doubt I had gotten on to the nerves of my\nfamily. That night, the Federal Express (the night express\nbetween Boston and Washington, or rather in this instance\nrunning from Washington to Boston) went off the viaduct\nat Bridgeport, and the wreck was horrible. And, when the\nfirst \" Extra \" appeared, it announced that one of the first\n\fMakch, 1920. A Group of Psychical Experiences. 171\nthree victims taken from the wreckage was sent to the Galen\nHospital.\nIt has always seemed to me as if in my dream I saw\nthis wreck happen on the astral plane (if that is the proper\nphrase) before it happened on this physical plane. But like\nall such speculations on my part, it is all pure surmise. I\ndo not understand the source of the dream, and am only\nsure of the dream and its horrible realization. [For corrobora-\ntion see below.]\nV.\nIn the fall of 1912 (October, I thinh) we had a letter from\nmy brother who lives in Buffalo, N.Y., saying that he would\nleave for Boston Sunday night, and after transacting his\nbusiness in Boston would stop ofi and see us on his way\nto New York, probably on Tuesday. We heard nothing more\nfrom him, and by Thursday concluded that an urgent wire\nmust have recalled him to Buffalo. On Friday afternoon\n(I think it was Friday) I suddenly remarked, \" There's some-\nthing terrible happening, and it's so near I can feel it.\" In\nan hour or so the newsboys were calling the Extras of the\nWestport wreck, another railroad wreck at Westport a few\nmiles away from Bridgeport. It was impressed on me that\nmy brother was very close to that wreck, and I could feel\nhis presence there. My mother reassured me that he must\nhave been out of New England earlier in the week, and\ntogether we kept my intuition about the matter from my\nfather's knowledge. Several days later we heard from my\nibrother, and as he did not mention the matter I was very\nmuch puzzled. I was absolutely sure that he had been near\nthe wreck.\nSeveral months later he was at home with us for a day,\nand suddenly remarked :\n\" By the way, you people never\nknew how near I came to being in that Westport wreck.\"\nImmediately I exclaimed, \" I told them that you were in\nthat Westport wreck and they wouldn't believe me !\n\"\nHe explained that business had detained him in Boston\nlonger than he had expected, and he had then been obliged\nto go -to Hartford, Conn. He had hurried into the Hartford\nstation that afternoon to take the ill-fated train just in time\nto see it vanishing down the track. Very much annoyed, he\n\f172 Jov\/mal of Society for Psychical Research, bubch, 1920.\nhad waited for the next train, mentally berating himself for\nhis tardiness. When the next New York train came in he\nstarted for New York. At New Haven he heard the news\nof the wreck at Westport, and mentally thanked the Providence\nwhich kept him from being on the wrecked train. At West-\nport the track was still blocked by the burning debris and\nhis train was switched past on another track. So that he\nwas in reality very near the wreck.\nTwo corroborative statements have been obtained concerninff\nthese incidents.

The\nengine and seven cars leaped from the viaduct into the roadway\nbeneath and on to the lawn of the adjacent Horan property.\nThere were twelve people killed outright, and forty-eight people\ninjured.\nIn the list of the injured, the first person mentioned is Joseph\nL. Elkridge of Maryland, and the paper states that his injuries\nwere treated at the Galen Hospital.\nThe files also show that on October 4, 1912, the express from\nBoston, via Hartford, was wrecked near Westport.

Miss MacLellan spoke of these\ntwo impressions before their verification, has made the follo^ving\ncorroborative statement\n:\nOctober 6, 1919.\nI remember very well seeing Miss MacLellan the day before the\nFederal Express wreck, and that she seemed quite agitated about\na dream she had had the previous night, in which she had seen\na terrible wreck. This was on Monday, July 10th, 1911. Early\nthe next morning the Federal Express went of? the track at\nBridgeport, and the wreck was very terrible.\nThe recollection of this incident is very clear because that\nTuesday I took my wife and Miss MacLellan out in my automo-\n\fMarch, 1920.

The three of lis climbed up on the via-\nduct and stood looking down at the wrecked engine and Pullman\nsleeping cars which were thrown clear of the viaduct and part of\nthe wreck lay in a roadway beneath and over on an adjoining\nlawn.\nI also remember hearing her insist after the Westport wreck\nthat her brother was near that \\\\Teck, and my endeavours to\nreassure her, by telling her that so long as she heard nothing\nabout him, or of any man resembling him, she should cease\nworrying about it, for all the victims were carefully listed. She\nseemed certain that he was near the wreck and I knew that she\nhad been greatly depressed the afternoon in which the wreck\noccurred. Several months later it was quite interesting to me to\nlearn of his missing the wrecked train and of his coming along\ndown past the wreckage on a later train.\n[Signed] T. I. F.\nVI.\nThis same year of 1915 there came to me an experience\nof another sort which surprised me. The study of palmistry\nhas always entertained me, for while it seems very absurd\non the surface the results are sometimes amazing. There\nseems to be as much indication of a person's character in\nthe lines of the hand as in the expression of the face. In\nthat book of Lombroso's, The Feviale Offender, you will recall\nthat the author lays great stress on certain marks, on defects\nor exaggerations in the heads and faces of the pictured sub-\njects. While to speak of palmistry is to introduce a subject\nwhich is associated by most people with charlatanry, yet from\nthe marks in the hand a careful observer may learn much.\nCheiro, the famous palmist, has written so much of interest\nin his book on the subject, and included plates of the hands\nof such people as Mrs. Besant, Mme. Melba, the late WiUiam\nT. Stead, the Et. Hon. W. E. Gladstone, and many others\nequally well known, that I have greatly enjoyed studying it.\nAnd, being inveigled into it for charity, I have found it\nquite possible to read hands. Whether all the things I see\nin people's hands come to mxe from the Lines, or whether\nthere is some unconscious mind-reading about it. I do not\nknow. It amazed me to find that a sign known to palmists\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1920.\nas the \" Mystic Cross \" which appears in both the hands of\nMrs. Besant and Mr. Stead is also in my own hand. But\nthe following experience has robbed it of any amusement or\npleasure for me.\nIn 1915, being in New York one Saturday at an opera\nmatinee, I went out to the suburbs to spend Saturday night\nand Sunday with some of my most intimate and dearest\nfriends. The husband has been my friend since our babyhood,\nour mothers having been close friends since girlhood. His\nwife and I have been warm friends ever since we met, and\ntheir home has always been a very happy rooftree under\nwhich I have spent many pleasant days. After dinner that\nnight, we began a game of dummy bridge, three-handed.\nWe had been playing for some time when I suddenly remarked\nto N., who was dealing, \" You've a mighty interesting hand.\"\nHe and I have been such chums since childhood that he\ncommenced to chafE me, and to assure me that he knew\nme as a palmist to be a genuine fakir, etc. But his wife\nwanted to have me read his hand, and finally (after I had\nread hers) he gave me his hand to read, although he did\nnot cease his ridicule of the whole subject of palmistry. When\nhe gave me his hand across the card-table he looked at me\na bit queerly. I know now that it must have been beseech-\ningly, but I did not guess it then.\nAfter looking at it a few moments I was utterly puzzled,\nand said, \" Why, I can't read your hand.\" He pulled it away\nvery quickly, but his wife wanted to know why it seemed\nunreadable. Finally I said, \" It's not like you at all ! Why,\nyou've got the hand of a crook.\" At this he pretended to\nbe terribly aggrieved, but I explained that probably there\nwere certain httle lines which by their relative positions\ncounterbalanced the tendency of the main lines, and that\nthat was what puzzled me.\nHe teased me unmercifully about my palmistry, and carried\nthe matter oi5 with a great deal of ridicule, varying his teasing\nby pretending to be terribly insulted. It was a puzzle to me\nhow such a man as I had always known him to be could\nhave such a hand.\nLast year he committed suicide. This was attributed to\noverwork. His death was a great grief to me. A few days\n\fMarch, 1920. A Gro^ip of Psychical Experiences. 175\nafter his deatli I saw him in my dreams, and he seemed\nto be attempting to explain something to me. He seemed\nvery anxious and worried lest I should condemn him. I\nwoke myself out of a sound sleep exclaiming, \" It's all right,\n\u2014\nIt's all right !\n\" A few days later I was horrified to learn\nthat he committed suicide when he could no longer conceal\nhis embezzlements from estates of which he was trustee, and\nthat at the time I read his palm in 1915 he was carrying\npoison in his pocket every day so if he were apprehended\nhe might commit suicide at once.\nDid I see into his mind, or did I read it in his hand ?\nI have not yet gotten over the shock of his death.\nVII.\nIn the spring of 1918, at Easter-time, there came a dream\nin which I seemed to be talking with a former acquaintance\nof mine. We had met but a few times about ten years\npreviously. Her home for a number of years was in the\ncity of New York, and I had once been a guest at dinner\nand over-night at her apartment. She had also dined with\nme at the hotel where I was stopping. For years I had\nheard nothing of her beyond that about ten years ago she\nwent to Paris as the representative of an American business\nhouse. She was an extremely clever woman, and had attracted\nme greatly. For two or three days I seemed to be haunted\nby her memory, although unable to understand why she\nshould come to my mind so persistently. A few days later\nthe New York papers printed the news of her death. She\nand her secretary were killed in the church of St. Gervais\non Good Friday when the Boches shelled Paris with their\nlong-range gun.\nVIII.\nThese later years have brought to me a kind of dream\nwhich is quite unlike any other variety of dream in my\nmemory. I frequently find myself in a beautiful unknown\ncountry. It seems to be a world very much hke this one,\nonly much more beautiful. The light is always very brilliant\nand the atmosphere has a quality very different from that\nin which I hve. There seems to be a flood of the most golden\n\f17 (J Journal of Society for Psychical Research, biakch, 1920.\nyellow sunshine over everything ; the sea and sky have the\ngorgeous colouring of the Southern seas and skies ; there\nare beautiful trees and flowers to be seen, but never a faded\nflower nor a withered leaf. And all the people whom I meet\nin this dream country are the people whom we call \" dead.\"\nThey talk to me and seem very much like themselves. These\ndreams come to me at different intervals of time ; there seems\nto be no regularity about their coming.\nThe most important message which has ever come to me\ncame at the beginning of the year 1918, either one of the\nlast days of 1917 or among the earliest days of 1918, and\ntherefore ante-dates these last two experiences. But it has\nseemed wisest to me to put it at the end rather than in\nits chronological order.\nIn this dream I found myself once more in this beautiful\ncountry where the dead live. In the easy manner of such\nhappenings in this other world I was soon engaged in con-\nversation with the most delightful man I have ever seen.\nHe was an elderly man, of about medium height, though\nhe may have seemed shorter than was actually the fact\nbecause he was a trifle heavily built for his height. He was\na man of very great dignity, and combined with this was a\nmost delightful simplicity of manner and the greatest personal\ncharm. When he spoke it was with the assurance of a man\nwhose opinions must of necessity carry weight. It is quite\nimpossible for me to express in words his wonderful personality,\nbut I have never seen so altogether charming and perfect\nmanners before nor since. Dignity and assurance without the\nfaintest trace of arrogance or hauteur ; the appearance of an\nintense interest in the afi\"airs of this world ; and a supreme\nkindliness ; these were the \"\nstrongly accented characteristics\nwhich made a most overwhelming impression upon me.\nHis first remark which I recall was this :\n\" England has\nbeen going through a very terrible time.\"\nTo this my reply was that it was a very terrible time for\nall the world.\nIn this he immediately acquiesced, adding, \" But the end\nis very much nearer than you think.\"\nOn my expressing the hope that the prophecy would prove\nto be true, he replied, \" It is tn;e.\"\n\fMarch, 1920. A Group of Psychical Experiences. 117\nContinuing the conversation lie said that there would come\nsome news favourable to the AUies in a comparatively short\ntime ; that not long after there would be a surprising happen-\ning ; and that then the end would come at once. He added,\n\" The end will come so suddenly as to be amazing !\n\"\nDespite the doleful predictions as to the length of the\nstruggle with which w^e Americans (and nearly every one\nelse) had been somewhat depressed in spirit, I believed him\nabsolutely. He seemed to be so wise, to have such a tremen-\ndous affection for England and her Allies, and to be so certain\nof the truth of his statement, that I was convinced. Then\nit seemed to me that I should like to know the identity of\nthe man with whom I was talking. So, a little shyly and\na trifle abashed by my own temerity in asking the question,\nI said, \" I really should very much like to know who you\nare !\n\"\nThe smile with which he received this remark was the\nmost radiant and charming smile imaginable as he quietly\nsaid, with just a glint of amusement in his eyes, \" I suppose\nthat you would call me '\nthe late King Edward.'\n\"\n^ :fc iji *\nOn awaking in the morning, this dream was so vividly\nbefore me that every detail of it seemed real. I was con-\nvinced that in some inexplicable way the message had come\nfrom the Beyond, that for a few moments it had been my\nprivilege to see through the veil which separates the two\nstates of being. The tremendous import of the dream amazed\nme, but never for a moment was there a doubt of the truth\nof the statement about the ending of the Great War.\nIt seemed to me that this message was of such importance\nas to warrant establishing its receipt beyond any doubt.\nTherefore I took pains to tell of my dream to a few friends\nwho could vouch for the fact that such a dream was told\nto them months before the ending of the Great War. To\nothers I merely stated my opinion that the war would end\nin 1918. The opposition which this view met was extreme.\nFrom all sources of information came the word that the war\nwould continue for one, two, three, or even five years. And\nto any and all who expressed any opinion of such long duration\nior the war, I said that the war would end very shortly,\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1920.\nand left them to consider me a fool, a victim of delusion,\nor a stupid sentimentalist who wanted the war to end and\ntherefore believed it would end. No amount of argument\nchanged my opinion nor my expression of that opinion. I\nfirmly believed (and believe to-day) that the message came\nfrom the Beyond ; that those who dwell in that other world-\nhave prior knowledge of events in this world.\nCorroborative Statements.\nSeptember 5, 1919.\nOne evening in March, 1918, Miss Alice MacLellan who lives\"\nacross the street from us, was spending part of an evening with\nus, and we were discussing the Great War in its various aspects.\nBridgeport has been a munition- making centre for years, and that\nfact has made the war a particular and vital interest to many of its\ncitizens, for the problem of housing and caring for the vast\nnumber of workers who have flocked here during the war has\nbeen difficult of solution. It is a patriotic city and the citizens\nof native and foreign birth have worked together to raise money\nfor the Liberty Loans, the Red Cross, and the various war\nactivities. All of this made up a part of our talk, and we were\nputting into words something of the widespread desire for the\nending of the conflict, when she asked if we would like to hear of\na dream she had some time before, foretelling the end of the war.\nShe then told us of a dream she had in which she seemed to be\nin another world, and that she had had a talk with a man there\nwho told her that the war was much nearer its end than was\ngenerally supposed. He told her that something surprising would\nhappen and that then the war would stop immediately, and added\nthat the end would come so suddenly as to be amazing. When she\nasked him with whom she was speaking, he told her that he\nsupposed that she would call him \" the late King Edward.\"\nThis was a somewhat unusual dream, but she seemed to have\nconfidence that it told the truth, and in opposition to the belief,\nthen general, that the war would continue for years' she insisted\nthat the war was nearing its end.\nPeople here were imbued with the idea that it would take a\nfew years to finish the conflict, so that her dream was by no\nmeans in accord with public opinion.\nWe thought it a very interesting and unusual dream, and when\n\fMarch, 1920.

P. 0.\nJ. 0.\nAugust 26, 1919.\nOne Sunday in the late summer of 1918, about the beginnings\nof September, Miss Alice MacLellan was at our home and we were\ntalking over the outlook for the Allies, and the probable length\nof time before the ending of the war. All opinions which had\ncome to us from supposedly authoritative sources expressed the\nidea that the war would continue for a long time, perhaps years.\nShe was very decided in her expressed belief that the war would\nbe finished in the autumn of 1918, and that, despite all advices\nfrom military and other- sources, the war was nearly over. Finally\nshe asked if we would be interested in a dream of hers, and, on\nour expressing a desire to hear it, told us that she had had a\ndream at the beginning of 1918 in which she seemed to be in\nanother world and talking with a very interesting elderly man\nwho told her that England had been going through a terrible\ntime, but that the war was nearly over. He said that something\nvery surprising would happen, and that then the end would come\nat once, and come so suddenly as to be amazing. She asked him\nwho he was, and he replied that he supposed she would call him\nthe late King Edward.\nThis prophecy seemed to be quite preposterous in the light of\nwhat we were being told relative to military affairs.\nMiss MacLellan seemed very confident that her dream was a true\nprophecy, and relating it as she did it impressed itself on our\nminds.\nOne other detail :\n\u2014Dr. F had been waiting a call to service\nfor some time, and she told him that he would not be in the\nservice very long, and he did not report for duty until the day\nafter the armistice was signed.\n[Signed] E.

In relation to the dream in\nwhich the ending of the Great War was foretold to her, she told\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. march, 1920\nme of this dream the next day, and from that time on she never\nfaltered in her belief nor in the expression of that belief that the\nwar was near its end.

Some came from military\nand Red Cross sources, but to everyone she expressed the opinion\nthat the war would be over in 1918. I know of one case where\nshe had a little talk about the war with a well-known lawyer\nhere. She told him that the war would be over in the autumn.\n{This was in August, 1918.)

OSBORNE LEONARD.\"\nBy Miss M. Radclyffe-Hall.\nRegarding the recent paper written by myself and (Una)\nLady Troubridge (see Proceedings, Part LXXVIIL, Vol. XXX.),\nafter some consideration we decided to present a copy of\nthe Proceedings in question to Mrs. Leonard, the medium\nthrough whom all the evidence recorded in our paper was\nobtained.\nIt seemed almost childish to deprive Mrs. Leonard of the\npleasure which we knew she would feel on receiving our\npermission to read the evidence in question, since she had\ntold us that many of her sitters were talking about the\npaper at some length, one of them at least having offered\nto lend her the Proceedings. Again, a fairly full description\nof the evidence has recently appeared in Light, and been\nseen by her. In any case she must be taken to have read\nthe paper once it has appeared in print, so that for the\npurpose of all future A. V. B. evidence, everything that is\non record in the paper will need to be discounted.\nIt may, we think, be of some interest to those who have\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apkil-May, 1920.\nread our paper, if we comment briefly upon the waking\nMrs. Leonard's impression of her trance speaking in this\ninstance. There are three points in the evidence which she,\nin the normal state, has remarked upon to us.\nOne point in particular appears to have impressed her,\nbecause she feels that it is unusual. She tells us that when\nreading the paper, she was conscioiis of a feeling of complete\ndetachment, that she felt that the trance utterances therein\nset forth could not have been made by her. She tells us\nthat try as she would, she could not feel that the paper had\nanything to do with her personally, and that moreover she\nfelt herself to be an entire stranger to the purporting com-\nmunicator, A. V. B. She states that nothing she read seemed\ncapable of stirring the faintest chord of memory in her.\nThis surprises Mrs. Leonard, because we gather that it is\nnot invariably the case. When she has read other recent\npublications concerned with deceased persons who have pur-\nported to communicate through her, she has apparently felt\nthat she knew the personalities, and that what she was reading\nwas vaguely familiar. I gather that although she has almost\ncomplete amnesia of all that occurs during her trance, the\namnesia is not always proof against a direct stimulus to\nmemory, such as would be afliorded by a clear record, read\nby her in the normal state, of what she has said and done\nwhen in trance. Several of these recent records referred\nto have been available to Mrs. Leonard, so that she is able\nto form a judgment on this point. I myself know that\nMrs. Leonard has told me in the past that if she allows herself\nto become quiescent or drowsy directly after a sitting, frag-\nments of phrases and detached names will float across *her\nmind, phrases and names for which she can find no normal\nassociation, and which, therefore, she has grown to associate\nwith something that has occurred during a sitting. She\nhas told me that subsequent to any sitting she purposely\navoids the quiescent and drowsy condition which appears to\nbe productive of this fragmentary memory. We have come\nto the conclusion, however, that to all intents and purposes\nthe amnesia is practically complete, unless she permits the\nconditions above mentioned, or applies the direct stimulus\nto her memory of reading her own trance utterances, though\n\fApeil-Mat, 1920. A Note on a Series of Sittings. 185\neven when the three conditions above referred to are present,\nI gather that she cannot remember things in any detail\nIt is strange that the sense of familiarity which she has\nnoticed when reading other publications about her trance\nutterances, should be so completely absent in this case, for,\nnot only have Lady Troubridge and I, we think, had a greater\nnumber of regular sittings than any other sitters with Mrs. Leonard^\nbut all our sittings have been wholly or partially concerned\nwith the communicator A. V. B. Moreover, since our\npaper on Leonard evidence was completed, the A. V. B.\nControl, spoken of in the paper, has greatly developed,\nincreasing in interest and characteristic features.\nThe next point in the evidence upon which Mrs. Leonard\ncomments, will be found on page 412 of Proceedings, Vol. XXX.\nBy reference to the above page it will be seen that we\ncommented upon the fact that Feda corrected her original\npronunciation of the word \" Cruz.\" After pronouncing the\nplace in question ''\nCruz,\" she corrected her pronunciation\nto \" Cruth,\" the latter being the Spanish pronunciation, and\nincidentally the pronunciation that would have been used\nby the purporting communicator A. V. B., who was acquainted\nwith Spanish, but not the pronunciation that is habitually\nused by English people, especially if they are untravelled.\nIn fact, we thought at the time that this point was of some\ninterest. But Mrs. Leonard now states that she once tried\nto learn Spanish, and that she retains a sufficient memory\nof her efforts in that direction to be aware that the name\nin question although spelt \" Cruz,\" should be pronounced\nas \" Cruth.\" She says that she would have told me this\nhad I asked her, and knowing her as well as I do, I am\nconvinced that she would have done so. I admit, however,\nthat it never occurred to either Lady Troubridge or me to\nraise this point with Mrs. Leonard, and had it done so, I\nthink that we should have thought it inadvisable to mention\nto the waking Mrs. Leonard a name closely connected with\nevidence then being obtained.\nFinally, Mrs. Leonard comments upon a curious mention\nof an \" Ark \" which occurs on pages 390-391. This mention\nof an \" Ark \" by A. V. B. had no meaning for us at the\ntime, nor have we been able to trace the reference since.\na2\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April-May, 1920.\nWe thought, however, that we had obtained a clue to\nits possible source, through a conversation which we had\nwith the medium in 1917. Some remarks of Mrs. Leonard's\non that occasion led us to suppose that she liked house-boats,\nand that in her opinion they provided an enjoyable form\nof vacation, and we understood that her liking was based\non experience. This was the reason why we put forward\nthe hypothesis that the medium's memory of house-boats\nhad intruded itself at that point in the sitting when the\nmysterious \" Ark \" was mentioned. Feda, in speaking of\nthis Ark, went on to say \" Feda thinks like Noah had.\"\nCertainly a house-boat is strongly suggestive of a Noah's\nArk. But Mrs. Leonard, having now read the paper, states\nthat we misunderstood her regarding her having ever spent\na vacation on a ^ottse-boat ; this she says she has never\ndone, though at one period of her life she spent much time\non a sailing boat. She tells us, however, that in the summer\nof 1917, shortly before the conversation above mentioned,\nshe had, while house hunting, seen several advertisements\nof house-boats, and that she and her husband had considered\nthe question of taking one that year, and this we think must\nhave been the source of the impression which she conveyed\nto us. This question of her taking a house-boat did not,\nhowever, arise until 1917, whereas the reference to the \" Ark \"\noccurred in 1916. (See page 389.) So that we cannot suppose\nthat the house-boats of the advertisement influenced this\nstatement regarding an \" Ark \" which was made a year before\nthe advertisement in question was seen. In Mrs. Leonard's\nopinion her mind was in no way responsible for that reference.\nI have carefully questioned Mrs. Leonard regarding our\npaper as a whole, asking her to put forward any further\nremarks that she may wish to make, but she tells me that\nbeyond the three points which I have mentioned she finds\nnothing to comment upon.\nCASE.\nP. 293. The Woodd Warnings.\nIn an article by F. W. H. Myers on The Subliminal Self\n{Proc, SP.R., Vol. XL, p. 334 ff.) there appears (p. 538 ff.)\n\fApril-May, 1920. Case. 187\na report concerning tlie traditional warning received on various\noccasions by members of the Woodd family ; this record\nextends over a period of three centuries.\nThe earliest account appeared in Dr. Robert Plot's Natural\nHistory of Oxfordshire (edited 1677), thus :\nI must add also a Relation, as strange as it is true, of the\nFamily of one Captain Wood, late of Bampton, Oxfordshire,\nnow of Brise Norton, Captain in the late Wars for the King.\nSome whereof before their death have had warning given them\nby a certain knocking, either at the door without or on a table\nor shelves within ; the number of streaks and distance between\nthem, and the place where, for the most part respecting the\ncircumstances of the person to dye, or their deaths themselves. . . .\nIt is subsequently explained that, according to tradition,\nif the knock is heard within the house, it portends the death\nof some immediate member of the family residing there ; if\nit is outside, then the person to die is a relative or near\nfriend residitig elsewhere.\nThe article in Proceedings records seven occasions upon\nwhich the warning appears to have been received. One\nof these occurred in 1893 upon the occasion of the death of\nMr. C. H. L. Woodd. The warning was heard by two members\nof the family, quite independently of each other, and one\nof these two was Mr. Woodd's son, the Rev. T. B. Woodd.\nIt now appears that Mr. T. B. Woodd has heard the\nwarning once again. On October 30, 1919, he sent to the\nSecretary, Miss Newton, the following account of his experience\n:\nOn Monday, October 20th, 1919, at about 9.30 p.m., I was walking\nupstairs and I heard a strange knocking outside the house\n(S. John's Vicarage, Fitzroy Square). I called my servant, Cyril\nCooke, and asked him whether he heard it and what it was.\nHe could not say. I said, \" It is the Woodd knocking. Some\none is going to die.\" On Wednesday, Oct. 22nd, I was called\nby telegram to see my cousin. Miss Katharine Isabella Basil\nWoodd, as she was very ill, at her residence Zetland House,\nKensington. (I had written that very day inviting myself to\nlunch on the following Saturday, not knowing she was unwell.)\nShe died at 7.30 next morning, Oct. 23rd. My servant reported\nwhat I had said to my housekeeper, Lydia Wilkins. I did not\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April-May, 1920.\nremember it again imtil Saturday, the 25th. CjTil Cooke had\nnever heard of the family superstition and rather laughingly\ntold my housekeeper I thought someone would die.\nTudor Basil-Woodd.\nI certify the above is correct.\nJ. H. Cyril Cooke,\nLydia Wilkins.\nIn reply, Miss Newton wrote that we should like to have\nindependent accounts from the two servants, and should\nlike also to ask a few questions ; she suggested that she\nshould call and see Mr. Woodd. This she accordingly did\nby appointment on November 21st, 1919, and we give below\nher report of the interview :\nOn Friday morning, Nov. 21, 1919, I called ujoon Mr. Woodd,\nand he told me that he had not heard the \" warning \" since\nthe occasion on which his father died in 1893 {Proc, S.P.R.,\nVol. XI. p. 540). As it was not clear from his account whether\nhis servant, Cyril Cooke, had heard the knocking, Mr. Woodd\nkindly sent for him, and in reply to my questions, Cyril told me\nthat he heard the knocking, which seemed to him to be in the\nnext house, as if some one was knocking nails in the wall. The\nknocks, he said, came in threes\u2014and that Mr. Woodd said that\nit was the Woodd warning, and some one would die. He had\nnot heard Mr. Woodd speak of hearing knockings before, or of\nthe \" Woodd warning.\" He had told Mrs. Wilkins about it.\nI asked Cyril to write a brief account of what he remembered\nof the incident, and he went away and brought me the following\naccount, together with that of Mrs. Wilkins, about half an hour\nafter. Cyril Cooke looks about sixteen or seventeen. Mr. Woodd\ntold me he had not been long with him.\nMr. Woodd then sent for Mrs. Wilkins, who told me that she\nhad nearly forgotten about it, but she seemed sure that Cyril\nCooke had told her the following morning that Mr. Woodd had\nsaid that some knockings he and Cyril had heard were the\n\" Woodd warning.\" Mrs. Wilkins knew of the \" warning.\" She\nwent away to write her account, which is appended.\nThe two statements handed by Mr. Woodd's servants to\nMiss Newton were as follows :\nNovember 21, 1919.\nAt about eight o'clock on 20 Oct. I heard a strange knocking\n\fApeil-May, 1920. Case. 189\nas I was going upstairs. Thinking it was some one in the next\nhouse I said nothing of it. Then about an hour after, Mr.\nWoodd called me up and asked me if I had heard the Woodd\nknocking, and I said I had heard some knocking, but could not\nsay what it was. [Signed] Cyril Cooke.\nNovember 21, 1919.\nOn 21st Oct. Cyril Cooke told me that he had heard some-\none knocking in the next house. Then about an hour after he\ntold me that Mr. Woodd said the knocking he heard was the\nWoodd knocking, a sign that someone in the Woodd Family was\ngoing to die. [Signed] Lydia Wilkins.\nIt will be seen that according to Cyril Cooke's account\ngiven above, he heard the knocking at about 8 p.m., whereas\nMr. Woodd heard it at about 9.30 p.m. It is not clear\nwhether Cyril Cooke heard any knocking at the time when\nMr. Woodd heard it.\nIn a further eflort to clear up this point Miss Newton\nwrote to Mr. Woodd as follows :\n2m November, 1919.\nWe feel that as one of the witnesses records the knockings\nas having been heard at 8 o'clock and also an hour afterwards,\nit would be an advantage to the case to have a further statement\non this point, as I note that in your account you do not describe\nthe. knockings nor say how long they lasted. Did you only hear\nthem when you went upstairs at 9.30 ? And, if so, were you\nat home earlier in the evening ?\nI am very sorry to trouble you again, but the confusion on\nthis point weakens the evidence. I Newton,\n, . (Secretary).\nIn reply to the above letter Mr. Woodd wrote as follows :\nNovember 27, 1919.\nIt is so hard to get a clear statement from people of this\nkind. Cyril Cooke now says he first heard the knocks in the\nstudy about '^6 o'clock and as he went upstairs they seemed\nto follow him up. He is not clear, but thinks he heard them\nagain when I did at 9.30. T was certainly out at 6 . . . He now\nthinks he didn't hear them when I did, and I think the last\ntime he heard them was 7.15. I dined at 7.30, and probably\ncame in at about 7.20.\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April-Mat, 1'J20.\nI heard them only once, 9.30, and they did not continue for\nmore than a few seconds, I should say not more than 3\nknocks in all. T. Basil-Woodd.\nIt will be apparent from the above statements that the\nevidence given by Cyril Cooke is not to be relied upon. The\nboy evidently became confused, and we cannot clearly ascertain\nwhether he heard any knocking at the time when it was\nheard by Mr. Woodd, namely, about 9.30 p.m., or not. This\nis unfortunate, since it prevents our getting any corroborative\nevidence as to the nature and duration of the sounds heard,\nand especially as to their objective character.\nWhat, however, emerges clearly from the report is that\nMr. Woodd heard, or thought he heard, some knocking at\nabout 9.30 p.m. on October 20, 1919, and that he interpreted\nthe sounds at the time as the Woodd warning. This point\nwas adhered to by Cyril Cooke throughout, and is corroborated\nby the statement of the housekeeper Lydia Wilkins. In\nview of the fact that Mr. Woodd does not believe himself\nto have heard the warning since the death of his father\nin 1893 and that its traditional meaning was fulfilled a few\ndays later by the sudden death of Mr. Woodd's cousin, we\nhave put the case on record as a sequel to the earlier report\npublished in Proceedings.\nA notice of Miss Woodd's death appeared in the Times\nof October 27, 1919, thus :\nWoodd.\u2014On the 23rd Oct., at 14, Zetland House, Kensington,\nKatharine Isabella Basil Woodd, youngest daughter of the\nlate Basil Thomas Woodd, D.L., J.

LEONARD.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014Those of us who are interested in the question of the\nsurvival of personality after death\u2014in my view, beyond all com-\nparison the most momentous question that can occupy the human\n\fApeil-Mat, 1920. Correspondence. 191\nmind\u2014owe, I think, a debt of gratitude to Miss Radclyffe-Hall\nand Lady Troubridge for the report which their careful and\nlaborious work has contributed to its study. I feel, however,\nthat\u2014particularly at a time when the froth of popular credulity\nand sentimentality appears to have risen unusually high\u2014our\nmethods of inquiry cannot be too rigorous, our guard against\nunwarranted assumption too watchful and unwearying ; and I will\ntherefore ask your permission to discuss briefly two points arising\nout of the report.\nUpon the first point I wrote privately to Miss Radclyfie-Hall\nsome time ago ; and in her reply she most kindly reviewed the\nmatter at length, but without removing my difficulty. It is con-\ncerned with the incident of the dog Billy,\" particularly the\npainful examination of his toes. The authors of the report seem\nto regard this as a piece of excellent evidence for survival. They\ndo not indeed expressly say so, but the standpoint that they are\nfurnishing evidence for survival is, I think, implicit in the whole\nreport, and this particular incident is evidently felt to be of\nexceptionally good evidential quality, because it was unknown to\nanyone present at the sitting. I agree as to its importance, but\nmy reason for thinking it so is the reverse of theirs. How the\ninformation involved was obtained by the medium is, in the present\nconnection, irrelevant ; the point of moment, in my view, is that\nits receipt is not evidence for survival, because the facts were\nunknown to anyone who had died. This important gap in the\nchain of evidence seems to have been overlooked by the experi-\nmenters, or at least to have been imperfectly seized. So far from\naffording evidence for survival, the incident seems to me to\nconstitute one of the most serious blows to that hypothesis to be\nfound- in the records of the Society. For it provides a concrete\ninstance of a correct statement of fact rejjresented as coming from\na discarnate mind, which demonstrably could not have emanated\nfrom such a source.\nMy second criticism is concerned with professional mediumship\nin general, and I use the present report only as a convenient\npretext for bringing it to the front. On the hypothesis of survival\nand communication, I have never been able to understand the\napparent necessity, in connection with mediumistic phenomena,\nfor the presence of a \" sitter \"\u2014that is, of a friend of the deceased\nperson or persons purporting to communicate, as distinguished from\nthe experimenter. The old analogy of a traveller, returning to\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April-May, 1920.\ncivilization after being lost for forty years in the wilds of the\nworld throws no light on the matter. Such a man would have\nto give identifying details about himself to the first person he\nmet, who, in turn, would have to verify them : he would not\nneed his friends to be present before he could tell his story. In\ncommon, no doubt, with most members of the Society, I have\ndeceased friends who were interested in the question of survival,\nfriends with whom I discussed it. If survival be a fact and\ncommunication possible, I should expect them, like our returned\ntraveller, to send me a message with identifying particulars through\nthe first channel that presented itself, asking any one present to\nforward it to me. I find the strain on probability becomes too\nsevere when I am asked to suppose that they would do that only\nupon my going to a medium and paying a fee. Such a supposi-\ntion would appear to require us to set up in the beyond some\nsort of doorkeeper or \" chucker-out \" of spirits for whom friends\non this side had purchased no tickets of admission.\nFrom the point of view of professional mediumship, however,\nI can see the vital importance of having the occurrence of pheno-\nmena dependent upon the personal attendance of a \" sitter\n\"\nor friend. It is the essential condition, indeed, the corner-stone\nsupporting the professional fabric : for it is manifest that people in\ngeneral would not pay for communications represented as coming\nfrom strangers to them, however accurate the statements might\nprove to be and however consequently valuable\u2014indeed, in-\nvaluable\u2014from the point of view of science. Looking at the\nmatter in that light, I feel disposed, for my part, to conjecture\nthat, not only this \" sitter \" convention, but perhaps also the\ncasting of phenomena in the form of communication from the\ndead, have been subliminally developed in the interests of pro-\nfessional mediumship.\nIt may be said in objection to this view that the \" sitter\n\"\npractice has obtained also with non-professional mediums, such\nas Mrs. Thomson. I feel inclined to reply that professional\nmediumship has so habituated us to it, that it has probably never\noccurred to any one to make a serious effort to dispense with it.\nStudy of the two short records of Mrs. Thomson's case reveals\nmany incidents suggesting that with her a \" sitter \" was by no\nmeans indispensable. I have a recollection, for instance, of\nseveral references to Nelly having been found \" chatting volubly\n\"\nwhen no one at all was present. Nelly had not the pecuniary\n\fApbil-May, 1920. CorresjMndence. 193\ninterests of her primary in her charge : she could waste her sweet-\nness on the desert air, or to non-paying strangers, to her heart's\ncontent.\nThe dispensableness of the sitter is even more evident in the\ncase of Mrs. Willett, through whom has been obtained what is,\nin my view, the most impressive evidence for survival yet pre-\nsented to the world. She has got rid, not only of the \" sitter\n\"\nfetish, with all the sentimentality and personal\n'\"'\nslush that goes\nwith it, but also of the \" control \" fetish. One could hope,\nindeed, that her mediumship might be taken as a model : but I\nfear it is a hope most unlikely to be fulfilled. For the profes-\nsional's subliminal\u2014which, like all subliminals, no doubt, is its\nprimary's most obedient servant, unwear}angly intent upon serving\nits desires and prejudices\u2014is probably quite cute enough to know\nthat the public is not going to pay any guineas for an \" Ear of\nDionysius.\"\nHubert Wales.\nA REPLY TO MR. HUBERT WALES'S LETTER.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014While thanking Mr. Hubert Wales for the appreciative\nmanner in which he refers to our recent paper on Leonard\nphenomena, both Lady Troubridge and I are anxious to avail\nourselves of the opportunity of replying to some of the points\nraised in his letter ; the more so as he appears to be under a\nmisapprehension, due doubtless to some lack of lucidity in the\npaper in question, but which indicates that we have in at least\none instance failed to convey to a reader a correct impression of\nour attitude towards the phenomena.\nWe cordially agree with Mr. Wales that methods of enquiry\ninto psychical phenomena cannot be too rigorous, and in fact\nwould go beyond his demands and add that we consider that\nthey should invariably be so irrespective of popular credulity or\nof any public opinion, and we welcome the discussion of any\naspect of any incident recorded by us that may have struck a\ncareful reader.\nAs regards Mr. Wales's comments on the incident of the dog\n\" Billy,\" however, we cannot see that he makes good his argument\nthat because the facts regarding certain of \" Billy's \" symptoms\nwere unknown to the purporting communicator, A. V. B., during\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil-Mat, 1920.\nher lifetime, their reception as emanating from her surviving\ninteUigence is evidence against her survival or that of any one\nelse.\nIf Mr. Wales is going to view with suspicion any signs of\na deceased intelligence having acquired new knowledge of any sort\nsubsequently to bodily death, I think he should be prepared to\ntell us why, in his opinion, granted the possibility of survival\nwith personaUty sufficiently unimpaired to make communication\nwith and recognition by incarnate survivors possible, we should\nassume a total cessation of the faculty of acquiring knowledge,\neither from incarnate or from other discarnate sources.\nIs Mr. Wales by any chance a disciple of a certain clerical\nauthor who has perpetrated a harrowing work in which he tells\nus that the departed, even those of the most meritorious nature,\nlose instantaneously practically all the faculties which they enjoyed\non this earth, becoming aimless bits of spiritual thistledown, and\nrefraining perforce from any effort at communication with this\nearth, a privilege monopolised entirely by those who accept the\nassistance of the Devil and his angels ?\nPersonally we cannot see why, granted for the sake of argument\na surviving A. V. B., she should come to a full stop on leaving\nthis world, and if she retains any faculties at all, as we imder-\nstand them, why not the faculty of obtaining information useful\nto the work she has in hand, by telepathic or other means\nwhich, for all we know to the contrary, may be available,\n\u2014\neither from incarnate persons who do possess the requisite data,\nor in some cases from other discarnate intelligences.\nIn the case of the dog \" Billy,\" we are not in a position\nto say for certain that no one had died in possession of the\nfacts regarding his ailments\u2014possibly some one known to the\nveterinary surgeon may have heard his case discussed, and sub-\nsequently died prior to the mention of \" Billy \" at Mrs. Leonard's\n;\nin any case, we cannot see, if A. V. B. survives at all, why her\ndifficulty in ascertaining the facts she required for the getting up\nof her case should have been any greater than ours in verifying\nthem. It must be remembered that we have every reason to\nthink that she did know, prior to her death, that \" Billy \" had\nexisted, and she may have known that he had spent his latter\nhfe at Boscombe. She may therefore, hypothetically, have known\nwhere to go for her facts. Or, supposing she had lacked even\nthat knowledge, why should she not have found in Lady Trou-\n\fApbil-May, 1920. Correspondence. 195\nbridge's mind the facts known to the latter concerning \" Billy,\"\nand learnt from her of Boscombe as a likely source of further\ninformation ? We cannot prove that she did either of these\nthings, or that she did neither the one nor the other ; and we\ncannot prove that Mrs. Leonard, Feda, or any one else incarnate\nobtained telepathically facts which we are satisfied were unknown\nto the medium normally. Therefore, in our opinion, the \" Billy\n\"\nincident, Hke so many others, neither proves nor disproves any-\nthing, except that facts do get communicated from one intelUgence\nto another in a way which we cannot as yet regulate or under-\nstand, and that brings us back (after many days, so to speak)\nto the misapprehension under which we believe Mr. \"Wales to be\nlabouring, namely, that in our paper we intended to convey\nthat among the evidence presented for consideration we considered\nthe \" Billy \" incident as pre-eminently good evidence of survival.\nIn our paper we intended to make it clear that we offered no\nopinion as to the source or explanation of the phenomena dealt\nwith, beyond a statement that in many instances we considered\nthe explanation of normal knowledge on the part of the medium\nas quite insufficient ;\nbut, had we been asked to express our\nopinion as to what particular incident, if any, among those dealt\nwith, was particularly suggestive of survival, we should both\nimhesitatingly have selected the incident of \" Daisy's Second\nFather,\" in preference not only to the \" Billy \" incident, but to any\nother phenomena recorded in the paper, with the exception\nperhaps of certain characteristic mannerisms observed by us in the\nso-called \" Personal Control.\"\nThe latter part of Mr. Wales's letter does not really concern\nus personally, but since he has set the ball rolling, we feel in-\nclined to give it a push gratuitously. Mr. Wales complains that\na \" sitter \" personally known to the purporting communicators\nappears an indispensable adjunct of mediumistic phenomena. He\nsuggests that the discarnate, if they can communicate at all,\nshould dispense with the presence of a receiving intelligence\nknown to them and either thrust their evidence upon any stranger\nwho has ears to hear, or possibly, like Nelly, \" chat volubly\n\"\nto an empty room.\nWe cannot see what would be gained by either of these exped-\nients. Hypothetically, were A. V. B., for instance, to give to\nstrangers the evidence which she has purported to give to us,\nthe most careful records made by strangers would not treat\n\f196 Jountal of Society for Psychical Research. April-May, 1920.\nadequately innumerable apparently trifling incidents, turns of\nphrase, pronunciation of words, etc., which, heard and recorded\nby any one familiar with the supposed communicator, add to,\nor detract from, as the case may be, the value of the evidence\nreceived. Were she, on the other hand, to babble to the empty\nair, we should be inclined to regard it much as we should have\nregarded a hke proceeding during her life-time\u2014as a symptom\nof mental derangement or imminent nervous breakdown !\nSeriously, however, much as we appreciate the value of medium-\nship such as that of Mrs. Willett, we think that Mr. Wales must\nadmit that each type may have its advantages, and it is only\nfair, to Mrs. Leonard for instance, to state firstly that, although\na professional medium, she is not by any means backward in\naffording the same advantages to sitters whose means do not\nenable them to pay her as to those who can pay her fee, and,\nsecondly, that so far from Feda voluntarily absenting herself\nuntil she hears the chink of a guinea, or to be up-to-date, the\nrustle of a Bradbury, she, like all the \" Controls \" or secondary\npersonalities whom I have met in person or in Uterature, asks\nno better than to monopolise the largest possible share of her\nmedium's daily hfe, and has only been relegated to her routine\n\" sitting \" appearances by stern rej)ressive efforts on the part of\nMrs. Leonard.\nTwo more brief statements I will add : that the reception by a\nsitter of evidence regarding, or purporting to come from persons\nunknown to him is a frequent occurrence ; and lastly that, while\nadmitting the regrettable presence of much excessive sentimentaUty\nin the communications purporting to take place between friends\nor relations, received through many, especially through weak\nmediums, we deny the existence of anything that could by the\nmost severe judge be termed sentimentality in Mrs. Leonard's\nphenomena as known to us\u2014unless, which we do not think, Mr.\nWales wishes to apply the term \" personal slush \" to all and\nevery personal expression of affection or interest received through\na medium as purporting to come from a communicator who\nwould have felt and expressed such affection and interest during\nlife.\nPersonally, we have never received through Mrs. Leonard's\nmediumship, any expression of sentiment that we would have\nconsidered \" slush \" had we been conversing with incarnate entities.\nM. Radclyffe-Hall.\n\fApril-Mat, 1920. Correspondence. 197\n\u2022\n\" LIFE AFTER DEATH.\"\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014I have to offer a few corrections of Dr. Schiller's\nstatements in his review of our last Proceedings and of my book,\nLife after Death.\nDr. Schiller has entirely mistaken the real significance of the\nLynn broker case, or \" Case of Pictographic Phenomena,\" published\nin the annual Proceedings. The thing that I emphasized was not\nat all that he was mediumistic but that, whether mediumistic or\ntelepathic, his own memories were used for interpreting the\nstimuli that came to him. I emphasized the fact, that it might\nthrow light on the place which the subconscious has in all\nmediumistic work.\nThere was another point noticed, and it was that it clearly\nillustrates how people select their evidence to prove their theories.\nAll that was reported represented it as telepathic ; in my own\nexperiments and those of a friend the record shows very clearly that\nthere were incidents which could at least be interpreted spiritistically\nquite as well as telepathically. As a matter of fact, some of\nthem had the characteristics of spirit messages, rather than of\ntelepathy. It was that fact that led to the cross-reference\nexperiment. I was not able to carry on the cross-references as\nthoroughly as I wished, but there was certainly enough to show\nthat there was no reason to believe that it was telepathic.\nWhat Dr. Schiller says about my criticism of Professor James\nhas some force and I am not disposed to quarrel particularly\nabout it. I only wish to correct an error or two and any mis-\ntaken impression that others might have as a consequence of\nDr. Schiller's statement. Dr. Schiller seems to think I might\nnot have read Professor James's book on Immortality at all.\n{1) I read the book twice. (2) I read portions of it several times\nmore to see if I could make out what Professor James meant\nby some of his terms, and I never was able to find out from\nanything he said, save from the illustrations. (3) I did not\nconstruct my point of view from the mere use of the word\n^\"\ntransmission,\" but from the necessary meaning of the illus-\ntrations which he chose. I may be entirely wrong in my inter-\npretation of his meaning\u2014if he had any, for my difficulty was\nto find out whether he had any other meaning than the one\nthat I gave, and I was criticising the only thing that was\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil-May, 1920.\nintelligible in it. Dr. Schiller's distinction between '\ntransmissive\n'\nand '\ntransitive '\nI do not admit for a moment. They mean the\nsame thing save that one is active and the other passive ; or\none is the name of the facts and the other implies causal agency ;\nbut the phenomena are exactly the same.\nDr. Schiller's comment on my attitude toward idealism and\nrealism mistakes the argument. My argument with the idealist\nwas ad hominem, not ad rem. Before I could apply that method\nto the realist I should have to convince him of the spiritistic\ntheory. The idealist has every reason to believe it, when the\nrealist may move toward materialism. I did not fall back on\nrealism, for I have nothing to do with either idealism or realism.\nNobody has ever made the terms very clear, especially idealism.\nThe difficulty always with Professor James was to determine\ntechnically what he meant by his language on a crucial point.\nAs a popular writer he was clear enough, but the nioment he\ntouched on technical problems you never could be sure that his\nlanguage had the accepted meaning of history. It is quite\nprobable that if I could have found what the meaning of his\nterms was my animadversions would have been very different.\nBut I must insist that the terms mean either what I said, or\nthey mean nothing.\nJames H. Hyslop.\n[Note by the reviewer.] I believe Dr. Hyslop to be wrong on\nall the points to which he takes exception in my review of his\nbook. But I refrain from demonstrating this because their interest\nfor members of the Society is too slight for me to make demands\nu])on the valuable space of the Journal. I will only thank Dr.\nHyslop for stating plainly and in print what I have long believed\nto be the real root of the trouble philosophy-professors have\nwith the thought of William James. He did not employ technical\njargon enough to be easily assimilated by the professional mind. But\nthis is hardly a condemnation of James.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nTHE REGISTERING OF SUB-CONSCIOUS IMPRESSIONS.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u20141. In the Journal \" Man,\" 1904, No. 115, in an article\nby Mr. N. W. Thomas, I came across the following remarks\nbearing out his suggestion that many of the witch-doctor's divina-\n\fApril-May, 1920. Correspondence. 199\ntions are the result of the unconscious transference, from the\nmind of the subject to his, of the answer sought. He was\nengaged in studying some ancient Bushman paintings in a cave,\nwhich had a projecting roof in the form of an isosceles or equi-\nlateral triangle. While doing so his dogs discovered some hidden\nskins, which he recognized as part of a collection of his own.\nHe suspected a postboy, but said nothing. Then, in view of\nthe disappearance of other articles at various times, he sent\nfor a witch doctor to smell out the culprit. Sixty natives were\ncollected including the culprit. Mr. Thomas stood behind to\navoid giving any indications of his thoughts unconsciously. He\nsimply told the man there was a thief and he wished to find\nhim. The witch-doctor went through the customary gesticulation,\nchanting and drawing figures on the ground with his stick. After\na time he began drawing triangles (italics are mine), then boldly\ndeclared that the stolen articles were hidden in a cave and\nfinally indicated the suspect as the thief. As it turned out,\nthe culprit afterwards confessed, and the suspect was found\ninnocent. The interest of the story is that the witch doctor\nappeared to have read N.W.T.'s thought.\n2.

Lastly, when we are trying to recollect a name, the usual\nmethod we employ is to go over the letters of the alphabet in\nthe hoj^e that the appropriate letter will attract the word we\nare groping for, and bring it into the light of the supraliminal.\nNow, between 1, 2, 3 and 5 there are certain similarities of\nprocess. There is the groping action or attitude in all of them.\nBut in 1, 2, and 3 there is groping after the unknown.\nThe associative principle seems to be at work in all four cases ;\nwe may, in fact, say in all five cases, because in 4 the subliminal\noperator is clearly trying to switch on to the \" angel \" association\nand bring that word or idea to light.\nBut the question we require to answer is this : was the witch\ndoctor already subUminally in possession of the '\ncave ' idea and its\nassociation with triangles, and were motor impulses being exerted\nto make him draw a triangle ;\nor, on the other hand, was the\n\u2022drawing of the triangle purely fortuitous, and was the effect of\nit the same as that in Professor Murray's case : namely, to\nrelieve, as it were, the telepathic tension by producing the idea\njust as crystals appear out of a strong solution of a salt under\nappropriate conditions if a fragment of solid matter be dropped\ninto it. The scribbling with the stick looks like a casting about\nas it were, for a rise ;\nyet, the subliminal effort may be going\non at the same time. At any rate, in Professor Murray's case\n\fApril-May, 1920. Reviews. 201\nthe falling of the coal was purely chance. In No. 2 we are\nfaced with a number of difficulties. A great number of successes\nwere obtained by this subject, with cards, unknown to Professor\nRichet, sealed up in envelopes, which he considered to be too\nthick to have given any indications through hyperaesthesia.\nThe process the subject followed is interesting when we consider\nit in relation with the other instances recorded above.\nHere it is harder still to choose between the two motives which\npromoted the subject to draw and reckon on her fingers\u2014because\nthere is no source, in a living mind, from which the indication\nrequired could have been received telepathically. Yet the same\nmethod as in 1, and, we may say, 5, is employed.\nIs the faculty of clairvoyance a real one ? The number of\ncases where the possible influence of living minds is ruled out,\nis extremely small ;\nhardly sufficient to establish clairvoyance\neven as a working hypothesis. Granting clairvoyance, however,\nthe modus operandi is intelligible. The reckoning and drawing\noperations are, as it were, a deUcate test, calculated to give a\nfaint indicative reaction under appropriate conditions.\nI feel that I have only scratched the surface of the interest\nof these cases taken together, and that there is a good deal\nmore to be got out of them than I am competent to discover.\nErnest S. Thomas.\nREVIEWS.\nSpiritual Pluralism and Recent Philosophy. By C. A. Richardson,\nM.A. Cambridge University Press, 1919. Pp. xxi, 335.\nMetaphysics is an intellectual game of which some philosophers\nare very fond. It is played with technical words as counters,\nand its chief object is to '\nexplain '\nthem, all except one, in terms\nof that one, by '\nreflecting ' on them, or '\nanalysing ' their '\npre-\nsuppositions.' The one by which one '\nexplains,' must not be\nreflected on or analysed\u2014that is the first rule of the game\u2014but\nas any one may be chosen, the number of possible metaphysics\nis theoretically infinite. Secondary rules are that the results\nshould be extracted by pure thought out of the bare terms with\nno reference to experience, common-sense or science, clothed in\ndecent obscurity, and, at least, pseudo-theological. Hence no\napparatus or observations are required. As for the meanings of\nthe words involved, they are conventional and traditional, un-\nrelated to experience, common-sense and science logically, though\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil-Mat, 1920.\nchronologically an afl&liation to ancient superstitions may frequently\nbe traced in them. As a rule no two metaphysicians use them\nin quite the same sense, and it is quite in order to change from\none sense to others, according to the needs of the argument,\nin the course of the game. This practice also greatly increases\nthe variations of the game ; but it thereby comes rather to\nresemble the royal game of croquet as played by Alice at the\ncourt of Wonderland. It is no wonder, therefore, that meta-\nphysicians should get very much engrossed in their game. They\nplay on, the world forgetting by the world forgot, and are per-\nfectly satisfied that nothing but metaphysics ultimately matters.\nIt is very difficult, therefore, to interest them in any scientific\nor practical problem, and it is a great condescension when they\napply even one of their '\ncategories '\nto one of them.\nIt shows a fine spirit, therefore, in a first-class metaphysician\nfrom Cambridge, to risk his metaphysical prestige by joining\nwhat he, somewhat optimistically, believes to be the '\nrapidly\nincreasing '\ncomjjany of psychical researchers (p. 328). He devotes\nthe long concluding chapter of his book to a detailed consideration\nof the compatibility of the various types of supernormal pheno-\nmena which are the subjects of Psychical Research with his\nmetaphysical principles, and comes to the conclusion, in each\ncase, that they have adequate analogies with things he does\nbelieve, and that there is no reason why they should not be\nbelieved. This is not very positive support, perhaps, but as\nmuch, no doubt, as could be expected. His inquiry is a little\noverweighted with metaphysics, and his metaphysics are not\nwholly free from the foibles mentioned above ; but he bears his\nburden gallantly, and is evidently determined to come to grips\nwith the facts. If he is at all a young man, he would probably\nbe a valuable recruit, and would soon discover that in psychical\nresearch it is necessary to question everything, to take nothing\nfor granted, to jettison metaphysical prejudices, and to entertain\nwith a widely open mind a multitude of the most tentative\nand bizarre suggestions.\nFor instance, he might begin by allowing the facts of multiple\npersonality to call his attention to the somewhat serious vagueness\nof his own metaphysical ultimates. His favourite category is\nthat of subject-object, and he is never weary of insisting that\nthe former is an indivisible unity, \" so absolute as to render\nmeaningless a*ny attempt to split up his feelings and activities\n\"\n(p. 152). He is also psychologically orthodox in dividing the\n\fApkil-May, 1920. Reviews. 203\n'\nself '\ninto the '\nI '\n(subject), and the '\nMe ' (object). Accordingly\nhe holds that the '\ndissociations,' e.g. of the '\nBeauchamp '\nfamily,\nare affections of the '\nMe,' except where there is evidence of\ndouble consciousness, when \" two distinct foci of attention must\nbe involved, and therefore two distinct .subjects \"\n(p. 309), which\nis why he approves of the idea that '\nSally '\nwas a possessing\n'\nspirit '\n(p. 282). But it has not apparently occurred to him\nto put to this '\nanalysis '\nthe very searching question\n\u2014' In virtue\nof what common nature or property are the \" I \" and the \"Me \"\nidentified and united together in the same \" self \" ?\n'\nIt is clear\nthat for common-sense they are somehow one, and Mr. Richardson,\nlike every one else, assumes this too, when he is not on his\nguard ;\n^ yet neither psychology nor metaphysics ordinarily contrive\nto justify this assumption. Psychology distinguishes the '\nI\n'\nand the '\nMe,' but is at a loss to describe their union. Meta-\nphysics attaches enormous importance to the distinction of subject\nand object, but the abstract distinction does not get down to\nthe actual distinctions between, '\nsubjective ' and '\nobjective\n'\nthat are made, and will not serve to discriminate between waking\nand dreaming, f)erception of reality and hallucination. In parti-\ncular, it plays Mr. Richardson false. He is (very sensibly) trying\nto be a '\npluralist,' i.e. to believe that he is not alone in the\nworld. But he fails to observe that his '\nsubject of experience\n'\ncategory does not help him in the least to justify his pluralism.\nFor seeing that ex hypotliesi nothing is known about a subject\nwhich can never be an object of knowledge, he has no right to\nthink that '\nSubjects '\nexist in the fluml. Indeed the '\nprinciples\n'\nof simplicity and economy rather seem to require that no more\nthan one Subject should be postulated, and that the various\nempirical personalities should all be conceived as dissociations\nof a single Absolute Self. Which, of course, would knock out\npluralism, and lead to an extreme, though not very edifying,\nform of monism.^ To justify a beUef in a plurality of '\nsubjects,'\nthe admitted plurality of empirical '\nMes '\nmust somehow be\nmade relevant to the apparently unapproachable '\n\/.' Or, in\nother words, the common-sense belief in the unity of the self,\nin spite of these psychological and metaphysical distinctions,\nmust be vindicated.\n1 E.g. on p. 198, where what he saj's does not seem to apply either to the '\nI ' or\nto the '\nMe,' but to the total '\nself.'\n*As I have argued in Studies in Humanism, eh. xi.\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April-May, 1920.\nNow it is in overcoming these inadequate distinctions and\nexpanding the unduly narrow conceptions psychology and meta-\nphysics have formed of the Self, that Mr Richardson should\nfind the study of the abnormal '\ndissociations '\nuseful, For though\nsuperficially they exhibit normal personality dissolving into chaos,\nthey really attest a deeper, subliminal unity of the Self. For\nit seems that the dissevered personalities can be reunited, and\neven when they perish, they can pass their contents, or what\nwas valuable in them, on to their heirs. They contain therefore\nthe presage of a ^^sychology that is no longer classificatory but\nactive and therapeutic, which will mould the psychic material\ninto forms far more beautiful and regular than nature now attains.\nIt is true that technically all these '\ndissociations '\nwoidd have\nto be assigned to the '\nMe,' but the very fact that outstanding\npersonalities like '\nSally Beauchamp '\nor '\nSleeping Margaret\n'\nin the '\nDoris Fischer '\nCase require a distinct '\nsubject '\nfor their\naccommodation, on Mr Richardson's own showing, only strengthens\nthe demand for a better conception of the Self that will represent\nthe '\nI '\nand the '\nMe '\nas really belonging together. For '\nSally\n'\nwas far too intimately mixed up with the rest of the '\nBeauchamp '\nfamily to be seriously regarded as a separate entity. The proposal\nso to regard her is only the desperate device of an artificial\ntheory. So is the dogma of the indivisible unity of the Soul,\nwhich dates from a time when little was known about it, and\nmuch of it, especially the unconscious depths, had to be left a\nperfect and absolute blank, and so could be labelled '\nsubject,'\nand regarded as disposed of by this metaphysical '\ncategory.'\nNow the indications are that the Soul has actually a highly complex\nstructure, probably quite as complicated as the body. What\nunity it has is plainly functional and acquired, with difficulty\nand imperfectly, or else resides so deep below the surface that\nwe can still only guess about its nature. Moreover, what is\ntrue of the Self holds even more signally of the other topics of\nPsychical Research. They all summon us to reconsider our\nestablished beliefs ; all are too essentially experimental to form\na suitable playground for the a priori notions, out and dried\ncategories, and hard and fast distinctions of metaphysics.\nF.

E. Wright.\nAt the present moment it may perhaps serve a useful purpose\nto place on record some of the impressions which the past\nwork of this Society has made on one whose introduction\nthereto is but of recent date. Also to submit some suggestions\nas to possible future activities in psychical research. The\nimpression which the structure of evidence as embodied in our\nProceedings makes on one who, so to say, meets it for the\nfirst time in the aggregate, is necessarily different to that\nproduced on older members who have seen each component of\nthat structure during its erection.\nIn regard to suggestions for future research, I am well aware\nthat they are framed on a very imperfect knowledge of the\ndifficulties, and limitations, of psychical research ; but they will\nat least afford an opportunity for others, better informed, to\nre-state these difficulties and limitations, a re-statement which\nat the present time would seem to be needed.\nI will therefore endeavour briefly to set forth a few re-\n\fJune, j920. Some Impressions of a New Associate. 209\nflections on some items of the past and present work of this\nSociety, and a few suggestions as to future activities.\nIn regard to past work the outstanding achievement is, of\ncourse, the establishment of telepathy as a proved fact of\nhuman experience. Although the powers and limits of the\ntelepathic faculty are far from being precisely defined, yet the\nexistence of \" communication between human beings by other\nmeans than through the recognized channels of the senses \" is\nnot in doubt. Apart from the numerous comparatively recent\ninvestigations\u2014notably the instructive series of experiments\nbetween Miss Miles and Miss Ramsden\u2014the researches, and the\nreasoning, contained in that great classic Phantasms of the\nLiving, are conclusive to anyone who investigates the subject\nin an impartial spirit.\nIn regard to present requirements in telepathic research,\nadditional evidence is hardly a capital need as far as the mere\nproof of the phenomenon is concerned.\nThe collection of well authenticated cases of spontaneous\ntelepathy, and the carrying out of investigations in the experi-\nmental department thereof, are, however, of undoubted value\nas contributing to a more precise knowledge of the modus\noperandi of telepathic transmissions. A considerable number of\ncases of the former class have been published in the Journal\nfrom time to time. I would suggest that the time is now ripe\nfor the preparation of a synopsis of these cases, and its publica-\ntion in the Proceedings.\nLeaving, then, the subject of telepathy in which the results\nalready achieved, and the methods to be adopted in any\nfurther research, are not doubtful, let us consider some other\nphenomena which fall within the sphere of the activities of\nthis Society.\nFor present purposes these may roughly be grouped in two\ndivisions, though there is some little overlapping between the\ntwo groups.\nFirstly, we have the phenomena which hypothecate extra-\nterrene influence\u2014the great subject of communication with the\ndisembodied, to which most of the energies of our investigators\nhave been devoted. In this department the issue is clear. If\nthere is sufficient evidence\u2014and many would say that our\nrecords, especially those of the cross-correspondences, provide\n\f210 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Junk, i920.\nthat evidence\u2014that communications are received by the hand\nor voice of sensitives which cannot be accounted for by nor-\nmally acquired information, by telepathy inter vivos, or by\nchance coincidence, we are, in our present state of knowledge,\ndriven to the conclusion that these communications must have\nan extra-terrene origin.\nThe second, group of phenomena are those which, even if\ntheir occurrence is a definitely proved fact, do not necessarily\nrequire any extra-terrene hypothesis to explain them. They are\nindeed popularly explained as being due to the operation of\nextra-terrene intelligences, but this explanation is quite\ngratuitous.\nIt is difficult to find a satisfactory generic term to cover all\nthese phenomena. They include a number of alleged mani-\nfestations popularly described as materializations, spirit-photo-\ngraphy, apports, levitations, the ])hysica,l phenomena of\nspiritualism and so forth. All these terms are obviously\nobjectionable and question-begging. Perhaps they might be\ntermed parapsychic phenomena. This term does not commit us\nto any exclusively psychical hypothesis, but allows us to admit\nthat they may be psycho-^yhysical or even only hyper-'phy&ic&l.\n!^mile Boirac\u2014who is one of those who incline to the\nopinion that many of these phenomena may be ascribed to the\noperation of some pseudo-radiant energy capable of being\nemitted by certain persons\u2014sensitives or somnambules\u2014under\nspecial conditions\u2014trance or hypnosis\u2014has introduced the term\nbiactinism to define the collection of phenomena in \\'V'hich there\nis, apparently, manifested action capable of being exercised on\nanimate beings, or on inanimate substances, other than by the\nnormal means of the senses and the muscles.\nIt would seem that F. W. H. Myers did not reject this\nhypothesis, for we find him writing in Human Personality :\n\"I do not know how my will moves my arm, but I know\nby experience that my will generally moves only my arm and\nwhat my arm can touch. . . . Yet I can sometimes move\nobjects not in actual contact, as by melting them with the\nheat or (in the dry air of Colorado) kindling them with the\nelectricity, which my fingers emit. I see no very definite limit\nto this power. I do not know all the forms of energy which\nmy fingers might, under suitable training, emit.\"\n\fJune, 1920. Some Impressions of a New Associate. 211\nI do not think that there has been, at least during the last\nfifteen years, any systematic and coordinated attempt to\ninvestigate these phenomena as far as this Society is concerned.\nOne species of them has, indeed, received some attention at\nthe hands of our investigators. In regard to the so-called\n\" physical \" phenomena\n\u2014\npsycho-dynamics, if the term may be\npermitted\u2014we have the admirable investigations carried out at\nNaples in 1908 on the manifestations produced by Eusapia\nPalladino which are recorded in Vol. XXIII. of the Pro-\nceedings. We have also the record of Miss Johnson's investi-\ngations of the phenomena manifested by Mrs. Williams (see\nProc, Vol. XXI.). These, however, are all that the last ten\nvolumes of the Proceedings has to teach us on the subject.\nThe most cogent evidence for the reality of these phenomena\nis found in a series of researches, with which this Society has\nhad no official connection, namely, Dr. Crawford's Belfast\nexperiments.\nI venture to think that it is unfortunate that these experi-\nments, which appear to be of profound significance, should\nhave been carried out in entire independence of this Society.\nIn any other department of research we can hardly conceive\nthat an investigator who had produced results obviously of\nnovelty and value, would not bring his work before that\ninstitution or society which was charged with the furtherance\nof research in that particular subject. Coordination in psychical,\nas in physical research is a prime need of the present day.\nAmongst the impressions of a new Associate, one of the most\nprominent is that there is a real and pressing need for the\nsystematic experimental investigation of the^e para-psychic\nphenomena. An investigation which shall adopt the methods of\nthe laboratory, which shall be concerned with the production,\nor attempted production, of the alleged phenomena, and not\nmerely confined to the criticism and analysis of evidence\nelsewhere obtained.\nIt is, clearly, of no practical value to state an abstract\nproposition of this sort. It must be translated into concrete\nsuggestions which shall both be within the available resources\nof the Society in experimental material, and shall also not\nconflict with, or compromise, other lines of investigation which\nmay be in progress.\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1920.\nIt is also necessary to suggest the sequence in whicli the\nvery varied phenomena comprised in this class should be\ninvestigated.\nObviously we should select for our first research the pheno-\nmenon which has, on the one hand, the best attestation for\nits occurrence, and which, on the other hand, is the simplest\nand most amenable to strictly experimental treatment.\nThe combination of these desiderata is certainly maxi-\nmum in the case of the so-called \" spirit photography.\"\nMay I, in order to eliminate a prefix which is so objectionable\n.to us, call it \" psycho-photography \" ? We may define it as\nthe impression on photographic plates, either of something not\napperceptible by the normal human senses, or of some normally\nperceptible thing, in a manner not normally possible. The\ndefinition is clumsy but will suffice for present purposes.\nThose who are charged with the direction of the research\nwork of this Society have much on their hands. It is not\ntherefore to be expected that they should contemplate opening\nup a new line of research unless there is a prima facie case\nthat it is likely to lead to profitable results. Our decision as\nto whether any phenomenon is or is not worth investigating\nmust be determined by the respectability of the general testi-\nmony for its occurrence. The testimony to the broad fact that\nphotographic plates, placed in proximity to a sensitive or\nsomnambule, receive impressions which they could not have\nreceived by normal means, is at least respectable. Definite\npronouncements to this effect have been made by Ochorowitz,\nDarget, De Rochas, Durville, Baraduc, Morselli, Hyslop, Car-\nington and other competent authorities. There is, therefore,\nclearly a prima facie case for investigation.\nIn regard to simplicity and ease of observation psycho-\nphotography compares very favourably with other subjects of\npsychic research.\nWe are not here dependent on personal observation for the\nregistration of the phenomenon. The photographic plate gives\nthe decision. The possibilities of mal-observation or hallucina-\ntion are therefore definitely eliminated, an elimination which is\nof the utmost scientific value. The application of conclusive\ntest conditions is also easy. All that is needed is a thorough\nexamination of the camera, slides, and plates, and continuous\n\fJune, 1920.

It should be\neasy to ensure conditions which would render substitution of\nplates, double exposure, or deception of any kind, impossible.\nThe third point is the question of available experimental\nmaterial, and the possibility of interference with other lines of\nresearch. I take these two questions together as they are, to\nsome extent, interdependent. If these para-psychic phenomena\nwere only to be produced through the agency of trance sensi-\ntives it might, on this account, be said that their investigation\nwas undesirable. Our available material in the case of trance\nsensitives is very limited. Those of them who have been\nenlisted in the service of psychic research have, so to say, had\ntheir subhminals specially trained for the reception of extra-\nterrene communications. The subliminal of a trance sensitive\nis a very delicately balanced mechanism. It might destroy its\nvalue for the more important investigation\u2014that of extra-\nterrene communication\u2014were suggestion applied to it with the\nendeavour to lead to the production of para-psychic phenomena.\nWe have an object lesson, in the case of Mrs. Piper's trance\nmediumship, of the ease with which the powers of a trance\nsensitive can be destroyed.\nFortunately, in these investigations in biactinism we do not\nneed to employ trance sensitives. Somnambules are also\navailable as subjects, and of these there should be a sufficiency.\nIt may, however, be said that the fact that psycho-photo-\ngraphy and other para-psychic phenomena were proved to be\nproducible, without extra-terrene influence, by hypnotic subjects,\nwould not prove that they were so produced when manifested\nby sensitives. 1 think, however, that there is general agree-\nment that the state of the subject under hypnosis, and of the\nsensitive in trance, is psychically and physically the same.\nTheir common quality is disintegration of personality, the\nachievement of a state in which the supraliminal is partially\ninhibited, and the subliminal is partially freed, to function\nindependently of the censorship of the former. Whether this\nstate of disintegration is externally induced as in hypnosis\n{Hetero-suggestion), or internally induced as in trance {Auto-\nsuggestion), would seem to make no difference to the resultant\nstate.\nIt is suggested that the first experiments in psycho-photo-\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1920.\ngraphy should follow the lines of those carried out by Dr.\nOchorowicz, Darget, Carrington and others, in which no camera\nis employed. The plate is wrapped in opaque paper and held\nin the hands or placed against the body of the subject. The\nexperimenter then suggests to the latter a word, subject or\ndiagram to be impressed on the plate. Alternatively the\nsubject is instructed to concentrate his attention on some\nactual object before him, and to transfer his visualization of\nit to the plate. This phenomenon\u2014sometimes called \" thought\nphotography \"\u2014which is specially well attested, can readily be\nsubjected to definite experimental proof.\nThe same method could be applied to test the claims of\nthose spiritualists who allege that their \" spirit guides \" can\nimpress a message or picture on a given plate in an unopened\npacket. Prof. Henslow, for example, has given in his recent\nbook. Proofs of the Tmths of Spiritualism, a case where an\nunopened packet of plates, securely sealed and marked for\nidentification, was sent by him to a certain spiritualist seance\nand received back unopened with a psychograph impressed\non the third plate from the top of the packet. As Professor\nHenslow gives the testimony of two independent persons,\nthat the packet had never been opened, the case can hardly\nbe summarily dismissed as one of fraud.\n, No one would suggest that this Society should generally\nembark on the investigation of spiritualist phenomena. It\nis useless to investigate any claims to supernormal powers\nwhere the claimants demand their own conditions before these\npowers can be exhibited. Where, however, as in this case,\neffective test conditions can be imposed by the investigators,\nthe subject would seem to be a proper and necessary one\nfor our investigation.\nWe will next consider experiments in which a camera is em-\nployed. The use of the camera to record psycho-dynamic\nmanifestations, and so-called materializations, is of course\nfamiliar. Dr. Crawford has, apparently, obtained photographs\nshowing that, in the case of the levitations observed by him,\nthere is some sort of semi-material structure which raises,\nand maintains in position, the object levitated. Photography\nwas also extensively used by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing in\nhis researches on the materialization phenomena exhibited by\n\fJune, 1920. Some Impressions of a Neio Associate. 215\n\" Eva C.\" which were discussed by Mrs. Salter in Vol. XXVII.\nof the Proceedings. His elaborate monograph, Materializations-\nPMnomene, of which an English translation is now in progress,\ngives a very profuse photographic record of these manifestations.\nThe Kesearch Committee are to be congratulated on having\nbeen able to arrange a series of sittings in this country with\nthis remarkable sensitive.\nIt is obvious that any investigator will apply the test of\nthe camera in such cases, wherever possible. My present\nobject is to suggest the use of the camera in a different\nline of research. It is probably common knowledge that\nmost of the authorities above quoted who accept \" thought\nphotography\" as a fact, also tentatively accept the reality of\nthe \" externalization of neuricity,\" in the case of sensitives\nand somnambules where disintegration of personality has been,\ncarried to some length. This opinion is supported by so\nreputable a psychologist as Emile Boirac.\nThese investigators state that, under certain conditions, a\nsubject can be caused to externalize something which can\nbe recorded photographically. If it could be definitely proved\nthat a sensitive can under certain conditions be caused to\nexteriorize a \" double \" the implications of this proof would\nbe of profound importance. It would give us a naturalistic\nexplanation for many materialization phenomena, which are\nso bafHing with regard to their investigation, and so repellent\nto most of us owing to the dubious environments in which\nthey are often produced.\nThere is, therefore, a real need for the systematic photo-\ngraphic study of somnambules, in various degrees of hypnosis\nand under various suggestions. This study could probably be\ncarried out with little difficulty.\nI am aware that this hypothesis of externalization is mixed\nup Avith much undesirable and unscientific speculation on\nOccult and Theosophical lines. This admixture should, however,\nhardly deter us from experiment; in view, both of the respect-\nable testimony for the occurrence of the phenomenon, and also\nthe profoundly important conclusions which would result from\nits verification.\nThere is one other new line of research to which laboratory\nmethods can be applied, and which, I think, demands attention.\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Junk, 1920.\nIt is not para-psychic, since the most reasonable explanation\nfor the alleged facts is the action of non-human intelligences.\nThis subject is the alleged \" instrumental \" communication with\nthose intelligences, communication where mechanism takes the\nplace of the human organism of the sensitive. It is stated by\ntwo Dutch physicists, Drs. Matla and Zaalberg van Zelst, that,\nas the result of prolonged experiment, they have received\nmessages from extra-terrene sources by means of apparatus.\nThis apparatus may roughly be described as foUows :\nIt consists of an electrical contact capable of being actuated\nby minute pressures ;. a type wheel rotating at a very slow\nspeed, the usual paper tape passing under the wheel, and a\nplaten actuated by the contact key, through a relay, which\npresses the paper against the type when the circuit is closed.\nIt is claimed that intelligible messages have been received\nthrough this apparatus, the key being pressed by some external\nforce when the desired letters were in the position for printing.\nThe experimenters' description of their researches has not yet,\nI believe, been translated into English. An interesting sum-\nmary thereof is given in Dr. Carrington's recent book Modern\nPsychical Phenomena.\nHere is another opening for laboratory research which,\nalthough it requires somewhat elaborate apparatus, should not\nbe beyond the experimental resources of this Society.\nIt may seem an impertinence to offer suggestions on experi-\nmental technique to a research committee which has the advioe\nof some of the most distinguished physicists of our time. I do\nhowever venture to think that there is one matter\u2014in con-\nnection both with experiments in para-psychic phenomena and\nalso with sittings with sensitives\u2014which needs attention. This\nmatter is the systematic record of the atmospheric conditions\nduring any experiment or sitting. The barometric pressure, the\ntemperature, and, above all, the hygrometric state of the\natmosphere, in the seance room, or extemporised laboratory,\nshould be recorded as a matter of routine. It is often said\nthat atmospheric conditions affect psychic manifestations. This\nsimple routine would soon verify or disprove this supposition.\nI would also suggest that, where possible, experiments should\nbe made as to the effect of special artificial environments. The\neffect of varying qualities of light should be tried, to see if\n\fJune, 1920. Some Impressions of a Neiv Associate. 217\nthere is any truth in the statement that light rich in red rays\nis favourable, and light rich in violet rays unfavourable, to the\nproduction of psychic phenomena.\nOther matters to be tested are the effects of artificial desic-\ncation, of ozonization, and of a condition of electric stress. In\nmany psychical investigations apparatus and mechanism cannot\nhelp us. The more reason why we should use them in every\ncase where they may be, even remotely, of assistance. The\nhistory of experimental research in Natural Science has, surely,\nmade abundantly clear the need for recording every condition\naccessory to an experiment, even though at the time it may\nseem to have no direct bearing on the result.\nIn regard to the investigation of sensitives purporting to\nproduce physical or materialization phenomena, and with special\nreference to the forthcoming experiments with \" Eva C,\"\nI would suggest the desirability of carrying out tests analogous\nto the \" control \" experiments of the biologists.\nIn past discussions on the records of experiments with such\nsensitives much time has been sj^ent in inconclusive arguments\nas to whether the conditions of lighting, and of hand or foot\nholding, or the positions of furniture, curtains, and the like\nwere such that the sensitive could possibly have produced the\nphenomena exhibited by normal means.\nWhere, as in the case of the Naples experiments with\nEusapia Palladino, or those conducted by Dr. Von Schrenk-\nNotzing with \" Eva C.\"\u2014and as no doubt will be the case in\nthose now to be conducted with the latter sensitive\u2014an\naccurate and detailed record is made of all these conditions, it\nshould be possible to reach relative certainty on this point by\nrepeating the experiments with a non-sensitive of the same sex\nand approximately the same age and physique as the sensitive.\nA professional illusionist would be a very suitable subject.\nThis understudy\u2014or pseudo-sensitive\u2014would be subjected to\nprecisely the same examination, tests, and restraints as those\napplied to the real sensitive, and placed in the same room as\nthat in which the seances had taken place, with the same\nfurniture, the same conditions of lighting, and the same relative\npositions of sensitive, furniture, curtains, etc. The understudy\nwould be informed as to the phenomena to be produced, and\ninstructed to effect them if she could.\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1920.\nIf it was found that although doing her best, so to say, to\ncheat she could not produce some of the phenomena exhibited\nby the real sensitive, our belief in the extra-normal origin of\nthose phenomena would be greatly strengthened.\nIn the absence of experiments of this kind, it is always\npossible and easy for the sceptic to allege fraud m general,\nwithout troubling himself to explain how any -particular pheno-\nmenon could be fraudulently produced.\nThe one and only safe rule in regard to evidence in this depart-\nment of psychic research is to accept no phenomenon as, even\npotentially, extra-normal unless it is clear that the sensitive\ncould not possibly have produced it by trickery however much he\nor she tried to do so.\nThis proposal must not be taken to imply any suspicion of\nthe bona fides of such sensitives. But in strict experimental\nresearch bona fides can have no appreciable weight from the\nevidential point of view.\nSo far for the suggestions which a new Associate ventures to\nput forward. The impressions of that Associate are, however,\nby no means confined to the feeling that certain extensions of\nthe experimental work of this Society require attention.\nFar more cogent is the sense of appreciation, of respect, for\nthe work already done. The older members of this Society\n\u2014\nspecially those who have taken an active part in that work\n\u2014\ncannot probably appreciate the effect which the \" cmmdative\nmassiveness \" of the evidence for communication with the dis-\nembodied makes on one who meets it for the first time in the\naggregate.\nIn regard to \" direct \" communications one is impressed by.\nthe wisdom of the decision which was taken to study ex-\nhaustively one sensitive\u2014Mrs. Piper. The value of continuous\nobservation, such as was devoted to the trance phenomena of\nMrs. Piper, is, from the evidential point of view, considerable.\nOnly by prolonged and continuous observation, and by the\naccurate record of all that is said at sittings, can the boun-\ndaries of a sensitive's normal knowledge be defined. For this\nreason the Piper records are of the utmost value, since we\nhave not to guess whether any piece of apparently super-\nnormal information may or may not have been normally\nacquired. The records of past sittings, and the knowledge\n\fJune, 1920. Some Impressions of a Netu Associate. 219\nwhich time brought to the experimenters as to Mrs. Piper's\nnormal sources of information, leave but small opening for\nvmcertainty on this point. There is therefore no need for hesi-\ntation in drawing the conclusion that there is a substantial\nresiduum of information in Mrs. Piper's trance communications\nwhich could not have reached her by normal channels.\nThe telepathic hypothesis is, however, always at hand to\nhinder our positive acceptance of the extra-terrene origin of\nsuch communications.\nIf I may be pardoned a personal note, I would say the\nrecords of direct communications, impressive though they are,\nwould not, for this reason, have sufhced to induce me to\naccept extra-terrene communication as a proved fact. But the\nevidence afforded by the cross-correspondences\u2014and also by the\nconsecutive correspondences, if I may so describe such scripts as\nthat constituting the \" Ear of Dionysius \" case\u2014has made it\nvery difficult, if not impossible, for me to resist the conclusion\nthat some of the communications received by the hand and\nvoice of sensitives have been originated by other than human\nembodied intelligences.\nIt is agreed that by no means can the telepathic hypothesis\nbe strained to explain the complex multiple cross-correspon-\ndences. Their evidential value must, then, stand or fall on the\ncorrectness of the interpretations which our investigators have\ngiven to the scripts of which they are conij^osed. If we found\nthat any critics had produced equally plausible interpretations\nwhich changed sense into nonsense, concordance into confusion,\nour confidence in the cross-correspondences as revealing the\noperation of extra-terrene intelligence would be rudely shaken.\nWe do not, however, find this. During the sufficiently long\nperiod that these records have been before the public we do\nnot find that the still not inconsiderable number of men of\nscience who reject any super-normal explanation, have ever\nendeavoured to demolish the evidence in the only way in\nwhich it can be demolished, namely, by showing that the\ninterpretations of the scripts given by our investigators are\nwrong or at least doubtful. Our confidence in the evidential\nvalue of the cross-correspondences is not a little strengthened\nby the fact that our opponents have, almost entirely, failed to\napply to them any reasoned criticism.\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Junk, 1920.\nFinally, there is one last impression whicli may be mentioned.\nIt was argued some time ago that there is much decadence in\nthe literary quality of scientific publications ; that our scientists\nof to-day compare unfavourably in this particular with those\nof the last generation. The accusation is not unimportant.\nEase of style and clarity of expression are needed by the\nscientific publicist as well as by the man of letters.\nIn this matter our Society is indeed fortunate. The literary\nquality of the papers which compose our Proceedings is, I\nventure to think, exceptionally high. For example, to make\nclear and interesting the analyses of cross-correspondences is a\ndifficult task, but it has been successfully accomplished, notably\nin Vol. XXII., and in the various papers by our past and\npresent research officers. The late Mrs. Verrall's analysis of her\nown script, which fills Vol. XX., is also an outstanding example\nof an obscure subject made clear by careful treatment. In\nregard to other matters it can be confidently said that the\nimpression which the scripts constituting The Ear of Dionysius\nhave made\u2014not only on ourselves, but on many outside this\nSociety\u2014is largely due to the lucid manner in which the scripts\nwere explained and annotated by the author of that paper.\nWhile for clearness of exposition and convenience of arrangement\nthat monument of industry. Vol. XXVIII. , is noteworthy.\nMay we not ascribe this quality, rare in scientific publica-\ntions, to the influence of one who was in his time perhaps one\nof the great masters of English prose ; one who hesitated not to\ndevote his exceptional gifts to a then discredited study. A study\nthe transcendent possibilities of which he foresaw when he wrote :\n\" It may be that for some generations to come the truest\nfaith will lie in the patient attempt to unravel from confused\nphenomena some trace of the supernal world\u2014to find thus at\nlast '\nthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things\nnot seen.'\n\"\nA discussion then followed, of which an abstract is given below.\nKbport op the Discussion.^\nDr. Schiller said he was sure everyone would agree with\nhim that the Society were very fortunate to have| secured\n^ This report gives only the substance of what was said ; it is not verbatim.\n\fJune, 1920. Some Impressions of a Netv Associate. 221\na rising recruit who was capable of bringing before them liis\nviews with so much practical energy and in so scientific a\nspirit, and, perhaps he might add, with such robust optimism.\nMr. Wright had pointed out that it was extraordinary\nthat the Society had not undertaken any research into the\nphenomena of Miss Golligher, but it was not the fault of the\nSociety that this research was not undertaken. In the year\n1918 Sir OUver Lodge and he himself were ready and anxious\nto go over to Belfast, but on several occasions they were\nput off, and in the end it was not possible for them to get\nsittings.\nHe entirely agreed with Mr. Wright as to the need for\nlaboratory methods ; he was quite sure that it was a very\nimportant matter which the Society ought to bear in mind.\nIt ought to have a laboratory, although laboratories were not\na safe passport to success. He said this largely in \\'iew of\nsome American reports in American Universities where these\nlaboratory methods had been tried. The results were negative,\nand the fact of course was in a sense hostile to the work of\nthe Society. He thought that though close attention was\ngiven to the actual experiments, the experiments were in-\nsufficient, they were not persevered in, and ought to be\nsupplemented by further experiments.\nThere was another point, and that was in regard to\n\" spirit \" photography. The great difficulty was to make sure\nthat one had got a normal plate and he thought possibly Mr.\nWright rather underrated the difficulties ; for to keep a\nplate under continuous observance was not by any means an\neasy thing to do. Mr. Wright would be interested in an\nelaborate report made by a lady in Washington, whose bo7ia\nfides was above suspicion, which was pubhshed recently in the\nlast Part of the Proceedings of the American Society for\nPsychical Research. The repoi-t and examination of this\ncollection were by Dr. Walter Prince, the author of the account\nof the \" Doris Fischer \" case. Dr. Prince, he thought, proved\npretty conclusively that this collection of spirit photographs\nwas not genuine, and that there was nothing produced that\ncould not have been brought about by fraud.\nThe last point he would say anything about was the matter\nof telepathy. He thought that there Mr. Wright was opti-\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1920.\nmistic ; the Society would like a great deal more evidence,\nand would like to be able to meet the doubts which were\nstill being expressed.\nMb. Piddington said that he agreed with Dr. Crawford.\nThe main object was to get the work of investigation well\ndone. Dr. Crawford published his results so that everyone\ncould read them. He thought there was a certain advantage\nin having an independent investigation, for there were a\ncertain number of people who looked with suspicion on any-\nthing done by the S.P.K., and therefore any independent\nperson who brought out a report was well received by many,\nparticularly if he was known as a scientific man. He sympa-\nthised with Dr. Crawford for this reason.\nMr. Wright said in his paper that co-operation and co-\nordination were highly desirable. He thought Mr. Wright was\nfor a moment forgetting the difference between the investi-\ngation of psychical phenomena and the ordinary investigation\nof physical science. In the laboratory, the personality of\nthe investigator was unimportant ; the same thing still\nhappened if a person was sympathetic or unsympathetic\u2014this\nwould not affect the actual physical phenomena. In psychical\nphenomena the investigator made an enormous difference, and\nhe thought that the difference might be in the fact that the\nmedium did not know an investigator.\nMr. Whately Smith thought Dr. Crawford ought to let\nthe Society make an investigation on scientific grounds. At\npresent the report rested on the authority of one person only ;\nthe medium might lose her powers, or she might die, and\nthen the critical public would say that there was no con-\nfirmation, and the whole of that very valuable work would\nbe wasted.\nWith regard to the evidence for survival, one impression\nmade in his mind was that the whole thing was getting\nconfused. It was very difficult to advise a person as to\nsurvival until they could put something definite, or that\ncould be called conclusive, before him. He thought it\nmight be worth while to strike out on entirely new lines.\nHe had written a letter a few months ago which was printed\nin the Journal in which he made this suggestion, and it\nnaturally called forth a certain amount of criticism. But\n\fJVNE, 1920. Some Impressions of a New Associate. 223\nhe thought the Society might venture to investigate as to\nsurvival by entirely new methods.\nMr. C. N. Bennett said he had been an Associate for\nseven years and the first thing that impressed him very much\nwas that the Society had no laboratory and organised system\nof research.\nHaving got nothing fijst-hand, and having merely paid\nhis subscription, he had decided not to resign, but to join\nanother Society, i.e. The London Spiritualist Alhance. He had\nnot been a member for six weeks\u2014he was not a spiritualist\nby any means\u2014before they asked him to join in their\ndevelopment circle and to take on developing plates which\nthey had been trying to get experiments from. One found\nthat people there got to work, and there was behind it all\nan atmosphere of something being done.\nIt seemed to him that the only thing expected from the\nsubscriber was his subscription and a little second-hand\nevidence. He should prefer that something was being done\nin which members could get first-hand evidence. The Society\nshould pick its members' brains, not merely their pockets.\nDr. Woolley said he knew of no single scientific Societv\nwhich conducted its experiments with an individual alone.\nHow could an individual member carry on investigation of\nany sort ? The only way was for groups of members to\nconduct experiments and then to bring them for discussion\nbefore everyone here. Experiments which were absolutely\nsatisfactory to one's self alone, others would not accept.\nBut they would accept the evidence of an experienced Com-\nmittee, such as this Society appointed, which was exactly\nwhat it was working for.\nMrs. Boustead said that what she felt about this dis-\ncussion was that the experiences of new people would never\nmeet the aims of the Society. What they wanted was the\nopinion of this Society as a body ; the opinions of individuals\nworild not convince other people.\nMrs. Hobhouse said that the Society offered little encourage-\nment in finding mediums, and little could be done without them.\nMrs. Kingsley said that she could not agree with the\nlady who had just spoken that there was little encoiiragement\nshown. About a year ago, quite by accident, she took\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1920.\npart in a series of experiments, and it was discovered tiiat\na young man who was present went into trance. She came\nat once to the Society and she was received with the utmost\ncourtesy. Miss Newton invited her to bring the young man\nto the Society's rooms, but unfortunately he could not be\npersuaded to be investigated.\nThe Hon. Everard Feilding thought that if members\nwere to take the line of the lady who had just spoken they\nwould find that they would have exactly the same experience.\nThe Council was always ready to form a Committee of\nmembers, who had had experience in research and investiga-\ntion, and who had certainly experience of the sources of\nerrors. The difficulty was to get people to subject themselves\nto any long series of experiments by which alone good\nresults could be obtained.\nSo far as the subject of the paper was concerned he had\nhimself much sympathy with the suggestion made by the\nwriter. He had for a long time thought that a laboratory\nwhere a few simple laboratory apphances, weighing and other\ninstruments, could be installed, would be of great use.\nDr. Schiller having then called upon Mr. Wright to make\na reply, if he wished to do so, Mr. Wright said he only\nwanted to correct one impression which had arisen from\nhis paper. He did not mean that there was the sHghtest\nneglect on the part of the Society to investigate Dr. Craw-\nford's medium, but he meant to imply that it was regrettable\nthat as a scientific man Dr. Crawford would not permit the\ninvestigation by this Society.\nAPPENDIX TO PART LXXVIII OF PEOCEEDINGS.\nThe Appendix to Part LXXVIII. of the Proceedings, circulated\nwitli this Journctf completes Vol. XXX., of which bound copies\nwill soon be ready.

An Incident in a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard.\nThe above report of an incident which occurred at a sitting\nwith Mrs. Osborne Leonard has been sent to us by the sitter,\nMrs. Beadon, a member of the Society. We have had other\nreports of her sittings from Mrs. Beadon and know her to be a\ncareful and accurate recorder. The case gains an additional\ninterest from the fact that the apparent communicator, whom\nwe will here call Mrs. Parkinson, is the same lady who was the\napparent telepathic agent in a case printed in the Journal for\nJuly, 1919 (pp. 83 fi.), when a priest received, as he thought, a\ntelephone message summoning him to the bedside of a dying\nwoman desirous of receiving the last Sacrament. In the earlier\ncase the impression was received a few hours before Mrs.\nParkinson's death ; the sitting with Mrs. Leonard, recorded\n\fJuly, 1920. Case: Incident in Sitting tvith Mrs. Leonard. 227\nhere, took place about a fortnight after her death. The case is\nalso of interest as being an instance in which knowledge was\nshown by Mrs. Leonard's trance-control which was apparently\nacquired by supernormal means and was not in the possession\nof the sitter at the time.\nMrs. Beadon first gave an account of her experience in an\ninterview with the Secretary, Miss Newton, and afterwards sent\nus a record of it at Miss Newton's suggestion. The names and\naddresses of all the persons concerned are known to us, but by\nrequest are not printed.\nMrs. Beadon's record, sent to us on April 25, 1920, ran as\nfollows :\nFrom Notes taJcen during a Sifting ivith Mrs. Leonard.\nOn Saturday, November 30th, 1918, I had a sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard.\nIn the middle of the commumcation slie was giving slie broke\noff to say that there was a spirit present who was very anxious\nto get through.

A Case of Clairvoyance ?\nThe following case is one in wliicli a train of thought, closely\nassociated with a particular object, was apparently aroused by\ncontact with the object in a manner not easily explicable by\nnormal caAises. The narrator of the incident, Mr. H. S. Cowper,\nof High House, Hawkshead, Ambleside, originally sent his\nrecord to Sir Oliver Lodge, by whom it was forwarded to us.\nThe record ran as follows :\nSeptember 25, 1919.\nIn July, 1917, at the dis])ersal of tlie well-known Pelham\nClinton-Hope Collection at Christie's, I becaine the owner of a\nremarkable Egyptian statuette of black basalt. The figure is\neigliteen inches high, and is a portrait of an old priest. The\nwork is of considerable artistic value, being in the remarkable\nrealistic style of the XXVIth dynasty (Saitic), 662-525 B.C.\nIn the same sunmier my son Christopher, then over 14 yea,rs\nof age, was at my house in Kent for the holidays. Of course\nI showed him the figure, and I sliould mention that at tliat\ntime the long inscrij^tion at the back had not been read, and\nI was unaware of the contents. I was, however, aware that it\nwas Saitic, and represented a priest or scribe. As far as I can\nremember it was early in the liolidays, and probably in August,\nthat my sou was looking at the figure in my library, and standing\nalongside the table with his hand on its head he said, \" Father,\nwhat is the story about the lost Atlantis ?\nThere was nothing to lead up to this question. I had told\nhim the story of Atlantis vaguely a long while before, and when\nhe asked me I was absolutely at a loss where to look it up and\n\fJVLt, 1920. Case : A Cane of Glairvoyatice t 2S1\ntell it him correctly. I ransacked books for several clays, and\nit was only by references in classical dictionaries, and the travels\nof Ali Bey el-Abassi, that I remembered the connection of the\nstory with Plato and a priest of Sais.\nThough the coincidence seemed remarkable, 1 Jiave never in-\nvestigated further until asked to record the facts. A friend of\nmine has now (Septendjer, 1919) furnished me with a reference,\nfor I do not possess a Plato. He writes me :\n\" In Plato's Timaeus (22 if.), Kritias, one of the interlocutors,\ntells a story which his grandfather (also named Kritias) was\ntold by Solon (his elderly relative). This was that Solon, when\ntravelling in Egypt, had been told by a priest of the Goddess\nNeith in Sais how, in far away prehistoric times, the people who\nthen inhabited Athens had, successfully, repelled a great incm'sion\nmade into the Mediterranean regions by the rulers and people of\nthe Continent of Atlantis, which continent afterwards disappeared in\nthe course of a great natural convulsion in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\"\nAn account of my statuette was published with three plates in\nan article by Miss M. A. Murray in \" Ancient Egypt,\" edited\nby Prof. W. F. Petrie, Part IV., 1917, but which I think did\nnot appear till about Christmas. The date is given as about\n600 B.C., and it represents Nefer Smaa. There is a long hiero-\nglyphic inscription down the back, in which he is described as\n\" The Great One \"-\u2014\" Scribe of the Five '\n\u2014and \" Beloved of Men\nand Neith of Sais.\" As the Five were the council of the temple,\nhe was apparently chief priest and scribe ; and also, I take it,\npriest of Neith.\nSolon was born 638, died 558 B.C.\nlb seems therefore quite likely that Solon was in Sais when this\npriest was living there, and consequently he may have been, and\nnot improbably was, the narrator of the Atlantis story to Solon.\nThe problem is : Why should my son ask this question with\nhis hand on Nefer Smaa's head.\nI am aware of three other portraits of tlie same period and\nstyle. I do not tliink others are known, but possibly may be,\nas I am not abreast of modern Egyptology. There was a portrait\nhead at Berlin, there is a scribe's head at the Louvre, and another\nbelonged to Prince Ibrahim at Cairo. All are heads of old men\nrealistically treated in the remarkable Saitic style. I rather think\nthey are not inscribed, but all are probably officials.\nH. S. COWPER.\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1920.\nThe incident took place at Great Loddenden, Staplehiirst, Kent,\nwhich I have since sold.\nWe subsequently wrote to Mr. Cowper asking if lie could\nremember whether, when he first told his son the story of\nthe lost Atlantis, he had said anything to him of its con-\nnexion with a priest of Sais. He replied as follows :\nJanuary 7, 1920.\nWith reference to your enquiries enclosed,\n(1) I think it is quite impossible that when I told my son\nChristopher, then a mere child, about the Atlantis story. I could\nhave mentioned anything about a priest of Sais. I do not think\nI knew at that date that a priest of Sais had anything to do\nwith the story. It was only a story of a lost or submerged\ncontinent, which T thought would interest a child.\n(2) On the other hand, when I showed him the statuette \/ am\nsure I told him it was of the Saitic period, because I recognised\nit as of this remarkable art period when I bought it.\nIt was only when he began to talk about Atlantis that I had\nto look the story up, and then found that the priest of Sais\ncame into it.\nOne cannot remember these things, but my impression is that\nmy knowledge of \" Atlantis,\" when I told the child about it,\nwas obtained from a clever modern novel on the subject, both\ntitle and author of which I now forget, and not from study of\nancient authors at all. H. S. Cowpee.\nIt would therefore appear that any knowledge Mr. Cowper's\nson may have had concerning a connexion between a priest\nof Sais and the lost Atlantis did not derive from Mr. Cowper.\nBut it is, of course, impossible to prove that the boy had\nnever had any knowledge at all of such a connexion. He\nwould not at that age have read Plato's Timaeus, but he\nmight have come across the story of Solon and the priest of\nSais told somewhere as an anecdote. But even if we suppose\nthat he had some latent knowledge on this point, we have\nstill to take into account the close connexion between the lost\nAtlantis and Mr. Cowper's statuette revealed by the reading\nof the inscription at the back. At the time of the incident\ndescribed by Mr. Cowper, neither he, nor bis son, nor, so far\nas can be ascertained, any other living person knew anything\n\fJuly, 1920. Case : A Case of Clairvoyance ? 233\nof the inscription, which was not read until some months\nlater. Prima facie, the incident suggests that Mr. Christopher\nCowper's train of thought was aroused hy his contact with\nthe statuette rather than by any other person's thoughts or\nknowledge concerning the statuette.\nThat the human mind is able to derive information from\nphysical objects directly without the intervention of any other\nmind is a theory often propounded ; but the evidence for\nthis theory is at present comparatively scanty. Perhaps the\nstrongest evidence recently brought to the notice of the Society\nis that afforded by some of the \" book-tests \" obtained at\nsittings with Mrs. Leonard, whose information concerning closed\nbooks appears to have been derived directly from the books\nthemselves in a manner which our present scientific know-\nledge is quite unable to explain. It is worth noting that in\nthe case recorded above the information showing the close\nconnexion between the statuette and the story of the lost\nAtlantis could be derived (supernormally, so far as Mr. Chris-\ntopher Cowper was concerned) from the unread inscription at\nthe back.\nNOTES ON RECENT PERIODICALS.\nThinking Animals Again.\nTo judge by a review of recent German literature in the Archives\nde Psychologie No. 68 (Dec. 1919), p. 342, the controversy on\nthis subject is by no means extinct, and the remarks in the\nJournal No. 359 (Dec. 1919), p. 128-9, require a certain measure\nof correction. It docs not appear to be true that Dr. Neumann's\nexperiments are admitted to have disposed of the claims of\nthe dog Rolf, of Mannheim ; on the contrary Fraulein Moekel\nmaintains that he continues to \" talk \" in sjjite of her mother's\ndeath, and retorts upon Dr. Neumann that he had himself uttered\naloud the name of the friend which he had supposed Rolf could\nhave got only from her. Further it appears that a number of\nRolf's descendants have been educated, and have shown that\nhis genius is hereditary by acliieving more or less the same feats\nLastly a Dr. Wolif has upheld the claims of the Elberfeld horses\nby further experiments with the blind stallion Berto, which are\nsaid completely to exclude every way of transmitting unconscious\nsigns.

July, 1920.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nEvidence of Subvival.\nTo THE Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014Some years ago I had an experience which raised a\nquestion similar to that suggested by Mr. Hubert Wales and\nanswered by Miss R.adclyf!e-Hall, a propos of the incident of\n\" Billy \" the dog. I received through a medium a statement\nthat my Will contained an error. The remark was spontaneous\n;\nI had neither inquired about, nor suspected, an error ; he did\nnot tell me what was the nature of the error. I sent for the\ndocument (which was not in my keeping), and as I could detect\nnothing wrong I forwarded it to a friend (a Judge), who replied\nsaying that the Will, as drawn, contained a \" bad blunder \" which\nhe had known solicitors make on some previous occasion. It was\nof a technical character and not one I could have recognised.\nThe question this suggests is : Was anyone who had died\nlikely to have known of this in his lifetime ? An affirmative\nanswer seems impossible from the nature of the case. Before the\nmedium made this statement, however, he described to me an\nelderly man whom I recognised as my Uncle and Guardian,\nthough I did not say so ; he then said, that he got the word\n\" uncle,\" and asked whether he had helped me to draw up any\ndocument before he died. I re])lied that he had helped me to\ndraw up my Will. It was then that he said very emphatically :\n\" I get incorrect so strongly.\"\nAlthough the bare statement concerning the error does not\npoint to communication from the departed, if isolated from the\ncontext, any more than does the statement of facts concerning\n\" Billy,\" the association of this statement with a clearly recog-\nnised personality should be a factor\u2014and perhaps the determining\nfactor\u2014in forming a judgment as to the source and significance\nof the statement. I am bound to ask : Why should the clair-\nvoyant faculty of the medium see my Uncle before telling me of\nthe error in my Will ? If the discovery of the blunder is to be\nattributed to travelling clairvoyance, and it is supposed that\nby this means, and this jneans alone, he was able to discern a\ntechnical error unrecognised up to that time by any living person,\nwhy did he previously see the \"person who may have been, un-\nintentionally, responsible for that error before he died?\nThe fact tliat he was my Guardian and had taken charge of\n\fJuly, 1920. Revievj. 235\nmy financial affairs for many years makes it entirely suitable\nthat he should try to point out the error if he became aware\nof it after his death ; but I do not see how the undirected clair-\nvoyance of the medium accounts for the incident in a reasonable\nmanner. There is a coherence and purposefulness in the circum-\nstances which seems to me to require the recognition of an\nintelligent mind which is not that of the medium, who knew\nnothing of my affairs. Similarly the Billy \" incident is associated\nwith A. V. B.\" Although these associations do not afford\ndefinite proof of the source of the communication (and are not\nclaimed as so doing), they tip the balance in favour of the\nspiritistic explanation for those who have become convinced, by\nexhaustive study of a mass of evidence, that that interpretation\nis reasonable and well authenticated in many other instances.\nI reported the incident concerning my Will in Light soon after\nit occurred, and I have also published it in my little book\nObjections to Spiritualism Answered (pp. 97, 98). H. A. Dallas.\nREVIEW.\nThe Hill of Vision. Bv F. Bli&h Bond, (Constable, pp xxv\n134. 7s. 6d.)\nThis extremely interesting book is an account of certain auto-\nmatic scripts written by the author's friend Mr. John Alleyne,\nwho also produced those which led to the discovery of the Edgar\nChapel at Glastonbury, as related in Mr. Bond\"s previous work.\nThe Gate of Remembrance. The present scripts, written between\nOctober 15, 1909, and August 21, 1918, contain prophecies of\nwar produced in 1909. 1911 and 1912, and prophecies of the\ndate of the ending of the war produced in the spring of 1918.\nThe latter are of a remarkable character. The script of March\n29 (Good Friday) contains the following statement :\nWatch ! At Easter Day the tide will turn and ebb swiftly and con-\nsistently. The very elements will fight on the side\" of Right,\nand be used in the accomplishment of the intended trap into which\nthey have fallen.\nOn Easter Monday the evening papers came out for the first\ntime with the headlines \"The Tide has turned,\" and in a letter\npublished on April 2 (Tuesday) the correspondent of the Daily\nChronicle wrote, \"The luck of the weather has turned for about\nthe first time that I can call to mind, and gone completely\nagainst the enemy.\" The script of March 27 (Wednesday in\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jolt, 1920.\nHoly Week) had already af&rmed, \" The balance rises and will\nsoon show a full preponderance on the side of intrinsic right.\nThe last great effort passes away.\" As early as March 13 the\nfollowing was written :\n'\"\nWhen the eighth month of the year\nends failure (?) will be more evident in those (?) that ye pursue.\nThe twenty-fourth day will see surcease (?) of battle.\" It was\nadded, however, that \" an outward semblance of war may con-\ntinue sporadically and intermittently long after the opposing\nnations [the enemy] have ceased to desire it.\" It cannot be\ndenied that this prophecy dates with substantial accuracy the\ngreat and unexpected collapse of the German front which defin-\nitely placed victory in the hands of the allies. From August 25\nthe Germans ceased to be capable of taking the offensive.\nThese brief extracts from the somewhat lengthy scripts will\nbe sufiBcient to show that we have here unusually strong evidence\nof precognition. How the information was obtained by the\nautomatist, whether through inhabitants of the spirit world\n(the \" Watchers \" of the script) or more immediately, the reader\nmay speculate at his leisure ; the scripts afford little guidance\nin either direction. Of one thing, however, we can be sure,\nthat the source was not \" Augustus Caesar Imperator,\" (some-\ntimes \" Imperator \" or \" Imper.\") whose name is appended to\na long script in English, dated October 15, 1909, which contains\na quotation from S. Paul and begins with three Latin sentences :\nFortuna fuit. Caelum ruit. Labor fruit in aeternum. The\nremarkable word fruit is apparently intended to mean \" bears\nfruit \" ! Several of Mr. Alleyne's scripts in The Gate of Remem-\nbrance are in monkish Latin, and it looks as though these words\nwere meant for four lines of verse.\nThe book also contains prophecies of certain world-convulsions\nto take place after the war, and much space is occupied by\nphilosophical matter. The latter, the scope of which is mainly\nconfined to the war and its consequences, embodies much that\nis both truth and wisdom ; the inherent self-destructiveness of\nevil is insisted upon, and the predominance of spiritual forces\nin determining the course of the world's history is strongly\nemphasised. In this connexion one would like to know more\nof Mr. Alleyne's personality.\n'\nThe work is one which no student of Psychic Science should\nleave unread. M. A.

He graduated\nat Wooster in 1877, and after studying in the University of Leipzig\nfrom 1882 to 1884, was awarded the Ph.D. of Johns Hopkins\nUniversity in 1887, and the LL.D. of Wooster in 1902. In\n1891 he married Mary Fry Hall of Philadelphia, who died in\n1900, leaving one son. Dr. George M. Hyslop, and two\ndaughters, one of whom lived with and nursed her father\nto the end of his life. = m\nHe gave instruction in Philosophy at Lake Forest University,\nIllinois, and at other Colleges in the States, from 1880\nonwards ;\nbecoming Professor of Logic and Ethics in Columbia\nUniversity, New York, in 1895, and holding the chair tiU\n1902. In 1895 the American Branch of the English S.P.R.,\nwhich had begun in 1884, was discontinued, owing to the\ndeath of its secretary, Dr. Richard Hodgson ; and about that\ntime the American Institute for Scientific Research, which\nhad been incorporated by Prof. Hyslop in 1903, became\nthe American S.P.R., and .\ncarried on its work independently\nof the English Society. The energy and enthusiasm of Prof.\nHyslop enabled an endowment fund of 170,000 dollars to\nbe accumulated ; and in the October number of the Journal\nof the English S.P.R., 1907, the following sentence occurs\n:\n\"It is very satisfactory that the American Society\nshould already have found so much material of interest\nand value, and it is hardly necessary to add that their\ncautious and scientific treatment of it shows that they\nare fully alive to the necessity for keeping up the standard\nof evidence in psychical research.\"\nIt is understood that although Prof. Hyslop had given up\nhis chair in Columbia University in order to devote his time\nto a subject of which he realized the great and growing\nimportance, he declined to draw any salary from the funds\nof the American Society, and for thirteen years gave his\nservices without remuneration, so that all the funds subscribed\nmight be used for the necessary work. Whether or not it\n\fOct., 1920. In Memoriam : James Hervey Hyslop. 239\nwas wise thus to handicap himseK by restricting his social\nopportunities, may be uncertain ; but his action aroused the\nkeenest admiration in America, and increased the respect\nuniversally felt for the devoted and self-sacrificing spirit and\nthe energetic work of Prof. Hyslop.\nUnder his guidance the American Society have issued bulky\nvolumes of Proceedings and Journal, a great part of which\nwas written by Hyslop himself ; and he was also the author\nof the following works :\nElements of Logic, 1892 ; Ethics of Hume, 1893 ;\nDemocracy,\n1899 ;\nLogic and Argument, 1899 ;\nSyllabus of Psychology, 1899 ;\nProblems of Philosophy, 1905 ; Science and a Future Life, 1905 ;\nEnigmas of Psychical Research, 1906 ; Borderland of Psychical\nResearch, 1906 ;\nPsychical Research and the Resurrection, 1908 ;\nPsychic Research and Survival, 1913 ; Life after Death, 1918\n;\nContact with the Other World, 1919.\nIn 1899 the English Society elected Hyslop one of its\nVice-Presidents, a recognition which pleased him, especially as\nhis stand for Psychical Research in America had the effect of\ncutting him off from a good deal of academic association.\nEarly in 1920 Hyslop, whose health was never good, had a\nslight stroke, from which he only partially recovered. It affected\nhis power of speech, and he was troubled with a good deal of\naphasia, especially in the difficulty or impossibility of remembering\nproper names. He was much interested in this feature of his\nillness, and desired notes to be taken of his attempts at names\nof people exceedingly well known to him, in order to compare\nthose attempts with the efforts of mediums to report proper\nnames of communicators on \" the other side.\" His idea pre-\nsumably was that this early symptom of dislocation, or inaccessi-\nbility of a portion of the brain, might correspond with a similar\ninaccessibility by a medium's brain to some telepathic or other\npurely psychic impressions.\nHyslop was converted to belief in survival and the possibility\nof communication, in the first instance, by messages from his\nfather through the mediumship of Mrs. Piper, with whom he\nmade a long series of experiments laboriously reported in the\nEnglish S.P.R., Vol. XVI., but his later investigations were\ncarried on chiefly with the aid of an American medium known\nas Mrs. Chenoweth ; a great mass of this evidence, collected by\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1920.\nhimself and other sitters, being reported in the American Pro-\nceedings.\nThe result of Hyslop's concentration on Psychical work, which he\nhad the advantage of entering as a Psychologist, was to render\nhim contemptuous of the hypothesis that every piece of information\ngathered from an entranced medium could be traced to telepathy\nfrom the conscious or sub-conscious mind of living people. He\nconsidered that the tendency to stretch telepathy, as an explana-\ntion, far beyond the experimental evidence for it, was illegitimate ;\nand he held moreover, as we all do, that telepathy is a name\nfor a process, rather than an explanation of how it occurs. He\nconsidered that people were liable to confuse telepathy as a fact,\nwhich it is, with telepathy as a full explanation, which it is\nnot.\nAt the same time he admits that the mere fact of telepathy, as\na mental process beyond the range of the ordinary senses, was\nin itself an idealistic argument, tending in the direction of\nestablishing a separate existence for mind and body, and strengthen-\ning the probability of survival of one without the other ; and\nthis part of the argument, near the end of his life, he summarised\nthus :\n\" The lesson to be learned from the fact of telepathy,\nthough no explanation of it has been found, is that normal\nsense-perception is not our only source of knowledge.\nMaterialism must stand or fall with the evidence for the\nlimitation of knowledge to sense-perception ; and telepathy,\nif it applies to information acquired at great distances, is\na complete refutation of that theory. If we do not accejrt\nthe large body of evidence for the existence of spirits, we\nare obliged to substitute for that view the theory of telepathy,\nwhich is in itself a guarantee of a transcendental world of\nsome sort, since it implies that the brain is not the sole\ncondition of consciousness.\"\nOf Hyslop's position in the world of Philosophy, the writer\nis not competent to speak, but he ventures to think that it\nwould have been even higher than it is, if Hyslop had had the\ngift of expressing himself in clear and simple English. Throughout\nhis voluminous writings the sentences are frequently involved,\nand sometimes so curiously constructed that it is difl&cult to\ndisentangle their meaning. The writer once took him to task\nfor this defect, assuming that it must be due to haste or careless-\n\fOct., 1920. In Memoriam : James Hervey Hyslop. 241\nness ; but in reply to the question, why he dictated his papers\nand did not take the trouble to correct them, Hyslop indignantly\nrepelled the implied accusation, asserting that he wrote his papers\nhimself and took a great deal of trouble with their composition.\nTheir involved and at times barely readable character thus\nbecomes in itself a psychic phenomenon, to the elucidation of\nwhich the present writer has no clue.\nThe last thing he desires, however, is to end on a note of\ncriticism. Amid a confused welter of credulity on the one\nhand, and self-satisfied ignorance on the other, the work of\norganising a Society for Psychical Eesearch in any country must\nbe a strenuous and sometimes discouraging task. For the self-\nsacrificing and pertinacious labours of Hyslop no one who knew\nhim feels anything but warm admiration. And those who have\nworked for the much-needed rational study of psychic phenomena\nin America, apart from superstition on the one hand and prejudice\non the other, feel that they owe him a debt they can hardly\nhope to repay.\nHe died in New Jersey on the 17th June, 1920.\nCASE.\nA Record of Some Experiments in Automatism.\nThe following case has been sent to us by Miss Hermione\nRamsden, being a record of certain results obtained by a\ngroup of experimenters, members of the Norwegian Society\nfor Psychical Research, who sit frequently together, and of whom\n]\\Iiss Ramsden is one. The particular method employed on\nthis occasion for the recording of the automatic \"'\nmessaD^es\n\"\nwas a board upon which the letters of the alphabet were set\nout and a glass pointer upon which the experimenters placed\ntheir hands. The real names of the person from whom the\nmessages purport to come and of her relatives have been\ngiven to us by Miss Ramsden, but at her request pseudonyms\nare printed here.\nReport by Miss Ramsden.\nOn Wednesday, October 1-5, 1919, the circle consisted of\nDr. Wereide, Dr. Zogbaum, Froken Bredsdorf? (our medium),\nFru Berg, Fru Ramm, Herr Torkildsen and myself.\n\f2+2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1920.\nWe received several long commurLications wliicli were per-\nfectly intelligible, and then the following :\n\" Dora hates Helen.\"\nOn Tuesday, October 21, the circle was the same as before,\nwith the addition of Herr Thomassen. We first received a\nquotation from Tennyson which we believe to be the first of\na series of cross-correspondences, after which there was a\npersonal message to H. R. and then :\n\" Dora hates Helen Amelia de Dinard.\"\nWe said :\n\" Please explain who you are \" ; but there was\nno response to further questions.\nOn Saturday, December 6, we held a special sitting for\nConsul Aall and his sister ; he also brought a friend, Herr\nKielland. None of the former circle were present except\nFrk. Bredsdorff, Fru Berg and myself.\nAfter two messages the following was addressed to me\n:\n\" Alice. Let me try to communicate.\"\nI was very much surprised, as the name suggested a Mrs.\nPercival whom I believed to be alive and well.\n\" I was here the other night with the family.\"\nThis referred to a night when Frk. BredsdorfE slept at\n16 Incognito gade and had a vision of six spirit forms. I then\nasked :\nH. R. But when did you die ?\nNobody died, I am here.\nH. R. But who are you ? What was your husband's name ?\nAdolphus you mean ?\nH. R. Yes, but I did not know you had left this world.\nMay I come again ?\nH. R. Yes, do come.\nThank you.\nThis was followed by a communication to Consul Cato Aall,\nafter which came the following from our mysterious com-\nmunicator :\nGive me hope. It is Hel, Helen ; Dora hate Amelia Dinard.\nH. R. Who are you ?\nDon't you remember ? I went not so long ago.\nH. R. When did I meet you ?\n1892.\n\fOct., 1920.

Have you any messages for friends ?\nAsk them all to pray for me.\nH. R. Can't you forgive your husband 1\nNever.\nH. R. Try to love him and you will be happier.\nIt is just my unhappiness [i.e. that she did love him ?).\nH. R. Have you any children with you ?\nNobody is here without that beast ! You hear I shut\nthe door for him.\nH. R. You should try to forgive him.\nYou can speak.\n(The words in italics would be correct in Norwegian.\nWe notice that towards the end of a seance, the English\nis apt to read like a literal translation from the Norwegian\nbut then Froken Bredsdorff says that the Norwegian is\noften like that of an English person.)\nOn Monday, December 8, Frk. Bredsdorff and I held a\nlittle seance alone, in order to find out\u2014if possible\u2014whether\nit was true that \" Alice \" had died. After two other com-\nmunications the following came :\nDora Helen. I hate Amelia.\nH. R. {very impatient). Tell me your husband's name.\nHow can I ?\nThen another communicator came, one who had known\nAlice Percival.\nH. R. Tell me, is it true that Alice is on your side ?\nI don't know, I will try to find it out. Is it a mistake ?\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1920.\nH. R. Was she one of those who came that night ?\nNo, I thought you knew them.\nH. R. Please tell me exactly who was there.\n(Five names were given as having been there besides\nthe communicator herself.)\nH. R. But Alice told me that she had been here with you, is\nit not true ?\nNo.\n(Then we had a very long talk about other matters, aU\nperfectly natural, and I am convinced it was as genuine\nas any such conversations can be ; but we have seen\nhow very easily mistakes slip in.)\nWrite it out and help me :\nDora Helen hates Amelia.\nH. R. Who is Amelia 1\nMy husband's second wife.\nH. R. You must tell me your husband's name, otherwise how\ncan I understand who you are ?\nPercival.\nH. R. What is his Christian name ?\nDon't ask me, I will tell another time. Do help me,\nI am so very unhappy. He has forgotten all our love.\nH. R. You must try not to hate Amelia so much.\nI will hill Amelia.\nH. R. If you talk like that, I won't have anything more to\ndo with you. What was your mother's name ?\nDinard.\nH. R. Where did you live ?\nDo help me !\nI have altered the names according to the usual custom\nof the S.P.R. The name exchanged for \" Percival \" is an\nexceedingly well-known name, and although I had no recollec-\ntion of having ever met Dora Percival, I knew that it would\nnot be at all difficult to identify her if she ever really lived,\nwhich I doubted. First I searched the Peerage, but in vain.\nThen I turned to Who's Who for 1917, and there I found her.\nI confess it gave me an unpleasant shock. 1892 was the\ndate of her death, and aU five names were correctly given,\nexcept that they were sometimes misplaced. For instance, the\ncommunicator is Dora de Dinard, and the name of Mr.\n\fOct., 1920. Case: Some Experiments in Automatism. 245\nPercival's second wife is Helen Amelia, whereas on one occasion\nslie calls herself \" Helen \" and her rival \" de Dinard,\" but\nthe confusion is more likely to be on our side than on hers.\nThe extraordinary, and to my mind the most interesting,\npart of all is the mistake about \" Alice.\" I regard this as\nentirely due to my own subconsciousness. Dora de Dinard\nmust have commrmicated the name of Percival to me, but\ninstead of the letters being pointed out on the spiritoscope,\nthe name translated itself in my mind to \" Alice, \" Alice\nPercival being the only lady of that name whom I know.\nBut it is certainly very curious that my subconscious imagina-\ntion should have dramatised a whole conversation with Alice,\nespecially as it must have been transferred from my mind\nto the medium's, as I am always more than usually careful\nnot to influence the glass pointer when I am asking test\nquestions.\nI had many experiences of this kind during my telepathic\nexperiments with Miss Miles, when it seemed as though my\nmind were being helped to get at the right thing by means\nof something nearly approaching to it. Compare our first\nexperiment : the Sphinx, when I got \" Luxor in Egypt.\"\nOn New Year's Eve, we had another communication. This\ntime I asked :\nH. R. Is Dora de Dinard there ? We have not heard of her\nfor a long time.\nShe is stiU hating.\nH. R. I want to explain to you that it is 27 years since you\nleft this world, and your husband must be a very old\nman now, so it is time you forgave.\nLove has no age. No ! My love is young and too warm\nto be laughed at.\nH. R. Can you remember your sister's name ? (if she had a\nsister ? I wanted proof of something that was not\ncontained in Who's Who).\nI only know that I had a husband that I loved so dearly.\nH. R. But can't you tell me your sister's name ?\nI can't, don't ask me. Helen Amelia is the only name\n- I remember. You didn't know my unhapj^iness.\nH. R. Did you know Amelia before your husband married her ?\nYes, but not as a friend.\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1920.\nH. R. As an enemy then ?\nNo.\nH. R. Did your husband care for her in your lifetime 1\nI don't know, but very soon after, too soon, just after,\nwhen I wept for my child and my beloved husband.\nDora died in 1892, and Mr. Percival married again in 1893.\nAt a later sitting on February 23, 1920, when Froken\nBredsdorfi and I were alone, the following was obtained :\nHate.\nH. R. Who is it ?\nHow can you ask ? I love.\nI only saw the awful picture\u2014Helen Amelia in my place.\nH. R. Your husband is still alive, what did you mean by\ntelling me that he was with you and that you had\nshut the door on him ?\nH. R. He shut the door for me [i.e. on me) that first time I\nwent back, and my door has been shut {i.e. ever since).\nH. R. But is he in this world, or in yours ?\nI don't know, I only see that picture.\n(\" that picture,\" i.e. that sight, that vision, it would\nbe correct in Norwegian ; the English messages nearly\nalways read like translations, and I am told that the\nNorwegian messages also read like translations from\nEnglish !)\nOn this occasion the medium had a distinct vision of Dora\nde Dinard. She described her as very tall and fair, and said\nshe pointed to the photograph of a child and to a pendant\nwhich she wore\u2014it was a large single stone set in diamonds.\nI will try to find out w-hether this description is correct.\nOne always forms a mental picture of a person, and I had\nfancied her to be a small woman and very vivacious, not\nat all like the medium's description.\nEditorial Note.\nIn a letter to us dated March 29, 1920, Miss Ramsden\nwrites :\nThe maiden name of [Dora de Dinard] was (her\nfather's name), but [de Dinard] was the mother's name\nand she was christened by it.\n\fOct., 1920. Case: Some Experiments in Automatism. 247\nSubsequently Miss Eamsden informed us that siie had\nascertained that Mr. Percival (Dora de Dinard's husband)\nwas still alive.\nIt will be observed that Miss Ramsden and Froken Breds-\ndorfi were the only two persons who were present at all the\nsittings at which Dora de Dinard purported to communicate.\nIt appears exceedingly improbable that the names and facts\ngiven had ever been within the knowledge of Froken Bredsdorff,\nwhose influence is presumably seen in the foreign turns of\nlanguage used here and there. On the other hand the curious\nepisode concerning \" Alice Percival \" shows, as Miss Ramsden\nherself has pointed out, that her own mind was by one means\nor another influencing the communications. It is evidently\nimpossible to prove a negative, namely that Miss Ramsden\nhad never consciously or unconsciously known anything of\nDora de Dinard or her circumstances. AU that can be said\non this point is that, so far as she is aware. Miss Ramsden\nhad never met Mr. Percival, or either of his two wives, and\nthe investigation she entered upon in consequence of the\nstatements made at the sittings failed to evoke any recollec-\ntion in her mind of having ever met the people concerned or\nknown anything about them.\nThe year 1892, given at one of the sittings as the date\nat which Miss Ramsden met Dora de Dinard, was in fact\nthe year of the latter's death, as is mentioned in Who's Who.\nThis mistake rather suggests that if the knowledge shown\nin the automatic messages was possessed imconsciously by\nMiss Ramsden, Who's Who was the source of that knowledge.^\nIf that is so, the case is a remarkable instance of cryptomnesia\nand unconscious dramatisation.\n' Miss Ramsden asks us to say that she quite agrees as to Who's Wlio being a\npossible source of the knowledge shown, the copy having been in her possession\nsince 1917. What struck her particularly was the persistence of the \" communi-\ncator,\" in whom none of the automatists took any particular interest. She also\nasks us to say that although she does not remember meeting Mr. Percival, or any\nof his family, his official position makes it not improbable that she may at sorue\ntime have come across him at social gatherings in London.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1920.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. Cases in the Journal for July, 1920.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nAugust 4, 1920.\nMadam,\u2014Referring to the case of possible clairvoyance on pp. 230-\n233 of the July Journal, does it not seem that the j^ossibility\nof chance coincidence has been overlooked or insufficiently allowed\nfor ? The point is, why did Mr. Christopher Cowper ask his\nquestion about Atlantis at the moment when his hand was resting\non the statuette which had\u2014unknown to Mr. Cowper, sen.\u2014\na\nroundabout connection with the lost continent ? It is perhaps\ntempting to sujDpose some supernormal connection\u2014psychometry\nor what not\u2014 but this should be done only if normal explanations\nseem insufficient. I suggest that the Atlantis story is brought\nto mind by many things, and may have come to the surface of\nthe boy's consciousness by an association-chain beginning with\nanything in or about America. In my own mind I believe there\nis always a conscious awareness of the Atlantic Ocean when I\nthink of America, and I know that I sometimes think of Atlantis\nin consequence, though I am not specially interested in it and\nhave not read Plato's account for some time. Perhaps Mr.\nCowper's son had been thinking about something American\n\u2014\nPresident Wilson or Charlie Chaplin !\n\u2014which brought up the\nthought of Atlantis at the lucky moment. Anyhow, whatever\nthe process, it does not seem that the fact of the Atlantis remark\nat that particular moment is beyond a chance-coincidence explana-\ntion.\nSomewhat similarly with the Mrs. Leonard case on pp. 226-230.\nThe point is, is it unreasonable to suppose that Mrs. Leonard\nhad normally acquired knowledge of the death of a Sylvia Parkinson\nand that the latter had a friend named Kitty Stevenson ? It\nmay be unreasonable, but it is a difficult thing to feel sure about.\nSome sitters talk a good deal to the medium, and the latter's\nknowledge, supraliminal and subliminal, may safely be regarded\nas very extensive.\nI have no prejudice against supernormal hypotheses, in fact\nI am compelled to adopt some far-reaching ones in explanation of\nmy own experiences ; but we must keep the standard of evidence\nhigh, carefully considering all normal interpretations before allowing\nourselves to go beyond them. J. Arthur Hill.\n\fOct., 1920. Correspondence. 249\nII. On Evidence for Survival.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nJuly 13, 1920.\nMadam,\u2014It is the impression of an old associate that the\ninvestigations of the Society with regard to survival are largely\nvitiated by what seems to be the merest assumption that minds,\nspirits, souls, persons, whether dead or alive, are separate, mutually\nexclusive entities. When a phenomenon occurs the question is\nasked, Did this emanate from entity A (who is alive) or from\nentity B (who is dead) ? I suggest that this is a bad way of\nputting the question. It were better to regard mind as one\nand imiversal, and persons as centres of consciousness in it.\nWhen a phenomenon occurs we are, to start with, in doubt as\nto whether it emanates from a centre of consciousness at all. It\nmay be that when a number of centres, more or less consciously\nco-operating with one another, desire e.g. that evidence may be\nforthcoming, the result may be that a desire to that effect is\nset U23 in impersonal mind. Such a desire may become a transient\nimpersonal centre, a kind of pseudo-person, in telepathic rapport\nwith the living, co-operating centres. From them it may attract\nmaterial {e.g. literary quotations) refashion it and return it as\nfragments through mediums. We then get a cross-correspondence\nwhich was not designed by any centre of consciousness either\ndead or alive.\nR. Gordon Milburn.\nREVIEWS.\nI. The Idea of Immortality. Its Development and Value. By\nGeorge Galloway. The Baird Lecture. Edinburgh, T. & T.\nClark. 1919. Pp. viii, 234.\nThis scholarly work, by an eminent Scottish theologian, arrives\n(as might have been expected) at the conclusion that immortality\nis essentially a religious, not a scientific or a philosophic doctrine,\nwhich is bound up with the belief in a personal God, revealed\nin Christ, who respects personality in others, and cannot \" cast\nthe souls which proceed from Him as '\nrubbish to the void.'\n\"\nThis means, of course, that Dr. Galloway prefers to leave the\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1920.\nquestion a matter of faith, or, as he says, \" a sure hope \" : at\nthe same time he is not merely scornful of those who aim, more\nambitiously, at scientifie knowledge. He devotes some pages to\nthe \" labours \" of the S.P.R., and particularly to the argument\nfrom cross-corresj)ondences, points out (as is indeed obvious)\nthat \" it would be extraordinarily hard to prove that these\nfragmentary and somewhat elusive messages could only have\nemanated from a particular deceased person \"\n(p. 96), and\ncomments on \" the disappointing character \" and \" triviality\n\"\nof the messages. His final objection is that the evidence does\nnot \" imply more than a limited survival,\" and that this is not\n\" eternal life.\" In all this, he hardly seems to apprehend the\npeculiar strength of scientific proof, which is cumulative though\nnot final, though he admits that it is \" just possible \" that\nmore evidence may be forthcoming. Of course that is just the\nadvantage scientific evidence has over other methods of proof.\nA metaphysical argument is a hit-or-miss affair, and indeed always\nthe latter, unless it submits to scientific verification after formula-\ntion, as any '\nanticipation of nature '\nshould. A religious argument\ncan only appeal to those who share the faith it presupposes. It\nis only scientific evidence that can engender growing probabilities\nwhich gradually appease all doubts. On the other hand scientific\nmethod rather frowns upon the argument from '\ndisappointment,'\nand inquires with what right men form expectations that prejudice\nthe verdict of the facts. Lastly, the objection that 'survival'\nis not '\nimmortality,' seems hardly to be more than verbal.\nOf course no evidence that a man had survived by, say, five\nyears his reputed '\ndeath,' could prove that he would still be in\nbeing five million years hence : but the principle that sustained\nthe decapitated Areopagite on his memorable walk from Paris\nto St. Denis would seem to be applicable to the case. Ce 71 est\nque le premier pas qui coute : if a soul can once survive the\nchange called '\ndeath,' it surely inspires confidence in its ability\nto cope with similar emergencies later. Finally it may be noted\nthat p. 105 contains a slip. Plato puts the crusty old sea-god,\nGlaucus, in the same dialogue with his* gay young brother,\nGlaucon ; but it was to the former that he compared the soul\nin Rep). 611 D. The passage is a curious one, for it seems to\nimply that neither '\ndesire '\nnor '\nspirit,' but only '\nreason,' belongs\nto the immortal soul, and so would knock out '\npersonal ' immor-\ntality : but perhaps it only shows how little even the best\n\fOct., 1920.

By R. R. Marett. London, 1920.\nMethuen & Co. Pp. ix, 27-5.\nDr. Marett's brilliant and fascinating Essays, which were mostly\ndelivered as Presidential Addresses to the Folklore and other\nSocieties, deal with anthropology from the standpoint of a\nphilosophical psychologist. They are excellent reading and full\nof the ^^gour and vivacity of all Dr. Marett's writings ;\nbut,\nunfortunately for the purposes of the present review, they are\nconsistently anthropological in their outlook, and strictly relevant\nto their title. That is to say they do not concern themselves\nwith Psychical Research as such, and only touch upon it indirectly\nin the paper on The Primitive Medicine Man, to whom he (con-\nvincingly) assigns a place in the pedigree of the Priest rather\nthan of the Physician. Not that Dr. Marett is hostile or im-\nsympathetic to Psychical Research\u2014he is too good an empiricist\nto beg such questions a priori\u2014but it does not enter into the\nplan of any of his papers to consider the truth-value of the\nbeliefs in magic and the supernatural which anthropology records.\nOr rather should record, more fully than it has done. For it\nis plain that, even at the lowest estimation, these beliefs are\neminently collectible. When collected, moreover, they should\nthrow light on several interesting problems of human psychology.\nFor example, is it a fact that savages in general are more\n'\npsychic '\nor '\nmediumistic '\nthan civilized men 1 That is a\nquestion that should be capable of definite and scientific answer.\nIt is surely as well worth testing as the colour-sense of savages,\nor the allegations that they are stronger and have keener senses.\nIt may be an illusion ; or again it may turn out to be a fact,\neither because '\npsychism ' is a primitive endowment that is\natrophying, or because its intensity has been reduced in us by\nthe prolonged persecution of psychics under the laws against\n'\nwitchcraft.' Then again there are such rites as the '\nfire-walk\n'\nwith which no one seems to have concerned himself since the\ndemise of Andrew Lang, Anyhow it is clear that anthropology\nand psychical research ought to co-operate.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1020.\nIII. Modern Psychical Phenomena. By Heeeward Carrington,\nPh.D. 1919. Pp. xi, 331. London : Kegan Paul, Trench,\nTrubner & Co., Ltd.\nDr. Carrington's latest work consists for the most part of articles\nwhich have previously appeared in various reviews and popular\nmagazines. In one way this is a defect, since what appeals to\na magazine reading public is not the sort of material which is of\nvalue to the serious student of psychical research. Indeed it may\nbe said that Dr. Carrington has done himself an injustice, however\nunavoidable it may have been, in republishing those of his articles\nwhich were originally intended for popular consumption.\nThe book itself is divided into three parts. In the first Dr.\nCarrington touches lightly upon such momentous questions as\nman's destiny and the origin of evil, whilst a chapter is devoted\nto his own striking theories of vitality, fasting and nutrition,\nwith special reference to recent ex^^eriments on the physiology\nof sleep. In the second part he deals with current theories and\nexperiments, one chapter being given up to the dynamistograph,\nan instrument invented by two Dutch experimenters, through\nthe mechanism of which they believe that instrumental connexion\nmay be set up with discarnate entities. Their experiments and\nconclusions have been set forth in a volume entitled Het Geheim\nvan den Dood {The Mystery of Death) which, by the way, has\nbeen translated into French. Dr. Carrington seems to place\nmore value on these experiments than appears to be warranted\nby the facts. He omits for example to mention that the Bureau\nInternational Spiritisme requested the co-director of the Toekomstiy\nLeven to prepare a report which was not particularly favourable,\nthe inventors having already experimented with but poor results\nin connexion with a spiritistic group at the Hague. Variations\nin temperature and the trouble involved in completely isolating\nthe apparatus render all such experiments both costly and per-\nplexing, and Dr. Carrington seems to have passed over these\ndifficulties somewhat too easily. Similarly in his treatment of\npsychic photography, especially in connexion with the Keeler-\nLee-Bocock photographs, a weakening in Dr. Carrington's usual\ncritical judgment seems to be apparent which is to be noted\nwith regret. The volume closes with an interesting discussion\nof the physiology of crystal gazing and crystal vision, a line of\nresearch that might be followed up with much profit by future\ninvestigators.

J. Crawford, D.Sc.\nEveryone who is interested in Psychical Research will have\nlearned with deep regret of Dr. Crawford's tragic and untimely\ndeath.\n\f25G Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1920.\nWith tte possible exception of the late Sir William Crookes'\nBesearches in Spiritualism,, which appeared nearly fifty years\nago, it is probable that no records o\u00a3 investigations into\n\"physical\" phenomena have attracted so much attention\nand aroused such widespread interest as Dr. Crawford's two\nbooks on the subject. Even among the strictest sect of\nthose who unhesitatingly ascribe the great majority of psychic\nphenomena to fraud and malobservation, it is very common\nto find an exception made in favour of Dr. Crawford's work.\nIn the opinion of the present writer this attitude is well\njustified, for whether future investigators succeed in confirming\nDr. Crawford's results or not, there can be no doubt that\nhis determination to use objective and quantitative methods\nwhenever possible invests his conclusions with a unique claim\nto serious consideration.\nThis quantitative attitude, so to speak, was doubtless largely\ndue to his work as Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at\nthe BeKast Municipal Technical Institute, which would naturally\nincline him to investigate the fundamental mechanics of\nthe phenomena, before attempting to study their more abstruse\nfeatures. Such a procedure is clearly correct, and future\ninvestigators wiU owe Dr. Crawford a debt of gratitude for\nhaving given them definite experiments to repeat and a\ndefinite working hypothesis to test as soon as, and if, they\nsucceed in eliminating fraud from the cases they encounter.\nThis alone would constitute a valuable contribution to the\nstudy of this branch of Psychical Research, while if the\nexperiments are successfully repeated and the working hypo-\nthesis confirmed, Dr. Crawford's work will undoubtedly tstkfi\nrank as one of the classical researches of modern times.\nIt would be idle to deny that certain critics, especially\nthose who have neither seen the phenomena nor closely studied\nDr. Crawford's accounts of them, will now attempt to dismiss\nthem as fraudulent. This is inevitable for reasons quite\napart from the intrinsic merits of the case, and it is very\nunfortunate that it never proved practicable, during Dr.\nCrawford's lifetime, to arrange for thorough independent\nobservation of his principal results.\nThe present writer repeatedly urged Dr. Crawford to arrange\nfor something of the kind, even at the cost of suspending\n\fNov., 1920. In Memoriam : Dr. W. J. Gratvford. 257\nhis experimental work, and pointed out that although he\n(Dr. C.) and many of those who had been present at demon-\nstration seances might have no doubt as to the genuineness\nof the phenomena, the general scientific public could scarcely\nbe expected fuUy to share in this conviction unless some\ncollateral support in the shape of independent verification\nwere forthcoming.\nIt is very greatly to be hoped that some such independent\ncheck may yet be applied in order to expedite the assessment\nof Dr. Crawford's work at its true value.\nIn the meantime even the most captious critic must admit\nthe unique quality of that work and deplore the loss of so\nenthusiastic and ingenious a student of the subject.\nw. w. s.\nA FOOTNOTE\nTo Dr. T. W. Mitchell's Review of the Doris Case in the\nS.P.E. Proceedings for May, 1920.\nBy Walter Franklin Prince, Ph.D.\nIn common with other readers, I was interested in Dr.\nMitchell's careful and sagacious study of the Doris Case of\nmultiple personality. In the main I am sympathetic with\nhis opinions, and would not have what I am to say regarded\nas a \" reply,\" \" defence,\" or anything but a courteous explana-\ntion, from my point of view, of a few details on which we\nsomewhat differ. For convenience I cite his pages.\nI quite agree that at the time I was an amateur in hyp-\nnotism (32-33) though hardly so at the present time. The\nreviewer's interpretation of the result of my suggestions is\nmy own. There was never any idea that Sleeping Margaret's\ndirections were the only ones which could have been followed\nsuccessfully, nor that she, whether personality, spirit or sub-\nconscious stratum, was a scientist or trained physician.\nBut did I habitually hypnotize the girl ? (49-51) My opinion\nmay be reached by a series of questions. Do I hypnotize\nmyself when I put myself to sleep by suggestion, as I often\ndo ? Is a person who falls asleep without suggestion, spon-\ntaneously, hypnotized ? Yet the same after effects were as\n\f258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1920.\nreadily produced by talking to her in the first stage of spon-\ntaneous sleep as when I aided its approach by suggestion.\n(See case of July 4, 1913.) Was she hypnotized when sugges-\ntion was employed in the daytime not for the purpose of\ninducing sleep 1 True, there was between us \"at all times\nthe same rapport as exists between the hypnotist and his\npatient,\" but will Dr. Mitchell contend that she was at all\ntimes in hypnosis ?\nCertainly all these phenomena are related to each other, but\nthey are not all hypnosis. Exactly as Dr. Mitchell finds that\ncertain helpful effects as well as hurtful ones result from dissociation,\nbut does not regard them all as deserving the name of hysteria.\nIt is really a question of words, of names, between Dr. Mitchell\nand me. He uses the word hypnotism in a wider sense than I do.\nI consider that there is a borderland before one reaches the boundary\nline beyond which hypnosis plainly lies, and that sleep which in\nno way seems to difier from ordinary sleep except that its\nadvent v\/as assisted by suggestion does not lie beyond the\nboundary. There can be no question that there was a limit\nat which I stopped. I did not wish that other personalities\nshould artificially be produced as appears to have been the\ncase with Miss Beauchamp. I avoided the hypnotic stunts\nof dividing and blending practised by Dr. Morton Prince.\nThis is what is principally meant by the statement that I\nabstained from hypnotizing Doris, though my language might\nhave been better guarded.\nIt is stated (34) that Sleeping Margaret dominated me,\nand Dr. Mitchell is \" inclined to think that she was my\ncommander-in-chief.\" I am inclined to think that the\nreviewer yielded to the temptations of a humorous phrase.\nIt should be evident from the Report that I had but one\ngreat object in view\u2014the cure of the case\u2014and that I was\ncontinually observing and experimenting, and shaping my\ncourse accordingly. Whatever worked well there was willing-\nness to adopt and whatever worked ill was discarded. Aside\nfrom all questions of Sleeping Margaret's nature, it was found\nthat she was the source of much information that could not\notherwise be obtained, and that it usually paid to try out\nher suggestions. I was perfectly aware that the advisabiUty\nmight be self-induced, but that made no difference in the\n\fNov., 1920. A Footnote to the Boris Case. 259\npolicy to be pursued. If to heed the teachings of experience\nwas to constitute her my \" commander-in-chief,\" then she\nwas that by the definition. But probably most readers will\nnot consider my own term, \" chief coadjutor,\" as defective.\nNor do I suppose that Dr. Mitchell would have cormseUed\nanother course. It should be remembered that this long-seated\nand compHcated case, of whose recovery the records of\ndissociation gave no hope, was cured. I never supposed that\nSleeping Margaret was infaUible, but even if regarded only as\na means of promoting tranquillity and a favourable soil for\nfruitage, it was best to consider well what she said.\nIt should be noted that the Eeport, long as it is, is nearly\nall devoted to the objective facts and such explications as\nwould make them vmderstood as facts, in order that students\nmight have in possession a laboratory in which to work out\ntheir own conclusions. I philosophized and dogmatized very\nlittle, and thus am open here and there to the suspicion that\nI was more naive than really was the case,\u2014that I was\ncommitted to every surface-appearance of things described.\nI expected that the identification of \" Sleeping Real Doris\n\"\nas a separate though inchoate personality would be regarded\nas \"on grounds perhaps inadequate \" (.35). I would not have\nbeen entirely convinced had I been in the reviewer's place,\nand am confident that had the reviewer witnessed all that\nI witnessed in that richness which is not quite communicable,\nhe would have had no misgivings. \" This beHef was con-\nfirmed by Margaret,\" (35) but that is not all. She \" con-\nfirmed \" it before she knew that I had any such behef. But\n.that is only a detail in the evidence.\nThere is no inconsistency in sapng in one place that Sleeping\nMargaret impressed me \"as if she were a woman of forty,\"\nand in another that \" she is at least as mature as R. D. is.\"\nThe first was my full impression, the second a very cautious\nstatement, allowing a wide margin.\nIt is a somewhat amusing surprise to find that after writing\n1400 pages in an effort to tell everything more minutely than\nanything was ever told before I should be suspected of con-\ncealing something about Real Doris (38-39). It is said that\nin the Report she is \" elusive,\" that her characteristics are\nnot revealed so fully as those of the other personalities, and\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1920.\nthat I was \" blinded \" to the fact that the Real Doris of\nmy account does not win readers as Margaret does. It was\nno part of my purpose to make readers like this or that\npersonality, as I was not writing a novel. But I concealed\nnothing. It simply was not necessary to give minute descrip-\ntions of Real Doris's conduct, it was so nearly normal. If a\nonce normal lamb grew two heads, six legs and various\nother abnormalities, it surely would be in order to describe\nall these minutely, but it would not be necessary to set\ndown every particular item of description regarding the normal\nlamb. Pages 142-145 in the Report contain a faithful and\nadequate description of Real Doris. Of com-se when Margaret\nwas near the surface and actually influencing the conduct,\nthere were corresponding shadings. There are plenty of brief\nnotices throughout the Record which, if taken altogether,\namount to a description of her. If she had displayed \" many\nhysterical stigmata \" I would have detailed them, as I did\nin the case of Sick Doris, who was a typical hysteric.\nWhen my reviewer quotes that Sleeping Margaret \" appeared\nto be a highly analytical and philosophical mind,\" (63) he\nshould have added that she expressly disclaimed reasoning\nout the abstruse and difficult propositions which she sometimes\nannounced and that there developed evidence that she spoke\ntruly\u2014that in some sense she simply described what she saw.\nPassing over the good-natured though painful thrust that\nI was \" not trained in the methods of science,\" which is not\ncorrect unless training in a laboratory is meant, we come\nto the statement that \" in the earher records \" I was \" un-\nbiassed \" (68) but that later I was \" undoubtedly more favour-\nably incUned towards the spiritistic hypothesis.\" This seems\nto imply that my mind was evenly balanced so long as I\nwas hostile to, or at least determined to exhaust every\n\" normal \" hypothesis before admitting the possibility of, a\nspiritistic factor, but that the moment the evidence made\nme admit, tentatively, the existence of that factor, I became\nbiassed. As a matter of fact I was not fully convinced of\nsuch a factor to the end of the case, but simply wished to\nbe fair to the facts and let readers judge for themselves.\nNor is it quite proper to say that I \" had to admit \" that\ncertain seemingly telepathic incidents were not conclusive in\n\fNov., 1920. A Footnote to the Doris Case. 261\nthemselves, (65) since I calmly asserted this, and it was not\nwrung from me as an admission. I did not particularly\ncare whether telepathy was involved or not. And my point\nin saying that these incidents should be read in the light\nof others lay in the fact that others were stronger. Dr.\nMitcheU cited one of these, and another and more complex\nexample, which he did not cite, is that of the graveyard.\nI would not admit that any imaginable single case of alleged\ntelepathy could be conclusive by itself. But I see no way\nto explain several incidents in the Report on normal lines.\nWhy he picked out the Adelaide \" and \" Marie \" incidents\n(67-69), which are weak cases, I do not know.\nThe reviewer finds it \" difficult to explain \" why one rises\nfrom the Report \" almost ready to believe that Sleeping\nMargaret is a spirit \" (69). I nowhere say that she is ; it\nmust be the magic of the facts reported which produces the\npecuhar efJect.\nDr. Mitchell cites certain contradictions between Sleeping\nMargaret's earher statements and her later ones when she\nclaimed to be a spirit (70). But he neglects the frequent\nearlier remarks which articulated better with the later claims,\nand which seemed to cause her embarrassment when she\nbecame conscious of their imphcations. It is easy for the reader\nto suppose that she put on the appearance for a deep and\ndark purpose, but I studied her for years and am certain\nthat this was not the case. Whatever she really was, her\nlater claim was made in good faith, and in the earlier period\nshe was practising evasion for some purpose.\nHow it ever was found out that I was \" not a httle per-\nturbed by the mendacity \" of the secondary personaUties (73)\nI cannot fathom. The detail in which these mendacities\nwere set forth, and the interest displayed in discovering the\ncategories in which they arranged themselves, might as well\nhave imphed enthusiasm. And why should I have been\n\" tired of reiterating that Real Doris was absolutely truthful\n\"\nwhen that was a fact of large and recurrent importance ?\nThe reviewer has not been successful in his estimates of\nmy emotions in the course of writing the Report, the principal\nactual one having been the desire to present a faithful picture\nof the facts in their proper perspective.\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Stevenson.\n\fNov., 1920. Case: An Apparition seen after Death. 263\nThe letter enclosed from Mrs. Middleton was as follows :\nDecember 5, 1919.\nDear [Mr. Stevenson],\nI am sorry not to have answered your letter before, but we\nare mo\\dng here and are not yet into our Rectory, and so have\nbeen very busy. It is quite true that the woman who cleans\nL Church and I have both seen Canon [Hopkinson], though\nthere was an interval of three years between, and. I never knew\nthat she had seen him until I got your letter and went to ask\nher about it. Both times he was in a long white surpKce and\nin the same place, she saw him at about 12.30 and I at about\n4 p.m. I have never seen anybody before like that, and it\nseemed only natural to me that he should be in the Church\nthat he was so fond of. \u2014Believe me, Yours truly,\n[M. Middleton].\nIn response to Mr. Stevenson's inAatation Mrs. Salter ^asited\nL on March 16, 1920, and wrote the following report.\nMrs. Salter's Report.\nOn the afternoon of March 16, 1920, I visited the Parish\nChurch of L accompanied by Mr. Stevenson and the\npresent Rector. I was shown an entry in the Parish Book\n(kept in the church) which ran as follows :\nSept. 6, 1919. At about 6 p.m. Jdrs. [Middleton] went down\nto the church to see to the altar vases. When she entered\nthe door she saw Canon [Hopkinson] standing between the Rectory\nand the Grange Pews. He was wearing a surplice and stole.\nShe was about to speak to him when he held ujj his right hand\nas if to prevent her speaking. He then disappeared. She did\nnot feel at all frightened. [R. Middleton i].\nI then went on to see the caretaker, whom I wiU call Mrs.\nJames, and obtained from her an account of her experience.\nShe told me that she saw Canon Hopkinson sitting on \" the\nchildren's seats in the middle aisle opposite the door.\" She\nhad unlocked the door when she came in. He was wearing\na long white robe. Her first idea was that he was someone\ncome to conduct a serAdce, though she was rather surprised\nto see anyone in the church. He got up when she came in\n1 Mrs. Middleton's husband, then Rector of L .\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1920.\nand spoke to her \" in a very quiet voice,\" and she recognised\nhim at once. He said he was glad she had got the church\nwork to do, and told her not to tell any one that she had\nseen him. He then passed her and went out of the church\nturning, down the path towards his grave. This happened\nabout 4 p.m. in August or September, about a year after\nCanon Hopkinson died.\nI asked Mrs. James whether there was anything unusual\nin Canon Hopkinson's appearance, and she said \" only that\nhe looked as if he hadn't shaved lately.\" Since Canon\nHopkinson habitually wore a beard and, according to what\nMrs. James said, was seen by her wearing a beard, the meaning\nof this remark of hers was not clear. On being further\nquestioned on this point she said that he \" looked rather\nblack round the mouth.\"\nMrs. James told her story very simply and straightforwardly.\nShe did not seem anxious to make it sensational or striking\nin any way. She said she had not spoken of her experience\nat the time, except to her daughter who lives with her. She\nhad had no similar experiences before. Mrs. James's daughter\nwas present during our interview, and corroborated her mother's\nstatement. H. de G.

Case: An Apparition seen after Death. 265\nIt will be observed that the statement made to Mr. Steven-\nson (see his letter above) that Mrs. Middleton saw the appari-\ntion near the altar was not correct, nor was Mrs. Middleton\ncorrect in her recollection (some months after the event)\nthat she saw the apparition at 4 p.m. According to Mr.\nMiddleton's contemporary record in the Parish Book she saw\nthe apparition at \" about 6 p.m.\" This discrepancy, however,\ndoes not appear to have much importance ; at 6 p.m. (summer\ntime), which was 5 p.m. (Greenwich time) on September 6, 1918,\nthe light would be quite good. Mrs. James, according to\nher own statement, saw the apparition \" at about 4 p.m.\" in\nAugust or September. With regard to the possibiUty that\nsome effect of hght might have caused a visual illusion in\neach case, it is to be noted that, although Mrs. Middleton\nand Mrs. James saw the apparition in approximately the\nsame part of the church, they did not see it in the same\nposition. There seems no reason to suppose that an efEect\nof hght which might produce the illusion of a figure at point B\n(on the plan) would also produce one at point C. With\nregard to the identifying of the apparition, Mrs. James\nwas very famihar with Canon Hopkinson's appearance, having\nseen him often during his lifetime. Mrs. Middleton had\nnever seen Canon Hopkinson during his hfetime, but knew\nhis appearance from photographs.\nMrs. Middleton is quite clear upon the point that she knew\nnothing of Mrs. James's experience at the time that she\nsaw the apparition herself.\nCanon Hopkinson died in the latter part of August, 1914.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nOn Evidence for Survival.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In Mr, Gordon Milburn's \" impersonal mind \" I seem\nto discover our old friend the \" Cosmic Reservoir of Memories\n\"\nunder another guise.

Why should these qualities be \" transient \" 1\nAlthough I am aware that the simple explanation is not neces-\nsarily the correct one, I must say that I prefer, as a Working\nHypothesis, the theory that the real personality survives death,\nand under certain conditions can and does communicate with\npersons still on earth.\nThe \" impersonal mind,\" together with the \" transient impersonal\ncentres,\"! recall Prof. Wm. James' conception of a \" cosmic\nreservoir, where the memory of all mundane facts is stored\nand grouped around personal centres of association.\" Mr. Henry\nHolt, in commenting on this, remarks that his mind is not\nsubtle enough to be very seriously impressed by the difference\nbetween a \" memory of mundane facts stored and grouped aroimd\npersonal centres of association \" and a surviving personality.\nThere is, however, another point and a very important one :\na personality does not consist merely of a train of memories, and\nmany communications reveal peculiarities of expression, modes\nof thought, and traits of character, which although possibly\nmodified to some extent by the new environment, are perfectly\nrecognizable, and which must receive explanation under any\nhypothesis.\nThis point has never received due recognition, although Mr.\nHenry Holt, in his book On the Cosmic Relations, states that to\nhim it was just those expressions of personality, the \" initiative,\nresponse, repartee, and emotional and dramatic elements \" that\ncarried conviction of identity, more so even than the imparting\nsupernormally of so-called \" evidential \" information.\nC.

Bergson has collected various addresses\ndelivered, or essays published, by him in the years 1901 to\n1913, and among them his address as President of the Society\nfor Psychical Research in the latter year. In some of the articles\nwill be found fuller treatment of some topics referred to in that\naddress. For this reason, and because almost all the subjects\ntreated of bear directly or indirectly on the work in which our\nSociety is engaged, the volume should be of great interest to\nour members. We may add also because in several articles the\nwork of our Society is referred to.\nThe book is written throughout in M. Bergson's delightfully\nclear and beautiful style, which makes it a pleasure to read\nall he writes even apart from its philosophical value ; and the\ntreatment of a subject of limited scope in each article requires\nof the reader less wide and continuous grasp of philosophical\nproblems than is the case with M. Bergson's larger works, and\nthus brings his reasoning more within the grasp of the general\nreader. This is of course especially the case with those addresses\nwritten for popular audiences. A more difficult but very sugges-\ntive essay is the one on the feeling of having previously lived\nthrough exactly the present experience\n\u2014\" Le souvenir du present\net la fausse reconnaissance.'\" A very interesting essay is the first\nin the volume\n\u2014\" La conscience et la vie.''

Is Sjnritualism based on Fraud ? the Evidence of Sir A. Conan\nDoyle and others drastically examined. By Joseph McCabe.\n1920. Pp. V, 160. London : Watts & Co.\nIn this volume Mr. Joseph McCabe sets out in his usual vigorous\nand slashing style to castigate the devoted] adherents of the\nspiritualistic faith and incidentally to cast scorn upon the more\nserious side of psychical research. If the writer's intention was\nto remind the unthinking public that fraud is common in psychical\nphenomena he has probably succeeded in his task, but to the\nserious student the book will be found to be of little interest.\nMr. McCabe is at pains to expose the arguments and pretensions\nof j^ersone whose acquaintance with the subject is such that they\neasily lend themselves to the most crushing replies. But he\nhimself cannot be said to be over accurate. For example, on\npage 33, speaking of the Turin sittings, he says that Linda\nGazzera being a lady and a good Catholic could not of course\nbe stripped and searched, whereas Prof. Richet distinctly says\nwith reference to these very sittings that before every seance\nshe was completely undressed by Mme. R. or by another of the\nladies present and then re-clothed in ianother tight-fitting garment.\nAgain, it was not Schrenck-Notzing who sewed Linda in a sack\nbut Dr. Charpentier, an error indicating that the author's state-\nments must be taken with due reserve. It would indeed be a\nthankless task to point out the many mistakes and misrepresenta-\ntions with which the book abounds. In actual omissions the\nfacts are even more curious. Thus the S.P.R. Report on Eusapia\nPalladino is silently passed over and space^ given to the farcical\nAmerican sittings. Such celebrated mediums as Mile. Tomczyk,\nMrs. Blake, Miss Burton and Mrs. Chenoweth, are not even so\nmuch as mentioned, the reader being denied the pleasure of\nhearing their full modus operandi exposed by Mr. McCabe. For\nthose, however, who wish to revise their knowledge of the fraudu-\nlent side of spiritualism the book may be confidently recommended\nas a useful addition to the material already existing. It could\ncertainly be profitably read by those persons who are only too\napt to forget the mass of shameless deception which has unfortun-\nately been so often associated with psychical phenomena.

Six or seven years before we had lived in this\nlatter city, and the country round was familiar. Exactly one\nweek before the date of the Revolution, I woke in the middle of\nthe night with what I supposed was a bad nightmare. I saw\ncrowds of Chinese on a certain hill outside Wuchang fighting\ndesperately with firearms, and I was in the midst of the din and\nslaughter trying to escape. I woke up in a state of terror, and\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1920.\ncould not shake off the impression of coming disaster of some\nkind, the fighting had been so fierce. Feeling ill as though from\na shock, I woke my husband and told him of the dream. After\na time I slept again, but on waking in the morning was still\nhaunted by the feeling that something dreadful had happened,\nand I could not shake it off throughout the day. I had no\nfeeling the dream might come true. Up to that time there had\nbeen no hint of any trouble known to the general public, and we\nin Anking had certainly heard nothing, but just one week after\nthe dream the Chinese Revolution broke out in Wuchang. This\nnaturally made a great impression on my mind, but when three\nmonths later BiShop Roots from Hankow, the bishop of the diocese,\nshowed me a photograph with the remark \" This was where the\nfirst shot of the Revolution was fired,\" I felt stunned as I recog-\nnised the very spot I had seen in my dream where the fighting\nwas taking place.\nNo corroboration of this incident is now obtainable. Its\ninterest lies in the fact that Mrs. Munro clearly identified the\nscene of her dream as the hill upon which Bishop Roots\nafterwards told her that the first shot had been fired. She\nrepeated this statement in conversation with Mrs. Salter, saying\nthat she had been quite familiar with the place during her\nresidence at Wuchang. Even if some rumour of the impending\nrevolution had reached Mrs. Munro (which she does not believe\nto be the case), it is curious that she should, in her dream\nhave pictured the fighting in the place where it actually began.\nIf the dream had a supernormal origin, it was presumably\ntelepathic ;\nmany people must have known at the time of the\ndream that the revolution was imminent and where the trouble\nwas likely to begin.\nMrs. Munro's Statement.\nThe next event happened during the winter of 1914. A con-\nference had been arranged to take place in Anking, and amongst\nthose ex|)ected to be present was the late Dr. Jackson, President\nof Boone University of Wuchang. In making the arrangements\nfor entertainment he had been allotted to me and I had written\nto him asking him to stay with us, but owing to pressure of\nwork he had been obliged to refuse. Two weeks later, when the\nConference had been in session three days, I woke at about\n\fDec, 1920. Case : Three Dreams. 271\n2 o'clock in the morning after a very vivid dream. I had heard\nDx. Jackson knocking and calling at the outer gate of the Com-\npound which was 300 yards from our house. There were build-\nings between, and the wooden Venetian shutters of our room were\nclosed. At that distance it would have been quite imposvsible to\nhave heard anyone knocking and calling, and to this all in the\nhouse agreed the following day. I woke with such a strong\nimpression that he was there wanting admittance, that without a\nmoment's thought I roused my husband and told him Dr. Jackson\nwas at the gate and he must get up and let him in. He jumped\nup and half asleej) opened the shutters, and it was only then\nI realised it was only a dream. I apologised most humbly and\nsaid it was a nightmare, expecting him to return at once to bed\nrather wrathy ! But he saw a Chinese lantern moving in the\ndistance, and as the minutes jjassed he realised there was someone\ncoming across the Compound. He waited till they were within\ncalling distance, and then shouted to know who was there. The\nanswer came in Chinese Dr. Jackson.\" My husband turned to\nme in amazement and asked, How did you know Dr. Jackson\nwas coming ?\n\" I could only answer \" I didn't know.\" Dr.\nJackson had sent a telegram we found later, but it was not\ndelivered till the following afternoon. \u2014\nWe have received the following corroboration of this incident\nfrom Dr. R , who was a guest in Mrs. Munro's house at\nthe time :\nOctober 22, 1920.\nI hereby testify that I remember perfectly the incident de-\nscribed by Mrs. [Munro] as occurring in Anking in the winter\nof 1913-4. I was a guest in her house at the time, occupying\nthe room originally prepared for Dr. Jackson, and remember well the\nbustle caused by his arrival in the dark of the morning, and the\nexcitement roused by the story of her \" dream,\" which made a\ngreat impression on us all.\n[L. B. R.]\nIn this case Mrs. Munro's impression would appear to have\nbeen due either to telepathy from Dr. Jackson, or possibly to\nhyperaesthesia. But in this latter case the degree of hyper-\naesthesia would seem to have been considerable.\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dkc, 1920.\nMrs. Munro's Statement.\nOn the night of Oct. 26th, 1917, I had a dream about my son\nwho was in Palestine. I thought I saw him in what appeared\nto be a tent, when suddenly he jumped up and put both hands\nto his forehead. I realised at once that he was hit, and looked\nround for a doctor. At the same time I felt it was hopeless.\nWhen I turned to him again I saw him as he was at the age\nof 11 or 12. Someone called out It's the ice-cream he has\neaten which has caused congestion of the forehead.\" At this\nI wakened up feeling very ill and fearing that something serious\nhad happened to him. My heart was beating rapidly and my\nj)ulse was much above normal. I got no more sleep that night,\nand by 8 o'clock I was so ill the doctor had to be sent for. He\nfound the pulse 130 and the heart in a very bad condition, and\nasked if I had had any shock. I told him of the dream, and he\nsaid it was quite sufficient to account for my condition, but tried\nto reassure me. He reminded me that the last letter from my\nson a few days previously had told us he was in Cairo and had\njoined the Air Force, and the natural anxiety I had been feeling\nwith regard to the dangers of this branch of the service had been\npreying on my mind and was quite enough to account for the\ndream. I had not consciously been worrying about his taking\nthis step ; in fact, as far as I could say, I had felt relieved.\nThe doctor kept me in bed till Wednesday, and then as we had\nhad an invitation to town for the week-end he urged us to accept\nit, as he thought the change would benefit me.\n[There follows an account of an incident which occurred after\ndinner on November 2, 1917, and appears to show that both\nMrs. Munro and those who were with her had a strong impression\nthat her son had been killed, as was in fact the case. But since\nthe incident is of a personal and subjective nature and very\ndifficult to put upon an evidential footing, it is omitted here.]\nWe returned to Cowes, and on Tuesday we received a telegram\nfrom the War Office saying our son had been killed in action on\nNovember 2nd. We received particulars later : \"he was hit\nthrough the forehead with a rifle bullet while crossing over our\nparapet at the head of his men \" . . .\n\" he lived for an hour,\nbut was totally unconscious.\"\n[M. E. Munro.]\n\fDec, 1920. Case: Three Dreams. 273\nWe have received the following corroborative statement\n(addressed to Mrs. Munro) from the doctor who, as mentioned\nabove, attended her on the day after her dream :\nJune 6, 1920.\nDear Mrs. [Munro],\u2014 ... I quite recollect your telling me of\nyour dream about your son and the circumstances affecting your\ncondition on the occasion of my first professional visit. The\ndetails I do not think you mentioned, but I believe you said that\nhe had been either shot or woimded, and I can definitely recollect\nmy trying to reassure you by saying that the last letter from\nyour son was to the effect that he was in Cairo, and had been\naccepted for the Flying Corps. I don't fancy you told me these\nparticulars just at first, but merely that you had had a bad\ndream and woke up much frightened or upset, in reply to my\nquestion as to an exciting cause of your heart attack. . . .\nE. S.\nIn a letter dated July 2.3, 1920, Mrs. Munro wrote to us as\nfollows :\n. . . My boy when quite small could never properly enjoy\nice-cream, because he always said it gave him a pain in the\nforehead. Dragging this into my dream seemed to me to be a\nclever subterfuge on the part of the unconscious, for even in my\ndream it was quite unconvincing. s\nMy husband can corroborate all I wrote to Dr. M'Dougall. He\nread it over very carefully befoie 1 sent it.\nWe have received the following general corroboration from\nMr. Munro :\nOctober 25, 1920.\nI have read over carefully the three accounts of experiences\nnarrated by my wife, Mrs. M, E. [Munro], which were submitted\nrecently to Dr. Wm. M'Dougall, Corpus Christi College, Oxford. I\nhave also read Dr. S 's letter which refers to the same subject.\nI hereby testify to the accuracy of the narratives dealing with\nthese experiences. W. [Munro].\nIf Mrs. Mumo's dream about her son had a supernormal\norigin, it would seem to imply precognition. Mrs. Munro\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1920.\nrepeated to Mrs. Salter her statement that she was not in\nany special anxiety about her son at the time. She had\nhoped that his transfer to the Flying Corps, of which she had\nlately had news, would mean that for a time at least he\nwould be comparatively safe. Her son had been at the front\nfor a considerable period, and she had had no similar impres-\nsion about him before.\nNOTES ON RECENT PERIODICALS.\nI.\nAmongst recent publications issued by the more serious students\nof psychical research, the March number of the American\nProceedings is especially important. Those members of our\nown Society who are wise enough to follow the material\npublished by the American group will remember that in the\nthird part of the eighth volume of the American Proceedings\nan article appeared on \" Some Unusual Phenomena in Photo-\ngraphy.\" The photographs in question had been offered for\nconsideration by a Mrs. Marguerite du Pont Lee, a lady of\nsome means and well known in Washington, D.C., where\nshe Vv^as at that time living. Amongst otlier interesting photo-\ngraphs, which have not yet been explained, occurred a series\nof pictures in which figured the features of a certain Rev.\nKemper Bocock, who died, in 1904 and of whom two photo-\ngraphs only are kno'wn to have been taken when he was alive.\nMrs. Lee was intimately associated in the taking of the alleged\nsupernormal pictures with a person calling himself \" Dr.\"\nAVilliam Keeler, a medium who was believed by Dr. Richard\nHodgson to be fraudulent, and who asserts that he took spirit\nphotographs for Prof. Hare who died in 1858. Mrs. Lee\nherself was puzzled as to the origin of the pictures, and was\ninclined to believe that they were supernormal, as she says,\nlike so many other sitters for these phenomena, that in many\ncases the plates never left her hands for an instant. To\ncut matters short, the mass of material at length found its\nway into the office of the American Society, and in the\n\" Supplementary Report on the Keeler-Lee Photographs\n\"\n\fDec, 1920. Notes on Recent Periodicals. 275\nDr. Walter Prince has published a masterly analysis and\ncomplete exposure of these fraudulent productions.\nBy all those who concern themselves with the study of\nsupernormal pictures Dr. Prince's paper will be foimd to be\nof exceptional interest. He shows that in every instance the\nspirit extra is unmistakably derived from the photographs\ntaken from life, and completely demolishes the foolish argu-\nment, now so common among spiritualists, that the extras are\nin a sense memory pictures emanating from the mind of the\ndeceased. With the exception of certain minor divergences\nthe faces throughout the series are identical with those in\nthe two known life photographs. As Dr. Prince says, there\nare \" thousands of photographs of Mr. Bocock and not one\nof them with face square to the front, exactly in profile or\nturned two-thirds away in either direction. Thousands, and\nwhether he stands amid the wonders of Yosemite, or sits\nat ease in some luxurious apartment, or addresses an audience\nwith uplifted hand, or plays a ^^.olin, or dances a dance\ninvented on earth since his departure, or endeavors to plant\na kiss on the lips of his fair partner (but with evident danger\nto her ear)\u2014in all he is resolved to preserve one or the other\nof two facial angles, exact to the fraction of an inch ; in\nall he maintains that '\nkeep-just-so-and-look-pleasant ' expres-\nsion of the photographic studio ; he smiles not, exults not,\nwonders not, grieves not, nor ever once opens his lips, but\nis as if fixed in the calm of Buddha for ever. In one photo\nhe is addressing an audience with book in hand, but his\nlips are closed and his face is looking cahnly over his right\nshoulder at us. In others he is disclosed near waterfalls,\non giant crags, but he is not looking at or betraying any\ninterest in them. In another his arms encircle a lady most\nconvincingly, but his features show no appropriate rapture,\nwhile his calm gaze passes her by utterly.\"\nIt is certainly all very curious, but the credulous wiU\nnaturally say that Mr. Bocock remembers his life portraits\nand so keeps on repeating them ad infinitum. But, as Dr.\nPrince so pertinently remarks, is it not remarkable \" that\nno such limitations attach to the hands which are found\nphotographed in almost every position ? Strange that spirit\nagencies which can photograph hands clasped, hands in pockets,\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1920.\nhands extended, hands gesticulating, hands playing the violin\nor piano, hands guiding in the mazes of the dance, hands\nwith fingers outspread, hands clenched, hands in every con-\nceivable position, should not be able to turn the chin one\ninch from its position in one or other of the two life photo-\ngraphs, or to part the lips in the slightest, in thousands of\npictures.\"\nBut enough of such sarcasm. The photographs, like so\nmany others passing amongst us, are obviously fakes, and\nit is not surprising that \" Dr.\" Keeler has always been averse\nto any expert examination of his claims. Thus he refused\nto allow the late Dr. Hyslop to be present under any condi-\ntions at his sittings, and like other spirit photographers of\nour acquaintance is chary of answering letters addressed to\nhim by competent investigators.\nDr. Prince is naturally scornful of the \" recognized portraits\n\"\nclaimed by devout spiritualists, who discover them in any\nvague smudges palmed off on them by the astute photo-\ngraphers, and he has little difficulty in disposing of the claims\nof untrained observers who \" never lose sight of their plates\neven for an instant.\" The full story of how Keeler is found\nby Dr. Prince to have forged the spirit scripts cannot be\ndealt with here. We can only repeat our previous assertion\nthat the whole article is a masterly addition to existing material\non fraudulent spirit photographs and deserves the most careful\nattention of all serious-minded students of this difficult subject.\nE. J. D.\nII.\nThe Report of the Conference of Bishops of the Anghcan\nCommunion held at Lambeth Palace during July and August,\n1920, includes a statement by the Special Committee appointed\n\" to consider and report upon the Christian Faith in relation\nto Spiritualism.\"\nThe Committee after distinguishing between \" the investiga-\ntions of the phenomena of human consciousness . . . carried\non notably by the Society for Psychical Research,\" and \" the\nreligious cults and practices which have been created on the\nbasis of what is believed to have been discovered and known\n\fDec, 1920. Notes on Recent Periodicals. 277\nas Spiritualism,\" goes on to pay a tribute to the work of\nthe Society in the following terms :\nIn answering the first question we sav without hesitation\nthat we welcome scientific investigation ; we recognize the patience\nand the skill with which members of the Psychical Research\nSociety examine the mass of evidence of all kinds submitted\nto them, and above all the unmistakable desire to safeguard\nthe inquiry against illusion or fraud, to arrive at truths, and to\ninterpret scientific facts correctly. . . . Our desire is to understand\nwhat conclusions have been reached along these lines of research.\nThese have been stated as follows :\n(1) There is a conviction of the reality of telepathy, or com-\nmunication between living beings by means which appear to\nbe independent of the normal sense-organs.\n(2) There is also a conviction of the reality of a subconsciousness\nwhich may operate without the control of the normal consciousness\nand will {e.g. in dreams).\n(3) This does not necessarily imply communication with beings\nno longer limited by the conditions of bodily existence as we\nknow it here ; but there are phenomena which appear to support\nthat hypothesis.\n(4) In investigating such phenomena gxeat difficulties arise\nowing to the play, very imperfectly understood, of the sul>\nconscious self in the medium employed and in the enquirer.\nMrs. Henry Sidgwick writes :\n\" Before we can convince the\nworld we not only want more cases giving evidence of the fact\nof personal survival but we want them solidly based on more\nknowledge of the subliminal self and the way it works, more\nknowledge of the conditions and process of telepathy, more\nunderstanding of the limitations under which communication\nwith the dead occurs.\"\nThe outcome of these conclusions from the scientific side would\nseem to be :\n(1) To give a serious warning against unregulated and undue\nexercise of an element of human consciousness which acts inde-\npendently of the reason and the will, and against allowing reason\nand will to abdicate in its favour.\n(2) To insist upon an outlook ujjon life which refuses to accept\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1920.\nmaterialism as a sufficient account of phenomena, and to en-\ncourage belief in a spiritual explanation.\nWe welcome inquiry conducted in this reverent and scrupulous spirit.\nIII.\nThe second numlber of the Psychic Research Quarterly'^\n(October, 1920) contains several articles of much interest to\nthe student of psychical research. The late Dr. W. J. Craw-\nford discusses the psychic structures observed in the presence\nof Miss Kathleen Goligher, of Belfast. Dr. Crawford relates\nhow after many months it was found possible to make these\n\" psychic structures \" visible, and his article includes several\nphotographs of the plasma, from which, according to Dr.\nCrawford's theory, are made the \" psychic rods \" by means of\nwhich the levitations and other physical phenomena associated\nwith Miss Goligher's mediumship take place. This \" plasma\n\"\nwould appear to present analogies with the \" substance\n\"\nobserved in the case of \" Eva C.'s \" mediumship, a point,\nwhich, if it could be clearly established, would be of con-\nsiderable interest and importance.\nMr. Kenneth Richmond \u2022\ncontributes to the number an\narticle on \" the powers of the unconscious \" in which he\nconsiders how the discoveries made by modern methods of psycho-\nanalysis may be turned to account to investigate the phenomena\nof so-called \" trance-mediumship.\" Dream analysis, he says,\nshould be of value in diagnosing imconscious fraud in sensitives ;\nand the conscientious sensitive, to whom unconscious fraud is\nthe greatest of bugbears, should especially welcome this method\nof criticism. ... I have given special attention to the analysis\nof certain, muddled, unsuccessful sittings with professional sensi-\ntives . . . , in order to search out any evidence of conscious\nor unconscious fabrication. . . .\nI could not discover, in their worst muddles, any sign of\nfabrication or fraud. At their best they gave evidence of one\nclass or another ; at their w^orst they gave what I can only\ndescribe as honest confusion.\nThe number also contains (amongst others) articles on\nThe Evidence for Telepathy : an Historical Survey, by E. R.\nDodds, and Evidential Matter of Practical Importance, by\n(Una) Lady Troubridge.\n^ Kegan Paul, Trench, Tiubner & Co., Ltd. Price, 3\/6 net.\n\fDec, 1920 Correspondence. 279\nCORKESPONDENCE.\nI. CONCEENING \" A CASE OF PSYCHOMETRY ?\n\"\nTo the Editor of the Jourxal or the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014With reference to the incident in connection\nwith the Statuette of Nefer Smaa recounted on -page 230 of the\nJuly Journal, I venture to call your attention to a fact which\nmay possibly have escaped your notice, as it also appears to\nhave escaped that of Mr. H. S. Cowper. Plutarch, in his life\nof Solon, gives the name of the Priest of Sais who told Solon\nthe story of Atlantis. He is there called Sonchis. I have not\nthe Greek text by me, and can only refer you to North's transla-\ntion, page 328 in the Temple Classics Edition. Possibly an\nEgyptologist might be able to suggest the hieroglyphic original of\nSonchis, but it cannot (I imagine) be the same as that which\nMr. Cowper transliterates as Nefer Smaa. As the interest of\nMr. Cowper's story hinges on the assumjDtion that Nefer Smaa\nhad something to do with the telling of the Atlantis story to\nSolon, it would be interesting to know\n:\n(1) Whether there is any Egyptian record of the priests of\nSais at the period in question from which Sonchis \" could be\nidentified.\n(2) In what relation, as regards age, he stood to Nefer Smaa ?\nThe British Museum authorities might perhaps be able to help.\nIf they were contemporaries, and both Priests of Neith at the\nsame time, it would give additional weight to the supposition\nthat Nefer Smaa was anyhow present when Solon heard the story\nof Atlantis.\nG. W. Lambert.\nEditorial Note.\nWith regard to the question raised by Mr. Lambert, Mr. Cowper,\nto whom we forwarded Mr. Lambert's letter, wrote to Prof.\nFlinders Petrie and received the following reply :\n\" Sonchis cannot have anything to do with Nefer Smaa.\nThere are no continuous records of the Saitie priesthood, only\nstray figures like yours ; nor is there anything to fix the date\nof your figure within a century or more.\"\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1920.\nII. THE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF PSYCHO-\nDYNAMIC PHENOMENA.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam, \u2014The probability tliat opportunities for the systematic\ninvestigation of sensitives purporting to produce psycho-dynamic\nphenomena will occur in the future, may justify some remarks\non one aspect of these phenomena, which appears largely to have\nbeen neglected both by investigators and their critics.\nFor example, in the case of Eusajna Palladino, controversy\ncentred itself chiefly on the question whether the control of the\nlimbs of the sensitive was adequate. It was tacitly assumed\n\u2014\nboth by the experimenters who asserted, and by the critics who\ndenied the sufiiciency of that control\u2014^that if Eusapia could have\nreleased a hand or a foot, a normal explanation for the pheno-\nmena was at once available.\nThus Podmore wrote regarding the records of the S.P.R. Naples\nsittings :\n\" Things did not, as a rule, happen outside of a moderate\nradius\u2014say, 3 feet\u2014from Eusapia's person. In a word, if Eusapia\ncould have freed an arm, or a leg, she could have done every-\nthing.\"\n\u2014\n{The Newer Sjnritualism, p. 119.)\nThere is a clear fallacy in this statement. The effective radius\nof hand grasp of a person of Eusapia's build, when seated upright\nin a chair\u2014and we may surely assume that, even under un-\nsatisfactory conditions of control and lighting, there could be\nno doubt as to whether the sensitive was seated or not\u2014could\nhardly exceed 2 feet.\nIn spite of reasoned arguments such as those of Richet in\nconnection with the 1894 sittings, critics will continue to maintain\nthat no control which is based on the tactile perceptions of the\nsitters can be adequate.\nIt would seem, therefore, that the chief point on which attention\nshould be concentrated in any future experiments, is the accurate\nobservation as to whether any phenomena occur, which could\nnot have been produced by the sensitive through the normal agency\nof her limbs, even if those limbs were free.\nIn the case of Eusapia the records\u2014even those of tlie S.P.R.\nNaples sittings\u2014contain many phenomena which appear to comply\nwith tins condition, and the same is true of the Belfast experi-\nments.\n\fDec, 1920. Gorrespondence. 281\nThe practical application of these remarks to auy series of\nsittings would be somewhat as follows :\n(1) The Control\u2014apart from initial and final examinations\n\u2014\nneed not go beyond the assurance that the sensitive does not\nmove, or move from, her chair, an assurance easily obtained\neven in darkness.\n(2) The positions of all articles in the seance room forming, or\nlikely to form, subject matter for phenomena, should be accurately\nmeasured before and after the seances and recorded on scale\ndrawings.\n(3) After each sitting an \" imitation \" seance should be held,\nin which the movements should be repeated, so that it could\nbe decided whether they were reproducible by normal muscular\nmeans.\nIf it was found that some object was moved, or touched,\nwhich was definitely beyond the reach of the sensitive, we should\nhave no alternative (the use of \" apparatus \" being excluded by\nthe initial and final examinations) but to admit that we had\nobserved a definite telekinetic phenomenon.\nFairly close measurement is needed, since the existing evidence\nseems to show that telekinetic extensions (if such there be) do\nnot reach more than a short distance beyond the extremities\nof the sensitive.\nIt is suggested that this method\u2014in which control is concen-\ntrated more on the objects moved than on the ostensible mover\nof them\u2014is unlikely to upset the psychic equilibrium of the\nsensitive. Also\u2014and this is even more important\u2014it relieves the\nexperimenters from the severe strain of continuous hand and\nfoot control.\nIt would be interesting to learn whether those members of the\nSociety, who have had such exceptional experience in the conduct\nof these experiments, consider that the method which I have\nroughly outlined offers any prospect of success.\nG.

Graham, M.A. Universitj\nPress, Cambridge. 1920.\nThis book is of very high value for its author's purpose as\na history and philosophy of Quakerism. The story of the Society\nof Friends from its foundation to the passing day, in which the\nWar has set their ideals and practice in a very clear light and\nmade their tenets a matter of pressing public concern, is told\nwith fulness of knowledge, with freshness of style, and with an\namiability of tone which very graciously commends the doctrine\nit expounds. Headers of practical mind will probably turn first\nto the long chapter on War (where, however, this reader fails\nto find an answer to the all-important question, why it should\nbe right to resist a wild beast and wrong to resist a murderous\nfellowman), but students of the philosophy of religion will find\nmuch nutriment of thought in the sections on Ministry, Silent\nWorship, and especially the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper ;\nnor must the last chapter on Evangelicalism be omitted. But\nfor the specific purpose of this notice the fourth and fifth chapters\n(\"The Living Christ \" and \" The Personality of Man \") are of\nthe most interest, for these are an endeavour to take up into\nthe religious philosophy of the Friends the results of recent\npsychical research.\nBriefly, the author adopts the hypothesis mooted by the late\nDr. Sanday \"of an essential unity after all between the Divine\nand the Human (in Jesus Christ), so that one whose outward\nsupraliminal life was wholly the product of heredity and terrestrial\nevolution might yet have a subliminal or hidden man not so\ndifferent from our own as to destroy his fellowship with us,\nbut yet pure and right and divine without known defect.\" One\nreadily agrees that this conception is somewhere on the way\nto the yet unverified truth of the relation of the Human Jesus\nto the Divine Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.\nThe unity and continuity of all human consciousnesses with one\nanother is, for most of us who study the question, a fact estab.\nlished by the phenomena of thought-transference ;\nand the con-\ntinuity of the human with the divine consciousness is an inference\nwhich we draw with confidence if we believe that the universe\n\fDec, 1920. Reviews. 283\nis one and \" heaven and earth are threads of the same loom.\"\nBut that the subliminal influx into the individual mind is the\ncurrent of divine inspiration more than of mundane monitions\nor even of evil suggestions is rendered most unlikely by the\nfact that a man's individuality is the highest and most fateful\nself of him, while the subliminal consciousness is that part of\nhis self which is least his own and is shared with his fellows.\nIf prophet and bard\nWhen God made music through them could but speak,\nHis music by the framework and the chord,\nit is through that which is most individual in the man, the\nframework and chord of his nature, that the divine communica-\ntion comes. However this be, we are grateful to our author\nfor a most suggestive enquiry into '\"\nthe imity between the\nhistoric Jesus of Nazareth and the Indwelling Christ,'\" for that\nis the road, we are con\\'inced, on which theology to-day has\nmost need to travel.\nII.\nPsychical Research for the Plain Man.

It is no\neasy task to compile from the vast amount of matter contained\nin the Proceedings and the Journal a collection of excerpts which\nshall be both evidential and interesting to the ordinary reader.\nAttention may, however, be drawn to one omission. Beyond\na passing reference to the Belfast experiments\u2014contained, some-\nwhat ina2:)propriately, in an excellent chapter on Poltergeists\u2014no\nspace is devoted to what is to-day probably the most immedi-\nately important and potentially fruitful department of psychical\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1920.\nresearch, namely, the investigation of para-psychic phenomena.\nA synopsis of the activities of psychical research which ignores\nthe work done, both at home and abroad, on the investigation\nof sensitives purporting to produce \" physical \" or \" materializa-\ntion \" phenomena, can hardly be considered comprehensive.\nIt is probable that this omission is due to lack of space. It\nis suggested, however, that a remark to this effect should have\nbeen inserted in the preface ; and that in the next edition\n\u2014\nwhich will, doubtless, soon be required\u2014this should be done.\nStudents of psychical research will be surprised to find no\nreference to the trance mediumshij) of Mrs. Piper or Mrs. Leonard.\nThis is due to the limitation which Miss Kingsford has imposed\nupon herself ; the exclusion of cases connected with mediums\nwho receive payment.\" It would seem questionable whether\nsuch a concession to popular prejudice is altogether well advised.\nFor it is of the first importance that any serious inquirer should\nbe led to appreciate, that the powers of subliminal (unconscious)\ndeception are so much greater than those of supraliminal (con-\nscious) deception, that bona fides alone does not carry us very\nfar ; while suspicion of mala fides does not invalidate results\nwhich comply with the only sure condition, namely that the\ninformation given by the sensitive could not possibly have been\nobtained by normal means.\nThe author might, however, contend\u2014and with some force\n\u2014\nthat in a book of this sort concession to existing prejudices is\nan indispensable preliminary to obtaining a hearing from the\n\" jury of the general public.\"\nThat this book will serve a useful purpose is abundantly clear.\nThere have been other attempts to present a summary of the\nresults of psychical research, but few, if any, in which that\npresentation has been made so interesting and readable for the\ngeneral public.\nG.
